14. ABSTRACT
From 2009 through 2012, archeobotanical investigations were conducted at seven prehistoric archeological sites on Fort Hood, Texas. The project was a
collaborative effort by the Fort Hood Cultural Resources Branch, Prewitt and Associates, Inc., the Archaeological-Ecology Laboratory within the Department of
Anthropology at Texas A&M University, and Macrobotanical Analysis in Manchaca, Texas. Funded by the United States Army, Fort Hood, the investigations were
conducted at Paluxy sites 41CV947, 41CV594, 41CV984, 41CV1049, and 41CV1553 and at alluvial sites 41CV1104 and 41CV1657. The field and laboratory work
focused on finding and examining a specific kind of burned rock feature—earth ovens—along with the recovery and interpretation of archeobotanical evidence from
these cooking features.
Ground-penetrating radar surveys were conducted at three Paluxy sites, and the GPR survey at 41CV1553 was especially successful in detecting a formerly
unknown burned rock mound. Archeological fieldwork included mechanical and hand excavations to locate and document burned rock features, and the feature
investigations focused on the extraction of archeobotanical sampling from feature contexts. Sediment samples were floated to recover macrobotanical remains, and
sediment and burned rock samples were collected for plant microfossil recovery.
The data analyses were conducted from 2009 through 2013, and the laboratory work focused on the extraction and identification of macrobotanical remains and
plant microfossils, primarily starch granules, from feature contexts. In addition, a small sample of chipped and ground stone tools, previously recovered from multiple
sites and curated in Fort Hood’s collections, was examined to extract and identify microfossils. The interpretations of the archeological and botanical finds are
supported by extensive laboratory and actualistic experiments to replicate the cooking environments in electric ovens, open-air stone boiling, and in-ground earth
ovens.
These archeobotanical studies reported herein add considerably to our knowledge of geophytes that were gathered and baked in earth ovens. One of the most
significant contributions, derived from the experimental work, is a greater understanding of how plant microfossils get disolved into solution and are transported within
the steamy cooking environment of a sealed earth oven. This evidence helps explain how plant microfossils end up concentrated on and below the bottom rocks lining
the bases of prehistoric ovens.
The experimental and archeological studies also demonstrate a high potential for modern contamination, specifically the airborne introduction of modern starch
grains into archeological samples. The investigations identified the principal sources of starch grain contamination of archeological samples as: (1) airborne starch
grains introduced during field excavation and sample extraction; and (2) airborne starch grains introduced by laboratory technicians during the microfossil extraction
process. Despite these concerns, archeologists and lab technicians can implement sampling and analysis protocols that limit and measure the degree of airborne
contamination, and microfossil analysts can differentiate between ancient starch grains and modern contaminants in archeological samples.

Abstract
From 2009 through 2012, archeobotanical field investigations were conducted at seven
prehistoric archeological sites on Fort Hood, Texas. The project was a collaborative effort by the
Fort Hood Cultural Resources Branch, Prewitt and Associates, Inc., the Archaeological-Ecology
Laboratory within the Department of Anthropology at Texas A&M University, and Macrobotanical
Analysis in Manchaca, Texas. Funded by the United States Army, Fort Hood, the investigations were
conducted at Paluxy sites 41CV947, 41CV594, 41CV984, 41CV1049, and 41CV1553 and at alluvial
sites 41CV1104 and 41CV1657. The field and laboratory work focused on finding and examining a
specific kind of burned rock feature—earth ovens—along with the recovery and interpretation of
archeobotanical evidence from these cooking features.
Ground-penetrating radar surveys were conducted at three Paluxy sites, and the GPR
survey at 41CV1553 was especially successful in detecting a formerly unknown burned rock mound.
Archeological fieldwork included mechanical and hand excavations to locate and document burned
rock features, and the feature investigations focused on the extraction of archeobotanical sampling
from feature contexts. Sediment samples were floated to recover macrobotanical remains, and
sediment and burned rock samples were collected for plant microfossil recovery.
The data analyses were conducted from 2009 through 2014, and the laboratory work focused
on the extraction and identification of macrobotanical remains and plant microfossils, primarily
starch granules, from feature contexts. In addition, a small sample of chipped and ground stone
tools, previously recovered from multiple sites and curated in Fort Hood’s collections, was examined
to extract and identify microfossils. The interpretations of the archeological and botanical finds are
supported by extensive laboratory and actualistic experiments to replicate the cooking environments
in electric ovens, open-air stone boiling, and in-ground earth ovens.
These archeobotanical studies reported herein add considerably to our knowledge of geophytes
that were gathered and baked in earth ovens. One of the most significant contributions, derived
from the experimental work, is a greater understanding of how plant microfossils get disolved into
solution and are transported within the steamy cooking environment of a sealed earth oven. This
evidence helps explain how plant microfossils end up concentrated on and below the bottom rocks
lining the bases of prehistoric ovens.
The experimental and archeological studies also demonstrate a high potential for modern
contamination, specifically the airborne introduction of modern starch grains into archeological
samples. The investigations identified the principal sources of starch grain contamination of
archeological samples as: (1) airborne starch grains introduced during field excavation and sample
extraction; and (2) airborne starch grains introduced by laboratory technicians during the microfossil
extraction process. Despite these concerns, archeologists and lab technicians can implement sampling
and analysis protocols that limit and measure the degree of airborne contamination, and microfossil
analysts can differentiate between ancient starch grains and modern contaminants in archeological
samples.

management summary
The archeological site investigations reported herein were conducted by Prewitt
and Associates, Inc. (PAI) and the Anthropology Department at Texas A&M University
(TAMU) for the Cultural Resources Management (CRM) program, United States Army,
Fort Hood. Logistically, the archeological work occurred over a period of six years, from
2009 to 2014, and it was funded by Fort Hood through two separate contracts and
multiple work orders administered by the Fort Worth District, United States Army
Corps of Engineers (USACE). Much of this work was done under three delivery orders
within a USACE contract between the Fort Worth District and PAI. This was Contract
No. W9126G-05-0010 and included Delivery Orders No. 0036, 0040, and 0041 (PAI
Project Nos. 208026, 209016, and 209022). Additional work was completed with PAI
serving as a subcontractor for the Gulf South Research Corporation under their Fort
Worth USACE Contract No. W9126G-09-D-0067. This work was authorized by Delivery
Order No. 0045 (PAI Project No. 211020).

What Work Was Done?
All of the investigations were directed by co-principal investigators Douglas K.
Boyd, Alston V. Thoms, and Karl W. Kibler, and the fieldwork was conducted in two phases.
Phase I fieldwork was completed in 2009–2010 and focused on three Paluxy sites. The
Phase II fieldwork was completed in 2011–2012 and focused on two additional Paluxy
sites and two alluvial sites, along with more intensive work at one of the Phase I Paluxy
sites. The investigations at these seven sites are summarized as follows:

Minor work was also done at three other Paluxy sites—41CV478, 41CV1027,
and 41CV1391. The minimal investigations conducted at these sites determined that
they were not good candidates for feature testing and archeobotanical sampling.
The sites chosen for investigation were selected by the Fort Hood CRM
program in consultation PAI and TAMU researchers. One management objective was
to investigate selected sites on Fort Hood, and one primary research objective was
to examine and document specific types of burned rock features—namely burned
rock mounds and earth ovens. A second primary research objective was to recover
macrobotanical remains and plant microfossils to aid in interpreting how the burned
rock features were constructed and used, and identify exactly what prehistoric peoples
were cooking in them and using as insulation material. The investigations involved the
field collection of plants to create a starch grain reference collection for selected central
Texas plants and extensive laboratory work to identify the macrobotanical remains and
microfossils (starch grains and phytoliths) coming from archeological features. Some
aspects of this work charted new ground in Texas archeology, especially the extensive
laboratory experiments and actualistic experiments to track the movements of plant
microfossils within a replicated earth oven-cooking environment. This technical report
presents the results of these archeological feature investigations and the various types
of experimental and archeobotanical studies.

What Are the Results?
Reevaluating the National Register eligibility of the investigated sites was one
of the goals of this project, particularly for the sites where more substantive excavations
were completed. A reassessment of archeological research potential and National Register
eligibility was made for the nine sites that had been previously tested and considered
to be eligible. Intact buried features were found and partially investigated at the newly
recorded Gully Mouth site, 41CV1657, and its research potential and eligibility were
also evaluated herein for the first time. The table below provides a summary of the site
investigations and National Register site assessments for this project. For all ten of the
sites, the archeological investigations undertaken were fairly limited relative to the
large sizes of these sites, and the current investigations confirmed the presence of intact
burned rock features that can yield interpretable archeological evidence. Consequently,
each of these sites is recommended as eligible for listing in the National Register under
Criterion D. The National Register assessments are discussed in Chapter 3, along with
descriptions of the minimal investigations at three sites—41CV478, 41CV1027, and
41CV1391. For the seven sites that were the primary focus of this project—41CV947,
41CV594, 41CV984, 41CV1049, 41CV1104, 41CV1553, and 41CV1657—the archeological
investigations, findings, and assessments are described in detail in their respective
sections (see Chapters 4 through 8).

Aside from the site evaluations, the archeological findings from the
archeobotanical investigations of these seven sites are valuable for what they contribute
to our understanding of prehistory. The evidence strengthens and adds to our knowledge
of the role that geophytes (and their underground storage organs) played in the
subsistence practices of prehistoric hunters and gathers in central Texas. The evidence
increased knowledge of prehistoric cooking technologies involving earth ovens and
burned rock mounds. But this work also demonstrates that a great deal of important
evidence can be derived from targeted but limited investigations of burned rock features.
Flotation of feature sediments to recover charred macrobotanical remains is a wellestablished and informative analytical tool, but the interpretation of prehistoric features
is greatly enhanced when microfossil studies are added to the archeologist’s tool kit. In
the field and in the laboratory, an awareness of potential sample contamination issues
is essential, but the introduction of modern microfossils into ancient samples can be
limited by careful field sampling and analytical procedures. In addition, taking control
samples of airborne remains in the field provides the evidence needed to infer and factor
out the kinds and amounts of airborne contaminants. The bottom line for archeological
research is that sampling, extraction, and study of plant microfossils (including starch
grains and phytoliths) from specific feature contexts can greatly enhance our ability
to interpret prehistoric cooking features and the subsistence practices of past huntergatherer peoples.
Through feature-oriented archeological investigations and the combined use
of macrobotanical and microfossil sampling, more information can be gleaned from
burned rock features than ever before, and our work has just scratched the surface of
this research potential. From a management perspective, the findings presented herein
should indeed influence how archeologists view the research potential of burned rock
features that are ubiquitous on Fort Hood and are found over most of Texas and in many
locations across the United States.

Dissemination of Findings
This technical report meets the legal obligations that are required in CRM
investigations conducted under federal regulations. However, the project team considered
this report to be insufficient for spreading the results of this work, especially the
important findings of the extensive microfossil studies, to the widest possible audience.
Consequently, one of the secondary goals of this archeobotanical research project was
to disseminate the significant results of the plant microfossil studies to the larger
archeological community. This was accomplished through the publication of three articles
in professional peer-reviewed journals:

Introduction to the fort hood
archeobotanical Project

Douglas K. Boyd, Karl W. Kibler, and Alston V. Thoms

This report is the culmination of a multiyear collaborative effort between the
Cultural Resources Management Program at Fort Hood, Texas (Fort Hood CRM),
Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (PAI), the Archaeological-Ecology Laboratory at the
Department of Anthropology at Texas A&M University (TAMU), and Macrobotanical
Analysis in Austin, Texas. The investigations reported here involve archeological
excavations at seven prehistoric sites on Fort Hood between 2009 and 2012, with
subsequent data analysis and reporting from ca. 2010 through 2014 (Figure 1.1 and
Table 1.1). Five of these seven sites are classified as Paluxy sites, a type of prehistoric
campsite and ecological setting that is unique on Fort Hood and a limited area of
north-central Texas because of its geological history. In Figure 1.1, the mapped area
of the Paluxy Formation is from the Geological Atlas of Texas, Waco Sheet (Proctor
et al. 1970), and the mapped areas of Cisco and Wise soils are from the Soil Survey of
Coryell County (McCaleb 1985). These soils are derived from the Paluxy Formation,
and their distribution is a more accurate representation of the true extent of Paluxy
Formation outcrops on Fort Hood.
The project began as a series of limited data recovery investigations to find
and investigate burned rock features at selected Paluxy sites to assist the Fort
Hood CRM program in its site management activities. As the project evolved, the
work became increasingly focused on finding and investigating earth oven features,
with intensive and specialized sampling to recover feature-associated botanical
remains, especially plant microfossils.1 The project scope was expanded to include
investigation of burned rock features exposed at two alluvial sites. This data
recovery project incorporated a research strategy focused on earth oven features
and archeobotanical evidence.
This archeological report is essentially a study of prehistoric human plant
utilization in a small slice of central Texas, with the research focusing on the
relationships between people, earth oven cooking, and the selection and processing
of specific plant foods derived from the underground storage organs (USOs) of
geophytes. From its inception, this was conceived as a feature-oriented research
Microfossils include tiny plant parts such as pollen, phytoliths, remnant plant fibers, calcium
oxalate crystals, and starch grains. Although many plant parts deteriorate and disappear rapidly,
several types of microfossils are quite durable and may survive for long periods of time in the
archeological record. However, preservation of plant microfossils is quite variable in different archeological contexts, depending on the type of microfossil and specific burial conditions over time.

recovery of plant microfossils, the taxonomic identification of the starch grains
became the primary research emphasis. Gradually the project became more complex
than we anticipated, and it led us down research avenues and paths that we never
could have imagined. None of us could have predicted the twists and turns this
project would take as we intensified the microfossil sampling and starch grain
analysis efforts. Planning the fieldwork was relatively straightforward, but we
certainly underestimated the time that would be needed to conduct all the necessary
experimental research and laboratory processing, and the large amount of data
that we would generate that needed to be analyzed and fully reported. During
the project, however, we also learned more than we could have imagined about
geophytes (plants that bear perinatal tissue underground such as bulbs, corms, and
taproots) and prehistoric human use of USOs, as well as the complex relationships
between earth oven technology, the taphonomy of plants cooked inside earth ovens,
and the analysis and interpretation of starch grains and other plant microfossils.
We also learned some surprising facts about the potential for modern starch grain
contamination and the implications for archeological microfossil studies. As a result
of what we learned during this project, we can offer many suggestions regarding
archeological field sampling protocols and methods for handling and analyzing
microfossil samples in the laboratory. Ultimately, our findings indicate the utility
of plant microfossil studies as a means of furthering our understanding of burned
rock features, which are common throughout the central Texas archeological record
and in many other parts of the world.
Why Paluxy sites and Geophytes?
This project began with a focus on the Paluxy sites at Fort Hood and the
archeological investigation of heated rock cooking features, specifically focusing on
burned rock middens and their internal features. Previous research has taught us
that these topics are intimately related. Some background information is necessary
to understand how the current project came into existence and why the focus of this

work shifted toward an intensive investigation of earth oven features, geophytes,
and the extraction and analysis of starch grains and other plant microfossils.
The Fort Hood military reservation encompasses over 339 mi 2 area
(217,000 acres) near the center of Texas, and archeological investigations on this
large tract of federal land have been ongoing for decades. Since the 1970s, Fort Hood
has been engaged in a program to inventory and evaluate the cultural resources
to determine their eligibility for listing in the National Register of Historic Places
(National Register), in accordance with the regulations of the 1966 National Historic
Preservation Act (36 CFR 800). As of 2003, the CRM Program had surveyed over
95 percent of the Fort Hood lands and documented more than 2,200 historic and
prehistoric archeological sites (Mehalchick, Kibler et al. 2003:1). As of 2014, the
program has published more than 60 reports of investigations in its Archeological
Resource Management Series (Directorate of Public Works 2014).
Thirty-seven of the more than 1,100 prehistoric archeological sites on Fort
Hood are classified as Paluxy sites (Barrett et al. 2007:Table 1). From a cultural
resource manager’s point of view, Paluxy sites are a difficult site type to manage
for a variety of reasons. The archeological remains are generally shallowly buried
in sandy deposits where groves of oak and other hardwood trees are concentrated.
These characteristics make these locations very popular camping spots for soldiers
doing training exercises in the western portion of the base. The archeological
remains at Paluxy sites are particularly vulnerable to disturbances caused by
tanks and other heavy tracked vehicles, as well as by soldiers camping on them
during training exercises. This was once a significant problem on Fort Hood until
the CRM Program made several changes to protect sensitive sites. All National
Register-eligible sites are designated as “No Dig” areas where the military does
not camp. Many sensitive sites have been protected by restricting vehicle traffic by
moving tank trails, installing barracades to prevent access, and capping selected
areas with rubble. To date, the Fort Hood CRM program has constructed over 175
barricades or caps to protect archeological sites. Sensitive areas at eight Paluxy
sites have been protected by barricades or rerouting of tank trails (Richard Jones,
personal communication 2015). Fort Hood’s CRM Program needs to know as much
as possible about which Paluxy sites have the greatest research potential and
warrant protection. Consequently, the initial goal of the Paluxy site work that began
in 2009 was management oriented, but it also included a limited collaboration with
the TAMU researchers to investigate prehistoric plant use by examining plant
microfossils.
Archeological interest in Paluxy sites began about two decades ago when
investigators noted a correlation between the reddish sand outcrops and cultural
occupations after many years of archeological investigations at Fort Hood.2 The
Paluxy Formation sands occur only in the western portion of the base and are
discontinuous, forming a “thin, spotty mantle on the upper Glen Rose rather than
a continuous outcrop” (Abbott 1994:329). By the early 1990s, researchers had noted
that prehistoric populations appeared to prefer these sandy sediment patches as

and Boyd and Mehalchick (2004).

camp locations (Abbott 1994:329). Ongoing investigations in the 1990s and 2000s by
archeologists from Mariah Associates, Inc. (Abbott and Trierweiler 1995a; Trierweiler
1996) and Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (Kleinbach et al. 1999; Mehalchick et al. 1999,
2000 2004; Mehalchick, Kibler et al. 2003; Mehalchick, Killian et al. 2003) reinforced
two conclusions: (1) Paluxy sites on Fort Hood have a unique geologic, topographic,
and hydrologic setting unlike any other localities on the base; and (2) prehistoric
populations sought out and intensively occupied these Paluxy site localities. The
Paluxy Formation sands are limited and occur on intermediate uplands characterized
by exposed limestone hills and slopes. Since prehistoric peoples intensively used
these sand exposures, the abundance of Paluxy sites offers a unique opportunity
to examine and understand human activities and resource utilization in a specific
landscape setting within western Fort Hood.
The Cretaceous-age Paluxy Formation occurs in subsurface across an
extensive portion of central, north-central, and northeast Texas. Friable fine- to
very fine-grained quartz sand dominates the Paluxy Formation, and discontinuous
outcrops of these sandy beds are found along its western edge. The southeast margins
of these discontinuous outcrops occur on the western portion of Fort Hood in Coryell
County (see Figure 1.1 in Mehalchick et al. 2004). All of these outcrops occur between
200 and 320 m above sea level, just below the sloping Killeen surface at its contact
with the upper margins on the incised stream valleys. The Paluxy outcrops on Fort
Hood are relatively small and difficult to map (Boyd et al. 2004; Kibler 1999; Short
et al. 2014). Within Fort Hood, only a small outcrop is shown on the 1:250,000-scale
Waco Sheet of the Geologic Atlas of Texas (Proctor et al. 1970). Paluxy outcrops also
occur in many other places but are too small to be mapped at that scale. However,
a better indicator of the true extent of Paluxy Formation outcrops in Western Fort
Hood is the distribution of Cisco and Wise soils, which cover about 1,800 acres, or
less than one percent of the total area of Fort Hood (McCaleb 1985) (see Figure
1.1). The relationship between the Cisco and Wise soils and the Paluxy Formation
is illustrated by Abbott (1994:Figure 9.10), Mehalchick et al. (2004:Figure 1.2), and
Short et al. (2014:Figures 8.8–8.10).
Several previous investigations have highlighted the correlation between
Paluxy Formation sand outcrops, their relative topographic locations in the Fort
Hood landscape, and the seemingly high frequency of archeological sites buried in the
Paluxy sands (Abbott and Trierweiler, ed. 1995a; Kleinbach et al. 1999; Mehalchick
et al. 2000; Short et al. 2014; Trierweiler, ed. 1994, 1995). Based on these findings,
investigators have argued that prehistoric populations lived periodically at Paluxy
locations to utilize nearby plant resources that clustered in and around the sandy
soils. The geomorphic and archeological evidence indicates intensive use of this
environment from the Late Archaic period through Protohistoric times. Paluxy sites
are generally characterized by numerous burned rock features containing charred
macrobotanical remains, and generalized artifact assemblages characteristic of
short-occupation residential base camps (i.e., chipped stone tools made of local chert
and some grinding tools).
As of 1999, direct evidence for prehistoric use of plant foods at Paluxy sites on
Fort Hood was limited to data derived from archeological investigations at four sites.

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

Indeterminate nutshell was recovered from 41CV947, indeterminate geophyte corm
fragments were found at 41CV988, and indeterminate nutshell (possibly walnut)
came from 41CV1093 (Kleinbach et al. 1999:65, 77–78, 100, Table 113). Excavations
at 41CV1553 produced indeterminate bulbs and oak acorn fragments, as well as
nutshells of pecan, hickory, and walnut (Mehalchick, Killian et al. 2003:202–214,
Table D.4). All of these charred plant remains were recovered in association with
burned rock features.
In 2000, PAI archeologists conducted a round of intensive archeological
investigations at three Paluxy sites on Fort Hood to mitigate damages done to
selected sites by cedar clearing and firebreak blading. Reported by Mehalchick et al.
(2004), the investigations included moderate work at 41CV988 and 41CV1141 and
intensive work at 41CV595. Several large earth oven features were excavated at
41CV595, the Firebreak site, with intensive sampling of feature-associated sediments
for flotation to recover macrobotanical remains. Abundant charred plant remains
were found, including 16 identifiable woods and 4 taxa of edible plant resources
recovered from earth oven features (Mehalchick et al. 2004:176). Feature 15, an
earth oven, produced many charred bulbs of eastern camas (Camassia scilloides).
Two earth oven features produced charred fragments from oak acorn and pecan
nutshell (Mehalchick et al. 2004:176). In addition, charred bulb fragments of eastern
camas and wild onion (Allium sp.) were recovered from the general scatter of burned
rocks around the earth ovens, which apparently represents debris discarded from
multiple earth oven cleanout episodes.
The intensive work at the Firebreak site led PAI archeologists to conclude
that geophyte bulbs were being baked in earth ovens, and that camas and wild
onion were two of the important plants being selectively and intensively harvested
by prehistoric populations in central Texas (Boyd et al. 2004). The investigators
synthesized the regional archeological data and reported that charred remains of
six species of geophytes represent important root foods processed in earth ovens—
eastern camas, wild onion, false garlic, rain lily, dog tooth violet, and unknown tuber
(possibly prairie turnip) (Mehalchick et al. 2004:Table 8.18 and Figure 9.4). The
intensive work at Firebreak site, along with work at other Paluxy sites and burned
rock mound and midden sites on Fort Hood, set the stage for the archeobotanical
investigations undertaken for the current project (Kibler 1999; Kleinbach et al.
1999:209; Mehalchick et al. 2002:39–43; Mehalchick et al. 2004).
INCEPTION OF THe current PROJECT
and summary of work
The archeological project described in this report was funded by the United
States Army, Fort Hood over a period of several years and was contracted through
the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District (USACE-FW). The
archeological investigations reported herein were authorized by numerous delivery
orders under two separate contracts (see Management Summary).
Planning for this project began in 2008, and the field investigations occurred
in two distinct phases. Phase I field investigations were conducted in 2009–2010,

Chapter 1

and Phase II fieldwork occurred in 2011–2012. Seven sites were investigated during
both phases; five of these were Paluxy sites, and the other two were alluvial sites.
All of the sites are in the same general area of western Fort Hood (see Figure 1.1).
The Phase I work occurred between May and July 2009, and again in May
2010, as part of Fort Hood’s ongoing Cultural Resources Management Program.
Archeological investigations were conducted at three Paluxy sites: 41CV984,
41CV1049, and 41CV1553. There were essentially two main goals for the Phase I
work. One was to assist the Fort Hood Cultural Resources Management Program in
its efforts to manage the large number of Paluxy sites (n = 37) in the western portion
of the base. These particular sites were selected because they were located in very
active army training areas, and the CRM Program wanted to reevaluate the research
potential and National Register eligibility of these sites. The other primary goal
was to search for burned rock features and, whenever possible, to gather evidence
of plant use associated with certain kinds of cooking features. These three Phase I
sites are typical of the Paluxy sites on Fort Hood, with the most prominent cultural
remains being burned rock features and chipped stone artifacts (Mehalchick et al.
2004). These sites were ideal for this project because one or more burned features
had been found at each site, thus increasing the potential that additional features
would be found and perhaps yield important evidence of plant use.
The Phase I work also included a pilot study to test the capability of groundpenetrating radar (GPR) surveys for identifying buried cultural features within the
sandy sediments at Paluxy sites. The same three sites—41CV984, 41CV1049, and
41CV1553—were determined to be well suited for GPR survey because each had at
least one large area that was relatively flat with minimal vegetation cover, and the
evidence suggested that cultural features would be relatively shallow.
However, while the Phase I fieldwork was in progress, we began to shift
the archeological research priorities for this project after a series of conversations
between archeologists at Fort Hood CRM, PAI, and the Archaeological-Ecology
Laboratory at TAMU. In 2009 and early in Phase I, PAI and TAMU researchers
began to collaborate to conduct intensive feature-oriented investigations with
a strong archeobotanical emphasis. Over the next few years, the data recovery
work was transformed into an intensive research endeavor aimed at efficiently
finding, investigating, and sampling burned rock features identifiable as earth
ovens. While the management objective was to reassess site eligibility, the research
objective was to obtain samples of burned rocks and sediments from earth ovens
specifically to recover macrobotanical remains and plant microfossils for analysis
and identification. The microfossil work became a major component of this project,
and it was aimed primarily at the recovery and identification of starch grains. As
part of Phase I, the TAMU team extracted microfossils from a sample of stone tools
recovered from previous investigations at several Fort Hood sites. The selection
included ground stone, battered stone, and chipped stone tools considered possible
candidates for use in pulverizing/kneeding geophytes.
As an outgrowth of the plant microfossil research, limited investigations were
conducted at a fourth site, 41CV1657, near the end of Phase I. Fort Hood archeologists

7

8

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

discovered this site in 2009, and it contained burned rock features exposed in the
alluvial deposits along Cottonwood Creek rather than in Paluxy-derived sediments.
A cursory examination revealed that this site was ideal for a quick investigation to
document burned rock features exposed in a vertical cutbank and to recover plant
microfossil samples from features in a non-Paluxy setting.
The Phase II work, conducted in 2011–2012, included work at four
prehistoric archeological sites, three of which are Paluxy sites: 41CV947, 41CV594,
and 41CV1553 (41CV1553 was also investigated during Phase I). The other site,
41CV1104, contained features buried in Holocene-age alluvial deposits. By the
time the Phase II fieldwork began, the TAMU team had begun experimenting with
electric ovens, replicated earth ovens, and stone boiling, and they had learned a
great deal about the methods and pitfalls of microfossil sampling and analysis. As
a result, the focus of the Phase II investigations shifted to targeting features that
appeared to be earth ovens for archeological investigation, followed by intensive
microfossil sampling. The intent was to collect large numbers of microfossil samples
(in the form of fire-cracked rocks and sediment) associated with earth ovens and to
analyze and identify the microfossils to examine plant use and earth oven cooking.
This work would also employ field techniques that would limit the amount of hand
excavation and labor needed to expose and sample the earth oven features.
From a management perspective, one may wonder: What do the plant
microfossil studies that were undertaken have to do with assessing archeological
site research potential and National Register eligibility? This is a legitimate
question, and the short answer is that National Register eligibility of prehistoric
sites under Criterion D, which is the potential to yield information important in
history or prehistory, is directly tied to our ability to learn from the archeological
investigations. The research potential of these archeological sites, and hence their
eligibility, can and must change as we discovery and implement new investigative
techniques that can yield meaningful insights into prehistory. If we can demonstrate
that microfossil extraction and analysis can increase the amount of useful data we
obtain from burned rock features, then these techniques must certainly change the
way we perceive the research potential of burned rock features and the National
Register eligibility of archeological sites containing those features. While some
archeologists have considered the possibility that we cannot learn much more from
continued archeological investigations of prehistoric cooking features constructed
and used by prehistoric peoples, the potential to develop new analytical techniques
and recover new types of evidence argues otherwise.
WHY PLANT MICROFOSSILS and starch grains?
The recovery of feature sediment for flotation recovery and identification
of charred plant remains is nothing new. It has been standard practice in Texas
for many years and has been consistently used for most of the prehistoric site
investigations conducted at Fort Hood since the mid-1990s (Abbott and Trierweiler
1995:Appendix G; Arnn et al. 2000:26; Kleinbach et al. 1999:Appendix E; Mehalchick
et al. 1999:Appendix D; Mehalchick et al. 2000:Appendix E; Mehalchick et al.
2002:Appendix C; Mehalchick, Kibler et al. 2003:Appendix D; Mehalchick Killian

Chapter 1

et al. 2003:Appendix E; Mehalchick et al. 2004:Appendix B; Mehalchick and Kibler
2005:Appendix D). Similarly, the recovery and analyses of some types of organic
residues (e.g., lipid analysis) and plant microfossils (e.g., pollen and phytoliths) have
been undertaken at quite a few Texas sites, with varying results, and this, too, has
been done for Fort Hood prehistoric sites (Malainey and Malisza 2004; Olive 1993;
Sobolik 1993). The organic residue and pollen studies have had limited success,
due primarily to the infancy of the ancient residue studies and to poor preservation
of the pollen. What has been learned from phytolith studies has been limited, too,
not by poor preservation, but by the lack of any systematic archeological sampling
program and a robust regional comparative sample of modern plants. In recent
decades, most of what has been learned about the use of plant foods by prehistoric
peoples in central Texas has come—not surprisingly—from charred macrobotanical
remains recovered from burned rock features (e.g., Black and Thoms 2014:212; Black
et al. 1997:266–267; Boyd et al. 2004:211–219; Dering 1997, 1998, 2004; Thoms 1989,
1998, 2003, 2008a, 2008b).
What had not been undertaken in Texas until this project was a systematic
attempt to recover, analyze, and identify starch grains that originated as plant
processing residues inside earth oven cooking features. The recovery and study
of microfossil starch grains from earth ovens has widespread implications for
archeological research since earth ovens are a common feature across all of central
and west Texas, and indeed in much of the United States and the world (Black and
Thoms 2014; Dering 1999; Laurence and Thoms 2011; Thoms 1998, 2006a, 2006b,
2008a, 2008b, 2009; Thoms et al. 2011; Wandsnider 1997). Because of this, it was
important for this Fort Hood archeobotanical project to focus on earth oven archeology
and the recovery of feature-associated plant remains, both macrobotanical remains
and microfossils. Much of this work was aimed specifically at the extraction and
identification of starch granules associated with plants known through ethnographic
accounts to have been cooked in earth ovens.
The research emphasis on starch grains was a natural outgrowth of the
TAMU people involved in this Fort Hood archeobotanical project. Much of Alston
Thoms’s archeological career has been devoted to studying plant use and human
cooking technologies, especially the relationship between earth ovens, geophytic
plants, and the intensification of plant use in prehistory (e.g., Black and Thoms 2014;
Thoms 1989, 1998, 2003, 2006a, 2006b, 2008a, 2008b, 2009; Thoms and Clabaugh
2011). Since most of the microfossil studies would be conducted by Andrew Laurence,
then a Ph.D. candidate whose research interest focused on starch grain analysis,
the analytical effort for the Fort Hood investigations also focused primarily on
starch grains. Up until this project, the recovery and analysis of starch grains from
numerous earth oven features in central Texas had never been undertaken in a
systematic fashion. Working closely with Thoms and Vaughn Bryant, Laurence would
become a key player in this project, and he his dissertation research was structured
to focus on the analysis of starch grains recovered from earth ovens on Fort Hood.
This collaboration and the focus on starch grain analysis would lead to
several important milestones for this project. It quickly became apparent that more
background research was needed to support the identifications of starch microfossils

9

10

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

and to identify exactly what was happening to microfossils when various plant foods
and packing materials were heated intensively inside an earth oven. This led the
TAMU team to collect modern plants and create a starch reference collection, again
focusing on geophyte species thought to be of economic importance to prehistoric
peoples in central Texas. The next logical step involved several rounds of intensive
experiments to cook and burn the modern plants and add the heated starch grains to
the reference collection. The TAMU team designed experiments using electric ovens,
replicas of earth ovens, and stone boiling with the goal of tracking the movements
of plant microfossils during the cooking episodes.
In the process, the TAMU project team made a discovery that would radically
change how we conducted our starch grain sampling and analysis. After the first
round of archeological samples were processed to extract microfossils, the TAMU
archeobotanists discovered that they were seeing Zea mays starch grains that
should not be present in samples taken from prehistoric hunter-gatherer cooking
features in central Texas. A literature review and subsequent experimental work
led them to realize that the Zea mays starch grains found in our archeological
samples were modern contaminants. They then discovered a variety of ways in
which modern starch grains can be inadvertently introduced into archeological
samples in the field or in the laboratory. This realization was extremely important
and ultimately led the TAMU team to develop new field sampling and laboratory
analysis protocols to minimize the potential for introducing modern contaminant
starch grains into archeological samples. These sampling method protocols are
one of the most significant contributions of this Fort Hood archeobotanical project.
Refining the techniques for examining burned rock features is fundamental to our
ability to maximize the integrity of sample data and reconstruct how and why
cooking features were used. What we can reasonably expect to learn from burned
rock features is critical to our perceptions of archeological research potential and
the long-term management of archeological resources.
report organization
Chapters 2 through 8 present background information and basic archeological
data. Chapter 2 presents environmental and archeological background for Fort
Hood, focusing on Paluxy sites and burned rock features. Chapter 3 summarizes
the project’s research goals, work accomplished, and methods of investigations.
Chapters 4 through 8 describe the archeological work and findings at each of the
seven intensively investigated sites.
The next seven chapters, 9 through 15, focus on the plant microfossil
studies conducted by the TAMU team. Chapter 9 summarizes all of the sites and
features targeted for microfossil sampling. Background information on plant
microfossil studies is presented in Chapter 10, providing the contextual framework
for understanding the research goals and archeological sampling methods for
our archeobotanical research. This chapter also includes a discussion of how the
TAMU scientists recognized the potential for airborne microfossil contamination
of archeological samples and how the microfossil field sampling and laboratory
analysis methods evolved over the course of this project. Chapters 11 and 12

Chapter 1

report on the experimental research conducted to gain a better understanding of
how plant remains, and microfossils in particular, behave in laboratory heating
experiments and in replicated earth ovens. These studies proved critical for knowing
how to sample archeological earth ovens to maximize the potential for extracting
microfossils derived from prehistoric cooking activities.
The next three chapters are the meat of the report in terms of the
archeobotanical studies. The detailed analysis of our plant microfossil studies
are presented in Chapter 14, and Chapter 15 presents the interpretations of the
microfossil data.3 The final chapter, Chapter 16, contains a summary of the significant
findings resulting from the intensive archeobotanical investigations of earth oven
features on Fort Hood. This final chapter also offers recommendations for the longterm management of Fort Hood’s archeological resources in light of what can be
learned from careful investigation and extraction of macrobotanical (flotation) and
microfossil samples.
This report includes three appendixes containing large sets of archeological
data and results of special studies. Appendix A contains the results of GPR surveys
conducted by Tiffany Osburn (Texas Historical Commission) at three Paluxy sites:
41CV984, 41CV1049, and 41CV1553. This was a pilot study to test the utility of
GPR surveying in the Paluxy setting, and it demonstrates that this remote sensing
technique is very effective for locating buried burned rock features in some cases.
Appendix B contains the macrobotanical analysis reports by Dr. Leslie Bush for
each of the sites that yielded macrobotanical remains. Appendix C contains all of
the microfossil identification data compiled by Andrew Laurence. The appendix
includes summary tables comparing the numbers and kinds of microfossils recovered
by site and feature, along with a detailed table for each site showing the types of
microfossils identified.

Chapters 14 and 15 are essentially expanded and updated versions of Chapters V and VI of
Andrew Laurence’s Ph.D. dissertation at Texas A&M University (Laurence 2013). From the
beginning of this collaboration between Prewitt and Associates and TAMU’s Archaeological-Ecology
Laboratory, the intent was for Laurence to use the Fort Hood field samples and microfossil data
in his anthropology dissertation research.

Environmental and archeological
background

Karl W. Kibler, Douglas K. Boyd, and Virginia L. Hatfield4

The Fort Hood military base encompasses some 340 square miles
(217,337 acres) in central Texas. The base just west of the Balcones Escarpment,
and its diverse environmental settings have attracted people for thousands of years.
From an archeological perspective, it is one of the most intensively surveyed areas
in the state, with more than 1,200 prehistoric sites recorded.
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING OF FORT HOOD
Fort Hood is in the Lampasas Cut Plain, the dissected northeastern edge of
the Edwards Plateau (Hill 1901) that is a subprovince of the Grand Prairie (Hayward
et al. 1996). The base is in a transitional zone from the more humid east to the semiarid west, and the environmental gradient is steep enough that changes in landscape
and vegetation are noticeable. Geologically, Fort Hood is located on lower Cretaceous
carbonate rocks, just west of the Balcones Fault Zone. No distinct escarpment exists
along the fault zone in the Fort Hood area, but soil and vegetation differences do
occur from the upper Cretaceous (Gulfian Series) rocks east of the fault zone to the
lower Cretaceous (Comanchean Series) rocks to the west (Abbott 1995:5).
Climate
The modern climate of the Fort Hood area is subtropical, characterized by
hot, humid summers and relatively short, dry winters (Natural Fibers Information
Center 1987:6). The prevailing wind blows from the south. Coryell County summer
temperatures are high, averaging 83º F (29.3ºC) overall and averaging 96º F (35.5ºC)
daily. The average winter temperature is 49ºF (9.4ºC) but is highly variable, with
periodic northern cold fronts creating significant fluctuations, from cold to mild
temperatures (McCaleb 1985:3). Coryell County annual precipitation is ca. 32.5
inches (826 mm), and rainfall occurs year-round with peaks in the late spring and
early fall (Natural Fibers Information Center 1987:121).

The environmental background in this chapter is derived from discussions by Karl W. Kibler
in Kleinbach et al. (1999:5–11) and Mehalchick et al. (2004:9–11). The Paluxy site archeological
background is derived from Mehalchick et al. (2004).

Flora and Fauna
The flora and fauna of Fort Hood are typical of the Balconian and Texan biotic
provinces (Blair 1950). The biotic assemblage is a mix of species from the Blackland
Prairie to the east and the Edwards Plateau to the west. Many specific ecological
niches exist across the base, depending on the local topography, slope aspect, soil,
and geology. Currently the eastern part is dominated by dense juniper and oak
forest; scrubland and more open areas characterize the western part. Grasslands are
prevalent on the intermediate upland surfaces, and high upland areas are covered
by juniper and oak scrub. Riparian zones with a variety of hardwood species are
common along drainages.
The Balconian faunal assemblage includes 57 species of mammals, with
eight of them also occurring in the Texan province to the east (Blair 1950:113, 101).
Other native fauna include 36 species of snakes, 15 anuran species, and 16 species
of lizards. In historic times, several prehistorically significant economic species, such
as bison and pronghorn antelope, were exterminated in central Texas.
Geology, Geomorphology, and Paluxy
deposits on Fort Hood
The Fort Hood landscape consists of the dissected northeastern margin of
the uplifted Edwards Plateau and reflects the variable resistances of the various
underlying geologic formations to erosion. Structurally, the area is underlain by
a deeply buried extension of the Paleozoic Ouachita Mountains, which divide the
stable continental interior to the west from the subsiding Gulf basin to the southeast.
During the Cretaceous Period, this region consisted of a very broad shelf covered
by a shallow sea. Limestone and marls were deposited on the shelf as the shoreline
fluctuated for more than 80 million years. Occasionally, relatively thin deposits of
sand derived from terrestrial sources also accumulated on the shelf, resulting in
interbedded formations like the Paluxy Formation and Trinity Sands. The Gulf Basin
subsided during the Miocene and the Balcones Fault Zone developed along the old
Ouachita line and the uplift of the Edwards Plateau (Woodruff and Abbott 1986).
West of the Balcones Fault, the Cretaceous limestone and marls remain relatively
horizontal and structurally unmodified but to the east the Cretaceous rocks dip
sharply toward the gulf and are buried deeply by Gulfian and later lithological units.
Because Fort Hood is west of the fault zone, relatively flat-lying lower
Cretaceous rocks showing a two-tiered topography called the Lampasas Cut Plain
underlie it (Haywart et al. 1996). This landscape developed between the Brazos
and Colorado Rivers and consists of large, mesa-like remnants of an early Tertiary
planation surface surrounded by a broad, rolling pediplain formed during the late
Tertiary and early Quaternary. These two surfaces differ by 25 to 40 m in elevation
and form the “high” and “intermediate” uplands of Hayware et al. (1996) and the
“Manning” and “Killeen” surfaces of Nordt (1992). Modern stream valleys are incised
ca. 40 to 70 m into the pediplain surface. Figure 2.1 is a generalized geological cross
section showing the buried and exposed formations that comprise the Lampassas

Cut Plain, showing the topographic relationships between the high Manning surface,
the middle Killeen surface, and the alluvial deposits of the modern drainages.
The oldest rocks exposed at Fort Hood belong to the lower Cretaceous Trinity
Group, which includes the Glen Rose Formation. This formation is surficially exposed
on the western side of Fort Hood, where relatively deep incision of the landscape by
Cowhouse Creek and its tributaries has removed the overlying rocks (Proctor et al.
1970; Sellards et al. 1932).
Resting on the Trinity Group are rocks of the lower Cretaceous Fredericksburg
Group. The lowest unit is the Paluxy Formation, a terrigenous siliclastic unit of
strandplain, fluvial, and deltaic deposits. The Walnut Clay, which is widely exposed
at Fort Hood and forms the principle substrate of the Killeen surface, overlies the
Paluxy Formation. Above the Walnut Clay lies the Comanche Peak Limestone, which
forms the intermediate slopes of the higher Manning surface. The highest extensive
lithological unit is the Edwards Limestone, which forms the resistant cap of the high
upland mesas or Manning surface. The Edwards Limestone is also a very important
source of high-quality chert (Frederick and Ringstaff 1994; Frederick et al. 1994).
Nordt (1992, 1993, 1995) identified six principal alluvial units in the study
area and examined the stratigraphy and soil geomorphology of several larger Fort
Hood streams in detail. From oldest to youngest, these units are termed Reserve
alluvium, Jackson alluvium, Georgetown alluvium, Fort Hood alluvium, West Range
alluvium, and Ford alluvium (Nordt 1992).
Environmental Setting of Paluxy Sites
Paluxy sites rest on the sandy deposits of the Paluxy Formation or are
encapsulated in late Quaternary colluvial and sheetwash sediments derived from
the Paluxy and overlying Walnut formations. These deposits and sediments occur

15

16

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

along the upper margins of Pleistocene valleys across the west-central portion of
Fort Hood, where the Paluxy Formation crops out below the Killeen surface. These
sandy deposits are pedogenically altered and form soil catenas across the sites that
vary according to differences in ages and local topography. These soils are typically
classified as Cisco and Wise series soils (McCaleb 1985). Cisco soils are Alfisols
with well-developed argillic horizons, and Wise soils are weakly developed sandy
Inceptisols.
Climax plant communities on the sandy Paluxy sediments vary from true
prairies consisting mainly of tall grasses to post oak–blackjack oak savannah of tall
and mid grasses (McCaleb 1985). The tallgrass prairies primarily consist of little
bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), big bluestem
(Andropogon gerardii), and Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), which are easily
disturbed by heavy grazing. Forbs and trees are minor components (<30 percent)
of this community but include Gayfeather (Liatris elegans), Engelmann’s daisy
(Engelmannia pinnatifida), Maximilian sunflower (Helianthus maximiliani),
American elm (Ulmus americana), common hackberry (Celtis occidentalis), and live
oak (Q. virginiana) (McCaleb 1985:38). Arboreal species of the post oak–blackjack
oak savannah include post oak (Q. stellata), blackjack oak (Q. marilandica),
American elm, Mexican plum (Prunus Mexicana), American beautyberry (Callicarpa
Americana), and hawthorn (Cretaegus sp.). The oak canopy shades approximately
20 percent of the ground. Grasses such as little bluestem, big bluestem, Indiangrass,
switchgrass, beaked panicum (Panicum anceps), purpletop tridens (Tridens flavus),
sand lovegrass (Eragrostis trichodes), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), and
Canada wildrye (Elymus Canadensis) make up 80 percent of the vegetative
community and are sensitive to overgrazing (McCalen 1985: 40). Kleinbach et al.
(1999: Table 86) present a detailed listing of vascular plants observed at Paluxy sites
on Fort Hood during the spring of 1997. Mehalchick et al. (2004:Table 9.3) compiled
a list of 36 species of geophytes that grow on Fort Hood, and many of these plants
have been observed on Paluxy sites (compare Table 86 in Kleinbach et al. 1999 with
Table 9.3 in Mehalchick et al. 2004).
Abbott and Trierweiler (1995) and Kibler’s (1999) studies of Paluxy sites
show that colluvial and sheetwash or rillwash deposition was and continues to be
important in forming these sites in a significant means of site burial. Throughout
the late Quaternary, the sandy deposits were subject to cycles of gully formation,
and erosion, deposition and soil formation.
Abbott and Trierweiler’s (1994a:475) interpretation of the chronostratigraphy
and pedology of Paluxy sites based on their observations at 41CV595 identified
three cycles or units of erosion, deposition, and pedogenesis. The most recent cycle,
Unit 3, dates to the late Holocene and characteristically consists of a thin mantle,
generally <20 cm thick (although deposits up to 180 cm thick may fill gullies cut
into the underlying unit) of very dark grayish brown loamy sandy to sandy loam
sediments. This sandy mantle typically displays an A horizon or, in thicker deposits,
an A-E soil profile. Weak k horizons also may form in thicker deposits. Unit 2 is a late
Pleistocene to early Holocene and is imprinted with a well-developed, yellowish red
sandy clay Bt horizon, which grades to reddish yellow to yellow sand to loamy sand

Chapter 2

BC horizon. This soil is almost always truncated, but intact profiles including the A
horizon have been observed buried on lower sections of the slope (Abbott 1994:329).
Unit 2 may rest on Unit 1 or unweathered Paluxy Formation sediments. Unit 1
is Pleistocene sediment imprinted with a reddish yellow to yellowish red loamy
sand and sand Bk-BC soil profile. Abbott and Trierweiler (1995) noted that further
investigations directed at dating the units were needed, as well as more data on the
natural processes (e.g., mode of deposition, bioturbation) involved in site formation.
In 1996, Kibler (1999) conducted a detailed geomorphic study of selected
locations to define the chronostratigraphy of Paluxy sites and to identify the
depositional processes responsible for their formation. Two stratigraphic units were
discerned at the observed Paluxy sites, Strata I and II. Stratum I is late Holocene
and contains all cultural features and artifacts found at Paluxy sites. Based on
radiocarbon assays, primarily of wood charcoal from buried cultural features,
Stratum I accumulated between ca. 3,500 and 500 b.p. at most Paluxy sites. Stratum I
is typically less than 50 cm thick, pinching out downslope, although Stratum I
sediments more than 100 cm thick filling erosional gullies are not uncommon. The
sediments are typically dark loamy sands to sandy loams imprinted with A, A-E,
or A-Bw soil profiles. The contact between Strata I and II is abrupt to very abrupt
and wavy.
The age of the lower Stratum II is not known, although it is fairly clear that it
was truncated by ca. 5000–4000 b.p. Because no in situ cultural materials or features
have ever been observed in preserved portions of Stratum II, it is believed that it
started to accumulate during the late Pleistocene. The top of Stratum II is marked
by a well-developed truncated Bt horizon. The Bt horizon is typically a sandy clay
loam and grades in color from more red hues (2.5YR and 5YR) to more brown hues
upslope. Soil structure also grades upslope from strong, medium to coarse blocky
peds to moderate blocky peds or weak, coarse prismatic peds breaking to moderate
blocky peds. The Bt horizon overlies a BC horizon, which is typically a sandy loam to
sandy clay loam with color and soil structure that vary topographically. Stratum II
typically rests directly on the Glen Rose limestone, although at a few sites a late
Pleistocene caliche was observed underlying Stratum II.
Deposition of these sediments appears to be dominated by surface flow in
the form of sheetwash or rillwash and raindrop impact. Mass wasting was also
probably an important depositional process in the early formation of many Paluxy
sites. Ultimately, however, two factors allowed a Paluxy site environment to form:
the thickness of the Paluxy Formation outcrop, which when undercut promotes
retreat of the Paluxy and Walnut Formations and formation of colluvial deposits,
and a low gradient of the more resistant Glen Rose limestone downslope, which
promotes accumulation of the colluvial sediments. These factors coexist throughout
the west-central portion of Fort Hood, primarily north of House Creek, south of Shell
and Manning Mountains, and west of West Range Road to the western boundary
of Fort Hood.
Paluxy sites on Fort Hood formed in areas where Paluxy Formation outcrops
were relatively thick, usually greater than 3 m, and occurred above low-gradient

17

Glen Rose limestone slopes. Kibler (1999) notes that many of the examined Paluxy
sites appear to be nothing more than an accumulation of redeposited Paluxy sands
and Walnut Formation sediments, though at some sites—particularly on the upper
slopes—it is conceivable that the sandy deposits are in fact a highly weathered but
intact Paluxy Formation sand. Regardless of how Paluxy sites formed, prehistoric
peoples used large pockets of well-drained sandy soils within vast areas dominated
by limestone bedrock because they provided an excellent setting for camping and
other activities.
summary of previous
archeological investigations
of paluxy sites on fort hood
Archeological investigations at Fort Hood began in 1977 and involved survey
and site inventory projects through the 1980s, followed by a decade and a half of
systematic testing and evaluation of prehistoric sites. For summaries of archeological
investigations in and around Fort Hood see Jackson (1994b), Trierweiler (1994a,
1994b, 1996), Trierweiler et al. (1995), and Mehalchick et al. (1999) and, for a broader
background of central Texas archeology, see Black (1989), Black et al. (1997), Collins
(1995), and Ellis et al. (1994). The definition and evaluation of Paluxy sites as a
discrete class of archeological localities began when Mariah Associates archeologists
recognized the correlation between the Paluxy-derived sandy sediments and
prehistoric occupations during their reconnaissance and shovel testing of 571 sites
on Fort Hood between 1991 and 1993 (Trierweiler 1994). The Mariah investigators
noted two things: (1) a concentration of prehistoric occupation sites on sand outcrops
derived from the Paluxy Formation; and (2) that these sand outcrops, with or without
archeological sites, occurred only in the western portion of the base as discontinuous
mantles of sands deposited on the upper Glen Rose limestones (Abbott 1994:329).
The reconnaissance study by Mariah defined Paluxy sites as locations containing
prehistoric occupation evidence embedded in the redeposited Paluxy sands, and
researchers inferred that the Paluxy substrate was being preferentially selected for
use as camping localities. Subsequent testing of numerous Paluxy sites reinforced
this idea (Abbott and Trierweiler 1995; Kleinbach et al. 1999; Mehalchick et al.
2004; Trierweiler 1996).
Previous investigations of Paluxy sites at Fort Hood document multiple
cultural components buried in late Holocene colluvial sediments that accumulated
between ca 3500 and 500 b.p. (Kleinbach et al. 1999). Radiocarbon assays provide an
age estimate for numerous cultural features and occupations, and the chronological
evidence indicates primary use of the Paluxy environment during the Late Archaic
and Late Prehistoric periods. Broad research questions center on why prehistoric
occupations are concentrated on the discontinuous islands of Paluxy sand and why
people transported and heated large quantities of limestone rock in these locatities
(Mehalchick et al. 2004:20–24, 194–198, 200–224).
Throughout the late Quaternary, sandy Paluxy deposits were subject to
cycles of gully formation and erosion, deposition, and soil formation. Abbott’s (1995)
and Kibler’s (1999) studies of Paluxy sites show that colluvial and sheetwash or

Chapter 2

rillwash deposition was and continues to be important in forming these sites and is
a significant means of site burial. Kibler (1999) also notes that at many Paluxy sites,
the deposition appears to be nothing more than an accumulation of late Quaternary
colluvial and sheetwash or rillwash sediments derived from the Paluxy Formation
outcrop. Depending on slope location, Stratum II deposits vary considerably. They
may rest on the Glen Rose limestone or on Paluxy sandstone. The Bt horizon that
marks the top of Stratum II is more readily preserved on the lower slopes of Paluxy
sites, where it is relatively thin and rests directly on the Glen Rose limestone or
sometimes on a late Pleistocene caliche. On upper slopes where Stratum II has
not been completely removed by erosion, the deposit is usually thicker, and the Bt
horizon overlies a BC horizon, which is typically brown (7.5YR and 10YR hues)
sandy loam to sandy clay loam. It is on the upper slopes that the truncated Bt or
Bt-BC soil of Stratum II rests on slightly weathered to unweathered sands of the
Paluxy Formation. In some cases, however, this soil does not represent a distinct
depositional unit at all but is imprinted on intact sediments of the Paluxy Formation.
The culmination of archeological investigations at Fort Hood documents
the unique Paluxy environment and the intentional selection of Paluxy sand
accumulations as habitation spots by prehistoric peoples (Abbott 1995; Mehalchick
et al. 2004; Short et al. 2014:111–125; Trierweiler 1994). The unusual presence of
large pockets of well-drained sandy soils within vast areas dominated by limestone
bedrock, which were far from major drainages, afforded prehistoric populations a
camp location close to several subsistence resources. These sandy pockets may have
also supported a distinctive floral community that offered abundant subsistence
resources not necessarily found in other settings on Fort Hood. Prehistoric peoples
probably intentionally targeted the Paluxy environmental setting (Abbott 1995:816).
The presence of burned rock features within sandy deposits where limestone does
not occur on the surface also demonstrates that occupants purposefully selected the
Paluxy substrate, since that location involved additional physical labor to transport
the amount of rock used to the sites (Abbott 1995:816).
The argument that people intentionally selected the Paluxy sands is
supported by the number of Paluxy sites documented within Fort Hood compared to
the area Paluxy sands comprise within Fort Hood. Although the Paluxy Formation
sands make up a small portion of the Fort Hood landscape, estimated to be between
1 and 4 percent, these sheets of redeposited sand embed far more archeological sites
than would be randomly distributed. Comparing all prehistoric sites with burned
rocks and lithic artifacts recorded in both Bell and Coryell County within Fort
Hood (n = 403), Paluxy sites make up 10 percent (n = 37) of the sites. The fact that
10 percent of the sites occur on 4 percent of the area is statistically significant. This
is based on a chi square analysis comparing 37 Paluxy sites expected to occur on
4 percent of the area with 366 non-Paluxy sites expected to occur on 96 percent of
the area. The chi-squared value equals 28.172 with 1 degree of freedom. The twotailed P value is less than 0.0001, which by convention is considered to be extremely
statistically significant. If sites were equally distributed, the number of expected
Paluxy sites on 4 percent of the area would be 16.2 compared to the 37 actually

19

20

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

observed. The number of expected non-Paluxy sites on 96 percent of the area would
be 386.88, and only 366 were observed.
After removing sites in alluvial settings, Paluxy sites make up 15 percent of
the sites in upland settings (32 out of 216). The chi-squared value equals 65.790 with
1 degree of freedom. The two-tailed P value is 0.0001. This difference is considered
to be statistically significant, and the high percentage of upland Paluxy sites is
not random. If sites were equally distributed, we would expect 4 percent of land
comprising the Paluxy Formation landscape to have only 8.64 Paluxy sites, whereas
32 where observed. We would expect the non-Paluxy landscape to contain 207.36
sites, but only 184 were observed. The site distribution indicates that prehistoric
people were undoubtedly selecting the outcrops of Paluxy sand as favored camping
areas. Since the actual amount of Fort Hood area covered by Paluxy sands may
be closer to 1 percent than 4 percent, it means that the selection of Paluxy sand
localities was prominent indeed.
Abbott (1994, 1995) proposed three hypotheses explaining why prehistoric
people purposefully chose the Paluxy setting. The first hypothesis states that there
is a unique or concentrated plant food or fuel resource in the Paluxy environment.
The second and third hypotheses focus on the substrate, suggesting that the sandy
soil provided drainage of runoff and that the sediments and naturally occurring
gullies allowed for easier preparation of cooking pits. Another possibility is that
the sandy substrate was more amenable for their methods of house construction
(Mehalchick et al. 2004:210–211). Although these hypotheses are not mutually
exclusive, investigations thus far primarily support the first hypothesis (Boyd
et al. 2004; Kleinbach et al. 1999:387–392). The current evidence from Paluxy sites
indicates that plant resources were the primary focus of subsistence activities at
these localities (Boyd et al. 2000:34–37; Boyd et al. 2004:211–224). Abbott (1994,
1995), Boyd et al. (2000), and Mehalchick et al. (2004) have all suggested that unique
plant resources, especially geophytes, were clustered in and around Paluxy sites but
were absent or in diminished quantities in other locations (e.g., riparian settings),
making these locales attractive to foragers. Fragments of bulbs and corms (USOs)
recovered from Paluxy sites lend more credence to this model. In accordance with
this model, exploitation of such resources and occupation of these sites would be
periodic and highly seasonal. If the activities at Paluxy localities centered on plant
gathering and processing, the stone tools and cooking features should reflect this
behavior and may be significantly different from campsites in other parts of the
landscape.
Yet another factor that must be figured into this equation is the availability
of firewood. For all sites with large burned rock features, especially mounds and
middens, the availability of firewood was an important consideration. In a landscape
analysis looking at the distribution of resources across Fort Hood, Kibler has recently
argued that there is a strong correlation between stands of hardwood trees and the
Paluxy sands. He suggests that the availability of self-pruning arboreal species,
most notably post oaks, was a critical attraction drawing people to the Paluxy
environment (Boyd et al. 2014:111–125).

Chapter 2

Based on a comparison of artifact assemblages recovered from testing 23
Paluxy sites on Fort Hood, Abbott (1995:821) concluded that Paluxy sites were
not distinct from other sites in the Fort Hood area. This conclusion was based on
a comparison of the density of lithic artifacts per level. Boyd et al. (2000:34–36)
demonstrated that Paluxy cultural assemblages can be separated into sites with high
and low artifact density, which may reflect differences in overall occupation intensity
or indicate differential site function. High-density assemblages may correspond to
multifunctional campsites, which would exhibit a high degree of diversity. Lowdensity assemblages would be less variable, reflecting fewer activities and perhaps
indicating specialized site function (Boyd et al. 2000). Very little prior research
has supported any interpretations of Paluxy site function based on comprehensive
analyses of artifact assemblages (e.g., Abbott 1995; Boyd et al. 2000; Kleinbach
et al. 1999), but this is due primarily to the limited excavation areas and the small
samples of stone tools recovered from most Paluxy sites.
The recovery and analysis of charred botanical remains provides more clues
about the floral community on and in the vicinity of the Paluxy Formation during
prehistoric times. To date, the ethnobotanical analysis of charcoal and processed
flotation samples retrieved from Paluxy sites has identified 22 wood taxa (Mehalchick
et al. 2004:Table 9.1). Some typically riparian hardwoods—e.g., ash, pecan, sycamore,
walnut, and willow—would flourish along moist stream bottoms situated downslope
from the Paluxy sites. The Paluxy sediments would have supported post oaks—the
hallmark of the Cross Timbers region—which still grow on most Paluxy sites. The
thin soils on upland limestone surfaces and slopes support xerophytic flora such as
juniper, persimmon, sumac, and some oaks. Oak wood is the most common taxon
represented in the Paluxy site samples, and Dering (1998:1,629–1,630) has stated
that “both oak and juniper are preferred fuel…and preserve well and are easily
identified, even in a very deteriorated state.” However, investigations at the Firebreak
site (41CV1553) produced a minimal amount of juniper wood, suggesting juniper
was not as widespread or densely populated across the prehistoric landscape as it
is today (Mehalchick et al. 2004:204).
The PAI investigations at the Firebreak site in 2000 specifically targeted the
excavation of earth oven features and the recovery of geophytic plants from sediment
flotation. Two of the charred geophytes found in the Firebreak site earth ovens are
eastern camas (Camassia scilloides) and wild onion (Allium drummundii), and both
have been found at many other prehistoric sites in central Texas (Mehalchick et al.
2004:Table 8.18, Figure 9.4). The preferred growing conditions for eastern camas
and wild onion are similar. Both prefer full sun to part shade in open areas and
thrive in calcareous prairie soils but can tolerate sandy conditions or moderately
alkaline soils such as those common in Coryell County (Cheatham and Johnston
1995; McCaleb 1985). Eastern camas and wild onion have been observed on limestone
surfaces and sandy to chalky slopes in limited quantities; however, several large
patches of eastern camas have been noted in moist swales and bottomlands in
Texas (Boyd et al. 2004:205; Cheatham and Johnston 2000:521). It is important to
remember that modern distributions of wild onions and eastern camas in Texas do
not reflect prehistoric distributions. These plants were undoubtedly more common in

21

22

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

prehistoric and early historic times, and they were nearly extirpated when historic
Euro-Americans came to central Texas. Boyd et al. (2004:217–218) note that the
three main factors in the decline of geophytes are the decimation of native prairie
habitat due to cultivation, control of wildfires that promote native prairie vegetation,
and the widespread abundance of pigs across the historic landscape.
On Fort Hood, earth ovens are a common feature at Paluxy sites indeed,
but they are not restricted to Paluxy sites by any means. Earth ovens are reported
at upland burned rock mounds such as the Tank Destroyer site (Boyd et al. 2014).
Many of the large “slab-lined hearths” found within the burned rock middens on
Fort Hood are likely to be earth ovens. Such features have been found at within
middens at 41CV1133 and 41CV1269 (Kleinbach et al. 1999:209) and at the Clear
Creek Golf Course site (Mehalchick et al. 2002:39–43). In these and many other
cases all across central Texas, earth oven features probably represent the widespread
use of generalized pit baking technology for the mass processing of geophytes (see
Boyd et al. 2004:Table 8.18, Figure 9.4). As noted by Black and Thoms (2014:222),
the recognition that many features previously called rock hearths and rock-lined
hearths probably functioned as earth ovens is significant, and it changes the way
we view prehistoric plant use across the entire central Texas landscape.
Our ultimate understanding of Paluxy sites on Fort Hood, as well as
many other central Texas sites containing burned rock features, must involve
reconstructing the human utilization of many different plant species. Consequently,
the continued recovery and identification of charred macrobotanical remains from
cultural features is extremely important. Macrobotanical remains provide important
data for reconstructing past environments and landscape utilization, and up till now
have constituted the primary evidence for plant use strategies by prehistoric huntergatherers. However, as we attempt to unravel the details of subsistence strategies,
residential mobility, and resource and landscape use by prehistoric peoples, we
must also look deeper and begin to search for, recover, and examine many different
forms of plant microfossils.

Research Goals, work accomplished,
and methods of investigation

Douglas K. Boyd and Karl W. Kibler

This report describes the archeological investigations at seven prehistoric
archeological sites on the Fort Hood military reservation in central Texas. All of the
investigated sites are in Coryell County, and the work was done for the Cultural
Resources Management Program (CRM), United States Army Fort Hood. The field
investigations were accomplished in two phases with different research objectives
and excavation methodologies. The Phase I work involved limited excavations
using rather standard techniques (e.g., site grids and contiguous excavation units)
to gather additional site information for selected Paluxy sites. The Phase I work
was also planned as a pilot study aimed at investigating certain types of burned
rock features to obtain samples of plant remains associated with various hot
rocks cooking technologies, including earth oven cooking. The Phase II work field
investigations were more targeted, with the goal being quick and efficient use of
machine excavations to identify burned rock features, followed by limited hand
excavations of selected features (often exposing features only in profile). Once
exposed, features were intensively sampled to recover sediments and burned rocks
containing macrobotanical plant remains and plant microfossils. The Phase II work
targeted features that appeared to be earth ovens whenever possible, and the field
investigations were designed to limit the amount of hand labor involved while
maximizing the potential information return.
Table 3.1 summarizes the archeological investigations at the seven sites
where intensive feature investigations occurred, along with minor investigations
at a few other sites. The remainder of this chapter describes the research goals that
drove these investigations, the specific details of the two phases of investigations
at the Paluxy and alluvial sites, and the laboratory processes and data analysis
methods used in the studies of the plant remains from these features.
research goals
Most of the archeological sites investigated for this project are classified as
Paluxy sites. In the Fort Hood site classification scheme, these are open campsites (no
evidence of structures has been found yet) on the redeposited sands on and downslope
of Paluxy sandstone outcrops in the western portion of Fort Hood. Situated on the
midslopes of the Killeen surface, halfway between the creeks and the high uplands,

Chapter 3

weathered outcrops of Paluxy sand were enticing locations for prehistoric peoples
looking for good camping spots. These locations supported groves of hardwood trees
for shade and firewood, the sands were easy to dig into and well drained during wet
weather, and the locations were conveniently located for people moving back and
forth exploiting riverine and upland resources.
This archeological project came about because the Fort Hood CRM program
intended to mitigate for impacts that had occurred to the Paluxy sites over many
years due to military training activities and accelerated erosion. In the process,
the significance and National Register eligibility of each investigated site was
reevaluated while undertaking feature-oriented archeological research.
The goal of understanding Paluxy sites and the people who lived in these
locations is important, for sure, but this project was really about something both
much simpler and grander in scale than the Paluxy Formation outcrops on Fort
Hood. This project was about pushing the envelope in scientific research to find
new ways to learn about plant foods that were important to prehistoric peoples,
and the ways that central Texas hunter-gatherers used limestone rocks as heating
elements to cook those foods. In simplest terms, the research for this project can be
summed up as an attempt to understand earth oven cooking features by focusing
on feature morphology and the recovery of associated plant remains, particularly
plant microfossils.
For more than a century, archeologists have been interested in finding
and studying burned rock features in central Texas, focusing first on the large
accumulations of fire-cracked rock that we call middens or mounds (the latter being
isolated concentrations that are generally dome shaped). Investigations on Fort
Hood and elsewhere have led us to the conclusion that most of the fire-cracked rock
found in some middens and mounds accumulated as a result of repeated cooking
episodes involving the use of underground earth ovens. We know from ethnographic
documentation and the archeological findings in central Texas that prehistoric
peoples most often used earth ovens to cook plant foods rather than animals. We
also know from ethnography, archeology, and experimentation that earth ovens
were commonly used to cook certain types of root foods—the underground storage
organs from geophytes—that had to be cooked slowly over long periods to render
them palatable and transform the nutrients into digestible form. Many researchers
now believe that some of the geophytes that have been found in prehistoric ovens in
central Texas were probably superabundant plants that were food staples for many
prehistoric hunter-gatherers. These staple foods most likely included the eastern
camas and wild onion, but the bulbs and tubers of many other plants we have yet to
identify may have been equally important. There is no doubt that we have learned
a great deal about prehistoric cooking techniques and plant use through targeted
research, but we must always be looking for new ways to learn more.
Much of the current research on central Texas hunter-gatherer populations
is now focused squarely on, and rightfully so, gathering all types of evidence that
can inform us about earth oven cooking. This evidence must include the physical
remains of the plants themselves, regardless of the various forms they may take—

25

26

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

charred remains, pollen, starch grains, phytoliths, or biochemical traces. We need
to be able to identify all the various plants that were heated in earth ovens, and to
distinguish the plants used as food from those used as fuel or incidental packing
material. We need to understand the intricacies of cooking inside a subterranean
earth oven and what happens to all the plant parts during cooking. We need to
know how the macroscopic and microscopic plant parts behave inside the earth
oven from the initial heating to the final opening, and then we need to understand
what postdepositional actions may alter these features over hundreds of years and
millennia.
The laboratory and analytical studies undertaken for this project were an
attempt to focus on the kinds of archeobotanical research mentioned above. We
believe we were successful in making progress in some areas and failed in others (see
Chapter 16). Researchers may find fault with a particular method or interpretation
in the chapters that follow, but one thing is certain: our findings indicate that there
is much to be learned by the careful archeological examination of burned rock
features coupled with intensive sampling and analyses of associated plant remains.
Phase I Investigations
The Phase I field investigations took place in 2009–­2010, and they included
intensive work at three Paluxy sites—41CV984, 41CV1049, and 41CV1553—along
with targeted feature investigations in alluvial deposits at 41CV1657. These
sites were selected for investigation by the Fort Hood CRM program manager in
consultation with Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (PAI) archeologists.
Minor exploratory investigations were undertaken at two other Paluxy
sites—41CV1027 and 41CV1391—to evaluate their potentials as candidates for
feature investigations and microfossil sampling. Site 41CV1027 was originally
investigated by TRC Mariah Associates in 1992 and 1993 (Abbott and Trieweiler
1995:543–551). In Test Pit 3, they found Feature 2, a burned rock concentration
consisting of large limestone slabs, from 10 to 60 cm below surface (Abbott and
Trierwieler 1995:548, Figures 6.92 and 6.93, Table 6.128). PAI archeologists returned
to the site in May 2010, re-located the old Test Pit 3, and hand-excavated the backfill
inside it to reexamine Feature 2. The unit walls were cleaned and examined, but
the burned rock concentration was found to be somewhat sparse, and there was
no hint of organic sediment staining or charocal. Because of this, along with heavy
vegetation that limited backhoe access, 41CV1027 was ruled out as a candidate for
feature investigations and microfossil sampling.
Site 41CV1391 was originally investigated by TRC Mariah Associates in
1993, and the Paluxy component of the site was designated Subarea C (and Analysis
Unit 2) (Abbott and Trieweiler 1995:642–652). A burned rock “midden” was exposed
in a road cut, and four 1x1-m test pits were dug in or near this feature. Test Pit 2,
excavated in the north-central portion of the midden, revealed an “internal hearth”
(called Feature 2) at 35–53 cm below surface. The investigators estimated the
midden to be 17–20 m long by 8–12 m wide (this oval shape suggests that is may
be a buried burned rock mound). PAI archeologists returned to the site on March 6,

Chapter 3

2012, to test the midden to determine if it contained subfeatures that might warrant
archeological investigation and microfossil sampling. The work included excavation
of two backhoe trenches in the northern portion of Feature 1. Backhoe Trench 1 (ca.
4 m long) was dug north-south in the northeast quadrant of the midden. Backhoe
Trench 2 was excavated north-south and extended for about 15 m across the northern
half of Feature 1. Trench 2 was intentionally placed in the general area where Test
Pits 2 and 3 should be located, with the hope of re-locating the Feature 2 internal
hearth. The two trenches formed an L, but they did not intersect. No evidence of
any internal features was found within the exposed midden deposits, and no hint
of Feature 2 was found. Consequently, 41CV1391 was ruled out as a candidate for
burned rock feature investigations and microfossil sampling.
The investigations at 41CV1027 and 41CV1391 were limited in scope and
confined to relatively small areas. As such, the previous assessments of these sites as
being eligible for listing in the National Register remain unchanged. The previously
defined site boundaries also remain unchanged for these sites. The archeological
investigations at 41CV1027 and 41CV1391 are not described further in this report.
Phase II Investigations
The Phase II archeological feature investigations occurred in 2011–­2012 at
four sites. Three of the investigated locations are Paluxy sites: 41CV594, 41CV947,
and 41CV1553 (the latter being selected for additional work following the Phase I
investigations). The other is an open campsite in an alluvial setting, and it was
selected for different reasons. Site 41CV1104 was selected to find out more about
burned rock features exposed in a tank trail because this site area might be impacted
by future construction of a permanent tank trail crossing of Cowhouse Creek. This
site was ideal for Phase II investigation because the burned rock features were
already exposed, so feature documentation and microfossil sampling would be
relatively easy. Like 41CV1657 investigated during Phase I, 41CV1104 was chosen
for ease of sampling, and it provided another opportunity to collect microfossil
samples from burned rock features in alluvial settings to provide a contrast with
the sampled features in the Paluxy sands.
Also during Phase II, one other Paluxy site was revisited. In October and
November 2011, two backhoe trenches were excavated at 41CV478 to search for
buried burned rock features that might be suitable for microfossil sampling. The
trenches were located in tank trails where burned rocks were exposed. No buried
features were discovered, so 41CV478 was ruled out as a candidate for microfossil
sampling. The investigation at 41CV478 was limited in scope and confined to a small
area. As such, the previous assessment of this site as being eligible for listing in the
National Register remains unchanged. The previously defined site boundary also
remains unchanged. The archeological investigation at 41CV478 is not described
further in this report.

Field Methods
The field methods used to take microfossil samples (including burned rocks,
artifacts, and sediment) are described in detail in Chapter 11. This section describes
the standard methods used in the archeological excavations and documentation of
sites and cultural features. The field methods employed during Phase I and Phase II
were essentially the same, but varied somewhat from site to site. Specific details
are described in each site chapter (see Chapters 4 to 8).
Mechanical excavations at all of the sites were done with a backhoe and
operators provided by the Directorate of Public Works at Fort Hood. Shovels
and trowels were used to clean the trench walls to search for and expose buried
archeological remains. In addition to the vertical trenching, the backhoe was used
for shallow horizontal scraping over broad areas at some sites (e.g., 41CV594 and
41CV947).
When burned rock features were encountered, hand excavations were used
to expose the remains. In many cases, exposures were limited to a vertical profile
so that sediment (flotation) and microfossil samples could be extracted from the
feature cross section. In other cases, features were exposed horizontally using
standard excavation units, and the sediment and microfossil samples were taken
from among and below selected feature rocks.
During Phase I and Phase II, site mapping was done using a Sokkia total
data station (TDS). This included mapping of site topography and natural drainages,
modern man-made features and disturbances (e.g., roads, tank trails, and artificial
drainages), locations of all mechanical and hand excavations, and the locations of
all archeological features. In addition, the TDS was used to map location of each
feature-associated microfossil sample.
laboratory and analytical methods
The laboratory methods used for the microfossil sample preparation and
analyses (including burned rocks, artifacts, and sediment) are described in detail
in Chapter 11. For all other archeological materials recovered from the Phase I and
Phase II investigations, standard laboratory procedures were used. All stone artifacts
were washed and dried, and each provenience was assigned a lot number. For each
site, the artifact classification and basic descriptive analysis followed the same
general methods as used by PAI in 1990s and 2000s. These analytical methods are
described in detail by Mehalchick et al. 2004:29–36, and they will not be repeated
here. An inventory of recovered artifacts was created for each site.
All sediment flotation samples were processed at the PAI laboratory using a
Flote-Tech flotation system to separate samples into heavy and light fractions. For
each processed sample, the heavy fraction was examined, and all artifacts larger than
1/4 inch were removed and cataloged, while the light fraction was sent to Dr. Leslie
Bush for macrobotanical analysis. The methods and results of the macrobotanical
analyses are discussed in Appendix B).

Chapter 3

The investigations recovered modest samples of artifacts from three sites—
41CV984, 41CV1049, and 41CV1553 (see Table 3.1). In contrast, the limited, featureoriented excavations at the other sites produced only small samples of artifacts.
The investigations recovered 10 temporally diagnostic projectile points from the six
investigated sites, and the attributes of these points are summarized in Table 3.2.
The more complete specimens are illustrated in Figure 3.1.
RADIOCARBON DATES
Thirty-four radiocarbon dates have been obtained for seven sites discussed
in this report, as summarized in Table 3.3. All of the dated samples are charred
organic materials, and all were assayed by Beta Analytic, Inc. This table includes
13 radiocarbon assays that were run by other investigators during previous projects
as well as 21 dates that were obtained for this project. The number of dates by site

Dissemination of microfossil studies findings
This technical report presents the findings of the archeobotanical studies at
seven sites investigated on Fort Hood between 2009 and 2012 as part of a federally
funded CRM project. As such, this report meets the primary obligations required
of CRM investigations conducted under federal regulations, and this report will be
distributed in electronic format by the CRM program at Fort Hood. However, the
project team did not consider this technical report alone to be sufficient for spreading
the results of this work and the important findings of the microfossil studies to
the widest possible audience. Consequently, the Texas A&M University (TAMU)
team members made a substantial effort to disseminate the results of the plant
microfossil studies to the larger archeological and ethnobotanical communities by
publishing articles in peer-reviewed professional journals. Three articles have been
published to date:
“Airborne Starch Granules as a Potential Contamination Source
at Archaeological Sites.” Andrew R. Laurence, Alston V. Thoms,
Vaughn M. Bryant, and Cassandra McDonough, 2011. Journal of
Ethnobiology (312):213–232.
“Baking Geophytes and Tracking Microfossils: Taphonomic
Implications for Earth-Oven and Paleodietary Research.” Alston V.

NOTES ON TERMINOLOGY
In this report, we use the terms “burned rocks” and “fire-cracked rocks”
(FCR) interchangeably, with both terms identifying limestone rocks that display
various characteristics of thermal alteration. These terms encompass a wide
range of attributes that vary from slight discoloration (i.e., minimal darkening or
reddening of the rock surface or interior) with little or no heat-related cracking to
intense discoloration (dark black or red interior) with angular thermal fracturing.
The terms “burned rocks” and “burned rock features” are used most commonly in
Chapters 3 through 8 describing the site investigations. In Chapters 9 through 16,
the TAMU researchers use the terms FCR and FCR features most commonly in
describing earth oven cooking, the microfossil analyses, and data interpretations.
In the feature typology described in Chapter 9, all features that are not classified
as earth ovens are called by the generic name FCR concentrations.
The analysis of plant starch microfossils was a major research focus for this
project. Throughout this report we use the terms starch “grain” and starch “granule”
interchangeably.
national register site ASSESSMENTS
The overall investigations included work at ten prehistoric sites completed
between 2009 and 2012 for the Fort Hood CRM program. Of these, eight are
classified as Paluxy sites and two are open campsites in alluvial settings. The level
of investigations varied considerably, ranging from digging out an old test unit
and no new excavations at one site to complete excavation (18 hand-dug units and
limited mechanical scraping) of a small burned rock mound discovered in a GPR
survey. While one of the investigated sites was newly discovered (41CV1657), the
other nine sites had seen some level of archeological testing and been previously
assessed as eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. As
summarized in Table 3.4, research potential and National Register eligibility is
reassessed for these nine previously investigated sites and assessed for the first
time for the tenth site.

Phase I Investigations at 41CV984

Karl W. Kibler, Douglas K. Boyd, and Virginia L. Hatfield

SITE SETTING
Site 41CV984 is on a gentle northwest-facing slope just south of an unnamed
tributary of Cottonwood Creek (Figure 4.1). The site lies east of a major tank trail
and just west of Old Georgetown Road. The road easement along the eastern site
boundary is cleared of large vegetation and has been excavated to form a U-shaped
drainage ditch parallel to the road. Two-track ruts are the only visible disturbances
in some portions of the site area. Site vegetation includes mesquite, persimmon,
juniper, and post oak trees, as well as grasses, forbs, and cacti. The site is 270 m
(886 ft) above mean sea level.
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Mesrobian and Kooren of Texas A&M University recorded the site in 1986
and estimated it to be 50 m north-south by 25 m east-west. They recorded a 10-m
diameter burned rock mound surrounded by a scatter of burned rocks and lithic
artifacts. A Martindale dart point (initially identified as a Frio) was collected during
these investigations. The investigators estimated that road construction, vehicular
traffic, and erosion had impacted 67 percent of the site.
Turpin and Frederick of Mariah Associates revisited the site in 1992 and
expanded the site dimensions to 90 m north-south by 70 m east-west based on the
extent of the landform and observed surface artifacts. They described an A-R soil
profile across the site that was less than 30 cm thick, though two small remnants
of an argillic (Bt) horizon also were observed. The A horizon was described as a
dark brown sandy material and appeared to be weathered from the Paluxy sand
exposed upslope from the site. Turpin and Frederick noted that the burned rock
mound (Feature 1) had been significantly impacted by vehicular traffic and erosion,
but a second burned rock concentration or midden (Feature 2) appeared to be intact.
Shovel probes did not exceed 30 cm, but a lack of additional exposures precluded
a full evaluation of the context of the cultural materials, which they thought to be
shallowly buried. Given these factors, shovel testing was recommended.
Shovel testing at the site occurred later in 1992. Seven shovel tests were
excavated, but only two—both placed on features—yielded cultural materials. One

shovel test placed over Feature 1 encountered abundant burned rocks at 0–15 cm,
while a shovel test in Feature 2 encountered a high density of burned rocks at
0–50 cm and five flakes at 0–30 cm. Shovel testing demonstrated the presence of
buried cultural deposits, particularly associated with Feature 2. The site was deemed

Chapter 4

potentially eligible for National Register listing and was recommended for testing
(Trierweiler, ed. 1994:A1130–A1132).
Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (PAI) conducted test excavations at 41CV984
in 1996 (see Figure 4.1), and the investigations are reported by Kleinbach et al.
(1999:65–71). The two previously recorded burned rock features (Features 1 and 2)
were re-located and recorded, and then five 1x1 m test units (Test Units 1–5) were
dug, for a total of 2.6 m3 of hand-excavated fill. The test units ranged in depth from
30 to 60 cm below the surface. The investigations redefined the site boundary as 90 m
north-south by 80 m east-west. Stratigraphy at the site consisted of a thin A-2Bt
soil profile imprinted on a late Holocene sandy deposit above a late Pleistocene/
Holocene rubified sandy clay loam. All excavations terminated on or in the Bt horizon
or on the underlying weathered limestone bedrock. Excavations recovered 1 dart
point barb fragment, 5 bifaces, 4 unifaces, 1 burin or graver, 2 expedient flake tools,
and 401 pieces of debitage (Kleinbach et al. 1999:69). An Ellis point was collected
from surface. Investigators noted that the burned rock mound designated Feature
1, had been significantly disturbed by vehicular traffic, erosion, and deflation and
was virtually destroyed. Three test units sampled Feature 2, which was found
to be a spatially discrete, domed burned rock mound resting on a truncated late
Pleistocene/Holocene surface and partially buried in Paluxy-derived late Holocene
sands (Kleinbach et al. 1999:68–70). No central depression was visible in this feature,
which had a maximum thickness of nearly 60 cm. Excavations produced 3,976 burned
rocks weighing 744 kg and recovered 146 flakes, 4 bifaces, and 1 edge-modified flake.
Charcoal recovered from Feature 2 yielded a radiocarbon age of 2750±40 b.p.
An additional radiocarbon age of 1130±80 b.p. was obtained on charcoal recovered
from a nonfeature context (see Table 3.3). Other chronological evidence recovered
from the site included the dart point barb fragment and the burin, which was
fashioned from a Zephyr dart point. In all, the chronological data indicated that the
site was occupied and Feature 2 was constructed and used by the middle of the Late
Archaic period. The recovery of a Zephyr dart point—recycled into a burin—along the
margin of Feature 2 suggested that the feature was still in use by the latter portion
of the Late Archaic. The more recent radiocarbon age (1130±80 b.p.) suggested a later
occupation during the Austin phase of the Late Prehistoric Period, but the context
of the charcoal is unclear and this date represents an unknown cultural event.
Although no internal pits or earth ovens were encountered in Feature
2, the test units were placed north and south of the center of the mound. Given
the size and integrity of the mound, Kleinbach et al. (1999:70–71) thought that
potential for finding internal cooking features was high. No macrobotanical remains
were recovered from the mound, but Kleinbach et al. (1999:70) noted the relative
high frequency of cultural materials recovered from the margins of the feature,
suggesting spatially discrete site activities occurring around the feature. Given this,
the integrity of Feature 2, and the recovery of charcoal, albeit low, for dating and
taxa identification purposes, Kleinbach et al. (1999:71) suggested that the research
potential at 41CV984 was high and that it be recommended as eligible for listing
in the National Register.

CURRENT INVESTIGATIONS
The current investigations at 41CV984 took place during Phase I in two
separate field sessions. The initial work in March and May 2009 began with a remote
sensing survey using ground-penetrating radar (GPR). For the GPR survey, a 40x20m grid and was established on the site with the long axis aligned to magnetic north.
All subsequent archeological investigations occurred within this survey block (Figure
4.2). Numerous GPR anomalies were identified (see Appendix A), and three were
investigated by archeologists through shovel testing. Additional hand excavations
consisted of three shovel tests placed in nonanomaly areas within the GPR block and
two 1x1-m test units placed at two locations where shovel tests of GPR anomalies
yielded evidence of possible features. A steel rebar was set in concrete to serve as a
permanent site datum point, and the site was mapped with a Sokkia total station.
GPR Anomaly A (see Figure A.1) represented a large buried feature, and
it clearly corresponded with the location of burned rock mound Feature 2. Three
other GPR anomalies were selected for shovel testing. Shovel Test 1 was excavated
at the location of Anomaly C, and Shovel Test 2 was placed at the location of
Anomaly B, both of which were identified by Osburn as “areas of interest” (see
Figure A.1). Shovel Test 3 was placed in the south-central part of the GPR grid, at
the location of a large anomaly that appeared deeper but was not identified as an
area of interest (see GPR slices 5 through 9 in Figure A.1). Each shovel test was ca.
40 cm in diameter and ranged in depth from 15 to 30 cm below the ground surface.
Shovel Test 1, excavated over Anomaly C, encountered a burned rock cluster and
6 flakes at 0–20 cm below the surface. The shovel test was terminated at 20 cm on
top of the burned rock cluster. Shovel Test 2 encountered a burned rock cluster and
1 flake in the area of Anomaly B at 0–15 cm below the surface. This shovel test was
terminated at 15 cm on top of the burned rock cluster. Shovel Test 3 encountered
three small burned rocks and two flakes, but no definable feature was identified
and the excavation was terminated at 30 cm below the surface, in the Bt horizon.
Three additional shovel tests (STs 4–6) were excavated in areas where the
GPR did not detect any anomalies. These shovel tests were ca. 40 cm in diameter
and ranged from 30 to 35 cm in depth, terminating in the Bt horizon. None of these
randomly placed shovel tests encountered a burned rock feature or isolated burned
rocks, although each yielded some lithic debitage.
The two test units were excavated over the burned rock clusters identified in
Shovel Tests 1 and 2. Test Unit 6 was placed over Shovel Test 1 and GPR Anomaly
C, and it exposed Feature 3, a cluster of burned rocks that is probably a disturbed
hearth. This test unit was excavated to 20 cm below the surface. Test Unit 7 was
placed over Shovel Test 2 and GPR Anomaly B, and it exposed an undulating layer
of weathered limestone bedrock between 21 and 31 cm deep. The absence of a burned
rock feature suggests that Anomaly B was caused by naturally occurring shallow
bedrock (Figure 4.3).
The second field session, conducted between May 18 and 28, 2010, focused
on Feature 2, the partially buried burned rock mound (see Figure 4.2). A 4.0-m long
(north-south) by 0.5-m wide (east-west) trench was dug in the center of the mound

area between the earlier test units. The trench was divided into two equal parts,
each 2 m long, and these were designated Test Unit 8 on the north and Test Unit
9 on the south. These two units were excavated together as a single trench to see
if the mound contained a central cooking pit and, if it did, to collect samples that
might yield charred macrobotanical remains and plant microfossils.
The test units excavated in 1996, which were on the northern and southern
margins of the mound, were re-located (see Kleinbach et al. 1999:Figure 16).
The southern edge of Test Unit 1, which was excavated in 1996 (Kleinbach
et al. 1999:65–71), was encountered in the northern end of Test Unit 8. A jumble of
rocks with sharpie marks was found in Level 1 of Test Unit 9; these undoubtedly
were removed from one or more of the 1996 test units and piled on the surface.
Test Units 8 and 9 encountered the top of a large burned rock feature in Level
2, and it was designated Feature 4. Hand excavation of the Feature 4 continued in
10-cm levels down to 90 cm below surface. At each level, the burned rocks in the
bottom of the trench were mapped in place, and the rocks were counted and weighed
as each level was removed. The trench exposed large amounts of in situ feature rocks

Chapter 4

in Levels 2–9, with the majority of Feature being in Test Unit 9. It quickly became
clear that the Feature 4 was a complex feature with stratified layers of burned rocks.
SEDIMENTS AND STRATIGRAPHY
Kibler described the sediments and stratigraphy at 41CV984 in Kleinbach
et al. (1999:66–67) based on test unit profiles exposed during the 1996 investigations.
These profiles revealed a late Quaternary mantle of sandy sediments derived from
upslope exposures of Paluxy sandstone overlying the Glen Rose limestone. The
late Quaternary unit varied in thickness and pedogenic expression among the test
unit profiles, but in general consisted of a late Holocene sandy deposit overlying a
truncated late Pleistocene/Holocene argillic horizon. The late Holocene unit was 10 to
40 cm thick and typically consisted of a very dark grayish brown to a very dark gray
sandy loam A horizon, which in places also exhibited an anthropogenic component
in the form of densely packed burned rocks. The A horizon corresponds to Kibler’s
(1999:51) Stratum I, which he estimates to be 3,500 to 500 years old, and contains
all of the cultural materials recovered at 41CV984 except the cultural features that
intrude into the underlying soil. The underlying truncated late Pleistocene/Holocene
soil consisted of a yellowish red to reddish brown sandy clay loam 2Bt horizon.
Cultural Features
The burned rock mound (Feature 2) and two smaller burned rock features
(Features 3 and 4) were investigated and are described in this section.
Feature 2
Feature 2, the most prominent cultural feature at the site, is a burned rock
mound. At the times of the site investigations, the mound was covered with small
vegetation, and the surface topography clearly indicates that it is a roughly circular
mound about 12 m in diameter (Figure 4.4). The mound accumulated on ground that
slopes naturally to the west and south, and the burned rock deposits vary from 10
to 60 cm thick. The slope and limited testing, however, make it difficult to determine
the average thickness of the mound or estimate the total volume of burned rock
matrix. The mound accumulated on ground that slopes naturally to the west and
south, and the burned rock deposits vary from 10 to 60 cm thick. The slope and
limited testing, however, make it difficult to determine the average thickness of the
mound or estimate the total volume of burned rock matrix.
Feature 3
Feature 3 is a possible remnant of a burned rock hearth first identified in
the GPR survey as Anomaly 1. This anomaly was initially evaluated with a shovel
test that recovered a few burned rocks at about 9 cm below the ground surface.
Test Unit 6 was excavated to further expose and define the feature. Feature 3 is
86 cm (north-south) by 85 cm (east-west) and extends from 9 to 20 cm below surface
(Figure 4.5). It is comprised of two concentrations of burned limestone—one in the
central to east-central part of the unit and the other in the southwest part. Both

clusters are composed of some large tabular rocks or cobbles and many smaller
angular fragments. Some of the cobbles in the southwestern cluster were fractured
in place. The tabular rocks probably represent the base or original location of the
hearth, whereas the smaller and more dispersed rocks represent scattered remnants

of the feature.

Figure 4.5. Plan view of Feature 3 exposed at 20 cm below surface in Test Unit 6 at 41CV984. View is to the
north, and the north arrow is 20 cm long.

The burned rock clusters that defined the feature consist of 39 rocks. They
weigh 9.0 kg and were left in situ. Many smaller burned rocks were removed from
the test unit while exposing the feature, and they were most likely associated with
the feature. They consist of 35 angular rocks from 0–10 cm below surface that weigh
3.5 kg, along with 32 angular rocks (4.0 kg) from 10–20 cm. Thus, the total weight
of the Feature 3 rocks is 16.5 kg. One edge-modified flake and 93 pieces of debitage
were recovered from Test Unit 6. A flotation sample taken from the feature yielded
a small piece of charred oak (Quercus sp.) (see Appendix A). Three burned rocks
from the feature were collected as plant microfossil samples.

Feature 4
Feature 4 is a large earth oven located within the Feature 2 burned rock
mound (see Figure 4.4). It was exposed in Test Units 8 and 9, which together formed
a 4-m-long trench (Figures 4.6 and 4.7). The top of Feature 4 was exposed at 12 cm
below the surface, and its base was at 82 cm below the surface, with the bottom of
the feature resting on the top of the Bt horizon. This feature is 150 cm north-south
at its top. Its east-west dimension is unknown, but it was exposed in both the east
and west walls of the 50-cm-wide trench. Based on this trench exposure and the
fact that Feature 4 is a central pit within a circular burned rock mound, it is likely
that it is roughly circular with a diameter of 150 cm. If so, then Test Units 8 and
9 sampled the middle portion of the feature. Allowing for slight variations in the
size and shape of Feature 4, it is estimated that the excavated portion represents
between one-third and one-fifth of the
total feature.

Because the cross-section trench (Test Units 8 and 9) was only 50 cm wide,
it was too narrow to do detailed mapping of the profiles from inside the trench
(see Figures 4.6 and 4.7), but the profiles were examined closely. In addition, all
of the rocks exposed in the trench bottom were mapped with a total station before

they were removed, and the data were used to create a schematic cross section of
the trench. These rocks clearly form multiple layers that have a distinctive basin
shape. Figure 4.8 is a schematic profile that hypothesizes at least three, perhaps
four, basin-shaped rock layers that probably represent remnants of the earth oven
heating elements. Each layer contains flat-lying rocks in the middle and inclined
rocks extending higher on the north and south edges. The stratigraphic evidence
includes some well-preserved organic layers in between the major rock layers,
suggesting that rockless oven pits were created within Feature 4. The radiocarbon
evidence supports this hypothesis of multiple-use episodes.
During the excavation, all of the burned rocks in Level 1 and many in Level 2
were not considered to be part of Feature 4. In contrast, 316 burned rocks weighing
238.8 kg were removed from Levels 2–9 and are interpreted as being associated
with the Feature 4 earth oven. The burned rock data are summarized in Table
4.1, and Figure 4.9 compares the frequency of Feature 4 burned rocks (weight) by
excavation level and rock size category. It is notable that largest burned rock class
(i.e., those over 15 cm in maximum dimension) accounts for the plurality of burned
rocks in all eight levels and the majority in six of the eight levels. The larger in
situ specimens were mostly tabular rocks that were lying flat or angled as part of
a recognizable slab-lined basin.
Two charcoal samples were submitted for radiocarbon assays. A sample
collected from the upper part of the feature in Level 4 yielded a conventional
radiocarbon age of 1910±40 b.p. (Beta-281900), with a 2-sigma calibrated range
a.d. 10–210. The second sample was from the base of the feature in Level 9, and it
yielded a conventional radiocarbon age of 2440±40 b.p. (Beta-281901) and a 2-sigma
calibrated range 760–400 b.c. (see Table 3.3). Flotation of sediment samples from
the Feature 4 earth oven yielded charred inulin-rich bulbs (camas and wild onions)
and a charred unidentified tuber fragments. In addition, burned rocks extracted
from Feature 4 were processed for microfossils and yielded significant numbers of
starch granules that most likely came from a starch-rich plant, such as the tubers
of groundnut and prairie turnip. These burned rocks and microfossil samples and
results are discussed in more detail later in this report (see Chapters 9 and 15).
CulturAL MaterialS
Chipped stone artifacts were recovered from each shovel test and all of the
test units (Table 4.2). The only tools with this assemblage include an untypeable
dart point fragment from Test Unit 7 (see Table 3.3) and one edge-modified flake
from Test Unit 6. The remaining chipped stone artifacts consist of 153 pieces of
unmodified debitage, most of which were recovered from Test Unit 6. Although
someflakes were recovered in Test Units 8 and 9 and were spatially associated with
Feature 4, they probably have no functional association with any of the earth oven
cooking episodes.
Burned rocks from feature and nonfeature contexts were recovered from the
test units. A total of 106 burned rocks weighing 16.5 kg were recovered from Test
Unit 6 (see Table 4.2). Of these, 39 burned rocks weighing 9.0 kg were defined as

* FCR data for some levels is underrepresented because the microfossil sample rocks are excluded. The total number of excluded microfossil sample rocks
is 42 as follows: 8 in Level 2; 5 in Level 4; 7 in Level 5; 7 in Level 6; 8 in Level 7; and 7 in Level 9.
** FCR in the < 5 cm category were weighed but not counted.
*** A cluster of FCR in Level 1 of Test Unit 9 had rocks marked with sharpie arrow by archeologists during the 1999 excavations. These rocks were out of
context and were excluded from the counts and weights. Nuts and bolts found in Level 1 indicate some modern disturbance.

Feature 3. Only seven burned rocks (weighing less than 0.1 kg) were recovered from
Test Unit 7, and these were from a nonfeature context. The largest concentration
of burned rocks was in Test Units 8 and 9, and most of these rocks were associated
with the Feature 4 and its multiple earth oven use episodes (see Table 4.1).
SUMMARY OF 41CV984 investigations
The investigations at 41CV984 focused on testing GPR anomalies and
excavating the central portion of the burned rock mound. The GPR survey had good
results in detecting burned rock cultural features. One anomaly was determined to
be shallowly buried burned rocks over noncultural bedrock, another turned out to
be a small burned rock feature, possibly a disturbed hearth (Feature 3), and a third
anomaly was linked to scattered burned rocks but no definable features. The GPR
survey was successful in revealing some of the internal structure of the burned rock
mound; the Feature 2 area appeared as a ring of high-intensity anomalies around
a large central void (see Appendix A). Excavations revealed that this void was the
central cooking pit within the burned rock mound. In contrast, each of the three
shovel tests placed in areas devoid of GPR anomalies yielded no burned rocks at all.
The 41CV984 investigations demonstrate that Feature 2 is a classic central
Texas burned rock mound. It is roughly circular, and its surface topography indicates

* This investigation recovered 173 stone artifacts. The 1996 testing recovered 415 stone artifacts (as reported by Kleinbach et al. 1999:Table 11). This
brings the total number of prehistoric artifacts recovered from all site testing (excluding the 1986 survey and 1992 shovel testing) to 588 specimens.
** Historic or modern items recovered from Level 1 of Test Units 8 and 9 consist of 3 iron nuts, 1 iron bolt fragment with nut attached, and 1 iron piece
(probably part of an ammo clip).

it is about 12 m in diameter, although the horizontal dimensions are not confirmed
through testing. Although the upper portion (ca. 20 cm) of this feature has been
disturbed to some extent by modern army activities and vehicle traffic, the central
portion of this mound proved to be surprisingly intact.
Within the mound, Feature 4 is interpreted as a central earth oven, and the
presence of stratified layers of large slabs forming basin-shaped layers indicates
that it was used multiple times (see Figure 4.8). It is unclear exactly how many
use episodes may be represented, but two radiocarbon assays shed light on the age
of this earth oven. The calibrated date on charcoal from Level 9 indicates that one
of the earlier cooking events occurred at around 760–400 b.c. This date does not
necessarily represent the earliest cooking event associated with the mound because
the central earth oven could have been cleaned out to its deepest point and relined
multiple times. The second calibrated radiocarbon date indicates a cooking event
that occurred some 400 to 970 years later at around a.d. 10–210. This dated sample
came from Level 4 and is associated with the upper earth oven heating element, so
this date might represent one of the latest cooking episodes (perhaps the last one)
that occurred. Taken together, these two dates indicate use episodes that occurred
some 410 to 970 years apart.
A third calibrated radiocarbon date of 915–830 b.c. was obtained on charcoal
recovered from the general burned rock matrix of Feature 2 just north of Feature 4
(sample recovered from Test Unit 1 in 1996). This date suggests that the formation
of the burned rock mound could have begun between 70 and 515 years before the
earlier date from Feature 4 suggests. Collectively, the three dates suggest that the
burned rock mound was used as a cooking facility with intermittent construction
and use of the central earth oven over a period of at least 840 years, and possibly
as much as 1,125 years.
NATIONAL REGISTER ASSESSMENT of 41cV984
It is recommended that 41CV984 remains eligible for listing on the National
Register of Historic Places. Only a portion of the Feature 2 burned rock mound
has been archeologically investigated, and over half of the Feature 4 central earth
oven within it remains intact. The recovery of datable and interpretable botanical
remains, including macrobotanical and microfossil evidence, from the central earth
oven indicates that it still has a high research potential. The potential for finding
other buried burned rock features elsewhere across the site is high. The previously
defined site boundary for 41CV984 remains unchanged.

Investigations at 41CV1049

Karl W. Kibler, Virginia L. Hatfield, Gemma Mehalchick, and Douglas K. Boyd

SITE SETTING
Site 41CV1049 is a Paluxy site on a northeast-facing slope west of Cottonwood
Creek and south of an unnamed tributary of Cottonwood Creek. The site has been
significantly impacted by erosion and tank trails that crisscross the surface. Site
vegetation consists of grasses and forbs, with some arboreal species, including oaks,
elms, junipers, and mesquites. The site is ca. 275 m (902 ft) above mean sea level.
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
The previous investigations discussed in this section are derived from
information provided by Mehalchick in Kleinbach et al. (1999:83–85). Dureka and
Strychalski (Texas A&M University) first recorded the site on May 22, 1985, and
estimated its size as measuring 270x140 m. They recorded burned rock scatters
and a burned rock mound and recovered lithic artifacts. Among the lithic artifacts
were two Ensor and one Darl dart points, as well as a piece of modified limestone.
They concluded that erosion, vehicular traffic, and military activity had disturbed
75 percent of the site.
Mehalchick and Abbott (Mariah Associates) revisited the site on December 9,
1992. They revised the site dimensions to 200x120 m based on the exposed cultural
materials. They noted that the site is on a gentle slope of the Killeen surface with
exposures of Paluxy sand and Glen Rose limestone. In the middle of the Paluxy
outcrop, they observed a thick bed of limestone interbedded with fine sands. Based on
geomorphic context and archeological potential, they divided the site into Subareas
A and B. Subarea B was downslope from the Paluxy sands and underlain by the
Glen Rose limestone. This area was severely eroded with no in situ deposits, thin
slopewash sands in a few areas, and sparse burned rocks on the surface. Mehalchick
and Abbott recommended no further work for Subarea B given the lack of potential
for intact cultural deposits.
Subarea A incorporated the Paluxy sands, including the interbedded
limestone. Mehalchick and Abbott identified a thin (less than 50 cm) weathered
Paluxy sand deposit imprinted with a dark brown loamy fine sand (A horizon) over
a reddish brown clayey fine sand (Bt horizon). This soil, which contained cultural
57

58

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

materials, was underlain by a thin, discontinuous weakly laminar calcrete (K horizon)
that rested on saprolitic bedrock containing large, soft concretions of carbonate. In
many areas, they noted a 10–15-cm-thick mantle of brown fine slopewash sands
overlaying the soil. Vehicular traffic had caused severe localized erosion.
Sparse to moderate cultural materials were recovered from the 1992
investigations. Some mussel shells and a high density of burned rocks were
scattered across Subarea A. Mehalchick and Abbott identified five burned rock
features exposed in tank trails. Several were recorded as burned rock concentrations,
including Feature 1 (8x2 m), Feature 2 (7x5.5 m), and Feature 3 (3x2 m). Feature
4 was a possible hearth measuring 1x0.5 m. These four features occurred within
a 40-m radius near the south-central portion of the site. Feature 5 was a burned
rock concentration (measuring 3x1 m) exposed along a tank trail along the westcentral portion of Subarea A. Mehalchick and Abbott recommended shovel testing
in Subarea A.
Fourteen shovel tests were placed in Subarea A, with eight yielding cultural
materials 0–40 cm below the surface. Shovel testing conducted around Features, 1, 2,
and 4 suggested that only Feature 1 might have contained intact cultural deposits.
Shovel testing also encountered an additional feature (Feature 6), a concentration
of burned rocks between 20 and 40 cm in the south-central portion of the site. A
Pedernales projectile point was recovered from the surface during this phase of work.
Researchers concluded that Subarea A had potential for intact cultural deposits
and should be tested to determine its eligibility for listing in the National Register
(Trierweiler 1994:A1198–A1200).
In 1996, Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (PAI) visited Subarea A of the site and
re-located the features (Kleinbach et al. 1999:83–90) (Figure 5.1). They determined
that Features 4 and 5 remained in the same condition as initially recorded. Features
1, 2, and 3, exposed in a tank trail, were redefined as a single larger burned rock
scatter and designated Feature 1. Three backhoe trenches and four 1x1 m test
units were excavated. The backhoe trench excavations revealed burned rocks and
artifacts in the upper 40 cm in Backhoe Trench 1, a probable hearth between 40
and 60 cm (Feature 7) in Backhoe Trench 2, and no cultural materials or features
in Backhoe Trench 3. Test Units 1 and 2 were excavated over Feature 7, adjacent
to Backhoe Trench 2. Test Unit 3 was placed next to a tank trail where a lens of
burned rocks, part of Feature 1, was exposed. Test Unit 4 was excavated in the
vicinity of Feature 6.
Cultural materials were recovered from all four test units. A Scallorn arrow
point, 31 pieces of unmodified debitage, one core, two edge-modified flakes, one
spokeshave, and one vertebrate bone fragment came from Test Units 1 and 2. Also
recovered from these two units and associated with Feature 7 were 688 burned
rocks (61.75 kg). Most of the cultural materials were recovered from the upper
30 cm above Feature 7. Test Unit 3, which sampled Feature 1, contained 90 (18.0 kg)
small burned rocks, 44 pieces of debitage, one late-stage/finished biface, one core, a
reworked Pedernales dart point, and a Darl dart point. Level 1 of this test unit also
contained barbed wire and rubber, suggesting mixed deposits in the upper 10 cm.

Figure 5.1. Map of 41CV1049 depicting 1996 test excavations in Subarea A. Map is from Kleinbach et al.
(1999:Figure 26).

Test Unit 4, placed near Feature 6, contained a single flake from between 70 and
80 cm below the surface.
Cultural features defined in the 1996 testing investigations included Feature
1, which was redefined as a burned rock scatter measuring 25x17 m. Within Feature
1 and exposed in an adjacent tank trail, Feature 1A was identified as a discrete
hearth in Test Unit 3. This hearth had two burned rock layers comprised of ca. 100
burned rocks weighing 79.5 kg. Half of the rocks were tabular limestone slabs, and

59

60

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

the rest were angular fist-sized pieces. Eighteen flakes and a multifunctional tool
were recovered from Feature 1. Charcoal yielded a radiocarbon age of 1,600±100 b.p.
(2-sigma calibrated date range of a.d. 380–590; see Table 3.3). Feature 7 was defined
as a basin-shaped hearth in Test Units 1 and 2 and consisted of three layers of 136
burned rocks weighing 78.5 kg. The maximum excavated dimensions of Feature
7 were 135x50 cm, though the complete hearth was estimated to have been 1.8 m
in diameter. Half of the rocks were large tabular pieces, while the remainder were
fist-sized and smaller angular rocks. Cultural materials recovered from Feature 7
included a single flake and charred Quercus sp. (oak), which yielded a radiocarbon
age of 1,590±50 b.p. (2-sigma calibrated date range of a.d. 420–550; see Table 3.3).
The test excavations defined Subarea A as measuring 130 m northwestsoutheast by 80 m northeast-southwest. In this subarea, investigators determined
that there were discrete features and artifacts buried within late Holocene sandy
sediments derived from the Paluxy Formation up to 80 cm below the surface. The site
was occupied between the latter part of the Late Archaic and the Late Prehistoric
period, based on the radiocarbon age and diagnostic artifacts, although discrete
deposits or features could not be attributed to the later occupations (Kleinbach
et al. 1996:90). Despite that, a number of charred macrobotanical remains were
recovered and identified as fuel and potential food resources. The preservation of
these materials, along with a diverse artifact assemblage associated with intact
features, rendered the site significant, and thus it was recommended as eligible for
listing in the National Register.
Current Investigations
The current investigations at 41CV1049 took place in April to June 2009
(Figure 5.2). These investigations began with a GPR survey. A 25x12-m survey grid
was established over the site and oriented 30 degrees from magnetic north (see
Appendix A). Test excavations occurred from May 19 to June 2, 2009, and included
the excavation of six shovel tests. Shovel Tests 1–3 were placed over GPR Anomalies
C, B, and A, respectively (see Figure A.3), but no burned rocks were encountered.
These shovel tests ranged in depth from 40 to 50 cm below the surface. Three other
shovel tests (Shovel Tests 4–6) were placed in areas where no GPR anomalies were
present, though Shovel Tests 4 and 5 were placed just outside the GPR survey grid.
Shovel Test 4 was excavated to 30 cm below the surface and a few small burned
rocks were recovered. Shovel Test 5 was excavated to 18 cm below the surface and
terminated on a dense cluster of burned rocks. Shovel Test 6 was excavated to 20 cm
below the surface. Five flakes were recovered, but no burned rocks or burned rock
features were encountered.
After shovel testing, test units were laid out based on the recovery from the
shovel tests. Test Unit 5 was excavated to further investigate the cluster of burned
rocks in Shovel Test 4 and encountered Feature 8. Test Unit 6 was excavated in
the area of Shovel Test 5 to further evaluate the burned rock cluster in that shovel
test and encountered a general scatter of burned rocks. Test Unit 7 was placed next
to Test Unit 5 to further investigate Feature 8. Test Unit 8 was placed adjacent
to Test Unit 6 to further evaluate the scatter of burned rocks in Test Unit 6. The

scatter of burned rocks became Feature 9, and below this feature in the third
levels of Test Units 6 and 8, Feature 10 was encountered. Scatters of burned rocks
appeared to extend beyond the walls of these four test units, so six more test units
were placed between Test Units 5 and 7 and Test Units 6 and 8, resulting in a block
excavation measuring 2x5 m. The six test units (Test Units 9–14) were excavated
simultaneously and revealed a continuous scatter of burned rocks across the block,
but no new discrete features were encountered. All of these test units were excavated
to 30–40 cm below the surface, terminating at or near the underlying Bt horizon.
Sediments and Stratigraphy
As part of the previous investigation of 41CV1049 in 1996, Kibler examined
two backhoe trench profiles and described the sediments and stratigraphy at the
site (Kleinbach et al. 1999:85–86). The profiles revealed an intact Paluxy sandstone
substrate with an overlying mantle of weathered colluvium and slopewash that
thickened downslope. This mantle consists of late Pleistocene to late Holocene sandy
sediments and is imprinted with an A-2Bt soil profile, which thickens downslope
where it exhibits an A-2Bt-2K soil profile. The A horizon consists of dark grayish
brown loamy fine sand corresponds to Kibler’s (1999:51) Stratum I identified at
other Paluxy sites, which he estimates to be 3,500 to 500 years old. Shovel test
and test unit excavations revealed that it is 30–40 cm thick and contains all of the
cultural materials and features at the site. The underlying 2Bt horizon represents a
truncated late Pleistocene/Holocene soil consisting of a yellowish brown sandy clay
loam with common sandstone fragments. The 2K horizon consists of a pale yellow
to brownish yellow laminated caliche with thin beds of yellowish red clay.
Cultural Features
Feature 8 was exposed in the southwest corner of Test Unit 7 and southeast
corner of Test Unit 5 (Figure 5.3). It consists of a small cluster of tabular to blocky
burned rocks. The feature measures 66 cm east-west by 50 cm north-south and ranges
from 15 to 31 cm below the surface. There was no charcoal and no observable pit
or basin associated with the feature. Feature 8 consists of a single layer of burned
rocks (n = 27, weighing 17.9 kg). These are mostly small rocks, with 13 specimens
5–10 cm in maximum dimension and 14 less than 5 cm. Most of the rocks were lying
flat, with only a few rocks randomly inclined. Four pieces of debitage and pieces of
burned clay were recovered from the feature fill through excavation and flotation.
Recovered charred macrobotanical remains consists of oak wood (Quercus sp.)
fragments (see Appendix B). One piece of charred oak wood yielded a radiocarbon
age of 1,490±40 b.p. (2-sigma calibrated range of a.d. 450–640; see Table 3.3). One
rock from the eastern half of the feature was collected for starch grain analysis.
Feature 9 is a burned rock hearth in the southwestern corner of Test Unit 8
(Figure 5.4). It is 64 cm north-south by 38 cm east-west and extends from the surface
to a depth of 18 cm. The feature continues to the west, as is evidenced by burned
rocks on the surface. The feature consists of 56 burned rocks, weighing 6.0 kg. All of
the rocks are less than 10 cm in maximum dimension, with most of them between
5 and 10 cm. A groundstone tool and 30 flakes were recovered from the feature

through excavation and flotation. No charcoal or organic staining or evidence of a
pit or basin was observed during excavation. This feature may represent the outer
edge of a much larger feature exposed in the nearby jeep trail or it could be a discrete
hearth within the larger scatter of Feature 1. One charred but indeterminate wood
fragment was recovered from the feature. Three burned rocks were recovered for
starch grain analysis.
Feature 10 is a burned rock feature in the southeastern corner of Test Unit 8
and southwestern corner of Test Unit 6 (Figure 5.5). It is 70 cm north-south by 84 cm
east-west and extends from 18 cm to 33 cm below the ground surface. The feature was
not identified during the excavation of Test Unit 6 since there was a general scatter
of burned rocks throughout the unit at the same elevation. A more concentrated
cluster of burned rocks was present along the west wall extending about 20 cm into
Test Unit 6. Occasional charcoal, burned clay, and small patches of discolored soil
were associated with the cluster of burned rocks in Test Unit 6, though this was not
recognized or designated a feature until the adjacent Test Unit 8 was excavated.
The feature did not extend to the south in Test Units 13 and 14. Based on the fairly
discrete concentration of burned rocks in Test Units 6 and 8, the feature appears
to be the remains of a hearth. Fifty-eight flakes were recovered from the feature
fill through excavation and flotation. There are 76 (6.1 kg) burned rocks associated
with this feature, of which only 11 are between 5­–10 cm in maximum dimension.

arrow scale is 20-cm long.

The remaining rocks are less than 5 cm. Recovered charred macrobotanical remains
consist of pieces of oak (Quercus sp.), live oak (Q. fusiformis), white oak (Quercus
subg. Quercus), a flat sedge tuber (Cyperus sp.) fragment, and an indeterminate bulb
scale (see Appendix B). A piece of charred oak wood yielded a radiocarbon age of
1,900±40 b.p. (2-sigma range a.d. 20–220; see Table 3.3). Three burned rocks were
recovered from Test Unit 8 for starch grain analysis.
In addition to the three features described above, the 10 test units of the
excavation block (Test Units 5–14) yielded a scatter of 2,034 burned rocks weighing
144.2 kg from nonfeature contexts that probably reflects a general occupation zone
(Figure 5.6). The distribution of this burned rock scatter roughly correlates with the
area of Feature 1, as observed in previous investigations. Alternatively, Features 8–10
may represent the remains of earth ovens and the surrounding burned rock scatter
may represent dispersed heating-element debris discarded from these earth ovens.
Macrobotanical remains were also recovered among the burned rock scatter
within the block excavations (see Appendix B). From Test Unit 5, between 30 and
40 cm, charred plant remains consisted of fragments of oak wood (Quercus sp.),
indeterminate wood, indeterminate bulb scale and tuber fragments, and other
indeterminate plant fragments. Charred remains recovered from 20–30 cm in Test

Unit 6 consisted of fragments of oak wood (Quercus sp.). Charred plant remains
consisting of live oak (Q. fusiformis) fragments were recovered between 30 and
40 cm in Test Unit 11.
Cultural Materials
Artifacts and other cultural materials were recovered from every shovel test
and test unit at 41CV1049 (Table 5.1), and these materials were analyzed by John
E. Dockall. The artifact assemblage consists of 3 dart points, 7 biface fragments, 5
edge-modified flake tools, 3 cores, 1,066 pieces of unmodified debitage, and 2 ground
and battered stone tools. Some historic and modern debris, a fence staple, a square
nail, and miscellaneous pieces of metal and rubber, was encountered during current
excavations in the upper levels of the some test units. This indicates some degree
of mixing in this area of the site. Razor wire was also noted on the surface, east of
the block excavation. Disturbances to the site sediments mixing of the deposits are
most likely due to military vehicle traffic and temporary military encampments.
Three dart points were recovered from Test Units 6, 12, and 14 (see Table
3.2 and Figure 3.1c). The specimen from Test Unit 12 is a complete, but heavily
resharpened Darl dart point. The stem has a concave base with slightly concave

and expanding lateral edges
that are alternately beveled. The
presence of alternate beveling
on the stem edges suggests that
it may be the Mahomet variant
of Darl point (Prewitt 1981:82,
Figure 4). The blade edges are
straight but slightly beveled
from resharpening. The lithic
material is a gray to cream
chert. The specimen from Test
Unit 6 is a medial fragment of a
small corner-notched dart point
that could not be typed. Much of
the stem, a portion of the blade,
and the distal end are missing.
The remaining blade edges are
beveled from resharpening. The
raw material is a dark gray
brown, fine-grained chert. The
specimen from Test Unit 14 is
a longitudinal basal fragment
consisting of a portion of the
stem and barbed shoulder of a
corner-notched dart point. The
stem is expanding and exhibits a
concave base. The raw material
is a grayish brown chert. The
specimen is too fragmentary to
assign it to an established type.

summary of interpretations for 41cv1049
The combined chronological evidence from 41CV1049 reveals the most
intensive occupations occurred in the Late Archaic period. The four radiocarbon
assays from the site (see Table 3.3) are all on charred plant remains associated with
burned rock features, and they have yielded the following conventional radiocarbon
ages and 2-sigma calibrated dates:

*This investigation recovered 1,086 stone artifacts. The 1996 testing recovered 108 stone artifacts (as reported by Kleinbach et al. 1999:Table 13). This
brings the total number of recovered from all site testing (excluding the 1985 survey and 1992 shovel testing) to 1,194 specimens.

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

Collectively, these dates indicate occupations that occurred between a.d. 20–
640, in the terminal end of the Late Archaic. At a minimum, these four dates would
suggest at least two different occupation episodes at 41CV1049, with one being early
(Feature 10 in the first two hundred years a.d.) and the more intensive occupation
occurring around a.d. 500. As a cautionary note, however, four is a small number
of dates for any prehistoric site, and our perception of the total time span of the
occupations might well be increase if more radiocarbon assays were run.
The temporally diagnostic artifacts seem to support the radiocarbon age
assessment. From all phases of work, the projectile points recovered from 41CV1049
are:
1985 Survey
1992 Shovel Testing
1996 Testing
2009 Excavations

1 Darl and 2 Ensors (surface)
1 Pedernales (surface)
1 Darl, 1 reworked Pedernales, and 1 Scallorn arrow point
1 Darl and 2 untyped corner-notched dart points

With the exception of the Pedernales and the Scallorn, the other seven points
are consistent and certainly could date between a.d. 20 and 640. Pedernales dart
points are generally associated with occupations earlier in the Late Archaic period,
at around 1550–550 b.c. (3,500–2,500 b.p.) according to Collins (1995:Table 2, 384).
But one of the Pedernales specimens is reworked and the other is a surface find from
an unknown part of the site (somewhere in Subarea A). While some researchers place
the beginning of the Late Prehistoric period at around a.d. 800 (Collins 1995:Table
2, 385), Scallorn arrow points often appear in terminal Archaic sites and there may
have been a significant period of dart point and arrow point overlap.
As Paluxy sites go, 41CV1049 is fairly typical in terms of the dating of
occupations and the diagnostic projectile points. Using data current through 2004,
11 of 16 Paluxy sites with radiocarbon dates have occupations that definitely or
possibly fall into the terminal end of the Late Archaic period between a.d. 1 and
800 (as summarized by Boyd et al. 2004:Figure 9.6). Out of 83 projectile points
recovered from 20 Paluxy sites, the most common point styles are (in descending
order): Ensor (n = 25); Darl (n = 18); Pedernales (n = 10); and Scallorn (n = 7) (Boyd
et al. 2004:Table 9.2, Figure 9.7). Collectively, these four types account for 72 percent
of all typeable projectile points found on Paluxy sites.
NATIONAL REGISTER ASSESSMENT of 41CV1049
It is recommended that 41CV1049 remains eligible for listing on the National
Register of Historic Places. The tested portion of the site, a 2x5-m block, recovered
data from three burned rock features within a larger burned rock scatter. This
small area of the site has been fully mitigated, but the remainder of the site has a
high research potential because it may contain intact buried features and material
culture. The previously defined site boundary for 41CV1049 remains unchanged.

Chapter 6: Phase I and Phase II
Investigations at 41CV1553

Karl W. Kibler, Virginia L. Hatfield, and Douglas K. Boyd

SITE SETTING
Site 41CV1553 is on a colluvial slope and an alluvial terrace of an unnamed
tributary of Stampede Creek. A scarp at the interface of the Killeen surface and the
colluvial slope marks the northern boundary of the site, and the southern boundary
is largely marked by the unnamed tributary. The Paluxy Formation crops out
below the scarp and sands derived from this formation form a thick pedogenically
altered deposit that mantles much of the colluvial slope. Eastern and western site
boundaries are discerned by the extent of these sands, which merge downslope
with loamy alluvial sediments. Vegetation in the area consists of grasses, cacti,
and forbs, as well as post oaks, cedar elms, hackberries, junipers, and mesquites.
Two tank trails or roads cut across the site. The elevation of the site is 262–268 m
(860–880 ft) above mean sea level.
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Discovery and Shovel Testing
Frederick and Quigg (Mariah Associates) discovered the site during a
reconnaissance survey in February 1992. Following its discovery, Kimball Smith
(Fort Hood staff archeologist) visited the site and collected an untyped dart point.
Frederick and Mehalchick (Mariah Associates) returned to the site in March 1993
to record it and documented its size as 50x260 m. Cultural materials were observed
on the surface and included burned rocks, flakes, cores, and chipped stone tools.
The investigators observed that portions of the site had more than a meter of
sandy to loamy sediments on which an A-AB-Bt-R to an A-Bt-R soil was imprinted.
Cultural materials were restricted to the A and AB horizons (Mehalchick, Killian
et al. 2003:202–205).
Several burned rock scatters and one burned rock midden (designated
Feature 1) were exposed in the two trails that crossed the site. Feature 1 was observed
in the tank trail near the eastern site boundary. It measured 6 m north-south by
3 m east-west. Most of the burned rocks were less than 5 cm in size, and blackstained sediments along the southern edge of the feature were exposed in the road
cut. A Frio and a Martindale dart point were recovered from the surface of the site.

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

Frederick and Mehalchick noted that about 30 percent of the site had been disturbed
by vehicular traffic, erosion, and vegetation clearing, but they recommended shovel
testing to further evaluate the site.
Shovel testing occurred in March 1993 (Mehalchick, Killian et al. 2003:205;
Trierweiler, ed. 1994:A1571–1572). Twenty-three shovel tests were excavated to
depths of 30–60 cm, with most terminating at 40 cm. Only one shovel test placed
near Feature 1 yielded cultural materials. The investigation also resulted in the
documentation of Feature 2, which consisted of a surface concentration of burned
rocks and flakes just south of the unnamed tributary. Despite the poor shovel tests
results, the investigators noted that the potential for intact cultural deposits of
below the level of shovel testing. Because of this, it was recommended that the site
be tested to determine National Register eligibility.
National Register Testing
Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (PAI) conducted National Register eligibility
test excavations in September 1999 (Mehalchick, Killian et al. 2003:202–214).
Features 1 and 2 were re-located. Feature 1 appeared unchanged since it was
initially recorded. Downslope from Feature 1, archeologists noted a lens of cultural
materials at 20–30 cm along both sides of the road cut. In the same road cut, 90–95 m
upslope from Feature 1, burned rocks and debitage were visible at 10–20 cm below
the surface. These materials were beyond the northern site boundary previously
established by Mariah Associates’ archeologists. Feature 2, a severely deflated burned
rock concentration on the downslope margin of an eroded toeslope on the south side
of the unnamed tributary, measured 5 m in diameter. It was comprised of fist-sized
and smaller angular burned rocks. Based on the extent of cultural materials and
Paluxy sand deposits, the site boundary was revised to 300 m northeast-southwest
by 200 m northwest-southeast.
Test excavations (Figure 6.1) consisted of eight backhoe trenches (BHTs
1-8), three 1x1m test units (TUs 1–3), two 1.5x1 m test units (TUs 4–5), and one
1x0.5m unit (TU 6). A total of 3.37 m3 was manually excavated. Cultural features,
artifacts, and other materials recovered from the test excavations were grouped
into three analysis units. Analysis Unit 1 subsumed the Paluxy-derived sediments
in the northern part of the site, which contained one buried feature. Analysis Unit
2 consisted of the deposits and excavations around Feature 1. Analysis Unit 3
subsumes the non-Paluxy sediments south of the tributary and around Feature 2.
Analysis Unit 1 contained cultural materials buried in Paluxy-derived
sediments and one basin-shaped hearth (Feature 3) encountered from the surface
to a maximum depth of 180 cm in Backhoe Trench 1 and Test Units 1 and 4. A piece
of charcoal from Feature 3 yielded a radiocarbon age of 240±50 b.p. (Mehalchick,
Killian et al. 2003:208–209, Table A.1). Flotation samples from the same feature
yielded the charred remains of pecan, walnut, ash, holly, juniper, oak, sumac, and
elm. In addition, charred nutshell fragments of pecan, hickory, walnut, and oak
and indeterminate bulb fragments were recovered. Few artifacts were recovered
from Analysis Unit 1. They consisted of two edge-modified flakes and eight pieces of

debitage from Test Unit 1. Aside from Feature 3, Test Unit 4 was devoid of cultural
materials.
Analysis Unit 2 contained cultural materials from Backhoe Trenches 3 and
4 and Test Units 2, 3, and 5. Feature 1, originally defined as a burned rock midden,
was sampled through the excavation of the three test units and Backhoe Trench 3.
As a result of this work, Feature 1 was redefined as an occupation zone measuring
at least 45x30 m. Feature 1 yielded charred oak wood, 3 flakes, 1 ground stone
tool fragment, and two internal burned rock features (Features 4 and 6). Test unit
recovery from outside Feature 1 consisted of 1 Scallorn arrow point, 1 core tool, and
19 flakes from depths of up to 70 cm. Features 4 and 6 were encountered in Test
Unit 5. Feature 4, a basin-shaped hearth, was originally exposed in Backhoe Trench
3. Charred oak wood from the feature yielded a radiocarbon age of 1900±50 b.p.
(Mehalchick, Killian et al. 2003:211, Table A.1). Other charred botanical remains
included juniper, hackberry, oak, sumac, and black locust. Feature 6, also a basinshaped hearth, was encountered in the northeast corner of Test Unit 5. It extended
north and east beyond the limits of Test Unit 5, leaving the majority of the feature
unexcavated. Oak charcoal from the feature yielded a radiocarbon age of 2090±50 b.p.
Flotation samples produced more charred oak remains, as well as charred elm and
unidentified bulb fragments. Two flakes were recovered from Feature 6.
Analysis Unit 3 contained the cultural materials and feature in Backhoe
Trenches 7 and 8 and Test Unit 6. These excavations sampled Feature 2, originally
defined as a burned rock and lithic scatter, and the surrounding area. The
investigations indicated that Feature 2 was simply a sparse scatter of burned rocks
and debitage. Artifacts recovered from Test Unit 6 consisted of 1 untypeable dart
point, 3 bifaces, 3 flakes, and 1 edge-modified flake. A burned rock concentration,
Feature 5, was encountered at 30–40 cm in the test unit. Four flakes were associated
with the feature.
The National Register eligibility test excavations conducted by PAI indicated
that 41CV1553 contained intact buried components, particularly in the area north
of the tributary where Paluxy-derived sediments were laterally extensive and deep
(Mehalchick, Killian et al. 2003:202–214, 251–252, 265–268). Although portions of the
area had been disturbed, it yielded dated features and a Scallorn arrow point that
indicated multiple occupations spanning the Late Archaic through Late Prehistoric
and into the Protohistoric periods. Many of the features yielded a variety charred
botanical remains, including possible food remains such as bulbs and nutshells.
Based on these results, it was recommended that the site be listed as eligible for
the National Register.
Current Investigations
The current investigations at 41CV1553 took place in two phases. The first
phase took place in April to July 2009. The second phase of work was in January
2012 (Figure 6.2). The Phase I work began with a GPR survey focusing on the
northern portion of the site, where thick Paluxy-derived sandy sediments mantle
the surface (see Appendix A). Two survey grids were established, both oriented 329

Chapter 6

degrees from magnetic north and referred to as the north and the south grids. All
of the work during the first phase of work occurred within the two survey grids
(Figure 6.3). The GPR survey identified six anomalies, three in the northern survey
grid and three in the southern grid.
Excavations at the site started with shovel tests to investigate the six GPR
anomalies and four additional shovel tests randomly placed. Shovel testing of the
six anomalies resulted in the discovery of two burned rock features, Features 7
and 8, within Shovel Tests 3 and 5, respectively. Shovel Test 4 yielded a few burned
rocks, and ice-pick probing nearby suggests there is a burned rock cluster in this
area. Shovel Tests 1, 2, and 6 also yielded a few scattered small burned rocks but no
evidence of burned rock features. The four nonanomaly shovel tests (Shovel Tests
7–10) did not encounter any concentrations of burned rocks or burned rock features.
The shovel test depths ranged from 24 to 65 cm below the surface, except for Shovel
Test 5, which encountered Feature 8 near the surface (see Anomaly A in Figure A.5).
Test unit locations were selected based on the initial shovel testing results.
The recovery of burned rocks in Shovel Test 3 at 5–10 cm below surface was followed
by the placement of Test Unit 7 over the shovel test and the subsequent excavation
of Feature 7. The feature, a burned rock scatter, occurred 10–20 cm below the surface.
The test unit was excavated to 40 cm below the surface.
Laid out in the shape of a large cross, Test Units 8 and 10–24 were excavated
as individual 1x1-m units exposing and sampling Feature 8, a small burned rock
mound detected during the GPR survey and confirmed by the excavation of Shovel
Test 5. The depths of the 16 test units ranged from 15 to 35 cm below ground surface.
Within the burned rock mound, four subfeatures were identified and designated
Features 8A–8D.
Test Unit 9 was excavated over a GPR anomaly, where Shovel Test 6
encountered a large unburned limestone cobble. After the excavation of two
levels, several more unburned limestone cobbles were exposed on top of or near
the underlying Bt horizon. The unburned nature of the clasts and their random
arrangement suggested that these rocks were probably the product of natural
deposition.
A permanent datum consisting of rebar in concrete was set up, and a Sokia
total station was used to map the site and all the excavations. At the conclusion of
Phase I, the burned rock mound Feature 8 was left mostly intact and covered with
clean fill for protection.
The Phase II work focused on collecting burned rock samples from two
features for the extraction of plant microfossils (see Appendix B). The targeted
features were Feature 6, which was discovered but left unexcavated in 1999
(Mehalchick, Killian et al. 2003:211–214), and the Feature 8 burned rock mound,
which was also left in situ. These investigations were conducted by archeologists
from PAI and the Archeological Ecology Laboratory at Texas A&M University. Using
a backhoe, a ca. 12 m2 area adjacent to and south of Test Units 12–14, 20, and 23–24
was scraped to find additional portions of Feature 8, subfeatures within Feature

8, and any other features that might be present. The shallow scraping and hand
excavations discovered Features 8E and 8F, which were recorded and sampled.
Shallow mechanical scraping was also carried out in the vicinity of Backhoe Trench
3 and Test Unit 5 from the 1999 test excavations.
The Phase I work had uncovered a portion of Feature 6, a basin-shaped
hearth, in the northeastern corner of Test Unit 5. Once excavated and recorded,
Mehalchick, Killian et al. (2003:213) estimated that 70 to 75 percent of this feature
remained intact beyond the limits of Test Unit 5. The Phase II investigations were
able to locate both the backhoe trench and Test Unit 5 through mechanical scraping,
and thus find the remainder of Feature 6. The remaining intact portion of Feature
6 was excavated, described, and photographed, and various samples were collected
for archeobotanical analyses.
Sediments and Stratigraphy
Pedogenically altered Paluxy-derived sands mantled the northern portion or
upper slopes of the site, where both phases of the current investigations took place.
In Mehalchick, Killian et al. (2003:207–208), Kibler provides a detailed description
of these sediments based on observations made during the 1999 test excavations.
In summary, these sandy to loamy sediments rest on the Glen Rose limestone and
are upwards of 2 m thick, but progressively thin and become more loamy downslope.
The sediments are typically imprinted with an A-2Bt soil profile, within cultural
materials and features found above or resting on the 2Bt horizon (see Kibler 1996).
The 2Bt horizon characteristically consists of a well-structured rubified sandy clay
loam that represents a truncated late Pleistocene to early Holocene soil. Radiocarbon
assays reveal that these late Pleistocene to early Holocene soils formed on Paluxy or
Paluxy-derived sediments were severely eroded by ca. 4000–5000 b.p., after which
they were buried by late Holocene sediments (Kibler 1996:51). The A horizon is
typically imprinted on thin, though locally filled gullies can be much thicker, dark
(10YR hues) sandy loams to loamy sands. The A horizon is archeologically significant
because it contains all of the buried artifacts and cultural features.
Cultural Features
Three features and four subfeatures were investigated during the two
phases of work at 41CV1553. During the 2009 Phase I work, Features 7 and 8 and
four subfeatures within Feature 8—designated Features 8A, 8B, 8C, and 8D—were
discovered and investigated during. During the 2012 Phase II work, the remainder
of Feature 6 (found during the previous testing phase) was examined and two
additional subfeatures—Features 8E and 8F—were discovered and investigated
within Feature 8. All of these features are described in this section.
Feature 6
During testing at 41CV1553, Feature 6 was discovered in Backhoe Trench
3, and a portion of it was excavated in the northeast corner of Test Unit 5 (see
Mehalchick, Killian et al. 2003:Figure 5.18). The feature was described as a basin-

Chapter 6

shaped hearth in Paluxy sediment just above limestone bedrock. The Phase II work
included mechanical scraping in the vicinity of Backhoe Trench 3 and Test Unit 5,
with the goal of re-locating the intact portion of Feature 6. The mechanical scraping
did find the old backhoe trench and test unit, and the remainder of Feature 6 was
hand excavated. This portion of the feature was roughly circular in plan view and
measured 125x122 cm with an estimated depth or maximum thickness of 25 cm
(Figure 6.4). When the previously excavated portion of Feature 6 is considered, the
complete feature is generally oval in shape and measures ca. 165 cm north-south
by 125 cm east-west.

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

The Feature 6 burned rocks are mostly large but thin (1.5–5.0 cm thick)
tabular pieces, along with very few small blocky burned pieces. Spaces between
rocks are filled with black (10YR 2/1) and very dark brown (10YR 3/2) fine sandy
loam. The dark feature matrix contrasts with the very dark grayish brown (10YR
3/2) and brown (10YR 4/3) surrounding nonfeature matrix. Segments of the feature’s
perimeter display one to two layers of inclined to vertical limestone slabs. The feature
bottom contains two to three layers of flat-lying limestone slabs. The total burned
rock weight of the feature is 135.4 kg, which includes 110.4 kg removed during
the current investigations and 25.0 kg removed in 1999 (Mehalchick, Killian et al.
2003:213). A flotation sample from the feature yielded charred botanical remains
representing firewood and food resources. The charred wood sources consisted of
oak (Quercus sp.), red oak (Quercus subg. Lobatae), and live oak (Q. fusiformis).
Food sources consisted of camas (Camassia sp.) and other indeterminate bulb scales.
From the initial testing, Mehalchick, Killian et al. (2003:213) recovered charred
oak, elm (Ulmus sp.), and unidentifiable bulb fragments from flotation of Feature
6 sediment. Burned rock samples were taken and examined for plant microfossils
(see Appendix B).
Feature 7
Feature 7 was first observed as GPR Anomaly 3 and was initially investigated
with Shovel Test 3. Test Unit 7 was then excavated to expose a scatter of burned
rocks in a single layer across the unit (Figure 6.5). The burned rocks appeared just
below the ground surface to a depth of 20 cm and are predominantly angular, ranging
in size from 2 to 10 cm. The burned rocks definitely extend beyond the test unit
in several directions, so the full size of Feature 7 is not known. The GPR anomaly,
however, suggests that this is a relatively small burned rock feature (see Appendix
A). The burned rocks exposed in Test Unit 7 were not arranged in any discernible
particular pattern, though a few larger tabular rocks were concentrated near the
center of the test unit. These larger rocks may be the remnant of a cooking feature
that was subsequently disturbed resulting in the overall scattered nature of this
feature. In total, 373 burned rocks weighing 46 kg were removed from the feature.
Rocks less than 5 cm in maximum dimension accounted for 73 percent of the burned
rocks, while 10 percent of the rocks were greater than 10 cm.
Nine burned rocks were collected for starch grain analysis (see Appendix
D). Sediments in and around the burned rocks consist of a sandy silty clay.
Macrobotanical remains recovered from flotation samples included charred wood
fragments of oak (Quercus sp.), white oak (Quercus subg. Quercus), and juniper
(Juniper sp.), as well as indeterminable fragments of charred wood (see Appendix B).
Feature 8 Mound and Subfeatures
Feature 8 is a small burned rock mound with six subfeatures (Features
8A–8F). Four subfeatures (Features 8A–8D) are interpreted as components of a
single earth oven located just off-center in the mound, and two (Features 8E and 8F)
are on the periphery of the mound. Consequently, it is appropriate to consider all of
these features together since the inference is that they are functionally associated.

Chapter 6

Figure 6.5. Feature 7 in Test Unit 7. View is to the south, and the north arrow is a 20-cm scale in 5-cm increments. Some of the larger burned rocks in the center have been removed.

Feature 8 was first identified in the GPR survey as Anomaly A (see Figure
A.5). Shovel Test 5 was excavated to examine this anomaly, and burned rocks were
encountered just below the ground surface. Test Unit 8 was then centered over
Shovel Test 5, and its subsequent excavation encountered a dense concentration of
burned rocks across the entire unit. Test Unit 8 was dug down to the underlying
Bt horizon and revealed that the burned rock deposits were up to 28 cm thick.
Additional units were excavated to follow the horizontal limits of this feature and
sample the deposits. An additional 15 test units (Test Units 10–24) were laid out
in a cross pattern (Figure 6.6). The additional units revealed that this is a small
burned rock mound, and that the deposits are most concentrated in Test Units 8,
11, 13, and 14, where the mound is composed of four to five layers of burned rocks.
The mound deposits in the surrounding 11 test units are less dense and composed
of a single layer of burned rocks. While the excavations did not expose the entire
mound, definitive feature margins were exposed in Test Units 16, 18, 20, 21, 22,
and 24, providing an estimated mound size of 5.5 m north-south by 4.8 m east-west.
A total of 4,478 burned rocks weighing 500.2 kg were removed during the
mound excavations (Table 6.1). With the exception of the burned rocks recovered

Figure 6.6. Overview of the Phase I excavations of Feature 8 at 41CV1553, with inset map of unit numbers.
View is to the north, and the full horizontal extent of the burned rock mound is exposed in the sixteen 1x1-m
units. Note the 2-m scale on the right and 50-cm scale on the left.

from the initial excavations of Test Units 8, 10, and 11, all rocks were size graded
into four categories as follows: 0–5 cm; 5–10 cm; 10–15 cm; and 15+ cm. Recognizing
that not all rocks from three test units were size graded, a slight majority of the
burned rocks (50.3 percent) are less than 5 cm in maximum dimension; 23.8 percent
are between 5 and 10 cm; 5.7 percent are between 10 and 15 cm; and slightly more
than 1 percent are greater than 15 cm. By weight, however, only 15.5 percent of the
rocks are less than 5 cm, 32.1 percent are between 5 and 10 cm, and 10.8 percent
are between 10 and 15 cm. The largest size category (>15 cm) accounts for only
11.0 percent of the burned rocks by weight.
Three charcoal samples, either hand collected during excavation or recovered
from flotation samples, were submitted for radiocarbon dating. A hand-collected
specimen of oak (Quercus sp.) charcoal from a depth of 22 cm in Test Unit 8 yielded
a conventional radiocarbon age of 1440±40 b.p. (Beta-269719, 2-sigma range
a.d. 550–660). Oak (Quercus sp.) charcoal recovered from a flotation sample collected
from a depth of 8–21 cm in Test Unit 11 produced a conventional radiocarbon
age of 1860±40 b.p. (Beta-269722, 2-sigma range a.d. 60–240). Another flotation
sample collected from a depth of 21–26 cm in Test Unit 20 (at the base of Feature

8) yielded oak (Quercus sp.) charcoal that produced a conventional radiocarbon age
of 1460±40 b.p. (Beta-269726, 2-sigma range a.d. 540–650).
Fifteen flotation samples collected from Test Units 8, 10–15, and 19–20
yielded various charred botanical remains representing fuel (firewood) and food (see
Appendix B). The vast majority of the fuel wood was identified as oak (Quercus sp.),
white oak (Quercus subg. Quercus), and live oak (Q. fusiformis). Other less common
sources of firewood were identified as juniper (Juniperus sp.). A wild garlic (Allium
sp.) bulb from a depth of 15–20 cm in Test Unit 8 and unidentifiable bulb scales
from 8–23 cm in Test Unit 13 and 20–25 cm in Test Unit 8 represent food sources.
One indeterminate carbonized seed was recovered from 0–10 cm in Test Unit 8.
Features 8A–8D
Four pits or subfeatures within Feature 8, designated Features 8A, 8B, 8C,
and 8D, were defined in four contiguous 1x1-m units: Test Units 8, 11, 13, and 14.
All four subfeatures were in the thickest part of the burned rock mound deposits
(Figure 6.7). When the four units were being excavated, there appeared to be four

83

84

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

separate burned rock concentrations and they were given separate designations by
unit, with Feature 8A in Test Unit 11, Feature 8B in Test Unit 8, Feature 8C in Test
Unit 14, and Feature 8D in Test Unit 13. When Test Units 8 and 11 were completely
excavated, the resulting south wall profile revealed that Features 8C and 8D (still
in place in Test Units 13 and 14) represented one large pit feature (Figure 6.8). It
was at this point that the excavators realized that all four of these burned rock–
filled pits are probably components of a single large earth oven. Although it is now
believed that these subfeatures are spatially and functionally related as part of a
larger earth oven, they are described individually below as they were documented
in the field.
Feature 8A was defined in the west-central portion of Test Unit 11 as
the overlying jumble of burned rocks were removed and a series of large tabular
rocks, along with some smaller rocks were revealed, lining the edges of a shallow
depression in the underlying Bt horizon. The feature is composed of 70 burned
rocks weighing 17.3 kg. Of these, slightly more than half (51 percent) are less than
5 cm in maximum dimension, and 9 percent are greater than 15 cm. By weight,
however, burned rocks from the largest size category account for slightly more than
a quarter (28 percent) of the feature’s rock fill. Three burned rock samples were
collected for starch grain analysis. Fine-grained sediments filling the pockets and
voids between the burned rocks are darker than sediments outside of Feature 8A
but within Feature 8. Oak (Quercus sp.) charcoal hand collected from the feature at
31 cm yielded a conventional radiocarbon age of 1510±40 b.p. (Beta-269720, 2-sigma
range a.d. 430-640). Flotation samples collected from Feature 8A produced charred
botanical remains representing firewood and food. Firewood sources were identified
as oak (Quercus sp.), white oak (Quercus subg. Quercus), live oak (Q. fusiformis),
and juniper (Juniperus sp.). A charred scurfpea (Pediomelum sp.) tuber recovered
from flotation represents a probable food source.
Feature 8B was defined in the southeast portion of Test Unit 8 and the
northeast portion of Test Unit 13 as the veneer of smaller burned rocks were
removed, exposing a series of large tabular rocks lining the margins of a shallow
depression in the underlying Bt horizon. The feature is composed of 69 burned rocks
weighing 18.1 kg. Of these, 23 percent are less than 5 cm in maximum dimension,
and 3 percent are greater than 15 cm. By weight however, burned rocks greater
than 10 cm in maximum dimension account for 38.1 percent of the Feature 8B rock
fill. Fine-grained sediments filling the voids between the burned rocks are darker
than sediments outside of Feature 8B but within Feature 8. Charred oak wood
produced from a flotation sample collected from the feature at a depth of 23­–30 cm
yielded a conventional radiocarbon age of 1390±40 b.p. (Beta-269723, 2-sigma range
a.d. 600–680). Flotation samples collected from Feature 8B produced other charred
botanical remains representing fuel and food. Firewood sources were identified as
oak (Quercus sp.), white oak (Quercus subg. Quercus), and live oak (Q. fusiformis).
Charred fragments of unidentified bulb scales and a tuber represent possible food
sources.
Feature 8C was defined in the west-central portion of Test Unit 14 once
the overlying layer of smaller burned rocks were removed, revealing large tabular

rocks lining the edges of a shallow basin. The feature consists of 251 burned rocks
weighing 56.3 kg. Burned rocks less than 5 cm in maximum dimension represent
slightly more than half (55 percent) of the feature’s rocks, and those greater than
15 cm comprise about 6 percent. By weight, the largest-size rocks account for onethird of the feature’s rock fill. Sedimentary fill between the burned rocks is darker
than the sediments outside Feature 8C. Oak charcoal recovered from a flotation
sample collected at 32 cm produced a conventional radiocarbon age of 1590±40 b.p.
(Beta-269724, 2-sigma range a.d. 390–560). Flotation samples collected from the
feature produced other carbonized botanical remains representing fuel and food.
Identifiable fuel sources consisted of oak (Quercus sp.) and red oak (Quercus subg.
Lobatae) charcoal. One charred indeterminate bulb scale representing a possible
food source was also recovered.
Feature 8D was located in the east-central part of Test Unit 13. As with
the other pit features, it was discovered as the mantle of smaller burned rocks
were removed from Feature 8 and larger tabular rocks lining a shallow basin were
exposed. The feature is comprised of 411 burned rocks weighing 89.5 kg. Of these,

Chapter 6

35 percent are less than 5 cm in maximum dimension, and 5 percent are greater
than 15 cm. By weight, however, the largest size category of burned rocks account
for 22 percent of the feature’s rocks, whereas the smallest size category accounted
for just 6 percent. Two charcoal samples, one a piece of white oak (Quercus subg.
Quercus) hand collected from 24 cm and one recovered from a flotation sample
collected from 28 cm were submitted for radiocarbon dating. The hand-collected
specimen yielded a conventional radiocarbon age of 1470±40 b.p. (Beta-269721,
2-sigma range of a.d. 540–650). The sample recovered through flotation produced
a conventional radiocarbon age of 1730±40 b.p. (Beta-269725, 2-sigma range of
a.d. 230-410). Flotation samples yielded charred plant materials representing
firewood. Of the fragments examined, only oak (Quercus sp.) and white oak (Quercus
subg. Quercus) were identified.
The sizes of these four subfeatures range from 60x50 cm (Feature 8B) to
100x72 cm (Feature 8C), but they all occur within a roughly oval area ca. 150x175 cm.
If they represent the remnant rock linings from different use episodes of the same
earth oven over a 600-year period, as the radiocarbon ages suggest (see discussion
later in this chapter), then the diameter of the larger earth oven basin is at least
150 cm (east-west), with an average depth of a little more than 20 cm (see Figures
6.7 and 6.8). If this is indeed a single earth oven pit, albeit reused several times, it
is quite large. However, it is still smaller than the largest well-defined earth oven
features investigated at the Firebreak site (41CV595) on Fort Hood, which are
260x120 cm (Feature 4), 200x160 cm (Feature 11; 160 is estimated); and 210x226 cm
(Feature 15; 226 is estimated) (Mehalchick et al. 2004:97, 119).
When the data for all the subfeatures are combined, the larger earth oven is
comprised of 801 burned rocks weighing 181.2 kg, with 43 (5.4 percent) larger than
15 cm in maximum dimension (see Table 6.1). The burned rocks larger than 15 cm
weigh 46.0 kg and account for 25.4 percent of the total burned rock weight for the
oven. Beyond this earth oven, the burned rocks that comprise the general matrix
of the Feature 8 mound (but excluding the Subfeatures 8A–8D) consisted of only
6 specimens greater than 15 cm in size and weighing 6.4 kg. Within the Feature
8 mound, then, these largest burned rocks represent only 0.3 percent of the total
burned rocks by count and only 3.3 percent of the total burned rocks by weight. This
is quite a contrast to the 24.0 percent of large burned rocks represented in the four
earth oven subfeatures. The 41CV1553 burned rock data exhibits the same pattern
as that of the Firebreak site (41CV595) (Mehalchick et al. 2004:Table 8.19), although
the rock size categories are different (probably because the rock source at that site
was closer and contained larger tabular slabs). In both sites, the largest and most

87

intact rocks survived in the earth ovens, while smaller fragments dominated in the
general midden matrix.
Aside from the radiocarbon ages, the notably higher percentage (by frequency
and weight) of burned rocks greater than 15 cm suggests that this cooking feature
was used multiple times. According to Black and Lucas (1997), the ratio of small to
large rocks provides an impression of the degree to which the rocks have been heated
and reheated (thermally cycled) since rocks break apart and become increasingly
smaller with each reuse. Given this assumption, the Feature 8 burned rock mound—
comprised predominantly of small (10 cm or less) fragmented rocks and few rocks
greater than 15 cm—has substantial waste debris from earlier earth oven cooking
episodes that has accumulated around the central basin. This high degree of thermal
cycling reflects an unknown number of use episodes. The significance of the Feature
8 burned rock mound is discussed at the end of this chapter.

Features 8E–8H
During the Phase II work, four more subfeatures within the Feature 8 burned
rock mound were recorded. A ca. 12 m2 area adjacent to and just south of Test Units
24, 23, 12, 13, 14, and 20 (listed from west to east) was scraped with a backhoe to a
depth of 10–15 cm below surface (Figure 6.9). This exposed more scattered burned
rocks of Feature 8 (in the southeastern area) as well as four subfeatures designated
Features 8E–8H.
Figure 6.10

Figure 6.10. Feature 8E at 41CV1553. View is west and the north arrow scale card is 15 cm in length.

Feature 8E is a shallow burned rock-filled basin that was oval in plan view
and measured 106x92 cm, with an overall thickness of 9 cm (Figure 6.10). The burned
rocks were arranged in two layers with dark organic-stained sediments and charcoal
filling the spaces between the rocks. A flotation sample of feature matrix yielded
charred botanical remains representing both fuel and food. Firewood sources were
identified as red oak (Quercus subg. Lobatae), live oak (Q. fusiformis), and juniper
(Juniperus sp.). A camas (Camassia sp.) bulb scale represents a food source.

Figure 6.11. Feature 8F at 41CV1553. View is to the south and the north arrow scale card is 15 cm in length.

Feature 8F is a small flat burned rock concentration with little evidence of in
situ burning in the form of oxidized sediment and charcoal below the rocks (Figure
6.11). The feature is oval in plan view and measures 65x52 cm. It was just a few
meters southwest of the jumble burned rock deposits of Feature 8 and not part of
the general matrix itself.
Feature 8G is a burned rock concentration with a slight basin shape. It
contained one large and two smaller tabular rocks at steep angles with six smaller
rocks lying horizontally, all within an area ca. 50 cm in diameter. No carbon staining
or charcoal flecks were observed in the surrounding sediment. Because the feature
function was deemed indeterminate, macrobotanical and microfossil analyses were
not undertaken, and the burned rocks were not weighed or examined for thermalweathering characteristics. This feature may be a disturbed earth oven heating
element, some other type of cooking facility, or merely a cluster of discarded cooking
stones.
Feature 8H is a flat-bottomed concentration of burned rocks within an area
ca. 125 cm in diameter. It consists of a single layer of mostly small to medium-sized
tabular rocks, and the west edge of the feature laps over Feature 8G. No carbonstained sediment or charcoal flecks were observed in the Feature 8H sediment.

Chapter 6

The feature was comprised of 118 burned rocks weighing 34.5 kg. Observations
were made on the thermal characteristics of the burned rocks, and 35.6 percent
were heated from the bottom and only 16.1 percent were heated from the top (the
remainder were indeterminate). This feature may be a disturbed earth oven heating
element, some other type of cooking facility, or merely a cluster of discarded cooking
stones. Because its function was unclear, no macrobotanical or microfossil analyses
were undertaken.
Cultural Materials
Most of the collected artifacts and other cultural materials observed during
the current investigations were generated during the Phase I work in 2009, primarily
from Feature 8 and its subfeatures. The recovered artifacts consist of 2 dart points,
3 biface fragments, 1 uniface, 4 edge-modified flake tools, 238 pieces of unmodified
debitage, and 3 ground and battered stone tools (Table 6.2). In addition, 216 pieces
of unmodified microdebitage were recovered from flotation samples collected from
Features 6, 7, and 8, and five of the six subfeatures (all except for 8F). Table 6.2
also notes the proveniences that yielded lumps of burned clay and historic artifacts
(pieces of modern metal, mostly shrapnel). The two dart points recovered were an
Ensor made of Owl Creek Black chert (with abundant fossil inclusions, but it is not
fluorescent under shortwave UV light) and an untyped corner-notched specimen (cf.
Ensor) made of Fort Hood Yellow chert (see Figure 3.1f and g). The metric attributes
for these points are summarized in Table 3.2.
Summary of 41CV1553 Occupations and
INTERPRETATION OF BURNED ROCK MOUND feature 8
To date, the combined archeological investigations at 41CV1553 include hand
excavations of 33 shovel tests (23 by Mariah Associates in 1993 and 10 by PAI) and
24 test units (plus limited non-unit excavations of two features in a mechanically
scraped area). The total estimated excavation area for the all test units is 24.5 m2,
and the total estimated volume of all the unit excavations is ca. 8 m3 for the 1999
testing and the current project.5 The total number of stone artifacts recovered from
the site testing is 532 (see Table 6.2).6 Thus, the sample from 41CV1553 is relatively
small in terms of area and volume excavated and in terms of total number of stone
artifacts recovered, but it is the second most intensively investigated Paluxy site on
Fort Hood (see Boyd et al. 2004:Table 9.2). The most intensively investigated Paluxy
site is the Firebreak site (41CV595), which has seen 44.8 m3 of hand excavations
and produced 3,814 stone artifacts.7 In comparison, 41CV1553 had only 18 percent
The excavated areas were ca. 6.5 m2 for the 1999 testing and 18 m2 for the current project. The
excavated volumes were ca. 3.37 m3 for the 1999 testing and 4.1 m3 for the current project (the
latter is a rough estimate).
6
This number excludes artifacts recovered by Mariah Associates in the 1993 shovel testing but
includes 53 stone artifacts from the 1999 testing by PAI and 479 stone artifacts recovered in the
current project.
7
The PAI data recovery investigations at the Firebreak site in 2000 included 39.2 m3 of excavation
yielded 3,394 artifacts (Boyd et al. 2004:Table 9.2). Additional work was completed at the site in
2003 by the Center for Environmental Management of Military Lands at Colorado State University.
This work included 5.57 m3 of hand excavation and yielded another 420 stone artifacts (Ziedler
2004:Tables 6.1, 6.2, and 7.4).

*These investigations recovered 479 artifacts. The 1999 testing recovered 53 stone artifacts (as reported by Mehalchick et al. 2003:Table 6.1). This
brings the total number of recovered from all site testing (excluding the 1993 shovel testing) to 532 specimens.

Chapter 6

of the excavated volume at the Firebreak site and produced only 14 percent of
Firebreak’s stone artifact assemblage.
The 41CV1553 assemblage is quite small (see Table 6.2), mainly because the
excavations were focused on investigating cooking features rather than searching
for high-density artifact areas. Given the size of the excavation areas, at 24.5 m2,
the overall densities of stone artifacts are low, and the recovered items probably
represent debris discarded in and around the cooking areas before and after the
cooking episodes. The frequency of items per square meter is 0.4 chipped stone tools
(n = 10), 0.12 ground and battered stone tools (n = 4), and 9.76 unmodified flakes
(n = 239, excluding the microdebitage recovered from sediment flotation). In contrast,
the frequency of materials recovered from the Firebreak site was 1.7 chipped stone
tools, 0.07 ground and battered stone tools, and 48.1 unmodified flakes per square
meter.8 Despite being small, the overall tool assemblage for 41CV1553 is diverse
and appears to reflect general residential base camp activities similar to those that
occurred at the Firebreak site. While the absence of cores suggests that early-stage
lithic reduction was rare, the presence of microflakes (n = 227) in all of the flotation
samples indicates that a fair amount of late-stage reduction occurred. The relative
abundance of simple edge-modified flake tools (n = 4), which account for 40 percent
of the chipped stone tools, is a notable attribute also observed at Firebreak and
other Paluxy sites (see Mehalchick et al. 2004:Tables 5.2, 6.4, and 7.4).
Six temporally diagnostic projectile points were recovered from the various
investigations at 41CV1553:
•

et al. (2003:205)
Martindale dart point from surface, Mariah Associates 1993 (see Mehalchick,

Scallorn arrow point (with serrated blades) from Test Unit 2, PAI 1999 (see

Table 3.3 and Figure 3.1f)
Untyped corner-notched dart point (cf. Ensor) from Test Unit 19, Feature 8,
PAI current investigation (see Table 3.3 and Figure 3.1g)

This suite of points above includes three types that have been found on
other Paluxy sites at Fort Hood, with the Frio being the only type not previously
recovered at a Paluxy site. As discussed by Boyd et al. (2004:219–222), Martindale
is the earliest style of dart point that has been found on a Paluxy site, but only one
Early- to Middle Archaic radiocarbon date has been obtained. In contrast, Late
Archaic dart points and arrow points are very common, and Ensors are the most
abundant dart points at Paluxy sites (n = 26), while Scallorns are the most common

Mehalchick et al. (2004:Table 7.4) reports 118 chipped stone tools, 5 ground and battered stone
tools, and 3,253 unmodified flakes recovered from 67.6 m2 of excavation (calculated based on data
in Mehalchick et al. 2004:Table 7.3).

arrow point recovered (n = 7) (Boyd et al. 2004:Figure 9.7). Numerous radiocarbon
dates from many Paluxy sites on Fort Hood support the idea of intensive use of the
Paluxy environment during the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods (Boyd
et al. 2004:Figure 9.6).
Site 41CV1553 did yield some interesting charred macrobotanical remains
preserved in certain feature contexts, a phenomenon also observed at the Firebreak
site and other Paluxy sites on Fort Hood (Mehalchick et al. 2004; see Chapter 4).
The botanical remains recovered from 41CV1553 features include a wide variety of
charred woods (mainly oak and juniper) and charred remains of several plant foods,
including wild garlic and camas bulb fragments (see Appendix B).

Eleven radiocarbon dates have now been obtained from 41CV1553 (Table 6.3
and Figure 6.12). Only the Firebreak site (41CV595) has more radiocarbon dates,
with a total of 15 assays (Mehalchick et al. 2004:Table 7.6 and Figure 8.1). When
all eleven of the calibrated dates are viewed together, it is notable how they cluster
in the terminal end of the Late Archaic period. A radiocarbon date from Feature 3
is the only true anomaly, and it may indicate a very late occupation at end of the
Late Prehistoric period or in the Protohistoric period. All of the other dates fall into
a roughly 1,000-year span from 350 b.c. to a.d. 687, squarely in the latter part of
the Late Archaic.

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

The most intensively investigated portion of 41CV1553 is the burned rock
mound called Feature 8, which had no surface manifestation and was discovered
through the use of ground-penetrating radar. The archeological investigations
examined almost the entire feature, revealing an oval burned rock mound with six
internal features (Figure 6.13). Four of the subfeatures are tightly clustered and
appear to represent a single earth oven cooking pit that is just north of the center of
the mound. Although they were documented as separate features (Features 8A–8D),
at the end of the excavations it was concluded that they were part of one larger
pit feature. But the complex patterning of burned rocks suggests the large oven
was not a single-use feature. Rather, the patterning suggests that the same large
pit was used multiple times, but that some clusters of burned rocks linings the pit
bottom were left in place from different cooking episodes. As discussed below, the
radiocarbon dates from these four subfeatures support this interpretation. Tw of
the other subfeatures seem to represent a small isolated earth oven event (Feature
8E) and a surface hearth or dump of burned rocks (Feature 8F).
In many ways, Feature 8 is a classic version of a central Texas burned
rock mound as described by Abbott et al. (1996), Black et al. (1997), Boyd et al.
(2000:38–42), Kleinbach (1995), Kleinbach et al. (1999), Mehalchick, Kibler et al.
(2003:193–194). Many burned rock mounds on Fort Hood are generally circular
and domed, with a fair amount of relief making them easy to recognized (and they
sometimes have a central depression forming a doughnut shape). Although Feature
8 at 41CV1553 is not domed, and had no surface expression, this is almost certainly
due to postdepositional disturbances. Given its location in an open grassy area where
modern army training takes place, this burned rock mound was probably flattened
and dispersed by vehicle traffic.
The eight radiocarbon dates for this feature were obtained on wood charcoal
from the mound deposits and from the earth oven pits within the mound. Collectively,
these dates suggest that the mound began to develop sometime between a.d. 65 and
240, followed by a possible period of inactivity or abandonment lasting about 150
years. Food-processing activities resumed at this location around a.d. 390, and use
episodes occurred intermittently over the next three centuries, ending sometime
in the late a.d. 600s. It is somewhat rare to find evidence that small burned rock
mounds in central Texas were probably utilized intermittently over many centuries,
but this may be an archeologically introduced bias that stems from not dating enough
samples. Notably, however, this phenomenon of extended reuse of a single burned
rock mound with one central earth oven pit was also observed at nearby Paluxy
site 41CV984 (see Chapter 4).
NATIONAL REGISTER ASSESSMENT of 41CV1553
It is recommended that 41CV1553 remains eligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places. Two GPR blocks were surveyed and several anomalies
were tested. Two small burned rock features were found (Features 6 and 7), and one

of the large GPR anomalies turned out be a small burned rock mound (Feature 8).
This mound was completely investigated using hand excavations with 18 (1x1 m)
units and some mechanical scraping. Six internal features (Features 8A to 8G) were
found within this mound, and these were completely excavated. The archeological
work at 41CV1553 demonstrated the utility of GPR surveying in ideal Paluxy
settings (i.e., deep Paluxy sand deposits, relatively flat, with minimal vegetation), as
well as the potential that many more burned rock features are present across this
large site. The current investigations were confined to a relatively small area (some
30x80 m including both GPR blocks), and the previously defined site boundary for
41CV1553 remains unchanged.

Phase Ii Investigations at 41CV594
and 41cv947

Douglas K. Boyd

During the Phase II fieldwork, investigations at Paluxy sites 41CV594
and 41CV947 were carried out with two specific goals in mind. The first goal
was to use mechanical excavations to quickly locate intact burned rock features
encapsulated within the Paluxy sand deposits. The second goal was to conduct
minimal hand excavations aimed at cross-sectioning the features and quickly and
efficiently obtaining sediment and burned rock samples to be processed to recover
macrobotanical remains (via flotation) and plant microfossils.
Investigations at 41cv594
Site Setting
Site 41CV594 is 150 m east of Old Georgetown Road in the southwestern
portion of Fort Hood. It is located south and east of a prominent bend in Cottonwood
Creek near its confluence with Cowhouse Creek. The site is about 2 km southwest
of this confluence, and is on a north-projecting ridgeline bounded on the west by
Cottonwood Creek and on the east by an unnamed ephemeral tributary. The site is
at an elevation of 268–280 m (880–920 ft) above sea level and 18–24 m (60 to 80 ft)
above the Cottonwood Creek channel to the west.
The site is on the sloping Killeen surface defined by Nordt (1992:Figure 3).
Prehistoric archeological remains at this location are encapsulated within the Paluxy
sands that overlay the Walnut Creek formation. The Paluxy sands are confined to the
central portion of the north-projecting ridge, with Walnut Creek limestone exposed
naturally around the west, north, and east sides of the site. Within the Fort Hood
site typology, 41CV594 is classified as a Paluxy site as defined by Abbott (1994)
and Mehalchick et al. (2004). Much of the site area has been extensively altered by
modern military activities, including the construction of a wide gravel tank trail
that runs from west to east across the southern portion of the site.9

The old tank trail was once located on the southern edge of Feature 2. As a preservation measure,
Fort Hood CRM had the installation planners move the tank trail farther south to divert traffic.
To date, this effort has been successful in eliminating the vehicle impacts to the burned rock
mound (Richard Jones, personal communication 2015).

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

Previous Investigations
Site 41CV594 was recorded in 1985 by Texas A&M University (TAMU)
archeologists (41CV594 site form, Texas Archeological Sites Atlas). They observed
three burned rock mounds and noted that the site was “a potentially rich, possible
deep site” but was “heavily impacted by tracked and wheeled vehicles.” One of the
burned rock mounds had a foxhole dug into it. A Pedernales dart point was collected.
The next investigation was by Mariah Associates, Inc. archeologists in 1992
and 1993 (Trierweiler ed. 1994:230­–233, 245, 258–260). They conducted shovel
testing and identified two relatively intact burned rock mounds that were mapped
as Features 1 and 2. They noted that military activities had continued to impact
the cultural features, and the third mound was found to be extensively disturbed.
Mariah archeologists selected 41CV594 for limited testing, and they excavated a
backhoe trench running north-south across the eastern edge of burned rock mound
Feature 2 (Figure 7.1). The mapped edges of the mound were approximate since
much of the feature was buried. Recent tank tracks were observed around and even
on this mound.
In 1993, Mariah archeologists followed up by excavating two 1x1-m test
pits along the west edge of this trench. Test Pit 1 was excavated to 80 cm deep near
the center of the mound and over a “small, well defined pit…observed in the trench
profile” (Quigg and Ellis 1994:231). The pit narrowed from 100 cm in diameter in
the upper part of Test Pit 1 to about 20 cm in diameter at 80 cm. Artifacts found in
the lower portion of this pit—military cartridges, burlap from sand bags, and Pearl
beer cans—revealed that this pit was an army foxhole (probably the one observed
in 1985). Although a large portion of Test Pit 1 was disturbed by this foxhole, the
“dense burned rock in a dark stained matrix” observed in the southwest corner of
the unit represented intact midden deposits (Trierweiler ed. 1994:231). The deposits
in the south wall of Test Pit 1 appeared to be intact, and a layer of large “burned
rock slabs” was observed at 40–50 cm below surface (see Figure 7.1, bottom).
Test Pit 2 was excavated to 60 cm deep about 3 m south of Test Pit 1. Small
burned rocks, generally under 10 cm in maximum size, were observed within the
brown matrix from 0 to 55 cm. Chert flakes and mussel shell fragments were
recovered in all of the excavation levels, but rifle cartridge cases found in the upper
levels indicated that at least the upper 30 cm was disturbed.
Flotation of sediment from Test Pit 1, the intact midden area, and Test Pit 2
yielded charcoal along with many unburned seeds that were dominated by Brassica
sp., a modern import from the Old World. This provided evidence that the deposits in
both units were disturbed or bioturbated, but the amount of uncharred Brassica sp.
seeds was significantly lower in the lowest two levels (Levels 5 and 6) of Test Pit 2.
Mariah archeologists submitted four charred wood samples from test pits
for radiocarbon dating, and the resulting assays are presented by Trierweiler ed.

Chapter 7

(1994:Table 8.17). The sample depth and carbon isotope-adjusted ages for these four
assays are (see Table 3.3):

The first of these dates is considered modern (i.e., influenced by atomic bomb
radiation), and this date may be on wood procured and burned by modern soldiers
after 1942 (date of U.S. Army acquisition). The other three dates were considered
to be reliable ages on prehistoric charred wood samples, and they suggest use of
the Feature 2 burned rock mound over a span of as much as 2,300 to 3,900 years.
The fact that two dates from the same depth represent events that occurred some
3,300 years apart was interpreted as evidence of the “internal complexities of mound
structure” (Trierweiler ed. 1994:259). Despite some disturbances and evidence of
down-profile movement of fine materials, the Mariah team concluded that Feature 2
“does not appear to reflect an extensively mixed mound” (Trierweiler ed. 1994:259).
Current Investigations
The PAI and TAMU team returned to conduct archeological investigations at
41CV594 in October and November 2011, with Boyd and Thoms directing this work
(Figure 7.2). On October 17, 2011, they visited the site to evaluate the potential of
burned rock mound Feature 2 as a candidate for intensive macrobotanical and plant
microfossil sampling. The work began by using a backhoe to re-excavate Mariah’s
1993 backhoe trench and two test pits. The original trench ran north-south and
was slightly curved, and the investigators were able to follow the original trench
location closely and found the two Mariah test pits off the west wall of the trench.
Microfossil samples were collected from some burned rock features exposed in the
west wall. The trench, designated Backhoe Trench 1, was ca. 12 m long and 1–1.5-m
wide. We left the trench open with plans to return in a few weeks.
About a month later, PAI and TAMU archeologists returned to 41CV594
to conduct intensive feature investigations from November 18–21, 2011. They
established some permanent mapping datum points (rebar sections set in concrete)
and mapped the old Mariah trench and test units. The Sokkia total station was used
to map all the cultural features and samples taken from the features. Vertical control
was maintained with reference to an arbitrary 100.00 m elevation datum point.
The backfill in Mariah’s Test Pits 1 and 2 was removed by hand and
discarded, and the west wall of Trench 1 and walls of the test pits were cleaned
with trowels. In cleaning out Test Pit 1, the Pearl beer cans that were found in 1993
were rediscovered. These were aluminum beer cans with ring pull tabs, so they
postdate the 1965 patent filing date for this invention (Google Patents, U.S. Patent
No. 3,349,949, “Ring-shaped Tab for Tear Strips of Containers”).
At this point, some of the burned rock features that were examined a month
earlier were found to be redeposited concentrations of burned rocks that were in the
compacted backfill at the bottom of the 1993 backhoe trench. Consequently, some of
the microfossil samples taken that day had to be discarded. In addition, a burned
rock concentration was found in the southern end of Backhoe Trench 1, so it was
decided to extend the trench farther south. This area, designated Backhoe Trench
1 Extension, was 3 m long and 70–100 cm wide.

Detailed profiles were drawn of the west wall of Trench 1 and the walls of Test
Pits 1 and 2, and photographs were taken. Five burned rock features were designated
Features 2A–2E because they were subfeatures within Mound Feature 2. Feature
2A was in the southern end of Trench 1 next to Feature 2B, which was observed in
Trench 1 and Test Pit 2. Features 2A and 2B were interpreted as probable earth

oven pits. The large slab-lined feature observed in Test Pit 1 was designated Feature
2C, and two burned rock concentrations in the northern portion of the trench were
designated Features 2D and 2E.
Next, a backhoe was used to dig an east-west trench across the main portion
of the burned rock mound. Backhoe Trench 2 began at the west wall of Mariah’s
Test Pit 1, and it was excavated west for about 8 m, scraping carefully to observe
any features that might appear in the bottom of the trench. Two large burned rock
concentrations were observed in the bottom of the trench as it was being excavated.
Portions of these features were hand excavated, and then the trench was hand dug
deeper to fully expose the features in profile. The two burned rock features were
designated Features 2F and 2G, and a profile was drawn of the north wall of Trench 2.
The backhoe was used to clear off the upper sediments in the 1x1-m unit
just south of Test Pit 1, and to continue this excavation west for 5 more meters.
This effectively widened Trench 2 about 1 m to the south over most of its length,
although fewer burned rocks were encountered in this area, and it was not excavated
as deep as the northern half of the trench. Once this was done, Test Unit 3 was laid
out south of Test Pit 1, and Test Unit 4 was laid out west of Test Unit 3. Units 3
and 410 were then excavated by hand to expose more of Feature 2C. Feature 3 was
documented with profile and plan maps.
Backhoe Trenches 3 and 4 were dug into the Feature 1 mound, confirming
that there were intact burned rock mound deposits and discovering an intrusive
pit feature (Feature 1A) within the mound. The trench profiles were recorded, and
macrobotanical samples were taken of the subfeature. A close surface inspection
discovered a chert biface on the west side of the mound (this specimen was not
collected), and an artifact scatter and a few other chert tools were observed about
10 m southwest of the Feature 1 mound. The latter area was extensively eroded,
and no additional work was done there.
The focus of the work was on Mound Feature 2. Figure 7.3 shows all
the excavations and subfeatures within this mound. The map also shows the
locations of two old military foxholes that were encountered. All of the subfeatures
were documented with profile drawings and photographs and plan views when
appropriate, and the features were then investigated and sampled. Sediment
samples were taken for flotation to recover macrobotanical remains, and the TAMU
archeologists extracted sediment and burned rock samples for microfossil analyses
(discussed later in this report).
During the site reconnaissance, a slight concentration of burned rocks was
observed along the edge of the gravel tank trail south of the Feature 2 mound. To
test whether there might be a burned rock feature nearby, seven shovel tests were
excavated in the intact sediments south of the tank trail. For these shovel tests, the
following cultural materials were observed:

The PAI excavations are called test units to distinguish them from Mariah’s 1993 test pits.
Note that Test Unit 4 was 1 m north-south and 1.3 m east-west.

The shovel tests were all excavated to hard clay or bedrock, with depths
varying from 30 to 60 cm. These tests did not locate any significant concentrations
of burned rocks indicative of a large burned rock mound. However, burned rocks
recovered in Shovel Tests 4 and 5 suggest there may be a buried burned rock feature
in this area. While all of the burned rocks in other shovel tests were small (less
than 10 cm maximum dimension), one burned rock from Shovel Test 4 was 13 cm
in size and one from Shovel Test 5 was 30 cm in maximum length. Shovel Test 5
also yielded charcoal and dark-stained midden soil, suggesting the possibility that a
sizable burned rock feature may be buried underneath the caliche gravel tank trail
to the north. No further investigations were made in the area of these shovel tests.
Sediments and Stratigraphy
Almost all of the 2011 investigations focused on burned rock mounds, with
the most intensive work being in the Feature 2 mound. The mounds themselves are
anthropogenic accumulations of burned rocks and organic-enriched sediments that
occurs within the pedogenically altered Paluxy-derived sandy to loamy deposits.
The latter occur on top of a layer of weathered Paluxy Formation sandstone, which
is weathered to varying degrees, over Glen Rose limestone. The stratigraphy of
Backhoe Trench 1, as described and illustrated by Mariah Associates archeologists
in 1993 (Quigg and Ellis 1994:231, Figure 8.14), revealed the following general
stratigraphic zones in the Feature 2 mound (see Figure 7.1):
•
•

•

•

Zone 1: A cover of eolian deposits 5–10-cm thick. Dark brown (10YR 4/2) fine
sandy loam.
Zone 2: Burned rock midden deposits, varying in thickness. Very dark, grayish
brown (10YR 3.2) sandy loam with abundant burned limestone clasts. Black
(10YR 2/1) sandy loam was observed in a central rock-free area between Test
Pits 1 and 2.
Zone 3: A sandstone saprolite, with alternating bands of white (10YR 8/2) to
yellow (10YR 8/6) sand. Remnant clasts of intact Paluxy Formation sandstone
are suspended in the yellow sand.
Basal zone: At the base of these unconsolidated sediments is a layer of
weathered but intact Paluxy Formation sandstone.

Following the reexcavation of Backhoe Trench 1, PAI and TAMU archeologists
observed that the bands of white sediment appear to be redeposited highly weathered
clasts of Walnut Clay limestone washed in from upslope, a phenomenon that has
been noted at other Paluxy sites (Kibler 1999:55). The alternating banding probably

Chapter 7

represents interspersed deposits of Paluxy sand and Walnut Clay sediments
deposited in sheetwash episodes of different intensities. Low-velocity rainfall events
would move only fine particles, but high-velocity episodes would easily move larger
clasts of weathered limestone and standstone.
Cultural Features
The features at 41CV594 were investigated to obtain macrobotanical and
plant microfossil samples, and these samples are described in more detail later in
this report. Table 7.1 summarizes the data for the two burned rock mounds (Features
1 and 2) and the eight subfeatures within these mounds.
Feature 1 Mound and Subfeature 1A
Feature 1 is the burned rock mound located in the northwestern portion
of the site (see Figure 7.2). The mound is covered with trees and shrubs, but the
upslope eastern half of the mound appears to be more intact while the downslope
western half appears to be more eroded and probably disturbed by military vehicle
traffic. This was not a major focus of the site investigations, but two short backhoe
trenches were excavated to test this mound feature.
Backhoe Trenches 3 and 4 were excavated in the eastern half of the mound
and well under the tree cover over the mound. Trench 3 revealed only a few
scattered burned rocks in the upper 15 cm of sediment and only a thin deposit of
sandy sediment over weathered Paluxy Formation sandstone. There was no organic
(dark) staining of the sediment. Trench 4 exposed a thicker deposit of burned rocks
and dark-stained midden soils, along with Feature 1A in the western end of the
trench. Feature 1A is a large intrusive pit feature, with the pit fill consisting of of
very dark gray, organic-rich sediment and scattered burned rocks. This feature was
exposed in the both north and south walls of the trench, and it appears to be an
oval or circular earth oven within the Feature 1 mound (Figure 7.4). It covers an
area of ca. 160 cm north to south by 70 cm east to west, with an unknown amount
of the feature remaining intact to the east and west. The feature fill is at least 40 to
50 cm thick and ranges in elevation from 99.97 to 100.50 m. Two sediment samples
taken from the pit fill of Feature 1A were floated and yielded charred oak wood
(see Appendix B). Four microfossil rock samples were taken but were not analyzed.
Feature 2 Mound and Subfeatures 2A–2G
Feature 2, the burned rock mound in the east-central portion of the site, was
intensively investigated. Two long backhoe trenches were dug forming a T-shaped
exposure through the oval, 10x13-m mound (Figure 7.5). Eight subfeatures were
identified within this mound, and they are designated Features 2A–2G (see Figure
7.3 and Table 7.1). From these features, sediment samples were taken for flotation
(see Appendix B) and burned rock samples were taken for microfossil analyses (see
Appendix C). The botanical remains recovered from these features are discussed in
more detail in Chapters 9–15.

exposures. Based on its cross section, the Feature 2A rock concentration measures
ca. 200 cm north-south and is ca. 25 to 30 cm thick, although it varies in elevation
from 99.80 to 100.23 m. Based on its cross section, Feature 2B measures ca. 200 cm
from north-south and extended at least 100 cm east-west (in old Test Pit 2). The
Feature 2B burned rock concentration is ca. 40 cm thick in the north and south

walls of the test pit, but its elevation ranges from 99.94 to 100.60 m. Both features
are comprised of fairly large angular fire-cracked limestone rocks embedded in a
darker organic-rich sediment with occasional charcoal flecking. Features 2A and
2B are both interpreted as earth oven pits that contain some in situ burned rocks
from the oven heating element that were left in place or thrown back into the pits
immediately after their last cooking episodes.
The 1993 excavation by Mariah Associates archeologists exposed a large
portion of Feature 2B in Test Pit 2, but it was considered to be general midden
deposit and was not recognized as a discrete subfeature at the time. As mentioned
earlier in this chapter, three radiocarbon dates were obtained on charcoal from this
test pit (see Table 3.3). Excluding the one modern date on charcoal from the upper
deposits, the other two dates are important for understanding Feature 2B, but they
are stratigraphically reversed. The older date of 3255–2879 b.c. is on charcoal from
30–40 cm, while the younger date of 2882–2463 b.c. is on charcoal from 50–60 cm.
These dates indicate that the jumbled midden deposits that were thrown back into
the Feature 2B pit after the last earth oven cooking episode came from previous
cooking episodes that dated between ca. 3300 and 2400 b.c.

Feature 2C was the most intensively investigated subfeature within the
burned rock mound. It was initially discovered in the 1993 testing, when a horizontal
layer of large “burned rock slabs” was noted in the south wall of Test Pit 1 (see Figure
7.1, bottom). During the 2011 investigations, Test Pit 1 was cleaned out to reveal
the intact remnants of this feature, and Backhoe Trench 2 was carefully excavated
from the surface of the mound down to the top of the burned rocks (see Figure 7.5b).
Hand excavations were then undertaken to expose and examine Feature 2C. Test
Unit 3 was excavated south of Test Pit 1, exposing a pit-bottom lining of large slabs
across most of the unit (Figure 7.7a). Test Unit 4 was then excavated to the west of
Test Unit 3, exposing a continuous layer of large slabs across this unit. Test Unit
4 was extended another 30 cm to the west, where the western edge of Feature 2C
was encountered (Figure 7.7b).
Feature 2C is a large basin-shaped pit with an in situ bottom lining of
burned rocks inside. The rock concentration extends ca. 230 cm from east to west,
and is at least 85 cm from north to south, noting that the northern end may have
been disturbed and the southern portion of the feature remains intact in the south
wall of Test Unit 4. The Feature 2C rocks extend vertically for ca. 40 cm, ranging
in elevation from about 100.15 to 100.56 m. The slabs comprising this massive
layer are significantly larger than any of the burned rocks observed in all the other
subfeatures and general midden deposits. Many of the individual rocks are more
than 25 cm in maximum length. While a few were heat-fractured in place, most of
the large slabs were intact.
Two radiocarbon dates have a bearing on the interpretation of Feature 2C
(see Table 3.3). Charcoal recovered from the 1993 Test Pit 1 was dated at a.d. 410–
660, and this sample came from the midden soil directly above the bottom slab
layer (see Figure 7.1, bottom). Charcoal was also recovered from below the large
burned rock slabs, and one piece was radiocarbon-dated to 760–410 b.c. It is quite
possible that each of these dates approximates the age of a different use episode
that occurred late in the overall lifespan of the burned rock mound. The older date
may represent the age of the last burned rock slab lining that was left in place after
a cooking episode. Separated by at least 800 years, the younger date may represent
one of the last cooking episodes that occurred inside this central earth oven; this later
oven pit was shallower and did not disturb the older oven bed. This interpretation
is supported by evidence from the excavation of the central earth oven pit at central
earth oven pit at 41CV984 (see Chapter 4). The central oven had multiple layers of
rock, separated by sediments, and each rock layer represents a remnant pit lining
associated with a different earth oven cooking episode. Thus, it is likely that the
dated charcoal from below the Feature 2C slab lining represents an earlier earth
oven pit, while the charcoal from above the lining represents a later cooking episode
in a shallower pit that did not disturb the older pit lining.
Feature 2C is interpreted as a very large earth oven cooking facility with a
thick remnant of its original basal heating element left largely intact since its final
cooking episode. It is suspected that the overall pit was generally round or oval in
shape, and it was at least 230 cm wide, perhaps more. Despite excavating a large
portion of Feature 2C, the original size and shape of this earth oven is not certain.

The eastern edge of the feature was encountered in Test Unit 3 and Test Pit 1, but
the other edges of the feature are less certain. The feature rocks extend into the south
wall of Test Unit 4 (see Figure 7.8b), and this portion of the feature was left in situ.
In addition, the northern and western edges of the feature had been truncated by
soldiers digging foxholes in the top of the mound (Figure 7.9). Remnants of canvas
sandbag were found in one of the foxholes, and three brass .30-caliber cartridge cases
were found in another area. The latter had markings indicating manufacture in 1943,

and were probably surplus ammunition from World War II. The foxholes observed by
PAI archeologists were a continuation of the foxhole disturbances previously noted
in Test Pit 1 by Mariah archeologists in 1993. The foxholes in and around Test Pit
1 were more than 50 cm deep from the original ground surface.
The large slabs comprising Feature 2C represent an intentionally prepared
heating element of an earth oven as described ethnographically by Ellis (1994). In
this case, there is no doubt that the rock lining was left in place in the bottom of an
earth oven pit after a cooking use episode (see Figure 13.1a). In their recent article
on “Hunter-Gatherer Earth Ovens in the Archeological Record,” Black and Thoms
(2014:Figure 8) show a photograph of Feature 2C at 41CV594 as a classic example of
a large intact earth oven heating element. As a large slab-lined earth oven heating
element, Feature 2C shares many characteristics with the two large earth ovens

excavated at the Firebreak site (41CV595), another Fort Hood Paluxy sites located
along Stampede Creek (see Features 11 and 15 in Mehalchick et al. 2004:95–100).
Features 2D and 2E are large earth ovents that were exposed in the west wall
of Backhoe Trench 1, in the northern half of the trench (Figure 7.10). Both features
were only observed in profile and appear to be shallow pits that are generally basin
shaped but with undulating bottoms. Both contain dense burned rocks embedded in
darker organic-rich sediment. The upper rocks are undoubtedly disturbed to some
extent, but the lower half of the feature fill is undisturbed and contains larger rocks
and several large slabs that are fire-cracked in situ. Feature 2D measures ca. 175 cm
north-south, but its southern end may have been truncated by the excavation of the
old army foxhole. The Feature 2D rock concentration is ca. 45 cm thick, extending
from 100.20 to 100.65 m. Feature 2E measures ca. 160 cm north-south, and its rock
concentration is 35 cm thick, extending from 100.30 to 100.65 m.
Features 2F and 2G were exposed in the north wall of Backhoe Trench 2
(Figure 7.11). These features were only investigated in the trench cross section,
so only one horizontal dimension and the vertical extent of each feature is known.
Feature 2F is a large, basin-shaped, rock-filled pit. The burned rocks are embedded
in a lens of gray carbon-stained sediment with some charcoal flecking observed.
The pit measures ca. 230 cm from east-to-west, and has an unusual V-shape rather
than the more typical U-shape. The burned rock concentration is about 66 cm thick
from top to bottom, ranging from 100.04 to 100.70 m in elevation. However, the very
bottom of the pit appears to extend another 10 cm below the rock concentration (at
about 99.94 m), and this lower section contains a vertical limestone rock embedded
in dark organic-stained sediment with charcoal flecking. Feature 2F is interpreted
as a large earth oven, but it is not clear what the vertical rock at the bottom of the
pit may represent or if it is associated with the cooking feature at all. It is likely that
most of the large angular rocks in this pit represent the original heating element
in the earth oven, although some portion of the rock fill may be debris from other
cooking features that was dumped into an open pit.
The cross section of Feature 2G revealed another large, basin-shaped pit
containing a dense concentration of burned rocks embedded in dark carbon-stained
sediments with occasional pieces of charcoal. The pit measures ca. 210 cm wide from
east to west, but the excavation of the old army foxhole may have truncated the
eastern end of the feature. The rock concentration is ca. 45 cm thick in the center,
extending from about 100.25 to 100.70 cm. The density of burned rocks is greatest
in the lower central area, and the burned rocks are less dense toward the lateral
edges of the pit.
Cultural Materials
Chert artifacts and burned rocks may be observed on the surface in many
areas of 41CV594, but the overall density of materials is quite low. Only seven
items were collected during the investigations, as summarized in Table 7.2. One is
an expanding-stem dart point fragment, similar to the Ensor or Edgewood types
(see Figure 3.1a and Table 3.2) that was found on the surface about 40 m north of

Summary of Interpretations for 41CV594
Site 41CV594 is a fairly large Paluxy site, but all of the archeological
excavations have focused on two burned rock mounds, with no substantive work
being done in the intervening areas. Burned rock mound Feature 1 measures ca.
22x16 m, but its size is poorly defined, and the mound deposits may have been
dispersed by vehicle traffic and erosion. One earth oven (Feature 1A) was found
within this mound, and it is not centrally located inside the mound area. Additional

123

124

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

excavations in mound Feature 1 might locate additional earth ovens as in mound
Feature 2. No radiocarbon dates were obtained for this mound or the earth oven
within it.
The 1993 testing and the 2011 investigations both focused on burned rock
mound Feature 2. Four charcoal radiocarbon dates were obtained for charcoal
recovered from the 1993 Test Pits 1 and 2 (see Table 3.3), and three of these dates
indicate occupations spanning from 3255 b.c. to a.d. 660 (discounting the late date
that may represent modern charcoal or contamination). Two dates from Test Pit
2 place the approximate age of the midden debris used to backfill the Feature 2B
earth oven pit at ca. 3300 to 2400 b.c. A new radiocarbon date was obtained on
charcoal from Feature 2C, the well-defined earth oven located near the center of
mound Feature 2. The charcoal came from below the large burned rock slabs lining
the bottom of the oven pit, and it indicates that this final cooking episode occurred
between 760 and 410 b.c. Collectively, these dates indicate intermittent use of the
Feature 2 mound over a period of at least 3,000 to 4,000 years.
The intensive investigations of mound Feature 2 were surprising in one
respect. There were at least seven earth ovens within this relatively small burned
rock mound, and a few more might be discovered if additional excavations were
undertaken. Assuming that all of the subfeatures do indeed represent individual
earth oven pits, then this mound is an accumulation of fire-cracked rocks generated
by earth ovens randomly dug throughout the mound as it evolved. Clearly, this mound
feature departs from Black and Creel’s (1997:295) model of a “classic Central Texas
burned rock midden.” Despite having the morphological attributes of a circular
mounded deposit of fire-cracked rocks, the mound Feature 2 at 41CV594 did not
originate from a single central earth oven.
One of the earth ovens, Feature 2C, is different from the rest. It is a large
basin-shaped oven, with a flat bottom lined with very large limestone slabs. This
oven is disturbed, but was originally at least 2.3 m in diameter, and there is no
doubt that this slab layer represents the remnant bottom lining of an earth oven
that was left in place after the last cooking episode. In comparison, the other
subfeatures are unlined, basin-shaped earth oven pits filled with a jumbled matrix
of smaller and more angular fire-cracked rocks. In each of these subfeatures, the
original pits may have been dug to serve as earth ovens or perhaps dug as borrow
pits to obtain soil for covering over other earth ovens during cooking episode. In
any case, most of the larger rocks near the bottoms of these pits are interpreted
as remnants of the heating element that was disturbed at the conclusion of the
last cooking episode.
It is tempting to explain the proliferation of earth ovens within the Feature
2 mound as a logical response to the regular creation of borrow pits. Leach and
Bousman (1998:126–135, Figure 7.3) proposed a model of earth oven cooking and
midden formation that includes extensive digging and backfilling of borrow pits
around a central earth oven. As the earth oven is reused many times, the discarded
residue accumulates as a burned rock mound or midden that may be characterized
as a complex “anthropomantle” (Leach and Bousman (1998:134–135). The repeated

Chapter 7

constructing, firing, and dismantling of earth ovens is a continual process that adds
to the accumulation of burned rock midden debris at the same time that it disturbs
the previous midden and natural sediment deposits around the oven. Through these
repeated activities and through subsequent postdepositional modifications, the
evidence of fill borrowing gets obscured or obliterated within burned rock mound and
midden sites. It its notable that the Feature 2 mound at 41CV594 has six unlined
earth ovens that occur within various sizes of pits that were dug into the natural
sandy sediments. If these were originally dug as borrow pits to provide fill to cover
other earth ovens, the open pits would then become enticing spots for locating the
next earth oven.
In Paluxy sites, it is admittedly difficult to find definitive evidence of in
situ burning associated with earth ovens, even when dealing with large slab-lined
ovens in which there is no doubt intensive heating occurred within the pit. Unlike
clayey soils in alluvial sites, the sandy Paluxy sediments do not exhibit any obvious
attributes of in situ burning. Even in cases in which earth oven beds are composed of
large slabs sitting on a layer of charcoal and dark sediment, the underlying Paluxy
sediments exhibit no definite evidence of heat oxidation. This is true for Feature
2C at 41CV594 and for two large earth ovens (Features 11 and 15) found at the
Firebreak site (Mehalchick et al. 2004:95–100).
It is possible that burned rock mound Feature 2 at 41CV594 is a
multifunctional cooking facility, and that it may have been used in different ways
depending on the occasion and how many people were involved. Perhaps the unlined
earth ovens represent family and multifamily ovens and the larger central earth oven
was a communal feature used by the larger group or band. It is not unreasonable to
suggest that small- and medium-sized ovens were constructed differently than the
larger communal ovens. If the central oven of the mound was reserved for communal
feasting events, its construction may have been more formalized and ceremonial.
Mitchell (2008) argues that larger earth burned rock middens on the Great Plains
were places where people returned repeated over long periods of time to construct
large earth ovens for communal feasting. For these sites, he notes that “As the number
of uses increased, the power of these places to invoke particular social relations and
cultural meanings also increased” (Mitchell 2008:58). Some archeologist have argued
that the social aspects of communal earth oven cooking and burned rock middens
are being overlooked in central Texas (e.g., Black and Thoms 2014:222; Boyd et al.
2014:149–152; Mehalchick et al. 2008:367–368).
Site 41CV594 still contains many portions of intact features within the
two burned rock mounds since most of the small burned rock features were only
partially excavated to examine vertical profile exposures. Even Feature 2C, the large
earth oven investigated with three 1x1-m units, has a large portion still intact (see
Figure 7.8b). Consequently, the burned rock mound features at 41CV594 retain a
high archeological research potential and are still eligible for listing on the National
Register of Historic Places. The potential for recovery of significant archeological
data in the off-mound areas at 41CV594 has not been evaluated.

National Register Assessment of 41CV594
It is recommended that 41CV594 remains eligible for listing on the National
Register of Historic Places. The investigations included mechanical trenching of two
burned rock mounds and hand excavations of portions of several internal features
within one of the mounds. Trenching of a portion of mound Feature 1 revealed sparse
burned rocks and no internal features, and no further work was done. Re-excavation
of an old backhoe trench and excavation of a new backhoe trench at mound Feature
2 led to the discovery of seven earth ovens (Features 2A to 2G) within the mound.
Of these, Feature 2C was substantially excavated, while all of the others were only
profiled and microfossil samples were taken. It appears that the tested portion of
mound Feature 1 has little or no research potential, but the western portion of the
mound has not been adequately tested. Mound Feature 2 is more than 50 percent
intact, and six of the earth ovens are partially intact; more intact earth ovens could
be present in uninvestigated parts of this mound. The archeological potential of the
off-mound areas has not been adequately investigated. The previously defined site
boundary for 41CV594 remains unchanged.
Investigations at 41cv947
Site Setting
Site 41CV947 is on the north side of Cowhouse Creek on the slopes of
Williamson Mountain, about 2 km south of Williamson Mountain and 2 km north
of Cowhouse Creek. It is on a gentle west-facing slope just south and west of an
unnamed tributary of Cowhouse. The site is located about 500 m southwest of the
intersection of Old Georgetown Road and Manning Mountain Road, in Training Area
43. Several well-traveled tank trails bisect the site, and some areas are barren of
vegetation while other areas are covered with tree motts of oak, elm, juniper, and
mesquite, and a dense undergrowth of shrubs and vines. Site elevation ranges from
250–268 m (820–880 ft) above mean sea level, and it is 0–18 m (0–60 ft) above the
unnamed tributary.
Previous Investigations
Site 41CV947 was recorded in April 1985 by Texas A&M University
archeologists (41CV947 site form, Texas Archeological Sites Atlas). The principal
feature was a 10x40-m burned rock midden that paralleled the terrace edge. This
feature had been disturbed by vehicle traffic, and one of the tracks exposed a profile
of the midden deposits. Across the rest of the site, they observed concentrations and
scatters of burned rocks, unmodified debitage, and some bifaces. Two untyped dart
points were surface collected. An estimated 50 percent of the site was disturbed by
slope erosion and vehicle traffic (Kleinbach et al. 1999:59).
Archeologists from Mariah Associates investigated 41CV947 in November
1992 and again in December (Trierweiler, ed. 1994:A1107–A1109; also see Kleinbach
et al. 1999:59–60). They observed that the site was in weathered Paluxy Formation
sands and redeposited sands derived from the Paluxy outcrop. They noted steep
slopes of erosion-resistant Walnut Clay limestones above the Paluxy deposits and

Chapter 7

Glen Rose limestones below. In tank trail road cuts, they observed varying soil profiles
in the redeposited Paluxy sands (A-C, A-Bw-C, and A-Bw-2Ab onsite and A-Bw-Bt-C
offsite). They documented several shallowly buried burned rock features and part
of a burned rock midden in the A and Bw soil horizons, along with lithic tools, chert
debitage, and mussel shells. They estimated the site size to be 200x150 m. Despite
impacts from slope erosion and military vehicle traffic, they estimated that much
of the site’s archeological deposits were undisturbed.
Returning a month later, Mariah archeologists excavated 20 shovel tests
across the site on December 8, 1992. Twelve (60 percent) of the shovel tests produced
lithic artifacts and burned rocks from the surface to 50 cm, with most cultural
materials concentrated at 10–20 cm. An untyped arrow point was found in one of
the shovel tests. Noting that the site contained intact cultural deposits, the Mariah
team recommended site testing to determine its National Register eligibility.
Prewitt and Associates, Inc., archeologists conducted the National Register
testing at 41CV947 in June 1996, and the results are reported by Kleinbach et al.
(1999:59–65). The work consisted of mechanical excavation of a 22-m-long backhoe
trench and hand excavation of three 1x1-m units (see Kleinbach et al. 1999:Figure
13). The trench exposed burned rock lenses and sparse lithic artifacts at depths of
45, 60, and 90 cm below surface, and charcoal was collected from 42–46 cm.
The three test units were all within 35 m of each other. Units 1 and 2 were
adjacent to the backhoe trench and dug to 110 to 140 cm below surface. Unit 3 was
isolated near a two-track road and dug to 60 cm. Burned rocks, unmodified debitage,
and mussel shells were recovered from all three units, and chipped stone tools were
found in the two units along the backhoe trench. The cultural materials were most
concentrated between 20–40 cm in Test Unit 1. Cultural materials in Test Unit 2
were most concentrated between 10–90 cm, but were also present from 90–130 cm.
In Test Unit 3, all cultural materials were found between 10–40 cm.
Three burned rock features were identified and documented in these test
units. A dense layer of burned rocks and artifacts from 10 to 32 cm in Unit 3 was
designated Feature 1 and was interpreted as an intact buried occupation zone. A
burned rock concentration from 36 to 58 cm in Test Unit 1 was interpreted as an
intact hearth designated Feature 2. Feature 3 was a dense layer of cultural materials
from 60 to 90 cm in Test Unit 3, and it was interpreted as an occupation zone that
could be traced in the walls of the backhoe trench for over 7 m. Sediment flotation
yielded charred wood associated with Features 1 and 2, and radiocarbon assays
on two samples yielded the following conventional radiocarbon ages and 2-sigma
calibrated dates (see Table 3.3; Kleinbach et al. 1999:62, Tables 83, 101):

The PAI investigations in 1996 concluded that 41CV947 contained intact
cultural features and occupation remains that were buried in the Paluxy deposits and
dated to the Late Archaic period. It was recommended that the site was eligible for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places (Kleinbach et al. 1999:65, Table 96).

Current Investigations
PAI archeologists returned to 41CV947 in 2011. The work consisted of
a mechanical search for buried features suitable for macrobotanical and plant
microfossil sampling. Kibler directed the investigation, and a backhoe was used to
dig four trenches (designated Backhoe Trenches 2–5) and for horizontal scraping.
The trenches confirmed that the cultural remains at this site were shallowly buried,
primarily in the upper 50 cm of deposits. The backhoe scraping removed 10–15 cm
of organic topsoil over a large irregular-shaped area ca. 25 m east-west by 10 m
north-south. This horizontal stripping was effective in locating the tops of several
features, which appeared to be discrete clusters of intact burned rocks. The scraped
area and backhoe trenches were left open, and the features were covered with plastic
and sediment to protect them.
PAI and TAMU archeologists returned to 41CV947 to conduct the intensive
feature investigations from March 11–14, 2011, with Boyd and Thoms directing this
work. Each covered feature was reexposed, and the surrounding area was troweled
to define its full horizontal extent. Five discrete clusters were designated Features
4–9, and pairs of archeologists were assigned to investigate each feature. Two 1996
datum points were re-located, some new permanent datum points were established.
A Sokkia total station was used to map the area topography, the locations of the
backhoe trenches, the extent of the horizontal scrape, and the locations of cultural
features and test units. Figure 7.12 is a map of the investigation area at 41CV947,
showing the area topography, the excavations, and the investigated features. The
site elevation is relative to an arbitrary 100.00 m point.
All of the investigated features were clustered in one area of the site, in
close proximity to Backhoe Trenches 2 and 3 and the east end of Backhoe Trench
1 (Figure 7.13). This work included hand excavation various sized units laid out
around the features to maintain horizontal control for feature mapping.
Sediments and Stratigraphy
The stratigraphy of Backhoe Trench 1 revealed a sandy Holocene colluvium
imprinted with two soils that vary in thickness and degree of soil development from
upslope to downslope (Kleinbach et al. 1999:60, Figure 14, Appendix B). In the middle
of the trench, the modern soil that has formed at the top of the late-Holocene-age
alluvium consists of a very dark grayish brown loamy find sand A horizon at 0–30 cm
over a strong grown sandy clay loam C horizon at 30–134 cm). This late Holocene
colluvial unit overlies an earlier Holocene colluvial unit from 134–149+ cm. The lower
unit is a brown to dark brown sandy loam that is imprinted with a 2Ab horizon, and
it that contains many rounded sandstone fragments. This indicates that this unit is
composed of a combination of weathered Paluxy sands and larger clasts of Paluxy
sandstone that washed in at the same time the sands were deposited.
Cultural Features
The features at 41CV947 were investigated specifically to obtain
macrobotanical and plant microfossil samples, and these efforts are described in more

Feature 4
Feature 4 was first encountered in the north wall of Backhoe Trench 2, and
a 50x100-cm unit was excavated along the north wall to expose the feature in plan
view (Figure 7.15). An unknown portion of the feature was removed by the backhoe,
while the intact portion consisted of ca. 16 burned limestone rocks (total weight

by 32 cm north-south, and the rocks formed a single layer (with a few small rocks
overlapping) concentrated between 98.07 and 97.97 m (23 to 33 cm below surface).
Feature 4 is classified as a flat-bottom burned rock concentration rather than
an earth oven. The complete feature was most likely circular or oval in shape, and no
evidence of an actual pit was observed. Only one small piece of charcoal was collected
(from upper rocks at 98.05 m), but no dark-stained sediment was observed. No hint
of thermal discoloration was observed in the sediment below the rocks. One flotation
sample was processed, but it did not yield any charred materials and was not sent

for analysis. Two tertiary chert
flakes (1 Fort Hood Yellow and 1
gray) and one chert chunk (gray)
were found in the sediment
around the feature, but these
unassociated items were not
collected. Microfossil samples
were taken, and the archeological
excavations essentially removed
all of Feature 4.
Feature 5
Feature 5 was first
observed as a few scattered
burned rocks during the shallow
backhoe scraping. The scraping
was immediately halted in
this area, and archeologists
a
returned later to conduct hand
excavations over an area of
more than 4 square meters.
The horizontal extent of the
feature was fully exposed, with
the tops of the rocks being
between 99.76 and 99.70 m, and
it appeared as a large circular
concentration of burned rocks
and dark-stained sediment
(Figure 7.16a). The feature was
mapped and photographed at
this stage, and then a 50-cmwide trench was excavated

140 cm east-west by 155 cm
north-south, but its edges were not perfectly clear. One disturbed area with several
modern tree roots was observed just beyond the southeast edge of this feature.
The cross-section trench was excavated to a maximum depth of 99.50 m,
and its north wall roughly bisected the center of the feature. This profile exposed
a continuous bottom rock layer, dark-stained sediment, and charcoal flecking
concentrated in the central portion of the feature (Figures 7.16b, c). The rock layer
is composed of one to three stacked rocks of varying sizes. Some of the larger rocks
(over 20 cm in maximum size) are fire-cracked slabs, but most are intact smaller

cobbles with rounded edges. Based on the observed horizontal and vertical extent
of the burned rocks and dark-stained sediments, it is estimated that the excavation
of this trench removed about 40 percent of the feature, and that the complete earth
oven pit was about 110 cm in diameter. The weight of the Feature 5 burned rocks
removed from the excavated portion is 55.9 kg, so the total weight of all the burned
rocks is estimated to be 139.8 kg.
The bottom of the cross-section trench ended in the upper part of a lower
cultural zone, with scattered burned rocks and dark-stained sediment. This lower
zone definitely predates Feature 5, but time did not permit additional excavations
in this component. The scattered burned rocks that were found below Feature 5
weighed 15 kg. Some of these rocks were collected as microfossil samples.
The Feature 5 profile was documented with measured drawings and
photographs. At the conclusion of the work, Feature 5 and the cross-section trench
were lined with clear plastic and backfilled for protection, leaving an estimated
60 percent of this feature still intact.
Feature 5 is interpreted as a basin-shaped, slab-lined earth oven. The
charcoal, which was best preserved among and underneath the rock layer, and the
dark-stained sediment are indicative of in situ burning and fairly rapid burial after
the last cooking episode. The flotation samples (see Appendix B) yielded charred
wood identified as ash, live oak, white oak, and unidentified hardwood, along
with charred unidentified tuber fragments representing overcooked food remains.
Charred pecan nutshell fragments could represent fuel, while the other unidentified
charred botanicals could be fuel, food, or oven-packing materials. Beside the flotation
sample recovery, 12 piece-plotted charcoal samples were taken, and all of these were
identified as oak wood (see Appendix B). Two samples of oak charcoal from Feature
5 were submitted to Beta Analytic, Inc. for radiocarbon dating (see Table 3.3). The
two samples yielded the following dates:
Beta 343285 1170±30 b.p. a.d. 780–900 and 920–970
Beta 343286 1050±30 b.p. a.d. 900–920 and 970–1020
These two dates indicate that the Feature 5 earth oven was used sometime
between a.d. 780 and 1020, during the Austin Phase In the beginning of the Late
Prehistoric period.
Some lithic artifacts were observed and collected from Feature 5 (see
Cultural Materials below). Nine items were observed in the surrounding fill but
not collected, and 29 flakes were collected from a sediment flotation sample. None
of these materials are considered to be functionally associated with the Feature 5
earth oven.
One notable find from Feature 5 is a complete Pedernales dart point found
underneath the bottom layer of burned rocks and in the lower cultural zone (see white
arrow in Figure 7.16c). It was oriented in a vertical position with its tip pointing
downwards. Several scattered limestone rocks were found at about the same level,
but they were lying horizontal and are part of the lower cultural zone that predates
Feature 5. It is possible that the dart point predates Feature 5 and is not associated
with this earth oven. However, its unusual vertical orientation and its location under

Figure 7.17

the center of the slab-lined pit
suggest that it could have been
temporally and functionally
associated. It is possible that
the point was placed there
intentionally as some type of
ritual offering, perhaps just
prior to the construction and
firing of the earth oven. The
point could have been attached
to a wooden shaft or foreshaft
that shoved vertically into the
ground while the earth oven
was being constructed, while
the oven was being fired, or
just before the food was placed
inside and the oven was capped.
It could also have been placed
there after the food was removed
and at the time the oven was
abandoned.

Feature 6
Feature 6 was first
observed as a few burned rocks
in the backhoe scrape just north
of Backhoe Trench 3. Subsequent
hand excavation (100x75 cm)
exposed a discrete cluster of
burned rocks from 98.37 to
98.28 m (ca. 15 to 24 cm below
surface). The cluster consisted
of 13 burned rocks weighing
8.25 kg, and was confined to an
area ca. 60x50 cm (Figure 7.17).

Feature 6 is classified as
a fire-cracked rock concentration
rather than an earth oven. The rocks formed a single layer, with only one of the larger
rocks fractured in place, but there was no discernible pattering in the placement of
the rocks. There was no evidence of a pit, and no associated dark-stained sediment
or charcoal was observed. One flotation sample was taken, but it yielded no charred
remains. Numerous microfossil samples were taken from Feature 6, and the
archeological excavation essentially removed most of this feature. No lithic artifacts
were observed or collected from the Feature 6 excavation.

Features 7 and 9
Features 7 and 9 are described and illustrated together because of their
close proximity (Figure 7.18). Burned rocks were encountered in the west end of
Backhoe Trench 3, and hand scraping and troweling of a large horizontal area
at this end revealed a concentration of burned rocks that was originally thought
to be a single large feature. A first cross-section trench was excavated, running
northwest to southeast through the large burned rock concentration. This trench
exposed the feature rocks in Profile A, and a measured drawing was made and
photographs were taken. The cross-section trench was then expanded 35 cm farther
to the southwest, with its western edge cutting more or less through the center of
the large concentration. This second cross section was called Profile B, and it was
also documented with a measured drawing and photographs. Flotation sediment
samples were taken from each cross-section trench, and burned rock and sediment
samples were taken from each profile for microfossil reocovery.
Both of these cross-section profiles revealed that the large burned rock

7.18b–d). Feature 7 was assigned to the southeastern feature, and Feature 9 was
assigned to the northwestern feature. Both features are interpreted as intact basinshaped earth ovens, but the jumbled rocks suggest that these pit bottoms were not
neatly lined with rocks. The dark-stained feature fill in Feature 7 was very dark
grayish brown (10YR 3/2) to dark brown (10YR 3.4) fine sandy loam, in contrast to
the surrounding and underlying dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) to brown (7.5YR
5/4) sandy clay loam. The Feature 8 fill, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/6) fine sandy
loam, was not as dark.
Table 7.4 presents a comparison of attributes of Features 7 and 9. Relatively
speaking, Feature 7 is much larger than Feature 9. For both of the features, the
larger excavated burned rocks were counted and measured individually, and the
total weight of burned rocks was recorded. These data show that Feature 7 is

composed of much larger and thicker limestone slabs, and it is larger in diameter,
thicker overall, and contains more burned rocks. All of this evidence simply implies
that Feature 7 was probably used to cook more food, perhaps as much as 25 percent
more food, than Feature 9.
Flotation samples from Feature 9 did not yield any charred remains, and
a flotation sample from Feature 7 yielded charred live oak wood but no charred
remains indicative of potential food plants or oven-packing material (see Appendix
B). Four unmodified flakes were observed during the Feature 7 excavation, but
these items are not considered to be functionally associated with this earth oven
(see Cultural Materials below).

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

Numerous microfossil samples were taken from Features 7 and 9, and at
the conclusion of this work, the remaining portions of these features were lined
with clear plastic and the excavations were backfilled. It is estimated that at least
50 percent of each feature may remain intact.
Feature 8
Feature 8 was first observed as a few scattered rocks in the backhoe scraping
south of and near the east end of Backhoe Trench 3. Subsequent hand excavation of
an irregular area covering about 4 square meters completely exposed the Feature
8 burned rocks (Figure 7.19). A single layer of scattered rocks was spread over an
area of ca. 130x120 cm and were within a 13-cm-thick zone from 98.45 to 98.32 m.
There was no apparent evidence of in situ burning, and no dark-stained sediments
or charcoal were observed.
Feature 8 is classified as a fire-cracked rock concentration rather than an
earth oven. A flotation sample from the feature fill yielded no charred remains. Four
lithic artifacts were observed during the excavation of the Feature 8 area, but they
are not considered to be functionally associated and were not collected (see Cultural
Materials below). At the end of the site investigation, the remaining portions of
Feature 8 were left in situ, covered with clear plastic, and covered with fill.
Cultural Materials
Many chert flakes, scattered burned rocks, and some mussel shell fragments
were observed during the mechanical scraping and hand excavations to investigate
features. These items are not considered to be functionally associated with any of
the burned rock features, however, and they were not collected. All observed artifacts
are discussed earlier with their respective features.
Only 30 items were collected during the investigations, all of them found in or
around Feature 5 (Table 7.5). Additional materials were observed around Feature 5
but were not collected. Flotation Sample 4, from the upper part of Feature 5, yielded
28 unmodified flakes and 1 edge-modified flake tool.
The only other collected artifact, as mentioned earlier in the discussion of
Feature 5, was the Pedernales dart point found in the lower cultural zone underneath
the earth oven feature (see Table 3.2 and Figures 3.1b and 7.16c). It was found in
a vertical position, with its tip pointing downward, below the bottom rocks of this
earth oven. The context and orientation of the point suggest that it could have
been intentionally placed as part of some type of ritual. This specimen is made of
Edwards chert, but the chert type cannot be positively identified because one side
is heavily patinated and the other is moderately patinated. The point’s blade edges
are reworked slightly, and its distal tip (about 5 mm) is darker than the rest of the
point. This discoloration appears to be natural because there is no evidence that
the point tip was heated.

Summary of Interpretations for 41CV947
The investigations at 41CV947 focused on three fire-cracked rock
concentrations (Features 4, 6, and 8) and three earth ovens (Features 5, 7 and 9).
Feature 7 is the largest of the three earth ovens—almost as large as the two big earth
ovens (Features 11 and 15) excavated at the Firebreak site in 2000 (Mehalchick et al.
2004:7.12 to 7.14). Feature 5 was the most productive in terms of macrobotanical
recovery; it yielded pieces of charred unidentified tubers that represent some type
of geophyte that was being cooked in the oven. An unusual find at Feature 5 is a
complete Pedernales dart point that was found under the center of the earth oven
pit, oriented vertically with its tip pointing downward. Although there is no way to
know for sure, this object may represent some type of ritual offering associated with
earth oven cooking. Pedernales points generally date to the Late Archaic period,
between 3,200 and 2,500 years b.p. (according to Collins 1995:Table 2), but this age
does not correspond with the radiocarbon ages indicating that Feature 5 was used
around 1,200 to 1,000 b.p. This could indicate that the point was associated with
the lower component below Feature 5 but does not rule out the possibility that it
was picked up and used in a ritual context by later people.
National Register Assessment of 41CV947
It is recommended that 41CV947 remains eligible for listing on the National
Register of Historic Places. Site investigations started with shallow horizontal
machine scraping over an area approximately of 10x25 m. Six burned rock features
were discovered and partially investigated by hand excavations. Microfossil samples

Chapter 7

were extracted but some portions of each feature were left intact when the area was
backfilled. This work demonstrates that the potential is high for similar features in
other parts of this site. The previously defined site boundary for 41CV947 remains
unchanged.
It is, of course, impossible to know whether the dart point below Feature 5
represents a ritual item that had symbolic meaning related to earth oven cooking.
In many parts of the world, such as the Polynesian Islands, earth oven cooking
was generally a communal event accompanied by various rituals, although the
knowledge of many specific rituals has been lost (Carson 2002; Cox 1982; Ehrlich
2000). Archeologically, unusual caches of items found inside earth ovens have been
interpreted as ritual offerings. Binford (et al. 1970) reported two earth ovens with
ritual caches from a Mississippian site in Illinois. Found inside one deep earth
oven were “projectile points, an antler, a miniature pot, and a ‘charcoal drill shaft’ ”
(Binford et al. 1970:45). Another compound cooking pit had “a layer of midden fill
covered with a shell layer.…Underneath this shell layer was encountered a layer of
antlers, all tips removed, and some charred sherds concentrated near the antlers.
Among these antlers were also a clay pipe, a complete miniature pot, numerous
miniature potsherds, a ladle, and a figurine.” They inferred that these items “were
presumably utilized in ritual activity” (Binford et al. 1970:56) and were placed in the
ovens after they were used and the cooked contents had been removed. In contrast,
the projectile point associated with Feature 5 at 41CV947 may have been placed
there before the earth oven was constructed and fired.

Investigations at alluvial sites
41CV1104 and 41CV1657

Karl W. Kibler and Douglas K. Boyd

This chapter discusses the archeological investigations at two alluvial
sites: 41CV1104 and 41CV1657. They were selected for different reasons, but the
primary objective was to investigate and sample known burned rock features that
were already exposed in road cuts or creekbanks. As part of the overall objectives,
we wanted to examine some earth oven features in alluvial settings to see how the
samples and plant remains might be different from those recovered at Paluxy sites.
Site 41CV1104 was chosen for investigation in Phase II because it is in an area slated
for development. The army was planning to construct a more substantial tank trail
crossing over Two Year Old Creek, and the Fort Hood CRM program wanted PAI to
look at examine some of the burned rock features that are located in the probable
impact area.11 Site 41CV1657, herein named the Gully Mouth site, was selected
for limited testing in Phase I because the features were easily accessible and are
subject to damage from continued creek bank erosion. It is a small site consisting
of burned rock features exposed in a stream cutbank and recently discovered by
Fort Hood CRM personnel.
Investigations at 41CV1104
Site Setting
Site 41CV1104 is an open campsite on a Holocene terrace of Cowhouse Creek
at its confluence with Two Year Old Creek. The terrace surface stands about 7–8 m
above the channel of Cowhouse Creek. The site is bordered by Cowhouse Creek to
the west, Two Year Old Creek to the north, and the limestone valley wall to the
east. Vegetation includes juniper, live oak, hackberry, and deciduous oak with an
understory of various grasses and vines. Site size is estimated to be 275 m (south
to north) by 100–150 m (east to west). Site elevation is 226–232 m (740–760 ft)
above mean sea level.
Previous Investigations
Site 41CV1104 was recorded by Dureka (Texas A&M University [TAMU]) on
July 19, 1985 as a burned rock scatter with lithics (41CV1104 site form, on file at
The plan to expand this tank trail was shelved at the recommendation of Fort Hood CRM.
They are considering rerouting the tank trail to avoid impacting the site (Richard Jones, personal
communication 2015).

Fort Hood CRM program). Dart points, including a Frio and a Darl, were collected.
One biface, one ground stone tool, and a bone fragment were also collected. The
presence of other chipped and ground stone tools were noted, as well as moderate
amounts of debitage and burned rocks. It was also noted that 70 percent of the site
was disturbed due to bulldozing, vehicular traffic, road cuts, erosion, and vandalism.
Between September 1989 and July 1990, Nordt (1992) visited the site during
his study of the soils, alluvial stratigraphy, and depositional chronology of eight
streams, including the Cowhouse Creek, at Fort Hood. At 41CV1104, he recorded
a soil profile expressed in terrace alluvium and collected charcoal from a hearth
feature in the same profile. The charcoal yielded a radiocarbon age of 5210±230 b.p.
On October 14, 1992 Abbott and Kleinbach (Mariah Associates) visited
41CV1104 to reevaluate the site and its geomorphic context, and they revised the
site map and boundaries. They observed that the deeply stratified site consisted of
a number of discrete, well-preserved occupations within a complex assemblage of
sandy to loamy alluvial sediments that comprise a Holocene terrace of Cowhouse
Creek. Several burned rock features and at least one well-defined occupation surface
were observed at depths of up to 4 m in the tank trail cut that incises the terrace
and crosses Two Year Old Creek. Artifacts and features were also observed at
similar depths in the cutbanks of both Cowhouse Creek and Two Year Old Creek. In
addition to the deeply buried materials, burned rocks were observed scattered across
the terrace surface in many locations, though they had been subjected to various
disturbances. A close examination of the road cut revealed four zones of cultural
materials consisting of varying amounts of scattered burned rocks, burned rock
clusters, debitage, charcoal, and mussel shells, while a large burned rock midden
was exposed on the terrace surface. The road had bisected the midden, but contained
dense amounts of burned rocks and some flakes, bifaces, and mussel shells. A few
small, recent looter’s pits were observed in the burned rock midden.
Because intact cultural deposits were present, shovel testing was
recommended. On November 3, 1992 an archeological field crew visited the site, and
30 shovel tests were excavated (Trierweiler ed. 1994:A-1234 to A-1239). Ten of the
30 shovel tests yielded cultural materials, consisting of a Frio dart point, a modified
flake, 118 pieces of debitage, 2 pieces of bone, 3 mussel shell umbos, and 6 historic or
recent artifacts. Though there was evidence of vandalism and disturbance from the
road cut and natural erosion, it was noted that the site had considerable research
potential due to the presence of rich and diverse artifact and feature assemblages
within a series of discrete cultural deposits or occupation zones. Because of these
factors, 41CV1104 was judged to be significant and eligible for National Register
listing.
Current Investigations
The current investigations at site 41CV1104 were conducted on April 5–6,
2012. The site was chosen for investigation because several burned rock features
exposed in a tank trail cut might be impacted by a proposed road expansion project.
The tank trail runs from southeast to northwest across the Holocene alluvial terrace

Chapter 8

of Cowhouse Creek, and the north end of the trail crosses Two Year Old Creek
near its confluence with Cowhouse Creek. The exposed archeological remains in
this northern end of the site provided easy access to examine discrete features and
sample individual burned rocks for plant microfossil extraction without having to
excavate the features in traditional fashion.
The investigators first examined the road cut to identify burned rock features
suitable for sampling (Figure 8.1). Eight burned rock features were found, and only
four were selected for sampling. Features 1 and 2 were on the west side of the road
cut, and Features 3 and 4 were on the east side (Figure 8.2). Once the features were
selected, they were examined with minimal excavations. The deposits around the
features were shoveled or troweled vertically to expose a clean profile above and
below each feature. Photographs were taken, and cross-section profile sketches
were drawn. Charcoal samples were collected for radiocarbon dating and species
identification. Bulk sediment (feature fill) samples were collected for flotation, and
burned rocks were collected plant microfossil samples. A small portion of the site,
essentially everything within the road cut, was mapped with a Sokkia total station.
Many artifacts were observed on the ground surface and eroding out of the road
cuts, but only two dart points found in situ in the road cut.
Sediments and Stratigraphy
The sediments and stratigraphy at 41CV1104 were examined prior to
the current investigations by Nordt (1992) and Abbott and Kleinbach (Mariah
Associates). Nordt described the soil stratigraphy of a cutbank exposure (see CB12
in Nordt’s Figure 5) of terrace alluvium along Cowhouse Creek. The A-Bw-Bk-BC
soil profile was imprinted on the early to middle Holocene Fort Hood alluvial unit.
From a burned rock hearth feature at 162 cm below the surface near the Bk-BC
boundary, Nordt collected charcoal that yielded a radiocarbon age of 5210±230 b.p.
Abbott and Kleinbach examined the road cut and cutbank exposures
along Cowhouse and Two Year Old Creeks and noted that the Holocene terrace of
Cowhouse Creek housing the cultural materials of 41CV1104 was composed of a
complex assemblage of alluvial fills. They noted that most of the exposures appear
to represent the late Holocene West Range alluvium and that thick body of loamy
dark grayish brown deposits were intercalated with gravel lenses and exhibited an
A-Bk-C soil profile. While no exposures were available that allowed an examination
of the entire terrace, they suggested that older late Pleistocene to middle Holocene
alluvial fills (Georgetown and Fort Hood) probably were also present.
During the current investigations, the soil stratigraphy of the eastern road
cut was examined and described (see stratigraphic profile location in Figure 8.2).
The road cut exhibited a Cu-AC-2Bk-2C soil profile (Figure 8.3). The Cu horizon
(0–36 cm) is a grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam that represents recent spoil from
the road cut mantling the terrace surface. The underlying AC horizon (36–53 cm) is
a very dark gray (10YR 3/1) loam. The very abrupt lower boundary of the horizon
suggests that it is genetically unrelated to the soil below. Whether it represents an
earlier episode of road cut spoil or a more recent of drape of alluvium is not clear,

but there are a few small burned rocks within the horizon. Below the AC horizon is
a truncated 2Bk horizon that consists of a dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay
loam (53–190 cm) with a weak medium prismatic structure that parts to a moderate
fine blocky angular structure. Common (2 percent) carbonate filaments are present
on ped faces. A Castroville point was collected from this soil at 91 cm below the
surface, indicating that the alluvial unit on which this soil formed is Nordt’s West
Range alluvium. The 2C horizon (190–334+ cm) consists of a brown (10YR 4/2 to 4/3)
silty clay loam with a weak medium prismatic structure that breaks to a moderate
fine blocky angular structure.

Although these investigations were not able to examine the full horizontal
and vertical extents of the Holocene terrace, it is fairly clear that the terrace is
comprised of at least three alluvial units. Current and previous field observations,
radiocarbon assays, and temporally diagnostic artifacts indicate that the most of
the exposed terrace consists of the Fort Hood and West Range alluvial units. During
the current investigations, a small wedge of late Pleistocene Georgetown alluvium

was also observed at the base of the exposure dissected by Two Year Old Creek.
However, the latter unit was well below the depth of the culture-bearing deposits.
Cultural Features
Scattered burned rocks and several burned rock features were observed in the
east and west profile cuts of the tank trail that incises the Cowhouse Creek terrace
surface and crosses Two Year Old Creek. Four of these features were selected for
documentation and sampling: Feature 1 and 2 in the west profile cut and Features
3 and 4 in the east profile cut. These features were not excavated but were recorded
and sampled from their cross-section exposures.
Feature 1 is 137 cm wide (north to south) and is 16 cm thick (Figure 8.4). It
is ca. 20-35 cm below the surface (at an elevation of 99.66–99.50 m). It consists of
a flat-lying primarily single layer of burned rocks less than 15 cm in size (mostly
5–10 cm). No charcoal or oxidized sediment was observed. One sediment or flotation
sample was collected, but it yielded no charred botanical remains. Three burned
rocks were collected for plant microfossil extraction (see Appendix C). These five
burned rocks weighed 6.8 kg.

Feature 2 consists of a single layer of burned rocks within a shallow basin
(Figure 8.5). In cross section the feature measures 125 cm (north to south) and is
ca. 21 cm thick. The rocks are at ca. 45–66 cm below surface (at an elevation of
99.12–98.91 m). All of the burned rocks observed are less than 15 cm in size, with
most being 5–10 cm. One small charcoal sample was collected but was not submitted
for dating. One flotation sample collected did not yield any charred macrobotanical
remains. Three burned rock samples were collected for the extraction of plant
microfossils. The six rock samples weighed
Figure 8.59.6 kg.

Figure 8.5. View of Feature 2 in the west road cut at 41CV1104, looking west. Scale is 1 m long with 10-cm
increments on the lower half.

Feature 3 is a small flat burned rock feature consisting of a single course of
burned rocks (Figure 8.6). The feature measures 52 cm (north to south) by at least
20 cm (east to west) and is ca. 13 cm thick. The feature rocks occur at ca. 45–67 cm
below surface (at an elevation of 98.93–98.70 m). Most of the burned rocks comprising
the feature are 5–10 cm in size. None are greater than 15 cm in size. One flotation
sample was collected from the feature, but did not yield any charred botanical
remains when processed. Four burned rocks were collected for plant microfossil
extraction. The total weight of these rock samples was 3.2 kg.

Figure 8.6

Feature 4 consists of
a single layer of burned rocks
in a shallow basin (see Figure
8.6). The feature measures
48 cm (north to south) by at
least 38 cm (east to west), and
it is about 10 cm thick. It is at
ca. 80–90 cm below surface (at
an elevation of 98.58–98.48 m),
about 20 cm below Feature 3. A
Pedernales dart point exposed
near the feature in the road
cut profile was collected. One
piece of unidentified hardwood
charcoal was collected from
Feature 4, and it yielded a
radiocarbon age of 3760±30 b.p.
(Beta-343287; see Table 3.3). A
second piece of charcoal thought
to be a possible bulb fragment
was collected, but it could not be
identified. One flotation sample
collected from the feature
contained charred juniper and
live oak remains (see Appendix
B). Two burned rock samples
were collected for the extraction
of plant microfossils. The total
weight of these burned rock
samples was 7.1 kg.
Features 5, 6, 7, and
8 (see Figure 8.2) are small
burned rock features that
were mapped. However, time
constraints did not allow for
any of these features to be
archeologically investigated.

Besides the in situ
features, other cultural
materials observed in the tank
trail cut include scattered burned rocks and an occasional chert flake. Only two
items were collected during the investigation, both dart points found in the tank trail
cutbank (see Figure 3.3d and e). The Pedernales point was in the east cutbank near

152

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

Feature 4, and the Castroville point was in the east cutbank across the road from
Feature 1 (see Figure 8.2). The attributes of these projectile points are summarized
in Table 3.2.
The Pedernales point was found about 24 cm south of Feature 4, and it was
about 5 cm higher than the top of the feature rocks. Based on this, it is likely that
this dart point is not functionally associated with Feature 4. In addition, it cannot
be assumed that this Pedernales point was deposited at the same time as Feature 4,
although the radiocarbon age of 3760±30 b.p. on Feature 4 charcoal suggests that the
point and feature could be roughly contemporaneous. The Castroville dart point was
found at the same approximate elevation as Feature 1, but it was about 5 m northeast
of the feature. Consequently, it appears that there is no functional association
between the point and the feature, even if they are roughly contemporaneous.
National Register Assessment of 41CV1104
It is recommended that 41CV1104 remains eligible for listing on the National
Register of Historic Places. The investigations at this site consisted of cleaning
vertical profiles in a tank trail road cut to expose and sample four burned rock
features (Features 1 to 4). This investigation confirms that there are intact buried
features and associated artifacts in the Holocene alluvial deposits. No work was
done beyond the road cut, and the previously defined site boundary for 41CV1104
remains unchanged.
Investigations at the Gully Mouth Site, 41CV1657
Site Setting
Site 41CV1657, the Gully Mouth site, is an open campsite near the mouth of
a small intermittent stream that drains the Killeen surface. The site is about 100 m
east of the small stream’s confluence with Cottonwood Creek and just east of Old
Georgetown Road. At the site, the stream is incised ca. 5 m below the surrounding
upland surface. Deposits of late Holocene alluvium and colluvium parallel both sides
of the channel and abut the limestone valley walls of the drainage. Burned rock
features were observed in the alluvial deposits on the north side of the intermittent
stream. Vegetation on the valley slopes and uplands include juniper, live oak, yucca,
hackberry, and deciduous oak. The size of the site is estimated to be 40x40 m. Site
elevation is 243–250 m (800–820 ft) above mean sea level.
Current Investigations
The Gully Mouth site was unknown and unrecorded prior to the current
investigations. The site was brought to our attention by Fort Hood archeologists
Richard Jones and Sunny Wood after a maintenance crew, attempting to remove
sediment and other debris that collected at the east end of a culvert that runs west
under Old Georgetown Road, exposed several burned rock features in the alluvial
sediments on the north side of the drainage. The exposure of these features was
most likely due to accelerated erosion caused by the construction and presence of
the modern drainage culvert.

Chapter 8

The current investigation at the Gully Mouth site took place from May 26–28,
2010. The objective of the archeological work was simply to salvage information by
documenting and sampling the burned rock features. Investigations began with
cleaning and scraping the cutbank profile on the north side of the drainage with
shovels and trowels to better expose the burned rock features. Once the cutbank
profile was cleaned and the features were exposed, photographs were taken of
individual features and the entire north cutbank. The site was then mapped with
a Sokia total station (Figure 8.7). Full excavation of the features exposed in the
cutbank was not conducted; however, the feature profiles, their morphology, and
composition were recorded and described. Charcoal samples were collected for
radiocarbon dating and species identification, sediment samples of feature fill were
collected for the flotation recovery of charred macrobotanical remains, and burned
rocks were collected for the extraction of plant microfossils.
Sediments and Stratigraphy
Channel incision and headward erosion has removed much of the alluvial
and colluvial deposits from the small valley, and with it much of the site, but there is
still a wedge of alluvium and colluvium on the north side of the valley that contains
a fairly discrete cultural deposit. This deposit, the surface of which is steeply beveled
and topped with recent fill, is at least 2–3 m thick with a cutbank exposure that is
ca. 1.8 m high. The deposit consists of dark loamy sediments with matrix-supported
gravels (1–3 percent). Radiocarbon ages obtained on charcoal from three burned
features indicate the deposit is late Holocene in age and correlative to the upper
West Range alluvium.
Cultural Features
Five burned rock features were observed and recorded in the cutbank profile
on the north side of the drainage (Figures 8.8 and 8.9). As previously mentioned,
these features were not excavated, but were recorded and sampled from their crosssection exposures. Feature 1 is a small burned rock feature that measures 60 cm
wide (east to west) and is 20 cm thick (from 98.56 to 98.36 m). The feature primarily
consists of a single layer of burned rocks in a very shallow basin. A second layer
of burned rocks is present, but is not continuous across the feature. All but one of
the burned rocks is less than 10 cm in size. No charcoal or oxidized sediment was
observed. One sediment or flotation sample was collected. This sample yielded five
pieces of charcoal identified as live oak (see Appendix B). One of these specimens
yielded a radiocarbon age of 1200±30 b.p. (see Table 3.3). Seven burned rock samples
were collected for plant microfossil extraction (see Appendix C).
Feature 2 is a small burned rock feature 46 cm (east to west) in cross section
and 14 cm thick (98.56–98.42 m). It consists of small (<10 m) burned rocks that
form two layers in a shallow basin. One flotation sample was collected from below
the lowest course of burned rocks, and it yielded charred remains of red oak (n = 1)
and unidentified oak species (n = 4) (see Appendix B). One charcoal sample was
hand collected from the feature and yielded a radiocarbon age of 1150±30 b.p. (Beta-

burned rocks and charcoal in a shallow basin that is inset to or resting on a gravelfilled gully incised in the alluvial/colluvial deposit (Figure 8.10). The base of the
feature consists of a single layer of burned rocks underlain by a layer of charcoal. A
second or upper layer of burned rocks at the western end of the feature is separated
from the underlying course of burned rocks by a layer of charcoal. Inclined rocks
sloping toward the center of the feature mark its eastern and western ends. Three
bulk sediment or flotation samples were collected. A sample collected from the basal
layer of charcoal and sediment yielded 3 pieces of charred live oak and 17 pieces of
burned red oak. A sample collected from the upper layer of charcoal and sediment
at the western end of the feature yielded 20 pieces of charred live, white, and red
oak. A third sample, collected from the eastern end of the basal layer of charcoal and
sediment, yielded 20 charred specimens of live, white, and red oak (see Appendix
B). Two piece-plotted charcoal samples from Feature 3 yielded radiocarbon ages of
1050±40 b.p. (Beta-281902) and 1060±40 b.p. (Beta-281903; see Table 3.3). A total
of 23 burned rock samples were collected from Feature 3 for extraction of plant
microfossils, and four unburned rocks were collected from noncultural sediment
below the feature as a control sample for plant microfossils (see Appendix C).
Associated with Feature 3 is Feature 3A, small cluster of burned rocks
measuring 30 cm wide (east to west) and 31 cm thick (from 98.60–98.29 m). In the
cutbank profile, Feature 3A is just above the western end of Feature 3 (see Figure
8.10). It consists entirely of burned rocks less than 10 cm in size. Pieces of charcoal
were not visible until a few burned rock samples were removed from the feature.
One small piece was hand collected from the feature, but was not submitted for
radiocarbon dating. No flotation samples were collected. In total, six burned rock
samples were collected from Feature 3A for the extraction of plant microfossils (see
Appendix C).
Feature 4 consists of a single course of burned rocks in a flat layer that
measures 68 cm in cross section (east to west) and 12 cm thick (from 98.78–98.66 m).
The burned rocks making up this feature are less than 10 cm in size, with the
exception of one that is around 15 cm. One flotation sample was collected from the
feature, which yielded three pieces of charred oak and four pieces of an indeterminate
hardwood species (see Appendix B). None of the charcoal was submitted for
radiocarbon dating. Eight burned rock samples were collected for extraction of plant
microfossils (see Appendix C).
Cultural Materials
Other than the collected FCR samples, no stone artifacts were observed or
collected during the minimal investigations at 41CV1657. In addition, no artifacts
were recovered from the flotation samples.

National Register Assessment of 41CV1657
It is recommended that 41CV1657 is eligible for listing on the National
Register of Historic Places. Five intact burned rock features (Features 1–4 and 3A)
were identified and profiled in the alluvial cutbank, and microfossils were extracted.
A portion of each feature was left intact. The known features are all clustered in
a relatively small area (5.5 m long). Other features are likely to be present in the
alluvial deposits nearby, but slumping of the upland slope and colluvial slopewash
deposits obscure the cutbanks in most areas. At the time 41CV1657 was recorded,
the site area was defined as being 40x40-m, but this estimate is somewhat arbitrary.
Additional work would be needed to better define the site precise boundaries of
this site.

Earth-Ovens at fort Hood: Variation in
Form and Function

Alston V. Thoms, Douglas K. Boyd, and Laura M. Short

Microfossil samples from eight sites, six currently investigated and two
previously investigated, were incorporated into the plant-related studies for this
project (Figure 9.1; see Figure 1.2 and Table 3.1). The sites are all located in the
western part of Fort Hood within a 4-km radius of the point where Table Rock
Creek empties into Cowhouse Creek. All eight of the sites, and many others in the
vicinity, have yielded archeological evidence in the form of thearth ovens and are
close to natural resources needed to support earth-oven cookery. These requisite
resources, which by virtue of a high density of earth ovens (Boyd et al. 2004), occur
in sufficient abundance in close proximity to sustain systematic exploitation, are:
(1) productive root grounds and desert-succulent fields; (2) heating-element rocks;
(3) wood fuel; (4) oven-packing material; (5) potable water; (6) well-drained or
otherwise dry sediments in which to build ovens and on which to live while doing so;12
and (7) ready access to other resources necessary to sustain family and communal
groups, including: (a) safe and secure residential places; (b) large and small game;
(c) fish and shellfish; (d) nuts, fruits, berries, and other plant foods; (e) green wood
and other vegetation for sundry purposes; and (g) natural chert sources for making
stone tools.
This chapter provides additional earth oven context for chapters that discuss
microfossil and molecular analyses. In doing so, it: (a) presents our working typology
for earth ovens and related FCR features; (b) briefly notes the general nature of the
six investigated sites; and (c) characterizes the earth ovens and related features by
size, type, age, kinds of charred botanical remains they yielded, heating-element
weight, and thermal-weathering patterns.
The primary subject of this chapter and the remainder of this report is the
six sites with burned rock features that were intensively sampled for microfossil
for this project: CV594, CV947, CV984, CV1104, CV1553, and CV1657. In terms
of microfossil studies, the other two sites shown in Figure 9.1 played a relatively
minor role. Site 41CV1049 is one of the sites investigated by Prewitt and Associates,
Inc., for this project in 2009, but this occurred just before the intensive microfossil
sampling began. While sediment flotation samples were taken from the burned
rock features 41CV1049, no microfossil samples were taken during the fieldwork.
12

This characteristic applies mainly to the Paluxy sites.

Figure 9.1. Map of investigated sites at Fort Hood. The six sites with burned rock features that were
intensively sampled for microfossils are CV594, CV947, CV984, CV1104, CV1553, and CV1657. In
addition, microfossils were obtained from previously collected stone tools and FCR from 41CV595
and 41CV1049.

However, seven of the artifacts recovered from the site (three FCR and four stone
tools) were examined in the laboratory for microfossils. In addition, three stone
tools from a previously investigated Paluxy site, the Firebreak site (41CV595), were

Chapter 9

temporarily removed from the Fort Hood CRM program collections so that they
could be sampled for plant microfossils.13
Working Typology for Earth Ovens and Related
Features
Archeological studies at Fort Hood and in surrounding regions invariably
document earth oven features that range from less than a meter to more than two
meters in size and occur in slab-lined, partially lined, and unlined forms, with some
basin shaped and others flat bottomed (e.g., Black and Thoms 2014; Boyd et al.
2004; Mehalchick and Kibler 2008). Previous investigators developed typologies for
FCR features (e.g., Abbott and Trierweiler 1995:767–780; Mehalchick and Kibler
2008:30-32; Thoms and Clabaugh 2011). Most of these working typologies describe
the oven types noted above, although they use various nomenclatures.14
Our assumption is that almost all FCR features in the study area and
surrounding regions are byproducts of fire-based cooking methods known around
the world: (1) dry heat, as in open hearths; (2) moist heat, as in earth ovens and
steaming pits; and (3) wet heat, as in stone boiling, stewing, and simmering (cf. Thoms
2003; Wandsnider 1997). Some features and related scatters, however, are likely to
represent activities other than cooking, such as sweat bathing or annealing tool stone.
FCR lookalikes also result from “natural” fires, especially those that combust dead
standing and fallen trees as well as their roots up to two meters below the surface.
Such fires generate sufficient heat to produce FCR similar to that that generated
from cookstone technology (Thoms 2006a, 2007), although their geomorphic context
tends to differ from that that of hot rock cookery.
Distinguishing among these basic types of cooking methods archeologically
is ostensibly straightforward. Open hearths, with or without a rock-heating element,
tend to “burn out,” leaving comparatively more ash and less charcoal. In contrast,
earth ovens, or steaming pits, typically leave substantial fuel burning when they are
sealed. Soot covers packing material and coats surrounding sediments as combustion
continues in the oxygen-poor environment, leaving comparatively less ash and more
charcoal. Stone boiling, by its nature, necessitates “tethered” facilities: a surface fire
to heat the rocks and something to contain the water, often just a pit, which lacks
evidence of in situ combustion.
Fort Hood’s archeological record is dominated by FCR features—mounds,
middens, embedded and isolated concentrations, and scatters—that attest to earth
oven baking of geophytes and desert succulents, which are known ethnographically
to have been staples. Archeologists working at Fort Hood and throughout central
Texas now readily identify relatively “intact” earth ovens that were fired in place.
These features exhibit two important attributes: (1) evidence of in situ combustion,
minimally carbon-stained sediment within and underlying the rock heating element,
and, more definitely those that contain macroscopic charcoal fragments underlain
Site 41CV595, investigated by Prewitt and Associates archeologists in 2003 (Mehalchick et al.
2004), remains the most extensively excavated Paluxy site on Fort Hood.
14
The term fire-cracked rocks, or FCR, is commonly used throughout this report to refer to
burned rocks and burned rock features. “Fire-cracked rocks” and “burned rocks” are considered
synonymous and are used interchangeably.
13

by heat-oxidized sediment (Oestmo 2013); and (2) heating-element rocks that are
decidedly larger, often fractured but still articulated (i.e., fractured in situ), than
those in surrounding FCR concentrations and scatters.
Other types of earth ovens and hot-rock cooking facilities probably were
used regularly throughout central Texas and beyond, as is well-documented
ethnographically (e.g., Driver and Massey 1957; Thoms 1989; Wandsnider 1997;
Ellis 1997). Table 9.1 lists types of hot-rock cooking facilities used in the northern
Rocky Mountains, where hunter-gatherers were heavily dependent on geophytes.
This list demonstrates the variability of cooking features. Distinguishing among
these types of features archeologically, however, may not be straightforward due to
their overlapping functions and complex histories. Earth ovens, for example, are
often fired in situ, but sometimes the heating element is fired nearby—particularly
for steaming pits and fireless ovens—and therefore the ovens lack evidence of in
situ firing. Similarly, rock-filled pits, although they are often the remains of earth
ovens, can also be remains of stone-boiling pits or simply spent rock from any form
of hot-rock cookery. Most earth ovens were used multiple times (Black and Thoms
2014), as probably were steaming and stone-boiling pits, so almost all hot-rock
cookery results in the discard of spent rocks, usually in the immediate vicinity of
the cooking facility per se. And finally, piles of discarded rocks can be mistaken for
cooking facilities.

(2000:7.8–7.20) as summarized by Thoms (2008a:Table 2).

Oven size and heating-element weight are important typological variables,
as they attest to the quantity of food baked therein, perhaps along a continuum
from family to communal baking. Our working typology includes three oven sizes:
1. SMALL, family size. Ranging from about 40 to 99 cm in diameter, with a ca.
5- to 49-kg heating element.

Chapter 9

2. INTERMEDIATE. Ca. 100–175 cm diameter, with a ca. 50- to 150-kg heating
element.
3. LARGE, communal size. Ca. >176 cm in diameter, with a ca. >151-kg heating
element.
Key criteria for identifying an intact earth oven heating element include:
(1) size-range of heating-element rocks and whether they are fractured in place;
(2) configuration of rocks (bi-concave [basin shaped] or flat); (3) evidence of in situ
firing (oxidized sediment layer overlain by ash, charcoal, or carbon stains; (4) degree
of carbon staining in feature fill (heavy, moderate, or present); (5) thermal weathering
characteristics of heating-element rocks, especially the surface(s) from which they
were heated (bottom, top, side), which can be assessed by examining fresh breaks
and noting which side is the most oxidized or otherwise discolored and cracked.
The most readily recognized intact earth ovens are those with fired-in-situ
heating elements. In the current investigations, we targeted such features and
excavated the following four types:
1. Basin-shaped, slab-lined, earth-bottom earth oven with fired-in-situ rock
heating element.
2. Flat-bottomed, slab-lined (sides and bottom) earth oven with fired-in-situ rock
heating element.
3. Basin-shaped, unlined, earth oven with fired-in-situ rock heating element.
4. Flat-bottomed, unlined earth oven with fired-in-situ heating element.
More difficult to recognize are the remains of fireless ovens and steaming or
boiling pits that should be evidenced by tethered features: (1) a surface fire where
the rocks were heated; or (2) a pit or perhaps an unprepared surface to which the
hot rocks are transferred. In these cases, the cooking pit or surface would lack
evidence for in situ combustion.
Heating-element rocks in ovens and steaming pits should be comprised
of comparatively large rocks, with those fractured in situ being well represented.
Smaller, easier-to-handle rocks are likely to characterize stone-boiling activities.
Most fired-in-situ, heating-element rocks should have been heated from the bottom;
some were surely disturbed by the builders, however, as they repositioned rocks to
form a uniform heating element. Thermal weathering patterns in fireless cookers
should be more random because the rocks were heated in one place and used and
cooled in another. Archeomagnetic analysis can also be used to distinguish between
rocks heated and cooled in the same place and those that were heated in one place
and cooled elsewhere (Gose 2000).
While we targeted features that appeared to have fired-in-situ heating
elements, several turned out to lack reliable evidence of in-place combustion.
Those features may be the remains of fireless earth ovens, but they could also
represent substantially disturbed, fired-in-place earth ovens that no longer retained
readily visible evidence of in situ combustion. In either case, however, they should

163

164

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

be distinguishable from concentrations of spent cooking stones by the size and
configuration of their ostensible heating-element rocks. We encountered two types
of potential fireless earth ovens: (1) basin-shape concentrations of heating-element
rocks; and (2) flat-based concentrations of heating-element rocks.
Targeted Sites and Features
The TAMU team conducted investigations and microfossil sampling at six of
eight sites investigated by PAI for this project (see Table 3.1). No field sampling for
microfossils was done at 41CV1049, but feature sediment samples were taken for
flotation recovery of macrobotanical remains, and curated artifacts were sampled
for microfossils.
Our Phase I fieldwork at 41CV984 began in May 2010, when we partially
excavated a large (i.e., communal or bulk-processing size), multilayered, slab-lined
earth oven with fired-in-situ rock heating elements. This much-used oven was
embedded in a small, limestone, burned rock mound, ca. 8x10x0.4 m in size, and
exposed in a 50-cm-wide and 4-m-long hand-excavated trench. The field season
concluded with sampling four basin-shaped earth ovens at 41CV1657 that were
exposed in a creek cutbank created during recent road construction: one large, slablined, basin-shaped oven and three small (i.e., family-size) unlined, basin-shaped
ovens.
For Phase II, we returned to the field in November 2011 to work at 41CV594.
There, we sampled six large earth ovens—one slab-lined and flat bottomed and five
unlined—in a large burned rock mound measuring ca. 9x14 m and more than 60 cm
thick. In January 2012, we sampled five features at 41CV1553: one isolated slab-lined
earth oven, one flat-bottomedearth oven, and three FCR concentrations (one basin
shaped and two flat bottomed). The flat-bottomed oven and FCR concentrations were
embedded in an FCR sheet midden that covers an area of ca. 6 m in diameter. In
March 2012, we sampled three isolated large earth ovens (two large basin shaped
and one partially slab lined) and three small FCR concentrations of undetermined
function at 41CV947. Our final round of Phase II fieldwork in April 2012 entailed
sampling one FCR concentration and three earth ovens (one small flat bottom, one
small basin shaped, and one intermediate-sized basin shaped) that were exposed
in a tank trail road cut through 41CV1104.
Excavation and sampling strategies were as follows: (1) locating intact
earth ovens exposed in road cuts and natural cutbanks or in backhoe trenches;
(2) partially excavating deeply buried earth ovens from their exposed profiles to
collect heating-element rocks for microfossil, molecular, and thermal analyses and
sediment samples for flotation and macrofossil analysis; (3) exposing near-surface
features in plan view to collect heating-element rocks and surrounding sediment
for analyses; (4) collecting samples of airborne microfossils during excavation work;
and (5) collecting offsite sediments and noncultural rocks as control samples. The
six intensively investigated sites are described in detail in Chapters 4, 6, 7, and 8,
along with field methods, features and artifact assemblages, and site interpretations.

Chapter 9

The following subsections briefly characterize the sites and their respective
features in terms of their general size, morphology, type, heating-element weight,
macrobotanical yield, thermal weathering patterns of heating-element rocks (when
available), and likely function. Table 9.2 provides specific metric and morphological
data for 28 earth ovens and related FCR concentrations, along with information
on their heating elements and thermal weathering characteristics. Table 9.3 lists
the various plant taxa identified in the charred macrobotanical remains recovered
from 16 earth ovens and related features (see Appendix B). The plant microfossils
recovered from various features are identified in Appendix C.
Site 41CV594
This expansive site is on a Paluxy sand interfluve between minor, intermittent,
tributary streams (see Figures 7.2 and 7.3). Its defining feature is a large burned-rock
mound surrounded by FCR concentrations and chipped-stone scatters of varying
densities and sizes. Designated Feature 2, the mound was backhoe trenched and test
excavated by archeologists from Mariah Associates, Inc. in 1994. More intensive work
was done by PAI and TAMU archeologists in 2011 (see Chapter 7). Our follow-up
work, designed to efficiently identify intact earth-oven heating elements, entailed:
(1) mechanically re-excavating and extending the original backhoe trench, cleaning
and drawing the exposed profile; (2) mechanically removing the upper 30 cm of
military-disturbed sediment and hand-digging a perpendicular trench to expose, at
one degree or another, earth-oven heating elements. We identified seven large earthoven heating elements judged to be substantially intact, albeit to varying degrees;
six were unlined basin shaped and one was slab lined with a flat bottom. We also dug
a backhoe trench across one side of a smaller burned rock mound, which revealed
a fairly intact, fired-in-situ, basin-shaped earth oven with a rock heating element.
Designated Feature 1A, this feature was profiled, and the carbon-stained sediments
were sampled for macrobotanical analysis (see Appendix B). Some heating-element
rocks were collected as samples, but they were not analyzed for microfossils. All of
the earth ovens at 41CV594 were embedded in fine sandy loam sediment.
Feature 2A
Based on its exposed cross section, this feature is a large, basin-shaped,
unlined earth oven (Figure 9.2). A discernible large-rock heating element was
embedded in a lens of black carbon-stained sediment with a few pieces of wood
charcoal. Macrobotanical analysis of carbon-stained sediment samples yielded only
fuel-wood charcoal; of the identifiable wood, 75 percent is oak and 25 percent is elm.
Since only the cross section of this feature was sampled, heating-element thermal
weathering properties and weight were not recorded.
Feature 2B
Feature 2B was first encountered by Mariah archeologists in 1994
(Trierweiler, ed. 1994:230–233), both in the backhoe trench and in Test Pit 2. It was
more fully investigated by PAI and TAMU archeologists in 2011. Based on its exposed
cross section, this feature is a large, basin-shaped, unlined earth oven. A discernible

large-rock heating element was embedded in a lens of gray carbon-stained sediment,
with a few very small pieces of fuel-wood charcoal (see Figure 9.2). Due to its gray
as opposed to black, carbon-stained, feature fill, macrobotanical analysis was not
undertaken. Since only the cross section of this feature was inspected and sampled,
heating-element thermal weathering properties and weight were not recorded.
The 1994 testing effort yielded three radiocarbon dates on wood charcoal
from Test Pit 2 (Trierweiler, ed. 1994:230–233, 258, Table 8.17). Two samples yielded
isotope-adjusted radiocarbon ages of 4350±60 b.p. from 30–40 cmbs and 4100±70 b.p.
from 50–60 cmbs, (Trierweiler, ed. 1994:230–233, 258, Table 8.17), and these are
considered to be a reasonable age assessment for Feature 2B (see Table 3.3). The third
sample from 10–20 cmbs yielded an isotope-adjusted radiocarbon age of 170±70 b.p.,
and its 2-sigma calibrated date is a.d. 1638–1955. This essentially modern date
represents an intrusive disturbance of some kind, and may well be associated with
twentieth-century army activities, as evidenced by the foxhole observed adjacent
to Feature 2C. The other two dates represent the age of the organic-midden deposit
inside the Feature 2B pit, and thus, they provide an approximate age of the earth
oven cooking episodes at 3255–2879 b.c. and 2882–2463 b.c. (2-sigma calibrated).
Feature 2C
As was revealed in the backhoe trench and Test Pit 1 during the 1994 testing,
a military foxhole had disturbed about 40 percent of this large slab-lined (sides
and bottom), flat-bottomed earth oven. PAI and TAMU archeologists excavated
the remainder of this feature, further exposing the large slabs that lined the oven
pit. The intact portion investigated in 2011 accounts for perhaps as much as 50
to 60 percent of this earth oven. Many of the in situ bottom slabs were broken to
examine the interior for thermal weathering evidence, and they clearly showed
that the heat emanated from inside the pit rather than from below the slabs. Clastsupported heating-element rocks and charcoal-rich, black, “greasy” sediment filled
the pit (Figures 9. 3 and 9.4).
An isotope-adjusted radiocarbon age of 1520±70 b.p., with a 2-sigma
calibrated date of a.d. 410–660, was obtained on wood charcoal from 30-40 cmbs
in Test Pit 1. This sample came from immediately above the large basal burned
rock slabs (see Figure 8.14 in Trierweiler, ed. 1994), and it probably pertains to an
ancient baking event that occurred long after the Feature 2C bottom slab lining
was used (see Table 3.3).15
In the 2011 investigation, wood charcoal was recovered from underneath
the slab-lined bottom of this feature, and it yielded a conventional radiocarbon
age of 2460±30 b.p., with a 2-sigma calibrated date of 760–410 b.c. (see Table
3.3 and Chapter 7). This dated sample may be associated with the last cooking
There is a discrepancy in Trierweiler’s (ed. 1994) reporting of radiocarbon dates for burned
rock mound Feature 2. Table 8.17 lists all four dates from this site as having come from Test
Pit 2, but the site investigation summary on page 233 states that four pieces of charcoal were
dated, three from Test Pit 2, and one from Test Pit 1. In addition, Figure 8.14 has profiles of both
test pits that clearly show that three dates came from Test Pit 2 and one came from Test Pit 1.
We believe that the title of Table 8.17 is incorrect and that the information in Figure 8.14 and
on page 233 is correct.

episode involving the Feature 2C bottom slab lining. This dated sample is likely
to be associated with one of the earlier Feature 2C earth oven cooking event. In
addition to fuel-wood charcoal (96 percent oak; remainder unidentified hardwood),
the macrobotanical analysis identified four camas bulbs, 20 indeterminate bulb
fragments, and seven indeterminate non-wood botanical fragments (i.e., possible
plant food). Heating-element weight was not recorded.
Feature 2D
Based on its exposed cross section, this feature is a large, basin-shaped,
unlined earth oven (Figure 9.5). A discernible, albeit irregular, large-rock heating
element was embedded in a lens of black carbon-stained sediment with a few
very small pieces of wood charcoal. In addition to fuel-wood charcoal (94 percent
oak; remainder unidentified wood), the macrobotanical analysis identified four
indeterminate non-wood botanical fragments. Since only the cross section of this
feature was sampled, heating-element thermal weathering properties and weight
were not recorded.

Feature 2E
Based on its exposed cross section, this feature is a large, basin-shaped,
unlined earth oven (see Figure 9.5). A discernible, albeit irregular, large-rock heating
element was embedded in a lens of gray carbon-stained sediment with a few very
small pieces of wood charcoal. Due to its gray as opposed to black, carbon-stained,
feature fill, macrobotanical analysis was not undertaken. Since only the cross section
of this feature was sampled, heating-element thermal weathering properties and
weight were not recorded.
Feature 2F
Based on its exposed cross section, this feature is a large, basin-shaped,
unusually deep, unlined earth oven (Figure 9.6). A discernible large-rock heating
element at the base of the rock-filled basin is embedded in a lens of gray carbonstained sediment with a few very small pieces of wood charcoal. In addition to an
unusual array of fuel-wood charcoal (ca. 59 percent hackberry, 32 percent oak, and
9 percent elm), the macrobotanical analysis identified only one indeterminate nonFigure 9.6

heating-element thermal weathering properties and weight were not recorded.

and 4, is visible in the foreground.

Feature 2G
Based on its exposed cross section, this feature is a large, basin-shaped,
unlined earth oven. At the base of the rock-filled basin was a discernible large-rock
heating element that is embedded in a lens of black carbon-stained sediment with
a few very small pieces of wood charcoal (see Figure 9.6). In addition to a somewhat
unusual array of fuel-wood charcoal (ca. 55 percent oak, 36 percent yaupon, 8 percent
indeterminate hardwood, and 1 percent Texas persimmon), the macrobotanical
analysis identified three indeterminate tuber fragments and four indeterminate non-

wood botanical fragments. Since only the cross section of this feature was sampled,
heating-element thermal weathering and weight were not recorded.
Site 41CV947
Site 41CV947 is on a relatively flat expanse of the Paluxy Sand formation.
It is defined by scattered earth ovens and related FCR concretions; chipped-stone
debitage is present in low density, primarily in eroded areas. Backhoe trenching and
test excavations in 1996 revealed several relatively intact small earth ovens, two of
which yielded radiocarbon ages—1370±50 b.p. for Feature 1 and 1880±40 b.p. for
Feature 2 (see Table 3.3; Kleinbach et al. 1999:59–65, Table 101).
Returning to the site in 2012, our work entailed mechanically re-excavating
and extending old backhoe trenches to reveal features in profile and removing
overburden to reveal their outlines in plan view. We excavated all or parts of six
new features: two family-size; three intermediate-size; and one communal-size (see
Figures 7.12 and 7.13). All of the features were buried in fine sandy loam sediment.

sediment or other readily discernible evidence of in situ combustion (Figure 9.7).
Feature function was not determined, but it could be remains of a fireless cooking
facility of some type, or perhaps merely a concentration of discarded rock, several
of which fractured in place. Macrobotanical analysis was not undertaken. The total
estimated weight of rocks in the heating element(s) is about 30 kg.

Trench 2. The vertical scale is 50 cm and the horizontal scale is 100 cm.

Chapter 9

Feature 5
This is an intermediate-size (ca. 1.1 m diameter), partially slab-lined, basinshaped earth oven composed predominantly of small to medium-sized heatingelement rocks (5–15 cm) and a few larger ones, including many pieces that fractured
in place (Figure 9.8). The feature fill is black, carbon-stained, greasy sediment. A
Pedernales dart point in a vertical angle of repose was in the center of the oven
just below the lowest heating-element rocks (see Figure 3.1). Two radiocarbon ages
were obtained on wood charcoal in this feature—1170±30 b.p. from an elevation of
97.62 m (relative to an arbitrary 100 m elevation control datum) and 1050±30 b.p.
from an elevation of 97.58 m (see Table 3.3). The two calibrated, 2-sigma date ranges
overlap and could represent the age of a single cooking event. Conversely, the two
dated samples could be derived from two separate cooking events that were closely
spaced in time.
In addition to fuel-wood charcoal (97 percent oak, 1.5 percent ash, and
1.5 percent undetermined hardwood), the macrobotanical analysis identified eight
pecan shell fragments, two indeterminate tuber fragments, and two indeterminate
non-wood botanical fragments (i.e., possible plant food). The estimated total weight
of heating-element rocks is 112 kg. Thermal weathering characteristics were
recorded for 139 heating elements rocks as follows: 74 indeterminate direction of
heat application; 27 heated from the bottom; 11 heated from the top; and 2 heated
from the side.
Feature 6
This small, flat-based, small-rock FCR concentration lacked carbon-stained
sediment or other readily discernible evidence of in situ combustion (Figure 9.9).
Feature function was not determined, but it could be remains of a fireless cooking
facility of some type or perhaps merely a concentration of discarded rock, several of
which fractured in place. Because of the lack of soil staining, no sediment samples
were taken for macrobotanical analysis. The total weight of this ostensible heating
element was 8.25 kg. Thermal weathering properties were not recorded.
Feature 7
This is a large, unlined, basin-shaped earth oven with unusually large
heating-element rocks (some as large as 30x30x15 cm) that probably were fired in
situ (Figure 9.10). Oddly for a large-rock heating element, the surrounding sediment
matrix was not carbon stained and it lacked other readily discernible evidence for
in-place combustion. We did not formally record the direction of heat application,
but we checked many of the large rocks that were fractured in place. Most of them
appeared to have been heated from the bottom side, but others were clearly heated
from the top or side. Because of the lack of soil staining, no sediment samples were
taken for macrobotanical analysis. The total weight of this ostensible heating element
is estimated to be 257 kg.

Feature 8
This is a moderate-size, flat-based, FCR concentration/scatter with slightly
carbon-stained sediment but lacking in other readily discernible evidence that
the rocks were heated in place (Figure 9.11). Macrobotanical analysis yielded
only oak fuel wood. Rock size was variable among the 79 pieces, with 43 being
small, 22 medium, and 14 large, including several that fractured in place. Their
total weight was 23.7 kg. Thermal weathering characteristics of the 45 rocks we
broke and examined in cross section were recorded: 19 heated from the bottom; 11
indeterminate direction of heat application; 10 heated from the top; and 5 heated
from the side. Feature function was not determined, but this could be the remains
of a fireless cooking facility of some type, or perhaps merely a concentration of

Feature 9
This large, unlined, basin-shaped earth with a large-rock lower heating
element was probably fired in place (see Figure 9.10). The upper layer, composed of
comparatively small rocks, few of which appeared to be fractured in place, may be
discarded (i.e., spent) heating-element rocks from another oven. Fourteen of the 30

Chapter 9

181

lower-layer heating-element rocks we broke and examined appeared to have been
heated from the bottom, 6 from the top, 2 from the side, and 8 were indeterminate.
Macrobotanical analysis was not undertaken, given the paucity of carbon-stained
sediment and charcoal fragments. The total weight of this ostensible heating element
is estimated to be 56 kg.
Site 41CV984
This site, ca. 50 m south of Cottonwood Creek, is on a gentle sloping landform
covered in Paluxy Sand formation colluvium (see Figure 4.1). It is defined by: (1) a
small, well-preserved burned rock mound, Feature 2, ca. 10 m in diameter and 0.5 m
high; (2) a small burned rock mound substantially disturbed by road construction;
and (3) scattered FCR and chipped stone artifacts. The site was tested in 1996, and
a radiocarbon age of 2750±40 b.p. (see Table 3.3) was obtained on charcoal recovered
from 45 cm below the surface in dense concentration of FCR and carbon-stained
sediment in the northern portion of the intact mound (Kleinbach et al. 1999:70).
During the Phase I work in 2009, we targeted Feature 2 by hand-excavating
a 4x0.5-m trench across the central portion of the intact mound (see
Chapter
4). In
Figure
9.12
this trench, we identified a multilayered, slab-lined central pit that was designated
Feature 4.
Feature 4
Feature 4 is a much-used central pit
within a classic dome-shaped, burned-rock
mound that was barely perceptible from the
surface (Figure 9.12). Excavation revealed the
feature to be a multilayered, intermediate-size,
slab-lined pit, with mostly medium-sized and
large heating-element rocks encased in black
carbon-stained, charcoal-rich, greasy sediment.
Heating elements were probably fired in situ,
based on our informal notations that most of
the rocks appeared to have been heated from
the bottom. The width of the spaces between
multiple-layered, sometimes overlapping, side
slabs suggests considerable variation in the
size of individual ovens, including some that
were within the range of family-size ovens.
In some cases, embedded ovens may not have
had rock heating elements. Clast-supported
heating-element rocks, however, were the norm
(Figure 9.13).
Excluding the upper 15 of disturbed
sediment and unassociated deposits, the
upper 20 cm of the pit (15–35 cmbs) was filled

Figure 9.12. Feature 4 at 41CV984, looking south.
The uppermost layer of the feature rocks is exposed
in a 50-cm-wide excavation trench.

with black sediment and isolated pieces of FCR. The lower 50 cm of the pit was
excavated as irregular “levels” to a depth of 75 cm with the lower limit of each
being defined by a layer of horizontally lying tabular FCR and interpreted as the
bottom of a slab-lined oven. The clay content of the encompassing sandy loam
sediment increased with depth, and the underlying Bt horizon was a clayey sandy
loam. The heating elements and slab-lining rocks varied considerably in size, as did
the overall weight of the excavated rocks (see Table 4.1 and Figures 4.8 and 4.9).
Assuming that the complete pit feature had an average diameter of 1.5 m during
each cooking episode, the excavated FCR data were used to estimate the weight
of the FCR for each excavation level. The estimated FCR weight ranged from 46
to 133 kg per level, assuming that one-third of the feature was excavated, or 77 to
222 kg per level if one-fifth of the feature were excavated (see Table 4.1). Based on
the spatial relationships and orientations of the rocks, it is hypothesized that the
Feature 4 pit contained remnants of at least three, and perhaps four, earth oven
heating elements (see Figure 4.8). Charcoal from Level 9 yielded a radiocarbon age
of 2440±40 b.p. (760–400 b.c., 2-sigma calibrated), and charcoal from Level 4 yielded
a radiocarbon age of 1910±40 b.p. (a.d. 10–210, 2-sigma calibrated). These dates are
in correct stratigraphic order within the pit feature (see Table 3.3 and Figure 4.8),
and it seems likely that each of these ages represents specific cooking episodes. The
earliest cooking episode occurred when the burned rock mound was in its infancy,
while the latter represents one of the last cooking episodes in the earth oven not
long before the burned rock mound was abandoned.
All 101 of the identified charred wood fragments, which came from eight
levels of the feature and represent wood fuel, were oak. Non-wood charred fragments
identified in the macrobotanical analysis consist of: 16 indeterminate bulb scales

Chapter 9

from Level 2; 6 indeterminate bulb scales from Level 3; two indeterminate tuber
fragments and one indeterminate bulb scale from Level 5; four indeterminate bulb
scales for Level 6; one camas bulb from Level 7; six indeterminate bulb scales from
Level 8; and one onion bulb and one indeterminate bulb scale from Level 9.
Site 41CV1104
Site 41CV1104 occupies the tread of an expansive Cowhouse Creek terrace.

exposed in a road cut though the terrace fill. We sampled four earth oven features
that appeared to be relatively intact, two family-size and two communal-size. All of
the features were buried in the upper 1.5 m of terrace fill in silty clay loam.

Feature 1
This moderate-size, shallow, basin-shaped feature is an isolated amorphous
“lens” composed of several closely spaced pile-like concentrations of small- and
medium-sized FCR (Figure 9.15). Although a few tiny pieces of wood charcoal were
observed in the feature matrix, visual evidence of in situ combustion was lacking.
This feature is classified as a fire-cracked rock concentration, although it could be an
unlined earth oven heating element or merely a concentration of discarded cooking
stones. Macrobotanical analysis was not undertaken given the paucity of carbonstained sediment and charcoal fragments. FCR thermal weathering properties were
not recorded, insofar as the feature was sampled in profile and only a small fraction
of rocks were exposed. Based on the weight of FCR removed from the cross section
of this feature and assuming it was roundish in plan view, the estimated total FCR
weight is about 54 kg.

at bottom and 5-cm increments at top.

Feature 2
This intermediate-size, basin-shaped earth oven has as a largely clastsupported heating element composed mostly medium-size rocks, some of which
fractured in place (Figure 9.16). Visual evidence—a few pieces of wood charcoal
under the larger rocks and patches of charcoal flecks in the surrounding matrix—
suggests the heating element was fired in situ. Macrobotanical analysis was not
undertaken, given that the sediments were not sufficiently carbon stained and hence
unlikely to yield useful information. FCR thermal weathering properties were not
recorded, given that the feature was sampled in profile and only a small fraction of
rocks were exposed. Based on the weight of FCR removed from the cross section of
this feature and assuming it was roundish in plan view, the estimated total FCR
weight is about 120 kg.
Feature 3
This is a small, flat-bottomed concentration of small pieces of FCR, several
of which were underlain by charcoal fragments and flecks, probably represent a
fired-in-place heating element of a small earth oven or surface hearth that has been
somewhat disarticulated by pedoturbation (Figure 9.17). Macrobotanical analysis
was not undertaken, given that the sediments were not sufficiently carbon stained
and hence unlikely to yield useful information. FCR thermal weathering properties
were not recorded, as only a few small rocks remained. Based on the weight of FCR
removed from the cross section of this feature and assuming it was roundish in plan
view, the estimated total FCR weight is about 13 kg.

Feature 4
The heating element in this small, fired-in-situ, basin-shaped earth oven
is composed mostly of small pieces FCR; it is underlain by a lens of carbonstained, charcoal-rich sediment (see Figure 9.17). Interestingly, several seemingly
unburned mussel shells were found a few centimeters above the heating element
as well as beneath it, which suggests that the feature was disturbed by some form
of pedoturbation. Feature 3 is just north of, and about 20 cm below, Feature 4. A
Pedernales point was recovered while troweling the vertical road cut, and it was
found between and below the two features. The point was in a vertical angle of
repose; it remains undetermined whether there is temporal/functional association
between the point and these cooking features.
Macrobotanical analysis resulted in the recovery of only fuel-wood charcoal,
80 percent oak and 20 percent juniper. One of the charcoal fragments yielded a
radiocarbon age of 3760±30 b.p. (see Table 3.3). FCR thermal weathering properties
were not recorded due to the small size and somewhat disturbed nature of the rocks.
Based on the weight of FCR removed from the cross section of this feature and
assuming it was roundish in plan view, the estimated total FCR weight is about 14 kg.
Site 41CV1553
This site lies mainly on a gently a gently sloping surface capped by gravelly
sandy colluvium derived from the Paluxy Sand formation just to the north and
underlying limestone bedrock; it extends downslope where the colluvium is fine
sandy clay loam (see Figures 6.2 and 6.3). Feature 8, located in the upslope area of
the site, is a low, sheet-midden-like burned rock mound, ca. 6 m in diameter with
many embedded family-size earth ovens (Figure 9.18). This feature and several
isolated family-size earth ovens were tested in the 1990s (Mehalchick, Killian et al.
2003:202–214), and again for Phase I of this project in 2009 (see Chapter 6). The
Feature 8 mound had a large central earth oven that was originally recorded as four
separate features (Features 8A­–8D). Three radiocarbon ages were obtained from
charcoal fragments found scattered in the mound: 1440±40 b.p., 1860±40 b.p., and
1460±40 b.p. Five new radiocarbon ages obtained from charcoal fragments in the
central embedded earth oven (see Table 3.3) are:

Previous backhoe trenching also revealed several isolated earth ovens about
75 m south of the low burned rock mound, at the base of the slope, where sediments
were more clayey and gravely. Radiocarbon ages were obtained on wood charcoal
from three of the features: Feature 3, 240±50 b.p.; Feature 4, 1900±50 b.p.; and
Feature 6, 2090±50 b.p. (see Table 3.3), a partially excavated slab-lined earth oven
that yielded a charred fragment of an unidentified bulb (see Feature 3 in Mehalchick,
Killian et al. 2003:208–209).

Figure 9.18

Chapter 9

Figure 9.18. Overview of Feature 8 at 41CV1553, showing subfeatures. View is looking east. Large scale is
100 cm.

To identify and sample additional intact earth ovens, we returned to
41CV1553 in January 2012 during Phase II. We mechanically re-excavated old
backhoe trenches on the toe of the slope and mechanically and manually stripped the
topsoil from the edge of Feature 8. Four features were investigated, and one turned
out to be a well-preserved intermediate-size earth oven (Feature 8E). Three others
(Features 8F, 8G, and 8H) are classified as fire-cracked rock concentrations. Feature
6, an intermediate-size earth oven that had previously been partially excavated,
was re-located and fully exposed.
Feature 6
Feature 6 is an intermediate-sized, slab-lined (sides and bottom), flatbottomed earth oven (Figures 9.19 and 9.20). It was filled with black, greasy, carbonstained, charcoal-rich sediment but lacked heating-element rocks characteristic of
most of the ovens we excavated. We broke 28 of the slab-lining rocks to assess the
direction of heat application, including several that fractured in place and others
displaced by bioturbation, probably from tree roots. Of all teh ovens we assessed,
this one had the highest percentage of rocks burned from the top or inside face,

187

188

which, given the black charcoal matrix, indicates that the oven was fired in place.
It is possible that some or all of the eight slabs that were heated from the bottom
may be heating-element rocks rather than displaced lining rocks. Overlying this
feature were at least three amorphous concentrations of FCR, each about 75 cm in
cross section, comprised of mostly small and medium-size rocks at various angles
of repose; the sediment matrix was not carbon stained. These concentrations were
interpreted in the field as discarded heating-element rocks, presumably from a
nearby feature.

North arrow scale is 10 cm.

As noted, an age of 2090±50 b.p. was previously obtained on charcoal from
this oven, which also yielded a fragment of an unidentified bulb. All of the fuel
wood identified by the microbotanical analysis of the flotation samples was oak.
Also identified were five indeterminate bulb scale fragments, one pecan shell, and
one camas bulb. The rocks in the remaining portion of this oven (ca. 75 percent)
weighed 101.45 kg, so the total weight of the slab linings and possible heating rocks
is estimated to be about 127 kg.

Feature 8E
This intermediate-sized, unlined, basin-shaped earth oven had a clastsupported heating element composed primarily of medium-size rocks, including
several that fractured in place (Figure 9.21; also see Figure 9.18). Most of the rocks
we broke and from which the direction of heat application could be assessed were
heated from the bottom. The surrounding and underlying matrix was dark gray
and carbon stained and contained many charcoal fragments and flecks. Fuel wood
was identified as oak (85 percent) and juniper (15 percent). A single camas bulb
fragment was recovered. The heating-element rocks in this fully excavated feature
weighed 34.25 kg.
Feature 8F
This small, flat-based concentration of FCR contained one large tabular rock
that was heated from the bottom and 17 small rocks, 14 of which were indeterminate
with regard to direction of heat application (Figure 9.22; also see Figure 9.18). The
matrix was not carbon-stained and neither charcoal fragments nor flecks were
observed. FCR in this feature weighed 5.75 kg. It is unclear as to whether this
feature is a disturbed earth-oven heating element, another type of cooking facility,
or merely discarded cooking stones. Macrobotanical analysis was not undertaken
due the absence of carbon-stained sediment.

Feature 8G
This small, basin-shaped concentration of FCR contained one large and
two small tabular rocks at steep angles of repose along with six small rocks in
horizontal angles of repose (Figure 9.23; also see Figure 9.18). The matrix was not
carbon stained and neither charcoal fragments nor flecks were observed. As such,
macrobotanical analysis was not undertaken, and the FCR in this feature were not
weighed or examined for thermal-weathering characteristics given that feature
function was deemed indeterminate. It is unclear as to whether this feature is a
disturbed earth-oven heating element, another type of cooking facility, or merely
discarded cooking stones.

Feature 8H
This intermediate-sized, flat-bottomed concentration of FCR contained
mostly small and medium-size tabular rocks lying horizontally over an area of ca.
125 cm in diameter (Figure 9.24; also see Figure 9.18). One edge of Feature 8H
overlaid Feature 8G. The Feature 8H matrix was not carbon stained and neither
charcoal fragments nor flecks were observed. The 118 pieces of FCR weighed 34.5 kg.
They were broken and examined for thermal weathering characteristics: 42 were
heated from the bottom; 19 were heated from the top; and 57 were indeterminate. It is
unclear as to whether this feature is a disturbed earth-oven heating element, another

Site 41CV1657
This is the only investigated site in a sequestered location; we named it
the Gully Mouth site. It is effectively hidden from view some 20 m inside a narrow,
steep-sided gully that empties into the Cottonwood Creek valley (Figure 9.25). It
lies some 12 m below the surrounding “tabletop” landscape and is buried 0.4–1.0 m
below surface in gravelly clayey alluvium and colluvium comprising a gully mouth
fan. The Gully Mouth site was exposed during road-improvement construction in
2010 and soon thereafter recorded by Fort Hood archeologist Sunny Wood. The right
bank along the gully channel was cut back mechanically to allow for placement of a
new culvert under the road. Cross sections of four earth ovens, one communal-size
and three very similar family-sized, were exposed along in the resulting 10-m-long
vertical cutbank (Figure 9.26). Also exposed was a concentration of FCR (Feature
3A) of undetermined function.
Feature 1
The heating element in this small, unlined, basin-shaped earth oven is
composed of clast-supported small pieces of FCR (Figure 9.27). The heating element

was fired in situ and is underlain and partially surrounded by dark gray, carbonstained, charcoal-rich sediment. All of the identified fuel-wood charcoal (n = 5) was
oak; one piece of which yielded a radiocarbon age of 1200±30 b.p. Neither FCR

were recorded, given that this feature
was sampled in profile and only a small fraction of rocks were exposed.

Figure 9.27. Profile view of Feature 1 at 41CV1657, looking north. Vertical scale is in 10-cm increments.

Feature 2
The heating element in this small, unlined, basin-shaped earth oven is also
composed of clast-supported small pieces of FCR (Figure 9.28). The element was
fired in situ and is underlain and partially surrounded by gray, carbon-stained,
charcoal-rich sediment. All of the identified fuel-wood charcoal (n = 5) was oak; one
piece yielded a radiocarbon age of 1150±30 b.p. Neither FCR weight nor thermalweathering properties were recorded, given that this feature was sampled in profile
and only a small fraction of rocks were exposed.
Feature 3
This large, slab-lined (sides only), fired-in-situ earth oven has at least two
slab linings and was clearly used multiple times. It has a thick heating element,
possibly representing multiple baking events. There are at least two lenses of
sediment underlying and partially surrounding the heating element. Sediments

between the slab-lining rocks were also black, carbon stained, and charcoal rich
(Figure 9.29). Although we did not formally record direction of heat for any of the
rocks, most of the slab-lining specimens we broke incidentally showed to have been
heated from the inside and from the bottom, in the case of heating-element rocks.
All of the identified fuel-wood charcoal (n = 60) was oak. Four fragments of
indeterminate non-wood charred material, possibly plant food, were also identified.
Two radiocarbon ages were obtained on oak charcoal from separate layers of carbonstained sediment: 1050±40 b.p. and 1060±40 b.p. Heating-element weight was not
recorded, given that this feature was sampled in profile and only a small fraction
of rocks were exposed.
Feature 3A
As shown in Figure 9.29, this small FCR concentration is spatially associated
with the Feature 3, the large slab-lined earth oven. It is not clear whether it is a
disturbed small oven similar to Features 1, 2, and 4, a displaced portion of Feature 3,
or something else altogether. Macrobotanical analysis was not undertaken. Neither

FCR weight nor thermal-weathering properties were not recorded, given that this
feature was sampled in profile and only a small fraction of rocks were exposed.
Feature 4
The heating element in this small, unlined, basin-shaped earth oven is also
composed of clast-supported small pieces of FCR (Figure 9.30). The fired-in-situ
heating element is underlain and partially surrounded by gray, carbon-stained,
charcoal-rich sediment. Three pieces of fuel-wood charcoal were identified as oak
and four as indeterminate hardwood. Neither FCR weight nor thermal weathering
properties were not recorded, given that this feature was sampled in profile and
only a small fraction of rocks were exposed.
Conclusion
The six sites we investigated, and likely others in the same landscape, had
much in common. They were all occupied during the same broad time frame, within
the last 5,000 years and most intensively from ca. 1,000 b.c. to 1,000 a.d. (Figure
9.31). Their large earth ovens were built in the same burned rock mounds over long

periods—almost 3,000 years at 41CV594, and at least 1,600 years at 41CV984. The
time spans at other sites with multiple ovens are shorter. The burned rock mound
and its embedded earth ovens at 41CV1553 were used for five or six centuries, while
four cooking features at 41CV1657 have overlapping radiocarbon ages and must
have been used within only a century or two. Nevertheless, all the earth ovens at
all the investigated sites represent a long-term continuity in cooking technology.
Moreover, despite the long duration of their use, these ovens were fired using the
same kinds of wood fuel, mostly oak, and they were used to cook the same plants
foods—bulbs and tubers, as evidenced by charred macrobotanical remains. As is
discussed in Chapter 14, the investigated earth ovens yielded evidence of similar
suites of plant foods and packing materials in the form of plant microfossils.
However, in marked contrast to the sites’ overall similarities, the 28 earth
ovens and related features that we sampled showed significant variation in
morphology and size. Lined and unlined ovens, some basin-shaped and others flatbottomed, occur in the same sediments embedded in the same burned rock middens.
Communal-size (i.e., bulk processing), intermediate-size, and family-size earth ovens
often co-occur within single sites. Interestingly, camas and other geophytes appear to
have been baked in different kinds of ovens, and two or more types of root foods were
cooked in some earth ovens. This variability in earth oven form and plant remains
is intriguing, although admittedly not fully understood. The complex relationships
between feature form and function are mentioned in the subsequent chapters and
are discussed more extensively in the concluding Chapter 16.

30 Radiocarbon Dates from Six Sites on Fort Hood

CHAPTER 10:
EARTH-OVEN cookery: historical
background and introduction to the
fort hood microfossil study

Alston V. Thoms

Geophytes are plants that bear their renewal buds as underground storage
organs (USOs), such as bulbs, corms, tubers, root nodes, and taproots (Raunkiaer
1934). Earth ovens are underground heat-retention facilities of various sizes
commonly and widely used in family and communal cookery, often to bake USOs
(Black and Thoms 2014; Thoms 1998). Geophyte microfossils, the targets of the
present study, include starch granules, phytoliths, calcium oxalate crystals, and
plant tissues that are byproducts of the baking process. The focus here is on starch
granules. Artifacts of interest are once-hot rocks—cooking stones—that formed
heating elements in earth ovens and whereon microfossil-bearing residues from
baked plant foods may have accumulated. These stones are commonly known as
fire-cracked rocks (FCR), fire-altered rock, fire-modified rock, burned rock, and
sundry related terms (Jackson 1998). ‘‘Cook-stone technology” (and various similar
terminology) refers to processes employed in the procurement, utilization, and
discard of rocks that served as heating elements for cooking food (Ellis 1997; Thoms
2003).
The relationships between plant foods, geophytes, and subterranean pit
cooking using stone heating elements, are long and complex. Earth ovens were
used to bake geophytes for 9,000 or more years throughout central Texas and well
beyond (Black and Thoms 2014; Black et al. 1997; Boyd et al. 2004; Thoms 2009a,
2009b). The archeological significance of the onset and proliferation of earth ovens
derives from the key roles these features played in the development and evolution
of cooking technology and related dietary changes. Baking geophytes, as well as
many other plant and animal foods, in earth ovens for a few hours to several days
significantly increases their digestibility and caloric yield (Konlande and Robson
1972; Peacock 2008; Wandsnider 1997; Wrangham 2009). Accordingly, earth oven
baking is a strategy that effectively increases food availability in a given area by
transforming otherwise nutritionally poor or inedible foods into edible forms, thereby
supporting population growth (Thoms 2003).
Many parts of the world, especially savannah and fuel-poor regions, had
and have edible wild geophytes that are rich in carbohydrates, abundant, readily
accessible, and capable of sustaining long-term exploitation (Thoms 1989, 2008a,
2008b). When found in proximity to adequate supplies of rocks, fuel, and water such

199

places tend to be targeted by hunter-gatherers. Yet archeology tends to be data-poor
in terms of reliably knowing what foods were baked in most ancient earth ovens.
As abundant and relatively resistant to pedoturbation processes as ancient earth
ovens are (Thoms 2007a), poor organic preservation conditions in most places mean
that charred plant food remains are rarely recovered.
Research presented in this and following chapters addresses a fundamental
taphonomically oriented question: Is it reasonable to expect to find microfossil
evidence of plant foods in the remains of ancient earth ovens in which those foods were
baked? Specifically, we seek to ascertain whether and, if so, how USO microfossils
are released during the baking process and how they are ultimately deposited on
fire-cracked rocks that served as earth-oven heating elements. In the absence of
identifiable plant-food macrofossils, as is the case with the vast majority of cookingfacility remains around the world, microfossils may provide equally direct evidence
of past foodstuffs. As such, the scientific utility of plant-food microfossil studies is
their potential to yield reliable diet-related data that effectively supplement and
complement the macrofossil record (Bryant 2007a).
The Following Chapters
This introductory chapter sets the stage for those to come by providing
background information about earth ovens, geophytes, and related research
strategies. Next, Chapter 11 provides background information on microfossil
analyses with an emphasis on starch grain taphonomy and identification, along
with a description of the methods used for the microfossil analyses. Chapters 12 and
13 discuss the electric-oven and actualistic-oven experiments, respectively. Results
of the microfossil analyses are provided, evaluated, and interpreted in Chapters
14 and 15. The final Chapter 16 summarizes our findings and provides concluding
comments.
BACKGROUND
As noted above, the often poor organic preservation conditions and the
resulting difficulty in recovering identifiable macrobotonical remains impels
archeologists to search for microfossil evidence (e.g., Perry 2005; Piperno et al. 2009).
What further beckons archeologists to plant-food microfossils is that they are far
more prevalent than macrofossils and are more likely to be preserved (Haslam 2004).
When plant foods are ground, pounded, scraped or otherwise forcefully contacted
with a mano, pestle, or other pounding/grinding stones, hundreds of thousands of
microfossils may be compressed into cracks and crevices on a given tool surface.
Some of those starch granules survive degradation processes in identifiable forms
for millennia, although the precise mechanisms and chemical processes remain
poorly understood (Messner 2011: 53). Judging from the densities of starch granules
7
calculated for several species of domestic yam (Dioscorea spp.)—7.14-621.3x10
granules/g dry weight (Riley et al. 2006)—billions of microfossils are produced every
time a few dozen or more kilograms of wild, starch-rich, geophyte USOs are baked
in an earth oven.

Chapter 10

By identifying taphonomic patterns of geophyte microfossil mobilization,
deposition, weathering, and other transformation processes in cooking facilities,
new doors are opened toward learning about ancient human diets, land-use
patterns, and related sociocultural issues, including feasting and gender roles.
As such, microfossil analysis has considerable potential to inform us about earth
oven function and provide evidence of paleodiets useful in generating independent
data for assessing models about the evolution of subsistence patterns around the
world (e.g., Binford 2001; Brace 2005; Brace et al. 2008; Leach et al. 2006; Messener
2011; Pennisi 1999; Perry et al. 2007; Wrangham 2009). Our own research interests
include the application of microfossil analyses to assess ideas about the onset of
ancient pre-agricultural carbohydrate revolutions in south-central North America
(Laurence 2013; Laurence et al. 2011; Thoms 1994, 2003, 2004, 2008a, 2008b;
Thoms et al. 2011). From a management perspective, microfossil research provides
another way to extract important data from rare and precious archeological remains,
and this translates into new views of research potential and site significance. For
cultural resources managers at Fort Hood, the efficiency of conducting meaningful
archeological research is greatly enhanced by the combination of targeted feature
investigations coupled with comprehensive macrobotanical plant microfossil
sampling and analyses.
Research Context: Paleodietary Change and
Land-Use Intensification
Given a working assumption that earth-oven cookery effectively enhances
carrying capacity, a marked increase in the use of earth ovens in a given region may
signal what Mark Cohen (1977) called a “food crisis in prehistory.” In western North
America, ethnographic and archeological data attest to oven-baked, carbohydraterich, geophytes and desert succulents (e.g., agave, sotol, and yucca) being significant
components of hunter-gatherer and agriculturalists diets (Black and Creel 1997;
Leach et al. 2006; Thoms 1989, 2008b; Wandsnider 1997). Baking plant foods in
earth ovens with rock heating elements spanned diverse ecological regions; it was
underway by early Holocene times and increased thereafter, sometimes in relatively
punctuated fashions that Thoms (2008b) terms “pre-agricultural carbohydrate
revolutions.”
Earth-oven cookery also may have played a role in our biological evolution
by rendering plant and animal foods softer (i.e., more easily masticated), resulting
in smaller teeth and related changes in cranial morphology (Brace 1967, 1980, 2005;
Brace et al. 2008). Geographic and ethnic variation in consumption of starch-rich
domestic cereal crops has been linked to the evolution of human amylase gene copy
number variation and, hence, our ability to digest starch-rich foods (Perry et al.
2007). Further research is warranted to ascertain whether worldwide increases
in carbohydrate and fat consumption prior to the onset of agriculture may have
been accompanied by evolutionary changes as well. It has also been argued that
development of diabetes may be linked to a shift away from consuming wild
geophytes rich in complex carbohydrates, typical of those baked in earth ovens with

201

202

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

rock heating elements, and toward marked increases in consumption of processed
foods, especially fats and domestic cereals (Wandsnider 1997).
Homo sapiens, regardless of time frame, were and are effectively full-time
cookers (Petraglia 2002; Wrangham 2009). Although our Old World ancestors cooked
food with hot-coal fires more than 150,000 years ago (Klein and Edgar 2002; Stiner
et al. 2011), they seldom, if ever, used purposely heated stones for cooking (e.g.,
Soler Mayor 1996). Recent comparisons between experimentally heated stones and
archeologically recovered fire-cracked rocks from shallow-basin hearths at a cave
site in South Africa suggest that cooking stones of some type may have been in use
by 72,000 years ago (Oestmo 2013).
Hot-rock cookery in the Old World was well underway some 30,000 years ago,
about the same time Neanderthals—predominately meat eaters—became extinct
(Dogome 2000; Mellars 1996; Movius 1966; Piperno et al. 2004; Straus 2006; Thoms
2009a; Torrence et al. 2004). Use of rock heating elements in cooking, arguably a
Homo sapiens sapiens hallmark, conserved fuel and facilitated prolonged baking
and boiling, which was necessary to render some foods readily digestible and more
nutritious, including animal fat and geophytes (Gott et al. 2006; Samuel 2006;
Thoms 1989, 2003, 2009a; Wandsnider 1997). The cost of these ostensible benefits
includes increased labor compared to rockless cookery, as is widely documented in
ethnographic records and especially for women and children. Available evidence
suggests that cookstone technology was most commonly used in cooking meats/fats
in northern clines (Brace 1967; Movius 1966; Nakazawa et al. 2009; Nelson 2010)
and for plant foods in warmer settings (Dogome 2000; Torrence et al. 2004).
Hot-rock cookery, and arguably the intensive use of plant foods, had been
underway in the Old World for more than 10,000 years when groups of immigrants
made their way to North America. Interestingly, however, FCR is almost never
found at Clovis-age or earlier Paleoindian sites (Hammatt 1976; Petraglia 2002;
Reeves 1990; Speth et al. 2013; Willey and Phillips 1958; Wissler 1940). Although
there are very few archeologically documented Paleoindian cooking fires of any
kind, it is reasonable to conclude that surface hearths were an integral component
of every Paleoindian encampment and they were a focal point of cooking and other
familial activities. In any case, ethnohistoric data routinely attest to lean meat,
fish, and shellfish cooking quickly on coals and to geophytes rich in less complex
carbohydrates being baked on hot coals in about an hour, which is to say without
the use of cooking stones (Thoms 1989, 2008b; Wandsnider 1997).
Among the oldest evidence reported for hot-rock cookery in North
America—11,000-10,000 radiocarbon years b.p.—are FCR features in central
Alaska at the Moose Creek site (Pearson 1999), in central Texas at the WilsonLeonard site (Guy 1998), and in northwest Alabama at Dust Cave (Homsey 2009).
Cookstone technology spread rapidly and by 8000 b.p. rock-filled earth ovens were
probably in use throughout North America. In much of western North America,
including the study area, geophyte exploitation and earth-oven cookery intensified
substantially between 4,000 and 2,000 years ago as evidenced by the increase in
the number of earth ovens, some of which have yielded charred lily family bulbs

Chapter 10

(Black and Creel 1997; Boyd et al. 2004; Thoms 1989, 2008b, 2009a). Proliferation
of earth-oven technologies indicates a major intensification-oriented shift—from
wild animal foods to wild plant foods—in the diet of Native Americans during the
early Holocene (cf. Binford 2001).
Technological Context: Earth-Oven Cookery
Ethnographic and ethnohistoric accounts attest to substantial variation in
earth oven construction and use (e.g., Black and Creel 1997; Crowther et al. 2003;
Driver and Massey 1957; Ellis 1997; Kumar and Aalbersberg 2006; Loy 1994b;
Messner 2011:120; Messner and Schindler 2010; Peacock 2008; Smith et al. 2001;
Stark 2002; Thoms 1989:179–20, 223–227, 264–270; Wandsnider 1997). Nonetheless,
generalizations are readily derived from an array of information about earth ovens
with rock heating elements.
1. Although meat, fish, and shellfish were sometimes cooked in ovens, these
features were more commonly used to bake tens to hundreds of kgs of plant
foods, especially geophytes and desert succulents (e.g., agave, sotol, yucca,
prickly pear).
2. Smoldering coals and hot rocks in the heating element typically formed the
bottom layers in the oven pit.
3. Food items were almost always packed between layers of green vegetal material
that provided additional moisture during the baking process and protected
the food from being instantly burned by the red-hot rocks or being coated by
sediment.
4. The resulting low mound of packing material and food was then covered with
earth and, in some cases, a fire was built atop it.
5. Packing material, along with the raw food itself, usually contained enough
water to create an adequately moist baking environment, although water was
sometimes added through a hole in the earthen cover to maintain sufficient
moisture.
6. After baking for the requisite time, the earthen cover, the upper layer of
packing material, and the food(s) were removed, leaving the underlying
packing material and rock heating element relatively intact (Black and Thoms
2014; Thoms 2008b).
The stages of this process are illustrated in Figure 10.1.
For a more detailed review of these and other aspects of ethnographically
and nutritionally documented earth-oven cookery, see Wandsnider (1997). Her
discussions call attention to the concept that carbohydrates in raw food respond in
similar fashion to cooking, regardless of when or where plants grow—an observation
that explains many of the worldwide similarities in cookstone technology.
She also notes that baking-related water loss curtails spoilage during storage
by limiting the amount of moisture available to microorganisms (Wandsnider 1997:5,
10). Camas (Camassia quamash) bulbs from the northern Rocky Mountains of
central Idaho lost 44 percent of their fresh weight after baking in a traditional Nez

Perce earth oven for 48 hours (Konlade and Robson 1972). After baking for only 30
o
o
minutes in a conventional household oven at 200 C (392 F), the moisture content
of sweet potato, yam, taro, and cassava was reduced 9 to 14.8 percent (Bradbury
et al. 1988). Cassava and taro tubers lost 10.1 and 17.4 percent of their weight,
respectively, when baked in an earth oven for 1.25 hours. Most of the weight loss was
from water and attributed to evaporation and “dripping” (Kumar and Aalbersberg
2006:303–304). Such baking-related water loss plays a key role in the mobilization
and deposition of geophyte microfossils.
Analytical Context: Molecular Analyses of Microfossils
Starch granules are glucose polymers formed within chloroplasts (i.e.,
specialized cytoplasmic bodies containing chlorophyll) of green plants and
amyloplasts (i.e., specialized bodies containing one or more starch grains) of USOs,

Chapter 10

seeds, sporocarps, and to a lesser extent in leaves and stems (Field 2008). Phytoliths,
as the term is used here, are siliceous bodies that form within plants (Piperno 2006:1).
Researchers who define phytoliths broadly (e.g., Esau 1965) consider raphides (i.e.,
needle-shaped crystals made of the biomaterial calcium oxalate) and other calcium
oxalate crystals to be among the phytoliths. We follow Crowther (2009), however, in
discussing calcium oxalate crystals as a separate class of plant biominerals based
on their elemental composition.
The utility of archeologically oriented research with microfossils—such as
pollen, starch granules, phytoliths, calcium oxalate crystals, and plant fibers—is
well established (Briuer 1976; Bryant 1974, 2007b; Dering and Shafer 1976; Jones
and Bryant 1992; Loy 1994a; Loy et al. 1992; Perry 2010, 2014; Piperno 2006;
Shafer and Holloway 1979; Torrence and Barton 2006). Most plant-food microfossil
research focuses on processing tools, especially grinding stones (e.g., Chandler-Ezell
et al. 2006; Haslam, 2009a; Perry et al. 2007). Plant-food microfossils, usually 50
microns and smaller in size, are typically recovered from tiny bits of residue found,
often with the aid of a low-power microscope, in cracks and crevices and on use
surfaces of chipped, ground, and battered stone tools that came into direct contact
with plant tissue.
Much less common, and a key component of the Fort Hood archeobotanical
project are studies that identify and track plant-food microfossils in the remains
of ancient earth ovens using laboratory and actualistic (replicated earth oven)
experiments (see Chapters 12 and 13). Insofar as oven-baked foods do not normally
come into contact with an oven’s rock heating element during the cooking process
per se (Thoms 2008a), a general presence of plant-food microfossils on cooking stones
in earth ovens arguably results from indirect deposition onto cooking stones during
and/or after baking (i.e., without direct plant-to-artifact contact).
Other archeologically relevant studies address microfossil preservation
conditions (e.g., Barton 2009; Haslam 2004; Langejans 2010), recovery and
processing techniques (e.g., Coil et al. 2003; Fullagar 2006; Horrocks 2005), taxon
identification (e.g., McNair 1930; Messner 2011), and hazards of misidentification
and contamination (e.g., Haslam 2006; Laurence et al. 2011). Much of the relevant
plant-microfossil taphonomy literature falls within other research spheres, including
botanical and soil sciences (cf. Haslam 2004).
Extraction and identification of starch granules and phytoliths on stone
and wooden tools is firmly entrenched as a method for assessing which plants were
ground, pounded, chopped, and cut with what tools (Chandler-Ezell et al. 2006;
Henry et al. 2012; Nugent 2006; Odell 2004: 159–165; Piperno 2006; Perry 2004;
Torrance and Barton 2006). Messner (2011: 40–61) provides a detailed review of
archeologically oriented starch-granule research. The usefulness of calcium oxalate
raphides in archeologically oriented microfossil research is less established. In
general, raphides have too many intertaxa similarities and too much intrataxa
variation in size and shape to be diagnostic of most plant species. However, some
plants foods—for example, members of the Araceae family (e.g., aroids, including
taro, Colocasia esculenta)—may be identified by their unique raphid morphologies

205

206

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

(Crowther 2009). Jones and Bryant (1992) determined that it was possible to identify
individual species of Opuntia (cactus) based on size and morphology of their druseshaped calcium oxalate crystals.
Starch granules, phytoliths, and other microfossils are also embedded
in calculus deposits on human teeth and those of other plant-eating animals.
Archeologists have used plant-microfossil analysis of calculus as a direct assessment
of paleodiets (e.g., Dudgeon and Troup 2012; Hardy et al. 2009; Henry and Piperno
2008; Henry et al. 2009, 2011a; Reinhard et al.2001; Wesolowski et al. 2010). Debate
remains, however, as to the reliability of such analysis in distinguishing between
degraded raw starch granules and cooked, partially gelatinized granules (Collins
and Copeland 2011; Henry et al. 2011b).
With varying degrees of success, molecular analyses have also been applied
to paleodietary studies in general and residue studies in particular (Malainey
2011). These include gas chromatography, fatty acid, Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (FTIR), and Raman spectroscopy, all of which have been applied to
FCR to determine what foods they cooked (e,g., Buonasera 2005; Lucquin 2007;
Quigg et al. 2001).
PROJECT DEVELOPMENT AND PRELIMINARY FINDINGS
As noted, the vast majority of ancient earth ovens in western North America
were probably used to bake plant foods, especially geophytes. Thoms’ interest in
plant-food microfossils stems from decades of earth oven and land-use intensification
research in Texas (e.g., Thoms 1994, 2007a, 2008b; Thoms and Clabaugh 1994, 2011;
Thoms et al. 1981) and the Pacific Northwest (e.g., Thoms 1989, 1998, 2006a, 2006b,
2007b). In 2006, he and Masahiro Kamiya undertook a proof-of-concept study to
assess the potential of microfossil analyses in addressing the development of wildplant food consumption through the millennia in the south Texas and northern
Mexico (Thoms 2006c). Geophytes known or suspected to have been important in
the borderlands and throughout Texas’ savannah regions were selected for the study
(Thoms 1994, 2004).
Kamiya processed and analyzed fresh plant material from various geophyte
USOs for starch extraction using methods reported by Piperno and Holst (1998)
and Field (2006:110–111). Extraction of silica-based phytoliths and calcium oxalate
crystals followed methods discussed by Piperno (2006) and Jones and Bryant
(1992). Extracted microfossils were examined under x400 magnification. Potentially
diagnostic starch granules were abundant in the bulbs of false garlic (Nothoscordum
bivalve) and rain lily (Cooperia drummondii), the corms of common goldstar
(Hypoxis hirsuta), and the rhizomes of greenbriar (Smilax spp.). Onion (Allium spp.)
and eastern camas (Camassia scilloides), known to contain complex fructan-type
carbohydrates (i.e., inulin-rich), had little or no starch. Raphides, a calcium oxalate
crystal form, and silica-based phytoliths were common, however, as they are in rain
lily and common goldstar (Kamiya 2007). These results, in conjunction with other
studies (e.g., Eccleston 1999, Perry 2010), demonstrated the feasibility of identifying
diagnostic microfossils in the USOs of fresh wild geophytes.

Chapter 10

As a follow-up to our proof-of-concept project, Thoms and Bryant (2009)
applied for a National Science Foundation (NSF) grant titled “Tracking Microfossil
Evidence for Ancient Carbohydrate Revolutions: Geophyte Use Among HunterGatherers in South-Central North America and Beyond.” It was aimed at better
understanding the nature of microfossil taphonomy during and after the baking
process. Its key components were: (1) development of a reference collection of
microfossils extracted from raw and baked geophytes; (2) analysis of cooking stones
and sediments from previously excavated earth ovens that yielded charred geophyte
remains; and (3) recovery (i.e., new excavation) and analysis of cooking stones that
comprise earth-oven heating elements. NSF reviewers did not recommend funding
the project but they encouraged us to revise and resubmit the proposal.
In consultation with Doug Boyd, principal for Prewitt and Associates, Inc.,
Thoms retooled the proposal to bring it in line with ongoing investigations of earth
oven sites on sandy landforms at Fort Hood, Texas (Boyd et al. 2004). The scope of
work for the present pilot research project, part of a larger investigation of PaluxySand sites through Fort Hood’s CRM program, includes: (1) developing a plant-food
microfossil (i.e., starch granules, silica-based phytolith and calcium oxalate crystal
biominerals) reference collection for selected central-Texas geophyte USOs and
desert succulents likely to have been important foods for the region’s pre-Columbian
hunter-gatherer populations; (2) conducting laboratory experiments to identify
baking residues generated by earth oven configurations, with the objective analyzing
a sample of the oven’s cooking stones (i.e., FCR) for USO microfossils; (3) extraction
of microfossil samples from previously recovered artifacts from Fort Hood Paluxy
sites that yielded charred remains of USOs; and (4) excavating cooking stones from
earth-oven heating elements at Paluxy sites and conducting microfossil analysis on
a sample of them (Thoms 2009b, 2010).
Thoms and his Ph.D. students Masahiro Kamiya, Andrew Laurence, Timothy
Parrott, and Laura Short have been engaged since 2009 in a variety of plant-food
residue studies relevant to the microfossil component of the Paluxy site investigations
(Thoms et al. 2010). Among those are an assessment of impacts of airborne starch on
archeological analysis (Laurence et al. 2011), electric-oven experiments baking USOs
and recovering their microfossils from residue on cooking vessels (Thoms et al. 2014),
actualistic oven building/baking experiments and recovery of USO microfossils from
heating-element rocks (Thoms et al. 2010, 2011), and molecular analyses of selected
geophyte USOs (Kamiya and Short 2010; Short et al. 2014). Just how we came to
include this particular suite of studies merits discussion because it is germane to
development of the archeological components of our microfossil research project.
Assessment of Nonarcheological Microfossil
Deposition on Artifacts
Laurence’s initial analysis of previously recovered artifacts—ground
and battered stone tools as well as earth-oven FCR—from Fort Hood and other
archeological sites consistently resulted in isolation and identification of many
well preserved, readily identifiable starch granules, biominerals, and plant tissue
(see Chapter 14). His findings contrasted markedly with Kamiya’s prior analysis of

207

208

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

archeological FCR, which rarely identified ancient starch granules, and studies by
other researchers, who reported finding only a few identifiable starch granules on
select tools and FCR (e.g., Perry 2010). Laurence’s preliminary results simply seemed
too good to be true, which called for their further assessment. Toward that end, we
collected and analyzed several surface rocks from gravel-rich sediments in the region.
These too yielded well-preserved, readily identifiable starch granules, biominerals,
and plant tissue. We suspected that these remarkably intact microfossils were of
recent origin, possibly airborne, post-collection contamination (Loy and Barton 2006)
or simply products of decomposing plants at the excavation sites (cf. Haslam 2009b).
Airborne Starch
To assess our idea that airborne microfossils might accumulate on surface
rocks and follow up on related studies (e.g., Loy and Barton 2006), we conducted
an informal experiment in conjunction with our ongoing actualistic experiments
building and using earth ovens. We placed a sterile open container with a small
amount of distilled water on a tabletop near our oven experiments and left it
there for a full day in anticipation of collecting airborne microfossils. Processing
and analysis of the water revealed the presence of numerous starch granules and
other microfossils. Among the starch granules were several that resembled those
previously recovered from false garlic bulbs. This finding was especially interesting
insofar as we had cleaned and wrapped false garlic bulbs in the vicinity of the water
trap. Moreover, false garlic growing onsite was in bloom at that time.
In the aftermath of recovering what seemed to be airborne USO starch
granules, Laurence spearheaded a formal assessment of airborne starch as a
potential source of “contamination” (see Chapters 11 and 14). That assessment
became the focus of his dissertation research on starch granule analysis (Laurence
2013). He quickly learned that well-known allergy literature routinely affirmed
the presence of airborne starch granules. Moreover, the literature clearly revealed
that starch granules are inside the pollen grains of starch-rich plants and are often
released when pollen grains rupture in midair during thunderstorms. In an article
published in the Journal of Ethnobiology, Laurence and his co-authors reported on
starch granules extracted from Texas air samples, including those we collected at
Fort Hood for the present project, from pollen grains of wild geophytes and maize
that he manually ruptured. Starch granules from pollen grains were compared to
those in storage organs of these plants. Results confirmed that storage-like starch
granules are airborne and that intra-pollen starch granules can be indistinguishable
from starch granules in their respective storage organs (Laurence et al. 2011).
Based on these findings, we now assume that starch granules and other
microfossils are likely to accumulate on artifacts and in features by means of starch/
microfossil rain. This suggests that other microfossils from nonutilitarian species
should also be deposited naturally. We suspected that quantitative analyses would
prove useful in determining which microfossils found on archeological specimens
resulted from relevant human behavior, which granules were products of airborne
contamination, and which were deposited as residue from decaying USOs that grew
onsite.

Chapter 10

Recent Anthropogenic Contamination
Laurence’s analysis of the first few curated Fort Hood artifacts also revealed
too good to be true, well-preserved starch granules, some of which occurred in
dense clusters. He reasoned that the clustered granules might have resulted from
contamination during excavation and/or while processing the artifacts for analysis
and curation. His suspicions stemmed from a published account of patches of maize
(corn) starch being recovered from the surface of 2 million-year old stone artifacts
from the Sterkfontein site in South Africa (Loy and Barton 2006). In that case, it was
clear that starch from this New World domesticated plant was not archeologically
relevant and probably originated from corn-based food consumed by someone who
also handled the artifacts.
Having observed remarkably well-preserved clusters of starch granules
on some of the ground stone tools from Fort Hood, Laurence thought it would be
worthwhile to compare those clusters to starch granules in corn and potato chips,
as those foods are often part of archeologists’ lunch menus. He held a given chip
between his fingers and then smeared one of the ostensibly microfossil-encrusted
fingers on a microscope. The types and nature of starch granules on the slides were
virtually identical to some of those on the pre-Columbian curated artifacts we
thought might have been contaminated (see Chapters 11 and 14).
Laurence also analyzed two of the limestone rocks we collected at Fort
Hood—after eating a chip- and cracker-rich lunch—for our actualistic oven building
experiments. Those rocks also yielded starch granule clusters virtually identical
to the clusters obtained from the corn chips. As discussed in Chapter 14, these
experiences led us to conclude that our initial findings were unreliable and that the
previously collected and curated Fort Hood artifacts are likely to be too contaminated
for reliable analysis without additional treatment.
Our assessment of nonarcheological microfossil deposition resulted in fieldsampling procedures designed to reduce contamination, including: (1) use of latex
gloves; (2) between-sample cleansing of trowels; (3) when practical sampling while
the feature is covered by an awning; (4) promptly sealing samples; (5) collecting air
samples during excavation; and (6) collecting offsite sediment control samples as well
as samples of buried, “raw” cooking stones for comparative analysis. In the lab, we
began to use a commercial laboratory “clean-bench,” which allows us to unwrap and
process artifacts as well as to prepare sides and examine samples with a minimum
of airborne and technician-transported contamination (see Chapter 11).
Assessment of Taphonomic Pathways of Microfossils during
USO Baking
As our microfossil research progressed and discussions ensued, it became
apparent that we lacked a working model to explain just how plant-food microfossils
might end up, indirectly, as baking residue on rocks that comprised earth-oven
heating elements. To generate expectations about why and where we should find
food residues within the remains of earth ovens, we needed reliable information
about the nature and mobility patterns of plant-food microfossils during and after

209

210

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

baking. Toward that end, we carried out two sets of experiments, one entailed baking
geophyte USOs in electric ovens and analyzing cooking residue on the inside of the
baking containers, and the other involved baking USOs in actualistic earth ovens
and analyzing cooking residue on rocks that comprised the heating elements.
Baking Geophytes in an Electric Oven
Background, methods, and results for this suite of experiments are reported
in the article “Baking Geophytes and Tracking Microfossils: Taphonomic Implications
for Earth-Oven and Paleodietary Research,” recently published in the Journal of
Archaeological Method and Theory (Thoms et al. 2014). Much of the same information
is incorporated into the present report, albeit in a different form (see Chapters
12 and 13). To initially address the reasonableness of expecting to find plant-food
microfossils in ancient earth ovens, we conducted three sets of experiments in 2009
and 2013 that entailed baking wild geophyte USOs in a conventional electric oven
(i.e., kitchen range) and in a lab oven. Our primary objective was to determine
whether the resulting cooking residues deposited on the insides of the bowls
contained identifiable microfossils from a given USO. Small packets of USOs likely
to have important food sources for Fort Hood’s prehistoric residents were baked for
o
o
a few minutes to 12 hours at temperatures between 135 and 150 C (ca. 275–300 F).
The first set of experiments, termed “simple,” entailed wrapping a handful of
raw USOs in cotton cloth and baking the food bundle in an open glass bowl. Water
was added periodically to keep the wrapping cloth and USOs wet and thereby avoid
burning during prolonged baking. In the second set of experiments, herein termed
“complex,” a similar quantity of raw USOs was packed between layers of green-leaf
packing material (primarily oak and grass leaves) in a closed glass or ceramic bowl.
In this case, a lesser amount of water was added periodically to keep the contents
sufficiently moist, as opposed to wet, and thereby prevent burning. The third set
entailed baking USOs in a lab oven wherein USOs were place on the bottom of the
container and a microscope slide was suspended above with the intend of collecting
water vapor from the USO that was expected to contain microfossils as well. As no
water was added, the USOs were baked in dry heat insofar as the only moisture was
that within the USOs. Baked USOs and the residues deposited inside the cooking
containers and on microscope slides were sampled and processed to determine the
nature of embedded microfossils after various baking times and under different
conditions.
The three sets of electric oven baking experiments assessed the potential
of earth ovens to yield microfossils representative of wild geophyte USOs. During
o
12 hours of baking at 135–150 C in a conventional oven, identifiable and degraded
USO microfossils accumulated on cloth coverings and leafy packing materials and on
the inside of the containers. During 15–30 minutes of lab-oven baking, microfossils
were also deposited on suspended slides, demonstrating that they were transported
in tiny particles of water vapor. Results of these taphonomic experiments indicate
that starch granules, phytoliths, and raphides exude from USOs while baking and
are then mobilized and indirectly deposited as residue via liquid and vapor forms
of water (see Chapter 12).

Chapter 10

Baking Geophytes in Earth Ovens
In 2009 and 2010, with the goal of determining whether microfossils could
be tracked in earth ovens per se, we built four earth ovens some 1.75 m in diameter
with rock heating elements weighing about 100 kg. Consistent with ethnographic
records and previous actualistic experiments, food packets were placed between
layers of green-leaf packing material (oak and grass leaves as well as prickly pear
pads, yucca, and sotol leaves) weighing a total of ca. 60 kg. The ovens were fired using
about 100 kg of hardwood fuel (oak and elm) to bake starch-rich and inulin-rich
geophyte USOs for 20 and 40 hours, respectfully. A few days after opening one set of
ovens and a subsequent rain shower, we removed samples of packing material and
cookstones and analyzed them using protocols described herein. Intact/identifiable
and damaged/unidentifiable geophyte starch granules were recovered from packing
material and FCR that underlay the intra-oven position of the geophytes in question,
as were phytoliths and raphides. Similar results were achieved for the second set of
actualistic earth oven experiments, as described in Chapter 13 (also see Thoms et al.
2011). That chapter also includes: (1) data on cooking temperatures and durations
for each of the above large ovens, including one without a rock heating element; and
(e) similar data for two small earth ovens used to bake meat and USOs, one with
the heating element fired in situ and the other a fireless oven in which the cooking
stones were heated in a nearby fire and transferred to the bottom of an adjacent
pit to serve as the heating element.
Archeological Expectation About Geophyte Baking Residue
Results from our microfossil taphonomy experiments were sufficient to
generate a proposition about post-baking translocation of plant microfossils during
transition of an earth oven from its systemic context to the archeological record:
With the passage of time, exuded plant-food microfossils, originally deposited on
leafy packing material during baking, should be remobilized and moved down the
profile by the percolation of rainwater or meltwater (i.e., soil illuviation) (see Chapter
12; Thoms et al. 2011, 2014).
In this testable scenario, oven-mobilized, plant-food microfossils are
remobilized along with other soil organic matter and cutans via subsurface
percolation, leaching, and evaporation (i.e., soil eluviation). Subsequently, they
are redeposited on underlying cooking stones and in the encasing sediment, along
with residue from packing materials and other clay- and silt-size illuvium particles
(e.g., soil carbonates, organic matter, and other cutans). Some of the redeposited
microfossils that come to rest on or around once-hot cooking stones should be
protected from natural degradation via soil microorganisms and enzymes by the
rocks themselves. Concentrations of heavy minerals (including iron, clay-sized
sediment, carbon, and calcium carbonate) may also help with preservation (cf.
Haslam 2004).
Recovery of little bluestem grass and live oak starch granules from
electric-oven and earth oven baking experiments indicates that packing-material
microfossils are also exuded during prolonged baking. Here, too, mobilization and

211

212

deposition via water vapor seems likely. Nonfood microfossils should also end up
on earth-oven heating elements and in the encompassing sediments. As such, the
nature and distribution of plant microfossils in ancient earth ovens is likely to be
analytically noisy, thereby complicating reliable extraction and identification of
plant-food microfossils. For example, leaves and stems of many edible plant foods
also make great packing material, including those of berries, fruits, nuts, seeds,
desert succulents (e.g., agave, prickly pear, yucca), and geophytes (e.g., false garlic
and winecup) (see Chapter 12).
THE HOT ROCKS COOK OFFS: PATHWAYS TOWARD
EXPERIMENTAL ARCHEOLOGY, NATIVE AMERICAN
COLLABORATION, AND PUBLIC EDUCATION
Four “Hot Rocks Cook Offs” were held in Texas between 2009 and 2013, and
each event was a unique blend of university teaching, experimental archeology,
public education, and collaboration with Native Americans (Figure 10.2). The concept
underlying our series of Hot Rocks Cook Offs is that of conducting archaeological
experiments in ancient cooking technology within a context of public events around
which a diversity of consultation and information exchanges occurs among tribal
representatives, non-tribal archaeologists, and others, including the public at large.
This idea developed serendipitously with the temporal juxtaposition of the following
happenings during the summer and early fall of 2009: (1) geophyte-microfossil
investigations by faculty and graduate students underway at the Laboratory of
Ecological Archaeology and Palynology Laboratory, Department of Anthropology,
Texas A&M University (TAMU); (2) a new fall-semester graduate seminar in the
Department of Anthropology titled “Ancient Foodways and Cooking Technology”;
(3) ongoing archaeological investigations by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (PAI) at
selected sites on Paluxy Sand landforms at Fort Hood that were funded through the
Fort Hood Cultural Resources Management (CRM) Program; (4) efforts by the City
of College Station Parks and Recreation Department and its Historic Preservation
Committee to develop a Native American Pathway at Veterans Park and Athletic
Complex; and (5) ongoing Native American tribal consultation efforts through the
Fort Hood Cultural Resources Management Program.
Linking these ostensibly unrelated happenings began in June 2009 when
contractual plans were finalized to incorporate TAMU faculty and graduate students
into PAI’s archaeological investigations at Paluxy sites on Fort Hood. The graduateseminar strengthened the link, given that some of students were already involved
in geophyte-microfossil research at TAMU laboratories, and the seminar students,
as a group, afforded a ready labor force for the oven-building experiments needed
to enhance our understanding of thermodynamic and taphonomic issues associated
with baking geophytes. We wanted to do our experiments in a public setting as
a means to inform people about ancient cooking technology used by the region’s
inhabitants long before the arrival of Europeans and Africans. Toward that end and
given its interest in creating a Native American Pathway, the city of College Station
offered to provide a place to build earth ovens within its new Veterans Park and
Athletic Complex. Previous archaeological investigations at this park had revealed

a presence of fire-cracked rocks that probably represented remains of ancient earth
ovens (Mason and Stahman 2001), and this discovery sparked the concept of a Native
American Pathway to complement the Veteran’s Mile pathway.
In mid-September 2009, TAMU faculty and graduate students traveled
to Fort Hood to collect geophytes for their microfossil analyses and oven-baking
experiments and to meet with PAI archaeologists and Fort Hood CRM Program
representatives, including the coordinator for Native American consultation. As
we visited sites slated for investigation and discussed research strategies, several
of us advocated for inviting tribal representatives to observe and participate in our
experiments building and using earth-ovens. Fortunately, the consultation and CRM
wheels turned at Fort Hood and the powers-that-be authorized and separately funded
Native American participation in the inaugural Hot Rocks Cook Off and two of three
subsequent cookoffs. Other funding was obtained for a fourth Hot Rocks Cook Off
and for participation of non-federally-recognized tribes, namely two Coahuiltecan
groups. Details of the types of cooking facilities constructed and monitored at these
events are presented in Chapter 13. These events are summarized as follows:
The Hot Rocks Cook Off of 2009 was held November 13–15 at Veterans
Park and Athletic Complex in College Station. It was co-hosted by the Ecological
Archaeology Laboratory, the Comanche Nation, and Primitive Texas, a hands-on
training program in native subsistence technologies. We sought out the Comanche
Nation because they are the only tribe regularly consulted with by Fort Hood
representatives and for whom we have written records (i.e., ethnohistoric accounts)
about building and using earth ovens to cook the kinds of wild root foods, camas
in particular (Camassia scilloides), that had been recovered in charred form from
earth ovens at Fort Hood. Co-sponsors of this event included: the Cultural Resources
Management Program, U.S. Army Fort Hood; Prewitt and Associates, Inc.; the City
of College Station; the Department of Anthropology at Texas A&M University; the
Fire Lab, Rocky Mountain Research Center, U.S. Forest Service; and HEB, Inc. The
Forest Service supplied thermocouples and sage advice for using data loggers, while
HEB donated the onions and potatoes for baking. About 130 people attended the
earth-oven and stone-boiling demonstrations including 25 students, 100 community
members, and several professors and professional archaeologists from surrounding
regions.
The Hot Rocks Cook Off of 2010 was held October 29–31, during Texas
Archeology Awareness Month, at Veterans Park and Athletic Complex, College
Station. It was co-sponsored by TAMU’s Department of Anthropology, the City of
College Station’s Parks and Recreation Department and its Heritage Programs, Fort
Hood’s Cultural Resources Management Program, Prewitt and Associates, Inc., the
U.S. Forest Service’s Fire Lab at the Rocky Mountain Research Center, and HEB,
Inc. Participants included tribal representatives from the Mescalero Apache Tribe
of Mescalero, New Mexico, and Tap Pilam-Coahuiltecan Nation, San Antonio, Texas,
along with students and faculty from the Anthropology Departments at Texas State
University and Texas A&M University. Tap-Pilam representatives built a barbacoa

Chapter 10

pit lined with rocks and baked two cow heads for two days, which was a big hit
with all who observed and sampled the resulting barbacoa tacos. About 220 people
attended these demonstrations including 55 students, 8 tribal representatives, 175
community members, and several professors and professional archaeologists from
surrounding regions.
A Hot Rocks Cook Off planned for 2011 was cancelled due to a county-wide
burn ban. It was scheduled for November 18–20 at Veterans Park and Athletic
Complex, College Station. Anticipated participants included representative from
several recognized and non-recognized tribes as well as archaeology faculty and
students from Texas A&M University, Texas State University, and Baylor University.
The Hot Rocks Cook Off of 2012 took place at Aquarena Springs in San
Marcos. It was held in November, as one of the state’s Archaeological Fairs held
during Texas Archaeological Awareness Month. Representatives of the Comanche
Nation and various Coahuiltecan groups again visited with us as we built and used
earth ovens and stone-boiled. This event was co-sponsored by the Department of
Anthropology and the Meadows Center for Water and the Environment at Texas
State University, the Fort Hood Cultural Resources Management Program, and the
Archaeological Ecology Lab at Texas A&M University. Approximately 350 people
attended this two-day event.
The Hot Rocks Cook Off of 2013 took place in San Marcos at Aquarena
Springs. It was held in October, Native American Heritage Month, in conjunction
with the Sacred Springs Powwow and concurrent with earth-oven and stone-boiling
experiments conducted by students from the Departments of Anthropology at Texas
State University and Texas A&M University. Representatives of the Comanche
Nation and various Coahuiltecan groups visited with us as we carried out our
experiments. This event was co-sponsored by the Department of Anthropology and
the Meadows Center for Water and the Environment at Texas State University,
along with the Archaeological Ecology Lab at Texas A&M University. Approximately
175 people attended.
These Hot Rocks Cook Offs afforded unusual and quite informative
opportunities for archaeologists and Indians to visit and commensurate about
ancient cooking technologies. It is noteworthy that the Native American participants
included individuals with long-term working relationships with non-Indian
archaeologists, including those who helped organized the cookoffs. Consultations
with tribal representatives reveal a diversity of perspectives regarding the value of
archaeological research. Fortunately, there are usually individuals out there who are
willing to bridge conflicts in fashions they see as beneficial to, or at least protective
of, tribal concerns. Said differently, sustained collaboration, via our common interests
in ancient foodways, affords reliable and unimpeded pathways toward allaying
suspicions and forming alliances between tribal groups and archaeologists, especially
those involved in cultural resources management where consultation is mandated
legally (cf. Thoms 2015).

CHAPTER 11:
starch grain analysis: Background,
methods, and contamination issues

Andrew R. Laurence16

Archeologists rely on charred USO macrofossils from earth ovens to provide
direct evidence of the role of geophytes in ancient subsistence pursuits at Fort Hood
and elsewhere in western North America (Mehalchick et al. 2004; Thoms 2009a,
2009b). In the study area, as well as many other regions of the world, however,
charcoal of any kind is not abundantly preserved (Collins 2004:109). Our initial
studies indicated that phytoliths, starch granules, and calcium oxalate crystals
may be more resilient to degradation than charcoal and perhaps routinely present
in the remains of earth ovens (see Chapter 10; Thoms et al. 2011). Starch granule
analysis is increasingly used by archeologists to provide direct evidence of plant
utilization. Experiments suggest that residues from starch-rich plants adhere to
artifacts during cooking and food-processing activities and archeological studies
illustrate that ancient starch granules found on artifacts afford direct evidence of
ancient plant use (Fullagar 2006:195; Messner 2011; Thoms et al. 2011; Torrence
2006:17; Zarrillo et al. 2008).
STARCH TAPHONOMY and research background
Researchers interested in using starch granules as evidence of past
subsistence practices often note that comparatively little attention has been given
to taphonomic processes that affect starch-granules, especially as they relate to the
survival of identifiable specimens during cooking or natural weathering processes
(Barton and Matthews 2006; Chandler-Ezell et al. 2006; Haslam 2004; Perry et al.
2007; Thoms et al 2014). There is even less taphnomically oriented research about
how reliably identifiable starch granules might survive these processes. There is an
abundance of evidence showing that starch granules adhere to artifacts as a result of
processing and cooking activities. There is also ample evidence that modern starch
can contaminate artifacts during and after excavation (Laurence et al. 2011; Loy
and Barton 2006; Wadley and Lombard 2007).
Modification of Starch During Plant Processing and Cooking
Several studies suggest that identifiable starch granules are not likely to
survive the cooking process (e.g., Crowther et al. 2003; Henry et al. 2009). When
16

217

218

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

starch is exposed to heat and moisture, the semicrystalline structure of individual
starch granules break down via a process called gelatinization (Reichert 1913).
The granules are not usually identifiable given that diagnostic characteristics,
especially as visible lamellae, are damaged or obscured (Henry et al. 2009). There
are, however, studies that demonstrate otherwise. Henry et al. (2009) reported as
much as 50 percent of starch from various domesticated species remained identifiable
after 10 minutes of boiling. Messner and Schindler (2010) noted that some starch
granules in green arrow arum (Peltandra virginica) rizomes were identifiable after
12 hours of cooking in an earth oven. Similarly, experiments conducted by Thoms
et al. (2011, 2014) and reported in the present volume (see Chapter 13) indicate
that starch granules can remain identifiable even after 40 hours of baking in an
earth oven. Interestingly, the concept of starch surviving intact after exposure to
heat and moisture is better known and understood in the cereal and crop sciences.
A review of the starch literature reveals how identifiable starch granules
survive cooking episodes due to one or more processes. First, insufficient quantities
of water in a given cell may prevent complete gelatinization of all the starch
within the cell (Sumnu et al. 1999). Second, smaller-sized starch granules tend
to be more resistant to gelatinization (Eliasson and Karlsson 1983). Third, if a
starch-rich storage organ is not heated for a long enough period of time, complete
gelatinization will not occur (Lund 1984). Finally, starch granules can be protected
from gelatinization when they are coated with fat or sugar (Lin et al. 1997; Sumnu
et al. 1999).
To further assess the degree to which identifiable starch granules survive
cooking, Laurence analyzed commercial corn chips. He used a clean toothpick to
scrape a corn (i.e., maize) chip and smeared the recovered material onto a microscope
slide and mounted it in water. Identifiable maize starch granules were recovered
from the sample (Figure 11.1), confirming that starch can survive both the grinding
and flash cooking characteristic of the processed-food industry.
Starch Granule Survival in Soils
Several factors are believed to influence the survival of starch in a sediment
matrix, including enzymatic decay, microorganisms, moisture, temperature, and
pH levels, none of which are necessarily mutually exclusive (Haslam 2004). Starch
granules deposited in sediments serve as a major source of energy for both bacteria
and fungi (Haslam 2004; Ohta 1997). To aid in the metabolizing of starch, these
organisms produce polysaccharidases, enzymes that break down starch and act as
a catalyst to lower the activation energy required for starch to chemically break
down through a process termed “hydrolysis” (Greenwood and Milne 1968; Haslam
2004; Ohta 1997). In addition to bacteria and fungi, many plants and animals utilize
polysaccharidases either as part of their digestive system as in the case of animals,
or as part of an energy storage and use system employed by plants (Haslam 2004).
When plant and animal cellular material decay polysaccharidases and other enzymes
are released into the soil (Burns 1982). As a result of microbial activity, fungal
activity, and decaying cellular material, significant quantities of polysaccharidases

are present in most soils and substantially limits long-term survival of naturally
occurring starch granules (Burns 1982; Haslam 2004).

break down the center of starch granules and then break down the remainder from
the center toward the edges (Barton and Matthews 2006:87).

Cheshire et al. (1974) estimate that
20–30 percent of all microbes in any given soil
utilize starch as a primary food source. Starcheating microbes can be found in virtually every type
of soil. Experiments reveal that when wheat starch
is added to a fallow loamy soil, the carbohydrate
levels within the soils returned to normal within
28 days, suggesting that almost all of the added
starch had been consumed (Cheshire et al. 1969),
presumably as a result of increased microbial and
fungal activity that followed the addition of starch.
In another experiment, 10 percent of
the added wheat starch survived after 8 weeks
(Cheshire et al. 1974). Within sandy loams and
clays, 20 percent of starch added to the soils was
consumed within the first three days, while over

220

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

50 percent was consumed within 24 days (Adu and Oades 1978). These studies
suggest that starch survival follows an asymptotic curve where there is a high loss
of starch granules within the first few days followed by a noticeable decrease in the
starch decomposition rate (Cheshire et al. 1969; Haslam 2004). These studies also
indicate that although the rate of starch decomposition varies with soil type and
other environmental factors, starch is unlikely to survive in sediments unless they
are in a protected setting (Haslam 2004).
Soil moisture, temperature, and pH have both direct and indirect impacts on
starch survival (Haslam 2004). Changes in soil moisture can cause a starch grain
to shrink and swell, thereby damaging the starch. Once damaged, starch becomes
more susceptible to microbial attack (Leach and Schoch 1961). Similar to moisture,
the freezing and thawing of soils can damage starch (Babot 2003).
Starch-eating microbes favor acidic soils, the result being that that starch
is expected to have a much lower survival rate in those soils (Cheshire 1979:291).
Although microorganisms and fungi are the underlying reason for starch degradation,
other factors such as moisture, temperature, and pH can aid or hinder starch
preservation either through directly damaging starch via mechanical weathering
or increasing the number of starch eating microbes in soils (Haslam 2004).
Although microbial activity adversely affects starch survival in soils, there
are several environmental conditions that favor starch survival. Starch granules
have an increased survival rate in soils if they are in a protective environment such
as a soil aggregate or encased in heavy metals, as well as when they are near or on
an artifact (Guggenberger et al. 1999; Haslam 2004). Heavy metals within soils and
soils with high clay content tend to favor starch survival given that they neutralize
enzymes (Deng and Tabatabai 1995; Doelman and Hannstra 1979; Ross 1983). Soil
aggregates and artifacts limit the amount of surface area exposed to microbial and
fungi predation (Guggenberger et al. 1999; Haslam 2004).
Starch granules also move through and within soil profiles, especially via
groundwater (Therin 2006). Therin (2006) notes that starch granules smaller than 5
µm move farther down a soil profile and travel faster than granules larger granules.
Accordingly, the distance starch moves in a given profile is determined by the size
of the starch granules, porosity of the soil, and amount of rainfall in a given area
(Therin 2006).
Starch Preservation on Artifacts
In an experimental study aimed at understanding how different depositional
environments affect starch granule survival on artifacts, Lu (2006) used stone tools
to grind different types of seeds and tubers. Sixteen rocks were cleaned using a
toothbrush and running water. Each rock was then used to grind one of four starchrich plants: foxtail millet (Setaria sativa) and rice (Oryza sativa) seeds along with
yam (Dioscorea sp.) and taro (Colocasia sp.) tubers. Sample areas on the grinding

Chapter 11

surfaces were then delineated, and the starch granules were counted. One set of
tools was buried 5 cm below surface in sandy soil, one set was left on the surface
exposed to the elements, and the final set was placed in a rockshelter. At least
one tool used to grind each species was placed in all three settings. After 71 days
the tools were collected and the remaining starch granules in the selected areas
were counted. On average, the survival rate of starch on buried tools was 74.8
(±3.8) percent; 80.2 (±3.2) percent for tools placed in a rockshelter; 30.3 percent for
the tools placed on the open surface but, in the latter case, the rate ranged greatly,
from 1.6 to 64.6 percent. As per Lu (2006), there is little utility in conducting starch
analysis on surface-collected artifacts.
Potential for Modern Starch Contamination
The study of archeological starch remains also depends heavily on a firm
basis for understanding the potential for modern contamination. There are at
least three sources of contamination in which starch granules can enter into
the archeological record: airborne starch; starch transferred by means of direct
contact; and “precontaminated” laboratory equipment. As used herein, “modern
starch contamination” refers to starch granules deposited on artifacts when they
are reexposed to the atmosphere at the time of excavation or during subsequent
handling in the field or laboratory.
Airborne Starch
Barton and Matthews (2006) noted the possibility that airborne starch
deposited on artifacts during excavation could affect interpretations of “fossil”
starch granules. To ascertain the presence of airborne starch contamination from
industrial activity, Loy and Barton (2006) suggested exposing microscope slides
to the atmosphere during excavation. Archeologists have also tested for airborne
starch contamination by leaving microscope slides exposed to the air inside research
laboratories and curation facilities (Loy and Barton 2006; Parr 2002; Zarrillo and
Kooyman 2006). Nugent (2006) recovered unmodified and damaged airborne starch
granules, averaging 12.6 µm and 18.4 µm in size, from curation facility and a lab,
respectively. Williamson (2006) identified contamination within the lab from starch
granules that originated from a nearby flour mill.
Our literature review and related experiments revealed a significant
potential for natural, as opposed to industrially generated, airborne storage starch
to contaminate artifacts and sediments (Laurence et al. 2011). Natural airborne
starch includes granules that emanate from ruptured pollen grains. Starch granules
within pollen grains of starch-rich plants, often described as storage starch, provide
energy for growth of the pollen tube (Baker and Baker 1979; Grayum 1985). There
are several natural pathways by which starch in pollen can be liberated. Especially
common is the rupturing of pollen grains during thunderstorms by means of osmotic
shock from electrical charging and thunder (Suphioglu et al. 1992; Taylor et al. 2007).
Starch can be expulsed through a fracture or through an aperture in the pollen
grain, which can occur on the ground or in midair (El-Ghazaly et al. 1996; Taylor
and Jonsson 2004; Taylor et al. 2007). Pollen grains from wind-pollinated species in

221

222

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

particular (e.g., birch, maize, and other grasses) are prone to rupture due to their
size or thin walls (exines). Some wind-pollinated grains lack pollen tubes and are
designed to rupture, enabling genetic material to complete fertilization (Wodehouse
1935:351). Apart from ruptured pollen grains, starch can become airborne as starchrich plants decay. Regardless of whether starch granules are released from pollen
grains or decaying plants, they can become airborne and thereby contaminate
artifacts and sediments (Laurence et al. 2011).
Transmission of Starch via Direct Contact
Starch granules can be transmitted from a person’s hands to another object
after handling starch-rich plants, foods, or industrial products (Fullagar 2006:189;
Wadley and Lombard 2007). Contact between starch-rich plants and field equipment
can also transfer starch granules from one object to another. Starch granules in
the roots of starch-rich plants (Gott et al. 2006:36) might be transferred during
excavation when a trowel cuts through a root (as often happens) and then contacts
an artifact.
Precontaminated Laboratory Equipment
Since starch can be airborne or attach to people’s hands and clothing, it
stands to reason that any indoor facility or laboratory where starch grain analysis is
undertaken may already be contaminated. Airborne starch contamination of indoor
curation and lab facilities is confirmed by previous researchers (Loy and Barton
2006; Nugent 2006; Parr 2002; Williamson 2006). As a byproduct of this Fort Hood
research, Laurence et al. (2011) reported the recovery of various combinations of
starch granules, phytoliths, calcium oxalate crystals, and plant fibers in air traps
placed in outdoor settings and inside laboratories.
Significance of the Starch Contamination Findings
Preliminary analytical results and interpretations presented herein attested
to microfossil contamination at various stages of artifact recovery and processing,
both in the field and in the lab (see Chapter 14). Given the importance of earth oven
research and its purported potential to inform upon past subsistence strategies
(Black and Thoms 2014; Thoms 2009a, 2008a, 2008b), the potential for modern
starch granule contamination merits considerable attention. The manner in which
our project unfolded over more than three years afforded opportunities to assess
whether modern contamination and naturally occurring starch of any age can be
reliably differentiated from archeologically relevant starch granules. As a spinoff
of these Fort Hood studies, the author and others published the methods and
initial results of contamination studies in a Journal of Ethnobiology article titled,
“Airborne Starch Granules as a Potential Contamination Source at Archeological
Sites.” Laurence et al. (2011:224) found that: (1) starch granules are present in
pollen grains that are transported by wind and insects; and (2) starch granules in
the atmosphere originate from natural and human activities. Based on these two
significant findings, the authors concluded that “the mere presence of starch on an
artifact cannot always be assumed be the result of plant utilization” (Laurence et al.

Chapter 11

2011:224). In light of our “discovery” of airborne starch contaminants in 2010, we
incorporated methods of measuring and factoring out the background contamination
into field sampling and laboratory extraction protocols used in 2011 and 2012.
SAMPLING AND ANALYTICAL METHODS AND CONTROLS
This section presents the analysis methods and controls used in the recovery
and analysis of microfossils from the following sources:

Reference Collection: Fresh Samples
To analyze archeological microfossils from prehistoric cooking features at
Fort Hood, we needed to create a reference collection of microfossils from the specific
plants and plant parts that were likely to have been baked in earth ovens in the
distant past, either as food or as packing materials. Gathering these plants became
an important goal of the project, and we eventually obtained a reference collection
of 18 species of particular interest in this project,17 as summarized in Table 11.1. For
interpreting economic plant use, the focus was on obtaining starch granules, along
with silica-based and calcium oxalate biominerals, from the USOs of 14 species of
fresh wild plant foods—geophytes, hemicryptophytes, and succulents. These species
were specifically selected because they are among the wild plants known or suspected
to have been important foods for the hunter-gatherers who occupied the Fort Hood
landscape and vicinity (Thoms 1994, 2004, 2008b, 2009b, 2010).
Microfossils from Quercus virginiana (live oak leaves and acorns) and
Schizachyrium scoparium (little bluestem grass seeds and stems) were also extracted
and described for purposes of comparison with archeological samples. These two
plants were analyzed because they may have been used as packing material
inside earth ovens, as suggested by ethnographic descriptions and our actualistic
The reference collection (fresh plant specimens, charred plant specimens, microfossil slides,
and digital images) is curated at the Archaeological-Ecology Laboratory in the Department of
Anthropology at Texas A&M University.

experiments (Thoms et al. 2011, 2014). Given that Zea mays (maize) starch granules
are among the most common of starches found in modern airborne starch samples,
we also extracted starch from a sample of dried seeds for comparative purposes
(Laurence et al. 2011).
Starch granules and raphides (i.e., a form of calcium oxalate crystals) were
extracted following procedures reported by Field (2006). Each specimen’s storage
organ, leaf, or stem was bisected with a clean razor blade. For the plant-food storage
organs, new toothpicks were used to scrape the inside of each storage organ. Two
samples were taken from each storage organ, and the material on the toothpicks was
smeared onto microscope slides and allowed to dehydrate. One sample was mounted
with water for analysis and the other with Permount for curation purposes. For
the live oak leaves and little bluestem grass stems, the interior of each sample was
smeared directly onto microscope slides, allowed to dehydrate, and then mounted
separately with water and Permount.
To obtain phytoliths, a small segment of each USO, bud, stem, seed/acorn, or
leaf was left in bleach until all of the organic tissues oxidized (Pearsall 2000:339).
Samples were then rinsed with distilled water, centrifuged, and decanted three

Chapter 11

times to remove the bleach. Material remaining after decanting was placed on a
microscope slide and allowed to dehydrate. The samples were mounted separately
in water for analysis and Permount for curation.
Starch granules from maize, eastern springbeauty, false garlic, and rain lily
were also observed under a scanning electron microscope (SEM). They were prepared
by either smearing starch from storage organs onto a carbon-coated aluminum stub
or placing a drop of material on a stub after sonication of pollen, which was then
allowed to dehydrate. All samples were vapor-coated with iodine-potassium-iodide
(IKI) solution so as to allow better observation of starch with backscatter electrons
(BSE) and during elemental analysis and mapping. Importantly, IKI solution only
reacts with and coats starch granules (Gott et al. 2006). After the samples were
vapor-coated with IKI, they were coated with carbon to prevent charging of the
samples during SEM observation. Observing starch granules under BSE confirms
that the observed objects are starch granules, since the higher atomic mass of iodine,
relative to the carbon background, produces more backscatter electrons, thereby
making the starch granules appear white against a black background (Petersen
et al. 1983). Similarly, elemental analysis and mapping also indicates the presence
of starch due to its ability to detect high concentrations of iodine and potassium
that is the result of the reaction between IKI vapor and starch.
Reference Collection: Experimentally Baked
and Residue Samples
The next important part of compiling a useful reference collection was to take
modern plants and subject them to cooking under experimental conditions to create
comparative samples of cooked microfossils. The experimental work was planned
to mimic baking in an earth oven. An important goal was to track the movement of
the microfossils under various baking conditions (see Chapters 12 and 13).
Recovery of microfossils from inside baked USOs followed similar procedures
described for fresh samples. Readily visible brown residues on the sides, bottom,
and lids of the glass and ceramic bowls were recovered using a new toothpick to
scrape a portion of the material and smear it onto a microscope slide. The residue
on the slides was allowed to dehydrate prior to being mounted separately in water
and in Permount.
A different set of procedures was used to process the cotton cloths and green
packing materials. A small piece of each cotton cloth or green packing material
visibly stained with residue was removed and placed in a 50-ml test tube filled with
distilled water. Test tubes were vortexed until the water turned a dark brown color.
They were then centrifuged at 2300 revolutions per minute (RPM) to concentrate the
material, and the supernate was decanted. A sample of the material was transferred
from each test tube onto microscope slides using a pipette. The material was allowed
to dehydrate, and the slides were mounted separately in water and Permount.
To test for microfossils deposited during the vapor experiment, residues
adhering to the suspended slide and to the sides (but not the bottom) of the baking
beakers were washed separately into a 50-ml test tube using filtered tapwater. The

225

226

fact that these residues were sparse and only faintly visible prompted us to use this
wash-and-concentrate technique rather than the toothpick-smear method. Recovered
material was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 2300 RPM to concentrate the microfossils.
The supernate was decanted, and the remaining material was mounted on a slide.
Baked taproots were sampled for microfossils by dissecting them using a sterile
razor blade and scrapping the inner tissue with a toothpick. Material adhering to
the toothpick was smeared on a microscope slide and mounted with water.
Analysis Methods for Curated Artifacts, Sediment,
and Charred Bulbs
We began our analysis of archeological samples with curated artifacts,
sediment samples, and charred camas bulbs that were previously recovered from
Fort Hood sites with well-preserved earth ovens. While part of the overall Paluxy
research project, these previously excavated sites were not sampled for the present
microfossil-analysis investigations. Nineteen curated artifacts were analyzed:
(1) five groundstone tools; (2) one pitted stone; (3) two cores; (4) one hammerstone;
and (5) 10 pieces of FCR from earth-oven heating elements (see Chapters 14 and
15). In addition, 5 charred camas bulbs and 14 earth-oven sediment samples were
processed for microfossils, along with 3 offsite sediment samples.
All of the artifacts were first examined under a Wild M3Z Type-S microscope,
at x6.5-x25 power, to identify potential residue deposits. Ideally, cooking residue
shows up as dark-brown to black stains, sometimes tiny globs, on the surface or
embedded in cracks and crevices. Such readily observed residue was not apparent
on any of the samples. Two methods were used to in extracting less visible residue:
(1) an initial method that entailed dislodging residue from unwashed surfaces; and
(2) a revised method wherein the area of the artifact to be sampled was rinsed with
distilled prior to extracting residue. The methods used to extract microfossils from
the artifact are listed in Table 11.2.
The first lab method was a modified version of a pipette extraction method
described by Fullagar (2006). Instead of using the tip of a pipette to dislodge
microfossils from the surface bathed in distilled water, a sonicating toothbrush was
employed. For groundstone tools, at least three surfaces were processed; including
the ground face, the nonground face, if such existed, and one broken edge, if present,
as a “control” for post-use contamination. For FCR samples, the upper and bottom
sides were analyzed, the bottom side being the one with a greater amount of calcium
carbonate accumulation and the top side being the one with most excavator-trowel
marks. Once the residue was removed, the water containing it was transferred to
15 µm centrifuge tubes. They were then centrifuged at 2,300 RPM for one minute,
and the supernate was decanted. The remaining material was placed on a microscope
slide, where it was allowed to dehydrate under the cover of a sterile Petri dish so
as to avoid airborne contamination. Once dehydrated, the samples were mounted
in Permount for curation purposes (Field 2006).
As discussed later in this chapter, after processing and analyzing several
curated ground-stone tools and finding what seemed to be an unusual quantity

* Curated artifacts are from three sites: 41CV595, 41CV1049, and 41CV1553. Sites 41CV1049 and 41CV1553
were investigated as part of this project, but the 41CV1049 work occurred before the microfossil sampling
program began. Site 41CV595 is the Firebreak site, previously investigated by PAI archeologists in 2000
(Mehalchick et al. 2004).

of well-preserved starch granules, we suspected that the curated artifacts had
been “contaminated” by recent airborne starch granules and/or during excavation,
analysis, and curation. Accordingly, we adjusted our processing methods. The
remaining artifacts were “cleaned” by gently washing them with distilled water and
following up with the same steps described above. In one case, Sample 9, adhering
sediments were removed by means of dry brushing rather than washing them away
with distilled water.
For each earth-oven sediment sample, 20 g of what was originally curated
for future flotation purposes was obtained, processed, and analyzed for microfossils.
Due to the high concentrations of clay, these samples were deflocculated using a
solution of 5 percent Calgon and 95 percent distilled water (Faegri and Iversen
1989:76). Once deflocculated, the Calgon/water solution was removed from the
sample by adding distilled water, centrifuging, and decanting the samples until
the Calgon was removed, as indicated by clear water (Faegri and Iversen 1989:77).
The sediment was then screened with a 150 µm screen to remove particles larger
significantly larger than the targeted microfossils. Heavy density separation was
then performed using zinc bromide with a 2.38 specific gravity to separate the less
dense microfossils from the denser sediments. Zinc bromide was then washed out of
the samples by adding distilled water, centrifuging, and decanting. The remaining
material for each sample was mounted on slides with Permount.

The charred camas bulbs were processed by breaking apart the bulbs and
grinding a small fragment of each bulb into a fine powder. The ground material was
placed on microscope slides and sealed with Permount.
Analysis Methods for Samples from 41CV984 and 41CV1657
Sample recovery methods were consistent between the 2010 field season,
when earth ovens at sites 41CV984 and 41CV1657 (Gully Mouth site) were
excavated, and the 2011 and 2012 seasons, when ovens at the other four sites were
excavated. Laboratory processing methods, however, differed somewhat between
the 2010 and 2011–2012 field seasons, given that calcium carbonate deposits were
not as evident on the FCR recovered and analyzed in 2011–2012 and in light of our
realization that we needed to sample a large surface area on each piece of FCR.
The methods described in this section are those used for specimens recovered
in 2010 from 41CV984 and 41CV1657, but the discussion also provides background
for field sampling methods employed at the other four sites discussed later. In all
cases, we collected more FCR and sediment samples than could be analyzed within
the established funding limitations. Some 20–30 percent of recovered FCR was
analyzed for the present project, and the remainder is curated for possible future
analyses. Site and feature descriptions are presented in Chapter 10.
As each FCR sample was removed from its respective earth oven, its top
side (i.e., upper surface) was scraped purposefully with a trowel so that it could
be distinguished readily in the lab from the specimen’s bottom (i.e., lower) side.
Associated sediment samples, which either adhered to the bottom side of a given
sample or were obtained from sediment immediately underlying the sample, were
also collected and analyzed for microfossils or curated for future use.
Control samples were taken to assess the amount of possible contamination
at both sites. From 41CV984 we collected the following: (1) four sediment samples
from the portion of the Bt horizon below the lowest heating-element feature; (2) one
control rock sample (exposed bedrock); (3) eight onsite/off-feature sediment samples;
(4) eight offsite sediment samples; and (5) three air samples. From 41CV1657, we
collected: (1) six rock control samples; and (2) two air samples. All archeological and
control samples were collected using powder-free latex gloves.
Eleven pieces of FCR were analyzed from the earth-oven mound at 41CV984,
representing what was identified as eight superimposed heating elements. Also
analyzed were sediments associated with each piece of FCR along with one of the
sediment samples from beneath the oven bottom (see Chapters 14 and 15).
Processing the FCR samples for microfossils began by washing each specimen
in distilled water to remove postdepositional contamination. Given our expectations
that microfossils would be rather abundant on heating-element rocks and to allow
for comparisons between and among FCR specimens, we sampled only a 12 cm
area of each side of each specimen. In doing so, the calcium carbonate deposit,
which at 41CV984 tended to be readily apparent, was removed from the top and
bottom surfaces of each sample and dissolved slowly in glacial acetic acid (Figure
11.3). This process had to be done slowly, allowing 1–3 weeks of dissolution time, so

Figure 11.3

that embedded starch granules
would not be damaged. Once
dissolved, the glacial acetic
acid was removed by adding
distilled water, centrifuging,
and decanting three times.
The remaining material was
mounted on slides with a 50:50
ratio of water and glycerin or in
Permount for curation.

(b) 41CV1657, Feature 3a. The red circle indicates sampled locations.

The rational for
extracting microfossils from
calcium carbonate deposits is that those deposits began to form in the immediate
aftermath of a given baking event, with decomposition of the packing material and
normal soil illuviation. As per our working model, microfossils and other organic
matter, along with minerals in the sediment, move down the profile and a portion
thereof is deposited on the underlying FCR rocks and in sediment. We reasoned
that calcium carbonates might act to protect the microfossils from consumption by
soil microorganisms. Accordingly, microfossils embedded in the calcium carbonate
deposits are likely to represent different baking events during and, presumably
natural depositions long after, the ovens were abandoned (see Chapters 12 and 13;
Thoms et al. 2011; 2014).
To assess whether microfossils were embedded in crevices under the
calcium carbonate deposits, we also processed the surface of two FCR specimens
after removing the calcium-carbonate coat using the pipette extraction technique
described by Fullagar (2006:196). The slides were also mounted in 50:50 ratios of
water and glycerin or in Permount. When available, 20 g of sediment associated
with each piece of FCR was also processed and analyzed for microfossils using the
same methods described for processing curated sediment samples.
Naturally occurring limestone rocks collected as control samples were
processed by first washing them individually in distilled water to remove modern
contamination. Both sides of each sample were processed by adding a drop of distilled
water to the sample locations, which were about 2 cm in diameter. A sonicating
toothbrush was then used to to dislodge potential microfossils from the microcracks.
The material was pipetted off and placed into 15-ml test tubes where they were
centrifuged at 2,300 RPM to concentrate the material. The supernate was decanted,
and the remaining material was mounted on microscope slides with water.
Following suggestions in Loy and Barton (2006), the air at and near 41CV984
and 41CV1657 was sampled during our excavation work by leaving sterile 9-cm
petri dishes, each containing a lens of distilled water, at ground level for several
hours. Three of the air samples, exposed for 2, 7, and 8.5 hours were taken in the
grasslands around 41CV984 and two of the samples, exposed for 8 hours, were
taken in a wooded area at 41CV1657. When the petri dishes were returned to the
laboratory, the water was pipetted and placed in sterile 15-ml test tubes. Samples

230

were centrifuged, the supernate decanted, and the remaining material was placed
directly on slides for analysis using Permount as the mounting medium so as to
curate the slides.
Analysis Methods for FCR from Sites 41CV594, 41CV947,
41CV1104, and 41CV1553
During the 2011–2012 Phase II work, FCR was collected from earth ovens
and concentration of undetermined function at 41CV594, 41CV947, 41CV1104,
and 41CV1553 was collected following the same field methods used at 41CV984
and 41CV1657. We used powder-free latex gloves and a trowel washed with
rubbing alcohol between each sample. FCR samples and associated sediment were
immediately sealed in a sterile ziplock bag. We also took air samples and collected
offsite noncultural rocks as control samples. Fire-cracked rock samples from these
sites were selected to insure that multiple locations within heating elements were
represented in the analysis. To minimize postcollection contamination (described
below), a clean bench with a 0.5 µm filter was purchased and used to for all stages
of laboratory processing of the FCR from these sites.
Insofar as calcium carbonate deposits were not readily visible on most FCR
from these sites, the samples were washed with distilled or filtered water prior to
extracting residue using a sonicating toothbrush. We increased the area sampled
on a given piece of FCR from 1 to 26.4 cm2, the large size being derived from the
area of a convenient water-container lid used to demarcate the sample locality. Our
intent was to increase the starch-granule recovery rate from that achieved with FCR
from 41CV984 and 41CV1657. When CaCO3 deposits were visible, all of the CaCO3
within the delimited 26.4 cm2 area was scraped and dissolved in glacial acetic acid.
Once the CaCO3 was removed, the surface underneath the carbonates was sampled
using a sonicating toothbrush.
A total of 20 pieces of FCR, including 4 CaCO3 samples, 3 offsite control
samples, and 3 air samples was analyzed from 41CV594. Eight pieces of FCR,
4 offsite samples, and 3 air samples were analyzed from 41CV947. Six pieces of
FCR, 2 offsite samples, and 2 air samples were analyzed from 41CV1104. Finally,
13 pieces of FCR, including 4 CaCO3 samples, 3 offsite samples, and 3 air samples
were analyzed from 41CV1553.
STARCH CONTAMINATION:
PRESENCE, MINIMIZATION, AND CONTROLS
Starch granules can be transmitted from a person’s hands to another object
after handling starch-rich plants, foods, or industrial products (Fullagar 2006:189;
Wadley and Lombard 2007). To test this, the author cut and handled a Yukon gold
potato (Solanum tuberosum) in a fashion reminiscent of food preparation. He then
touched a clean microscope slide and a table, leaving behind a fingerprint on both
surfaces. A piece of clear “Scotch tape” was then used to remove the fingerprint from
the table surface. The adhering residues were then transferred from the piece of
tape to a clean microscope slide. Both the tape residue and the fingerprint directly

Chapter 11

applied to a slide were mounted
in distilled water. In both cases,
over 100 unmodified, diagnostic
potato starch granules were
recovered (Figure 11.4).
This experiment
confirms that starch granules
are not only transferred from
a plant to an analyst’s hands,
but it also demonstrates that
starch granules can then be
re-transmitted from someone’s
Figure 11.4. Potato starch granules recovered from: (a–c) author’s finhands to an artifact. In the latter

were transmitted from the
Figure 11.5
potato to a finger, from the finger
to a table, from the table to a tape, and then from
the tape to a microscope slide. In short, starch
granules inadvertently deposited on a microscope
slide can be several times removed from the
original source.

e

Contact between starch-rich plants
and field equipment can also transfer starch
granules from one object to another (Gott et al.
2006:36). If starch-rich roots, bulbs, taproots, or
other plant materials are cut during excavation
with a trowel, as often happens, and the trowel
then contacts an artifact, starch granules may
be transferred to that artifact. To assess this
hypothesis, Laurence used a clean knife to cut
through a groundnut (Apios americana) tuber
in one stroke (Figure 11.5). The knife was then
scraped against a toothpick and any adhering
residue and transferred to a microscope slide.
Hundreds of starch granules and raphides were
recovered from the residue (Figure 11.6).
Laurence also assessed the effectiveness
of washing artifacts prior to sampling to reduce
contamination. He sterilized a rock by soaking
it overnight in bleach (5 percent hypochlorite)
and rinsed it with distilled water to remove the
bleach. To simulate a plant-processing artifact, he
used the rock to pound an Irish potato (Solanum
tuberosum) and left it in his backyard for 30 days
during which it was exposed to several rainfall

episodes. The simulated artifact
was recovered and washed in
a beaker of distilled water by
lightly brushing it with a sterile
toothbrush. After it dried, it
was processed and analyzed for
microfossils in the same fashion
as were archeological specimens.
Only potato starch granules
were recovered (Figure 11.7a–c).

gentle washing would remove
recent contamination, the same
rock was lightly coated with
maize starch to simulate starch
rain. It was then washed and
processed for starch. Maize
starch was recovered from the
rock after it was washed (see
Figure 11.7d), although in very
small quantities, especially
when compared to the amount
of recovered potato starch (see
Figure 11.7c). This experiment
suggests that washing an
artifact in distilled water
using a sterile toothbrush can
remove the majority of airborne
contamination while leaving
the majority of “archeological
starch” intact.

We also took an air
sample adjacent to a road on the
Texas A&M University campus
in College Station, Texas (Figure
11.8). The curbside locality was
a place where acorns fell from a live oak tree (Q. viriniana) branch overhanging
the street and were subsequently being crushed by passing automobiles. After
one hour the sample was collected and examined. Thousands of live oak starch
granules were present in the air sample (Figure 11.9). While the physical force
of passing automobiles was responsible for rupturing the acorns, this experiment
suggests that starch-rich plants are likely to emit starch granules as they degrade.
Whether crushed by wild animals, rolling rocks, or damaged by human activities
unrelated to plant use, starch granules from strarch-rich plants in any given area
are likely to be are released into the atmosphere (Laurence et al. 2011).

is 25 μm.

Figure 11.8

Starch granules are used
in a wide range of industrial and
consumer products, including
as a powder on latex gloves
(Laurence et al. 2011). Given
that “powder-free” latex gloves
are manufactured in the same
factories as their powdered
counterparts, they are subject to
contamination by airborne starch
within the factory (Swanson and
Ramalingam 2002). Analysis
of a random sample of powderfree gloves used for the present
project revealed maize starch
on every glove (Figure 11.10).
Of particular interest was the
recovery of granules that were
physically modified via milling
(see Figure 11.10a, c, and f),
as well as gelatinized granules
(Figure 11.10d). Unmodified
starch granules (Figure 11.10b)
and starch granules undergoing
hydrolysis (Figure 11.10e) were
also recovered.

Historically, ancient
starch researchers would assert
that the damaged starch grains
observed in Figure 11.10a, c, and
f are indicative of past milling
activity based on the presence of
fractures and fissures radiating

damage (Babot 2003). These
starch granules probably did
undergo milling activities,
although it was from modern industrial activities rather than ancient plant use.
Furthermore, starch researchers have also considered the presence of gelatinized
starch as proof of ancient plant use since it was believed that starch only
gelatinized during cooking activities where there is sufficient heat and moisture
for gelatinization to occur (Henry et al. 2009). The presence of gelatinized starch
on modern latex gloves clearly indicates that other processes besides cooking can
introduce gelatinized starch into an archeological sample. Had the gloves never
been tested for starch granules, the recovery of these types of starch granules in

A&M University.

archeological samples may have been interpreted as evidence of ancient plant use
rather than contamination.
Contamination Testing of Laboratory Space and Equipment
The two labs that were used during the course of this project, by the
Archaeological-Ecology Laboratory (AEL) and the Palynology Research Laboratory
(PRL), both at Texas A&M University, were tested for airborne contamination, as
were materials used during various stages of starch granule analysis. To test for
possible starch contamination, sterilized petri dishes with a thin layer of distilled
water were placed in both labs for two consecutive periods of 48 hours. The water was
pipetted out of the petri dishes into 15-ml test tubes and centrifuged to concentrate
any trapped material. After the supernate was decanted, the remaining material
was mounted on a slide with Permount for analysis.
Laboratory supplies tested for starch granules included unused sterile
15-ml and 50-ml test tubes, microscope slides, coverslips, zinc bromide, 400-ml
and 1000-ml beakers, pipettes, sonicating toothbrush heads, powder-free gloves,
one-dram vials, Permount, and distilled water. Slides and coverslips from open and
unopened boxes were examined for starch using a polarized-light microscope. To
test the distilled water (DI), a 50-ml test tube was rinsed with ethanol to remove
potential contamination and allowed to dry. Once dry, 50 ml of DI water was added
to the test tube, centrifuged, and decanted. The remaining material was mounted on
a previously cleaned microscope slide. Since microscope slides and coverslips were
potential contamination sources, the slide and coverslip were rinsed with ethanol
to remove potential contamination and allowed to dry before the material from the
water was placed onto the slide. Once it was determined that the distilled water
was free of starch, it was used in testing microscope slides and coverslips out of
unopened boxes.

Methods Summary
Methods employed to minimize contamination and establish controls for
distinguishing naturally from anthropogenically derived microfossils entailed:
(1) using powder-free latex gloves to prevent transmission of starch granules from
excavator hands to FCR samples; as noted, however, these gloves also proved to
have some starch granules and thus are likely to have a been a consistent source of
contamination (see Chapter 15); (2) dry brushing or light washing FCR to remove
loosely adhering starch granules that may have been deposited as contamination;
(3) sampling a specified area of uniform size on each piece of FCR to standardize
the comparison of starch concentrations; (4) processing ostensibly unused sides of
groundstone artifacts and freshly broken edges of FCR for comparison to used and
exposed sufaces, respectively; (5) using a sonicating toothbrush to dislodge starch
granules in FCR microcracks, (6) processing CaCO3 deposits on FCR samples insofar
as those deposits may encapsulate and protect starch granules from weathering
and microorganisms; (7) using air samples as controls for airborne contamination;
(8) using noncultural, offsite rock samples as controls for “natural” microfossil
accumulation during the near and distant in the past; (9) increasing surfacesampling area between field seasons; and (10) using a clean bench for our secondseason analysis. These changes we made in our sampling and processing methods
over a three-year course afforded an opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of
methods we used to control for microfossil contamination (see Table 11.2).

Electric Oven Experiments
in Microfossil Taphonomy18

Alston V. Thoms, Andrew R. Laurence, Laura M. Short, and Masahiro Kamiya

Generating reliable information from plant-food microfossils preserved in
ancient earth ovens requires an adequate understanding of microfossil taphonomy.
Plant-food microfossils follow pathways from their raw state, eventually becoming
baked residue on heating-element rocks, where they may or may not be preserved
through the millennia. These pathways are archeologically relevant to the study of
earth ovens but, as discussed here, they are complex. Targeted microfossils likely
to be embedded in baking residue somehow found their way onto heating-element
rocks with which the food is unlikely to have been in direct contact. In earth oven
baking, green/moist packing materials typically separate the food from red-hot rocks
to insulate it from combustion. As such, it becomes necessary to identify indirect
taphonomic pathways that the targeted microfossils might follow to reach heatingelement rocks, which is to say in the absence of direct plant-to-artifact contact.
STArCH SURVIVAL AND INDIRECT TAPHONOMIC
PATHWAYS
Much of the literature on starch taphonomy concerns preservation issues in
sediments, on artifacts, and during cooking (Barton and Matthews 2006; Haslam
2009a; Henry et al. 2009; Messner 2011; Messner and Schindler 2010; Therin 1998;
Therin et al. 1999). Other studies address the biological function of starch granules,
phytoliths, and calcium oxalate crystals in plants (e.g., Haslam 2004; Miller 1992;
Monje and Baran 2002; Piperno 2006). Considerable research has also been done
on the consumption of these plant microfossils by microbial organisms in the soil
(e.g., Bot and Benites 2005; Cromack et al. 1977; Haynes and Francis 1993; Martin
1945, 1946; Webster et al. 2008). Additional information on the effects of cooking and
below-ground natural processes in transforming and preserving starch granules is
presented in Chapters 11 and 13. A few studies demonstrate that ancient plant-food
starch granules and phytoliths can be recovered from FCR and fired-clay nodules
(e.g., Poverty Point objects) presumed to have functioned as heating elements in
earth ovens or for stone-boiling (e.g., Cummings 1994, 2006; Perry 2010; Simms
et al. 2013). Although this research pertains to stone boiling, it is relevant to the
topic at hand, given that water is also a key component in earth-oven technology.
This original draft of this chapter was the final draft of a manuscript submitted to, revised
in response to reviewers’ comments, and published with minor revisions in the Journal of
Archaeological Method and Theory (Thoms et al. 2014).

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

With vast numbers of plant-food microfossils involved in geophyte baking,
it seems plausible that some of them would survive the process and that at least a
few of those might be preserved adequately enough on FCR for identification. What
seemingly argues to the contrary is the likelihood that starch and other microfossils
would be combusted by temperatures that often exceed 500oC, as is the case when
rocks are heated red-hot to fire an earth oven (Gose 2000; Jackson 1998). Moreover,
starch granules experimentally subjected to boiling or baking undergo gelatinization
that ostensibly renders most of them unidentifiable; the longer they are cooked, the
less identifiable they are (Babot 2003; Henry et al. 2009; Reichert 1913). Wheat-flour
starch, which is well studied, is transformed through swelling, loss of birefringence,
melting, loss of crystallinity, increase of viscosity of the suspension, and leaching
of amylose from the granules (Primo-Martin et al. 2007). The crystalline structure
in some of the granules, however, is recovered sufficiently during the process of
retrogradation for taxonomic identification.
In general, the extent of gelatinization, and hence a significant aspect of
taxonomic identification potential, is controlled by moisture content, temperature,
and cooking time. These attributes are sufficiently variable in most baking processes
to allow for some identifiable starch granules to survive (Messner 2011:49–50). For
example, a study of wheat bread baked in tins concluded: “…that during baking ca.
40% of the starch in the crust does not gelatinize due to a lack of water. The fraction
that loses its crystallinity regains it by retrogradation but only after a long time. By
comparison, the gelatinized starch in the crumb [i.e., soft inner part of baked bread]
regains its crystallinity much faster. It is not clear if this is due to the lower water
content in the crust as compared to the crumb, as this would affect the kinetics of
recrystallization” (Primo-Martin et al. 2007:226).
Archeologists have shown that identifiable starch granules and raphides in
arrow arum (Peltandra virginica) rhizomes survived after baking in actualistic (i.e.,
experimentally built) earth ovens, one with and one without a rock heating element
(Messner and Schindler 2010). In both cases, all of the moisture for gelatinization
emanated from the food and packing materials, as water was not added to the
ovens. Starch granules in rhizomes that were quickly heated in close proximity to
hot rocks and baked for 3 hours exhibited more severe breakdown than did those
heated slowing and baked for 12 hours by an overlying fire. Their findings indicated
that “it is not solely the temperature involved in the cooking process but rather the
various heat transfer mechanisms used and the micro-climatic conditions they create
that affect starch grain integrity most severely” (Messner and Schindler 2010:334).
In a poster for the Australian Archaeological Association’s 2003 Poster
Gallery, titled “Mumu: Residue Analysis of Ethnographic and Archaeological
Cooking Stones from Papua New Guinea,” Alison Crowther, Micheal Haslam, and
Robin Torrence summarized results of microfossil analyses of cooking stones from
actualistic and archeological earth ovens. Various residues were recovered from
experimental cooking stones, including gelatinized starch granules. Nondiagnostic
charred plant tissue was found on a sample of cooking stones recovered from an
ancient earth oven; no starch granules were found on the archeological samples.
All of the microfossils were attributed to the wrapping material or fuel, rather than

Chapter 12

to the food. Lack of identifiable plant-food microfossils was consistent with the
researchers’ expectation that diagnostic food-tissue residue would be rare because
plant foods cooked in earth ovens generally do not come into direct contact with
the cooking stones.
As noted in Chapter 11, there are several pathways by which identifiable
starch granules survive the baking processes. First, too little water in a given cell
may not allow for gelatinization of all the starch therein (Sumnu et al. 1999). Second,
the small size of a given granule may prevent it from gelatinizing (Eliasson and
Karlsson 1983; Messner and Schindler 2010). Third, if a given portion of the geophyte
was not heated sufficiently long, gelatinization may not occur (Lund 1984; Messner
and Schindler 2010). Fourth, granules may be protected from gelatinization by a
fat or sugar coating (Lin et al. 1997; Sumnu et al. 1999). Such protective coatings
may be especially important in geophyte starch-granule preservation, given that
sugars make up a significant component of many USOs, including those used in the
present experiments (Yanovsky and Kingsbury 1938).
In spite of the pervasive roles of soil microorganisms in the consumption of
starch granules and other microfossils, numerous archeological studies have shown
that some microfossils survive these and other degradation processes in identifiable
forms (Messner 2011:50–52). For example, taro starch granules and xylem (i.e.,
vascular tissue) were recovered from sediment samples in an earth oven with a rock
heating element at an archeological site in New Zealand (Horrocks et al. 2004). To
the extent that plant-food starch granules from baking processes accumulate in
earth-oven sediments, which presumably were not in direct contact with the food, it
seems possible that they would accumulate as well on cooking-stones therein. Also
of relevance to the present investigations are experimental studies that assessed
the movement of starch granules in sediments under the influence of groundwater.
They indicate that, in general: (1) smaller granules move farther and faster than
larger ones; (2) downward movement prevails but lateral and upward movement
occurs as well; and (3) the movement of these granules in sediments should parallel
that of pollen (Haslam 2009a; Therin 1994).
To summarize the preceding section and chapters, as well as to set a stage
for the following discussions: (1) water is a major constituent of most USOs; (2) in
oven baking, water plays a key role in regulating starch gelatinization, which
in turn facilitates digestion; (3) water also plays a key role in hydrolysis, which
renders many USOs with complex carbohydrates, including inulin, more nutritious;
(4) water loss (i.e., through evaporation and dripping) from USOs and vegetal
packing material during earth oven baking is substantial; (5) identifiable starch
granules and other microfossils survive the baking process; and (6) groundwater is an
important mechanism for the translocation of microfossils in sediment. Collectively,
results of studies reviewed here and in Chapters 10 and 11 suggest that identifiable
starch granules and other microfossils that survive the baking process might be
deposited and preserved on FCR that functioned as heating-elements in earth ovens.
Ascertaining how and why plant-food residue is generated and transmitted is the
subject of experiments discussed in the following sections. Our two-part working
hypothesis is that:

239

240

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

1. Microfossils in various states of preservation are released from baking USOs
as they emit water; and
2. Vaporized and emanating liquid water are mechanisms for transporting and
depositing microfossils as components of emitted baking residue.

PROCEDURES AND METHODS
To address our hypotheses about survival of identifiable starch granules
and other microfossils in baking residue, we conducted experiments by baking wild
geophyte USOs in conventional (i.e., kitchen) and laboratory electric ovens. Our
primary objective was to determine whether the resulting baking residues deposited
on the insides of the bowls and on microscope slides suspended therein contained
identifiable microfossils. USOs were baked in ceramic and glass containers for a
few minutes to 12 hours at temperatures between 135 and 150oC (ca. 275–300oF).
Experimentally baked USOs and the residues deposited inside the various containers
were sampled and processed to ascertain the presence and the nature of baked
microfossils.
The first set of conventional-oven experiments, herein termed “simple,”
entailed wrapping a handful of raw USOs in cotton cloth and baking the food
bundle in an open glass bowl to which water was added periodically to keep the
wrapping cloth and food wet and thereby avoid burning during prolonged baking.
In the second set of conventional-oven experiments, termed “complex,” a similar
quantity of raw USOs was packed between layers of green-leaf packing material in
a closed glass or ceramic bowl. In the latter case, a lesser amount water was added
periodically to keep the contents sufficiently moist, as opposed to wet, and thereby
prevent burning. Both of these experiments entailed baking with moist heat with
the moisture derived not only from the USOs themselves but via added liquid water
added directly to the baking container or indirectly, via the moisture in the greenleaf packing materials.
The lab-oven experiments, termed “vapor,” were designed to more explicitly
assess our hypothesis about the role of water in a given USO in mobilizing
microfossils and of water vapor in transporting and depositing them. Accordingly,
the vapor experiment entailed baking with dry heat, insofar as water is not added
to what is present in the USO.
Case-Study Geophytes
Geophyte USOs store energy as various forms of carbohydrates, including:
(1) soluble sugar, primarily sucrose, a simple carbohydrate; (2) starch, a complex
and major plant-storage carbohydrate; (3) glucomanna, a poorly understood
nonstructural carbohydrate; and (4) fructan, especially inulin and inulin-like forms,
another complex and major plant-storage carbohydrate (Miller 1992; Smith et al.
2001). Some USOs contain primarily starch, others primarily inulin-like fructan,
and still other species store both starch and fructan or other complex carbohydrates
(Ranwala and Miller 2008; Smith et al. 2001). Different kinds of carbohydrates

Chapter 12

require different cooking times and methods, which likely accounts for much of the
diversity in earth-oven cookery. There are, however, patterns therein. Other things
being equal, inulin-rich plant foods require longer cooking time to maximize caloric
return than do starch-rich plant foods (Wandsnider 1997). Consistent with this
principal, ethnographic and archeological data illustrate that inulin-rich geophytes
were baked for two to three days in large earth ovens with rock heating elements
far more routinely than were starch-rich species (Boyd et al. 2004; Thoms 1989,
2008b, 2009a; Smith et al. 2001; Wandsnider 1997).
A preponderance of evidence derived from previous research tells us which
of numerous edible geophytes were or should have been sufficiently abundant to
have been important in the diets of the hunter-gatherers in south-central North
America (Boyd et al. 2004; Dering 2008; Thoms 2008a). From our analyses of fresh
geophyte USOs from this region, we also know which species are starch-rich and
which are inulin-rich (Thoms et al. 2011). For the electric oven baking experiments
reported here, we selected three starch-rich geophytes native to east-central
Texas: (1) false garlic (Nothoscordum bivalve) bulbs from sandy soil in the Post
Oak Savannah; (2) rain lily (Cooperia drummondii) bulbs from clayey soil on the
Edwards Plateau and silty soil along the interface between the Blackland Prairie
and Post Oak Savannah; and (3) winecup (Callirohoe involucrate) taproots from
sandy soil in the Post Oak Savannah (Figure 12.1). From a continental perspective,
these regions of Texas are part of the broad savannah ecotone that separates the
southeast woodlands, central plains, and southwest deserts.
Most ethnographic and ethnohistoric accounts attest to geophytes being
dug during the non- or minimal-growing season when bulbs, corms, tubers, and
roots tend to contain their maximum quantity of potentially digestible calories
and nutrients (Al-Tardeh et al. 2006; Miller 1992; Smith et al. 2001; Thoms 1989).
We dug geophytes for our experiments intermittently during the fall and winter,
from September 2009 into January 2013. During the fall, rain lily, false garlic, and
winecup typically retain distinctive green leaves and, in the case of false garlic and
rain lily, flower a few days after rainfall.
Winecup taproots and false garlic bulbs were dug the same day they were
baked in a conventional oven. Rain lily bulbs were dug several weeks earlier and
frozen until the day they were baked. The amount of time between collection and
freezing varied as much as three days, which probably resulted in differential
moisture loss. Variation in post-collection treatment may affect the results of
nutrient analyses, and potentially microfossil identification, because of microbe
contamination or because nutrients in the nonedible portion can migrate to the
edible portion during the freeze-thaw process (Kuhnlein 1986).
A study to evaluate results of different post-collection treatment techniques
(i.e., no treatment, packing in dry ice, covering with 95 percent ethanol, and air
drying) revealed no significant differences relative to analyses of total nonstructural
carbohydrates, including inulin-like fructan and starch. Although the effect of
variation in the amount of intervening time between collection and analyses was
not evaluated, that study’s results suggested that specimens could be transported

“considerable distances” without significant losses from enzyme activity or
respiration (Fick and Nolte 1986:43).
Some specimens analyzed for the electric-oven experiments were washed
to remove sediments prior to freezing; others were washed after being frozen. In
most cases, the outermost dried layers of the bulbs (i.e., tunic) were not removed
before freezing. It is likely that our varied post-collection/pre-baking treatments
differentially resulted in some microfossil contamination, especially from airborne
starch (Laurence et al. 2011) and perhaps from granules in sediments that adhered
to USOs. The extent to which variation in our collection times, post-collection
techniques, and pre-cooking preparations affected our analytical results remains
unclear, but it is unlikely to have significantly altered microfossil mobilization
patterns. The methods used to extract and analyze microfossils from fresh, baked,
and residue samples and minimize contamination are presented in Chapter 11.
Simple, Conventional-Oven Baking: Wet Geophytes Wrapped in
Cotton Cloth
For these experiments, we separately baked winecup taproots and false
garlic bulbs on September 27 and October 17, 2009. The USOs
were12.2
washed in tap
Figure
water prior to baking, and some
of the winecup taproots were
partially peeled prior to washing
(Figure 12.2). Each species
was wrapped in a moistened
cotton cloth and baked in an
open (i.e., uncovered) glass
bowl. A small amount of filtered
(5 µm screen) tap water was
added periodically to maintain
a consistently wet-to-moist
cooking environment. When the
water in the bowl evaporated,
which occurred numerous times
during a given baking episode,
filtered water was poured over
the cloth wrapping until 0.2–
0.5 cm covered the bottom of
the bowl and saturated the
wrapping. As such, portions of
the lowermost USOs in a given
bowl were immersed in water
much of the time.
Raw winecup taproots
and false garlic bulbs are white

hard in texture when squeezed between fingers, and slightly acrid in taste. These
USOs were taste-tested after baking eight hours at 135oC (ca. 275oF) and found to
be slightly sweet, with a distinctive molasses smell; they were brownish in color and
less firm in texture than raw USOs. They were returned to the oven and baked at
150oC (ca. 300oF) for an additional four hours. After baking a total of 12 hours, the
USOs were softer in texture, a bit sweeter, and browner in color. Judging from our
previous experience baking geophytes, these were adequately cooked, but it is likely
that a few more hours of baking would have rendered them sweeter, browner, and
softer. A brown, sweet-tasting caramelized residue covered parts of the wrapping
cloths and bowl bottoms (see Figure 12.2d).
Complex, Conventional-Oven Baking: Moist Geophytes
Packed in Oak and Grass Leaves
What makes this experiment “complex” is the replacement of the cotton-cloth
wrappings with green-leaf packing materials to better simulate earth-oven cookery.
This process was more realistic in that it introduced nonfood starch granules and
other microfossils to the baking residue. For these experiments, we separately baked
rain lily and false garlic bulbs and winecup taproots. Each set of geophyte USOs was
baked between layers of live oak leaves (Q. virginiana) with a few attached twigs
and green acorns, and/or bluestem grass (Schizachyrium scoparium) that included
leaves, stems, and a few seeds. We also used green leaves of winecup, false garlic,
and rain lily as part of the packing material in their respective bowls. Winecup
taproots and false garlic bulbs were dug, cleaned, and baked on the same day along
with rain lily bulbs that had been dug earlier in the fall and frozen.

Each species was baked
in a covered glass or glazedceramic bowl (Figure 12.3).
The contents of the bowls were
periodically moistened by an
addition of small amounts of
filtered tap water that partially
coated the packing material and
USOs but did not accumulate
more than a thin lens of water
on the bottom of the bowl, which
tended to evaporate within a few
minutes. These fresh, unfrozen,
and thawed USOs and the
leafy packing materials were
baked for 12 hours at 135 oC
(ca. 275oF). Most of the green
packing material dried out and
turned brownish in color but, in
each case, some of it remained
green and moist. The USOs were

e

Chapter 12

245

well baked, still moist, within the range of a baked potato, and light brown in color.
Bottoms, sides, and the lids of the cooking containers were stained brown with
slightly sticky, partially caramelized residue. Some of the packing material had what
appeared to be residue stains as well (see Figure 12.3b–d). With the exception of
rain lily, these baked geophytes were somewhat sweet and, overall, quite palatable.
Raw rain lily is extremely acrid in taste (i.e., inedible) and considered to be toxic
(Greathouse and Rigler 1941). Even the tiniest bite of baked rain lily bulb tasted
acrid, albeit with an initial hint of sweetness, to the point of being inedible and
perhaps still toxic.
Vapor, Laboratory-Oven Baking: Bare Geophytes
in Covered Beaker
These experiments are termed “vapor” because they were designed specifically
to assess whether USO microfossils are mobilized and deposited via airborne water
vapor during baking, with the only source of water being what was within a given
USO. Accordingly, a microscope slide was suspended by aluminum-foil strips inside
a covered glass beaker in a fashion that it was not in direct contact with either the
geophytes being baked or the sides of the vessel. We hypothesized, based on our
understanding of the baking process, that vaporized water emanating from the
USOs would carry microfossils into the air and that droplets would condense on
the suspended slide as well as on the sides and bottom of the beaker.
Figure 12.4
We conducted the vapor
experiment multiple times
with similar results reported
below (Figure 12.4). Each time,
winecup taproots were dug and
refrigerated for one to seven days
prior to baking in a lab oven. The
leaves and long rootlets were
removed and the taproots were
washed using filtered tap water
to remove adhering sediment.
The taproots were placed directly
on the bottom of a clean (i.e.,
rinsed in distilled water) glass
beaker and a microscope slide was
suspended above them to create
a condensation platform for the
water vapor. One beaker without
taproots but with a suspended slide
served as a control to test for the
presence of airborne microfossils
or other contamination. Taproots

ranging from ca. 160–220oC (360–430oF) for differing durations (0.25–2 hours) to
better understand the relationships between weight loss and baking time. Each
beaker was covered with clean aluminum foil while baking. During the baking
process, readily visible water droplets accumulated on the sides and lids of the
beaker as well as on the suspended slides.
ANALYTICAL methods and RESULTS
Prepared microscope slides were observed under polarized, cross-polarized,
one quarter-wavelength polarized, and bright field microscopy using Nikon Optishot
petrographic and Nikon Labophoto microscopes. Slides mounted in Permount are
curated at the Archaeological Ecology Laboratory, Department of Anthropology,
Texas A&M University. All of the micrographs of plant microfossils were taken at
400x magnification. Electronic copies of micrographs used herein are also curated
at the Archaeological Ecology Laboratory.
Analysis of baking residue revealed a diversity of plant-food microfossils,
including a variety of tissue fragments. Although plant tissues are not discussed in
this paper, their ubiquity and relatively good preservation in residue samples hint
at their potential as plant-food identifiers. This is especially the case for inulin-rich
plants with little or no starch, including camas, onions, and agave.
The microfossils from raw USOs are described and illustrated in the
discussion of the starch granule reference collection in Chapter 14.
Microfossils from Simple, Conventional-Oven Baking
Experiments
One day after being baked for 12 hours, microfossils were recovered from
USO samples and residues on the cloth packing material and from the sides and
bottom of the glass and ceramic bowls (Figure 12.5). Phytoliths were recovered
from all sampled materials (Figure 12.5, c, f, k, q, s–t, w, z, and cc). Most of the
nongelatinized starch granules recovered from the samples were damaged to the
point of being unidentifiable (Figure 12.5g–j, l–p, u–v, aa, and bb). Some, however,
were identifiable, insofar as they were intact or slightly modified granules with most
characteristics recognizable, thereby allowing for potential identification. Identifiable
granules were recovered from cooking residue accumulated on the packing material
and in the glass bowls used to bake false garlic and winecup. Identifiable, albeit
nondiagnostic, starch granules were recovered only from one baked false garlic bulb
(Figure 12.5j). By “nondiagnostic,” we mean identifiable starch granules that could
not be attributed to a specific family, genus, or species.
Microfossils from Complex Conventional-Oven Baking
Experiment
USOs, packing materials, and residues from the bottom and sides of the
containers used in these experiments were analyzed for microfossils one day after
they were baked. The undersides of lids used to cover the rain lily and winecup USOs
as well as the packing materials were also analyzed (Figures 12.6 and 12.7). Baked

winecup and rain lily USOs retained identifiable starch granules and phytoliths.
Identifiable microfossils were not recovered from three tested false garlic bulbs. All
the residue samples, from the green packing material, sides, bottoms, and lids of
the bowls, yielded starch granules and phytoliths.
Identifiable starch granules were recovered from the cooking residues of the
containers used to bake false garlic and winecup. Note, however, that the compound
granule in Figure 12.6hh could be from winecup, live oak, or little bluestem grass,
making it an identifiable but nondiagnostic granule, given that compound starch
granules occur in all three species. Raphides were recovered from residue in the

on green packing material as well as in the bowls and on lids of vessels used to
bake winecup and rain lily USOs (see Figures 12.7h–k, r–s, and x). Live oak starch
granules were recovered from the false garlic bowl residue (see Figures 12.7p–q).
Little bluestem phytoliths were recovered from all residue samples on the bottom
of the bowls, on packing materials therein, and the underside of lids (see Figure

varied with baking time and tuber size. Small winecup taproots (ca. 18.5 g) lost
38–47 percent of their raw weights after baking 30 minutes at 220oC; moderate
size taproots (ca. 64.5 g) lost 60–66 percent of their raw weight after baking two
hours at 180oC; large taproots (ca. 89 g) lost 11 and 32 percent of their respective
raw weights after baking at 160oC for 30 and 60 minutes, respectively. Identifiable,
but nondiagnostic, starch granules, phytoliths, and plant fibers were recovered
from suspended slides and beaker walls (Figure 12.8). Most starch granules were
substantially modified, but a few were identifiable (see Figure 12.8c and f). Insofar
as microfossils were not recovered from the empty control beaker, it is likely that
microfossils recovered from the beakers with USOs were from the winecup taproots,
as opposed to some form of contamination, airborne or otherwise.
Summary of Results
Identifiable USO starch granules were recovered from the residues in bowls
used to baked false garlic and winecup in both the simple and complex baking
experiments. Identifiable rain lily starch granules were recovered from the complex
experiment. Phytoliths were recovered in all residues and baked USOs in both sets of
conventional-oven experiments. Raphides were recovered from a baked rain lily bulb
and from its bowl residue. Starch granules and phytoliths from the little bluestem
grass and live oak packing material (leaves and/or acorns) were recovered from
residue on the packing material as well as from bowl and lid residues. Identifiable
starch granules and phytoliths from the winecup taproots were recovered from
suspended slides and beaker sides in the vapor experiment.
DISUSSION AND INTERPRETATION
Insofar as identifiable starch granules are emitted from USOs and preserved
in the caramelized baking residue on the inside of the baking vessels and on
suspended slides, they should also be preserved as part of the baking residue on
the inside of any given kitchen oven. To assess this contention, Laurence sampled
and analyzed baking residue adhering to the inside surface of the oven in his home.
A toothpick was used to scrape residue from the inside of the oven window. The
residue was processed and analyzed in the same fashion as for the geophyte-baking
experiments. Identifiable forms of domestic wheat (Triticum sp.) starch granules
were recovered from the residue (Figure 12.9). Although it was not evident when
these starch granules were deposited on the oven window, wheat-flour products had
not been baked in the oven for at least two weeks prior to sampling. At a minimum,
the recovered wheat starch granules underwent two baking events; the event
corresponding with their deposition on the window and an event where domestic
rice (Oryza sp.) and potato (Solanum sp.) products were baked in the oven two days
before the residue was sampled.
The primary finding from our geophyte-baking experiments is that starch
granules, phytoliths, raphides, and plant tissue embedded in raw USOs are
mobilized and emitted during short-term and prolonged baking. Each of our electric
oven baking experiments yielded some combination of identifiable plant-food
microfossils on cloth wrappings or leafy packing material and in the bowl residue

Figure 12.10

(Figure 12.10). Accordingly,
we conclude that it is indeed
reasonable to expect to find
plant-food microfossils in ancient
earth ovens, given adequate
preservation conditions. Results
of these experiments support
our hypothesis that upon
baking water within raw USOs
plays a key role in mobilizing
and depositing embedded
microfossils. Our findings are
also consistent with the recovery
of taxonomically identifiable
starch granules and raphides
from geophytes baked in other
experimental ovens and from
those subjected to boiling (e.g.,
Henry et al. 2009; Messiner and
Schindler 2010).

Recovery of identifiable
microfossils from residue
deposited on the bottoms,
sides, and lids of the baking
containers and on suspended
slides therein indicates that
microfossils were mobilized in
liquid and vapor forms of water.
The primary contention in this
chapter—water is a medium
for microfossil mobilization—is
significant, given that water
is a major component of most
raw geophytes (Yanovsky and
Kingsbury 1938). Much of that

and Robson 1972; Kumar and
Aalbersberg 2006; Thoms
1989:158–159; Wandsnider 1997). We can now conclude that various microfossils
also are lost during the baking process.
Our experiments suggest that during baking, heat-driven expansion of water
within a USO results in microfossils being vented, via hot vapor and steam, from

Chapter 12

the confines of that USO. As per this working model, initial pathways for external
dispersion of contained water (i.e., dehydration) may be the respiration-related
passages naturally present within USOs (Al-Tardeh et al. 2008; Dhyani et al. 2009;
Van der Toorn et al. 2000). As baking continues, USO temperature increases and
water in the cells begins to vaporize. Internal air pressure should increase as well,
thereby providing energy to expand respiration pathways and, importantly, rupture
cell walls that encompass microfossils. Such hypothetical expansion cracks and
openings would serve as mobilization pathways for escaping liquid and vapor forms
of water, along with a diversity of inter- and intra-cell microfossils. These processes
probably are analogous to what happens when a potato “whistles,” as today’s cooks
sometime report hearing when this tuber is cooked (cf. internet search on “whistling
potato”). A more generic analogy is witnessed commonly by campfire gazers who
see and hear small needle-shaped jets of blue fire as water vapor and hot air vent
from burning green or wet wood.
As hypothesized here, USO microfossils are among the particles upon which
water vapor droplets form (i.e., precipitate) during evaporation. With condensation
of the water vapor on the packing material or on the sides, bottoms, and lids of
the containers, and subsequent evaporation, microfossils remain as part of the
baking residue. High-speed, high-resolution photography would be useful in further
assessment of this model.
Archeological Implications
Recovery of plant-food microfossils from baking residue on leafy packing
material, the inside of containers, and on suspended slides suggests that substantial
quantities of plant-food microfossils should be deposited on the voluminous packing
material typically used when tens to hundreds of kgs of USOs are baked in an
earth oven. Our experimental results are consistent with our working hypothesis;
they inform us that it is indeed reasonable to expect to find identifiable plant-food
microfossils in the remains of ancient earth ovens. These results are sufficient to
generate a follow-up hypothesis about post-baking translocation of plant microfossils
during transition of an earth oven from its systemic context to the archeological
record:
With the passage of time, emitted plant-food microfossils, originally
deposited on leafy packing material during baking, should be
remobilized and moved down the profile by the percolation of
rainwater or meltwater (i.e., soil illuviation).
In this testable scenario, oven-mobilized, plant-food microfossils are
remobilized along with other soil organic matter and cutans in general (Brewer
1960), via subsurface percolation, leaching, and evaporation. Subsequently, they
are redeposited on underlying cooking stones and in the encasing sediment, along
with residue from packing materials and other clay- and silt-size illuvium particles
(e.g., soil carbonates, organic matter, and other cutans). Some of the redeposited
microfossils that come to rest on and around once-hot cooking stones should be
protected from natural degradation, via soil microorganisms and enzymes, by the

253

254

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

rocks (i.e., artifacts) themselves, and perhaps by derived heavy minerals, including
iron, and concentrations of clay-sized sediment, carbon, or calcium carbonate (cf.
Haslam 2004, 2009).
Assuming adequate survival rates, it should be possible to track plant-food
microfossils in earth-oven cookery by following groundwater pathways through
a given feature. Therin (1998) and Therin et al. (1999) recognized the possibility
of microfossil translocation via groundwater but concluded that percolation’s role
in determining starch content in a given layer of soil was minor in comparison
to microbial degradation of starch. Subsequent experimental work, however,
indicated that downward, upward, and lateral movement of starch granules may
be a significant taphonomic factor (Haslam 2009a). Micromorphological analysis
(Goldberg and Macphail 2003) directed toward tracking microfossils within
actualistic and archeological intra-oven sediment profiles may further elucidate
these hypothetical microfossil pathways.
Summary and Conclusions
Analysis of the cotton-cloth wrappings and bowl residue from the simple
conventional-oven baking experiments demonstrated that intact/identifiable,
gelatinized, and unidentifiable starch granules and other plant microfossils were
emitted from geophyte USOs while partially immersed in liquid water. In this case,
liquid water was a likely medium for the migration of microfossils through the cotton
cloth and onto the bowl where they were incorporated into the brownish, partially
caramelized cooking residue. This finding supports the contention that stone-boiling
rocks and clay nodules are also plant-food microfossil refuges (Cummings 2006; Perry
2010; Simms et al. 2013). Mobilization of microfossils in water vapor, as opposed
to being immersed in liquid water, is indicated by the presence of identifiable
starch granules and other microfossils found on suspended slides in the lab-oven
experiment, on the underside of cooking container lids, and on the upper layer of
leafy packing material in the complex conventional-oven experiments.
These results suggest that plant foods need not be in direct contact with
cooking stones for embedded microfossils to be deposited or redeposited on heatingelement rocks in earth ovens. Our findings also demonstrate that gelatinization of
starch granules in wild geophyte USOs sometimes remains incomplete after shortterm and prolonged baking, a finding consistent with other studies (e.g., Crowther
et al. 2003; Henry et al. 2009; Messiner and Schindler 2010). Said differently, a
portion of emitted starch granules may remain sufficiently intact for identification
within a given USO as well as in residue generated while baking for 12 hours at
temperatures of 135–150oC (ca. 275–300oF).
Recovery of little bluestem grass and live oak starch granules from our
complex baking experiments indicates that packing-material microfossils are also
emitted during prolonged baking. Here, too, mobilization and deposition via liquid
and vapor forms of water seems likely. Accordingly, nonfood microfossils should also
be deposited on earth-oven heating elements and in the encompassing sediments. As
such, the nature and distribution of plant microfossils in ancient earth ovens is likely

Chapter 12

to be analytically “noisy,” thereby complicating reliable extraction and identification
of plant-food microfossils. For example, leaves and stems of many edible plant foods
may also be used as packing material, including those of berries, fruits, nuts, seeds,
desert succulents (e.g., agave, prickly pear, yucca), and geophytes (e.g., false garlic,
winecup, camas, onions). We conclude, nonetheless, that it is scientifically reasonable
to expect to find USO microfossils in the remains of ancient earth ovens in which
those foods were baked.

CHAPTER 13:
Actualistic Experiments: Building
Earth Ovens and Other Cookstone
Facilities

Alston V. Thoms, Andrew R. Laurence, Laura M. Short, and Masahiro Kamiya

This chapter describes a series of experiments conducted between 2009 and
2013 in which researchers constructed earth ovens and other cookstone facilities to
cook a variety of different foods. As noted in Chapter 9, our actualistic oven-building
experiments in 2009 and 2010 were conducted in collaboration with representatives
of Native American tribes and groups whose presence was sponsored by the Fort
Hood CRM program as part of their consultation efforts. To document the distribution
of microfossils emitted from geophyte USOs and packing materials after a baking
episode, a large unlined earth oven that resembled archaeological examples typical
of those found at Fort Hood was built and fired. Subsequently, six other similar
earth ovens were built and fired, experimentally cooking a range of foods to better
understand and document various aspects of the baking process and track internal
movement of food residues and plant microfossils.
Ethnohistoric accounts and ethnographic research attests to substantial
variation in earth oven construction and use (Black and Creel 1997; Crowther
et al. 2003; Driver and Massey 1957; Ellis 1997; Kumar and Aalbersberg 2006; Loy
1994b; Messner and Schindler 2010; Peacock 2008; Smith et al. 2001; Stark 2002;
Thoms 1989:179–220, 223–227, 264–270; 1998, 2003, 2008a, 2008b; Wandsnider
1997). Variation in the form and function of earth ovens is also reflected in the
archeological record (Black and Thoms 2014; Boyd et al. 2004; Thoms 1989, 2009a)
but it remains surprisingly understudied. Size differences are widespread, with
smaller features (<1 m diameter) sometimes equated to family cooking facilities and,
other things being equal, much larger ones (>2 m diameter) considered indicative of
bulk-processing or feasting (Hayden and Cousin 2004; Thoms and Clabaugh 2011).
Earth oven baking times range from a few hours, as with family-size taro and arum
ovens in the South Pacific and southeastern North America, respectively (Bradbury
et al. 1988; Kumar and Aalbersberg 2006; Messner and Schindler 2010), to threeday agave ovens in southwest North America (Stark 2002).
There is also considerable variation in placement of the rock heating element
in earth ovens used to bake geophyte USOs, as shown by the following examples.
Captain John Smith (Barbour 1986; Smith 1608) described a small earth oven used
by mid-Atlantic Algonquian groups in the early 1600s. Its rock heating element was
placed atop the earth mound, and the underlying food—Areceae (arum)—was packed

257

258

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

between layers of green vegetation (Messner and Schindler 2010). Polynesians
often placed food packets—taro and yams—near the bottom of the oven, between
layers of green leaves, added the hot-rock heating element, and capped it with an
earthen lid (Carson 2002; Messner and Schindler 2010). In 1683, La Salle described
a large earth used by Algonquian speakers near that mouth of the Ohio River.
That oven was layered from bottom to top as follows: (1) fired-in-place rock heating
element; (2) layer of green packing materials; (3) layer of unidentified egg-size
USOs dug from wetlands; (3) layer of green packing material; (4) upper hot-rock
heating element; (5) layer of green packing material: (6) layer USOs; (7) layer of
green packing material; and (8) earthen cap. Lewis and Clark in 1806 provided a
detailed description of a large camas (Camassia quamash) oven with a single firedin-place rock-heating element built by the Nez Perce people. The food packets were
sandwiched between layers of grass placed over the heated stones and burning coals;
water was poured over the grass and camas packets prior to sealing the oven with
an earthen cap (Thwaites 1959:127–131). Rock heating elements in earth ovens,
including some of those used by the Mescalero Apache, were occasionally underlain
by a layer of rocks that lined the bottom and sides of a basin-shaped pit in which
the fire was kindled to heat the heating-element rocks per se (Stark 2002).
Within given groups, earth oven technology was complex and diverse, as
illustrated by the Kootenai and Kalispel tribes in northwest North America (Smith
1984, 2000; Thoms 2008b). Table 13.1 provides summary descriptions of plant-food
earth ovens historically used by the Kalispel people, a hunter-gatherer group in
the northern Rocky Mountains of northeast Washington. These descriptions are
extracted from information compiled by Allen H. Smith during his 1936–1937
ethnographic fieldwork among the Kalispel and published later in conjunction with
a large-scale archeological project near the Kalispel Reservation (Smith 1984, 2000).
The Kalispel used a variety of large bulk-baking and smaller family-baking ovens to
cook at least seven geophytes, including camas, which was cooked in several types
of earth ovens, often mixed with tree lichen (Alectoria fremonti).
Kalispel women also cooked meat and eggs between layers of green vegetation
packing materials in other kinds of earth ovens, as listed in Table 13.1. Various kinds
of eggs were steam-cooked in a fireless oven as follows: (1) rocks were heated in a
surface hearth; (2) they were then transferred to the bottom of a nearby small oven
pit; (3) the hot rocks were covered with a layer of green grass; (4) eggs were placed
on this packing material; (5) another layer of green-grass packing material was
added: (6) the oven was capped with an earthen lid; and (7) a stick, placed vertically
in the hot rocks as the oven layers were added, was then withdrawn and water
was poured through the hole to create the steam. A similar process, but without an
earthen oven lid, was used to “roast” various meats for immediate consumption or
as an initial stage in the drying process. In this case, meat-draped evergreen boughs
covered the hot rocks and were in turn covered by branches or grass while the meat
cooked (Smith 2000:7.14–7.19).

Basic Construction and Cooking Techniques for the Facility**
For camas [other foods probably cooked in smaller ovens], a
round (ca. 2.4–3.1 m dia., 0.15 m deep) or elliptical pit (ca. 2.1
x 1.5 x 0.15 m) is dug and sometimes lined with rocks (ca. 0.17
m dia); a large quantity of firewood (sticks and some logs 0.15
m dia.) is added and then another layer of rocks; the wood pile
is fired, burns down, and the heated rocks are spread across
the bottom of the pit; green boughs, grass, or skunk cabbage
leaves are used to cover the hot rocks and coals; camas bulbs
are added (in woven sacks or baskets, but containers sometimes
not used when black tree lichen is cooked with camas or onions),
then covered with green plant material and finally with earth;
sometimes a fire is built on top of the low mound and quickly
covered with sod to keep the wood from burning too fast and
to hold in the heat (an upper fire was not used when black tree
lichen was included with camas or onions); the bulbs cook for 48
hours before the oven is opened.
A shallow pit is dug, similar in shape but smaller than that
used for camas; a few hot rocks, heated in a nearby fire, are put
in the pit and covered with green boughs on which are placed
large pieces of meat that are then covered with additional
green boughs or grass and allowed to cook for ca. 30 minutes,
in preparation for subsequent drying or stone boiling if
consumption is imminent; for cooking meat ca. 20 minutes for
immediate consumption, several hot, flat rocks are placed in
the bottom of the pit and covered with green boughs on which is
placed meat cut into strips, then covered with a layer of green
branches, and weighted down with unheated rocks.
A large rock is heated in place, presumably by a fire built on
the surface, and, after the fire burns down [presumably the
remaining coals are scraped away to avoid burning the green
boughs covering the rock], it is covered by green branches upon
which is placed the half-roasted meat that is then covered with
green boughs held in place by a few cold rocks; the meat is
cooked for about 30 minutes.
Hot rocks, sometime only one large flat rock, are heated in
nearby fire and placed in a shallow pit [presumably basin
shaped, ca. 0.75 m in diameter and 0.3 m deep] and covered with
green twigs or grass; food is added and covered with a layer of
green grass; a stick is placed upright in the pit and the whole is
covered with earth; the stick is then removed and a little water
is added through the resulting hole, which is then covered, and
the food allowed to cook.
A bucket-shaped [near-vertical sidewalls] pit is dug, ca. 0.3 m
in diameter and 0.1–0.3 m deep, and lined with inner bark from
an evergreen tree, or sometimes a deer paunch and rarely an
untanned hide; water is added until the container-lined pit is
about half full and then the food, which is cut in small pieces;
hot rocks “of any kind,” up to four or five at a time, are carried
to the pit with stick tongs and placed in water; as the rocks
cool, they are replaced by hot ones as needed; most foods cooked
within 15 to 30 minutes.
The same general cooking techniques are employed, but boiling
is done in woven baskets, as well as wooden vessels (Smith
1984). [No mention is made of boiling in suspended containers
made of hide, as is reported for many Plains Indian groups.]

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

Research methods and Objectives
As discussed in Chapter 12, our electric oven experiments demonstrated that
identifiable plant-food and packing-material microfossils were emitted from USOs
during the baking process and subsequently deposited, along with other residues, on
leafy packing material, on container sides and lids, and on glass slides suspended in
the air. Those results suggest that substantial quantities of microfossils should be
deposited on the voluminous packing material and heating-element rocks typically
used when hundreds of kilograms of USOs are baked in a large earth oven. The
earth oven experiments described in this chapter were designed to test the working
model presented in Chapter 10:
Identifiable starch granules and other microfossils are exuded,
dispersed, and deposited on packing materials and cook stones in
earth ovens during and in the aftermath of a given baking episode.
The first experiment involved construction and firing of a large, unlined earth
oven with a fired-in-situ limestone rock heating element used to bake geophytes for
42 hours. This oven was specifically designed to resemble the earth ovens typically
found at a variety of prehistoric sites on the Fort Hood military reservation.
Subsequent experiments were designed to replicate other types of ethnographically
documented earth ovens, and these consisted of: (a) two large earth ovens with firedin-situ rock heating elements to bake a variety of geophytes for 20 and 42 hours
using different techniques; (b) one large fired-in-situ rockless earth oven, with hot
coals as the only heating source, to bake geophytes for 20 hours; (c) two small earth
ovens with fired-in-situ rock heating elements, one slab-lined and the other unlined,
to bake meat and geophytes for 2 to 2.5 hours; and (d) three small fireless ovens in
which the rocks were heated elsewhere and transferred to the oven, to bake meat
and geophytes for 1.75 to 4 hours. In addition, we stone-boiled nuts and geophytes
and grilled rabbit on fired-in-situ rocks as well as directly on hot coals in open
hearths. Sketches of these basic hot-rock cooking methods are presented in Figure
13.1. Table 13.2 summarizes information about the size and components used in
the various experimental hot-rock cooking facilities and their respective outcomes.
The research objectives for these actualistic experiments include: (1) to better
understand the baking process per se by compiling temperature ranges and cooking
times for the different sizes and types of earth ovens using an electronic data logger
and multiple thermocouples (Figure 13.2); (2) to facilitate future studies, including
microscopic, molecular, and thermodynamic analyses by collecting samples of
cooking stones and packing materials used in the various experiments; (3) to provide
baseline information on feature formation processes to support interpretations
of archeological FCR features; and (4) to photodocument the experimental earth
ovens, from initial construction to final aftermath, as an aid to other researchers
conducting earth oven and hot-rock cookery experiments.
As noted in Chapter 10, we began our actualistic experiments in November
2009 as part of public demonstrations billed as the Hot Rocks Cook Off at Veterans
Park in College Station, Texas, for Archaeological Awareness Month. In October
2010, we carried out a similar set of experiments in association with Native

American Awareness Month. We followed up in 2011–2013 with small-oven and
other hot-rock cooking experiments. One of those was done in conjunction with the
2013 Sacred Springs Powwow, held in October during Native American Heritage
Month. Representatives of the Comanche Nation and various Coahuiltecan groups
visited with us as we built and used an earth oven to bake gophers and rabbit. The
remaining experiments were conducted at events near San Antonio and Bryan, Texas.

In the following sections, we describe and illustrate the construction, use, and
aftermath of basic types of hot-rock cookery and, when available, present thermal
data. The chapter concludes with a brief discussion of pertinent findings and how
they pertain to finding and identifying diagnostic microfossils in the remains of
ancient earth ovens.
Large, Communal-Size Earth Ovens with Rock
Heating Elements
We built and used three large earth ovens with fired-in-situ rock heating
elements in 2009 and 2010. Temperature ranges and durations were monitored
for each one via thermocouples and a data logger; samples of used cooking stones
and packing material from these ovens were collected and curated. Descriptions of

Chapter 13

actualistic experiments begin with #1-09, the only earth oven to undergo microfossil
analysis for the present study. It was used to bake wild, inulin-rich geophytes—
onion and camas bulbs—and domestic Russet potatoes for 42 hours. As per our
investigations, camas and onion bulbs contain little, if any, starch; the few granules
that may be present are nondiagnostic as to species or family. The potatoes were
added as a microfossil-mobilization control. Given that starch granules from this
domestic species are well known and are morphologically diagnostic granules, we
reasoned that we should be able to identify and track them for comparative purposes
in an earth-oven context and thereby know whether microfossils were mobilized.
Inulin-Rich Oven, #1-09: A Baking Failure and Microfossil
Identification Success
The limestone heating-element in this large, unlined earth oven weighed
about 385 kg and was fired with an estimated 270 kg of dry oak and elm, all of which
was collected from a deadfall (Figure 13.3). When we dug the oven pit (ca. 1.75 m
diameter x 30 cm deep), the sediment—very fine silty sand—was dry and hard. The
oven was loaded with ca. 20 kg of camas and wild onions along with several pounds
of starch-rich domestic (Russet/white) potatoes. Each geophyte type was packed in
a separate well-washed cotton bag and placed between layers of green oak leaves,
cactus pads, grass and sotol leaves that weighed about 30 kg in total. Consistent
with some of the ethnohistoric/ethnographic accounts of camas and other USOs that
were baked for two days, we kindled a small fire atop the closed oven mound and
kept it burning for several hours. The geophytes baked for 42 hours and attained
temperatures ranging from ca. 50° to 250°C.
Based on seeing the lower level of packing material burst into flames before
we could add the food packets, our initial concern was that the USOs might overbake.
As it turned out, building the fire atop the mound ensured that our expectation would
be realized. In opening the oven, which still had a few glowing and sizzling-hot rocks
after 40 hours, we saw that most of the packing material and many of the cloth
bags were charred, as was the case for all of the camas and wild onions bulbs and
for most of the potatoes. A few potatoes, however, were quite edible, having become
brown in color and sweet in taste, albeit it rather mushy in texture.
Thermal Analysis
Analysis of thermograph data from thermocouples—one in a heating-element
rock, one in an onion, and one in the lower portion of the earthen oven cap/lid—
reveals details about how the food burned (Figure 13.4). The oven was heated by
hot rocks and coals within it and by the wood fire atop it. For the first several hours,
the heating-element temperature dropped dramatically as the food and oven-lid
temperature increased equally dramatically. Oven-lid temperatures remained above
100°C for about 16 hours, accompanied by a 3-hour-long rise in the temperature
of the heating-element rocks and food temperature, exceeding 100°C. Soon after
the oven lid temperature dropped below 100°C, the heating-element increased
substantially in temperature as did the food and packing material, which probably

charred when their temperatures exceeded 200°C for five hours before “cooling,”
some 18 hours later, to about 125°C.
Initial combustion of the USOs and packing material may have caused the
marked increase in rock temperature, which peaked just before the food temperature.
All of the moisture in the geophytes and packing material probably vaporized

gradually over 16 hours when temperatures were 100°+C . The USOs and packing
material likely charred over the ensuing five hours when the heating element
temperature increased from ca. 375° to 480°C.
As long as the food remained hotter than the oven lid, the direction of
heat flow was Heating-ElementàFoodàOven-LidàAtmosphere, such that much
of oven’s heat energy was released to the atmosphere, which likely slowed the
vaporization rate inside the oven. When the oven-lid temperature exceeded the
temperature of the USOs, the direction of heat flow changed significantly to HeatingElementàFoodßOven-Lid, thereby enhancing the vaporization rate and subsequent
charring of the food. Had we added water to the oven sometime within several
hours after closing the oven, a practice reported in some ethnographic accounts, the
geophytes may not have burned although they may well have overbaked.
Microfossil Analysis
Cookstone samples from the heating element of this oven were collected two
days after the oven was opened; they were sampled and analyzed for microfossils
following methods described in Chapter 11. Most of the recovered starch granules

267

268

were heavily modified but a few were still identifiable, including domestic Russet/
white potato (Solanum tuberosum) and little bluestem grass (Schizachyrium
scoparium); other microfossils were recovered as well from residue deposited on
cooking stones during and probably after the 42-hour overbaking episode (Figure
13.5).

Most of the recovered
identifiable starch originated
from the plants that were

It remains unclear whether

resulted from airborne or direct- transfer
contamination. Interestingly, common bean

were recovered from air samples, offsite rock
samples, and feature FCR at archeological sites
(see Chapter 14; Laurence et al. 2011).
Starch-Rich Oven, #2-09: A Baking
Success
The sandstone heating element in this
large (ca. 1.75 m), unlined earth oven (#2-09)
also weighed about 385 kg. It was fired in situ
with an estimated 270 kg of dry oak and elm,
all of which was collected as deadfall (Figure

and greenbrier root nodes, along with domestic
white onions packed in separate, well-washed
cotton bags placed and placed between layers of green oak leaves, cactus pads,
grass, and sotol leaves that weighed about 30 kg in total. The geophytes baked for
20 hours and attained temperatures that ranged from ca. 50° to 120°C, hovering
between 70° and 90°C for most of the baking episode. Upon opening the oven, the
baked geophytes were quite warm, ca. 65°C, moist, and still surrounded by packing

Chapter 13

material ranging from dehydrated but still green in color to charred black. Most of
the geophytes were well baked and quite tasty. The false garlic, winecup, and onions
were brown in color, soft in texture, and slightly sweet. The greenbrier roots had
also changed from whitish to brownish in color, but they were comparatively dry
and relatively tasteless, albeit reminesecent of powered food starch.

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

Thermal Analysis
Analysis of thermograph data from thermocouples—one in a heating-element
rock, one in an onion, and one in the base of the earthen oven lid—reveals details of
how and why this event yielded well-baked geophytes (Figure 13.8). This oven was
heated by hot rocks and coals comprising the heating element, which obtained a
maximum temperature of 550°C when the open fire was burning. The temperature
dropped to 300°C when the oven was closed, then fell to about 100°C over the next
10 hours, and was only 60°C when the oven was opened. The oven-lid temperature
remained stable at about 50°C throughout the baking episode. After the heatingelement temperature declined to about 100°C, the food temperature also declined
gradually, never having been much above the boiling point for more than a few
minutes.

Figure 13.8. Temperature graph of oven #2-09 with starchy root food over 20 hours. Oven closed at roughly
hour 2.

Because the heating element was always hotter than the food and the
food was always hotter than the oven-lid, the direction of heat flow remained:
Heating-ElementàFoodàOven-LidàAtmosphere. Because the food temperature
was almost always below 100°C, moisture remained within the food and in the
surrounding packing material throughout the baking episode. As long as the USOs

Chapter 13

contain liquid water, enthalpy of vaporization takes heat energy, thus the rate of
temperature increase in the food itself remains slower than when all liquid water
is vaporized. Said differently, the USOs did not become hotter than 100°C overall
because the moisture in the food and packing material continued to absorb heat
energy to vaporize, thus the heat energy was not used to raise the food temperature
to a burning point.
Inulin-Rich Oven, #3-10: A Baking Success
For this oven, we reopened the pit used for oven #1-09, collected some of the
used cookstones and charred USOs for future analysis, discarded the remainder,
and piled up the carbon-stained and charcoal-rich fill to be used as the earthen cap
for the new oven (Figure 13.9). The comparatively unconsolidated soil was easier to
dig than previously but equally dry in the absence of rainfall for several weeks. We
used a sandstone heating element in this large (ca. 1.75 m diameter), unlined earth
oven that weighed about 385 kg and was fired in situ with an estimated 270 kg of
dry oak and elm, much of which was saw-cut. The oven was loaded with ca. 55 kg
camas bulbs and domestic white onions. They were packed in separate, well-washed
cotton bags and placed between layers of cactus pads and wet green oak leaves and
wet grass that weighed about 30 kg in total.
This time around, in accordance with some ethnohistoric/ethnographic
accounts of baking camas and other USO for two days, we added about 12 liters
of water through a hole temporarily left in the oven lid. This batch of geophytes
baked for 42 hours. Compared to the previous 42-hour baking experiment in which
the camas and many of the potatoes charred, the USOs in this baking episode did
not burn. The camas bulbs were brown in color and somewhat sweet, albeit still
underbaked; the onions, on the whole, were baked to perfection. They were brownish
in color, notably sweet, and retained much of their structure. The food sacks were
unburned, stained brown and moist, and warm to the touch. Packing material was
thoroughly dehydrated; much of it was charred but some retained a green color,
perhaps as result of adding water to the closed oven, which probably served to
increase the rate of temperature decline and thereby prevent charring.
Thermal Analysis
Thermocouples were placed in a heating-element rock, in a cactus pad
overlying the heating element, and in an onion near the oven’s center. The
temperature of the heating-element rock was not measured, however, because
the wire leading to the embedded thermocouple melted. As such the cactus pad
temperature affords the best estimate of the higher-range of temperature inside the
oven. The two brief temperature reversals during the first three hours, as indicated
by the pad that overlay the heating element, probably resulted from adding the
water soon after the oven was closed (Figure 13.10). Following the second reversal,
the cactus pad temperature decreased steadily from about 325° to 95°C when the
oven was opened. Due to a setting error, the food temperature was not recorded until
about six hours after the oven was closed, during which time the food temperature
may have reached 100°C. After the error was corrected, food temperature gradually

declined over 36 hours from 92° to 57°C. The flow of heat energy in this successful
baking episode was Heating-ElementàFoodàOven-LidàAtmosphere.
The soft, moist texture of the baked USOs attested to the presence of liquid
water and illustrated that their temperature remained below 100°C throughout the
baking episode. In other words, a continuous presence of water in the USOs prevented
them from burning. Oven temperatures, as measured by the thermocouple in the
underlying cactus pad, were certainly hot enough (ca. 200°+ C) for long enough (ca.
12 hrs.) to char the USOs had they not remained moist. The oven’s heat energy,
however, was sufficient to char much of the packing material, which was quick to
lose a greater proportion of its moisture, probably because of its comparatively
greater surface area per unit weight.
A Large, Communal-Size Rockless Earth Oven
We built and used one large earth oven that was fired only by in-place
combustion of wood fuel. This baking technique is well documented in ethnographic

records (e.g., Ellis 1997; Thoms 1989; Wandsnider 1997). As with the other large
ovens, temperature range/duration was monitored via thermocouples; samples of
packing material were curated.
Starch-Rich Oven, #4-10: A Baking Success
For this oven, we reopened the pit used for Oven #2-09, collected some of
the used cookstones for future analysis, discarded the remainder, and piled up the
carbon-stained and charcoal-rich fill to be used as the earthen cap for the new oven
(Figure 13.11). The oven-fill and surrounding sediment were dry in the absence
of rainfall for several weeks. We fired this unlined earth oven with an estimated
270 kg of dry oak and elm, including deadfall and saw-cut fuel. It was loaded with
ca. 45 kg of domestic Irish (i.e., white) potatoes packed in well-washed cotton bags
and placed between layers of cactus pads and wet green oak leaves and grass that
weighed about 30 kg in total. This batch of geophytes baked for 20 hours. When the
oven was opened, the cloth sacks were moist and warm. The encompassing packing
material was dehydrated to varying degrees; some of it was still greenish in color;
none of the upper layer packing material was charred. Most of the potatoes were
well baked; some were underbaked. It is unclear why some of the potatoes were
underbaked after 20 hours above a heating element that always exceeded 125°C,
well above the boiling point of water. The amount of food may have been too much or
too thickly packed for the coals to heat or perhaps there was too much moist green
packing material relative to the amount of coals.

Thermal Analysis
Thermocouples were placed in the coals, in one of the potatoes within a
cotton sack, and in the layer of packing material above the food. The still-burning
coals cooled substantially, from about 75° to 130°C, within 15 minutes after the
oven was closed (Figure 13.12). Within an hour or so, the temperature increased
to about 150°C and then it declined over three hours to about 125°C after which
the coals began a slow increase to about 175°C when the oven was opened. Packing
material above the potatoes and the potatoes themselves did not exceed 90°C during
the 20-hour baking episode, and when the open was opened, their temperatures
were about 60°C and 70°C respectively. The flow of heat energy in this successful
rockless baking episode was CoalsàFoodàOven-LidàAtmosphere. Judging from
the thermograph, the packing material temperature increased rapidly when the
oven was closed, followed by a minor increase in the temperature of the coals, which
may have resulted when some of the lower-level packing material combusted. A few

minutes later, the potato temperature began its initial temperature increase, and
within two hours of closure, it surpassed the packing material temperature by a
few degrees.
Small, Family-Size Earth Ovens with Rock
Heating Elements
We built and used two small earth ovens with fired-in-situ rock heating
elements in 2011 and 2012. Temperature ranges and durations were monitored for
one of these ovens. Samples of used packing material and/or cooking stones from
both ovens were curated.
Meat and Geophyte Unlined Oven, #5-11: A Baking Success
This small oven (ca. 0.9 m diameter x 25 cm deep) was built in May 2011
in Bexar County as part of a public event, Native San Antonio, held at the Land
Heritage Institute, a few miles south of San Antonio. We reopened a pit used in
2010 to build a similar oven, collected some of the used cookstones (sandstone) for
future analysis, reused some of the remaining rocks larger than about 15 cm in cross
section, and piled up the carbon-stained and charcoal-rich fill to be used as the lid
for the new oven (Figure 13.13). We fired this unlined earth oven with ca. 40 kg of
dry oak and mesquite, including deadfall and saw-cut fuel to heat about 35 kg of
used and fresh sandstone. It was loaded with a beef roast, domestic potatoes, carrots

275

and onions, totaling about 10 kg. The food was packed in a well-washed cotton bag
and placed between layers of cactusFigure
pads and
13.13wet green mesquite leaves (ca. 10 kg).

dehydrated but much of it was still green and quite moist. None of the upper layer
was charred and only lower most of the packing material beneath the food was
charred. All of the geophytes were well baked (i.e., soft but retaining a firm texture).
The meat was very moist and medium rare.
Thermal Analysis
Thermocouples were placed on top of the heating element, in the lower
layer of packing material, in one of the potatoes, in the roast, and in the upper
layer of packing material. The heating-element temperature at oven closure was

ca. 675°C and steadily dropped to about 325°C when the oven was opened (Figure
13.14). Within about 15 minutes after the oven was closed, the packing material
and food reached and held temperatures between 100° and 75°C, with the upper
layer of packing material and the meat being the hottest and coolest, respectively.
The order in which the component temperatures underwent the rapid rise from
ambient temperature was as follows: (1) heating element; (2) lower packing material:
(3) upper packing material; (4) potato; and (5) meat. In general, the flow of heat
energy in this small oven was Heating ElementàFoodàOven-LidàAtmosphere, as
is characteristic of successful baking episodes.
Meat and Geophyte, Slab-Lined Oven, #6-12: A Baking Success
This small oven (ca. 1 m diameter x 25 cm deep) was built in February 2012
in rural Brazos County, a few miles northeast of Bryan at a time when the gravelly
sandy soil was moist from recent rains. Members of the Experimental Archaeology
Club at Texas A&M University built and fired this oven (Figure 13.15). Given the
occurrence of slab-lined earth ovens throughout and well beyond central Texas,

278

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

our suspicion is that slab linings are effective in separating wet sediment from the
heating element, be it composed of hot rocks and coals or coals only. We lined the
bottom of our oven pit with sandstone slabs, added the fuel and heating-element
rocks, and kindled the fire, which burned to hot coals and heated the rocks red-hot
within an hour. We fired this lined earth oven with an estimated 40 kg of dry oak
branches and saw-cut wood and heated 35 kg of fresh sandstone for the heating
element. We baked a beef roast, domestic potatoes, carrots, and onions, totaling
about 10 kg. The food packet was wrapped in well-washed cotton cloth and placed
between layers of wet green grass weighing about 10 kg in total and baked for 2.5
hours. All of the geophytes were well baked (i.e., soft but retaining a firm texture).
The meat was very moist and medium done. The unburned cloth wrapping was wet
with light brown stains; most of the grass packing material was moist and still green.
To document post-baking weathering processes, we periodically photographed
the open oven pit over a 22-month period (Figure 13.16). After one month, charcoal
and cookstones in the middle of the oven were readily visible, as were dry-grass
remnants of the upper layer of packing material. Insects had burrowed along the oven
edges. After five months, most of the packing material had disintegrated, vegetation
was encroaching, some charcoal was visible, and natural infilling was underway. A
year and 10 months after the baking episode, green grass and herbaceous vegetation
covered the oven pit. After cutting the vegetation covering the oven, heating-element
rocks were clearly visible, along with a single piece of charcoal. Gravelly sandy fill
had made its way to the oven center.
Small, Family-Size Fireless Earth Ovens with
Rock Heating Elements
We built and used three small fireless earth ovens in 2009 and 2013 with
varying degrees of success. This type of tethered baking facility, in which heatingelement rocks are fired in an open hearth and transferred to a nearby oven pit, is
well-documented ethnographically (e.g., Ellis 1997; Messner and Schindler 2010;
Wandsnider 1997;). Temperature ranges and durations were monitored for one
oven. Samples of used packing material and cooking stones from the other ovens
were curated.
Meat Oven, #7-09: A Baking Failure
This fireless oven (ca. 0.6 m diameter x 30 cm deep) was built in conjunction
with the 2009 Hot Rocks Cook Off in College Station. It was heated with four
sandstone rocks, weighing a total of about 30 kg (Figure 13.17). The rocks were
heated in a nearby surface hearth fired primarily with 63 kg of oak and elm branches
(deadfall) and transferred to the bottom of the small oven pit. A well-washed, cottoncloth meat packet with oxtail, duck breast, and rabbit (ca. 4 kg) was placed between
layers of fresh grass and oak-leaf/twig packing material, covered with an earthen
lid, and baked for four hours.
Concerns of about the effectiveness of this baking event arose when none of
the packing material smoldered enough to emit smoke. Upon opening the fireless

dehydrated; in fact, they looked pretty much the same as when the oven was closed.
The meat packet was warm and blood stained; still-green oak leaves underlying
the packet were partially covered in warm meat drippings; the barely warm meats
remained red and raw. The cause of this particular baking failure was evident: the

comparatively small-branch, fast-burning, charcoal-poor fire did not transfer enough
heat to the rocks in the allotted time, which resulted in an inadequate heat-flow
regime: Heating ElementàFood. In short, the cost of not heating the cooking stones
nearly enough for the task at hand is raw food.

Meat Oven, #8-09: A Baking Success
This “re-do” oven (ca. 0.5 m diameter x 30 cm deep) was built one day after
the failed oven (#7-09) baking episode. We reused the same oven pit and heated the
rocks with about the same amount of oak and elm wood (ca. 60 kg), but including
larger, saw-cut pieces. This time we heated the rocks until we were confident they
were hot enough. The heating-element rocks were more numerous but weighed
about 30 kg. They became sufficiently hot to combust some of the packing material
and generate considerable smoke when the packing material was added (Figure
13.18). Two small, well-washed cotton-cloth meat packets, each with a pork roast
weighing about 4 kg, were placed between layers of fresh grass and oak-leaf/twig
packing material, covered with an earthen lid, and baked for 2.3 hours.

Upon opening this fireless oven, we observed that much of the grass and oak
leaves were dehydrated and some of the packing material was charred. The meat
packages were hot, moist, and stained light brown. The pork roasts were medium-rare
to medium in doneness. In this case, we achieved the requisite heat flow—Heating
ElementàFoodàOven-Lid—and the meat was sufficiently well baked to be eaten
to the last morsel.
Meat and Geophyte Oven, #9-13: A Baking Success
This small fireless oven (ca. 0.7 m diameter x 30 cm deep) was constructed
in conjunction with the Sacred Springs Powwow, a public event held in San Marcos,
Texas, in October 2013, during Native American Heritage Month. We heated
limestone rocks totaling 31 kg with 37 kg of deadfall and saw-cut oak wood (Figure

13.19). The meat and geophyte packet, ca. 5 kg, contained one wild cottontail rabbit
and two wild gophers stuffed with and surround by small carrots and red potatoes
along with quartered white onions, all dusted with chili powder. The packet was
placed between layers of fresh grass and cactus pads and oak-leaf/twig packing
material, covered with dry sediment (silt loam), and baked for 3.25 hours. Heatingelement rocks were sufficiently hot to combust some of the packing material, which
created smoke and signaled that the rocks were sufficiently hot.
Upon opening this fireless oven, we observed that the upper layer of packing
material was hot and moist; the lower layer was moist but clearly more dehydrated,
and some of it was charred. The meat-and-geophyte packet was hot, moist, and
stained pinkish brown. The rabbit and gophers were medium-done (hot brown
center); most of the geophytes were well baked; some were underbaked.

Thermal Analysis
Thermocouples were placed on a heating-element rock, in the rabbit, in a
potato, and in the earthen lid. The heating-element temperature at oven closure
was ca. 490°C and steadily dropped to about 150°C when the oven was opened
(Figure 13.20). Within about 15 minutes after the oven was closed, the rabbit
temperature increased to about 75°C; 15 minutes later, the potato reached 70°C .
Oven-lid temperature rose to about 60°C an hour after closure. These temperatures
were maintained, with some fluctuation, until the oven was opened, illustrating
that adequate moisture remained in the packing material and food to ensure a
successful baking event in an oven otherwise hot enough to burn/char the food.
As with other positive outcomes, the overall flow of heat energy was Heating
ElementàFoodàOven-LidàAtmosphere.

Actualistic Examples of OTHER
Hot-Rock Cookery
Our Hot Rocks Cook Off demonstrations in College Station and San Marcos
included stone-boiling nuts and geophytes, grilling rabbit on hot rocks in surface
hearth, and roasting rabbit directly on ash-covered hot coals in an open hearth. These
cooking events were not conducted as controlled experiments, but were undertaken
to further enlighten us about cooking methods and aftermaths that are represented
in ethnographic, ethnohistoric, and archeological records. Boiling, a wet-heat
method, as well as grilling and roasting, dry-heat methods, are hands-on methods
that contrast markedly with the variety of moist-heat, ostensibly low-maintenance,
earth-oven techniques that are the primary subject of this report. Their respective
archeological signatures tend to be significantly less diagnostic as well.
Stone-Boiling Nuts and Geophytes
For this demonstration (#10-09), we heated 15.5 kg of stream-worn quartzite
cobbles, each ca. 10 cm in diameter or maximum length, in a large open hearth ca.

Chapter 13

1.5 m in diameter and fueled by an estimated 50 kg of oak and elm dead-fall (Figure
13.21). After heating, the rocks were: (1) were removed from the hearth with metal
tongs when we thought they were hot enough; (2) quenched in a water-filled 12liter metal pot to remove ash/charcoal; (3) immersed in a similar vessel partially
filled with water and the prepared food to be boiled; (4) left there until the rate
of simmering or boiling visibly began to decline; and finally (5) removed from the
cooking vessel and returned to the surface hearth for a follow-up round of heating.
We boiled shelled/crushed hickory nuts, and our subjective taste tests revealed them
to oily and rather bland. Shelled acorns were crushed, boiled, and pronounced to
be better tasting than the hickory soup but bland as well. Winecup taproots were
boiled whole and judged to be somewhat undercooked and rather pasty with a hint
of sweetness. For each of these wet-heat cases, the successful flow of heat energy was
Heating Elementà WateràFoodàAtmosphere, such that as long as water remains
the food cannot burn.
Successfully Grilling Rabbit
We reused several hot rocks that remained in the surface hearth used to heat
stone-boiling rocks (#10-09), and we added and heated others for our initial rabbitgrilling demonstration (#11-09). After the fire burned down to ash-covered coals,
these expedient, ungreased grilling stones were easy to use without burning the
cook’s hands. Slices of leg meat were draped over a group of small used cookstones
and others were draped over individual stones scattered about in the surface hearth
(Figure 13.22a, b). We also successfully roasted a few pieces of sliced rabbit meat
directly on the hot coals (#13-09; Figure 13.22c). All of the meat cooked to a golden
brown in a few minutes and was consumed quickly thereafter.
We did a similar rabbit-grilling demonstration (#12-13) in 2013 at the
San Marcos event. This time, bone-in rabbit legs were placed on tabular pieces
of limestone placed on a bed of coals remaining from the preceding stone-boiling
demonstration. This meat also cooked to perfection in a few minutes (Figure 13.22d–
f). The successful heat-energy flow pattern in these cases of dry-heat cooking was
Heating ElementàFoodàAtmosphere for sufficient time to result in the release of
some of the meat’s moisture content but not enough to overcook it via excessive
dehydration.
Conclusion: Learning from Actualistic
Hot-Rock Cookery
Tracking Microfossils
Results of the microfossil analysis component of these experiments are
consistent our working model, as generated from our electric-oven experiments and
results of other studies reviewed in Chapter 12: Identifiable starch granules and other
microfossils are exuded, mobilized, dispersed, and deposited on packing materials
and cookstones in earth ovens during, and probably in the immediate aftermath of
a given baking episode as well. Discovery of identifiable starch granules and other
microfossils on in situ heating-element rocks indicates that deposition began during

the baking process, perhaps directly onto sufficiently cooled rocks, or soon thereafter
as residue-laden water dripped/flowed from moist or wet packing material.
These results are also sufficient, in conjunction with other studies, to predict
the translocation of plant microfossils during transition of an earth oven from its
systemic/ behavioral context to the archeological record: Through the centuries/
millennia, plant-food microfossils and other components (e.g., molecules) of exuded
residue that are deposited on leafy packing material or sufficiently cooled heating-

287

288

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

element rocks during the baking process should be remobilized and moved down the
profile by the percolation of rainwater or meltwater. A readily testable hypothesis,
which is contextualized and assessed in the following chapters, is that the plantfood microfossils will be redeposited, via subsurface percolation and evaporation,
on underlying cooking stones and in sediments, along with residue from packing
materials and other clay-size particles (e.g., soil carbonates). As discussed in
Chapter 14, results of our analysis of cooking stones from the archeological record
lend some support to this hypothesis. Those results also highlight the complexity
of distinguishing between ancient and relatively modern plant-food microfossils.
Recognizing Variability as a Pathway toward Understanding
Hot-Rock Cookery
Earth-oven cookery—moist-heat baking between layers of moisture-rich
vegetation in a closed pit—is demonstrably diverse in terms of oven size, morphology,
baking time, and foods baked. Our actualistic experiments and demonstrations
illustrate that basic earth-oven cookery methods are readily replicated by drawing
from the ethnographic and ethnohistoric literature. Successful strategies are quickly
learned through trial and error. With that comes an adequate understanding of how
heat energy flows in various facilities and recognition of critical roles of temperature,
moisture availability, and cooking time.
As Lewis Binford (1983:168) once proclaimed, earth-oven cookery, especially
for bulk processing, storage, or communal consumption, is among “dirty” work usually
undertaken well removed from residential structures and core activities. Such was
the nature of the gatherings for the 2009 and 2010 Hot Rocks Cook Offs, which were
accompanied by overnight camping, with tents pitched some 30 m from the oven
pits. Photos included in most of the figures presented in the present chapter aptly
illustrate the dirty and often tiring work of earth-oven cookery and stone-boiling.
Inspection of the photos in this chapter and consideration of the descriptions
of our hot-rock cookery also show that the cooking area is a palimpsest of diverse
activities, not all of which are directly related to cooking. We also reused baking pits
and surface hearths, and we suspect similar behaviors from ancient cooks with the
result being scattered post-use debris of cooking-related and unrelated materials.
Abandonment assemblages may include cookstones used for multiple purposes
spanning more than one season as well as cached, unused rocks. The experimental
work also created a hummocky landscape that resulted in opened ovens, pits or
trenches dug for “extra” earth for oven lids, and linear sediment piles composed of
discarded earthen lid fill. The surrounding sediments were carbon-stained, with
scattered pieces of charcoal and unburned wood (Figures 13.23 and 13.24).
It is easier, no doubt, to become minimally proficient in hot-rock cookery per
se than it is to become effective and efficient at correctly identifying a diversity of
archeological remains FCR features known and suspected to have resulted from
dry-, moist-, and wet-heat cooking with hot rocks. For example, surface hearths
on which rocks were heated for stone boiling or fireless ovens may be confused
with shallow-basin ovens with rock heating elements. Pits used multiple times for

different purposes as well as for different types of fired-in-situ earth ovens further
complicates reconstructions and interpretations. Heating-element rocks in pits used
in stone boiling and fireless ovens or discarded in unfired pits may not be readily
distinguishable or even recognized for what they are. Thermo-chemical weathering
analysis, however, may well prove useful in making those distinctions.

Results of the Microfossil Analyses19

Andrew R. Laurence, Laura M. Short, and Alston V. Thoms

The microfossil component of the Fort Hood Archeobotanical Project initially
addressed three interrelated research questions pertaining to the relationships
between plant-food microfossils and earth ovens (Thoms 2009b, 2010). (1) Are plantfood microfossils preserved in remains of ancient earth ovens? (2) If present, where
within those remains are ancient microfossils likely to be found? (3) If found, can
ancient oven-baked microfossils be distinguished from naturally occurring ancient
microfossils? Simply put, is it likely that identified plant microfossils from earth
ovens do provide direct evidence of ancient plant use.
As discussed in Chapter 11, during the initial part of our three-year project, it
became apparent that contamination from modern starch granules was a significant
issue that needed to be addressed as well. Accordingly, we added a fourth question:
Can ancient starch granules of cultural and natural origin be differentiated from
modern airborne sources of starch granules? Results presented here are derived
from Laurence’s identification and analysis of microfossil data. The focus is on starch
grain analysis but phytoliths and calcium oxalate crystals are also discussed.
This chapter presents: (1) descriptions of starch granules and other microfossils
that are part of the TAMU reference collections (see Table 11.1); (2) results of the
microfossil analysis of artifacts previously recovered from prehistoric sites on Fort
Hood as part of the current project; and (3) results of microfossil analysis of FCR
from earth ovens and related features partially or wholly excavated at six sites,
along with comparisons with the air control samples offsite rock control samples.
starch granule Reference Collection
Each plant species we investigated for this project produces a wide range
of starch granules, each with its own size and morphological characteristics. These
starch granules, which were extracted from plants added to the TAMU reference
collection (see Table 11.1), are described here and summarized in Table 14.1 following
terminology in Reichert’s (1913) classification scheme. Brightfield and Scanning
Electron Microscope micrographs of the reference samples are displayed in Figures
14.1 and 14.2.
This chapter is an edited version of selected portions of Laurence’s (2013) dissertation, updated
by Short and Thoms.

Lily (Liliaceae) Family USOs
Starch granules in the bulbs of three lily family species in this reference
collection are morphologically similar and largely indistinguishable: false
garlic (Nothoscordum bivalve), rain lily (Cooperia drummondii), and copper lily
(Habranthus tubispathus). Strach granules in the underground storage organs
(USOs) of these lily family plants generally exhibit lenticular or kidney-shaped
morphologies, although elongated forms are common for granules smaller than
five microns. Visible eccentric hila (i.e., visible under transmitted nonpolarized
light) are typical with y-shaped fissure. Lamellae, which appear as concentric rings,
are characteristic of all starch granules from these species. Most granules have a

SE and micrographs b and f were taken using BSE (backscatter electrons). Micrographs d and h
are an elemental map of potassium and iodine, demonstrating that starch can be differentiated
from other material by vapor coating samples with IKI (iodine-potassium-iodide) solution. The
bottom row micrographs are the same starch granules as those from the top row. Micrographs
a–b were acquired 2700x magnification and operated at 15kV and a working distance (WD) of
15mm. Micrographs c–d were acquired at 1900x magnification operating at 15kV and a WD of

diagnostic rounded protrusion near the hilum, which separates starch granules
from these species from the other investigated species.
Dogtooth Violet (Erythronium mesochoreum)
Dogtooth violet (also known as fawn or trout lily) bulbs contain both simple
and semicompound starch granules. Although dogtooth violet is a member of the
lily family, its starch granules exhibit different characteristics and morphology than
the above taxa. The simple granules generally exhibit a visible eccentric hilum with
inverted cone morphology. Visible lamellae (visible under polarized and brightfield
illumination) are common, as are fissures radiating from the hilum. Semicompound
granules have centric to eccentric hila and are generally faceted on one surface.
Visible lamellae are present but rare in semicompound granules.
Eastern Springbeauty (Claytonia virginica)
Eastern springbeauty is a member of the Portulaceae family. Starch granules
from tubers of this species have a wide range of morphological variation. The most
common type is a round granule with two faceted sides converging with each other.
Visible lamellae and hila are rare, although they are present on larger granules (20
µm and larger). When viewed under polarized light, the hilum is centric.
Narrow-Leaf Gayfeather (Liatris mucronata)
Narrow-leaf gayfeather is a member of the Asteraceae family. Starch granules
from this plant’s taproots are polyhedral in shape. They have eccentric hila with
individual or y-shaped fissures. Although compound starch granules are present,
simple (single) granules are much more common. The region opposite the hilum
appears to be constricted or “pinched” when compared to most other strach granules.

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

Greenbrier (Smilax bona-nox)
Greenbrier is a member of the Smilanaceae family. Most starch granules in
the rhizomes (i.e., root nodes) are either round or faceted on one side, but here, too,
there is a wide range of morphological variability. Visible centric hila and lamellae
are predominant on nearly all granules. Both simple (individual) and compound
starch granules are common. This description of starch granules from greenbrier
rhizomes is consistent with that of Messner (2011).
Yellow-Star Grass (Hypoxis hirsuta)
Starch granules from corms of this Liliaceae family plant are common and
occur as simple and cluster granules. Most granules are oval in shape or faceted
along two or three sides. Visible hila are present and slightly eccentric, while visible
lamellae are rare. The granules often have equatorial grooves, which sets them apart
from those of other investigated species.
Groundnut (Apios americana)
Groundnut is a member of the Fabaceae family. Starch granules from tubers
of this species are unique when compared to those from the other investigated
species. Visible lamellae are rare; eccentric hila are usually visible. Starch granules
are elongated and irregular in morphology (they do not conform to a specific shape).
They are diagnostically much longer than they are wide, which results from a lateral
extension opposite the hilum that is comet-like in appearance. Y-shaped fissures
are common. This description is similar to that of Messner (2011) and Reichert
(1913:219).
Winecup (Callirhoe involucrata)
Starch granules from taproots of this member of the Malvaceae family occur
in simple, compound, or semicompound forms. Simple granules have visible eccentric
hila, single and y-shaped fissures, and are cone shaped, although wedge-shaped
granules also occur. Round granules with centric hila occur, but are not as common
as eccentric granules. Compound and semicompound granules are faceted on one
or more surfaces. Visible lamellae are common in all types of granules.
Prairie Turnip (Pediomelum latestipulatum)
Starch granules in prairie turnip tubers (Fabaceae family) have eccentric hila
with transverse clefts, fissures radiating from the hilum, and visible lamellae; they
are faceted on at least one side. Simple and semicompound granules are common,
with simple forms prevailing. Granules often have a rough, pockmarked surface.
These descriptions are consistent with Messner (2011) except that Messner describes
the granules as having nonvisible lamellae.

Chapter 14

Banana Yucca (Yucca baccata)
Yucca is a member of the Agavaceae family. Starch granules from the flower
pods, stalks, and leaves are characterized by their polyhedral shape. Visible hila are
centric to slightly eccentric and are located within a round depression, which has
the appearance of a volcano crater. Visible lamellae are rare. Y-shaped and single
fissures are common.
Prickly Pear (Opuntia sp.)
Prickly pear is a member of the Cactaceae family. Starch granules from the
pads, seeds, and tunas have a wide range of morphologies. Smaller starch granules
(~5 µm) are hexagonal in polar view and have centric hila with visible lamellae.
Starch granules larger than 5 µm have a wide range of morphologies ranging from
rounded or faceted on all sides to irregular with eccentric hila and y-shaped fissures.
Live Oak (Q. virginiana)
Live oak (Fagaceae family) starch granules from acorns and leaves are most
commonly spindle shaped with a transverse cleft. The hilum is visible in granules
that do not have a transverse cleft. Lamellae are common. Compound starch granules
also occur in live oak but are not as common as spindle-shaped granules.
Little Bluestem Grass (Schizachyrium scoparium)
Starch granules in little bluestem grass (Poaceae family) stems and seeds
have more or less centric hila and are often spherical to slightly ovoid or faceted on
all sides. Fissures radiating from the hilum are common and visible lamellae are
sometimes present. Compound and semicompound granules occur, but they are not
as common as simple granules.
Maize (Zea mays)
Starch granules from maize (Poaceae family) seeds have a wide range of
variation. Although polyhedral granules predominate, round and ovoid granules
are also common. Visible hila with y-shaped fissures are predominant, and visible
lamellae are rare.
Laboratory Space and the Pervasiveness of
Maize Starch Granules
All of the tools and chemicals used in processing artifacts were consistently
starch-free with the exception of the powder-free gloves. These gloves are typically
used in the Archaeological-Ecology and Palynology Laboratories at Texas A&M
University. They tested positive for maize starch (see Figure 11.10).
That maize starch is found on many powder-free gloves, albeit in low
frequencies, presents something of an analytical obstacle. In large measure, this
is because the starch granules in maize seeds have a wide range of morphological

297

298

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

variation (Figures 14.3 and 14.4a), which sometimes makes it difficult to distinguish
between maize and other taxa. For example, starch granules in a maize seed (Figure
14.4c) and those from a copper lily (Habranthus tubispathus) USO (Figure 14.4)
have lenticular granules with visible lamellae, y-shaped fissures, and eccentric
hila. Both maize granules and those from a winecup (Callirhoe involucrata) taproot
(Figure 14.4b) have eccentric hila, y-shaped fissures, visible lamellae, and have a
cone-shaped protuberance opposite the hilum. If individual starch granules of these
types are recovered from an artifact, it would be difficult to identify them to a specific
taxon. Recovery of multiple granules, however, should increase the probability of
identifying some of them to a given taxon.
Figure 14,3

Figure 14.3. Selected variation of maize starch granules. Note the differences in the number of
facets, and the overall “roundness” and “sharpness” of corners between the granules.

It is also of considerable significance that air samples taken from urban and
rural settings, as well as in laboratory settings, often contain maize starch (Laurence
et al. 2011). Chapter 15 further explores the potential consequences of maize-starch
contamination during sample collection and processing.
Curated Artifacts
Fourteen of 19 processed artifacts yielded starch granules (Table 14.2). Given
the pervasiveness of maize starch on these tools, no other taxon identifications
were made. Five of 14 tools yielded modified starch granules, including clusters
of gelatinized starch granules consistent with those left behind in a fingerprint
after someone has handled modern processed maize products (Figure 14.5). As
noted in Chapter 11, we suspect these artifacts were contaminated sometime
during excavation, laboratory processing, or curation preparation. Accordingly, we
discontinued the curated-artifact component of the study. It remains likely, however,
that with additional decontamination efforts (e.g., light bath in a sonication container
and rinsing in distilled or fine-filtered water), these and other curated artifacts may
yield ancient starch indicative of their usage.

Samples from Excavated Sites
FCRs from 28 earth ovens and related FCR features at six sites were analyzed
for microfossils with an emphasis on starch granules. The types and numbers of
starch granules recovered from each FCR, rock control sample (RCS), and air control
sample (ACS) recovered and analyzed from each site are presented in this section.
Presence/absence information is presented for other types of microfossils recovered
from each sample. The sites are discussed in numerical order by site number. All
samples and identified microfossils are listed in Appendix C.

NonFeature FCR Samples
Analysis of FCR from this site began with six pieces that were exposed
in the profile of Backhoe Trench 1 when it was reopened to assess the potential
of the prominent burned rock midden (Feature 2) to contain intact earth-oven
heating elements (see Chapter 7). As we learned during the course of our follow-up
excavations, these samples could not be attributed to any of the nine identified earth
ovens. Insofar as these samples were collected and analyzed before we systematically
identified intact heating elements embedded in the FCR, we designated them
“nonfeature.” They probably once were part of intact heating elements and hence
their analysis has comparative value in demonstrating that microfossils are present
on discarded FCR as well.
Sample M2 (see Figure 14.8) yielded: (a) 1 gelatinized granule; (b) 4
distinct phytolith unidentified taxa; (c) unidentified charcoal; (d) unidentified plant
material; and (e) unidentified spores. Sample M3 (see Figure 14.8) yielded: (a) 7

(b) 5 distinct unidentified phytolith taxa; (c) unidentified cellulose; (d) unidentified
charcoal; (e) unidentified plant material; and (f) unidentified spores. Sample M14

Summary and Discussion of 41CV594
Three identifiable and diagnostic taxa were recovered from FCR at 41CV594
including maize, Liliaceae, and Poaceae along with nondiagnostic and unidentifiable
starch granules. Sample M10, from Feature 2C, the large, slab-lined earth oven,
yielded an abundance of Poaceae starch granules (ca. 260) along with clusters of an
indeterminate number of starch granules, most likely Poaceae. Maize, Liliaceae, and
nondiagnostic and unidentifiable starch granules were recovered from control rocks
and the air sample. Some of the starch granules from the control rock samples were
gelatinized. Figure 14.8 illustrates examples of starch granules recovered from the
FCR samples; Figure 14.9 illustrates examples of starch granules recovered from the
control samples. The majority of starch granules were recovered from the bottom of
the FCR, while one identifiable and diagnostic starch granule was recovered from the
top and one from the bottom of the rock control samples (Figures 14.20 and 14.21).

phytolith taxa, unidentified; (c) unidentified plant material: (d) unidentified pollen;
and (3) unidentified spores. Sample M30 (see Figure 14.24) yielded: (a) 5 unidentified

Chapter 14

Control Rocks
Four offsite control rocks from 41CV947 were analyzed. Sample 1 yielded:
(a) unidentified phytoliths; (b) unidentified plant material; and (c) unidentified
spores. Sample 2 yielded: (a) 1 unidentified starch granule; (b) unidentified
phytoliths; (c) unidentified calcium oxalate crystals; (d) unidentified plant material;
and (e) unidentified spores. Sample 3 yielded: (a) 9 starch granules: 7 maize, 1
common bean, and 1 unidentifiable; (b) unidentified phytoliths; (c) unidentified plant
material; (d) unidentified spores; (e) and oak pollen. Sample 4 yielded (a) 8 starch
granules: 2 maize, 5 unidentifiable and 1 gelatinized; (b) unidentified phytoliths;
(c) unidentified pollen; (d) unidentified plant material; and (e) unidentified spores.
Air Samples
Two air samples from 41CV947 were analyzed. The first air sample had
1 maize starch granule. The second air sample had 1 common bean and 1 maize
starch granule.
Summary and Discussion of 41CV947
Common bean (Fabaceae) starch granules, including a cluster of over 100
common bean starch granules, were the only diagnostic starch granules recovered
from any of the FCR, all of which came from one piece of FCR, M61, from the large,
large-rock, basin-shaped earth oven. Interestingly, the cluster bean starch did
not show signs of modification from human activities. Those that were modified
were undergoing hydrolysis. The presence of so much bean starch is likely due to
contamination during excavation, and the source may have been what was consumed
at lunch that day. Nondiagnostic, unidentifiable, and gelatinized starch granules
were also recovered from the FCR. Maize and common bean starch granules were
the only diagnostic starch granules recovered from the control rocks and air samples;
unidentifiable and gelatinized starch was also recovered from the control rocks.
Figure 14.30 illustrates examples of starch granules recovered from FCR
samples from 41CV947, and Figure 14.31 illustrates examples of starch granules
recovered from the control rocks and air samples. Excluding FCR Sample M6, which
probably was contaminated, only one identifiable and diagnostic starch granule was
recovered from the top of the FCR samples and one was recovered from the bottom
(Figure 14.32). The five identifiable and diagnostic starch granules recovered from
control rocks came from the bottom surfaces (Figure 14.33).

41CV984 Samples
Fourteen pieces of FCR and their associated sediments were processed and
analyzed from Feature 4—a multilayered, slab-lined earth-oven embedded in a
burned-rock mound—along with one control sample and three air samples. This
feature was excavated and sampled by levels (2–9, with Level 1 being near-surface
and unsampled) defined in the field by layers of horizontal FCR that appeared to
represent the bottoms of superimposed, slab-lined ovens. Examples of recovered
microfossils are illustrated in Figures 14.30 and 14.31, and the investigated features
and analyzed FCR are illustrated in Figures 14.34 through 14.40. Figures in
Chapters 4 and 9 illustrate the site, its environs, as well as FCR features, in profile
and plan view. Table 14.5 presents summary data for the starch analysis, and a
detailed list of identified microfossils is presented in Appendix C.

Feature 4, Level 2
FCR Sample 8 (see Figure 14.34) was processed and analyzed; neither starch
granules nor biomineral microfossils were recovered.
Feature 4, Level 3
Three starch granules were recovered from the bottom of FCR Sample 11
(see Figure 14.35); two are nondiagnostic faceted granules and one granule is too
heavily degraded to make an accurate identification. The sediment sample taken
right beneath this piece of FCR contained three starch granules: 1 yucca-like granule,
1 lily-like starch granule, and 1 unidentifiable granule. An unidentified phytolith
and oak pollen were also recovered from the sediment sample.
Feature 4, Level 4
The upper surface of FCR Sample 17 (see Figure 14.36) yielded 100+ starch
granules: 1 yucca-like, 1 oak-like, 3 nondiagnostic small round granules, and more
than 100 nondiagnostic small faceted granules. Nine starch granules were recovered
from the bottom of this sample: 6 yucca-like, 1 lily-like, and 1 nondiagnostic small
round specimen, and 1 nondiagnostic small faceted granule. Nondiagnostic phytoliths
were recovered from both the top and bottom surfaces of the FCR sample. The
associated sediment sample yielded 1 prickly pear-like granule and 1 unidentifiable
starch granule. Prickly pear-like and nondiagnostic phytoliths also were recovered
from the sediment sample.
Feature 4, Level 5
The upper side of FCR Sample 23 (see Figure 14.37) yielded a single prickly
pear-like starch granule; 15 granules came from the bottom side: 4 yucca-like, 6
prickly pear-like, 3 nondiagnostic round, and 2 degraded granules. Prickly pear-like
and nondiagnostic phytoliths and calcium oxalate crystals were recovered from the
FCR sample and associated sediment. Cheno-am and unidentified pollen types also
were recovered from the sediment sample.

Feature 4, Level 6
This level is represented by two FCR samples and their associated sediments.
The upper side of Sample 29 (see Figure 14.38) produced 2 nondiagnostic faceted
granules, 1 unidentifiable, and 3 nondiagnostic small round granules, along with
unidentified phytoliths and nondiagnostic calcium oxalate crystals, including
raphides. The bottom of the sample yielded the following starch granules: 1 prickly
pear-like and 1 from an unidentified geophyte; nondiagnostic phytoliths were also
recovered. One unidentifiable starch granule and nondiagnostic phytoliths were
recovered from the associated sediment sample.
The bottom side of FCR Sample 35 yielded one prickly pear-like starch
granule and numerous nondiagnostic phytoliths. The adhering sediment sample
contained 1 gayfeather-like starch granule, 22 nondiagnostic faceted granules, and 12
unidentifiable granules. All of these are than 10 µm and highly modified, suggesting
they may have been gelatinized at one point and subsequently recrystallized
(Cassandra McDonough, personal communication 2011).
Feature 4, Level 7
Three pieces of FCR and their associated sediment samples were processed
and analyzed from this level. The top surface of Sample 36 (see Figure 14.39)
yielded 2 prickly pear-like and 1 yucca-like granules, along with phytoliths and
calcium oxalate crystals diagnostic of prickly pear. The bottom surface did not yield
starch granules but it did yield phytoliths and calcium oxalate crystals resembling
those from prickly pear pads and tunas. One prickly pear-like starch granule was
recovered from the associated sediments, along with prickly pear phytoliths and
calcium oxalate crystals.
FCR Sample 37 (see Figure 14.39) yielded 2 yucca starch granules from
the top surface, along with nondiagnostic phytoliths. The bottom surface produced
1 yucca-like and 1 unidentifiable granule as well as nondiagnostic phytoliths. The
associated sediments contained only prickly pear calcium oxalate crystals.
The top surface of Sample 38 (see Figure 14.39) yielded only nondiagnostic
phytoliths. The bottom surface had a single yucca-like starch granule and
nondiagnostic phytoliths. Associated sediments contained a live oak phytoliths
along with various nondiagnostic phytoliths.
Feature 4, Level 9
Two FCR samples and associated sediment samples from this level were
processed analyzed. The upper side of Sample 44 (see Figure 14.40) yielded at least
two orders of magnitude more starch granules than all the other samples combined;
it also contained phytoliths and calcium oxalate crystals. Moreover, 11 large clusters
of starch granules, including one that was completely gelatinized, contained tightly
packed granules too numerous/obscured to count. Based on the size and numbers of
these clusters, at least another 1,000 granules should be added to the actual count
to more accurately reflect the recovered quantity.

Chapter 14

The 5,054 counted granules included a greater variety of types than all
samples from this feature combined: (a) 1,161 are yucca-like granules; (b) 531
Lily-like granules; (c) 1,266 are prickly pear-like granules; (d) 90 gayfeather-like
granules; (e) 70 unidentified geophyte granules that may be from Erythronium
sp. or Lilium sp. bulbs (note that starch granules from these USO genuses cannot
always be differentiated (Messner 2011); (f) 4 oak granules; (g) 1,200 nondiagnostic
faceted granules larger than 5μm; (h) 528 small (5 µm or less) faceted granules
that are most likely either yucca and/or prickly pear (in this size range they are not
always able to be differentiated); (i) 46 nondiagnostic small round granules; (j) 69
granules of unknown type A; (k) 1 of unknown type B granule; (l) 79 unidentifiable
granules; and (m) and 9 completely gelatinized granules. Phytoliths and calcium
oxalate crystals were also recovered from the top surface representing prickly pear
along with other nondiagnostic phytoliths.
Only 5 starch granules were recovered from the bottom surface of Sample
44: 1 yucca-like, 1 unidentifiable, and 3 completely gelatinized specimens. Phytoliths
from prickly pear and other unidentified taxa were also recovered from the bottom
side. Two starch granules were recovered from the sediments associated with Sample
44: 1 yucca-like and 1 unidentifiable. Nondiagnostic phytoliths were also recovered.
Nondiagnostic phytoliths also were recovered from the bottom surface of Sample
44 after removal of standard carbonate-coating sample.
The top side of Sample 45 (see Figure 14.40) yielded 2 yucca-like starch
granules and prickly pear phytoliths. Two unidentifiable starch granules, along with
phytoliths characteristic of prickly pear and unidentified types, were recovered from
the bottom side. The associated sediment sample was unusually rich in microscopic
charcoal flecks, which effectively obscured any microfossil that may have been
present, thereby rendering identification impractical.
Bt Horizon Below Level 9
Sediment sample 53 was taken from the clayey soil below Level 9 and
processed for microfossils. It yielded 1 gayfeather-like starch granule and 3
unidentifiable granules.
Control Sample Rock
A piece of in situ limestone bedrock exposed in the bottom of a nonfeature test
pit, near Feature 4 was processed and analyzed for microfossils as a control sample.
The upper side, which was exposed to the atmosphere for more than a year, yielded
only nondiagnostic phytoliths. The bottom side produced 8 starch granules: 5 yuccalike, 1 prickly pear-like, 1 lily-like, and 1 oak-like. All of these starch granules were
unmodified, suggesting that they are modern in origin. Nondiagnostic phytoliths
were also recovered.
Air Samples
Out of the 3 air samples, only sample 2 collected starch granules. A total of 3
granules was collected, including 1 yucca-like, 1 lily-like, and 1 unidentified starch
granule. None of the starch granules show signs of modification.

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

Summary and Discussion of 41CV984
A total of 16 classifications of starch was recovered from the FCR samples (see
Table 14.5). Of these, only six taxa could be identified, including maize (Zea mays),
cf. Yucca, Liliaceae, Quercus sp., Opuntia sp., and cf. Liatris. Maize starch granules
identified on these samples most likely represent contamination, probably from the
latex gloves or airbone granules. The remaining classifications—unidentified tuber,
the large and small round granules, large and small faceted granules, Unknown
Types A and B, unidentifiable, and gelatinized starch granules—cannot be identified
to a specific taxa. Liliaceae, cf. Yucca, Quercus sp., and Opuntia sp. starch granules
were recovered from the air samples; maize and Liliaceae granules were recovered
from the control rock. Nondiagnostic/nonidentifiable starch was also recovered from
control samples.
The multi-layered oven we sampled at this site yielded significantly more
starch granules than all of the other features analyzed as part of the present
project. Of particular interest is Sample 44 from the lowest layer of FCR; it yielded
over 5,000 starch granules. Among those were 1162 cf. Yucca, 531 Liliaceae, 1266
Opuntia sp., and 90 cf. Liatris starch granules. Seventy unidentified tuber starch
granules were also recovered. Similar tuber starch granules were recovered in lab
air samples (see Table 14.5). No other sample analyzed for this study yielded such
large numbers of starch granules.
Five comparisons were made between the number of starch granules
recovered from the tops and bottoms of all FCR and control rock samples. As shown
in Figure 14.41 to 14.43, the “recovered starch” column represents the total number of
recovered starch granules in all of the FCR samples from the site. The “total without
maize” column reflects only non-maize starch granules to remove the effects of the
modern maize contamination. The “total without maize and faceted” goes a step
further and removes all of the faceted starch granules, many of which are likely to
be maize starch. The “total unidentified and gelatinized” indicates the number of
starch granules that cannot be identified to a specific taxon because they are not
diagnostic or gelatinized, the latter being granules distorted by heating. And finally,
the “total identifiable without maize or faceted” represents the number of starch
granules that are identified to a specific taxon, exclusive of the modern maize and
possible maize contaminants. This column represent the quantity of starch granules
that represent plants that were inside cooking features both as plant foods and as
packing materials.
The data in Figure 14.41, which are heavily weighted by Sample 44, indicate
that a greater number of starch granules were recovered on the top of the FCR
than the bottom. Given the uniqueness of Sample 44, with 5,054 individual starch
granules as well as 11 clusters with concentrations of starch granules too dense to
count, Sample 44 was excluded from a second set of comparisons in Figures 14.42,
but here too, a majority of identified starch granules were recovered from the top
of the FCR, although unidentifiable and gelatinized starch granules were most
abundant on the bottom side. Eight starch granules were recovered from the control
rock sample, all from its bottom side (Figure 14.43).

Summary and Discussion of 41CV1104
Maize, Liliaceae, and common bean were the only taxa represented by
identifiable starch granules from the FCR, although unidentifiable and gelatinized
starch was also recovered (see Figure 14.6). Maize, unidentifiable, and gelatinized
starch granules also were recovered from the control rocks; the air sample contained
maize and common bean starch granules (see Figure 14.7). The bottom sides of the
FCR and control rocks yielded most of the starch granules (Figures 14.47 and 14.48).

Summary and Discussion of 41CV1553
Seven identifiable/diagnostic taxa were recovered from the FCR: maize,
Fabaceae (common bean), Quercus sp. Opuntia sp., cf. Apios, cf. Liatris, and
cf. Clatonia (springbeauty) (see Figure 14.6). The cf. Claytonia starch granule
recovered from M8, a sample from the large thin FCR midden, was the only starch
granule recovered from this taxon during the Paluxy Sand Archeobotanical Project.
Nondiagnostic, unidentifiable, and gelatinized starch was also recovered from the

FCR. Only one nondiagnostic and one unidentifiable starch granule were recovered
from the control rocks; maize, Opuntia sp., and cf. Apios along with nondiagnostic
and unidentifiable starch granules were recovered from the air samples (see Figure
14.7). Most of the identifiable and diagnostic starch granules recovered from the
FCR was recovered from the bottoms of the FCR (Figure 14.55). Identifiable and
diagnostic starch granules were not among the microfossils recovered from the rock

the top and bottom surfaces; starch granules were not recovered. An unidentifiable
starch granule was recovered from the sediments adhering to the FCR. The upper
side of Sample AJ (see Figure 14.59) yielded one nondiagnostic small round starch
granule and one completely gelatinized granule, along with nondiagnostic phytoliths
and calcium oxalate crystals. Two yucca-like starch granules and 1 oak-like granule
were recovered from the bottom side, along with nondiagnostic phytoliths and
calcium oxalate crystals. The associated sediment sample yielded prickly pear and
oak phytoliths, along with nondiagnostic phytoliths and calcium oxalate crystals.

Feature 2
Five FCR samples and associated sediments were processed and analyzed
from this small, basin-shaped earth oven. The top surface of Sample BD (see Figure
14.60) yielded a modified winecup-like starch granule, a prickly pear calcium oxalate
crystal, and nondiagnostic phytoliths. The bottom side lacked starch granules but
contained nondiagnostic phytoliths were recovered. Prickly pear phytoliths were
recovered from the associated sediment sample.
Five starch granules were recovered from the top surface of Sample BE (see
Figure 14.60) 3 prickly pear-like, 1 nondiagnostic small (<5 µm) faceted granule,
and 1 unidentifiable granule. Nondiagnostic phytoliths were also recovered. The
bottom side yielded 3 unidentifiable starch granules, nondiagnostic phytoliths, and
calcium oxalate crystals. Nondiagnostic phytoliths and calcium oxalate crystals
were recovered from the associated sediment sample.
Sample BF (see Figure 14.60) did not yield any starch granules from its
top surface but oak phytoliths and nondiagnostic phytoliths were recovered. One
unmodified nondiagnostic, unmodified, round lenticular starch granule was recovered
from the bottom surface, along with nondiagnostic phytoliths, calcium oxalate
crystals, and oak pollen. The unmodified character of the only recovered starch
granule is consistent with recent deposition, probably airborne, or perhaps another
form of contamination. Nondiagnostic phytoliths and calcium oxalate crystals, along
with oak pollen, were recovered from the sediments associated with the sample.
The top side of Sample BJ (see Figure 14.60) lacked starch granules but
contained nondiagnostic phytoliths. Five starch granules were recovered from the
bottom surface: 3 yucca-like and 2 unidentifiable granules. Nondiagnostic phytoliths
were also recovered. A single yucca-like starch granule was recovered from the
associated sediment sample.
Starch granules were not recovered from Sample BK (No in situ photograph
available) or from its associated sediments. Nondiagnostic phytoliths and calcium
oxalate crystals were recovered from both the top and bottom of FCR, and from the
sediment sample.
Feature 3
Four FCR and associated sediment samples were analyzed from this large,
basin-shaped, slab-lined earth oven. Neither the top nor the bottom sides of FCR
Sample E (see Figure 14.61) or its associated sediment samples yielded starch
granules. A prickly pear calcium oxalate crystal was recovered from top surface
along with other nondiagnostic calcium oxalate crystals and phytoliths, and an oak
phytolith was recovered from the bottom surface with other nondiagnostic phytoliths.
Oak pollen was also recovered from the bottom surface. Oak pollen, prickly pear
phytoliths, and other nondiagnostic phytoliths and calcium oxalate crystals were
recovered from the associated sediments.
The top surface of Sample L (No in situ image available) yielded 2 yucca-like
starch granules, along with an oak phytolith and other nondiagnostic phytoliths

Chapter 14

and calcium oxalate crystals. Nondiagnostic phytoliths and calcium oxalate crystals
were recovered from the bottom side. Oak and prickly pear phytoliths were present
in the associated sediment sample, along with nondiagnostic phytoliths and calcium
oxalate crystals, pine (Pinus sp.) and unidentified pollen grains.
One unidentifiable starch granule, nondiagnostic phytoliths, and calcium
oxalate crystals were recovered from the top surface of Sample V (see Figure 14.62).
The bottom side yielded 2 yucca-like starch granules, 1 lily-like granule, and 3
nondiagnostic faceted granules. Oak, prickly pear, and other nondiagnostic phytoliths
were also recovered. Prickly pear and other nondiagnostic phytoliths were recovered
from the associated sediment sample.
The top surface of Sample X (see Figure 14.62) yielded one nondiagnostic
compound starch granule, prickly pear phytoliths, other nondiagnostic phytoliths,
and nondiagnostic calcium oxalate crystals (including raphides). No starch granules
were recovered from the bottom surface or associated sediments, nondiagnostic
phytoliths and calcium oxalate crystals were recovered. Prickly pear phytoliths
were recovered from the sediments.
Feature 3A
As illustrated in Figure 14.61 this small FCR concentration is spatially
associated with the Feature 3, the large slab-lined earth oven, but is not clear
whether it is a disturbed small oven similar to Features 1, 2, and 4, a displaced
portion of Feature 3 per se, or something else altogether. Three FCR samples and
their associated sediments from were analyzed from this feature.
Starch granules were not recovered from the top or bottom surfaces of
Sample A (see Figure 14.61); both surfaces yielded nondiagnostic phytoliths and
calcium oxalate crystals. A single unidentifiable starch granule was recovered from
the associated sediment sample, along with nondiagnostic phytoliths and calcium
oxalate crystals.
The top surface of Sample O (see Figure 14.63) only yielded nondiagnostic
phytoliths. The bottom side produced one unmodified yucca starch granule and
nondiagnostic phytoliths and calcium oxalate crystals. The adhering sediment
yielded one unidentifiable starch granule and nondiagnostic phytoliths. Given the
pristine nature of the yucca-like starch granule, its presence is likely resulted from
starch rain during excavation.
Only nondiagnostic phytoliths were recovered from the upper surface of FCR
Sample Q (see Figure 14.63). The bottom side yielded a modified gayfeather-like
starch granule along with nondiagnostic phytoliths and calcium oxalate crystals.
Two lily-like and 2 unidentifiable starch granules were recovered from the associated
sediments as were prickly pear and nondiagnostic phytoliths.
Feature 4
Five FCR samples and associated sediment samples were analyzed from
this small, basin-shaped earth oven. Sample AT (see Figure 14.64) was altogether

347

348

lacking in starch granules. Nondiagnostic phytoliths were recovered from the top
surface, while both prickly pear phytoliths and calcium oxalate crystals, along with
other nondiagnostic phytoliths, were recovered from the bottom side. Associated
sediments yielded an unidentifiable starch granule along with unidentified and
nondiagnostic phytoliths.
The top surface of FCR Sample AW (see Figure 14.64) yielded one
nondiagnostic faceted starch granule and unidentified and nondiagnostic phytoliths.
Nondiagnostic phytoliths were recovered from bottom surface. Associated sediments
yielded nondiagnostic phytoliths and calcium oxalate crystals.
Two starch granules were recovered from the surface of Sample BA (see
Figure 14.64), including one prickly pear-like and one unidentifiable starch granule.
Nondiagnostic phytoliths and calcium oxalate crystals were also recovered. A single
unmodified nondiagnostic faceted starch granule was recovered from the bottom
surface, along with nondiagnostic phytoliths and calcium oxalate crystals. Two
unidentifiable starch granules, prickly pear phytoliths, and other nondiagnostic
phytoliths were recovered from the associated sediments.
Sample BB yielded nondiagnostic and prickly pear phytoliths from its top
and bottom surfaces. The associated sediments, however, yielded one unknown type
C starch granule, as well as, nondiagnostic phytoliths.
The top surface of Sample BC yielded unidentified and nondiagnostic
phytoliths both in the calcium carbonate deposits and in the pipette sample. Two
starch granules were recovered from the bottom side, including one prickly pear-like
and one nondiagnostic faceted starch granule. The bottom surface of this FCR sample,
which was exposed and sampled after removing the standard carbonate-coating
sample, yielded one unidentified geophyte starch granules as well as nondiagnostic
calcium carbonate crystals and phytoliths. One unidentifiable starch granule and
nondiagnostic phytoliths were recovered from the associated sediments.
Onsite, Nonfeature Control Rock
The top side of Sample AR, judged to be a noncultural rock, yielded one
prickly pear-like starch granule and nondiagnostic phytoliths were recovered
from the top surface. The bottom surface yielded 1 prickly pear-like, 1 lily-like, 1
gayfeather-like, and 1 unidentifiable starch granule, along with prickly pear and
nondiagnostic phytoliths. Apart from the unidentifiable starch granule, the starch
granules recovered from this sample were un-modified. The associated sediments
yielded nondiagnostic phytoliths.
Offsite Control Rocks
Two offsite rocks and their associated sediments were processed and
analyzed. The top side of Sample 1 yielded nondiagnostic phytoliths; the bottom side
produced 1 yucca-like, 1 lily-like, and 2 prickly pear-like starch granules. Prickly
pear phytoliths and nondiagnostic calcium oxalate crystals were also recovered.
Five small, round, nondiagnostic starch granules and nondiagnostic phytoliths

Chapter 14

were recovered from the associated sediment sample. None of the recovered starch
granules from either surface were modified. Sample 2 did not yield starch granules.
Nondiagnostic phytoliths and calcium oxalate crystals were recovered from the top
and bottom sides as well as from the associated sediments.
Air Samples
Five air samples were taken at 41CV1657, but only two yielded microfossils.
More than 100 small (<5 µm), round, nondiagnostic starch granules were recovered
from Sample 4. Sample 5 produced one round nondiagnostic starch granule, one
prickly pear-like granule, and one unidentifiable granule. A single nondiagnostic
calcium oxalate crystal was also recovered. The unidentifiable starch granules
recovered from Sample 5 was the only modified starch granule recovered from the
air samples.
Summary and Discussion of 41CV1657
Microfossils, including starch granules, phytoliths, and raphides, were
recovered from all sample types (see Figures 14.57 and 14.58). Maize, cf. Yucca,
Liliaceae, Quercus sp., Opuntia sp., cf. Liatris, and cf. Callirhoe were recovered
from FCR along with other nondiagnostic, nonidentifiable, and gelatinized starch
granules. The cf. Callirhoe starch granule recovered from Sample BD is the only cf.
Callirhoe starch granule recovered in this study. Maize, cf. Yucca, Liliaceae, Opuntia
sp., and cf. Liatris starch granules were recovered from the control rock; an Opuntia
sp. starch granule was the only identifiable/ diagnostic starch granule recovered
from the air sample. The large numbers of small faceted starch granules recovered
from air sample 4 most likely belong to the Poaceae family (grass). This sample
was mounted in Permount, however, and the high refractive index of Permount
obscures the features of starch granules smaller than 5 µm in size, thereby making
identification tentative. The majority of starch granules were recovered from the
bottoms of both the FCR and the control rocks (Figures 14.65 and 14.66).

Chapter 15:
Evaluating and Interpreting the
Results of the STARCH GRANULE AnalysIs

Andrew R. Laurence

As discussed in preceding chapters, macrobotanical data and ethnographic
accounts attest to the use of earth ovens in south-central North America primarily
to bake desert succulents and the underground storage organs (USOs) of geophytes.
We know that many of these foods contain starch as a primary carbohydrate, but
others are inulin-rich and contain little or no starch, including wild onions and
camas. As per macrobotanical analyses, we know that onions and camas were
especially important food resources in the Fort Hood area. In general, results of
the microfossil analysis are consistent with, but do not independently demonstrate,
the concept that inulin-rich plant foods were baked in earth ovens more commonly
than starch-rich foods.
In this chapter we: (1) evaluate contamination issues and the effectiveness of
controls used during field and lab work; (2) address the difficulties of distinguishing
between naturally occurring starch granules found on offsite rocks and those
recovered from FCR that composed earth-oven heating elements; and (3) interpret
the results of the starch analyses and recommend directions for future research.
Effectiveness of Field Collection and
Handling Techniques
As our investigations illustrate, it is sometimes difficult to tease out
archeological starch from modern starch when nondomesticated plant species are
involved. To evaluate the effectiveness of our field collection and artifact handling
techniques, we compared results from: (1) the curated tools, which were collected
several years ago, handled without the use of powder-free latex gloves, and left
exposed to the atmosphere for a year or more; and (2) the FCR collected for the
present project using a clean trowel and powder-free latex gloves and sealed in
sterile bags immediately after collection.
“Gelatinized” is the term that refers to starch granules that are distorted
due to intensive heating. When gelatinized starch granules are recovered in an
archeological context, it is often assumed that they must have originated from food
plants or packing materials heated inside cooking features. There is reason, however,
to question this assumption and consider possible modern contamination sources of
gelatinized starch granules. Clusters of gelatinized starch granules were recovered
351

352

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

on several curated artifacts and associated sediment samples that are very similar
to clusters of gelatinized starch granules obtained from the author’s fingerprints
after handling starch-rich corn chips (Figure 15.1). Clusters of gelatinized starch
granules were not found on any of the FCR samples. One FCR sample from Feature
9, a large basin-shaped earth oven at 41CV947, yielded clusters of unmodified
common bean starch granules that can be attributed to contamination, probably
from one of the excavators’ lunches. This contamination presumably occurred
during excavation rather than when the sample was collected. The apparent lack
of gelatinized clusters on FCR samples suggests that the use of powder-free gloves
during collection may have reduced this form of contamination (i.e., during actual
removal of the FCR sample), but it does not eliminate contamination when samples
are being exposed
Figure for
15.1collection.
The control rocks and air
control samples were successful
in their ability to reveal potential
sources of noncultural starch
contamination occurring at
the sites. However, it remains
unclear what taxa can be
eliminated as contamination
and what can be considered
archeological. This topic is
discussed in greater detail
later in this chapter. Finally,
excavators should wash their
hands prior to collecting samples

free latex gloves. Although we
did not employ this step and
had not yet considered that we should, it may limit the number of starch granules
transferred from the hand to the outside of the powder-free gloves when the gloves
are put on prior to sampling.
Effectiveness of Laboratory Techniques and
Controls
A clean bench is a laboratory bench with an enclosed space that contains air
that has bene filtered to remove airborne contaminants. To evaluate the effectiveness
of using the clean bench, we compared the recovered starch assemblages from
samples processed under the clean bench to those processed in the open lab and to
those recovered from air samples taken in the lab. Many types of starch granules
were recovered from air samples taken in both the Archaeological-Ecology Laboratory
(AEL) and the Palynology Research Laboratory (PRL) (Figure 15.2). Starch granules
a–b and e–o in Figure 15.2 most likely came from maize, thereby rendering them an
unreliable measure of airborne contamination, given that their presence could be

Chapter 15

353

attributed to contact with “powder-free” gloves rather than starch rain. Apart from
maize, one cf. groundnut (Apios americana) and one unidentifiable starch granule
were recovered in an AEL air sample (Figure 15.2c and d), and one wheat starch
granule was recovered in a PRL air sample (Figure 15.2p). Wheat starch granules
were not recovered from any of the artifacts, regardless of whether the clean bench
was used in processing. However, cf. groundnut starch granules were recovered from
FCR processed under the clean bench. Air samples taken under the clean bench
only yielded maize starch granules, which most likely came from the “powder-free”

starch. Furthermore, most of the
culturally relevant starch (Irish
potato) adhered to the simulated
processing tool in the aftermath
of gentle washing. These results
are encouraging and suggest
that washing removes airborne
and other modern contamination
without removing archeological
starch.
Although washing

and lab activities, the use of the
clean bench with a 0.5 µm filter
did eliminate airborne starch contamination in the lab. Air samples taken within
the clean bench did not yield any non-maize starch granules. This suggests that
if all processing and handling of artifacts is done under a clean bench, airborne
contamination can be eliminated effectively in the lab.
Our supposedly powder-free gloves proved to be a source of contamination in
the lab as well as in the field. Periodic testing of the gloves used in the lab yielded
maize starch granules. This undermines both washing artifacts prior to processing
and the use of a clean bench. So long as the gloves have starch adhering to their
surface, this starch will continue to contaminate artifacts. As discussed later in the
chapter, a solution to this problem is to use cleanroom gloves, which while more
expensive, are much less likely to be contaminated with starch granules. Importantly,
all of the granules on the gloves were from maize, a crop that was not cultivated

354

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

by hunter-gatherers in central Texas. As such, the presence of maize starch on the
ancient FCR we sampled resulted, in all probability, from contact with these gloves
or via various types of modern starch rain (see Chapter 11).
Starch Recovered from Curated Tools
at Fort Hood
Our analysis reveals that the curated artifacts were likely contaminated
during excavation or post-excavation analyses and during curation preparation, as
indicated by the presence of clusters of gelatinized starch similar to that recovered
from the author’s fingerprints after eating corn chips. Furthermore, the curated
artifacts probably were exposed to the atmosphere for extended periods of time during
excavation and analysis, thereby accumulating airborne starch contamination. FCR
samples recovered from the field during this project were exposed for much briefer
time periods and were always covered overnight with sheets of plastic. Given the
apparent extent of curated-artifact contamination, no attempt was made to interpret
the starch granule assemblages. While culturally significant data was not obtained
from the curated artifacts, they do provide a cautionary tale about the prevalence of
starch contamination during all stages of artifact recovery, analysis, and curation.
Moreover, by following the processing protocol recommended here (also see Chapter
16), these artifact can be reanalyzed, and we may yet learn more about which USOs
were processed with what tools.
Starch Recovered on FCR from Targeted
Earth Ovens
Overall, the number of recovered starch granules from FCR was fairly low.
Of all of the sites, 41CV984 yielded the numbers of starch granules anticipated to be
recovered from earth ovens where hundreds of kilograms of plant foods were baked
(see Chapters 9–11 and 14). However, even at 41CV984, 99 percent of the recovered
starch from a single piece of FCR (Sample 44). Apart from Sample 44, only Sample
23 from 41CV984 yielded significant numbers of starch granules.
The term “significant” as used here is arbitrarily defined as 10 or more
starch granules that can be identified to a specific taxon other than maize or
nondomesticated grass. Ten was chosen as the significant value because it is greater
than the number of starch granules recovered from the control samples, excluding
maize and nondomesticated grass. Maize and nondomesticated grass is considered
nonsignificant because maize is clearly a contaminant and grass starch is airborne
in very high numbers (Schäppi et al. 1999). It is unknown whether grass starch is
culturally relevant—perhaps indicating its use as packing material—or a result of
contamination.
When starch granules are nondiagnostic or are gelatinized and distorted
beyond identification, the ultimate origins of these starches cannot be determined.
Consequently, all nonidentifiable/gelatinized and nondiagnostic starches were
removed from consideration in the analytical counts. Some researchers argue that
the presence of gelatinized starch is an indication of cultural processes (Babot

Chapter 15

2003; Henry et al. 2009; Perry 2004, 2005) but it is clear that natural processes can
also result in gelatinized starch (Collins and Copeland 2011). We also know that
gelatinized starch can be airborne (Laurence et al. 2011). Accordingly, gelatinized
starch cannot reliably be assumed to be cultural in origin, especially when it is
recovered in low numbers.
At least three mechanisms might account for low recovery rates. First, it is
possible that starch-rich plants were not cooked in any of the earth ovens apart from
41CV984. If inulin-rich plants such as onions were routinely baked in the ovens, as
macrofossil evidence suggests was the case with several of the features investigated
in this study (41CV594, 41CV984, and 41CV1553), starch granules from starch-rich
USOs would not be recovered. Based on the macrobotanical analysis (see Appendix
B), camas and wild onion bulbs accounted for 18 percent of the total charred bulb
and tuber fragments recovered from all sites, and 57 percent of the identifiable
charred bulbs and tubers. Given that camas and wild onions constitute a majority
of the identifiable charred bulb fragments, it seems likely that starch-rich plants
were baked either less frequently or in smaller quantities.
Second, there could be different preservation issues influencing starch
survival at each site that are yet unknown. Starch taphonomy remains a largely
unexplored research area, and the reasons why starch granules preserve at all
are not well understood (Haslam 2004). Experiments demonstrate that there is a
significant increase in microbial activity when starch is added to soil (MartínezTrinidad et al. 2010). It is possible, therefore, that starch-rich plants were cooked
in all of the earth ovens but that the starch granules did not survive on the FCR
due to the increased microbial activity they generated. Undetermined factors at
41CV984 may have allowed greater numbers of starch granules to survive over
time compared with the other sites.
Third, FCR from 41CV984 also had the highest concentration of CaCO3
deposits. The more pronounced the presence of CaCO3 on FCR means that more
water moved through the feature carrying small particles from the local environment,
including starch granules released from plants during cooking episodes, and
deposited them on the FCR. As the CaCO3 built up on the FCR, starch granules
may have become trapped within these deposits and may have been protected from
microbial activity (see Chapters 10 and 12–14).
Statistical and Other Analyses
Mann Whitney U tests were run on all of the FCR and control samples
to determine whether they could be separated statistically. When comparing the
number of recovered taxa and starch granules between the FCR and rock control
samples from all sites, no significant differences were observed (Table 15.1). All
sites were combined for this analysis due to the relatively small number of FCR
samples from individual sites.
It is especially surprising that no statistical difference was found between
starch on FCR and rock control samples, assuming that starch-rich USOs were
actually baked in the sampled ovens. Why, then, were there no significant differences?

First, the lack of statistical difference between the number of taxa recovered
from the FCR and rock control samples could be due to the fact that starch-rich
plant foods baked in earth ovens are also growing in the natural environment.
Therefore, starch granules from wild edible starch-rich plants are expected to enter
the archeological record both as food and contamination and should consequently
be recovered from both FCR and control samples, albeit not necessarily in the same
frequencies.
Second, a lack of preservation due to microbial activity could be responsible
for the paucity of starch granules recovered from the FCR. Only one site, 41CV984,
yielded significant numbers of starch granules and charred unidentified tuber
fragments likely to have been starch-rich (e.g., groundnut and prairie turnip).
Interestingly, none of the FCR samples yielded starch granules characteristic of lily
family bulbs known to be starch-rich (e.g., false garlic, yellow-star grass, rain lily),
and those species were not among the identified plant-food macrofossils.
Third, overall small samples sizes and differences in sampling areas may
negate any statistical differences. Therefore, increasing both the number of samples
and the sampling area in future studies may reveal significant differences between
starch granule assemblages between FCR and rock control samples. To further
evaluate these assertions requires additional analysis of the data already generated,
including factoring in differences in starch granule densities that may have resulted

Chapter 15

from sampling different-sized areas on each side of FCR samples (i.e., 1 and 26.4 cm2
for 41CV984 and 1657, respectively) versus rock control samples (i.e., ca. 4 cm2) (see
“Methods” section in Chapter 11).
In this study, from less than 1 percent to no more than 10 percent of heatingelement FCR from each earth oven was analyzed. Only 2 cm2 (including top and
bottom) was analyzed from FCR samples at 41CV984 and 41CV1657. A total of
52.8 cm2 (including top and bottom) was analyzed from FCR at 41CV594, 41CV947,
41CV1104, and 41CV1553. The overall low recovery of starch granules from each
site is probably a reflection of low numbers of FCR analyzed per earth oven. The
area sampled on individual specimens varied from ca. 5 to 70 percent of the total
surface area, depending on rock size.
Analysis of a larger portion of each specimen would have yielded greater
quantities of starch granules but it would also increase the time needed to analyze
each specimen and presumably decrease the number of samples processed. A more
effective way to recover starch granules than spot sampling may be to sonicate the
entire FCR sample, as described by Pearsall et al. (2004). Apart from increasing
the sampling area, future work should also focus on “intensively” sampling of fewer
ovens by analyzing a significantly higher proportion of the heating-element FCR.
By intensively sampling a given feature and increasing the number of granules
recovered per oven, we are more likely to gain a better understanding of the intraoven distribution of starch granules.
Insofar as inulin-rich plants, including onion and camas bulbs, were baked
in the earth ovens, relatively few starch granules are likely to be recovered from
the FCR. Investigations into the number and types of charred bulbs recovered from
earth ovens across central Texas seem to suggest that usually only inulin-rich or
starch-rich plants were cooked in any given earth oven cooking episode (Mehalchick
et al. 2004:179–186). If this trend is correct, then starch granules are not expected
to be recovered from single-use earth ovens that yielded camas or wild onion bulbs.
However, multi-use ovens may represent cooking episodes of both inulin and starchrich plants.
The large, multi-layered, slab-lined earth oven at 41CV984 was the only
feature that yielded charred inulin-rich bulbs (camas and wild onions) and probable
starch-rich USOs categorized as unidentified tubers. While this finding seems
contrary to other earth ovens investigated at Fort Hood, this particular oven was
used for over 1,000 years, so the presence of starchy tubers and inulin-rich bulbs
represents different cooking episodes rather than one event. Baking inulin- and
starch-rich plants separately is supported by different cooking requirements
needed to render starch and inulin more nutritious, such as different cooking times
(Wandsnider 1997). Our electric-oven experiments support this notion (see Chapter
12). Moreover, starch-rich plants, including false garlic, were fully cooked after baking
for 20 hours in an earth oven, whereas inulin-rich plants such as camas needed 40
hours of baking (see Chapter 13).
As noted, there were no statistically significant differences between the FCR
and rock control samples with respect to the number of recovered starch granules

357

and taxa. There were, however, other differences that merit exploration. First, there
were a few taxa excluding the nondiagnostic types that were only recovered from the
FCR (Table 15.2). Starch granules from cf. Apios, cf. Callirhoe, cf. Claytonia, Poaceae,
and unidentified tuber were only recovered from the FCR. With the exception of
Poaceae and unidentified tuber, these taxa only occurred in very small quantities.

Laurence et al. (2011) caution that the presence of a few starch granules may
indicate a nonarcheological source: airborne contamination in the past or present.
For example, one of the taxa that did not occur on rock control samples, cf. Apios,
but was found on FCR also occurred in one air sample. Poaceae starch granules
appear to be confined to FCR, but air control samples and rock control samples both
yielded small nondiagnostic starch granules (classified as “faceted < 5 µm”) that
may be from Poaceae (grass). One of the air samples from 41CV1657 had over 100
starch granules that were faceted and less than 5 µm. While these starch granules
were most likely Poaceae, the features were distorted by the Permount and therefore
cannot be securely identified as such. Even if the starch granules recovered in air
sample were not Poaceae, the sheer quantity of airborne Poaceae starch (Schäppi
1999) precludes it from being considered unique to the FCR. As noted, however,
grass was commonly used as packing material for earth ovens (see Chapter 13),
which means that Poaceae starch granules may well have resulted from ancient
baking episodes.
The unidentified tuber starch granules, however, do appear to be unique
to FCR, and they occur in high concentrations. While the taxon or taxa cannot be
identified, it is unlikely that these starch granules originated from a domesticated
species such as Irish potato (Figure 15.3). Had the tuber starch granules come from
a domesticated species, then many of them should have been over 30 µm rather
than all of them being 15 µm or less.

Figure 15.3

Chapter 15

Finally, none of the
nondiagnostic starch granules
were considered reasonably
archeologically informative.
This category was excluded
from the analysis because
individual species have a wide
range of starch types that could
potentially belong to some of the
identified taxa or different taxa
altogether. In sum, no individual
taxa can be considered unique
to the FCR samples based on
Figure 15.3. Potato starch granules recovered from: (a–c) author’s
ubiquity alone. As such no
fingerprint placed directly on a microscope slide; and (d–f) author’s
fingerprint recovered off of a table.
individual taxa can be said with
certainty to be indicative of past
human use as opposed to some
form of contamination. Since all of the recovered taxa grow in the study area today
and presumably did in the distant past as well, the presence of a single starch
granule identified as cf. Apios, cf. Callirhoe, or cf. Claytonia on separate pieces of
FCR could be from contamination or ancient plant use.
While none of the identified taxa can be considered unique to the FCR, we did
find quantitative differences between the frequencies of starch granules recovered
from FCR compared to RCS. Significantly more cf. Yucca, Liliaceae, cf. Liatris, and
cf. Opunita starch granules were recovered from FCR. This suggests that while
individual taxa cannot be considered unique to FCR, there are taxa that occur in
much greater frequency. That being said, it should be emphasized that a majority
of recovered starch granules came from a single piece of FCR, Sample 44, in the
multi-layered, slab-lined oven at 41CV984. As alluded to above, it is possible that
this oven was the only one investigated during this project that was actually used
to bake starch-rich plants. If that is the case, such comparably large quantities of
starch granules would be expected.
Clusters of nongelatinized starch granules were also unique to the FCR, as
shown in Figure 15.4, but they were recovered from only three samples: (1) Sample
44, from the multi-layered, slab-lined oven 41CV984, yielded over 5,000 starch
granules; (2) Sample M10, from the slab-lined oven at 41CV594, yielded clusters
belonging to the Poaceae family and many of the granules were gelatinized; and
(3) Sample M61, from a basin-shaped oven with unusually large heating-element
rocks at 41CV947, yielded a cluster of granules from the Fabaceae family. The clusters
from Sample M10 were very similar to the small faceted starch granules recovered
from processed corn chips (see Figure 15.4d), making it difficult to determine whether
these starch granules are archeological in origin.
Starch often gelatinizes during cooking episodes where the water in
the storage organs is heated in excess of 50oC, although the amount of time for
gelatinization to occur varies by species (Gott et al. 2006:45). For various reasons,

however, all starch granules
do not gelatinizes during
cooking episodes (Eliasson
and Karlsson, 1983; Lin et al.
1997; Sumnu et al. 1999). Given
that the majority of visible
starch granules on Sample
M10 were either ungelatinized
or partially gelatinized (i.e.
modified), it is not clear whether
they were deposited during a
baking episode or resulted from
contamination when a trowel
that cut through a Fabaceae
USO during excavation. As
noted earlier, these bean starch
granules are unlikely to have
originated in modern processed
foods since the starch granules
were largely unmodified. They
may well be, however, from one
of the bean (Fabaceae) family
plants that grow at 41CV947.

The majority of clustered starch granules on Sample 44 were not gelatinized
but they exhibited a wide range of morphological diversity, suggesting they likely
came from different taxa. However, given that charred, unidentified tuber fragments
were recovered from this oven, these starch granules may be archeological in origin
rather than a result of contamination. Unidentified tuber starch granules were
recovered in high numbers (n = 70) from this oven as well. The size of these starch
granules were 15 µm or less, suggesting that contamination from processed foods
such as potato chips can be ruled out. Domestic potato starch granules can be well
over 30 µm, and it is very unlikely that only small starch granules were transferred
from an excavator’s hands to the artifact.
In general, clusters of starch granules were rare, as were FCR that yielded
more than 10 non-maize, identifiable starch granules. Given the flat bottom or basin
shape of the ovens with the highest frequencies of starch granules, and considering
that water flows to the lowest point, the expectation going into this study was that
FCR in the center of the earth ovens should have the greatest concentration of starch
granules (see Chapters 12 and 13). FCR samples with the starch clusters yielded
the highest quantities of starch granules. Of the three FCR samples with granule
clusters, Sample 44 from 41CV984 and Sample M10 from 41CV594 were recovered
near the center of their earth ovens, although neither can be considered to have
originated at the center (Figure 15.5). Sample M61 from 41CV947 was recovered
along the edge of its oven.

Figure 15.5

Given that the FCR
with the greatest number of
non-clustered starch granules
originated near the center of
the features, our working model
(see Chapter 12) suggesting
that starch granules may be
recovered in highest densities
in the center of earth ovens may
be correct. Finally, the majority
of identified charred bulbs
recovered from all investigated
ovens came from inulin-rich
plants. Therefore, additional
data from earth ovens where
it is known that starch-rich

and (c) Sample M61 from 41CV947.
to verify this hypothesis. A
formidable issue associated
with the air control samples is
whether or not taxa recovered from them should be eliminated for consideration as
archeological starch, even if those taxa are also recovered from FCR. One problem
with simply eliminating taxa that showed up in air control samples is that native
local species such as greenbrier, winecup, and false garlic were also food resources
(Havard 1895; Thoms 2009a). For instance, Liliaceae starch was recovered from
two FCR samples and one air control samples at 41CV984. Furthermore, charred
Liliaceae bulbs were recovered from the earth oven we excavated at 41CV984. Had
Liliaceae bulbs not been recovered, Liliaceae as a taxon might have been removed
as a potential food resource based on its recovery in the air control samples. In any
event, Liliaceae USOs were clearly baked in this earth oven, as evidenced by the
recovery of charred macrofossils. Therefore, the recovery of a starch type in an air
sample does not preclude it as a food resource.
In situations in which a taxon is recovered both in air samples and FCR but
no charred remains are recovered, quantitative analysis may be used to differentiate
archeological starch from contamination. For instance, very high concentrations of
cf. Yucca (1,162 starch granules), cf. Opuntia (1,266 starch granules), and cf. Liatris
(90 starch granules) were recovered from Sample 44 at 41CV984. These frequencies
are much higher than occurred in the air samples. Although charred remains from
these taxa were not recovered, the high concentration of these starch granules, many
of which exhibit signs of modification, suggests that they were related to ancient
baking episodes rather than contamination.
In the case of the Fabaceae starch granules, only four granules were recovered
from three FCR samples in different features; two granules were recovered in two
air control samples. It is possible that storage organs from Fabaceae were baked in
those earth ovens, but the low concentration of Fabaceae starch granules on the FCR

362

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

samples could be explained either by baking or airborne contamination. In sum, while
air control samples provided information regarding the types of modern airborne
contaminates at Fort Hood, some of them represent nondomesticated taxa that were
growing near the sites in the past, and many of them were potential food resources.
Accordingly, in remains inconclusive whether nondomesticated taxa recovered on
FCR and in air control samples are indicative of contamination, food, or both.
Nondomesticated food resources are not the only source of ambiguity in
determining whether recovered starch granules are cultural or noncultural in
origin. Starch-rich packing material can also prove to be difficult to tease out.
Experiments carried out during the present project entailed using little bluestem
grass (Schizachyrium scoparium) and oak (Quercus) leaves as packing material
(see Chapters 12 and 13). Grass is one of the most prolific producers of airborne
contamination, with a density of ca. 10,000 granules/m3 in the atmosphere during
the grass pollinating season (Schäppi et al. 1999). What this means is that airborne
grass starch probably was deposited in ancient earth ovens during their construction
and after baking when heating elements were likely exposed to the atmosphere for
much longer periods of time.
Our actualistic earth ovens illustrate this point. Little bluestem grass stems
and live oak leaves were used as packing material for these ovens. Starch granules
from both grass and oak were recovered from the FCR. Starch granules from grass
were also recovered from an air sample taken during the duration of the baking
experiments (see Chapter 13). In these experiments, as may be the case for the
earth ovens sampled at Fort Hood, grass starch granules recovered from samples
may represent both packing material and contamination.
Discussion and Recommendations
Two interesting patterns were observed during the course of the microfossil
analysis. First, the prevalence of maize starch granules on FCR and RCSs and in air
control samples. This suggests that maize starch is a significant contaminant. Given
the absence of evidence for maize agriculture in central Texas during prehistoric
times (Collins 2004), it seems reasonable to conclude that its ubiquity is due to
contamination. Second, a majority of starch granules recovered from FCR samples
and rock control samples was from the bottom side of the samples. This is consistent
with our working model that water moving through a sediment profile will deposit
material on the bottom of rocks (see Chapters 12 and 13).
Contamination is clearly a significant obstacle when conducting archeological
starch granule research. Given that contamination from air fall, direct contact with
the excavator (gloves and fingerprints), and contact with starch-rich roots during
excavation was observed during all sampling, collection, and processing stages, it is
difficult to isolate starch that is both ancient in origin (i.e., not modern) and related to
human activities rather than some form of contamination. This study demonstrates
the difficulty of teasing out cultural vs. noncultural starch when nondomesticated
species are the staple plant-food resources. If nondomesticated taxa were utilized
by ancient people and growing locally both in the past and present, the recovery of

Chapter 15

those taxa would be expected in both archeological and control samples. Insofar as
modified starch is airborne and starch can gelatinize by means of natural processes
(Collins and Copeland 2011; Laurence et al. 2011), the condition of recovered starch
granules—modified vs. unmodified—does not reflect whether they are cultural or
noncultural in origin.
As argued here, only the starch granules recovered from the multi-layered,
slab-line earth oven (Feature 4) at 41CV984 are considered, with confidence, to be
indicative of past human cooking activities. First, although Liliaceae, cf. Yucca, cf.
Opuntia, and cf. Liatris starch granules were recovered from rock control samples
as well as FCR, the sheer number of Liliaceae (531), cf. Yucca (1,162), cf. Opuntia
(1,266), and cf. Liatris (90) suggests that these plants were baked in the oven.
In contrast, individual rock control samples from the site yielded only 1 granule
each of Liliaceae, cf. Yucca, 2 cf. Opuntia, and none of cf. Liatris. Second, charred
macrobotanical remains of probable starch-rich unidentified tubers were recovered
from this feature. Feature 4 yielded charcoal with radiocarbon ages ranging from
760 b.c. to a.d. 210, indicating that it was used multiple times to cook plant foods
over a 400–900-year period (see Chapter 4). Accordingly, the hundreds of kilograms
of starch-rich plants likely baked in this oven through time may have increased the
chances of starch survival.
As noted previously, ancient or modern contamination may well account
for the recovery of starch assemblages from earth ovens at the other sites but this
does not mean that plant foods were not baked there. Earth ovens at half of the
investigated sites (41CV594, 41CV984, and 41CV1553) yielded charred camas and/
or wild onion, both of which are inulin-rich and starch-poor; they accounted for
57 percent of identified charred bulb/tuber remains (see Appendix B). That starch
granules were recovered in similar frequencies on FCRs and rock control samples
may be due to natural starch presence and because inulin-rich USOs, rather than
starch-rich plants, were cooked in those ovens.
Another possible explanation for paucity of identified starch granules is
that the number of FCR samples examined per feature was smaller during the
second round of site investigations and because most of the FCR from those ovens
lacked CaCO3 deposits. Heavy concentrations of CaCO3 were only found on FCR
from 41CV984 and 41CV1657. Of those two sites, only 41CV984 yielded significant
quantities of starch granules or charred macrobotanical remains from starchrich taxa. As previously discussed, CaCO3 deposits may protect embedded starch
granules from weathering and consumption by microorganisms. As noted earlier,
had we analyzed a larger proportion of individual FCR samples and rock control
samples, the recovered starch assemblages might have been more representative
of individual ovens and sites.
The Maize Dilemma
An important “discovery” of our microfossil analysis was the sheer quantity
of maize starch granules that can enter into the archeological record from modern
contamination sources. Of the total starch assemblage, it comprised 19.75 percent of

363

364

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

all the starch granules recovered from FCR, 31.25 percent of the air control samples
starch, and 40 percent of the rock control samples starch. It was the overwhelming
dominant species, despite the fact that maize was never a significant part of the
hunter-gatherer diet in central Texas.
If maize was not cooked in the excavated earth ovens, where did it come
from? The most parsimonious answer is that the investigators inadvertently added
maize to the samples by using supposedly powder-free latex gloves to handle and
process the artifacts. Our tests suggest that airborne maize starch settled on the
“powder-free” gloves and their boxes before they were sealed and shipped by the
manufacturer.
Another source of contamination is the atmosphere itself, as shown by
recovery of maize starch from air control samples samples. Maize is grown around
the world, and maize starch is a common ingredient in many food and commercial
products. The sheer amount of maize starch in the modern world means that there
are significant quantities of maize starch in the atmosphere that can cause airborne
contamination (Laurence et al. 2011). The same holds true for any widely used
domesticated grain crops.
FCR from four of the six sites was processed under a clean bench, and all
FCR and rock control samples were washed with distilled water prior to sampling.
As our artifact washing experiment suggests (see Chapter 11), some modern starch
can remain on artifacts after washing, but the quantities should be relatively low.
Consequently, the high quantities of maize starch found on some FCR samples were
most likely deposited on the FCR by means of “precontaminated” gloves rather than
from airborne contamination.
The maize starch recovered in these samples demonstrates a unique
challenge when starch research is applied to regions and time periods in which
domesticated plants are of concern. That maize cultivation does not seem to have
been undertaken in central Texas during the per-Columbian era is the very reason
why its contamination potential was recognized. Had the FCR and tools we analyzed
originated in a region where maize agriculture was known or suspected to occur, the
maize starch granules may have been interpreted as resulting of ancient human
activity rather than contamination. The potential to confuse archeological starch
with contamination is especially relevant with research aimed at determining
whether or not maize was grown long before previously commonly accepted dates
for domestication (e.g. Perry 2004, 2005).
A lack of adequate contamination control measures during excavation
and analysis could make it impossible to determine whether or not the starch
is archeological in origin or from modern contamination. The risk holds true for
many starch-rich domesticated species, given the extent to which maize seed starch
resembles starch granules from other taxa that served as important food resources
(Figure 15.6). Because we know that modern “starch rain” can contaminate artifacts
when they are reexposed to the atmosphere, it is especially important to take air
samples during field and lab work and to use them to help determine which artifactderived starch is contamination and which is archeological.

Future of Starch Granule
Research in Archeology
Fo r a n c i e n t s t a r c h
granule research to move
forward more reliably and
effectively, several issues should
be addressed. First is the need
for more taphonomic studies in
different depositional contexts.
This is well illustrated by the
difficulties we experienced in
reliably distinguishing among
archeologically deposited,
naturally deposited, and
airborne maize starch. There
Figure 15.6. Comparison of starch from: (a) eastern springbeauty;
(b) yucca; (c) yellow-star grass (Hypoxis hirsuta); and (d–f) maize.
are a number of pathways to
the preservation of ancient
starch granules, including soil
aggregates (Golchin et al. 1998), microcracks in the surface of artifacts (Haslam
2004), and soil moisture and pH (Haslam 2004). It is clear that ancient starch survives
in protected settings, but we need much more rigorous testing to demonstrate how
and why this might be the case (Barton and Matthews 2006:94).
Second, there is a need to better understand how to separate and identify
ancient from modern starch in a given species when both forms are subject to rapid
and long-term degradation from weathering and gelatinization processes. As noted,
all of the potential starch-rich plant foods we investigated grow at the sites. As
such, we cannot yet reliably distinguish whether observed starch granules from a
given taxon that are found on FCR and FCS were used as food or packing material.
Third, statistical analysis comparing the starch assemblages recovered
from the FCR and rock control samples suggest that there are no significant
differences between these archeological and natural samples. The absence of a
statistically significant difference could result from several factors, including:
(1) poor preservation of starch granules on heating-element rocks; (2) use of the
ovens primarily to bake inulin-rich as opposed to starch-rich USOs, as is indicated
by recovery of more charred camas and onion bulbs than fragments of starch-rich
geophytes; and (3) too small of sample size, both in terms of the number of FCRs
and rock control samples analyzed and the size of the sampled surface area on each
specimen. Future studies need to be aimed at comparing starch assemblages from
earth ovens where it is known that starch-rich plants were baked with offsite rock
control samples from the same depositional environment.
Fourth, to better distinguish between cultural and noncultural starch on an
artifact, future studies should be aimed at assessing potential physical differences
between ancient and modern starch. Many archeologists use modification as a
standard for determining that starch is cultural in origin (Henry et al. 2009; Perry

366

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

2004, 2005). Others call attention to the fact that modified starch can be a product
of ancient human activities but that it is also airborne and can gelatinize via
natural processes (Collins and Copeland 2011; Laurence et al. 2011). Observation
of starch granules under SEM may detect weathering patterns that are indicative
of age, or dating residues in which starch granules are embedded (Zarrillo et al.
2008). An important conclusion from our investigations is that starch granules
recovered from an artifact should always be considered noncultural in origin until
proven otherwise.
Fifth, is the need to better understand inherent issues with the “maize
dilemma.” Where maize agriculture was practiced, ruling out maize starch as
contamination is much more difficult than is the case with nondomesticated taxa.
In essence, all starch granules from domesticated taxa (e.g., wheat, rice, maize,
etc.) are cultural in origin. Better methods are needed to determine the age of
recovered starch granules, especially in areas where environmental conditions are
not conducive to the preservation of macrobotanical remains. In several regions
of the world, dates for the onset of agriculture have been pushed back based on
recovery of starch granules from domesticated taxa (Perry 2004; Piperno et al. 2000;
Torrence 2006; Zarrillo et al. 2008). Given that modern starch from domesticated
taxa can contaminate artifacts by means of the starch rain, handling of artifacts
without gloves, or the use of starch-contaminated “powder-free” gloves, researchers
need to verify that the starch is ancient before claiming that agriculture took place
earlier than previously thought.
Sixth, is a need to pursue multiple lines of evidence when assessing what
foods were baked in earth ovens. Doing so entails something more than individual
residue analyses (Wadley and Lombard 2007). For example, if macrobotanical
remains are found that correspond to the types of starch granules found on an
artifact, the starch granules can be securely determined to be archeological in origin.
If no such correlation exists, then recovered starch granules should be treated as
contamination unless the overall starch granule assemblage is numerically different
than starch granules recovered from control samples. This does not mean that
macrobotanical remains are always necessary to determine the antiquity and origin
of recovered starch granules, but that several lines of evidence, such as phytoliths
and calcium oxalate crystals, should be used to increase the overall accuracy of the
analysis.
Seventh, visible residues should be targeted for analysis because they are
likely to be cultural in origin, archeological in context and hence, related to the
use of a given tool (Barton 2007). Furthermore, visible residues can be directly
dated, thereby verifying the antiquity of embedded starch, as was done by Zarrillo
et al. (2008) in demonstrating early maize use at the Loma Alta site in Ecuador.
Maize starch granules were recovered from cooking pot residue, as were phytoliths
consistent with maize cobs, although the phytoliths were not conclusively identified
as originating from maize (Zarrillo et al. 2008). By targeting and dating the visible
residues, as well as the use of multiple lines of evidence, Zarrillo et al. (2008) securely
demonstrated that the recovered maize starch was archeological in origin.

Chapter 15

Lab and Analytical Procedures
This study demonstrates the propensity for starch granules to contaminate
archeological samples during all stages of artifact recovery and sampling. To reduce
contamination in the lab: (1) artifacts should be gently washed or rinsed with distilled
water prior to processing to remove loosely adhering starch granules; washing
artifacts reduces field contamination to some extent, especially when samples are
collected without using powder-free gloves, clean trowel, and sealed bags; (2) analysts
should wear protective surgical-type caps to prevent contamination from their
hair; (3) sealed bags should be opened and starch removal and processing should
be conducted on a clean-bench with a 0.5 µm air filter; and (4) clean room gloves
should be used instead of standard powder-free gloves since they are less prone to
be contaminated.
As noted, the lack of statistical difference observed between starch granules
recovered from artifacts and those recovered from the control samples may well
be due to the sample size. Future studies need to be aimed at: (1) increasing the
sample size of both the number of artifacts and control samples and the proportion
the surfaces analyzed on each sample; and (2) undertaking follow-up quantitative
analyses to more conclusively ascertain differences between culturally derived
starch and contamination.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Fire-cracked rock from 28 features at six sites was analyzed for starch
granules. Contamination control methods used included taking air samples and
noncultural rock control samples in the field, air control samples in the lab, handling
all artifacts with powder-free latex gloves, washing samples prior to sampling to
remove modern airborne contamination, wearing surgical caps during processing,
and washing and processing samples under a clean bench. Whereas most of the
contamination control measures proved to be effective at minimizing contamination,
the powder-free gloves turned out to be “precontaminated” with maize starch.
The starch assemblages recovered from fire-cracked rocks and control rocks
could not be separated statistically, although the sample sizes are admittedly
low. Some of the same taxa of starch granules recovered on the fire-cracked rocks
used as heating elements in earth ovens were also recovered in the air samples.
Moreover, some of the food plants growing onsite in the past and at present were
cooked in ancient earth ovens. Given these circumstances, and considering the
contamination control measures in place, only the starch granules recovered from
the multi-layered, slab-lined earth oven at 41CV984 (Feature 4) are considered to
be archeological in origin.
The number of starch granules and taxa recovered from this oven was much
greater than at any of the other ovens or control samples. Furthermore, starch
granules and charred bulbs belonging to a Liliaceae species were recovered. Apart
from the charred Liliaceae bulbs, very high concentrations of Liliaceae, cf. Yucca,
cf. Opuntia, and cf. Liatris starch granules were recovered. These taxa were also
recovered in much higher concentrations than what was recovered from the rock

367

control samples. This suggests that not only can starch granules be recovered from
ancient earth ovens, but that starch from FCR, and by extension other artifacts,
can be differentiated from contamination. Furthermore, the high numbers of starch
granules recovered from the lowest level of the oven is consistent with our working
model, which asserts that FCR at the bottom of the feature should have the greatest
number of starch granules (see Chapter 12).
A primary conclusion here is that more research investigating starch
taphonomy and contamination sources is required. Starch granules recovered
from only 1 of the 28 investigated features were judged to be archeological in
origin. This is not to say that the starch granules and other microfossils recovered
from the remaining 27 features could not be the result of ancient human cookery.
Insofar as contamination and human action can both account for the presence of
the starch granules on the heating-element rocks, it cannot be determined with
any certainty that starch-rich foods were baked in the other 27 ovens and FCR
features. This finding is consistent with natural occurrence of inulin-rich plants in
the study area that are known to have been cooked extensively in the region’s earth
ovens (Mehalchick et al. 2004:179–186). Three of the six investigated sites yielded
charred camas and/or wild onion remains. One of the other sites yielded charred
tuber fragments, and the remaining lacked charred food remains, although they
yielded wood charcoal, as did all the other sites (see Appendix B). This suggests that
inulin-rich plants may have been cooked in most of the analyzed ovens far more
frequently than starch-rich plants.
Results of this study clearly demonstrate the potential that starch
contamination has to obscure archeological results. However, as Sample 44 from
the long-used, multilayered, slab-lined oven (Feature 4) at 41CV984 demonstrates,
archeologically relevant starch granules can be recovered from fire-cracked rocks in
significantly high concentrations. Although important information can be obtained
from heating-element rocks via starch granule research, it is emphasized here that
starch granules recovered from ancient cooking stones or any other artifact types
should be considered contamination rather than cultural in origin until proven
otherwise.

CHApTER 16:
LEARNING FROM GEOPHYTES, EARTH OVENS,
AND FORT HOOD’S ONCE-HOT ROCKS

Alston V. Thoms and Douglas K. Boyd

We began this project with two theoretical assumptions that serve as a
working model and underpin our general research strategy: (1) earth-oven cookery
effectively and efficiently enhanced human carrying capacity by increasing the
caloric yield of a given landscape’s otherwise inaccessible wild plant foods, geophytes
in particular (Thoms 1989; Wandsnider 1997); (2) the proliferation of earth ovens in
a given area is an example of land-use intensification (cf. Ames 2005; Binford 2001;
Thoms 2003) and it is consistent with what Mark Cohen (1977) called “food crises
in prehistory.” In western North America and elsewhere around the world, there is
a broad pattern of temporally punctuated proliferations of earth-oven technology
that tends to be associated with baking wild plant foods in earth ovens with rock
heating elements (Thoms 2009a). Thoms (2008b) interpreted the oven-proliferation
pattern manifested in Texas’s savannah regions as evidence of what he termed
“pre-archaeological carbohydrate revolutions”—in this case, enhanced exploitation
of geophytes with complex carbohydrates that required prolonged baking.
Targeted Sites and Features
Previous archeological investigations at Fort Hood sites on and near the
Paluxy Sand formation demonstrate that many of them contain well-preserved
earth ovens (Boyd et al. 2004; Trierweiler, ed. 1994). We selected the targeted
sites from a list of National Register–eligible properties known to contain wellpreserved earth ovens as determined by previous test excavations and examination
of features exposed in cutbanks and road cuts. Given our objective of recovering in
situ heating-element rocks for microfossil analysis, it was not necessary to excavate
entire features. Our strategy was to expose only enough of each feature to ascertain
its size and morphology and recover a sample of heating-element rocks. Most of
the features were exposed and sampled in profile by reopening and extending old
backhoe and hand-dug trenches, as was the case at 41CV594, 41CV947, and 41CV
553. At 41CV1104 and 41CV 657, earth ovens were exposed in a road cut and a
creek cutbank, respectfully, and sampled in profile. At 41CV984, we excavated a
50-cm wide trench across the center of a previously tested small burned rock mound,
such that samples were recovered in plan view from the trench floor. These methods
proved to be efficient and effective.

370

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

The six targeted sites and many other sites in the vicinity are situated on
or within a few hundred meters, at most, of all the natural resources needed to
support earth-oven cookery. By virtue of a high density of earth ovens at these and
many other Paluxy Sand sites (Boyd et al. 2004), we conclude that the availability
of requisite resources persisted through the millennia in sufficient abundance to
sustain systematic exploitation, including: (1) productive root grounds and fields of
desert succulents; (2) raw cooking stones; (3) wood fuel; (4) oven-packing materials;
(5) potable water; (6) well-drained or otherwise dry sediments in which to build ovens
and on which to live while doing so; and (7) ready access to other nearby resources
necessary to sustain family and communal groups in general, including: (a) safe and
secure residential places; (b) large and small game; (c) fish and shellfish; (d) nuts,
fruits, berries, and other plant foods; (e) green wood and other vegetation for sundry
purposes; and (g) chert for making stone tools.
Feature Size and Morphology
We sampled 28 FCR features at six sites for purposes of microfossil analysis
and we analyzed artifacts—ground stone and FCR—recovered from two previously
excavated sites—41CV595 and 41CV1049. The sampled sites contained remains of
relatively intact earth ovens, representing two types of oven facilities, places where
ovens were built repeatedly (cf. Black and Thoms 2014): (1) burned-rock mounds at
41CV594 and 41CV984, which accumulated over several millennia and contained
primarily ovens with intermediate- (1.0–1.75 m in dia.) or communal-size (i.e., large,
>1.75 m in dia.) rock heating elements; and (2) dispersed family-size (i.e., small, ca.
0.4–1.0 m dia.), intermediate, and communal-size ovens within a thin scatter of spent
FCR spanning several hundred square meters (i.e., sheet-midden). The burned rock
mounds and most of the ovens at 41CV594, 41CV947, 41CV984, and 41CV1553 are
on fairly stable land surfaces. Ovens occurred in stratified contexts at 41CV1104,
where the features are buried in an alluvial terrace, and at 41CV1657, where the
features are buried in a colluvial fan.
Of the 28 sampled features, 12 were communal-size, six were intermediatesize, and 10 were family-size. Most of the intermediate and communal-size oven
basins were probably used multiple times, judging from the quantity of FCR
scattered nearby and from what appeared to be superimposed heating elements
(cf. Black and Thoms 2014). In two cases, family-size features were embedded in
the fill of larger basin-shaped, slab-lined ovens: (1) vertical slabs some 50 cm apart
within the intermediate-size oven at 41CV984, Feature 4; and (2) a basin-shaped
concentration of FCR within the communal-size oven at 41CV1657, Feature 3a.
Table 16.1 lists the types and sizes of earth ovens at each site. As summarized in
Figure 16.1, the six sites where features were investigated encompass occupations
dating to the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods. The chronological evidence
is based on 30 radiocarbon assays, and the resulting calibrated dates are associated
with two burned rock mounds (Feature 2 at 41CV984 and Feature 8 at 41CV1553)
and numerous earth oven features that are well dated by one or more assays (see
Table 3.3).

We targeted earth ovens with intact heating elements and excavated the
following four morphological types: (1) basin-shaped, slab-lined, earth-bottom;
(2) flat-bottomed, slab-lined (bottom and/or sides); (3) basin-shaped, unlined; and
(4) flat-bottomed, unlined. Criteria for identifying an intact, fired-in-place, earth
oven heating element include (cf. Black and Thoms 2014:213–218):
•

•
•

•

In plan view, a circular pattern of comparatively large (ca. 15+ cm), fracturedin-place (i.e., broken apart but still articulated) rocks, with oxidation rinds
indicating that many or most were fired from their bottom side.
In cross section, a convex (i.e., basin-shaped) or flat-bottom lens of heatingelement rocks.
Larger, fractured-in-place rocks often occur along the periphery of the heating
element, presumably where heat was less intense. The edges of some of the
fractured but still-articulated rocks can be surprisingly rounded, probably a
result of weathering of outermost layer, which was more friable after being
heated.
A thin lens composed of some combination of oxidized sediment, ash, charcoal,
or carbon staining immediately underlying heating-element rocks, especially
large ones (cf. Mentzer 2102). Although oxidation is often seen in clayey and silty
sediments, sandy sediments derived from the Paluxy Formation seldom exhibit
clear visual evidence of heat-caused oxidation (i.e., reddish color). Microscopic
and micromorphic analyses, however, are likely to reveal such oxidation.

While we targeted features that appeared to be fired-in-situ heating elements,
eight features (28.6 percent) turned out to lack field evidence of in situ combustion
and therefore were designated FCR concentrations of undetermined function. They
may be remains of fireless earth ovens or stone griddles, but our suspicion is that
they represent substantially disturbed, fired-in-situ earth ovens. These features were
distinguishable from scatters of spent cooking stones by their circular configurations
and presence of at a least a few large pieces of FCR, including some that were
fractured-in-place. The eight FCR concentrations represent two morphological
types—basin shaped and flat based—each of which occurred in intermediate and
family sizes.
Feature Ages
None of the FCR concentrations yielded macroscopically visible charcoal in
sufficient quantity for radiocarbon assay. Charcoal from earth oven features at the
targeted sites yielded isotope corrected radiocarbon ages as follows (see Table 3.3
and Figure 16.1):
•

•

41CV594, with four ages from communal-size ovens ranging from 4350+60
to 1520±70 b.p., along with a modern age, perhaps representative of military
training activities. The 2-sigma calibrated dates for these features range from
3255 b.c. to a.d. 660.
41CV947, with four ages from intermediate-size ovens from 1880+40 to
1050±30 b.p. The 2-sigma calibrated dates for these features range from a.d. 90
to 1020.

41CV984, with four ages for the same repeatedly used central oven pit, of
intermediate size, ranging from 2750±40 to 770±40 b.p. The 2-sigma calibrated
dates for these features range from 915 b.c. to a.d. 1290.
41CV1104, with one age of 3760±60 b.p. from a family-size oven. The 2-sigma
calibrated date is 2280–2050 b.c.
41CV1553, with nine ages from family- and intermediate-size features ranging
from 2090±50 to 240±50 b.p. (2-sigma calibrated 180 b.c. to a.d. 1795) and
four others not associated with individual features ranging from 1860±40 to
1440±40 b.p. (2-sigma calibrated a.d. 60–660).
41CV1657, with 4 ages, two from family-size ovens and two from a communalsize oven, ranging from 1200±30 to 1050±40 b.p. The 2-sigma calibrated dates
for these features range from a.d. 720 to 1030.

These ages indicate that communal-size ovens were sometimes built in the
same burned-rock mound over a period spanning almost 3,000 years, as was the case
at 41CV594. At 41CV984, the same oven pit was probably used for at least 1,600
years. Other sites with multiple ovens embedded in FCR sheet middens, including
41CV947 and 41CV1553, were used primarily over a few centuries. Still others, for
example 41CV1657, have overlapping radiocarbon ages for separate oven features.
Clearly many of the oven sites were “persistent places” on the landscape that
were used and reused for similar purposes (cf. Schlanger 1992; Smith and McNess
1999). Fuel and packing material supplies must have been among the limiting
resources (cf. Kibler and Mehalchick 2010). Whether this kind of use-intensity was
sustained or punctuated, it indicates purposeful landscape management. Burning of
forested/brushy settings, for example, can be directed toward maintenance of open
patches that afforded suitable root grounds and desert succulent fields (Thoms 1989).
Charred Plant-Food Remains from Features
PAI’s data recovery program at Fort Hood has emphasized analysis of carbonstained and charcoal-rich sediment surrounding intact heating elements. Over the
last decade, those analyses yielded numerous charred geophyte bulbs, including
camas and onions, and tuber fragments (Boyd et al. 2004). For the present study,
nine communal and intermediate ovens (32.1 percent of the targeted features) at
five sites (83.3 percent of the targeted sites) yielded wood charcoal and probable
plant-food remains (see Appendix B). One or more species of oak wood accounted for
94–100 percent of the identified fuel-wood charcoal in seven ovens. Other hardwoods
accounted for 45–68 percent of the fuel in two of four communal ovens at 41CV594.
None of the family-size ovens yielded probable plant food remains; most of them
were dominated overwhelmingly by oak wood but two yielded at least 40 percent
non-oak woods.
Probable plant food remains from the five sites include the following:
•

Site 41CV594 yielded indeterminate botanicals from four communal-size
ovens; the slab-lined oven produced camas and indeterminate bulb fragments;
one of the basin-shaped unlined ovens produced onion and camas bulbs as well

as unidentified bulb and tuber fragments
Site 41CV947 yielded pecan shell and unidentified tuber fragments along with
indeterminate botanicals from its intermediate-size slab-lined oven
Site 41CV984, produced camas and onion bulbs along with unidentified bulb
and tuber fragments from its multi-layered, slab-lined, intermediate-size oven
Site 41CV1553 yielded camas bulbs and a pecan shell from its intermediatesize, slab-line oven and camas bulb fragments from one of its intermediate-size
basin-shaped unlined ovens
Site 41CV1657 produced only charred indeterminate botanicals from its
communal-size slab-lined oven

These five sites and many others at Fort Hood were occupied during the same
broad time frames. The people who lived there through the millennia gathered the
same plants foods, including bulbs and tubers, as evidenced by charred remains,
and baked them in the same kinds of ovens fired by the same kinds of wood fuel,
mostly oak (see Appendix B). It is noteworthy that all of the oven types yielded
charcoal in sufficient quantity for dating and that, with the exception of an unlined
oven at 41CV594, all of the identified charred plant-food remains came from slablined pits. This finding is probably an indication that slab linings afford enhanced
protection from weathering and pedoturbation for the comparatively delicate plantfood macrofossils.
Microfossil Pilot Study
Recovery and identification of plant-food macrofossils from earth oven fill
resulted from considerable floatation of sizable samples. Poor charcoal preservation
conditions, which are characteristic of sandy sediments, probably account for
the apparent absence of plant-food macrofossils in most of the earth ovens. The
assumptions here, of course, are that most ovens witnessed one of more plant food
baking events and that remains of those foods routinely entered the archeological
record in charred form.
To better assess the function of earth ovens and our modeled relationships
among land-use intensification, earth ovens, and geophytes, we needed more
substantial evidence about just what kinds of foods were baked in Fort Hood’s
ubiquitous earth ovens and when those events occurred. As discussed in Chapters
10 and 11, recent findings from around the world show that plant-food microfossils
are commonly preserved and may be recovered from ancient artifacts, including
FCR. Enhanced recovery potential is facilitated by the vast quantity of microfossils,
compared to macrofossils, likely to result from earth-oven cookery. Moreover, there is
a greater likelihood that microfossils will be preserved in identifiable forms. Given
the ubiquity of intact earth-oven heating elements at previously excavated Fort Hood
sites, there seemed to be considerable potential to recover plant-food microfossils.

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

Toward Minimizing Contamination
Cautionary statements in the literature triggered our concerns about
airborne and excavator/analyst-derived microfossils contaminating archeological
samples. Those concerns increased as some of our exploratory and initial analytical
results seemed too good to be true. We tested for and found considerable evidence
that microfossil contamination occurred in the field as we were excavating, as we
processed and analyzed curated specimens, and in the air in our laboratories. In
addition, some ostensibly sterile microscope slides and powder-free gloves were
found to be contaminated with microfossils. Airborne maize starch and excavatoror analyst-introduced common bean starch were the most prevalent modern
contaminates, but we also captured modern airborne false garlic starch while we were
baking false garlic bulbs in an experimental earth oven (see Chapters 10 and 11).
In an effort to minimize contamination potential in the field, we began
with a suite of standard procedures, modified them in response to our needs, and
developed the set of field sampling procedures listed in Table 16.2. The overall
goals are to: (1) remove samples with freshly washed hands and tools and using
cleanroom gloves to do so; (2) minimize their collective exposure to the atmosphere;
and (3) place individual samples in a sealed bag/container (see Chapter 11). As
discussed in Chapter 15, analysts must also take steps to minimize contamination
potential during laboratory work. Recommended laboratory procedures are listed
in Table 16.3. Our efforts to establish a means by which to distinguish naturally
from archeologically derived plant-food microfossils also led to recommendations
for sampling and related processing procedures for microfossil extraction from tools
and FCR; they are listed in Table 16.4 (see Chapter 15).
Toward Understanding Microfossil Taphonomy
The microfossil-research component of the present project (see Chapters
10–15) addressed a fundamental taphonomically oriented question: Is it reasonable
to expect to find microfossil evidence of plant foods in the remains of ancient earth
ovens wherein those foods were baked? We sought to ascertain whether and, if so,
how underground storage organ (USO) microfossils are released during the baking
process and how, ultimately, they may be deposited on fire-cracked rocks that served
as earth-oven heating elements.
As our investigations progressed and discussions ensued, it became apparent
that we lacked a working model to explain just how plant-food microfossils might
end up, indirectly, as baking residue on rocks that comprised earth-oven heating
elements. To generate expectations about why and where we should find food residues
within the remains of earth ovens, we needed reliable information about the nature
and mobility patterns of plant-food microfossils during and after baking. Toward
that end, we carried out two sets of experiments: one entailed baking geophyte USOs
in electric ovens and analyzing cooking residue accumulations on the inside of the
baking containers (see Chapter 12); the other involved baking USOs in actualistic
earth ovens and analyzing baking residue accumulations on the heating-element
rocks (see Chapter 13).

Task Description

1

Take an air sample for the duration of the archeological sampling procedure. A variety of methods
and air samplers can be used.
(a) A simple method is to line a sterilized petri dish with distilled water and leave it exposed to the atmosphere at
the site for the duration of the artifact sampling procedures.
(b) Once completed, pipette the water from each air sample into a test tube.

2

Document—maps, photos, and drawings—the feature location within the site and document sample
locations within each feature.

3

Insofar as possible, each sample should include a large, horizontally lying pieces of cook stone (a.k.a.
fire-cracked rock) from near the center of a given heating element. Other sample rocks should be
taken from near other areas in the center and periphery of the heating element. Each sample rock
should be at least 10 cm in maximum dimension.

4

For each cook stone (a.k.a. fire-cracked rock) to be sampled, expose only the top of the rock as residue
samples will be extracted primarily from the bottom side where calcium carbonates and other
microscopic residue tends to accumulate.

5

Wear cleanroom gloves when taking all samples. Previous work has shown that all standard latex
gloves, whether powdered or powder-free, are contamininated with starch grains. Cleanroom gloves
are specifically made for high-tech manufacturing of semiconductors and other nanotechnology
products.

6

Place menu board letters and/or numbers on or near each sample artifact. Photograph the feature
with sample numbers in place.

7

Keep a separate sample log sheet and record sample numbers and all appropriate feature data and
provenience information.

8

Remove artifact from the ground wearing cleanroom gloves.
(a) If sample is for microfossil studies:
i. Quickly place the artifact into a sterile plastic zip-lock bag or saran wrap while never exposing the bottom
surface to the atmosphere (i.e., never turn the artifact upside-down).
ii. Take a sediment sample directly below the artifact, a minimum of 20 g, and place it in a plastic sterile ziplock bag.
iii. Label zip-lock with sample number and provenience information.
(b) If sample is for molecular studies:
i. Quickly place the artifact into aluminum foil. DO NOT label or write on the aluminum foil.
ii. Place the aluminum foil-wrapped artifact into a paper bag.
iii. Take a sediment sample directly below the artifact, a minimum of 20 g, and place it in aluminum foil. DO
NOT label or write on the aluminum foil.
iv. Place the aluminum foil-wrapped sediment sample in the paper bag.
v. Label the paper bag with sample number and provenience information.

9

Repeat steps in Item 7 above for each artifact to be sampled.

10

Use a new pair of cleanroom gloves (see Step 5 above) for each sample.

*Archeological samples refers to fire-cracked rocks (FCR) from earth ovens and other feature contexts and
stone tools. Control samples refers to unmodified rocks from noncultural contexts for analysis comparison.
These field sampling procedures were prepared in May 2011 by Andrew Laurence, with input from Alston
Thoms, Archaeological-Ecology Laboratory, Department of Anthropology, Texas A&M University, College
Station.

Task Description
Cleanroom gloves should be used while handling all microfossil samples since they are completely free of
starch granules and other microfossils. Previous work has shown that all standard latex gloves, whether
powdered or powder-free, are contamininated with starch grains.
Use a new set of cleanroom gloves while processing each sample or set of samples.

2

Analysts should wear protective surgical-type caps to prevent contamination from starch granules that
may introduced from modern shampoos and other hair products. Experimental work shows that corn
starch is a particularly common additive to many hair products.

3

Archeological specimens (i.e., stone tools and feature-associated fire-cracked rocks), laboratory processing
tools, and microscope slides should be gently washed with distilled water prior to process to remove
loosely adhering contaminant starch granules and other microfossils that may have been introduced via
airborne particles or by the field excavator or laboratory analyst.

4

Sealed bags containing archeological specimens (stone tools and FCR) and control samples for analysis
should be opened under a clean bench with a 0.5 µm air filter.

5

Pre-analysis washing (Item 3 above) and microfossil extraction for all archeological and control samples
should also be done under a clean bench with a 0.5 µm air filter.

*Microfossil samples refers to both archeological samples (artifacts and fire-cracked rocks) and control samples
(unmodified, noncultural rocks).

preserved on archeological specimens via comparison with control samples*
Item
No.

Task Description

1

For FCR analysis, extract the microfossil sample from a specified area of uniform size on each
archeological specimen and each control sample (e.g., unmodified, noncultural rock). This will enable
calculation of microfossil concentration values for direct comparison. Experimental work suggests that
more reliable results come from sampling all or significant portions of the bottom sides of FCR samples.
However, sampling from the top and bottom sides is necessary to show the relative microfossil densities
on the top and bottom sides. For comparative purposes, each sampled side of the FCR should be sketched
(outline) and measured sufficiently to allow calculation of the total area sampled.

2

For stone tool analysis, process the ostensibly used and unused sides or edges of ground and chipped
stone artifacts as well as exposed and freshly broken surfaces of FCR samples. This allows for direct
comparison of microfossil density and specific microfossils from used and unused areas of the samples.

3

Use a sonicating toothbrush to dislodge microfossils from microcracks on stone tools. Sonicating baths are
likely to be useful when sampling all surfaces of pieces of FCR.

4

For all specimens that have an accumulated CaCo3 deposit (especially FCR), the outer CaCo3 rind
should be removed as a separate sample by scraping and light washing or flaking off the rind. A second
microfossil sample should be extracted from the underlying surface and from microcracks underneath
this rind. The extraction of multiple microfossil samples from the same area on a single FCR or artifact
allows for a direct comparison of use-life microfossils vs. post-use microfossils.

5

Process all offsite control samples (e.g., unmodified, noncultural rocks) in the same manner as
archeological FCR samples. Offsite control samples should include noncultural rocks of similar size to the
archeological cooking stones, and the offsite samples should be collected from surface and from buried
contexts similar to those of the archeological specimens.

* Archeological specimens refers to stone tools (chipped and ground stone) and feature-associated fire-cracked rocks
(FCR). Culturally derived microfossils may include residue from plant foods and packing materials recovered from
feature-associated FCR and plant-food and nonfood plant residues recovered from stone tools. Control samples
refers to unmodified rocks from noncultural settings, whether surface collected or buried in sediments.

Electric Oven Experiments
To address the reasonableness of expecting to find plant-food microfossils
in ancient earth ovens, we conducted experiments in 2009 and 2013 that entailed
baking wild geophyte USOs in a conventional electric oven (i.e., kitchen range)
and in an electric lab oven. Our primary objective was to determine whether the
resulting baking residues deposited on the insides of the bowls contained identifiable
microfossils from a given USO. Small packets of USOs likely to have been important
food sources for Fort Hood’s pre-Columbian residents were baked for various times
(a few minutes to 12 hours) at temperatures ranging between 135 and 150oC (275–
300oF). Based on these experiments, the following results and conclusions are offered:
•

•

•

•

•

Analysis of cotton-cloth wrappings and bowl residue from the simple
conventional oven baking experiments demonstrated that intact/identifiable,
gelatinized, and unidentifiable starch granules and other plant microfossils
(e.g., phytoliths, calcium oxalate crystals, and miscellaneous plant materials)
were emitted from geophyte USOs while partially immersed in liquid water.
In this case, liquid water is the likely medium for the migration of microfossils
through the cotton cloth and onto the bottom and lower sides of the bowl,
where they were incorporated into the brownish, partially caramelized, cooking
residue.
Mobilization of microfossils in water vapor, as opposed to being immersed in
liquid water, is indicated by the presence of identifiable USO starch granules
and other microfossils on suspended slides in the lab-oven experiment, and on
the underside of cooking container lids and the upper layer of leafy packing
material in the conventional-oven experiments.
The above results indicate that plant foods need not be in direct contact with
cooking stones for embedded microfossils to be deposited or redeposited on
heating-element rocks in earth ovens.
Recovery of little bluestem grass and live oak starch granules from our baking
experiments indicates that packing-material microfossils also are emitted
during prolonged baking. Here, too, mobilization and deposition via liquid water
and vapor (i.e., steam) seems likely. Accordingly, nonfood microfossils should
also be deposited on earth-oven heating elements and in the encompassing
sediments. As such, the nature and distribution of plant microfossils in ancient
earth ovens is likely to be analytically “noisy,” thereby complicating reliable
extraction identification and interpretation of plant-food microfossils.
In answer to our initial research query, we conclude that indeed it is scientifically
reasonable to expect to recover and identify USO microfossils in the remains of
archeological earth ovens in which those USOs were baked.

Actualistic Earth Oven Experiments
With the goal of determining whether exuded microfossils could be tracked
in earth ovens per se, we built an earth oven some 1.75 m in diameter with a rock
heating element weighing about 100 kg. Packets of wild geophyte and domesticated
USOs for control purposes were placed between layers of green-leaf packing material

379

380

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

(oak and grass leaves as well as prickly pear pads, yucca, and sotol leaves) weighing
a total of ca. 60 kg. The oven was fired using about 100 kg of hardwood fuel (oak and
elm), closed, and baked for about 40 hours. A few days after opening it and following
a rain shower, we removed samples of the packing materials and heating-element
cooking stones and analyzed them.
Intact/identifiable and damaged/unidentifiable geophyte starch granules
representative of the baked geophytes and packing materials were recovered from
residues adhering to the packing material and from FCR that underlay the geophytes
in question. Phytoliths and raphides were also recovered (see Chapter 13). Discovery
of identifiable microfossils on in situ heating-element rocks indicates that deposition
began during the baking process, perhaps as microfossil-laden vapor condensed on
sufficiently cooled rocks, or soon thereafter as residue-laden water dripped/flowed
from moist or wet packing material onto the once-hot heating-element rocks.
Results of our actualistic oven experiment, in conjunction with other studies
(see Chapters 10–14) led us to an archeologically oriented working model of earthoven microfossil taphonomy:
Through the centuries and millennia, some of the plant-food and packingmaterial microfossils (i.e., exuded residues) that were deposited on packing material,
on sufficiently cooled heating-element rocks, and in surrounding sediments during
the baking process should be remobilized, moved down the profile by groundwater
percolation, and redeposited via evaporation, resulting in a concentration of
microfossils on underlying cooking stones, especially the bottom sides, and in
immediately surrounding sediments.
Toward Recognizing Structural Variability in
Hot-Rock Cookery
As part of our actualistic oven-baking experiments, we built three communalsize, fired-in-situ earth ovens and baked geophytes for 20 or 40 hours with varying
degrees of culinary success. We also built other ovens, including: (1) a large, 20-hour
rockless oven that successfully baked wild and domestic geophytes; (2) slab-lined
and unlined, 2- to 4-hour, family-size ovens with fired-in-situ heating elements
successfully baked meat and USOs; (3) family-size, 2- to 4-hour, fireless ovens that
baked USOs and/or meat with varying degrees of success. In addition, we successfully
stone-boiled nuts and USOs and roasted rabbit on hot-rock grills and directly on
hot coals.
Collective results of these actualistic experiments illustrate considerable
variability in earth oven baking per se and hot-rock cookery in general (see Chapter
13), as well in the nature of abandonment. Our key observations, findings, and
interpretations include the following:
•
•

Earth-oven and other hot-rock cookery methods are readily replicated by
drawing from examples given in ethnographic and ethnohistoric accounts.
Earth-oven cookery is diverse in terms of oven size, morphology, baking time,
and foods baked.

Chapter 16

•

Successful strategies are quickly learned through trial and error, which results
in an understanding of the how heat energy flows in various facilities and
recognition of the critical roles of temperature, moisture availability, and
baking time.
Abandoned earth ovens and surrounding disturbed areas are comparatively
organic-rich and, accordingly, are likely to be covered quickly by colonizing
vegetation and to afford ideal habit thereafter for a variety of plants.
Our re-use of oven pits, heating-element rocks, and surface hearths on several
occasions and our cooking of different foods in the same places, along with
our discard of post-use and functionally unrelated items, are consistent with
archeological and ethnographic expectations. The collective evidence suggests
that many, perhaps most, ancient ovens are representative of multiple cooking
events (cf. Black and Thoms 2014).
Abandonment assemblages are likely to include scatters of cooking stones used
for single and multiple purposes spanning multiple occupations, along with
caches of unused rocks.
Use of a single site or area for communal and family-size oven cooking tends
to create a hummocky, carbon-stained, and charcoal-rich surface, with pits and
depressions that result from open ovens and abandoned hearths that become
intermingled with rock discard piles and linear configurations of sediments
that result from removing oven lids.
Remains of ancient surface hearths in which rocks were heated for stone boiling
or fireless ovens, with a few remaining therein, may be confused with remains
of disturbed, fired-in-situ earth-oven heating elements.
Heating-element rocks in ancient pits used for stone boiling or fireless ovens
may also be confused with poorly preserved fired-in-situ, earth-oven heating
elements.

Microfossil Reference Collection
The reference collection developed for this project includes starch granules
and other microfossils collected from 11 species found at Fort Hood today and
presumably present in the distant past. Archeological and ethnographic records
suggest that these species were baked in earth ovens (see Chapters 10 and 14):
(1) false garlic, Nothoscordum bivalve; (2) rain lily, Cooperia drummondii; (3) copper
lily (Habranthus tubispathus; (4) dogtooth violet, Erythronium mesochoreum;
(5) eastern springbeauty, Claytonia virginica; (6) narrow-leaf gayfeather, Liatris
mucronata; (7) greenbrier, Smilax bona-nox; (8) winecup, Callirhoe involucrata;
(9) prairie turnip, Pediomelum latestipulatum; (10) banana yucca, Yucca baccata;
and (11) prickly pear, Opuntia sp. Of course, there may be other plants at Fort
Hood today that remain unrecognized as potentially important geophytes or desert
succulents utilized as food resources in the past.
Pecans and other nut foods were not included in the reference collection
because ethnographic evidence indicates they were seldom baked in earth ovens.
Occasional finds of pecan shell fragments associated with earth ovens are interpreted

381

382

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

as shell used as fuel (Boyd et al. 2004:188). Acorns (live oak, Q. virginiana), however,
were included because green oak leaves with attached acorns are likely to have been
used as packing material. Little bluestem grass (Schizachyrium scoparium), another
plant likely used as packing material, was also included in the reference collection.
Maize (Zea mayas) was included, given the widespread presence of its starch as an
airborne, glove-borne, and hair-born contaminate. Domestic potato (Solanum sp.),
wheat (Triticum sp.), and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) were also processed
for comparative purposes, and examples of their starch granules were examined in
online starch granule keys.
Starch granules from the bulbs of three Liliaceae species—false garlic, copper
lily, and rain lily—were found to be morphologically indistinguishable. Accordingly
“Liliaceae-“ or “lily-like” was used as a composite category. Our reference collection
also includes microfossils from the bulbs of inulin-rich camas (Camassia scilloides)
and wild onion (Allium spp.). Their USOs contain phytoliths and needle-shaped
calcium oxalate crystals known as raphides but are largely lacking in starch
granules.
Recovery Results, Evaluations, and
Recommendations
Microfossils from Curated Artifacts and Samples
The initial round of microfossil analysis focused on 41 artifacts and samples
previously recovered from three sites and housed at Fort Hood’s archeological
curation facility. These include: 10 FCR; 7 ground/pitted/battered tools; 2 cores; 5
charred camas bulbs; 14 carbon-stained feature fill samples; and 3 offsite sediment
samples. Of those, five contained only starch granules, and these were two of the
ground/pitted/battered stones, both cores, and one sediment sample. Fourteen of the
artifacts and samples yielded only phytoliths, including the camas bulbs, several
stone tools and FCRs, and feature fill samples. Another 14 samples, including most
of the FCR, the remainder of the tools, and most of the feature fill samples yielded
starch granules, phytoliths, and often unidentified plant material as well as pollen.
The remaining eight samples (20 percent) did not yield any microfossils: two FCR;
three feature-fill samples; and the three offsite sediments samples (see Table C.1).
These results initially appeared promising, but maize starch, in clusters
and as individual granules, turned out to be by far the most common of identified
granules and thereby attested to considerable airborne contamination. Several of
the artifacts also contained maize starch and other microfossils on broken faces,
a finding that also attests to post-excavation contamination. Insofar as 21 of the
specimens/samples (53 percent) appeared to be contaminated (see Chapter 11), we
abandoned further analysis of curated specimens and focused analytical efforts
on FCR samples we recovered from features targeted specifically for microfossil
analysis.
As discussed in Chapter 11, it may be possible to remove recent contamination
by briefly immersing artifacts in a bath of sonicating water. Follow-up extended
bathing should remove ancient microfossils from cracks and crevices. This method

Chapter 16

should be effective in reanalyzing curated artifacts analyzed here as well as other
possible plant-processing artifacts curated at Fort Hood. In light of an ongoing study
designed to evaluate various methods of enhancing microfossil recovery rates20,
we also recommend use of deflocculates in the removal of residue from cracks and
crevices.
Microfossils from Newly Recovered Ancient Heating-Element
Rocks
Sixty-nine FCRs from 28 features at six sites were analyzed for microfossils,
along with eight nonfeature FCRs that are not further considered in this summary
(see Chapter 14 and Tables C.2–C.7). All of the FCR yielded one or more kinds
of microfossils, most commonly starch granules, phytoliths, and calcium oxalate
crystals, along with pollen, spores, and microscopic fragments of miscellaneous
plant material and charcoal (Tables 16.5 and 16.6). FCR from two features lacked
starch granules but yielded phytoliths, miscellaneous plant material, and spores.
Of these, two pieces are from the communal-size oven Feature F2 at 41CV594; and
one is from the family-size oven Feature 6 at 41CV947. The intermediate-size oven
Feature 2 at 41CV1104, represented by two pieces of analyzed FCR, yielded only
maize starch, along with an array of other microfossils.
Maize (Zea mays) starch was found on FCR from 18 features (ca. 64 percent),
as well as on control rocks and in air samples. Starch from domesticated common
bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) came from FCR in two features and from control samples.
Maize starch was found in ca. 44 percent of both control rocks and air samples, while
common bean starch was recovered from two air samples and one control rock. These
findings attest to a prevalence of airborne, glove-borne, and other forms of modern
anthropogenic contamination during field and lab work.
A wide variety of starch granules types was recovered from heating-element
rocks from the six sites and in earth ovens of all sizes. Ten types of starch were
identified to the family or species level and six types remain unknown or defined
only on the basis of size and shape. Other recovered starch was categorized as
granule clusters, unidentified/degraded, or gelatinized individual granules (Table
16.7). Recovered archeological starch granules representing ethnographically known
plant foods and their distributions are summarized as follows:
•

•

20

Liliaceae- or lily-like granules, possibly from the bulbs of false garlic, copper lily,
rain lily, or as yet unidentified species were recovered from ovens at four sites:
(1) from a communal-size, basin-shaped, unlined oven at 41CV595; (2) from
two layers, arguably representing different baking events, of the intermediatesize, slab-lined oven at 41CV984; (3) from a family-size, unlined, basin-shaped
oven at 41CV1104; and (4) from a family-size, basin-shaped, unlined oven and
a communal-size, slab-lined, basin-shaped oven at 41CV1657.
Yucca-like (cf. Yucca) granules, possibly from stalks or seed pods, were recovered
at two sites: (1) from five layers of the multi-used, slab-lined, intermediate-size,
central oven pit at 41CV984; and (2) from two family-size, basin-shaped, unlined
This research is ongoing at TAMU’s Archaeological-Ecology Laboratory.

Also recovered were starch granules from plants that may have used as food
sources or represent packing materials. Since these plants also grow on and near
the investigated sites, the presence of their starch granules on heating-element
FCR could also be a result of natural taphonomic processes. Represented plants
are as follows:
•

•

•

Oak (Quercus sp.) granules, which occur in acorns and leaves, were recovered
from three sites: (1) from two layers of the multi-used, slab-lined, intermediatesize, central oven pit at 41CV984; (2) from an intermediate-size, unlined, basinshaped oven at 41CV1153; and (3) from a family-size, unlined, basin-shaped
oven at 41CV1657.
Poaceae (or Gramineae, true-grass family) granules, which occur in stems and
seeds, were recovered from two communal-size, unlined, basin-shaped ovens at
41CV594.
Fabaceae family granules were recovered from an intermediate-size, unlined,
basin-shaped oven at 41CV1153, but it remains undetermined as to whether
they represent edible USOs (e.g., prairie turnip) or inedible species, such as
bluebonnet.

With three exceptions noted in the introductory paragraph, all of the ovens
and FCR concentrations contained at least one of the following types of starch
granules: unknown types, faceted types greater than and less than 5 microns in
size, other shapes, granule clusters, unidentifiable/degraded, and gelatinized. These
types also occurred on control rocks and in the air samples.
As shown in Tables 16.6 and 16.7, other microfossils were also common
on FCR from intact heating elements in communal-, intermediate-, and familysize ovens. Phytoliths in a wide range of forms and shapes, many of which are
potentially diagnostic, were especially common. A variety of potentially diagnostic
calcium oxalate crystals was also common, including raphides, which are abundant
in camas and onions, and druse forms characteristic of cacti. Microscopic charcoal
and fragments of miscellaneous plant material, some of which may also prove to be
diagnostic to family or species level, were part of the microfossil assemblage typically
found on heating-element FCR. Pollen and spores were present but comparatively
less common; they were found in air samples and on control rocks as well.
Taphonomic and Preservation Issues
Results of our pilot study are also suggestive in terms of where microfossils
are likely to be found:
•

•

The highest quantities and greatest diversity of starch granules and other
microfossils, as well as macrofossils, came from in situ heating-element
FCR that was embedded in the blackest—intensely carbon-stained and
charcoal-rich—sediments.
These organic-rich, dark sediments are most commonly found beneath and
surrounding intact heating-element rocks, especially within slab-lined basins,
which probably offer significant protection from weathering effects of laterally

Chapter 16

•

•

moving subsurface water.
Starch granules and other microfossils were more common on the bottom of
in situ heating-element rocks than on top, especially on the larger specimens
and perhaps those occupying the lowest elevations of a given heating element,
which tended to be near the center.
Starch granules and other microfossils were found in sediment adhering to
in-place heating-element rocks as well as in calcium carbonate deposits that
formed on heating-element rocks.

Equifinality Issues: “Naturally Occurring” or
“Anciently Anthropogenic”
The routine occurrence of the same kinds of microfossils on FCR and in air
samples and on control rocks raises serious equifinality21 concerns. This is especially
the case with the starch-analysis results, wherein a Mann-Whitney U Test comparing
the number of recovered taxa and starch granules on FCR and rock control samples
revealed no statistically significant differences. As discussed in Chapter 15, there are
several possible explanations for this unexpected result, assuming that starch-rich
plant foods were baked routinely in the ovens. These include, but are not limited to,
one or more of the following reasons: (1) sampling error resulting from the limited
numbers of analyzed FCR and control rocks and/or the small fraction of their
respective surface areas that were processed; (2) enhanced intra-oven microbial
activity due to the high density of starch granules that, arguably, should have been
present therein; and (3) in some fashion, the onsite presence through the centuries
and millennia of the same plants that were baked in the ovens long ago may mask
inherent differences in the taxa and density of certain starches.
It is also possible, of course, that inulin-rich USOs rather than starch-rich
species were typically baked in the sampled ovens. It is likely, however, that starchrich plants were baked routinely in earth ovens at Fort Hood, judging from the
presence of groundnut and unidentified tuber starch in intermediate-size ovens at
two sites—41CV984 and 41CV1553—as well as fragments of charred tubers from
a communal-size oven at 41CV594 and from intermediate-size ovens at 41CV947
and 41CV984. The repeatedly used intermediate-size earth oven at 41CV984 was
the only oven to yield microfossils and charred macrofossils representative of both
starch- and inulin-rich plant foods. That feature also yielded microfossils from
starch-rich plants, including lilies and probably the unidentified tubers, as well as
raphid bundles, which are characteristic of but not distinctive to camas and onions.
In view of the compelling evidence for naturally occurring starch granules
from ethnographically know plant foods of one taxon or another at every site,
Laurence argues (see Chapter 15) that the much-used, intermediate-size, slab-lined
oven at 41CV984 is the only one of the investigated features that contained starch
confidently attributable to an ancient anthropogenic origin. His conclusion is based
In archeological taphonomy, the concept of equifinality refers to the phenomenon in which “a
particular pattern in material remains ‘can be created by entirely different sets of causal processes’
” (Cunningham 2003:392, as cited in Lyman 2004:25).

on the co-occurrence of starch- and inulin-rich macrofossils and the expected high
density of starch granules resembling those from edible portions of lilies, yucca,
gayfeather, tubers, and cactus on two of nine pieces of analyzed FCR from that oven.
As per Laurence’s argument in general, the unexpectedly low densities of plantfood starch granules recovered from all other heating-element FCR, coupled with a
presence of those same starch types in air samples and on control rocks, rendered
the origin of starch granules in the other 27 features equivocal.
We emphasize here, however, that the scope of the present study is
insufficient to conclude that future investigations are unlikely to reliably detect
anthropogenically deposited ancient starch on FCR from intact earth-oven heating
elements. First, our overall small sample represents less than one percent of the
total number of heating-element rocks in 28 features and only a small fraction of the
total surface area on those rocks. Second, we do not have a good understanding of
why so few pieces of earth-oven FCR yielded the expected density of starch granules.
Third, the data at hand (see Table 16.6) seem to indicate that nondiagnostic starchgranules occur in greater diversity and frequencies on feature-associated FCR than
on any of the control rocks. Fourth, microscopic charcoal fragments were common
on FCR but were not found in air samples or on control rocks, which suggests that
preservation is related in some fashion to the substantial quantity of charcoal
expected to have been present in given oven pits compared to non-oven settings.
Phytoliths, calcium oxalate crystals, and miscellaneous plant material may also
prove to be more common in earth ovens than on control rocks.
From our perspectives, it seems likely that the differences in the density
of plant-food starch granules may be more related to the setting and taphonomy
of a given feature than they are to plant baking activities per se. Said differently,
we should not necessarily expect to find high densities of plant-food microfossils in
every oven used to bake plants. We are well aware that macrofossil preservation
varies from feature to feature, but we do not fully understand why that is the case.
Accordingly, we should not be disappointed that microfossil preservation appears
to be highly variable based on our pilot-study results. What we need is a better
understanding of how microfossils are remobilized after baking episodes and,
especially, the conditions under which they are likely to be preserved. At present, we
can only guess at the complexities of microfossil preservation through the centuries
and millennia. To acquire such knowledge requires follow-up investigations that
include larger samples of cooking stones and more targeted actualistic experiments.
Toward Resolution of Equifinality Issues
The present pilot study demonstrates the utility and potential of microfossil
analysis in assessing the research value of intact, well-preserved earth ovens. Our
archeological findings, as exemplified by the much-used oven pit at 41CV984, are
consistent with our working model:
Through the centuries and millennia, some of the plant-food and packingmaterial microfossils (i.e., exuded residues) that were deposited on packing material,
on sufficiently cooled heating-element rocks, and in surrounding sediments during

Chapter 16

the baking process should be remobilized, moved down the profile by groundwater
percolation, and redeposited via evaporation, resulting in a concentration of
microfossils on underlying cooking stones, especially the bottom sides, and in
immediately surrounding sediments.
Beyond that, our most important finding—an ostensible lack of statistically
significant differences between naturally occurring and anciently anthropogenic
microfossils—remains to be addressed.
Our primary contention is that the lack of distinctions between these types
of microfossil assemblages likely results from sampling error inherent in our small
sample size. Analysis of a larger sample is needed to assess this contention. Logical
follow-up studies include: (1) statistical analyses of nondiagnostic starch and
other microfossil data already compiled for control and archeological specimens;
(2) processing and analysis of unanalyzed portions of the FCR and control specimens
to recover more starch, phytolith, calcium oxalate crystals, and miscellaneous
plant material; and (3) processing and analysis of the additional FCR and control
specimens that were collected during the present study.
burned rock Features, Microfossils, and
ARCHEOLOGICAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
on Fort Hood
Archeologists have been studying fire-cracked rocks in central Texas for
more than a century, but making real progress in increasing our understanding of
these features has come slowly and usually in spurts. We are fond of trying new
and innovative techniques, and sometimes they turn out to be useful, and other
times they prove futile. It is truly noteworthy when a new technique comes along
that makes a real and significant contribution to our efforts to interpret the past.
Sometimes, new investigative techniques can cause us to radically change how we
look at things and how we approach archeological research. In some cases, new
technical innovations can become game changers.
This happened nearly two decades ago in the study of earth ovens and hot
rock cooking, when archeobotanists moved a step beyond macrobotanical plant
identification and began using microscopes and scanning electron microscopes
to examine small pieces of plants recovered from flotation (pioneered in Texas by
Phil Dering). By examining the cell structure of tiny charred plant remnants and
comparing them with modern specimens, archeobotanists were able to make very
accurate plant identifications. Almost overnight, our ability to identify specific
plant parts (such as bulbs and tubers) and specific plant taxa (such as camas and
onion) increased significantly. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, archeologists and
archeobotanists made enormous progress in increasing our knowledge of hot-rock
cooking technologies and prehistoric use of plant foods (Dering 1998, 2004).
In this project, the PAI and TAMU team sought to study plant use in earth
ovens, and we certainly did not ignore the tried and true method of sediment flotation
to recover charred macrobotanical and microscopic plant remains. But we also went
farther, charting new ground in the study of plant microfossils associated with

399

400

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

earth oven features. We gathered modern plant reference materials and conducted
controlled experiments. Using both electric ovens and actualistically replicated
earth ovens, these experiments gave us a strong foundation for understanding
the movements of plant microfossils within a steaming earth-oven environment.
These experiments also touched on postdepositional taphonomic processes that help
explain how and why archeological plant microfossils become concentrated among
the bottom heating-element rocks and sediments inside earth ovens.
During our experimental and archeological microfossil analyses, we
discovered a significant source of archeological sample contamination—airborne
starch grains—that has been largely unrecognized by many archeologists and
archeobotanists. To better understand the extent of this phenomenon, we initiated
systematic modern air sampling, both at archeological sites in the field as well
as in the laboratory setting. These control air samples produced undeniable
evidence of airborne microfossil contaminants, and this led us to develop a series
of sampling protocol (useful in the field and in the laboratory) that includes taking
control air samples to capture modern airborne contaminants and factor them out
in archeological samples. All of these efforts led to refinements in our techniques
for extracting and identifying archeological microfossils, whether they are from
prehistoric stone tools or feature-associated cooking stones and sediments.
When taken individually, any one of the separate sampling and analytical
techniques that we employed is not new. When taken collectively, however, the
broad suite of field sampling methods and laboratory analysis techniques that we
developed for this project does represent an innovative approach to the study of
archeobotanical remains from hot rock cooking features. Admittedly, our efforts were
very much focused on the extraction and identification of starch grains, and we gave
only cursory attention to other types of plant microfossils (such as phytoliths and
calcium oxalate) that are just as important. By focusing on starch grain analysis,
however, we were able to study the complex taphonomic processes at play within
earth ovens, and to look at the broader relationships between plants, earth oven
cooking, and the formation of burned rock mounds and middens. It remains to
be seen if plant microfossil studies such as these will become a game changer for
archeological investigations of earth ovens and burned rock middens, but right now
these methods look extremely promising.
So where do we go from here? It is a simple step to expand microfossil
studies to be more holistic in scope. In addition to the starch grains, equal attention
must be paid to examining other types of plant microfossils (such as phytoliths,
raphides, calcium oxalate crystals, etc.), and this is critical if want to see the full
suite of potential plant resources that were utilized. It seems that microfossil studies
of earth ovens have great potential to contribute significant evidence to further
our understanding of human and plant interactions in prehistory. However, more
experimental work is certainly needed and should be pursued.
One of the inherent problems in archeology at Fort Hood and elsewhere in
central Texas is the difficulty in recognizing intact earth ovens cooking features
and being able to distinguish them from other types of heated rock features such as

Chapter 16

surface hearths or borrow pits that were backfilled with discarded midden debris.
Recognition of an earth oven is quite easy in cases where the excavations reveal a
distinct basin-shaped pit that is lined with large heated rocks that overlay a layer
of dark, charcoal-stained sediment. In clayey sediments, the earth oven may also
have a basal zone of heat-oxidized sediment that provides definitive proof of in situ
burning. Unfortunately, in many archeological settings, especially in the Paluxy
sands, it is difficult to see definitive evidence of in situ burning at the base of
intrusive earth ovens. In the absence of easily identifiable visual evidence of in situ
burning associated with many definite and probable earth ovens, micromorphological
analyses of the basal sediments might prove to be a useful technique to provide
such evidence (Goldberg and Macphail 2003). In cases where visual or analytical
evidence of in situ burning (Mentzer 2012) is lacking, however, the recognition of
earth ovens in various stages of disturbance and decay must rely on a combination
of morphological characteristics to infer that specific concentrations of burned or
fire-cracked rocks functioned as earth ovens. As described earlier in this chapter,
we have defined a set of working criteria for identifying archeological earth oven
features that can be tested and refined as we gather more data.
From a land management perspective, what have we learned that can
help the United States Army and the Fort Hood Cultural Resources Management
Program deal with its abundant archeological resources? The Fort Hood resource
managers face a daunting task of protecting significant archeological resources while
at the same time facilitating large-scale training activities involving soldiers and
heavy armored vehicles. With their goals in mind, we offer the following general
observations and suggestions:
•

•

For many years before Fort Hood’s CRM Program implemented site protective
measures, Paluxy sites were subject to impacts from regular military training
activities. These activities included digging of foxholes, being run over by
wheeled and tracked vehicles, and the accelerated erosion caused by loss of
vegetation cover in high-traffic areas. The primary management goal of this
project was to mitigate some of these previous impacts and to reevaluate the
research potential and National Register eligibility of selected Paluxy sites. This
project was successful in that the archeological investigations at five Paluxy
sites do indeed serve to mitigate previous impacts to some of the important
archeological resources. The notable contributions are what was learned
from these investigations: (1) the complete excavation of a small burned rock
mound (Feature 8) and its internal earth oven features at 41CV1553; (2) the
investigation of a significant portion of a burned rock mound (Feature 2) at
41CV594 and the complete and partial excavations of many of its internal
earth oven features; (3) the investigation of a portion of the central earth oven
in a burned rock mound (Feature 4) at 41CV984; and (4) the investigations of
isolated and dispersed earth ovens and burned rock features at 41CV947 and
41CV1049.
This project did not attempt to formally evaluate the effectiveness of the
protective measures implemented by the Fort Hood CRM program to protect
Paluxy sites. However, enough sites were investigated that a few observations

401

402

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils

may be offered. (1) It appears that the designation of all National Register-eligible
sites as “No Dig” areas by the Fort Hood CRM Program has been an effective
management tool to protect Paluxy sites. Relative to the site conditions as
described in previous investigations, it appears that no recent military impacts
have occurred in the Paluxy site areas investigated for this project. Because army
troops cannot camp in “No Dig” areas, this reduces or eliminates virtually all of
the vehicle traffic. (2) The large rock-pile barricades that were placed between
tree clusters around the perimeter of 41CV947 appear to have completely stopped
the vehicle traffic from crossing this site. (3) The rerouting of the main tank trail
away from the burned rock mound (Feature 2) at 41CV594 has eliminated the
threat of vehicle traffic to the core area of this site. And finally, (4) erosion was
not observed to be a significant problem at any of the investigated Paluxy sites.
Active erosion was observed in some tank trails on the margins of the sites, but
not in any of the investigated areas. In all likelihood, this is due to the protective
measures, which have stopped military vehicle from disturbing the sediments
and removing vegetation cover.
•

Ground-penetrating radar survey proved to be an effective tool for locating buried
burned rock features at several Paluxy sites, and it was especially productive
at 41CV1553, where a complete burned rock mound (Feature 8) was discovered.
This small (ca. 5.0x5.5-m) mound had no surface manifestation, and it was
completely buried. GPR should work well at any other Paluxy sites where the
sandy sediments are relatively thick, and it will be most productive in large,
relatively level areas where no archeological remains are evident on the surface.

•

Analysis of starch granules and other types of plant microfossils offer a powerful
tool to examine earth oven cooking and, in turn, the role that earth ovens play
in the formation of burned rock mounds and middens. As large-scale cooking
facilities found across central and west Texas, burned rock mounds and middens
were persistent places that were reused many times by many different peoples.
From an archeological perspective, they are a critical key to understanding
Texas’s prehistory. This concept is especially important for Fort Hood because
burned rock mounds and middens are one of the most common types of National
Register–eligible archeological sites on the 340-square-mile installation.

•

The experimental work conducted for the current study helps explain why
plant microfossils are best preserved among and underneath the bottom rock
linings that served as earth oven heating elements. But we have only scratched
the surface so far, and the learning potential is great indeed. Continued earth
oven experiments, done in laboratory settings and via replicated earth ovens,
can contribute to a better understanding of the complex long-term pedogenic
processes at play in abandoned earth ovens. Such experimental work is critical
to the ultimate archeological goal of defining human and plant interactions
throughout prehistory.

•

As the costs of conducting archeological investigations continue to increase, we
must look hard to find new ways of doing fieldwork that limit labor costs but
maximize information return. Plant microfossil studies are not new in archeology,

Chapter 16

but the streamlined field investigation methods we used (i.e., cross-sectioning
and profiling features), coupled with macrobotanical and microfossil sampling
following the field and lab protocols, appear to be extremely cost-effective
methods relative to expected information return.
•

The archeological feature investigation strategies we employed are important
from a preservation standpoint. For this project, many of the site investigations
concentrated on sampling portions of burned rock features exposed only in profile,
without excavating and destroying entire features. In this manner, we can learn
from individual features and preserve portions of them for future research.

•

The current investigations reinforce the concept that any relatively intact buried
burned rock feature on Fort Hood has a high archeological research potential,
regardless of its particular site setting (e.g., intact features buried in alluvial
deposits, Paluxy sediments, or in rockshelters). Even seemingly disturbed burned
rock mounds and middens may contain intact earth oven components within
the larger cooking facility.

•

The current investigations reinforce the idea that Paluxy sites contain a wealth
of archeological evidence buried in the sandy deposits, mostly in the form of
burned rock mounds and earth ovens. Even Paluxy sites that have been subject
to extensive surface disturbances may contain intact remnant burned rock
features that can yield significant archeological data.

Appendix A
The Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (PAI) work plan for Paluxy site investigations
in 2009 called for a focused effort to identify, excavate, and analyze burned rock features
and their associated materials at selected sites on Fort Hood (Kibler 2009). As defined in
this plan, the Fort Hood Cultural Resources Management Program wanted to conduct
a pilot study to test the utility of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) surveys for locating
and identifying buried cultural features in the Paluxy sands environment. This work
was conducted in April 2009, and this appendix reports the preliminary interpretations
of GPR surveys at three sites. Tiffany Osburn of the Texas Historical Commission’s
Archeology Division conducted the surveys, and the work was done at no expense to
the U.S. Army, Fort Hood.
remote sensing on fort hood
The use of remote sensing to examine burned rock middens in central Texas
was pioneered by Abbott and Frederick (1990), who used proton magnetometer surveys
to delineate internal structure within midden deposits. On Fort Hood, several remote
sensing techniques have been employed at several types of sites. Simpson and Peterson
(2004) report on magnetometer and electric resistivity surveys at rockshelters, and
Zeidler (2004) conducted magnetometer (gradiometer), electric resistivity, and groundpenetrating radar surveys at three sites: a rockshelter, an alluvial terrace site, and a
Paluxy site. The Paluxy site, called the Firebreak site, (41CV595), is the most extensively
investigated site on Fort (Mehalchick et al. 2004). The remote sensing surveys at the
Firebreak site had mixed results, due in large part to the fact that the site has been
extensively disturbed. However, the combination of the three remote sensing techniques
did help archeologists delineate and interpret a complex of large unburned cobbles in
the Paluxy sands (Zeidler 2004:Chapters 5 and 6). None of the remote sensing work
at the Firebreak site was focused in areas containing burned rock features or burned
rock midden deposits.
GPR SURVEYS AT three paluxy sites
Personnel from PAI and Fort Hood’s CRM program conducted a field
reconnaissance in early March 2009, and identified 41CV984, 41CV1049, and 41CV1553
as having relatively large flat areas suitable for conducting ground-penetrating radar
surveys once cleared of vegetation. Fort Hood personnel cleared the vegetation from
41CV984 and 41CV1049, and Osburn conducted GPR surveys at these sites on March 31,
2009. PAI personnel cleared vegetation at 41CV1553, and Osburn conducted GPR surveys
in two separate blocks there on April 10, 2009. Due to time constraints, the results of
these surveys were not written up into a formal report at the time, but Osburn provided
GPR maps and preliminary interpretations to PAI for use in the field investigations.
The GPR system used for this project was a Geophysical Survey Systems, Inc.
(GSSI) Subsurface Interface Radar (SIR) Model 3000 with a dual 400 MHz antenna.
For all three sites, the GPR survey transects were spaced at 50-cm intervals, and the
resulting GPR grid maps are presented below as a series of horizontal amplitude slices for
each survey grid. The GPR slices represent all of the reflected radar wave data recorded
between 4 ns intervals. These time slices are calibrated to depth, and each represents a
package or layer of sediment approximately 10 cm thick. The high amplitude reflections

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils
in the slices maps are seen as “warmer” colors—greens, yellows, and reds. The preliminary
analyses of the GPR survey data identified several areas of archeological interest at
each of these sites, with each being an anomaly that could represent a buried cultural
feature. Subsequent excavations were made to test some of the GPR anomalies at these
three sites, as discussed in Chapter 4, 5, and 6.
41CV984
The GPR survey block at 41CV984 measured 40 m north-south by 20 m east-west,
covering an area of 800 m2 (see Figure 4.2). At 41CV984, three anomalies of interest
were identified in the 40x20-m GPR block (Figure A.1). Two are in the northern end
of the survey grid and one is in the southwestern corner. Many of the GPR anomalies
may be correlated with ground disturbances, especially the large linear north-south
anomaly. The large Area A anomaly, however, clearly represents Feature 2, which is a
known burned rock mound that has a low-relief surface expression (Figure A.2). The
GPR data clearly show a circular subsurface anomaly that represents a ring of dense
burned rocks around a void where the deep central earth oven is located. As discussed
in Chapter 4, a hand-dug trench across the central portion of the Feature 2 mound
confirmed the presence of a deep stratified central earth oven inside this ring. Shovel
testing in Areas B and C identified small burned rock clusters as the probably sources
of the GPR anomalies (see Chapter 4). Notably, shovel tests placed in three nonanomaly
areas within the GPR grid yielded no burned rocks at all.
41cv1049
At 41CV1049, the survey block was L-shaped but covered an area of ca. 165 m2
(see Figure 5.2). The original survey grid was laid out as a 25x12-m block, but only a
portion of the block could be surveyed due to vegetation and slope issues. The surveyed
area included a 10x12-m block, and a 4x15-m leg extended north off of the northeast
corner of the main block. The preliminary analysis identified three anomalies of
archeological interest (Figure A.3). One is near the central portion of the main survey
block, and the other two are along the eastern margin of the survey grid. These three
anomalies were examined with shovel tests, as discussed in Chapter 5, but no definitive
evidence was found to determine what was causing the anomalies.
41cv1553
Two GPR survey grids designated as the north block and south blocks were
examined at 41CV1553. The north block is an L-shaped grid that has a main area of
8x13 m, with a 5x12-m leg extending off the northwest corner (see Figures 6.2 and
6.3). The combined area of these two rectangles is ca. 164 m2. The preliminary analysis
identified three areas of interest in the north block (Figure A.4). As discussed in Chapter
6, shovel tests and test units in these locations did find burned rock clusters or features
thought to be the sources of the GPR anomalies.
The south block is ca. 32x20 m, covering ca. 570 m2 (see Figures 6.2 and 6.3).
However, a linear north-south strip through the block was not surveyed due to the
presence of an entrenched tank trail that traverses the site. This is ca. 70 m2, so the

total surveyed area is ca. 500 m2. The preliminary analysis identified three areas
of archeological interest in the south block (Figure A.5). The smaller anomaly near
the center of the south block was tested with a shovel test that revealed only a few
scattered burned rocks but no substantial burned rock feature. The larger anomaly
in the southeast corner of the block was tested with a shovel test and a test unit, and
these excavations suggest that the source of this GPR anomaly was a natural cluster
of limestone rock, perhaps a remnant bedrock outcrop. As discussed in Chapter 6, the
larger Anomaly A in the southwestern quarter of the block turned out to be a buried
oval burned rock mound that had six internal subfeatures. Four of the subfeatures are
tightly clustered and appear to represent a single earth oven cooking pit just north of
the center of the mound.

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils
discussion and conclusion

The remote sensing work was conducted to answer one simple question: Is
GPR a useful method for identifying buried prehistoric cultural features at Paluxy
sites on Fort Hood?
This effort was conceived as a pilot study to test the utility of GPR in the Paluxy
setting, but the level of follow-up testing was limited, so only selected anomalies were
targeted. Most of the GPR anomalies were initially examined with shovel testing. In
several cases, these shovel tests failed to produce any evidence of what might be causing
the anomaly. The lack of such definitive evidence does not mean that the GPR anomalies
are not indicative of buried natural or cultural features, but the level of anomaly testing
was too limited to provide conclusive data. The best way to effectively test the GPR
anomalies is with broad horizontal test excavations, but because of the limitations in
the scope of this study, the horizontal testing was limited to a few select anomalies.
Despite these limitations, the answer to the question posed above is a still a
resounding yes. At 41CV984, the GPR survey revealed an idealized signature of a small
burned rock mound, and archeological testing confirmed that the Feature 2 mound
consists of a ring of dense rocks surrounding one central earth oven pit. This mound
fits Black and Creel’s (1997:295) model of a “classic central Texas burned rock midden”
defined as “circular, mounded accumulation…having a basic annular (concentric)
morphology—a dense ring of rocks surrounding a distinct center.” Since Feature 2 was
obvious from the surface, the survey did not “discover” this burned rock mound. Rather,
the GPR survey revealed the internal structure of the mound, which in turn prompted
a more intensive investigation focused directly on the central earth oven.
In contrast to the known midden at 41CV984, the GPR surveys at 41CV1553
did indeed discover a previously unknown but significant burned rock feature. The
investigation of the large anomaly in the south GPR block started with a shovel test but
was eventually expanded into a large block excavation revealing a small but discrete
burned rock mound with embedded central cooking pit(s). There is no doubt that the
GPR survey detected the buried burned rock mound at 41CV1553, and that its anomaly
signature is generally circular around a central core area. This mound would have been
difficult and time-consuming to locate using traditional archeological search methods,
such as systematic shovel testing across large areas.
The ultimate conclusion drawn from these surveys is that GPR is indeed an
effective technique for finding large-scale cultural features buried in the sandy deposits
at Paluxy sites on Fort Hood. Although this study did not target many of the small GPR
anomalies for ground-truthing, it does suggest that the technique is useful for finding
smaller features at Paluxy sites (see discussion of Feature 7 at 41CV1553 in Chapter
6). From a methodological perspective, we learned that GPR surveying is likely to be
most successful at sites with deep sandy deposits and little or no modern disturbances.

samples analyzed and reported in this study were recovered from 2009 through 2012
by archeologists from Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (PAI), and Texas A&M University
as part of a cultural resources study focusing on recovery of plant remains from earth
ovens and other burned rock features.
The investigated sites and numbers of analyzed samples are summarized in
Table B.1. The sites were investigated by PAI in two phases (Phase I in 2009–2010
and Phase II in 2011–2012), but the flotation and charcoal samples were submitted to
Macrobotanical Analysis in three groups, in 2009, 2010, and 2011–2012. The author
initially submitted a separate draft report to PAI for each of these three groups,1 but
all of the findings and results are incorporated here into this appendix. For analysis
and reporting purposes, the analysis methods and results are presented in the original
analysis groupings. Although the general analytical methods were consistent between
all the years, there are some minor differences in the specific methods used for each
particular analysis group. The total number of samples analyzed and reported is 45
charcoal samples and 79 flotation samples.

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils
sites investigated in 2009
This section details the plant remains recovered from the 2009 investigations of
burned rock features at three Paluxy sites. Thirty-six flotation samples and ten charcoal
samples from sites 41CV984, 41CV1049, and CV1553 were submitted for analysis (see
Table B.1).
Environment and Preservation
The three burned rock middens are on or near outcroppings of Paluxy sands
and so occupy a unique geologic and topographic setting characterized by Cisco and
Wise series soils (Mehalchick et al. 2004:1). Archeological evidence indicates that the
burned rock features at Paluxy sites represent the remains of seasonal occupations used
primarily as plant-processing centers (Mehalchick et al. 2004:209).
Methods
Flotation samples from the Fort Hood burned rock middens were processed at
PAI in a Flote-Tech flotation machine with bottom mesh openings of 1.0 mm. Charcoal
remaining in the flotation heavy fractions was removed. This charcoal was bagged and
labeled separately from the light fraction material, although it was added to the counts
and weights of light fraction material in this report.
Flotation samples were sorted according to standard procedures at the
Macrobotanical Analysis laboratory in Manchaca, Texas (Pearsall 2000). Each flotation
sample was weighed on an Ohaus Scout II 200x0.01-g electronic balance before being
size-sorted through a stack of graduated geologic mesh. Materials that did not pass
through the No. 10 mesh (2 mm) were completely sorted, and all carbonized botanical
remains were counted, weighed, recorded, and labeled. Uncarbonized botanical material
that did not pass through the 2-mm mesh (rootlets and occasionally leaf litter) was
weighed, recorded, and labeled as “contamination.” Materials that fell through the 2-mm
mesh (“residue”) were examined under a stereoscopic microscope at 7–45x magnification
for carbonized botanical remains. Identifiable botanical material other than wood
was removed from residue, counted, weighed, recorded, and labeled. Uncarbonized
macrobotanical remains other than rootlets and leaf litter were recorded on a presence/
absence basis on laboratory forms.
Most plant samples that were not flotation-processed were intended for
radiocarbon dating. These samples were handled only with latex or vinyl gloves, and
contact with paper was avoided. Due to a miscommunication, plant remains removed
from flotation heavy fractions were also treated as potential radiocarbon samples in the
laboratory, and these may also be appropriate for radiocarbon dating. As noted above,
they are curated in separate bags from the light fraction material.
Plant samples that were not flotation processed were not sieved in the laboratory.
Rather, any rootlets and chunks of soil were removed by hand. When loose soil was
encountered, samples were placed on a No. 10 mesh (2 mm), and the soil that fell through
the mesh was scanned for plant material before being discarded. Plant material recovered
from nonflotation samples (wood charcoal, at these sites) was identified, counted, weighed,
and labeled in the same manner as material from flotation samples.

Appendix B
Identification was attempted for 20 randomly selected wood charcoal specimens
from each flotation sample and each carbon sample. Wood charcoal fragments were
snapped to reveal a transverse section and examined under a stereoscopic microscope
at 28–180x magnification. When necessary, tangential or radial sections were examined
for ray seriation, presence of spiral thickenings, types and sizes of intervessel pitting,
and other minute characteristics that can only be seen at the higher magnifications of
this range.
Botanical materials were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level by
comparison to materials in the Macrobotanical Analysis comparative collection and
through the use of standard reference works (e.g., Core et al. 1979; Davis 1993; Hoadley
1990; Martin and Barkley 1961; Panshin and de Zeeuw 1980).
Site 41CV984
Site 41CV984 is on a minor tributary of Cottonwood Creek, which drains north
into Cowhouse Creek, which in turn empties into Belton Lake, a reservoir on the Leon
River. Soil maps of the site area indicate Cisco fine sandy loams (Soil Survey Staff 2009).
The site was described in 1986 as a possible burned rock midden and surrounding burned
rock concentration (THC site form 1/20/1986). The survey produced a Frio dart point
base, suggesting a Transitional Archaic occupation (Turner and Hester 1999). The 2009
investigations by PAI focused on testing ground-penetrating radar (GPR) anomolies
thought to be possible burned rock features (see Chapter 4). Five radiocarbon dates now
indicate this site was occupied as early as 915 b.c. and as late as a.d. 1290 (see Table 3.3).
Site 41CV1049
Site 41CV1049 is a burned rock midden less than 500 m northwest of 41CV984.
The site lies on a gentle, northeast-facing slope above Cottonwood Creek (THC site form
5/22/1985). Soils are Cisco fine sandy loams, reddish-brown sandy clay loam, and black
clay loam (Soil Survey Staff 2009; THC site form 5/22/1985). The 2009 investigations by
PAI examined multiple burned rock features at this site (see Chapter 5). Four radiocarbon
dates now indicate site occupations spanning from a.d. 20 to 640 in the Late Prehistoric
period (see Table 3.3).
Site 41CV1553
Site 41CV1553 is located on a tributary of Stampede Creek, which drains into
Cowhouse Creek from the north just upstream of Cottonwood Creek. Although soil maps
indicate clay loams, soils reported at the site are sands and sandy loams (Soil Survey
Staff 2009; THC site form, undated). A sketch map drawn by Charles Frederick notes
live oaks, deciduous oaks, and juniper in the area (THC site form, 3/5/1993). An Ensor
point recovered during the survey suggests a Transitional Archaic occupation (THC
site form, undated; Turner and Hester 1999). The 2009 work focused on several burned
rock features and a small burned rock mound found in the GPR survey (see Chapter
6). Ten radiocarbon dates now indicate that the site occupations spanned from 350 b.c.
to a.d. 687, while one date could represent modern charcoal or indicate an occupations
sometime after a.d. 1489 (see Table 3.3, Table 6.3, and Figure 6.13).

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils
Although charcoal itself is chemically stable and has high preservation
potential, the absence or poor preservation of charcoal in alkaline environments
such as Herculaneum and the River Aisne area of northern France has long puzzled
archeologists (Braadbaart et al. 2009). Recent experiments have investigated the effects
of alkaline environments on charcoal (Braadbaart et al. 2009). The interactions between
temperature of carbonization, soil permeability, density, and wood charcoal anatomy are
complex. In brief, however, chemically mediated changes in macromolecular structure
contribute to the physical processes that cause fragmentation of charcoal. Alkaline
environments and sandy soils, both characteristic of Paluxy sites in the Fort Hood area,
are among the factors that contribute to charcoal fragmentation (Braadbaart et al.
2009). For this reason, recognizable charcoal may be underrepresented in the burned
rock middens in central Texas.
Results
Data on carbonized plant parts recovered from sites 41CV984, 41CV1049, and
41CV1553 are given in Table B.2.
Uncarbonized Plants
In addition to rootlets and leaf litter, 10 taxa of uncarbonized seeds were
recovered from flotation samples at 41CV1553 (Table B.3). Site 41CV1049 yielded 6 taxa
of uncarbonized seeds in addition to the rootlets and leaf litter (Table B.4). The seeds
belong to weedy taxa common in the area today and are interpreted here as modern seed
rain. Wood and root fragments of juniper and a wild garlic bulbil were also recovered
from 41CV1553 in uncarbonized form. As discussed below, juniper and wild onion were
also recovered from the site in carbonized form. The uncarbonized forms do not represent
ancient plants, as the carbonized forms do, but rather the continuation of conditions
favored by these plants in the area since the time of site occupation.
Wood
Wood charcoal at 41CV1553 consists of the same woody plants noted by Charles
Frederick on his 1993 sketch map of 41CV1553: live oak, deciduous oaks, and juniper
(Figure B.1). Both red and white groups of deciduous oaks are represented. Three
fragments of juniper from Feature 7 at 41CV1553 are semicarbonized and may represent
a recent burning event. The oaks recovered at 41CV1553 correspond to the four species
of oak present at Paluxy sites in the Fort Hood area today. These are post oak (Quercus
stellata, a white oak), Plateau live oak (Q. fusiformis, a live oak), blackjack oak, and
Texas red oak (Q. marlandica and Q. buckleyi respectively, both red oaks) (Mehalchick
et al. 2004:178). Oaks at 41CV1049 were identifiable only as white and live oaks, but
the assemblage was small (24 from flotation and 33 hand-collected), and 25 percent
of the flotation-recovered wood charcoal was unidentifiable (see Figure B.1). The lone
fragment of wood from 41CV984 was an oak of indeterminable type.
Geophytes
Other than wood charcoal, underground storage organs were the only type
of carbonized plant recovered from the sites. Two classes of geophytes were present:

bulbs and tubers. Unidentifiable bulb scale
fragments were found at 41CV1553 in
Features 7, 8, 8A, 8B, and 8C and at Site
41CV1049 in Feature 10. Nine genera of
bulbs are known from Fort Hood today,
including wild onion/garlic (Allium spp.)
wild hyacinth (Camassia scilloides), false
garlic (Nothoscordum bivalve), and rain lily
(Cooperia spp.) (Mehalchick 2004:Table 9.3).
Several genera may be represented among the
indeterminable bulb scale fragments at these
sites. A more complete bulb fragment from
Feature 8 at Site 41CV1553 was identifiable
to genus: wild onion/garlic (Allium sp.).
A scurfpea (Pediomelum sp.) tuber
fragment was identified from Feature 8A at
41CV553, and a tuber fragment from Feature
10 at 41CV1049 may also be scurfpea. Species
in the scurfpea genus, variously known as
Indian turnip, Indian breadroot, and prairie
potato, were important food plants for historic
Native Americans (Moerman 1998:381–382).
Scurfpea tuber fragments have been identified
from other sites in central and eastern Texas
(Dering 1993; Mehalchick 2004:218–219).

structure of a cross section of the tuber,
including the epidermis. The exterior of the
epidermis is heavily eroded, however. The
flatsedge genus includes important economic
plants such as papyrus (C. papyrus), from which the ancient Egyptians made paper. Some
species of flatsedge have edible tubers that were eaten by historic Native Americans
(Moerman 1998:190), and food uses no doubt account for the presence of flatsedge at
41CV1049. No species of flatsedge is listed among the geophytes at Fort Hood (Mehalchick
2004:Table 9.3), perhaps because the tuberous C. esculentus is not accepted as native
by all authorities (e.g., Mabberly 1987). More widely used American sources do accept
C. esculentum as a native species, and other native Cyperus species have tubers as
well (Diggs et al. 1999; USDA, NCRS 2009). Harold Beaty documented eight species
of flatsedge in western Bell County, including the tuberous C. esculentus, C. odoratus,
and C. rotundus, and it is likely that several species occur at Fort Hood (Beaty 1978).

Discussion
To the author’s knowledge, flatsedge has not been previously reported from an
archeological site in Texas, even as a tentative identification. In other respects, however,
the macrobotanical findings from these three Paluxy sites are consistent with those at
previously investigated burned rock middens in central Texas. Carbonized geophytes
are present but not common at these sites, and fuel wood consists primarily of oak. All
identifiable wood charcoal at 41ME147, on the southeastern edge of the Edwards Plateau,
is live oak. At the Firebreak site (41CV595), which lies across Stampede Creek from
41CV1553, oak wood constitutes 68.7 percent of the assemblage (Mehalchick et al. 2004).
At 41CV1553, oak makes up 83.0 percent of the 271 identifiable specimens. Seventeen
wood taxa were identified in the three Paluxy sites investigated by Phil Dering, as
opposed to only four at the sites in the current study (Dering 2004:Table B.2). Dering
also identified pecan and acorn nutshell in addition to wood and geophytes. The sample
size was larger in that investigation, however, with 75 samples analyzed, compared with
36 here. (See Chapter 6 in Acuña [2006] for a recent review of archeological evidence
of geophytes in Texas.)
The total weight of carbonized plants from the three sites investigated here
amounts to slightly more than 5 g of charcoal—hardly an impressive figure considering
how important plant processing may have been at burned rock sites in central Texas.
The sandy, alkaline environments in which the sites are situated likely played a major
role in reducing the botanical assemblage. In light of the difficulties associated with
botanical preservation, it is notable to have four woods and two classes of geophytes
represented in this study, with three geophytes identifiable to genus.
sites investigated in 2010
The 2010 investigations included a second round of archeology work at 41CV984
and an investigation at newly discovered Gully Mouth site, 41CV1657. Archeobotanical
samples were recovered from both sites (see Table B.1). Site 41CV984 lies near a
normally dry tributary of Cottonwood Creek on an outcropping of Paluxy sands. The
collection and cooking of geophytes are often primary activities in such settings (Acuña
2006; Mehalchick et al. 2004). The Gully Mouth site is located nearby on a tributary of
Cottonwood Creek, but it is not a Paluxy site. The burned rock features investigated
there were buried in alluvial deposits, and four radiocarbon assays date the cultural
activities to the Late Prehistoric Austin phase (see Table 3.3 and Chapter 8).
Six flotation samples from the Gully Mouth site were submitted for identification
and analysis of botanical macroremains. Half of the Gully Mouth samples are from
Feature 3, with the other three samples representing Features 1, 2, and 4. Sample volume
ranged from 3 to 7 liters, for a total of 33 liters from the site. Five carbon samples and
10 flotation samples from Feature 4 at 41CV984 were submitted. The flotation samples
represent 122.5 liters of fill from Feature 4.
Site Setting
The two sites are in the Lampassas Cut Plain, a vegetation area grouped
variously with the Edwards Plateau (Riskind and Diamond 1988) or the Cross Timbers

Appendix B
(Diggs et al. 1999; Gould 1962). A mosaic of grasslands and woodlands characterizes the
vegetation. Grasslands are mixed prairie, with tall, medium and short grasses present.
Upland trees and shrubs typically grow in mottes of oaks, juniper, and agarito. Yaupon,
elbowbush, persimmon, and sumac are common small trees and shrubs. Moister areas
along streams and mesic slopes support trees such as sycamore, pecan, hackberry and
elm (Beaty 1978; Riskind and Diamond 1988).
Charcoal preservation in central Texas is typically poor. Although charcoal
itself is chemically stable and has high preservation potential, the absence or poor
preservation of charcoal in similar alkaline environments such as Herculaneum and
the River Aisne area of northern France has long puzzled archeologists (Braadbaart
et al. 2009). Recent experiments have investigated the effects of alkaline environments
on charcoal (Braadbaart et al. 2009). Although the interactions between temperature
of carbonization, soil permeability, density, and wood charcoal anatomy are complex,
it is clear that chemically mediated changes in macromolecular structure contribute
to the physical processes that cause fragmentation of charcoal. Alkaline environments
and sandy soils, both characteristic of Paluxy sites in the Fort Hood area, are among
the factors that contribute to charcoal fragmentation (Braadbaart et al. 2009). For this
reason, recognizable charcoal may be underrepresented in the burned rock middens in
central Texas.
Methods
Flotation samples from the Fort Hood sites were processed at Prewitt and
Associates, Inc., in a Flote-Tech flotation machine with bottom mesh openings of 1.0 mm.
Charcoal remaining in the flotation heavy fractions was removed and bagged and labeled
separately from the light fraction material, although it has been added to the counts
and weights of light fraction material in this report.
Flotation samples were sorted according to standard procedures (Pearsall 2000).
Each sample was weighed on an Ohaus Scout II 200x0.01-g electronic balance before
being size-sorted through a stack of graduated geologic mesh. Materials that did not pass
through the No. 10 mesh (2-mm square openings) were completely sorted. Carbonized
botanical remains were counted, weighed, recorded, and labeled. Contamination was
weighted, recorded, and labeled but not counted. Materials that fell through the 2-mm
mesh (“residue”) were examined under a stereoscopic microscope at 7–45x magnification
for carbonized botanical remains. Identifiable material other than wood charcoal
was removed from residue, counted, weighed, recorded, and labeled. Uncarbonized
macrobotanical remains were recorded on a presence/absence basis on laboratory forms.
For each flotation sample, wood charcoal fragments were selected at random
from those larger than 2 mm, with large and small fragments chosen alternately. If
fewer than 20 fragments larger than 2 mm were present, identification was attempted
on the next-largest fragments until either 20 fragments had been identified or the
remaining fragments were too small for identification. Fragments were snapped to reveal
a clean transverse section and examined under a stereoscopic microscope at 28–180x
magnification. When necessary, tangential or radial sections were examined for ray

seriation, presence of spiral thickenings, types and sizes of intervessel pitting, and other
minute characteristics that can only be seen at the higher magnifications of this range.
Botanical materials were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level
by comparison to materials in the Macrobotanical Analysis comparative collection
and through the use of standard reference works (e.g., Core et al. 1979; Davis 1993;
Hoadley 1990; Martin and Barkley 1961; Musil 1963; Panshin and de Zeeuw 1980).
Plant nomenclature follows that of the USDA PLANTS database (USDA, NRCS 2010).
Carbon samples were collected in the field from site 41CV984 according to
Prewitt and Associates, Inc., protocols for radiocarbon dating. In the laboratory, these
samples were handled only with latex gloves, and contact with paper was avoided.
Results
Macrobotanical remains from the Gully Mouth site are given in by counts and
weights in Table B.5. For 41CV984, Table B.6 summarizes the noncarbonized seeds and
seed pods, and Table B.7 summarizes the carbonized plant remains by counts and weights.

Uncarbonized Plant Remains
Most uncarbonized plant remains at the two sites are rootlets that are clearly
modern and not reported here. Only a single taxon of uncarbonized seed was recovered
from Gullymouth, a croton seed in the largest flotation sample (see Table B.5). The 10
flotation samples from 41CV984 included 12 taxa of seeds or seed pods, including croton
(see Table B.6). Uncarbonized seeds are a common occurrence at most archeological
sites, but they are usually seeds of modern plants that have made their way into the soil
either through their own dispersal mechanisms or by faunalturbation, floralturbation,
or argilliturbation (Bryant 1985:51–52; Keepax 1977; Miksicek 1987:231–232). In all
except the driest areas of North America, uncarbonized plant material at open-air sites
can be assumed to be of modern origin unless compelling evidence suggests otherwise
(Lopinot and Brussell 1982; Miksicek 1987:231). Site 41CV984 and the Gulllymouth
site have offered no such evidence, and the seeds are interpreted as modern seed rain.
Further discussion of the plant remains concerns carbonized plants only.
Carbonized Plant Remains from 41CV1657
Wood charcoal was the only plant part identified in carbonized form at the
Gully Mouth site (see Table B.5). All wood charcoal was oak genus (Quercus sp.), but
at least three species were represented. Plateau live oak (Quercus fusiformis), which
can be identified to species on the basis of its diffuse-porous anatomy, was present,
as were members of both white and red oak groups. Common red group oaks in the
area today include Texas red oak, Shumard oak, and Bigelow oak (Quercus. buckleyi,
Q. shumardii, and Q. sinnuata). Common white group oaks are chinkapin oak and post
oak (Q. muehlenbergii and Q. stellata). Bur oaks (Q. macrocarpa, another white group

oak) may have been available in more mesic situations along stream bottoms and slower
slopes (Beaty 1978; Diggs et al. 1999).
Feature 3 at the Gully Mouth is notable for its high density of carbonized plant
remains (2.24 g/l). As noted above, the environment of central Texas is not conducive to
the preservation of charcoal. The charcoal density in other features at the site (0.004
g/l to 0.02 g/l) and at 41CV984 (0.03 g/l) is more typical of the region.
Carbonized Plant Remains from 41CV984
The three taxa of wood identified at Gully Mouth site were also present at
41CV984: plateau live oak, white group oak, and red group oak (see Table B.7). As at
Gully Mouth, oaks were the only woods recovered from the site. The oaks recovered
from Site 41CV984 correspond to the four species of oak present at Paluxy sites in the
Fort Hood area today. These are post oak (Quercus stellata, a white oak), Plateau live
oak (Q. fusiformis, a live oak), blackjack oak and Texas red oak (Q. marlandica and
Q. buckleyi respectively, both red oaks) (Mehalchick et al. 2004:178).
In addition to wood charcoal, 41CV984 also yielded remains of food plants, which
were absent at Gullymouth. Three genera of bulbs (Allium, Nothoscordum and Camassia)
and some tuber fragments were recovered from Feature 4. The two small tuber fragments
from Level 5 probably represent one or more of the tubers identified from other sites
in central Texas: scurfpea (Pediomelum sp.), groundnut (Apios americana), or flatsedge
(Cyperus sp.)2 (Mehalchick et al. 2004). Flatsedge seeds were noted in three of the
flotation samples from 41CV984, reflecting its presence at the site in modern times. All
three genera of bulbs at 41CV984 may also be found in the site area today (Beaty 1978;
Mehalchick et al. 2004). Two species of Allium, variously called wild onion or wild garlic,
occur in central Texas (A. canadense and A. drummondii). Both prefer sandy soils and
open woods (Diggs et al. 1999). Nothoscordum bivalve, called crow-poison or false wild
garlic, is very similar in appearance to wild onion but lacks the characteristic onion smell.
It is common in disturbed areas. Although its common name may raise concerns about
toxicity, cooked crow-poison bulbs are edible. Camas, called wild hyacinth (Camassia
scilloides), is found in open woodlands (Diggs et al. 1999). Like onions and crow-poison,
it is edible when cooked and has a long history of consumption by Native Americans.
Discussion
The wood charcoal assemblages at the Gully Mouth site and 41CV984 are
dominated by oaks, as is typical of burned rock features in central Texas (Bush 2010;
Mehalchick et al. 2004; see Table B.2). Oaks of all species are dense woods that burn hot,
producing superior coals with few sparks and little smoke. The wood charcoal represents
fuel resources that would likely have been available in the immediate area of the sites.
Geophytes were identified only from 41CV984, which is a Paluxy site that has
yielded other archeological evidence of geophyte processing. Three genera of bulbs and
two small, indeterminable tuber fragments were recovered.

As described in a previous section of this report, flatsedge was first identified at
41CV1049 in 2009.

Appendix B
Sites investigated in 2011–2012
This section details the plant remains recovered from four Coryell County sites
investigated in 2011–2012. All of these sites are situated in the Paluxy deposits where
outcropping sands provided unique opportunities for geophyte exploitation (Mehalchick
et al. 2004). Archeological evidence indicates that the burned rock features at Paluxy
sites represent the remains of seasonal occupations used primarily as plant-processing
centers, and the use of earth ovens is well documented at these sites (Mehalchick et al.
2004:209).
Forty-three flotation samples and 31 charcoal samples were collected and sent to
Macrobotanical Analysis in Manchaca, Texas. To ensure that funds expended in analysis
would produce positive data, all samples underwent initial scanning to determine
whether charcoal was present. Only those samples that appeared to contain charcoal
were selected for further analysis. In all, 27 flotation samples and 26 charcoal samples
were selected for analysis (see Table B.1).
Environment and Preservation
The four sites reported here are within a 6-km area in the Cowhouse Creek
drainage. Site 41CV1104 is located on the first terrace of Cowhouse Creek, while sites
41CV947 and 41CV1553 are Paluxy sites located near tributaries that drain into
Cowhouse Creek from the north. Site 41CV594 is the farthest from water, lying on a
knoll and saddle 320 m from a secondary, southern tributary of Cowhouse Creek (THC
Site Files 5/14/1985).
The four sites are in the Lampassas Cut Plain, a vegetation area grouped
variously with the Edwards Plateau (Riskind and Diamond 1988) or the Cross Timbers
(Diggs et al. 1999; Gould 1962). A mosaic of grasslands and woodlands characterizes
the vegetation. Grasslands are mixed prairie, with tall, medium, and short grasses
present. Upland trees and shrubs typically grow in mottes of oaks (Quercus spp.), juniper
(Juniperus spp.), and agarito (Mahonia trifoliata). A sketch map drawn by Charles
Frederick notes live oaks, deciduous oaks, and juniper in the area of 41CV1553 (THC
Site Files, 3/5/1993). Yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), elbowbush (Forestiera pubescens), Texas
persimmon (Diospyros texana), and sumac (Rhus spp.) are common small trees and
shrubs. Moister areas along streams and mesic slopes support trees such as sycamore
(Platanus occidentalis), pecan (Carya illinoinensis), hackberry (Celtis spp.), and elm
(Ulmus spp.) (Beaty 1978; Riskind and Diamond 1988). Areas impacted by tank traffic
at Fort Hood may differ substantially from undisturbed areas. Specifically, areas
directly impacted by tanks see an abundance of skunkbush sumac (Rhus aromatica)
in forest understories, a dearth of other small woody plants, and the growth of lessdesirable annuals such as ragweed (Ambrosia spp.), three-awn (Aristida spp.), cudweed
(Antennaria spp.), and plantain (Plantago spp.), at the expense of sedges (Cyperus spp.)
and grama grasses (Bouteloua spp.) (Johnson 1982).
Although charcoal itself is chemically stable and has high preservation
potential, the absence or poor preservation of charcoal in alkaline environments
such as Herculaneum and the River Aisne area of northern France has long puzzled
archeologists (Braadbaart et al. 2009). Recent experiments investigating the effects

461

462

Earth Ovens, Geophytes, and Microfossils
of alkaline environments on charcoal are reported by Braadbaart et al. (2009). The
interactions between temperature of carbonization, soil permeability, density, and
wood charcoal anatomy are complex. In brief, however, chemically mediated changes in
macromolecular structure contribute to the physical processes that cause fragmentation
of charcoal. Alkaline environments and sandy soils, both characteristic of Paluxy sites
in the Fort Hood area, are among the factors that contribute to charcoal fragmentation.
For this reason, recognizable charcoal is likely to be underrepresented in the burned
rock middens in central Texas.
Methods
Flotation samples from the 2011–2012 Fort Hood sites were processed at Prewitt
and Associates, Inc., in a Flote-Tech flotation machine with bottom mesh openings of
1.0 mm. Charcoal remaining in the flotation heavy fractions was removed and added
to the light fractions at Prewitt and Associates, Inc.
Flotation samples were sorted according to standard procedures at the
Macrobotanical Analysis laboratory in Manchaca, Texas (Pearsall 2000). Each flotation
sample was weighed on an Ohaus Scout II 200x0.01-g electronic balance before being
size-sorted through a stack of graduated geologic mesh. Materials that did not pass
through the No. 10 mesh (2 mm) were completely sorted under a Micros stereozoom
microscope at 7–45x, and all carbonized botanical remains were counted, weighed,
recorded, and labeled. Uncarbonized botanical materials that did not pass through the
2-mm mesh (rootlets and occasionally leaf litter) were weighed, recorded, and labeled as
“contamination.” Materials that fell through the 2-mm mesh (“residue”) were examined
for carbonized botanical remains not previously identified in the larger size fraction.
Carbonized botanical material from the residue not previously identified in the larger
size fraction was counted, weighed, recorded, and labeled. Uncarbonized macrobotanical
remains other than rootlets were recorded on a presence/absence basis on laboratory
forms.
Carbon samples were subject to full radiocarbon protocols in the laboratory. The
samples were sorted on freshly washed glassware, handled only with latex gloves or
metal forceps, and contact with paper was avoided. Writing instruments used in data
entry were plastic mechanical pencils.
Carbon samples were not routinely sieved in the laboratory. Rather, any rootlets
and chunks of soil were removed by hand. When loose soil was encountered, samples
were placed on a No. 10 mesh (2 mm), and the soil that fell through the mesh was
scanned for plant material, weighed, labeled and returned to Prewitt and Associates
for curation or discard.
Identification was attempted for all carbon samples and 20 randomly selected
wood charcoal specimens from each flotation sample. When fewer than 20 fragments
larger than 2 mm were present, identification was attempted for progressively smaller
fragments taken from the residue smaller than 2 mm until identification became
impractical or until 20 fragments were identified. Wood charcoal fragments were snapped
to reveal a transverse section and examined under a stereoscopic microscope at 28–180x
magnification. When necessary, tangential or radial sections were examined for ray

seriation, presence of spiral thickenings, types and sizes of intervessel pitting, and other
minute characteristics that can only be seen at the higher magnifications of this range.
Botanical materials were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level by
comparison to materials in the Macrobotanical Analysis comparative collection and
through the use of standard reference works (e.g., Core et al. 1979; Davis 1993; Hoadley
1990; Martin and Barkley 1961; Panshin and de Zeeuw 1980). Plant nomenclature
follows the USDA PLANTS database (USDA, NRCS 2012).
Results
The numbers and types of samples collected and processed from the four sites
are summarized in Table B.8. Data on carbonized plant parts recovered by flotation are
presented in Tables B.9–B.13, and data on uncarbonized plant parts from flotation are
presented in Table B.14. Finally, Table B.15 presents the plant identification data for
individually collected carbonized samples.

Site 41CV594
Site 41CV594 is a Paluxy site where intensive Phase II investigations focused
on a large burned rock mound (Feature 2) and the internal cooking features within it
(see Chapter 7). Located 320 m from the nearest drainage, prehistoric activities occurred
from 3255 b.c. to at least a.d. 660 (as indicated by five radiocarbon dates; see Table 3.3).
Twenty-one of the 27 collected flotation samples were analyzed and yielded carbonized
plant remains consisting of wood charcoal and geophyte fragments (see Tables B.9 and
B.10).
Identification was attempted for 255 wood charcoal specimens, of which 243 were
identifiable to family or better. Of these, 78.6 percent were oaks, primarily plateau live
oak. Other woods present were yaupon (n = 35), hackberry or hackberry family (n = 16),
and persimmon (n = 1), all upland species that would be expected near the site.
Geophyte remains at 41CV594 consisted of three tuber fragments that could
not be further identified and 28 bulb scale fragments, of which four were identifiable
as camas. The tubers were present in Feature 2G, and the bulbs were recovered from
Features 2C and 2G.

*cf. wood charcoal

Site 41CV947
The Phase II archeological investigations at site 41CV947 focused on several
isolated burned rock features at this Paluxy site (see Chapter 7). This Paluxy site has
occupations spanning from a.d. 90 to 1020, as indicated by four radiocarbon dates (see
Table 3.3). The three flotation samples from 41CV947 yielded wood charcoal, geophyte
fragments and nutshell (see Table B.11). Identification was attempted for 43 wood
charcoal specimens, of which 42 were identifiable to family or better. Nearly all of these
(n = 39) were plateau live oak. The others were white group oak (n = 2) and ash (n = 1).
Geophyte remains consisted of two indeterminable tuber fragments. Unique
among sites examined for this report, 41CV947 produced carbonized nutshell, in the
form of two small pecan fragments. Pecan trees are associated with stream bottoms
and slopes in central Texas (Diggs et al. 1999), making it unlikely that the pecan grew
in the immediate site area.

Site 41CV1104
The Phase II archeological work at 41CV1104 focused on burned rock features
buried in Cowhouse Creek alluvial deposits but exposed in a tank trail (see Chapter
8), and one of the features is radiocarbon dated to 2280–2050 b.c. (see Table 3.3). One
seven-liter flotation sample was analyzed and carbonized wood was the only plant part
recovered (see Table B.12). Of 20 fragments identified, 16 were plateau live oak wood
and four were juniper. Small though it is, the presence of juniper wood charcoal at this
site conforms to expectations that, prior to a.d. 1500, juniper was most likely to occur
in locales along streams and in canyons that offered some degree of protection from fire.
In contrast, no juniper was identified among the 255 wood charcoal specimens from the
Paluxy site 41CV594.
Site 41CV1553
The Phase II archeological investigations at 41CV1553 examined a burned rock
mound and isolated burned rock feature (see Chapter 6), and the site occupations are
well dated to 180 b.c. to a.d. 1300 (see Table 3.2). Only two flotation samples from two
different features were analyzed, but they represent a very respectable 110 liters of
feature fill. Plant remains recovered consisted of wood charcoal and bulb scale fragments
(see Table B.13).
Of the 40 wood charcoal fragments identified, 25 were plateau live oak and the
remainder were red group oak (n = 11), unspecifiable oak (n = 1), and juniper (n = 3).
The juniper many have come from the slopes of the tributary stream on which the site
is located. Seven bulb scales were recovered, of which two could be identified as camas.
Previous flotation samples from the site recovered wood charcoal that was also
overwhelmingly oak with some juniper. Eleven bulb scales were recovered, with one
identified as wild onion/garlic. A tuber fragment identified as scurfpea (Pediomelum sp.)
was also recovered in the earlier investigations.
Seed Rain and Leaf Litter from Flotation
Twenty-eight taxa of uncarbonized seeds, an uncarbonized tuber, and two species
of identifiable leaves were recovered from flotation samples at the four sites (see Table
B.14). The seeds belong to herbaceous taxa common in the area today and are interpreted
here as modern seed rain. No carbonized seeds were recovered from any of the sites. The
uncarbonized tuber and leaves (of persimmon and cedar elm) represent plants or plant
parts that were also recovered in carbonized form. The uncarbonized tuber and leaves
do not represent ancient plants, as the carbonized forms of these taxa do, but rather
the continuation of conditions favored by these plants since the ancient occupations.
Carbon Samples
Plant material in the 26 samples taken for possible radiocarbon dating consisted
entirely of wood charcoal (see Table B.15). Like wood charcoal recovered through flotation
processing, most of it was plateau live oak. Red group oak and unspecifiable oak were
also represented in the samples, as was a fragment of ash wood charcoal from Feature

Appendix B
2 at 41CV594. Ash was not identified among the flotation samples at 41CV594, so the
carbon sample identification adds an additional wood type to that site.
Discussion
Wood charcoal from the sites reported here, where burned rock middens are
the most prominent features, is interpreted as fuel wood. Oaks would have been the
most common upland trees at Fort Hood for much of the Holocene, although they share
dominance with junipers today (Beaty 1978; Riskind and Diamond 1988). Oaks also make
excellent fuel for earth ovens, since they burn at high heat, produce excellent, long-lasting
coals, and rarely throw sparks. The dominance of oak woods in the archaeological record
is consistent both with the probable ancient landscape and with ethnohistorical sources
that indicate Native Americans were well aware of the burning properties of different
woods and exploited them accordingly (e.g., Gilmore 1933:139; Zigmond 1981:57).
The combination of wood charcoal and geophyte fragments indicates an ancient
tradition of cooking bulbs in earth ovens that is now well established in Texas (Acuña
2006; Dering 1999, 2002; Gadus et al. 2006; Mehalchick et al. 2004; Mehalchick and
Kibler 2008; Thoms 2008, 2009). The particular bulbs that could be identified here are
all camas, but onion, false garlic, and rain lily have also been recovered in central Texas
(Mehalchick et al. 2004:256). Tubers available to Archaic and Late Prehistoric foragers at
Fort Hood would have included groundnut (Apios americana), flat sedge (Cyperus spp.),
winecup (Callirhoe spp.), scurfpea (Pediomelum spp.) and—in wetter locations—cattail
(Typha spp.). Although their nutritional profile is improved by cooking (Wandsnider
1997), the available tubers can also be eaten raw, which may account for their lower
numbers among the carbonized plant remains. Nonetheless, the Paluxy sands in the
area would have made exploitation of all geophytes easier, with quicker, easier digging,
increasing the net calories gained per hour of labor.
Geophytes are clearly present at the sites, but they are neither ubiquitous nor
abundant in the flotation samples. The smallest single flotation sample from which a
geophyte fragment was recovered was 14 liters. A full 253 liters were processed from the
feature that produced the largest number of bulb scale fragment, Feature 2C at 41CV594.
The 24 fragments in Feature 2C average out to less than one bulb scale fragment per
10 liters of feature fill, and the overall recovery for the four sites was one bulb scale
fragment per 19.4 liters of feature fill. Future investigations for which geophyte recovery
may be important should plan intensive flotation sampling accordingly.

Inventory of Starch
Granules Recovered from
Microfossil Samples from
Six Prehistoric Sites at Fort
Hood, Texas

Based on original data
compiled by Andrew R.
Laurence, May 2013

Appendix C
INTRODUCTION
For this Fort Hood archeological research project, microfossil samples were
extracted from artifacts and samples in the curated collections at Fort Hood and from
samples recovered from six prehistoric archeological sites investigated from 2010 through
2012. The tables in this appendix summarize the microfossil data.
In the initial pilot study, microfossils were extracted from stone tools, fire-cracked
rocks, feature sediment samples, and nonfeature and noncultural sediment samples that
were recovered during previous excavations at three prehistoric Paluxy sites at Fort
Hood (41CV1049, 41CV1553, and 41CV595, the Firebreak site). Table C.1 summarizes
these curated samples. The positive results in the pilot study led to a more intensive
sampling effort, and microfossil samples were taken from many cultural features at
four Paluxy and two alluvial sites at Fort Hood. Table C.2 summarizes the analyzed
microfossil samples recovered from the six investigated sites.
