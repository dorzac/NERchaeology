ABSTRACT
An intensive archaeological survey was undertaken in May, 2007 by American
Archaeology Group LLC (AAG) for Habitat for Humanity of Montgomery County,
Texas. The investigation covered an area of approximately 36 acres on the site of a
proposed housing development. Funding for the development is provided by the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Fieldwork was conducted
pursuant to 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966. Michael R.
Bradle was the Principal Investigator. John Griggs, Ph.D., Project Archaeologist,
provided assistance with fieldwork. A pedestrian survey was performed though surface
visibility was minimal. Subsurface testing for buried cultural remains was accomplished
by means of 24 mechanical auger tests. No historic or prehistoric cultural remains were
encountered during the survey. Based on the results of the survey, AAG recommends
that construction of the housing development be allowed to proceed as planned. No
artifacts were collected; therefore, no curation was made.

INTRODUCTION
Habitat for Humanity of Montgomery County plans to construct a housing
development in the City of Conroe, Texas (Figure 1). Because the project involves federal
funding, permitting approval is subject to federal regulations governing the protection of
cultural resources. Specifically, Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA) of 1966 requires that all federally funded projects must be reviewed for potential
impacts to cultural resources. State Historic Preservation Officers (SHPOs) participate in
the review process. In Texas the SHPO is the executive director of the Texas Historical
Commission (THC).
Section 106 of the NHPA implies that project areas must be surveyed
archaeologically to determine if cultural remains are present. In their efforts to comply with
NHPA regulations, Habitat for Humanity retained American Archaeology Group LLC to
conduct the required survey. Fieldwork was conducted in May, 2007 and included
pedestrian survey and auger testing. No historic or prehistoric cultural remains were
detected within the project area.
This report provides archaeological and historical information relevant to the project
and describes the implementation and results of fieldwork. Based on the negative results of
the investigation, it is recommended that construction of the proposed housing project be
allowed to proceed.

ENVIROMENTAL SETTING
Project Area Location and Description
The project area covers approximately 36 acres on the west bank of Stewarts Creek
in southeast Conroe, Montgomery County, Texas (Figure 2). At present the area is covered
by young forest vegetation with dense underbrush. Elevations in the project area range from
approximately 180 feet above mean sea level (amsl) along the western boundary to 150 feet
amsl at Stewarts Creek. UTM coordinates for the approximate center of the project area are
15 R 265653 E 3354075 N.

Figure 2: Maps showing location of project area (adapted from USGS 1958).
Soils
Two soils are present in the project area: Conroe loamy fine sand, 0 to 5 percent
slope (CoC), and Bibb soils, frequently flooded (Bb) (Figure 3; NRCS 2007).
Conroe loamy fine sand is a nearly level to gently sloping soil that occurs along
ridges and slopes. The representative profile of this soil is as follows: A1 horizon, 0-3
inches, grayish-brown (10YR5/2) loamy fine sand; A2 horizon, 3-24 inches, light
yellowish-brown (10YR6/4) loamy fine sand; B1t, 24-27 inches, yellowish-brown
(10YR5/8) sandy clay loam; B21t, 27-39 inches, yellowish-brown (10YR5/8) clay; and
B22t, 39-54 inches, coarse mottled red clay (10R4/6) (McClintock et al. 1972:12).

Bibb series soils are poorly drained loamy soils with slopes of less than 1 percent.
They are situated primarily on flood plains and occur along stream channels and between
levees and uplands. The representative profile of Bibbs series soils consists of a surface
layer of grayish-brown very fine sandy loam (10YR5/2), about 10 inches thick, underlain
by about 10 inches of grayish-brown very fine sandy loam (10YR5/2) and, below that,
approximately 43 inches of gray very fine sandy loam (10YR5/1) (McClintock et al.
1972:8-9).

USGS 1958).
Regional Environment
The project area is located in Montgomery County in southeast Texas. The
county covers approximately 1,047 square miles (2712 square kilometers) of flat to
gently rolling terrain in the San Jacinto River basin and lies at the western border of the
Piney Woods ecoregion. The characteristic flora, fauna and environmental conditions of
this region extend throughout east Texas and into Louisiana and Arkansas (Figure 4;
Gould 1975; Long 2007).

Vegetation
Prior to Anglo settlement, the Montgomery County area was dominated by mature
forest vegetation with three species of pine - longleaf, shortleaf and loblolly – and a
variety of other trees including hickory, maple, sweet and black gum, oak and magnolia
(Long 2007; McMahan et al. 1984). Today, remaining forests are fragmented and differ
considerably in terms species composition from those present before logging became a
leading industry in the county in the latter half of the nineteenth century (Johnson 1914).
Forest composition continues to be altered by urban expansion and fire suppression
practices (WWF 2007). Managed pine plantations (predominantly loblolly and shortleaf)
are now widespread and large tracts of logged land are covered by young forest
vegetation and grasslands of Virginia wildrye, blackseed needlegrass and purpletop
(Figure 5; Long 2007; McMahan et al. 1984).

Fauna
Wildlife is abundant in Montgomery County. Native mammals include whitetailed deer, bobcats, coyotes, nine-banded armadillos, red and grey foxes, rabbits, eastern
gray and fox squirrels, opossums, gophers, skunks and mice. Prior to Anglo settlement,
black bears and buffalo were also present. Reptiles in Montgomery County include
alligators and numerous species of snakes including the venomous copperhead,
cottonmouth, coral snake and rattlesnake (Long 2007).
Climate
Montgomery County has a subtropical humid climate, with warm summers and
mild winters. The average annual rainfall is 47.44 inches (120.5 centimeters) and the
average annual temperature is 68° F. In January the average low temperature is 39° F
and the average high is 61° F. In July the average low and high temperatures are 72° F
and 95° F, respectively (Long 2007).

ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
The history of human settlement in Texas spans over 11,000 years. A
chronological framework developed by archaeologists for the interpretation of Texas
history comprises five general periods whose boundaries correspond to significant
cultural and social developments in the region (Nunley 1989:37-46). These periods and
their approximate temporal spans are as follows: 1) Paleoindian (11,500- 8500 before
present [hereafter B.P.]); 2) Archaic (8500-2000 B.P.); 3) Late Prehistoric (1200 B.P. to
A.D. 1450); 4) Protohistoric (A.D. 1450-1650); and 5) Historic (A.D. 1650-1940s). This
section summarizes the defining characteristics of these periods as an introduction to the
following section which contains archaeological and historical information relating to
Montgomery County.
The Paleoindian period begins during the last Glacial and continues into the early
Holocene. The earliest confirmed Paleoindian populations in Texas were small, highly
mobile bands of hunters armed with distinctive fluted Clovis projectile points who
pursued large, late Pleistocene mammals, most notably mammoths (Surovell 2000;
Turner and Hester 1985; Waguespack and Surovell 2003). Later Paleoindian populations
developed new forms of projectile points and refined their hunting strategies in response
to environmental factors such as the extinction of the mammoth and other mega
mammals. Yet despite these adaptations, they maintained a life way more like that of
their predecessors than that of later Archaic populations.
The complete demise of the Pleistocene big-game animals and climate change
accompanying the onset of the Holocene are linked to shifts in stone tool technology,
subsistence pursuits and settlement patterns that define the Archaic period. The
Paleoindian-Archaic transition, like those between succeeding periods, occurred
gradually. As the Pleistocene mega mammals begin to vanish, indigenous populations
focused on smaller game and increased their reliance on local plant foods. With changes
in subsistence came new and more diverse stone toolkits and an increase in tools made of
wood and other organic materials. Additionally, settlements became more stable, and
there is evidence for progressively sophisticated cultural practices, such as systematic
burial of the dead (Bousman et al. 2002). Although the Archaic hunting and gathering
lifeway remained relatively stable for thousands of years, archaeologists are able to
define four subperiods (or eras) – Early, Middle, Late and Transitional – based on a dated
sequence of diagnostic projectile points (Turner and Hester 1985:47-49)
The Late Prehistoric period is marked in some areas of Texas, including the
eastern portion of the state, by the introduction of domesticated plant foods such as corn
and beans. Technological innovations such as pottery and the bow and arrow were
widely adopted (Nunley 1989:44; Turner and Hester 1985:82).
The Protohistoric period is associated with an incipient European presence in the
region. Protohistoric indigenous populations were the first described in early
ethnohistoric accounts. Often, these accounts reflected only indirect contact. Items of
European manufacture are occasionally found in Protohistoric sites, though in most cases

7

these items were not acquired directly but through so called down-the-line trading
(Nunley 1989:45).
The Historic period is characterized by a firm historical record and increasing
direct contact between indigenous and European explorers and settlers. Horses introduced
by the Spanish and European material culture led to profound changes in indigenous
cultures. Eventually, Old World diseases, resettlement and warfare claimed up to 95% of
Texas Indians (Klos 2006). The latter part of the Historic period encompasses the AngloEuropean settlement of Texas.
Local Archeological and Historical Context
Over 200 archaeological sties in Montgomery County have been registered with
the Texas Historical Commission (THC). Most of these were located in cultural resource
management surveys around lakes, particularly Lake Conroe, and major waterways in the
southern half of the county (RCRI 2007).
The cultural chronology of what is now Montgomery County begins in the
Paleoindian period. Paleoindian projectile points (San Patrice, Meserve and one
unspecified type) have been recovered at three sites registered with the Texas Historical
Commission (41MQ44, 41MQ46 and 41MQ32) (RCRI 2007). The reported distributions
of several other Paleoindian point types (e.g., Angostura, Clovis, Folsom, Plainview and
Scottsbluff) cover large parts of Texas including Montgomery County (Turner and Hester
1985).
Documented sites with Archaic components in Montgomery County outnumber
the Paleoindian sites by roughly an order of magnitude. Nonetheless, the local Archaic
cultural-chronological sequence remains poorly defined, especially early on in the period.
A handful of Archaic sites in the county can be assigned to the La Harpe Aspect (or La
Harpe Culture) based on the presence of certain diagnostic artifacts such as Gary dart
points and sand tempered pottery (Johnson 2007; RCRI 2007; Shafer 1968). Though
inadequately dated the La Harpe Aspect is estimated to span from 3000 or 2000 BC to
around the time of Christ (Johnson 2007). Sites of the La Harpe Aspect are found
throughout east Texas, with Houston as the southern limit, and into east-central
Oklahoma (Johnson 2007). Defining material traits of the aspect include: “…flexed
burials, pitted manos, expanding stem dart points (early phase), contracting stem dart
points (later phase), plain ceramics (terminal La Harpe Aspect) and various polished and
ground stone artifacts” (Hall 1981:11). Subsistence data available for components of the
Harpe Aspect indicate a reliance on deer and, to a lesser extent, bison, small mammals,
tortoises and shellfish. The processing of plant foods is suggested by manos and milling
slabs (Hall 1981:11).
Approximately two dozen documented sites in Montgomery County contain
remains that have been assigned to the Late Prehistoric period (RCRI 2007). The local
cultural-chronological sequence of the Late Prehistoric period, like that of the Archaic
period, has not been well-defined. Diagnostic materials characteristic of the Galveston

8

Bay Focus (Suhm et al. 1954), such as Goose Creek pottery and Perdiz arrow points,
have been identified at several sites, yet other types of cultural remains associated with
the focus, particularly Scallorn, Alba, Clifton and Fresno arrow points, are not reported in
THC site records for Montgomery County. This may indicate that Late Prehistoric
groups living in what is now Montgomery County were not fully integrated socially and
politically into the Galveston Bay Focus core area, which lies further to the south. Such
is the opinion of Shafer (1968) based on field data from three sites in the Lake Conroe
area:
[T]his locale was a buffer zone between the Caddoan area to the north and
the Galveston Bay area to the south. There appears to be an indigenous
ceramic tradition which never reached the sophistication that developed in
the adjacent Caddoan or Galveston Bay area, though contact with these
areas is evident.
Early ethnohistoric accounts of indigenous populations in east Texas are
consistent with Shafer’s (1968) inference that indigenous groups living in what is now
Montgomery County were in contact with the Caddoes as well as populations to the
south, at least by the Protohistoric period. Chroniclers of the late seventeenth and early
eighteenth centuries describe the indigenous occupants of southeast Texas as Atakapan
(Attacapan) speaking tribes whose range extended from the Gulf Coast in the south to the
Old San Antonio Road in the north (i.e., the stretch of the San Antonio road which
crosses the counties of Madison, Houston, Cherokee, Nacogdoches, San Augustine and
Sabine) (Chipman 1992:21; Hodge 1907; Long 2007). According to Chipman (1992:18)
the Caddoes, who were in constant conflict with most neighboring groups, maintained
“consistently peaceful” relations with the “more primitive” Atakapans. Long (2007)
places two Atakapan speaking tribes, the Arkokisas (Orcoquisacs) and the Bidai, in the
Montgomery County area during the early eighteenth century. Around that time the two
groups were reportedly allies (Hodge 1907:145). While the coastal Atakapan tribes were
apparently hunter-gatherers who subsisted largely on fish and shellfish, the Bidai were
agriculturalists. During the latter half of the eighteenth century, the Bidai were described
as intermediaries between the French and Apache in the firearms trade (Hodge
1907:145). Around 1850 the last remnants of the Bidai were reportedly “..living in a
small village 12 miles from Montgomery, Texas, cultivating maize, serving as cotton
pickers, and bearing faithful allegiance to the Texans” (Hodge 1907:145). This group
may have been incorporated by the Caddo. The other Atakapan tribes also disappear
from the historic records by the mid-nineteenth century, casualties of the wars, disease
and social disintegration associated with European settlement (Long 2007).
The first Europeans to set foot in present day Montgomery County may well have
been French explorers under René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle. La Salle
apparently passed through the region in 1687 shortly before he was assassinated by one
of his own men (Long 2007; Weddle 2007). Spanish expeditions came next, first in
response to the French incursion into territory Spain had claimed since the sixteenth
century, and later to proselytize. Neither of the efforts resulted in permanent settlements,

9

although three missions were established and existed for a brief period in the mideighteenth century.
In the 1830s Anglo colonists gained a foothold in the region through land grants
issued by the Spanish authorities to Steven F. Austin. Montgomery County, which bears
the name of one of the earliest Austin colonists, was established by the Republic of Texas
in 1837. The current boundaries of the county were delimited in 1870 (Long 2007).
Throughout the latter half of the nineteenth century, the population of
Montgomery County grew steadily. Cotton formed the cornerstone of the local economy
until shortly after the Civil War, when soils became depleted. Economic collapse was
averted, however, by the arrival of railroads, which spurred a lumber boom that persisted
into the late 1920s (Johnson 1914). In 1932, amidst hardships brought about by the Great
Depression, boll weevil infestations and a decline in the lumber industry, oil was
discovered southeast of Conroe. Additional oil and natural gas reserves were soon
discovered, and the county began to prosper once again. Today, oil production remains a
leading source of income. Other major sources of revenue include lumber, livestock and
greenhouse and nursery products (Long 2007).

METHODS OF INVESTIGATION
The project described in this report entailed archival research and an
archaeological field investigation. The archival research consisted of a check for records
of documented sites in the online “Texas Archeological Sites Atlas,” which is maintained
by the Texas Historical Commission, as well as a review of other literature concerning
previous work in the county. The objectives of the review were to identify any
previously recorded sites in the project area and to compile information relevant to the
project from reports of prior archaeological investigations in the region.
The field investigation, an intensive survey, was conducted in May, 2007.
Michael R. Bradle was the Principal Investigator. Assistance with fieldwork was
provided by Project Archaeologist John Griggs, Ph.D., Oliver McDougle and Harold F.
Speights.
The field investigation consisted of a pedestrian survey supported by mechanical
auger testing. Implementation of the survey was impeded by dense vegetation, which
effectively precluded walking linear transects at regular intervals (Figure 6). Clearing
paths for transects through the underbrush was not attempted since surface visibility was
near zero throughout most of the project area due to thick underbrush and leaf fall.
However, fortuitously exposed areas were carefully inspected, as were the few areas with
higher visibility, including the sandy west bank of Stewarts Spring and a graded road
running east to west through the central portion of the project area (Figure 7). Artificial
impacts in the project area observed during the survey include the graded road, short
segments of which are topped with concrete, and drainage systems with buried
corrugated metal culverts. The presence of secondary vegetation throughout the project
area indicates prior clearing activities.

Testing for subsurface deposits of cultural remains was accomplished with a
mechanical auger fitted with an 8” diameter bit (Figure 8). Twenty-four auger tests were
excavated throughout the 36 acre project area, exceeding state minimum standards of one
subsurface test per two acres (Figure 8; Appendix I). All tests were excavated into the C
horizon. Samples of matrix from the tests was screened through ¼” hardware cloth. The
depths of the tests ranged from 25 to 138 centimeters below surface (cmbs). The average
depth was 59 cmbs. In the eastern half of the project area adjacent to Stewarts Creek,
auger testing frequently revealed moist to saturated soils. The water table was
encountered at depths as shallow as 48 cmbs.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Archival Research
A review of Texas Historical Commission records revealed no documented
archaeological sites within the project area. Prior investigations undertaken in the
vicinity (linear survey transects and an areal survey) crossed into the project area but
provided only minimal coverage (Figure 10). Only one site has been documented within
a 1 mile (1.6 kilometer) radius of the project area. This site, 41MQ142, lies on the east
bank of Stewarts Creek, just south of Foster Drive, approximately 250 feet (76 meters)
from the southeast corner of the project area. The site is described as an historic refuse
deposit about 2 feet thick covering an area of approximately 7-10 feet by 3-4 feet. The
deposit was exposed by a flood in 1994. Materials from the site, including bottles, cold
cream jars, ceramic dinner ware, tin can and iron objects, reportedly cross-date to the
second and third decades of the twentieth century. The site was deemed unworthy for
nomination as a State Archaeological Landmark, and no additional research was
recommended (RCRI 2007).

documented historic site to the southeast (RCRI 2007; map adapted from USGS 1958).
Field Investigation
The field investigation for this project involved pedestrian survey and auger
testing. Modern debris, including glass, masonry and furniture were encountered on the
ground surface in exposed areas during the survey, but no archaeological remains of
prehistoric or historic age were observed. The auger tests, which provided coverage in all
sectors of the project area, were likewise negative for archaeological remains (see
Appendix I). The combined results of the survey and auger testing suggest that no
significant deposits of cultural remains are present in the study area.

RECOMMENDATIONS
American Archaeology Group LLC recommends that construction of the
proposed Habitat for Humanity housing development be allowed to proceed. Monitoring
during construction by a professional archaeologist is not considered necessary.
However, should any cultural materials be exposed during construction, all work in the
immediate vicinity of the materials must cease until the situation can be evaluated by
American Archaeology Group LLC in consultation with the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development and the State Historic Preservation Officer.
