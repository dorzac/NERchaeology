FOREWORD

This volume details one of the most intriguing discoveries made by the Colha Project.
During the project's second season in 1980, excavations were carried out in the main
plaza of the site's monumental center. The excavations were designated Operation 2011
in the Colha system (Stock 1980:251). On the south side of the plaza, as shown on the
maps accompanying this Foreword, is a long mound representing the ruins of an ancient
Maya building. Exploratory excavations by Jack D. Eaton, in suboperations 3-8 and 9-13,
located the remnants of a broad staircase and recovered artifacts that dated the building
to late in the Classic period (Eaton 1980). Adjacent to the west side of the staircase, the
excavators uncovered a deposit of human skulls. Officially labeled as Operation 2011,
Feature 1, it quickly became known as the "Skull Pit." It was painstakingly excavated by
Jack Eaton, Anna Jean Taylor, and Fred Oglesby. A sketch of the excavated feature, by
Kathy Bareiss Roemer, is reproduced here and was originally published in the 1980
Colha interim report.
Details on the discovery and excavation of the "Skull Pit" are found in Eaton (1980),
Steele, et al. (1980), Hester, Shafer, et al. (1983), and Hester, et al. (1983). Color
photographs of the feature were published in the latter two references. Six additional
black and white views are provided here as further documentation.
The initial osteological analyses of the human remains from the Colha "Skull Pit" were
done by D. Gentry Steele of Texas A&M University (Steele, et al. 1980). Later, Virginia
Massey undertook a detailed study as her MA thesis, published here in revised form. She
has also written two additional papers on her research (Massey 1990; ms.).
In Massey's discussion of the different scenarios that might have led to the "Skull Pit"

deposit, there are viewpoints that may not be shared by all members of the Colha Project.
However, these are her views, and there is no "official" project interpretation of the
feature that we would ever ask her to follow! Furthermore, some archaeologists might
question her use of the term "cache" in describing this feature. However, since there are
several different ways in which this deposit might have been formed, the use of "cache"
may be applicable in some cases.

In closing, I would like to again thank those collaborating institutions that formed the
Colha Project during the 1980 season: The University of Texas at San Antonio, Texas
A&M University, and the Centro Studi e Ricerche Ligabue of Venice. I would further
like to thank D. Gentry Steele and Virginia Massey for their excellent work in the
continuing study of the Colha "Skull Pit."

ABSTRACT
An osteological investigation was conducted of a series of the human skulls found
in a cache dated to the Maya Terminal Classic period at Colha, Belize. Standard
osteological procedures revealed· data about the lives and deaths of the individuals
represented by the cache. Assessments were made of sex, age at death, dental
and honey pathology, and the cultural practices of cranial deformation and tooth
filing. The study also examined the evidence for postmortem mutilation of the
remains and explored the burial pattern.
The analysis documented that the skeletal material consisted of cranial remains
of 30 decapitated individuals whose heads had been placed in a pit at
approximately the same time. There were almost equal numbers of males,
females, and children. Ages ranged from infant to old adult, but children older
than six or seven and adolescents were excluded from the collection. The
demographic findings suggest that the skeletal remains were probably not those
of actual nuclear families, but the composition may have had symbolic meaning.
There was no sign of widespread serious disease or malnutrition, but dental
disorders were prevalent.
Considerable synchronous variation existed in cultural modification of the
skeleton. Not all individuals showed deliberate deformation of the cranium or
filed teeth and those who did exhibit either or both of these traits varied in their
style of alteration.
The analysis concluded with efforts to determine who the victims were and
whether they had been killed for religious sacrifice or in a political upheaval.
Although cultural modifications of the skeleton show them to be Maya, it was not
possible to determine from the skeletal evidence whether or not they were
residents of Colha. The postmortem processing of the bone as revealed primarily
by the numerous cut marks, the composition and arrangement of the burial and
its association with a monumental structure, all suggest that the burial
represents religious sacrifice.
But, the coincidence of the burial with the
destruction of the monumental center and the end of Terminal Classic culture
suggest that the deaths occurred for political reasons. The skeletal data alone
does not provide firm evidence for one purpose rather than the other.

INTRODUCTION
This monograph reports the results of an osteological analysis of the human
skeletal material recovered from Operation 2011, Feature 1, also known as the
skull pit, excavated at Colha, Belize, during the 1980 season. The investigation
emphasized an analysis of those structural features indicative of the age, sex, and
health of the individuals. The analysis also emphasized structural features that
indicate cultural practices affecting the life and death of the individuals. Last,
the study explored the implications of the cut marks which were found on the
skeletal material.
Examining human skeletal remains for clues to reconstructing individuals'
biological conditions in life as well as the social milieu in which they lived is one
of the compelling goals of physical anthropology. Archaeological studies of Maya
populations have therefore frequently included sections on the analysis of human
remains in spite of the generally poor quality of the samples. Even when the
bone was too fragile to be removed from its place of burial, physical
anthropologists have drawn whatever inferences were possible from the remains
(see Agrinier 1975).
Several kinds of valuable information about the Maya derive from these studies:
burial customs have been shown to suggest social status and to imply sacrificial
death (Smith 1972), and skeletal material has revealed health status during life
(Saul 1972). Many studies describe change through time in burial customs
(Smith, 1972), in styles and frequency of deliberate alteration of the skeleton and
teeth (Munizaga 1976, Romero 1970), and in dental pathology (Anderson 1967).
These studies have been invaluable in portraying temporal patterns in a changing
culture.
Important as the above studies are, though, there is one disadvantage to relying
entirely on them for our understanding of the Maya: skeletal collections that
permit documenting change through time rarely show a large contemporaneous
sample. Generally mortuary samples comprise the remains of individuals who
died one by one over a long period of time. Dating is never precise enough even
to show which individuals' lifetimes overlapped. Studies of genetics, demography,
epidemiology, and the social importance of cultural modification are therefore
very difficult to conduct in these samples which lack the time control a
simultaneous death assemblage affords. Consequently, our understanding of the
population is diminished by our inability to envision the variation that existed at
a single point in time.
This present study, of the skeletal remains of individuals who died virtually at
the same time and whose skulls were buried in the same place, begins to fill the
void left by chronological studies. Like Agrinier's (1978) analysis of a mass
sacrificial burial, the present study shows a sample of the population at one point
in time. In this sample, as in others, different patterns of tooth mutilation were
found, and some individuals appeared to have been healthier than others.
Usually we cannot identify any such variation as synchronous; it could all
represent change through time. In this sample, though, we know that the
differences in styles and health existed contemporaneously, and our assessment of
the population will need to accommodate its heterogeneity.

The Site
The Maya site of Colha is exhaustively reported in three interim reports (Hester
1979, Hester et al. 1980, 1982), a richly illustrated book (Hester et al. 1983),
papers in national and international journals (Shafer and Hester 1983, 1986;
Hester and Shafer 1984) and several unpublished master of arts theses (e.g.,
Roemer 1984), to which the reader is referred for a wealth of detail and
interpretation.
The interim reports contain numerous papers describing
excavation operations and analyzing material found to date. Many remarks here
about the Colha Project are abstracted from these works.
Colha is an ancient lowland Maya site located in northern Belize about 53 km
north-northwest of Belize City and 24 km from the coast. Located in a flat land
area, northern Belize is generously filled with Eocene and Miocene limestone
deposits which, in the area of Colha, contain high quality chert. The climate is
described as tropical savannah type with temperatures ranging from 10 to 35
degrees Celsius and with an average annual rainfall of 178 cm per year (Roemer
1984).
The site has been studied extensively since Norman Hammond began work there
in 1973 as part of the Corozal Project. In 1976 Thomas R. Hester joined with
Hammond to organize a field symposium in northern Belize in order to assess
lithic research in the area and to inspect the Colha site. Hester and Harry J.
Shafer have directed the research there since 1979 with Jack Eaton involved in
the 1979-1983 seasons. The Colha Project has been a joint effort since 1979 of
The University of Texas at San Antonio, Center for Archaeological Research;
Texas A&M University; the Centro Studi e Ricerche Ligabue in Venice, and The
University of Texas at Austin. Supporting agencies have included the National
Endowment for the Humanities, the National Geographic Society, and
Earthwatch. Research here has been fruitful: Interim reports have issued from
the project summarizing three field seasons (Hester 1979, Hester et al. 1980,
1982). Several papers about the tool technology have been published (Hester et
al. 1983; Hester and Shafer 1984; Shafer and Hester 1983, 1986.) In addition
to these English language publications, an illustrated Italian book about Colha
was published (Hester et al. 1983) in Venice. Symposia on the Colha research
have taken place at the 1980, 1981, and 1985 annual meetings of the Society for
American Archaeology, and an invited session on Colha was included in the 1981
meeting of the American Anthropological Association.
To date Colha is one of the largest mapped sites in northern Belize, covering at
least 6 km 2 (Eaton 1982). It was active over a long span of time, with three
major periods of activity: during the Middle to Late Preclassic (900 B.C. to A.D.
250), Late Classic (A.D. 600 to 850), and the Early Postclassic (A.D. 850 to
1250). The site is particularly important archaeologically for its plentiful stone
tool workshop deposits, of which approximately 100 have been found. Analysis of
one of these workshop deposits (Roemer 1984) indicates that there was a
specialized stone tool industry in Colha which provided implements for local use
and for formally administered trade in the region. In addition to the workshops,
Colha had a monumental center on the northern side of the settlement. Now a
clustering of mounds, it was once a group of buildings and plazas which probably
was the center of political activity and religious ceremony. By Late Classic times,

3

it included steep pyramidal structures which were probably temples and shrines,
linear structures which may have been administrative offices and palaces, and a
ballcourt enlarged since its Preclassic origin (Eaton 1980).
The Sample
It was at the Colha site, associated with one of the monumental structures, that
the sample for the present study was found. It comprises 30 crania with
associated mandibles and vertebrae buried together and without postcranial
remains in a pit. Jack Eaton and A. J. Taylor directed the excavation of the
skull cache as Colha Operation 2011, Feature 1, in 1980. The building evidently
consisted of a pyramidal series of terraces topped by a stone superstructure and
may have been a temple or palace (Eaton 1980). West of the staircase and in
front of a wall on the second terrace (Jack Eaton, personal communication), a pit
had been dug into the marl plaster floor to receive the heads of the decapitation
victims. The pit measured about 110 cm long, 80 cm wide, and 20 cm deep.
Stones in the terrace wall behind the pit show signs of heat-fracturing, and the
rubble covering the pit contained burned stones which probably fell from the
superstructure above when it was destroyed. Eaton (1980) believes that the
destruction of the building followed soon after the skulls were deposited.

Eaton and Taylor's description of the skull pit, condensed in this paragraph,
accompanies D. Gentry Steele's preliminary analysis of the skeletal material
(Steele et al. 1980). The skulls were arranged in two layers in a variety of
orientat10ns. Many proved to be badly fragmented and in some the fragments
were somewhat scattered and commingled. Large ceramic fragments separated
and covered many of the skulls, but no complete vessels were recovered. The
ceramic types found included Palmar Orange Polychrome, Subin Red, and
Encanto Striated, all Late to Terminal Classic (about A. D. 900).
This skeletal sample has several features that make its contribution to Maya
studies uniquely valuable. Much of its importance, as indicated, lies in the
contemporaneity of its members. Knowing that these individuals all lived at the
same time gives us an estimate of the variability within the population and also
indicates which traits and disorders were coeval.
Another unusual feature of the skull pit material is that a cause of death is
suggested. Decapitation of a large group of people, though possibly not the cause
of death, surely indicates death by unnatural and involuntary means. In typical
mortuary samples, the cause of death for most members cannot be determined.
Here it is known that the individuals were decapitated at the time of death or
shortly thereafter, that the heads were surrounded by ceramics and buried in
close association with a monumental structure. This behavior reflects the Maya
pattern of killing people and exhibiting human remains in a religious or political
context. This in turn raises questions about who was killed -- male or female,
young or old, Maya or non-Maya -- these types of questions hopefully can be
answered by analysis of the skeletal remains.
Third, this sample is unique to date in presenting easily observable cut marks on
the skeleton.
Although Landa, as translated by Pagden (1975), reported

4

occasions of removing skin from sacrificia] victims, skeletal samples recovered in
the past have failed to document this practice. Here the butchery marks are
discernible and the pattern they show may be explored.
A fourth unusual feature of this sample is the high ratio of children. Of 30
Immature bone, thinner and less
skulls, 10 were found to be children.
mineralized than adult bone, generally has very poor preservation even under
ordinary burial conditions in soil which is considerably less damaging than that in
Maya localities. The high frequency of children in this sample allows a more
detailed examination of children in this culture, of their health and the extent of
their participation in detectable cultural practices.
In spite of this sample's uniquely valuable qualities, it has one feature that limits
the questions which may be asked about the individuals whose skeletal remains
are preserved. That is the poor physical condition of the material. One would
hope to recover unbroken skulls with bone strong enough for removal intact from
the pit and with bone surfaces marked only by conditions affecting the individual
during life. Unfortunately, such preservation is so extremely rare in Maya
collections that it is found only in samples that have been submerged in water for
hundreds of years. Bone excavated from the acid tropical soil of the region is
invariably fragmented and chemically eroded. Reconstruction could minimize the
damage caused by breakage were it not for chemical erosion, but here, after the
bone broke, the edges were so damaged by acid that the pieces cannot be
reunited. Further, chemical activity dissolves, pits, and scars some of the surface
of the bone so badly that evidence of disease conditions which might have been
visible at one time are no longer present. The chemical activity also makes the
entire bone more fragile and subject to crushing. Added to the chemical and
physical damage are the destructive effects of plant roots and gnawing
invertebrates.
All of the destructive agents indicated left the sample in a greatly comrninuted
condition. The archaeologists' unenviable task of removing the material without
further damage required unusual patience and careful techniques. To this end,
they coated the skulls liberally, before attempting removal from the matrix, with
a preservative made from water and white glue, which they believed to be watersoluble. This is a time-honored method of preserving bone in the field and in the
past has been quite successful. Unfortunately, the chemical formula of the white
glue was changed by the manufacturer without public announcement. Now the
glue is not soluble in water or even in acetone. It may be removed with varnish
remover and vigorous scrubbing, but such a cleaning procedure is unduly timeconsuming, requiring about 40 hours to clean, conserve, and reconstruct one skull.
Moreover, this harsh treatment damages the bone even more.
It seemed best to leave the preservative on, in the interest of preventing greater
destruction. Further, the time available for analysis could not be dominated by
cleaning. But, the preservative was mixed with large amounts of dirt and often
covered calcium deposits. Without thorough cleaning, many features could not be
seen at all. To reconcile these conflicting goals, it was decided to clean 21 of the
skulls thoroughly and the remaining nine only with water. All of the children's
skulls were thoroughly cleaned, as was that of one young adult and selected adult
skulls.

5
As a result of the natural condition of the skulls, none of which were intact, and
of the two different preparation procedures, for some questions data was not
available from the complete sample.
Preliminary Findings
In his preliminary analysis of the skull pit skeletal material, Steele (Steele et al.
1980) detailed the evidence for synchronous burial, analyzed the demographic
structure of the sample, and summarized both cultural modification of the
skeleton and observable characteristics of dental health. The pit had apparently
been dug to receive the heads of decapitation victims. That they all died at the
same time is shown by the presence of mandibles and vertebrae.
If the
individuals had first been buried elsewhere, then later exhumed and their heads
re-interred in the skull pit, the mandibles and vertebrae would not have been
found in close association with the crania. If the skulls had been placed into the
pit over a long period of time, those found on the bottom layers would have
shown signs of disturbance. Photographs of this cache taken before the skulls
were removed show that the ceramics which had been placed around and between
the skulls were not greatly disturbed, as they would have been if these burials
had not all been interred at the same time. For these reasons it may be assumed
that the sample consists of remains of contemporaneous individuals who died at
virtually the same time. Steele estimated that 30 individuals were represented
in the sample: seven adult males, 10 adult females, four adults of unknown sex,
and nine children under seven years of age whose sex could not be determined.
Three of the individuals appeared to be older than 12 but younger than 18, and
18 individuals were adult, of whom one was classed as old. Cultural modification
of the shape of the cranium and teeth were observed in some but not all members
of the sample. No correlations between cultural modification and other observed
characteristics were found.
Steele suggested that further studies might
investigate biological affinities, possible socioeconomic correlations with the
cultural modifications, the significance of the demographic structure in its
resemblance to groups of nuclear families, and whether or not the skeletal
material was a random sample of the population from which it was drawn.
Another preliminary report (Massey 1989) has described the subadult skeletal
material from the skull pit and noted that cut marks were found on the bone.
Other reports have described skeletal material from the Colha site.
A
taphonomic study of the Colha skeletal material and a preliminary analysis of
skeletal material from other portions of the site were reported by Massey and
Steele in 1982. Their paper noted that burial conditions at this site were quite
degrading to bone, resulting in recovered honey material which was fragmented,
extremely friable, and which was eroded on its surface by chemicals in the soil as
well as by roots and gnawing invertebrates. This study noted, however, that the
skull pit skeletal material suffered less deterioration than that recovered from
other regions of the site. Another osteological study (Young 1989) reported the
analysis of burials recovered during the 1983 field season at Colha. Again, bone
preservation was poor.

Related Literature
Although studies of other Maya skeletal collections have contributed to our
understanding of that cultural group, there are several reasons why our
knowledge of Maya biological characteristics is by no means complete. First, the
skeletal material excavated in Mesoamerica is usually quite deteriorated,
fragmented and eroded by chemicals in the soil. Many workers have complained
of the generally poor bone preservation of these samples, and their investigations
have therefore been limited to such characters as remain in the damaged bone.
Second, several studies, particularly the earlier ones (Gann 1918, Stirling 1941,
Coe 1959; see also Agrinier 1978), were mainly archaeological in their objectives,
and focused on the cultural aspects of interment:
burial position, burial
orientation, and the association of skeletal with cultural material. In these
studies, there was little evaluation of the population's health or its age structure,
two areas of concern in recent osteological analyses. Nevertheless, although the
emphasis in the past was cultural, interest in biological characteristics has a long
history. Biological traits that were frequently recorded in the earlier studies were
often those that seemed to establish ancestry and those that showed cultural
modification of the skeleton, artificial cranial deformation and tooth mutilation.
Recently, the long-standing interest in biological traits has increased and
techniques for evaluating them improved, resulting in physical analyses (Saul
1972, see also Storey 1983) of Mesoamerican skeletal collections that are as
thorough as the condition of the bone allows. The trend now is to report not only
cultural modifications of bone but also the lesions recorded on them, to estimate
the demographic structure of the population and to assess the public health.
Last, most Maya skeletal samples, like most skeletal collections everywhere, do
not represent instantaneous death assemblages. Change through time can be
assessed, but not the variation present at a single point in time.
Some Maya skeletal studies are of importance because of their large sample size:
Pierre Agrinier's 1964 analysis of 168 burials excavated at Chiapa de Corzo;
James E. Anderson's 1967 study of the skeletal remains of 70 individuals
excavated in the Tehuacan Valley; T. Dale Stewart's 1974 examination of at
least 97 individual skeletons from Dzibilchaltun, and Alberto Ruz's 1968 review
of 60 Lowland Maya site studies reporting about 1000 burials. Five other studies
bear particularly on the present investigation, and although the literature
relating to Maya physical studies will not be exhaustively set forth, a look at
these five will help put the present inquiry into perspective.
The first is Gann's 1918 investigation of the first skull pit found in the Maya
region, located inside a mound near the Rio Hondo in Belize. A pit beneath the
floor of a stone structure contained 40 human skulls, neatly arranged in rows.
Gann surmised that either they represented human sacrifice, and that the bodies
were eaten or buried elsewhere, or that the skulls represented a secondary burial
of individuals who may have died natural deaths. Gann observed that the jaws
appeared to have held all permanent teeth during life, and that their retention
argued against natural death, because the individuals would have been in the
prime of life when they died. However, small shallow graves have been found at
the bases of mounds, and the remains could have been removed from these
possibly temporary graves and the skulls placed in the cache. Further, Gann
believed the Maya did not engage in human sacrifice on such a large scale.

7

Physical analysis of the skulls was limited to the observation about tooth
retention, as the bone preservation was not good enough to perm.it removal of the
skulls from their pit. The significance of Gann's study to the present analysis is
that he helped establish such treatment of human remains as indigenous to Maya
culture.
Another cache of skulls was excavated at Cerro de las Mesas, Veracruz, Mexico,
by Matthew Stirling (1941, 1975). Here, 52 skulls, each packaged in its own
ceramic urn, were found in double rows between two floors under a mound. The
presence of mandibles and cervical vertebrae signified that the cache was a
primary burial of decapitated heads. Stirling assessed all as representing young
adults, and he noted that the crania had been artificially deformed and that
notches had been filed into the teeth. Phillip Drucker, who accompanied Stirling,
reported that· "a good number" (Drucker 1943) of the skulls appeared to
represent children and subadults.
Like Gann's (1918) report, Stirling's work shows a Mesoamerican treatment of
human remains that resembles that of the Colha skull pit. Both samples
represent a primary burial of decapitated skulls. Additionally, both samples
exhibit the cultural traits of artificial cranial deformation and tooth filing.
The third work which bears significantly on the present study is Frank Saul's
(1972) osteological analysis of the Altar de Sacrificios skeletal material. This
work, of major importance to Maya studies, includes an appended dental analysis
by Donald M. Austin (1972). Hoping to evaluate the health status of ancient
Altar, Saul studied a sample of 90 individuals representing time periods from 800
B.C. to A.D. 1000 for sex, age at death, pathology, cultural modifications, and
genetic continuity through time. His new focus in physical studies illuminated
issues material culture cannot address. Demographic analysis, for example,
showed a paucity of females and subadults at Altar, indicating to Saul that the
settlement was primarily a ceremonial center. Austin's dental analysis showed
that the Altar population had maintained its genetic continuity through time,
rather than undergoing significant intrusion from other populations through
invasion or other sources of admixture. Therefore, the apparent decline in
stature from ancient to modern times must be accounted for ecologically, as
indicating stress from malnutrition or disease, instead of being attributed to
massive gene flow. The Altar collection shows other evidence of nutritional stress
and disease in its evidence for anemia, growth arrest at weaning, scurvy, and
treponemal infection. Saul concluded that the general level of health and energy
was so depressed among a significantly large portion of the population that it
may have contributed to the collapse of Maya culture when it was threatened
with destruction by invaders. It can be seen that Saul's innovative emphasis on
biology offered a great deal of information on important issues. The present work
seeks the same kind of information from the skeletal material as the Altar study
but differs from it in examining a synchronous sample.
Another important study is of a unique skeletal sample recovered from the
Sacred Cenote at Chichen Itza (Hooton 1940). At least 42 individuals are
represented by the collection, which is in an excellent state of preservation,
remarkable among Maya samples. Hooton found both sexes represented and
estimated ages ranging from under six years to old adulthood. Nearly all had
artificially deformed crania, and several showed evidence of spongy hyperostosis,

8
which can indicate anemia. As there was no temporal provenience, it is difficult
to assess the significance of these findings in representing the population
characteristics, but it is a valuable collection because of its size and preservation
as well as because it documents the presence, in yet another Maya site, of
artificial cranial deformation and anemia.
The last archaeological study that is closely related to the present work shows a
segment of the Maya population at a single point in time. Agrinier's (1978)
investigation of a mass burial at Miramar, Chiapas, Mexico clearly showed that
the 24 individuals interred there died at the same time. Cultural analysis of the
burial led to the conclusion that it represented a mass religious sacrifice in
response to an unusual astronomical threat, exacerbated perhaps by ecological
stress. Believing that large-scale mass sacrifice was not so characteristic of the
Maya as of the later Aztecs, Agrinier suggested that it was brought about in
response to the total eclipse of the sun which is known to have occurred in the
area at roughly the same time as the burial.
Eclipses were thought in
Mesoamerica to result from conflict between the sun and the moon, and human
sacrifices apparently were made to each of these deities as well as to Venus.
Agrinier inferred to which god each individual was dedicated from the number of
skeletons found together in each subgroup, from the location of each subgroup
and the orientation of each skeleton within the cluster, all relative to the cardinal
directions; and from the associated cultural material. Although physical analysis
of the skeletons was conducted, these findings were of minimal relevance to the
conclusions. Nevertheless, this study is significantly related to the present work
because each skeletal collection represents the mass burial of an instantaneous
death assemblage at a Maya site. It is only in these two skeletal samples that
synchronous variation can be documented.
One last report should be mentioned although it concerns neither osteology nor
archaeology. Diego de Landa, the sixteenth century Spanish bishop of the
Yucatan, recorded innumerable observations of Maya culture. His Relacion de las
Cosas de Yucatan (Pagden 1975) is the major historical document about the
Maya and a recognized aid to the interpretation of archaeological data. Landa's
treatment, particularly of religious matters, may be extremely unsympathetic but
his extensive coverage of many aspects of Maya life, as well as the dearth of
other historical sources, make his work essential to all Maya studies. His account
repeatedly added tentative explanation or elaboration to the findings of the
osteological analysis reported here and was especially illuminating about probable
cultural contexts of the cut marks found on the bone.
In summary, earlier physical and archaeological studies of Maya skeletal
collections have pointed out the types of pathology one might expect to find,
indicated the cultural modifications commonly made to the skeleton, and revealed
the culturally distinct ways of death and of handling human remains that existed
in Maya populations. These areas of interest have in part governed the present
analysis of the Colha skull pit skeletal material. A single historical document,
detailing Maya culture at the time of contact with Europeans, offered supporting
evidence to osteological findings.

OBJECTIVES AND METHODS
Objectives
The objectives of this investigation were to detect and evaluate conditions
affecting the life and death of the individuals whose cranial remains were
preserved in the skull pit. Specifically, data was sought to inform of three
conditions:
1) The innate biological status of the individuals. The physical characteristics
determined were sex, age at death, and pathology of the bone and teeth.
2) The cultural modifications to which the individuals had been subjected.
Artificial cranial deformation and tooth mutilation are two cultural practices that
leave signs on the skeleton; often evidence of these practices are found in Maya
collections.
3) The culturally prescribed ways in which the remains were handled after
death. Cut marks were found on the skeletal material. Their pattern was
analyzed and their possible significance inferred. Selected other properties of the
burial were considered as well.
Methods
Sex
Where adult skulls are intact, sex of the individuals they represent can be
assessed with 82% - 89% accuracy by discriminant analysis of cranial
measurements (Giles and Elliott 1963). Fragmented and reconstructed skulls,
however, permit so much error in measurement that this method may not be
reliable even if the reconstructed skull is complete enough to allow all
measurements, usually not the case with poorly preserved bone. As the sample
for this study is highly comminuted, no metric assessment was performed to
assign sex. Instead, characteristics of the skull that may be visually assessed
were used for this determination. These traits basically stem from the generally
greater size and robusticity of adult males than females in a given population.
This robusticity results in more pronounced muscle markings and greater
obliteration of juvenile traits.
Characteristic of males relative to females (Bass 1971, Brothwell, 1981, El-Najjar
and McWilliams 1978, Krogman 1962, Steele and Bramblett 1988, Stewart
1979) are greater mandibular body height, eversion of the gonial angle,
squareness of the chin, larger mastoid process, more strongly marked zygomatic
crest, more pronounced nuchal and temporal lines, larger supraorbital torus, more
strongly marked external occipital protuberance, greater obliteration of the
frontal and parietal eminences, and greater rounding of the superior rim of the
orbit.
Female skulls, on the other hand, are generally smaller, smoother, and retain
more prominently the juvenile parietal and frontal eminences. The supraorbital
9

10

torus is smaller, the rim of the orbit sharper, the mastoid process and mandible
smaller. The zygomatic arch is less robust and its crest is less prominent. The
chin is round or pointed and the gonial angle less strongly marked for the
attachment of the masseter muscle. The height of the mandibular corpus is less.
The above traits tend to show differences between males and females in all
populations. However, populations vary so much among themselves in size and
robusticity that one cannot say with assurance that any given development of a
trait is male or female. Some populations are so gracile that only males have
everted gonial angles and zygomatic crests that extend posterior to the external
auditory meatus. Other populations are so robust that all individuals have these
characteristics. In very robust populations, it may be only the size of features
and the prominence of muscle attachment marks which distinguish the sexes.
It is particularly important to be aware of population differences in badly
fragmented cranial material. If the bone surface is eroded from many areas of

the skull, if many areas are missing entirely, the assessment of sex will have to
be based on those observable features which remain. Too much weight may be
assigned to one or two characteristics when an overall judgment of the skull
based on several traits cannot be made. It is more difficult to keep population
differences in mind when forced to rely on incomplete data.
A limitation to sex assessment in this sample is that only the adult material can
be so judged, because traits that distinguish males are discernible only in mature
crania. At present there is no commonly accepted method of sexing subadult
crama.
Age
Estimating age at death in adult cranial material relies on observing signs of
gradual, variable changes that occur during adulthood. Since aging is a slow
process and varies from one individual to another in its rate of progression, no
exact categories of adult age can be constructed to analyze cranial remains.
However, it was possible to classify adult skulls in the skull pit sample into the
three general groups of young adult, adult, and old adult. For the purposes of
this study, a young adult was considered to be one in whom a third molar had
erupted but showed little or no wear. An adult had a full set of permanent
dentition and had not yet experienced extreme wear on the teeth or extensive
tooth loss with alveolar resorption. An old adult had suffered either of these
conditions. The qualities of extreme tooth wear and extensive tooth loss, of
course, are relative ones. Some young adults may have been included in the
general category "adult" if the wear on their third molars could not be assessed.
Other changes may accompany old age as well; their age of onset is highly
variable but they are found in greatest frequency in groups of old adults.
Standard texts describe the characteristics of old age (Brothwell 1981, Krogman
1962, Steele and Bramblett 1988, Ubelaker 1978). Traits that were often
considered as indicators of old age include fusion of the cranial sutures, arthritic
deterioration of the temporomandibular joint, and thinning of the parietal bones
resulting from a loss of diploe.

11
In the past, tooth wear has been evaluated to give an estimate of age in years.
Miles (1963) examined a prehistoric Anglo-Saxon skeletal collection, comparing
wear on the first and second molars in individuals of known age to determine the
amount of wear expected in this population for various periods of time. Charts
were then constructed to show typical molar wear at various age intervals. It
was not Miles' intention to apply the Anglo-Saxon chart to populations other than
prehistoric British groups, because differences in diet, not to mention physical
differences between populations, make such age estimates unreliable. Miles did
believe, however, that age estimates could be adequately derived from tooth wear
in any group, provided that one had a large enough cohort of individuals of
known age in whom first and second molars had erupted.
Recently Lovejoy (1985) employed a modification of Miles' procedure with good
results. He first seriated all the complete dentitions in a sample in order to learn
correspondences of wear among anterior teeth, premolars, and molars. Then
following Miles' procedure, he examined a large (n= 132) sample of subadult
dentitions, from individuals between six and 18 years old at time of death, to
learn the rates of wear in this population. Last, he applied age categories to the
seriation first constructed. Lovejoy et al. (1985) concluded that tooth wear
seriation is the single best indicator of age at death in a skeletal population. It
must be recognized, though, that errors of age assignment can occur with this
method, because individual variation in rates of wear may not be adequately
encompassed by the age range categories produced.
Unfortunately, the requisite individuals of known age are absent from the skull
pit collection and a calibrated seriation cannot be produced. In the present study,
therefore, tooth wear is taken to correlate moderately with length of life. Tooth
wear is recorded in standard categories, but this data is not used to give precise
age estimates. Instead, tooth wear data augments the qualitative description of
the individuals, and in a general way shows that some individuals experienced
greater wear on their teeth, probably because they lived longer, than others.
Many schemes for scoring dental attrition have been devised, among them Miles'
\;ell-known chart discussed above and Murphy's (1959) classification. These
plans have the advantage of lending themselves to quantification studies (see
Smith 1984), but since the categories of wear are not quantified intervals, in this
study the classification was used for purposes of description only. Hinton's
modification of Murphy's classification as seen in Smith (1984) seemed best to
use, because the scheme includes anterior teeth as well as molars and illustrates
variants of each class. The ordinal categories of tooth wear range from Stage
One to Stage Eight based on increasing exposure of dentin and increasing erosion
of enamel. Stage One designates teeth showing no dentin and either no wear at
all or a light polishing of the enamel. Stage Eight indicates a complete loss of
crown with no enamel remaining.
Ideally, wear among individuals is compared by ranking a selected tooth, such as
the right first molar chosen for Smith's study, from each dentition.
The
alternative of averaging the stages on all the teeth in a dentition should not be
done because it requires one to assume, incorrectly, that the intervals between
stages are equal and that stage 2x represents twice as much wear as stage x.
For example, Stage Four would be assumed to indicate twice as much wear as
Stage Two. As these assumptions cannot be made with the ordinal or rank

12
categories used here, "averages" of tooth wear are not meaningful as quantified
values. Appropriate comparisons are made only among single teeth.
Unfortunately, poor preservation and antemortem tooth loss collaborated against
the opportunity to choose a single tooth type. Indeed, no presently known
method of evaluating tooth wear could be appropriately used in the analysis of
the skull pit sample. Nonetheless, tooth wear does increase with age, and this
study needed a way to compare individuals on that basis. It was therefore
decided that averaging the wear values assigned to various teeth within a single
dentition would give a general description of that individual's tooth wear.
Comparing individuals on this basis would add to the qualitative information
about the sample but could not be used for quantitative judgments nor used to
assign age in years.
To help confirm the utility of averaging tooth wear values for each individual, the
11 cleaned adult mandibles were arranged in a series of increasing tooth wear. If
the seriation had conflicted with the groupings produced by tooth wear averages,
doubt would have been cast on the informative value of the averaging procedure.
In general, the results of seriation corroborated those of the tooth wear
averaging.
Another method of estimating adult age in the past was by evaluating the degree
of fusion in the cranial sutures. Fusion typically progresses in a regular fashion,
but there is so much individual variation in onset and timing most analysts
consider it of very limited utility as a single indicator of age (Krogman 1962).
However, Meindl and Lovejoy (1985) revised the method for evaluating suture
closure and believed the new procedure to be of value in estimating age when
used in conjunction with other indicators. Fusion of the lateral-anterior sutures
was found to correlate better with age than that of the vault sutures.
Unfortunately, the thinner, more fragile lateral-anterior portion of the skull is
poorly represented in the skull pit sample.
One suture, though, which was of value in estimating the age of young adults in
the present analysis is that between the sphenoid and the occipital. This suture
begins fusion no earlier than 16 years of age and is complete by 21 years (Steele
and Bramblett 1988).
The age of subadults is best estimated from the development of their teeth
(Ubelaker 1978). In the present study, the age of juveniles was estimated by
comparing their dentition with that shown in Schour and Massler's (1941, 1944)
chart. Unfortunately, there are some drawbacks to using the chart. The ages
suggested by Schour and Massler are derived from unknown data, possibly taken
from their own practices, and their conclusions may have several weaknesses: 1)
The sample is probably taken from a single biological population, North American
white children. 2) The sex ratio is unspecified. 3) The sample size for any
given developmental stage is unspecified. Further, the 1941 publication did not
suggest any variability. The 1944 revised chart, however, included plus-or-minus
values but did not indicate what these values represented, whether one or two
standard deviations or the full range of observed values. Garn et al. (1959) found
that their own estimates of variability were at least three times greater than any
that had been published previously, but they emphasized that even their sample
sizes were too small to establish norms. In addition, they suggested that the

13

estimated standard deviation may not be the best indicator of variation because
in some developmental categories the distribution appears to be skewed. Thus,
the estimated ages derived from the Schour and Massler chart, with all its
shortcomings, need to be considered as subject to considerable unquantified error.
Fortunately, this chart has proved nonetheless to be reasonably accurate in
estimating ages of living white boys and girls in Atlanta (Gray and Lamons 1959)
and in England (Miles 1958).
Ubelaker (1978) indicates that North American Indian children seem to be
slightly advanced in dental calcification over North American whites and has
modified Schour and Massler's chart for use in estimating ages of juveniles in
Indian populations. Since Maya Indians might be expected to be biologically
closer to North American Indians than to whites, Ubelaker's chart might seem
more appropriate for the skull pit study. However, the modification is based on
calcification data from studies of North American white children. The modified
chart shows earlier root development of anterior teeth, and it has larger plus-andminus values recorded. Otherwise the age estimates are substantially the same
as Schour and Massler's. Again, the meaning of the plus-or-minus values is
unstated.
Very little quantitative data from Indian samples was used in
Ubelaker's modification, and to date no published study has shown how well the
chart estimates ages in samples of Indian children of known age. It was
therefore decided to use the older chart which has been tested, even if on a very
small scale and on non-Indian populations.
Supplementary indication of age in children is given by the. absence of fusion
between centers of ossification in a bone (Gray 1936). The occipital bone exists
as four separate elements at birth; the lateral elements fuse to the squama before
the age of three or four and the basilar and exoccipital parts fuse before age five
or six. The elements of the atlas (first cervical) vertebra fuse by the age of six or
eight as do the neural arches of the second and third cervical vertebrae.
Pathology
Dental pathology noted in this investigation included caries, alveolar abscesses,
enamel hypoplasia and other malformations of the teeth, calculus, periodontal
disease, and antemortem tooth loss. The pathologies are described in Colby et al.
1971, Ortner and Putschar 1981, and Steele and Bramblett 1988) Some of these
conditions must be diagnosed by different criteria in the macerated skeleton from
those which are pathognomic during life. In life, a carious lesion is one which
contains necrotic material; in the skeleton it is known by a tooth cavity which
has rounded edges. An abscess is an infected area of bone and soft tissue in life;
in death it may be detected by an alveolar perforation which shows signs of
previous osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity at its margin.
Enamel hypoplasia is defined as an insufficient deposition of enamel at a point in
time when the tooth was developing. It may be diagnosed by a groove or pitting
on the crown which is roughly parallel to the gum line. The cause of enamel
hypoplasia is generally attributed to severe illness at some point during the time
of tooth formation or to injury to the deciduous precursors (Colby et al. 1971),
although some recent studies have emphasized the correlation with malnutrition

14

(Sweeney et al. 1971, Jelliffe and Jelliffe 1971). Most studies of linear enamel
hypoplasia have concentrated on the anterior maxillary deciduous teeth, and its
prevalence and etiology in other teeth is not as well known, although Ortner and
Putschar (1981) write of cases of hypoplasia of the permanent dentition in
individuals known or believed to have had syphilis, and Goodman and Armelagos
recently reported the distribution of hypoplasias among permanent teeth by
position (1985). Typically the hypoplastic groove is more vulnerable to caries
than is the rest of the crown. Hypoplasia has been useful in comparing stress
among different segments of archaeological populations and in detecting an
increase in stress through time (Goodman et al. 1980).
Other malformations noted included notching on the edges of the incisors, tooth
fusion, and tooth gemination. Syphilis as a causal agent in notching as well as in
hypoplasia should be considered if evidence of the disease should appear in other
parts of the sample, as congenital syphilis is known to cause malformations of the
teeth, particularly of the molars and upper lateral incisors (Steinbock 1976).
However, Colby et al. (1971) as well as Steinbock warn that dental indicators
alone are not pathognomic of the disease. The other malformations, tooth fusion
and tooth gemination, are developmental anomalies. In tooth fusion, two teeth
are united root and crown, and the number of teeth in the jaw is reduced by one.
Tooth gemination denotes the partial splitting of the crown of a single tooth.
Generally the root remains single and the total number of teeth in the jaw is
normal. Calculus is a white, tan, or grey chalky-looking substance which adheres
to teeth, especially on the lingual surface near the cervical junction. Colby et al.
(1971) consider excessive calculus deposits to cause most periodontal disease.
Periodontal disease itself is inferred from evidence of subperiosteal osteoblastic
and osteoclastic activity on the alveolar borders. Premortem tooth loss is known
from the partial or complete resorption of the alveolus.
Dentitions were ranked from zero to three for relative degrees of destruction by
caries. Rank 0 was given to dentitions that were free from decay. Rank 1
indicated that any of the teeth may have had one or several small, pin-hole sized
lesions and no more than one larger cavity. When larger areas of caries were
present, but no more than one tooth surface was nearly obliterated by decay, the
dentition was given Rank 2. Rank 3 indicated extensive damage to larger areas
with near obliteration of more than one surface.
Bone pathologies that can be seen on cranial remains are described in Ortner and
Putschar (1981), Steele and Bramblett (1988), and Steinbock (1976). Cribra
orbitalia, described as a porosity of the outer table of the orbit, is caused by
expansion of hemopoietic tissue and represents the body's compensation for
anemia. It may be the first lesion in spongy hyperostosis, a condition known
from a thickening of the cranial bone, particularly the parietal, and porosity of
the outer table of thickened bone.
Treponemal disease may produce
characteristic star-shaped lesions on the skull, typically on the frontal, early in
the skull's response to infection. Later, massive gummatous periostitis covers
large areas of the skull. Arthritis may affect the mandibular joint, the vertebrae,
or the occipital condyles. It may be known by the deposition of fine-grained bone
on the articular surfaces or by deformation of the surface.
Developmental
abnormalities occasionally show up as unusual conformation of the bone. One
developmental abnormality is premature cranial synostosis, also known as
craniostenosis, where the cranial sutures fuse before the brain has completed its

15

growth. Premature fusion results in abnormally thin cranial bone which bears
strongly-marked impressions of the cerebral contours (Ortner and Putschar 1981).
The condition is associated with various genetic syndromes or may occur as an
isolated symptom of genetic defect. Craniostenosis may also result from trauma
before or shortly after birth (Beighton 1978).
Cultural Practices
One cultural trait that leaves evidence on the skeleton is artificial cranial
deformation. This practice among the Maya was recorded by Landa and its
prevalence documented by many archaeologists. It was accomplished, according
to Landa (Pagden 1975), during the first four or five days of a child's life. Boards
were tightly pressed to the infant's forehead and back of the head and bound
there until the head remained flat. Landa believed it to be a cruel and lifethreatening practice; he saw one infant whose skull had opened behind the ears
and inferred that many must have suffered the same fate.
It might be expected that deforming a cranium risks damaging its contents, but
little is known about the actual danger, perhaps because the population of living
individuals with artificial deformation is so small. The practice frequently caused
the child's eyes to protrude and become bloodshot and has been indicted for
potential damage to the optic nerve. Whether or not the brain is damaged by the
pressure is not known (Dingwall 1931).
A difficulty in studying cranial deformation is that poor preservation and
fragmentation of remains makes its presence or absence undetectable in many
Maya skeletons, including some represented here. In some instances, fortunately,
enough of the braincase or even a single cranial bone is present to show unusual
contours. Where the deformation could be seen, classification was attempted
using Imbelloni and Dembo's 1938 categories of Tabula Erect, Tabula Oblique,
and Annular (as presented in Comas and Marquer 1969). In the Tabular Erect
deformation, the upper part of the occipital and adjacent portions of the parietals
are flattened vertically, so that the back of the head is perpendicular to the
Frankfort anatomical plane. The Tabular Oblique deformation affects the lower
part of the occipital bone as well, flattening it and forcing the back of the head
into a plane which slants posteriorly. The Annular type of deformation is
produced by tight bands encircling the skull above the ears without the use of
boards. This type of deformation produces a skull with grooves on the sides and
elevation of the back of the head (Stewart 1974). Annular deformation is further
subdivided into erect and oblique classes.
Another cultural trait Maya skulls sometimes present is tooth mutilation by
filing. Landa noted the practice among women, and said that it was produced by
old women using certain stones and water. The filing of adult teeth had been
documented for the Colha skull pit sample by Steele et al. (1980). The presence
of tooth filing was noted in the present analysis and its style classed according to
Romero's (1970) categories. The three general categories used in this study were
A, B, and C, all concerned with alteration of the crown contour. Group A
includes those styles that affect only the incisal or occlusal edge. Group B
comprises styles that mutilate one of the angles or corners of the crown. Group C

16
styles have both angles similarly affected.
Post-mortem Treatment
Cut Marks
One of the last characteristics to be examined on the skulls themselves is the
evidence for butchering of the skulls. The pattern of cut marks was noted and
possible activities associated with these marks was inferred. Many suggestions
must be, of course, only speculative, but it was possible to learn from the cut
marks another aspect of the role the skull pit deaths played in the ancient Colha
culture. From Landa's account it seems that any of three activities was sufficient
to explain the intensive processing of human remains which could have left cut
marks on the skeleton. First, to perform a ritual in an important religious
ceremony; second, to signify military victory; and third, to provide funeral
services appropriate for a person of high status.
Burning of the Bone
Another post-mortem treatment of the material was burning. The extent of the
practice and its place in the sequence of mortuary activities was examined.
Burial Levels
The Colha skull pit burial had two layers of skulls, and one might expect the
placement of skulls within the pit to have some meaning which would be
indicated by an imbalance of biological or cultural traits between the two layers.
The distribution of age, sex, cranial deformation, and tooth filing was examined
to see if different patterns existed between the two layers.
A statistical test of the randomness of the distribution between the two layers
would have been desirable to help determine whether differences· between the
layers were probably due to chance or design. Unfortunately, the small sample
size meant that subdivisions of it, such as the number of old adults expected in
the upper layer, were too small for statistical tests to be appropriate.

RESULTS
Demography
The osteological analysis resulted in several kinds of information about the life
and death of the individuals whose heads were interred in the skull pit. It
revealed the demographic composition of the sample, gave clues to some of the
individuals' state of health, and demonstrated the variation in cultural
modification of the skeleton. Last, it documented a typically Mesoamerican
procedure of treating human remains.
The skull pit skeletal material was found to comprise the remains of 30 human
beings. Twenty-eight individuals are represented, at least in fragments, by
cranium and mandible and 22 of these have associated cervical vertebrae or
vertebral fragments. For two individuals represented by cranium, mandible, and
cervical vertebrae, the hyoid also was preserved. One person is represented by
facial bones, the mandible, and one vertebra, but no bones of the skull vault.
Another is represented only by a mandibular fragment. Some of the cervical
vertebral material was preserved in such very small fragments that it was not
possible to determine which vertebrae they were from. Associated with one skull,
GG, fragments of four cervical vertebrae were found from at least two individuals
of different size.
Commingling of the fragmented sample did occur, to some extent, not only with
adjacent skulls but also between those separated by half the diameter of the pit.
For example, a mandibular fragment originally considered part of Skull S was
found to fit Skull A, more than 40 cm away in the same layer. In many
instances, it was possible to place commingled fragments with the proper skull.
In some cases, though, it was not possible to determine where a given fragment
belonged, as in the association of the above-mentioned vertebral fragments with
Skull GG. In general, once a vertebral fragment became separated from the skull
to which it belonged it could not be identified with a particular individual.
Demographic information is summarized in Table 1, which categorizes the skulls
by sex and age. Of the 20 skulls that represented adults, 10 were found to be
female, eight were considered male, and two could not be determined. Sex of the
10 juveniles could not be determined because sexual dimorphism of the cranium
is not apparent before maturity. Of the adults, three were considered young
adults, 13 were classed simply as adult, and four were categorized as old adult.
Two of the young adults were male and one was female; six adults were female,
five were male, and two could not be determined. Only one old adult was male;
the other three were female.
The skull pit population showed a great deal of individual variation in robusticity.
Sexual dimorphism at its most distinct is shown in Figure 1. Much of the Colha
material was more ambiguous. Some males had large mastoid processes; some
females had small ones; but many of both sexes had mastoid processes that were
moderately large. Both sexes tended to have long zygomatic crests that extended
back past the ears, although on some males this crest was more sharply marked.
Determining the sex of these individuals finally had to rest on one characteristic

The 10 juveniles ranged in age from about six months to six or seven years. Two
infants were less than one year old and three older children were between 18 and
30 months. Four juveniles were between three and five years of age, and one
was six or seven.
Adult Tooth Wear
Table 2 shows the distribution of average tooth wear in adults by age and sex.
No trend toward a sex difference can be seen in this data. Individual variation is
pronounced, with the general category "Adult" including average tooth wear
ranging from Stage One through Stage Four. However, no young adult showed
greater wear than Stage Two and only old adults showed average wear as
advanced as Stage Five. These findings seem to confirm the assumptions that
tooth wear increases with age but cannot be used to give precise age estimates.
Arranging the 11 cleaned adult mandibles in a series of increasing tooth wear as
judged from the entire dentition conflicted with the groupings produced above in
only one instance. Ranking one of the Stage Two mandibles at Stage Three

would have produced groupings similar to the seriation. The absence of serious
conflict between averaging tooth wear and seriation is taken to confirm the
usefulness of the averaging procedure.
Dental Pathology
Table 3 shows dental pathology observed in the skull pit adults. The most
prevalent pathological condition, affecting 19 individuals, was calculus deposits.
Next in frequency was caries, which affiicted 15 adults. Of these 15, 11 were
rated for caries severity at Rank 3, the most severe, one was ranked at 2 and
three were ranked at 1. Eleven individuals lost teeth before death, and one more
had either just lost teeth or was in the process of losing them at time of death.
Seven showed signs of enamel hypoplasia. Alveolar abscess affiicted six adults,
and periodontal disease affected two or possibly three. These two conditions are
more likely to be underreported than the other dental pathologies because the
fragile alveolar margins, which retain evidence of these lesions, are less likely to
be preserved in this material than sturdier bone or teeth. Examples of adult
dental pathology, some associated with alveolar infection, are shown in Figure 2.
Some infrequent, atypical dental traits among the adults included rotation of

premolars out of normal position, unusual occlusion and attrition, and impaction
of a third molar. Each of three skulls presented one of these conditions.
Table 4 shows dental pathology in children. Seven of the juvenile skulls showed
evidence of dental caries. Of the three (EE, F, GG) that were free from caries,
one had no erupted teeth preserved, so its actual dental health is unknown. The
other two ranged in estimated age between seven months and two years and
probably had not been weaned before death (see Pagden 1975). Skulls C and Z,
however, are considered to be the same age as Skull F or just slightly older and
probably had not been weaned either, but they have caries ratings of 2 and 1,
respectively. No doubt other foods had been added to these older babies' milk
diet, yet it seems surprising that an unweaned child would already have tooth
decay. Four children had a caries rating of two; one was one and one-half to two
and one-half; two were around four years of age; and one was six or seven. The
two children with the worst teeth, rated as 3, were approximately the same age,
three to four years old and three to five years old. Figure 3, A shows the carious
damage observed in Skull D, representing a child between three and five years of
age at time of death. These dentitions showed large amounts of destruction.

23

Several of their lower premolars, for example, had only enamel outlines left of
their occlusal surfaces. Furthermore, probably the skull pit children had even
more caries than is recorded here, because not all the teeth were preserved.
Several of these missing teeth may have had varying degrees of decay.

Some of the children's skulls presented other dental pathology in addition to
caries: enamel hypoplasia, unusual notching on incisors, and tooth fusion or
gemination. Skull Y and Skull Z showed definite evidence of enamel hypoplasia.
Their ages at death ranged from one and one-half to five years of age. In each,
the insult to enamel development occurred early in life: at the age of six to nine
months for Skull Y, and at about nine months for Skull Z. Figure 3, B shows the
horizontal hypoplastic grooves seen on the tooth bud for Skull Y's lower right first
permanent molar. Skull D may possibly have had hypoplasia on some of the
anterior deciduous teeth stemming from arrested enamel development before
birth or shortly thereafter. These teeth have extensive carious lesions, some of
them transverse.
Two of the juvenile skulls (D and W) show an unusual form of shallow notching
on one or more incisors or incisor buds. Congenital syphilis often produces a more
pronounced notching, but at least one worker (Pindborg 1970) attributes shallow
notching to syphilis as well. However, both skulls have normally shaped incisors,
too, and since treponemal infection typically affects the shape of several teeth, it
is probably not implicated here. Skull D's notched permanent mandibular incisor
bud is shown in Figure 3, C.
Skull W also presented unusual lower deciduous incisors (Figure 3, D) which are
quite broad and have a central notch on the incisal surface continuous with a

24

deep lingual groove. Light microscope inspection revealed no sharp edges to the
grooves or other signs of cultural modification. One of these teeth fit quite well
into the partial alveolus for the right lateral deciduous incisor. If the mandible
were reconstructed with these teeth in the lateral incisor position, a small
diastema would separate them. Tooth fusion or tooth gemination is suggested as
the origin of the lower deciduous incisors' aberrant form. The number of teeth
and their spacing here suggest that the incisors were fused, not geminated.
However, the roots appear to be single, so gemination is a possibility. Both of
these conditions are most often seen in mandibular deciduous incisors (Colby et
al. 1971).
One dental condition needs additional discussion because it may have implications
of disease epidemics or nutritional stress. This condition is enamel hypoplasia,
the insufficient production of enamel during a period of tooth growth, which
indicates the presence of severe physical stress at that time. It is common in the
skull pit sample, being positively identified in nine dentitions and possibly
indicated in one more. Figure 3, B shows a child's hypoplastic lower right first
permanent molar bud which has two horizontal lines indicating at least two
discrete periods of stress.
Table 5 lists the distribution of hypoplasia in the sample and its association with
bone pathology. Two old adults, one male, one female, showed evidence of
hypoplasia. Four adults, one male, two female, and one of unknown sex, also had
these lesions. In addition, one young female adult and two children suffered this
pathology, and one other child possibly had the condition. Apparently there was
no sex difference in susceptibility and no change through time in the physical
stress applied to younger members of the population.
One might expect the hypoplasia and bone pathology to occur in the same
individuals under certain kinds of stressful conditions. For example, severe
malnutrition or serious disease might be expected to leave signs on both teeth
and bone. Such a coincidence did not occur in this sample. Of the nine
individuals with definite hypoplastic teeth, two also had definite bone pathology
and two others had possible bone lesions. Yet, only one of these lesions, possible
cribra orbitalia in a child's skull, might conceivably have resulted from an anemia
produced by the same agent that caused the hypoplasia. The other three lesions a possibly infected palate, a small developmental anomaly, and deformation of
the temporomandibular joint - could not reasonably be connected with hypoplasia.
These findings leave hypoplasia in this sample as the single remaining evidence
of physical stress in early childhood.

Bone Pathology
Bone pathology in adults included infection of the bone, joint deformation,
developmental anomalies, and cribra orbitalia.
In addition, some unusual
conditions of bone were found whose pathological status is difficult to assign.
Three skulls presented evidence of bone infection. One of them (Skull M) showed
signs of infection on the inner table of the occipital. Porosity and signs of

osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity were found there. Two other skulls (DD, II)
appear to have had porous subperiosteal bone deposited on the medial aspects of
the mandibular rami up to the coronoid processes, as seen in Figure 4, B. The
infectious bone seemed to be continuous with that in the gumline and probably
was contemporaneous with an infection that accompanied the loss of mandibular
molars.
The
Skull V had an abnormality of the right temporomandibular joint.
mandibular condyle's lateral portion was flattened superiorly, hypertrophied, and
porous (Figure 4, A). The right glenoid fossa was greatly expanded anteriorly
and showed evidence of osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity near the articular
eminence. It is possible that the primary deformation was in the glenoid fossa,
and that the mandibular condyle became deformed through articulation with it.
The left temporomandibular joint was apparently not preserved in this uncleaned
skull.

27

A developmental anomaly was seen in Skull M. The frontal presented, on the
inner surface of the left orbit, a small tuberosity traversed by a fine crack, which
continued out to demarcate the temporal crest for a distance of about one
centimeter. There, the crack resembled a fold in the bone. No signs of trauma
were present.
A more extreme developmental aberration was premature fusion of the cranial
sutures. In Skull E, although the lambdoidal and squamosal sutures appeared
normal in the portions of the cranium that were recovered, the coronal suture
was completely fused and obliterated and the sagittal suture was about one-half
fused and obliterated. Even at the age of death, this individual was young to
exhibit such advanced fusion. In a large sample of American males, a substantial
percentage of individuals with completely closed coronal sutures first appeared in
the age group 26 - 27. This is also the youngest age group to show fusion of onehalf the sagittal suture in a large percentage (40 percent). Fusion advanced as
that seen in Skull E did appear among 1 7 - 18 year-olds, but it was rare (McKern
and Stewart 1957). Further, Skull E became fused many years before the age of
death. The cranial bone was thinner than that of other adults in the collection,
and impressions from the cerebrum, unusual in adult bone, remained on large
parts of the frontal and parietals. Both of these conditions indicate premature
synostosis, or fusion, of the cranial sutures. This developmental disorder causes
the cranial bones to unite, preventing further expansion of cranial capacity,
before the brain has completed its growth. Since the bone thinning here is not
extreme; that is, it is thicker than that of Skull CC, the oldest juvenile in the
sample, and since the cranium does not show extreme distortion, probably the
fusion began not long before the brain ceased growing. It is not known whether
or not premature synostosis was harmful to this particular individual's health.
Problems that may result from craniostenosis include protopsis, visual
disturbances, and impaired growth and development of the brain (Beighton
1978). Another abnormality of this bone is cribra orbitalia, a porosity of the
orbital roof. Although often considered to indicate an anemia, here it is plausible
to think it may have been caused by the pressure exerted on the cranial bones by
the growing brain. An additional unusual feature is the gracility of the skull,
seen especially in the relative smoothness of the external occipital and in the
small size of the mastoid processes. Gracility is usually considered a female
characteristic and contrasts strikingly here with the rugosity and extremely large
size of the mandible. It seems reasonable that premature synostosis could
produce a smoother surface in the cranium, but it is not known if the size of the
mastoid processes can be influenced by the disorder or if there must be another
explanation for the disparity in robusticity.
Four individuals presented an unusual roughness of the palate which is
illustrated in Figure 4, C. It is not known whether the roughness is the result, in
one instance, of palatal fracture, of severe periodontal disease with infection of
the palate, or if it is merely a normal variation in palatal surface texture.
Bone pathology in children was limited to cribra orbitalia (Figure 4, D.). Two
skulls, I and Y, show signs of mild cribra orbitalia in one orbit. The other orbits
are missing in these skulls. Because few orbits are present in this poorly
preserved sample, the actual frequency of this pathology is unknown.
No signs of treponemal infection were found on any of the bone, adult or juvenile.

29
The absence of these lesions suggests that the notching of incisors in Skulls D and
W may not be due to congenital syphilis or other treponemal infection.
Cranial Deformation
Intentional cranial deformation was found in this sample as in many other Maya
skeletal collections. Eight skulls showed unmistakable deliberate modification of
the contours. Two other individuals, both children, showed ambiguous signs of
possible antemortem deformation; they are excluded from the following
discussion. Nine crania were definitely not deformed; the others could not be
assessed. Table 6 demonstrates this cultural trait's relation to other personal
characteristics. Two of the individuals with modified cranial shape were adult
females, five were adult males, and one was a child of three or four. Among the
adults, two were old, one was young, and four were unclassified adults. Three of
the adults with deformed skulls also had filed teeth, and four adults did not.
Apparently these two types of permanent decoration were independent. Two
individuals with culturally modified crania had enamel hypoplasia, indicating
some kind of physical stress at an early age, but the other six did not. It seems
that the practice of cranial deformation in this sample was independent of sex,
age, severe physical stress in early childhood, or of other cultural modification of
the cranium.

Two styles of cranial deformation are represented in the skull pit material. Five
skulls were shaped in the Tabula Erect style, illustrated in Figure 5, and at least
one was molded in the Tabula Oblique form. For two other skulls it was not
possible to discern the shape of the back of the head, from which the style is
named. These two crania exhibited abnormally sloping foreheads, though, and

30

are classed as intentionally deformed.

Tooth Filing
Another cultural trait for which evidence is commonly found in ancient Maya
collections is tooth filing. Filed teeth were found in the dentitions of nine
individuals, all adults, in the skull pit collection. These individuals exhibit
various styles of tooth modification which are categorized by Romero's (1970)
classification. Table 7 lists the skulls that show tooth filing, their ages and sex,
and identifies the styles of modification present. Two female old adults, four
male and one female adult, and two adults of unknown sex all had filed teeth.
None of the three young adults had teeth which were thus decorated.
Of those individuals who had filed teeth, all had upper central incisors modified
in Romero's B4 shape, where a square is removed from the distal corners. The
size and angles of the piece removed varied, but they all resembled the B4 class
more than any other. Other anterior teeth were more variable in filed shape
than the upper central incisors. Three skulls had teeth in the C3 shape, where
both mesial and distal corners were removed, leaving a rectangle of tooth
projecting from the center of the incisal edge. A fourth individual's teeth could be
classed only to Group C, indicating that both mesial and distal corners had been
modified in some way. Two crania exhibited teeth that had a "V" shape removed
from the middle of the incisive edge, according to Style Al, and two had teeth
filed straight across in the A4 style. Two dentitions showed teeth filed in the B7
shape, where the distal corner of the tooth is removed, but the edge filed in from
the distal side slants closer to the cemento-enamel junction. The various styles
are illustrated in Figure 6.
Although dentitions varied in filing shapes, it appeared that tooth position
limited the styles in this collection. All filed maxillary central incisors conformed
to the B4 style. One skull had maxillary canines in the B4 style as well, but no
other teeth exhibited this shape. B7 filing was seen only on maxillary canines,
and Al filing was found only on lower incisors. The C3 style, on the other hand,
appeared on upper and lower lateral incisors and canines. The A4 style shaped
upper lateral incisors and canines.
There is no evidence in this material that men and women had their teeth filed
differently or that there was a change through time in filing styles, as would be
suggested by a difference in styles between the old adults and the others. An
interesting question is whether or not the prevalence of tooth filing was changing
through time. About one-half of the old adults and adults in the sample had filed
teeth, but none of the young adults did. Unfortunately, the small size of the
sample precludes judging whether the absence of filing in the younger group
indicates that filing was performed later in life than the young adult stage, or
represents a change in cultural practice, or results merely from the vagaries of
sampling.

Post-mortem Treatment
Cut Marks
The most unusual feature of the skull pit skeletal material, one that makes
sample unique among Maya collections, is that the bone presented numerous
marks. The literature (Pagden 1975) chronicles flaying of sacrificial victims,
this sample is the first to document the practice in skeletal evidence. The
marks could be found on 20 of the 30 skulls. The other ten did not show

marks but had such damaged or encrusted surfaces that the skulls could not be
adequately examined for cuts. Figures 7 and 8 show some examples of the cut
marks.
Figures 9, 10, 11, and 12 are composite drawings of the cut marks observed on
1 7 cleaned skulls. Four other cleaned skulls did not exhibit cut marks, but one of
these was burned and the other three were badly eroded. The few marks that
could be observed on the uncleaned skulls were not included in the composite. No
single skull presented all the marks illustrated in the drawings; the average
number per skull of cut marks visible in frontal view, for example, was 1 7.
Nevertheless, the composite view may more accurately reflect the skulls'
condition shortly after death than do the discernible cut marks remaining on the
poorly preserved bone surface.
Many of the marks could have been made during the process of removing the
skin. These include long cuts around the skull vault and shorter marks around
the orbital rims and the external nasal aperture. Some of the marks, however,
would probably not have been made during a simple skinning operation. These
are cuts on the inside of the mandibular ramus, on the lower edge of the
zygomatic, and on the lower edge of the mandible. It appears that these cut
marks would more likely have been made while removing muscle, not just skin.
However, it is clear that the skulls, mandibles, and cervical vertebrae were not
disarticulated, because they were found in close anatomical association.
Deeper cuts were found on fragments of two cervical vertebrae. These appear to
represent unsuccessful efforts to decapitate the victim. Both of these vertebrae
were found associated with infant Skull GG, but they belonged to two individuals.
Charring of the Bone
One of the skulls (BB) was badly burned and two others had portions that were
charred. All three were buried in the lower layer. Authors of the preliminary
report (Steele et al. 1980) believed that the burning did not take place in the pit
because there was no charcoal or other evidence of fire. The destruction of the
building apparently was accompanied by fire, and it seems to have occurred
shortly after the skull burial. The post-burial fire, though, could not have
charred only a skull on the lower layer, left the upper layer unburned, and left no
sign of fire other than burned bone. The burning of Skull BB, then, must have
been a separate event prior to burial.
Burial Levels
Table 8 shows the age and sex distribution and the frequencies of cranial
deformation and tooth filing within each of the two layers which comprised the
skull pit burial. Skull II, whose provenience within the pit is not known, has
been excluded from the table and the following discussion. There were 13
individuals in the upper level and 16 in the lower. The table reveals only one
major difference, the greater number of older individuals in the upper level and

in the sample were buried in the upper level, all three of the young adults were

seven in the lower.

The different frequencies of females in the two levels may be misleading.
According to the remaining skeletal evidence, the upper level had seven females
while the lower level had only three. This disparity derives only from the
individuals of known sex. Since two of the adults and all of the subadults are of
unknown sex, it is possible that the sex ratios in each layer were similar.
The cultural characteristics, cranial deformation and tooth filing, are about
evenly distributed between the two layers. Five individuals in the upper level
and three in the lower showed definite cranial deformation. Two children in the
lower level showed ambiguous signs of deformation and are excluded from the
category. If they had been included, cranial deformation would seem to have
been equally prevalent in the two layers. The other cultural trait examined,
tooth filing, appeared in the dentitions of four individuals in each layer, again

42
suggesting no difference between the levels.

SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS
The results of the osteological investigation gave an overall picture of the sample,
and in addition showed some of the circumstances surrounding the death and
burial of the victims. This chapter summarizes the analysis and then addresses
the questions Steele posed in the preliminary report: Who were the victims, and
why were they killed?
The Colha skull pit contained the cranial remains of 20 adults, of both sexes and
a wide range of ages, and 10 young children. The absence of children and
teenagers between the ages of six or seven and eighteen suggests that the group
of skulls did not comprise the remains of actual nuclear families. This is the only
age group not represented. However, the nearly equal numbers of adult males,
adult females, and children suggest a symbolic meaning to the demographic
composition of the burial.
Osteological examination of the skeletal material revealed no signs of widespread
serious disease or malnutrition. The frequency of caries, though, was high, even
among young children. Adult dentitions showed a great deal of calculus and
antemortem tooth loss, findings not unexpected in an agricultural population
lacking modern dentistry. Definitive evidence of syphilis or other treponemal
infection was not found either in adults or children. However, inconclusive signs
of possible congenital treponemal disease were found in the juvenile dentition.
Synchronous variation in cultural modification of the skeleton proved to be
considerable. Some crania were molded in the Tabula Erect style, some in the
Tabula Oblique manner, and some were not deformed at all. Several adults and
old adults of both sexes had filed teeth, but the styles varied somewhat, and
several adults did not have their teeth artificially shaped. None of the three
young adults had filed teeth. Perhaps the practice was dying out, or perhaps it
was the custom to have teeth filed at some time after the young adult period. Or
possibly the sample of young adults in the skull pit was not representative of that
age group in the greater Maya population.
This last concern leads naturally to a larger question about the skull pit
collection; namely, what population does it represent? It would be interesting to
know if they were residents of Colha, or prisoners of war from the surrounding
areas, or defeated invaders or defenders of the settlement. Unfortunately, there
is no way to make such a determination solely from an analysis of the skull pit
material. One would need to compare the characteristics of this group with those
of individuals buried elsewhere at Colha. Analysis of most of the other Colha
material has not yet been performed; and, unfortunately, the poor preservation
of the bone may preclude the kind of detailed analysis that might show
population affinities. However, it is safe to say, as Steele did in his preliminary
report (Steele et al. 1980), that some of the skull pit individuals show the
cultural traits of artificial cranial deformation and tooth filing which have
previously been documented as Maya. It is probably the case, then, that at least
these individuals were Maya, though we cannot answer whether or not they were
residents of Colha.
The other question of great interest is, why were these individuals killed? They
43

44

did not die of natural causes but rather were killed at approximately the same
time, decapitated, and the heads then flayed and buried together next to the
stairway of a monumental structure. The best guesses for the reason they were
killed are either that they were sacrificed for religious reasons or that they
represented a ruling class or an elite lineage which was violently deposed.
Reasonable arguments can be constructed in favor of each scenario.
The following observations support the idea that the burial represented religious
sacrifice:
1. First, the demographic composition of the sample resembles a group of nuclear
families. Yet, they are probably not actual nuclear families, as indicated by the
absence of older children and teenagers. Therefore, the significance of the group's
composition must lie in the symbolism of the pattern. Symbolic behavior is an
essential aspect of religious ceremony and would be expected in a sacrifice.
2. The remains of the victims were handled in a manner compatible with Maya
sacrifice. They were decapitated, skinned or butchered, possibly displayed on
ceramics, and buried in a location which may well have had religious significance.
Landa's (Pagden 1975:84) account of Maya human sacrifice does not conflict with
the skull pit findings:
Sometimes they performed this sacrifice on the stone and high
altar of the temple and then threw the body, now dead, down the
steps of the temple. The officials picked it up at the bottom and
flayed it all, save for the feet and hands. Then the priest stripped
stark naked, and covered himself with that skin while the others
danced with him; and this was a matter of great solemnity for them.
They usually buried these sacrificial victims in the courtyard of the
temple, otherwise they ate them, dividing the bodies up among the
lords and others who were present. And they held these sacrificial
victims as saints.
Furthermore, some of the cut marks cannot be accounted for by flaying. Perhaps
they represent removal, subsequent to skinning, of certain soft tissue - the eyes,
nose and tongue, for example - for use in a separate offering. It must be
admitted that collections of soft tissue as offerings are not mentioned in the
literature, and naturally they would not be preserved. However, caches of teeth
have been recorded (Pendergast et al. 1968; Saul and Hammond 1974), showing
that an offering might consist of similar portions of several individuals.
3. The layers of skulls within the burial may have shown a pattern based on
deference and respect. All of the old adults were in the upper layer; all of the
young adults were in the lower layer. Landa reported that "The young people
greatly revered the old . . . The old were so highly esteemed that the young
people had no contact with them except when such contact was unavoidable . . . "
(Pagden 1975:87). One might argue that the arrangement of adult skulls with
respect to age actually was random, and that inferences from the arrangement
are inappropriate. On the other hand, if the victims' remains were handled, from
a Maya point of view, with the same respect that was accorded the individuals
during life, then the burial does not likely indicate that they represented a hated

45
ruling class or a foreign enemy.
4. One of the skulls was extensively burned and two others were partially
burned. Fire has no known association with human sacrifice among the Maya,
but Landa (Pagden 1975:94-95) noted that it was used in mortuary practices for
certain high-status persons:
They burned the bodies of lords and of people of high esteem and
placed the ashes in large urns and built temples over them as those
which were found in Yzmal demonstrated was done formerly.
Recently it was discovered that when the dead man was a very great
lord they secreted his ashes in a hollow statue made of clay. The
other chieftains made wooden statues for their fathers, leaving the
back of the neck hollow. They then burned a part of his body and
put the ashes in there and sealed it. Afterwards they stripped the
skin from the back of the neck of the dead man and pasted it in
place, burying the rest according to their custom. They kept the
statues with great reverence among the idols. They used to cut off
the heads of the old Cocom lords when they died, and after cooking
them cleaned them of flesh and then sawed off half of the skull from
the crown back, leaving the front part with the jawbone and teeth.
They replaced the flesh that was lacking from these half-skulls with
a certain bitumen and modeled them into a perfect likeness of those
whose skulls they had been. And they then preserved them with the
statues full of ashes. These were all kept together with their idols,
in the oratories of their houses, in great reverence and respect ...
The lengthy quotation above sheds little light on why the skull pit victims were
killed. But it does portray both burning and cutting of human remains as a way
of showing respect, and suggests that these practices would not be inappropriate
in treating the remains of religious human sacrifice.
While it seems that there are several reasons to believe that the burial represents
religious sacrifice rather than political upheaval, equally reasonable objections
can be made to this point of view:
1. Archaeological evidence shows that shortly after the skull pit burial, the
structure with which it was associated burned and fell. Field notes indicate that
the fill within the pit was the same as that above the terrace floor, suggesting
that the skulls were not deliberately buried. But, they were not disturbed by
scavengers, as they would have been if the pit had been exposed. The accidental
covering of the pit by the falling structure above must have occurred almost
immediately after placing the skulls in the pit. The structure was not rebuilt.

2. Classic Maya culture at Colha came to an abrupt end shortly after the skull
pit burial (Eaton 1980). The population was much smaller and monumental
building ceased. The Postclassic occupants may have been Maya, but their
culture was quite distinct from an archaeological perspective compared with that
of the Late Classic residents.
3. The butchering of the skulls may not have been reverential. Rather, the
skulls may have served as war trophies for invaders.
Some of Landa's

46
observations about sacrificial victims (Pagden 1975) are compatible with the
notion of processed skulls as trophies: "If they ... were slaves captured in war,
their lord would carry off their bones to use them as a fetish in their dances as a
sign of victory." Also, "After the victory they removed the jawbones of the dead
men and wore them stripped of flesh on their arms."
4. The burning of Skull BB and charring of other skulls may not have been a
gesture of respect. It may rather have been a spontaneous expression of
contempt for a deposed ruling class.
It is clear from the foregoing considerations that the evidence is insufficient to
identify positively the reason for the skull pit deaths. It may have been religious
sacrifice; it may have been political defeat; or it may have been a still undetected
purpose. Hypotheses about the motivations of behavior are difficult to test in
general; they are often impossible to test archaeologically. Nevertheless, if other
Maya skull caches are found and analyzed, perhaps reasons for the deaths will
become more clear.

APPENDIX A
DESCRIPTION OF THE SKULLS
The following descriptions identify the skulls by the catalog letters the
archaeologists assigned in the field. Certain letters are missing from the present
alphabetical sequence because at some point material so designated was found to
belong to another skull or was judged not to be human bone.
SKULL A
Burial level: Upper.
Sex: Female. This judgment is based on the gracility. of the mandible and the
--small size of the right mastoid process.
Age: Old adult. This skull shows extensive antemortem tooth loss. The average
wear on teeth which could be examined is Stage Four.
Material ~resent: The reconstructed skull comprises most of the braincase,
mand1b e, and the palatal portion of the right maxilla. The first cervical
vertebra is also present. In addition, three loose teeth were found with Skull
A which do not seem to belong to it and are not included in the analysis. The
mandible contains three teeth; the maxilla, four.
Teeth present: R 11, I 2 ,

c-,

P 3 ; L C_, P 3 , P 4

Pathology:
Teeth: This individual suffered from antemortem tooth loss, caries, calculus,
and possibly from periodontal disease. In the mandible, healed and resorbed
bone in the left molar region and in the right second and third molar area
reveal antemortem loss of these teeth. A shallow alveolus for the lower right
first molar may indicate that the individual was in the process of losing this
. tooth at time of death. Similarly, in the right maxilla, a shallow expanded
alveolus suggests that the first molar was in the process of infectious evulsion
at the time of death or was lost shortly before death. All that remains of the
upper right fourth premolar is a root fragment, the rest of the tooth
apparently having succumbed to carious activity. Spicules of bone stand
between the upper right lateral incisor and the canine, possibly the result of
localized periodontal infection.
Caries rating: 3
Bone: No pathology is noted on those regions of bone which have not been
chemically eroded.
Cranial deformation:
The back part of this skull is moderately flattened
vertically m the Tabula Erect style. The frontal appears undeformed.
Tooth modification:

Three right maxillary teeth have been culturally modified.

54

55

The central incisor has been filed to remove its distal corner, as in Romero's
style B4. The lateral incisor and the canine seem to have been filed to remove
both mesial and distal corners, in conformity to Romero's style group C. These
teeth are extremely worn, so their outlines in earlier life are merely suggested,
not revealed.
Cut marks: Cut marks are present on both orbital rims and between the orbits
on the frontal, on the inferior surface and right ascending ramus of the
mandible, and above the mastoid process on the right temporal.
SKULL B
Burial level: Upper.
Sex: Female. This judgment is based on the gracility of the mandible.
Age: Adult. Antemortem tooth loss, though present, is not extensive enough to
mdicate old age. The average wear on the six teeth which could be evaluated
is Grade Four.
Material present: Although this material could not be cleaned for exhaustive
exammation, it can be seen that about two-thirds of the braincase is present
surrounding a dirt ball. Most of the face is preserved as a single articulated
structure. The mandible containing seven teeth, the left maxilla with six
teeth, and loose teeth were also recovered to make the total of 20 teeth
preserved. In addition the first two cervical vertebrae are present.
Teeth present: R I 2,

M3

c_, P3, p 4

Pathology:
Teeth: Dental pathology in this specimen includes caries, enamel hypoplasia,
and antemortem tooth loss. Extensive caries at the cementa-enamel junction
invaded much of the interior of several teeth: the lower right first molar,
lower left canine, upper left fourth premolar, and the upper left third molar.
Further, the entire crown. and part of the root of the lower right central incisor
has been destroyed, possibly by caries. The occlusal surfaces of the teeth that
could be examined are generally not carious, though; two small lesions on the
lower right first molar are the only occlusal caries noted. Hypoplastic grooves,
one of them very pronounced, are present on the upper left central incisor.
Shallow hypoplastic grooves appear on the upper left second incisor and canine
and on the upper right canine. This individual also suffered the antemortem
loss of the lower right second and third molars and probably at least two more
teeth in addition.
Caries rating: 3
Bone: The bone surface was covered with dirt and preservative and could not
be evaluated for pathology.

56

Cranial deformation: The frontal is artificially flattened in an oblique plane,
producing a slopmg forehead, but the deformation cannot be classified since, in
the present condition of the material, the other contours of the cranium cannot
be discerned. Photographs taken in the field, however, show that the style is
Tabula Oblique.
Tooth modification: Cannot be determined.
Cut marks: Cannot be determined.
SKULL C
Burial level: Upper.
Sex: Unknown.
~ Eighteen months to two and one-half years. This assessment is estimated
----U-om tooth wear and development and the calcification of permanent tooth
buds. Confirmation that the child was less than three or four is given by the
absence of fusion between the exoccipitals and the squama of the occipital.
Also, lack of fusion in the atlas vertebra shows that the individual was less
than six to eight years old.

Material present: Skull C is so badly fragmented and damaged that neither the
face nor the braincase can be reconstructed, although all bones of the
braincase are represented.
Some fragments have a smooth, relatively
undamaged surface, but many others are badly eroded or encrusted with
matrix that cannot be removed. Two small fragments of right and left
maxillae, each with one tooth, are present in addition to several loose teeth.
Postcranially, four unfused fragments remain from at least two cervical
vertebrae.

Remarks: Skull C dentition is a composite of archaeological finds from the skull
pit. F'ive different tooth assemblages, only one of which appeared initially to
belong to Skull C, seem to represent a single individual. Since the teeth are
comparable in size and development, and because right and left counterparts,
though in different assemblages, look so much alike, the teeth were put
together and assumed to be the remains of one individual. Of course, although
it is improbable, these teeth may actually represent more than one individual.
SKULL D
Burial level: Lower.
Sex: Unknown.
~ Development of the permanent tooth buds suggests an age at death of

portions of the occipital may indicate an age of less than three or four.
Further, an unfused right neural arch of the atlas vertebra points to an age at
death of less than six to eight years.

small maxillary fragments containing teeth and several loose teeth are
preserved.

Pathology:
Teeth: This individual suffered from caries, possible enamel hypoplasia, and
malformation of the teeth. The deciduous mandibular teeth in Skull D show
scarcely any wear but they are severely decayed. Extremely large occlusal
lesions have destroyed much of the interior of all four premolars, leaving
enamel shells. Both canines appear to have small carious lesions at their
points of contact with the lateral incisors, and very small cavities apparently
pit the buccal surfaces of the anterior premolars. Only the occlusal caries,
however, can be distinguished with assurance from postmortem etching. Like
the mandibular dentition, the maxillary deciduous teeth have undergone
severe carious attack. Caries almost encircles the central incisors, leaving only
the mesial and mesial-lingual surfaces intact. The left lateral incisor has large
labial and lingual cavities while the right lateral incisor looks scooped out from
its incisal edge. About half of the middle portion of this crown has been
destroyed. Dental hypoplasia stemming from growth arrest before or shortly
after birth may have predisposed these anterior teeth to carious destruction.
In even worse condition than the maxillary anterior teeth is the left anterior
premolar, in which a carious lesion destroyed all the dentin in the crown and
continued into the roots, exposing all three pulp cavities. Only a shallow
remnant shell of enamel partially delineates the crown.
The posterior
premolars are in somewhat better condition, but they too have multiple
occlusa] carious lesions. Postmortem etching precludes assessment of buccal
pitting on these teeth. The left canine is the healthiest of the maxillary teeth;
its only cavity is a pit on the lingual surface.
Most of the mandibular teeth are well-formed, although a shallow notch
can be seen on the incisal surface of the central incisors and a deeper one is
present on the right first permanent incisor tooth bud. This surface on the left
first permanent incisor bud is hidden from view, so notching there cannot be
determined. Congenital syphilis often produces a more pronounced type of
notching on anterior teeth, and the degree of notching on this tooth is similar
to that attributed to syphilis by Pindborg (1970). The right lateral incisor bud
has a normally shaped crown, though; and since treponemal infection typically
affects the shape of several teeth, it is probably not implicated here. Two of
the maxillary teeth have unusual shapes as well. The left canine's distal slope
is concave, creating a sharp point in the middle of the incisive surface. There
is no indication that this tooth was filed. The small premolar bud also shows
an unusual morphology in that it has a lingual conule behind the buccal cusp.
These shapes are probably of no pathological significance.

~ Young adult. The lower third molars are present as unerupted teeth, while
--uie upper third molars are erupted. One of these maxillary third molars is
preserved, and it shows no wear. The average wear on teeth that could be
evaluated is Stage Two. Further confirmation of the age assessment comes
from a basioccipital fragment which shows that fusion with the sphenoid was
not complete and may not even have commenced. This suture is completely
fused by age 21.

Material present: A large portion of the braincase is reconstructed from small
fragments, as is the right side of the face. Part of the left maxilla is also
present, and the mandible is preserved almost in entirety. Many other small
fragments, including those of at least the first two cervical vertebrae, are also
present. The bone is clean, but part of the surface is chemically eroded.
Teeth present: All teeth are preserved except the upper right lateral incisor
and third molar.
Pathology:
Teeth: This dentition has several small occlusal carious lesions and some light
calculus deposits but is otherwise sound. The unerupted lower right third
molar has an unusual accessory cusp on the hypoconid, but the cusp probably
does not represent a pathological condition.
Caries rating: 1
Bone: Three abnormalities or unusual conditions are noted in this skull: early
fusion of the cranial sutures, cribra orbitalia, and a disparity in robusticity
between the mandible and the braincase. Although the lambdoidal and
squamosal sutures appear normal in the portions of the cranium that were
recovered, the coronal suture is completely fused and obliterated and the
sagittal suture is about one-half fused and obliterated. Among American
males, fusion of the coronal suture is not complete in large numbers of
individuals before the age of 26; even then more than half the coronal sutures
are not completely closed. Skull E, representing a young adult, would not be
expected to show any signs of fusion. The cranial bone is thinner than that of
other adults in the collection, and impressions from the cerebrum, unusual in
adult bone, remain on large parts of the frontal and parietals. Both of these
conditions indicate premature synostosis or fusion of the cranial sutures, a
developmental disorder that causes the cranial bones to unite, preventing
further expansion of cranial capacity, before the brain has completed its
growth. Pressure of the growing brain on the resistant cranium thins the bone
and leaves cerebral impressions on the inner table. Since the bone thinning
here is not extreme; that is, it is thicker than that of Skull CC, the oldest
juvenile in the sample, and since the cranium does not show extreme
distortion, probably the fusion began not long before the brain ceased growing.

60

It is not known whether or not premature synostosis was harmful to this
particular individual's health. Another abnormality of this bone is cribra
orbitalia, a porosity of the orbital roof. Although often considered to indicate
an anemia, here it is plausible to think it may have been caused by the
pressure exerted on the cranial bones by the growing brain. An additional
unusual feature is the gracility of the skull, seen especially in the relative
smoothness of the external occipital and in the small size of the mastoid
processes. Gracility is usually considered a female characteristic and contrasts
strikingly here with the rugosity and extremely large size of the mandible. It
seems reasonable that premature synostosis could produce a smoother surface
on the outer table of the cranium, but it is not known if the size of the mastoid
processes can be influenced by the disorder or if there must be another
explanation for the disparity in robusticity.

Cranial deformation:
It could not be determined in this developmentally
abnormal skull if artificial cranial deformation had taken place.
Tooth modification: The teeth are not filed.
Cut marks: Cut marks are present on the ascending rami and inferior surface of
the mandible, on both zygomatics around the orbits, the anterior surfaces and
the right zygomatic arch, and at various places on the braincase.
SKULL F
Burial level: Upper.
Sex: Unknown.
~
Eighteen months to two years.
This assessment is based on the
-----Uevelopment of the deciduous teeth and the permanent tooth buds in addition
to the degree of wear. The anterior deciduous premolars in Skull F show little
wear and the posterior deciduous premolars have no wear at all. Other
indicators of age include the unfused condition of the atlas vertebra, showing
that the individual was less than six to eight years old, and the lack of fusion
between the exoccipital and basal portions of the occipital, suggesting that the
child was less than five or six years old at time of death.

Material present:
The sparse remains of this individual do not permit
reconstrucfaon of the braincase or face. The right orbital portion of the frontal,
both petrosals, fragments of one parietal, and one occipital condyle can be
identified. Both zygomatics, two fragments of maxillae, and loose teeth are
preserved from the face.
The mandibular body, surprisingly, is nearly
complete. Two unfused neural arches represent at least one cervical vertebra.
All fragments are eroded and matrix encrusted.

processes.
Age: Adult. The permanent teeth are erupted and most are retained. Average
wear on teeth that could be evaluated is Stage Two ..
Material present: Most of the braincase, face, mandible, first two cervical
vertebrae and the hyoid are preserved or reconstructed from fragments. The
bone is clean, but large areas are chemically eroded.
Teeth present: All permanent teeth are present except for the lower left third
premolar and all third molars.
Pathology:
Teeth: This individual suffered from antemortem tooth loss, caries, enamel
hypoplasia, calculus, and abnormal tooth position. Resorbed alveolar bone in
the third molar regions shows that all four of these teeth were lost before
death. The lower left third premolar was also lost antemortem. Caries
destroyed the entire crown of the left first molar and about one-third of the
crown of the right first molar; in each, the lesion destroyed part of the root.
Small occlusal regions of caries are present on the lower right second and
upper right first molars. The maxillary anterior teeth show, on their labial
surfaces, pitting and groove formation characteristic of enamel hypoplasia.
This condition may possibly exist on other teeth as well but be obscured by

62
postmortem etching. A moderate amount of calculus coats all mandibular
teeth but the second molars; smaller deposits are present on many maxillary
teeth. Several premolars are rotated out of their customary positions, and
although this condition may not be harmful, it is at least unusual. The lower
left fourth premolar is rotated about 90 degrees buccodistally, and the lingual
surfaces of the lower right premolars are rotated slightly away from each
other. The right maxillary third premolar is rotated about 60 degrees
buccomesially, and the left maxillary premolars are rotated slightly away from
each other on their lingual surfaces.
Caries rating: 3
Bone: On both sides of the palate, new bone appears to have been laid down
in irregular patches on top of old bone. On the right maxilla this effect can be
seen on the alveolar bone between the second premolar and the first molar as
well as on the broad palatal surfaces. It is not known at the present time
whether this condition is normal, the result of dental or palatal infection, or
the result of palatal fracture.
Cranial deformation: The cranium is not deformed.
Tooth modification: The maxillary anterior teeth are all filed. The central
mcisors conform to Romero's style B4, where the distal corner is removed.
The lateral incisors and canines are filed according to style C3, where both
corners are removed to leave a projecting rectangle of tooth in the middle of
the incisive edge.
Cut marks: Cut marks are present under the external occipital crest, on the
squamous portion of the left temporal, and above the frontal-nasal suture.
Also, the body of the second cervical vertebra has cut marks anteriorly.

mandible and one maxillary tooth. The other, Skull H, consisted of a calotte
and both maxillae. The material was combined because of the similar wear on
the teeth and the good occlusion of maxillary and mandibular teeth. The
mandible and associated teeth were cleaned for thorough examination, but the
Skull H material was not.

Pathology: Dental pathology includes caries, calculus, and abscess. Two small
car10us lesions are present, each on the distal cementa-enamel junction of an
upper second molar. A great deal of calculus covers the lingual surface of the
lower anterior teeth, premolars, and first molars and coats the buccal surface
of some upper cheek teeth. Many of the teeth are encircled with calculus
below the cervical junction. An abscess appears to have formed at the base of
the missing upper right first molar, although it cannot be determined whether
or not the lesion had perforated the bone.

Ag_~ Three to four years. This judgment is based on the developmental status of

permanent teeth. In confirmation of this estimate, the lateral portions of the
occipital have begun but not completed fusion with the squama. Fusion is
believed to take place between three and four years of age. Further, an
unfused neural arch from the atlas vertebra documents the age at death as
less than six to eight years.

Material aesent: Most of Skull l's braincase is reconstructed from fragments,
but po 10ns of all the component bones are missing. The bone surface is
encrusted in some areas with spots of matrix that cannot be removed; in other
areas the bone surface is eroded. The face cannot be reconstructed although a
large portion of the right maxilla, still containing teeth, is present. Most of

64

the mandible is preserved, but it is in two tooth-bearing fragments which
cannot be joined. In addition, Skull I is represented by several bone fragments
and loose teeth. Three unfused neural arches from at least two cervical
vertebrae are also present.

Pathology:
Teeth: This dentition has suffered a great amount of carious damage.
Although the anterior mandibular teeth are healthy, all four premolars have
large, deep cavities on their occlusal surfaces. Buccal lesions are present on all
but the left anterior premola,r. Both anterior premolars have linear caries on
their lingual surfaces at the same level, the right one showing the greater
damage. The maxillary cheek teeth, surprisingly, are much freer of the
occlusal caries seen in their lower counterparts. All upper premolars have
caries in the fissures of their occlusal surfaces; these lesions are deep but have
not destroyed as much enamel as caries did on the mandibular premolars. As
in the mandible, the maxillary anterior premolars have linear caries lingually.
The left posterior premolar also has a pit lesion on its lingual surface. The left
lateral incisor has considerable carious etching of its labial surface.
The maxillary deciduous incisors underwent a great deal of carious
deterioration. These extensively damaged teeth look as if they had their
mesial corners entirely disintegrated by caries. Caries apparently destroyed
most of the labial enamel, much of the dentin, and it invaded the lingual
surface of the left central incisor as well.
Caries rating: 3
Bone: This skull may bear faint signs of cribra orbitalia in the left orbit. The
right orbit is missing.
Cranial deformation: The skull is not deformed.
Tooth modification: The teeth are not filed.
Cut marks: Skull I presents cut marks along the right ascending ramus of the
mandible, on the left inferior surface of the mandible, and on the inferior
surface of the right zygomatic process of the maxilla. Postmortem damage to
the outer surface of this skull is extensive. Other cut marks cannot be found,
but chemical etching may have obliterated them.

In addition, two other teeth are associated with this skull, but they do not
belong to the above dentition and are not included in the analysis.
Pathology:
Teeth: Dental pathology includes caries, calculus and periodontal disease.
Although only two small occlusal cavities are present, both on the lower right
third molar, a great deal of dental tissue was destroyed by interproximal
caries. Decay is found on the upper l_"ight fourth premolar and first molar,
where a lesion has destroyed more than half the crown's interior, and on both
lower second molars. In addition, there is a small buccal cavity on the lower
left second molar. Heavy calculus coats the lower incisor and right canine
lingually, and light to moderate deposits encircle many of the other teeth.
Some areas of alveolar bone on the left maxilla are either porous or
remodeled, indicating periodontal disease.
Caries rating: 3
Bone: The left palate is somewhat roughened. The roughness may be related
to the periodontal infection noted above, but it may be unrelated to any
pathological condition. It appears that this individual had periodontal disease,
but it is not known whether or not periodontal disease can account for the
roughening of the palate.
Cranial deformation: The frontal has been flattened in an oblique plane to give a
slopmg forehead.
Tooth modification: The left upper canine has been filed to remove its distal
corner. Chipping and wear obscure the original contours, but the filing
appears to correspond to Romero's style B4.
Cut marks: Cut marks are present around both orbital rims, on the surface of

--------

67

the frontal and both zygomatics, and on both the anterior dorsal surface and
the right ascending ramus of the mandible.
Remarks: The lower left third molar has a large extra cusp adjoining the
metaconid mesiolingually, and the metaconid itself is smaller than that of the
corresponding right molar. The unusual shape of this tooth is probably not a
"malformation" but merely a variation in normal tooth form.

of the face, the mandible, and the first three cervical vertebrae are present as

areas of the surface are chemically eroded. Dental remains of this individual
include the mandible holding six teeth, the right maxilla with one tooth, the
left maxilla, and two tooth roots which were associated with the maxillae
before cleaning. All three honey elements have alveoli which apparently held
teeth at death but now lack them. A left upper central incisor completes the
remaining dentition and brings the total of teeth recovered to ten.

R c_, P3, p 4; L c_, p 4, M2-3
Pathology:
Teeth: This individual suffered considerable dental pathology, including the
antemortem loss of at least 13 teeth as indicated by completely resorbed
alveoli. Caries annihilated the entire crowns of the lower right canine and
third premolar, which has an abscess at the gum line in response to carious
infection. The only molar remaining in the dentition, the lower left second or
third, has a large cavity at the labial cemento-enamel junction which has
destroyed much of the root tissue. This tooth has in addition a large carious
lesion on its occlusal surface. Periodontal disease has greatly eroded the
alveoli, producing such shallow, infected sockets that it is difficult to determine
which of them still held teeth at time of death. Unusual wear patterns on the
remaining teeth are present; they probably result from alterations in tooth
position which both antemortem tooth loss and periodontal disease often cause.
The enamel on the lower left canine's lingual surface is totally abraded off.
The mesiolabial side of the lower left fourth premolar is similarly worn. The
sole remaining molar stands now at about a 45-degree angle to the bone,
indicating that its several planes of wear resulted from alterations in the

68

direction of chewing forces that occurred during its relatively rapid descent
from the normal upright position. Other dental pathology noted includes mild
hypoplasia of the upper left central incisor and lower left canine as well as a
light calculus deposit encircling this latter tooth.
Caries rating: 3
Bone: Two honey lesions also are observed on this individual. The frontal
presents, on the inner surface of the left orbit, a small tuberosity traversed by
a fine crack which continues out to demarcate the temporal crest for a distance
of about one centimeter. Here, the crack resembles a fold in the bone. Since
no sign of infection accompanies this abnormality and no sign of injury
appears on the left zygomatic, it is unlikely that these unusual characteristics
represent trauma and probable that they are the result of a developmental
anomaly. Another area ·of honey pathology is seen on the inner table of the
occipital, where porosity and signs of osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity
suggest infection.
Cranial deformation: The cranium is not deformed.
Tooth modification: The upper left central incisor was filed to remove its distal
corner. Its style corresponds to Romero's type B4. The lower left lateral
incisor, although extremely worn, shows that a V-shape was filed in the
middle of its incisal surface. Its style corresponds to Romero's type Al.
Cut marks: Cut marks are observed around the nasal aperture on both maxillae,
on the left maxilla's inferior surface of the zygomatic process, and on the left

Pathology:
Teeth: This individual suffered from considerable antemortem tooth evulsion,
caries, and calculus. Large areas of resorbed alveoli in the mandible show that
all cheek teeth were lost before death except for the right fourth premolar,
which remains as a root only, the crown being completely destroyed by caries.
No other decay is present. The small fragment of right maxilla which is
preserved shows that its third premolar and first molar were also lost
antemortem. The remaining premolars underwent atypical wear, probably the
result of changes in the mechanics of chewing as teeth were lost. The left
premolars are strikingly unusual; wear is almost vertical on the lingual side of
the buccal cusps, cutting far into the dentin and exposing the pulp cavities.
Wear apparently sheared off the lingual cusp of the left third premolar; this
cusp remains on the left fourth premolar only as an enamel outline because of
the deep groove cut between the cusps. On the maxillary right fourth
premolar, wear is not so extreme, although it is atypically positioned, being
nearly vertical on the mesiolingual portion. On the anterior teeth, abrasion
was so heavy that more than half of each crown is worn away. In addition,
the maxillary right central incisor has a wear facet on its labial surface.
Heavy calculus coats the lower central incisors and the maxillary left third
premolar, and somewhat lighter deposits are seen on the lingual surfaces of
most other teeth.

In addition, two loose upper premolars are associated with this skull. Since
the shape of the three premolars retained in the maxillae cannot be
determined, the loose premolar chosen for inclusion in this analysis had to be
identified on the basis of wear; the less worn tooth is considered to belong to
this skull.
Pathology:
Teeth: Most of the teeth could not be seen well enough for evaluation. The
only pathology visible is a small amount of calculus encircling the loose lower
right third premolar and coating the lingual surface of the upper left lateral
incisor.
Caries rating: Cannot be assessed.
Bone: Surface not cleaned for examination.
Cranial deformation: The shape of the cranium appears to have been modified in
the manner of Dembo & Imbelloni's Tabula Erect category.
Tooth modification: The teeth that were recovered were not filed.
Cut marks: The bone surface was not cleaned for examination.
SKULL Q
Burial level: Upper.
Sex: Female. This judgment is based on the gracility of the mandible and the
--small size of the mastoid processes.
Age:
Adult.
This judgment is based on eruption and retention of most
permanent teeth. The average wear on teeth that could be evaluated is Stage
Three.
Material present: This individual is represented by many small, friable bone
fragments and teeth, all in a poor state of preservation. Many tooth and bone
surfaces are badly etched by chemicals in the soil, and the bone has
deteriorated so badly that many cranial fragments lack an inner table. Part of
the back of the head, most of the right temporal, and the mandible are the

71

only portions that could be reconstructed. The right maxilla, fragments of
cervical vertebrae, and teeth also are present.

Pathology:
Teeth: This individual experienced antemortem tooth loss, calculus, caries,
alveolar abscess, and unusual occlusion and attrition. Both mandibular third
molars were lost some time before death and their alveoli completely resorbed.
All mandibular anterior teeth as well as the right fourth premolar and first
molar bear extremely heavy calculus deposits, and all other teeth show light to
moderate deposits. Carious lesions are present at the cervical junction of
several teeth. Although three (all but the maxillary left) first molars show
large cavities at this area, destruction is extreme in the mandibular left first
molar. This tooth is destroyed across nearly half its width and its alveolus is
abscessed. The maxillary left second molar, in even worse condition, has
caries interproximally with the third molar. Both second and third molars are
so badly damaged by decay that the pulp cavities are exposed in each.
Occlusion and wear in this specimen are considerably unbalanced.
The
anterior mandibular teeth are not evenly spaced, and crowding apparently has
pushed the right second premolar mesiobuccally out of the occlusal plane.
Most remarkable is the asymmetric wear pattern on the posterior teeth.
While the left side is worn very little, showing at most beveling of the enamel,
the right side is very worn, with molars presenting unevenly worn enamel
around large areas of exposed dentin.
Caries rating: 3
Bone: The surface 1s chemically eroded to an extent that bone pathology
cannot be assessed.
Cranial deformation: Deformation cannot be evaluated from the small portions
of skull which are reconstructed.
Tooth modification: The upper central incisors were filed to remove a small
square from their distal corners as in Romero's style B4. The upper lateral
incisors and possibly the upper canines are filed straight across, as in style A4.
Cut marks: The bone surface is too eroded by chemicals in the soil to permit
assessment of cut marks.

--small size of the left mastoid process.
Age: Adult. Antemortem tooth loss appears to have taken place but its extent
cannot be judged. The average wear on teeth that could be evaluated is Grade
Four.
Material present: Most of the posterior part of the cranium, about two-thirds of
the mandible, and fragments of the maxillae appear to be present. All are
crushed and covered with much dirt and preservative. In addition nine loose
teeth and the second cervical vertebra were recovered.

Also present are one chipped premolar and one burned and chipped molar.
Pathology:
Teeth: This individual suffered from antemortem tooth loss, caries, and
calculus. The right posterior fragment of the mandible shows that at least one
or two molars were lost before death. A large carious lesion has destroyed
most of the lower right third premolar crown, and five of the loose teeth show
light to moderate deposits of calculus on the root below the cervical margin.
In addition to dental pathology in this dentition, unusual wear is seen in the
right fourth premolar; its mesiobuccal corner is worn close to the cementoenamel junction at one point.
Caries rating: 3
Bone: The surface was not cleaned for examination.
Cranial deformation: The skull is apparently not deformed.
Tooth modification: These teeth are probably not filed, although three of them
are worn to straight lines. But, rounded edges show that normal wear
contributed to the present contours, and all the loose teeth are worn close to
the cemento-enamel junction, three of them obliquely. The resulting mixture
of angles in the mouth is not likely the result of intentional modification.
Cut marks: The bone surface was not cleaned for examination.

Pathology:
Teeth:
This individual expe~ienced antemortem tooth loss, abscess, and
calculus deposits. Well-healed alveolar bone between the third premolar and
an empty alveolus for the third molar indicates antemortem loss of the fourth
premolar and first and second molars. The empty alveolus is remodeled,
hemispherical, and has a small opening bordered with healed bone to the
medial surface of the mandible. Its appearance suggests that an abscess was
present there and tooth loss either had just occurred or was imminent at time
of death. Calculus is present, primarily on the labial side, on the mandibular
teeth below the cervical margin.
Caries rating: 0
Bone: No pathology is seen on the small fragment of bone recovered.
Cranial deformation: Cannot be determined.
Tooth modification: The recovered teeth appear not to have been filed.
Cut marks: Cut marks are found on the ascending ramus and on the inferior
surface of the mandible.
SKULLT
Burial level: Lower.
Sex: Male. This judgment is based on the rugosity of the mandible and
--zygomatic crests and on the large size of the right mastoid process.
Age: Young adult. The permanent teeth are erupted and retained. The third
molars show only small patches of light wear. Average wear on teeth that
could be evaluated is Grade One.

74
Material present: Most of the braincase, face, and mandible appear to be
present, albeit crushed and covered with dirt and preservative. Fragments of
the first three cervical vertebrae also were recovered.
Teeth present: All permanent teeth are preserved except for the upper right
third molar.
Pathology:
Teeth: The only pathology noted on the portions of this dentition that could
be examined is calculus, which is present in light to heavy deposits at the
cervical margin on most of the teeth. Calculus also coats the lingual surfaces
of the lower incisors and the upper right central incisor.
Caries rating: Cannot be assessed.
Bone: No pathology was noted on the surfaces that could be examined.
Cranial deformation: The back of the head was flattened in the Tabula Erect
style. The shape of the frontal could not be determined.
Tooth modification: The teeth are not filed.
Cut marks: No cut marks are visible on surfaces that can be seen, but much of
the bone cannot be evaluated.
SKULL V
Burial level: Lower.
Sex: Cannot be determined. The mandible and mastoids are intermediate in
----slze. The supraorbita1 torus is small and the orbital rim is relatively sharp.
The zygomatic crest is long but not sharply marked.
Age: Adult. The permanent teeth are erupted and retained. The average wear
on the five teeth that could be examined is Grade Two.
Material present: Much of the braincase appears to be present in fragments, as
are the face and mandible, although these are crushed and heavily covered
with dirt and preservative. A few of the fragments are burned. The first two

The presence of other teeth can barely be detected through the dirt and
preservative, and their forms cannot be distinguished. Of the loose teeth
associated with this skull, four seem not to belong to it and are not included in
the analysis.

75

Pathology:
Dental pathology seems to be limited to calculus and enamel
Teeth:
hypoplasia, but only five teeth can be seen well enough to be evaluated: the
upper and lower central incisors and the lower right lateral incisor. All have
light calculus deposits at the cemento-enamel junction, and all central incisors
appear to have undergone recurrent episodes of mild hypoplasia.
Caries rating: Cannot be assessed.
Bone: Much of the bone surface cannot be assessed, but pathology can be
detected on the right temporo-mandibular joint. Possibly as a result of poor
articulation, the lateral half of the mandibular condyle is flattened superiorly,
hypertrophied, and porous. The expanded right glenoid fossa has signs of
osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity near the articular eminence. The left
temporomandibular joint is apparently not preserved.
Cranial deformation: The shape of the cranium cannot be determined.
Tooth modification: Three different styles of modification are seen in this
dentition. The upper central incisors have been filed to remove a square from
their distal corners according to Romero's style B4. The upper canines have
had their mesial corners removed in such a way that the line filed in from the
mesial edge slants upward as in style B7. Last, the four lower incisors have a
"V" shape filed from their incisal edges; this shape conforms to style Al.
Cut marks: None noted on surfaces that could be observed.
Remarks: The atlas vertebra has a hiatus in the circumference of the right
foramen transversarium ~esulting from failure of the anterior costotransverse
bar to meet the transverse process. The unusual formation appears to be a
developmental anomaly rather than the result of trauma or disease.
SKULLW
Burial level: Lower.
Sex: Unknown.
Age: Three or four years. This judgment is based on the development of the
permanent tooth buds. Confirmation that the individual was less than five or
six years old at death is given by the basilar and exoccipital elements which
are not yet fused together into a single bone. Further evidence that the child
was less than six or eight years old is given by the unfused neural arches of
the first two cervical vertebrae.
Material tresent: The posterior half of the braincase has been restored as have
many arge cranial and facial bones, but these cannot be reunited. Maxillary
and mandibular fragments contain most of the teeth. The .surface of the bone
is relatively well preserved. Four unfused neural arches were recovered,
representing the first two cervical vertebrae.

Pathology:
Teeth: This dentition is characterized by the malformation of several teeth
and moderate destruction by caries. Among the malformations are a shallow
central notch on the incisal surface of the upper left lateral permanent incisor
bud and dissimilarity of the three mandibular permanent incisor buds. No two
of these incisors look alike, and they may actually represent more than one
individual rather than indicating pathology. Most striking is the unusual
shape of the lower deciduous incisors, which are quite broad and have a
central notch on the incisal surface continuous with a deep lingual groove.
Light microscope inspection reveals no sharp edges to the grooves or other
signs of cultural modification. One of these teeth fits quite well into the
partial alveolus for the right lateral deciduous incisor. If the mandible were
reconstructed with these teeth in the lateral incisor position, a small diastema
would separate them. Tooth fusion or gemination is suggested as the origin of
the lower deciduous incisors' aberrant form. In tooth fusion, two teeth are
united root and crown, and the number of teeth in the jaw is reduced by one.
Tooth gemination, on the other hand, denotes the partial splitting of the crown
of a single tooth. Generally the root remains single, and the total number of
teeth in the jaw is normal. In Skull W, the number of teeth and their spacing
suggest that the incisors were fused, not geminated. However, the roots
appear to be single, so gemination is a possibility. Both of these conditions are
most often seen in mandibular deciduous incisors (Colby et al. 1971).
Small to medium sized carious lesions are found labially on the upper anterior
teeth. In addition, the left upper lateral incisor is either severely decayed or
badly damaged postmortem.
Caries rating: 2
Bone: No pathology noted.
Cranial deformation: Skull W presents a marked lambdoid flattening. The
occipital appears flat and noticeably wide relative to its length, probably an
effect of the flattening. The frontal slope appears normal. If this is an
instance of intentional cranial deformation, it could be classified in Imbelloni

77

and Dembo's 1938 Tabula Erect category, as presented in Saul (1972).
However, the postmortem warping is considerable in this specimen; the skull
cannot be completely reconstructed. Cranial deformation, however extreme
and symmetric, may have occurred after death.
Tooth modification: The teeth are not filed.
Cut marks: This skull exhibits numerous cut marks: Around the right orbital
nm on the maxilla and zygomatic, on the left orbital rim on the zygomatic,
and on the anterior surface of the left zygomatic. They are also present on the
dorsal surface of the mandible, the right ascending mandibular ramus, and
along the inferior surface of the zygomatic process of the left maxilla. On the
braincase, cut marks appear on the frontal near the coronal suture, at several
places on the left parietal and temporal, on the right parietal, and over large
areas of the squamous portion of the occipital.
SKULL X
Burial level: Lower.
Sex: Female. This judgment is based on the gracility of the mandible.
Age: Adult. The permanent teeth have erupted, and the extent of antemortem
tooth loss is unknown. The average wear on the two teeth that could be
evaluated is Grade Three.
Material present: Broken fragments, some of them burned, comprise most of the
left side of the braincase and part of the right. Parts of the left mandible and
left maxilla also were recovered. Much of the material, including all dentition
but the loose teeth, are covered with dirt and preservative. Fragments of the
atlas and one other cervical vertebra also are present.

R P 3 , P 4 , M2; unidentified lower incisor
Pathology:
Teeth: The pathology that can be seen on this dentition includes caries,
hypoplasia, calculus, and antemortem tooth loss. Although most of the teeth
present cannot be evaluated because they are either burned or covered with
dirt and preservative, it looks as though one coated tooth, the upper right
second molar, has been extensively undermined by caries. The upper right
central incisor has a shallow hypoplastic groove and is partially encircled by a
light calculus deposit on the crown below the cervical margin. Thin patches of
calculus coat both the lingual and labial surfaces of the upper right central
incisor. The lower left first and third molars were lost antemortem.
Caries rating: Cannot be assessed.
Bone:

The bone surface, because of burning, eros10n, or preservative, could

78

not be evaluated.
Cranial deformation: The back of the skull does not show deformation. The
shape of the frontal cannot be determined from the small, burned fragments
that are preserved.
Tooth modification: The teeth which were recovered were not filed.
Cut marks: Although most of the bone surface cannot be examined, two
relatively deep cut marks are present on the dorsal edge of the mandibular left
ascending ramus.
SKULL Y
Burial level: Lower.
Sex: Unknown.
Age: Four or five years. This judgment is based on the development of the
permanent tooth buds. Other age indicators include the absence of fusion
between the basilar and exoccipital parts of the occipital, showing that the
individual was less than five or six years old at time of death, and the unfused
neural arch of the atlas vertebra, suggesting an age of less than six or eight.
Material present: The largest restored portion of this skull, including most of the
frontal, left parietal, and fragments of the left temporal an.d the sphenoid,
documents part of the cranial outline. Another large isolated fragment
consists of most of the right parietal and part of the occipital. The left half of
the mandible and the left maxilla are present; both contain some of the teeth
that have been recovered. The unfused right neural arch for the atlas
vertebra is also preserved. This skull appears to have undergone postmortem
warping, and while the bone surface is smooth in some areas, it is eroded or
encrusted with matrix in others.

Pathology:
Teeth: This individual had some unusually shaped teeth and suffered from
caries and enamel hypoplasia. The lower canine has a fused double root, one
mesial, one distal. All canines, both deciduous teeth and permanent buds, are

79

sharply pointed, although this characteristic may be only unusual, not
pathological. The maxillary left permanent canine bud bears a conule on its
lingual surface near the base of the crown. Six of the recovered deciduous
teeth have carious lesions at the cemento-enamel junction, and one has a large
cavity on its tnesial surface. Hypoplasia is seen in both upper posterior
premolars, both upper first molar buds, the lower left posterior premolar and
the lower right first molar bud, all of which show an indentation around the
crown. These indentations probably represent a growth arrest due to trauma,
illness, or malnutrition at age six to nine months. The locations of the grooves
on all affected teeth support this age determination. A reasonable objection to
this diagnosis is that no other teeth or tooth buds show this pathology.
Permanent incisor buds were forming at the same time, yet they have no
grooves. Moreover, maxillary central incisors are typically more vulnerable to
hypoplasia than molars (Goodman and Armelagos 1985). Another possibility
is that these teeth show a pathology not related to growth arrest during
infancy, perhaps deformity stemming from an infectious process.
Caries rating: 2
Bone: Skull Y shows very faint signs of possible cribra orbitalia in the
fragmentary left orbit. The right orbit is not preserved.
Cranial deformation: This skull does not present clear evidence of artificial
cramal deformat10n. It does, however, show a slight flattening of the right
parietal above the posterior inferior angle. The frontal and occipital are
normal, and probably the parietal flattening, similar to that seen in Skull Z, is
the result of postmortem warping.
Tooth modification: The teeth are not filed.
Cut marks: The condition of the bone does not permit determination of cut
marks m most areas, but the frontal portion of the left orbit, which is in good
condition, does not have these marks. Marks are present on the left side of
the nasal aperture and on the inferior surface of the zygomatic process of the
left maxilla.
SKULL Z
Burial level: Lower.
Sex: Unknown.
~ Eighteen months to two and one-half years.
This estimate is based on
---Ueciduous tooth wear and permanent tooth bud development. Other age
indicators include the absence of fusion between the right occipital condyle and
the basilar part of the occipital, suggesting that the individual was less than
five or six. Also, the anterior arch of the atlas is not fused to the rest of this
vertebra, indicating an age at death of less than six or eight.

Material present: The restored Skull Z, which may have undergone postmortem
warping, consists of most of the calotte although it has been extensively

80

damaged on the right side. Other small fragments are present but cannot be
joined to the calotte. Most of the mandible is present, but the maxillae are
crushed. The anterior arch of the atlas vertebra is also preserved. The bone
surface, like that in most of this sample, is smooth in some areas, eroded or
encrusted with matrix in others.

Pathology:
Teeth: This individual appears to have suffered from enamel hypoplasia and
caries. Many of the teeth show evidence of growth arrest or trauma occurring
at about nine months of age. Deep transverse grooves encircle the permanent
tooth buds for the molars, maxillary left canine, and the mandibular left
lateral incisor. The bud for the upper left lateral incisor does not have a
transverse groove, but this tooth does not begin to form until around one to
one and one-half years. The bud for the lower premolar also is unaffected, but
it does not begin to form until about two years of age. Although the other
permanent tooth buds cannot be seen in their entirety, the right mandibular
central incisor seems to lack a transverse groove.
The mandibular posterior premolars have a few small carious lesions in the
occlusal grooves, and each has a cavity on its buccal surface. Many discolored
and pitted areas exist making it difficult to distinguish postmortem etching
from enamel hypocalcification and subsequent carious invasion. Postmortem
damage is heavier on the maxillary molars, but it appears that they have less
carious damage than their lower counterparts, since only one occlusal cavity, a
small one on the right posterior premolar, can be seen on these teeth.
Caries rating: 1
Bone: No pathology noted.
Cranial deformation: Skull Z does not show definite signs of cranial deformation.
The frontal and occipital are normal, although the right parietal, like that of
Skull Y, is slightly flattened above the posterior inferior angle. This is
probably the result of postmortem warping.
Tooth modification: The teeth are not filed.

Seven additional teeth were recovered with this skull, but it cannot be
determined which of them, if any, belong with it. They are not included in the
analysis.
Pathology:
Teeth: Dental pathology in this individual includes caries, impaction, and
calculus. Caries pits the occlusal surfaces of both upper first molars. The
lower left third molar is impacted so that its mesial cusps abut the root of the
second molar. Although most of the teeth cannot be evaluated for calculus, it
can be seen at the cervical margins of the lower right molars, the lower
incisors, and on the lingual and labial surfaces of all incisors.
Caries rating: 2
Bone: The palate is notably rough, but it is not known whether the roughness
represents a normal variation in development or a pathological condition.
Cranial deformation: This skull is artificially deformed in the Tabula Erect style
so that the back of the cranium is flattened vertically. The frontal appears to
be of normal contour.
Tooth modification: The upper central incisors have been filed to remove their
distal corners. Their outlines are difficult to see clearly because of chipping,
wear, chemical etching from the soil, and a thick coating of preservative, but
they seem to resemble Romero's style B4 best. The upper canines have also
been filed to remove their distal corners, but their form is more like B7. The

82

lower canines and lateral incisors have been filed to remove both distal and
mesial corners according to style C3.
Cut marks: None observed on areas which could be examined.

When excavated, the maxilla and mandible fragments were considered as
representing one skull and the calvarium fragments as another, but these
were all re-assessed in the preliminary analysis (Steele et al.) as the remains
of one individual. Confirmation of the earlier judgment arose during the
present study, when the upper left third molar found with Skull BB's cranial
fragments was seen to fit well in the alveolus present in Skull HH's maxilla.
Pathology:
Teeth: Dental pathology in this individual includes caries, calculus, and
enamel hypoplasia. Both left second molars have small carious lesions on
their occlusal surfaces. All molars seem to have light calculus deposits
interproximally, while the upper left central incisor has a calculus coating over
its lingual fossa and in light patches on its labial surface.
A shallow
hypoplastic groove can be seen on the left upper central incisor.
Caries rating: 1
Bone: No pathology was observed on the surfaces that could be evaluated, but

Six or seven years.
This estimate is based on the eruption and
---Uevelopmental status of the permanent teeth and tooth buds, as well as on
differential wear on the deciduous and permanent dentition.

Material present: Of all the children's skulls in this group, Skull CC is the most
complete after reconstruction. Most of the braincase is present, and although
the right side is extensively damaged, enough of the cranium remains to
document its shape; Most of the facial bones, especially those from the center
of the face, are present and join the braincase. The maxillae and mandible are
damaged but most of the teeth remain in their alveoli. Also present are some
cranial fragments and teeth that cannot be reunited with the cranium. The
surface of the bone is somewhat eroded but not so badly that cut marks and
pathology cannot be assessed in most areas.

Pathology:
Teeth: Skull CC's mandibular teeth look healthy, although the posterior
deciduous premolars have some small cavities in occlusal grooves, but the
maxillary teeth do show carious damage.
The maxillary right anterior
deciduous premolar has on its lingual surface a discolored horizontal groove in
which there are two pits, possibly carious.
The left anterior deciduous
premolar has linear caries lingually at the level corresponding to this groove.
The right posterior deciduous premolar is the most damaged tooth present,
having one quarter of its occlusal enamel destroyed as well as having two
smaller carious lesions, one buccal, one lingual, and a small discolored spot
lingually. This spot and the lingual cavity are at the same level as the groove
on the anterior premolar. The right first permanent molar has two lingual
cavities and one small buccal lesion. The upper left posterior deciduous

84
premolar has a barely detectable small occlusal lesion and presents a small
discolored spot on its buccal surface. Next to it, the first permanent molar has
intact enamel except for a small buccal lesion. However, the enamel looks
thin in a discolored line on the buccal surfaces of both permanent molars.
Caries rating: 2
Bone: No pathology noted.
Cranial deformation: The skull is not deformed.
Tooth modification: The teeth are not filed.
Cut marks: This skull exhibits cut marks on the right side of the nasal aperture,
at two places on the left zygomatic, the orbital rim and the anterior surface,
on the right frontal portion of the orbital rim, and on the anterior surface of
the left side of the frontal.
SKULL DD

Material hresent: The right temporal, the mandible, portions of both maxillae,
and a ew small cranial fragments are present. In addition, fragments of two

Three unidentified root fragments
Pathology:
Teeth: This individual suffered from the antemortem loss of several teeth,
caries, abscesses, and calculus. All mandibular first and third molars were
evulsed before death, as were both maxillary left premolars and probably the
right maxillary first molar also. The three root fragments found have large
carious lesions, and the mandibular left second molar, though broken, appears
to have had a large cavity which exposed the pulp cavity. Abscesses seem to
have been forming in the alveoli for the upper right premolars and the lower
left second molar. Light to moderate deposits of calculus encircle most of the

85

mandibular teeth.
Caries rating: 3
Bone: Porous subperiosteal bone appears to have been deposited on the
medial aspects of both mandibular ascending rami up to the coronoid
processes. The infectious bone seems to be cont'muous with that in the
gumline and probably was contemporaneous with an infection that
accompanied the loss of the mandibular third molars.
Cranial deformation: Cannot be determined.
Tooth modification: The upper central incisors were filed to remove their distal
corners accordmg to Romero's style B4. The maxillary lateral incisors and
canines appear to have been filed straight across as in Romero's style A4.
Cut marks: Cut marks are seen on the temporal and on the right neural arch of
one of the first cervical vertebrae.

$even to eleven months. The estimate is based on tooth eruption as
mferred from mature alveoli and on the development of both deciduous and
permanent tooth buds. Another indicator of age is the absence of fusion
between the exoccipital and squamous parts of the occipital, indicating that
the individual was less than three or four years of age. Also, the unfused
neural arches of the cervical vertebrae suggest that the child was less than six
or eight years old at death.

Material present: The skeletal remains of this individual are thin and friable
with eroded and matrix encrusted surfaces. Little reconstruction is possible.
Frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital fragments represent the braincase.
More than half the mandible is preserved and contains teeth. Five broken
unfused neural arches are preserved from at least two cervical vertebrae.

Pathology:
Teeth: None noted.
Caries rating: 0
Bone: None noted.
Cranial deformation: The shape of the cranium cannot be determined.
Tooth modification: Erupted teeth were not recovered.
Cut marks: Most of the bone cannot be evaluated for cut marks because it is too
eroded, but one frontal fragment does show definite cut marks along the
orbital rim.
SKULL GG
Burial level: Lower.
Sex: Unknown.
~ Approximately six months. This estimate is based on the development of
--uie deciduous mandibular right lateral incisor and the evident eruption of the
deciduous mandibular central incisors as inferred from mature alveoli. The
exoccipitals had not yet joined with the squamous portion of the occipital,
showing that the individual was less than three or four years of age. The
unfused neural arches found in association with the skull are from two
individuals; both of them show by their lack of fusion that they represent
children less than six to eight years old.

Material present: Only fragments, some of them charred, are preserved from
this skull. A few parietal, frontal, temporal, zygomatic, and occipital pieces
are present, but these cannot be reconstructed. A small mandibular fragment
includes the symphyseal area, alveoli, crypts, and one tooth bud. Five unfused
neural arch fragments recovered near this skull represent at least four
vertebrae. Some or all of them, however, probably do not belong with Skull
GG. They appear to come from individuals of at least two different ages, as
they differ in size.
Deciduous tooth bud present:

Pathology:
Teeth: None noted.
Caries rating: 0
Bone: None noted.

Cranial deformation: The shape of the cranium cannot be determined.
Tooth modification: Erupted teeth were not recovered.
Cut marks: There are no cut marks positively identifiable on most of this badly
damaged bone. However, there is a very large cut mark into the articular
surface of the left neural arch of a child's second cervical vertebra. There is
also a cut mark across a vertebral piece which is probably the fused neural
arch of a second cervical vertebra. These two fragments may belong to
different individuals, although both were found in association with Skull GG.
SKULL II
Burial level: Unknown.
Sex: Male. This judgment is based on the rugosity of the mandible.
Age: Adult. This judgment is based on the eruption and retention of permanent
teeth. The average wear on teeth that could be evaluated is Stage Three.
Material hresent: Only facial fragments and the axis vertebra are preserved
from t is md1vidual. The facial remains consist of the left side of the
mandible, both maxillae and zygomatics, and loose teeth. The bones are clean,
and the bone surface is in relatively good condition although many tooth
surfaces are badly etched, particularly those of the maxillary teeth.

Pathology:
Teeth: This individual was in the process of infectious tooth evulsion when
death occurred and may already have lost teeth at time of death. In addition,
he suffered from caries, abscess, and calculus. Evidence of subperiosteal bone
deposition is seen in the alveolar bone for the lower left second molar and the
upper right second molar, indicating that these teeth were lost or soon to be
lost from the infected jaw. A large amount of cementum surrounds the roots
of the upper right third molar, suggesting that it was held in the jaw by soft
tissue only and that it would soon be lost from this infected area. This tooth
has at least two small occlusal cavities, while the upper right canine has lost
its entire crown and part of its root to decay. An abscess appears to have
begun at the apex of its root. lnterproximal caries is found on the lower left
third premolar and first molar, the lower right first or second molar, and the
upper left fourth premolar. Moderate to heavy deposits of calculus are present
on many of the mandibular teeth. The maxillary teeth are too badly etched to
be evaluated for calculus deposition during life.
Caries rating: 3
Bone: The palate is very rough, but whether or not the roughness represents

88

a pathological condition is not known. Remodeled alveolar bone on the left
palate may give evidence for periodontal disease, but so much of the alveolar
bone is broken off that the extent cannot be assessed. The posterior part of
the mandible also has an altered texture. Signs of osteoblastic and osteoclastic
activity indicate infection of the bone behind the lower left third molar and
extending up the ramus almost to the coronoid process. The bone infection
was probably associated with the infectious evulsion of the second molar.
Cranial deformation: Cranial bone was not recovered.
Tooth modification: The upper central incisors were filed to remove their distal
corners accordmg to Romero's style B4, where the upper left lateral incisor
was filed to remove both corners, leaving a rectangle of tooth in the center of
the incisive edge. This style corresponds to Romero's style C3. The right
upper lateral incisor was not recovered.
Cut marks: Cut marks are present on the anterior surfaces and orbital rims of
both zygomatics, on the inferior surfaces of the maxillary zygomatic processes,
and on the inferior surface of the mandible.
Remarks (Description): Skull II exhibits a Stafne idiopathic bone defect, a
hemispherical depression that indents the cortex of the left interior aspect of
the mandible between the mylohyoid groove and the attachment for the
medial pterygoideus. The depression is about 7 mm in its longest· diameter
and about 4 mm deep. Its circumference is gently rounded and there is no
sign of subperiosteal bone deposition. Finnegan and Marcsik (1980) suggest
that Stafne's defect be considered an anomaly rather than a pathological
condition and that it might profitably be included in a list of discrete traits
used to estimate population affinities.
Remarks (Provenience):
This skeleial material was not included in the
preliminary analysis by Steele (Steele et al. 1980) because after field
examination by the archaeologists the material was not included in the
submitted sample. Further examination of the specimen led us to believe that
it should be included in the skull pit series for four reasons: 1) The field notes
suggest it was found in immediate proximity to the pit. 2) The material was
labeled Suboperation 12 and dated at 6 March 1980, the first day this feature
was excavated. 3) The material is of the same skeletal elements as represent
the other individuals in this collection. 4) The material bears cut marks, an
unusual modification of human bone that is widely observed in this collection.
Now that this specimen is deemed part of the skull pit collection, it is given
the label "Skull II," the next in the series.
