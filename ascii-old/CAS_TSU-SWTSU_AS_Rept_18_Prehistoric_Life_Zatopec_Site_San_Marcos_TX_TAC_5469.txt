First it must be realized that archaeological significance is
a dynamic phenomenon that will change with advances in
archaeological method and theory. "Canned" approaches cannot
provide useful guidance to an evolving scientific discipline.

ata recovery and analyses of archaeological remains from the
Zatopec site, 41HY163, represent one of the most substantial
investigations into the prehistoric period in Hays County and the
City of San Marcos that has been undertaken to date. Successful
completion of a project of this magnitude would not have been
possible without important contributions from numerous individuals
and agencies, and the Principal Investigator extends his most
sincere appreciation to the following for their roles in this effort.
The City of San Marcos provided the initial funding for this work
and showed consistent interest in the findings throughout all stages
of the project. This data recovery effort represents a significant
commitment by the City to the development of a better understanding
of local history and prehistory, and I deeply appreciate this level
of support. Mr. Sabas Avila, P.E., coordinated many of the logistics
provided by the City, including site access, mechanical scraping, and
site protection, and his contributions are gratefully acknowledged.
Mr. Jon Budd of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT)
has been enthusiastic about this work since its beginning and has
provided much appreciated consultation and advice at key project
intervals. Dr. Scott Pletka (TxDOT) also provided very important
support by consenting to pay for the radiocarbon dating associated
with this analysis through his agency’s budget (with the exception
of the dates on human remains, which were paid for by the City).
Mr. Budd and Dr. Pletka also helped coordinate this project with
the State Historic Preservation Office, and Dr. Pletka freely offered
advice regarding the City’s obligations under the Native American
Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. Dr. Michelle Hamilton (Texas

State University, Department of Anthropology) likewise provided
much useful guidance concerning NAGPRA consultations.
The Scope of Work for this data recovery was compiled at CAS
by David Nickels, Carole Leezer, and C. Britt Bousman, although
none of these individuals was directly involved in the project once
fieldwork got underway. Fieldwork was carried out by Theodore
Brooks, Jon C. Lohse (Principal Investigator) R. Zac Selden, Terrie
Simmons, Julian Sitters, and David M. Yelacic (who served as
Project Archaeologist throughout the duration of this project).
Stephanie Sonnier (Texas State University, College of Liberal Arts)
was instrumental in managing the accounting on the University’s
end. Margie Elliott devoted many hours in technical and copy editing
and in laying out this complex report; her efforts greatly improved
the final outcome. Lastly, a number of researchers elsewhere
contributed important analyses to this overall project, and their
efforts are greatly appreciated.
Finally, Dr. James F. Garber (Texas State University, Department
of Anthropology) deserves much credit for what is known about
Zatopec. He directed several field schools at this important site in
the 1980s, and many of the results of those field schools greatly
enrich the current report.

his report presents the results of archaeological investigations
and analyses of the Zatopec site, 41HY163, in Hays County,
Texas. Excavations conducted by the Center for Archaeological
Studies, Texas State University-San Marcos from August, 2007 to
February, 2008, under contract with the City of San Marcos, were
required to offset negative impacts to the site as a result of the
City’s construction of the Wonder World Drive Extension north from
Hunter Road to Ranch Road 12. Initially self-funded by the City, the
Federal Highway Administration agreed to reimburse the City for
some construction costs. Accordingly, archaeological investigations
were required under provisions of the Texas Antiquities Code,
as well as Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.
Excavations and analyses were conducted under Antiquities Permit
Number 4569, Jon C. Lohse, Principal Investigator.
The site had previously been excavated in the mid-1980s in a
series of field schools by Texas State University-San Marcos, then
Southwest Texas State University. The artifact assemblages and
findings of those earlier investigations have been integrated into
the more recent project and are incorporated in this report. Overall,
approximately 75.86 m3 of earth were excavated by hand, 21.569 m3
in the current project, and 226,792 artifacts were recovered.
Based on diagnostic artifacts from the site, occupation spanned
time periods from the end of the Late Paleoindian through the
Archaic and Late Prehistoric and included an ephemeral early
Historic (possibly Colonial) component. Intact deposits, which
form the basis of the analysis, represent Middle Archaic (0.3 m3),
Late Archaic 1 (3.6 m3), Late Archaic 2 (5.9 m3), Austin (4.0 m3)

xxv

Management Summary
and Toyah (2.5 m3) time periods. Following hand excavations, the
entire site area was mechanically scraped through cultural layers
to ensure that additional intact features were not present. Site
deposits and analytical units belonging to these time periods have
been delineated using a combination of diagnostic artifacts and
technologies, and by radiocarbon dating of charred botanical and
bison remains.
Analyses focused on four research domains:
•

assessing the residential
aggregation camp sites,

character

of

hunter-gatherer

•

investigating site formation processes affecting stratigraphic
integrity of deposits,

•

assessing prey selection and faunal resource exploitation
behaviors, and

•

reconstructing aspects of technological organization at the site
as it changed through time.

Three fundamental premises guided these investigations.
•

The record of occupation at the site reflects the process of
continual change over short and long spans of time.

•

Understanding the site’s record requires comparative research,
both of temporal site components and also within components
during given time periods.

•

Factors affecting these changes included both external
(environmental, climatic, etc.) and internal (socially negotiated
labor roles, individual-level aptitude, participation in task
groups by sex or age, etc.) issues, each of which required
consideration.

xxvi

Management Summary
The site displayed a strong residential character, and may have
contained the remains of patterned features indicating a structure.
Other features indicating the site’s residential nature included rocklined hearths, middens of fire-cracked rock, lithic concentrations
from tool manufacture, pits presumably used for storage, and three
intact human burials that precisely span the transition from Late
Archaic 2 to Austin times. Technological data recorded from several
artifact classes revealed variable investment in tool manufacture
by skill as well as intended function. Indices are presented that
indicate a gradual increase in the intensity of tool usage from Late
Archaic 1 to Austin times, with a notable increase in Toyah times.
Prey-selection data showed relational changes in large-, medium-,
and small-bodied animals; as large game (bison) became common,
medium- and small-bodied taxa declined. Differences in the relative
frequencies of these prey was most pronounced in Toyah times,
when bison dominated the classifiable assemblage and small game
were present only in trace amounts. Combined, the faunal record
and technological data indicate that tool kits were designed over
time to accommodate increasing participation in big game hunting
and also the demands associated with processing large mammals.
Within this context, opportunities for acquiring and expressing
skill shifted from earlier periods. Some individuals devoted greater
amounts of time to their tool-making tasks while technological
approaches to basic tool types became increasingly differentiated.
Based on all findings together, an important hypothesis that is
advanced is that, during periods of intense focus on large game
hunting, gendered roles in society were transformed in relation
to earlier periods, with men’s and women’s work becoming more
sharply delineated and some women’s labor becoming increasingly
tedious. Two additional hypotheses are that, during these times,
some women were alienated from forms of technological knowledge

xxvii

Management Summary
(means of production) but developed their own approaches to
manufacturing tools that were well suited to their tasks; and that
some men competed with one another on an increasingly individual
level, perhaps for prestige. While these fundamental social tensions
were undoubtedly present in some form in earlier periods, evidence
on which these hypotheses are based is most strongly expressed in
the site’s Toyah assemblage.
An additional component of this project involved the pedestrian
survey and shovel testing of an area alongside the proposed Wonder
World Drive so that the City could install a sedimentation/filtration
pond. During the course of this effort, a site was recorded containing
evidence for Historic period Native American occupation, consisting
of chipped stone artifacts, metal implements, including a metal
arrow tip, and apparetly intact deposits and possibly features. The
letter report of this effort and findings is included at the end of this
report as Appendix A.
The record of agency review and comment on the overall Zatopec
data recovery report is included as Appendix B.

Introduction

and

Research Issues

Jon C. Lohse, David M. Yelacic and Spencer LeDoux

The Zatopec archaeological site, 41HY163, is an open-air, multi-component prehistoric
campsite located along the banks of Purgatory Creek in western Hays County in south
Central Texas (Figure 1-1). The primary dates of human occupation at Zatopec span the
Late Archaic and extend into the Late Prehistoric period. Evidence further indicates
an ephemeral Colonial-era presence (Chapter 5), as well as very early occupations,
including brief visits during the Late Paleoindian, and Early and Middle Archaic
periods. Few undisturbed deposits were discovered from the earliest periods, however,
and therefore little can be said about the occupations from those periods beyond
descriptions of diagnostic artifacts (Chapter 7).
Zatopec was first excavated by Southwest Texas State University (SWT) in a
series of field schools between 1983 and 1987 (Garber 1987). Field school excavations
recovered dense accumulations of prehistoric artifacts from repeated occupations and
recorded several features indicating the residential nature of the site. Zatopec again
became the subject of archaeological investigation in 2002, when the City of San Marcos
(City) began planning an extension of Wonder World Drive from Hopkins Road around
the northwest side of San Marcos to connect with Ranch Road 12. Although initially
self-funded by the City, project financing provided for reimbursements from the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA) through the Texas Department of Transportation
(TxDOT) in annual payments to be made to the City over a 10- to 20-year period,
based on traffic volumes on the new roadway after it has been opened. TxDOT, who
together with FHWA is responsible for oversight of regulations implementing Section
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (Section 106), has played a central role in
consultations to determine the nature of work to be carried out in conjunction with the
City’s required excavations.

Central Texas, near interface with Gulf Coastal Plain and South Texas regions.

Zatopec was resurveyed (Karbula et al. 2003) during a preliminary environmental
impact statement conducted for the roadway extension project. The survey identified
intact deposits within the area of potential effects of the proposed extension, and it was
subsequently determined that the site contained potentially meaningful information
about the region’s prehistoric record. In accordance with the requirements of Section
106 and the Texas Antiquities Code, the City contracted with Center for Archaeological
Studies at Texas State University-San Marcos (CAS) in 2007 to conduct data recovery at
Zatopec in order to mitigate the effects of the proposed transportation extension project
(CAS 2007). Data recovery was conducted between August 2007 and February 2008
under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 4569, issued to Dr. Jon C. Lohse and administered
by the Texas Historical Commission.

3

During the SWT field schools and the CAS data recovery project, approximately 203
square meters were hand-excavated to varying depths, and CAS cross-sectioned another
5 square meters in areas identified as possible features (Chapter 5). Finally, the entire
accessible site area was scraped with a Gradall excavator to identify additional features
in unexcavated areas. Altogether, this intensive level of archaeological effort produced
a large volume of information about the cultural practices of site inhabitants from
the Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric periods. This report provides a primary account
of the CAS excavations, summarizes results of the SWT field schools (also reported
briefly in Garber 1987), and presents the results of the integrated analyses of artifact
assemblages from the SWT field schools and CAS excavations. Consequently, the
archaeological record from Zatopec now offers one of the most comprehensive accounts
available to date of Late Archaic-to-Late Prehistoric occupations at a single site in the
south Central Texas region.
The report is organized into several chapters. The remainder of Chapter 1 discusses
several research issues identified and deemed significant prior to the excavation phase
of the project. These topics have been refined as analyses have progressed and shed
new light on these issues. The earlier interpretation from the 1983–1987 excavations
that the site was a residential camp is unchanged. However, specific interpretations
of site features and of the organization and implementation of important activities
over the history of occupation have been revised. Although the understanding of the
site as a residential camp provides the overarching framework for the analyses that
follow, attention is directed to the fact that as a site category, “residential camp” is
a poorly understood archaeological concept. Consequently, consideration is given to
developing implications of the categorization of a site as “residential” in terms of social
behavior, technological adaptation, and subsistence responses. Not all Native American
residential camps were alike, and the differences among them are meaningful as to how
both archaeologists and the interested public understand the changing nature of the
region’s rich prehistoric record.
Chapter 2 describes the site’s setting and environment and the geologic history of
the landform in which the deposits were found. Previous investigations are reviewed,
and the regional cultural chronology is presented. Collective archaeological thought
about prehistoric timelines in the San Marcos area is currently evolving, and many of
the findings from this project will help shape the development of the new understanding
of local cultural chronology.
Chapter 3 discusses excavation and analysis methods used in the current project.
Because this report integrates findings from two different excavation programs, the
nomenclature used to record archaeological proveniences sometimes varies from one
part of the site to another. Furthermore, during the laboratory analysis, it became
clear that many layers of deposits in some parts of the site had become mixed in the
past and that once-associated cultural materials had been displaced from their original

4

contexts (Chapter 4). After this discovery, efforts were made to identify undisturbed
areas of the site that could be assigned to a specific time period. Deposits in these areas
are referred to as analytical units (AUs). Chapter 3 discusses the diverse provenience
data and defines the AUs that provided the basis for artifact analysis and upon which
the reconstruction of the site’s occupational history and the interpretation of important
behavioral changes are based.
Chapters 4–10 present the results of the different subjects of analysis. Sediments
and stratigraphy are address in Chapter 4, features and chronology in Chapter 5,
ceramic artifacts in Chapter 6, much of the lithic assemblage in Chapter 7, human
remains in Chapter 8, fauna in Chapter 9, and archaeobotanical remains in Chapter 10.
How each line of evidence contributes to the overall understanding of the site is strongly
conditioned by variable preservation, sampling, and recovery rates and strategies. For
example, perishable artifacts are almost entirely absent, represented only by a small
sample of archaeobotanical remains from food-getting activities. In addition, no effort
was made to recover lithic artifacts smaller than the 1/4-in mesh screens used by both
the SWT field schools and the CAS excavations. Nevertheless, these chapters present a
relatively comprehensive understanding of many aspects of prehistoric life at Zatopec.
Chapters 11 and 12, discuss some of the major themes that emerged from this
project. Zatopec was an open-air residential campsite to which prehistoric and early
historic occupants returned repeatedly over 8,000 years. Consequently, the site’s
components are complexly ordered and not always separable in excavation or analysis.
Nevertheless, some trends were observed, not only in temporally diagnostic artifacts,
but also in the various activities associated with the never-ending tasks of food
procurement while at the same time scheduling and negotiating labor roles, including
socializing children into the reference group. In the presentation of data, emphasis is
placed on context-controlled materials comparable from one time period to another.
Based on these analyses, Chapter 11 discusses the temporal and behavioral components
of the site. Almost all the data referenced in this chapter are presented in earlier parts
of the report. Chapter 12 offers some final discussions and conclusions about the site.
It is hoped that the results of this analysis-based research will not only improve our
understanding of prehistory in the San Marcos area but will also contribute to future
studies in the region and elsewhere.
Research Domains for Data Recovery at Zatopec
In planning the mitigation project, CAS outlined several important research topics
to be addressed by additional excavation and analysis of existing collections (CAS
2007). Results of the SWT field schools strongly conditioned perception of the site and
contributed significantly to the research plan.
Earlier excavations at Zatopec (Garber 1987) had identified several discrete
features and activity areas interpreted as loci of initial core reduction, tool finishing,

5

cooking, butchering, and other domestic activity (Figure 1-2). Diagnostic artifacts
indicated minor occupations in the Early and Middle Archaic, substantial occupations
in the Late and Transitional Archaic, and some occupation extending into the Late
Prehistoric (Garber 1987:19). A series of features identified as postholes and dated
to the Transitional Archaic period in the main part of the site had been interpreted
as the outlines of an oval structure measuring approximately 8 × 6 meters (Garber
1987:27). Because prehistoric domestic structures are very rare in the Central Texas
archaeological record, this evidence was viewed as extremely significant (CAS 2007:19).
Following Garber’s (1987) discussion, CAS (2007) outlined four initial goals for the
City-sponsored mitigation: (1) to examine site-formation processes and the integrity
of features; (2) to investigate the spatial organization of hunter-gatherer sites; (3)
to reconstruct, insofar as possible, past environments and patterns in resource
exploitation; and (4) to examine how technological systems of tool production were
organized through time. These goals were later refined after a clearer understanding
of the site began to emerge through the reexamination of results of the 2007–08
excavations and the analyses of the artifact assemblages from both the SWT and CAS
projects.
Poor preservation of plant remains at the site (Chapter 10) greatly limited
the development of an understanding about the paleoenvironment or ancient diet
selections. The site was found to be largely, though not entirely, deflated, with thin
sediment buildup by noncultural processes. Extensive rodent burrowing was found to
have disturbed the site in many places (Chapters 4, 5). These factors undermined the
reliability of some of the earlier interpretations and limited the conclusions that could
be reached about some of the prehistoric activities carried out at the site. Nevertheless,
the recovery in CAS excavations of evidence for a wide and complex range of behaviors
that are arguably correlated with residential camps contributes significantly to the
collective understanding of local and regional prehistory.
Revisions to the research design leave each of the four original goals essentially
intact and inform other lines of inquiry at a fundamental level. In addition to changes
in how some research questions were approached, the unanticipated recovery of three
human burials has contributed substantially to how the site is now understood.
The research goals of the mitigation project have been refined as follows:
(1) to model site formation and geologic landform accretion processes that contribute
to (or undermine) the integrity of features and contexts, and that influence sediment
depositional patterns associated with peaks or lacunae in the occupation record.
(2) to investigate the character (spatial and behavioral) of residential campsites like
Zatopec, sometimes also referred to as aggregation sites (Conkey 1980), in terms of the
activities and social processes that occurred in them.
(3) to reconstruct behaviors involving prey selection and resource exploitation,

noting how these changed through time based on taxonomically identified
zooarchaeological remains and some macrobotanical and microbotanical evidence.
(4) to examine how hunter-gatherer technological systems were organized according
to many factors including divisions of labor by age, sex, and task group. Such divisions
have been identified in most contemporary societies (Binford 1980; Brown 1970; Burton
et al. 1977; Dahlberg 1981; Hayden 1981; Hill et al. 1987; Hurtado et al. 1985; Lee and
DeVore 1968; Murdock 1937, 1949; and others) and probably existed in prehistoric times
as well (Sassaman 1992; Waguespeck 2005). An important aspect of this goal includes
the recognition of production that was unevenly organized or carried out by individuals
who display different levels of skill, grading potentially into specialized production.
Causes of Culture Change
A central premise shaping this research is that the social structure, both internal
and external, of the forager occupants of Zatopec throughout its history was much more
complex than researchers and analysts historically have assumed is characteristic of
hunting and gathering groups. Throughout the analyses reported here, explanations
for patterns in the site’s artifact record that favor individual-level decision-making,
reflective of members of social groups who occupied the site, are pursued at least as
often as explanations that focus on exogenous causes of culture change, such as climate,
environmental change, and resource availability. Although we do not consider these
externalities to be insignificant, in our view sufficient attention is rarely directed as
to how changes in the prehistoric and early historic record of Central Texas were also
shaped by internal forces. Throughout these analyses, we consider how people of the
same social unit, most likely a forager band consisting of multiple nuclear families, were
characterized by distinct personal identities, uneven levels of skills or abilities, and
disparate motivations for behavior, as well as how they were influenced by significant
(even if situational, temporary, or seasonal) social cleavage planes along which they
defined themselves apart from others within the social unit. In this sense, the current
project adopts a social archaeology approach to understanding regional prehistory
in south Central Texas in that it seeks to explain behavioral variation within social
groups, including down to the level of the individual, and focuses on lived experiences
and how these changed over time (Journal of Social Archaeology 2001). This focus
complements traditional explanations of culture change that invoke external factors as
causal agents.
Below, each of the four research topics is discussed in detail. Specific linkages are
made with data categories used to address relevant issues. Some goals are better suited
than others to the social archaeology approach described above, and many questions
remain unresolved. Yet it is anticipated that the manner in which these research issues
are treated here will allow future archaeological work to build on these ideas in ways
that will advance our collective understanding of the past.

8

Research Domain 1: Site Formation and Landform Accretion
The first goal for the Zatopec project, to establish the spatial and temporal context
and integrity of features at the site, was addressed by modeling or analyzing geologic
landform accretion and site formation processes. Accurate interpretations of patterns
and processes require an interdisciplinary approach to provide the “ultimate context”
(Goldberg and Macphail 2006) for recovered artifacts and to establish a solid foundation
upon which cultural inferences can be made. Geologic landform accretion, geomorphic
history, and site formation processes are often investigated through geoarchaeology,
a multidisciplinary approach that integrates the concepts and methodology of earth
sciences with those of archaeology.
A regional description of the dynamic landscape can be developed through
geomorphic mapping (the observation, analysis, and illustration of features on the
earth’s surface), investigation of sedimentary features, and examination of sediments
and soils, (Hugget 2007), producing a geomorphic history that can serve as a baseline
for understanding how both natural and cultural deposits may have accumulated within
an area. Studies of site formation incorporate local geomorphic history and investigate
patterns and processes associated exclusively with the natural and cultural deposits
present at the archaeological site. Site formation begins with the deposition of cultural
materials, which start at once to be dispersed and distributed by cultural and natural
processes (Schiffer 1983). Understanding an archaeological site in terms of the processes
of site formation requires an understanding of the factors affecting the distribution
of artifacts, a determination of the degree to which artifacts were disturbed, and a
consideration of the effect of these disturbances on the ability of researchers to use
contextualized data to support interpretations about past events and behaviors that
may be represented by a site’s material content.
At Zatopec, interpretations of geomorphic histories and site formation processes
seek to establish contexts in which artifacts can be used to identify and analyze cultural
characteristics. In order to establish context, investigations focus on several questions:
(1) What is the site’s location in terms of regional and local geomorphology?
(2) What is the site’s context in terms of litho- and pedostratigraphy?
(3) How might regional and local geomorphic histories affect natural and cultural
deposits, and how can these patterns and processes be identified in the stratigraphy?
(4) To what degree have cultural deposits been disturbed by cultural and natural
processes?
(5) How do these factors affect depositional integrity and site interpretation?
Methods employed to address topics of geomorphic history and site formation
processes are divided into two arenas. Field methodology includes all geomorphic and
stratigraphic studies that took place in the field. Laboratory methodology encompasses

9

all subsequent analyses of the collected samples and synthesis of all data.
Methodologies
A preliminary investigation of regional geology provides the basis for geomorphic
and stratigraphic research. Additionally, a review of topographic maps and previous
archaeological and geoarchaeological work in the region helps to define a site's location
on the landscape, determine what methods might be necessary to address research
objectives, and understand the context of the site in terms of identified landforms and
depositional units. In the field, observations made through pedestrian reconnaissance
supplement studies of regional geology, topography, and previous investigations and
precisely place the site within the context of the local landscape.
The on-site part of field methodologies includes an integration of litho- and
pedostratigraphies for investigating site formation. Lithostratigraphic units are
unaltered bodies of sediment that are distinguishable by texture and/or structure from
overlying and underlying strata. Pedostratigraphic units are discernable bodies of
sediment that have been altered by pedogenesis, or soil formation. Lithostratigraphy
offers insights into depositional processes and origin of sediments, and pedostratigraphy
characterizes post-depositional processes. An integrated description of the
stratigraphies provides information about the nature, distribution, and disturbance of
natural and cultural deposits, and is obtained through observation and examination of
sediment granulometrics (e.g., composition, texture, sorting, particle shape, structure,
color, etc.). Although field observations may provide sufficient information to develop
accurate descriptions, supplementary laboratory analyses are often needed to test
field hypotheses. Bulk sediment samples are collected to provide a volume of matrix
sufficient for both granulometric examinations made in the field as well as subsequent
laboratory analyses. Since additional lines of evidence often enhance interpretation,
samples for magnetic susceptibility and micromorphology may also be collected.
Methods employed in the laboratory include analysis of samples collected in the field
and synthesis of all data.
Samples were collected during the fieldwork at Zatopec for the analyses of bulk
sediment, magnetic susceptibility, and micromorphology. Bulk sediment samples
provide a large enough volume of sediment to supplement field assessments of texture,
carbonate content, and percent coarse grain fragments with laboratory analyses.
Results of these analyses indicate characteristics of depositional and post-depositional
processes affecting site formation.
In the laboratory, accurate proportions of sand, silt, and clay can be measured
through a series of drying, sieving, and settling. Results of this analysis indicate how
sediments were deposited and provide descriptive statistics that can be compared
with strata in the same profile and across the site. Soil calcium carbonate content
is measured through an elaborate series of reduction techniques and, like texture,

10

provides descriptive statistics that can be compared within the profile and across the
site. Calcium carbonate content in soils can indicate soil formation processes and, in
some cases, temporal limitations.
At Zatopec, investigations of geomorphic history and site formation processes were
performed by geoarchaeologist Dr. Charles Frederick, and are presented in Chapter 4.
Interpretations are based on the observation and analyses of four profiles, A–D, exposed
by test unit excavations (Figure 1-3). Columns were collected from each profile in 5 cm
increments and analyzed for different kinds of data pertaining to the character of the
site’s deposits. For each profile, calcium carbonate content (CCE) was measured as a
percentage, magnetic susceptibility values were recorded, and texture was calculated
by percentage of clast size (gravel, sand, silt, and clay). For two profiles (C and D), firecracked rock (FCR) and debitage collected in each of the samples were quantified by
count and/or weight. Texture defines the physical characteristics of grains composing the
sediment and indicates depositional environment. Sorting is a measure of sand, silt, and
clay proportions composing the sediment and also provides information about the nature
of the deposit. Structure is a description of deposition. Color is described using standard
Munsell Soil Color Charts and can indicate weathering characteristics and age (Goldberg
and Macphail 2006). Together, these data are useful for indicating “peaks” in cultural
materials, disruptions in depositional continuity, and possible sources and processes
for sedimentation. Finally, the mean particle size and degree of sorting for each profile
was recorded to assess the comparability of deposits throughout the site. Results were
evaluated against other regional models of alluvial buildup during the Holocene epoch.
The geoarchaeological analysis indicates that most sediments at Zatopec had been
deposited at the site by the middle Holocene, and that most of the upper deposits
had been formed as a result of cultural activity and natural disturbances (e.g.,
pedoturbation). In view of these findings, it is important to note that some parts of
the site were found to contain relatively intact deposits showing few or no signs of
disturbance. Although Zatopec does not present an ideal instance of clearly stratified
deposits and isolable cultural components, intact deposits were present in some places
at the site. These deposits were defined using multiple lines of temporal data to form
the basis for interpretations about the site’s history (Chapters 5, 6, 7, 9, 10).
Research Domain 2: The Character of Residential Sites
When the site was first reported, based on Garber’s (1987) identification of possible
postholes and the interpretation of these as the remains of a domestic structure (see
discussion of features in Chapter 5), Zatopec was identified as a residential campsite.
The subsequent mitigation project was designed in part to recover evidence needed
to test this interpretation. CAS excavations, however, failed to recover unambiguous
evidence of a structure. Many intrusive discolorations observed by Garber were later
identified as rodent burrows; others did not conform to the predicted spatial pattern of

11

Figure 1-3. Location of the four profiles, A–D, examined to study site depositional history
and processes.

Garber’s (1987) proposed circular features (see Chapter 5). Nevertheless, it is important
to note that although the earlier interpretation of the presence of a structure is not
supported by the results of the CAS excavations, neither do the more recent findings
contained in this report refute that interpretation. (See Chapter 5 for a discussion of all
features recorded at Zatopec.)

12

Based on the nature and abundance of material remains as well as the presence
of human burials, Zatopec clearly was a residential site. Given the initial questions
guiding the data recovery, this project provided an excellent opportunity to examine
the nature of social processes and activities that distinguish some kinds of residential
camps from others. From background data informing the current analysis, it is evident
that not all residential campsites were the same. Furthermore, it is also apparent
that archaeologists working in Texas have not yet defined the full range of variability
for residential sites. Consequently, an important objective of the current analysis is
to expand the analysis of different kinds of residential sites. In this case, we focus
specifically on identifying the characteristics that define residential sites and consider
the various decisions that were made concerning where, how often, how long, and by
whom sites were occupied.
Nominally, residential sites are places of overnight stays by social groups of different
sizes for spans of time ranging from one or two nights to several weeks or months
(Tomka and Perttula 1997:4–11). Based on combinations among varying lengths of
stay, size of the occupant group, and the kinds of activities being pursued from a
specific place, many different kinds of residential sites can be envisioned. Binford
(1980:9) defines a residential base, the kind of residential site most similar to Zatopec,
as “the hub of subsistence activities, the locus out of which foraging parties originate
and where most processing, manufacturing, and maintenance activities take place.”
According to Thomas (1985:238), residential bases share basic commonalities such as
domestic dwellings, site furniture, specialized utilitarian structures and outdoor work
spaces, service centers, diversified tool fabrication and repair, child rearing, diversified
food consumption, etc. Yet, the amount of time devoted to each activity, as well as
who carried them out and which tool kit(s) are used, all depend quite strongly on
external factors having to do with patterns of temporary occupation, mobility, and labor
organization for carrying out important tasks.
Residential Mobility: “Simple” Subsistence versus Aggregation
Residential mobility based on the seasonal availability of important food resources
is well documented among contemporary hunter-gatherer societies (Binford 1980;
Gamble and Boismier 1991; Kelly 1995; Lee and Daly 1999; Lee and DeVore 1968),
and is also firmly established in hunter-gatherer archaeology. Because mobile huntergatherers seldom employ technologies for creating or storing food surpluses, as available
foodstuffs are depleted within the nearby area of a site, residential camps are relocated
elsewhere. However, residential mobility is not only conducted in relation to shifting
resource availability; equally important is what Lee (1979) calls the cycle of aggregation/
dispersion. This cycle describes the periodic aggregation of several smaller groups
(microbands, nuclear groups, households, etc.) into larger groupings (macrobands) for
certain periods over different times of the year. Aggregations are scheduled, like most
hunter-gatherer activities, with seasonal resource considerations in mind, but they also

13

occur for many other reasons that are of considerable importance in understanding
hunter-gatherer societies.
Aggregations have been noted among many contemporary hunter-gatherers (Binford
1980; Gould 1969; Lee 1976, 1979; Steward 1938; Wilmsen 1973; see Binford 2001) and
are also commonly used to understand prehistoric hunter-gatherers (e.g., Conkey 1980,
1991; Meltzer 2004; Robinson et al. 2009; Shott 2004; Wadley 1989; Wilmsen 1974;
Yellen 1976). The primary reason for aggregation processes involves the relationship
between seasonal availability of food resources and social group size (Tomka and
Perttula 1997; Tomka et al. 1997). Although variations exist according to latitude,
climate, and other factors, the general pattern for hunter-gatherer aggregations is for
large groups to fission into small microbands during lean seasons and to reaggregate
during periods when food resources are more abundant (Hurtado and Hill 1990:264).
Although essentially a subsistence-based cycle, the aggregation/dispersion pattern
also influences most other aspects of hunter-gatherer culture. Hurtado and Hill
(1990:293) argue that “Because seasonality influences the food supply, and this in turn
constrains many other aspects of economic and social life, simple changes in rainfall and
temperature patterns can result in an almost endless array of subsequent ramifications
that may ultimately influence work patterns, marriage, social structure, and ritual
cycles.”
Residential mobility and the aggregation/dispersion cycle shape site residential
characteristics in many ways, including whether camps are occupied by micro- or
macro-bands, how long sites are occupied, and how habitation factors into resource
extraction that takes place away from camp. Therefore, considerable variation is seen
in residential sites where bands aggregate, depending on the length and season of
stay, the frequency and interval of visits, the number of people involved, and the kinds
and intensity of activities that were carried out. In terms of regional patterns that
included Zatopec, understanding these factors and how they changed over time is a
fundamental task for archaeologists dealing with large residential camps. Clearly, when
considering the kinds of other social activities mentioned by Hurtado and Hill (1990),
the definitions offered by Binford (1980) and Thomas (1985) barely scratch the surface
of variation in hunter-gatherer residential camps. For example, previous attention to
differences between residential sites in Texas focuses on chronological trends (Prewitt
1981), documenting environmental adaptations (Collins 1995; Weir 1976), or the everpresent need for a reliable food supply (Tomka and Perttula 1997). Often overlooked in
favor of questions of chronology, settlement, and subsistence is the fullest possible range
of behaviors that occurred at residential sites where bands aggregated, what kinds of
remains these behaviors might leave in the material record, and how those remains
might be used in the study of internally diverse social groups.
Although subsistence-related activities are among the most important scheduling
priorities for hunter-gatherers, such activities are not the only important considerations

14

that condition(ed) residential site characteristics. Concerning non-subsistence aspects of
residential sites where multiple microbands come together, Margaret Conkey (1980:610)
notes that “The motives for forming such (large seasonal) groups, have over and over
again been shown to be social as well as economic.” An example of one such motive is
extending social networks. Damas (1969:52; cited in Conkey 1980:610) observes that
at autumn Eskimo gatherings, “economic activities were virtually at a standstill” as
individuals and families focused on establishing and maintaining important social
relationships through the exchange of marriage partners and sharing of food and by
exchanging goods that were not otherwise available. Richard Lee (1979) also notes that
ritual events help integrate nuclear microbands into seasonal macrobands. Lee (1979)
defines trance-dance curing and men’s initiations as common events at larger seasonal
sites of the Kalahari !Kung San. In central Australia, Merwyn Meggitt (1962) refers to
the macroband phase of Walbiri settlement as the “ceremonial season,” and describes
initiation and other rituals that are performed at such occasions (cited in Cashdan
1989:34). On the basis of these ethnographic accounts, archaeologists should also
consider the non-subsistence aspects of the aggregation/dispersion cycle.
Conkey (1980, 1991) was among the first archaeologists to systematically examine
residential aggregation involving the integration of multiple microbands and the setting
in which social, economic, and ritual activities were carried out. Her studies, along with
others, provide an important comparative framework for understanding archaeological
remains of sites like Zatopec. According to Conkey (1980:612), aggregation sites are
places where “affiliated groups and individuals come together… The occasions for
concentration may be ecologically or ritually/socially prompted, and there must be
processes that effect the integration and allow the aggregation to take place… Many
different persons may move in and out of the aggregated group, so that although group
size remains relatively constant group composition varies radically.” Importantly,
she defines some traits that can be expected of aggregation sites. These are (1) larger
group size than found at short-term camps; (2) seasonal occupation, perhaps repeated,
corresponding with available nearby resources; (3) patterning in where activities were
carried out; (4) maintenance of some site features; (5) a greater total diversity or range
of activities than seen at short-term camps or resource extraction locales, including
some that do not occur at these other kinds of sites; (6) ecological factors that may
prompt, contribute to, or facilitate aggregation, such as a resource-rich setting or an
attractive locale; and (7) the integration of regional peoples (Conkey 1980:612). She
subsequently (1991) has discussed how these sites are ideal contexts for identifying
gendered roles, specifically those involving female work and socialization, as well as
social roles based on differences in age. As will be seen, Zatopec contains evidence for
many of these traits.

15

In addition to the lists compiled by Conkey (1980, 1991), Hurtado and Hill (1990),
and others, another characteristic aspect of aggregation sites involves labor pooling, the
scheduling of certain tasks during aggregation cycles to correspond with the presence of
several individuals closely related in age, sex, and/or aptitude and who compose discrete
task groups. Pooling labor is made possible during periods or settings of seasonal
resource abundance, where adequate foodstuffs are available in sufficient quantities to
free up individuals’ time so that they may pursue other tasks. Lee (1979) notes that the
amount of labor expended by any single individual may increase under these conditions,
meaning that the internal logic of labor organization found in aggregation sites cannot
be understood in strictly effort-minimizing terms. Nevertheless, Conkey (1980:610)
notes that labor pooling in these circumstances contributes to, or is associated with
increases in resource variety, quantity, and reliability. An outcome of food stability
is the significant easing of scheduling requirements for repairing tool kits, restocking
hunting and trapping gear, and other productive tasks. In other words, food stability
allows replenishing or replacing equipment and gearing up so that future excursions
may occur at a more deliberate pace. Aggregation sites differ markedly in this regard
from short-term camps or extraction sites where time or material shortages often
preclude extensive reworking of tools beyond what is necessary to minimize the risk of
equipment failure at the next encounter (e.g., Bleed 1986; Bousman 1993; Kelly 1988).
In the current analysis, we relate this specifically to technological innovation and/
or evidence for inefficient use of materials that indicates practice, skill acquisition, or
learning. This may be especially true for curated or formal tool technologies (Binford
1979; see below and Chapter 7) that involve high labor costs for production and
maintenance.
Based on abundant ethnographic and historical data, as well as the interpretation
of archaeological remains, aggregation represents an important counterpart to “only”
food-getting in determining the settlement-mobility patterns for hunter-gatherers.
Many of the activities that take place during aggregation periods are decidedly
“social” in nature, possibly including ritual ceremonies; food, partner, and information
exchange; integration of multiple group identities; labor pooling by temporary (seasonal)
task groups; and negotiated social roles by age, sex, and gender. Other activities are
more strictly technological, such as tool manufacture and refurbishment. Yet, since
these activities also take place under conditions of pooled expertise they may also
involve socialization of younger or less adept individuals, meaning that even the most
technological activities seen in aggregation sites carry major non-utilitarian, nonsubsistence implications.

16

Archaeological Evidence for Zatopec as an Aggregation Site
According to Conkey (1980, 1991), at least eight characteristics or traits define
aggregation sites. These include (1) larger group size than found at short-term camps;
(2) seasonal occupation corresponding with available resources; (3) spatial patterning of
some activities; (4) maintenance of site features; (5) greater diversity of activities than
seen at short-term camps or resource extraction locales; (6) ecological factors, such as
a resource-rich setting, that contribute to aggregation; (7) the integration of regional
peoples; and (8) openly expressed identities according to age, sex, and gender. Following
Lee (1979), to this list we add (9) organizing labor in ways that concentrate certain
resource extraction (seen as specialization), facilitate other important social activities
such as learning and enculturation, or that appear as “inefficient.”
Since many of these traits can apply to almost any kind of residential site, the
potential of the aggregation concept has limited utility as a way to single out the kinds
of social behaviors associated with them. Furthermore, aggregation cycles have seldom
been addressed by archaeologists in Texas, and an inventory of possible aggregation
sites, as distinct from an inventory of residential camps, is lacking. Nevertheless,
although it may be difficult to apply the concept of aggregation in reconstructions of
regional hunter-gatherer adaptations and cultural practices, we believe that meaningful
distinctions can and should be made among residential camps in ways that can be
correlated with specific archaeological evidence. Distinguishing between different kinds
of residential camps would allow archaeologists to model seasonal settlement mobility
patterns and associated oscillations in regional aggregation/dispersion cycles that were
specific to different archaeological cultures, or to recognize prehistoric hunter-gatherer
“central places” in ways that help delimit territorial ranges. Moreover, correlating
these patterns across large areas could help in the recognition of important events
including cultural displacement or in-migrations, or in understanding responses to
severe climatic or environmental changes. Of course, by using models of social formation
and adaptation based on aggregation patterns, archaeologists can begin addressing
some ephemeral or intangible aspects of hunter-gatherer societies, such as behavioral
variation by age, sex, or gender.
Distinguishing aggregation sites from other residential camps involves not only
identifying specific archaeological criteria that correspond with the nine traits discussed
above, but also compiling a regional inventory of candidates for aggregation locales that
can be compared against one another, and against residential camps that do not meet
all the criteria of true macroband aggregation sites. In terms of material correlates,
issues of group size (Trait 1) and the diversity of activities (Trait 5) that are carried out
can be addressed by examining the quantity of artifacts and features present (these
must be controlled for the length of archaeological periods and the size of excavated
samples for meaningful comparison, see Chapter 3), and the ranges of behaviors they
represent. Feature maintenance (Trait 4) can be seen in how some site furniture, such

17

as hearths, storage pits, or even burial locations, are reused from one visitation to
the next. Spatial patterning (Trait 3) refers to how transient activities are located in
and around more permanent fixtures that structure site layout from one visitation to
the next. Spatial patterning and feature maintenance are closely related, and can be
used to argue for cultural continuity of occupation. (The ability to recognize spatial
patterning, or features for that matter, requires site preservation and geoarchaeological
contextual integrity, which are of limited utility at Zatopec.) Seasonality of occupation
(Trait 2) and resource richness (Trait 6) are more difficult to reconstruct from the
archaeological record, necessarily relying on organic (including faunal) preservation
and archaeologists’ ability to reconstruct ancient environments. At Zatopec, this is not
possible for most contexts or time periods. However, some faunal and microbotanical
data indicate late summer to fall occupation for some time periods (Chapters 9, 10), and
attempts were made to reconstruct faunal resource diversity (also called richness) for
different time periods and compare these to other regional assemblages (Chapter 9).
Integrating regional peoples (Trait 7) is an important aspect of aggregation sites, and
could be seen in the presence of symbolically significant artifact styles. These include
not only different point types, but may also include carved bone pendants, shell gorgets
and disks, and carved and painted pebbles. In open campsites like Zatopec, organic
remains including clothing, footwear, and possible hair ornaments are rarely preserved,
leaving archaeologists reliant on non-perishable remains.
Defining material correlates for the final trait identified above, labor organization
resulting in technological variation that can be identified as innovative, inefficient,
specialized, or distinctly age- or gender-based, is a complicated task. In this analysis,
we identify technological organization as a separate research goal (see below). Although
technological organization is discussed in more detail below, here we summarize
some possible material correlates for labor organization (Trait 9) that can arguably
be associated with aggregation sites. Archaeologists can seek evidence for different
forms of labor organization in several ways. One includes labor pooling and increased
cooperation among task groups, resulting in eased scheduling concerns. A relaxed
schedule allows toolmakers to invest time experimenting with new technologies and,
importantly, to train novice toolmakers. Technological experimentation may appear as
well-made but hard-to-classify tool forms; training activity is recognized as evidence
of some individuals first acquiring or developing their skills in important crafts. The
Zatopec assemblage was evaluated for evidence such as learning, innovation, and
occupational specialization as small components of the larger question of how occupants
at the site organized their technological activities.
Cautionary Notes and Concluding Thoughts on Aggregation
On the basis of Traits 1–7 alone, a case can be made that Zatopec indeed represents
a prehistoric aggregation site. The merits for this interpretation are discussed in
greater detail in Chapters 11 and 12. However, it is acknowledged that there is no

18

current unambiguous archaeological standard of evidence for classifying a site as an
aggregation site. Instead, we outline the aggregation issue, consider its implications for
Zatopec, and recommend that it be pursued in the analyses of other possible aggregation
sites. It is appropriate to note that Zatopec is viewed as a kind of aggregation locale,
somewhat reduced in scale in relation to other such sites, and that this label best
applies to the site only for some time periods. Clearly, other sites in Central Texas
are better candidates for representing the largest of macroband aggregation locales,
such as those located in prime settings near large springs on the eastern face of the
Balcones Escarpment located in New Braunfels, San Marcos, Austin, and farther
north. Consequently, we conclude that, in cases where evidence is present but not
overwhelming, aggregation should be used as a framework for qualitatively comparing
differences among large residential campsites.
An additional consideration is how site use changed over time. Since aggregation
has a fundamental relationship to subsistence as well as to other “social” factors,
major changes in subsistence practices and regimes should result in changes in how
sites were visited. Aggregation sites for one time period may not have been used in the
same way in earlier or later periods. At Zatopec, using radiocarbon (Chapter 5) as well
as technological evidence from stone tool assemblages (Chapter 7), we see significant
differences in how the site was used and frequency of visitation from the Late Archaic 2
and Austin times to Toyah times (see Chapter 2 for cultural chronology and Chapter 3
for how these temporal intervals are defined at Zatopec). If Zatopec was an aggregation
locale of moderate size in Late Archaic 2 and Austin times—and we think it was— we
cannot presently say that the site maintained this status in Toyah times. Regardless
of how we identify this particular issue, the fundamentally different ways in which
some sites were used and how often they were visited is a topic that requires additional
research.
Research Domain 3: Prey Selection and Resource Exploitation
Analytic goals at Zatopec focus on a series of questions about social organizations and
technological behaviors of the site’s prehistoric occupants, and how these changed
over time. These analyses explore the “residential” character of a site that was
serially occupied by internally diverse social groups (Research Domain 2), considering
implications for technological behaviors, divisions of labor, task scheduling, learning
and skill transmission, possible specialized undertakings, and competition for social
status (Research Domain 4). Both of these areas of research are considered within a
geoarchaeological understanding of the site’s depositional history and stratigraphic
integrity (Research Domain 1). Decisions about which food resources to exploit under
what conditions are closely related to these issues, particularly for hunter-gatherer
societies who were continuously on the move in search of food. Reconstruction of these
resource selections is the thematic focus of Research Domain 3.

19

Resource Exploitation and Food Sharing
The primary goal of Research Domain 3 is to reconstruct a species inventory for
animals found at Zatopec and to investigate whether, and if so how, certain foods at
different periods of time functioned as commodities for establishing or maintaining
social networks, contributed to individual and/or group identities, or were associated
with particular technological requirements for their exploitation. This approach requires
(1) accurate identification of taxa present by time at Zatopec, (2) consideration of how
these taxa were involved in important social relationships among and between site
occupants, and (3) correlation of these results with those of the technological analysis.
In the present analysis, this approach considers evidence for different patterns not
only in hunting, but also in food sharing. Examining food sharing over time at Zatopec
raises important methodological issues for recognizing the distribution of elements, not
only at this site but also at other sites in order to present the Zatopec data in a regional
perspective.
Recent studies (Gurven and Hill 2009; also Binford 1978; Enloe 2004; Kaplan
and Hill 1985; Kelly 1995; Wenzel et al. 2000; and others) examine the complexity of
motivations among hunters to share food, especially protein, beyond the purpose of
providing sustenance. One of the conclusions of these studies is that the advantages
resulting from greater than average hunting success and the apportioning out of the
resulting kill, can take several forms. Successful hunting, particularly of large animals
associated with higher risk-taking and requiring extended forays at a considerable
distance from residential camps (referred to as logistical forays, Binford 1980), has
repeatedly been shown to be positively associated with status gains (Hawkes 1991;
Hawkes et al. 2001; Wiessner 1996), success in mating competition (Kaplan and Hill
1985), better offspring survivorship (Hill and Hurtado 1996), higher biological fitness
(Smith 2004), and other social advantages (see Gurven and Hill 2009). Each of these
advantages accrues separately and in addition to the satisfaction of basic dietary needs,
and can be described as serving individual interests at the expense of overall group
well-being. Hence these potential advantages resulting from outstanding hunting skill
represent inegalitarian (cf. Flanagan 1989) motivations for the preferential or uneven
sharing of food resources.
Informed by this work, one working hypothesis addressed in Research Domain 3 is
that many of the prehistoric choices that shaped the Zatopec faunal assemblage were
driven as much by efforts by individuals to achieve or gain status or advantage over
others, even if acting on behalf of offspring, pair-bonds, or other immediate family
members, as they were to reinforce egalitarian social bonds and ties or simply to obtain
sufficient food supplies. Because these rationales for sharing are not mutually exclusive
(Gurven and Hill 2009), archaeological models of prey selection behavior over time that
accommodate multiple motivations for food sharing are likely to be more accurate and to
provide better, more comprehensive explanations of past behavior. As discussed below

20

(and in Chapter 9), reconstructing food-sharing practices at Zatopec is difficult. Yet
correlating which anatomical elements from what key species are strongly represented
on site versus those found missing in high frequencies reveals to some degree which
choice portions were returned to camp versus being consumed off-site, perhaps at the
location of the kill, and how these patterns shifted over time with focused reliance on
particularly important species.
Technological and Residential Implications of a Big Game Focus
A second hypothesis for this research domain is that, due to the benefits that come
with successful exploitation of large mammals, defined at Zatopec specifically as bison,
periods during which big game hunting was particularly important were likely to be
characterized by notable shifts in other food selections, as well as in technological
production, the scheduling and pooling of labor, and the negotiation of age and gender
roles. In order to evaluate this hypothesis, an effort was made to define periods of
bison abundance for Zatopec and the surrounding region. Similar studies conducted
previously are problematic in that they depend too heavily on the recovery of bison in
often poorly resolved or poorly dated strata in open-air sites, similar to Zatopec. To
address this problem, the current project attempted to date directly bison remains
recovered from excavations. The result is two kinds of data on bison presence and
abundance at Zatopec: one based on archaeological association in excavated strata and
the other on directly dated bison remains (Chapter 9, and also discussed in Chapter 5).
These findings provide an important temporal context for understanding other activities
not only involving tool manufacture but also related to food-getting. This hypothesis by
no means indicates a belief that bison were the most important food resource available
to prehistoric inhabitants at Zatopec, only that periods of oscillating focus on big
game had important implications for other food-related activities. This inquiry could
theoretically be structured in the same way using any other subsistence resource that
fluctuated in availability over time.
In this regard, prey selection and resource exploitation (Research Domain 3) offer
complementary lines of evidence that can support conclusions drawn from technological
analyses (Research Domain 4) showing how certain individuals engaged in tasks that
were inefficient in terms of the time involved or raw material wasted, were specific to a
particular task group, or that demonstrated increasing amounts of skill that set those
individuals apart from others. As with technological production (Lohse 2009, 2010;
see below), it is unlikely that meaningful differences in the skill of individual hunters
could be accurately assessed except between the very worst and the very best, even by
members of these forager groups (see Hill and Kintigh 2009; Koster 2010). Still, the
benefits beyond simple provisioning associated with successful big game hunting are
cross-culturally consistent and reliable enough to allow archaeologists to extend this
relationship into the past and consider how such benefits may have been realized in

21

prehistoric contexts. When viewed in conjunction with technological tasks associated
with bison exploitation that were themselves demanding and carried high rates of
failure (see Research Domain 4, below), a view emerges in which some individuals may
have enjoyed opportunities to achieve, at least temporarily, social status gains over
others by excelling at high-risk, high-reward tasks. In the context of residential camps
like Zatopec, it is impossible to identify the success rate of individuals over different
time periods and thereby to evaluate hunters against one another. It is possible,
however, to consider from different perspectives the relationships between logistical
hunters of big game and the rest of the social group, including those who hunted and
gathered small- and medium-sized prey that were available nearby.
Changes in resource exploitation may bring about increases in logistical forays to
obtain non-local food stuffs related to or occurring independent of residential mobility,
providing evidence for larger shifts in settlement mobility in terms of length and
frequency of site occupation. Additionally, changes in the availability of key species may
have resulted in new schemes of labor organization involving hunting strategies, new
technological approaches to ensure food-getting, or new patterns of food sharing. Any of
these could have either leveled uneven access to important resources or emphasized and
reinforced status gains by individuals better able to exploit those resources. These kinds
of shifts have implications for how small- or medium-sized bands sustained themselves
at temporary residential camps like Zatopec.
Testing each of these possibilities involves analyzing faunal records for evidence
of changes in the availability of key resources over time and considering possible
implications for those changes. (At Zatopec, archaeobotanical evidence is not well
enough preserved to be used in this analysis.) For example, differentiated food
acquisition reflecting increases or decreases in the variety of food source might be
associated with new gender- or age-based task divisions, and could have been made
necessary by shifts in settlement mobility or environmental change. Additionally,
preferential access to a high-fat or high-protein diet by some individuals may reflect
new or exacerbated inequalities among hunter-gatherers. However, a special note
is warranted concerning the use of certain faunal taxa, specifically bison, in this
analysis. Archaeologists in Central Texas and the larger Southern Plains have long
focused on bison as a key subsistence resource (Baugh 1986; Collins 2004; Creel
1990, 1991; Dillehay 1974; Huebner 1991; Lynott 1979; Prewitt 1981b; see Mauldin
et al. 2010). An unintended result of this analytical focus has been the unbalanced
emphasis on contributions of what implicitly have been understood as primarily malefocused activities (e.g., big-game, logistical hunting) to overall group subsistence and
technology. The current analysis of Zatopec fauna focuses on bison, but also considers
the importance of bison compared to other resources.

22

Methodological Approaches: Local and Regional Comparisons
In pursuing this research, analysis of Zatopec fauna is focused on two related
issues: (1) patterns in food sharing among site occupants, and (2) changes in hunting
strategies over time reflective of shifting availability of certain key resources (e.g.,
bison). Addressing these issues requires comparative research at two scales. One scale
is local, and considers changes in the animal portion of diet-related behavior at Zatopec
over time. The other scale is regional and involves comparing the Zatopec assemblage to
others in Central Texas. This comparison contextualizes faunal exploitation at Zatopec
compared to other sites occupied during the same time periods to present a larger view
of food-getting strategies by Central Texas hunter-gatherers. This scale of analysis
helps identify periods during which some prey, such as bison, may have been pursued
disproportionately over other prey and corrects for possible biases in how regional
patterns are understood as a result of site-specific practices or differential preservation.
Important to each analysis is change through time and controlling for sample size (see
Chapter 3 for a definition of analytical units). Poor preservation is an issue for all time
periods represented at Zatopec, but especially earlier ones. Particular questions for
each scale of consideration are discussed below, and both rely on a detailed taxonomic
description of all fauna recovered from the site, including discussion of bone condition
and possible modification (Chapter 9).
Local Scale
Patterns of faunal consumption at Zatopec can contribute to an understanding of
relationships among prehistoric occupants of the site by helping address patterns of
resource sharing over time in relation to contributions to diet. Decisions about which
prey to pursue, as well as how differently valued portions are shared among people
who hunt near the camp versus those pursuing big game can be assessed in the
zooarchaeological record. Anticipating regional patterns, site data show that, as bison
became more important in the Late Prehistoric, both medium- and small-body game
became proportionally less well represented at Zatopec. Based on this evidence alone, it
appears that big game hunting at the site came at the expense of other targeted prey,
resulting in a scenario wherein the potential for status competition among big game
hunters likewise increased. Important implications must also be considered for the
effect of this marked shift in localized hunting strategy on intra-group social relations
and labor roles with respect to food procurement and processing (discussed in Research
Domain 4, below). Within this context it is not possible to ascribe hunting success to any
individual hunter at Zatopec. However, it remains possible to reconstruct some patterns
of food resource allocation that took place at the camp and that represent relationships
between logistical hunters and the rest of their social units.
To examine the relationship between successful hunting and some of the social
benefits derived from it, the Zatopec assemblage was assessed for evidence of uneven

23

meat consumption. The investigation first identified which anatomical parts were
present at the site, general evidence of on-site sharing, versus which parts were absent.
Second, analyses considered the nutritional (fat) value of each part in order to rank the
nutritional quality of parts that were consumed (shared) on-site versus those consumed
off-site. Since patterns of sharing between nuclear units at the site is not possible at
Zatopec as it is in other, better preserved contexts (e.g., Enloe 2004), this analysis
focused on uneven consumption between individuals directly responsible for hunting
and those at camp with whom butchered remains would have been shared. John Speth
(1990) argues that some hunters who pursue prey away from camp will often consume
portions of the kill with the highest nutritional values at the kill site, and bring back
lower-ranked portions. He suggests that, in order to evaluate nutritional equity in
sharing, one needs to know (1) who gets each part of the carcass, (2) the fat content of
each part, (3) the physiological condition of who gets fat-rich parts versus that of those
who get lean parts. Because small- and medium-bodied prey can be hunted in relative
proximity to the camp, including distances within which females hunt, assessing the
unequal consumption of meat based on portion representation within a residential
assemblage addresses inequality between some men, those who participate in logistical,
off-site hunting, and all others who remain at camp, including many (or most) women,
and other males too young, old, or unskilled to participate in logistical forays.
Admittedly, the third factor, the physiological condition of site occupants, cannot
be known from available data. Yet the first and second factors, consumers of carcass
parts and the fat value of each part, can be at least partially reconstructed, which in the
current analysis is accomplished by rank-ordering anatomical parts according to their
nutritional value and statistically demonstrating the representation of each part in
relation to the rest of the faunal assemblage for each time period (AU). In this analysis,
rank-ordering elements by nutritional value (presented as a utility index; see Chapter
9) involved classifying them as high, medium, or low, following methods employed by
Binford (1978) and Metcalf and Jones (1988). Within each time period, the frequency
of each body part for bison is calculated to recognize possible shifts in meat-sharing
behavior. These frequencies are compared with comparable data for antelope and deer,
both classified as medium-sized. Although data are limited by small sample size, they
do show that as bison utility increases slightly in Toyah times, deer/antelope utility
noticeably decreases. This comparison, which seems to indicate that deer/antelope are
consumed in increasingly unequal ways when bison are more widely shared, allows
analysts to suggest possible changes in meat-sharing of other species during periods of
increased bison frequency.
Regional Scale
Following initial identification and description and consideration of local-scale
patterns, the faunal assemblage at Zatopec is described in relation to others from the

24

region by measures such as assemblage diversity and richness. This analysis uses the
body-size data derived in the consideration of local patterns, as well as species data
to indicate prey selection. Assemblage percentage by body size was first standardized
by sample size and then compared with some other regional assemblages that have
been reported in a level of detail sufficient for comparison with Zatopec. To the degree
possible, this comparison follows the time periods identified at Zatopec, although
common time periods are not defined the same way at all sites. Questions considered
at this level of comparison include: How does bison availability change during each
time period? During times of greater bison abundance (when overall representation
increases), does bison consumption become more important to overall group diet than
other prey selections? That is, during periods of bison increase, did other game become
less important or were they relied upon as heavily as in previous periods?
An example of a pattern that could emerge from this comparison that would help
address how labor was organized is a strong reliance on logistically organized biggame hunting versus reliance on medium- and small-bodied animals for particular
time periods. Highly diverse (in terms of body size) regional assemblages could be
argued to be a measure of equitable contributions to group diets from many different
kinds of individuals, such as those who engage in dangerous logistical hunting as well
as those who remain closer to the camp. Earlier studies proposed periods of presence
and absence of bison in various regions of the Southern High Plains (Dillehay 1974).
A recent evaluation of 141 components from 77 Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric
sites from Central and South Texas (Mauldin et al. 2010), together with proxy data
for paleoenvironmental and climate change, however, concludes that bison were
always present (at least over these time intervals), but that frequency became more
erratic in the Terminal Late Prehistoric (Toyah) period as temperatures warmed and
rainfall became increasingly patchy. Other models have been proposed as well, with
the accuracy of their reconstructions depending on how bison data are considered and
placed into temporal categories (Figure 1-4). All studies agree, however, that bison
became significantly more common in archaeological assemblages dating to the Toyah
interval than in previous times. As a result, the dramatic increase of bison remains on
Toyah sites does not seem to reflect a new focus on this resource as an important food
(or economic; see Creel 1991) resource, but rather a marked shift toward logistically
organized hunting strategies that focused on bison herds that were wandering ever
farther afield in search of viable rangelands. The present analysis considers whether
this pattern can be seen at Zatopec as well.
Regional assemblages were assessed for richness, or the diversity of species
represented, and for how evenly each species present was represented in the
assemblage. Some temporal changes are noted, with Archaic assemblages generally
appearing more diverse and evenly distributed than earlier and later periods. However,
important differences by site are also evident that must be taken into consideration
when drawing conclusions about regional patterns of faunal exploitation.

25

Conclusions
This analysis looks at how faunal exploitation and consumption at Zatopec changed
over time and also considers trends across the region. From a regional perspective, it
is important to identify periods in the cultural chronology during which certain game,
particularly bison, were both abundant (absolute abundance) and proportionately
more important than other available game (relative abundance). This assessment
help analysts understand the role that big-game hunting may have had on regional
technological assemblages, the scheduling and tasking of labor for regional huntergatherer societies at Zatopec and nearby sites, periods of change for labor-related gender
roles, and possible scenarios for increasing competition between big game hunters.
From a local perspective, it is important to consider how bison was shared among site
occupants in relation to other game in terms of nutritional value, as well as the amount
of time spent exploiting those additional resources. Using deer and antelope for a
comparison of meat-sharing activities, some changes are evident. Comparing frequency
trends for these two classes against the occurrence of small game (not ranked by utility
index) allows analysts to reconstruct important changes in behavior concerning the
focused economic exploitation of a specific prey, bison. In and of themselves, these data
illustrate important shifts in economic (subsistence-related) activities and relationships
between site inhabitants. However, they provide the most interpretive value of changing
social relations expressed through resource exploitation behaviors when considered
together with time-dependent technological data from Zatopec.
Research Domain 4: Organization of Hunter-Gatherer Technologies
Analyses of Zatopec’s lithic assemblage include an assessment of risk-management
behavior, as described in the Scope of Work (CAS 2007:26). However, an effort is
also made to understand the technological contributions made by different kinds of
socially conditioned individuals to the archaeological record (Brumfiel 1991; Ortner
1984). An assumption guiding this approach is that individuals grouped by age, sex,
role, expertise, etc., are likely to have been socialized in ways that influence or even
determine much of their behavior (Ingold 1990).
Technological organization at Zatopec is addressed from multiple perspectives. Some
perspectives can be characterized as “processual” in that they interpret assemblage
patterning in relation to larger decisions about settlement mobility, the perceived
riskiness of certain undertakings, and different strategies for resource exploitation.
Most of this focus involves describing and comparing time-specific assemblages against
each other in order to characterize circumstances to which hunters or toolmakers were
responding. Little interpretation is given to intra-assemblage variation that might
be related to individual-level performances. Other approaches consider how different
categories of individuals pursued certain tasks in common with or apart from other
similarly categorized individuals during the same and different time periods in ways

or abundance depends on how bison data were collected and placed into time periods.
Data from Zatopec are compiled and compared with these trends.

27

that introduce technological variation into site-level assemblages. These approaches
allow analysts to suggest changes in how labor roles were negotiated or defined over
time, including not only those roles related to age and skill or membership in a task
group, but also to biological sex and perhaps socially ascribed gender.
In our view, these approaches are complementary in that they provide different
explanations for assemblage variation. On one hand, processual analyses address
some external forces possibly resulting in technological change over time. On the other
hand, focusing on individual-level behavior describes how parts of a time-controlled
assemblage might vary from other parts of the overall tool kit for that same period. This
analysis can also be used to define historical contexts for large-scale changes in labor
roles between different kinds of individuals over time.
Lewis Binford (1965) perhaps anticipated a focus on intra-assemblage variation in
noting that culture is not uniform, but is participated in differentially by people acting
under different circumstances: “Within any one cultural system, the degree to which
the participants share the same ideational basis should vary with the degree of cultural
complexity of the system as a whole… a measure of cultural complexity is considered
to be the degree of internal structural differentiation and functional specificity of the
participating subsystems” (Binford 1965:205). One implication for hunter-gatherer
technological variation is that not everyone in past societies performed the same
kinds of tasks at the same level of efficiency regardless of distinctions by age, sex, or
experience. A corollary to this point is that researchers can learn something about how
these differences were conceived and expressed in ancient societies by studying the
remains of their material technologies (Dobres 1995; Dobres and Hoffman 1994).
Analysis of technological organization is by far the most labor-intensive research
domain undertaken for this project. In our view, here is where the greatest behavioral
variability that defined different task groups, cultural adaptations, and individual
identities is to be found. Individual behavior, and the resulting cultural variation, is
often incorrectly characterized as an objective unworthy of “scientific” archaeological
study (e.g., Owens 2008:80). However, it is fact that variation in technological
performance by individuals pursuing different objectives at different levels of aptitude
comprises much that is seen as patterning in archaeological assemblages. Moreover,
as discussed below, decisions made by individuals acting in response to shared or
unique objectives, circumstances, and aptitudes have significant effects on group-level
adaptations. Hence this focus is an essential complement to traditional, normative
approaches to understanding hunter-gatherer technologies.
Processual Approaches: Logistical vs. Residential Moves and Expedient vs.
Maintainable, Curated Tool Design
Archaeologists understand that hunter-gatherer technological practices are integral
parts of larger systems of settlement mobility, developed in response to environmental

28

factors and to requirements for exploiting certain resources, including the riskiness
of some undertakings compared with others. (Here, risk refers to costs, or what is lost
when failing to acquire or procure a desired prey or resource.) Some of these approaches
are described here as they guide the present analysis.
Lewis Binford (1980) describes two idealized hunter-gatherer mobility strategies
that have implications for technological variability. These strategies, termed forager
and collector, focus on the spatial distribution of subsistence and other necessary
resources and represent ends of a continuum. All hunter-gatherer adaptations represent
some combination of the two strategies, which are defined by the frequency of two
kinds of movements (or mobility), residential and logistical. Residential movements
involve the relocation of bands from one camp to another. Logistical movements start
from residential camps but are undertaken only by task-specialized groups in search
of specific resources not found nearby. Binford (1980:10; original emphasis) notes
that “logistically organized task groups are generally small and composed of skilled
and knowledgeable individuals. They are not groups out ‘searching’ for any resource
encountered; they are task groups seeking to procure specific resources in specific
contexts.” Because logistical task groups are made up of skilled and knowledgeable
individuals, identifying the logistical components of larger economic processes is
particularly important in the present analysis.
Forager adaptations involve mostly intact bands moving from one plentiful
resource area, or patch, to another. Because most resources used by these kinds of
foragers are found near campsites, this adaptation is fairly generalized, with minimal
differentiation between task groups and relatively homogenous tool kits. As resources
necessary for sustaining forager bands are depleted, the group moves to a nearby patch.
Such moves occur relatively frequently, since predominantly nearby resources are
exploited. Consequently, another aspect of forager patterns is that residential moves are
frequent compared to logistical movements. Collectors, by contrast, make relatively few
residential moves. However, special-purpose logistical moves involving specialized task
groups are common and allow the band to occupy a particular patch for longer periods of
time. These two organizational strategies, foraging and collecting, are characterized by
the relative importance of these two kinds of mobility: foragers occupy their residential
camps for shorter periods and move them often, but occupy rich patches that do not
require supplementation from resources that are only available far away. Collectors
occupy sites longer and make relatively fewer residential moves, but commonly send out
task groups on logistical forays.
In the present analysis, important parts of this model are (1) distinguishing between
the kinds of tools used for logistical activities and those used in and around residential
camps and (2) using these tool kits to model larger patterns of resource exploitation,
including defining task groups such as those potentially consisting of specialized
producers. Tools that are often carried from one camp to the next, made to be used

29

over extended (logistical) forays, or otherwise are intended for prolonged use are called
curated (or formal) tools. In contrast, those intended for relatively short use are called
expedient tools. During the past several decades much discussion has ensued about
distinctions between curated and expedient tools.
Binford (1973) was one of the first archaeologists to identify distinctions in how
tools were viewed. Using ethnographic data, he defined curated tools as those kept
for a long period of time and transported from site to site. These tools tend to have
greater time invested in their production and as a result carry greater stylistic variation
and meaning (style in this case refers to morphological variation specific to cultural
groups). Binford contrasted curated tools with expedient technologies, in which tools
are produced and discarded at the locus of use. Expedient tools typically lack diagnostic
markers and have a low investment of time. Binford (1977) later noted that expediency
and curation are not discrete categories but were tool-use strategies that fall along a
continuum; we define this continuum as one of potential versus realized utility (see
below). Binford (1977) suggested several ways to assess whether expediency or curation
was emphasized in a site’s assemblage. Markers of expedient strategies include an
inverse relationship between exhausted or fractured tools and complete tools, a direct
relationship between the number of tools and debitage from tool production, and a direct
relationship between the frequency of the tool and the frequency of its need. Curated
technologies will have a random relationship between fractured and complete tools, a
random relationship between tool frequency and debitage, and an inverse relationship
in the frequency of the tool versus its importance.
Binford (1979, 1980) linked these two technological approaches to settlement
mobility related to subsistence strategies, arguing that hunter-gatherers obtained
food either by foraging or collecting. Foragers exhibit high residential mobility, often
traveling among areas that are high in aggregate resources. The duration of residence
and distance to the next site are highly variable, however, and many foragers return
to the same site year after year, increasing its archaeological visibility. Technology
therefore varies from site to site based upon the most common resource being exploited,
although foragers tend to favor an expedient tool technology.
On the other end of the continuum, collectors are organized around specialized
task groups following logistical procurement strategies. Collector strategies are
usually adopted when residential moves will not solve a resource problem. Seasonal
variability and uneven availability of key resources increase the importance of logistical
procurement strategies. Because logistical mobility increases movements away from
residential camps in order to increase the likelihood of resource encounters, there is a
greater need for collectors to carry certain raw materials compared to foragers. For this
reason, tools need to be designed for portability and reliability, and strategies need to be
implemented to help overcome unpredictable resource availability. According to Binford,
collectors favor curated tool technologies that are maintained over long periods.

30

Douglas Bamforth (1986), however, warns against using curation to identify
subsistence strategies since there can be several reasons for curated technologies. He
defines various kinds of curation, including tools that are 1) manufactured in advance,
2) used over time, 3) transported from place to place, or 4) recycled to serve a new
function. Bamforth builds on how archeologists understand curated technologies by
broadening the definition of curation to include different situations in which tools are
used but that still involve greater planning and investment in tool manufacture than
expediency.
Peter Bleed (1986) adds to the discussion of technological organization by
categorizing tool systems according to “engineering design goals” in ways that expand
on the curated-versus-expedient dichotomy. Tool systems, according to Bleed, are
designed to be reliable or maintainable. Reliable designs are intended to function
despite setbacks, and are selected when the cost of failure is high. Hunter-gatherers
favor reliable designs in situations where prey or resource encounters are unpredictable,
as tool failure in these moments carry greater costs since future encounters cannot
be predicted or even counted on. An example of a reliable design would be affixing a
well-fashioned, labor-intensive spear tip, rather than a sharp flake that performs less
well, to a shaft to hunt big game. On the other hand, maintainable tool systems can be
repaired or quickly adapted as new circumstances arise; these systems are preferred
when the need for them is constant. Bleed’s reliable–maintainable continuum fits well
with Binford’s (1980) forager–collector sequence, with reliable tools being favored by
logistical collectors and maintainable tools preferred by foragers. Though Bleed does not
explicitly address expediency, he implicitly links it to maintainability in discussing the
Yanomamö tool kit. He notes that bows can be used as spears: “…if a spear is needed
to dispatch an animal, it is improvised on the spot and discarded after use” (1986:742).
This description of a spear clearly falls under the various definitions offered for
expedient tools (Bamforth 1986; Binford 1979).
Discussions of technological organization so far raise two important points. First,
terms such as curated, expedient, reliable, and maintainable do not describe types of
artifacts, but rather the goals or strategies of toolmakers to meet anticipated needs
(Odell 2001). Second, an unintended consequence has been that more attention is
given to reliable or curated tool forms than to expedient forms. Some clarity about
these issues is provided by Bousman (1993, 2005), who reiterates that maintainability
and reliability are design goals rather than typological categories. Also, he adds
expediency and efficiency to reliability and maintainability as design goals (efficiency
is a component of expediency and Bousman does not develop it further). Following
Bleed, Bousman argues that tool systems share a variety of design goals; for example,
reliability and maintainability are not exclusive, but represent a continuum of design
choices. Relationships between expediency, reliability, and maintainability are graphed
as a triangular chart (Figure 1-5).

31

Like Bleed, Bousman argues that overlaying maintainable-reliable design goals onto
the forager–collector continuum is warranted since it describes different subsistence
strategies leading to different tool use patterns. Bousman concludes that foragers
typically exhaust their maintainable tools before discard, but that collectors discard
their reliable tools prematurely to avoid failure during use. At some point, it is easier for
foragers to replace maintainable tools, which are less labor intensive, than to maximize
utility from them through resharpening and recycling. For collectors, replacing
reliable tools is a risk aversion strategy (although Bousman [2005] correctly notes
that associating expediency with foragers and formal tools with collectors is an oversimplification).
Although the discussion of design goals significantly improves Binford’s concept
of curated technologies by recognizing a continuum between goals, many examples
still result in artifact categories, with analysts frequently labeling tools as “expedient”
or “reliable.” For example, Bleed (1986) concludes foragers use maintainable tools,
and Sassaman (1992) argues women used expedient tools (also Gero 1991). Further
complicating the issue is Bousman’s (2005) observation that, although each design
category represents a mode with continuous variables, the precise distribution of these
goals is unknown for any particular artifact. This means that the three hypothetical
artifacts shown in Figure 1-5 cannot be quantified with respect to the degree to which
maintainability, reliability, or expediency influence the design of that tool. Although
analysts realize that more than one design goal informed the shape of any particular
tool, the relationship of these objectives has not yet been assessed.
Measuring Expediency over Curation as the Critical Variable
Informed by the studies summarized above, the present analysis perceives that the
critical variable for measurement is the actual or realized versus potential utility of a

Figure 1-5. Hypothetical relationship between different design goals for tools. The black
dot represents an artifact that shares equally in the three design goals. The white dot
shows an artifact that shares maintainability and reliability equally but does not have
expediency as a goal. The gray dot represents a third artifact sharing unevenly in all
three design goals (after Bousman 2005:196).

32

tool. Expedient tools are not intended to be used for extended periods, whereas both
reliable and maintainable (i.e. curated) tools are, either through elaborate design (for
reliable tools) or easily repaired or replaced attributes (for maintainable tools). The
current analysis therefore relies heavily on (relative) expediency rather than reliability
or maintainability to understand technological decisions about how to manufacture,
maintain, and discard tools. As noted, expediency is marked by low investment in
tool production, lack of formal or repeated morphology, and relatively short duration
of use. In terms of what expediency tells researchers about the past, expedient tools
can be a rapid response to an unexpected need, or a planned response using minimal
labor investment (Bousman 1993:69). (Presumably unanticipated needs were few at
residential campsites like Zatopec that have been recurrently occupied for millennia.)
Generally, expedient tools reflect a low-risk work environment in which tool failure
does not jeopardize procuring or processing resources. They can also indicate a timestressed work environment in which elaborate tool designs are not feasible. Finally,
expediency, defined by simple morphologies and little modification or elaboration, can
indicate limitations of technological knowledge (see below). Expediency potentially
conveys a lot of important information about the internal (within-group) decisions and
actions of toolmakers and users, and only moderate information about larger, external
factors. Expedient tools are curated only short distances, at least in areas where
materials needed to make or replace them are plentiful. For this reason, in such areas
they are poorly suited for reconstructing site occupation histories or mobility patterns.
In general, expedient tools lack the kinds of stylistic information conveyed by formal
designs (e.g., distinctive projectile point types; see Chapter 7) that archaeologists often
use to reconstruct regional patterns.
On the other end of the continuum in terms of greater potential use are curated
tools, or those that are preserved over time and space. Curated tools include artifacts
that were produced in one location and then transported elsewhere as one way to extend
their use, as well as tools that are exhaustively resharpened and recycled. Because
reliability and maintainability, as design goals, both serve to extend the potential use
of a tool, they are considered together as having greater potential utility than expedient
tools (see Shott 1996 for parallel discussion of curation).
To address problems of categorization and quantification described above, a
numeric scale is used to indicate the continuum between maintainability/reliability and
expediency (see Chapter 11). This scale is designed to accommodate several factors.
First, any particular tool form (such as utilized flakes) can have varying design goals
within its category, and also show design changes from one time period to the next
(Bleed 1986; Bousman 1993). This scale, described below, recognizes changes in design
and patterns of use within a tool category, as well as within a category but over time
as external and internal conditions change. Second, the scale reflects the inverse
relationship described by Binford (1977) between expediency and time investment in

33

tool production, with more elaborate tools starting higher on the scale (less expedient)
than simple ones. Third, degree of use is a strong indicator of maintainability, since
resharpened tools are considered more curated and less expedient (Bamforth 1986).
Measurements taken for each tool type are designed to quantify as nearly as possible
how intensively tools are used, and these data produce a score that allows analysts to
locate the tool in question on the scale. Finally, tool types are intuitively grouped along
a continuum of intensity of preparation for use. Flake tools are more expedient than
unifaces, and bifaces are more maintainable/reliable than both unifaces and flake tools.
Some overlap between these categories is possible.
Based on these factors, a 100-point scale was developed to measure the expediency
of artifacts, with lower point values indicating expediency and higher values reflecting
greater maintainability or reliability (Figure 1-6). The range of the scale was arbitrarily
selected, but it can easily accommodate future analyses without substantial revision.
The three tool types used in this analysis (flake tools, unifaces, and bifaces) are assigned
to point ranges within the scale: flake tools are from 0–30 points, unifaces from 30–70
points, and bifaces from 60–100 points. Overlap between unifaces and bifaces recognizes
differences in potential utility between well-made unifaces and crude bifaces. Flake
tools that are extensively made or used are classed as unifaces, so that no overlap
occurs between these categories. Based primarily on the amount of evident use plus
modification in anticipation of utility (and also unrealized potential for use in the case
of some tools), this scale is referred to as the Expediency:Maintainability/Reliability
scale or E:M/R. In our view, the strength of this scale lies not only in enabling analysts
to show relationships between expediency and maintainability in tool design, but also
in allowing them to recognize, quantify, and discuss these changes over time by using
empirical trends that can be reproduced or independently evaluated.
A replicable scoring system for each tool type is based on measurements and
observed features. Although this system uses similar criteria for each artifact category,
different attributes are measured for each tool form. Placement of these three categories
on the continuum reflects the intuitive recognition that each represents different
amounts of labor investment and design intended, in part, to allow for greater utility.
The rating system for each tool type is described below. Analytic results are presented

Figure 1-6. Expediency:Maintainabililty/Reliability (E:M/R) Scale. This graphic shows
the point scale using expediency and maintainability/reliability as design goals rather
than categories. This scale produces a quantifiable result of the expediency of each
artifact without pigeonholing artifacts into a specific category. Dashed line represents an
undefined transition area between expediency and maintainability/reliability.

34

and discussed in Chapters 7 and 11. One beneficial result of the scoring used for this
analysis is that expediency is calculated as a value in relation to other artifacts in the
same assemblage rather than assigned as an absolute value, thereby reflecting the
kinds of choices made by discrete groups of prehistoric toolmakers and users.
Once E:M/R values are calculated for all artifacts as described below, they are
weighted based on their assigned tool category. As discussed, flake tools are considered
far more expedient than unifaces and bifaces, and all unifaces are more expedient than
most bifaces. To appropriately situate each tool on the E:M/R scale, 30 points were
added to each uniface score, and 60 points were added to each biface score. In order to
assess differences in how certain tools were designed and used by time period, and also
to recognize technological changes over time, mean E:M/R values were calculated for
each tool type by time period. This score allows analysts to note changes in expediency
in different parts of tool kits by time. Such results can indicate periods when logistical
forays were relatively more important than others or periods during which expediency
was favored. Combined with overall increases or decreases in certain tool categories,
such as utilized flakes, analysts can identify periods during which task groups
theoretically associated with different kinds of tools made significant changes to the way
they designed and used their tools. In order to identify overall increases or decreases in
expediency, an E:M/R ratio was derived for each time period by dividing the total points
in each cultural era by the total possible points. Changes in overall E:M/R are assessed
statistically to identify significant shifts in technological organization by time.
Flake Tools
Flake tools have a short production time and lack a consistent morphology; size and
flake type vary widely within each time period. As a result, expediency ia assessed by
visible macroscopic wear in relation to the amount of edge that has potential for use.
Following the method developed by Prilliman and Bousman (1998), circumference,
total edge modification (TEM), and potential edge modification (PEM) are measured
(see Chapter 7). TEM was then divided by PEM to obtain a TEM:PEM ratio. To ensure
that the size of the tool was also considered, a second ratio, Total Edge Modification to
Circumference (TEM:Circ) was also used. Each ratio was then sorted into six categories,
five of which were based upon an even division of the point range allotted to flake tools
on the E:M/R scale (0–30). Recorded TEM:PEM values ranged from 8.11% to100%, and
TEM:Circ values ranged from 1.89% to100%. Based on these results, TEM:PEM ratios
and TEM:Circ values were initially placed on different parts of the E:M/R scale (Table
1-1). The score in each category was then multiplied by 3 points and summed, thereby
creating a possible range of 0–30 expediency points that allowed a particular artifact to
be located along the E:M/R scale based on the degree to which it (1) was designed for use
and (2) showed use.

Formal Unifaces
Formal unifaces were also scored using the TEM:PEM ratio and the TEM:Circ. Since
the range for these two ratios was smaller than that of flake tools, these tools were
initially scored from 0–4 on the E:M/R scale (Table 1-2; as with flake tools, this initial
scoring is modified by other factors). For unifaces, the TEM:PEM ratio was judged more
indicative of curation than TEM:Circ, so the TEM:PEM score was multiplied by 4, and
the TEM:Circ was multiplied by 3, resulting in a possible total of 28 points for any
single uniface. Because a range of 40 points (30–70) was give to this tool category on
the E:M/R scale, the remaining 12 points were assigned based on the amount of cortex
remaining on their dorsal surfaces, and the regularity of the artifact’s form. Unifaces
with little or no cortex are considered more labor intensive to manufacture, and
therefore less expedient. Total (100%) dorsal cortex received 0 points, 50% – 99%
cortex received 1 point, 1% – 49% cortex received 2 points, and 0% cortex received 3
points. Unifaces with an irregular form or those which were completely amorphous were
given 0 points. Unifaces with a regular, definable form were given 3 points, and those
falling into a formal, existing typological category (e.g., Clear Fork tools) were given 9
points.

Bifaces
Biface preforms and tools were analyzed in a different manner than flake tools and
unifaces. The degree to which bifaces had been used was still the primary factor for
determining the extent of an artifact’s potential utility; however, because many of these
artifacts were preforms, or early-stage reductions for other often-used, ultimate forms,
that were often used, TEM:PEM and TEM:Circ ratios were not used. Rather, the outline
of each artifact was divided into four sections labeled Edge 1, Edge 2, End 1, and End
2. Both faces of each section were assessed for visible (macroscopic) wear and attrition.
Wear was defined as any portion of the edge that had been crushed, or where small
flakes were present extending from 1 mm to 3 mm onto the face. When use was present,
its intensity was subjectively evaluated. (To maintain consistency for this measurement,
all observations were made by the same analyst.) Each utilized section (edges and ends)
was categorized as light, moderate, heavy, or fractured with use based on the extent of
the observed wear. Unmodified edges received no score, modified without use-wear was
given a score of 1, light use a score of 2, moderate a score of 4, and heavy a score of 7. If
an edge or end was fractured from use, then that edge was also scored as “heavy.” The
score for both edges and both ends was then summed for a total possible score of 28.
Another point was added to the sum if an edge or end was fractured from use. Beveling
was given 5 points since it is a clear indicator of resharpening. Other distinctive forms
of edge-modification such as notching or serration were given 2 points. Finally, the
amount of cortex was scored based on observed measurements: >50% cortex = 0 points,
1% – 49% cortex = 2 points, and 0% cortex = 4 points.
Discussion of Expediency:Maintainability/Reliability Measures
The foregoing commentary, complex though it may be, is but one approach to
understanding hunter-gatherer technological organization at Zatopec. In our view,
one reason for this complexity is that archaeologists have dealt inconsistently with the
phenomena of tool expediency and tool curation (see Rahemtulla 2006; Shott 1996).
Although recognition of technological trends over time is one ultimate objective of
this research, differences between tool categories for the same time period are also
significant; these are presented in Chapter 7. Larger diachronic trends are explored
in Chapter 11. Importantly, the results of our expediency assessments should be
considered along with relative changes in the frequencies of different tool types by
time. For example, it is essential to remember that (expedient) flake tools and (curated)
bifaces increase in Toyah times and also to consider that all tools are also used much
more intensively at this time (Chapter 7 and 11). Based on these findings, we cannot
conclude from the greater frequency of informally fashioned but also more heavily
used (less expedient) tools in Toyah times that Zatopec residents were either more
residentially mobile or had adopted a logistical adaptation. Our results are more
complex, and require exploring additional factors to explain how tools associated with

37

logistical forays can increase in number and use intensity at the same time that tools
theoretically associated with expedient tasks also increase in number and use intensity.
Informed by a long history of analysis on hunter-gather technological decisions, this
analysis uses a quantifiable scale of expediency-to-maintainability/reliability to analyze
the tools found at Zatopec. We consider whether design goals within a category of
artifacts (such as flake tools, formal unifaces, or bifaces) varied from one cultural era to
another, and also whether differences can be seen in how different tools were designed
and used within a particular period. By developing an innovative system to evaluate
these design goals, a more specific understanding of how toolmakers and users designed
their tool kits is presented. This model, when evaluated with other lines of evidence,
such as different technological behaviors that may be associated with different task
groups (see below), allows researchers to suggest more realistic explanations for the
significant changes observed in hunter-gatherer technological organization.
Sources of Intra-Assemblage Technological Variation
One goal of this analysis is to examine technological strategies involving specialized
production or patterns of labor allocation by age, skill, or sex over time. In contrast
to the focus on expediency versus potential tool utility described above, in this case
attention is given to how individuals participated in important toolmaking or foodgetting activities differently according to their experiences, priorities, and aptitudes.
Within the potential spectra of different kinds of socially conditioned prehistoric people,
the current analysis also focuses on divisions of labor according to roles related to age
and sex, enculturation processes as neophytes acquire craft skills, and the possible
emergence of specialized production during particular intervals of the site’s history. In
this aspect of the present analysis, “technology” describes how different kinds of people
mediated their physical and social surroundings through tool production and use.
Important to this perspective is that the views and concerns of all of the participants in
a coherent social group are somehow represented in the technological system. Following
Binford (1965) and others, we observe that not all prehistoric occupants of Zatopec or
its surrounding region were identical in nature, and suggest that these differences
can be ascertained to some degree through appropriate technological analyses. Dobres
and Hoffman (1994:215–216) summarize a social understanding of technology, which
for them “equally concerns social interaction (e.g., divisions of labor), belief systems
(e.g., origin myths and their relationship to the cultural and physical landscape), and
practical knowledge of techniques and the environment.” The present analysis, which
relies almost exclusively on Zatopec’s stone tool record, focuses on what these authors
call social interactions and practical knowledge.
Divisions of Labor
Divisions of labor based on age and sex have long been noted in historic and
contemporary hunter-gatherer societies (Brown 1970; Burton et al. 1977; Dahlberg

38

1981; Frink and Weedman 2005; Hayden 1981; Hill et al. 1987; Hurtado et al. 1985;
Lee and DeVore 1968; Murdock 1937, 1949; and others). In looking at different Native
American cooking techniques for instance, Ellis (1997) reviewed more than 100
ethnographic and ethnohistoric sources from North America to create an analogous
framework for understanding prehistoric burned rock middens in Texas. Each of the
14 different cooking techniques described involved some division of labor by age or sex
(Ellis 1997: Table 3). Archaeologists presume that labor was similarly organized in
prehistoric societies (e.g., Meltzer 2004; Sassaman 1992; Waguespack 2005:668), and a
few approaches are used to understand different kinds of social actors based on patterns
in the material record.
One approach to ascribing tasks by sex is task differentiation, involving use of
ethnographic or historic examples to understand the past by way of analogy. In her
study of the Plains Hidatsa, Janet Spector (1998) notes that women collected and
processed all food and natural resources and constructed and maintained domiciles.
Men were responsible for killing bison during the summer and for conducting rituals
that accompanied these hunts. Hidatsa women worked within a one-mile radius of
camp, often carrying out their tasks within the lodge or immediately nearby. Men
often conducted their work at much greater distances. This study can provide a basis
for spatial frameworks that can in turn be used to formulate hypotheses regarding
where evidence of certain activity areas may be found. Such studies can also be used
to infer which tools were used in those tasks (e.g., Costin 1996), thereby building a
model for men’s or women’s work spaces and tool kits that can be compared with the
archaeological record.
Another common approach involves analyzing burials, burial contexts, and grave
goods. Bioarchaeological analyses of sexed individuals have strong potential to reveal
evidence of wear or repetitive motions that accrues through sexually ascribed tasks.
Larsen (1997:257, cited in Gilchrist 1999:43), for example, observed wear patterns
on teeth, a possible indication that women in some societies chewed plant fibers for
basket-making or hides for clothing or structures. Ogilvie (2005) analyzed 199 femora
from 139 individuals representing Late Archaic foragers in Texas, Late Archaic-toEarly Agricultural part-time agriculturalists in Arizona, and agriculturalists from
Pottery Mound, New Mexico. Considering the effects of the transition from foraging
to established agricultural practices on skeletal morphologies, she noted that as
agriculture became important men continued to be highly mobile while women’s
locomotion steadily decreased. Given sufficient population sizes, studies such as these
can help archaeologists understand aspects of labor divisions that can illuminate
patterns in the material record.
Problems exist, however, with both approaches to recognizing prehistoric gendered
labor divisions. Bioarchaeological analyses require large comparative samples before
representative trends in burial data can be recognized, analyzed, and understood.

39

Isolated or small burial clusters do not provide irrefutable evidence for how particular
tasks were carried out across societies by sex or age. Additionally, considerable overlap
in grave goods associated with both male and female burials has been noted in some
instances (e.g., Knutsson 1999, cited in Sternke n.d.: 6), suggesting that men and
women performed many of the same tasks in some ancient societies (see below). For
example, analysis of approximately 227 burials at the Ernest Witte and Leonard K
cemeteries, 41AU36 and 41AU37, found no consistent patterning in the associations
of certain artifact types with either age or sex categories (Hall 1981:88). The only
exception was that bone artifacts (awls, needles, points, etc.) were never found with
children.
Even in cases where certain kinds of tools are strongly correlated with a particular
sex, care is required before a given task can likewise be ascribed to that sex. For
example, analyses of mortuary assemblages in Texas suggest that most artifacts
identified as knapping implements or tool kits are associated with male burials (Dockall
and Dockall 1999: Table 4). However, these data do not indicate that only males
performed stoneworking activities. To the contrary, to the extent that grave goods alone
indicate tasks people carried out, the manufacture and use of stone tools in general does
not appear to have been gender exclusive. To conclude that knapping paraphernalia
in mortuary contexts indicates the predominant or even exclusive engagement in
stoneworking by sex should also involve bioarchaeological analyses for repetitive
stresses or locomotor patterns associated with that activity. Consideration should also
be given to different kinds of stoneworking. For example, producing projectile points
for hunting big game can involve altogether different strategies and techniques than
the production of informal tools, scrapers, gouges, drills, and other items for domestic
activities, maintenance, or processing (see Chapter 7). In the absence of data to the
contrary, it is reasonable to expect that different kinds of tools may have been produced
by members of prehistoric societies who used those tools.
Lacking robust samples of grave goods exclusively associated with sexed individuals
bearing corroborating skeletal pathologies indicating certain repetitive motions,
perhaps the best approach to understanding sexual divisions of labor involves
constructing analogous frameworks for posing hypotheses that can be tested against
archaeological data. To this end, Ember and Ember (1995) argue that global or crosscultural ethnographic analogy is more appropriate than particularistic, site/regionspecific comparisons when searching for positively correlated variables to be used for
archaeological reconstruction.
A number of ethnographies were conducted from the late nineteenth century to the
early half of the twentieth century, many of which have been used in continental or
world-wide syntheses of technological, social, demographic, health, and other attributes
of extant hunter-gatherer societies. For example, Driver and Massey (1957) compiled
information about subsistence, material culture, economics, and social organization

40

from 238 societies from North, Central, and South America. Another synthesis meeting
Ember and Ember’s (1995) criteria for cross-cultural sampling is by Murdock and
Provost (1973), who compiled data on the division of labor by sex from 185 of the 186
world-wide societies sampled by Murdock and White (1969). The study by Murdock
and Provost (1973: Table 1) indicates the kinds of patterning that has been associated
with males and females in historic and contemporary societies. To the extent that this
sample accurately indicates valid, positive correlations between certain tasks and by
whom they were conducted, it can be used to understand the record at Zatopec.
In examining divisions of labor by sex, Murdock and Provost (1973) identified fifty
important technological activities and examined their ethnographic database for how
these tasks were conducted. For tasks that were present, each was scored 1 in cases
where they were an exclusively male undertaking, 0.8 when they were predominantly
male, 0.5 when there was approximately equal participation by males and females, 0.2
when the task was predominantly carried out by females, and 0 when it was associated
exclusively with females. The sum of all responses for a task was then divided by the
total number of responses for that task to calculate an index of masculine participation.
An index of “100” indicates exclusive male participation, and lower indices reflect
increasing female participation in the task.
In spite of problems of male over-representation and of defining what constitutes
an “important technological task,” this study provides a useful indication of crosscultural associations between some activities and sex. Part of the bias against female
involvement can be overcome by subtracting the index value (which scores male
participation) from 100; the result is the index score for female participation in
that same task (Table 1-3). When graphed, these trends reflect some cross-cultural
regularities that archaeologists can use to identify tasks that may have been exclusively
gendered, primarily gendered, or relatively non-gendered in the past (Figure 1-7).

One obvious concern for using cross-culturally derived data in this manner is in
comparing residentially mobile hunter-gatherers with groups that occupied vastly
different environments, practiced agriculture, were sedentary, or lived in politically
complex, hierarchically structured societies. These groups are fundamentally different
in so many ways that using their cultural patterns to formulate hypotheses for
understanding residentially mobile, largely egalitarian prehistoric hunter-gatherers
can be seriously misleading. Furthermore, many of the activities listed in Table 1-3
(such as hunting aquatic fauna, ore-smelting, metal-working, tending large animals,
soil preparation, loom weaving, dairy production, and spinning) were not relevant to
Archaic-period hunter-gatherers in Central Texas. Some tasks, such as pottery making,
increased in importance in the Late Prehistoric periods (see Chapter 2 for regional
culture history). Still, many of the tasks listed in Table 1-3 and illustrated in Figure 1-7
were important in Central Texas and warrant consideration.
Contextualizing further the organization of these tasks by sex is possible by
considering the degree to which the activities illustrated in Figure 1-7 are carried
out among 33 societies specifically from North America. These societies, presumed
to have more in common with the prehistoric groups who occupied Zatopec than
the 152 societies from other parts of the world, include the Ingalik, Aleut, Copper
Eskimo, Montagnais, Micmac, Saulteaux, Slave, Kaska, Eyak, Haida, Bellacoola,
Twana, Yurok, Pomo, Yokuts, Paiute, Klamath, Kutenai, Gros Ventre, Hidatsa,
Pawnee, Omaha, Huron, Creek, Natchez, Comanche, Chiricahua, Zuni, Havasupai,

43

Papago, Huichol, Aztec, and Popluca (Murdock and White 1969: Table 1). Some of
these societies (e.g., Aztec) had little in common with the prehistoric hunter-gatherers
of south Central Texas. Nevertheless, this list helps eliminate many social groups
that are or were dissimilar to any society that ever occupied the current project area.
Murdock and Provost (1973: Tables 2, 3, 4, 5) break down the tasks from each global
region according to the degree to which they were carried out predominantly by one
sex or the other. Of these, evidence for nine tasks in particular is present at Zatopec
for at least one time period. These include hunting large land fauna, trapping small
land fauna, stoneworking (which includes manufacture of stone tools; Murdock and
Provost 1973:205), butchering, preparation of skins, gathering small land fauna, pottery
making, gathering wild vegetal foods, and cooking (Table 1-4).

On the basis of cross-cultural comparisons alone, activities listed on either end of
the continuum from men’s to women’s work in Figure 1-7 can suggest which tasks may
have been carried out exclusively or nearly exclusively by a single sex in the past. When
the organization of these tasks is considered for only the 33 North American societies
listed above, some changes occur. The frequency of female participation in hunting
large land fauna, trapping small fauna, stoneworking, trapping or gathering of small
land fauna, and cooking increases slightly. Female participation increases moderately
(3.0–13.3 index points) in butchering, trapping small land fauna, pottery making, and
gathering wild vegetal foods. Female participation in the preparation of skins increased
substantially, from a global index of 45.4 to a North American index of 69.3.
These comparisons and discussions show that, according to cross-cultural sampling
at both global and continental scales, some tasks are carried out predominantly but not
exclusively by one sex or the other. Both sexes contributed evenly to other tasks, such as

44

gathering small land fauna. How different tasks were conducted by sex has important
implications for technological organization at Zatopec over time. These results are used
to offer the following important proposition regarding labor divisions by sex:
Some tasks were carried out by males and females in approximately the
same proportion and manner during the prehistoric occupation of Zatopec
as indicated by the cross-cultural ethnographic data.
Archaeological Evidence for Gendered Divisions of Labor at Zatopec
Although this proposition cannot realistically be nullified, certain testable
implications, if they can be demonstrated at Zatopec, support the proposition’s validity.
In future research, these implications can be used to pose improved testable hypotheses
concerning labor divisions by sex. These implications involve associating certain
tools with sexed individuals; recognizing patterns in tool use; recording activity areas
reflecting gendered use of space; and detecting manufacturing patterns reflecting
different approaches to tool design, maintenance, and discard. These implications are as
follows.
Implication 1. Tools used for tasks associated primarily with a particular
sex in the cross-cultural ethnographic sample will also be primarily
associated with that sex in certain archaeological contexts.
This implication has been addressed in the discussion about analysis of mortuary
remains. Given the high participation index by sex for certain tasks, such as
stoneworking (mostly men) or cooking (mostly women), it is reasonable to assume that
aspects of the tool kits and technologies related to each task had certain components
more familiar to and closely associated with people carrying out those tasks than to
other people. For example, in their review of flintknapping tool kits found in mortuary
assemblages in Texas, Dockall and Dockall (1999: Table 4) note that items such as
antler billets, flakers, and punches; hammerstones; whetstones and abraders; and
ocher (Dockall and Dockall 1999: Table 2) are found with males in 85.7% (12 of 14)
of the sexed burials in their sample. One conclusion that can be reached from these
associations is that they reflect the degree to which flintknapping work involving billets
and related items was conducted by males and females in the region and time periods
represented by these burials. This conclusion should be verified by a larger sample, but
it closely mirrors trends noted by Seeman (1985) from mid-continental North America,
in which similar knapping tool kits are associated with males in 86.6% (26 of 30) of
positively sexed burials found with such assemblages.
To the degree that these two studies accurately characterize larger social patterns,
it can be proposed that approximately 13–15% of women in some prehistoric bands
engaged in stoneworking that involved billets and related paraphernalia. This number

46

compares favorably with the participation index of 7.1 for female participation in
generalized stoneworking calculated by Murdock and Provost (1973) from North
American societies, and can be used to support the assertion that most prehistoric
billet flaking was a male pursuit. Although associations such as these are useful for
understanding relationships between male and female participation in knapping in a
general way, no comparable burial data are available from Zatopec that can be used to
draw conclusions about how billet flaking was organized at the site. Nevertheless, based
on these data, CAS proposes that billet flaking at Zatopec was primarily, though not
exclusively, a male pursuit (see below, also Chapters 11 and 12).
Implication 2. Tools used for predominantly-gendered activities will be
characterized by mutually exclusive patterns of wear or use.
Several tasks conducted at Zatopec, such as preparation of skins, butchering, and
gathering small land fauna, are hypothesized to have been carried out by both sexes
based on the Murdock and Provost (1973) study (see Table 1-4). The inclusive nature
of these activities makes it difficult to recognize possible “men’s tools” from possible
“women’s tools.” Indeed, these labels are probably not applicable to the majority of
artifacts recovered from residential sites like Zatopec. Other tasks, however, are more
exclusively linked with a particular sex, such as hunting large land fauna (primarily
male) or gathering wild vegetal foods or cooking (primarily female).
It is expected that tools used for strongly-gendered activities will reflect
characteristic wear patterns. Additionally, tools used in these activities are far less
likely to have been used by the opposite sex. Demonstrating the validity of Implication
2 involves identifying certain artifacts that show exclusive evidence of use for tasks
identified as a primarily-gendered activity. Possible examples include cooking facilities
and tools used to gather or collect vegetal foods from near the camp (female), and
points used for hunting large mammals (male); other possibilities might also exist. In
the present analysis, only macroscopic evidence for impact was recorded for projectile
points. However, future analyses can better address this question by applying
systematic microscopic use-wear analyses on contextually-controlled assemblages.
Implication 3. Tools potentially associated with strongly-gendered tasks
will demonstrate spatial patterning according to how and by whom they
were used.
Four factors that potentially attenuate the results of this kind of spatial analysis
warrant discussion. First, the location where artifacts are recovered indicates where
they were discarded, and not necessarily where they were used (Schiffer 1972).
Therefore, the focus of study should rely primarily on undisturbed contexts that
potentially reflect intact activity areas. At Zatopec, these are relatively few as a result of
bioturbation and the processes of sedimentation across the site (see Chapter 4). Second,

47

gender-exclusive tasks may not always have been carried out in ways that reflect the
exclusive use of space by sex-based task groups (e.g., Boderhorn 1993; cited in Gilchrist
1999:34). Tools from areas containing remains of two or more activities conducted sideby-side may be inseparable, making it impossible to ascertain which tool forms were
used for which activities. Even though these kinds of patterns, if present, cannot be
used to identify gender-exclusive tasks, they can speak to non-gendered spaces. Third,
site over-printing, in which task-specific activity areas “move” across the site over the
course of sequential occupations, can lead to mixing of task-specific assemblages with
tools used for other activities as well. Fourth, some tools may have been used away from
the site and then returned for repair or discard. Projectile points used for the logistical
hunting of migratory or herd animals that often avoid areas inhabited by humans are
one example.
In response to the first three factors, careful contextual analyses are required to
separate primary, undisturbed contexts from potentially mixed ones. Still, it is likely
that many tasks will remain incompletely understood with respect to how they were
organized by sex. Addressing the final consideration is relatively straightforward.
Unless they show evidence for use as knives or cutting implements with possible utility
in several settings and for a range of purposes, it is assumed that projectile points
showing heavy impact damage were used away from residential sites like Zatopec,
and that the people who used them were involved in short- or long-term logistical
excursions. Likewise, informal tools reflecting expediency as a design goal are assumed
to have been used in and around the camp context by people who commonly engaged in
those kinds of tasks.
Implication 4. Many of the tools associated with gender-specific tasks were
made by the people who carried out those tasks, and can be characterized
by distinctive manufacturing techniques and approaches.
According to Murdock and Provost (1973:205), stoneworking includes the
“manufacture of stone artifacts.” Based upon their coded data, these authors calculate
a male participation index of 95.9 (4.1 female participation index) for 185 societies
world-wide for stoneworking as they broadly define it. This figure declines slightly to
92.9 (7.1 female participation index) for 33 North American societies (see Table 1-4).
Problematically, however, this task was coded for fewer than half (73 of 185) of the
societies in their sample (see Table 1-3), and is not included in their summary of coded
data from selected societies (Murdock and Provost 1973: Table 8). This omission makes
it impossible for researchers to return to the original sources to verify whether this
activity was mentioned, in what context it was conducted, and by whom and in what
settings it was carried out without combing through more than 1,000 bibliographic
citations. Additionally, no explanation is given of exactly what kinds of stoneworking
are included in this task. For example, the manufacture of projectile points often relies

48

heavily on bifacial reduction techniques and soft hammer percussion for carefully
removing controlled thinning flakes in order to achieve broad, thin preforms that can be
finished into points. In contrast, expedient flakes used as ad hoc tools can be removed
from smashed pebbles and nodules, require little labor investment and (in some cases)
technological knowledge to prepare, and are often discarded upon use.
Considerations involving labor divisions by sex are certain to have factored into
the production of different kinds of tools. These include who used different tools, what
they were used for, how their production was scheduled into other tasks, how they
were maintained, what costs arose if they failed at critical moments, and how easily
they could be replaced if lost or broken. Some of these considerations may have been
similar for tasks conducted more or less evenly by males and females and tools used for
those tasks. However, it is unlikely that individuals participating in strongly-gendered
activities held identical views of how a tool used for any given task should look, feel,
or function. For example, Weedman (2010) provides a detailed description about how
contemporary Konso women in southern Ethiopia make hide scrapers using distinct
technological approaches, and even prefer stone to metal or glass because it is more
suitable for their tasks. Moreover, it seems unlikely that some people sat idle, with their
tasks going unattended until a needed tool could be made by someone else. Based on the
7.1 female participation index for stoneworking in North American societies, detailed
descriptions of tool use and manufacture by women in other ethnographic accounts
(e.g., Jarvenpa and Brumbach 1995; Kehoe 2005; Weedman 2005, 2010), and the
archaeological associations of knapping kits with female burials, it is a near-certainty
that at least some females made some stone tools. Based on previous discussions,
however, the challenge lies not in confirming this fact, but in distinguishing between
stone tools made and used by males from those made and used by females.
One approach to discerning female participation in stone tool production, not just
use, involves assigning the artifacts used for different tasks to the sexed individuals
who performed those tasks, such as ascribing big game hunting weapons to males and
tools associated with domestic or general maintenance activities to females. Hayden
(1992:35–36), for example, notes that “high investment tools” related to hunting
were not likely to be shared with women, who might ruin them (cited in Jarvenpa
and Brumbach 1995:47). In Joan Gero’s (1991) article “Genderlithics,” she attributes
production of informal and ad hoc tools to women, and notes that these often dominate
archaeological assemblages though they receive far less attention from archaeologists
than bifaces and biface-related systems of production (see discussion of expediency,
above). According to such studies (Sassaman 1992), stone tools made by females are
those that are informally designed, expediently manufactured, lack elaborate reduction
sequences, and are at times crudely made (but see Weedman 2010 for discussion of
highly skilled female knappers). However, these traits can also be used to distinguish
tools made by inexperienced rather than proficient knappers (see below), regardless

49

of sex. Additionally, without other supporting evidence, this approach diminishes the
capacity of some prehistoric people to perform technological acts with developed skill or
proficiency.
A chaîne opératoire analysis (Apel 2008; Dobres and Hoffman 1994) offers an
alternative means for recognizing conceptually distinctive approaches to tool production
that potentially corresponds with gendered perspectives on how tools should be made,
used, recycled and maintained, and discarded. This concept is broadly comparable to
what Collins’s description (1975) of a “processual approach” to reconstructing lithic
reduction and tool manufacture. The approach seeks to recognize and understand the
significance of patterned reduction acts by socially conditioned individuals through
reconstructing the behaviors of different kinds of toolmakers from the earliest stages
of reduction to a final product. Each reduction act or individual flaking event, such as
testing raw chert nodules for their suitability, final trimming of nearly finished tools,
removing flakes in different ways, shaping preforms, or maintaining core platforms,
constitutes an intentional gesture that reveals something of the social conditioning
behind it. One objective of chaîne opératoire analyses is compiling a record of different
kinds of gestures reflective of different kinds of socially conditioned individuals to
understand something about how that population views or viewed stone tool working.
As applied in the current study, the goal is to define insofar as possible conceptually
different approaches that may be found within the same cultural group to the design,
production, maintenance, and discard of stone tools that may have been used for
discrete and non-overlapping tasks. The objective of a chaîne opératoire approach is not
to ascribe individual technical acts or gestures to a certain kind of socially conditioned
person. Rather, its strength is in linking series of technological acts (technical
sequences, or “chains”) specific to different tool forms used in particular ways with
different kinds of socially conditioned persons.
In seeking evidence for gendered tool production that might have been associated
with gendered patterns in tool use and activities, three primary reduction trajectories
are identified within the overall lithic assemblage at Zatopec. These include (1)
reduction of chert nodules for bifaces intended specifically for the manufacture of
projectile points; (2) reduction of chert nodules for general purpose bifaces that in
turn offer flexibility for different kinds of tools that can be fashioned, such as flake
cores, scrapers, and other expedient implements; and (3) reduction of chert nodules
not involving any form of intentional bifacial design to create easily replaced tools for
general purposes. Technical traits including the presence of bi-polar reduction, the
kind and degree of platform preparation and maintenance, hard versus soft percussor,
and even patterns in the intensity of tool use are correlated with tool form to consider
whether these reduction trajectories ever represented two distinct technological systems
for producing kinds of tool. The presence of distinct and non-overlapping patterns of tool
design, production, and use (together, these define a socially constituted technology)

50

provide strong evidence indicating gendered distinctions in tool manufacturing and
use. If present at Zatopec, these distinguishable technological practices can be used to
hypothesize gendered divisions of labor.
Learning, Variable Skill, and Uneven Production
In addition to the effects of gender-related influences on tool design and form, use,
maintenance, and discard, the ways that different individuals learned to produce usable
implements also contributes to the variation seen in tool assemblages at Zatopec. Recent
research has made advances in how patterns of learning and skill acquisition can be
recognized in the archaeological record (Bamforth and Finlay 2008; Ferguson 2008;
Finlay 1997; Högberg 2008; Lohse 2010; Pigeot 1990; Roux et al. 1995; Shelley 1990;
Stout 2002; Weedman 2010).
Learning and skill acquisition in any craft, including flintknapping, occurs across
multiple spectra encompassing gradations in age, proficiency, or often both. In
prehistoric societies reliant on stone tools, individuals likely began acquiring skills
necessary to become adept toolmakers when they were very young. Advances in age
are accompanied by developments in both motor skill and the cognitive ability to
comprehend requirements for controlling flake removals. However, inexperience does
not always correspond with youth (e.g., Acheson 1977), and individuals who start
acquiring these skills at a later age can also produce artifacts that reflect inexperience
and a lack of toolmaking comprehension (Stout 2002). Additionally, some individuals
have higher levels of aptitude than others. Experimental studies reveal both variability
between experienced knappers, and uneven levels of performance by the same knapper
over different knapping episodes (Finlay 2008). Thus, learning and variable or uneven
production related to skill are significant components in technological behaviors
organized around certain kinds of tool production. Therefore, archaeologists should not
expect that all competent or highly experienced knappers to consistently produce tools
exhibiting the same qualities. Discussions below focus first on recognizing the process
of learning, and second on evidence for excelled or advanced production capabilities and
intensities (referred to here as uneven production), trending into what some researchers
have called specialization.
Assessing skill in stone tool manufacture is a complex and often subjective process
(Andrews 2003; Bamforth and Finlay 2008; Clark 2003; Shelley 1990; Stout 2002).
Multiple factors, both mechanical and cognitive (Roux et al. 1995), are involved that
affect the precision with which flake removals are controlled. Pelegrin (1990) has
reduced these factors to two essential concepts that describe the cognitive ability to
comprehend the requirements of tool manufacture and the physical ability to execute
the necessary tasks. Pelegrin describes the knowledgeable practice, strategic decisionmaking, and “abstract engagement” (Bamforth and Finlay 2008:3) necessary to
understand tool production as connaissance. This concept is referred to as cognitive

51

knowledge. Practical knowledge, dexterity, motivation, motor skill, and technique are
included in savoir faire, referred to as know-how (Figure 1-8).
Both experimental replication studies (Ahler 1989a; Finlay 2008; Shelley 1990)
and analyses of well contextualized archaeological assemblages (Grimm 2000; Pigeot
1990) have identified traits stemming from low skill by producers. Examples include
irregularity of form, predictable errors, stacked step and hinge terminations, mishits
and hammer marks, inconsistency in production, wasteful and ineffectual use of raw
material, failure to rejuvenate, low length-to-breadth flake ratios, and a peripheral
location with respect to where knapping activities occur (Table 1-5) (after Bamforth and
Finlay 2008: Table 2). Skilled knappers may also make any of these mistakes, however,
meaning that assessing skill levels based on these or other criteria requires analyzing
large assemblages to seek patterns in relative frequencies in the occurrences of any
of these traits. Additionally, expressed skill depends a great deal on the technological
objectives of a particular cultural pattern, and mistakes in one period might be
successes in another, meaning that skill assessments are most appropriate when
conducted within time-controlled assemblages.
As noted, some individuals have a natural ability to craft tools more skillfully
than others. At different times in the past, situational reasons or motivations existed
for developing this ability to a degree that it became a form of task or economic
specialization. In forager societies, simple age- and sex-based labor divisions and
instances of specialization are intrinsically linked, meaning that specialization, when
it occurs, is an extension of some aspect of uneven, variably skilled production. Long
ago, Emile Durkheim noted that divisions of labor often gave way to more substantial
investments of time or energy for some individuals in what he labeled organic solidarity,
or mutually interdependent relationships of functionally non-equivalent groups within
a society (compare Binford 1965:205). Burton et al. (1977:227) similarly proposed that
“division of labor has long occupied a prominent place in sociology and anthropology
as the foundation of processes of economic specialization in human society.” In the
current discussion, “specialization” refers to “a situation in which a relatively large

portion of the total production of a given item or class of items is generated by a
small segment of the population” (Cross 1990:35). John Clark and William Parry
(1990) also discuss specialization as it exists outside of ranked or stratified societies.
For them, specialization is the “production of alienable, durable goods for nondependent consumption” (Clark and Parry 1990:297). In forager societies, this kind of
specialization means not only that an individual makes a good that he or she does not
directly consume, but rather exchanges for other goods or services.
Specialized production has been widely discussed by archaeologists (Clark 1996;
Clark and Parry 1990; Costin 1991; Cross 1993), and is addressed by analysts using
a number of traits. Similar to expression of skill, specialized production will be
contextualized within a cultural system, and so may appear differently in any particular
case. Traits used by archaeologists can include standardization (Arnold 1985); quality of
workmanship (LaFlesche 1926); higher success rates (Finlay 2008); successful execution
of technically challenging steps, such as fluting (Crabtree 1966); or some combination
of these. Specialization was significant to the technological organization and practices
of many Native American groups when Europeans arrived in the New World, including
those located in Central Texas, and continued to structure economic production and
exchange well into the historic period (Figure 1-9). The differences perceived by people
between skilled specialization and normal production continued to be significant into
the early twentieth century, and is clear in the following statement by a member of the
Plains Omaha, concerning bow making: “I could make a bow for you, but it would only
be an imitation, not a real bow. Any man who can whittle and scrape with a knife can
make something like a bow, but it takes a man skilled in the making of bows to make a

53

bow as it should be made. There are only two Omaha men living who can be called bow
makers” (LaFlesche 1926:488, cited in Seeman 1985:13).
There is a critical distinction to be made between specialization defined in this
manner and a simple division of labor. In standard labor divisions, people perform
different tasks according to age or sex roles and exchange the products of their labor
with others who perform different tasks. The concept makes no assumption as to
whether some individuals are more skilled, more efficient, or spend more or less of
their time carrying out their work. Presumably, everyone in the same task group
performs approximately the same range of tasks at more or less the same intensity. In
contrast, when specialization occurs, it does so within a socially defined task group as
some people develop better skills, become more efficient, demonstrate higher success
rates, or achieve greater standardization than others. For hunter-gatherer societies,
specialization occurs in the context of divisions of labor, and is not inherently related to
the production of surplus or prestige items.
The definitions by Clark and Parry (1990) and by Cross (1993) are important for
defining specialized production as it occurs in hunter-gatherer societies in ways that can
be distinguished from more routine production. Both definitions are linked by a common
thread in which individuals who are engaged in part-time specialization spend more of
their time at a particular task than others. Thus, in addition to addressing aspects such
as greater skill, standardization, and efficiency, the scheduling time and labor must also
be considered. That is, whenever specialization occurs, it is scheduled and carried out
along with other activities. These scheduling requirements make it possible to assess
the degree to which an individual may engage in part-time specialization compared with
other members of their task group. For example, a projectile point can display exquisite
workmanship but cannot be taken as evidence of specialized production unless it can
be demonstrated that an individual spent an inordinate amount of time producing it,
to the point that he/she did not contribute as significantly to other activities ascribed to
his/her age-and sex-based task group. As a result, two ways to see specialization in the
archaeological record are (1) identifying highly specific tasks that are not shared among
larger task groups and (2) noting significant differences in the amount of time spent by
different people on the same activity.
Archaeological Evidence for Learning and Uneven Production at Zatopec
Recognizing learning and variable skill in the archaeological record is complex
and involves precisely describing and recording multiple attributes and patterns on
different parts of the assemblage. Informed by experimental studies (Ahler 1989a;
Ferguson 2008; Shelley 1990) as well as archaeological analyses that correlate higher
success rates with greater experience (Sheets 1978), the current analysis describes and
measures different traits found in several artifact categories that reveal relatively lower
or higher levels of skill. These traits are presented in Table 1-5. Analytical details and

the part-time specialists were recorded in the study area. This study used 238 groups
(from both North and South America) for this study (from Driver and Massey 1957: Map
147).

55

results are presented in Chapter 7, and discussed in Chapter 11.
Recognizing specialization, on the other hand, relies on different methods from
those used to determined relative skill levels. Nevertheless, these approaches
potentially yield different but complementary perspectives concerning the presence
and/or role of part-time specialization in hunter-gatherer economies, and what these
modes of technological organization meant for those societies. The current analysis
outlines two approaches for identifying specialization at Zatopec. The first approach is
intended to help archaeologists understand the degree of specialized production that
might have been undertaken by members of the same task group by assessing the
amount of time spent producing a particular tool form as it relates to higher rates of
success or standardization. The second approach focuses on how or whether activities
were conducted by very small groups of task-specialized people by looking at intraassemblage tool diversity.
With respect to demonstrating specialization, the manufacture of particularly skilled
items only reflects differential skill among toolmakers. Identification of specialized tool
production requires the correlation of some form of uneven production (more skilled
or greater output) with a differential investment of time. Analyzing an assemblage for
evidence of part-time specialization therefore involves multiple steps. Archaeologists
first must recognize some of the necessary steps for making different tools. Not all tools
are made with the same technical acts, and discerning techniques associated with a
particular tool form is necessary to avoid linking the time invested in making one kind
of tool to other kinds. Second, analysts must recognize higher or lower success rates for
certain technical acts based on some distinguishing characteristic or trait. Third, these
traits must be measured in a way that reflects variable time and labor investment. This
sequence of analytical steps can be reconstructed as follows: (1) artifact form x involves
production steps a, b, and c; (2) a particular technical trait defines production step a,
b, or c; and (3) more time invested in achieving this trait leads to the more successful
execution of that production step. Based on this reconstructed sequence of decisions
and acts, toolmakers who spend more time on certain traits that were necessary for the
successful production of artifact form x achieved higher success rates in producing that
particular artifact, but had less time for contributing to other activities.
An example illustrating this scenario important in the current analysis involves
billet flaking associated with the production of proportionally wide, thin bifaces. Based
on Goode’s and Johnson’s (Goode 2002; Johnson 1995; Johnson and Goode 1994, 1995)
work on Late Archaic biface production in Central and south Central Texas, analysts
paid close attention to the preparation of striking platforms of billet and other flakes.
The Late Archaic lithic tradition for the Zatopec region is characterized by broadbladed projectile points and point preforms. Producing these kinds of broad, thin
blades required well-controlled flaking using soft hammer percussors such as bone or
antler billets (Hayden and Hutchings 1989), which produce a distinctive kind of flake

56

(called billet flakes) that can be easily recognized. Many billet flakes from Zatopec show
evidence of grinding or abrading on the striking platforms. This practice is common in
biface production (Sheets 1973), and strengthens the platforms so that they can better
withstand blows of sufficient force to remove flakes that extend far into the biface. This
abrading technique, which ranges from very light (called raking) to intensive grinding
to the point of a polish (Titmus and Woods 1991), is present to varying degrees in
prehistoric assemblages at Zatopec and the surrounding region. Since increasing the
amount of abrading on some billet flake platforms leads to more successful flaking, it
can be used to indicate the amount of time that some knappers spent on this technique.
Results of the analysis of billet flake preparation are presented in Chapter 7, and
implications for part-time specialization are discussed in Chapter 11.
A second approach to understanding specialization at Zatopec involves recognizing
deliberate toolmaking behaviors that represent only a small part of the overall lithic
assemblage. This analysis focuses on evidence for specific tasks being undertaken by
only small portions of ancient societies, and relies on the presence of prismatic blade
technology over time. Blades and specially prepared blade cores have been described
for the early Paleoindian Clovis interval (Collins 1999; Collins and Lohse 2004; Green
1963) and the Toyah phase of the Late Prehistoric (Black 1986; Hester and Shafer 1975;
Ricklis 1994; see Chapter 2 for regional culture history). Blades are also found among
Native American tool kits in Spanish missions across South Texas and Northern Mexico
(Hester 1989; Inman 1999; Lohse 1999; Tomka 1999; Ricklis 2000), although blade
cores and associated debris are not frequently encountered in these contexts. Blades
and blade cores, though known to occur sporadically on Archaic sites, have received
less attention than similar materials from other time periods (Arnn 2008:310–314).
One reason for this oversight is that these materials are commonly found in only small
numbers in time periods other than those previously mentioned. Specially prepared
blade cores as well as prismatic blades are noted in small quantities at Zatopec, and
others sites (see Shafer 2006:96), suggesting that few people were associated with the
production of these implements.
Support for blades as evidence of specialization comes not only from their limited
frequency, but also from their restricted utility when compared with equivalent items.
Comparisons of blades from blade cores with flakes removed from bifacial cores in terms
of the time required to prepare and remove blades and of the usable cutting edge of
each form conclude that blade and biface cores are comparably efficient (Jennings et
al. 2010; Rasic and Andrefsky 2001). However, bifacial cores offer greater flexibility in
the kinds and sizes of potentially useful tools that can be derived, whereas blades from
blade cores are suited to a more narrow range of tasks since only long, narrow tools can
be struck from them. On the basis of their experiments, Rasic and Andrefsky (2001:77)
concluded that bifacial cores are well suited for circumstances in which a wide range
of tasks can be expected. In contrast, blade technology can be expected to be present

57

where a specific, perhaps narrow range of tasks is reliably predicted. Given the greater
task specificity associated with these tools, the authors conclude that “blade cores may
be more accurately viewed as specialized components of a tool kit that was possibly
only used in very specific situations” (Rasic and Andrefsky 2001:78). This conclusion
echoes earlier assessments by Hester and Shafer (1975:183), based on analysis of
archaeological specimens, of blades as a “specialized flint working industry” based on
their appearance in only some ecological settings. Based on these studies, the Zatopec
assemblage is analyzed for the presence of deliberate, systematic blade production using
both blades and blade cores (see Chapter 7) as possible evidence for task specialization.
Findings indicate that blades increase in frequency during certain intervals, including a
marked increase in Toyah times. From these findings, analysts can conclude that some
form of task specialization involving the greater reliance on blades was an important
part of technological organization at the site for some time periods.
Summary Discussions Concerning Technological Organization
The fourth research domain for this project is clearly involved and complex.
However, in our view this topic has perhaps the greatest potential of the four research
issues addressed at the site for describing and explaining the kinds of behavioral
variability that archaeologists seek in the archaeological record and that are necessary
for presenting the subject matter of this project in a humanistic, meaningful way.
These described approaches to technological organization have been designed to
record evidence for assemblage variation in response to multiple factors. Some factors
represent group-level decisions about how best to exploit particular resources through
changes in settlement movements, logistical behavior, and tool expediency. This facet of
the analysis yields results that can be used to characterize the diversity of technological
choices made by Zatopec residents over different time periods. However, an important
outcome of this part of the analysis is that significant differences are also apparent
reflecting the technological choices of different kinds of makers and users of tools that
clearly do not extend across the entire assemblage.
Consequently, additional factors are also considered that may have conditioned
technological organization during any particular time period. This facet of the analysis
focuses directly on the capacity of socialized individuals to contribute to technological
variation at the site. Although archaeological attention to individual persons is not
common in the study area, the results of this work (Chapters 7, 11, and 12) make clear
the potential importance of this focus for understanding how hunter-gatherer groups
organized their technologies based on sex, age, aptitude, and uneven participation in
certain tasks. In our view, these two levels of attention, one to group-level behavior
and the other to the level of individuals, are highly complementary and are essential
to accurately characterizing the full range of technological choices made by prehistoric
hunter-gatherers at Zatopec.

Environmental Setting, Previous
Investigations, Culture History
David M. Yelacic and Jon C. Lohse

This chapter introduces the context of the Zatopec site, including its environmental
setting, the regional culture history, and previous archaeological investigations.
Environmental context is divided into sections describing the soils, hydrology, flora and
fauna, climate, and paleoenvironment. Underlying geology, an important element of
environmental context, is described in Chapter 4 (Results of Excavations: Sediments
Analysis and Stratigraphy). Earlier investigations are presented in two sections, the
first about previous investigations at Zatopec, and the second about neighboring site
investigations in Hays County. Regional culture chronology, divided into Paleoindian,
Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and Historic periods, includes a synthesis of Central Texas
archaeological data from the earliest known inhabitants of the area through the arrival
of the first Europeans.
Environmental Setting
Located in an ecotone, a crossroads of ecosystems, the Zatopec site sits just below the
Balcones Escarpment, which marks the interface between the Edwards Plateau (Hill
Country) to the west and the Blackland Prairie to the east (Figure 2-1). Ecotones are
high-energy settings with the capacity to support a great diversity of plant and animal
species (Crumley 1994).
Contemporary Environment
Soils Soils of this area have been described in the Soil Survey of Comal and Hays
Counties Texas (Batte 1984). Units include Comfort-Rock outcrop complex, undulating
(CrD); Rumple-Comfort association, undulating (RUD); frequently flooded Orif soils
(Or); and, Denton silty clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes (DeB). The Comfort-Rock complex

consists of shallow, clayey soils (Comfort soils) and rock outcrops on side slopes and
hill and ridge tops. Comfort soil is typically dark brown, with a stony clay surface
layer of about six to seven inches (15.2 to 17.8 cm) in thickness overlying a subsoil of
approximately 12 inches (30.5 cm) in thickness. Rumple-Comfort soils consist of shallow
to moderately deep deposits located on uplands and side slopes. Rumple soils consist of
a dark reddish brown surface layer of cherty clay loam that averages approximately 10
inches (25.4 cm) in thickness. Underlying this is dark reddish brown clay that extends
as much as 28 inches (71.1 cm). The moderately extended depth of these associated
deposits creates the possibility for shallowly-buried deposits. However, the presence of
the soils across side slopes suggests that they are susceptible to down-slope movement.
Denton silty clays also occupy upland valley slopes. Typically, the upper-most layer of
DeB soils is 14 inches (35.5 cm) of dark grayish brown silty clay underlain by 11 inches
(27.9 cm) of dark brown silty clay. Orif soils are deep, well drained loams that compose
flood plains. Depending on their location relative to the channel, Orif soils have variable
amounts of coarse grain fragments.

Hydrology. San Marcos Springs, known as Canocanayesatetlo to the historic
Tonkawas, as St. Mark’s to European settlers, and now as Aquarena Springs, have
attracted human populations for at least 11,500 years (Tyler 1996:5:869). These are
the second largest springs in Texas and support a very large wildlife population. The
San Marcos Springs are the headwaters of the San Marcos River, which has provided
power to historic gins, corn, and grist mills (Brune 1981). The mean annual flow of
the San Marcos River is 170 cubic feet per second (cfs) (Slattery and Fahlquist 1997).
This measurement, however, depends heavily upon weather and climate, and may not
accurately represent discharge in the past. Aquarena Springs was an important stop
on Spanish El Camino Real, the historic network of roads linking interior Mexico with
frontier regions of the Spanish Empire to the north (McGraw et al. 1998). The springs
were also a stop on the Chisholm cattle trail, which in its heyday (ca. 1867–1884) led
five million cattle from as far south as the Rio Grande Valley north to Kansas where
they were shipped by railroad to eastern markets (Tyler 1996:2:89).
Purgatory Creek, located immediately southeast of 41HY163, flows approximately
20 miles from its headwaters at the western edge of Hays County to its confluence with
the San Marcos River just southeast of the City of San Marcos. The creek is dry today
and only carries water during periods of heavy rainfall. However, it probably was at
least a small perennial stream in antiquity, making the landform where the site is
located an attractive locale for seasonal habitation.
Flora and Fauna. Since the location of the site is ecotonal, characteristic flora
and fauna of both the Edwards Plateau and Blackland Prairie are present. The
region’s natural vegetation is generally a grassland-woodland-shrubland mosaic, with
grasslands separating patches of woody plants and shrubs (i.e., mesquite, Texas oak,
shin oak, cedar elm, hackberry, etc.) (Ellis et al. 1995). Tall grasses, Osage-orange
(Maclura pomifera), anaqua (Ehretia anaca), netleaf privet (Forestiera reticulata),
netleaf hackberry (Celtis reticulata), honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), and
Chinaberry (Melia azedarach) are currently present in the site vicinity.
As described by Blair (1950), typical modern fauna found in the region include whitetailed deer (Odocoileus verginianus), eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), raccoon
(Procyon lotor), North American opossum (Didelphis virginiana), and badger (Taxidea
taxus). Additionally, armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), beaver (Castor canadensis),
black rat (Rattus rattus), coyote (Canis latrans), crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus),
domestic dog (Canis familiaris), eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), eastern
wood rat (Neotoma floridana), freshwater mussel, gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus),
hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), horse (Equus caballus), muskrat (Ondatra
zibethicus), common opossum (Didelphis marsupialis), pig (Sus scrofa), red fox (Vulpes
fulva), turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), western diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus
atrox), and white-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus townsendii) are among the modern wildlife
commonly found in the area. Many of these species were also present in the prehistoric

62

period and are reflected in the site’s inventory of animal remains (see Chapter 9).
Climate. Weather in South-Central Texas is dynamic, subject to sudden and
dramatic changes and marked by severe events. In Hays County, summers have
mean maximum temperatures approaching 97° F, and winters have mean minimum
temperatures near 40° F. December and January are the only two months that have not
recorded temperatures above 90° F in historical times, whereas freezing temperatures
have been recorded anytime between October and April (Dixon 2000). The mean
annual precipitation recorded for Hays County is 33.75 in; late spring and early fall are
particularly precipitous (Dixon 2000; Tyler 1996). Hazardous weather is not uncommon
in Central Texas. The Hill Country in general has a serious threat of flash floods due
to thin soils and steep slopes. Cloudbursts may unload a relatively high volume of rain
over a small area in a short period of time, causing tributaries and rivers to rise rapidly
(Woodruff 1979). Nevertheless, drought is also common to Central Texas; no decade in
the twentieth century has been totally free of drought conditions (Bomar 1995:153).
Paleoenvironment
Reconstructing paleoenvironmental conditions, often by modeling past climatic
as well as floral and faunal variables, is an important means of understanding
prehistoric human adaptations. Paleoenvironmental reconstructions help researchers
understand the natural conditions that affected the availability of resources as well
as factors that have acted on site preservation. As ancient conditions cannot be
directly observed, however, paleoenvironmental reconstructions often rely on proxy
measures, which include but are not limited to speleothems, phytoliths, stable carbon
isotopes, sediments, and faunal remains. Paleoenvironmental proxies, as secondorder lines of evidence, do not directly reflect past environments, but can be used to
infer characteristics of past environments (Ellis et al. 1995). A single proxy varies
geographically, just as components of the environment (moisture, for instance) do
today. Additionally, proxies have disparate conditional thresholds and react differently
to environmental stimuli (Ellis et al. 1995). For example, animals within a region will
react differently to increasing aridity depending on their specific geographic location,
and plants and animals in the same specific geographic location will respond to the
same environmental stimulus at different times. Therefore, as more lines of evidence
are compiled, more is understood about a paleoenvironment.
Within the past two decades, research has increasingly contributed to the
understanding of Texas’s paleoenvironmental history (e.g. Bousman 1998; Brown 1998;
Caran 1998; Ellis et al. 1995; Frederick 1998; Fredlund et al. 1998; Kibler 1998; Ricklis
and Cox 1998). Ellis et al. (1995) noted that a large degree of environmental variation
across Texas renders regional boundaries unclear. Nonetheless, a regional focus on
proxy measures from Central Texas is necessary for the current project.
One line of evidence used for estimating prehistoric climatic conditions involves

63

calculating speleothem growth rates. Speleothems are clacitic cave deposits (i.e.,
stalactites and stalagmites) that typically grow faster with increased available moisture
(Musgrove et al. 2001). However, due to soil and epikarst moisture storage capacity
(the ability for limestone landscapes like that of Central Texas to store surface water
and keep it out of environmental circulation), soil carbonate content, and rates of
evapotranspiration, speleothem growth rates do not provide a one-to-one correlation
with available moisture at any specific time or location. Nonetheless, results of such
studies are useful for providing a general understanding of precipitation patterns
in the past. Growth rates can be calculated using uranium-series geochronologic
measurements (Musgrove et al. 2001) based on the radioactive decay (i.e., half-life) of
uranium and thorium isotopes.
Sedimentary and biological deposits, many of which are also found within
caves, can provide additional evidence for paleoenvironmental reconstructions.
Fossil pollen and stable carbon isotope records are attuned to local and regional
environmental conditions, and studies of these records are also used as indicators of the
paleoenvironment (e.g., Bousman 1998; Nordt et al. 2002). Fossilized pollens are direct
evidence of past vegetation, whereas soil stable carbon isotope ratios are characteristic
of the photosynthetic regimes of plant communities. Communities of C4 plants, which
include mid- and tall-grasses, acclimate to warmer, dryer environmental conditions,
while C3 plant communities, including woody species, are adapted to cooler, wetter
environments. Below is a generalized overview of extant records of environmental
conditions in Central Texas beginning in the late Pleistocene and extending through the
Holocene to the historic record (Figure 2-2).
Several lines of evidence suggest that the end of the Pleistocene was generally
cooler and wetter than contemporary conditions in the project area, but evidence also
indicates that climatic conditions were in flux. For example, Toomey (1993) found
evidence in the faunal record of Hall’s Cave during the Pleistocene for a generally cooler
and wetter climate based on the presence of vertebrate taxa requiring high to moderate
moisture. However, warmer, dryer intervals were evident at ca. 14,000–13,000 B.P. and
12,000–10,400 B.P.. Based on relatively increased rates of speleothem growth in the
karstic Edwards Plateau during the Pleistocene, Musgrove et al. (2001) also inferred
that Pleistocene climatic conditions were wetter. Palynological (fossil pollen) and stable
carbon isotope data from open air sites in the region also indicate generally cooler/wetter
yet fluctuating conditions by the end of the Pleistocene. Palynological evidence from
Boriack Bog, located along the eastern edge of Central Texas, indicated that vegetation
was dominated by woodlands (C3 habitats favoring cooler, wetter climates) with grassier
(C4 habitats reflecting warmer, drier conditions) intervals at ca. 16,500 B.P. and 12,500
B.P. (Bousman 1998). Nordt et al. (2002) confirmed woody vegetation patterns, indicated
by relatively decreased C4 productivity, interrupted by grassy intervals at ca. 15,500–
14,000 B.P. and 13,000–11,000 B.P., indicated by increased C4 productivity in the

64

proxies indicated by red dots and labels.

Medina River Valley, on the southern edge of Central Texas, during the Pleistocene.
The climatic and environmental transition from the Pleistocene to the Holocene was
not distinct. However, despite relatively brief cool and wet intervals, the Holocene was
generally warmer and dryer than the Pleistocene. The Pleistocene–Holocene transition
is characterized by a decrease in speleothem growth rates, indicating a warmer, dryer
climatic trend (Musgrove et al. 2001). A relative increase in the presence of grass
fossil pollens indicates a trend of increasing grassland vegetation and a warmer, dryer
climate in the late Pleistocene (ca. 12,500 B.P.), but a decline in grass pollens until ca.
9200 B.P. suggests a cooler/wetter climatic trend into the Holocene (Bousman 1998). C4
plant productivity increased during the Younger Dryas stadial (ca. 11,000–10,000 B.P.;
i.e., Pleistocene–Holocene boundary), also indicating a warmer and dryer climate, before
markedly decreasing from ca. 8000–7000 B.P. (Nordt et al. 2002). Faunal remains
of mesic (moist) adapted taxa were replaced by arid adapted taxa at the end of the
Pleistocene, but ca. 10,400–9000 B.P. marked the most mesic period of the Holocene at
Hall’s Cave, as indicated by the presence of certain taxa (Toomey 1993).

65

Although there were general trends towards a warmer, dryer climate during the
Holocene in Central Texas, some fluctuation in conditions did occur (Bousman 1998;
Mauldin et al. 2010.; Nordt et al. 2002). In addition to overall climatic flux, Toomey
(1993) inferred that during the Holocene seasonal variation in temperature and
precipitation increased. Interrupting the arid Altithermal interval (ca. 7500–3000 B.P.)
during the middle Holocene, the increased arboreal fossil pollen and decreased C4 plant
productivity suggest a relatively cooler/wetter climatic interval (Bousman 1998; Nordt
et al. 2002). Timing, severity, causes, and geographic extent of the Altithermal are
unclear and certainly did not manifest homogenously across the landscape. Johnson and
Goode (1994) suggested that the proximity of Central Texas to the Gulf of Mexico and/or
the influence from the Pacific Ocean air currents may have ameliorated the local effects
of the Altithermal.
Environmental conditions following the Altithermal were generally warm and
dry but cooler and wetter than those of the Altithermal. Seasonal fluctuations were
increasingly evident after the Altithermal. Fossil pollens indicate the replacement of
grasslands by woodlands (Bousman 1998). However, faunal remains from Hall’s Cave
provided evidence for a brief return to cool and moist conditions near ca. 2500–2000
B.P., with a return to more arid conditions leading up to the present (Toomey 1993).
According to Nordt et al. (2002), an increase in C4 plant production from ca. 3000-1500
B.P., indicating a warmer, dryer climate, was preceded by a relatively cooler interval
at ca. 4000–2500 B.P. Following moister, cooler conditions prior to ca. 1000 B.P. as
indicated by Nordt et al. (2002) and Toomey (1993), Blum and Valastro (1989) recorded
evidence of a transition to the present climate.
Analyses of the developmental histories of some river systems that run through
Central Texas complement pollen, speleothem, and isotope data. For example, ca. 1000
B.P., sediment load carried by the Pedernales River, situated in the eastern part of
the Edwards Plateau, changed from coarse-grained to more fine-grained sediments as
a concomitant decrease in width-to-depth channel ratio occurred (Blum and Valastro
1989). The shift in sediment load and channel morphology indicates decreasing
discharge, which in turn suggests an increasingly dryer climate.
Mauldin et al. (2010) confirmed a general decrease in moisture at this time,
although at a finer scale, and also observed erratic fluctuations in precipitation. Using
the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), a mathematical model of soil moisture based
on historical records of precipitation and temperature commonly used in agriculture
as an index of drought, Mauldin et al. (2010) concluded that weather patterns over the
last 1000 years grew increasingly volatile, with brief periods of heavier-than-normal
rainfall interrupted by exceedingly dry conditions. Recent research has correlated
a grid of dendochronologies (dates taken from tree rings) with PDSI to extrapolate
drought conditions in the United States for up to the past 1000 years (Alley 1984; Cook
et al. 1999), rendering the model useful for archaeologists dealing with this time span.

66

Mauldin et al. (2010) calculated year-to-year PDSI variability using data from four
grid points that frame Central Texas and found that in general, weather from year-toyear became more variable after A.D. 1000 (Figure 2-3). This increase in variation may
have contributed to higher levels of bison mobility, with related implications for human
groups who relied heavily on that resource.
Overall, reviews of paleoenvironmental reconstructions are meant to supplement
and provide an environmental foundation for archaeological investigations. Generally,
the environment of Central Texas during the late Pleistocene was suited for the cooler,
wetter climate. During the Pleistocene-to-Holocene transition, the environment became
increasing arid, peaking during the middle Holocene Altithermal. After the Altithermal,
the climate had a brief period of cooler temperature and increased moisture before
reaching the more arid conditions of the present. Importantly, the last millennium has
been characterized not only by increasing aridity, but also by dramatically increasing
year-to-year temperature and precipitation fluctuations.
Previous Investigations at Zatopec
The initial site survey of 41HY163 was made in June 1983, and subsequent excavations
were conducted during the summers of 1983, 1984, 1985, and 1986, under direction of
Dr. James Garber, Katherine Brown, and David Driver and sponsored by Texas State
University-San Marcos (then Southwest Texas State University). In 2002, the site was
briefly resurveyed and tested by limited shovel probes (Karbula et al. 2003). In 2007
CAS initiated data recovery excavations at the site. Each of these projects employed
slightly different approaches to understanding the site, its stratigraphic components,
and the record of Native American occupation that it contains.

In the first two years of the field school, 1983–1984, test units were distributed
relatively evenly across the site with a few exceptions where trench-like units were
excavated to delineate large features. The rest of the field school units, excavated from
1985 to 1987, were located in the northern part of the site, in the vicinity of a large
burned rock midden and an area of perceived domestic debris. Units were numbered
in a series beginning with 1 and extending to more than 70. During these years,
approximately 173 m2 of sediment were excavated to varying depths in arbitrary 10 cm
levels or by natural levels where these were apparent. Most of the excavations consisted
of 2-x-2 m units further subdivided into four 1-x-1 m quadrants for finer resolution.
Smaller excavations units were occasionally used to determine the extent of certain
activity areas. All excavated sediment was passed through 1/4-in mesh screens. At
least 14 features, representing various stages of lithic production, cooking, butchering
and domestic occupation, were observed and recorded at the site during field school
excavations (Garber 1987). Units were often excavated in blocks of four or more, were
used to expose large features, and were staggered to increase the area covered. This
method of excavation yielded a broad horizontal exposure.
Research goals underwent change through the course of the field schools, but the
theme of investigating prehistoric settlement patterns and subsistence strategies of the
San Marcos area remained constant (Garber 1987). Broad horizontal exposures were
used to investigate the spatial organization of this hunter-gatherer camp, and trenchlike units were used to reveal profiles and the vertical distribution of features. When the
focus of excavations shifted to the northern part of the site after the discovery of large
burned rock middens, a large core reduction area, and postholes, research questions or
goals were turned toward investigating the cultural lifeways of the Transitional Archaic
inhabitants of the region.
In February of 2002, archaeologists from Hicks & Co. revisited the site as part of
an intensive pedestrian survey for the proposed Wonder World Drive Extension Project
(Karbula et al. 2003). These investigations focused on assessing the level of overall
site integrity and the degree of disturbance that may have occurred since the earlier
field schools (Karbula et al. 2003:21). During this brief project, seven shovel tests
were excavated. Results revealed that, although the western part of the site had been
impacted by the construction of a large dam and spillway control feature, a significant
segment of the site remained and potentially contained intact cultural strata.
In August of 2007, CAS initiated data recovery excavations at the site. One of the
first field tasks was to relocate the earlier field school grid system so that the 2007
excavations could complement the earlier data. All CAS units were assigned coordinates
based on their location in relation to this grid (Figure 2-4). Initially, 14 m2 were to be
excavated by hand, with at least 10 m2 of this area dedicated to the northern part of
the site where the putative Transitional Archaic structure had been identified. The
remaining units were to be placed in a part of the site that had not been previously

68

investigated. This original level of effort was expanded when human remains were
identified in the southernmost two units, which were expanded by two additional square
meters.
Following the manual excavations of 16 m2, the site area was mechanically stripped
of overburden to search for other possible features. Five areas were identified in this
activity as possible features or activity areas and were cross-sectioned in order to record
their profiles. Each of these excavations exposed approximately one square meter.
Additionally, scraping revealed a deposit of sediments older than those encountered
during the original CAS excavations. This layer was sampled with two additional square
meters. The mechanical scraping also identified two additional sets of human remains
each of which required 2 m2 of hand excavation. By the time the 2007 CAS excavations
were concluded, a total of 21 1-x-1 m units and one .50-x-2 m unit had been excavated
in addition to the earlier SWT excavations (see Figure 2-4). All CAS excavations were
conducted in arbitrary 10 cm levels, with elevations controlled from a central datum
point established in the middle of the site. Some exceptions occurred in cases where
natural or cultural stratigraphy could be observed in features or possible features.
These exceptions are discussed in the individual feature descriptions (see Chapter 5).
After the completion of excavations, the remaining accessible part of the site area was
mechanically stripped to ensure that no further features or human burials remained.
Previous Investigations in the Vicinity of 41HY163
Located near 41HY163 and the fertile San Marcos Springs are several recorded sites,
including 41HY37, 41HY147, 41HY160, 41HY161, 41HY165, 41HY317, 41HY319,
and 41HY432. A brief description of each site is presented using information from the
Archeological Site Atlas Database (Database) and available technical reports.
The site of Edward Burleson’s San Marcos homestead has been designated 41HY37.
The Texas military hero and politician built his log cabin atop the ridge overlooking San
Marcos Springs in 1848 (Bousman and Nickels 2003). A 1983 excavation by a Texas
State field school directed by Dr. James Garber discovered a prehistoric component
of the site (Garber and Orloff 1984). Prewitt and Associates, Inc. revisited 41HY37
and performed further investigation through mechanically excavated trenches (Arnn
1999). Stratified cultural deposits and a Late Archaic projectile point, recovered by
archaeologists from Prewitt and Associates, Inc., and diagnostic projectile points,
discovered by Garber, dated the range of prehistoric occupation at this site from
the Middle Archaic to the Late Prehistoric. Through investigations of the Burleson
homestead in the summer of 2000, CAS archaeologists discovered that the site had been
severely disturbed by the modern construction of a replica cabin and a gondola station
(Bousman and Nickels 2003).
As described by James Warren (1977) in the Database, site 41HY135, a State
Archeological Landmark, was discovered at the confluence of the San Marcos River and

Purgatory Creek during an aerial survey performed by the Soil Conservation Service
for a San Marcos Riverfront Park. The site, of unknown age, consisted of a surface lithic
scatter and showed modern disturbance from a sewer line and gravel path and from
natural erosion. Testing was recommended to further delineate the site both vertically
and horizontally, but no information about further investigations was found.

70

In 1978, Southern Methodist University (SMU) professor Joel Shiner (1979, 1981,
1983) began underwater investigations at Spring Lake, an artificial lake created by
damming the San Marcos River just downstream from the springs. Shiner first began
excavating at site 41HY161, which appeared to be disturbed and contained a mixture
of prehistoric and historic artifacts. In 1979, Shiner shifted investigations to 41HY147,
located adjacent to a large springhead. At 41HY147, he recognized three strata on
an eroded slope at the base of the escarpment. The top stratum contained shouldered
and notched Archaic projectile points, the middle stratum contained shouldered and
lanceolate projectile points, and deepest stratum contained Paleoindian projectile
points and large faunal remains. Shiner’s underwater excavations produced abundant
evidence of Archaic and Paleoindian occupations, but the remains were not found in
sedimentary contexts that could be used to reconstruct detailed views of the lifeways of
past occupants. Nevertheless, Shiner (1983) proposed that Paleoindian inhabitants of
41HY147 were semi-sedentary and stayed at the springs for long periods of time. This
hypothesis was based on the relatively large number of Paleoindian projectile points
and bones found in his excavations compared to well-known kill sites in the High Plains.
Additionally, he suggested that the presence of large springs with constant water
temperatures would have allowed “edible flora and fauna [to] be available year-round”
and the “green foliage near the temperate water would [have] attract[ed] large fauna
during the dry or cold seasons” (Shiner 1983:5–6). However, Johnson and Holliday
(1983) contested this hypothesis and suggested that the abundance of projectile points
was related to the abundant supplies of chert available in the region rather than to a
semi-sedentary pattern of mobility.
Site 41HY160, a State Archeological Landmark, was investigated during a field
school directed by Dr. James Garber. As described by Garber et al. (1983), the site is
located near Tee Box 6 of the Texas State University Golf Course, adjacent to Spring
Lake, and was investigated through the excavation of 1-x-1 m and 2-x-2 m units.
Chipped stone tools, burned rock hearths and middens, a post mold, and a stone
alignment, all representing the Paleoindian period through the Late Prehistoric period,
were recovered, although Paleoindian materials appeared not to be in situ. Further
investigations were recommended, and in 2001, CAS conducted extensive testing of the
site (Bousman et al. 2003). One component of the 2001 testing of 41HY160 included the
excavation of 22 cores that were described and analyzed by Dr. Lee C. Nordt (Bousman
et al. 2010). Through this investigation, Nordt defined a total of six depositional units,
A through F, across the San Marcos River/Sink Creek Valley, that reflect changes in the
course of Sink Creek, periods of increased and decreased stream flow, and changes in
the resulting depositional regimes. These units were deposited in chronological order,
from oldest to most recent, and range from Paleoindian (A) to Late Prehistoric and
Historic periods (F). The Tee Box 6 excavations remain largely unreported.

71

State Archeological Landmark site 41HY161, located just below the Ice House Dam
to the south of the springs, was initially investigated by Joel Shiner. His data showed a
significant amount of disturbance, with Archaic artifacts found to be mixed with historic
artifacts. In the early- to mid-1980s, a series of field schools, directed by Dr. James
Garber investigated sites in San Marcos and included fieldwork at 41HY161. A decade
later, in 1992, Drs. Garber and Glassman recovered two prehistoric burials from the
site. Preservation of the bone was moderate, but both burials were disturbed and only
partially recovered (Garber and Glassman 1992; see Chapter 8). As described by Aery
(2007), prior to development in the 1990s, testing of the southwestern part of the site
revealed an intact Late Archaic component overlying a Late Paleoindian component
(Ford and Lyle 1998; Lyle et al. 2000). Eric Oksanen (2007) and Dave Nickels
supervised the most recent excavations of site 41HY161 in 2004, during which intact
Early Archaic deposits were encountered.
In 1984, 41HY165, also in the vicinity of Spring Lake, was recorded and briefly
tested. Excavations were renewed in 1996 and continued through 1998. Jennifer
Giesecke (1998) analyzed the faunal remains for a class project. Christopher Ringstaff
(2001) analyzed the artifacts and depositional contexts for his M.A. thesis. Otherwise,
the excavations at this site have not been reported.
Site 41HY317, a late Holocene burned rock and lithic scatter, was discovered during
an intensive survey performed by the Center for Archaeological Studies (Jones 2003).
As described by Richard S. Jones (2003), shovel tests and backhoe trenches revealed
cultural deposits and the potential for deeper, intact deposits. However, no diagnostic
artifacts were recovered, and it was recommended that further investigations at
41HY317 be conducted.
The Center for Archaeological Studies performed a survey on behalf of the City
of San Marcos in 2001, resulting in the discovery of 41HY319, a prehistoric site of
unknown age (Barrera 2002). Beneath disturbed sediments, a possible intact cultural
deposit, represented by lithic debitage, was found with an upper boundary of 50
centimeters below surface. Due to the shallow nature of the proposed development
and the absence of temporally diagnostic artifacts, no further work was recommended
(Barrera 2002).
In the spring of 2007, site 41HY432 was discovered by archaeologists from Hicks &
Co. while they were conducting a survey for the City of San Marcos. A combination of
shovel tests and mechanical excavation revealed a prehistoric site of undeterminable
age (King 2007). As described by King (2007), the proximity and similar depth suggested
that 41HY432 is potentially an extension of 41HY319.
Regional Cultural Chronology
The cultural chronologies for Central and South Texas are not well understood or
agreed upon. However, archaeological deposits indicate rich cultural development

72

spanning several millennia. Black (1995), Hester (1995, 2004), and Collins (1995, 2004)
have recently synthesized available archaeological evidence from the region. All dates
are in the radiocarbon time scale and given as years before present (B.P., i.e. before
1950). Human presence is divided into three periods: Prehistoric, Protohistoric and
Historic.
Prehistoric
The Prehistoric period is divided into three major temporal stages, the Paleoindian,
Archaic and Late Prehistoric. The Paleoindian stage begins with the earliest known
human occupation of North America and extends to approximately 8800 B.P. The
Archaic stage follows, extending from ca. 8800 B.P. to 1250 B.P. The Late Prehistoric
stage begins ca. 1250 B.P. and is characterized by the development of bow and arrow
and ceramic technologies.
Paleoindian
Collins (1995:381–385, 2004) dated the Paleoindian period in Central Texas to
11,500–8800 B.P.; we divide the Paleoindian into Early (ca. 11,500–10,200 B.P.) and
Late (ca. 10,200–8800 B.P.) phases. Early Paleoindian artifacts are associated with the
Clovis and Folsom cultures and diagnostic items include fluted, lanceolate projectile
points. Clovis is also characterized by well-made prismatic blades (Collins 1995; Green
1964). The Early Paleoindian stage is generally characterized by nomadic cultures that
relied heavily on hunting large game animals (Black 1989). However, recent research
has suggested that early Paleoindian subsistence patterns were considerably more
diverse than previously thought and included reliance on local fauna, including turtles
(Black 1989; Bousman et al. 2004; Collins and Brown 2000; Hester 1983; Lemke and
Timperley 2008). Folsom cultures are considered to be specialized bison hunters, as
inferred from the geographic location and artifactual composition of sites (Collins 1995).
The Late Paleoindian substage occurred from ca.10,200–8800 B.P.. Reliable
evidence for these dates was recovered from the Wilson-Leonard site, north of Austin
(Bousman et al. 2004; Collins 1998). At Wilson-Leonard, archaeologists excavated an
occupation known as Wilson, named for the unique corner-notched projectile point. The
dense occupation also included a human burial (Bousman et al. 2004; Collins 1998). In
addition to the Wilson occupation, Golondrina-Barber and St. Mary’s Hall components,
dating between 9500 and 8800 B.P., were excavated. Collins (1995) suggested the
Wilson, Golondrina-Barber, and St. Mary’s Hall components represent a transitional
period between the Paleoindian and Archaic Periods due to the subtle presence of
notched projectile points and burned-rock cooking features.
Archaic
Collins (1995, 2004) has contended that the Archaic stage in Central Texas lasted
approximately 7500 years, from 8800–1200/1300 B.P., and has divided the stage into

73

Early, Middle and Late Archaic based on Weir’s (1976) chronology. The Archaic stage
marks several transitions: a shift in hunting focus from Pleistocene megafauna to
smaller animals, the increased use of plant food resources and use of ground stones in
food processing, increased implementation of stone cooking technology, increased use
of organic materials for tool manufacturing and an increase in the number and variety
of lithic tools for woodworking, the predominance of corner- and side-notched projectile
points, greater population stability and less residential mobility, and systematic burial
of the dead. What appears as a new emphasis on organic materials in tool technologies
and diet is more likely a reflection of preservation bias.
Early Archaic. Although Collins (1995:383, 2004) argued that the Early Archaic
spanned the period from 8800 B.P. to 6000 B.P. based on three divisions of projectile
point types, the current project considers the Early Archaic to have extended from
8800 B.P. to 5800 B.P., based on Collins (1995) and Prewitt (1981b, 1985). Significant
changes in lithic technology, seen through notched projectile points and specialized tools
(e.g. Clear Fork and Guadalupe bifaces), as well as a dietary adjustment, as evidenced
by the increased number of ground stone artifacts and burned rock midden cooking
features, distinguish this cultural period from previous ones (Collins 1995; Turner
and Hester 1993:246–256). A variable climate and concomitant variation in game
resources (i.e. bison, Dillehay 1974) were strongly related to a shift in subsistence, and
Collins (1995) suggested that Early Archaic peoples occupied the wetter portions of the
Edwards Plateau. Early Archaic sites are thinly dispersed and are seen across a wide
area of Texas and northern Mexico (Weir 1976). However, Collins (1995:383) noted
a concentration of Early Archaic components along the southeastern margins of the
Edwards Plateau, close to major spring localities such as in San Marcos.
Middle Archaic. The Middle Archaic, defined by Collins (1995, 2004) as 6000 B.P.
to 4000 B.P. (5800 B.P. to 4000 B.P. for the current project), is approximately marked
by the onset of the Altithermal. As noted above, climate fluctuated from arid to mesic
to arid in Central Texas during the Altithermal. Vegetation and wildlife regimes
all fluctuated in response to these environmental oscillations, with human groups
responding accordingly. Collins (1995) divided the Middle Archaic period by projectile
point style intervals: Bell-Andice-Calf Creek, Taylor, and Nolan and Travis. The BellAndice-Calf Creek interval was a mesic period when grasslands, attractive to bison
herds, expanded southward into Central and South Texas. Bell-Andice-Calf Creek
peoples, as evidenced by hunting-based lithic technology, were specialized bison hunters
who followed the herds southward (Johnson and Goode 1994). As the period shifted
from mesic to arid, both bison and bison hunters retreated northward. During this
transitional period, Taylor bifaces were manufactured. Later in the Middle Archaic,
Taylor bifaces were replaced by Nolan and Travis points (Collins 1995, 2004). The
Nolan-Travis interval was a period when temperature and aridity were at their highest
levels. Prehistoric inhabitants acclimated themselves to peak aridity as seen through

74

increased utilization of xerophytes such as sotol (Johnson and Goode 1994). These
plants were typically baked in earthen ovens and reflected the development of burned
rock middens. During more arid episodes, the aquifer-fed streams and resource-rich
environments of Central Texas were extensively utilized (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125,
128).
Late Archaic. The Central Texas Late Archaic spanned the period of ca. 4000–1250
B.P. (Collins 1995:384, 2004). For finer resolution, the current project divides the Late
Archaic period by Johnson and Goode’s (1994) subperiods: Late Archaic I, 4000–2200
B.P., and Late Archaic II, 2200–1250 B.P. Sites with ideal stratigraphic separation
may reveal three discernable subperiods for the Late Archaic (e.g., Prewitt 1981b,
1985). Late Archaic I, according to Johnson and Goode (1994), is marked by two
significant cultural traits: 1) the billet thinning of bifacial knives and projectile points
leapt forward in artistry and technology, and 2) the human population appears to have
increased. These patterns vary considerably through time and from one subregion to
another across Central Texas but strongly shape the archaeological record of the Late
Archaic. Overall, evidence suggests an increasingly mesic climate through the Late
Archaic (Collins 1995; Johnson and Goode 1994; Mauldin et al. 2010). Mauldin et al.
(2010) suggested that climatic variation resulted in a general decrease in grassland
bison range. Some archaeologists have noted the presence of cemeteries at sites such as
Ernest Witte (Hall 1981) and Olmos Dam (Lukowski 1988) as evidence that populations
indeed increased in size and that groups were becoming territorial (Story 1985:44–45).
However, other archaeologists have challenged the interpretation of a growing
population by citing a decrease in burned rock middens (Prewitt 1981:80–81).
Late Prehistoric
Collins (1995, 2004) dated the Late Prehistoric in Central Texas at 1,300/1,200
B.P.–260 B.P. and followed Kelley (1947) in dividing it into Austin and Toyah phases.
The current project delimits the Austin phase to 1250–750 B.P. and the Toyah phase
to 750–300 B.P. The most distinctive changes in relation to previous eras include a
technological shift away from the dart and atlatl to the bow and arrow, and the more or
less concurrent appearance of pottery (Black 1989:32; Story 1985:45–47).
Austin Phase. The Austin phase is characterized primarily by the appearance of
arrow points, including Scallorn and Edwards types. Evidence for increased social strife,
and perhaps overall population density, has been seen in numerous Central Texas
burials dated to this period, which have revealed incidents of arrow-wound deaths,
suggesting that population growth may have resulted in disputes over limited resource
availability (Black 1989; Meissner 1991; Prewitt 1974). Burned rock middens are
occasionally found with these types of points (Houk and Lohse 1993), and ground and
pecked stone tools, used for plant food processing, become increasingly common in the
Austin phase.

75

Toyah Phase. The beginning of the Toyah phase (750 B.P.) in Central Texas is
characterized by contracting stem points with flaring, barbed shoulders, a style known
as Perdiz; by the common occurrence of blade technology that is considered to be
part of a specialized Toyah bison hunting and processing toolkit (Black and McGraw
1985; Huebner 1991; Ricklis 1994); and by the appearance of bone-tempered pottery
in Central Texas (Johnson 1994:241–281). The wide variety of ceramic styles and
influences seen throughout Toyah phase ceramic assemblages provide information
about the social composition of these cultural groups (Arnn 2005). Toyah phase ceramic
assemblages display Caddo, Texas Gulf Coast, and Jornada Mogollon influences (Arnn
2005). In addition to shifts in material technology, Mauldin et al. (2010) suggested that
bison herds foraged across increasingly widespread ranges, at least partly in response to
climatic patterns described above. They (Mauldin et al. 2010) concluded that this change
in bison herd behavior is partly responsible for a change in Toyah hunting strategy,
involving increasingly logistically-organized hunting forays in pursuit of spatially
dispersed herds (also see Chapters 7, 11). Based on the ratio of zooarchaeological to
archaeobotanical data associated with types of sites (e.g. bulk plant processing, bulk
meat processing, residential), Dering (2008) provided further evidence of Toyah phase
logistically-oriented subsistence strategies and broad diet breadths. Included with
logistical subsistence strategies was what appears to be either trade for horticultural
products not produced in Central Texas or, of limited localized horticultural practices.
Both scenarios involve maize, which is exceedingly uncommon in Toyah-period
archaeological contexts in Central Texas, but which has been reported from at least
three locales, the Kyle Rockshelter (41HI1) in Hill County (Jelks 1962), Bear Branch
(41CA13) in Callahan County (Adams 2002), and the Timmeron Rockshleter (41HY95)
in Hays County (Harris 1985).
Protohistoric (Spanish Entrada Period)
In Texas, the Protohistoric period, also known as the Spanish Entrada period, was
marked by Spanish entradas, the formal expeditions from established forts and missions
in Northern Mexico into Central, Coastal, and East Texas in the late seventeenth and
early eighteenth centuries. These encounters began with the venture into Texas by
the Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca and the Narvaez expedition in 1528. The period
is generally dated between 1500 and 1700 (or 1528, the date of the Cabeza de Vaca/
Narvaez expedition, to the establishment of the first Spanish mission, Mission San
Antonio de Valero in 1718).
With Alonso de León’s expedition of 1680, El Camino Real (the King’s Road) was
established from Villa Santiago de la Monclova in Mexico to East Texas. This roadway
followed established Native American trade routes and trails and became a vital link
between Mission San Juan Bautista in Northern Mexico and the Spanish settlement of
Los Adaes in East Texas (McGraw et al. 1991).

76

Spanish priests accompanying entradas provided the most complete information
of indigenous cultures of early Texas. Those documented during the early entradas
include the Cantona, Muruam, Payaya, Sana, and Yojuane, who were settled around the
springs at San Marcos and described as semi-nomadic bands. Other tribes encountered
at San Marcos included mobile hunting parties from villages in South and West Texas,
including Catequeza, Cayanaaya, Chalome, Cibolo, and Jumano, who were heading
toward bison hunting grounds in the Blackland Prairies (Foster 1995:265–289; Johnson
and Campbell 1992; Newcomb 1993). Later groups who migrated into the region and
displaced the earlier groups or tribes included the Tonkawa from Oklahoma and Lipan
and Comanche from the Plains (Campbell and Campbell 1985; Dunn 1911; Newcomb
1961, 1993).
Archaeological sites dated to this period often contain a mix of both European
imported goods, such as metal objects and glass beads, and traditional Native American
artifacts, such as manufactured stone tools.
Historic
Spanish settlement in Central Texas first occurred in San Antonio with the
establishment of Mission San Antonio de Valero (the Alamo) in 1718, and the later
founding of San Antonio de Béxar (Bolton 1970; Habig 1977; de la Teja 1995).
Some researchers have demarcated the transition in Texas between the Entrada
(Protohistoric) and Historic periods by the construction of the first Spanish missions
in Texas. Most knowledge of this period has been gained through the written records
of the early Spanish missionaries. Besides the mission town of San Antonio, the only
other Spanish settlement in the region was San Marcos de Neve, established in 1808,
four miles south of present day San Marcos. San Marcos de Neve was abandoned in
1812 as a result of constant raids by local tribes (Dobie 1932). During this time, massive
depopulation occurred among the Native Americans, mostly due to European diseases
to which the indigenous people had little resistance. Those few indigenous people
remaining were nearly all displaced to reservations by the mid-1850s (Fisher 1998).
European presence in the region increased as settlers received land grants from the
Mexican government until 1835. Settlement was difficult, however, due to continuation
of hostilities with and raids by Native American tribes. The Texas Rangers provided
protection from these conflicts after Texas secured independence from Mexico in 1836.
Settlement in the region increased until 1845, when Texas gained admission to the
United States, resulting in the formation of Hays County three years later (Bousman
and Nickels 2003).

Chapter III
Methods

and

Proveniences

David M. Yelacic and Jon C. Lohse

Excavations were conducted at 41HY163 over a period of 25 years, from 1983 to 2007.
Different approaches to site excavation were applied during this time (see Chapter 2,
Previous Investigations), resulting in some variation in how contexts were defined and
sampled. The objective of Chapter 3 is to present different analytical units (AUs) that
were defined through the laboratory analysis. At Zatopec, analytical units are discrete,
intact deposits of sediment that represent recognizable periods in the occupational
history of the site. Based on varying lines of evidence, the deposits of a single analytical
unit are thought to be unmixed and relatively undisturbed and best reflect changes in
adaptive or technological strategies over time. These analytical units provide the basis
for all detailed, context-specific analyses that were conducted at the site.
Analytical units were defined using a hierarchy of typological and technological
information intended to reveal (1) unmixed deposits that (2) can be ordered with respect
to time. Excavated contexts from the SWT field schools and the CAS excavations were
evaluated together by the same criteria. In some cases, these data were supplemented
and verified with absolute dates on bone or charcoal. Because some initial radiocarbon
dates indicated that carbon fragments had been dislocated from their original
depositional pattern (see Chapter 5), in no cases were absolute dates used to place
an excavated lot into a specific analytical unit without corroborating typological
or technological information. This method of defining analytical units emphasizes
cross-dating principles by relying on previously established regional Central Texas
chronological sequences. The result is a number of excavated proveniences (mostly oneby-one meter units excavated in arbitrary 10-cm levels) that can be associated with a
given time period but that might not necessarily adjoin other contemporary excavated
lots.

78

Data employed to define analytical units include diagnostic dart points of the
Archaic, and arrow points and ceramic sherds distinctive to the Late Prehistoric.
Though some bifacial forms, including Pipe Creek, Hare, Granbury, and Covington
bifaces, have been considered by some analysts as diagnostic of certain Archaic or Late
Prehistoric time periods, we did not use them here. Other technologies, specifically
prismatic blade-and-core production, have also been associated elsewhere with temporal
periods or phases, but results of the current analysis clearly indicate that blade
production was not limited to specific time periods. Accordingly, when these technologies
occur at Zatopec, they are discussed and assessed in the context of analytical units, but
are not used to define them.
Diagnostic point type information distinguished Paleoindian; Early, Middle, and Late
Archaic; and Late Prehistoric periods. Technological distinctions between dart and arrow
points distinguished Late Archaic from Late Prehistoric contexts. Dart point types were
used to subdivide the Late Archaic into two phases (Late Archaic I and Late Archaic
II). The Late Prehistoric was similarly divided into early Late Prehistoric (Austin
phase) and late Late Prehistoric (Toyah phase). Unit-levels that show technological or
typological evidence for more than one time period were considered mixed or compressed
and were not considered useful for assessing behavioral changes through time. A large
number of unit-levels contained no time-diagnostic information whatsoever. Because it is
impossible to know whether these contain mixed or intact deposits, they did not receive
an analytical unit designation. No unmixed Paleoindian or Early Archaic proveniences
were recognized, and no conclusions about these time periods at Zatopec are possible
other than to note their presence. Only one unmixed unit-level was dated to the Middle
Archaic; consequently, the current analysis deals hardly at all with this time period.
Point type information was graciously provided by Elton Prewitt.
Two levels of resolution are observed in the analytical units at Zatopec. The first
corresponds to general time periods in Central Texas chronology (see Chapter 2). These
units include Late Prehistoric (AU 1), Late Archaic (AU 2), and Middle Archaic (AU 3).
The second, more precise scale of resolution corresponds to intervals or phases defined
for Central Texas by Prewitt (1981a, 1983, 2005) and Johnson and Goode (1994). At
this level of resolution, AU 1 is divided into AU 1a, representing Toyah Phase deposits,
and AU 1b, representing Austin Phase deposits. AU 2 is divided into AU 2a and AU
2b, representing Late Archaic II and Late Archaic I deposits, respectively. No finer
subdivision of the limited Middle Archaic component is possible.
Analytical Units
Analytical Unit 1
AU 1 represents unmixed sediments dating to the Late Prehistoric. This analytical
unit is subdivided into AU 1a (Toyah Phase) and AU 1b (Austin Phase). AU 1 includes
all unit-levels where ceramics and arrow points or point fragments were found above

79

established Archaic-period analytical units (Figure 3-1). In some cases, an Archaic dart
point or point fragment was present. In these instances, the specimen was examined
for signs of reworking or resharpening. If the artifact showed signs of having been
reworked, it was assumed that it had been picked up in the past and redeposited in a
later time period and that it did not indicate mixed or disturbed deposits. Many point
fragments showed signs of burning or heavy patination. In these instances the artifact
was also assumed to have been redeposited into a later context.

indicate stratigraphic extent of AU 1 deposits.

80

Analytical Unit 1a
AU 1a (Figure 3-2) represents the Toyah Phase. The beginning of the Toyah phase
(ca. 750–300 B.P.) in Central Texas is discernible by the appearance of Perdiz points,
with contracting stems and flaring, barbed shouldered (see Johnson 1994). Unit-levels
containing Perdiz points that did not also contain arrow points characteristic of the
Austin Phase, or with Archaic artifacts that were not clearly recycled and reworked
were designated AU 1a. Finer in resolution and slightly smaller in sample size than AU
1, this analytical unit offers insights into local and regional technological shifts within
the later part of the Late Prehistoric Period.
Analytical Unit 1b
AU 1b represents the Austin Phase (Figure 3-3). The Austin Phase (ca. 1250–750
B.P.) is characterized by certain arrow point types including but not limited to Scallorn,
Alba, and Edwards. Ceramics are also present in this period, but were not used to
distinguish AU 1b from AU 1a contexts. AU 1b consists of unit-levels containing only
these kinds of typed arrow points, but not situated above AU 1a or below AUs 2 and 3.
Analytical Unit 2
AU 2 (Figure 3-4) encompasses the entire Late Archaic. As with AU 1, this
analytical unit represents a large span of time that incorporates much technological
variation. It can be further subdivided into AU 2a, corresponding to the Late Archaic
II (ca. 2200–1250 B.P.), and AU 2b, which encompasses the Late Archaic I (ca. 4000–
2200 B.P.). Unit-levels containing artifacts diagnostic of the Late Archaic and that are
stratified with respect to earlier and later deposits are designated as AU 2. AU 2 is
easily the largest at the site. Its broad nature allows analysts to observe general trends
in Late Archaic culture, and can offer some insight into changes between the Middle
Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods.
Analytical Unit 2a
AU 2a (Figure 3-5) designates unit-levels where the Late Archaic II subperiod, as
defined by Johnson and Goode (1994), can be isolated. Unfortunately, stratigraphic
resolution at Zatopec is not clear enough for finer Late Archaic subdivisions, such as
were identified by Prewitt (1981a, 1995) and discussed in Chapter 2, to be identified.
AU 2a encompasses Prewitt’s (1981a) Uvalde, Twin Sisters, and Driftwood phases.
Diagnostic point types including but not limited to Castroville, Marcos, and Montell
mark the early boundary, whereas Darl marks the late boundary.
Analytical Unit 2b
AU 2b (Figure 3-6) designates intact, Late Archaic I subperiod deposits. The Late
Archaic I subperiod in Central Texas is described as arid compared to the late Middle
Archaic Period and Late Archaic II subperiod (Johnson and Goode 1994). This analytical

unit includes Prewitt’s (1981a) Marshall Ford, Round Rock, and San Marcos phases,
and is defined by the appearance of Bulverde points at the early boundary and by
Marshall and Lange at the later end. It also includes Pedernales points and related
materials. Like the other, finer-resolution units, AU 2b can help analysts recognize local
or small-scale shifts in technology through part of the Late Archaic.
Analytical Unit 3
AU 3 (Figure 3-7) represents the Middle Archaic period (ca. 5800–4000 B.P.), and
is the smallest in terms of sample size; only a single unit-level contains recognizable,
diagnostic materials from this time period without also including signs of mixture or
disturbance. Clearly, this single unit-level does not adequately represent technological
trends that elsewhere characterize the entire Middle Archaic. Nevertheless, this unit is
helpful for investigating site formation processes.
Standardizing Artifact Recovery Across Analytical Units
Defining analytical units is a first step to analyzing the material remains from Zatopec.
These reconstructed site components provide the chronological control that allows
analysts to recognize significant changes in material culture from one time period to
the next. Depending on the kind of analysis performed, however, simply reconstructing
analytical units and counting the artifacts present in each may be inadequate, or even
inappropriate. When merely describing artifacts within an analytical unit, raw counts
are suitable. However, raw counts are misleading when comparing statistical trends
in technological behaviors across analytical units, or from one time period to the next.
When more than one analytical unit is present at a site, the counts of artifacts recovered
from each need to be somehow standardized before frequencies of different categories
can be meaningfully compared. Only when artifact recovery has been standardized can
changes in technological behaviors or adaptations can be quantified.
The analytical units defined at Zatopec comprise intact excavated proveniences
(called lots) that represent recognizable periods in the regional cultural chronology.
Based on available technological information, these lots appear to be unmixed and
undisturbed, and provide time-controlled contexts for describing technological shifts
from one period to another. However, not all analytical units represent the same
amount of time. Furthermore, important changes may have occurred in terms of how
long, intensively, or frequently the site was occupied during different time periods. All
these factors affect rates of artifact discard. In addition to these issues, which relate to
prehistoric activities at the site, it is possible for larger areas of a particular analytical
unit to be sampled through excavation, further altering patterns in artifact recovery.
In order to overcome these skewing factors, artifact recoveries from Zatopec were
standardized before any comparisons were made that evaluated trends for one time
period against another. During the course of analyses of Zatopec’s lithic assemblage (see

87

Figure 3-7. Spatial distribution of AU 3, intact Middle Archaic deposits. Fly-out indicates
stratigraphic extent of AU 3 deposits.

88

Chapter 7), raw counts were standardized according to the following formula:

FR /T
FS = ――
× 100,
V
where FS is the standardized frequency, FR is the raw frequency, T is the duration of
an analytical unit in years, and V is the excavated volume of matrix, in cubic meters,
representing an analytical unit. The product of raw count (FR) divided by time (T),
divided by volume (V), was multiplied by 100. The result (FS) represents the number of
artifacts from any particular category that were deposited on the site over an idealized
100-year period per cubic meter of excavated sediment. The number of artifacts-per-100years-per-cubic meter was found to be easier to work with than artifacts-per-decade-percubic meter, or even discard rates calculated at a yearly rate. The values for variables T
and V for each analytical unit are shown in Table 3-1.

As previously discussed, the age ranges for each analytical unit are based on
regional chronological syntheses that have been presented by Prewitt (1981a, 1983)
and by Johnson and Goode (1994). The excavated volume of matrix representing
each analytical unit was calculated by dividing the sum of all unit-levels in each
analytical unit by 10. For example, 25 excavated unit-levels were identified, each 10
cm in thickness and containing unmixed and undisturbed Toyah phase materials,
representing a total excavated volume of 2.5 m3 for AU 1a. Forty unit-levels were
identified for AU 1b, 59 for AU 2a, 36 for AU 2b, and only three for AU 3.
A hypothetical example shows the importance of standardizing artifact recovery
when considering diachronic patterns of artifact discard at a site. For the purpose
of illustration, if 100 of a particular type of artifact, such as a projectile point, were
recovered in each analytical unit at Zatopec, standardized counts (FS) would be as
shown in Table 3-2.

In this hypothetical example, it would be possible without standardizing projectile
point frequencies to conclude that site occupation, as well as any other activities
represented by projectile points, was nearly constant across the time periods
represented by each analytical unit. That is, each time period is represented by the
same number of artifacts (FR=100). However, in reality these recovery rates are far from
even, since each analytical unit actually represents a different number of years and is
also represented by a significantly different excavated sample.
Conclusions
One of the analytical goals for the current project involves not only describing patterned
recovery of artifacts for any given time period, but also recognizing behavioral changes
from one time period to the next. Accordingly, it was important to reconstruct analytical
units in a way that allows meaningful and accurate conclusions to be drawn without
also including proveniences that contain, or potentially contain, mixed or disturbed
deposits. In this sense, a conservative approach was adopted that focused only on those
lots that (1) could be dated and (2) could not be shown to be stratigraphically out of
place or to have been disturbed. As a result, a significant percentage of the excavated
assemblage from the site was excluded from detailed consideration, at least with respect
to evaluating changes from one time period to another.
Following the reconstruction of these analytical units, artifact frequencies were
standardized. Without having followed this procedure, numerical comparisons in terms
of frequency of any particular artifact category across multiple time periods would be
meaningless. After standardizing frequencies, however, several intriguing, and highly
significant, patterns can be demonstrated (see Chapters 7, 11)

Chapter IV
Geoarchaeology
Charles D. Frederick

The objective of the geoarchaeological work reported here was to identify the formation
processes associated with the Zatopec site and to assess its stratigraphic integrity.
Zatopec is situated adjacent to Purgatory Creek, which drains the local Central Texas
area west and northwest of San Marcos. The site lies at the confluence of Purgatory
Creek and two of its small, unnamed tributaries (Figure 4-1).
The northwestern edge of the site is bordered by the unnamed, southwest-flowing
tributary that drains the landscape south of Ranch Road 12, an area the City’s Planning
and Development Services Department refers to as Sector 2 (2004:15).
The second unnamed, low-order tributary borders the site on the southeast and is
shown on topographic maps of the area as flowing southwest and joining Purgatory
Creek immediately southwest of the site. The map of natural features in the City’s
Sector One Plan (Figure 4-2) shows this second small stream as part of the Purgatory
Creek floodway.
From a point immediately upstream from the site, Purgatory Creek takes on a
dendritic-like, anastamosed habit en route to its confluence with the San Marcos River.
One thread of the creek joins the river near Bicentennial Park, a few blocks east of
the Hays County Courthouse, whereas the second thread, probably the main course of
Willow Springs Creek, joins the river east of IH-35 at Highway 82, north of the A. E.
Wood Fish Hatchery. During periods of high discharge, Purgatory Creek flows into the
Willow Springs Creek channel just southwest of the end of Gravel Street. The excavated
part of the site is in neither the 100- nor the 500-year floodplain as currently defined,
but this aspect of the site’s environmental context may be the modern result of a flood
control dam constructed immediately upstream of the site. The Soil Conservation
Service constructed this dam on Purgatory Creek after San Marcos suffered a heavy

flood on May 15–16, 1970, when a rainfall of 7–18.5 inches fell in a 30-hour period
(Burnett 2008:193).
The bedrock geology in the area is complex since the site is situated in the Balcones
Fault Zone. The broad-scale geologic setting has been depicted by the Bureau of
Economic Geology (BEG) (1979), who mapped the bedrock here, as Edwards Group
limestone (likely the Kainer Formation; see Collins 2000, who subdivided the Edwards
Group immediately west of the site). Detailed maps of the complex faulting in this area
(Grimshaw 1976; Grimshaw and Woodruff 1986) suggest that the scale of the BEG
(1979) map may be too coarse to capture the geologic complexity in this area.
Much of the observed bedrock consists of soft marly limestone. The term marl, as
applied to central Texas limestones, particularly the Glen Rose Formation, has been

94

recently examined by Woodruff and Wilding (2008), who noted that, although it is
widely used, the term is imprecise. The Glen Rose typically exhibits a stair-stepped
topography widely attributed to alternating hard limestone and soft marly beds.
Woodruff and Wilding (2008) showed that the marly beds of the Glen Rose Formation in
fresh exposures are as indurated as the hard beds and that these two deposits actually
differ most in terms of clay content. It is likely that the differences in the regolith
(unconsolidated transported or residual material overlying bedrock) observed at the site,
which range from solid but solution-rounded limestone to powdery calcium carbonate
masses that typically would be called marl, originated with a similar weathering
process.
Site excavations were placed in a relatively flat area near the toe of a long
interfluvial ridge, only slightly elevated above the two unnamed drainages, that
terminates at the floodplain of Purgatory Creek. These excavations were in an area
that rises gently to the north and falls more steeply to the south and southeast and
superficially looks like an alluvial terrace. The actual geomorphic relationship of this
surface to the larger drainage situated to the west-southwest is difficult to assess, since
there has been a significant amount of earth-moving activity on and adjacent to this
channel, probably related to flood control structures (see discussion in Moreman et al.,
2002). This surface slopes down to the unnamed drainage that borders the site on the
southeast and to the south toward Purgatory Creek. A constructional alluvial surface
of Purgatory Creek lies at the toe of this slope, south of the excavations. This surface is
vegetated by juniper and has been scoured by overbank flows of Purgatory Creek. No
clear exposures of this deposit were visible at the time of fieldwork.
All exposures observed for this work were hand excavations opened by the
archaeological fieldwork. It would have been desirable to open more mechanical
excavations to the south in order to investigate the upslope changes in the soils and
sediments, but this was not possible.
Methods
Exposures examined for this work consisted of the walls of test units. Several exposures
exemplifying the variation of extant deposits were drawn, photographed, and sampled.
Field drawings were supplemented by photomosaics of the unit walls to portray more
accurately the stratigraphic distribution of the rocks present. A total of three test units
in the main area of the site (identified below as Profiles A, B and C) were described in
detail and sampled for additional analyses. A fourth profile (Profile D), approximately
1 m in height, from the area near the discovery of human burials, was sampled by CAS
personnel, and a suite of nine samples collected at 10-cm intervals were subsequently
described and analyzed in the lab.
Most column samples were collected in 5-cm increments from each of the described
profiles. These samples were subsequently analyzed for particle size (texture), calcium

95

carbonate content (CCE), and magnetic susceptibility. Approximately 51 bulk samples
were analyzed from four test units. The texture, calcium carbonate content, and
magnetic susceptibility of each sample were determined. A selected suite of samples
was also collected for thin-section preparation and soil micromorphological analysis
but none of these were processed for this report. Details of the analytical methods
employed are presented below, and the results of the lab work are presented later in
this chapter. Cultural material included in the samples taken from two profiles was
counted and weighed to facilitate an understanding of the taphonomic processes that
were instrumental in site formation.
Particle Size Analysis (Texture)
Texture analysis was performed using the hydrometer-sieve method (see ASTM
1985; Bouyoucos 1962; Gee and Bauder 1986). For this analysis the total sample was
air-dried and weighed, crushed with a rubber pestle and mortar, and passed through
a 2-mm sieve. Material caught on the 2-mm sieve, if detrital material, was then sieved
at a 1-phi interval and the mass on each sieve recorded. A split of the < 2-mm material
(roughly 40 grams) was then soaked in 50 ml of a 5-percent sodium hexametaphosphate
solution overnight, and then mixed in a mechanical mixer for 5 minutes before being
diluted to 1 liter with distilled water. This mixture was placed in a 1-liter settling jar,
mechanically agitated for 1 minute, and then set on a table, after which hydrometer
readings were made at different time intervals (specifically 1, 3.5, 15, 45, 300, and 1440
minutes). A control hydrometer and temperature reading on an empty jar containing
only distilled water and the sodium hexametaphosphate solution was made at intervals
throughout the analysis to permit calibration of the hydrometer. A small split of the <
2-mm soil was also oven-dried to determine the moisture content and correct the sample
mass used in the hydrometer analysis (hygroscopic moisture correction). After 24 hours,
the contents of the hydrometer jar were wet-sieved through a 37-micron sieve, and the
sand retained on the sieve was transferred to a beaker and oven-dried at 105˚C. After
drying, this sand was subsequently sieved at 0.5-phi intervals and the mass retained
on each sieve recorded. From these data the percentage of gravel, sand, silt and clay, as
well as various descriptive statistics were calculated for the grain size distribution using
a spreadsheet written by Paul Lehman.
Calcium Carbonate Content (CCE)
A 1.7-g split of the ground < 2-mm fraction of each soil sample was used to
determine the calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE) by means of a Chittick apparatus
(Dreimanis 1962; Machette 1986). This sample was finely ground (to pass a 0.075-mm
sieve), and then weighed, and placed into a small (250-ml) Erlenmeyer flask. Once
attached to the Chittick apparatus, the liquid level in the measuring burette was set
to -10 ml. The stopcock was then closed so that no gas could leave the system, and the
leveling bulb was dropped in order to establish a vacuum inside the sample chamber. At

96

this point the barometric pressure and temperature in the room were recorded. Then 10
ml of 50 percent hydrochloric acid (ca. 6 N HCl) was delivered to the sample flask, which
was agitated intermittently until the reaction had ceased (usually 1–2 minutes). At
this point, the leveling bulb was raised to the point necessary to equalize the elevation
of liquid inside with the liquid in the burette. The volume of gas evolved was then
measured and the calcium carbonate equivalent calculated.
Magnetic Susceptibility
The reversible, low-frequency mass magnetic susceptibility of the samples were
determined by filling a 1-inch plastic cube with air-dried < 2-mm material from each
sample. The samples were then weighed and the low-frequency magnetic susceptibility
was measured on a Bartington MS2 meter and MS2B sensor. Each value was measured
twice and the average values were used to calculate the reversible, low-frequency mass
-8

-1
susceptibility (c ) which are reported in SI units (10 m kg ). The precise methods and
lf
equations used may be found in Gale and Hoare (1991:222–226).
Field Observations and Laboratory Results
In the main site area the soils exhibited two distinct profiles: 1) those with prominent
rubified B horizons (such as Profiles A, and B; Table 4-1, 4-2) and 2) those in which the
A horizon rested directly on weathered bedrock or regolith (such as Profiles C and D;
Table 4-3. 4-4). It was hypothesized in the field that the soil profiles lacking the rubified
B horizons had undergone a phase of erosion that stripped the B horizon, but evidence
supporting this hypothesis was generally lacking.
Profile A (N1037, E993)
Profile A, located on the western side of the excavation adjacent to a large earth pile,
is typical of exposures that exhibited rubified B horizons in the site core. The soil profile
exhibited an A1-A2-Btk-Bk-Cr horizon sequence (Table 4-5). Two levels of burnt rock
appeared in this profile, one in the range of 15 to 30 cm, and a second between 40 and 60
cm (Figure 4-3). The A horizon was relatively leached of calcium carbonate, with calcium
carbonate equivalent values of 29–31 percent, and relatively high values of magnetic
susceptibility (213–250 SI units). The magnetic susceptibility appeared to correlate in
part with the visible cultural material in the sampled wall, with the upper component in
the A1 horizon having elevated low frequency magnetic susceptibility values, whereas
the deeper component showed little evidence of magnetic susceptibility enhancement.
The Btk horizon (zone 3) had a prominent 7.5 YR hue and significantly more clay than
the bounding horizons, a condition most clearly visible on the texture plot in Figure
4-3. At the base of the profile, the Cr horizon (zone 5), is clearly regolith. The horizon
contained more than 90 percent calcium carbonate and prominent unaltered fragments
of soft marl-like material. Some of the unaltered bedrock fragments were more lithified
than others and account for the increase in gravel near the base of the profile.

Yellowish red (5YR 4/6, m; 5YR 5/6, d) silty clay to clay, friable,
strong fine subangular blocky structure, abrupt wavy to irregular

filaments, many (20–30%) coarse fragments which are entirely small
rounded fragments of marl.

Yellow (10YR 7/6, m; 10YR 8/6, d) silty clay loam to clay loam, very
friable to friable, massive, 7–10% calcium carbonate filaments, 10–
15% rounded to irregular shaped white masses of calcium carbonate
(unweathered fragments of marl?).

The significantly leached A horizon, together with the clay bulge in the Btk horizon
imply that this is an old profile that has undergone a prolonged period of exposure.
There is no good supporting evidence that the fine earth deposits in this profile are
alluvial in nature other than the apparent stratigraphic separation between lenses of
concentrated burned rock visible in the unit walls.
Profile B (N1033, E1005)
This test unit was located on the east side of the excavated area and exhibited an
A-AB-Bk1-Bk2-Cr profile (Table 4-6, Figure 4-4). Cultural material was primarily
observed scattered between 15 and 40 cm in the AB and top of the Bk1 horizons. The A
horizon was partially leached of calcium carbonate, exhibiting values between 38 and
54 percent near the surface. The A horizon also had prominent magnetic susceptibility
enhancement and values abruptly diminished at the base of the AB horizon. As was the
case in Profile A, a strong inverted correlation occurred between the CCE and magnetic
susceptibility. Unlike Profile A, there was no clear increase in clay with depth, and the
granulometric results were fairly complacent (little variation with depth). The boundary
with the regolith at the base of the profile was abrupt and the Bk2 horizon, which rested
on the regolith, appeared to have been disturbed by bioturbation, possibly caused by
burrowing mammals.

completely disturbed by burrowing animals.

Profile C (N1033, E999)
Profile C was situated between Profiles A and B, and exhibited an A-AC-Cr horizon
profile (Table 4-7). The topsoil (A and AC horizons) rested directly on regolith at depths
ranging from 20 to 40 cm below the surface (Figure 4-5). All cultural material was present
in the A and AC horizons, and magnetic susceptibility enhancement was largely limited
to these zones as well. Magnetic susceptibility values dropped dramatically through the
Cr horizon. Like other profiles in the core of the site, the A horizon had been partially
leached of calcium carbonate, exhibiting values between 32 and 43 percent in the top
20 cm, whereas calcium carbonate within the regolith (or Cr horizon) increased from
66 to 99 percent. The texture of the deposits here was a relatively homogeneous silty
clay throughout, with the only significant deviation being within the Cr horizon, which
contained appreciably more gravels (hard, unweathered limestone). The Cr horizon also
preserved evidence of two slightly harder beds that had been dissolved in place.

Profile D (N1006, E996)
This exposure was sampled by CAS field crew and was located near the human
burials, downslope and to the southeast of the main excavation areas. The deposit here
appeared to be thicker and contained deeper cultural material, but a significant number
of large, rounded limestone boulders were also present. The thickness and depth of the
deposit, as well as its location closer to Purgatory Creek suggested that this could be an
alluvial deposit.
After laboratory analyses of samples from this unit were completed, this profile
does not have the same dramatic calcium carbonate profile of those in the main block
area (Figure 4-6). Calcium carbonate increases slightly with depth, 40–52 percent at
depths ranging between 30 and 90 cm, and the topsoil is only moderately leached (35–40
percent CCE). Magnetic susceptibility values are very high, exhibiting a gradual rather
than abrupt decrease at greater depths. A small peak observed in Level 3 could be
cultural, but most of the cultural material peaks either above or below this level. The
texture of this deposit is finer than most of the others but only slightly so (Figure 4-7).
With the exception of the uppermost sample and a single sample between 70 and 80 cm,
there is little textural variation in this profile. The top sample has slightly more sand
and silt than the underlying deposits, whereas the sample between 70 and 80 cm, in the
same zone as the lower cultural component, is coarser as a result of gravel. The cultural
material in the examined profile is clearly bimodal, with one peak in materials between
10 and 30 cm near the top of the profile and a second peak between 70 and 80 cm. There
is no clear magnetic susceptibility association with the lower component.
Discussion
Although the exposures within the main excavation area exhibited dramatically
different soil profiles, there are a few commonalities. First, the A horizons all appear
to have been partially leached of calcium carbonate. A cursory examination of central
Texas streams shows that leaching of calcium carbonate is not a common attribute
of deposits less than 5,000 years old. In young sedimentary deposits, the depth
distribution of calcium carbonate is largely determined by detrital variation, but, as the
deposit age increases, the stratigraphic distribution of calcium carbonate changes in
response to pedogenic dissolution and reprecipitation.

108

Figure 4-7. Plot of the mean particle size versus sorting (standard deviation) for all
samples examined during study. Note the relatively close correlation between the
different profiles. The two coarsest samples (Profiles A and C, top left corner of the plot)
are zones that contain hard limestone fragments in the regolith (Cr horizons).

For instance, at Fort Hood, Nordt (2004) documented the calcium carbonate
equivalent for four soil profiles formed in alluvial fill of different ages. The two youngest
deposits (Ford and West Range alluvia) do not show any significant leaching of the A
horizons. The Fort Hood (Early to Middle Holocene) and Jackson (Late Pleistocene)
alluvia both showed partially leached A horizons, with the Fort Hood exhibiting about
10 percent less calcium carbonate in the A horizon than in the core of the deposit, and
the Jackson being almost completely decalcified (5 percent in the A horizon as compared
to the core of the Bk, which contained approximately 50 percent).
A similar progression was demonstrated by Blum et al. (1994) for alluvial
chronosequences on the Pedernales River and the Colorado River. Although the deposits
of these two streams differed in terms of their detrital calcium carbonate content, the
leaching profiles showed similar trends. Deposits less than 5,000 years old exhibited
little leaching of the A horizon (< 5 percent difference from the parent material),
whereas sediment deposits in the early to middle Holocene and Late Pleistocene
exhibited significant leaching of the calcium carbonate (between 10 and15 percent
difference with respect to the parent material for Early Holocene to more than 30
percent for late Pleistocene deposits).
The early to middle Holocene alluvial deposit at 41KR621, the Gatlin Site on the

109

Guadalupe River at Kerrville, roughly equivalent in age to the Fort Hood alluvium,
also exhibited partial leaching of calcium carbonate in the A horizon. Frederick (2008)
documented four profiles within the Gatlin deposit, and the minimum calcium carbonate
equivalent values for the A horizons ranged from 16 to 30 percent, which represented
maximum leaching values between 22 and 32 percent with respect to the core of the
deposit.
By comparison, the three profiles in the main excavation area at Zatopec exhibited
minimum A horizon calcium carbonate equivalent values between 28 and 38 percent,
and potential leaching can be calculated for the two profiles that had B horizons,
suggesting that these profiles had been leached of 24 to 29 percent of their calcium
carbonate. Although these values are inconsistent with a late Holocene alluvial
deposit, they are consistent with early to middle Holocene alluvia in central Texas.
This consistency does not demonstrate that the fine-earth portions of the profiles are
alluvium, but since the cultural materials within these deposits are known to be of
late Holocene age, it suggests that the Zatopec deposits may have been buried by postdepositional bioturbation rather than alluviation.
A bioturbation burial model is supported by the similarity in texture of the A and Cr
horizons in some locations within the main site area (such as in Profile C), suggesting
that the A horizons could have formed from weathering of the limestone. Likewise,
all the top soils exhibit considerable magnetic susceptibility enhancement. There is
a poor correlation between the magnetic susceptibility and the cultural material at
depth, but an apparently strong correlation occurs between magnetic susceptibility and
organic enrichment, implying that the magnetic susceptibility enhancement of these
deposits may be due to pedogenesis rather than cultural activity. Like decalcification,
the pedogenic enhancement of magnetic susceptibility requires the passage of time.
Unfortunately, in Texas there are presently no useful models showing the rates at
which this process occurs.
Summary
At archaeological sites like Zatopec, the shallow burial of cultural material on a
relatively flat landform adjacent to a stream tends to promote the interpretation
that the fine-earth sediment surrounding cultural material is alluvium. Alluvial
environments are typically viewed as ideal for the burial and preservation of stratified
cultural remains. But a critical examination of the deposits exposed at Zatopec failed
to demonstrate clearly whether the deposits are alluvium or the product of in situ
weathering of limestone bedrock. All the deposits have been significantly altered by
pedogenesis, and no diagnostic features attributable to alluviation were present in any
of the exposed profiles.
Two profiles (A and C) exhibit evidence of apparently upland-like soils, with Cr
horizons at the base consisting of rotted limestone bedrock. A gradual change in calcium

110

carbonate content with depth and the relatively homogeneous texture throughout these
profiles suggest that they could be soil profiles formed from bedrock weathering. The
interface with the regolith (or Cr horizon) was often noted to have significant abrupt
topographic variation and in several places this appeared to be the result of bioturbation
of the soft regolith by either people or fossorial mammals.
The fact that some profiles exhibited prominent rubified Btk horizons, whereas
others exhibited A horizons resting on regolith was hypothesized in the field to be an
artifact of erosion, but later analysis found no supporting evidence. When the pedogenic
alteration of the deposits is considered in detail, the most likely mechanism of site
burial appears to have been post-depositional pedoturbation. The strongest support
for this conclusion is found when considering that these deposits have experienced
significant leaching of calcium carbonate and magnetic susceptibility enhancement,
typical of Early Holocene deposits, although the cultural material buried within the
profiles is of Late Holocene age. If these Late Holocene cultural deposits were buried
by Late Holocene alluvium, there should be little difference in the depth distribution
of calcium carbonate. It is possible that partially weathered slope-derived sediment
was deposited by slope wash (colluviation) but the deposits lack the significant coarse
fraction characteristic of colluvial deposits. The results of the geoarchaeological
analysis of data gathered during this investigation appear to support, albeit weakly, a
pedoturbation burial mechanism at the Zatopec site.

Features

and

Chronology

David M. Yelacic and Jon C. Lohse

Over the course of all the archaeological investigations at Zatopec, 27 cultural features
were recorded. These features were categorized by form and perceived function as
burned rock concentrations, storage/trash pits, hearth (pits), lithic concentrations,
postholes, and burials. To help ensure consistency, features recorded during SWT field
school and later CAS excavations were categorized using the same criteria. Five burned
rock concentrations, two storage/trash pits, four hearth pits, one lithic concentration,
and three sets of postholes (15 features altogether) were identified during field school
excavations. Descriptions of the features are based on Garber’s (1987) site report and on
field records. Interpretations of these features are those of the initial excavators.
In the CAS work, five burned rock concentrations, one storage/trash pit, two
hearths, two lithic concentrations, and two burial features (totaling three individuals)
were identified and excavated. Descriptions and interpretations of these 12 features are
based on field observations and subsequent laboratory analyses. After analysis, three of
the features excavated by CAS in 2007 were determined not to be cultural features but
instead to be soil disturbances created by animal burrows along the top of the soft marl
bedrock. Nonetheless, their descriptions are included here.
In general, the uneven depositional condition of the site (see Chapter 4) renders the
interpretation of many of these features questionable. Without doubt, some features do
reflect prehistoric activity related to human occupation, resource processing, and burial.
Others, however, should be viewed more cautiously, particularly those representing
stratigraphic intrusions from upper to lower elevations. Furthermore, because the site
contains an overall high volume of rocks, including natural gravels and fire-cracked
rocks, features described as burned rock concentrations that were recorded near the
modern ground surface have not been significantly integrated into broad interpretations

112

of prehistoric behaviors under investigation.
Features recorded during the SWT field school excavations were designated by
sequential numbers, starting with “1”. In order to avoid confusion, CAS excavations
designated features by sequential numbers beginning with “1” but with a numerical
prefix of “07-” to provide a clear distinction from features recorded in the earlier work.
In addition to descriptions, data about provenience, size, related artifacts and samples,
and associated analytical units (as applicable) are presented in tabular format. Features
recorded during field school excavations are presented first, followed by those from CAS
excavations. The locations of features are shown on the plan map of the site, Figure 2-4.
Field School Features
Burned Rock Concentrations (Features 1, 3, 5, 13, 16)
Burned rock concentrations, including both small burned rock middens as well as
concentrated clusters, were dense, relatively thin concentrations of burned and/or firecracked limestone accompanied by cultural material. Features 1, 3, 5, 13, and 16 are all
designated as burned rock concentrations of varying size.

Description

Level 1 of XU 1, a 2-x-2-m unit located at the southern edge of the field
school boundary, revealed a dense concentration of burned rock and firecracked rock. XU 1 was excavated in 1-x-1-m quadrants, and from Level 1 to
the middle of Level 3 (approximately 25 cmbs) across all quadrants, burned
and fire-cracked rock were found in abundance. The burned and fire-cracked
rock overlaid non-burned rock and weathered limestone bedrock (Figure
5-1). This deposit also contained a mixture of cultural remains including
fauna, lithic debitage, projectile points, and bifacial tools.
XUs 9, 10, 25, 26, and 27 were a series of trenches excavated off of XU 1
to the north, south, and west in order to delineate the horizontal extent of
Feature 1 (see Figure 5-1). Combined, XUs 1, 25, 26, and 27 formed a 12-m
trench running along an east-west axis. Horizontal boundaries of Feature 1
were never found.

Description

Feature 3 is a relatively thin layer of fire-cracked limestone rocks with
a high density of artifacts. The midden appears to be round or elliptical
in outline, and it is approximately eight meters in diameter. It is
stratigraphically located between overlying, relatively rock-free silty loam
and underlying sterile clay and bedrock. The feature was found in nine
2‑x‑2‑m units in the north portion of the field schools’ boundaries (Figure
5-2). Cultural material associated with the feature includes large quantities
of lithic debitage, projectile points, bifaces, scrapers, knife fragment, shell,
burned bone and fossilized coral. Diagnostic points recovered from Feature
3 suggest that the midden accumulated over a long period of time, Early
Archaic through Late Prehistoric. Carbon was observed but not collected
from XUs 11–13. A carbon sample was collected from the southwest
quadrant of XU 14.

unknown. Cultural materials associated with the feature include lithic
debitage, a core, fauna, a possible dart point fragment, shell, and a Clear
Fork gouge. No samples were taken from the feature. No diagnostic
projectile points were observed or recovered, but the presence of the dart
point fragment and Clear Fork gouge indicate an Archaic age.

Feature 2 was designated at the base of Level 8 (75–80 cmbs) in XU 7.
The feature was described as having a very distinct outline: the sediment
surrounding the feature was fractured limestone, including gravels as well
as probable fire-cracked rock; sediment inside of the feature was described
as black silt (Figure 5-3, 5-5). In XU 7 only a small amount of lithic debitage
was recovered in association with the feature. Feature 2 extended into XU
19 where it was observed from the base of Level 1, approximately 10 cmbs,
to the base of Level 5, approximately 50 cmbs. Cultural artifacts associated
with the feature in XU 19 were lithic debitage, bifaces, an Ensor point, and
other untyped dart point fragments. Rodent burrows were noted adjacent to
the feature.

Description

Feature 17 was described as a circular, basin-shaped pit containing gray
loam and intruding into a reddish clay (Figure 5-5). The reddish clay into
which the feature intrudes was interpreted as the floor, or occupational
surface associated with a series of postholes that together constitute Feature
9. Feature 17 is located within the arc of postholes, and at a similar depth
below surface. Cultural material associated with Feature 17 was lithic
debitage. No tools or fauna are noted as being associated with the feature.
The interpretation of this basin-shaped pit in association with the postholes
is that it once functioned as a storage pit and was later converted into a
trash pit.

Hearth Pits (Features 6, 7, 8, 10)
Several hearth pit features were observed as intrusions into Feature 3, the large
burned rock scatter that covers a large portion of the center of the site. These intrusions,
interpreted as hearth pit features, were noted based on the absence of burned rock.
Features 6, 7, 8, and 10 are all described as circular in plan, basin-shaped in profile,
and in-filled with dark, organic matrix. According to Garber (1987), these hearth
pits represent used (and unused) cooking features. Continual use and reuse of these
features is thought to have generated much of the burned and fire-cracked rock that
constitute Feature 3. This interpretation corresponds with Kelley and Campbell’s (1942)
“overlapping hearth hypothesis.”

cobbles (N ≈ 350), and also was associated with a large amount of cortical
lithic debitage. Other cultural materials recovered included a chopper, a
scraper, projectile point fragments, fauna, a hammerstone, a grinding stone,
and a biface. The tools, cores, and other artifacts were found concentrated
at the top of the feature. The upper boundary of the feature was dark brown
silty loam, and the lower boundary was a “natural layer” of cherty cobbles.

Postholes (Features 9, 14, and 19)
A number of small, circular, mostly rock-free features were recorded and interpreted
as postholes for an oval-shaped prehistoric structure. Evidence for structures in Central
Texas is extremely rare for numerous reasons, and the features recorded at Zatopec
are perhaps among the best evidence of large structures currently available. As all
construction materials would have been perishable, poor preservation conditions have
undoubtedly obscured or altogether removed most evidence of other examples. of these
constructions. Other factors contributing to the lack of evidence for structures include
bioturbation from animal burrows and tree root growth, both of which can cause more
or less circular intrusions in archaeological strata and both of which were numerous in
CAS excavations at Zatopec.
In particular, the arc of postholes labeled as Feature 9 presented some of the most
important data supporting the additional mitigation of Zatopec. Field school maps
showing posthole locations were compiled and then flipped in mirror image to project
the predicted locations of additional postholes. CAS excavations that began in 2007 were
designed in part to locate these features.

Description

Feature 9 was designated to encompass an arc of postholes (n = 14),
designated A–N, varying in diameter from 9 cm to 27 cm, and in depth from
4 cm to 28 cm (Figure 5-6). Postholes were observed as circular areas of
contrasting sediment—reddish-brown clay surrounding dark brown matrix.
XU 52 contained one posthole (A), XU 51 contained two postholes (B and
C), XU 48 contained four postholes (D, E, F, and G), XU 49 contained four
postholes (H, I, J, and K), XU 53 contained one posthole (L), and XU 56
contained two postholes (M and N). If the postholes found were to continue
in a symmetrical pattern, the feature would be greater than 10 m in
diameter. When cross-sectioned, postholes were basin-shaped in profile and
contained cultural material. Feature 9 included not only the postholes but
a zone of reddish clay which was interpreted as a floor. Cultural materials
recovered from the excavation of the feature included projectile points
(however, no projectile points are clearly associated with the feature in field
documentation) and other stone tools. Carbon samples were collected from
the feature and were sent for analysis before 1987. These samples were
determined to be of modern age and were attributed to brush-burning in the
general vicinity of the site.

and located centrally among the postholes. Lithic debitage, faunal remains,
and a uniface were associated with Feature 19.
The function of this centrally located pit is not clear, although it may once
have provided support for a central, upright post (see Figure 5-6).

CAS Excavations
Burned Rock Concentrations (Features 07-11, 07-12, 07-13, 07-14, 07-15)
Throughout the CAS excavations beginning in 2007, layers of burned and unburned
rock were encountered in each excavation test unit. Prehistoric artifacts were present
through the excavations, and some historic (modern) debris was present in higher
elevations, reflecting minor to moderate disturbance of upper site levels. Within this
general field of rock, numerous apparent concentrations were identified. These often
lacked discernable shape, but were interpreted as possible features. All of the burned
rock concentrations discussed below were discovered during the mechanical scraping of
the site area. Burned rock clusters encountered during excavation were interpreted as
hearths or other kinds of features.

Feature 07-11 was discovered when the northern portion of the site was

a concentration of seven large rocks arranged around a cluster of several
smaller, fire-cracked rocks (Figure 5-7). Two control points were established
with the Total Data Station (TDS) to plot the location of the feature on the
site grid and also to create a line for bisection. The feature was illustrated
in plan view, and then profiled. The excavation of the profile trench
produced three carbon samples (1158-1, 1158-2, 1158-3), and revealed that
this concentration of rocks had a slight basin shape that intruded into
the underlying sterile alluvial deposit. All sediment that was excavated
went through a 1/4-in-mesh screen. Lithic debitage, faunal debris, historic
artifacts and point fragments were all recovered from the sediment of the
feature.

Description

Feature 07-12 was discovered when the northern portion of the site was

to be one feature, but on inspection, Feature 07-12 was recognized as a
distinct and separate, amorphous formation composed of eight large burned
rocks (Figure 5-8). The feature was then drawn in plan view and a profile
trench was dug along the bisecting line into the marl bedrock 47 cm below
the machine-scraped surface. Excavation of the profile trench revealed a 14
cm thick, poorly defined cultural deposit on top of a gravelly alluvial deposit.
Artifact counts and variety decreased with depth and tapered off in the
top of the alluvial deposit. All sediment was passed through a 1/4-in-mesh
screen, and lithic debitage, faunal debris, freshwater mussel shell and a
large biface were recovered.

Feature 07-13, discovered through mechanical excavation, was a linear
concentration of large rocks in apparently undisturbed sediment (Figure
5-9). Overburden to the southeast of the potential feature was removed in
order to fully expose the feature, but a distinct boundary was never found.
All excavated sediment went through a 1/4-in-mesh screen. Two control
points were established by TDS to establish a bisecting line and plot the
feature’s coordinates on the site grid. The feature was drawn in plan view,
and a profile trench was dug along the bisecting line into the underlying,
gravelly, sterile alluvial deposit about 35 cm below the surface. The profile
trench revealed significant burrowing, but lithic debitage, a projectile point
(1159-4), and two bifaces (1159-2, 1159-3) were recovered. The artifacts were
in heavily disturbed sediment mottled with gravel, calcite, and very soft/
loose sediment.

Feature 07-14 was discovered during the mechanical scraping of the site.
Scraping exposed one very large (> 30-cm diameter) rock surrounded by a
relatively thin lens of smaller rocks and gravel. Clearing by hand revealed
other similarly large rocks arranged loosely around an area approximately 1
m in diameter (Figure 5-10). Control points were established and the feature
was bisected. The cluster was drawn in plan view, and then a profile trench
was excavated. The profile trench was excavated approximately 25 cm, into
a gravelly, sterile alluvial deposit. The overlying cultural deposit was 12 cm
at its thickest point from the machine-scraped surface (109.48 m), and had
only lithic debitage associated with it. The rocks which defined this feature
were dispersed evenly and amorphously throughout this cultural stratum.

and faunal remains were collected. Two control points were established,
the feature was drawn in plan view, and then profiled in cross section. The
cross-sectioned trench was excavated into the underlying sterile alluvial
deposit, about 28 cm below the mechanically scraped surface. Overlying
cultural stratum was 22 cm at its thickest point, and the sediment
excavated in the profile trench contained two bifaces (1168-1, 1168-6); two
projectile points, one untypable (1168-4); and two carbon samples were
recovered (1168-3, 1168-5) along with lithic debitage and faunal remains.
The profile trench exposed two amorphous vertical concentrations of rocks,
corresponding with the large rock and the tight cluster to its south.

Description

Feature 07-2 was a concentration of several large, articulated stone slabs
and fire-cracked rocks. These rocks were arranged in a semi-circular shape
and were flanked by reworked and redeposited, burned marl (Figure 5-12).
Excavation of this feature yielded a carbon sample (1041-1), a large flake
tool (1041-2), and a possible hammerstone. The feature is vaguely basinshaped in cross-section. A layer of hardened, burned marl was formed
through the heat from this feature when it was in use, and this surface
defined the basal elevation for the large slabs. Sediment directly associated
with the feature was collected as three bulk sediment samples: 1111-1 was
collected from the sediment underlying and surrounding the rocks, 1111-2
was also collected from sediment underlying and surrounding the rocks, and
1111-3 was collected from pedestals; those results are included in Appendix
K, but identified taxa include acorn, hackberry, persimmon or hickory, and
a monocot stem, which can sometimes be used for making perishable goods
such as sandals, mats, or cordage (see Chapter 10). Based on these results,
we interpret this feature as a domestic fireplace, perhaps associated with
cooking fruits and nuts, but also around which domestic activities involving
the processing of resources for utilitarian use were carried out. Feature 07-2
extended into adjacent units to the north, northwest, and west that were
excavated as part of the field schools during the 1980s. Level forms from
these units do not indicate that the hearth was recognized or recorded.

Description

Feature 07-3 was a small concentration of burned and fire-cracked rocks
(> 10 cm dia.), including two articulated fragments from the same rock
burned in situ, located in the center of the same unit as and immediately
beneath Feature 07-2 (Figure 5-13). This feature was considerably smaller
than the overlying hearth, and showed a relatively flat bottom. Excavations
to a depth of 109.60 m yielded no directly associated artifacts. The feature
was bisected to delineate the profile shape; the bisection produced one
charcoal sample from the northeast edge of the feature at a depth of 109.59
m, and one bulk sediment sample (1108-2) was collected. Archaeobotanical
analysis of the matrix associated with the feature identified acorn meat
and uncarbonized hackberry (see Appendix K), suggesting that its use was
highly similar to that of Feature 07-2.

Description

Feature 07-4 was defined by a circular, relatively rock-free zone in the
burned rock scatter located in the northwest part of the site (Figure 5-14).
Feature 07-4 was bisected, and the excavated portion of the feature produced
lithic debitage, fauna, a large mussel shell fragment, a biface (1064-7), a core
(1064-4), and five charcoal samples (1064-1 -3, 1064-5, 1070-1). The feature
extended approximately 12 cm in depth. Two carbon samples, 1064-1 and
1070-1, were collected from consecutive levels (with depths approximately
5–8 cm apart) and submitted. They returned almost identical dates of ca.
A.D. 880–1020 and A.D. 900–1030, respectively (see below). Sediment
excavated in the bisection of the feature was collected in two bags (10646) and submitted for archaeobotanical analyses. Uncarbonized hackberry,
monocot stem, and unknown seeds of unknown species were identified (see
Appendix K), suggesting a similar though less clearly defined use as Feature
07-2. The feature extended into the top 1–2 cm of Level 5

Description

A biface (1109-3), four flakes, three tested cobbles, and a chert cobble formed
an amorphous concentration in the southeastern half of the unit at a depth
of 109.92 m (Figure 5-15). Three flakes, a carbon sample (1009-4), and a
possible manuport (1009-1; see Chapter 7, Figure 7-86) were recorded while
excavating down to the feature. Feature 07-1 was located stratigraphically
near a transition from the overlying friable silty loam covering the site to
the underlying, softer yellowish brown silty loam. An Ensor point fragment
(1009-5) and fauna were also recovered from this level.
Horizontally, the exposed portion of the feature was confined to an area
less than a meter in diameter, and the artifacts were all located within a
relatively shallow depth range. Based on these observations, excavators
believe the feature depth represents an ancient living surface. The lithic
material, representing several stages in the lithic reduction process, on top
of this past surface is interpreted as a knapping cluster.

Description

Feature 07-7 was designated as a group of three very thin, expanding billet
flakes and a fragment of animal long bone that were found in close proximity
to each other (ca. 10 cm in diameter). It was initially thought that the long
bone fragment could have been used for removing flakes, perhaps as a billet,
although this possibility is admittedly speculative. Upon inspection in the
lab, the bone showed no signs of use or modification. This small cluster of
artifacts was found within 50 cm of a large, possible abrading stone, and the
initial observation and interpretation was that this feature was a knapping
cluster.

Burials
During the 2007 excavations, three human interments were encountered, recorded,
and removed from the cluster of units in the southern part of the site area (Figure
5-16; see Figure 5-1). Stratigraphically, Burial 1 is at a slightly lower elevation than
2 and 3, and is interpreted as representing a distinct burial event. Burials 2 was
interred directly on top of Burial 3, but it is not known whether the burials occurred
simultaneously or in two separate events. Regardless of their order and sequence, all
three burials date to 1215–1305 radiocarbon years B.P., or ca. A.D. 662–884 (outside
two sigma ranges for all three dates), and differences in the absolute ages of Burials
2 and 3 suggest that they represent two distinct events (see below). Burial 1 was
documented as Feature 07-9. Burials 2 and 3 were excavated together and recorded as
Feature 07-10. Contextual and other data from the features themselves are presented
below, and the absolute ages of these interments, are presented later in this chapter.
Results of the bioarchaeological analysis of these burials are presented in Chapter 8.

Description

The left calcaneus of a male, 30-50 years of age and 65-69 inches tall (see
Chapter 8) was found in level 7 (108.50-108.40 m) of unit N1006 E996. A
matching left tibia was soon noted extending into the unit’s east wall and
floor. Once these were confirmed as human, they were covered with plastic
and dirt, the bottom of the unit was filled, and a steel plate was placed over
the unit while Section 106 consultation was conducted.
When work resumed, unit N1006, 997 and a second unit offset to the eastnortheast N1006.30, E998, were excavated to 30 cm above the expected top
of the burial. In level 4 of both units, a dense concentration of rocks was
exposed that is believed to have been a loose cairn (Figure 5-17). During
excavation of the possible cairn, a canine mandible fragment (1154-1) and an
untyped point fragment (1154-3) were collected from level 5.
From level 6 onwards in each unit, additional skeletal elements were
exposed. Sediments contained lithic debitage and faunal remains, and were
darker, less compact, and had little gravel compared with the gravelly
sediment with calcite inclusions that characterized the surrounding matrix.
At the base of Level 6, most of the burial was exposed as a single individual
in a flexed position, lying on his right side facing north with his head
pointing east-southeast, and his arms crossed at the wrists with his hands
up near his face (see Figure 5-16).
The burial itself was excavated mostly from Level 7 of unit N1006 E997. As
each bone was exposed, measured, and mapped, it was carefully removed
and placed in a foil packet labeled with its provenience. All foil packets
were placed in a box and brought back to the locked, secure human remains
storage room at CAS.
All together, six carbon samples (1156-1, 1156-2, 1156-3, 1156-4, 115613, 1156-15), four sediment samples of the matrix surrounding the bones
(1156-8, 1156-10, 1156-11 & 1156-16), fauna, lithic debitage, two bifaces
(1156-7, 1156-12), and a quartzite pebble (1156-5) were directly associated
with Feature 07-9 in level 7. After exposing and removing the entire burial,
underlying sediment was collected as a bulk sediment sample (1156-16;
see Chapter 10 for results of archaeobotanical analyses from this sample).
Two carbon samples (1156-13 and 1156-15) taken from directly beneath the
burial were submitted for dating, as was a third sample (1071-3) collected
from the unit profile as close as possible to the burial. These three samples
returned dates of 2290, 1250, and 1210 BP, respectively, meaning that
none of them could be used as a reliable indication of the true age of this
interment. A small sample of the right talus bone was instead submitted for
dating, and this returned an age of 1300 BP, ca. AD 662-732 (see below).
Upon completion of this excavation, it was evident that the burial had been
placed into a shallow pit that was excavated into the top of the soft marl
bedrock. After the individual was placed into the pit, it appears to have
been filled with earth gathered from nearby; this earth contained abundant
archaeological materials and remains reflecting the dispersed residential
midden-like nature of the site. A loose pile of large stones was then placed
over the grave. It is possible that additional offerings accompanied the
interment, including the canine mandible and a grooved purple quartzite
cobble (see Figure 7-78). However, these items are identified as possible
offerings based solely on their unusual or unique character and their general
proximity to the feature; no associated items can be identified with total
confidence.

Description

After Feature 07-9 had been excavated, mechanical scraping was conducted
within the vicinity in order to expose other possible burials. Approximately
one meter southeast of Feature 07-9, cranial fragments were exposed in
profile approximately 55 cm below the surface (Figure 5-18). A search of the
backdirt pile where these sediments had been deposited produced additional
cranial and mandibular fragments as well as a maxilla and teeth. Two
adjacent units, Unit N1005, E996.4 and Unit N1005, E997.4, were set up to
expose the rest of Burial 2. Unit N1005, E997.4 included the mechanically
scraped slope with the in-situ cranium remnant at approximately 55 cm
below the natural surface. In Level 5 of both units, rocks became densely
concentrated at approximately 108.67 m, and the units were plan-mapped at

139
this depth. As excavations proceeded, it soon became evident that these units
contained the remains of two individuals. Elements from Burial 2 were found
lying directly on top of those of Burial 3, and in many places the two burials
were stratigraphically indistinguishable. The Burial 2 cranium had been
largely removed during mechanical scraping and the cranium for Burial 3 had
become dislodged at some point in the past, possibly during the interment
of Burial 2, yet both Burials 2 and 3 contained a significant majority of their
elements and were fairly well articulated though highly weathered.
Burial 2 was interred in a loosely flexed position on its left side facing
south. Its cranium was originally located to the southeast of the pelvis. This
individual, a 20- to 25-year-old female measuring 59–63 inches in stature,
was interred with her legs bent back behind her, so that her feet were
positioned near her pelvis, lying on her left side with her face looking south
and her knees pointing west (see Figure 5-16). Her arms, which were not
well preserved, were apparently crossed near her upper torso.
Burial 3, a 25- to 45-year-old female (stature undetermined), was also on
her left side, facing south, but was tightly flexed with arms and legs close
to her chest. As mentioned, the skull of Burial 3 had been disarticulated at
some time, but was found intact, upside down, to the northeast of the torso.
The feet of this individual were also disarticulated, and the distal ends of
the fibulae and tibiae were highly weathered. The condition and position of
this burial suggests that this individual may have been tightly wrapped in a
bundle and brought on site for burial.
Unlike Burial 1, no obvious cairn or other covering was placed over Burials
2 and 3. The base elevation for Burial 3 was approximately 17 cm higher
than the bottom of the shallow depression associated with Burial 1, and it
appears from excavation records and in-field observations that Burial 1 was
interred in a shallow pit dug into the surface of the same depositional unit
that Burials 2 and 3 were placed upon.
Between elevations of approximately 108.60 and 108.34 m, a total of 13
carbon samples, five pieces of modified freshwater mussel shell, 13 crawfish
pinchers (some burned), one projectile point fragment, three bifaces, two
river pebbles, one turtle carapace fragment, and a possible stone bead
fragment were recovered (Figure 5-19). The modified mussel shells were
nearly identical, trapezoidal-shaped ornaments with two holes drilled on the
narrower end. It was not obvious which burial these were associated with,
although they were found closer to Burial 3 than to Burial 2. The crawfish
pinchers were all distal fragments varying in length up to 1.5 cm long; some
were burned, and all are interpreted as grave offerings since no similar
faunal remains were recovered from anywhere on the site. The river pebbles
were small, less than 2 cm in diameter, and appear to have derived from
a parent material different from other rocks and gravels near the feature.
The projectile point was the proximal fragment of Pedernales type, and was
found close to the right foot of Burial 2.
This type, belonging to early part of the Late Archaic period, is inconsistent
with the dates of the burials. It is unclear whether the point fragment had
been included in a load of sediment gathered from elsewhere on site for the
purpose of covering the individuals in the same manner as described for
Burial 1, or whether it had been a cultural heirloom associated with one
of these women, or whether it had been manufactured for use during the
lifetime of these individuals (representing an idiosyncratic and unrelated
extension of a tool form generally resembling points to which archaeologists
have assigned the Pedernales name) and had intentionally been included as
an offering. In general, aside from the modified freshwater mussel shell, it is
uncertain whether or not any of the associated materials were intentionally
placed with the burials as offerings.

Non-cultural Features (Burrows)
Three contexts were identified as features in the field and excavated under highly
controlled conditions, including sampling, bulk sediment recovery, and submission
of samples for radiocarbon dating. During the analysis, including radiocarbon in one
case, it was realized that these contexts were not features, but instead were examples
of natural disturbances including but not necessarily limited to animal burrowing. No
occupied burrows were discovered during excavation. However, several active or recent
burrows were seen in different parts of the site area, indicating that animal burrowing
was a prevalent, even ongoing issue impacting site preservation.

Feature 07-5 was first recognized as circular, dark stains in the northwest
and southwest corners of Unit N1033 E1005. Two charcoal samples, lithic
debitage, faunal remains, and a Bandy projectile point were associated
with the top of the feature. As excavation continued, a distinct, linear, N-S
trending interface between soft silty loam (in the W half of the unit where
the stains were present) and marl was encountered (Figure 5-20). Cultural
material, including an Ensor projectile point and four carbon samples, were
recovered from lower levels. Two bulk sediment samples were collected.
The boundary between the soft marl bedrock and the sediment with stains
and cultural material was sharp and clear. At first, this was interpreted as a
cultural cut into bedrock. Later, inverted diagnostic projectile points (Bandy
above Ensor in elevation) and 14C results (see below) suggested it was a
disturbance. Finally, mechanical scraping performed in the last aspect of
fieldwork revealed a large, complex burrow in this location.

Description

Feature 07-6 appeared in the center of the southern boundary of Unit
N1033, E1003 in Level 4 at an approximate depth of 109.86 m. It was
found underneath two flakes and a large cobble, 20 cm west of Feature
07-7. Feature 07-6 was initially defined as being two discolored “stains”
of darker sediment: one in the southern boundary of the unit, and the
other in the southwestern corner (Figure 5-21). Following the original
interpretations for this site as having a well-defined living surface and even
postholes for a circular or apsidal structure, CAS excavators were cautious
about identifying features that might represent additional postholes. Both
stains were bisected when the adjacent unit to the south, Unit N1032,
E1003, was excavated but profile views appeared amorphous and poorly
defined. The stains were sampled separately with specimen numbers given
to each: 1098-1 was fill from the larger, centrally located stain (visible in

143
Figure 5-21), and 1098-2 was the fill of the smaller stain in the southwest
corner (not illustrated). Density of cultural material associated with the
stains decreased with depth. After excavations had been completed, closer
examination of the profile view showed how what appeared to be separate,
individual stains exposed in plan at 109.80 m elevation actually connected
at lower depths. Indeed, to the right of the dashed white line outlining the
initial boundary of Feature 07-6, a third apparent depression in the soft
marl bedrock is visible.
Upon analysis, this feature was interpreted as a burrow, not a pit or
posthole. Evidence against its identification as a feature include its
amorphous shape in profile, the wavy contact on top of the soft marl bedrock
that clearly connects multiple possible “pits,” and the abundant burrowing
near this part of the site.

Description

Feature 07-8 first appeared in the northwest corner of Unit N1028, E1005
in Level 6 (109.50–109.40 m) as a small cluster of burned rocks surrounded
by reddish-yellow sediment intruding into the marl bedrock (Figure 5-22). In
Level 7, the feature spread into the adjacent unit to the north, Unit N1029,
E1005. The intrusive rocks and sediment continued through Level 7 and into
Level 8 of both units. In Level 8, the feature ended at the marl bedrock. Two
sediment samples and five carbon samples were collected from the feature
throughout excavation. No other cultural material was associated with
Feature 07-8.
After excavation and analyses were completed, what had been recorded as
a possible intrusion into the soft marl bedrock was reclassified as another
example of burrowing at the site. In this case, the apparent intrusion lacked
any clearly defined shape or form, the cluster of rocks (visible in Figure 5-22)
could not be identified as burned and fire cracked with complete certainty,
and no obvious outline of the feature was visible in plan view. In this and
the preceding two cases, rodents appear to have targeted the soft interface
between the marl bedrock and the overlying sediments, easily burrowing
into the marl and introducing cultural material from upper or lower
elevations.

Chronology
Multiple lines of evidence were used to reconstruct the occupational chronology at
Zatopec, and results are characterized by different degrees of precision and certainty.
Two dating techniques were used: cross-dating through use of temporally diagnostic
artifacts or artifact technologies that have been well-dated elsewhere and absolute
dating through use of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon analysis of
organic remains. Each technique has strengths and weaknesses. Considered separately,
each conveys a different view of the occupation history at Zatopec.
Radiocarbon data can produce conflicting results, depending for example on
sampling procedures, thereby leading to different interpretations about site chronology.
Therefore a detailed narrative discussion about the radiocarbon sample selections,
supplemented by information about context and association, provided in table form,
is provided below in order to make best use of the results obtained through absolute
dating techniques.
By cross-dating diagnostic artifact types (including styles of projectile points and
ceramics known to have been manufactured at specific times in the past) with Zatopec
archaeological deposits containing those same artifact types, it can be determined that
the range of occupation at this site spanned, at minimum, the Early Archaic period (ca.
7,000 B.P.) through the early Spanish colonial era.(Table 5-1). However, when

combined with stratigraphic data, it is clear that isolable, discrete components
representing all of these time periods are not present at Zatopec (see Chapters 3, 4).
Instead, for the purpose of analyzing moderately robust assemblages from temporallycontrolled deposits, the site is best represented by Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric
periods. This conclusion is also supported by results of the radiocarbon dating, which
are discussed in more detail later in this chapter. Ceramic data are presented in
Chapter 6, and lithic technology data are discussed in Chapter 7.

Radiocarbon Dating
A total of 26 radiocarbon dates were processed. One assay from earlier seasons
returned a modern date indicating recent disturbance and is not referenced here.
Samples were submitted on four occasions. During the project-planning phase, TxDOT
agreed to pay for the radiocarbon dating analyses for the part of the project that would
be carried out in compliance with Section 106 requirements. Additional radiocarbon
dating tests conducted in compliance with the City’s obligations under the Native
American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) were funded by the
City. Samples were submitted to TxDOT on two occasions under their contract with
Beta Analytic Lab in Miami, Florida, and on a third occasion through TxDOT to the
University of Georgia Laboratory. A final batch of samples collected for the purpose of
providing direct dates of the three burials was submitted to the Paleo Research Institute
(PRI) in Colorado (Table 5-2).
As samples were submitted to the various radiocarbon laboratories, the labs
returned corrected age estimates and associated standard deviation (sigma) for each
assay. Since each lab adheres to its individual processing protocol, the results from
different labs are expressed with different error ranges and these differences may affect
the precision and comparability of the different suites of dates presented here. To help
evaluate the data, each assay was calibrated, or converted to calendar ages, at CAS
using the latest version (4.1.5) of the online calibration program OxCal (Bronk Ramsey
2009). In the time since samples were submitted for processing, a new calibration curve
(IntCal09) has been published (Reimer et al. 2009) that tightens the calibration for
many dates and extends the calibration curve back to approximately 50,000 years ago.
Although extending the calibration curve this far back into the past is not relevant to
this project, the improved accuracy and precision of the calibrated dates does allow
archaeologists to discuss the site’s prehistoric record at new and improved levels of
detail.
In spite of these significant improvements, parts of the calibration curve remain
uneven and mildly problematic, introducing some imprecision or uncertainty about
calibrated dates. Specifically, where the curve reverses itself, calibrated dates have
multiple distributions. This problem can be seen in Events 2 and 4 in the Late Archaic
II/Austin component and in Event 2 in the Toyah component (see below). Furthermore,
where the calibration curve is flat (or plateaus), calibrated dates have long, continuous
distributions (such as Event 3 in the Late Archaic II/Austin component; see below),
meaning that cultural reconstructions based on radiocarbon data lack the precision that
other time periods have when the curve maintains a relatively straight angle of decline.

Future archaeologist will need to keep these problems in mind when seeking to
refine local cultural chronologies through the use of calibrated dates. To some degree,
these issues can be addressed by averaging dates of cultural deposits or events
identified as contemporaneous. In any case, they should not deter Central Texas
archaeologists from seeking ways to maximize the usefulness of radiocarbon data,
especially from sites with many samples of radiocarbon data.
Radiocarbon dates are discussed below in corrected radiocarbon years before present
(B.P.), as returned by the different labs, and as calibrated calendar ages at two standard
deviations, or sigmas (95.4 percent confidence level), with probabilities for each
distribution as confidence level percentages (also shown in Table 5-2). Readers wishing
to assess these dates in calibrated years B.P., a common convention for discussing
radiocarbon data, may subtract the date range given in calibrated years from 1950 (e.g.,
Beta-235075 is A.D. 987–1017, or 963–933 cal B.P.).
Sample Selection and Discussion
Each batch of samples submitted was intended to address a particular set of issues
with the larger objective of contributing to the overall understanding of the Zatopec
occupational history as research progressed. The first batch was selected to provide key
contextual information about specific features and depositional histories and processes.
The second submission, intended to date Burial 1 as precisely as possible, included two
samples directly associated with the burial and two taken from the profile of the unit
wall profile for the purpose of contextualizing the depositional sequence near the burial.
Because Zatopec covers a moderately large area, with units located at considerable
distance from one another, an important part of the sample selection process for the
first batch was to submit groups of paired samples taken from different depths within
a single stratigraphic context, such as a discrete deposit or feature. Submitting paired
samples, or couplets, in this fashion allows analysts to determine whether key contexts
are stratigraphically well-ordered or disturbed, since each of the paired assays provides
a “check” on the other. Without this kind of corroborating data, it may remain unknown
whether a date derived from a single sample is reliable, even if the sample has been
taken from what is considered to be a secure context. Rather than submitting multiple
single assays and evaluating the aggregate results to determine which parts of the
site are well-ordered and which parts are disturbed, pairing the samples in this way
provides critical stratigraphic information about the structure of deposits at Zatopec
and their suitability for the purposes of analyses.
Together, results from the first two batches help illustrate processes by which
cultural materials were deposited across the site. Two samples taken from different
levels in Feature 07-4 (Beta-235074 from Level 4 and Beta-235075 from Level 5)
returned essentially identical dates, corroborating the field interpretation of this as an
intrusive cultural feature representing a single event. Two additional samples (Beta-

151

235076 and Beta-235077) were submitted from Level 11 of what had during fieldwork
been designated Feature 07-5. These samples returned dramatically different dates,
and support the conclusion that this postulated pit was actually an animal burrow (see
above).
A third pair of samples (Beta-235078 and Beta-235079) was selected from Levels 3
and 5 of an area of dense fire-cracked rock (FCR) accumulation in Unit N1028 E1005.
The upper sample (Beta-235078, 1990 B.P.) was collected from the top of this FCR zone,
and the lower sample (Beta-235079, 1180 B.P.) was taken from the bottom boundary
of the zone. These dates are inverted, with the lower date later than the upper one (see
Table 5-2). Based on these results, the deposit of FCR in this part of the site appears to
have formed over as much as 700 years or more, and involved redeposition and mixing
of extant deposits. A final sample included in this batch (Beta-235073) produced a
modern date, reflecting recent burning activity at the site.
Results of the second batch of samples provide information about the estimated age
of Burial 1. They also illustrate potential problems with dating these kinds of deposits
using associated carbon samples, even if they were taken directly from unit profiles
rather than by direct means. In the absence of additional data, sample Beta-235080, the
closest available sample that had been collected by the time the sample was submitted,
provides a date of 1210 B.P. (A.D. 776–872) for Burial 1. It is corroborated by the nearly
identical date from Beta-237759 (1250 B.P., A.D. 692–748 and A.D. 764–778), which
derives from carbon collected from immediately below and in contact with the skull
of Burial 1. However, neither date can be reconciled with the second date produced
by a sample collected from below the burial from a location in direct contact with and
underneath the right femur (Beta-237758, 2290 B.P., 396–374 B.C.). As discussed
previously, the latter two dates are believed to have come from carbon already present
on-site that was contained in material transported to the location of the burial and used
to cover it. In spite of the two concurring dates, without direct corroborating evidence,
it remains unclear precisely when Burial 1 occurred. Two samples taken directly from
the nearby unit profile (Beta-237756 and Beta-237757) were inverted and failed to
clarify the archaeological age of the burial. Beta-237756 (2030 B.P., 50 B.C. to A.D. 2)
was collected at 108.56 m elevation, approximately the upper elevation of Burial 1, and
Beta-237757 (1090 B.P., A.D. 897–920 and A.D. 944–989) was collected from 108.32 m
elevation, approximately matching the depth of the burial (though still above its basal
elevation; see above). The lower, later date is slightly younger than Burial 1, providing
some support for the interpretation that this burial was a moderately intrusive event.
However, since the older date was above the younger one, it appears to reflect the
movement of sediments and perhaps archaeological materials across the site through
either cultural or natural agencies after the Burial 1 interment, raising some questions
about the overall stratigraphic integrity of this part of the site. Such agencies, not
recognized before excavation, may have included animal burrowing, colluvial movement

152

downslope from higher parts of the site, cultural activities, or some combination of
these.
The third batch submission was intended not only to obtain the same kinds of
contextual data targeted in the first submission, but also to provide information about
periods when there was a focus on big game (bison) for subsistence and other resources.
For this group of samples, only recognizable bison elements were selected (see Table
5-2). The reasoning behind this sampling strategy was that, even if resulting assays
included inverted dates similar to those seen in the first two sample submissions, these
dates could nonetheless be used to reconstruct site formation processes and could also
provide information for reconstructing periods of intensive focus on bison exploitation.
Furthermore, since these assays were from bison elements, directly reflecting when
bison were hunted and brought to the site, patterns in age distributions within this
third batch of samples could suggest patterns of site use or occupation in ways that
could not be demonstrated using other available data.
When selecting bison specimens for dating, a deliberate effort was made to evenly
sample identified elements as they occurred across multiple analytical units that had
been provisionally identified up to that point. Initially, a total of 16 specimens were
identified for sampling. Five were submitted to the University of South Florida for
isotopic study, with the understanding that extracted collagen would then to be sent
for dating to the University of Georgia. Those five samples were apparently never
processed, and CAS was forced to finalize the dating program for the project without
including those additional data. Nevertheless, to the degree that results indicate the
emphasis on bison hunting by time period, it is clear that the most intensive period of
bison exploitation occurred during the Toyah interval (8 of 12 dates; out-of-order dates
were used to revise AU designations in cases where early dates were found in lower
deposits). Not only are 66 percent of these assays Toyah in age, but they span of
460–730 B.P., indicating multiple visitations to the site during this Late Prehistoric
period.
Not all dates of bison remains indicate Toyah exploitation. One sample,
UGAMS-4429, was Late Archaic in age (2080 B.P., 161–133 B.C. and 116–50 B.C.),
and two samples, UGAMS-4426 and UGAMS-4428, probably reflect Colonial-era
bison hunting and perhaps even later Historic-era bison exploitation, respectively.
Both samples have multiple intercepts, and because of its late age, UGAMS-4428 is
difficult to interpret and may simply be too poorly preserved to be reliable. If the date
is accurate, however, then it represents bison hunting at Zatopec at the very end of the
nineteenth to early twentieth century. The probable Colonial-era date, produced by
Sample UGAMS-4426, is contemporaneous with the single sherd of Black Luster Glaze
ceramics recovered during earlier SWT field schools (see Chapter 6) and strengthens the
interpretation of a Spanish mission-era occupation, however ephemeral, at the site.

153

It should be clearly stated that Zatopec is not identified as the site of a mission, only
the location of activities that date to the mission period. In this regard, the direct dating
program for bison not only precisely identified periods of shifting focus in patterns of
faunal exploitation that can be used to contextualize changes in technological behavior
as well as site visitation events. It also confirmed a highly significant Colonial presence
previously indicated by only a single ceramic sherd.
Finally, the last batch of samples was selected directly from each of the three
burials from the site. As discussed, the archaeological age of Burial 1 could not be
confidently determined as a result of the conflicting dates from samples submitted
earlier. Furthermore, based on the stratigraphic relationship between Burial 1 and
Burials 2 and 3, and considering the more highly weathered condition of Burials 2 and
3, the initial assumption was that these two interments predated Burial 1. However,
direct dates indicated that they all date to the same general time period, 1300 B.P. (A.D.
668–709 and A.D. 746–766) for Burial 1; 1250 B.P. (A.D. 773–870, and A.D. 666–708)
for Burial 2; and 1305 B.P. (A.D. 746–765) for Burial 3. Importantly, while dates for
Burials 1 and 3 are almost identical, Burial 3 appeared to be slightly older than Burial
2, suggesting that Individual 2 was interred at a later date and after Individual 3 was
already in place. The ordering of burial events between Individuals 1 and 3 could not be
determined by available radiocarbon or stratigraphic data. Nevertheless, the emphasis
on reusing this specific locality within the larger Zatopec site area for the purpose of
interring people demonstrates the importance of this location as a small group cemetery
for the occupants of the site during the transitional period between Late Archaic II and
Austin times.
Radiocarbon-Based Site Chronology
Based on the overall radiocarbon results from Zatopec, the site was occupied
from Late Archaic I into Colonial times. Clearly, this sequence is only part of the
longer history of site use indicated by temporally diagnostic artifacts, but should be
viewed as the best-represented, most intact portion of the site record. Beyond simply
fixing occupation phases on an absolute time scale, however, radiocarbon data from
Zatopec can be used to characterize different periods of site occupation by evaluating
the degree to which certain dates from each phase do or do not do not overlap. It is
important to note at this point that a larger sample of dates would have been better
suited for this kind of analysis. Nevertheless, some preliminary statements can be
made that are intended both to describe the history of site use at Zatopec and perhaps
also to stimulate better use of radiocarbon data from other sites in the region. Here,
we consider radiocarbon dates from the Late Archaic II/Austin component(s) and from
the Toyah component. Earlier and later phases of site occupation lack an appropriate
sample of assays.

154

Based on calibrated, two-sigma probabilities, as many as four separate visitation
events can be identified for both the Late Archaic II/Austin and Toyah components
(Figures 5-24, 5-25). These events are defined by periods of no or minimal overlap
between radiocarbon assays. Larger samples of dates might have helped to determine
whether these apparent hiatuses are real or simply a matter of limited sample size. Yet
there clearly are many dates that could not have been deposited during the same site
visitation events.
Assays that overlap to a small degree cannot be ruled out as having occurred
during the same visitation event. This overlap problem affects the proposed boundaries
between Events 2 and 3 for the Late Archaic II/Austin phase, and between Events 3
and 4 for the Toyah phase. In the case of the Late Archaic II/Austin periods, the break
between Late Archaic II and Austin is situated between Events 2 and 3, at ca. 1250 B.P.

Event 1 is neatly isolated (although dated by only a single assay) in each case, and no
overlap is evident between Event 3 and 4 dates for Late Archaic II/Austin or between
Events 2 and 3 in Toyah (distributions for both UGAMS-4432 and UGAMS -4433
end at A.D. 1405, whereas the distribution for UGAMS-4427 begins at A.D. 1408, a
very faint hiatus that is difficult to see in Figure 5-24). In cases such as these, where
probability distributions overlap slightly between different assays, averaging the dates
can sometimes help clarify proposed distinctions between what are identified as discrete
cultural phenomena. When averaging dates, it is important to include only those dates
thought to represent discrete, related events or strata. Rationales and techniques for
averaging dates were presented in Long and Rippeteau (1974).
It is possible that too few assays were available from Zatopec to produce statistically
representative results for averaged dates. Nevertheless, dates from different site
events for Late Archaic II/Austin and for Toyah were averaged, with different results
(Table 5-3). In several cases, including Late Archaic II/Austin Events 2, 3, and 4, and
Toyah Event 2, the troubling spreads of dates were tightened. However, the slight
overlap between Toyah Events 3 and 4 was only barely tightened by approximately
15–13 calendar years. In this case, averaging resulted in very little analytical clarity
between these two postulated events. Clearly, averaging radiocarbon data in certain
circumstances could further aid in reconstructing site occupation histories at fine scales
of resolution. However, larger universes of data would probably have produced more
representative results than could be achieved from the limited data available from
Zatopec.

Looking at both averaged and unaveraged radiocarbon data for these two periods,
we find no compelling evidence refuting the four postulated occupation events for each
period. We acknowledge that larger sample sizes are needed in order to establish these
patterns, but at present these data are seen as usefully characterizing differences in
site occupation patterns in the continuous Late Archaic II-to-Austin period versus the
Toyah period. During each of these two periods, we suggest that Zatopec was occupied
approximately four times that resulted in the deposition of organic remains available
for sampling during the CAS fieldwork and analysis. To the degree that this assessment
is accurate, further conclusions are possible about the frequency of site occupation.
Based on calibrated age distributions from available samples, the Late Archaic II/
Austin period at the site lasted a little less than 400 years, from shortly after A.D.
625 until shortly before A.D. 1025 (see Figure 5-23). By the same criteria, the Toyah
period lasted less than 200 years, from after A.D. 1250 to before A.D. 1450 (see Figure
5-24.)1 Considering four visits or occupations per period, site visitation during the
Toyah interval approximately doubled in frequency from the preceding period, from
approximately once every 100 years in the Late Archaic II/Austin period to once every
50 years in the Toyah. Although this interpretation requires confirmation from other
sites with well-dated components from these two intervals, this hypothetical shift in
Toyah settlement pattern observed at Zatopec is consistent with other arguments
associating increased mobility during this time with increasingly logistical hunting (e.g,.
Mauldin et al. 2009).

1 Although radiocarbon-dated components may not fully represent the duration of occupation for each
time period, we stand by the reconstruction of Analytical Units based on projected lengths of these archaeological phases as described in Chapter 3. In our view, possible problems with how Analytical Units were
reconstructed do not undermine the postulated occupation patterns proposed using radiocarbon data. If
more dates were available from these periods, they would presumably reflect the suggested pattern of site
occupation, expressing the frequency of occupation and not the overall length of the archaeological periods
in question.

157

Summary
Radiocarbon dates from Zatopec are most useful when considered in the context of
their associations with other archaeological evidence and stratigraphic relationships
across the site. Interpretations of these data and associations are presented below
in tabular format and in more detailed narrative discussions. Inasmuch as sampling
strategies for the project were considered equally important to interpretations about the
cultural behavior under investigation, the discussions also address these strategies.
Radiocarbon sampling strategies included the use dated couplets for assessing
critical deposits or features, directly dating important features such as burials, and
directly dating selected subsistence and utilitarian resources, such as bison, to explain
their changing frequencies through time rather than reconstructing these changes by
association. Viewed from the perspective of the strategies employed, radiocarbon results
provided several types of information not otherwise evident in the artifact assemblage
alone, including the importance of site reuse for the purpose of interring members of
the social groups who occupied the site and the approximation of the site’s frequency
of occupation through the relative number of dates for each time period. Even out-oforder dates, when selected through application of these strategies, were useful for these
purposes.
When viewed together with technological data (presented in Chapter 7), some of
the radiocarbon results confirmed the apparent cultural and occupational continuity
at Zatopec from Late Archaic II to Austin times, at least as these time periods were
defined for this project (Figure 5-25). This continuity was reflected by not only the small
cemetery containing three burials, but also by almost half of the all dates collected from
the site. When plotted on the IntCal09 calibration curve, no strong occupational hiatus
was evident between Late Archaic II and Austin dates; rather, this interval appeared
in both calibrated and averaged dates as a very modest hiatus between Late Archaic II/
Austin Events 2 and 3. Together, however, this period clustered distinctly apart from a
small number of earlier assays and also from the later Toyah dates.
In this study radiocarbon evidence has proven essential to identifying a thin
Colonial presence in the area that was otherwise noted by a single ceramic sherd.
Needless to say, this conclusion is extremely important for demonstrating the full
range of cultural occupation at the site and in the general region for a time when few
if any Native American sites are known outside of mission contexts. Without this kind
of confirming evidence, the early historic part of the cultural record of Zatopec, and the
overall San Marcos area, would be difficult if not impossible to verify from the material
evidence.
More samples than what was available from the Toyah component at Zatopec, or
earlier ones, would be needed to demonstrate clearly the periods of site abandonment

158

or to reconstruct visitation frequency. Yet among the eight Toyah dates from the site,
several samples could not have been deposited during the same event; the same is true
for the longer, earlier period. To our knowledge, using radiocarbon data to reconstruct
site visitation histories or frequency is new to Central Texas regional studies. However,
when adequate numbers of samples are available, this technique seems to offer the
opportunity to reconstruct patterns of site use, abandonment, and revisitation at
temporal scales not accessible in most component-level assemblages.
Finally, data presented here will be important in the future archaeological research
focusing on the reconstruction of subsistence patterns and precisely dating periods in
regional prehistory during which bison-hunting was particularly important. Commonly,
periods of bison presence or abundance have been reconstructed through associations of
bison remains with or within cultural or natural strata that may be diffuse, disturbed,
and/or poorly dated (see detailed discussion of this issue in Mauldin et al. 2009). Too
often, these factors have remained unrecognized prior to or even during excavation,
and bison density models have been developed as a by-product of the general character
or quality of the associations between dated strata and their remains. Directly dating
bison, as done here, resolves these issues and presents a view that is both accurate
and precise regarding when bison were important to both historic and prehistoric
inhabitants of the region.

Ceramic Analyses

Editor’s note

T

his chapter describes the analysis of the small collection
of ceramic artifacts collected from Zatopec. Two separate
studies were conducted. The first was a compositional analysis
of ten sherds by Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis
(INAA) at the Missouri University Research Reactor (MURR). The
second included a descriptive analysis of all sherd material, and
a petrographic (mineralogical) analysis of eight of the ten sherds
submitted to MURR. Dr. Leslie Cecil coordinated the sample
submission to MURR, and includes a brief integrative discussion
of the INAA and petrographic results at the conclusion of her
report. The goal of this work was to develop an understanding
about patterns of prehistoric ceramic manufacture and exchange
in Central Texas within the limitations of a small sample and poorly
known regional trends. Four sherds from Zatopec are statistical
matches for a previously defined compositional group (CT2) from
southeast Central Texas. Comparisons with reference groups
from the Caddo area (Titus group) and Late Prehistoric Antelope
Creek in northern Texas reveal no compositional matches.

162

While similarities are noted between CT2 and some Caddo sherds
from East Texas, petrographic analysis indicates that these
materials were made from different paste recipes and that cultural
affinities between these populations were likely minimal to nonexistent. Trade is indicated, however, by the unique mineralogy
of one sherd (ZAT012), which is unlike any of the other materials
submitted for analysis. Another sherd, identified as Black Luster
Glaze (ZAT014), is likely to be of Colonial rather than Late
Prehistoric age and may represent an ephemeral early Historic
presence at the site not otherwise detected in the recovered
material evidence.

Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis of Toyah
Ceramics from 41HY163, Central Texas
Jeffrey R. Ferguson and Michael D. Glascock Archaeometry Laboratory

This project involves the analysis of nine pottery samples from the Late Prehistoric,
primarily Toyah phase occupation of 41HY163. A tenth sherd belonging to the Black
Luster Glaze type is believed to date to the early Historic, or Colonial period of the
region’s chronology. The primary goal of this research is to determine the relationship
with other samples previously analyzed at the Missouri University Research Reactor
(MURR). The samples are projected against the entire MURR ceramic database, and
more detailed comparisons are made to the Central Texas groups developed by Neff
and Glascock (2002) and by Meier (2007) for the Late Prehistoric Antelope Creek Phase
in the Texas Panhandle. The small number of samples in the current study limits the
potential for creating internal groupings. The single sherd of Black Luster Glaze does
not match anything in the MURR database. While four of the samples match the CT2
Reference Group, the remaining samples are unassigned. Perhaps a more extensive
sample of Toyah ceramics from the region would allow the development of compositional
groups.
Sample Preparation
Pottery samples were prepared for INAA using procedures standard at MURR.
Fragments of about 1 cm2 were removed from each sample and abraded using a silicon
carbide burr in order to remove glaze, slip, paint, and adhering soil, thereby reducing
the risk of measuring contamination. The samples were washed in deionized water and
allowed to dry in the laboratory. Once dry, the individual sherds were ground to powder
in an agate mortar to homogenize the samples. Archival samples were retained from
each sherd (when possible) for future research.
Two analytical samples were prepared from each source specimen. Portions of
approximately 150 mg of powder were weighed into clean high-density polyethylene
vials used for short irradiations at MURR. At the same time, 200 mg of each sample
was weighed into clean high-purity quartz vials used for long irradiations. Individual
sample weights were recorded to the nearest 0.01 mg using an analytical balance.
Both vials were sealed prior to irradiation. Along with the unknown samples,
Standards made from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) certified
standard reference materials of SRM-1633a (coal fly ash) and SRM-688 (basalt rock)
were similarly prepared, as were quality control samples (e.g., standards treated as
unknowns) of SRM-278 (obsidian rock) and Ohio Red Clay (a standard developed for inhouse applications).

164

Irradiation and Gamma-Ray Spectroscopy
Neutron activation analysis of ceramics at MURR, which consists of two irradiations
and a total of three gamma counts, constitutes a superset of the procedures used at
most other NAA laboratories (Glascock 1992; Neff 1992, 2000). As discussed in detail
by Glascock (1992), a short irradiation is carried out through the pneumatic tube
irradiation system. Samples in the polyvials are sequentially irradiated, two at a time,
for five seconds by a neutron flux of 8 x 1013 n cm-2 s-1. The 720-second count yields
gamma spectra containing peaks for nine short-lived elements: aluminum (Al), barium
(Ba), calcium (Ca), dysprosium (Dy), potassium (K), manganese (Mn), sodium (Na),
titanium (Ti), and vanadium (V). The samples are encapsulated in quartz vials and
are subjected to a 24-hour irradiation at a neutron flux of 5 x 1013 n cm-2 s-1. This long
irradiation is analogous to the single irradiation utilized at most other laboratories.
After the long irradiation, samples decay for seven days, and then are counted for 1,800
seconds (the “middle count”) on a high-resolution germanium detector coupled to an
automatic sample changer. The middle count yields determinations of seven medium
half-life elements, namely arsenic (As), lanthanum (La), lutetium (Lu), neodymium
(Nd), samarium (Sm), uranium (U), and ytterbium (Yb). After an additional three- or
four-week decay, a final count of 8,500 seconds is carried out on each sample. The
latter measurement yields the following 17 long half-life elements: cerium (Ce), cobalt
(Co), chromium (Cr), cesium (Cs), europium (Eu), iron (Fe), hafnium (Hf), nickel (Ni),
rubidium (Rb), antimony (Sb), scandium (Sc), strontium (Sr), tantalum (Ta), terbium
(Tb), thorium (Th), zinc (Zn), and zirconium (Zr).
The element concentration data from the three measurements are tabulated in
parts per million using the EXCEL spreadsheet program. Descriptive data for the
archaeological samples were appended to the concentration spreadsheet. The data
are also stored in a dBASE/FOXPRO database file useful for organizing, sorting, and
extracting sample information.
Interpreting Chemical Data
The analyses at MURR described previously produced elemental concentration values
for 33 elements in most of the analyzed samples. Data for Ni in most samples was
below detection limits (as is the norm for most New World ceramic analyses) and was
removed from consideration during the statistical analysis. Because calcium has the
potential to affect (dilute) the concentrations of other elements in the analysis, all
samples were mathematically corrected to compensate for any possible calcium-included
effects (the data were examined before and after calcium correction and the results were
similar). The same adjustment was made for all comparative datasets. The following
mathematical correction was used as it has been proven to be effective in other calciumrich datasets (Cogswell et al. 1998:64; Steponaitis et al. 1988):

165

106e
e' = ―――――
106 - 2.5c
where e′ is the corrected concentration of a given element in ppm, e is the measured
concentration of that element in ppm, and c is the concentration of elemental calcium
in ppm. Following the calcium adjustment, calcium levels were deleted from further
analysis. After the calcium correction, statistical analysis was carried out on base-10
logarithms of concentrations on the remaining 31 elements. Use of log concentrations
rather than raw data compensates for differences in magnitude between the major
elements, for example such as between iron and trace elements like the rare earth or
lanthanide elements (REEs). Transformation to base-10 logarithms also yields a more
normal distribution for many trace elements.
The interpretation of compositional data obtained from the analysis of archaeological
materials is discussed in detail elsewhere (e.g., Baxter and Buck 2000; Bieber et al.
1976; Bishop and Neff 1989; Glascock 1992; Harbottle 1976; Neff 2000) and will only be
summarized here. The main goal of data analysis is to identify distinct homogeneous
groups within the analytical database. Based on the provenance postulate of Weigand
et al. (1977), different chemical groups may be assumed to represent geographically
restricted sources. For lithic materials such as obsidian, basalt, and cryptocrystalline
silicates (e.g., chert, flint, or jasper), raw material samples are frequently collected
from known outcrops or secondary deposits and the compositional data obtained on the
samples is used to define the source localities or boundaries. The locations of sources
can also be inferred by comparing unknown specimens (i.e., ceramic artifacts) to knowns
(i.e., clay samples) or by indirect methods such as the “criterion of abundance” (Bishop
et al. 1992) or by arguments based on geological and sedimentological characteristics
(e.g., Steponaitis et al. 1996). The ubiquity of ceramic raw materials usually makes
it impossible to sample all potential “sources” intensively enough to create groups
of knowns to which unknowns can be compared. Lithic sources tend to be more
localized and compositionally homogeneous in the case of obsidian or compositionally
heterogeneous as is the case for most cherts.
Compositional groups can be viewed as “centers of mass” in the compositional
hyperspace described by the measured elemental data. Groups are characterized by the
locations of their centroids and the unique relationships (i.e., correlations) between the
elements. Decisions about whether to assign a specimen to a particular compositional
group are based on the overall probability that the measured concentrations for the
specimen could have been obtained from that group.

166

Initial hypotheses about source-related subgroups in the compositional data can be
derived from non-compositional information (e.g., archaeological context, decorative
attributes, etc.) or from application of various pattern-recognition techniques to the
multivariate chemical data. Some of the pattern recognition techniques that have
been used to investigate archaeological data sets are cluster analysis (CA), principal
components analysis (PCA), and discriminant analysis (DA). Each of the techniques has
it own advantages and disadvantages which may depend upon the types and quantity of
data available for interpretation.
The variables (measured elements) in archaeological and geological data sets are
often correlated and frequently large in number. This makes handling and interpreting
patterns within the data difficult. Therefore, it is useful to transform the original
variables into a smaller set of uncorrelated variables to make data interpretation
easier. Of the above-mentioned pattern recognition techniques, PCA is a technique
that transforms from the data from the original correlated variables into uncorrelated
variables most easily.
PCA creates a new set of reference axes arranged in decreasing order of variance
subsumed. The individual PCs are linear combinations of the original variables. The
data can be displayed on combinations of the new axes, just as they can be displayed
on the original elemental concentration axes. PCA can be used in a pure patternrecognition mode, i.e., to search for subgroups in an undifferentiated data set, or in a
more evaluative mode, i.e., to assess the coherence of hypothetical groups suggested by
other criteria. Generally, compositional differences between specimens can be expected
to be larger for specimens in different groups than for specimens in the same group, and
this implies that groups should be detectable as distinct areas of high point density on
plots of the first few components.
It is well known that PCA of chemical data is scale dependent (Mardia et al.
1979), and analyses tend to be dominated by those elements or isotopes for which the
concentrations are relatively large. As a result, standardization methods are common to
most statistical packages. A common approach is to transform the data into logarithms
(e.g., base 10).
One frequently exploited strength of PCA, discussed by Baxter (1992), Baxter and
Buck (2000), and Neff (1994, 2002), is that it can be applied as a simultaneous R- and
Q-mode technique, with both variables (elements) and objects (individual analyzed
samples) displayed on the same set of principal component reference axes. A plot using
the first two principal components as axes is usually the best possible two-dimensional
representation of the correlation or variance-covariance structure within the data set.
Small angles between the vectors from the origin to variable coordinates indicate strong
positive correlation; angles at 90 degrees indicate no correlation; and angles close to 180
degrees indicate strong negative correlation. Likewise, a plot of sample coordinates on

167

these same axes will be the best two-dimensional representation of Euclidean relations
among the samples in log-concentration space (if the PCA was based on the variancecovariance matrix) or standardized log-concentration space (if the PCA was based on
the correlation matrix). Displaying both objects and variables on the same plot makes
it possible to observe the contributions of specific elements to group separation and to
the distinctive shapes of the various groups. Such a plot is commonly referred to as a
“biplot” in reference to the simultaneous plotting of objects and variables. The variable
inter-relationships inferred from a biplot can be verified directly by inspecting bivariate
elemental concentration plots. (Note that a bivariate plot of elemental concentrations is
not a biplot.)
Whether a group can be discriminated easily from others can be evaluated visually
in two dimensions or statistically in multiple dimensions. The Mahalanobis distance
(or generalized distance) metric makes it possible to describe the separation between
groups or between individual samples and groups on multiple dimensions. The
Mahalanobis distance of a specimen from a group centroid (Bieber et al. 1976, Bishop
and Neff 1989) is defined by:

D2y, X = [y – X ]t IX[y – X ]
where y is the 1 x m array of logged elemental concentrations for the specimen of
interest, X is the n x m data matrix of logged concentrations for the group to which the
point is being compared with X being its 1 x m centroid, and I X is the inverse of the
m x m variance-covariance matrix of group X. Because Mahalanobis distance takes
into account variances and covariances in the multivariate group, it is analogous to
expressing distance from a univariate mean in standard deviation units. Like standard
deviation units, Mahalanobis distances can be converted into probabilities of group
membership for individual specimens. For relatively small samples, it is appropriate
to base probabilities on Hotelling’s T 2 , which is the multivariate extension of the
univariate Student’s t.
When group sizes are small, Mahalanobis distance-based probabilities can fluctuate
dramatically depending upon whether or not each specimen is assumed to be a member
of the group to which it is being compared. Harbottle (1976) calls this phenomenon
“stretchability” in reference to the tendency of an included specimen to stretch the
group in the direction of its own location in elemental concentration space. This problem
can be circumvented by cross-validation, that is, by removing each specimen from its
presumed group before calculating its own probability of membership (Baxter 1994;
Leese and Main 1994). This is a conservative approach to group evaluation that may
sometimes exclude true group members.
Small sample and group sizes place further constraints on the use of Mahalanobis
distance: with more elements than samples, the group variance-covariance matrix
is singular thus rendering calculation of IX (and D2 itself) impossible. Therefore, the

168

dimensionality of the groups must somehow be reduced. One approach would be
to eliminate elements considered irrelevant or redundant. The problem with this
approach is that the investigator’s preconceptions about which elements should be
discriminate may not be valid. It also squanders the main advantage of multi-element
analysis, namely the capability to measure a large number of elements. An alternative
approach is to calculate Mahalanobis distances with the scores on principal components
extracted from the variance-covariance or correlation matrix for the complete data set.
This approach entails only the assumption, entirely reasonable in light of the above
discussion of PCA, that most group-separating differences should be visible on the first
several PCs. Unless a data set is extremely complex, containing numerous distinct
groups, using enough components to subsume at least 90 percent of the total variance
in the data can be generally assumed to yield Mahalanobis distances that approximate
Mahalanobis distances in full elemental concentration space.
Lastly, Mahalanobis distance calculations are also useful for handling missing data
(Sayre 1975). When many specimens are analyzed for a large number of elements, a few
element concentrations almost certainly will be missed for some specimens. This occurs
most frequently when the concentration for an element is near the detection limit.
Rather than eliminate the specimen or the element from consideration, it is possible to
substitute a missing value by replacing it with a value that minimizes the Mahalanobis
distance for the specimen from the group centroid. Thus, those few specimens that are
missing a single concentration value can still be used in group calculations.
Results and Conclusions
The sample size is too small for statistically valid assessment of internal compositional
variation. We have compared the new data to the entire MURR ceramic NAA database
as well as two sets of reference groups from Central Texas. Table 6-1 is a list of the
current samples along with some descriptive information.
Comparison with MURR database
The samples were projected against the entire MURR ceramic NAA database
containing more than 55,000 samples, producing surprisingly few close matches. The
only close matches were samples analyzed for Darrell Creel from Central Texas. Four
of the samples (ZAP002, 019, 021, and 022) showed some compositional similarity to a
small number of Creel’s samples. All of the possible matches from the MURR database
were assigned by Neff and Glascock (2002) to the (CT2) compositional group. A more
detailed comparison with the Central Texas samples follows.
Comparison with Central Texas Compositional Groups
The Central Texas reference groups developed by Neff and Glascock (2002) include
six groups, two of which (CT1 and CT2) have 75 or more members. The new ZAT
samples were compared to the CT groups in bivariate plots, and the only two groups

169

with possible overlap were CT1 and CT2. Table 6-2 lists the probabilities of membership
in CT1 and CT2 as well as the Titus Group from the Caddo region. The Titus group is
included because it has significant compositional overlap with the CT2 group due to
the presumed compositional similarity between the Cretaceous and Jurassic parent
material in the Caddo region of east Texas and the eastern portions of Central Texas
(Neff and Glascock 2002). In this case there is no indication of overlap, as none of the
samples have significant probabilities of membership in the Titus Group, even when
they do have high probabilities of membership in CT2. Samples ZAT002, 019, 021,
and 022 have reasonable probabilities of belonging to CT2 and not either of the other
two groups. Neff and Glascock (2002) note that CT2 samples are concentrated in the
southeastern portion of Central Texas, which would fit with the location of the current
samples.

Comparison with Antelope Creek Phase Ceramics
Few Central Texas samples have been previously analyzed at MURR beyond those
included in the CT1 and CT2 references groups developed by Neff and Glascock (2002).
Holly Meier (2007) analyzed 75 sherds from three Antelope Creek Phase sites in northcentral Texas and developed five compositional groups. None of Meier’s samples was
found to be a likely match during the Euclidian search of the entire MURR database,
and a direct comparison confirms this assessment. In a projection of the samples from
Zatopec against Meier’s groups using the first seven principal components only two of
the ZAT samples have a significant probability of membership in any of Meier’s groups
(Table 6-3). However, Meier’s compositional groups are relatively small, and thus the
membership probabilities of projected samples can be inflated. A bivariate plot of the
ZAT samples against Meier’s groups (Figure 6-1) confirms the lack of overlap.

of overlap between the Zatopec samples and Meier’s (2007) compositional groups. The
new samples are individually plotted and labeled. ZAT012 is not plotted because it is
very different from the other samples/groups. Ellipses represent 90 percent confidence
intervals for memberships in the groups.

Internal Groupings
The limited number of samples constrains our ability to examine patterning within
the new dataset, but there are two clusters of samples that show great similarity. The
first cluster includes three of the four samples assigned to CT2. Samples ZAT002, 020,
and 021 are very similar, as shown in Figure 6-1. Samples ZAT001 and ZAT008 are
closely related, according to a hierarchical cluster analysis, and they both exhibit bone
and sand inclusions. ZAT012 is very different from the remainder of the samples. It is
very different in number of elements, so much so that it is not included in Figure 6-1.
A larger sample of Toyah ceramics from the region might allow the development of
compositional groups.

172

Conclusions
The primary goal of this project is to determine the relationship of samples of pottery
from Zatopec with other samples previously analyzed at MURR. Four of the samples
belong to the CT2 group that Neff and Glascock (2002) suggested was produced in the
southeastern area of Central Texas. The Zatopec samples are also compared directly
to the Meier (2007) samples from north Central Texas, but no similarity was observed.
The absence of previously analyzed samples similar to the six unassigned samples from
this study suggests that many of the Toyah phase ceramics may have been produced
from a unique combination of raw materials. Perhaps a more extensive sample of
Toyah ceramics from the region would allow the development of compositional groups.
The limited number of samples in the current study limited the potential for creating
internal groupings, but two clusters of compositionally-similar samples were apparent.
The single sherd of Black Luster Glaze does not match anything in the MURR database.

Descriptive

and

Petrographic Report and Summary for
Pottery from 41HY163, Zatopec
Leslie G. Cecil

This report describes the petrography of eight sherd samples excavated from
Zatopec. Images of each of the thin sections are included in Appendix D. All images
of petrographic thin sections were taken in plane, polarized light (unless noted) with
×5 magnification. Each image is a portion of one of the two fields that was counted
for this analysis. Following the point count/temper group section of this report is
an interpretation of the INAA data generated by Ferguson and Glascock and these
petrographic data. While there is not a one-to-one correlation between the chemical
and mineralogical data, there are some interesting results that highlight the need
for combining chemical and petrographic data to better understand Late Prehistoric,
including Toyah potting (and possibly exchange) behavior.
Surface Attributes
Based on surface characteristics and general ware descriptions (Kittleman 1994;
Prewitt 1981; Ricklis 1994; Suhm and Jelks 1962), 19 of the 23 sherds can be classified
as belonging to the Leon Plain Ware and two (ZAT008 and ZAT009) are classified
as Doss Red Ware sherds (Table 6-4, Figures 6-2, 6-3). The Leon Plain Ware sherds
had smoothed exteriors and in some areas on the sherds there exists slight evidence
of burnishing. The interior surface of the sherds was characterized by drag marks.
Samples ZAT007 and ZAT008 have oxidized outer margins suggesting that “the
interior was either cooled more quickly or (more likely) was less accessible to air”
(Rye 1981:117). Evidence of spalling (when a vessel is heated too quickly resulting
in differential rates of moisture loss and parts of the vessel wall flake or explode off)
exists on sample ZAT023. There are two sherds (ZAT008 and ZAT009) that have red
decoration or a red wash/slip. Sherd ZAT014 was classified as a Black Luster Glaze
(Lohse personal communication, 2009), but did not chemically match any of the sherds
from this ware. Finally sample ZAT012 may have asphalt on the rim. This may be
possible, but given the thin section, it has not been shown to be the case. This sherd is
the one very unusual sherd, petrographically and chemically.
Surface colors ranged from reddish brown (2.5YR 5-4/3-4), red (10R 4/6), dusky red
(10R 3/4), to light brown (7.5YR 6-5/4), and pale red (2.5YR 5/6). Most of the cores are

darker than the remainder of the sherd suggesting an incomplete oxidization of the
sherd (not all of the organics were burned out in the firing process). No sherd forms
could be determined given the small size and that all but one (ZAT001) was a body
sherd. Sherd ZAT001 has a rim diameter of 18 cm (Figure 6-4), but the vessel form could
not be determined with any confidence.

Methodology
Petrographic analysis allows the analyst to identify minerals that are present in the
clay pastes of different vessels. Petrography allows analysis of many clay materials and
inclusions at one time. One can study “the clay itself, natural inclusions in the clay,
purposefully added inclusions, and glazes or slips on the clay surface” (Childs 1989:24).
Petrographic analysis has been adapted from geological techniques of analysis for
the study of soils and rocks and is useful for archaeological ceramics because, to a large
extent, geological sources differ enough regionally to allow for comparison of different
clays (Blatt 1992). These methods are applicable to pottery analysis because pottery
can be regarded as metamorphosed sedimentary rock due to the composition of a sherd
consisting of clastic grains imbedded in a clay paste which has been transformed to
“rock” through the process of firing (Bishop et al. 1992; Rice 1987:376). Understanding
these basic principles of geology plus other principles of optical mineralogy, allow the
description of pottery pastes and clays.
Although petrographic analysis is important to this research design, there are some
limitations. Thin-sectioning may not produce the full mineralogical composition of a
pottery sample due to sampling error and because the method of producing thin-section
slides involves grinding and polishing of the sample (Orton et al. 1993). In addition
to problems with sample preparation, petrographic analysis alone cannot determine
the type of clay mineral in the sherd because of the refractive characteristics of clay
minerals. Because of these limitations, petrography is often combined with x-ray
diffraction in order to obtain a full mineralogical complement and INAA to obtain a full
elemental complement.
The eight samples were cut with a wet saw for the preparation of thin section slides.
The sherds were sent to Spectrum Petrographics where they were embedded in an
epoxy block. The most fragile sherds were vacuum impregnated and then embedded in
an epoxy block. The block was cut in such a manner that a thin section measuring .03
mm thick resulted. The resulting thin section allowed the identification of minerals in
the clay paste with the use of a polarizing microscope.
The polarizing microscope is composed of a light source, a polarizer, a condenser, a
rotatable stage, objective, slots for a quartz wedge, an analyzer, and a Bertrand lens.
Light originates from a light source at the base of the microscope and passes through
the polarizer that aligns the light waves in a single plane or direction. The polarized
light then passes through minerals on the rotatable stage and bends them according to
the mineral structure because each mineral and inclusion transmits light differently
and is thus identifiable (McLaughlin 1977). The objective magnifies the resulting
light waves and the light passes through an analyzer. Analyzers allow light to vibrate
in a plane perpendicular to that of the first polarizer. When the analyzer is in place
(crossed nicols), birefringence colors appear and can then be compared to published

179

charts to identify the mineral. If the crossed nicol color, angle of extinction, and other
mineralogical characteristics are not sufficient in the identification of the mineral, the
Bertrand lens and condenser produce interference figures that determine the mineral’s
sign (uniaxial or biaxial). Interference colors, in addition to the techniques described
above, allow identification of most minerals.
Thin-sectioning provides one objective means of classifying pottery pastes through
the analysis of mineral size, shape, roundness, and frequency. Mineral size, shape, and
roundness are established through a comparison of various graphs and tables (Figures
6-5 through 6-7) (Shackley 1975:44–51). The most common geological method of
determining the quantity of different minerals along a predetermined area (for example,
10 mm) of the length and width of the section (Chayes 1956). Various studies have
employed different methods for counting the frequency of inclusions: Peacock (1973)
uses a random grain selection; Middleton, Freestone, and Leese (1985) use a variation
of systematic sampling along linear transects with tests of accuracy for different
thin-section samples; and Dickenson and Shutler (1979) use an area point count (all
minerals, inclusions, and voids are counted in the field of view). Middleton, Freestone,
and Leese (1985) compared area counting to standard geological point counting and
determined that the number of minerals counted was equal and the only difference
was that area counting resulted in a smaller mean mineral diameter. Because mean
diameter of minerals was not critical and similar point counts were obtained with
standard point counts and area point counts (tested on 25 sherds of different matrices),
an area counting for a field of view with ×4 magnification (all thin section images were
taken at ×5 magnification) was implemented.
Before conducting an area count, I scanned the sherd to determine the range of
minerals and mineral sizes as well as to note any details of manufacturing techniques
and slip thickness. After determining the types of minerals present, I counted two
standard image areas to ensure that each area was representative of the sherds as a
whole and to detect changes in the clay paste. The first counted area was located at the
end of the slide farthest from the rim and the second was determined by rolling a die
and moving the slide the corresponding number of centimeters. For example, if I rolled a
5, I moved the slide 5 cm and centered the microscope in an area that filled the standard
image. For each mineral type, I measured the range of mineral sizes (the smallest and
the largest), the relative frequency as determined by Figure 6-5, the degree of sorting
as determined by Figure 6-6, the mineral roundness as determined by Figure 6-7, the
number of minerals in the standard image, the frequency of all of the minerals in the
clay paste as determined by Figure 6-5, and the clay birefringence. Other abnormalities
were also noted.

Results
As a result of the point counts, four basic paste groups emerged (see discussions and
Tables 6-5, 6-6, 6-7, and 6-8 below). In addition to the differences in pastes, three
general clay paste categories were observed: a dense homogenous clay fabric; a sandy,
coarser sand clay fabric; and a light colored fine paste fabric. In general, small quartz
minerals, biotite, iron, and organics most likely occur because they are part of the clay
body. They are also not too angular which may be the result of weathering from the
parent material. Obvious culturally-added inclusions include the bone, grog, and shell.
Although most of these sherds are similar (petrographically and chemically) to those
from the Caddo area, the addition of shells as temper (in addition to bone and quartz)
makes them unique to the Toyah.
Paste Group 1 (Bone Tempered)
The two sherds that comprise this paste group (ZAT001 and ZAT008) are composed
of a dark brown/black compact clay fabric. There is an abundance of bone inclusions
that have been culturally added to the clay as part of the manufacturing process. This
paste group is distinguished from Paste Group 2 because of the lack of micrite and
chert inclusions and a lower frequency of quartz inclusions. The quartz that occurs in
the sherds most likely is a result of natural weathering of the clay rather than cultural
addition because of the size (small) and shape (rounded) of the minerals. ZAT008 has a
slip/decoration that is demonstrated in the thin section photographs.

Paste Group 2 (Bone, Micrite, and Chert Tempered)
The four sherds that comprise this paste group (ZAT002, ZAT009, ZAT021, and
ZAT022) are composed of a reddish-brown clay that is less compact than those sherds
in Paste Group 1. This paste group is distinguished from Paste Group 1 because of the
micrite and chert inclusions and a higher frequency of quartz inclusions (naturally
occurring, not culturally-added) and a relatively lower frequency of bone tempering.
Sample ZAT009 was included in this group even though it did not have shell inclusions.
The lack of shell inclusions could be because the petrographic sample was small;
however, it is likely that there are shell inclusions in the larger sherd and because of the
presence of micrite and chert in the clay fabric (it is also chemically similar to the other
sherds in this paste group, see below). ZAT022 has calcite inclusions which are different
from the other sherds in this group, but it is being kept in this temper group because of
the other inclusion similarities.

Paste Group 3 (Bone and Chert Tempered, No Micrite).
This sample (ZAT019) was not included in Paste Group 2 because of its lack of
micrite inclusions (a deciding characteristic for Paste Group 2). If this sample had
micrite inclusions, it would have been included in Paste Group 2 (it is chemically similar
to those sherds in Paste Group 2, see below).

Paste Group 4 (Fine Paste)
A single sherd (ZAT012) comprises this group. The sherd is an outlier when
compared to the other analyzed samples. While not truly a fine paste (lacking inclusions
of any kind), this sample has many fine sized minerals in the clay fabric. The tan
paste has a high birefringence color suggesting that it may have a mica base or was
weathered from a mica source. This sherd represents an import into the area (as far as
the sample size is considered). This sample either has a black slip or an accumulation of
black organics on its exterior surface.

Combining Petrographic and INAA Results
Ferguson and Glascock (2010) analyzed ten samples from Zatopec by INAA. Four of
the ten samples are chemically similar to a Caddo pottery chemical compositional
group (Central Texas-2 Reference Group; hereafter CT2). The other six samples did not
statistically match any of the other samples in the MURR database.
The four Toyah samples (ZAT002, ZAT019, ZAT021, and ZAT022) that were
statistical members of a previously established compositional group correlate to Caddo
pottery. Even though there are some statistical matches to pottery from Meier’s
analyses (Meier 2007) of pottery from the Antelope Creek Phase, Ferguson (personal
communication, 2010) states that this match may be false because of the small sample
sizes used by Meier and the overwhelming larger East Texas reference groups (resulting
is a large degree of overlap). Nevertheless, these samples represent petrographic Paste
Group 2 and Paste Group 3 (which could be one compositional group but are separated
because of the lack of micrite in ZAT019) and they are also very similar to Caddo
pottery. While ZAT009 is not a statistical member of this chemical group, it is included
in Paste Group 2 because of its petrographic similarities.
Even though there are similarities to Caddo pottery, Toyah pottery has one
distinguishing feature that is not typically seen in Caddo pottery: bone and shell
tempering (Caddo is typically bone and grog, or bone tempering). This would not be
distinguishable in the chemical analysis alone because of the calcium content of both
bone and shell. Therefore, the petrographic analysis of these sherds has produced
a defining characteristic of Toyah pottery that INAA could not establish on its own.
ZAT001 and ZAT008 are also petrographically very similar to pottery analyzed (by
Cecil) from the Pine Tree Mound Site (41HS15) in Harrison County. The pastes are
very compact and dark with a high frequency of bone temper; however, they are
not chemically similar to those sherds. This most likely reflects a similar method of
manufacture among the two culture groups.
While the majority of the analyzed sherds do not securely indicate trade,
sample ZAT012 does. Its paste is unlike any of the others analyzed, chemically and
petrographically. There are no analyzed samples in the MURR database that match this
sherd and Cecil has not seen any thin sections that are remotely similar to this sample.
If more sherds in other Central Texas collections look like this sample, it would be
worthwhile to analyze them to obtain a better idea of where the pottery is coming from
or if it is a local production from a rare, or less-used, clay source.
Without the petrographic analysis, one may conclude that the majority of the sherds
submitted for chemical analysis were Caddo sherds. However, with the addition of
petrographic data, researchers are able to suggest that Toyah pottery that is chemically
similar to Caddo pottery differs petrographically because of the culturally-added shell
inclusions.

Chapter VII
Lithic Analyses

Editor’s note

L

ithic materials from Zatopec were organized into the following
categories: chipped stone projectile points, bifaces, unifaces
(including expedient tool categories of utilized and modified
flakes), blades, blade cores, flake cores, and debitage. Several
hammerstones, manos, and other pecked, ground, or abraded
stones were also identified.
The analysis of each of these categories is described in the
methodology section of each section of this chapter. All analyses
addressed two of the research domains outlined in Chapter 1. These
interrelated topics include (1) documenting the full diversity of the
tool kit(s) found at residential aggregation sites like Zatopec by
defining different technological systems designed to procure food
and other resources, and (2) examining how these technological
systems were organized and carried out according to fundamental
divisions of labor and uneven skill levels.
One aspect of the first domain considers decisions about tool
design and use intensity along a continuum between formally
designed, intensively used (maintainable) tools and those that were
informally designed and only lightly used (expedient). Curation
refers to the process of keeping tools in use through refurbishment

190

and resharpening, or by regular maintenance. Curated tools are
designed to be used longer and to function more reliably than
expedient tools. Understanding curated technologies, or tool
systems that emphasize reliability over expediency, facilitates
the reconstruction of contexts within which tools were made,
used, and discarded. The logic of selecting expediency versus
maintainability in tool design was discussed in detail in Chapter 1.
The choice between these two systems shapes how certain task
groups carried out their labor from one time period to the next.
These implications are discussed in Chapters 11.
Zatopec’s lithic assemblage includes approximately 200,000
chipped, ground, and otherwise modified stone artifacts. Because
of the mixed, compressed, or otherwise out-of-order state of some
deposits, different degrees of analytical attention were given to
different components of the collection in order to address key
research questions. A complete descriptive analysis was performed
on all diagnostic points, bifaces, blade cores, blades, unifaces,
and ground and abraded stone. Artifacts in these categories from
well-defined temporal contexts were further analyzed to track
changing patterns of use or production. Debitage and expedient
tools collected from intact analytical units were also analyzed.
This approach allows us to demonstrate significant differences in
stone tool production and use-related behaviors through time.
The results of each technical analysis are presented below and
are then discussed by time period(s) and analytical unit. Patterns
across time periods are discussed in detail in Chapter 11.
In spite of the cultural overprinting and stratigraphic mixing
evident at the site, the current analysis indicates that Zatopec
retains strong residential patterning in many ways. Although
this patterning depends on the integrity of excavated contexts
(see Chapters 4, 5), it is fundamentally technological in nature
in the sense that ratios between patterns of tool design and use
change from one time period to the next according to changes in
site function and other human decisions. Not only are common
daily activities such as tool production and resource processing

191

represented, as would be expected, but changes in the intensity
with which some activities were carried out indicate fundamental
changes in labor arrangements among site occupants.
Compared with earlier time periods, Toyah deposits reflect much
more intensive processing as well as greater differentiation in terms
of successful tool production (bifaces, cores, and flake tools). To
us, this transition is best understood within the context of changes
observed in gendered labor arrangements between bison hunters,
who are understood from ethnographic analogy to have been
primarily male, and those who processed the carcasses, primarily
women. Individual differences, perhaps based on competition,
between persons who made tools associated with hunting and
those who made tools for processing large game should also be
evident. We identify different technological systems behind certain
tool forms (and their productive precursors) and related patterns
of use, and understand these as being associated with different
task groups. Therefore, in the current analysis technology and
technological patterns are understood from a different perspective
than is typically applied to prehistoric sites in the region. Here,
following others (Lechtman 1977, 1993; Lemonnier 1986),
technology is the “fundamental medium through which social
relationships, power structures, worldviews, and social production
and reproduction are expressed and defined” (Dobres and Hoffman
1994:212). This usage of the term extends beyond the mechanical
acts and cognitive strategies involved in the design and crafting
of stone tools. Also included are many hard-to-see decisions and
perceptions that influenced the selection of particular strategies,
or that conditioned the precision and efficacy with which those
acts were performed. Often these technological choices can only
partially be reconstructed from available material evidence.
This definition of technology builds on and expands most other
analytical approaches to assessing tool functionality, comparing
residential versus logistical movements and adaptive strategies
as part of settlement-subsistence behaviors, and reconstructing
reduction sequences in stone tool manufacture.

Projectile Points
Spencer LeDoux and Jon C. Lohse

Projectile points and related artifacts from Zatopec provide a great deal of information
about numerous topics pertaining to the history of site occupation and how different
activities were organized over time. In the current report, projectile points were
used to address questions in the general analysis of the site, including occupation
chronology; recognizing skill and craftsmanship of point production and, in some cases,
resharpening; tentatively modeling relationships between site occupants and groups in
nearby regions; and helping to recognize changes in gendered labor divisions over time
as heavy reliance on bison came into and went out of practice. Importantly, some topics
can be addressed by the projectile point data alone, while others are best considered by
looking at points together with other categories such as biface reduction or debitage.
Several diagnostic point types have been defined during previous archaeological
research in Texas and surrounding areas. Since these types are known to have been
in use during specific time periods, they can often provide a general idea about the
chronology of site occupation. However, not all point types have been precisely dated,
and even if dates are available for a known type, some stylistic drift may have occurred
between regions where it has been found, meaning that dates for a point type in one
region or subregion might not exactly correspond with its period of common occurrence
elsewhere.
At Zatopec, excavations and radiocarbon dating have demonstrated that not all time
periods within which points occur can be identified in discrete strata. Nevertheless,
the interpretive use of diagnostic points as index fossils provides archaeologists with
information about when human presence occurred. Information about when and by
whom each of the types recognized at Zatopec were defined appears in Appendix E.
The production process can be ordered to reflect the following sequential stages
in the use-life of projectile points: (1) gathering suitable raw materials for point
production, (2) manufacturing perform, (3) completed but unused point, (4) used
and resharpened point, (5) broken and discarded point. Evidence exists at Zatopec for
early- through late-stage biface reduction and point production. Manufacturing failures
occurred at many different stages in the reduction process, confirming that point
production, beginning at the earliest stages, was an important activity at the site.
Few of the completed points from Zatopec were without evidence of resharpening or
damage resulting from use. Most show signs of resharpening, impact, or other damage,
indicating that they were put to use either far afield or close to the camp before being
discarded. This pattern meets expectations of residential sites from which hunting

193

excursions (Binford 1980) are based, and confirms that hunting medium and large game
was an important subsistence activity at the site. Beyond big-game hunting, however,
by considering the frequency of finished points and preforms in relation to artifact
categories, such as expedient tools, changes in the importance of logistical hunting
at Zatopec can be evaluated. Point count data in relation to flake tools, presented in
Chapter 11, are an important component of these kinds of comparisons.
Variation within a point type can to a degree reveal uneven skill levels of the
knappers. The recognition of skill in lithic assemblages is complex and subjective, and
has only recently been added as a new inquiry in North American archaeological studies
(Bamforth and Finlay 2008; Lohse 2010). Nevertheless, based on numerous other
studies of well-contextualized assemblages reflecting uneven skill as well as replication
studies involving both experienced and beginner knappers (e.g., Finlay 2008; Nichols
and Allstadt 1978), several traits have been identified at Zatopec that indicate poorlyskilled flint working (see Chapter 1).
Identifying patterns of unskilled and skilled production in projectile points, however,
is problematic when points were used and then resharpened. The analysis presented
below considers manufacturing skill within point types, although it acknowledges that
original maker’s skill may often have been obscured by impact or other use-related
damage and efforts to mitigate such damage by resharpening and reworking. Because
most points from Zatopec show some form of use and manufacturing skill can only be
assessed on a relatively small portion of the assemblage, few conclusions can be drawn
about knapping skill in point production (more detailed and substantiated conclusions
concerning this topic are presented in the Debitage and Biface Preform sections of this
chapter).
Finally, projectile points provide information about the relationships of inhabitants
of the Zatopec site to people in other regions. Projectile point style is thought to have
conveyed various kinds of information to prehistoric peoples (e.g., Sackett 1982;
Wiessner 1983, 1984), including membership in relatively large ethnic or regional
groups that shared any number of possible traits and features. In Texas, Jelks (1978)
and others (Nunley et al. 1965) addressed large, surpa-regional cultural groupings by
compiling certain point types defined by morphological and/or technological similarities
into an analytical category referred to as a “series.” Jelks and others have noted strong
similarities between aspects of the prehistoric record of Central Texas and the region
to the southwest along the Rio Grande and Lower Pecos Rivers. He termed this large
area the Diablo Range (Jelks 1978), and noted that “Specific types of points that have
been described in print previously and are generally recognized as valid cultural types
constitute the building blocks of the (Diablo Range) chronology. Morphologically similar
types considered to be historically related are combined into groups termed series” Jelks
(1978:75). Prewitt (2005) has compiled all published point types in Texas as well as the
series with which they have been identified. Not all diagnostic types found in the Diablo

194

Range have been placed into series, though many are tentatively associated with one
series or another.
Few researchers have pursued the potential utility of the series concept, and the real
cultural meaning or validity of this level of classification (i.e. above the level of types)
has yet to be fully realized. Nonetheless, the geographic distributions of certain point
types (Prewitt 1995, 2005), including the vast majority of those identified at Zatopec,
suggest strong cultural affinities existed between Central Texas and the Lower Pecos
Region, and series designations are included in the present projectile point analysis.
Future researchers may contribute to the utility of this concept by similarly including
it in their analyses of lithic assemblages from the area Jelks (1978) referred to as the
Diablo Range.
Methodology
A total of 287 projectile points were recovered from Zatopec. Of these, 219 (76.3
percent) are dart points while 68 (23.6 percent) are arrow points. Twenty-nine different
types were found, including: Gower, Hoxie, Bandy, Martindale, and Uvalde for the
Early Archaic (n = 12); Arenosa, Early Triangular, La Jita, and Travis for the Middle
Archaic (n = 7); Bulverde, Pedernales, Lange, and Marshall for Late Archaic I (n = 58);
Castroville, Marcos, Montell, Edgewood, Ellis, Ensor, Fairland, Frio, and Darl for Late
Archaic II (n = 115); Bonham, Edwards, Fresno, and Scallorn for the Austin phase (n
= 35); and Cliffton, Cuney, and Perdiz for Toyah (n = 30). In addition, one untypable
Paleoindian point, 26 untypable dart points, and three untypable arrow points were
found.
All typable points were classified by Elton Prewitt and were measured and
described according to the methodology he created for analyzing Texas projectile points.
Following his earlier studies (Prewitt 2005), all artifacts were measured for thickness
to the nearest 0.1 mm and weighed to the nearest 0.1 g. A detailed pencil outline
of each artifact was made for use in measuring maximum length, maximum width,
stem length, neck width, basal width, and basal depth. While this method creates a
1 mm discrepancy in measurements, it permits more consistency in terms of where
measurements are taken. Only dimensions of complete specimens were recorded; nearly
complete specimens were not reconstructed or measured. Basic descriptive qualities
were noted about the shoulders, stem, base, notching, smoothing, beveling, serration,
and heat treatment. Finally, key technological aspects of each point type were described
including flaking patterns, whether points were made from flake blanks (as opposed to
reduced bifaces), edge modification in the form of grinding, blade beveling, and other
attributes.
Macroscopic damage was assessed using four descriptors for break patterns: snap,
crushing, burination, and thermal fracture. A snap refers to any form of breakage
resulting from bending that has a relatively flat plane perpendicular to the face of the

195

artifact. A strong force of impact may cause step or hinge terminations to accompany
the snap fracture (Ho Ho Committee 1979). Crushing refers to a form of step fracturing
that occurs when the impact force dissipates deep inside the artifact without surfacing
and removing a flake (Odell and Cowan 1986:204). Crushing on the neck or basal edge
can be an indicator of hafting. Burination refers to a type of flake that is removed from
the lateral or basal edge of an artifact rather than the face, and that terminates in a
step or hinge fracture. It is typified by compression rings running transverse to the long
axis of the edge (Epstein 1963; Odell and Cowan 1986). Burination on either distal or
proximal ends of a point can result from impact or can indicate recycling after discard.
Thermal damage was also recorded. Microscopic use-wear analysis was not performed.
After points were measured and described, the level of skill evident in the point’s
manufacture or retouch was assessed. Skill level was categorized following Bamfoth and
Finlay’s (2008) criteria (see Table 1-3, Chapter 1) using a 1–5 ranking system in which 1
is the lowest level and 5 the highest. Because point types represent many different time
periods, were associated with different activities, and may have been made and used
by different individuals, skill was assessed within rather than across types. Criteria
used to assess skill combined metric and non-metric information (see Bamforth and
Hicks 2008:138, Table 1). Metric data included variations in length, width, thickness,
and width-to-thickness ratios. Non-metric data included the types and frequencies of
predictable errors, flake terminations (stack or hinge versus feather), irregularity of
form, size ratios, and symmetry seen in cross section and outline.
It was impossible to assess skill for some specimens for a variety of reasons. Types
represented by a single specimen presented no basis for comparison. Many points were
badly fragmented and were so small that skill could not be determined. Finally, the
flaking patterns of several artifacts were obscured or destroyed by thermal damage.
Since flake terminations and flaking patterns are integral to skill identification, these
artifacts could not be ranked.
Flaking patterns are a technological method of finishing a projectile point and were
described following Crabtree (1972). Six methods were identified.
1. Very regular parallel flaking refers to flake scars that are similar in size and are
perpendicular to the lateral edges of the point. They traverse inward and create
a straight mid-line that extends along the longitudinal axis of the point.
2. Less regular parallel flaking is similar to very regular parallel flaking, but
flake length was less well controlled, creating a sinuous mid-line along the
longitudinal axis.
3. Collateral flaking refers to irregularly sized flakes that are perpendicular to the
lateral edges. Because of their size variations, there is no ribbon effect, but a
sinuous mid-line exists similar to less regular parallel flaking.
4. Oblique parallel flaking refers to similar sized, ribbon-like flakes that are not

196

perpendicular to the lateral edges. However, flake scars meet in the middle and
parallel to one another, creating a diagonal ribbon.
5. Chevron flaking refers to similar sized flakes that extend toward the proximal
edge and meet in the center. This creates a fairly straight mid-line on the
longitudinal axis with flake scars that are perpendicular to one another.
6. Random, non-patterned flaking or lack of patterning includes any flaking pattern
that could not be placed into one of the more specific categories (see Crabtree
1972:87).
In addition to containing stylistic information, flaking patterns form a fundamental
basis on which skill is assessed. Certain patterns, especially those that produce
very symmetrical point faces, require an inherently higher level of skill to reproduce
accurately. However, there is not a one to one ratio of patterning and skill. As with all
archaeological interpretations, skill must be assessed within the cultural context. Many
projectile point types reflect no predefined flaking pattern as part of their morphology
(see Appendix E). If a controlled pattern appears on one of these artifacts, flaking can
be directly correlated to skill. Other point types, however, such as Darl, are defined
by the existence of a certain type of flaking pattern. When this is the case, skill is not
evaluated from the pattern itself, but rather from the degree to which the pattern is
executed. In this example, a weak pattern consisting of irregularly sized flake scars
would be indicative of lower skill than one with identical flake scars along one edge.
Retouch can also create problems in assessing the skill of projectile point
manufacture. Many points from Zatopec appear to have been resharpened by someone
other than the original manufacturer, an observation that has also been made about
Paleoindian points in the northern High Plains (Bamforth and Hicks 2008; Bradley
1982:197). Recognizing that manufacture and usage/retouch may have involved two or
more individuals means that retouch skill should be evaluated separately from the skill
displayed in the original manufacture.
Heavily retouched points may present problems in efforts to assess differential
stoneworking skills. If retouch has significantly changed the original appearance of a
point, evidence of the original manufacture may have been obscured by usage/retouch
that rendered it asymmetrical or eradicated the initial flaking patterns.
Finally, different reduction techniques also require slightly different approaches
for assessing skill in point manufacture. For example, many arrow points and some
dart points are modified flakes with inherently high width-to-thickness ratio and
symmetrical cross-section. Flaking symmetry and terminations assume greater
significance in skill assessments of these artifacts.
In order to account for these problems, each point was carefully examined for
retouch. When retouch was noted, skill assessments were recorded for both the initial
artifact manufacture and for the later retouching. Retouch skill is based on the same

197

criteria as manufacture skill, with particular attention paid to flake terminations
and point symmetry. Since retouch alters edge morphology, manufacturing skill for
retouched points was assessed by examining flaking terminations, flaking patterns,
flaking size, and cross-section symmetry as primary characteristics. Symmetry and edge
flaking patterns were not considered for these points since they appear to have been
altered by an individual other than the original manufacturer.
Summaries of point types recovered by time period are presented below, beginning
with the late Paleoindian phase. Included with each is its phase in Central Texas
chronology (Prewitt 1981a; see Chapter 2) and its series designation, if available (Jelks
1978; Prewitt 1995). Summaries include total number of points, specimen numbers,
and general descriptions of their condition, retouch, use-wear, and skill assessments.
Specimen numbers are used in reference to specific artifact descriptions. When possible,
skill levels are also noted for retouched blades. Illustrations of selected specimens from
each type depict differences in skill level and include representative examples of both
high and low skill levels. Points characterized by unusual morphology or patterning are
also illustrated.
Tables list the assessments of original manufacturing skill for types represented by
four or more specimens and also show length, width, thickness, and width-to-thickness
ratios as ranked by skill. Fragmented artifacts were not measured for all variables, in
which case the number (n) of specimens is listed below each skill ranking (1–5), while
the number of complete measurements is included in each data set.
Metric data for each point type are provided in Appendix E. Data for each type are
statistically summarized with maximum, minimum, mean, and standard deviation.
Appendix E also includes point type definitions and a discussion about untypable points.

Condition and Breakage: There are seven almost complete points in this category.
Three exhibit no breakage, two are missing only their distal tip, one is missing
half of its stem, and one has crushing around its distal end. Remaining specimens
consist of basal fragments with snap breakage; however, there are three specimens
with thermal breakage, and seven specimens have burins removed from the basal
or lateral edges. None of the points in this category exhibit any clear flaking
pattern. However, several specimens had well-executed billet flakes removed from
either face (Figure 7-5). One specimen (Figure 7-5 [c]) was recovered in apparent
close association with Burial 3, although the burial was dated to ca. 1300 B.P.,
suggesting that this specimen had been recycled and placed back into circulation.
Retouch: Retouch skill was assessed for twelve of these points. Most of the
retouched edges have consistent, short, parallel flakes removed from one or both
faces along the lateral edge. There are two points in retouch skill level 2, two in
level 3, four in level 4, and four in level 5; these are marked in parentheses in the
table below.
Skill Level: Three specimens are too fragmented to confidently assess skill. Five
specimens = skill level 1; five = skill level 2; fourteen = skill level 3; seven = skill
level 4; and six = skill level 5 (Table 7-2).

1069-1, 1123-5)
Condition and Breakage: Three specimens are complete. Of these, two are missing
their distal tip from impact snapping or crushing, while the last one has basal
crushing likely from hafting. Specimen 535-1 has thermal damage that removed
both lateral edges. Remaining specimens exhibited medial or distal snapping.
Specimens 187-2 and 535-1, have a rough collateral flaking pattern while the
remaining specimens lack patterning (see Figure 7-4 [d, e]).
Retouch: Four specimens exhibit retouching along their lateral edges. Three of
these have moderate symmetry and step terminations after retouch classifying
them as retouch skill 3. One of the retouched edges is retouch skill level 4.
Skill Level: One specimen = skill level 1, two = level 2, three = level 3, two = level
4, and two = level 5 (Table 7-3).

Condition and Breakage: Only specimen 187-4 is complete. The others have
multiple breaks, consisting of medial and shoulder snap breakage with basal
crushing. All of these artifacts lack a distinctive flake pattern (see Figure 7-4 [a,
b]).
Retouch: Two of the artifacts (187-4, 583-1) are beveled on the right lateral edge of
both faces. Many of the stems on these artifacts have been lightly retouched.
Skill Level: There is one point classified as skill level 2, three as level 3, one as
level 4, and two as level 5 (Table 7-4).

Condition and Breakage: There are eleven nearly complete specimens in this type.
Of these, 1213-1 and 1123-2 have no breakage, while the others have various types
of impact fracturing or crushing on the distal tip, basal edge, or barbs. Specimen
1213-1 was retouched through patina so it is likely that this was an earlier point
that was reworked into the Castroville style (Figure 7-6).
Retouch: Seven of the artifacts have retouching along their lateral edge. Three
of these are beveled on one lateral edge. Retouching was assessed for all of these
specimens and is summarized in Table 7-5.
Skill Level: All of these artifacts exhibit a random flaking pattern. Skill was
assessed for eighteen of these artifacts. Level 1 = 3, level 2 = 4, level 3 = 5, level 4 =
5, and level 5 = 3 (Table 7-5).

Condition and Breakage: One point is complete (1157-2). The others exhibit a
mixture of snap breaks and impact crushing near distal tip and basal edge (Figure
7-7 [a, b]).
Retouch: Two of the four artifacts are retouched and are listed in Table 7-6.
Skill Level: Artifact 1157-2 was classified as skill level 5 and has a well-executed
collateral flaking pattern on its dorsal face. Flake terminations feather cleanly,
without abrupt step or hinge fractures. The ventral face lacks clear patterning but
approaches collateral. The other points lack any clear flaking pattern.

Condition and Breakage: One of these specimens is complete (184-5) with no
breakage (Figure 7-7 [d]). Of the other six artifacts, most exhibit snap breaks with
the exception of 192-1, which has crushing on the basal edge and burin scarring
on its lateral edges. One (1220-8) has fine regular serration on both lateral edges
(Figure 7-7 [c]).
Retouch: Only two of the artifacts exhibit clear reworking as seen in their steeper
blade angle. However, these were not assessed for retouch skill.
Skill Level: All the artifacts lack a discernable flaking pattern. There are
two specimens in skill level 2, one in level 3, two in level 4, and one in level 5.
Specimen 259-4 is too fragmented to be evaluated for skill (Table 7-7).

Condition and Breakage: Nine specimens are nearly complete. Of those, three
have no breakage of any kind; four are missing parts of their shoulders, basal
edges, or distal tips due to impact fracturing. The final two nearly complete points
have burins removed from the basal edge. The remaining specimens comprise
proximal fragments exhibiting types of breakage including snapping, thermal
damage, crushing, and burinations (Figure 7-9).
Retouch: Fourteen specimens are retouched along one or both basal edges. Skill
was assessed for 13 of these: one in level 2, three in level 3, three in level 4, and six
in level 5 (Table 7-9).
Skill Level: Five points have a collateral flaking pattern, and all others lack
flaking pattern. Eight of the specimens are too small or too damaged to assess
skill. There are four specimens classified as skill level 1, six as level 2, eleven
as level 3, nine as level 4, and three as level 5. Skill levels and retouch skill are
summarized below.

Condition and Breakage: Three specimens are nearly complete. Two exhibit
no breakage of any kind, while one is missing part of its stem. The rest of the
specimens are proximal fragments that have a mixture of snapping and crushing.
Retouch: Two of these artifacts are retouched. Specimen 1220-5 is very skillfully
retouched with a chevron pattern and was classified as retouch skill level 5. The
other was classified as retouch skill level 4 (see Figure 7-8 [a, b]).
Skill Level: With the exception of specimen 1220-5, none of the specimens have
any clear flaking pattern. As detailed in Table 7-10, there is one artifact in skill
level 1, two in level 2, three in level 3, and two in level 4.

1220-50)
Condition and Breakage: There are four complete Darl specimens, one with
no breakage, two with tip snapping, and one with basal crushing. The rest are
proximal, stem fragments (n = 10). Impact snapping is the most common type
of breakage found, but there is also a thermal fracture and several burin breaks
(Figure 7-10).
Retouch: Retouch was evident on specimens 149-1, 411-2, 1172-5, 1190-2, and
1211-4. Three of these are beveled. Skill was assessed for all of these (Table 7-11).
Skill Level: Most of these artifacts lack a clear flaking pattern. However, patterns
emerge as skill level increases. Specimen 149-1 (level 3) and specimen 514-3 (level
4) have collateral flaking. Specimen 1180-1 (level 5) and specimen 1220-50 (level
4) have parallel oblique flaking. There are four specimens in skill level 1, seven in
level 2, three in level 3, three in level 4, and one in level 5. Three of the points are
too fragmented to be classified.

Condition and Breakage: Two
specimens are complete. The
fragmented ones are missing their distal
tips due to snap breakage. One tip was likely removed from a retouch error rather
than impact breakage. Two of the bases show crushing (Figure 7-13 [d, e]).
Retouch: Two blades are alternatively beveled from retouch. In total, half of the
points have clear evidence of retouch along the lateral edges. Retouch in both cases
were poor and ranked as retouch skill level 2.
Skill Level: Specimen 1160-1 has a collateral flaking pattern. All eight specimens

the blade edge or in steep flaking of the basal edge.
Skill Level: Most of the points are randomly flaked. Specimen 1157-7 is parallel
oblique, specimen 235-12 is irregular parallel collateral, and specimen 588-7 is
collateral patterned. There were three in level 5, three in level 4, six in level 3, three
in level 2, and one in level 1. Seven specimens had indeterminate skill (Table 7-13).

broken from impact damage (see Figure 7-15 [a]).

239-1, 246-1, 250-10, 288-1, 381-1, 1159-4, 1197-2)
Condition and Breakage: There are four nearly complete specimens in this group,
three of which have missing shoulders. One of these also is missing its tip from
impact. Snap fractures are the most common type of breakage on the remaining
fragments, though some points exhibit crushing on the base or tip. One is missing
both lateral blade edges and shoulders though it has retained parts of both faces
(see Figure 7-15 [c, d]).
Retouch: Five of the points are retouched along the lateral edges, sometimes quite
extensively. One point is retouched on the basal edge.
Skill Level: Three of the four complete points are asymmetrical and approximately
50 percent of the fragments are asymmetrical. All the points have a random
flaking pattern. Five of these are too small to assess for skill (Table 7-14). Of the
eleven remaining points, three are in level one, and each of the other levels has
two specimens.

Probable Perdiz Fragments
Phase: Toyah
Series: Blum
n = 9 (Specimen Nos. 13-1, 36-2, 40-3, 256-1, 263-1, 466-1, 469-6, 1046-6, 1148-1)
Condition and Breakage: Five of these fragments are missing all or part of
their stem, while the other four are medial fragments. Since the stem is the
most diagnostic part of the Perdiz type, these can be only tentatively identified.
However, they share other morphological characteristics common to Perdiz (Figure
7-16).
Retouch: Two of the fragments have rework along the lateral blade edges.
Skill Level: Six fragments are symmetrical. Most have a random flaking pattern,
but specimen 1046-6 has collateral flaking while specimen 263-1 exhibits irregular
parallel flaking. Since these were typed as “Probable Perdiz,” skill was assessed
using criteria similar to Perdiz points. There are two specimens in skill level 1, two
in level 2, three in level 3, one in level 4, and one in level 5 (Table 7-15).

Figure 7-16. Probable Perdiz points from Zatopec. These points are similar to Perdiz and
were assessed for skill using the same criteria. However, missing stems make accurate
typing uncertain.

point but the stem does not match these types. Two are lightly bifacially modified
and seem to be expedient projectile points (Figure 7-17).

Projectile Point Summary
A total of 288 projectile points and point fragments were recovered, of which 258
(89.9 percent) can be identified by type. Sixty-one of the typed points (23.64 percent)
come from contexts determined to be relatively intact and undisturbed (Table 7-16).
Minimally, these data indicate that Zatopec had been visited by groups over a time
span lasting almost 10,000 years. Considering the magnitude of this time span, only
a relatively small proportion of the site’s deposits are intact and useful for detailed
comparative analysis, a conclusion that is consistent with the geoarchaeological findings
presented in Chapter 4.

Since the factors affecting the production frequency of projectile points are not
fully understood , the use of these uncorrected data for additional analyses can be
problematic. For example, neither total nor adjusted point counts should be seen
as representative of regional population trends. Rather, for calculating simple site
visitation intensity per time period, as indicated by the frequency with which points
were discarded (including those not found in analytical units), raw counts should be
divided by the length of time of each period. Once adjusted, the site appears to have
been most heavily occupied in Late Archaic II times, ca. 2200–1250 B.P. (Figure 7-18).
However, this interpretation probably underrepresents Late Prehistoric occupations
since, in earlier periods dart points were made and used for a wider variety of tasks
than only serving as the tips for weapons whereas in Late Prehistoric periods arrow
points were made along with other kinds of bifaces that were used as knives and
general-purpose tools.

221

Certain point styles were more common at Zatopec than others (Figure 7-19), and
these data have the potential to indicate the range of some of the site’s long-distance
connections over time. However, viewed alongside certain kinds of regional information,
such as the prevalence of large-bodied game, they can also provide a general indication
of which point types should or should not be viewed as having been associated with
hunting large game. Although only an indirect measure of the kinds of gender-centered
labor arrangements of interest to the current study, correlations between point type
frequency and periods of heavy focus on the largest available game can help suggest
potential explanations for the popularity of some times.
Looking only at the frequency of different types, the most common types found
include Ensor (n = 41), Pedernales (n = 40), Perdiz and probable Perdiz (n = 25),
Scallorn (n = 23), Darl (n = 21), and Castroville (n = 19). Except for Lange (n = 10),
no other type is represented by more than eight specimens. Precisely dating these
specimens is problematic, and although Prewitt (2005) has placed the types in
chronological order with what appear to be fairly exact age estimates (also Collins
1995: Table 2), dates for types vary (slightly) from site to site and should be measured
as precisely as possible for each location for which typological data are used to address
other questions. Nevertheless, in looking at the frequency of the most common points
at Zatopec together with reconstructions of regional and site-specific bison abundance,
some tentative conclusions can be drawn.

Figure 7-18. Relative intensity of site occupation by time period, as indicated by
frequency with which points were discarded per 100 years. Total point counts are divided
by the length of each time period and the result is multiplied by 100.

223

Efforts to reconstruct regional bison populations have proved imprecise because of
the variability in herd size that occurred across large regions in response to weather
patterns, climate fluctuations, and available forage. Dillehay (1974) evaluated the
archaeological record of more than 160 sites in the Southern Plains and proposed periods
of bison presence and absence. Although some of these periods have been disproved in
subsequent studies of the same area, his Absence Period 2 and Presence Period 3 for
Central and South Texas have not been disputed (Huebner 1991; Toomey 1993). Other
compilations of regional records (Collins 1995), as well as site-specific data from Hall’s
Cave in Kerr County (Toomey 1993) help provide a larger context for considering bison
abundance in Central Texas (Figure 7-20). The latest study to address this issue is
Mauldin et al. (2009), who evaluated 141 components from 77 sites with Late Archaic
and Late Prehistoric components. They counted the number of identifiable specimens
(NISP), which include single bone elements, not complete animals, as an indication of
relative bison abundance. Although their counts can be skewed by single sites containing
many hundreds or thousands of elements, they provide the most up-to-date indication
of periods of bison abundance within the study area. Finally, two kinds of data about
bison abundance are available from Zatopec. First, identifiable elements are counted
and presented as a percentage of all identifiable elements in each AU (see Chapter 9).
However, it is probably that some mixing of elements between AUs is present, and these
figures might best be viewed as relative indications of bison frequency. In addition, 11
bone and teeth samples were submitted for dating. Although these were selected evenly
from all AUs, the returned assays reflect predominantly Toyah-age bison exploitation
(see Chapter 5). Of the 11 samples, eight reflect Toyah occupations and activities; one
(UGAMS-4429) returned a Late Archaic II age; one (UGAMS-4426) returned a Colonialera age; and one (UGAMS-4428) is either early historic or altogether modern. Based on
these samples, bison presence during other periods, AU2b and AU1b, is somewhat less
than is indicated by the actual distribution of elements.
Although dating key types is imprecise, some correlations between common types
and periods of bison abundance are evident at Zatopec.
Based on regional compilations of bison populations, only Darl points appear never
to have been associated with bison. in Central Texas, Scallorn and probably Pedernales
and Ensor types are also infrequently found with bison. Among the most commonly
recovered point types at Zatopec, only Perdiz and Castroville are consistently associated
with bison hunting in the region. Elsewhere, at Bonfire Shelter in Val Verde County
(Dibble and Lorrain 1967), Castroville points were found in Bone Bed 3 together with
Montell and Marcos points, indicating that these types are also sometimes associated
with bison hunting, as may also have been the case at Zatopec (although relatively
few of these two types were recovered). An easy explanation for the popularity of these
types is their importance in bison hunting during time periods when it was a significant
activity.

224

Figure 7-20. Regional patterns of bison abundance/absence as determined by various
studies, compared with point frequencies for the most common points at Zatopec. See
Chapter 9 for bison data from Zatopec.

225

Second, three of the most frequently recovered types (Ensor, Pedernales, and
Scallorn) were minimally associated with bison, at least at Zatopec and across Central
Texas. One possible explanation for the popularity of these types might be that they
were designed for and used by multiple task groups that included all kinds of people:
men, women, and perhaps children and older individuals. Periods of intense focus on
bison-hunting arguably represent strongly differentiated labor arrangements between
predominantly male big-game hunters and other members of the social group (including
women, the young and old, and some males). The fact that Darl, Pedernales, and
perhaps Ensor and Scallorn points occur in greater numbers when bison hunting was
not as important as other times raises the possibility that these implements were used
by many inclusive task groups who shared common work spaces and toolkits. Future
use-wear analyses of these types should prove useful in addressing this possibility.

226

Bifaces
Julian A. Sitters and Jon C. Lohse

As with other stone tool categories, bifaces offer evidence for the behavioral and
technological strategies pursued by prehistoric site occupants on the basis of task as
well as differential skill. The analysis of bifaces from Zatopec was designed to address
several questions. Do certain tool forms appear more commonly during some time
periods than others, and if so does the difference indicate changes in adaptive strategies
from one period to another, such as a change in mobility patterns or a declining
availability of suitable raw materials? Can patterns of biface production be identified
that help distinguish knappers on the basis of aptitude, and if so, how do these patterns
change over time? Can degrees of knapping expertise be recognized that might indicate
the presence of specialized toolmakers, at least during certain periods of site occupation,
or does the evidence from the lithic technology at Zatopec suggest that all toolmakers
were characterized by similar levels of ability?
Analysis of bifaces from Zatopec consists of two parts. One examines reductionrelated behavioral and technological trends by looking at bifaces identified as blanks
and performs that were discarded in various stages of reduction. The second involves
an examination of bifaces that were used. Most trends that are reflected in biface data
over time, for example by skill level or patterns of usage or recycling, are discussed in
Chapter 11.
Methodology
More than 1,000 bifaces and biface fragments were recovered from Zatopec, most
of which were identified as blanks or preforms. Blanks are bifacially chipped stone
pieces that were intended to become tools, such as projectile points. Preforms refer to a
subcategory of blanks that have acquired the general outline or shape of a specific tool
form, but are not yet complete (Johnson 1997:121). Both blanks and preforms are useful
for understanding technological behaviors relating to tool manufacture and the stone
reduction process. Of the remaining bifaces, some so-called formal tool forms identified
(by Elton Prewitt) are described here. These are included in this section because
they convey information about production trends, particularly concerning width-tothickness ratios, and exemplify shifts in manufacturing behavior during specific time
periods. Bifacial tool forms are described separately, following the discussion of bifacial
reduction behavior.
Bifaces recognized as preforms were sorted into four reduction stages: earlystage, intermediate-stage, late intermediate-stage, and late-stage preforms. Non-

227

preform bifaces include bifaces that are so asymmetrical and irregular that they defy
classification except as pieces possibly representing practice and learning-related
behavior. Non-preform bifaces also include formally defined tools such as Hare and San
Gabriel bifaces. After the initial sorting, additional descriptions were developed and
measurements taken of each artifact. These measurements were not the same for both
reduction pieces and tools, but depended on the kinds of information sought from each
category.
Each artifact was measured for length, width, and thickness to the nearest 0.1 mm
and then weighed to the nearest 0.1 g. Incomplete bifaces were identified as corner
fragments, medial fragments, end missing, end only (proximal or distal), or edge missing.
If present, breakage type was noted; fracture types include bend, perverse, burins,
and thermal fractures. Raw material characteristics such as cortex, patina, or heat
treatment were recorded. The intensity of inclusions was marked as heavy, moderate,
slight, or none. Coarseness of grain was evaluated on a 5-point scale (1–5) with 1
being the coarsest and 5 being the smoothest. The shape of the proximal, distal, and
medial sections was analyzed. The type of edge, sinuous versus straight, and types of
flake terminations, feather versus step/hinge, were also recorded. Fragments of larger
bifaces that were too small to describe were simply weighed, inspected for use-wear,
and analyzed as above. However, no measurements of length, width, or thickness were
recorded.
After this initial sorting, levels of apparent skill were assessed. Because stages of
reduction can be conflated with skill level (Lohse 2010), causing lower skill often to be
misidentified as early-stage reduction, these two attributes were described separately. As
with projectile points, only artifacts from the same technological category were compared
against each other for skill; no comparisons were made between or across perceived
stages of reduction or tool categories. For example, a highly skilled (level 5) intermediatestage biface, no matter how finely worked, would not exhibit enough of the necessary
characteristics to be considered a late-stage preform. Skill was evaluated on a scale of
1–5, with 1 indicating very poor skill and 5 reflecting the highest skill represented within
each category. Criteria used to assess skill include the overall crudeness or regularity
of form, flaking pattern (if any), the frequency of errors (step and hinge terminations,
stack formations, flake failures, etc.), outline symmetry, and the overall width of the
biface relative to its thickness. In order to minimize bias and impose consistency, skill
designations were made by the same person for all bifaces and bifacial tools. Discussions
about how these data changed over time are presented in Chapter 11.

228

Bifacial Reduction Behavior
Four stages were defined to characterize biface reduction at Zatopec. The first stage,
early-stage bifaces, is typified by a crudely established form, asymmetrical in plan
view and cross section, at least some cortex, the lack of intensive flaking on at least
one side, and steep edge angles. Intermediate-stage bifaces include pieces that show an
established form; have recognizable proximal, medial and distal sections; and retain a
small amount of cortex usually (though not always) located near the center of each face.
The third stage, late-intermediate bifaces, is distinguished from the second category
by a more clearly established outline. The final stage, late-stage preforms, generally
has low edge angles, well-established forms, an absence of retouched lateral margins
(indicating completed pieces), and blanks that were broken during the final thinning
stage. These categories are recognized as analytical constructs that permit comparisons
between earlier and later stages of biface production. Moving through the reduction
sequence, biface thickness decreases, lateral edges become straighter, bulb scars from
shaping flakes become increasingly diffuse, and final tool form becomes more apparent.
All artifact measurements are included in Appendix F. Each reduction stage is
discussed below, and representative examples are described and illustrated. Following
the discussions of reduction stages, technological trends that are evident in the biface
reduction data for each of the analytical units are discussed.

Figure 7-21. Early-stage bifaces representing skill level 2 (top) and skill level 5 (bottom).

229

Reduction Stage 1: Early-Stage Bifaces (n = 26)
Twenty-six bifaces were classified as Early-Stage Bifaces, 18 of which were complete
(Table 7-17). Three artifacts reflect the high degree of variability among the earlystage bifaces. Specimen 172-3 (Figure 7-21) is an asymmetrical, thick, ovate biface
(skill level 2). Multiple step terminations are present along the lateral edges, and a
few feather terminations appear on the midsection of the artifact. Lateral edges are
sinuous and one face is composed almost entirely of cortex. The raw material grain is
coarse and has a moderate amount of inclusions. Specimen 1185-2 shows very similar
characteristics. Specimen 1180-28 is a symmetrical ovate biface (skill level 5) with
very little cortex. Many feather terminations and a few step terminations are present.
The artifact has long and narrow flake removals originating at the proximal and distal
ends and shorter flake scars originating from the lateral edges. One face is only lightly
worked in comparison with the opposite face. Some platform preparation in the form of
edge trimming is also present along the lateral edges. At one end of the artifact a steep
angled bevel is present, possibly as a way of rejuvenating the platform surface. One
lateral edge is sinuous and the other lateral edge is relatively straight. The grain of the
raw material is finer than the previous specimen 172-3.

Reduction Stage 2: IntermediateStage Bifaces (n = 87)
The second category of biface reduction
includes bifaces that are more refined
along length, width, and/or thickness and
have better-defined outlines than the
previous category. Edges are straighter,
and bulb scars are less pronounced
compared to early-stage bifaces. This
category contains 87 specimens, only
eight of which are complete (Table
7-18). Specimen 175-2 (Figure 7-22) is a
thick, vaguely lanceolate-shaped biface
(skill level 1). The specimen is highly
asymmetrical and its lateral edges are
extremely sinuous and have pronounced
bulb scars in relation to other bifaces
within this category. The specimen is
made from moderately fine-grained
material with minor inclusions. Many
feather terminations exist, as well as
multiple step and hinge terminations.
Cortex is present along the lateral edges
and on both faces of the biface, and a
stack formation is present on one face.
Specimen 82-3 provides another excellent
example of an intermediate-stage biface
exhibiting a low skill level (skill level 1).
Specimen 1123-30 is designated as skill
level 5. This biface is fractured, making it
difficult to determine its symmetry. It is
thin with a convex proximal end, and the
lateral edges are straight with diffused
bulb scars. The material grain quality
is finer, yet contains more inclusions
than the other two specimens chosen to
exemplify this category. Many feather
terminations exist, as well as a two step
terminations located near lateral edges.
Most flake scars are long and narrow, and
originate from the lateral edges.

Reduction Stage 3: Late Intermediate-Stage Bifaces (n = 249)
The third category includes bifaces that have an established outline and are
generally thinner and shorter and/or narrower than previous categories. Most of the
artifacts in this category are made from high quality, very fine-grained chert. This
category includes 249 specimens, only 16 of which are complete. Length, width, and
thickness for artifacts from which these measurements could be obtained are shown in
Table 7-19. Specimen 1220-29 (Figure 7-23) is a good example from this category. This
artifact (skill level 1) is a complete, oval-shaped biface that is moderately symmetrical
with patina present at the distal end. Lateral edges are sinuous and pronounced bulb
scars remain along the perimeter. Abrupt hinge and step terminations are common on
both faces. In longitudinal cross-section, this biface is very irregular. The proximal end
is notably thicker than the distal end because of difficulties the knapper experienced
when thinning the proximal end. Specimens 156-2, 274-1, and 1180-21 are also good
examples of low-skill, late intermediate-stage bifaces.
Specimen 1157-14, a thin oval biface (Figure 7-24) is an example of a highly
skilled specimen (skill level 5) from this category. The biface is symmetrical in both
plan and longitudinal cross-section, with only slightly sinuous edges. A few step and
hinge terminations are present, but the large majority of flake removals have feather
terminations. A stack is present on one face of the biface. The knapper attempted to
remove the stack formation from multiple directions, including from both lateral edges,
reflecting a high degree of skill and knowledge of problem-solving relating to thinning

232

bifaces. The stack could not be corrected, and rather than risk breaking the piece by
repeatedly attempting removals, the knapper appears to have simply set it aside. Other
examples of highly skilled (all skill level 5) late intermediate-stage bifaces include
specimens 102-1, 204-2, and 1157-17. Specimen 102-1 was broken in manufacture, as
were 204-2 and 1157-17, but two pieces were recovered in excavation, allowing analysts
to reconstruct the form of this biface.

Reduction Stage 4: Late-Stage Preform (n = 117)
The final category of reduced bifaces is late-stage preforms. These bifaces tend to
be thinner and shorter than all other bifaces within the reduction sequence. They also
have distinct forms, and represent a higher quality chert. This category contains 117
specimens, 15 of which are complete (Table 7-20). Several examples illustrate some of
the technical aspects of this category. Specimen 1067-3 (Figure 7-25) is an asymmetrical
biface categorized as a skill level 1. The lateral edges are straight with diffused bulb
scars. Feather as well as step and hinge terminations define flake scars. A stack exists
on one face with removal attempts from two different directions. Edge modification is
present along one lateral edge near the proximal end. Other examples of skill level 1
include 178-2 and 190-16. Examples of late-stage preforms classified as skill level 5
include specimen 4-1, a thin triangular biface. This artifact is highly symmetrical with
straight edges and diffused bulb scars. Flake patterning is mainly composed of feather

233

terminations, although a few step terminations exist. The artifact is patinated and has
a slightly beveled blade, indicating slight reworking. Other examples include specimens
39-3 and 1220-22.

Biface Reduction Summary
The reduction categories described above allow a general characterization of biface
reduction at Zatopec. The size of the bifaces diminishes dramatically from the first stage
of reduction to the last stage within the sequence; this reduction is evident in artifact
thickness, length, width, as well as weight (Figure 7-26). This trend probably reflects
the fact that chert nodules become smaller as mass is removed through flaking in the
process of manufacturing bifaces and finished tool forms. Along the way, intended forms
become more apparent, and bulb scars become less pronounced and more diffused from
the beginning to the end of the sequence. We interpret the increasing diffusion of bulb
scars as an indication of the increasing use of soft rather than hard hammer percussion
in later stages of reduction. Chert quality varies from stage to stage, but within the
later stages of biface reduction becomes uniformly higher in quality.
Variation in skill is seen in each of the reduction stages, with late-stage preforms
exhibiting higher average skill as an assemblage than earlier stages (Figure 7-27). In
assessing trends in skill by stage of reduction stage, we designed a measurement called
skill index. This value represents the percentage of expressed skill of total possible
skill for an assemblage. We calculate skill index by assigning a value of 1–5 (skill
level 1 = 1, skill level 2 = 2, skill level 3 = 3, etc.) for each artifact in a reduction stage
of a given skill level classification, and then dividing the total assigned value by the
maximum possible if all artifacts in a reduction stage had been classified as skill level
5. Results indicate that, on average, expressed knapping skill increases with each stage
of reduction. A slight dip is present between the two intermediate stages, although
this decrease is very small and we view it as a reflection of the arbitrary nature of

Figure 7-26. Average dimensions of bifaces by reduction stage. All stages consistently
become smaller by every dimension with further reduction.

235

the reduction stage categories used in this study. In other words, whereas earlystage reduction and near final-stage reduction are easily identified with confidence,
intermediate forms should probably be understood as phases rather than specific
stages. What these index scores indicate is that the work of better-skilled knappers is
well represented in late-stage preforms and that the work of lesser-skilled knappers
characterizes earlier stages of reduction. These data begin to indicate unevenly
organized biface production at Zatopec in that not all biface makers performed their
tasks with the same aptitude.

Figure 7-27. Skill indices by reduction stage of all bifaces from Zatopec.

Bifacial Tools
Bifaces recovered from Zatopec, including formally categorized tools such as Clear Fork
adzes and drills as well as irregular bifacial objects that cannot be classified, also bear
on questions of technological organization and tool-making behavior. Informal tools
that are technologically bifacial but difficult to analyze for reduction behavior are also
included in this analytic group. These tool include choppers and other items used on an
ad hoc basis as knives, scrapers, and for other activities.
Irregular and Asymmetrical Bifaces (n = 44)
Some bifaces recovered from Zatopec are so irregular and asymmetrical that they
cannot be placed into formal tool categories, nor do they easily conform to the four
reduction stages described above. These artifacts are interpreted as a manifestation
of learning and practice by individuals who were either acquiring certain knapping
skills or honing particular techniques. These items exhibit poorly defined outlines;

236

inconsistent flaking patterns; and are markedly unpatterned in symmetry, material
choice, and retouch. Some reflect failed attempts at achieving a desired form, and others
show no apparent form whatsoever. The perimeters of these bifaces display weakly
patterned flaking, repeated failed flake removals, early terminations (step and hinge
fractures), and battered edges. Some of these bifaces appear to have been made on large
flakes, and others are reduced fragments of bifaces that broke at some stage of the
reduction process. Bifaces in this category rarely exhibit clear signs of use.
As a group, these bifaces exhibit evidence of overall low but highly variable skill,
and at present the information they may convey about reduction processes or tool
manufacture is not understood. Accordingly, assessing skill or degrees of reduction
on any of these pieces was extremely difficult, and no attempt was made to quantify
it. Moreover, because of their irregular outlines, proximal and distal ends could not
be identified with certainty. Therefore, resulting measurements (Table 7-21) are only
approximations that generally characterize ranges of size and weight of these artifacts.
Selected examples are shown in Figure 7-28.

Hare Biface (n = 3)
Time Period: Transitional Archaic
n = 3 (Specimen Nos. 482-3, 517-2,

Hare bifaces are long and slender with convex lateral edges and distinct, pronounced
basal corners. Bases are generally straight to convex in form (Prewitt 1974). Three
artifacts meet these criteria, two of which are complete (Figure 7-29; Table 7-22). None
of these artifacts is associated with an analytical unit.

Pipe Creek Biface (n = 2)
Time Period: Late Prehistoric
n = 2 (Specimen Nos. 474-1, 1030-1)
Pipe Creek bifaces have one corner notch and two lateral edges of different lengths
that form a right triangle. The longer of the two lateral edges is generally straight, but
may also be slightly convex (Tuner and Hester 1993). Two artifacts from Zatopec, both
of which are fragmented, fall into this category (Figure 7-30; Table 7-23). Wear in the
form of small flake scars is present along the lateral edges of both specimens.

Corner Tang Biface (n = 1)
Time Period: Late Archaic
n = 1 (Specimen No. 1180-2)
Corner tang bifaces are relatively rare and are often found in burial contexts. They
are most commonly found in Central and south Central Texas, including along and
above the Balcones Escarpment. These artifacts show a lot of variation, but the most
common variety has a tang notched into one corner of the base (Turner and Hester
1993: 250). The function(s) of these artifacts are unknown, but some display evidence
of hafting for use as a knife (Mitchell and Orchard 1984). The specimen from Zatopec
was recovered during scraping at the site, and is therefore without context. It is finely
worked, with asymmetrical, slightly convex lateral edges (Figure 7-31).
Granbury Biface (n = 4)
Time Period: early Late Prehistoric
n = 4 (Specimen Nos. 13-3, 617-2, 1123-12, 1180-4)
Granbury bifaces have been described as “unstemmed triangular bifaces with
straight to slightly convex lateral edges with a convex base” (Prewitt 1982:71). Four
artifacts from Zatopec fall within this category (Figure 7-32), none of which is complete
(Table 7-24). Only one was found associated with an analytical unit.

Covington Biface (n = 4)
Time Period: Toyah Phase
n = 4 (Specimen Nos. 347-1, 394-1, 1123-32, 1184-2)
Covington bifaces generally have round or convex proximal ends and sharply pointed
distal tips. Lateral edges are parallel from the base to approximately one third of the
total length of the biface, and then taper to a point (Jelks 1962:42–43). Four artifacts,
none of which is complete, fall within this category (Figure 7-33). Measurements that
could be accurately ascertained are included in Table 7-25. None of these bifaces was
recovered from secure, datable context.

n = 7 (Specimen Nos. 142-7, 177-11, 197-1, 294-1, 375-1, 614-1, 1187-1)
The San Gabriel biface has been described as a “broad, triangular biface which has
recurved to gently convex lateral edges, sharply defined basal corners and a slightly
concave base” (Turner and Hester 1993:273). These bifaces were originally identified
by Prewitt (1981a). Seven San Gabriel bifaces were identified at Zatopec, none of which
is complete (Figure 7-34). These artifacts all show proficient use of soft hammer, billet
flaking to remove broad, thin flakes from proportionately thin bifaces. Therefore, they
appear to reflect a relatively higher degree of flintknapping skill than is seen on many
other bifaces found among the reduction categories described earlier. Measurements
from these artifacts are shown in Table 7-26.

Biface Fragments
Excavations at Zatopec recovered 328 biface fragments that could not be placed into
any category because of their small size. Each was weighed, and the grain size and raw
material was recorded. When possible, they were sorted according to the part of the
biface they were believed to represent: edge only, corner piece, edge missing, end only
(distal or proximal), end missing, medial fragment, or unidentifiable. However, these
fragments were not measured for length, width, or thickness, nor were they evaluated
by skill level. Recorded attributes for all biface fragments can be found in Appendix F.

Flake Tools

and

Formal Unifaces

Spencer LeDoux and Jon C. Lohse

A total of 7,375 flake tools were recovered from Zatopec. Of these, 61 were classified
as formal unifaces and the rest are flake tools. Formal unifaces have flake scars
over the majority of their dorsal face, assume a standard form, and have unmodified
ventral surfaces. Often, modification has completely altered the original morphology
of the flake to the point that its original size and shape cannot be determined (Hall et
al. 1982:348). Flake tools have been traditionally defined as expedient tools, quickly
suitable for use with minimal preparation but with low reliability. As expedient tools,
they were infrequently maintained and were often discarded in favor of a new tool
when they acquired a significant degree of wear. Flake tools include any flake that is
unifacially edge-modified or used, but the dorsal face of which exhibits only minor or no
modification. The diagnostic trait that distinguishes flake tools from formal unifaces is
that the original morphology of the flake remains evident after use-wear and/or edge
modification (see “Trimming Flakes” in Hall et al. 1982:357).
Flake tools were initially separated into four categories based on macroscopic traits:
utilized with platform, utilized without platform, edge modified with platform, and edge
modified without platform (Figures 7-35, 7-36). Following Young and Bamforth (1990),
artifacts in the utilized and edge-modified categories were combined for analysis. Some
utilized flakes may have been missed since no microscopic use-wear was performed.
However, combining these subgroups into the larger category of flake tools avoids
biasing results from incorrectly assigned artifacts (see Read and Russell 1996).
In the current analysis, technological descriptions are provided for flake tool types
and patterns of use and manufacture. However, by nature these items are difficult to
classify consistently according to form. The main focus of this analysis was therefore
to document trends in how flake tools might have been designed and procured, and
in how intensively flake tools were used over different time periods. Together, these
data contribute to the discussion of expediency in relation to maintainability as a
technological strategy for forager populations at Zatopec and to what this meant for
patterns of labor allocation and perhaps for gendered labor relations. Data and trends
are presented here, and larger patterns and their possible implications are developed
further in Chapter 11.
Sample Selection
A 10 percent sample from the total number of flake tools was chosen for analysis.
The sample was selected by employing a multistage sampling approach (Orton 2000:33).

246

Figure 7-35. Examples of the flake tools recovered from a Late Archaic II context. All
examples are from lot 592: A, B, and C are edge modified without platform; and D, E,
and F are utilized with platform.

edge-modified without platform (lot 383); and (c, d) utilized without platform (lot 267).

247

As previously stated, flake tools were separated from formal unifaces. Flake tools
that did not fall into an analytical unit were removed from analysis (see Chapter 3 for
discussion of analytical units). This sorting produced one cluster of tools consisting of
the formal unifaces and one cluster of flake tools from each of seven analytical units: AU
1, AU 1a, AU 1b, AU 2, AU 2a, AU 2b, and AU 3. Because there was a small number of
formal unifaces and a small number of artifacts in the AU 3 cluster, all 91 artifacts from
these two clusters were chosen for analysis.
The remaining six clusters consisted of 2,338 artifacts from AU 1–AU 2b. A 30
percent sample (701 artifacts), combined with the 91 artifacts already selected, yielded
the 10 percent sample for analysis from the entire uniface assemblage. The artifacts
chosen for analysis were selected following a simple random sampling approach (Orton
2003:33). Simple random sampling takes a fixed percentage (or a fixed sampling
fraction) from each analytical unit. For example, since there are six remaining groups,
each analytical unit would provide 16.67 percent (1/6) of the remaining artifacts for
analysis. However, this method risks an imbalance in the representative size of each
sample group (Orton 2003:30). An imbalance was highly likely in this analysis since
the total number of artifacts recovered from each analytic unit varied dramatically.
In stratified random sampling, the sample fraction (percentage of the artifacts in the
cluster to be analyzed) is adjusted to be proportional to the number of artifacts in the
cluster. The proportional percentage is obtained by dividing the raw count of a cluster
by the total number of artifacts in the category. This proportional percentage is then
multiplied by the total number of artifacts needed for analysis (in this instance 701).
Table 7-27 summarizes the number of artifacts needed from each cluster to meet a
10 percent total sample. The actual number of artifacts chosen for analysis varies
slightly since they remained grouped by lots. The selection of lots to be analyzed was
taken by arbitrarily selecting bags from a box containing all flake tools from a specific
analytical unit. The number of artifacts was recorded, and selection continued until the
proportional sample had been reached or exceeded.

unit cluster in order to obtain a stratified random sample based on the size of each

Methodology
Analysis followed the method developed by Prilliman and Bousman (1998) for flake
tool analysis at the Wilson-Leonard site in Williamson County. First, the maximum
length, width, and thickness of each artifact were measured with calipers to the nearest
0.1 mm. The artifacts were then weighed to the nearest 0.1 g. The circumference of each
uniface and flake tool was measured by wrapping a nylon string around the flake edge.
The string was 2 mm in diameter and approximately 50 cm long. A black line from a
fine-tipped permanent marker was placed 2–3 cm away from both edges of the string
in order to allow the analyst to securely grip the string. The string was then wrapped
around the circumference of the artifact as near as possible to the ventral face. After
marking the ending position with a thumbnail, the string was laid out along a ruler.
Because this method is less exact than calipers, circumference was measured to the
nearest millimeter.
Total Edge Modification (TEM) and Potential Edge Modification (PEM) were
measured in the same way. TEM is defined as any edge that shows continuous flake
scarring for at least 2 mm along its length. PEM is the modified edge combined with
any unmodified edge that could have been flaked. PEM excludes the platform and any
fractured edges (see Prilliman and Bousman 1998:598, Figure 17-1). Finally, a ratio
was calculated by dividing the Total Edge Modification (TEM) by the Potential Edge
Modification (PEM). This ratio is referred to as the TEM:PEM; when multiplied by 100,
it indicates the intensity of artifact usage as a percentage to three decimal places.
Various nonmetric observations were also recorded for unifacial tools. The edge
angle of all artifacts was recorded as either steep or shallow. Shallow angles were those
that appeared to be 45 degrees or less, and steep angles were 45 degrees or more. On
formal unifaces, the locations and number of modified edges were noted. Retouch on
formal unifaces was recorded as either regular (flakes scars of similar size and shape) or
irregular; continuous or discontinuous (single scars or random overlapping scarring less
than 4mm in length); and invasive (scars that proceed more than 1 cm from the edge)
(Prilliman and Bousman 1998).
Statistics
In addition to the chi-square test and Haberman’s residual analysis (see Debitage
discussion, below), Pearson’s r was used to analyze a scatter plot of the TEM:PEM
ratio in each cultural era (Figure 7-37). Pearson’s r is a type of correlation analysis
that shows the strength of each trend. Values of r range from -1.0 to +1.0. The closer
the value approaches +/- 1.0, the stronger the relationship between the two variables
(Caldwell 2007). The value of r was then squared and multiplied by 100 to calculate the
coefficient of determination, shown as a percentage and indicating the amount of one
variable that is determined by another. The TEM:PEM ratio was charted with PEM

249

being the X-axis value, and TEM being the Y axis value. A line of best fit was then
placed using Microsoft Excel in order to better exemplify the trend.

the right shows the Z score of each X value being multiplied by the Z score of each Y
value and then summed (Caldwell 2007:279).

Flake Tool Analysis
As a general trend, flake tools become more common over time. Adjusted for time (see
discussion of method in Chapter 3), the frequency of flake tools shows a small dip from
the Middle Archaic to Late Archaic I, after which they increase steadily through time.
The higher number of tools in the Middle Archaic could reflect a bias resulting from
the small sample size. Over time, however, flake tools clearly become more numerous
(Figure 7-38). Perhaps the best explanation for this trend is steadily increasing
population figures for the region.
We wanted to determine not only how many flake tools were present from different
time periods, but also whether any trends were evident in how flake tools were designed
or used over time. The average dimensions of each tool and the standard deviation
of these measurements indicate no significant change in size, weight, or variation

beginning in the Late Archaic I and continuing through the Toyah Phase.

of flake tools, reflecting the wide variation in tool size from each cultural era. Edge
angles of each flake were then subjected to the chi-square test, which also failed to
define a significant relationship between edge angle and cultural era ( χ2 = 5.68, dƒ =
4, p = 0.224). Next, the Total Edge Modification (TEM) to Potential Edge Modification
(PEM) ratio was calculated and compared in order to identify possible changes in how
intensively flake tools were used over time (Figure 7-39). Results indicated that, with
a slight exception from Late Archaic II to Austin, flake tools were steadily used more
intensively through time, peaking significantly in Toyah times.
Next, TEM:PEM ratios that had been calculated for each tool were placed on a
scatter plot, and a corresponding trend line was applied for each cultural period in
Microsoft Excel. When all trend lines were compared (Figure 7-40), it appeared that
edge modification steadily increased across all cultural eras. This was true for the
Austin phase, even though the average TEM:PEM ratio decreased during that time
(see Figure 7-40). In order to quantify the strength of the upward trend in TEM:PEM
ratio, Pearson’s r was calculated. A strong relationship (> 0.6) between TEM and PEM
was indicated for the Middle Archaic, Late Archaic I, and Late Archaic II, whereas
the Austin and Toyah phases exhibited a very strong (> 0.8) relationship (Caldwell
2007:281). As stated previously, Pearson’s r is squared to obtain the coefficient of
determination. The r2 statistic showed a growing correlation between the total edge
modified and the potential edge modified for each period (Figure 7-41) and confirmed
the other data. These data established that flake tools, traditionally understood as
expedient tools and requiring (or reflecting) little to no planning, design, or effort at
maintaining their utility over time, were steadily used more intensively over time, and
thus became less expedient. This appeared true even as the overall numbers of flake

period. The increasing average TEM:PEM ratio over time suggests that these tools were
used more intensively through time.

Figure 7-40. Trend lines of TEM:PEM ratios for each time period. The fact that trend lines
steadily increased (became steeper) from Middle Archaic to Toyah confirms that flake
tools were more intensively used through time.

tools increased, implying not only quantitative but also qualitative changes in labor
patterns through time. Not only were more people making or using flake tools (perhaps
as a result of increasing populations), but these tools were being used more intensively.
This conclusion has implications for the role of flake tools in evolving hunter-gatherer
economies at Zatopec, and is discussed in detail in Chapter 11.

252

Complete Flake Tool Analysis
Next, complete flake tools were evaluated against the larger flake tool assemblage
to learn what kinds of flakes were selected for use. If flakes from biface production,
including specific types of billet flakes known as distinctive expanding billet flakes (or
DEBs) and r flakes (see debitage analysis section below for descriptions of DEBs and
r flakes), were often used as tools compared with other kinds of flakes, then analysts
could postulate a close overlap between biface makers and people who used expedient
tools. In this scenario, these two task groups would be less easily distinguished in
the material record. In contrast, if billet flakes were not used as often as other flakes,
analysts could hypothesize that distinctions between these labor groups were clear
and distinct, making it less likely that individuals who made bifaces were the same
individuals who processed resources in and around camp. Alternatively, if they were the
same people, then the fact that billet flakes were rarely used as tools may indicate rigid
work scheduling or clear distinctions in the organization of work space. Furthermore,
it should be possible to identify changes in strategies used by expedient tool-users to
procure their tool kit. If certain kinds of flakes were directly manufactured for use
as tools, analysts could postulate that these task groups were more directly involved
in the production of their own gear. In contrast, if available material in the form of
waste flakes generated through other or earlier activities was preferentially used, then
analysts could hypothesize that expedient tool-users were increasingly dependant on
the labor of other task groups.
In this analysis, it was important to examine flakes that retained enough striking
platform to be identified as billet or non-billet flakes. A complete flake tool is defined
as a flake that shows use-wear or edge modification and has a striking platform and an
intact distal end with a feather or hinge termination. Complete flake tools were sorted
into thinning flakes, non-thinning flakes, DEBs, and r flakes (see debitage analysis
section for description of DEBs and r flakes). Flake tools were assessed for patina,
dorsal cortex, and platform preparation. Platform smoothness was also assessed in
order to compare the time spent in platform preparation, seen as evidence of increasing
knapper understanding of requirements for flake removals and time spent on that task.
Thinning flakes were the most common flakes used as tools, followed by nonthinning flakes. DEBs consistently remained about 10 percent of the flake tool
assemblage (Figure 7-42). An interesting trend seen when comparing the number of
complete tools to all flake tools in each cultural era was that the number of flake tools
on complete flakes steadily declined from Late Archaic I to Toyah (Figure 7-43). It
appears that flake completeness became less important in the selection of flakes used as
tools. This might be explained by people picking up flakes made in earlier times to use
as expedient tools.
To characterize the kinds of flakes used as tools and to look for connections between
flake characteristics and cultural eras, the observed measurements taken for cortex,

Figure 7-43. Percentage of complete flakes used as tools over time.

patina, and platform preparation were all analyzed using the chi-square test. In most
respects, trends remained similar across time, but with some exceptions.
For cortex, flakes were classified based on the amount of cortex they retained on
their dorsal surfaces. Categories included 0 percent, 1–33 percent, 33–66 percent, 66–99
percent, and 100 percent. One sharp change that was noted is in the increase in 1–33
percent cortical flakes from the Austin to the Toyah phases (Figure 7-44). This jump

254

phase shows a statistically distinct change in patterning.

is a significant deviation from the previous pattern (χ2 = 18.41, p = .05; z = 2.68, p =
.01). Since chert was locally available at the site (Garber 1987), it is not likely that the
increase in 1–33 percent cortical flakes is a function of limited resources. More probable
is that Toyah flake-tool users preferentially selected these kinds of flakes.
Patina is a weathering process occurring on the surface of chert as it is exposed to
natural elements over prolonged periods of time. Patinated items in an assemblage
indicate that materials were lying exposed, perhaps on the surface, for prolonged
periods before being buried. Patinated objects that show subsequent flaking into the
patina can be recognized as items that had been discarded earlier (how much earlier
is unknown) and then later picked up and modified for use. The occurrence of patina
on flake tools showed a definite increase in Toyah times over earlier periods both in
patinated tools and in tools with patina that were subsequently modified (Figure 7-45.
Although the increase in Toyah patinated tools is not particularly significant (χ2 = 7.45,
dƒ = 6, p = 0.28), the fact that more pieces that had been deposited in earlier periods
were being reused indicates that gleaning (recycling flakes that had been deposited
earlier) was increasingly important as a strategy employed by flake tool-users to procure
materials for carrying out their tasks. This is particularly noteworthy considering
that patinated flakes showing later flaking actually decrease in Toyah (see debitage
discussion, below). This finding supports the earlier conclusion that many of the flake
tools recovered from Toyah contexts were actually made in earlier times.

255

Figure 7-45. Percentages of flake tools showing patination, and modification after
patination, over time.

Finally, we examined platform preparation and crushing on flake tools in order
to evaluate technological relationships between people who made and then used
flakes as tools, and those who may have been occupied more specifically with flaking
as a part of biface production. Theoretically, platforms on flakes removed in biface
production should demonstrate varying degrees of preparation, including smoothing,
isolation, and multi-faceting. All of these techniques strengthen the striking platform,
helping to ensure that it will withstand the pending blow for flake detachment. In
contrast, unprepared platforms are either structurally weaker, reflecting poor knapper
understanding of the mechanics of flake removal, or are more difficult to ascribe to
biface production. Consequently, many (not all) unprepared platforms are seen as the
result of specifically flake production from flake cores. Crushed platforms can occur
either in biface manufacture or flake removal from cores as a result of too much force
being applied to a (structurally inadequate) platform. These are common errors in
flake removal. Platforms were classified as prepared, unprepared, and crushed. When
quantified by time period, a couple of trends are seen (Figure 7-46). Prepared platforms
remain approximately constant over time, with some fluctuation during Late Archaic
I. This means that most of the variance in platform condition on flake tools is between
unprepared and crushed platforms. During the Toyah phase, crushed platforms
dramatically exceed non-prepared platforms for the first time. The chi-square test with
Haberman’s residual analysis show that there was a statistically significant decrease in
non-prepared platforms that occurred at the same time that a statistically significant
increase occurred in the frequency of crushed platforms between the Austin and Toyah
phases (Table 7-28). Researchers can easily view this as an indication that, among

256

knappers who were striking flakes for use as tools in Toyah times, there was a marked
increase in failure rates over earlier periods. These data suggest that, during Toyah,
many people making flakes to be used as tools were less proficient at flake detachment
than earlier people had been.

Discussion
Flake tool size varied within each time period, but did not vary much between
periods (becoming slightly smaller during Austin times; Figure 7-47). In general, flake
tools became both more numerous and more intensively used over time, especially in
Toyah. We see this as evidence both for increasing populations and for increasing use
of tools. Flake type, dorsal cortex, and patination did not vary much from one cultural
era to another, except that patinated-but-recycled flakes and flakes with 1–33 percent
cortex both increased in Toyah. These data suggest that more flakes were being gleaned

257

Figure 7-47. Average dimensions of flake tools over time.

for use as tools, and that some flakes having particular characteristics (at least those
having 1–33 percent cortex) were sought for use as tools. Furthermore, the increase
in poor knapping seen in crushed platforms in Toyah suggests that people striking
flakes to be used as tools were less proficient at this task than in any other time period
considered in this analysis.
Overall, one of the marked trends demonstrated here is the shift away from
expediency toward curation as defined by Binford (1973, 1977). As outlined more fully in
Chapter 11, curation can refer to both the practice of maintaining tools over long periods
of time, as well as of completely exhausting a tool before discard, or maximizing a tool’s
potential utility before discarding it (also Chapter 1). Increased flake tool curation is
indicated here by a greater intensity of usage as noted by the ratio of the Total Edge
Modified to Potential Edge Modified. As this ratio increases, more of the potential
tool edge was utilized. Both the average TEM:PEM ratio, and r2 indicate an increased
tendency over time to exhaust flake tools before discard. Another trend includes how
flakes were procured by Toyah-period flake tool users. Gleaning (picking up pieces
previously discarded) increased as a strategy for procuring flakes suitable for use as
tools. This is indicated both in the decrease in complete flakes used as tools in Toyah

258

times, and also in the moderate increase of patinated yet retouched modified or utilized
flakes. When viewed alongside evidence of reduced proficiency at removing flakes,
indicated by higher rates of platform crushing, Toyah-period flake makers appear to
have been increasingly alienated from the technological means of production necessary
for maintaining their tool kits, both in terms of material and technological expertise,.
Formal Unifaces and Flake Tools
The 61 unifaces recovered from Zatopec, some categorized as formal types, are grouped
into six morphological categories: Clear Fork, end scraper, denticulate, and graver; and
two others that occurred in great enough numbers that they were designated from the
general modified flake category: we termed these regular form, and amorphous. Each
is described below. Although some of these categories imply function (e.g., graver), no
micro-wear analysis was performed. All unifaces are tools with extensive modification
over the majority of the dorsal face. Edge modification has completely altered the size
and shape of the flake to such an extent that its original morphology is undetermined
(Hall et al. 1982). Unfortunately, only nine of these unifaces were found in analytical
units, making statements about their occurrence through time impractical. Summary
measurements were taken for each category.
In addition to basic descriptions and measurements, each artifact in these categories
was measured for actual versus potential use in the same way described for flake tools,
described above. PEM:TEM ratios were calculated, and these data all unifaces to be
compared in a similar fashion with flake tools (so-called expedient tools) to assess
changes in expediency as a design goal for toolkits at Zatopec over time.
End Scrapers
(n = 13, Specimen Nos: 40-6, 94-3, 109-1, 166-1, 461-1, 525-8, 584-2, 1143-9, 1145-5,
1157-32, 1157-33, 1157-34, and 1176-6 )
This category contains artifacts marked by a steep modified edge on their distal
ends. Many also have a pronounced dome on the distal end of the dorsal face (Figure
7-48). They often exhibit extensive retouch on the distal end. In general, most end
scrapers tend to be symmetrical and are oval to lanceolate in shape. Most specimens
from Zatopec are made on flakes with a slight recurve on the ventral face. Specimen
584-2 is associated with Late Archaic I. Table 7-29 presents measurements taken from
end scrapers.

Gravers
(n = 5, Specimen Nos: 123-3, 181-1, 260-3, 416-1, and 559-1)
Although gravers typically refer to a functional category, no use-wear analysis
was performed on these artifacts (see Hall et al. 1982). For this project, gravers are
a category of unifaces having two or more concave areas that merge to form a sharp,
acute angled point (Prilliman and Bousman 1998:613). They are distinguished from
denticulates (see below) by having a very prominent spur. Five gravers were recovered
from Zatopec. Four of these had a single spur, and the remaining artifact had two
modified spurs (Figure 7-49). Specimen 123-3 was from the Toyah phase, and specimen
181-1 was associated with the Late Archaic II. Gravers exhibited a wide variation in
size and thickness, which is summarized in Table 7-30.

Denticulates
(n = 4, 258-2, 284-3, 598-3, and 1067-2)
The denticulates assemblage consists of four artifacts. Denticulates have multiple
tooth-like spurs created by a series of regular notches (Crabtree 1972). The notch-spur
pattern can either be coalescent, making a saw-like edge, or dispersed notches separated
by un-retouched lateral edges (Prilliman and Bousman 1998). Denticulates from
Zatopec are found on both cortical and interior flakes (see Figure 7-49C, D). Specimens
181-1 and 598-3 are from the Late Archaic II; the other two are from undated contexts.

Clear Fork
(n = 5, Specimen Nos.: 1-2, 423-1, 480-1, 587-3, and 602-1)
Clear Fork unifacial tools were first identified by Cyrus Ray (1941) as Clear Fork
Type II. He postulated that they were probably used as wood scrapers. Clear Fork tools
are typically triangular in appearance. The wide-flaring end is usually slightly concave
but can be convex or straight. The concavity is formed by usage and retouch (Hall et al.
1982). Ray (1941) initially postulated that these tools originated in the Early Archaic
period and possibly the Paleoindian but remained prevalent for a long span of time.
Subsequent work has supported this supposition that Clear Fork tools range from the
Paleoindian period through the Late Archaic (see Epstein 1969; Hall et al. 1982; and
Hughes 1980). Recent data suggest that the unifacial variety of Clear Fork gouges
occur later in time than the bifacial variety (circa the Late Archaic I–Late Archaic II
transition); however, there is still substantial overlap between the bifacial and unifacial
forms (Dial 1998; Oksanen et al. 2008). The Zatopec assemblage contains five unifacial
Clear Fork tools, all of which were found in mixed contexts (Figure 7-50). Measurements
and use intensity data for Clear Forks are in Table 7-32.

Regular Form

650-1, 1032-5, 1147-8, 1180-29, 1184-8, 1197-3, 1205-4, 1207-2, 1220-15)
Regular form unifaces is a catch-all category created for formal unifaces that exhibit
a clear form or shape but do not conform to a morphologically distinct group. Most of
these unifaces are ovate and are less than 15 mm at their thickest dimension (Figure
7-51). There is one possible graver or punch (1184-8) and one possible Clear Fork (2322), but both are fragmented and cannot be confidently classified as such. One (544-3) is
a unifacially trimmed blade or prismatic flake and is serrated along one edge. Serration
is a form of denticulation, but it is much more regular in both flake depth and interval
length (Crabtree 1972). Since this was the only serrated artifact and it did not fall
into a clear analytical unit, it was not classified in its own category. Many of these
tools exhibit macroscopic use-wear suggestive of use as end or side scrapers. Only two
artifacts from this group were found in analytical units. Specimen 1197-3 is associated
with the Toyah phase, and specimen 534-1 is associated with the Late Archaic I. Table
7-33 summarizes the metric and use intensity data for this category.

pieces, they likely had a specific usage; however, their fragmentary nature prevents
identification.

The final uniface category includes artifacts meeting the definition of a formal
uniface but lacking sufficiently distinctive forms for easy identification. Most of these
unifaces are very thick and contain a large amount of cortex. Several fall into a gray
area between flake tools and formal unifaces, but their extensive edge modification
placed these tools in the formal uniface category (Figure 7-52). Specimen 263-3
was associated with the Toyah phase, and specimens 593-5 and 593-7 were found
in association with the Late Archaic II phase. Metric and use intensity data are

Discussion of Unifaces
As mentioned earlier, the limited number of unifacial artifacts recovered from dated
contexts prevents extensive temporal analysis. Many of these artifacts fall into poorly
understood morphological categories (exceptions include Clear Fork tools) and, beyond
their use as tools, convey little direct information about technological strategies for
creating or maintaining tool kits. However, in terms of how artifact assemblages from
Zatopec represent tool design strategies that range from truly expedient to formally
designed and maintainable, these artifacts form a bridge between very expedient
tools such as flake tools, and very maintainable tools such as bifaces. Therefore use
intensity data from unifaces are included in the discussion about expediency versus
maintainability (see Chapter 11), although the limited sample precludes detailed
consideration.

Blades
R. Zac Selden and Jon C. Lohse

A considerable amount of blade material was recovered from Zatopec. In some ways,
this poses challenges to traditional understandings of Central Texas prehistoric
developments, since prismatic blades are commonly thought to occur only, or at least
primarily in the Late Prehistoric (Toyah) and Early Paleoindian (Clovis) periods, with
little to no occurrence in between (see Hester and Shafer 1975). Although some mixing
of deposits is present at Zatopec, our view is that blade material is undeniably present,
albeit at times in trace quantities, in nearly all time periods represented by secure
deposits at the site. This is potentially significant, since blades are sometimes viewed as
specialized components of technological systems (e.g,. Rasic and Andrefsky 2001). This
analysis focuses on describing metric and technological variation of blades from Zatopec,
with emphasis on patterns across time periods.
The traditional definition of a blade is any flake more than twice as long as it is wide
(Bordes 1961), although many researchers distinguish blades from inadvertent long,
narrow flakes. The definition by Bar-Yosef and Kuhn (1999:323) is narrower than that
of Bordes, and refers to elongated blanks with parallel or slightly converging edges.
Other scholars recognize blades as a specialized component of larger lithic assemblages
(Hester and Shafer 1975; Rasic and Andrefsky 2001). Collins (1999), for instance, notes
that the systematic production of true blades leaves a distinctive record consisting of
blades, productive blade cores, and evidence for the reduction and maintenance of these
cores. When identified together, these artifact forms to differentiate the intentional
production of blades from lithic reduction resulting in pieces that resemble blades.
Identifying blade technology at Zatopec contributes to some of the research questions
regarding technological organization over time and how some individuals may have
engaged in time- and labor-intensive activities representing semi-specialized tasks.
In Texas, the two best known cases for formal blade production are Early Paleoindian
Clovis (Collins 1999; Green 1963) and Late Prehistoric Toyah (Black 1986; Hester and
Shafer 1975; Johnson 1994; Ricklis 1994). Elsewhere, blades have also been described in
other time periods, including the Fourche Maline culture in the Trans-Mississippi South
(Schambach 1998), the Early Archaic assemblage at the Sleeper Site in Blanco County
(Johnson 1991), in Spanish mission contexts across South Texas and Northern Mexico
(Hester 1989; Inman 1999; Lohse 1999; Tomka 1999; Ricklis 2000), and, recently, in
pre-Toyah Late Prehistoric (Austin phase) deposits in south Central Texas (Shafer 2006;
also Arnn 2008:311–314). Wilke et al. (2002:2) note that percussion blade technology
“was always present somewhere” in mid-continent North America, suggesting that,

266

rather than approach blade technology as a diagnostic technological element of any
particular time period, archaeologists should focus on conditions under which blade
production was important. The assemblage at Zatopec contains a modest number of
blades. In light of the low number of cores from which specialized blades could have
been produced (n = 15, see below), attention is given to distinguishing between true
blades, those that represent the intentional removal of specialized laminar flakes, and
blade-like flakes, or pieces produced with other debitage but that attain long, slender
proportions.
Intentional or true blades and blade-like flakes are described below in terms of
their technical characteristics and patterns of wear. Next, the distribution of blades
and related debris by time period is presented. No significant patterns are evident in
terms of blade usage. However, this discussion contextualizes a small but significant
component of toolmaking behavior during different periods of occupation at Zatopec.
Methodology
An initial sorting of the site’s lithic debris was conducted in which objects meeting
Bordes’s (1961) criteria were identified. A second sorting removed pieces with
multidirectional flaking, reflecting reduction and thinning of bifaces, on their dorsal
sides. Additional criteria used during the second sorting include (1) that the blade’s
longest dimension must parallel the direction of force, and (2) that, if flaked, the blade’s
dorsal surface shows parallel or nearly parallel prior flake removals. Flakes that were
defined in the initial sorting as possible blades but that had multidirectional flaking on
their dorsal surfaces were identified as bifacial thinning flakes and were returned to the
general debitage inventory.
Resulting remains were sorted into different subcategories of blades. In general,
the cross sections of true blades may be plano-convex, triangulate, sub-triangulate,
rectangular, and trapezoidal (Crabtree 1962). Most true blades show visible evidence for
use. The subcategory of bladelets retain the technical traits of blades, but are less than
1.5 mm wide and 4.0 mm long. The subcategory of blade-like flakes share common traits
with both blades and long, narrow biface thinning flakes. Blade-like flakes have nearparallel flaking on their dorsal sides, and thinner cross-sections than true blades. Given
these characteristics, these artifacts may have been removed as blades from bifacial
cores, or they may simply be biface thinning flakes that happen to resemble blades.
Corner blades are a third subcategory. These pieces were removed from the corners of
rectangular nodules, are strongly triangular in cross-section, and retain cortex along
one or both dorsal facets. With the exception of corner blades, all subcategories possess
a subgroup of segments. Not all true blades fall into one of these subcategories.
After being identified as a blade or blade-like flake, each artifact was weighed and
measured for length, width, and thickness. A defining trait for some blade complexes is
curvature (e.g., Collins 1999; Green 1963). Therefore, in order to describe blades from

267

Zatopec so as to facilitate comparison with other assemblages, blade curvature was
measured following the manner described for Clovis (Collins 1999; Collins and Lohse
2004). This approach includes degree of curvature and index of curvature (described
below). Differences in platform types are discussed, and distinctions are made between
single-faceted and multifaceted striking platforms. Understanding platform type is
important in that, when viewed in conjunction with attributes such as compression
rings, platform damage (crushing), and errailure scarring, assessments can be made
regarding hard and soft hammer percussion.
Following previous discussions of Clovis blades (Collins 1999:85–86; Collins and
Lohse 2004:167–175), numerous variables were measured for each artifact:
•

Maximum length: straight-line length in mm from the platform to the most distal
point on the blade, taken with sliding calipers.

•

Maximum width: the widest point in mm on the blade between the lateral margins, taken with sliding calipers.

•

Maximum thickness: taken at the point of greatest thickness as measured in mm
from the interior to the exterior surfaces with sliding calipers.

•

Weight: measured in grams directly on electronic scale.

•

Width-to-length ratio: the arithmetic expression of the maximum length in relation to maximum width, with width given an arbitrary value of one.

•

Length + width + thickness: the sum of the measurements maximum length plus
maximum width plus maximum thickness. This is calculated for use in further
calculating the three ratios described next; by itself, it has little value other than
as a very generalized expression of overall size.

•

Length divided by length + width + thickness: the ratio of length to the sum of the
primary dimensions; useful in graphic expression of shape.

•

Width divided by length + width + thickness: the ratio of width to the sum of the
primary dimensions; useful in graphic expression of shape.

•

Thickness divided by length + width + thickness: the ratio of thickness to the sum
of the primary dimensions; useful in graphic expression of shape.

•

Platform angle: the angle between the proximal interior blade surface and the
platform, measured visually by placing the blade on a template; as it is not possible to precisely determine the plane of the very small platforms, this measurement
is not to be considered more accurate than ± 5 degrees (that is, the true angle falls
within a 10-degree range).

•

Platform width: the maximum dimension in mm of the striking platform between
the lateral edges, taken with sliding calipers.

•

Platform depth: the maximum dimension perpendicular to the platform width,
from the interior to the exterior surfaces, taken in mm with sliding calipers; this
represents the bite taken by the percussor on the platform of the core.

•

Index of curvature: the ratio of two linear measurements taken on the interior surface of the blade. These measurements are (a) the straight-line distance between
the distal and proximal points of contact of the interior blade surface and a flat

268

plane, and (b) the maximum perpendicular distance between that plane and the
interior surface of the blade. The greater the value of the index, the more curved
the blade. This is not considered a highly precise measure, but a generalized expression of curvature for descriptive and comparative purposes.
•

Degree of curvature: the change in course of the fracture in degrees between the
proximal and the distal end of the blade interior; measured as the angle between
two planes, one tangential to the most proximal interior surface of the blade, the
other tangential to the most distal interior surface of the blade.

Finally, to address the functional role of this tool type at Zatopec, patterns of
macroscopic edge-modification and utilization are discussed. Wear patterns are
described using the same terms as used for the modified and expediently utilized
flake tools from the site (following Prilliman and Bousman 1998). Notched flakes,
or notches, have invasive single or multiple nonadjoining concave modified edges.
Notches differ from simple concave edge modification by exhibiting a significantly
abrupt concave retouched depression into the flake body, altering the flake outline.
Notches are produced either by intentional edge modification or by the accretion of edge
damage acquired through repeated use. Irregular continuous modification may reflect
intentional modification (either scraping or dulling) of the flake margin, or the accretion
of edge modification acquired through tool utilization. Irregular discontinuous retouch
describes noncontiguous areas of edge flaking that do not significantly overlap and may
be random single flake detachments or areas of edge modification not longer than 4 mm.
Data are presented for true blades (single and multi-faceted platforms and
segments), bladelets, and blade-like flakes. Given the low frequency of blade cores,
we expected that blades with multifaceted platforms would more closely resemble
blade-like flakes in terms of morphology and technology than blades with singlefaceted platforms. Therefore, the following discussions emphasize differences between
multifaceted true blades and blade-like flakes and also present all blade data to describe
overall blade production. Though technically considered true blades, corner blades are
discussed separately from single- and multifaceted blades. Corner blades represent
early stages of stone reduction, and it can be difficult to discern which items in this
category were intended as blades and which ones simply represent the removal of cortex
from a chert nodule.

Results of Analysis
True Blades
True blades were sorted into two groups based on whether they had single-faceted
(n = 27) or multifaceted (n = 29) platforms (Tables 7-35, 7-36). Twenty-one segments
are also identified (Table 7-37); no platform data are available for these. Single-faceted
blades are generally larger in size than multifaceted blades; on average wider by
4.58 mm and heavier by 6.39 g. Multifaceted blades have stronger curvature, with an
average increase in the index of curvature of 1.70, and a marked increase in the degree
of curvature by 4.73 degrees. However, variation in both length-to-width and width-tothickness ratios is smaller for single-faceted blades than for multifaceted blades (mean
= 2.21, 2.73, s.d. = 0.62, 0.69 versus mean = 2.68, 2.64, s.d. = 0.76, 0.76, respectively),
indicating that they are more standardized and perhaps that specific size ranges were
targeted for these artifacts. These blades are predominantly hard percussion blades.
Twenty-six of the 27 single-faceted blades exhibit some kind of macroscopic use-wear
along their lateral edges. Six specimens display characteristics indicative of scraping on
the distal end, and one example of notching also on the distal end. In comparison, 27 of
29 multifaceted blades show visible signs of use along their lateral edges. Three of these
blades also exhibit characteristics of scraping on their distal ends. Based on these usage
patterns, there is no significant difference between these two groups in terms of how
they were used as tools.
Corner Blades
Corner blades have square or approximately square cross sections. In addition,
many dorsal sides are altogether unflaked, whereas others have only a single or perhaps
two flaked facets. Because of the remnant cortex and roughly formed dorsal ridges,
corner blades are crude when examined alongside other kinds of blades. Most have large
platforms showing little or no signs of preparation, and retain large, pronounced bulbs
of force indicating hard hammer percussion.
Thirteen of the 17 corner blades from Zatopec exhibit use-wear along their lateral
margins, and roughly one-third of all specimens (n = 6) possess some form of distal
modification (Table 7-38). Clearly, these artifacts were often used as tools, though to a
slightly lesser degree than other kinds of true blades.
Bladelets
Bladelets are smaller than other blades, measuring less than 1.5 cm in width, and
less than 4 cm in length (after Bar-Yosef and Kuhn 1999). The Zatopec assemblage
contains 10 complete bladelets and nine segments (Table 7-39). Bladelet lengths range
from 13.59 to 30.45 mm, and widths from 4.01 to 13.36 mm. The length-to-thickness
ratio ranges from 5.77 to 19.42, the width-to-thickness ratio from 2.19 to 5.90, and the
length-to-width ratio from 2.36 to 4.00. Seven of ten (70 percent) complete bladelets

show use-wear, a frequency that compares favorably with other blade categories,
discussed above, and one (634-2) demonstrates evidence of scraping on its distal end.
Blade-like Flakes
A total of 39 blade-like flakes were identified in the second sorting (Table 7-40). These
are presented here both as candidates for possible blades and also to help differentiate
blade production from normal biface reduction. In this study, two single-faceted, 26
multifaceted, and 11 blade-like flake segments were identified. Although blade-like flakes
lack many of the defining characteristics of blades, metric analyses show that that they
are similar in many aspects to true blades. Most show use or edge damage.
All blade-like flake segments, and all but one blade-like flakes, display use-wear on
one or both lateral edges. Three of 11 segments exhibit distal scraping, another three
display distal notching, and one example shows irregular continuous modification. On
the basis of these use frequencies, blade-like flakes, although they do not resemble true
blades in some ways, were most likely manufactured to be used in many of the same
ways as blades. The fact that these artifacts resemble biface thinning flakes in many
respects is taken to indicate the close technological relationship of blade production to
standard biface manufacture that characterizes the time periods represented in this
assemblage.
Discussion of Blades by Analytical Unit
Understanding blade frequency by time period is important to arguments for
the appearance and nature of specialization in the Central Texas Archaic and Late
Prehistoric periods. Blades have traditionally been closely identified with Toyah
toolkits and stone tool industries. Analysis of other elements of the Zatopec assemblage
provide comparative information on larger technological patterns that can be used to
understand what Toyah material culture looked like at the site, and how it differed from
earlier time periods. When blades are considered alongside these artifact categories,
it is apparent that blade-making was an ongoing though perhaps never significant
activity at Zatopec; blade material is found, albeit in low frequencies, in all time periods.
Relative increases or decreases when considered together with other technological shifts
help contextualize when and under what conditions blade-making was important, even
if only to a relatively small percentage of the site occupants.
For the purpose of these discussions, only those artifacts listed in Tables 7-35
through 7-40 as coming from AU 1a, AU 1b, AU 2a, and AU 2b are considered. Other
artifacts coming from the general Late Prehistoric period (AU 1) or general Late Archaic
(AU 2) lack the temporal specificity to contribute much to the overall understanding of
blade-making at Zatopec. Furthermore, only a single blade was recovered from Middle
Archaic deposits (AU 3). This single sample is too small to be meaningful for any kind of
analysis, and it is not discussed further.

When considering the frequency of blade occurrence, recovery rates were
standardized according the formula presented earlier (see Chapter 3). Since individual
counts for each blade category vary, all blade counts are included together to evaluate
frequency trends (Figure 7-53). Overall blade recovery is low, meaning that these
trends might not necessarily represent larger regional patterns for prehistoric periods
in Central Texas. Nevertheless, when standardized, blade recovery increases from .35
blades-per-century to .44 blades-per-century, approximately 20 percent, from Austin
to Toyah times. Considering the discussion presented earlier for the role of blades
as specialized components in assemblages, this increase can be viewed as part of a
technological shift occurring between these times, a shift that is evident in other artifact
categories as well. Blade production is approximately equivalent from Late Archaic II to
Austin (the increase of 0.05 blades-per-century is negligible), reflecting some measure of
technological continuity between these periods (also noted in other artifact categories).
Use-Wear and Tools on Blades
Patterns of macroscopic use-wear evident on blades were categorized into four
patterns: notching, scraping, irregular discontinuous, and irregular continuous, as
described above. Observations were made on each lateral edge as well as on the distal
end for artifacts that retained this portion. Many artifacts display more than one
pattern of edge damage, and many artifacts show wear on both lateral and distal edges.
As previously discussed, most of the specimens identified as blades (including bladelike flakes) show use-wear. However, no clear patterns were recognized concerning use
intensity over time, or greater frequency of use for any particular blade category. In
general terms and based on macroscopic evidence alone, it appears that blades were
used quite often for any of a number of tasks.
Remarkably few recognizable tool forms are present on blades from the site.
Although many show general patterns of use along one or more edges, very few were
retouched, used, or modified to the point where they resemble formal, intentionally
designed tools. This may be somewhat surprising considering the amount of material at
Zatopec recovered from Toyah contexts. End scrapers, including some made on blades,
have long been considered to be one of the identifying traits of Toyah assemblages, yet
only three such artifacts on blades were recovered from Zatopec, and only one of these
was recovered from an analytical unit (Specimen 308-3, from AU 1b).
Concluding Thoughts on Blades
Analysis of blade material from Zatopec shows that these artifacts were a consistent
though not numerically significant component of toolkits throughout the later part of
the Archaic and the entire Late Prehistoric. If samples were better represented for each
time period, it might be possible to draw additional conclusions about patterns of use or
manufacture. As it stands, two tentative conclusions are possible.

282

Figure 7-53. Adjusted frequencies of all blade types by analytical unit at Zatopec.

First, the presence of blades through time, and the fact that they increase in Toyah
compared with earlier times, indicates that these tool forms may be perceived as
specialized (persistent but numerically diminished) aspects of toolkits for prehistoric
foragers who occupied Zatopec. Therefore, Toyah toolkits might fairly be described as
slightly more specialized than those of earlier periods. However, a larger sample of
blades would be necessary to sustain this conclusion.
Second, significant technological overlap is present between at least some blades and
some biface-thinning flakes. Many thinning flakes fulfill the minimal of Bordes (1961)
for blades, yet are probably not true blades in the sense that they were deliberately
fashioned from specially-prepared blade cores. We applied conservative criteria in
distinguishing blades from thinning flakes, and were left with a reduced sample of
artifacts for which no definitive assessment was possible. To us, these are best left as
“blade-like flakes,” representing the technological gray area between distinctive blade
production from special cores and some biface reduction that produces long, straight,
parallel-sided flakes. The fact that these blade-like flakes demonstrate macroscopic
use-wear at nearly the same frequency as true blades suggests to us that these items
were indeed intended to be used as blades but that they were struck from cores that
more closely resemble bifaces than blade cores. Future research is needed to explore this
technological relationship further. With larger samples, such research could profitably
focus on quantifying distinctions between blade and blade-like flake production across
key intervals, such as Austin–Toyah or Late Archaic I–Late Archaic II, that presently
are recognized by the appearance of systematic prismatic blade manufacture.

Blade Cores
Julian A. Sitters and Jon C. Lohse

During the preliminary sorting of the lithic assemblage from Zatopec, 17 blade cores
and blade core fragments were identified. Previous analyses have indicated that blade
technology was a significant component of many Late Prehistoric and even some Late/
Transitional assemblages throughout the Central and Southern Plains (Hester and
Shafer 1975; Ricklis 1995; Shafer 2006; Wilke et al. 2002). In most analyses, blade
cores are considered as a subcategory of cores. In the present study, however, they are
considered separately in an effort to illustrate blade-making behavior at Zatopec as part
of the infrequent yet deliberate, and perhaps specialized, removal of prismatic flakes by
direct percussion or, in cases, pressure. In most analyses of blade-and-core technologies,
scant attention is usually given to the cores; most analytical focus remains on the
blades.
In many assemblages with evidence of prismatic technology, blades were often used
to make end scrapers (Wilke et al. 2002:2), such as those used for processing bison skins.
Blade cores and related blade debris are associated with bison remains at Zatopec, but
also with a variety of other animal remains, suggesting that this was a very versatile
technology. Below, results of the analysis of blade cores are presented. Following this
technological discussion is a brief summary of the distribution of blade cores by period of
site occupation. (Unfortunately, most of the blade cores and related maintenance debris
were recovered from surface, disturbed, or undated contexts, and so cannot be placed in
the site’s chronology.) Nevertheless, a detailed technological description of these blade
cores will be useful for future comparative work, particularly by archaeologists working
with Central Texas Archaic and Late Prehistoric materials.
Methodology
A number of different kinds of blade cores are present at Zatopec. Forms include
wedge, keeled, bladelet, and maintenance. Wedge-shaped cores have been defined
by Collins (1999) as those for which the face and platform surface meet at an acute
angle. These artifacts most often have one face from which blades were removed; some
Clovis wedge cores have a second face as well (Lohse and Bradley 2007). They compare
technologically with Upper Paleolithic forms from Europe and Asia (e.g., Vishnyatsky
2004) where they are common, but have been underreported in the southern Central
Plains of North America. Ricklis (1994) describes some Toyah phase blade cores from
the Mustang Branch site, 41HY209, as having “wedge shaped” distal ends. These are
not to be confused with the wedge-shaped cores described here, which compare more
favorably with those recognized in Clovis assemblages and described by Collins (1999).

284

Keeled cores are similar to what Bleed (1996) describes as the Yubetsu technique.
These cores are first shaped as large, thick bifaces, which are then split. The flat surface
created by the break serves as the platform, with parallel blades removed perpendicular
to this surface. The bifacial crest that runs around the biface and that forms the face
of the core provides a guide for the initial blade of this sequence. Only one keeled core
from which large blades were removed was recovered from Zatopec, and this specimen
lacks firm evidence that it was initially a large biface; the flat platform surface shows no
conclusive sign of having been fractured. Nonetheless, the nodule was bifacially flaked,
and retains a ridge or crest that begins at the distal end and follows around to the back
of the core. In addition to this large core, though, two bladelet cores were crested, or
keeled by bifacial flaking; these are described below.
Bladelet cores are those from which very small micro-blades have been removed.
As presented in the blade analysis, above, this category includes cores with blade scars
less than 1.5 mm wide and 4.00 mm long. Five of these cores were identified at Zatopec,
indicating the specialized function that these tools are likely to have served at the site.
Items placed into the maintenance debris category include flakes and other
fragments that show evidence of blade removals. These items are placed in the
blade core category rather than discussed as a separate class of debitage so that all
discussions concerning blade cores can be included in the same section of this report.
These are pieces that were removed from larger cores, and reflect efforts to remove
stacks or problem areas that would have inhibited further blade removals. Of these
six items, only two are from large blade cores; the remaining four represent bladelet
cores. At least one of these may have resulted in a failed attempt to detach a blade that
instead removed most of the core face.
In spite of this variation, these forms share a set of defining traits, including
minimally, a face with two or more blade scars in parallel or near-parallel alignment.
Each core has an active face from which blades were removed; the platform that
corresponds with this face is considered the primary platform. In a few cases, however,
a second face may be present; this can either be on the end of the core opposite to the
primary face, or can originate from the distal end, opposing the primary platform, in
cases where the core was reversed and blades removed in the opposite direction from
those on the primary face. Several specimens were either fragments or debris, but were
identified as coming from blade cores based on face characteristics. In addition, cores
are characterized by a platform surface that has been prepared in one of two ways. The
first is a relatively flat platform surface made up of either one or two flake facets. In
some instances, this platform surface resulted from the splitting or opening of a chert
nodule and shows no further modification. The second platform type is multifaceted,
with three or more flake removals originating from several directions. These platform
types are referred to as simple and complex, respectively. A final trait of blade cores is
the acute angle between the core face and platform surface.

285

Analysis of blade cores included recording basic metric data as well as other
characteristics. Length, width, and thickness were recorded in millimeters and weight
was recorded to the nearest tenth of a gram (Table 7-41). Edge angles between the
platform surface and core face were measured using a goniometer (Table 7-42). This
angle can be difficult to measure precisely because of the sinuous surface of many facets
that create the platform surface. Accordingly, several measurements were taken from
each core, and these were averaged. The number of blade scars and the number of
complete blade scars present on the core were also counted (Table 7-43). Other recorded
attributes are the number of negative bulb scars and the presence of cortex (Table 7-44).

Following these measurements and observations, different parts of each blade core
was described. These components include the platform surface, core face(s), sides, back,
and distal end. Platforms were described by the number of facets, type and degree of
platform preparation, the presence of knots or stacks, the direction of flaking, and the
measurement of edge angles. Platforms were classified as simple or complex (see above).
Core faces were described by their terminations, evidence of damage, the number of
blade scars present, and by face symmetry and degree of face projection. Face symmetry
is the degree to which face features such as ridges appear straight and parallel. Face
projection is the degree and angularity of the protruding mass that forms the core face,
as this protrusion meets the platform. Maintaining these two traits was helped to guide
or control the removal of additional blades. Asymmetrical faces tend to produce very
irregular blades, and low face projection makes it difficult to remove blades at all. The
lateral edges, back, and distal ends of the blade cores were described by the direction
of flaking, and by visible damage. Only photographs of examples selected from each
category are included.
Results
Wedge-shaped cores (n = 7)
Blade core 106-2 is a wedge-shaped core made from a split chert nodule (Figure
7-54). The platform includes only a single facet. This flake scar is short and originates
beyond the current platform edge. The face is moderately asymmetrical with distinct
projection along one side. Seven blade scars originating from the platform are present,
only four of which retain their negative bulb scars. Blade removal appears to have been
with direct hard, or perhaps soft hammer percussion based on distinct compression rings,
pronounced bulb scars, and shattered platform surfaces. One lateral edge is composed of
cortex, which has been removed from the opposite edge. Two flakes originate from this
edge, traveling onto the face perpendicular to the core’s long axis; these are remnants of

289

earlier cortex trimming. The core back is shaped by a single large flake that originates
from the distal end indicating that the core was seated on an anvil when it was initially
split. This core is well prepared and was productive, though no effort appears to have
been expended to prolong its use life through rejuvenation or maintenance.
Specimen 593-1 has a single-faceted, simple platform. The platform surface
has multiple flake scars but is heavily patinated, making it clear that no platform
preparation was done before blades were removed from the face. Battering is present
along the platform edge on the back of the core. The face is fairly symmetrical, and
has medium projection. A total of four blade scars were identified, two of which lack
negative bulb scars; the remaining two scars are highly irregular. Hard hammer
percussion was likely used to remove blades based on strong compression rings
on the face and the pronounced bulb scars. Inclusions are present throughout this
material suggesting that the core was made from a low quality chert. This core was
opportunistically and expediently recycled from an earlier artifact with only minimal
preparation; in general, it reflects a limited understanding on the part of the knapper of
complex tool design.
Specimen 488-2 (see Figure 7-54) has a single-faceted, simple platform. Heavy
modification is present along the face-platform edge from trimming and raking for
platform preparation. Multiple step terminations are present on the face, resulting in a
pronounced stack that appears to have ruined this core for any future blade removals.
The knapper responded by attempting to reverse the core and remove the stacked
platform from the opposing end. The result was an overshot flake that carried too far,
removing the entire platform surface, as well as a large portion of the core face. Before
it was ruined, the core face had very good symmetry with moderate but well defined
projection. There are at least three blade scars on the face, none of which correspond
with negative bulb scars. The negative bulb scars that are present, corresponding to
blades that ended in stacked terminations, have strong compression rings and shattered
striking platform scars from hard hammer percussion. The intact side is patinated and
uneven because of natural inclusions; cortex remains on the back. Battering is seen
along one edge on the back. In spite of the ruined face, this core shows highly skilled
blade removals in the form of straight, parallel ridges. Although this core was ruined,
the attempted reversal is unusual in the present assemblage and indicates an effort to
prolong the core’s use-life.
Core 589-1 has a single-faceted simple platform with no evidence of modification.
The core face is highly asymmetrical with poor projection. Two parallel blade scars are
present on the center of the face and extend all the way to the distal end; no evidence
indicates the removal of blades from the corners of this core. Both blade scars retain
negative bulbs. These blades appear to have been removed with direct hard hammer
percussion. Some flaking on the sides is from cortex removal, though no multidirectional

290

Figure 7-54. Examples of wedge-shaped cores from Zatopec.

flaking is present or can be identified on the core face. The core back and distal end are
composed of cortex. Battering is present at the distal end, suggesting that the core was
seated during blade removal.
Core 506-1 was made on a heavily patinated, recycled biface fragment. The platform
is single-faceted and is heavily patinated, and was made on the beveled end of the

291

original biface. The face has only two visible blade scars, both of which retained their
negative bulb scars. At least one of these blades appears to have been removed with
hard hammer percussion based on the pronounced size of the bulb scar. This blade
ended prematurely in a feather termination in the middle of the face. The core face has
some symmetry but is flat and has poor projection. One edge is composed of the bifacial
edge of the original artifact. The other edge is uneven, with a squared tabular remnant
that was partially removed with short trimming. A snap fracture removed the distal
end before this artifact was recycled as a blade core. The regularity of the blade scars
reflects moderately skilled knapping abilities.
Specimen 1220-9 is a wedge-shaped core recovered from the surface. This artifact
has a single facet, simple platform. Small flake scars originating from the platform
and extending onto the face were in an effort to isolate striking platforms for future
blade removal. Some grinding is also present along the platform edge. At least
four blades were removed; evidence for any earlier removals has been obliterated.
Two negative bulb scars remain. One is deep, and corresponds with some platform
crushing, indicating probable use of hard hammer percussion. The other bulb scar is
somewhat recessed and less clearly visible. The core face is rather asymmetrical and
has poor projection. Corner blades, one of which failed in a step termination, have been
attempted along both lateral edges. The back and both sides have cortex and show
battering. The distal end may have been used as an expedient scraper. Some of the
remaining surfaces, such as along the distal end and on part of the platform, are heavily
patinated, indicating that this nodule was recycled from an earlier chipped stone item.
Although this core is well designed from a technical perspective, the irregularity of the
blade removals indicates only moderately precise or skilled knapping. Blades removed
from this core are not large, and are characterized by wavy edges and faces. However,
the possibility that multiple techniques for removing blades were used on this core may
be important in understanding blade technology at the site. Specimen 97-1 is identified
as a wedge-shaped core based on the acute angle between the face and platform, and
the fact that its face shows multiple parallel scars starting from the same platform. This
core was formed from a split nodule that shows no additional signs of modification. Both
sides and the distal end are composed of cortex, and the back has thin heat spalls. No
flakes whatsoever have been removed from the platform surface. Extensive trimming
and light flaking associated with efforts to isolate striking platforms are present all
along the core face. A number of blade-like flakes were removed; many of these overlap
prior removal scars, making it impossible to count the number of blades detached from
this core. At least six or seven blade-like scars are visible, three of which correspond
with negative bulb scars. These scars show signs of crushed platforms, though it is not
possible to say with certainty that they reflect hard hammer percussion. Because these
flakes have been removed from the flat side of this nodule, they lack the characteristic
triangular or trapezoidal cross-section of most blades. Indeed, except for the serial

292

removals from along the same platform edge this artifact would not be classified as a
blade core at all. This nodule is made of very grainy, apparently low-quality chert. This
factor probably contributes to the number of blade removals that terminate in abrupt
steps and hinges.
Keeled Core (n = 1)
Specimen 1123-58 has a single-faceted, simple platform (Figure 7-55). The face is
moderately symmetrical, but as it follows a sharp bifacial crest, is characterized by
overall high projection. There are at least seven blade scars on the face, three of which
correspond to negative bulb scars. These are deep and broad and are probably from hard
hammer percussion. The initiation points of the remaining four have been removed
through subsequent blade removal. Interestingly, as with the wedge-shaped cores, no
evidence indicates rejuvenation or maintenance of the platform between blade removals;
all platform preparation that was conducted was limited to the face alone. The sides,
back, and distal end of this core have been shaped by bifacial flaking. Some cortex
remains on one side. This specimen reflects a sophisticated design and is one of the only
blade cores from the site that was bifacially flaked.
Bladelet cores (n = 5)
Core 580-3 has a double faceted, simple platform; one smaller scar still retains
its negative bulb scar, and partially overlies the previous facet. The earlier platform
surface is lightly patinated, suggesting that this core was recycled after having been
discarded. The core face is symmetrical, with the exception of two relatively large
flake scars that originate from the side, and has high projection. Cortex was trimmed
from the face and sides from multiple directions, though none was removed from the

Figure 7-55. Keeled core from Zatopec. Specimen 1123-58.

293

back. Remnants of three blade scars are present, only one of which retains a negative
bulb scar. This intact scar is very small, and appears to have been removed by direct
pressure, following the pronounced central ridge running down the face. The manner of
detachment for the other two cannot be determined. A slight knot has been allowed to
form on the face immediately below the platform; the intact scar actually starts at this
knot rather than the platform surface, and may reflect an attempt to remove through
pressure this flaw from the core so that additional blades could be removed.
Specimen 143-1 has a multifaceted, complex platform (Figure 7-56). These flake
scars are small and relatively flat, and originate from multiple directions around the
circumference of the core. This core has blade scars from around most of its perimeter,
indicating that it was rotated repeatedly to remove very small blades. Two facets are
present on opposing sides that appear not to have been formed by blade removal; it is
likely that these represent the lateral edges of this core when it was originally created.
In spite of the fact that this bladelet core essentially has two faces, both share the same
platform surface. These faces are highly symmetrical in some places, less so in others,
and maintain overall high projection. In addition to having been rotated, this bladelet
core was also reversed. At least five blade scars are visible that originate from the core’s
primary platform, two of which correspond with negative bulb scars. It is probable that
more blades were removed that have been largely obscured. Two scars originate from
the distal end. The secondary platform that corresponds with these two removals is
single-faceted, and is present at the distal end. The degree to which it was rotated and
reversed indicates a very high degree of tool-making comprehension on the part of the
knapper. This core is totally depleted, and even has two stacked terminations on its face
from failed attempts to remove yet more bladelets. The fact that there are undetached
fractures present suggests direct percussion.
Specimen 374-1 has a single-faceted, simple platform. The face is highly symmetrical,
with long, straight, parallel ridges defining each of the blade scars, and has high
projection. Five blade scars are visible, all of which originate with the current platform
and four of which have retained a negative bulb scar. The precision with which the blades
were removed suggests indirect pressure may have been used to detach these blades.
Two blade scars remove portions of the cortex that covered part of the core face; one of
these scars terminated prematurely in an abrupt step. Cortex remains on the core back
and along part of one edge. This core is lightly patinated, reflecting intermittent exposure
to the elements after it was discarded. A hairline fracture runs through the core and may
be the reason it was discarded. Although this core was well designed and executed, no
attempt appears to have been made to extend its use-life beyond the removal of the five
blades. A stack is present on one part of the face and none of the overhang or weakened
edge of the platform that is left after blade detachments has been removed.
Specimen 1159-11 resembles a bifacially crested or keeled core that has a long
narrow ridge running down from one face around the bottom of the core to the opposing

294

face. Blades were removed from each of these two ends, with some blade-like flakes
also taken off the sides. This ridge, however, is not truly crested, but is formed where
the terminal ends of the side flakes converge. It is not possible to count precisely the
number of blade scars that are present, although portions of at least seven are visible on
both faces. Three of the seven probable blade scars correspond with a negative bulb scar.
Negative bulb scars on the core sides resemble hard hammer percussion; those on the
core faces are indeterminate. Unlike Specimen 1123-58, discussed above, this artifact
does not appear to have been part of a larger biface. The platforms that correspond with
each face are shaped by one and two flakes, respectively, and so are considered simple,

295

multifaceted platforms. Both faces are moderately symmetrical, depending on individual
blade terminations, and have high projection. The entire core is patinated, reflecting
exposure to the elements after being discarded. As with Specimen 143-1, the rotation
of this core between the two faces reveals a comprehensive understanding of the design
requirements for successful blade removal on the part of the knapper.
Specimen 558-1 resembles Specimen 1159-11 in that is also has a long narrow ridge
running from one face through the distal end, but unlike in the previous specimen,
this ridge was created by bifacial flaking. Furthermore, this bladelet core has only one
face from which bladelets were removed. The platform, with multiple flake removals,
is complex. Grinding is present along the platform edge in an attempt to prepare
the edge for flake removals. Three blade scars are present, two of which retain their
negative bulb scars. Heavy crushing characterizes one of the negative bulbs, suggesting
hard hammer percussion. The other, however, is faint and shows no crushing; the
form of percussor used for this removal cannot be identified. The final removal ended
prematurely in a faint hinge fracture in the middle of the face, which is symmetrical
and has moderate projection. Overall, this core is well designed and appears to have
been very skillfully knapped, based on the regularity of the blade scars.
Core Fragments and Maintenance Debris (n = 7)
Specimen 6-1 has a multifaceted, complex platform with preparation visible in the
form of multiple flake scars originating from both the core face as well as the sides.
Multiple flake terminations on the platform indicate that it had been maintained for
earlier blade removals. The face has poor projection and is highly asymmetrical. A
large stack is present in the middle of the face where a wide, thick blade terminates
in a hinge fracture. Four blade scars can be identified on this core fragment, only one
of which originates at the current platform surface and has retained a negative bulb
scar. This bulb scar is deep and pronounced, indicating hard hammer detachment.
One lateral edge displays a possible burin like flake scar, perhaps representing a failed
attempt to modify the lateral edge. The back of the core has a few flake scars, but no
significant features. Except for the fact that one minor scar originates with the current
platform, it is probable that this artifact was removed from a larger blade core after the
stack was allowed to form. This artifact resembles a slightly recycled, re-used piece of
maintenance debris.
Specimen 1180-3 (Figure 7-57) is another flake from a large blade core, and has
cortex on the distal end of the dorsal side and along one edge. The proximal end has
remnants of four blade scars, including two mostly complete scars and the terminations
of two others. Because the exact points of initiation are missing, it is not possible to
describe the type of percussor used to remove these blades. The two partial blade scars
end at a thick knot, and it is likely that this flake was removed from the original core in
an effort to remove this stack. The original platform surface of the core is not present,

296

Figure 7-57. Examples of core maintenance debris from Zatopec.

and so cannot be described. What remains of the face is moderately symmetrical; ridges
from the detached blades are fairly straight and parallel, except where they encounter
the knot. Face projection is relatively flat as can be determined.
Artifact 481-3 is a fragment of a core, possibly a bladelet core, that reflects face
maintenance. A slight knot was allowed to form immediately below the platform, and

297

this long flake appears to have been removed in order to correct this flaw. A remnant
of the original platform surface is present and shows multiple facets. The core face,
at least as represented on this artifact, has defined projection with strong, relatively
straight ridges. At least two and perhaps three blade scars are present, though none of
these retain their point of initiation. It is not possible to describe the type of percussor
used on this core. One lateral edge shows slight nicking, perhaps from use after this
flake was detached.
Specimen 474-3 is the result of bladelet core maintenance. The face of this artifact
has a pronounced stack resulting from multiple hinge terminations immediately below
the platform. The part of the original core face that is present is very regular, with long
parallel ridges and excellent projection. The remnant of the original platform surface
appears to be composed of a single facet. At least five blade scars can be identified, in
addition to several failed attempts that produced the stack. None of these five scars
retains its negative bulb scar, however, and it is not possible to describe the kind of
percussor used on this core. One lateral edge is formed by a large, relatively flat flake
facet, and the other has multiple flake scars originating from the back. Heavy nicking
and trimming is present along this edge, suggesting that the flake was used as a tool
after it was detached. A very fine fracture is present, perhaps from exposure to heat.
This artifact reflects knowledgeable, highly skilled knapping.
Artifact 406-2 is a flake removed from a bladelet core face. Four micro-blade scar
remnants run down the dorsal side; these scars are almost perfectly parallel and are
highly symmetrical. Only one bladelet scar corresponds with a negative bulb scar. In
spite of the symmetry of this face, this flake is extremely flat, and the projection of the
face is rather low. The portion of the platform that remains on this flake appears to be
single-faceted.
Specimen 434-4 is another fragment that appears to have been detached from the
face of a bladelet core. Three blade scars can be recognized on the dorsal side of this
flake. None of the scars are intact, and many overlie each other, reflecting the sequenced
manner in which they were removed. In addition, a large step, resulting from a hinge
termination, formed immediately below the platform surface. This flake was detached
from the distal end of the core, and reflects a moderately sophisticated attempt to
correct this flaw. Only a small portion of the original platform remains. It includes part
of a single facet, and it is not possible to describe the original platform.
Concluding Observations on Blade Cores from Zatopec
This category of artifact includes a relatively small number of specimens. Of the 19
cores and core fragments present, only six come from components or deposits that can
be dated. Based on this limited sample, blade cores are dated to Late Archaic II and
Late Prehistoric, primarily Austin phase deposits at the site. Interestingly, none was

298

recovered associated with Toyah materials, although because of the small sample, it
cannot be concluded that the site’s Toyah component never included blade cores. For
the most part, blade removal relied on direct hard hammer percussion; some evidence
for indirect percussion is present, and it remains possible that additional techniques
were used to remove blades. Apparent skill levels varied considerably and included
both skilled, knowledgeable knappers as well as individuals whose skill levels were
significantly less well developed.
In addition, at least two more comments can be made about blade cores that may
be significant to future analysis. First, there is little obvious technological connection
between blade-making and bifacial flaking. Of these 19 specimens, only two were made
on bifaces that had not been recycled from pieces discarded by earlier groups. The
other 17 cores all involve nodules or pieces of stone that were shaped specifically to
create useable blade cores, or that were opportunistically used to detach blades in an
expedient fashion. Second, and related to the first trait, is that only one core, Specimen
143-1, retains evidence for repeated and deliberate rejuvenation on the platform. All
other specimens have either single-facet platforms, or have platform surfaces that have
been identified as complex, though do not show direct or clear evidence for maintenance
between blade removals. By far, most of the platform preparation that preceded a blade
removal was concentrated on the faces of cores. The apparent absence of a strategy of
working the face and platform in alternating fashion further distinguished blade and
bladelet core production and maintenance from biface production at the site.
The presence of a technological strategy that was focused on removing very small
blades is of potential interest. Previous studies of Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric
lithic assemblages in the region appear to have overlooked the systematic production of
small blades or bladelets as an element of prismatic blade-making. Although bladelet
cores (n = 9 including those represented by maintenance) appear with about the same
frequency as regular cores (n = 10) at Zatopec, future research will be required to
demonstrate whether this component of prismatic blade production truly accounts for
approximately one-half of the cores that are to be found.
Because of the limited sample size from Zatopec, these and other potential
observations about blade core technology remain to be verified by future research.
Nevertheless, data available suggest that blade-making activities were a significant,
if numerically minor, component of Late Archaic II and Late Prehistoric toolkits.
Available evidence also indicates that cores associated with true blades were
technologically distinguished from biface production. They therefore appear to represent
a specialized aspect of hunter-gatherer economic systems relating to a narrow range of
tasks that did not extend across large segments of the population.

Flake Cores
Julian A. Sitters, Jon C. Lohse, and R. Zac Selden

Among prehistoric hunter-gatherers, flake cores serve as the primary source of material
for expedient or ad hoc stone tools. Flake cores exhibit a considerable amount of
variation in the manner of platform preparation, dimensions, and diverse approaches
to core reduction. Within Central Texas, little serious attention has been given to the
enormous variation found within flake core assemblages. This may be due in part to
the difficulty in identifying different core types used by prehistoric peoples, as well as
analytical focus on other artifact categories such as projectile points and bifaces.
However, variation among flake cores should not be overlooked. Flake core variation
can be discerned in not only size ranges, but also technological approaches to how flake
cores were designed and maintained, and their possible relation to other stone flaking
activities, such as the production of bifaces for other tool forms altogether. Since the
flakes taken from flake cores are commonly associated with a wide range of utilitarian
and processing tasks performed largely in and around domestic campsites, their
manufacture is often attributed to women (Gero 1991; Sassaman 1992). In our view, this
association is likely to be true at a fundamental level, but is probably overly simplistic
in that the kinds of tasks performed with flake tools could potentially have been carried
out by any number of kinds of people depending on different circumstances and cultural
trends.
However, to the degree that this attribution is valid, demonstrating its likelihood
depends largely on analysts’ ability to illustrate technological variation from defined
biface and point manufacturing strategies. In addition, divergent patterns of use,
production, or discard suggesting distinctions between task groups who relied on these
different tool forms is necessary evidence for considering a social definition of technology
as described in Chapter 1. Therefore, flake cores, like flake tools, represent a very
wide range of behavior within prehistoric hunter-gatherer social groups that may be
determined by reliance on different source outcrops, the availability of subsistencerelated resources, and certainly divisions of labor involving different kinds of prehistoric
persons who participated in complementary, but non-overlapping tasks. In addition
to these kinds of behavioral variability, flake cores (like bifaces) should also reflect
differing flint knapping aptitudes amongst prehistoric flake core manufacturers, a
fluctuating reliance on flake cores and flake tools within a social group, and increases
in hunter-gatherer populations. Discussion below presents and describes technological
categories for flake cores that were recognized at Zatopec. Because diachronic trends in
these data form a highly significant line of evidence for addressing the fourth research

300

domain for this project, discussion of flake core occurrences over time is presented along
with other temporal and behavioral comparisons in Chapter 11.
Categories and Methodology
In an effort to recognize possible cores at Zatopec, an initial sorting of the lithic debris
was conducted. In this analysis, flake cores were defined as objects that showed at least
three flake removals or attempted removals from a discernable platform(s). Within this
broad definition, some distinct patterns are evident.
Metric data from flake cores are presented in Appendix G. Measurements that were
taken are described below.
•

Maximum Length: Straight-line length in mm from the proximal to the most distal point on the core was taken using sliding calipers.

•

Maximum Width: The widest point in mm on the core between the lateral margins, taken with sliding calipers.

•

Maximum Thickness: Taken at the point of greatest thickness on an axis perpendicular to the length and width as measured in mm with sliding calipers.

•

Weight: Measured directly on an electronic scale in grams.

Regarding metric data for flake cores, it should be noted that these calculations
represent only the general size of the core when it was discarded. No attempt was made
to correlate the size of flake scars evident on cores with observed or measured trends
in flake tools. It is impossible to know the original size of any flake core before it was
reduced. In order to analyze and interpret the variation within the Zatopec flake core
assemblage, flake cores were sorted into various categories and subcategories on the
basis of perceived core reduction strategies. Core categories are described, and trends
identified over time, in size and weight as well as approaches to core reduction, are
presented in Chapter 11.
Flake Core Reduction Strategies
Following the initial sorting, flake cores and core fragments were then placed into
categories based on perceived approaches to core reduction. Two main approaches
are recognized, bifacial and non-bifacial; most cores were classified based on these
approaches, though others exhibited unpatterned or weakly patterned flaking and
were placed into additional categories. Core categories include multidirectional, ad hoc,
unidirectional, discoidal (type A and type B), burinated, tested cobbles, recycled bifacial,
and maintenance and debris. Some of these categories observe differences in complexity
of core design. For example, the removal of flakes aligned in approximately the same
direction from a common platform (unidirectional core) is distinguished from a core with
two active faces and platforms. Cores with two or more faces can be either discoidal if

301

they are bifacial (i.e., having opposing faces that both share the same platform edge) or
multidirectional if the core was rotated in at least two directions in order to maintain
suitable platforms. In addition to the relationship between core face(s) and platform(s)
(i.e., bifacial or non-bifacial), categories depend on the direction(s) of flake removals, and
how this was accomplished by rotating the core. Multidirectional cores show patterned
flake removals in multiple directions; these cores were rotated on two or more axes
(see below). Unidirectional cores were rotated on only a single axis. Importantly, these
two categories show little evidence for an ongoing, alternating relationship between
face(s) and platform(s). That is, flaking was not done alternately between the face and
platform. Rather, each surface was flaked serially before the core was rotated. A bifacial
approach to flake cores, which include discoidal cores and recycled biface fragments,
is similar to the manufacture of bifaces in that two opposing faces are worked in
conjunction with one another. In this analysis, the distinction between bifacial and nonbifacial approaches to removing flakes from flake cores is the most significant factor in
defining core categories. Numbers in parentheses following each type indicate the total
recovered from analytical units.
Multidirectional Flake Cores (n = 36)
Multidirectional cores are characterized by flake removal from multiple directions
and from more than one platform surface (Figure 7-58). Flake removals oriented along
multiple axes occur simultaneously; this is achieved by continuously rotating the core
in various directions between approximately 45 and 120 degrees. This strategy results
in multiple active faces, any two of which can be aligned nearly perpendicular to each
other, or faces that encroach on active platforms corresponding with other active
faces. The defining characteristic of multidirectional cores is that rotation occurs along
more than one axis. These cores reflect a developed knowledge of requirements for
removing flakes in that most of a nodule’s surface is considered suitable for removals.
They indicate an ability to envision necessary angles and ridges for guiding potential
removals in several dimensions at the same time. Importantly, the relationship between
faces and platforms is not bifacial in the sense that flaking does not alternate between
these surfaces. These cores represent a fundamentally different approach to removing
flakes than what is seen on virtually all successful bifaces (i.e., those not exhibiting
random flaking).
Ad Hoc Cores (n = 6)
Ad hoc flake cores are a subcategory of multidirectional flake cores. These cores show
some rotation, but no patterned faces or platforms have been developed. Ad hoc cores
display little to no platform maintenance, and some flake removals appear exploratory
in nature.

302

Figure 7-58. Examples of multidirectional cores from Zatopec. Rotation between the two
faces of Specimen 1123-63 involved rolling the top of the core back 90 degrees along
a horizontal axis and then rotating the core counter-clockwise 90 degrees on another
horizontal axis. Rotation of Specimen 1159-13 involved rotating the core approximately
120 degrees around a vertical axis and then making another 90 degree counterclockwise rotation on a horizontal axis.

Unidirectional Flake Cores (n = 9)
Unidirectional cores show unifacial approaches to flaking. Flake removals are all
oriented in approximately the same direction, and these cores are rotated along a single
axis. As platforms are maintained to facilitate additional removals from the face, the
edge between these surfaces assumes a sinuous form. Well developed unidirectional
cores have well established platform surfaces and can even resemble blade cores,
illustrating the technological similarities that at least some blade production has with
some flake removal (see earlier discussion about blade-like flakes) (Figure 7-59). Like
multidirectional cores, most unidirectional cores are not bifacial.

303

Figure 7-59. Examples of unidirectional flake cores from Zatopec. If Specimen 268-5
(top) showed evidence of prismatic blade removal, it would have been classified as a
blade core.

Discoidal Flake Cores (n = 25)
Discoidal flake cores have a sinuous edge where the face and platform surfaces come
together. These cores are rotated along a single horizontal axis, and are distinguished
from the previous types discussed in that flaking alternates to some degree between
removals from the core face and the platform. In this sense, discoidal cores are bifacial
cores. Distinguishing between the platform surface and the face on discoidal cores
can be difficult, but in this analysis we observe a difference in platform angle between
these two surfaces. Generally, platforms are more acute and core faces are less acute.
This often creates an asymmetrically bi-convex cross-section, with the core face much
more convex than the platform. Not all discoidal cores show equivalent rotation, and
we distinguish Type A and Type B discoidal flake cores as those rotated between 180
degrees and 360 degrees and those rotated less than 180 degrees, respectively (Figure
7-60). This distinction is arbitrary in cases where cores are rotated almost or just
beyond 180 degrees, although it helps to differentiate those showing minimal rotation
from those that are well developed and have been in use for relatively long periods of
time. Some Type A cores are completely rotated (360 degrees) and it is possible that
they were fashioned from discarded bifaces or biface fragments.

304

Figure 7-60. Examples of discoidal flake cores from Zatopec. Specimens 180-16 and
183-5 are Type A and 193-4 is Type B.

305

A number of artifacts were recovered that show unpatterned or weakly patterned
flake removal, and therefore do not fit into discoidal, unidirectional, or multidirectional
cores categories. Some types, especially burinated cores, appear patterned in specialized
ways that render them difficult to compare directly with more common types. Finally,
several artifacts were recovered that reflect maintenance of flake cores, such as removal
of prior knapping errors. Other categories into which flake cores were sorted include
burinated cores, tested cobbles, recycled bifacial flake cores, and core maintenance
debris.

Figure 7-61. Examples of burinated flake cores from Zatopec.

306

Burinated Flake Cores (n = 1)
Burinated flake cores show signs of the removal of a burin blade from an
opportunistic angle along a fractured edge (Figure 7-61). A burin blade is defined as
a small prismatic blade that is rectangular in transverse section, and that is thick in
relation to its length (Crabtree1972: 50). These are specialized prismatic blades and
are often very small in size. Recovering burins (the removed blades) is often difficult
using 1/4-in-mesh screen, and the burinated cores frequently are more common in
archaeological assemblages. In some cases, the removal of the burin left the core itself
suitable for use as a tool, whereas in other cases it is presumed that the intended
objective of the detachment was the removal of the long, slender flake. Burin blades
were also frequently removed from other kinds of artifacts, including the margins of
projectile points. Because many kinds of artifacts can be burinated, burinated cores
include only items that were not sorted into other technological categories.
Tested Cobbles (n = 13)
Tested cobbles include chert nodules from which a few, largely exploratory flakes
have been removed (Figure 7-62). The removal of these few flakes is seen to represent
a knapper testing the quality of the chert and its suitability for further reduction.
Tested cobbles reflect part of the process of harvesting raw material for tool production.

Figure 7-62. Example of a tested cobble, with alternating flake detachments at top, from
Zatopec.

307

Presumably, most of the tested cobbles recovered from Zatopec were considered
unsuited for further use and were discarded. Of flake cores, not all tested cobbles have
at least three flake detachments; some have only one or two removals for the purpose of
exposing interior material.
Recycled Bifacial Flake Cores (n = 1)
Recycled biface flake cores strongly resemble fragments of bifaces that broke or were
discarded at some point and that were recycled into flake cores. Typically, these have no
remaining cortex on either face (unlike many of the discoidal cores that would otherwise
resemble recycled bifaces). Flake scars on these cores tend to be short and steep, and are
commonly removed from both faces. The edge where the two faces come together is far
more sinuous and wavy than on most late-stage bifaces.
Core Maintenance and Debris (n = 15)
Core maintenance and debris includes flakes removed from core faces that have
stacks or knots (prematurely terminated flakes). Some flakes were recovered that had
been removed from core platforms. These have one or more surfaces shaped by proximal
end flake scars and had been removed from a direction perpendicular to the orientation
of the scars on the other surface(s). These flakes had been removed from the platform
surface of flake cores and perhaps blade cores, although without more of the blade/flake
scar present, it is often impossible to distinguish between flake and blade core platform
preparation. Though technically part of the debitage category, we include these artifact
descriptions here since they represent part of the process of creating and maintaining
useful, productive flake cores.

308

Debitage
Spencer LeDoux and Jon C. Lohse

Lithic debitage is defined as stone artifacts modified by humans that were not used as
cores or tools (Sullivan and Rozen 1985:755). In the analysis of materials from Zatopec,
tools are defined as any object with recognizable alteration or macroscopic edge damage
from use, and include both formal and informal tools (see Tomka 2001). All other
chipped or fractured chert pieces were included in the debitage category. The category
contains 204,939 items, all of which were recovered using 1/4-in-mesh screens.
Following an analytic methodology similar to that applied at the Gatlin Site (Houk
et al. 2008), debitage was placed into the following categories: complete flakes, proximal
flake fragments, flake fragments, burned, and shatter/chunks. Complete flakes include
a platform and a distinct feather or hinge termination. Proximal flake fragments
exhibited a clear striking surface, but the termination was obscured by breakage
(Sullivan and Rozen 1985). It was recognized that this category might also include
complete flakes with step terminations; however, we did not attempt to differentiate
between step terminations and pre-/post-depositional breakage. Flake fragments are
any flake that has lost its striking platform. Burned debitage is any lithic artifact that
does not meet the previous categories and has extensive signs of heat treatment such
as pot-lids. Finally, shatter/chunks include lithic items that did not correspond to any
of the other categories; these are angular and do not exhibit clearly define flaking
necessary for identifying flake cores. Most if not all of the large shatter/chunk pieces
probably originate from “smash and grab” activities for breaking open chert nodules
using uncontrolled bipolar percussion, or from other hard hammer blows administered
to remove cortex and expose interior surfaces. Smaller pieces are those that commonly
detach from around the striking platform during flake removal, especially flaking
using hard hammer percussion. Debitage from each lot was sorted into categories, then
counted, bagged, and labeled. Total counts are shown in Table 7-45. Debitage from
provenances lacking temporal control was not further analyzed, leaving a reduced but
more useful sample for making meaningful conclusions (Table 7-46). A complete listing
of the analytical unit debitage counts and weights is in Appendix H. From these totals,

lots that were located in identifiable analytical units were analyzed.

In recent years, there has been debate over the usefulness of debitage analysis,
particularly in contract archaeology in Texas (see Andrefsky 2001; Black 1993; Masson
1998). Most of this debate centers not on the debitage, but on the uses to which these
data are put. A quick and informal review of some analyses of archaeological debitage
assemblages performed in Texas archaeology shows that debitage is commonly used
for three recurring purposes: technological analysis, chert sourcing, and identifying
loci of tool-making activity (see Black and McGraw 1985; Houk et al. 2008; Johnson
2000; Lukowski 1987; Masson 1998). The present analysis of debitage from Zatopec
endorses the view that the study of debitage can be informative but also recognizes the
validity of recent critiques deploring what some consider to be a lack of innovative ideas
and approaches (see Black 1993). As a result, this analysis focuses on technological
trends and variation over time. Specific questions guiding this research are addressed
through certain aspects of debitage production and usage patterns, and numerical
data illustrating important trends are emphasized over general description and
characterization of the entire debitage assemblage. In Chapter 11, these data are used to
draw conclusions about the different Zatopec task groups who made and used debitage.
Methodology
All flakes were weighed together by lot. Proximal fragments, flake fragments, burned,
and shatter debris were then excluded from further analysis, since it was believed that
analysis of complete flakes would be more informative. Rather than using aggregate
analysis (Ahler 1989b), complete flakes were analyzed using debitage attribute analysis
(Andrefsky 2001). Each piece was measured in millimeters for its maximum width,
length, and thickness. The long axis originates with the platform and the wide axis
runs perpendicular to the long axis. Several observed data were also recorded. Amount
of dorsal cortex was observed and grouped as follows: 0 percent, 1–33 percent, 33–66
percent, 66–99 percent, and 100 percent. Based on the cautions advised in Sullivan
and Rozen (1985), this analysis avoids the use of terms like primary, secondary, and
tertiary. The presence and absence of patina was recorded, as well as whether the
patination was subsequently flaked through. Platform preparation was noted as
present, absent, or crushed. No distinction was made in the type of preparation, and
therefore raked, ground, polished, and faceted platforms are grouped together. Finally,
degree of platform smoothness was ranked on a scale from 1–5, roughest to smoothest.

310

This measurement was obtained by rubbing the prepared portion of the platform
along the edge of the analyst’s lower lip. We recognize that determining smoothness in
this fashion is somewhat subjective and that it would be difficult for later analysts to
replicate precisely the results. However, this subjectivity was accommodated by having
only a single analyst determine platform smoothness.
For the next phase of the debitage analysis, general flaking technologies were
identified. Complete flakes were sorted into non-thinning and thinning flakes. Nonthinning flakes are thick, typically have a large amount of cortex (though this factor
alone was not used to define thinning flakes), and frequently have unprepared
platforms. Among the notable traits of non-thinning flakes is that the ventral face
has no little if any concave curvature, and at times is convex. Thinning flakes are
proportionally thinner than non-thinning ones in comparison to their width and length.
The ventral surface is also typically concave.
In the analysis of debitage, the percussion method of flake removal was also
considered. Hammerstones can be made of a wide variety of hard stone materials,
such as chert or hard limestone cobbles. Billets (soft hammers), which were used by
flintknappers for the careful application of softer percussion blows, were typically made
of hard bone, antler, wood, or other relatively soft material. Billets provide an advantage
for controlling flake removals, and are commonly used to remove proportionally wide,
thin flakes from bifaces at later reduction stages. Work by Cotterell and Kamminga
(1979) has shown that there is a continuum from hard hammer flakes to billet flakes,
making it difficult to identify billet technology accurately.
However, Hayden and Hutchings (1989) have discussed an approach to lithic
analysis through which two specific types of flakes attributable to billet flaking can be
identified with almost complete certainty.
They labeled one of these flake types distinctive expanding billet flakes (DEBs),
described as having very narrow platforms and lateral edges that expand for more than
one half of the length of the flake (Figure 7-63). DEBs also have a pronounced curve and
are thin in comparison to their size (Hayden and Hutchings 1989:245).
The second flake type Hayden and Hutchings associated with billet technology is the
r flake, which results from a manufacture error where the percussor strikes too deeply
on the platform thereby removing a section of the edge of the biface that is wider than
intended (Hayden and Hutchings 1989:252). The platform of the r flake, commonly the
widest part of the flakes, is unusually large with a broad fracture area. The ventral
surface of the flake is characterized by a bending fracture that often creates a profile
somewhat similar in shape to the letter “r” (Figure 7-64).
Many other thinning flakes may also have been made by billet, but only DEBs and r
flakes can be accurately identified as billet flakes. This analysis focuses on DEBs and r
flakes in discussions about biface reduction and its implications.

311

small platform and symmetrically expanding edges define these as DEBs. All artifacts are
from the Toyah phase: A, B: lot 383; C–E: lot 1046; and F, G: lot 119.

In the debitage analysis, DEBs and r flakes were separated from other complete
flakes within each lot. Although this analysis refers to these flakes as billet flakes, it
is recognized that other flakes removed by billet are likely to also be present in the
assemblage. DEBs and r flakes were analyzed according to the same procedures as
complete flakes.
This analysis makes use of several statistical calculations. As with the rest of the
Zatopec analysis, raw artifact counts have been standardized by time and by excavated
volume before comparison (see Chapter 3). The chi-square test of independence was
used to analyze observed data; this test helps determine whether two variables are
related (Caldwell 2007). For example, chi-square can be used to show whether platform
preparation is related to cultural era. This statistic was calculated according to accepted
conventions, and Yates’s correction for continuity (a 0.5 reduction to the difference
between observed and expected frequencies) was applied when the expected frequency
of any cell was less than 5 (Caldwell 2007:262) (Figure 7-65).

when the expected frequency (fe) is less than 5.0.

The chi-square test is limited because it only identifies the existence of a
relationship. In order to identify where the observed variables were linked, a residual
analysis was performed using Haberman’s adjusted residual (Haberman 1974) (Figure
7-66). Haberman’s adjusted residual is used to identify variables that do not conform
to a hypothetical mean through the calculation of a Z score. In statistical analysis, a
Z score greater than +1.96 or less than -1.96 is considered a significant deviation from
this hypothetical mean. Each Z score in this analysis will also include the probability (p)
beyond which the value lies. Rather than calculating the exact probability, this analysis
uses the accepted intervals of p = .10, .05, .01, .001, and .0001, which conform to 90
percent, 95 percent, 99 percent, 99.9 percent and 99.99 percent accuracy respectively
(Caldwell 2007:81).

Analysis
Billet flakes, complete flakes, and all debitage were weighed by lots. The weight was
then divided by the total number of artifacts in the lot to generate and average weight
per artifact. Billet flakes were weighed both separately and in the total complete
flake (CF) weight. Results indicate that the overall size of debitage tends to decrease
over time, although the average size of both complete flakes and billet flakes remains
fairly stable overtime (Figure 7-67). The only obvious variation is during the Middle
Archaic, but this era only consists of two lots, and it is unlikely that this small sample is
representative.
In order to understand changes in technological behavior related to biface versus
non-biface production over time, we looked at billet flakes for additional information,
as these are an excellent indication of the manufacture of wide, thin bifaces. In terms
of their frequency, the number of billet flakes per century tends to increase over time
(Figure 7-68). Although suggestive, adjusted counts alone do not necessarily indicate
that billet flaking as a technology increased, as these flakes could be increasing along
with all other flakes that were generated at the site. We therefore compared the number
of billet flakes to the total number of complete flakes for each time period, generating
a ratio of billet flakes as a proportion of complete flakes (Figure 7-69). These ratios
indicate that billet flakes steadily increased over time not only in adjusted frequencies,
but also as a percentage of all complete flakes, with a notable increase from Austin to
Toyah times.
In order to test the importance of this increase, the chi-square test was calculated
for the three flake types in each cultural era. The test showed that there was a clear
relationship between flake type and cultural era (Table 7-47). These figures indicate
that the increase in billet flaking during the Toyah phase is statistically significant.
This increase is accompanied by a concurrent increase in general thinning flakes and a
decrease in non-thinning flakes. These findings support the established notions that a
specialized tool kit was developed and employed during the Toyah phase (Tomka 2001).

In addition to analyzing the technological aspects of debitage, we evaluated the
amount of dorsal cortex and on the amount of patination in order to recognize possible
changes in reduction patterns and also how some flakes might have been recycled from
earlier times. As noted earlier, this analysis avoids using the terminology primary,
secondary, and tertiary flakes. Instead, observed measurements were taken for the
dorsal cortex. Each artifact was categorized as 0 percent cortex, 1–33 percent cortex, 33–
66 percent cortex, 66–99 percent cortex, and 100 percent cortex. Patina was recorded as
being absent, present, or flaked through. Visually assessing patination is often difficult
(Johnson 2000), so our analysis was conservative with questionable white patinas being
assigned only to the cortex category.
Over time, the frequencies of flakes with different amounts of cortical do not
fluctuate radically (Table 7-48). Non-cortical flakes tend to dominate, always measuring

These figures indicate that billet flaking became steadily more common through time at

greater than 65 percent of the assemblage for any time period. Other possible trends
include the increase in flakes with 100 percent cortex in Austin and Toyah compared
with earlier times and the steady decrease in flakes with 1–33 percent cortex over
time. In general, the lack of cortical variation in general is not surprising. The cost of
resource extraction in time and labor was very low at Zatopec since there is an outcrop
of Edward’s chert adjacent to the site (Garber 1987:21).

The Chi-square test of independence initially indicated that there was a relationship
between type of cortex and cultural era (χ2 = 55.779; p < . 0001). However, after
calculating the Z scores for each column, no pattern emerged. Instead, each era had
significant increases or decreases in several of the categories. In order to simplify
the data, the middle three cortex categories (between 1 percent and 99 percent) were
collapsed and a comparison was made between no cortex, some cortex, and complete
cortex. Again, there was no pattern between cortex and cultural era, even though
chi-square implied a relationship (χ2 = 47.231; p < .0001). The only notable exception
might be the Toyah phase. During this period, flakes with no cortex increased slightly
and flakes with 100 percent cortex decreased slightly, with a comparable decrease in
flakes with some cortex (1–99 percent). Z scores and probabilities are indicated in Table
7-49. The increase of interior flakes (those with 0 percent cortex) may support earlier
evidence for the increased production and use of bifaces as part of a specialized tool kit
in the Toyah phase. The decrease of cobble flakes (those with 100 percent cortex on their
dorsal surfaces), particularly from Late Archaic II to Austin and continuing into Toyah,
implies that the locus of initial cobble reduction moved to the site itself. One possible
interpretation of this pattern is that structured contexts for learning and enculturation
associated with removing outermost flakes as part of the process of evaluating the
quality of raw materials shifted from nearby localities where raw material was initially
collected to a more central, on-site location.

Patina on flakes at the site offers both expected returns and a few anomalous results
(Table 7-50). In the Toyah phase, there is a marked increase in the number of flakes
with patination, with a concurrent decrease in non-patinated flakes. It is likely that this
is a direct result of the relatively recent Toyah deposit combined with site formation
processes (see Chapter 4). That is, flakes deposited during Toyah times were not buried
by later deposition at the site. The only other statistically significant change is seen in
patinated recycled flakes during the Austin phase. During Austin times there was more
recycling (patinated flakes that were subsequently flaked) than expected (z = 2.87; p =
.01). Presently, we offer no explanation to account for these changes but suggest that
future analysts keep these possible trends in mind when examining other assemblages.
It is worth noting that, although the frequencies of patinated flakes seem to show
relatively minor variation, the data concerning patinated flake tools (see above) strongly
indicate that some Toyah flake tool-makers were preferentially selecting readily
available flakes that had been previously struck and then discarded for use as tools.

The final portion of the debitage analysis at Zatopec focuses on platform preparation
and smoothness. As mentioned above, degree of smoothness was assessed on a scale
from 1–5. Degree of smoothness (DoS) 1 is very rough with the platform having sharp
abrasions that would frequently snag the skin of the analyst. DoS 2 is also rough, but
it less sharp and did not snag. DoS 3 has raking or abrading that is easy to feel, but is
easy to rub across the lips. DoS 4 is rather smooth but has an occasional place where
grinding or abrading could be felt. DoS 5 is visibly prepared and highly smoothed to
the same degree as a marble. For this analysis, DoS 5 was disregarded since there only
eight artifacts in total had with this degree of smoothness.

318

Platform preparation and crushing was examined for DEBs, r flakes, other thinning
flakes, and non-thinning flakes. As discussed previously for platform preparation,
raked, ground, polished, and faceted platforms are grouped together. DEBs showed a
consistently higher frequency of preparation than all other flakes and are markedly
higher than all thinning flakes combined (Figure 7-70). Although platform preparation
on DEBs is well above the average, platform preparation for r flakes, the other kind of
billet flake considered here, is slightly higher than average for Late Archaic I and for
Toyah, although it is the lowest for Late Archaic II and Austin. These data suggest that
billet flaking involved a complex set of techniques including better or more intensive
platform preparation than for other flakes, but that over time knapper performance
varied considerably with respect to preparing platforms. As mentioned earlier, Hayden
and Hutchings (1989) consider r flakes to be a manufacturing error caused by striking
the object too far away from the edge. Generally, across all time periods knappers
making successful billet flakes (DEBs) invested the most time in platform preparation.
However, the fact that platform preparation for r flakes varies strongly between these
periods, with frequent preparation in LAI, much less in LAII and Austin, and then
more in Toyah, suggests that Late Archaic I and Toyah billet flake-removers spent more
time preparing platforms, even when those flake removals resulted in errors, than in

Figure 7-70. Frequency of platform preparation for types of thinning flake and for all
thinning flakes combined.

319

the middle two time periods. This kind of performance variation represents an overall
greater attention to the technical requirements for removing billet flakes (preparing
platforms) regardless of whether those removals were successful or were errant (DEBs
versus r flakes). To us, these data reveal technological performance variation with
respect to the manufacture of proportionally wide, thin bifaces, with better performance
during the early and late periods in our sample compared with Late Archaic II and
Austin.
Degree of platform smoothness (DoS) was measured in order to provide another
indication of how different knappers prepared platforms prior to removal. This analysis
assumes that platform smoothness was an important aspect of an ability to consistently
remove broad, thin flakes by billet. Variation in the degree to which different kinds
of flakes were smoothed can help identify the outcomes of better informed or more
highly skilled (as well as those who performed more poorly) knappers who contributed
to the site’s overall debitage assemblage. DoS was assessed in the manner previously
described, and data show that most prepared platforms were quickly prepared and were
very rough with DoS 1 (Figure 7-71).
The DoS scores 2–4 tend to cluster together for Late Archaic I, II, and Austin, with

Figure 7-71. Adjusted counts of flakes having prepared platforms grouped according to
their assigned Degree of Smoothness. Greater differentiation in smoothness is seen in
the Toyah phase.

320

DoS 1 being much more common during all time periods, indicating that most people
were preparing platforms in a similar manner. There is some slight variation in terms
of how platforms were smoothed in Late Archaic II, which could be a by-product of
the manufacture of certain kinds of broad-bladed dart points (e.g., Castroville) closely
associated with bison hunting (see projectile point discussion, above). In the Toyah
phase, however, the pattern differentiates more strongly as DoS categories become
increasingly distinct. By the Toyah phase, DoS 1 is still the most common, though has
increased sharply from Austin times, and the number of flakes that were assessed DoS
values 2, 3, and 4 all increase. This trend is reflected in the frequency of each degree
of smoothness across the cultural eras (Table 7-51), indicating that there is greater
variation in the degree to which platforms were smoothed in Toyah compared with
earlier times.
Table 7-51. Frequency of the Degree of Smoothness for each time period. Standard
deviation indicates that during Toyah there was greater variation in the degree to
which knappers were smoothing their platforms.

The degree to which platforms were smoothed over time is a key line of evidence
for helping understand different approaches to and degrees of participation in this
activity as a part of the production of wide, thin bifaces. What these data show is that,
in general, Toyah knappers spent a good deal more time preparing platforms prior to
removing flakes than in any earlier time period. In addition, the frequencies of degrees
of smoothness are approximately the same in earlier time periods, reflecting that
knappers were not clearly differentiated from each other except for those who only
marginally smoothed their platforms. However, in Toyah times knapper performance
diverges, with notable differences in terms of how much time different knappers were
spending on this task. In our view, this shift toward not only more platform smoothing
but also toward greater differentiation between the degrees of smoothness, indicate

321

that biface-makers during this period of site history were spending their time in much
different ways than they had in previous periods in the production of these flakes.
Conclusion
The analysis of debitage at Zatopec shows several trends. First, billet flaking as seen in
the production of DEBs and r flakes becomes much more prominent during the Toyah
phase. At the same time, interior flakes with 0 percent cortex and 100 percent cortical
flakes significantly increase. Changes in the frequency of flakes with 0 percent and 100
percent cortex are probably related to two separate factors that include (1) an increase
in biface production at the site and (2) a change in how initial cobble reduction was
taking place, from elsewhere to on-site. The change with respect to increased cortical
flakes, combined with the shifts that have been previously noted concerning increases
in flake cores, demonstrate that where and how chert cobbles were processed on site
changed in Toyah times. More chert cobbles appear to have been returned to the site,
where more first-stage reduction took place. Some implications for what this meant for
changes in labor roles are explored in Chapter 11.
In addition to chert nodule reduction, differences are noted in platform treatment
through time and these data identify shifts in technological approaches to biface
production. Billet flaking in general became more common in Toyah as wide, thin
bifaces common to Toyah assemblages were increasingly produced (see Chapter 11).
The ability to successfully remove billet flakes depends in part on adequate platform
preparation. Platform preparation was seen on the majority of billet flakes in each
cultural era, however, platform smoothness was differentiated in Toyah times as never
before. In our view, differences in platform smoothness show that Toyah knappers were
more clearly distinguishing themselves from each other in terms of how much time they
spent on their tasks, as indirectly reflected in platform smoothness, than knappers in
earlier times. These data help show that levels of skill in stone tool production, in terms
of understanding the technical requirements for successful billet flaking and dedicating
more time on necessary tasks, became more variable in the Toyah phase. Some possible
implications of this technological shift are explored in more detail later (see Chapter 11).

Pecked, Ground,

and

Abraded Stone Artifacts

Julian A. Sitters

Non-chipped stone tools are stone artifacts that were modified through battering,
pecking, grinding, notching, and/or grooving. This category contains 25 specimens,
including hammerstones; grinding stones such as manos, metates, and grinding slabs;
and other stones modified in different ways. Very few of these artifacts were recovered
from controlled temporal contexts (n = 6), and therefore no discussion about changing
trends is possible.
Methodology
Specimens were categorized based on how each was modified. In most cases, alterations
indicate how the artifact was used. Based on patterns of wear and alteration, tool types
include hammerstone (complete and fragments), mano, metate-like, grinding slab, and
miscellaneous stone tools. A miscellaneous category includes indeterminate abraded and
ground stones. Each specimen was measured for maximum length, width, and thickness
in millimeters, and was weighed to the nearest 0.1 g. The shape, material composition,
completeness, and use-wear of each specimen were described. Finally, shapes of the
midsection and the ends were described. This analytical methodology follows Sullivan
(1998:703) and is commonly applied to ground stone artifacts from the larger Central
Texas region.
Artifact shapes are oval, round, rectangular, angular, square, irregular, and
indeterminate. Raw materials include quartzite, limestone, sandstone, and chert.
Each specimen was described as complete, end missing, end only, edge missing, corner
fragment, medial fragment, or other. Use-wear attributes include pecking, battering,
unifacial grinding, bifacial grinding, polish, notching, grooving, and heel facets. Impact
damage, such as battering, tends to be present in the form of crushed edges (Andrefsky
2005). Pecking was identified as an abrasive and pitted surface. Polishing was
recognized by a smooth and glossy surface. Unifacial and bifacial grinding refers to the
number of modified surfaces created during use. Grooves were identified as long, narrow
impressions. Notches are v-shaped indentations (Sullivan 1998:703); these are sharper
than grooves. Heel facets are angled edges formed when pressure is applied by the heel
of the palm to one edge of the stone (Johnson 1997:73). All of these recorded data are
presented in Table 7-52. Below, each artifact is described and representative examples
of each category are illustrated.

Results
Hammerstones
Hammerstones were used to remove flakes from an objective piece such as a core or
a biface. Nine specimens fall within this category, including four fragments. Specimen
74-2 (Figure 7-72) is a complete, oval-shaped chert cobble with apparent battering on
both ends. Specimen 172-4 is an oval-shaped chert cobble with battering on one end. The
other end of this specimen is broken. Specimen 1006-1 (see Figure 7-72) is a complete,
oval-shaped, chert cobble with heavy battering around the entire circumference. Pecking
is present on one end, and the midsection is polished, possibly from being stream
rolled. Specimen 1190-1 (Figure 7-73) is a complete oval-shaped hammerstone of purple
quartzite with light battering on one end. The opposite end is irregular in shape as a
result of a flake removal. Grooving is present on both lateral edges and is also visible on
the midsection. This specimen was located near Burial 1, and is one of only a couple of
artifacts from Zatopec made from purple quartzite. Specimen 1041-4 is a complete, ovalshaped chert cobble with heavy battering on each end. The pattern of battering reflects
the rotation of the specimen during use. Specimen 599-4 (see Figure 7-72) is a complete,
oval-shaped chert hammerstone. This specimen was recycled from an exhausted bifacial

core as evidenced from a number of feather, hinge, and step terminations visible on
the midsection and ends. Heavy battering is present around the circumference of the
artifact. The specimen is patinated at one end, and the rest of the artifact has been
worked, possibly by a different knapper. Specimen 171-14 is a hammerstone fragment
composed of chert with heavy battering along the ridge lines. This specimen appears
to be slightly patinated and shows signs of use-wear along its lateral edges, which
occurred after being removed from the objective piece. Specimen 188-10 (Figure 7-74) is
an oval-shaped chert hammerstone fragment. This fragment displays wear in the form
of pecking and polishing. Specimen 162-1 (see Figure 7-74) is the end of a hammerstone
made from a chert cobble and has heavy pecking on both sides. Specimen 479-6 is a
chert hammerstone fragment with heavy battering, and that has retained multiple flake
scars.

Mano-Like Stones
Mano-like stones are ground stone tools believed to have been used to process plant
materials. They are frequently used in conjunction with metates, or basin-like slabs
upon which grinding occurs. Manos tend to be small and ovoid in shape, with a flat or
nearly flat grinding face (Morris 1990). There are nine of these specimens.
Specimen 1-3 is a quartzite mano fragment. This fragment shows pecking and
dulling along its lateral edges. Both faces are smooth, possibly polished, and the artifact
is made of the same material as 1190-1, discussed above. Specimen 88-3 (Figure 7-75) is
a round quartzite mano. Both faces are flat and smooth, forming a heel facet at one end.
One end is lightly crushed, and the other has been heavily battered. Hairline
fractures are present throughout, suggesting that is has been subjected to heavy impact.
Specimen 137-4 is an oval chert mano that is unifacially ground. One end is smooth
and flat, forming a heel facet, and the opposite end shows a flake removal. Mineral
precipitates obscure possible evidence of other modifications. This artifact is discolored
yellow and orange from exposure to heat. Specimen 190-11 (Figure 7-76) is an oval-

328

shaped, quartzite mano. The midsection
contains some hairline fractures and
has rough lateral edges. One face is flat
and smooth, possibly polished; the other
is slightly convex. Specimen 303-5 is a
square shaped chert mano. The artifact
has multiple faces, many of which are
smooth and concave. Apparent pecking
is present, though this may be natural.
Battering is also present on the edges at
one end. Specimen 535-2 (Figure 7-77) is
a quartzite mano. The lateral edge of the
artifact is rough and discolored, possibly
from grinding. One face is coarse, and
the other is smooth and flat and has an
apparent groove. Specimen 1006-4 is a
small, round chert mano. The midsection
is made up of two faces: one is smooth and
flat and the other is convex and coated
in mineral precipitates. Striations mark
the face. One end has a heel facet from
unifacial grinding, and both ends are
battered. Specimen 1078-1 is a round
chert mano. The midsection has two faces,
one of which has small concave divots and
the other is flat and relatively smooth.
One end appears to have formed into a
heel facet, and the other is round and
unmodified. Specimen 1152-1 is an oval
chert mano. The midsection is shaped
by two nearly identical faces; these are
smooth and show faint signs of pecking.
One end shows heavy battering and
pecking, and the other is flat and smooth.

Metate-like Stones
Metates are implements that are used in conjunction with manos. Generally,
metates appear in three different forms: slab, shallow-basined, and deep-basined (Mohr
1954:394), the difference being the degree of concavity among the grinding surfaces.
Striations are frequent among metates and always run longitudinally, parallel with

329

the primary direction of grinding motion
(Mohr 1954:354). The current collection
is small, only two specimens. They are
labeled metate-like stones because they do
not conform to classic examples of ground
metates described from other sites.
Specimen 1061-5 is oval-shaped
and composed of chert. The midsection
is composed of two faces. One face is
slightly concave with striations, and the
other face is smooth and flat with some
natural inclusions. Both ends appear to be
unmodified, and minor natural inclusions

is an irregular shaped metate-like stone
made of sandstone. This artifact has two
faces. One is flat, smooth, and slightly recessed with striations, and the other has an
uneven surface and is darker in color. The ends have broken off and the lateral edges
are rigid and uneven.
Grinding Slabs
Grinding slabs are stone implements used in the processing of food. Similar to
metates but larger in size, grinding slabs are also used in conjunction with a mano or
other hand held implement. Only one specimen, Specimen 1121-10, made of limestone,
falls into this category (Figure 7-79). The end of the artifact is rounded with a concave
face. The face is relatively smooth and contains some striations, which may be of
natural origin. The opposite face has a large irregular divot where a flake has been
removed. The lateral edges are round and show no signs of human modification. The
concave depression is relatively shallow, though broad, indicating that this slab was not
heavily used before it was discarded.
Miscellaneous Stones
This category, with four specimens, includes stone implements that show
modifications that are either non-patterned or indeterminate. Specimen 1123-65 is
irregular in form, composed of limestone, and is missing one end (Figure 7-80). The
midsection of the specimen has an incised notch. The purpose of this notch is not known
and it is almost certainly a natural feature of the slab. However, there is a sharp,
asymmetrical v-shaped incision at the edge of the notch. Closeup photographs of the
incision suggest that it could have resulted from grinding edges of bifaces. This artifact
is interpreted as having been formed by being used in the manufacture of bifacial tools

330

that required smoothed and ground platforms. This specimen does not show any other
definitive signs of use or modification.
Specimen 1009-1 is round and made of chert. One end is coated with mineral
precipitates and may have been used as a mano; the other end shows no signs of usewear (Figure 7-81). This artifact was encountered with Feature 07-1, a cluster of billet
flakes and biface fragments (see Chapter 5) and was collected for this reason. The
artifact is identical to other pebbles seen in lower deposits at the site that contain faint
gravel stringers and accumulations from earlier flood events, and these deposits are
undoubtedly the source of this object. Its uses are unknown, though its regular crosssection appearance suggests a cultural origin.

appears to show some cultural modification in the form of the v-shaped incision.

332

Figure 7-81. Smoothed, regular-shape pebble recovered in association with Feature 07-1.

Specimen 1108-3 is an irregularly shaped limestone cobble (Figure 7-82). Two long
narrow striations are present near the center of the midsection, and the opposite face
has multiple inclusions. These striations are shallow and are at most 41.84 mm long.
The striations are partially covered in mineral precipitates, indicating that they are old
and not the result of excavation damage. The causes of these incisions are unknown,
although they may have been used to grind the edges of bifaces or other objects.
The final artifact in this category, Specimen 1012-2, is a square-shaped limestone
slab. One face is rough and irregular, and the other is smooth and flat. There are no
signs of obvious wear present on either face. One end of the specimen contains multiple
inclusions and the other end has a 90-degree notch incised into it (Figure 7-83). This
notch is the only possibly cultural attribute of this specimen. As with Specimen 1123-65,
the notch may have been used to grind the lateral edges of bifaces and prepare striking
platforms. This artifact was recovered near the flaking cluster of Feature 07-1 and is
interpreted as part of the site furniture that accompanied that work station.

Bioarchaeological Analysis

of

Human Remains

Editor’s note

E

xcavations at Zatopec recovered three sets of human remains
and part of the left femur of a fourth individual. During
analysis at the Forensic Anthropology Center at Texas State
University, an extra frontal (face) bone was identified. This bone
could possibly be associated with the individual (#4), otherwise
represented by only the femur. Consequently, the total count of
individuals at the site is at least four and possibly five.
Samples were submitted for dating to the PaleoResearch Institute
in Golden, Colorado (see Chapter 5). Samples were also submitted
to the Center for Archaeological Research at the University of
Texas at San Antonio for isotopic analyses in order to reconstruct
dietary history. Dating and isotopic analyses were performed in
consultation with Native American tribes as required by the Native
American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act and, inasmuch
as possible, to assess the cultural affiliation of the individuals.
In order to enlarge the bioarchaeological population from the
San Marcos area for comparative analyses, two additional partial
remains previously recovered from nearby site 41HY161 on the
Texas State University campus (Garber and Glassman 1992), which

336

were housed at CAS, were also analyzed. When evaluated against
a database from the Texas Coastal Plain, isotopic 13C and 15N
values from the Zatopec remains indicate a reliance on a mostly
terrestrial diet that probably included some riverine resources.
One individual from 41HY161 followed a similar dietary history,
while the other appears to have relied heavily on marine coastal
resources. This individual probably originated from the Coast and
migrated into Central Texas, where she was interred after her
death.

Descriptive Analysis of Skeletal Remains
of Three Individuals from Zatopec,
with Comparative Analysis of
Additional Sets of Remains from 41HY161
Kyra Stull and Michelle D. Hamilton

Human skeletal remains from the site 41HY163 were submitted to the Forensic
Anthropology Center at Texas State University-San Marcos for an extensive
anthropological analysis. These remains represent a minimum of four or a maximum of
five individuals.
Archaeological data, biological indicators, and overall taphonomic appearance all
indicate general prehistoric Native American with regard to cultural and biological
affiliation. Based on the incomplete and fragmentary nature of the remains, as well
as their prehistoric ages (see Chapter 5), which predate entry into the Central Texas
region by historically recorded tribal groups, further assessment of possible affiliation
with a specific tribe or population is not possible. Available dentition for Individual 1
and 3 displays significant wear (stages 6 and 7 on the canines and incisors and scores
6–10 for the molars) on all occlusal surfaces (Smith 1984; Scott 1979). Severe wear as
well as the patterning is consistent with prehistoric hunter-gatherer populations (Smith
1984). Inventories of all recovered skeletal elements are presented in Appendix I
Inventory and Condition of Remains from 41HY163
The remains were submitted in three separate boxes, with each box containing a single
individual. Contents of the boxes were all organized similarly with each bone in its
respective plastic bag labeled according to the element and side, as assessed in the field
during excavation. Orientations of remains and excavation procedures are presented
in Chapter 5. The skeletal remains have all been subjected to significant taphonomic
processes, including typical weathering patterns, root etching, plant activity and
adherence, as well as postmortem fractures. The classic weathering pattern and soil
adherence within the medullary cavities is characteristic of an extended earthen burial.
Although the remains are extremely fragmentary, osteometric data were maximized
through reconstruction efforts.
Included in the box with Individual 1 was a tibia bone fragment labeled as
Individual 4. This bone has a different color than the other skeletal elements, having
been bleached by exposure to the sun. It is lighter in color and more beige rather
than light brown. In addition, during the analysis of Individual 3, an extra piece of
frontal bone was found that displayed the diagnostic frontal crest and sagittal suture.

338

This duplication kept the minimum number of individuals at four and increased the
maximum number of individuals to five.
Individual 1
Sex. Non-metric cranial and postcranial morphological characteristics are indicative
of a male individual (Table 8-1). The supraciliary arches are prominent with blunt
and rounded supraorbital margins, tall chin height, a sharp ascending ramus of the
mandible. Overall there is a general robusticity of the entire skeleton (Buikstra and
Ubelaker 1994; Walker 2008).

Reconstructions for Individual 4 are tentative, and should be viewed as such.

Age. Skeletal age is estimated by examining multiple elements that exhibit
macroscopic changes during growth and development as well as degeneration. The age
of Individual 1 was assessed using pubic symphysis, auricular surface, general joint
morphology, and dental attrition.
The pubic symphysis fragment has a complete rim along with slight furrows,
placing it into Phase 4 (Suchey and Brooks 1990). The left and right auricular surfaces
were preserved on the os coxae. Both exhibited remnants of transverse striae, slight
granularity, beginnings of dense bone, and no porosity (Buckberry and Chamberlain
2002; Lovejoy et al. 1985). Root completion for the dentition indicates an individual
older than 25 years (Hillson 2002). However, the lack of significant osteophytic activity
on the vertebral bodies and articular surfaces indicates an individual less than 50 years
(Stewart 1958). Analysis of dental attrition identified significant wear on all the occlusal
surfaces, with the first molars, both mandibular and maxillary, showing the most
severity. The age range for this type of attrition places the individual between 30 and
45 years old at death (Smith 1984; Scott 1979). Evaluating all aforementioned material
allows for an age estimate of 30–50 years, with a narrow range of 30–40 years.
Stature. Stature was calculated using FORDISC 3.0 (Jantz and Ousley 2005),
a discriminant function software program that analyzes postcranial metric data. A
regression formula derived from the nineteenth century population with a 90 percent
prediction interval estimated the individual was between 65 and 69 inches tall.

339

Individual 2
Sex. The overall size and gracility of the remains as well as the non-metric and
metric morphological analyses are indicative of a female individual (see Table 8-1).
Pelvic morphology, including a wide pubic body, a narrow pubic symphyseal face, the
presence of a preauricular sulcus and dorsal pitting as well as a wide greater sciatic
notch, is characteristically female (Walker 2005, 2008). In addition, fragments of the
frontal bone also display female traits, such as reduced supraciliary arches, mastoid
processes, and occipital region (Walker 2008).
Age. Although the elements excavated and recovered are fragmentary, several
skeletal features were preserved that assist in estimating an accurate age at death.
The pubic symphyseal face displays billowing and furrows as well as the beginning
formation of the ossific nodule with no evidence rim formation, placing the individual
into Suchey and Brooks’s (1990) late phase 1/early phase 2. The other two areas that
provide statistically accurate age ranges deal with the presence or absence of epiphyseal
fusion. The sternal end of the left clavicle has no evidence of epiphyseal fusion (Shirley
2009) and the iliac crest shows evidence of recent fusion (Scheuer and Black 2000). The
age range that incorporates these developmental processes is 20–25 years.
Stature. Maximum femoral length measurement was analyzed using FORDISC
3.0 (Jantz and Ousley 2005) to develop a stature estimation of 58.8–63.4 in with a 90
percent confidence interval.
Individual 3
Sex. The skeletal remains associated with Individual 3 are characteristic of a female
(see Table 8-1). Cranial features examined for a sex estimation present themselves as
reduced supraciliary arches, external occipital protuberance, and mastoid processes
all of which are representative of a female (Walker 2008). In addition, there is a
preauricular sulcus on the left ilium, which is a feature characteristic of a female
(Buikstra and Ubelaker 1994).
Age. The auricular surface, one rib end, and multiple vertebral bodies were
sufficiently well preserved to facilitate an estimate of age at death. The surface texture
of the auricular surface of the left ilium is finely grained with a lack of any apical
change, along with minimal areas of densification (Buckberry and Chamberlain 2002).
Although the sternal rib end method is specifically derived for the right fourth rib, it
is possible to apply the technique to other ribs, resulting in a lack of accuracy as well
as statistical significance. The one preserved rib end demonstrates scalloping and
remnants of the central arc; there is neither plaque present nor any substantial change
in pit depth or width (Iscaan et al. 1985). The vertebral bodies that are present show no
evidence of osteophytic lipping, which usually indicates an individual under the age of
50 years (Stewart 1958). The skeletal features analyzed represent a middle-aged adult
with a broad estimated age range of 25–45 years.

340

Stature. Although Individual 3 is well preserved, there are no complete long bones
to allow for maximum length measurements, from which stature is typically derived.
Therefore, an estimation of stature is not possible for this individual.
Individual 4
An unassociated fragment of the left femur was also recovered from the site. The
fragment represents the distal third of the left femur, just superior to the condyles. This
bone has a different color than the other skeletal elements; it is lighter and more beige
than light brown. In regard to estimation of a biological profile, minimal information
can be gleaned. The bone is indicative of an adult individual, but an estimation of age
at death is not possible. The portion of the linea aspera that is present is more gracile
and the shaft has a significantly smaller circumference in comparison to the other
individuals. This feature would be consistent with an assumption of sex as female.
However, in view of the presence of only one skeletal element present assignment of sex
is not warranted.
Inventory and Condition of Remains from 41HY161
In addition to the four or perhaps five individuals from Zatopec, two sets of remains
that had been recovered from the Texas State University Campus in San Marcos
were reevaluated in order to enlarge the comparative sample for study. These two
individuals, which had been recovered during routine maintenance of the historic fish
ponds, had been previously analyzed (Garber and Glassman 1992). The present analysis
confirms and slightly revises the prior stature and age estimates for these individuals,
and should be considered the current and more accurate reconstruction.
As with the Zatopec specimens, archaeological data, biological indicators, and
overall taphonomic appearance all indicate a general prehistoric Native American
determination with regard to cultural and biological affiliation. Available dentition for
Individual 1 displays significant wear, stages 6 and 7 on the premolars, on all occlusal
surfaces (Smith 1984; Scott 1979). Severe wear as well as the patterning is consistent
with prehistoric hunter-gatherer populations (Smith 1984).
Both individuals are extremely fragmentary, with less than 25 percent of each
skeleton recovered. There is significant postmortem trauma, most likely inflicted by
heavy machinery during the excavation process. Although it was possible to reconstruct
some pieces, the fragmentary nature of these remains, especially of Individual 2, limits
formulation of biological profiles.
The skeletal remains have all endured significant taphonomic processes, including
typical weathering patterns. The classic weathering pattern and soil adherence within
the medullary cavities is characteristic of an extended earthen burial. The remains
are extremely fragmentary in nature and reconstruction efforts maximized available
osteometric data.

341

Individual 1
Sex. Only postcranial long bone elements are available for a sex estimation of this
individual. Metric analysis of the elements present classifies the individual as a female
(Table 8-2; France 1990). The reference collection, twentieth century American whites
and blacks, is not an adequate sample for this individual, but it does supply sectioning
point statistics to give a more sound sex determination.

Age. Although there is a lack of age indicators, a broad age range can be provided
for this individual. All epiphyses present are fused with no evidence of recent fusion,
making this an adult (Scheuer and Black 2000). There is no osteophytic activity on the
vertebral bodies or on any joint surface which indicates an individual under the age
of 50 (Stewart 1958). Because these are the only skeletal features present with age
indicators, it is only possible to say the individual is a middle-aged adult, most likely
25–45 years of age.
Stature. Based on the long bone lengths of the femur and tibia, a stature estimation
of 61.5–66.1 in could be derived with a 90 percent confidence interval using the
discriminant function software program FORDISC 3.0 (Jantz and Ousley 2005).
Taphonomic Processes. Thermal alterations on the distal humerus and ilium are
present as well as sharp force trauma on the distal femur. The thermal alterations on
the humerus show a black discoloration, or charring, on the posterior surface of the
medial epicondyle and portions of the postero-medial shaft. Charring is also located
on the ilium just inferior to the auricular surface located at the greater sciatic notch.
The burn pattern on the affected bones is abnormal and would suggest a postmortem
alteration rather than perimortem traumatic event (Symes et al 2008). The sharp force
trauma located on the distal femur is a complete cut just superior to the condyles. A
core of bone is not missing, the only portion absent is representative of the kerf width.
Polishing and clean striations on the opposing fragments indicate an action that was not
prehistoric in nature, but rather is the result of postmortem alteration.
Individual 2
Sex. The only two sex indicators present on the remains are two muscle attachment
sites, the linea aspera on the femur and the soleal line on the tibia. Neither are
extremely pronounced or reduced, and no metric data can be collected on the respective
elements. The lack of information that can be gleaned from the remains results in an
indeterminate sex estimation.

342

Age. Although a complete epiphysis is not present to determine if the epiphyses
are fused, the cortex development and integrity of the bone is representative of an
adult individual. An age at death range cannot be provided because of the absence of
elements.
Stature. A stature estimation cannot be derived considering the lack of skeletal
elements present with relative metric data for a proper estimation to be provided.
Conclusions
Four or perhaps five individuals are represented in the bioarchaeological population
from Zatopec, and another two were previously recovered from nearby 41HY161. As a
population representing prehistoric occupation in the San Marcos area, this number is
perhaps too small to warrant or sustain interpretive conclusions. Overall, no pathologies
or evidence of premortem trauma were observed, and it is likely that these individuals
maintained overall good health until their deaths. All remains that could be analyzed
for age or stature show that individuals lived into adulthood; Individual 2 from Zatopec
is the youngest of this small group with an estimated age at death of 20–25.
Five of the six confirmed individuals in this sample have been dated and these
results are presented in Chapter 5. Together, however, the five individuals represent
occupation in the area from 3510 ± 20 B.P. (Individual 2 at 41HY161) to 515 ± 20 B.P.
(Individual 1 at 41HY161), or the beginning of the Late Archaic through Toyah. The
three from Zatopec cluster tightly at 1215 ± 20 B.P. (Individual 2) to 1305 ± 20 B.P.
(Individual 3), providing excellent evidence for cultural and population continuity at this
site during the transition from Late Archaic II to Austin period, early Late Prehistoric
occupation. This demographic continuity, though limited to these three individuals,
supports the technological evidence presented in Chapter 7 for strong continuity at the
site between these two time periods in particular.
Isotopic analysis was also performed on the same five individuals for reconstructing
diet history in an attempt to identify their geographic point(s) of origin and possible
cultural affiliation. These results are presented below. In Appendix I are presented
inventories of elements that were present for five of the six individuals discussed here.

Stable Isotope Analysis of Human Skeletal Remains from 41HY163,
with Comparative Analysis of Remains from 41HY161
Cynthia M. Munoz, Raymond Mauldin, and Robert J. Hard

This report presents the results of stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of five
human bone collagen samples collected from archaeological skeletal remains from
sites 41HY163 and 41HY161, both in Hays County. Stable isotope analysis of bone
is a well-established technique for reconstructing paleodietary, paleoclimatic, and
paleoenvironmental patterns (see Ambrose 1986, 1991, 1993; DeNiro 1985, 1987;
DeNiro and Epstein 1981; Honch et al. 2006; Katzenberg 2000; Norr 1995; Richards
et al. 2006; Schoeninger et al. 1983; van der Merwe 1982). Carbon and nitrogen stable
isotope studies have been used extensively to investigate the comparative contribution
of C3 and C4 plants and their consumers to human diets, and to evaluate the role of
marine resources versus terrestrial resources in subsistence. The current study was
conducted in order to reconstruct paleodietary histories of the three individuals from
Zatopec, partly in an effort to try to determine their point(s) of origin and possible
cultural affiliation. The two samples from 41HY161 were included in order to augment
the sample available from the area.
Carbon and Nitrogen Isotopes
During photosynthesis, carbon stable isotopes are integrated into plant tissues.
Plants have the ability to obtain nitrogen from the soil or atmospherically. Herbivores
ingest these elements into their tissues, which are then consumed by omnivores and
carnivores. In humans, the ratios of stable carbon isotopes in bone collagen and apatite,
and ratios of nitrogen isotopes in bone collagen, mirror, with minor fractionations, the
isotopic compositions of the diet. However, dietary reconstruction from isotopic data in
humans is complex, a result in part of variances in how the carbon isotopes of different
food components (e.g., proteins vs. carbohydrates) are incorporated into bone tissues
(Ambrose and Norr 1993; Norr 1995). δ13C in collagen predominately reflects dietary
protein sources, while δ13C in apatite carbonate seems to reflect more closely the
isotopic composition of the whole diet (Ambrose and Norr 1993; Norr 1995), although
relationships are complex (see Kellner and Schoeninger 2007). The analysis reported
here only considers the δ13C from bone collagen. A future analysis of δ13C from apatite
carbonate would provide useful data on the composition of the protein and carbohydrate
portions of the diets of the individuals from 41HY161 and 41HY163. Human bone
collagen has been estimated to have stable carbon isotope values, measured as δ13C,
approximately 5 percent greater than the values reflected in the protein portion of their
diet (Ambrose and Norr 1993; Krueger and Sullivan 1984; Tykot 2004).

344

Interpretations of variation in nitrogen stable isotopes (δ15N), which are only
present in bone collagen, are underdeveloped. It appears that δ15N values in
human bone collagen are about the equivalent of the animal flesh consumed and
2–3 percent greater than nitrogen values of consumed plants (Ambrose and DeNiro
1986; Schoeninger and DeNiro 1984). δ15N values in humans that consume primarily
terrestrial plants and animals range from about 6 to 10 percent, while those that
primarily rely on marine resources are between 15 and 20 percent (Tykot 2004).
Finally, note that complete collagen replacement in adults requires 10 to 30 years
(Mays 1998). Stable isotope data on collagen therefore represents the diet averaged over
the final few decades of an individual’s life.
Methods
The analysis of stable carbon (13C/12C) and nitrogen (15N/14N) isotopic ratios in collagen
from archaeological human bone was used to identify differences in diet and resource
use by five prehistoric individuals from two Central Texas sites: two from 41HY161
and three from 41HY163, the Zatopec site. All sample preparation prior to stable
isotope analysis was completed at the Center for Archaeological Research (CAR) at
the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA). Subsequent to preparation at CAR,
processed and weighed collagen samples were submitted to the Colorado Plateau Stable
Isotope Laboratory for mass spectrometry analysis. Results reported here are delta (δ)
values in parts per mil (percent), relative to known standards, which are PDB (Peedee
belemnite) for carbon and air for nitrogen.
Because cortical bone is preferred for collagen extraction, we sampled fibulae from
41HY161 and ribs from 41HY163. Bone samples were cleaned of visible foreign material
and trabecular bone with a rotary sanding attachment at low speed followed by multiple
cleanings in distilled water in an ultrasonic bath. The samples were dried and then
crushed to small fragments (0.5–2 mm size) with a stainless steel mortar and pestle.
Approximately 100–200 mg of crushed bone was decalcified by reacting samples with
0.5N HCl (ultra-pure grade) in glass vials under refrigeration for 30 hours (Ambrose
and Norr 1992; Bocherens et al. 1991; DeNiro and Epstein 1981; Longin 1971).
Treatment in acid removes all acid-soluble substances, including phosphates and fulvic
acids. After repeated washing in deionized water, the samples were treated with 0.1N
NaOH for 45 minutes to remove humic acids and lipids. The samples were then rinsed
with deionized water until they yielded a neutral pH. The residue was then solubilised
with 0.01N HCl by heating at 70°C for 11 hours in closed glass vials. The supernatant
was freeze-dried under vacuum using a Labconco FreeZone Freeze Dry system, isolating
the collagen.
Once dried, ca. 550–700 μg of each sample was placed into tin capsules for
subsequent bulk stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis. The samples were

345

submitted to the Colorado Plateau Stable Isotope Laboratory at Northern Arizona
University (NAU) for isotopic analysis. The carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions,
along with the percent carbon and nitrogen by weight (percent C/wt and percent N/wt)
in collagen were measured by means of either a Carlo Erba NC2100 Elemental Analyzer
or Costech ECS4010 Elemental Analyzer attached on-line with a DELTA V Advantage
or DeltaPlus XP mass spectrometer configured through a CONFLO III for automated
continuous-flow analysis. The carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) was calculated by dividing
the percent C/wt by the percent N/wt. The resulting value was multiplied by 1.16667 to
obtain an atomic C/N ratio as reported by DeNiro (1985) and Ambrose (1990). All δ13C
values are reported relative to the Vienna Peedee Belemnite standard and δ15N values
are reported relative to atmospheric air,

⎛ Rsample

δ ( sample) = ⎜⎜

⎞

⎠

where R is the ratio of heavy to light isotope, e.g., 13C/12C for carbon or 15N/14N for
nitrogen.
Analytical uncertainties (1σ standard deviation) estimated for all isotope data
are ≤ 0.10 percent for δ13C and ≤ 0.20 percent for δ15N. Following the “multiple-point”
normalization technique (Paul et al. 2007), all raw isotopic data are normalized using
four International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reference standards (IAEA CH6,
CH7, N1, and N2). In-house standards used to quantify uncertainties of NAU Colorado
Plateau Stable Isotope Laboratory analyses include pine needles, apple leaves, tomato
leaves, bovine liver, mussel tissue, caffeine, and peach leaves (NIST 1547).
Collagen Preservation
Because archaeological bone has a high potential for postmortem diagenetic
alteration and collagen degradation, an assessment of archaeological bone quality is
required before attempting dietary interpretations from the isotopic values of the bone
fraction. Percent yield of collagen, percent C and percent N by weight, and carbon
to nitrogen (atomic C/N) ratios of bone collagen analyzed in this study were used to
evaluate sample quality (Ambrose 1990; Ambrose and Norr 1992; DeNiro 1985; Norr
1995) and are presented in Table 8-3 along with the isotope results.
Extraction yields were calculated for each burial. Collagen yields from bone are ideal
when greater than 5 percent, but yields as low as 1 percent have returned adequate
percent C/wt and percent N/wt and acceptable C/N ratios (Norr 1995) despite a 3
percent cutoff recommended by Ambrose (1990). All of the extracted collagen from the
two burial sites was adequately preserved, ranging from 10 percent to 29 percent (mean
= 17 percent, 1 σ = 7.4 percent). The 41HY161 samples averaged 17 percent, 1 σ = 0.7
percent collagen yield from bone, whereas the 41HY163 averaged 17 percent, 1 σ = 10.4
percent. The carbon abundance (percent C by weight) ranges from 40.6 percent to 44.8

percent while the nitrogen abundance (percent N by weight) ranges from 14.3 percent
to 15.9 percent. Carbon abundance above 6.9 percent and nitrogen above 2.4 percent
are considered acceptable (see Ambrose and Norr 1992). The C/N ratio of collagen (C/N
1.166667) has been estimated from its amino acid composition to be 3.21 (Ambrose 1990,
1993). Samples with an atomic C/N ratio lower than 2.9 or higher than 3.6 exceed the
accepted threshold suggested by analysis of modern and archaeological samples (DeNiro
1985; DeNiro and Schoeninger 1983; Schoeninger and DeNiro 1984). Table 8-3 shows
that all samples have acceptable C/N ratios, ranging from 3.22 to 3.30 (mean = 3.27,
1 σ = 0.04). The mean C/N ratio is 3.26, 1 σ = 0.06 and 3.28, 1 σ = 0.03 for 41HY161 and
41HY163 respectively.
Procedural and Laboratory Comparisons
Two types of replicates were processed during the analysis (Table 8-4). The first
involved a single collagen extraction process with two samples of the resultant collagen
analyzed in the mass spectrometer, identified by ID numbers that differ only in decimals
(568.1/568.2 and 569.1/569.2). Two paired replicates were run with an average δ13C
and δ15N difference between replicates of 0.13 percent and 0.07 percent, respectively.
We also processed replicate samples of each individual burial where a single bone
sample was split into two parts and each part was processed for collagen extraction
and analyzed in the IRMS separately to assess the accuracy of the analytical procedure
(Table 8-4). The resulting collagen δ13C and δ15N values produced an average difference
of 0.04 percent and 0.16 percent, respectively. These results demonstrate that the bone
collagen extraction technique produces comparable and isotopically homogeneous values
with a high degree of accuracy and precision for both carbon and nitrogen isotopes.
Along with the human bone, we processed one sample of bone from a modern bison
from Colorado with a known isotopic signature as an additional procedural comparison.
The δ13C and δ15N values (-19.41 percent and 6.45 percent) fall within the mean δ13C
and δ15N values from previous runs on ten separate collagen extraction procedures
(-19.38 percent, 1 σ = 0.21 percent and 6.53 percent, 1 σ = 0.37 percent) demonstrating
procedural accuracy.
Results
The results of the isotopic analysis of bone collagen from the five Hays County burials
(see Table 8-4) range from -17.92 percent to -10.35 percent (δ13C) and from 8.80 percent
to 13.29 percent (δ15N). The three burials from 41HY163 cluster together with a mean
of ‑17.81 percent, 1 σ = 0.13 percent (δ13C) and 9.09 percent, 1 σ = 0.27 percent (δ15N).
The two burials from 41HY161, however, show a definite difference, with Burial 1 δ13C
and δ15N values of ‑10.35 percent and 13.29 percent, respectively, and Burial 2 values
of ‑16.87 percent and 8.80 percent, respectively. Burial 1 at 41HY161, the Toyah-era
female, is considerably later in time (515 B.P.) and Burial 2 (41HY161) is much earlier
(3510 B.P.) than the three 41HY163 burials (1215–1305 B.P.). Figure 8-1 presents the

348

isotopic composition of different categories of food resources (adapted from Eickmeier
and Bender 1976; Hard and Katzenberg in press; Huebner 1991; Quigg and Cordova
2000; Sternberg et al. 1984; Troughton et al. 1974; Tykot 2004). Figure 8-2 plots the
isotopic values from Table 8-3 along with mean isotope results from human samples
collected from several archaeological sites, primarily along the Texas coastal plains (see
Hard and Katzenberg, in press). The values from the three burials from 41HY163 and
Burial 2 from 41HY161 are similar to the values reported from the inland sites. Burial
1 (41HY163), which has slightly elevated nitrogen values when compared to Burials
2 and 3 (41HY163), falls on the lower margin of the values from one of the riverine
sites. Comparing Figures 8-1 and 8-2 suggests that the dietary values of the three
burials from 41HY163 and of Burial 2 from 41HY161 reflect a subsistence strategy that
would have largely focused on terrestrial plants and animals with possibly a minor
contribution from riverine resources.

Burial 1 from 41HY161 is interesting in that its nitrogen and carbon values are
considerably elevated when compared to mean stable isotope values for Hard and
Katzenberg's inland or riverine sites (Figure 8-2). Burial 1 has a similar carbon value
as one of the coastal sites (41NU2, Oso Bay near Corpus Christi), but its nitrogen
value is greater than the mean nitrogen values of the coastal sites and only within
the maximum range of some coastal individuals. The stable carbon value of Burial 1
(-10.35 percent) suggests a protein source with an elevated 13C value. Given the Late

349

Figure 8-1. Carbon vs. nitrogen isotope ratios in common New World food groups.

Prehistoric date of this burial (Table 8-3), a dependence on bison, which primarily feeds
on C4 grasses in this region, is consistent with the carbon value. However, the δ15N value
for this burial (13.29 percent) is significantly elevated over what is expected with a focus
on bison. A diet heavily dependent on CAM plants such as prickly pear could potentially
produce such an elevated 15N, especially given the 2 to 3 percent enhancement of
human collagen values over plant values. However, the virtual absence of protein in
prickly pear (Hard and Katzenberg in press) renders such a diet incompatible with the
13
C collagen value of Burial 1 and therefore unlikely. However a diet based in marine
resources, particularly piscavorus fish, would yield a diet with an elevated δ15N, as well
as a protein source with an elevated δ13C. Based on these factors, we believe that Burial
1 from 41HY161 may reflect the inland migration of a coastal resident.
The analysis presented here only considered the δ13C from bone collagen. A future
analysis of δ13C from apatite carbonate would provide useful data on the composition of
the protein and carbohydrate portions of the diets of these individuals, and may help
clarify the diet of Burial 1 from 41HY161. In addition, analysis of more Late Prehistoric

burials, especially from inland settings, will be necessary to clarify whether Burial 1 at
41HY161 represents an anomaly. Finally, the three remains from Zatopec all cluster
tightly and compare favorably with other samples from inland terrestrial sites. They are
also close to and just within the range of 15N variation recorded at some riverine sites
along the Texas Coastal Plain. Such a setting describes the general San Marcos area,
including the San Marcos and Blanco River Valleys that extend into the Coastal Plain.

Analysis

This chapter reports the results of the analysis of zooarchaeological remains from the
Zatopec site. The assemblage consists of 2,534 bone, antler, and shell fragments with
a total weight of 2,314.68 g, recovered using 1/4-in mesh hardware screens. Although
preservation of bone at the site was generally poor, the assemblage nevertheless allows
for the investigation of research questions based upon broad comparisons between
larger animals such as bison, deer and antelope, and small-bodied animals. The analysis
addressed several questions related to the central research themes of the project
discussed previously in Chapter 1. Attention was particularly directed toward the
identification of animal taxa present at the site during different periods of occupation.
In addition, analyses considered evidence of differential access to a high-fat, highprotein diet as a means of examining consumption behaviors between hunters and
their larger social groups. Finally, we evaluated temporal patterns exhibited in prey
size selection as an indication of the relative importance of male-dominated big-game
hunting versus a more evenly balanced contribution of food resources by all members of
prehistoric society. These analyses include comparisons with regional assemblages from
other sites in Central Texas.
Materials and Methods
Vertebrate remains recovered from precontact occupations were identified by Jessica
L. Vavrasek using modern comparative collections. Initial sorting and classification of
faunal remains was done to the most specific taxonomic level possible. The taxonomic
nomenclature used for vertebrates follows the Peterson Field Guides (e.g. Burt and
Grossenheider 1980; Conant and Collins 1991; Page and Burr 1991; Peterson 1980).

352

Other information recorded includes element, side, portion, fusion, and whether any
modification was noted on the bone.
When identification was limited to class, a size category was assigned when feasible.
Analytical protocol for mammals is as follows. Large mammals are those represented by
wild taxa such as bison (Bison bison), deer (Odocoileus sp.), and pronghorn (Antilocapra
americana). Representative of large/medium-sized category are animals referred to as
canids (Canis spp.), primarily the coyote, wolf, and dog. The medium-sized mammal
category includes wild taxa such as foxes [gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) and red
fox (Vulpes fulva)] and raccoon (Procyon lotor). Medium/small mammals include wild
taxa such as cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), opossum (Didelphis virginiana),
woodchuck (Marmota monax), and skunk (Mephitis mephitis). Examples of small-sized
mammals include squirrels (Sciurus sp.), muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), and Old World
rats (Rattus sp.). Very small-sized mammals are represented by taxa such as mice,
voles, and bats. Similar size classes are used when discussing bones attributable only to
class Aves, the birds. Large-sized birds are represented by turkey (Meleagris gallopavo),
large raptors (hawks and eagles), and large geese. Medium-sized birds include ducks
and owls. Small-sized birds are represented by jays, warblers, and buntings, primarily
the passerines or song-birds.
Minimum Numbers of Individuals (MNI) and Number of Identified Specimens
(NISP) were calculated as a basic method of quantifying the assemblage. Both MNI and
NISP have shortcomings (Breitburg 1991; Grayson 1979, 1984; Klein and Cruz-Uribe
1984; Ringrose 1993). MNI is calculated by looking at paired skeletal elements. First
introduced by White (1953), it is done by separating the most abundant elements into
their left and right sides and using the largest number as the unit of calculation. The
measure can be further refined by assessing age and size variables (Grayson 1979). With
MNI, the greatest problem deals with aggregation. The criteria used to aggregate a site
affect the calculation of MNI. The more divisive the contexts, such as strata, levels, time
periods, or features, the closer the MNI values will approach NISP values (Grayson 1979,
1984; Reitz and Scarry 1985). However, if the contexts are not mixed and the aggregation
units cannot be further divided, the MNI values may be more representative of actual
individuals brought to the site (Grayson 1984:67). Other problems with MNI include
the assumption that the entire animal was consumed at the site, with the animal being
represented by the identified element. This may or may not be the case, as indicated by
butchery, exchange behaviors, or market evidence. By examining element distribution
from the assemblage, the evidence can be evaluated. Another problem concerns the
importance of smaller species in the diet. Although smaller species (e.g.,fish) may be
present at a site, their relative importance in the diet compared to a single identified
deer-size animal is considerably less (Reitz and Scarry 1985).
NISP is obtained by an actual count of bone or tooth fragments assigned to a

353

particular taxon. Criticisms exist for this measurement of taxonomic abundance in a
faunal assemblage as well. First, the measure is affected by butchery and subsequent
patterns thereof, and the subjective nature of species identification. Collection and
taphonomic agents also affect the validity of the measurement. The greatest criticism
deals with element interdependence (Grayson 1979, 1984). Put simply, how can it be
known which elements and fragments come from different animals in the assemblage?
Despite these shortcomings, MNI and NISP values were calculated for the Zatopec
faunal materials. However, only NISP measures are used here when considering
taxonomic abundance. Although it is acknowledged that there is the problem of element
interdependence, it is assumed to be less of a problem than site aggregation.
The distribution of skeletal elements identified in an assemblage can be divided
into categories indicating preferred portions of the carcass, consumption patterns, and
butchering practices. Assuming that the distribution of these elements is not skewed
by taphonomic factors or recovery strategies, the identification of which elements are
present in the assemblage can provide insight into patterns of how meat, as a valuable
food resource, was shared within the social group. Preferred portions are discussed
in terms of elemental groupings and whether the unit is considered of high or low
utility. Portions of the carcass that are considered high utility are richer in terms of
meat, marrow, and grease, and typically have a higher nutritional and perhaps social
value. High utility elements include the femur, tibia, sternum, ribs, and vertebrae.
Lower utility skeletal elements include carpals, tarsals, skulls, and metapodials (see
Binford 1978; Metcalf and Jones 1988). The skull category includes all material from
bones associated with the cranium and mandible, including teeth and antler. The axial
category includes all vertebrae (atlas, axis, cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and caudal),
ribs, and pelvis. Front leg includes the scapula, humerus, ulna, radius, carpals, and
metacarpal. Hind leg includes femur, patella, and tibia, astragalus, and metatarsal.
The final category is the feet, which includes phalanges and sesamoid bones. In terms
of patterns of consumption and sharing, in social contexts of approximately equal access
to nutritionally valuable portions, higher utility portions of the carcass presumably are
brought back to camp from a kill site for further processing and eventual consumption.
Alternatively, high utility elements might be less well represented at residential
campsites in situations where hunters consume choice portions preferentially in relation
to the rest of the band (e.g., Speth 1990).
When discussing the distribution of skeletal elements, several other values are
calculated from raw numbers. The Minimum Number of Skeletal Elements (MNE),
similar to the MNI, refers to a single element rather than an entire individual. Therefore,
if two distal ends of a femur were recovered, the MNE would be two. A proximal and
a distal portion of a left femur would produce an MNE of one — a single femur is
represented by the two identified specimens. The Minimum Number of Animal Units

354

(MAU), derived from the MNE, is calculated as the minimum number of a particular
skeletal element divided by the number of that element in an animal. For example, a
sample with an MNE of five femurs would have an MAU of 2.5 — the five is divided by the
two femurs present in each animal. For phalanges, the denominator is 24, as each foot of a
bison, deer, or antelope includes six phalanges. Therefore an assemblage of 12 phalanges
would have an MAU of 0.5. Finally, the MAU percentage is the MAU for a particular
element divided by the highest MAU in a particular assemblage. For this example, the
highest MAU is 2.5 for femurs. So femurs have an MAU percentage of 100, and the
phalanges have an MAU percentage of 20 (0.5 divided by 2.5 multiplied by 100).
Other characteristics of the bones were also noted. Taphonomic alteration of the
bone in the form of burning (see Bennett 1999; McCutcheon 1992), butchery marks
(Lyman 1994; Reitz and Wing 1999), and carnivore or rodent gnawing (Morey and
Klippel 1991; Thornton and Fee 2001) were also recorded.
Descriptive Results
A total of 2,534 complete or fragmented bones, teeth, antler, and shell fragments were
analyzed from the 1/4-in faunal sample (Table 9-1). At least 21 species are reflected in
the faunal sample, representing three vertebrate classes. These classes include Reptilia
(reptiles), Aves (birds), and Mammalia (mammals). No amphibian bones were identified.
Freshwater mussel shells (n = 286) were also identified in the faunal sample.
The 21 distinct taxa include turtles (Testudines), nonpoisonous snake (Colubridae),
indeterminate snake, indeterminate bird, black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus),
rabbit (Sylvilagus sp.), rabbits and hares (Leporidae), squirrels (Sciurus sp.), hispid
cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), eastern woodrat (Neotoma floridana), muskrat
(Ondatra zibethica), rodents (Rodentia), raccoon (Procyon lotor), opossum (Didelphis
virginianus), dog, wolf, or coyote (Canis sp.), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), red fox
(Vulpes vulva), deer (Odocoileus sp.), pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), bison (Bison
bison), and pig (Sus scrofa).
Overall, the faunal sample identifiable to at least class (excluding shell) is composed
primarily of highly fragmented, indeterminate mammal remains (67.9 percent). Of the
2,246 non-shell faunal elements analyzed, less than one percent (n = 15) were complete.
Reptiles
Reptiles are represented by turtles (n = 17) and snakes (n = 5). All turtle remains
were identified as carapace fragments. One snake family was identified, Colubridae
(n = 4), which are nonpoisonous snakes. All Colubrid remains were vertebrae. The
indeterminate snake was also a vertebra. None of the snake remains exhibited any
taphonomic alterations such as burning. Because of the small size of most reptile bones,
reptile remains are generally underrepresented in 1/4-in screen samples. The poor state
of bone preservation at the site, however, was also a factor in their low recovery.

Birds
Birds were also uncommon in the Zatopec faunal assemblage. Nine indeterminate
bird bones, mostly long bone segments, were identified. These remains did not exhibit
any burning. As with reptiles, the low recovery of bird remains may be related to
the fact that only 1/4-in screening was used for recovery, as well as to poor bone
preservation.
Mammals
Mammals are much more common at the site and represent approximately 99
percent (n = 2,215) of the faunal sample identifiable to class. Mammalian taxa include
canids, red and gray fox, raccoon, rabbits, jackrabbit, muskrat, opossum, squirrel, cotton
rat, woodrat, pronghorn, deer, and bison. A large portion of the mammalian sample
consists of indeterminate mammal bone (67.90 percent) and bones assigned to largesized (7.21 percent) and large/medium-sized (11.40 percent) mammals, probably deer/
pronghorn and bison-sized animals.
Bone Modifications
Bone modifications were noted on 232 bones from Zatopec (Table 9-2). Taxa having
modifications include bison, deer, rabbit, gray and red fox, turtle, indeterminate
mammal, large-sized mammal, large/medium-sized mammal, and medium-sized
mammal. The most common modification noted was burning. Burning was identified
(n = 218) most frequently on indeterminate mammal, large/medium-sized mammal,
medium-sized mammal, and deer fragments. Of these, 213 bones were charred and five
bones were calcined. Evidence of carnivore and rodent gnawing was noted, indicating
that at least some of the bones in the assemblage were not immediately buried and were
exposed on the surface for a period of time. In addition, one deer metatarsal shaft and a
large mammal long bone shaft exhibited cut marks.

Taxa Utilization through Time
Possible changes through time in faunal use at the Zatopec site were examined by
assigning the various contexts to analytical units (see Chapter 3). AU 1 is assigned to
the Late Prehistoric period, dating from approximately A.D. 700 to A.D. 1650. In some
instances, finer temporal designations can be assigned, with AU 1b representing Late
Prehistoric Austin phase deposits, dating ca. A.D. 700–1200, and AU 1a representing
Late Prehistoric Toyah phase deposits, ca. A.D. 1200–1650. AU 2 is classified as general
Late Archaic, dating from ca. 2,000 B.C. to A.D. 700. Within this, two additional
analytical units have been defined: AU 2b is Late Archaic II, (ca. 250 B.C. to A.D. 700)
and AU 2a, Late Archaic I (ca. 2000–250 B.C.). AUs 1 and 2 represent aggregated
Late Prehistoric and Late Archaic time spans, respectively. The aggregated nature of
these analytical units effectively masks most of the temporally specific trends that we
sought to examine. Accordingly, although data are presented for these analytical units,
discussions of temporal trends are based on AUs 1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b. (AU 3 representing
the Middle Archaic, ca. 3850–2000 B.C., is discussed below, although it only contains a
single element and is not considered representative of faunal exploitation at the site.)
The data are presented as percentage of each taxon (NISP) within each analytical
unit (Figure 9-1). During the Late Archaic period, it is apparent that Zatopec hunters
primarily focused on deer/pronghorn. Bison were utilized to a much lesser degree, as
were smaller mammals. Deer/pronghorn utilization falls off during the Austin phase
(AU 1b) and increases somewhat into the Toyah phase (AU 1a). This decrease in deer/

358

pronghorn use in the Late Prehistoric coincides with the sharp increase in bison use.
This increase in bison is even more evident when the three game categories are
compared relative to each other (Figure 9-2). Here, unidentifiable specimens from each
analytical unit are excluded, so that the three prey categories add up to 100 percent.
Use of bison relative to deer/antelope and smaller mammals clearly increases. In
addition, when the more general time period assemblages (AU 1 and AU 2) are excluded
(Figure 9-3), a notable decrease in use of smaller mammals is also apparent by the
Austin and, especially, Toyah occupations. This shift cannot be explained by taphonomy,
as these smaller and presumably more fragile specimens are less likely to be preserved
in older rather than younger deposits. It appears, then, that Late Prehistoric,
particularly Toyah, occupants of the site focused the majority of their efforts on hunting
and processing both large (bison) and small game in ways that differed markedly from
their predecessors.

Element Distribution
As discussed previously, element distribution for a taxon provides an indication of
preferred portions of the carcass, consumption patterns, and butchering practices. By
examining which portions are present in terms of elemental groupings, one can infer,
to some degree, whether the unit is considered of high or low utility, based on product
desirability (meat, marrow, and grease). Changes in element distributions through time
may be linked to patterns in meat sharing within a residential group. Whether or not
portions of the carcass that are considered high utility, including femur, tibia, sternum,
ribs, and vertebrae (see Binford 1978; Metcalf and Jones 1988) were transported from a
kill site to an encampment for sharing may indicate the degree to which (predominantly
male) hunters enjoyed preferential access to those portions in relation to the rest of their
social groups. Alternatively, the frequency of high to low utility elements, including
antler, carpals, tarsals, skulls, and metapodials, may show how widely accessible all
portions were for group consumption.
In order to examine patterns in the use of larger game by occupants of Zatopec,
element distribution for bison and deer/pronghorn was delineated first to evaluate
whether high or low utility elements predominate the assemblage and second to see
if these values changed though time. Element abundance for deer and pronghorn are
presented in Figure 9-4, and Tables 9-3 and 9-4. Elements from high utility portions
of the carcass (femur, tibia, sternum, ribs, and vertebrae) number eight elements.
Lower utility elements are dominated by portions of the skull, mainly tooth fragments,
and metacarpal, metatarsal, and metapodial fragments, which were most frequently
identified. In the case of deer and pronghorn, the entire animal appears to have been
transported from the kill site, and no significant differences are immediately apparent
between the Late Archaic (AU 2, AU 2a, and AU 2b) and Late Prehistoric (AU 1, AU
1a, AU 1b) samples. Although dominated by lower utility portions, all portions of the
carcass are present in the Zatopec assemblage during both occupations.

Element distribution for bison is presented in Figure 9-5, and Tables 9-5 and 9-6.
Most of the bison elements are indeterminate tooth fragments (n = 72 of 90, 80 percent).
Fourteen fragments were identified only as long bones, which may represent the low
utility phalanx, metacarpal, or metatarsal (front and back lower legs and feet); medium
utility radius or ulna; or high utility humerus, femur, or tibia. These 14 elements are
therefore not ranked with respect to utility. The recovery of large numbers of bison teeth
bears mention. Tooth fragments are not usually present at a campsite unless hunters
had brought back the entire skull of their prey. Although the head of an animal contains
very little meat, the brain and tongue are rich in nutrients. Speth (1990:165–166) notes
that hunters often consume these portions, along with other nutritionally valuable
portions like the kidney, organ fat, and long bone marrow, at kill sites. It is not known,
however, whether prehistoric hunters in Central Texas opened skulls to consume their
soft tissue contents at kill sites, or whether the presence of teeth indicates that entire
skulls were returned to camp.

Using relative frequencies of high, medium and low utility elements to understand
meat-sharing behavior at Zatopec is problematic for several reasons. First, as has been
noted, preservation is poor across the entire assemblage, making it likely that many
high utility elements have weathered to the point that they cannot be recognized. In
addition, it is probable that many high utility parts that were returned to the camp
were further processed to extract marrow and grease, leaving them unidentifiable as
to taxon or element portion. Finally, comparing deer and antelope to bison is difficult
because most recovered bison elements in analytical units are teeth fragments.
Although 80 percent of the identified bison elements in all analytical units are teeth,
only 21.8 percent (26 of 119) of the identified deer and antelope specimens are teeth.
These differences could reflect differential preservation, different processing behaviors
for deer/antelope and bison, or different consumption and sharing patterns for these two
prey classes.
In spite of these problems, the relative frequencies of high, medium, and low utility
elements for deer and antelope (and for bison) can be assessed by calculating a utility
index for each time period. The utility index is calculated by assigning values of 1, 2,
and 3 to low, medium, and high utility elements, respectively, and then dividing the
sum of the values of the elements recovered by the total value possible if all identified
elements were of high utility. The higher the index, the more frequently high utility
elements appear in each analytical unit (Figure 9-6). The utility index for bison is badly
skewed by the recovery of teeth fragments, and is probably not an accurate reflection
of patterns of resource sharing and consumption at the site. Although some of the
same problems might to a lesser degree apply to deer and antelope, the utility index

Figure 9-6. Utility indices for deer and antelope and bison over time at Zatopec. Bison
values may not truly represent patterns of meat sharing at the site.

368

for those animals suggests that meat-sharing became markedly less equitable during
periods when reliance on bison was heaviest. As the focus of the site inhabitants shifted
gradually toward bison from AU 2b to AU 1a, the utility index for deer and antelope
declines steadily (with some fluctuation during in the Austin period), reaching its lowest
during Toyah times.
For comparison, we draw on the extensive faunal assemblage from the WilsonLeonard site, located on the plateau to the northeast of the Zatopec site and dating from
the Paleoindian through Late Prehistoric period (Baker 1998). Materials recovered from
both the 1/4-in and 1/8-in samples include bison, deer, and antelope. Over 20 additional
taxa were identified, including a variety of fish, turtles, birds, rabbits, and medium to
small mammals.
The Wilson-Leonard assemblage, with its greater time depth, produced a utility
index graph that, despite its greater time depth, shares some similarities with Zatopec
(Figure 9-7, Tables 9-7 and 9-8). Although the deer/antelope assemblage from the
Paleoindian and Early Paleoindian periods is notably small, the utility index for deer/
antelope appears to increase as the index for bison decreases. Only one bison specimen
can be assigned to the Middle/Late Archaic period, rendering the apparent increase in
the bison utility index in the Late Archaic period questionable. However, it is of interest
that the value for deer/antelope is at its highest in the Late Prehistoric period, when
bison apparently was not processed or consumed at the site. As at Zatopec, sharing of
deer and antelope at Wilson-Leonard seems to be less equitable when bison were also
being exploiting.
We believe these analyses offer promising approaches to the development of patterns
of meat consumption (at least for deer and antelope), although we recommend that the
Zatopec results be viewed cautiously until larger comparative studies can be conducted
to ascertain whether similar patterns can be documented at other regional sites.
Assemblage Diversity and Regional Comparisons
In order to place the Zatopec faunal assemblage in a larger context of animal use
through time and space, the assemblage was compared to others from the greater
Central Texas region (Figure 9-8). Including Zatopec, a total of 15 sites with 30
temporally defined assemblages were used for comparison (Table 9-9). When possible,
different time periods for individual sites were listed separately. For Zatopec, the
general Late Archaic (AU 2) and Late Prehistoric (AU 1) assemblages are used, as well
as the site’s scant Middle Archaic (AU 3) component. Following methods utilized by
Dering (2008), as well as Baker (1998) and Masson and Holderby (1994), all animal
taxa data were combined into a table (see Appendix J). In most instances, all bird,
reptile, and fish remains were combined into general categories. For mammals, bones
not identifiable to order, genus, or family level were separated into comparable size
categories. In all assemblages, NISP was the method used for quantification.

369

Figure 9-7. Utility indices for deer and antelope and bison over time at the WilsonLeonard site.

The Rush Site (41TG346) is an example of a Late Prehistoric period bison
butchering and grease-rendering site located near San Angelo, Texas (Quigg 1995).
More than 98 percent of the assemblage (n = 11,000+) was identified as bison, with
extensive evidence of marrow extraction. Other identified mammals included deer,
antelope, small mammal, reptile, fish, and bird. Site 41BR246, located at Camp Bowie,
is a burned rock midden where six deer or deer-sized bones were recovered (Mauldin
et al. 2003:70). Similarly, site 41BR250 is a burned rock midden also at Camp Bowie.
Faunal remains recovered included 43 specimens, representing bison-sized mammals to
rodents (Mauldin et al. 2003; Meissner 2003). Site 41BR253 consists of two burned rock
middens with a small faunal assemblage consisting of two deer-sized, two rabbit, and
three indeterminate bones. All the Camp Bowie sites date to the Late Prehistoric Toyah
phase.

The Kyle Site (41HI1) is a rock-shelter dating to both the Austin and Toyah phases
of the Late Prehistoric. The site’s extensive faunal assemblage contains bison, deer/
antelope, raccoon, skunk, badger, and rats and mice (Jelks 1962). Mustang Branch
(41HY209) is a multi-component site with Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric levels,
including Austin and Toyah deposits (Ricklis and Collins 1994). Identified faunal
remains included bison, deer, antelope, rodents, birds, and turtles (Masson and
Holderby 1994). The site is interpreted as a large-game processing area that was
intensively utilized, with deer bone exhibiting cut marks, extensive marrow processing
and grease extraction. The bison remains were butchered but not further processed
for grease. The presence of small and medium game at this short-term occupation
site suggests the larger game processed here was for later consumption (Masson and
Holderby 1994). Small faunal assemblages from the nearby Barton site were associated
with relatively brief Late Archaic (41HY202-B) and Toyah (41HY202-A’) occupations
(Masson and Holderby 1994).
The Toyah Bluff site (41TV441) contained a broad faunal assemblage that included
bison, deer, medium-sized mammal, reptile, and mussel. It was a seasonally occupied
residential area (Karbula et al. 2001). The Biesenbach site (41WN88) contained a
taxonomically rich assemblage ranging from bison to small game. It is interpreted as a
long-term residential occupation from the Late Prehistoric period (Nickels 2000). The
Honey Creek site (41MS32) is a large burned rock midden from the Late Prehistoric
period. Bison, deer, pronghorn, small-, medium-, and large-sized mammals, birds, and
reptiles were identified (Decker 1997). A Toyah component was identified at the Varga
site (41ED28) and included bison, deer, rabbit, canid, fish, and bird remains (Quigg et
al. 2005).
As noted above, the Wilson-Leonard site (41WM235) contained a sizeable faunal
assemblage dating from the Paleoindian through Late Prehistoric period (Baker 1998).
A total of 21,867 bones were recovered from the 1/4-in sample, with 21 taxa identified,
including small fish, musk turtle, box turtle, softshell turtle, nonpoisonous snakes,
indeterminate large bird, quail, jackrabbit, cottontail rabbits, tree squirrels, pocket
gopher, cotton rat, wood rat, raccoon, skunks, canids, bobcat, deer, pronghorn, bison,
and horse. Twenty-five taxa were identified in the 1/8‑in faunal sample (n = 38,618),
with most (68 percent) unidentifiable to class. The data used here include only the 1/4-in
faunal sample recovered from contexts assignable to time periods (Baker 1998:Table
A-10) for ease of comparison with other sites.

376

The Richard Beene site (41BX831), located on the South Texas Plains just south
of the Balcones Escarpment, also yielded a significant faunal sample, ranging from
Paleoindian through the Late Prehistoric periods (Baker and Steele 1992). More than
10,000 bone fragments were recovered using 1/4-in and 1/8-in mesh. Of these, only 1,439
were identifiable to class and represented at least 19 species. Since Baker and Steele
(1992) made no distinction between 1/4-in and 1/8-in materials, both size grades are
included here. The site appears to have been used as a campsite or base camp through
time. An abundance of fire-cracked rock associated with Early Archaic features suggests
that the occupants regularly processed roots and other plant foods at the site (Thoms 1992).
In order to explore possible changes through time in animal use, specifically hunting
practices, the percentage of bison, deer/antelope, and medium/small animals in each
assemblage (or subsite assemblage) was compared. Deer/antelope were separated
from medium-bodied game, which was lumped with other small-bodied animals in
this comparison in order to better illustrate some of the important changes that were
indicated in Zatopec’s components and to make those remains more comparable
with how other assemblages had been described. In this comparison, only specimens
identifiable at least to class were included. Bison include those specimens identified to
species, as well as Bovidae (bison or cow), and extra-large mammal. Similarly, deer/
antelope include those identified to species, as deer/antelope, or as large mammal.
Most of the remaining specimens were grouped as medium/small prey. Some of these,
particularly the smaller animals, are generally few in number and are presumed not
to have a significant effect on overall patterns. Those categories not included in this
comparison are deer/sheep/goat (Cervidae), even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyla), large/
medium mammals, and indeterminate mammals, as they could not confidently be
placed in a general size/prey category.
The results of this comparison suggest that use of all three categories shifted
through time (Figure 9-9, Table 9-10). Although the Paleoindian and Early/Middle
Archaic sample is limited to Wilson-Leonard, which may not reflect hunting practices
across the region, it suggests that bison were not available to hunters in the region after
the Paleoindian period. They do not reappear until the Middle/Late Archaic period, and
generally in low percentages. Even into the Late Prehistoric period, bison dominates
only some assemblages. These include the Late Archaic component at the Barton site
(14), and the Late Prehistoric components at the Varga site (11), Rush site (2), and
Barton site (13). As noted, the Rush site is interpreted as a bison-butchering camp; the
others may represent occupations associated with the butchering of bison as well.
Deer/antelope is generally well represented in most assemblages, but the patterning
in smaller animals is more interesting. Smaller animals made up the larger portion
of the Paleoindian and a significant portion of the Early through Middle Archaic
assemblages at Wilson-Leonard, as well as in the Late Prehistoric assemblages of

377

faunal assemblages through time.

378

several other sites, including two Camp Bowie sites, 41BR250 (4) and 41BR253 (5), and
the Honey Creek site (7), all three of which are rock midden sites.
The same comparisons can be made between the three prey categories, highlighting
the relative importance of each. In other words, here the specimens that could not be
included in one of the three categories are excluded, so that the three prey categories
add up to 100 percent. These results suggest that medium/smaller prey dominate
Paleoindian and Early/Middle Archaic assemblages, Late Archaic samples are
characterized by high percentages of deer/antelope, and Late Prehistoric assemblages
are variously dominated by each of the three prey categories (Figure 9-10; see Table
9-10). As noted above, bison represent the greater portion of the prey at the Rush,
Varga, and Barton sites (2, 11, and 13), as well as the Toyah Bluff site (8), interpreted
as a residential area. Deer/antelope as well as bison are present in the Late Prehistoric
assemblages from Zatopec (1E, 1F, and 1G), as well as 41BR246 (3), the Kyle site (6), and
Mustang Branch (9). Medium/small prey are predominant at the three rock midden sites
noted above, as well as the Biesenbach site (10), which appears to be a residential site.
The diversity of the various assemblages can also be compared. This was done using
the statistical program DIVERS, which calculates richness and evenness dimensions
of diversity for a given dataset. Richness refers simply to the number of taxa in an
assemblage. Therefore a site that includes 16 species of animals would have a richness
of 16, whereas a site with four taxa would have a richness of 4. Evenness is defined as
H/Hmax, where H is defined as the sum of pi*log10(pi), where i is each taxon present in
a particular assemblage. Hmax is simply log10k, where k is the number of taxa included
in the analysis. Evenness describes how evenly the various taxa are represented. For
example, two sites may both have a richness of 10. At Site A, the ten species may each
represent 10 percent of the assemblage, although at Site B two species may represent
80 percent of the assemblage and the other eight the remaining 20 percent. Site A would
have a more even assemblage, with an evenness value closer to 1.
DIVERS uses a Monte-Carlo simulation to derive expected diversity for a model
distribution over a range of sample sizes. The program uses a random number
generator to determine the likelihood that an assemblage of a certain size would be
more or less diverse than another assemblage simply by chance. This method allows
for the comparison of assemblages of different sizes, which is particularly important
because richness generally increases with sample size (Kintigh 1984, 1989). The more
specimens analyzed, the more likely that rarer species will be identified. Here, a 90
percent confidence interval is used. This means that less than 10 percent of the randomly
generated assemblages produced a richness or evenness value greater or less than the
values in between the confidence interval. A site that falls above the interval is more
diverse than expected for its size, and one which falls below is less diverse than expected.

faunal assemblages through time.

The results of the diversity analysis, plotted using the software program DIVPLT,
show that the Paleoindian and Archaic components at the Wilson-Leonard site set
the diversity curve (Figure 9-11, Table 9-11). Most other sites are less diverse. In
comparison, the assemblages from the analytical units at the Zatopec site fall well
below the 90 percent confidence interval. It is possible that preservation of bone is much
better at the Wilson-Leonard site than other sites. However, even at Wilson-Leonard,
the Late Prehistoric assemblages are the least diverse, falling well below the 90 percent
confidence interval. Also, the assemblages from the rock midden sites, including the
three Camp Bowie sites (3, 4, and 5) and the Honey Creek site (7), are the most diverse
of the remaining sites, falling either within or closest to the confidence interval. Of
interest, the Zatopec assemblages generally fall in line with other sites interpreted as
residential sites, such as the Toyah Bluff (8) and Biesenbach (10) sites.
Several interpretations can be drawn from these results. First, the Paleoindian
and earlier Archaic assemblages at Wilson-Leonard indicate that early hunters relied
on a wide variety of prey, especially smaller animals. This suggests that a range of

hunting, butchering, and processing activities occurred here. To the extent that men
hunted the majority of larger game, like bison, deer, and antelope and women, children,
and the elderly procured smaller prey (see Bird 1999; Hawkes 1993, 1996; Hollenbach
2009; Kelly 1995; and Panter-Brick 2002 for more detailed discussion), the activities
of women, children, and the elderly are especially well represented at Wilson-Leonard.
The absence of bison after the Late Paleoindian and prior to the Middle/Late Archaic
period may well be a reflection of their limited availability in the region, as suggested
by Dillehay (1974), or it may be a result of the small sample of Early Archaic sites used
in this study. By the Late Archaic period, bison appear to have been abundant in the
region, or at least were preferentially targeted by big-game hunters at certain sites.
Second, deer/antelope become predominant in the Late Archaic assemblages, with
bison becoming common as well. Hunting of larger game appears to have become a more
profitable and reliable pursuit at this time, which surely had significant implications for
labor divisions based on sex. As small-bodied game became less important in local diets,
women may have shifted a portion of their activities from procurement to supportive
tasks, such as butchering and hide processing, tasks directly related to exploitation of
larger game (see Waguespack 2005).

Third, there is a continued increase in reliance on bison in the Late Prehistoric
period, particularly the Toyah phase. Faunal assemblages at several sites are heavily
dominated by bison remains during this interval. At Zatopec, for example, recovery of
bison remains clearly increased through time, coinciding with a decrease in use of deer
and antelope and, in later times, small game as well. This scenario reflects not only a
continuation of the increasing preference by some hunters for bison, but also a change

385

in patterns of labor allocation in order to provide processing support for bison hunting.
Fourth, this increase in bison is not seen evenly at all sites. In fact, Late Prehistoric
assemblages appear to display a remarkable variety of prey-choice strategies. At least
one site (Rush) represents a bison-processing camp, and several others contain dense
middens of burned and fire-cracked rock, the result of prolonged and repeated roasting
of geophytes such as wild onion (Allium sp.) and camas (Camassia sp.) (Dering 2008).
The bison-processing camp had the least diverse assemblage, whereas the burned rock
middens were the most diverse among the Late Prehistoric sites. In addition, faunal
assemblages at midden sites were characterized by medium and small animals. Viewed
in concert with the geophyte roasting, the activities of women, children, and the elderly
are clearly represented at these sites. To be sure, activities relating to large-game
hunting are also represented, but the data reveal that, during the Late Prehistoric and
especially the Toyah phase, site types begin to reveal patterned labor divisions reflecting
preferential exploitation of one or two subsistence resources over others, and that the
distinction appears to represent a choice between hunting large game versus hunting
and trapping smaller animals and roasting floral resources. To the extent that limited
activities and particular task groups can be seen at several of the Late Prehistoric sites,
some peoples in the region appear to have shifted to a more logistical pattern of site use
(see Binford 1979, 1980).
Conclusions
Zooarchaeological remains from Zatopec represent primarily Late Archaic and Late
Prehistoric occupations and behaviors. Site occupants utilized at least 21 taxa, ranging
from larger animals such as bison, deer, and pronghorn to small mammals and turtle.
When the zooarchaeological remains present at the site are examined through time
by species, the Late Archaic hunters appear to have focused on deer/pronghorn and
to a lesser extent on bison and smaller mammals. In the Late Prehistoric, subsistence
practices shifted and bison became the primary focus, supplemented by deer/pronghorn
and, to a lesser degree, small mammals.
Relatively low utility elements (primarily teeth) were identified for bison, which may
indicate that higher utility portions were further reduced through processing to extract
marrow and grease. Alternatively, the relative scarcity of medium and high utility
elements may reflect the greater likelihood that these low utility elements, which are
denser, will be preserved in archaeological deposits. Deer/pronghorn elements represent
all portions of the carcass, but predominately low utility portions. Utility indices for
deer/antelope suggest that, as bison were increasingly pursued by hunters, representing
a shift toward more high-risk, high-reward hunting behaviors, meat-sharing appears
to have become less equitable overall at the site. A similar pattern is suggested by the
assemblage at Wilson-Leonard, where the utility index for deer/antelope appears to
increase as the index for bison decreases in the Paleoindian period, and reaches its

386

highest value in the Late Prehistoric, when the occupants at Wilson-Leonard are no
longer processing bison. Since preservation factors are so important to explanations
of assemblage composition and sharing behaviors, additional analyses of other better
preserved assemblages will be needed to validate this interpretation.
A regional comparison of sites suggests an increase in use of bison through time,
with bison notably absent from the few Early and Middle Archaic assemblages reviewed
here and not appearing in significant percentages until the Late Archaic. Use of
medium/small animals was highest during these early periods, coinciding with the
highest levels of diversity among the samples. Groups appear to have targeted deer/
antelope in the Late Archaic period, although several sites display heavy use of bison.
The assemblages from the Late Prehistoric sites vary significantly, with some reflecting
specialized activities such as bison butchering and processing, and geophyte roasting.
This indicates that some sites were used by logistical foraging groups, focused on
particular tasks that included tracking, hunting, and processing bison. The record of
other sites is dominated by assemblage diversity and evidence for more broad-spectrum
foraging. The faunal assemblage from Zatopec site demonstrates a similar pattern, with
heavy use of deer and pronghorn in the Late Archaic, an increasing focus on bison in
the Late Prehistoric, and a marked decrease in use of smaller mammals by the Toyah
occupation. This trend suggests a more limited range of activities at the site in later
periods, or use of the site by a more focused task group. To the extent that women,
children, and the elderly can be associated with the procurement of smaller animals,
this portion of the population appears to have either been largely absent from Zatopec
during Toyah times, or, more likely, to have been engaged in other tasks, such as
butchering, hide preparation, and bone tool manufacture.

Chapter X
Archaeobotanical Analyses

Editor’s note

T

he excavation proposal for the Zatopec mitigation project
included provision for the recovery of sediment samples for
pollen analysis and for the collection of larger bulk samples for
macrobotanical analysis. Together, the microbotanical (pollen and
phytolith) and macrobotanical results compose the archaeobotanical
analysis for this project. The goals of these analyses were to
reconstruct the paleoenvironmental setting of the site inasmuch
as possible and to develop an understanding of economic and
subsistence plant use by the site’s prehistoric inhabitants. Samples
for pollen analysis were collected from various contexts, including
several from a continuous column at grid coordinate N1004.5
E996.4, as well as from specific locations in and around the three
human burials. Representative samples from the column as well
as from Burial 1 were submitted for analysis to the Palynology
Laboratory at Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas. Those
results initially reported the presence of a “possible Zea” pollen
grain from sample TAMU-9, associated with Burial 1. Analysts
later amended the tentative identification, and this report simply

388

refers to the presence of Poaceae. In an effort to confirm this
potentially significant discovery, a second sample (1156-17), taken
from the interior of the cranium of Burial 1, was submitted to the
PaleoResearch Institute in Golden, Colorado, where analysts also
looked at the phytolith and starch grain content of this sample to
identify possible economic botanical species. No Zea mays was
identified, though their analysis identified other economically
useful plants and also yielded evidence characterizing the period
of site occupation during Burial 1, ca. 1290–1170 B.P., as cool
and moist. The TAMU pollen analysis is largely descriptive and
does not contribute in a significant way to the understanding of
prehistoric life, climate, or environment at Zatopec; it can be found
in Appendix K. The subsequent analysis, in contrast, provides
evidence for possible plant exploitation as well as environmental
conditions for the period when Burial 1 was interred. As a result,
that report is included in this chapter.
Bulk samples were collected and processed by flotation at CAS and
then sent for analysis to the Archaeological Research Laboratory at
the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, where they were analyzed
by Dr. Kandace D. Hollenbach. These results include numerous
food remains, the possible use of medicinal or perhaps ritual
plants, as well as seasonality data for site occupation during the
late-summer through fall. This report is also presented in this
chapter, and a complete listing of all macrobotanical remains is
included in Appendix C.

Phytolith Analysis

Sediment Associated with a
Burial From Site 41HY163

of

Linda Scott Cummings and Chad Yost

Previous pollen analysis of a sample associated with a burial from site 41HY163
in south Central Texas yielded possible evidence of Zea mays pollen. Because the
identification was tentative, an additional soil sample (1156-17) was submitted to
PaleoResearch Institute for testing. Pollen and phytolith analyses were conducted for
the specific purpose of finding any evidence for the presence of Zea mays or to find pollen
types that might be confused with Zea mays.
Methods
Pollen
A chemical extraction technique based on flotation is the standard preparation
technique used in this laboratory for the removal of the pollen from the large volume of
sand, silt, and clay with which they are mixed. This particular process was developed
for extraction of pollen from soils where preservation has been less than ideal and pollen
density is lower than in bogs or lake sediments.
Hydrochloric acid (10 percent) was used to remove calcium carbonates present in
the soil, after which the sample was screened through 150-micron mesh. The sample
was rinsed until neutral by adding water, letting the sample stand for two hours, and
then pouring off the supernatant. A small quantity of sodium hexametaphosphate was
added to the sample once it reached neutrality and then the beaker again was filled
with water and allowed to stand for two hours. The sample was again rinsed until
neutral, filling the beaker only with water. This step was added to remove clay prior to
heavy liquid separation. At this time the sample was dried, then pulverized. Sodium
polytungstate (density 2.1) was used for the flotation process. The sample was mixed
with sodium polytungstate and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 minutes to separate
organic from inorganic remains. The supernatant containing pollen and organic
remains was decanted. Sodium polytungstate again was added to the inorganic fraction
to repeat the separation process. The supernatant was decanted into the same tube
as the supernatant from the first separation. This supernatant was then centrifuged
at 1500 rpm for 10 minutes to allow any silica remaining to be separated from the
organics. Following this, the supernatant was decanted into a 50-ml conical tube and
diluted with distilled water. The sample was centrifuged at 3000 rpm to concentrate the
organic fraction in the bottom of the tube. After rinsing the pollen-rich organic fraction
obtained by this separation, the sample received a short (20–30 minute) treatment in

390

hot hydrofluoric acid to remove any remaining inorganic particles. The sample then was
acetolated for three to five minutes to remove extraneous organic matter.
A light microscope was used to count the pollen to a total of 301 pollen grains at
a magnification of ×500. Pollen preservation in this sample was poor. Comparative
reference material collected at the Intermountain Herbarium at Utah State University
and the University of Colorado Herbarium was used to identify the pollen to the family,
genus, and species level, where possible (Table 10-1).
Indeterminate pollen includes pollen grains that are folded, mutilated, and
otherwise distorted beyond recognition. These grains are included in the total pollen
count, as they are part of the pollen record. The charcoal frequency registers the
relationship between pollen and charcoal. The total number of microscopic charcoal
fragments was divided by the pollen sum, resulting in a charcoal frequency that reflects
the quantity of charcoal observed, normalized per 100 pollen grains.
Pollen aggregates were recorded during identification of the pollen. Aggregates are
clumps of a single type of pollen and may be interpreted to represent pollen dispersal
over short distances or the introduction of portions of the plant represented into an
archaeological setting. Aggregates were included in the pollen counts as single grains,
as is customary. The presence of aggregates is noted by an “A” next to the pollen
frequency on the pollen diagram. A plus sign (+) on the pollen diagram indicates that
the pollen type was observed outside the regular count while scanning the remainder
of the microscope slide. Pollen diagrams are produced using Tilia, a pollen-diagramdrafting program developed by Dr. Eric Grimm of the Illinois State Museum. Total
pollen concentrations are calculated in Tilia using the quantity of sample processed in
cubic centimeters (cc), the quantity of exotics (spores) added to the sample, the quantity
of exotics counted, and the total pollen counted and expressed as pollen per cc of
sediment.
Pollen analysis also included identification of starch granules to general categories,
if they were present. Starch granules are a plant’s mechanism for storing carbohydrates.
Starches are found in numerous seeds, as well as in starchy roots and tubers. The
primary categories of starches include the following: with or without visible hila, hilum
centric or eccentric, hila patterns (dot, cracked, elongated), and shape of starch (angular,
ellipse, circular, eccentric). Some of these categories are typical of specific plants, while
others are more common and tend to occur in many different types of plants.

Phytoliths
Extraction of phytoliths from this sample also was based on heavy liquid floatation.
Sodium hypochlorite (bleach) was first used to destroy the organic fraction from 15 ml of
sediment. Once this reaction was complete, the sample was rinsed to remove the bleach.
If the sample contained calcium carbonates, it was reacted with 30 percent hydrochloric
acid then rinsed until neutral. A small quantity of sodium hexametaphosphate was
added once it reached neutrality, then the sample was allowed to settle according to
Stoke’s Law in a 500-ml beaker. This process was repeated with EDTA. These steps
remove clay particles prior to heavy liquid separation. Next, the sample was freeze
dried. The dried silts and sands were then mixed with sodium polytungstate (density
2.3) and centrifuged to separate the phytoliths, which will float, from the other silica,
which will not. Phytoliths, in the broader sense, may include opal phytoliths and
calcium oxalate crystals. Calcium oxalate crystals are formed by Opuntia (prickly pear
cactus), Yucca (yucca), and other plants, and they are separated, rather than destroyed,
using this extraction technique if these forms have survived in the sediments. Any
remaining clay was floated with the phytoliths and was further removed by mixing
with sodium hexametaphosphate and distilled water. The sample was then rinsed
with distilled water, then alcohols to remove the water. After several alcohol rinses,
the sample was mounted in immersion oil for counting with a light microscope at a
magnification of ×500. The phytolith diagram was produced using Tilia.
Ethnobotanical Review
It is common in archaeological studies to reference ethnographically documented plant
uses as indicators of possible or probable uses in prehistoric times. The ethnobotanic
literature provides evidence for the exploitation of numerous plants in historic times,
both by broad categories and by specific example. Evidence for exploitation from
numerous sources can suggest a widespread utilization, strengthening the possibility
that the same or similar resources were used in prehistoric times. Ethnographic sources
outside the study area have been consulted to permit a detailed review of potential
uses for each plant. Sources document that historically the cultural use of some plants
was developed in the past and carried forward. A plant with medicinal qualities very
likely was discovered in prehistoric times and the usage persisted into historic times.
There is likely to have been some knowledge loss concerning the utilization of plant
resources as cultures moved from subsistence to agricultural economies and/or were
introduced to European foods in historic times. The ethnobotanic literature serves only
as a guide, indicating that the potential for utilization existed in prehistoric times, not
as conclusive evidence that the resources were used. Pollen, phytoliths and macrofloral
remains, when compared with the material culture (artifacts and features) recovered by
archaeologists, can all be useful indicators of use.

393

Native Plants: Cyperaceae (Sedge Family)
The Cyperaceae (sedge) family contains grasslike or rushlike herbaceous plants
commonly found in riparian habitats. Only a few members of this family are of economic
importance. The nutlike tubers of Cyperus esculentus (chufa, yellow nutgrass) can be
eaten raw, boiled, or dried and ground into flour (Peterson 1977:230). The seeds of
Cyperus odoratus, as reported by E. Palmer (1871), were reported to have been eaten
by the Cocopah Indians, while the Apache were noted to have eaten the underground
parts of Cyperus Fendlerianus (Kearney and Peebles 1960:149–150). The Pima were
reported to have eaten the small tubers of Cyperus ferax, and to have chewed fresh or
dried tubers of Cyperus esculentus for coughs (Curtin 1984:98–99). Cyperus esculentus
and Cyperus rotundus (nutgrass) can be common weeds in cultivated fields and pastures
(Kearney and Peebles 1960:150). The young shoots and bases of older shoots of Scirpus
validus and Scirpus acutus (great bulrush, tule) can be eaten raw or cooked. The pollen
and ground seeds can be used as flour, and the rootstalks, which are rich in sugar and
starch, can be roasted for several hours and eaten like potatoes or dried and ground into
flour (Peterson 1977:230). The Hopi Indians were reported to have eaten the raw stem
bases of Scirpus acutus. Scirpus stems also were used for weaving (Kearney and Peebles
1960:151).
Poaceae (Grass Family)
Members of the Poaceae (grass) family have been widely used as a food resource.
Grass grains were normally parched and ground into a meal to make various mushes
and cakes, and young shoots and leaves were cooked as greens. Grass also was reported
to have been used as a floor covering. Some species of grass were used medicinally.
Andropogon glomeratus (bushy bluestem) was used by the Catawba Indians to treat
backache. Hordeum jubatum (foxtail barley) has been used as an eye medicine. A
decoction of Oryza sativa (rice) has been used in fevers and inflammatory infections
of the stomach, lungs, and kidneys. Paiute Indians gave sugar from Phragmites
communis (common reed) to people with pneumonia. This plant also has been used as
a diuretic, depurient, and an emetic. Grass seeds ripen from spring to fall, depending
on the species, and can provide a long-term available resource (Burlage 1968:81–85;
Chamberlin 1964:372; Harrington 1967:322).
Phragmites (Common Reed, Reedgrass)
Phragmites (common reed, reedgrass, reed) is a perennial grass with jointed, stout,
leafy, hollow or pithy stems that can grow up to six to twelve feet in height. The plant
is found in freshwater swamps, marshes, and around springs in temperate regions of
the world. Stems or culms of reedgrass were used to make arrow shafts, prayer sticks,
weaving rods, pipestems, mats, screens, cordage, nets, thatching, and fishing poles

394

(Kearney and Peebles 1960:89; Kirk 1975:179). The hollow stems of Phragmites also
were used to make “reedgrass cigarettes” that have been generally believed to represent
ritual smoking. These reedgrass cigarettes have been found in Mogollon, Anasazi,
Hohokam, and Salado sites in the southwest United States, and also from prehistoric
sites in the Great Basin, Trans-Pecos area and in Mexico (Adams 1990:123–124).
Young Phragmites shoots and leaves were boiled as potherbs. Seeds can be dried and
ground into flour or boiled whole. Roots can be eaten raw, boiled, or roasted. The seeds
are said to be nutritious and may be dried and ground into flour or boiled whole, hull
and all (Kirk 1975:177). It has been reported that crystallized droplets of honeydew
were removed and formed into balls of a sweet manna-like substance. It has also
been reported from the Great Basin region that the botanist F. V. Colville observed
Phragmites stalks being dried, ground, and the resulting flour placed near a fire, where
it bubbled like marshmallows and turned to “taffy” (Ebeling 1986:116–118).
Marantaceae
The Marantaceae (arrowroot family) are a group of perennial herbs with starchy
tuberous rhizomes. The Marantaceae produce distinctive and diagnostic phytoliths and
starch grains (Chandler-Ezel, et al. 2006; Iriarte and Paz 2009; Piperno 1989, 2006).
Important economic plants within the family cultivated for food and ornamental use
include Maranta, Calathea and Thalia. It should be noted that the Marantaceae are
closely allied with the canna family (Cannaceae) and are recognized as a sister taxa.
Also, Thalia is more closely related to the Calathea group than other Marantaceae
groups such as the Maranta group (Andersson and Chase 2001). This is important
because phytolith morphology can be highly correlated to phylogeny and classification.
The Marantaceae are pantropical, and most diverse in the American tropics. Some
genera extend into subtropical and warm-temperate regions, and can be found naturally
in moist forest habitats and swamps. While Maranta and Calathea occur in Mexico, only
two species of Thalia are native to North America north of Mexico. Thalia geniculata
is extant today in Louisiana and Florida, flowers June through December, fruits
August through January, and can be found in swamps, marshes, cypress sloughs, along
streams and lakes, often in regions with a pronounced dry season. Thalia dealbata is
extant today in portions of Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Illinois, Arkansas, Louisiana,
Georgia, and the Carolinas. Thalia dealbata flowers May through September and fruits
June through October. An interesting aspect of Thalia dealbata is that it is the only
Marantaceae endemic to North America and the only one not found in the tropics. It has
been hypothesized that Thalia dealbata is the result of an early, chance long-distance
dispersal event from a South American population (Kennedy 2000; Zomlefer 1994).
Because of their perishable nature, evidence for use of roots and tubers in the
archaeological record is limited, and usually derived from starch grain analysis. Phytolith

395

production in roots and tubers of many plants is understudied. In addition, application
of phytolith analysis to archaeological investigations is limited. Thus, Marantaceae
subsistence and medicinal utilization is not well understood. Moerman (1998) lists
one account of Seminole use of Thalia geniculata as a food. Most of the Marantaceae
subsistence record is derived from use of arrowroot (Maranta arundinacea) and Guinea
arrowroot, also called sweet-corm root, and lerén (Calathea allouia) in southern Mexico,
Central and South America. Maranta is cultivated for its starchy roots which yield an
edible starch that makes both flour and a very smooth jelly or paste. The flour is largely
starch, easily digested, and often used as a thickener. Because Native Americans believed
that the root absorbed poison from arrow wounds, the plant has long been thought to
have medicinal properties (Atran, et al. 2003; Breedlove and Laughlin 2000:224; Kiple
2000:1721). One account described a Native American as applying the oozing sap from an
arrowroot rhizome directly to a flesh wound cause by an arrow (Rogers 1913). Cultivation
of Maranta requires an annual rainfall of 95–150 cm, but a sufficient water supply
throughout the growing period is required. Ideal soils for Maranta are well-drained,
slightly acid, loam soils (Kay 1987). Calathea allouia has been cultivated by indigenous
farmers for more than a thousand years. The roots are a rich source of many essential
amino acids and are valued for their texture, which remains crisp after cooking, and
their flavor, which is said to resemble green maize (Kiple 2000:1782). Young spikes are
also reported as being edible (Atran et al. 2003:134), and leaves are used to wrap various
foods, including meat (Breedlove and Laughlin 2000:224). Calathea allouia cultivation
requires a tropical climate of wet and dry seasons, and an annual rainfall of 150–200 cm,
but is intolerant of both drought and waterlogging. Soils are ideally a loose loam or clay
that permits good drainage (Kay 1987).
Cultigens: Zea mays (Maize, Corn)
Cultivation of Zea mays (maize, corn) originated in Central America from a wild
grass called teosinte. Maize cultivation then spread throughout the United States. Corn
was (and still is) an important food, for which innumerable preparation methods exist.
Ripe corn kernels were dried, parched and ground into a meal, hulled with lye from
ashes to make hominy, or prepared in various other ways (Gilmore 1977:15). Whole ears
were also boiled and eaten. Corn silks were dried and ground with the parched corn to
add sweetness. The corn smut fungus Ustilago was also used for food. The fungi were
gathered when the spores were firm and ripe and were boiled (Rogers 1980:42). Seed
corn retains a few inner husks, and clean husks are saved for smoking and other uses,
such as wrapping food (Cushing 1920:264–267; Robbins, et al. 1916:83–93; Stevenson
1915:73–76; Whiting 1939:97–70). Burlage (1968:85) noted that “Indian corn is nutrient,
emollient, protective, absorbent and an antidote to iodine poisoning.” The Navajo have
been reported to use corn in medicine for sore throats.

396

Analysis and Discussion of Sample 1156-17, Burial 1 at Zatopec
Zatopec is an open campsite located within the southwest boundary of San Marcos,
Texas. This portion of south Central Texas below the Balcones Escarpment marks the
interface between the Edwards Plateau (Hill Country) and the Blackland Prairie. San
Marcos Springs, the outlet for the Edwards Aquifer resulting from the uplift associated
with the Balcones Fault Zone, provide a habitat that supports abundant plant and
animal communities. Some of the longest human occupational records in North America
are associated with San Marcos Springs (Brune 1981).
The Blackland Prairie is characterized by tallgrass grasslands, while the Hill
Country supports a juniper-oak-mesquite savannah. Local vegetation at the site
includes Osage orange (Maclura pomifera), anaqua (Ehretia anaca), netleaf privet
(Forestiera reticulata), netleaf hackberry (Celtis reticulata), honey mesquite (Prosopis
glandulosa), and chinaberry (Melia azedarach).
Sample 1156-17 was sediment removed from a skeleton during cleaning. This
sample was removed from the burial matrix in an isolated room used for housing
human remains. Radiocarbon dates of 1210 B.P., 1250 B.P., and 2290 B.P. were
reported on material collected closest to the burial, beneath the skull, and beneath
the femur, respectively. The burial itself returned a date of 1300 ± 20 B.P., putting
it at the transition from Late Archaic II to Late Prehistoric Austin phase occupation
(see Chapter 5). For purposes of reconstructing the site’s environment, results of this
analysis apply generally to these two time periods (AU 2a and AU 1b). Previous pollen
analysis of a different sample associated with the same burial initially yielded evidence
of possible Zea mays (this assessment was later retracted; see Appendix K). Pollen and
phytolith analyses of sample 1156-17 were undertaken for information concerning the
possible presence of Zea mays and to document that evidence.
Pollen recovered from sample 1156-17 was consistent with the presence of a nearby
wetland or spring, as well as local vegetation indicating an open habitat (Figure 10-1;
see Table 10-1). Pollen representing trees was rare and included Alnus, Pinus, Prosopis,
Quercus, and Ulmus, representing alder, pine, mesquite, oak, and elm. Clearly,
the pollen represented the location of this site at the interface of the Hill Country
and grassland. The most abundant pollen type noted in this sample was high-spine
Asteraceae, probably representing a variety of shrubby and herbaceous plants in the
sunflower family. Recovery of small quantities of low-spine Asteraceae and Liguliflorae
pollen indicated the presence of other plants in the sunflower family such as ragweed,
cocklebur, marshelder and closely related plants, as well as members of the chicory
tribe. Recovery of small quantities of Acanthaceae, Apiaceae, Brassicaceae, Dodonaea,
Eriogonum, Euphorbia, Fabaceae, Malvaceae, Nyctaginaceae, Onagraceae, Opuntia,
Phlox, Poaceae, Solanaceae (Datura-type), and Typha pollen indicated a variety of
habitats in the vicinity of the site that supported members of the acanthus, umbel, and

mustard families, hop-bush, wild buckwheat, spurge, members of the legumes, mallow,
four o’clock, and evening primrose families, prickly pear cactus, phlox, grasses, a
member of the nightshade family (possibly datura), and cattail.
One purpose of this analysis was to search for Zea mays pollen or types that can
be confused with Zea mays. A scan of this sample yielded a probable Zea mays pollen
confuser, labeled Poaceae large on the diagram, although a Zea mays identification
can not be ruled out entirely. This pollen grain, like many others from this sample, did
not have a well preserved exine. The apparent pore area included a distinct hole and a
less distinct annulus or possible annular area. This annular area was not sufficiently
convincing to identify the pollen grain as definite or even probable Zea mays. Therefore,
this pollen was examined using Hoffmann modulation (similar to phase contrast), oil
immersion, and a magnification of ×100. The grain measures 75 microns in diameter,
with a pore opening of 6.25 microns and an annulus with a maximum diameter of 10
microns. Zea mays pollen may be as small as 75 microns in diameter in archaeological
samples, but the annulated area around the pore should be larger than 10 microns. The
surface of Zea mays pollen should exhibit specific patterning at ×100. The patterning
of the surface of the Poaceae large (possible Zea mays) pollen in this sample included
closely spaced pits but not the distinctive patterning observed on reference material
(Figure 10-2). It is entirely possible that the rather severe decomposition of the pollen
surface has made identification of the pollen from the surface patterning on the exine
impossible. Other grass pollens are large, with large annuli. For instance, Bluebunch

Figure 10-2. Comparison of Zea mays reference (a) and Poaceae, large pollen (b). Note
the very obvious annulated pore (a) and the near absence of annulation around the pore
(b) of the archaeological specimen. The detail of exine patterning is visible on the Zea
mays reference pollen (a), and less visible on the archaeological specimen. Finally, both
images are at the same scale. Images were taken at ×100, oil immersion, using a Plan
Apochromatic objective on a Nikon microscope.

399

wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata) pollen measures up to at least 65 microns in
diameter with a pore opening of 6.25 microns and an annulus diameter of 15 microns.
The issue of preservation and absence of a well-defined annulus around the pore of this
pollen is sufficient that one may not make a definitive interpretation for the presence of
Zea mays in this sample.
Phytolith analysis yielded a fairly well preserved and highly concentrated
assemblage of phytolith morphotypes (Figure 10-3); however, some evidence of
dissolution was observed. Phytolith dissolution can occur in contexts of periodic to
moist soils under basic (high pH) conditions. The initial morphotype count was stopped
at 300, and then the remainder of the slide was scanned for phytoliths diagnostic of
economically and culturally important plants. The diagnostic phytolith assemblage was
dominated by cool-season grasses (C3 metabolism) that thrive during the cooler and
wetter portions of fall, winter and spring, as well as within riparian zones where moist
conditions persist throughout the year. Specifically, trapeziform sinuates diagnostic of
the grass subfamily Pooideae dominated this portion of the assemblage (Figure 10-4a).
While some of these trapeziform sinuates were consistent with morphotypes produced
by brome (Bromus), fescue (Festuca) and bluegrass (Poa), most of them were distinctive
of those produced by wetland grasses such as bluejoint (Calamagrostis) and canary
grass (Phalaris). Phytoliths diagnostic of C4 metabolism chloridoids (saddles) and
panicoids (bilobates, crosses) were rare in the record. Chloridoid grasses typically thrive
under hot, dry and sandy habitats. Panicoids are typical of tallgrass prairie and thrive
under warm, humid and sometimes mesic conditions. Maize is a panicoid that produces
bilobates, crosses and rondel morphotypes, some of which are very distinctive. All of
these morphotypes were rare or absent in the record, and as such, suggest the absence
of maize in this sample. One phytolith diagnostic of the obligate wetland plant common
reed (Phragmites australis) was observed that indicates the presence of a riparian area
nearby (Figure 10-4b).
Phragmites has many uses, both for subsistence and for structural and construction
purposes. Also observed here were a few phytoliths diagnostic of the epidermis of
sedge family (Cyperaceae) achenes (fruits that contain a seed; Figure 10-4c). This also
indicates the presence of at least moist soil conditions. Like Phragmites, the Cyperaceae
have myriad uses, from subsistence (achenes and tubers) to structural (matting).
Further supporting the existence of moist soil conditions was the presence of freshwater
sponge spicules in this sample.
After the initial 300 phytolith count, the remainder of the slide was scanned for
phytoliths diagnostic of economically important plants. It was during the scan that
several phytoliths diagnostic of the arrowroot family (Marantaceae) were observed
(Figure 10-4d–h). This same morphotype has recently been observed by PRI during
analyses of archaeological sites near Carlsbad, New Mexico. Determination of the plant
of origin for this morphotype still is ongoing at PRI; however, this morphotype is most

similar to those produced by the edible rhizome of Calathea rather than those produced
by other members of the Marantaceae. Thalia dealbata and Thalia geniculata are the
only two species of Marantaceae native to North America north of Mexico. Thalia is
an aquatic emergent plant of the southeastern United States found in ponds, swamps,
marshes, and along the margins of streams and lakes, often in areas with pronounced
dry seasons. Thalia dealbata is found as far west as eastern Texas and Oklahoma. We
have looked at phytoliths from both species of Thalia and have not found a suitable
match for the Marantaceae phytoliths present in this sample. We have not yet looked at
phytoliths from the fruit and seed of Thalia, as these plants are still under cultivation
at PRI. Should Thalia inflorescence not produce an adequate match, the most likely
source for these unknown phytoliths would be the starchy rhizome of Calathea, to which
these unknown phytoliths bear a striking resemblance (see Figure 10-4 for a comparison
between a Marantaceae phytolith observed here [g] and a reference phytolith from
Calathea allouia [h]). The reference phytolith (Figure 10-4h) has a very well preserved
ciliate/beaded portion, whereas the Marantaceae phytolith (Figure 10-4g) has lost most
of this lightly silicified ciliate/beaded portion, most likely due to dissolution in the soil.

402

An ethnological and environmental summary for the Marantaceae was previously
discussed in the Ethnobotanic Review section of this report.
Summary and Conclusions
Combined pollen and phytolith analyses of a single soil sample from a burial at Zatopec
elucidate some salient points concerning the interpretation of the presence of Zea
mays. First, the single possible Zea mays pollen grain that was observed in this sample
could not be positively identified as Zea mays and is most likely not Zea mays but
rather large Poaceae pollen. This determination is made as a result of the presence of
a possible weakly annulated pore in the pollen grain. The poor state of preservation of
this pollen grain prevented positive identification, even though the pollen was examined
using Hoffmann modulation at ×100. The absence of any Zea mays cob type rondels
from the phytolith record supports this conclusion, since any ground maize or green
corn consumed would have also contained phytoliths from the glumes of the maize.
Recovery of phytoliths indicative of cool-season festucoid grasses that grow in wet or
moist habitats support the interpretation that grasses such as western wheatgrass
(Pascopyrum smithii), which can produce pollen with large, annulated pores, might well
have been part of the local grass population.
Pollen analysis yielded a record of pollen that was poorly to moderately well
preserved. As an example, pollen identified as Fabaceae, Artemisia, Euphorbia, and
Solanaceae (Daturatype) (see Figure 10-1, Table 10-1) were the worst preserved in this
record. Pollen that was slightly better preserved includes Prosopis, Quercus, Poaceae,
Low-spine Asteraceae, Apiaceae, some of the Brassicaceae, some of the Eriogonum,
and Typha. The remainder of the pollen recovered, with the single exception of the
possible Zea mays pollen, was better preserved and was identified with a high degree of
confidence.
Phytolith analysis indicates that moist to wet soils, possibly riparian soils, existed
in the area at the time of burial. Cool-season, C3 metabolism grasses dominated the
phytolith assemblage. Phragmites australis and sedges were also present on the
landscape. The most interesting observation was the identification of several phytoliths
diagnostic of the arrowroot family (Marantaceae). Modern phytolith reference work with
Thalia, the only Marantaceae native to North America north of Mexico, is ongoing. If
Thalia proves not be a suitable match for the Marantaceae phytoliths observed here,
then Calathea, a plant cultivated in Mexico, Central America, and South America
for its starchy roots and medicinal properties, is the most likely source for these
phytoliths. Modern phytolith reference work within the Calathea genera is planned
at PRI. With limited use of phytolith analysis in North American archaeology and
a relatively new understanding of Marantaceae phytolith production, an absence of
evidence for Marantaceae utilization from North American archaeological sites is not
surprising. This is especially true because highly perishable material like roots, tubers

403

and rhizomes rarely are preserved in the macrofloral archaeological record. In addition,
as a result of their amorphous shape and thin walls, Marantaceae pollen grains may
not preserve well and/or may not be recognized in pollen samples. Thus, because of the
uniqueness of this find, it is recommended that additional phytolith analyses of features
with good context from this site be conducted for a better understanding of the possible
utilization of arrowroot (Calathea, Thalia, etc.).

Plant Remains

from the

Zatopec Site (41HY163)

Kandace D. Hollenbach

The analysis of plant remains is one avenue of research into a group’s foodways—the
procurement, production, preparation, consumption, display, storage, and discard of
food. These practices vary by economic, social, and political situation, and thus provide
an entry to study the cultural traditions of a group (Johannessen 1993).
This report details the analysis of carbonized plant remains from the Zatopec site
(41HY163), a Late Transitional Archaic through Late Prehistoric period site in Hays
County, Texas. The site is located below the Balcones Escarpment, placing it in a prime
ecotonal position between the Edwards Plateau to the west and the Blackland Prairies
to the east (see Chapter 2). The former is characterized by oak (Quercus spp.) and
juniper (Juniperus sp.) savannah with an understory of grasses. The Blackland Prairie
is dominated by tall grass species, with oaks and mesquite (Prosopis sp.) on uplands
and slopes, and denser forests of oak, pecan (Carya illinoinensis), walnut (Juglans
sp.), hackberry (Celtis sp.), sumac (Rhus sp.), bald cypress (Taxodium distichum), and
cottonwood (Populus sp.) in rich stream valleys (Ricklis and Collins 1994:33).
A tributary of the San Marcos River, Purgatory Creek is located immediately southeast
of the site and would have served the occupants as a source of water, at least seasonally.
Plant remains were analyzed from 11 floatation samples and six sediment samples
collected from six different contexts at the site, including three burials that were
excavated over both the field schools and later CAS excavations (Table 10-2). The
floatation samples were collected during the 2007 excavations and processed by CAS.
The six sediment samples, all deriving from Feature 9 and postholes associated with it,
were collected during the 1985 excavations. Direct dates obtained from the three burials
place them at 1300 B.P. ± 20 (Burial 1), 1215 B.P. ± 20 (Burial 2), and 1305 B.P. ± 20
(Burial 3). The remaining features and samples probably date to the Late Archaic II
(2200–1250 B.P.) or Late Prehistoric Austin phase (1250–750 B.P.).
Because uncarbonized plant materials are unlikely to have been preserved in the
moist, acidic soils of the area, even from relatively recent historic contexts (Reitz and
Scarry 1985:10; Yarnell 1982), only carbonized plant remains were considered in this
analysis to be part of the archaeological record. Uncarbonized plant materials were
assumed to be modern contaminants that reflect the present-day local habitat, and are
generally not reported or discussed. The one exception is hackberry, the stones of which
can be preserved without carbonization due to their high calcium carbonate content
(Wang et al. 1997).

Methods
The 11 floatation samples were processed by the Center for Archaeological Studies
at Texas State University in San Marcos. The heavy fraction was captured in nested
1/4-in and 1/8-in screens, and the light fraction in fine mesh. Both the light and
heavy fractions were sent to the Archaeological Research Laboratory (ARL) at the
University of Tennessee-Knoxville for analysis. The six sediment samples were sent in

their entirety to the ARL. These were not further processed, but instead were
analyzed by a method similar to that used for the heavy fractions of floatation
samples.

The samples were analyzed using standard paleoethnobotanical procedures
(Pearsall 2000). Once weighed, the samples were size-graded using nested geologic
sieves. Shell was removed from the 4.00-mm sieve, while lithics, burnt clay, and plant
remains were sorted down to the 2.00-mm sieve (see Table 10-1). Plant remains were
further identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level using a stereoscopic microscope
with ×10–40 magnification. Materials less than 2.00 mm in size were scanned for seeds
and plant remains not represented in the larger size fraction. If present, acorn remains
were pulled from the 1.40-mm sieve to mitigate biases against their preservation.
All materials were then counted and weighed, although shell was only weighed.
Plant identifications were made with reference to Martin and Barkley’s (1961) Seed
Identification Manual and the PLANTS Database (U.S. Department of Agriculture
– Natural Resources Conservation Service [USDA-NRCS] 2009), as well as modern
comparative specimens housed at the ARL.
Results
The 17 samples yielded 5.00 g of carbonized plant remains, most of which (4.19 g) is
represented by wood (see Table 10-1). The non-wood plant materials include nuts, fruits,
and miscellaneous taxa (Table 10-3; see Appendix C for a listing of plant taxa recovered
from each sample).

Nuts
Nut taxa recovered from the samples include acorn and hickory, which may
represent pecan (Carya illioinensis). Only four definitive fragments of hickory nutshell
and two fragments of acorn shell were identified in the samples (see Table 10-3).
Although few fragments were recovered, acorn shell is relatively fragile, especially when
compared with hickory nutshell, often resulting in the underrepresentation of acorn at
archaeological sites (Yarnell and Black 1985:97–98). A number of tentatively identified
acorn remains, including four possible fragments of acorn meat, were also recovered. It
is worth noting that acorn (including tentatively identified remains) was recovered from
eight of the samples, and hickory nutshell (including tentative specimens) from only
four. This further speaks to the use of this mast resource.
Hickory nuts and acorns are frequently recovered from sites in the Eastern
Woodlands, as both were important staples in the diets of prehistoric peoples (Gardner
1997; Scarry 2003; Yarnell and Black 1985). Acorns were used widely throughout
North America by prehistoric and historic groups, as various oak species are widely
distributed throughout the continent. Central Texas is the western limit of geographical
distribution of pecan and other hickories, however, suggesting that these nuts would not
have been as important to foragers in this region as to neighbors farther east (Hammett
1997:203–205; USDA-NRCS 2009). This perhaps holds less true for pecan, which was a
significant seasonal food resource for groups encountered by Spanish explorers through
Central Texas in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (Hall 2000). Acorns, pecans,
and hickory nuts would have been collected in autumn and could be stored and eaten
through winter, until fresh plant foods became available again in spring.
In addition to differences in distribution and availability, the two nuts play very
different dietary roles and require significantly different processing techniques. Hickory
nuts are high in fat and protein (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research
Service, Nutrient Data Laboratory [USDA NDL] 2004), and were often crushed and
boiled down to make an oil or milk. The resulting liquid could be drunk as a beverage
or used in stews or porridges (Carr 1895:171, 182–183; Kuhnlein and Turner 1991:209;
Swanton 1946:265). Acorns, on the other hand, are high in carbohydrates (USDA NDL
2004). After being leached of tannins, the nutmeats were commonly ground into a meal
and subsequently made into a mash or bread (Carr 1895:172; Densmore 1974:320;
Kuhnlein and Turner 1991:200–201; Palmer 1871:409–410).
The collection of nuts requires few implements other than baskets or bags to carry
loads back to camp, but may demand a significant labor investment, particularly for
groups whose diets include considerable quantities of nuts. This is certainly true for
native groups in California, for whom acorns were a staple food. “[A]ll competent family
members, male and female, and adult and child” (Jackson 1991:303–304) participated in
collecting acorns, primarily to harvest as many as possible before birds and animals did.

410

Gatherers are more likely to have brought collected nuts back to camp than to
have processed them in the field. Field-processing would allow gatherers to bring
larger quantities of nutmeats and lesser quantities of low-utility nutshell back to
camp. However, the time required to process nuts in the field prohibits this (Metcalfe
and Barlow 1992). Bettinger and colleagues (1997) estimate that gatherers would
have to travel one-way distances of roughly 50 km to make field-processing of acorns
worthwhile. Since oak trees are common in the plant communities in the vicinity of
Zatopec, the occupants almost certainly would have processed acorns at the site.
While all family members were enlisted to collect nuts, ethnographic accounts
indicate that processing fell primarily to women (Jackson 1991). Nutting stones and
mortars, used to crack open and grind nuts, were made and owned by women in native
Californian groups. These include bedrock mortars, manufactured at three depths to
grind acorn meal to different levels of fineness (Jackson 1991; Powers 1873–1874:374).
As fixed production loci, such bedrock mortars figured prominently in gatherers’ mental
maps of the landscape, as stands of highly productive trees likely did (Jackson 1991).
Fruits
Fruit remains recovered from the samples are largely limited to hackberry seed
fragments (see Table 10-3). Two fragments that may represent persimmon seed were
identified in one sample, although these also resemble the outer hull of hickory nuts.
The small size and poor preservation of the specimens precludes a more definitive
identification.
The hackberry seeds present an interesting interpretative dilemma. Although
uncarbonized hackberry seeds may be preserved in archaeological sites, due to their
high calcium carbonate content (Wang et al. 1997), the trees produce significant
quantities of fruits that, at the end of the season, leave significant quantities of seeds on
the ground. It is therefore best to consider uncarbonized hackberry seeds to be modern
inclusions. The carbonized hackberry seeds are another question. The 33 fragments
were recovered from four samples. This regular recovery suggests that these may have
been carbonized by anthropogenic efforts, rather than natural fires. Hackberry seeds
have also been recovered from other prehistoric sites in Texas, such as the Varga site in
Edwards County and the Lower Pecos rock-shelters in southwest Texas (Dering 2006a).
Although small, hackberries are good sources of nutrients such as sugar and calcium
(Dering 2006a). These small berries can be eaten fresh (Niethammer 1974:72; Peterson
1977:194) or pounded into a meal. This meal can then be shaped into cakes and dried
for use in the winter (Niethammer 1974:72), used to flavor meat (Kindscher 1987:242;
Kurz 1997:74; Yanovsky 1936:19), or mixed with parched corn and fat (Dering 2006a;
Yanovsky 1936:19).
Persimmons also may be eaten fresh or dried (Havard 1896; Kuhnlein and Turner
1991; Moerman 2004; Swanton 1946; Yanovsky 1936), and apparently were consumed

411

in “large quantities” (Palmer 1871:471) by some historic native groups. Some native
groups prepared persimmons for winter use by forming the pulp into cakes and drying
them (Swanton 1946), or making them into preserves (Palmer 1871:471).
Both hackberries and persimmons ripen in fall; the latter are not palatable until
after the first frost of autumn (Radford et al. 1964; Schopmeyer 1974). The two trees are
also similar in habitat, growing in a variety of settings but preferring disturbed grounds
and alluvial soils (Radford et al. 1964).
Miscellaneous Taxa
The miscellaneous plant remains recovered from the site provide a general
indication of the local habitat. For example, the recovery of one definitive and several
possible pine cone scales suggests the presence of pine trees in the local vicinity.
A variety of weedy taxa, including chenopod, purslane, verbena, and members of the
aster, pink, and possibly nightshade families, also indicated in the pollen and phytolith
records, indicate the presence of disturbed grounds, such as domestic settings, in which
these weedy species thrive (Radford et al. 1964). However, these weedy taxa have
additional uses. Chenopod seeds are edible, as are the spring and summer leaves of
chenopod, purslane, and some members of the nightshade family (Hunt 1992; Kavasch
1977:22; Kuhnlein and Turner 1991; Moerman 2004; Niethammer 1974; Palmer 1871;
Peterson 1977:152; Yanovsky 1936). Verbena leaves and those of some members of the
pink family have also been used to make a tea by some native groups (Moerman 2004).
Members of these taxa also have various medicinal and ceremonial uses, particularly
for leaves, roots, and stems (Moerman 2004). It should be noted, however, that the seeds
were recovered from the archaeological deposits. These do not provide direct evidence
that the spring and summer shoots and leaves, not to mention the roots, of these plants
were used by the occupants of the site, but do indicate that they were growing in the
immediate vicinity of the site and therefore were available for use. In fact, it is quite
plausible that these useful plants were actively encouraged to grow in the site’s vicinity.
In addition, two fragments of monocot stem were recovered from the samples. The
stems, leaves, and fibers of various monocot plants served a range of utilitarian uses.
Stems and leaves may have been woven into a number of items, and fibers of monocot
stems can be braided into cordage (Moerman 2004).
Two unidentified seeds were recovered. One resembles a very large sumac (Rhus sp.)
seed, measuring 5.9 × 4.7 mm, nearly circular around its midpoint, with a vague hilum
(attachment scar) at the midpoint. A portion of the outer seed wall (pericarp) has been
worn away. Sumac berries were often used to make a beverage similar to lemonade.
To make the drink, the berries were crushed, bruised, or roasted (Havard 1896:445; Peterson 1977:186; Yanovsky 1936:40–41) to help abate tannins in the berries
(Kindscher 1987:191–193). Berries were also mixed into cornmeal as a flavoring agent
(Kindscher 1987:191–193; Kurz 1997:200–204). The fruits generally ripen in summer

412

and fall, and the shrubs thrive in disturbed areas and woodland margins (Radford et al.
1964).
The second unidentified specimen is larger, measuring 10.2 × 7.3 mm, with a
distinct attachment scar at one end. The specimen is ovoid or ellipsoid in shape; the
end opposite the attachment scar has been worn away. The outer wall has numerous
small, longitudinal striations, as well as small, bubbly protrusions and pits. This
specimen resembles a small wild onion (Allium sp.) bulb. Wild onion and other bulbs
are commonly recovered from Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric sites throughout Texas
(Dering 2006b, 2008), serving as an important source of carbohydrates from late fall
through spring, when other plant foods are unavailable. In addition to a foodstuff,
wild onions were used by native peoples for a wide variety of medicinal applications
(Moerman 2004).
Comparison by Context
Few of the samples stand out from the others in terms of plant materials recovered
from them (see Appendix C). Two of the Feature 9 samples (412/416 and 415.1)
contained relatively large numbers of carbonized hackberry seeds (10 and 16 fragments,
respectively, of the 33 recovered from the samples). Sample 415.1 from Feature 9 also
included one verbena seed and the possible sumac seed.
Several additional samples from certain features contained small seeds. These
include Feature 07-4 (Sample 1064-6), a circular pit that intruded into a layer of
burned and fire-cracked rock (see Chapter 5), with the seed of the aster family and
eight unidentifiable seed fragments. Two samples from Burial 1 (Samples 1155-4 and
1156-16) contained one possible nightshade family seed fragment and one chenopod
seed. The two samples from Burials 2 and 3 (Samples 1193-8 and 1193-40) contained
one chenopod seed, one pink family seed, one purslane seed, the possible wild onion
bulb, and three unidentified seeds. It may be coincidental that small seeds are limited
to these contexts, and the seeds might simply be commensal. But it is tempting to
speculate that the burials may have been prepared using plants with medicinal or
possibly ritual properties, such as nightshade, or that the activities performed in
Features 07-4 and 9, interpreted as circular pits perhaps for storage or, more likely,
processing, may have included the use of medicinal plants.
Conclusions
The plant assemblage recovered from Zatopec, although not particularly extensive,
provides valuable information regarding the foodways of the site’s prehistoric occupants.
These groups gathered various wild food resources, including acorns, hickory nuts,
hackberries, chenopod seeds, and likely wild onions and sumac. Although these were
“wild” resources, it is probable that groups managed them to some degree, through
planting, pruning, weeding, and the like (Hammett 1997; Munson 1986; Scarry 2003).

413

In this vein, Late Archaic II and Late Prehistoric Austin phase occupants of the site
might have encouraged, if not actively tended, useful plants such as wild onions and
chenopod.
To the extent that these plant resources served as predictable, reliable foodstuffs, it
is likely that the occupants of Zatopec organized their use of the landscape around the
exploitation of these plant foods. Minimally, this would have included aggregating at
the site during seasons when these useful plants would have been most accessible, latesummer and fall (see Table 10-3). This seasonal schedule is confirmed by the results of
the pollen and phytolith analyses, presented earlier in this chapter, that indicate cool,
moist habitats. (In addition to seasonality data, those findings also define a riparian
setting for the site.) Gatherers, namely women, children, and the elderly, would have
worked in seasonal rhythms to obtain particular plant foods from various habitats,
and processed and stored some of them. Sites with prepared features and cached tools,
such as earth ovens, manos, and metates, as well as resource-rich locales, would have
held prominent places in gatherers’ mental maps of local landscapes. Therefore, it is
important to view the gathering activities of the peoples living at Zatopec and along the
Balcones Escarpment as the result of meaningful decisions made by individuals, rather
than simply as opportunistic.

Temporal

and

Behavioral Trends

Jon C. Lohse, Spencer LeDoux, and Julian A. Sitters

Through the various analyses of archaeological evidence described in this report
several trends have been observed that demonstrate how occupants of the Zatopec
site identified, applied, altered, and shifted strategies for coping with external
environmental issues. Although not all these externalities have yet been identified,
other research (e.g., Mauldin et al. 2010) has observed a marked increase in reliance on
bison by the beginning of the Toyah period. This shift in resource utilization coincided
with changing climate and may have partly been a response to it, as weather patterns
became both drier and more variable (see Chapter 2). Although all requisite data are
not available from Zatopec to address the climate change scenario, faunal evidence
(Chapter 9) and radiocarbon data (Chapter 5) indicate that Zatopec fits comfortably into
the regional cultural pattern identified by Mauldin et al. (2010) and others (see Chapter
2) of increased reliance on bison in Toyah times.
Radiocarbon data also suggest important changes in site occupation patterns, with
postulated periods between site visits decreasing from approximately once every century
in Late Archaic-to-Austin times to once every 50 years in the following period.
Even though the sample size was limited, isotope data from the human remains
recovered from Zatopec and from 41HY161 reflect a relative degree of population
stability and continuity, at least with respect to habitual use of and proximity to nearriverine terrestrial resources. However, the Toyah burial from 41HY161, a female
originating from the Gulf Coast area, indicates that non-local people, perhaps especially
women, were sometimes being integrated into local populations in Toyah times
(Chapter 8).
When considered together, these data begin to sketch a scenario in which regional
inhabitants maintained relatively stable and continuous cultural practices at least

416

from Late Archaic I to Austin times (but with some small changes in technological
behavior; see below). However, at the beginning of the Toyah interval, ca. A.D. 1250,
site occupants facing new environmental strains in the form of increasing aridity,
responded, at least in part, by altering their mobility patterns, by expanding their
reliance on bison hunting, and by adapting much of their dietary and other economic
behavior to this new subsistence system. The value of bison hides in trade networks
that were emerging at this time has been well documented (Spielmann 1991), and the
role of historic Native American Plains women in providing the labor for hide processing
has been widely described (Scheiber 2005). In addition to the logistical requirements
of bison hunting, as well as the theoretical social payoffs associated with large game
hunting and the ability to share high ranked meat resources within a band (see
Chapter 1), the Toyah cultural pattern also reflects changes in terms of how social labor
roles were defined and how technological systems were organized. It is highly unlikely
that all adaptive strategies that set Toyah apart from earlier periods can be ascribed
to external or environmental circumstances alone. Rather, we see strong evidence for
numerous internal (within-group) responses as well that fundamentally changed the
ways in which fellow band members related to one another.
Whether the integration of non-local people, women in particular, into extant Toyah
populations, as seen in the San Marcos area isotope data, was part of a larger pattern
is unknown. The practice has been recorded for other Plains regions of the United
States in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (see Habicht-Mauche 2005) and could
very well have had prehistoric roots. Even if this was not a wide-spread occurrence,
significant technological changes are evident within the Zatopec assemblage that
indicate the fundamentally shifting nature of internal social relations, hypothesized as
focusing on the distinction between male and female labor roles, that occurred at this
time. Below, data from selected tool categories are assessed by time period in order to
show how some of these changes were materialized, and to provide data for formulating
hypotheses about what they meant in terms of changing rules of social organization for
Zatopec residents over time.
Selected portions of different data sets presented in earlier chapters are compared
in order to identify correlations between behavioral trends that can be used to address
aspects of the research objectives for this project. In cases where artifact counts or
recovery frequencies have been presented, those discussions, tables, or figures are
referenced but not reproduced here. The order of data presented below include data
from projectile points; bifaces; flake tools as a subset of debitage; tool expediency,
including flake tools, unifaces, and bifaces; and flake cores. Because of the comparative
nature of each of these discussions, artifact categories overlap a great deal.

417

Projectile Point Data: Bison Exploitation and Related Skill, and Logistical
versus Expedient Tool Design
The projectile point analysis presented in Chapter 7 includes assessments of various
point types for evidence of production skill. Skill was assessed according to consistent
criteria, and the resulting data illustrate different behaviors among discrete groups of
point makers and users during different time periods. In addition, data from projectile
points can be compared with data taken from flake tools to suggest the emergence of
distinct and divergent technological adaptations associated with the requirements of
hunting and processing bison.
Bison Hunting and Skill
When considering skill, comparisons were made only within typological categories;
tools of different types were not compared to determine which was more skillfully made.
Many types were represented by a small number of specimens, precluding meaningful
conclusions. Finally, given the exploratory nature of this analysis, hypotheses developed
here should be tested in future analyses on larger assemblages. Still, the production
skill evident for certain types provides a useful perspective on how different point
makers may have responded in relation to each other under different circumstances.
Specifically, points associated with periods of intense bison exploitation contrast with
those weakly associated with bison or big game hunting.
In order to work with the best available sample size, we selected Perdiz and
Castroville as point types associated with periods of big game hunting and compared the
distribution of recorded skill levels for these types against Pedernales, Ensor, Darl, and
Scallorn, the most common points not strongly associated with bison (see Figure 7-20).
Only production skill was considered; retouch skill was not taken into account (Table
11-1). Of most interest in these data is the distributions of skill assessments for each
type (see Chapter 7 for these data).

Point types not strongly associated with big game hunting exhibit a normal,
unimodal distribution of skill levels (Figure 11-1). These types have discernable peaks
in the occurrence of average skill, representative of a normal population with an
average skill level (3) with fewer instances of skill levels progressively better and worse
than the median. The distribution of skill levels exhibited by Darl points is slightly
different from that of Pedernales, Ensor, and Scallorn in that the peak for Darl points is
skill level 2, although the shape of its distribution curve is essentially the same. These
four types are characterized by unevenly distributed skill distributions, with outlying
skill level assessments that are distributed far from the average. This unevenness is
reflected by high standard deviations in the skill levels for these types, which range
from almost 2.0 to almost 4.0 (see Table 11-1).
By contrast, the skill levels of Castroville and Perdiz point types, the two types
most closely associated with bison hunting at Zatopec and elsewhere, exhibit markedly
different standard deviations, an indication of a more even distribution of skill
performance across all levels. Even though Castroville points are characterized by the
same kind of unimodal distribution as the other points, with a slight peak at skill level
3, the standard deviation for this type is actually less than for Perdiz, indicating that
Castroville point makers of all different skill levels were more evenly distributed.
In this comparison, the assessment of skill level reflected in the production of
projectile points indicates the abilities of individual knappers who made and maintained
these points in relation to other contemporary point makers. During periods in which

7-16 for these data.

419

bison hunting was not important, levels of knapper performance appear evenly
distributed in relation to a well-defined mean, which represents a cultural average for
makers of these types. We interpret these distributions to be indicative of a statistically
normal population consisting of a few poor knappers, a somewhat higher number of
average knappers, and a few better-than-average knappers. In contrast, during periods
of heavy bison focus, the distribution of skill performance does not assume this profile.
Rather, populations of point makers appear to have responded to other rules, rationales,
or motivations for making points, or were socialized in their knapping skills through
other means. As a result, skilled performance is more evenly distributed among very
poorly skilled knappers, average knappers, and very skillful knappers.
Hypothesizing why more knappers are both much better and much worse than
average is difficult through the use of point data alone. However, this issue can be
better understood by also considering data from biface production and the preparation
of some kinds of debitage (see below). Nevertheless, based on point type data only, one
hypothesis that we pursue here is that, during periods of big game focus, toolmakers
may have competed on an individual level for social status gains or prestige associated
with successful point production for use in big game hunting. Novice knappers,
competing under these conditions with skilled point makers, may have suffered from a
lack of guidance while certain high-aptitude individuals were motivated to develop their
skills even further in relation to others in return for social payoffs or rewards that came
with well-made points for use in hunting large game. As a result, among the makers of
Castroville and Perdiz point types, the worst and best makers represent 33.2 percent
and 40 percent respectively within the two groups of point makers, whereas among
makers of Pedernales, Ensor, Darl, and Scallorn points, the worst and best makers
make up 29.6 percent, 21.1 percent, 27.7 percent, and 24.9 percent, respectively.
Logistical Versus Expedient Tool Design and Technological Divergence
In addition to looking at relative performance during periods of big game hunting,
point data can be used in relation to flake tool frequency to reconstruct possible
changes in logistical versus residential movements. This analysis looks at tool design
choices involving extended utility versus expediency. As discussed in Chapter 1 and
illustrated in Chapter 7, flake tools increased in number during Toyah times. According
to discussions about what this meant for mobility, Zatopec residents are expected to
have been relatively mobile during this time, following forger subsistence patterns.
However, flake tools were also used more heavily during this period. This shows that
there are some problems with relying only on expedient tool counts rather than degrees
of actual tool expediency to reconstruct mobility or subsistence practices (see discussion
in Chapter 1).
As discussed earlier, tool-use data suggest that two distinct technological
adaptations can be defined for Toyah times. We hypothesize that these represent

420

differences between individuals engaged in hunting bison and manufacturing associated
weaponry and paraphernalia and individuals involved in bison-processing activities.
Zooarchaeological data (Chapter 9) show that, at least in Austin and Toyah periods,
bison were far better represented at Zatopec than in earlier periods. If these data are
accurate, then aspects of the technological division observed in Toyah times should also
be visible during Austin times. Point frequency data presented in Chapter 7 (see Figure
7-18) were used to suggest changes in site occupation intensity, with almost twice as
many Late Archaic II projectile points being discarded on site (12.105 per 100 years) as
were discarded in the Austin period (7 points per 100 years; these sums do not factor
excavated volume for each time period). One reason for the decrease in Austin (and
Toyah) period points being discarded on site has to do with the fact that, beginning in
the Late Prehistoric, projectile technology shifted to the bow and arrow, and projectile
tips became distinctively smaller. As a result, they were less well suited for use in other
tasks, and other tools (bifaces) became more specialized in order to meet these needs. In
earlier times, use wear studies indicate that Archaic period projectile points commonly
show patterns associated with a range of tasks (e.g., Ahler 1971), meaning that many of
the Archaic dart points in this count may represent general purpose tools whereas none
of the Late Prehistoric arrow points do. This potentially skewing factor is addressed
below. The present comparison focuses on projectile points and flake tools as indicators
of the most logistical behavior (hunting away from camp) and the most domestic or
camp-based behavior (processing various resources on-site).
Point frequency data are presented in Figure 7-18 and in raw count by time period
in Figure 7-19. The frequency figures, which are not corrected for excavated volume
since each type is distinctive to a certain time period, indicate that the site was most
heavily occupied in Late Archaic II times, although these data are probably skewed
for the reasons discussed above regarding how points were used. For evaluating tool
design goals as evident in these assemblages, since only standardized flake tool data can
be used, standardized point count data must also be employed for comparison. Those
figures are indicated in the right hand column of Table 7-15, and standardized data
for flake tool frequencies are shown in Figure 7-38; the ratios of points to flake tools
are shown in Table 11-2. Because of its small sample size, Middle Archaic data are not
included.

At least a couple of interpretations can be made from these data. First, the frequency
of flake tools, as indicated in point-to-flake tool ratios, seen in the Late Archaic I is by
far the highest for all four periods considered here, suggesting that on-site activities
figured prominently in technological decisions about tool design and use whereas offsite (logistical) hunting was relatively less important. Also, the ratios of points to flake
tools for the next three periods are relatively similar, with Late Archaic II being slightly
higher and Austin slightly lower than the Toyah ratio. However, during these three
periods, the standardized frequencies of each tool form actually increased, except for a
slight decline in points, from Late Archaic II to Austin before peaking in Toyah times.
In our view, the overall standardized increase of these tool forms is a better indication
of changes in technological organization by time, as they show that certain tasks were
being performed either more intensively by approximately the same number of people or
by more people.
Based on these data, one would expect that expediency became an important
technological choice for toolmakers as logistical activities also became important. This
conclusion appears to fit Binford’s (1980) model for a logistical collector adaptation,
in which residential sites were occupied longer (accounting for more flake tools) while
logistical hunters went out to procure critical resources (accounting for more points).
However, the suggested reconstruction of site occupation history based on radiocarbon
data contradicts this interpretation. As discussed in Chapter 5, we believe the site was
occupied more frequently over an overall shorter period of time in the Toyah period than
in preceding Late Archaic II and Austin times. The probability that both logistical and
expedient strategies for tool design were pursued simultaneously in an adaptive pattern
that cannot be characterized as either forager or collector further illustrates problems
with reconstructing technological organization by using monolithic models that
involve uniform group-level decision making. This problem is made even clearer when
considering that so-called expedient tools were actually used more intensively, even as
more of them were being made (see discussion below). Instead, we return to our earlier
hypothesis concerning a divergence in technological strategies adopted by increasingly
distinct task groups. This technological distinction becomes even more evident when
data pertaining to biface skill, flake tool usage, and flake core design are also taken into
consideration, and can be detected as early as the Late Archaic II.
Biface Frequencies, Ratios, and Knapping Behavior
Analyses were also performed on bifaces to understand technological changes over time
at Zatopec. In particular, we evaluated biface frequencies as well as changes in widthto-thickness ratios over time. Together, these data allow us not only to record shifts
toward more or less biface production, but also to recognize changes in technological
approaches to biface production having to do with skill or design that might correspond
with the perceived divergence described above. Data are compared across time (Late

422

Archaic I, Late Archaic II, Austin Phase, and Toyah phase) in an effort to identify any
trends or patterns among the analytical units.
Methods
As described in Chapter 7, bifaces that represent tool production are classified
into one of four reduction stage categories: Early Stage, Intermediate Stage, Late
Intermediate Stage, and Late Stage Preforms. (In some cases, projectile points are
included in the comparisons presented below.) Each category is evaluated by analytical
unit according to criteria described below.
The overall frequency of bifaces was standardized for each analytical unit (see
Chapter 3 for discussion of how this is done). Because of important technological
differences in the production of dart points, which often involve bifacial preforms, and
arrow points, which frequently were made on flakes, biface frequencies were compared
over time both with and without projectile points.
Once frequencies were standardized, width-to-thickness ratios (W:Th) were
calculated for bifaces within their degree of reduction. Manufacturing proportionally
wide and thin bifaces requires a greater ability to control thinning flakes, and
completing these bifaces without breaking them requires a higher level of skill than
making proportionally narrow, thick bifaces. Width and thickness measurements
were taken on all complete bifaces and also on those sufficiently intact to facilitate
measurments.. Ratios were then calculated by dividing width by thickness. Average
W:Th ratios were calculated for each analytical unit and also for each stage of reduction
within each analytical unit. Not all bifaces within each analytical unit had width and
thickness measurements, meaning that the artifact count within each analytical unit
was higher than the number of bifaces with W:Th ratios. Finally, skill assessments for
bifaces and biface fragments by time were evaluated against width-to-thickness data.
Results
Once standardized, biface counts reflected a steady increase in frequency from
Late Archaic I to Toyah (Middle Archaic was omitted because of its small sample size)
regardless of whether projectile point counts were included (Table 11-3). Data showed
that biface manufacturing increased notably from Late Archaic I to the two ensuing
periods, and then again sharply from Austin to Toyah. Three particular details in these
data warrant discussion. First, the similarity in artifact frequencies in Late Archaic
II and Austin times was stronger than what was indicated in the points-to-flake tools
(see Table 11-2) for these time periods, although both conform to the history of site
occupation indicated by radiocarbon evidence, which shows continuous occupation
across the Late Archaic II–Austin transition. Second, the continuity within the Late
Archaic II/Austin periods is even more remarkable considering that this includes the
time of transition from the use of darts propelled by atlatls to the use of the bow and

423

arrow. This significant technological innovation could be expected to coincide with
other, related shifts in tool production. However, this does not seem to have been the
case. Third, biface and point production more than doubled by time from Late Archaic
I to Late Archaic II/Austin, and biface production more than doubled again in Toyah,
indicating the increasing importance of this particular technological activity over time.

Width-to-Thickness Ratios
Not only did bifaces increase markedly in frequency over time, peaking in Toyah
deposits, but width-to-thickness ratios indicate that they also became proportionally
wider and thinner than those made in other times. If W:Th ratios indicate not only
changing perspectives about what bifaces and points should look like, but also skill
in that wider, thinner bifaces were more difficult to make, then a case can be made
that more skillful knapping is expressed in Toyah bifaces than in earlier times. This
interpretation is offered with caution, however, in light of earlier arguments against the
appropriateness of comparing knapping outcomes from one time period against those
from other periods. Still, W:Th ratios for different reduction stages by time indicate a
clear trend toward proportionally wider, thinner bifaces (Table 11-4).
When graphed, trends represented by these W:Th values are somewhat easier to
see (Figure 11-2). Not all reduction stages are present for Toyah, but otherwise most
reduction trends are strongly parallel by time period. An exception is Late Archaic II,
in which projectile points actually decreased in W:Th from late stage preforms, whereas
W:Th ratios for points in other periods increased. It is also noteworthy that most bifaces
for Late Archaic II and Austin are virtually identical in terms of W:Th. However, Toyah
points and bifaces (except early stage bifaces) were much wider and thinner than earlier
specimens. Although point dimension differences can be partially explained by the fact
that Perdiz points were commonly made on flakes rather than reduced bifaces, thereby
starting from altogether different reduction strategies, the fact that Toyah bifaces, too,
had greater width-to-thickness ratios than earlier periods is of interest. In our view, this
trend indicates something about Toyah knapper skill compared with earlier periods.

Skill
During the analysis of bifaces from Zatopec, skill was assessed by looking at
overall artifact symmetry and flaking. Skill was recorded without placing artifacts
into temporal units, and criteria were applied evenly across all bifaces regardless of
reduction stage (see Chapter 7 for discussion of how skill was assessed). In order to
evaluate skill changes over time, skill assessments for bifaces recovered from analytical
units were considered. Not all bifaces and fragments from analytical units were
complete enough to calculate W:Th ratios, so skill assessments are presented for all
specimens and for those with W:Th ratios (Table 11-5).

The skill results support the width-to-thickness data in suggesting that Toyah
biface makers as a whole were more skilled than those represented in other analytical
units. Average skill both for all bifaces and for those with W:Th ratios increased over
all earlier periods, with Late Archaic II bifaces appearing as the next-well-made group.
However, once again, Late Archaic II and Austin are highly comparable in terms of how
bifaces were made.

425

Discussion of Biface Data
Based on projectile point and biface data, Toyah knappers who made points and
bifaces appear to have increased their productivity relative to earlier periods by making
more points and bifaces (according to standardized frequencies; see Table 11-3). They
also made proportionally wider and thinner bifaces, both when points are considered
and when they are omitted from the sample (see Table 11-4, Figure 11-2). Finally,
Toyah biface-makers were more highly skilled than biface makers from earlier periods.
Concluding that Toyah biface and point makers were more highly skilled than those
of earlier time periods is potentially problematic. However, it is important to recall that
all bifaces were sorted by reduction stage and assessed for skill before being evaluated
against excavation data to see how many specimens belonged with which of the
Analytical Units. As a result, bifaces within each reduction stage were compared with
each other regardless of their temporal association, and resultant skill assessments for
each analytical unit can be used in the comparative manner described here. Results of
the analysis of bifaces from Zatopec indicate that Toyah knappers increased their biface
and point production in relation to earlier times, targeted wider and thinner bifaces,
and were probably more skilled in relation to earlier knappers.

Comparison of Debitage and Flake Tools
In Chapter 7, it was suggested that the types of flakes made and/or chosen to be used as
flake tools occurred in a pattern that was distinct from the debitage. That is, flakes were
not arbitrarily chosen for expedient use as they were struck from any given activity,
or found lying on the ground. Data were presented from multiple artifact categories
suggesting that a different approach was developed and pursued for producing bifaces
and projectile points than the one associated with making flakes suitable for use as
tools. When correlated with the final products of different tool forms, this conclusion
regarding the motivations for and approaches to flake making is significant, as it allows
analysts to develop and propose hypotheses regarding task differentiation, social role by
age or sex, and even relationships between skilled and unskilled toolmakers who were
theoretically involved in all manner of activities. Here, data are presented to illustrate
some of the approaches to making flake tools versus flakes. Discussions of patterned
use of flake tools in relation to other non-expedient tools provide further support for this
assessment.
Methods
This analysis compares complete flake tools and complete flakes from the debitage
assemblages that were discussed in Chapter 7. Measurements taken for both debitage
and flake tools include length, width, and thickness in millimeters; amount of dorsal
cortex; amount of patina; the presence of platform preparation; and the smoothness of
the platform (as measured by a single analyst). Total artifact counts are standardized
according to methods described in Chapter 3 and referred to throughout this report.
In addition to frequency, observation, and metric data, this analysis also relies on
statistical analyses using chi-square and Haberman’s residual tests.
This analysis involves comparing flakes produced as debitage against those used as
tools. In order arrive at quantified counts of distinct types of debitage, three different
flake types are recognized: biface thinning flakes, billet flakes, and non-thinning flakes.
Billet flakes are a kind of biface thinning flake and can be recognized with almost 100
percent accuracy (see Chapter 7), but the degree of precision in differentiating between
some thinning flakes and many non-thinning flakes can vary in ways that prevent
meaningful, qualitative discussion. The number of each flake type was divided by the
total number of artifacts in its assemblage for each cultural era. Since flake tools and
debitage share similar morphologies (both representing flakes), artifact counts from
both assemblages were combined, and the percentage of each flake type was calculated.
All of this information was charted for each cultural era. By using only complete nonthinning flakes, the number of non-utilized debitage is undoubtedly underrepresented.
However, analysts have no way of determining how many flakes were detached
as complete flakes but were later broken after discard through trampling or other
taphonomic agencies. Given the geomorphic history of the site and the predominantly

427

pedogenic nature of sediment buildup over time (see Chapter 4), it was felt that this was
a significant enough consideration to warrant focusing only on complete flakes.
Flake Type as Tool
Once quantified in this way and by using only complete flakes, the adjusted
frequencies of bifacial thinning flakes predominate in the debitage assemblage, whereas
non-thinning and billet flakes are similar to one another (Figure 11-3). The frequencies
with which each of these flake types was used as a tool, however, show that bifacial
thinning flakes and non-thinning flakes were both commonly selected for use as tools,
except during Austin times when regular thinning flakes were selected far more often
than non-thinning flakes. Otherwise, these two categories are almost identical in
frequency of use as tools, and both were selected far more often than billet flakes in each
period following the Late Archaic I (Figure 11-4).
Viewing the adjusted frequency with which flakes were removed and then used
as tools gives one particular insight into these decisions. However, viewing them as
percentages of the debitage considered in this comparison is also useful. When the
adjusted frequencies of flake occurrence are converted to percentages of all debitage
considered in this comparison, the trends over time become clearer. Non-thinning flakes
become less common and billet flakes become more common; thinning flakes remain
more or less constant at approximately 67–73 percent of the debitage assemblage
(Figure 11-5). It is noteworthy that the slight decrease in non-thinning flakes appears to
match the slight increase in billet flaking seen in Austin and Toyah times.

rate that billet flakes increase in Austin and Toyah .

429

In looking at how often different flake types occur as a percentage of all flake tools,
the infrequent use of billet flakes as tools remains constant over time, hovering between
8.5 and 11.5 percent of the flake tool assemblage. Biface thinning flakes are generally
the preferred flake type for use as tools, but significant changes occurred in the use of
thinning versus non-thinning flakes in Late Archaic II and Toyah times. In the Late
Archaic II and Toyah phases, the percentage of non-thinning flakes approached or
slightly exceeded the percentage of thinning flakes used as tools (Figure 11-6), whereas
in Late Archaic I and Austin, these two categories were strongly differentiated.
Understanding these changes using flake tool data alone is a challenge and not
entirely straightforward. When viewed together with trends noted for Toyah in relation
to earlier periods, however, some interpretations can be offered. For example, it has
been well established that deliberate flaking strategies and reduction sequences were
followed for many formal tools and projectile points. These kinds of flakes appear as
biface thinning flakes, including distinctive billet flakes. If flakes were selected on a
more or less random basis to be used as tools, then the adjusted counts and frequencies
of flake tools should closely mirror those of the overall debitage assemblage. However,
non-thinning flakes consistently represent a higher frequency of all flake tools than
do thinning and billet flakes in the overall flake assemblage (compare Figure 11-5 and
11-6). Furthermore, in certain time periods, such as Late Archaic II and Toyah, the use
of non-thinning flakes was notably higher, with the increase coming almost entirely at

Figure 11-6. Frequency of the use of different kinds of flakes as tools as percentages of
all flake tools. The sharp change in how biface thinning and non-thinning flakes were
used as tools in the Late Archaic II and again in Toyah times suggests that many more
flakes were removed specifically to be used as tools (non-thinning flakes) during these
periods, as opposed to available and suitable flakes being used.

430

the expense of thinning flakes. One conclusion that can be drawn from these data is
that, during these two time periods, makers and users of flake tools were increasingly
differentiated from the overall population of flake makers. In our view, these flakes were
removed with the specific goal in mind of being used as tools, rather than merely being
picked up from among the available supply of flakes that had been removed through
otherwise normal reduction activities (cf. Gero 1991, Sassaman 1992).
Cortex, Platform Smoothness, and Flake Tools
In addition to flake type, other characteristics of flake tools, such as presence and
amount of cortex, degree of platform preparation, and how billet flakes were used
provide information about technological decisions by site occupants. Debitage with 100
percent dorsal cortex was excluded from analysis since flake tools always lack some
cortex around the retouched or utilized edge. Flakes were grouped into four categories
on the basis of the amount of cortex present: 0 percent cortex, 1–33 percent cortex,
34–66 percent cortex, and 67–99 percent cortex (Figure 11-7).
Although these figures are not particularly noteworthy, the amount of dorsal cortex
present on flake tools varies dramatically, with flake tools that lack any cortex sharply
decreasing over time (Figure 11-8). In both Late Archaic II and Toyah, the percentage of
flake tools with cortex exceeds the number of tools without cortex. In the Late Archaic
II, there is a moderate increase in cortical flakes, which make up more than 55 percent
of all flake tools. In Toyah times, cortical flakes make up more than 65 percent of the

Figure 11-7. Percentage of flakes in each time period by amount of dorsal cortex. These
trend lines mirror those in Figure 11-5, frequency of flake types.

431

Figure 11-8. Percentage of flake tools with dorsal cortex by time period. Notable changes
are between flake tools with 1–33 percent cortex, which rise dramatically in Toyah times,
and flake tools with 0 percent cortex, which drop substantially at that time.

total assemblage and non-cortical flakes make up less than 35 percent. These trends
reveal shifts in how flake tool production and general flaking was carried out during
Late Archaic II and Toyah times, and parallel to some degree the findings of flake
tool type for these periods. Non-thinning flakes are used more commonly during Late
Archaic II and Toyah, and these periods also see by far the least amount of dorsal
cortex.
The degree of platform smoothness (DoS) was also selected as an indicator of
technological shifts over time. As discussed in Chapter 7, degree of smoothness can
provide evidence of knapping skill since flake detachments are often more successful
and can be more easily controlled if platforms are more extensively prepared (see
Crabtree 1972:8; also Chapter 1). Although not a direct reflection of knapper skill,
DoS is interpreted in this analysis as one indication of the degree to which knappers
understood the mechanics of flake removals and also of the amount of time individual
knappers spent on this task.
Degree of smoothness was recorded on flake platforms as described in Chapter 7;
for consistency, only a single analyst recorded this trait. Results indicate a low DoS for
a large portion of the debitage assemblage (Figure 11-9). Only a small segment of the
debitage (always < 5 percent) exhibited well-smoothed platforms. The frequencies of the
middle two degrees of smoothing (DoS 2 and 3) were similar, whereas the frequency of

432

Figure 11-9. Degrees of platform smoothness by time.

DoS 1, the least well-smoothed, declined steadily from Late Archaic II through Austin
and Toyah.
Although the practice of preparing platforms on debitage remained fairly constant
over time at Zatopec, some trends are visible and warrant discussion. The two median
DoS categories, 2 and 3, are more diffuse in the Late Archaic I than Late Archaic II
and Austin periods. Smoothness again begins to differentiate in the Toyah phase, and
indeed the overall degree to which platforms were smoothed increases (DoS 2, 3, and
4) and less well smoothed platforms (DoS 1) decrease. These data show that Toyah
knappers were spending more time smoothing platforms than in earlier periods, a trend
that began in the transition from Late Archaic II to Austin times.
Degrees of platform smoothing on flake tool are more variable than what is seen
on debitage platforms (Figure 11-10). This is easily understood if one accepts that
different kinds of flake makers were smoothing platforms in response to varying
technological perspectives about flake detachments, instead of all knappers behaving
at different levels of aptitude in response to a shared objective. Degree of smoothness
is differentiated in the Late Archaic I and Toyah phases, whereas in Late Archaic II
and Austin periods, DoS 2 and 3 are strongly similar. Indeed, in Austin times, DoS 1, 2,
and 3 are all identical or nearly so, indicating approximately two levels of performance:
most knappers smoothed their flake tool platforms to varying degrees but a very small
number spent a good deal more time on this task. However, going into Toyah times, all
degrees of smoothness become differentiated, reflecting differences in terms of how flake

433

tool makers participated in this activity. If performance variation reflects population
diversity, then one can conclude that flake-tool makers during Toyah times were
internally highly variable in relation to one another. This differentiation may indicate
larger numbers of people making these flakes, greater effort given to distinguishing
oneself through platform preparation, or some combination of these and perhaps other
factors.
For the final part of the comparison of flake tool manufacture compared with other
kinds of flakes, billet flakes separated out during the initial sorting and then compared.
As discussed in Chapter 7, billet flakes include distinctive expanding billets (DEBs)
and r flakes, both of which can be easily recognized from other thinning flakes and are
associated specifically with the production of bifaces. Given the association between
these flakes and formal tool production, an examination of how these were made and
used over time yielded perhaps the most direct information about some technological
relationships between biface makers and flake tool makers at the site.
As noted in Chapter 7, the number of billet flakes increased over time at Zatopec,
peaking sharply in the Toyah interval. This trend is linked to the need to produce
the proportionally wider and thinner bifaces commonly found in the Toyah phase. By
comparing the billet flakes from both flake tools and debitage, a distinction begins to
emerge between those who produced billet flakes and those individuals who produced

Figure 11-10. Frequency of degree of smoothness for flake tools by time. Noteworthy
is the steep increase in DoS 2 and decrease in DoS 3 in Toyah times, during which
flake toolmakers appear to have smoothed their platforms to a wide variety of degrees
compared with earlier periods.

434

expedient flakes for use as tools.
A comparison of billet flakes and billet flakes used as tools shows that both increased
over time, but at different rates (Figure 11-11). The frequency of billet flakes almost
tripled in Toyah times compared with Austin and Late Archaic II deposits. However,
their use as tools remains extremely low. Only 0.27 billet flakes-per-century were
deposited in Toyah components at Zatopec, a frequency that compares closely with the
use of these tools in earlier time periods (the Middle Archaic component is included
here, but is too small to be considered highly reliable).
The adjusted frequency data for billet flakes are compelling in that they show a
dramatic increase in the production of these flakes during Toyah times. Interestingly,
Late Archaic II and Austin billet flaking appears relatively constant, underscoring
other technological similarities between these two periods. The fact that these kinds
of specialized flakes were not used with greater frequency as expedient tools in Toyah
times despite their nearly three-fold increase marks an important distinction between
the makers of billet flakes and those who removed flakes for use as expedient tools.
This distinction is even more apparent when billet flakes, thinning flakes, and nonthinning flakes are viewed as percentages of the total flake tool assemblage (Figure
11-12). Although never very high, the percentage of all flake tools that were billet flakes
sharply declines in Toyah times, along with thinning flakes. Interestingly, billet flakes

Figure 11-11. Adjusted count (flakes-per-century) of billet flakes and billet flakes used
as tools. Both increase, but the increase in the debitage count between the Austin and
Toyah phases is statistically significant (χ2 = 104.34, d(ƒ) = 8, p < .0001, z = 6.58).

435

and non-thinning flakes were used with almost the same frequency as flake tools in
Late Archaic II, making the contrast in their frequency during Toyah times all the more
notable. As billet flake use as tools began to decline after Late Archaic II times, this
transition (Late Archaic II to Austin) might be identified as one during which important
distinctions emerged between billet flake-makers and flake makers for informal tools.
Indeed, this distinction, together with suggested behavioral changes involving projectile
points, discussed above, are some of the only technological distinctions that we see
between Late Archaic II and Austin components. The fact that thinning flakes also
begin a sharp decline in use as tools in the Austin interval helps to distinguish Toyah
flake makers (billet versus informal flake tools) as discrete task groups. Based on
these data, it is concluded that the increase in billet flake production took place largely
independent of the increase in flake tool manufacture.
Tool Design: Curation and Expediency
In addition to technological approaches to the design of flake tools, additional
comparative discussion is warranted regarding the intensity with which different
kinds of tools were used. Use intensity data complement the discussion of tool design
by providing an additional perspective on the technological distinction between biface
makers and users and flake tool makers and users that is hypothesized to have emerged

436

during Toyah times. This discussion draws from the earlier definition of technology
that includes consideration not only of how tools are designed and maintained, but also
of how they are used as a reflection of socially conditioned individuals (see Chapter
1). Below, discussions compare use intensity in the manner that was developed for
assessing realized versus potential utility (expediency versus curation), presented
in Chapter 7. Additional comparisons are developed and statistically verified to
demonstrate distinctions in how these two tool forms were used over time.
When the scoring system for the Expedient to Maintainable/Reliable (E:M/R)
ratio was developed, it was decided that a bridge was needed from highly expedient
flake tools to highly maintainable or reliable bifacial tools. Unifaces were chosen to
fill this gap, since the most heavily utilized and modified flake tools essentially grade
into unifaces, and the most formally designed unifaces almost certainly required
more manufacturing time and effort than many early stage or quickly crafted bifaces.
In terms of manufacturing effort, the categories are defined by replicable criteria
and represent a continuum of manufacturing input with the ostensible objective of
increasing potential utility, either through actual use and resharpening, or through
later utility as additional flakes suitable for use are removed. Within each tool category,
no limits on variation or intensity of use are implied or recognized.
Using unifaces as an example (Figure 11-13), some Zatopec tool categories show a
wide range in terms of realized utility, indicated by higher E:M/R ratios (see Chapter
7 for how these are calculated). Looking at the E:M/R ratios for all tools included in
the Zatopec sample (Figure 11-14), artifacts approach or overlap scores of neighboring
groups in ways that reflect a continuum of tool design decision-making. The result is a
scale that covers the range from the most expedient to the most maintainable without
any significant gaps, but within which individual trends can be defined.
The E:M/R scale was also used to analyze tool functionality and design goals within
a single artifact category from one time period to another (see Chapters 1 and 7). Here,
we focus on comparisons between flake tools, which theoretically represent the tool
kit for most tasks taking place in and around domestic camp sites, and bifaces, which
include labor-intensive tools designed for prolonged use. Although these tools could have
been used in camps, they were also transported from site to site, whereas flake tools
were commonly left behind. Bifaces therefore represent curation as a design goal that
would theoretically have been pursued by individuals who were members of logistical
task groups conducting their work far from camp. The uniface sample is considered
too small to be useful for this comparison. Like earlier comparisons between flake tool
design and use intensity, here we focus on behavioral changes over time.
Using the sample of flake tools presented in Chapter 7 (see Table 7-26), flake tools
show distinct increases in the mean E:M/R ratio in certain time periods (Figure 1115). As explained above, scores represent intensity of use, and consider resharpening

438

if it can be discerned. During Late Archaic II, tool use was more intensive than in the
earlier or later period, although some tools remain truly expedient, with a score of 0.
This period is one of moderate bison exploitation at Zatopec (Chapters 5 and 7). A slight
decrease in curation during Austin times is followed by a peak in Toyah tool use. The
Toyah increase is marked by no tools that are fully expedient (having a score of zero),
as well as the highest average E:M/R ratio. These data indicate a notable change in how
flake tools are used, with increasing use and prolonged utility clearly demonstrated in
certain time periods. These data complement the TEM:PEM ratio presented in Chapter
7 in showing increasing intensity of flake tool use (TEM:PEM is included in how the
E:M/R ratio is calculated), but allow these tools to be directly compared with bifacial tool
use.
When compared with flake tools, the use intensity for bifaces changes only gradually
over time, with their E:M/R score steadily but slightly increasing (Figure 11-16). This
sample includes 125 artifacts from the Late Archaic I (n = 23), Late Archaic II (n =
58), Austin (n = 21) and Toyah (n = 25). The lack of significant increase over time

low scores for artifacts within each time period. Sample includes 458 flake tools from
LA I (n = 61), LA II (n = 227), Austin (n = 99), and Toyah (n = 71) periods (see Table
7-26).

439

Figure 11-16. Average E:M/R ratios for bifaces by time, showing decrease in use
variation and overall minor increase in use intensity.

indicates that, traditionally, bifacial tools had design goals of maintainability rather
than expediency. However, the range of E:M/R ratios within each time period steadily
declines from the Late Archaic II to Toyah. This notable decrease in variation indicates
differences in how bifacial tools are used in each cultural era, even though use intensity
remained fairly constant. In other words, from Late Archaic II to Toyah, bifaces were
used in increasingly narrow ranges of intensity. Another way to view these data is to
suggest that Toyah bifaces were used in an increasingly standardized way compared
with earlier time periods. These data support the notion of a standardized tool kit that
has been proposed elsewhere for the Toyah phase (Tomka 2001).
In order to quantify the strength of these trends, a one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) test was performed. In simple terms, ANOVA is a method of comparing the
means of different groups by measuring whether there is more variance among groups
than within groups (Caldwell 2007). The procedure calculates the F ratio, a statistic
indicating the ratio of variation within groups to among groups. As the F ratio increases
in size, a large difference among groups becomes more likely (Figure 11-17).
ANOVA only determines whether or not various means are comparable. If the F
ratio is considered statistically significant, a post-hoc test is necessary to determine
what factor produced the significant result. For this analysis, Tukey’s Honestly
Significant Difference (or HSD) test is used to calculate a Q statistic (Figure 11-18).

The Q statistic is a pair-by-pair comparison of the different means. Since there are four
groups in this analysis (one for each time period), the Q statistic was calculated six
times in order to compare all the means (Late Archaic I to Late Archaic II; Late Archaic
I to Austin; Late Archaic I to Toyah; Late Archaic II to Austin; Late Archaic II to
Toyah; and Austin to Toyah). Using these two statistical measures, the move away from
expediency in the Toyah phase is determined to be a statistically significant change
from previous eras (Table 11-6). These statistics establish that curation became much
more prominent during the Toyah phase.

Discussion
This analysis of tool use intensity was designed to identify trends in the
design goals in the artifact assemblage from each cultural era. It shows that each
cultural era produced individual tools along the full range of design goals, but that
expediency decreased dramatically in the Toyah phase, particularly among flake tools.
Interestingly, expediency as a design goal remained approximately the same, relatively
low, for bifacial tools as for earlier periods, showing only a slight decrease. During the
Toyah phase, bifacial tools remain highly maintainable in comparison with other tool
types, but flake tools were more often exhausted before discard. These data confirm the
tool category-specific TEM:PEM ratios and the overall increase in flake tool frequency,
both presented in Chapter 7, and indicate just how much more labor was represented
in the Toyah flake tool assemblage compared with earlier periods. Combined with
technological data about tool design, including even the increase in previously
discarded, patinated flakes being used as tools in Toyah times, these findings have very
real and dramatic implications for the people who were responsible for making and
using flake tools during Toyah occupations of the site. These data, verified by ANOVA
and Tukey’s HSD statistical analyses, indicate highly significant shifts in terms of how
tools were used in Toyah times compared with earlier periods.
Technological Changes in Flake Cores over Time
The final comparison in this section evaluates changes in flake core design and use over
time. A total of 103 flake cores, core fragments, and maintenance debris were recovered
from analytical units and are presented according to their technological variation in
Chapter 7. Cores were measured for length, width, thickness, and weighed, and counts
are compared across time (Late Archaic I, Late Archaic II, Austin Phase, and Toyah
phase) in an effort to identify any trends or patterns among the analytical units. Only
one core was recovered from confirmed Middle Archaic (AU 3) deposits (measuring
36.55mm long by 28.93 mm wide by 16.37 mm thick and weighing 15 g), and this
period is omitted from further consideration because of its small sample. Discussions
below involve the remaining 102 artifacts. Cores not found in controlled temporal
contexts were not measured or classified, as the trends evident in those data would not
inform about changes that occurred in flake core-related technological behavior over
time. Regarding metric data for flake cores, it should be noted that these calculations
represent only the general size of the core when it was discarded. No attempt was made
to correlate the size of flake scars evident on cores with observed or measured trends in
flake tools. In addition, it is impossible to know the original size of any flake core before
it was reduced.
After flake cores were sorted into their respective categories, their counts were
standardized by analytical unit (see Chapter 3) and average dimensions were calculated

442

for each time period. Not all core types were standardized. Tested cobbles were not
included in the standardization since these represent the earliest stages of nodule
reduction and rarely reflect distinct technological strategies that might indicate
behavioral changes over time. Only one burinated core and one recycled bifacial core
were recovered from controlled context; these, too, were excluded. Finally, multiple
pieces of core maintenance debris can result from as few as only a single flake core,
making it impossible to quantify strategies of maintenance over time. This category
is accordingly omitted from the discussion of flake core trends over time. This leaves
the discussion of behavior relating to flake core by time limited to unidirectional,
multidirectional, discoidal (Types A and B), and ad hoc cores.
Standardized counts of flake cores (Table 11-7) mirror trends noted for biface
manufacturing (see Table 11-3). Flake core frequencies increased from Late Archaic I
to the following period, and then remained relatively consistent from Late Archaic II
through the Austin phase, suggesting some aspects of technological continuity between
these periods. Standardized recovery data show that flake cores increase sharply during
the Toyah phase. This increased production may partially explain the increased number
of flake tools recovered during this period (see above).

After counts were standardized, length, width, and thickness (Figure 11-19) and
weight (Figure 11-20) measurements are averaged for each time period. These data
show that overall core size, no matter how recorded, was smallest in Austin times and
largest in Toyah times (with the exception of width, which was greatest in Late Archaic
II). Interestingly, this aspect of flake core data parallels the dimensions recorded on
flake tools, which are smallest in Austin-phase deposits (see Figure 7-47). The overall
size increase of Toyah flake cores suggests that more flakes could (potentially) have
been struck from them, providing yet another indication of the sharp increase in flake
tool production and use during this time.
In addition to the overall standardized frequencies of flake cores, looking at changes
in the relative frequency of different core types provides important information about
shifts in technological approaches to core design and maintenance through time (Table

443

11-8). Admittedly, the samples used to generate these numbers are not as robust as
would be considered ideal, yet they suggest trends regarding how different cores were
designed and how these approaches changed by time period. These figures indicate
that unidirectional and multidirectional cores increase sharply in Toyah times (Figure
11-21). All other core types, with the exception of Type A Discoidal (those rotated more
than 180 degrees), which decreases sharply, also increase in Toyah, though much less
dramatically than unidirectional and multidirectional.

Trends in flake core data over time indicate distinct changes in preference for
some kinds of flake cores over others, with notable changes seen in particular in the
frequency of multidirectional cores. It is difficult to distinguish what these trends mean
with respect to technological choices of prehistoric site occupants, however, because of
the number of flake core categories involved. For example, only Type A discoidal cores
descrease in Toyah, whereas all other kinds increase, indicating only that core rotation
was not as fully developed as in earlier times.
For ease of comparison and in order to understand technological decisions made by
flake tool makers that might have differentiated them from other kinds of toolmakers
at the site, we wanted to understand how core production strategies are compared
with biface production at the site. This requires condensing the many core categories
into a smaller number reflecting technological approaches similar to those required

Figure 11-21. Standardized recoveries of flake core types (in cores per 100 years) by
analytical unit.

445

in biface production. For this comparison, we combined ad hoc, unidirectional, and
multidirectional cores as non-bifacial (see description of these types in Chapter 7)
and characterized Types A and B Discoidal as bifacial approaches to establishing and
maintaining core platform edges and active faces. Here, discoidal cores are considered
technologically bifacial because opposing core faces were reduced in tandem; flake
removals from one face determined removals from the opposing face by helping to
establish striking platforms. Discoidal cores therefore have strong similarities to bifaces,
and contrast with other core types in which removals from a face had implications for
but did not necessarily predetermine removals from the opposing face. An additional
difference between these types involves how they were rotated as flakes were removed;
core rotational patterns were described in Chapter 7. In our view, these technological
distinctions are important since they indicate how these object pieces were viewed,
envisioned, and understood by prehistoric knappers. We do not imply that biface makers
were incapable of comprehending non-bifacial approaches to core reduction or vice
versa; we only explore whether two distinct technological approaches can be identified
in the flake core data.
Results show that these two general approaches to flake core design parallel each
other fairly closely through Late Archaic I and II and Austin times, with bifacial
(discoidal) cores remaining slighly less frequent than non-bifacial cores (Figure 11-22).
However, with Toyah, these trends diverge sharply, and non-bifacial cores increase
dramatically while bifacials cores decline. These data strongly suggest that, during
Toyah, flake core makers sharply modified their approaches to making flake cores and
keeping them in use.

Conclusions
A considerable amount of technological and metric variation is demonstrated among
flake cores at Zatopec, complicating technological classification and comparative
analysis. Trends illustrate preferences for particular size ranges for certain times that
cannot be explained with currently available data and that should be confirmed by
research elsewhere. One example is the apparent preference for small cores during
Austin; we do not offer an interpretation for this trend, but note that it corresponds
with flake tool dimensions as well, and suggest that future analysis may help provide
explanations for this phenomenon. Another significant trend is for larger cores
during Toyah times. This fact provides yet additional support for what appears in
other respects as an overall increase in flake tool production at this time, with larger
cores at least having the potential to produce more (and/or larger) flakes. Greater
flake production from more and larger cores thereby adds to what we document as
substantially increasing flake tool use intensity during this period (see discussion of
flake tools, above).
With behavioral comparisons in mind, however, it is no less significant that
technological approaches to designing and maintaining flake cores also show sharp
divergence in Toyah times compared with all earlier periods. Late Archaic I and II
as well as Austin components are characterized by approximately parallel changes
in frequency of bifacial and non-bifacial cores, with non-bifacial cores slightly more
common than discoidal ones in all periods. However, bifacial cores diminish mildly
in Toyah whereas non-bifacial cores show a dramatic, more than four-fold increase.
Indeed, based on our findings, Toyah flake cores at Zatopec can be characterized as
mostly (though not completely) non-bifacial in approach, with multidirectional and
unidirectional cores predominating during this period and other types remaining
relatively infrequent. To us, this trend underscores distinctions that emerged among
toolmakers at Zatopec, with flake core makers opting increasingly for non-bifacial
approaches to establishing and maintaining productive platforms and core faces. This
conclusion substantiates the analysis of debitage, and also of the frequencies with which
certain kinds of flakes were used over others, presented above.

Conclusions
Jon C. Lohse

The Zatopec site, 41HY163, located close to the banks of Purgatory Creek in
southwestern Hays County, is a multicomponent campsite that was visited recurrently
by mobile hunter-gatherers over approximately 8,000 years. Investigated by several
archaeological field schools in the 1980s, the site was excavated by the Center for
Archaeological Studies in 2007–2008 as part of a construction-related mitigation
program for the extension of Wonder World Drive by the City of San Marcos. After
fieldwork was completed, artifacts and samples collected by the field schools and CAS
excavations were analyzed. This report has described and discussed the results of those
excavations and analyses.
Site occupation began near the end of the Late Paleoindian period, and extended
throughout the Archaic into the Late Prehistoric, and even into the early Spanish
colonial period. However, because of extensive erosion sometime after ca. 5,000 years
ago, very few sediment deposits remain from the earliest periods and since then the
site structure came to consist primarily of anthropogenic deposits, with little natural
sedimentation. Consequently, the earliest components were found to be frequently
intermixed with later materials, and all components showed some degree of natural
and/or cultural disturbance. As a result of the compromised stratigraphic separation
of components, little can be said about the Early Archaic, most of the Middle Archaic,
and large portions of the Late Archaic and even Late Prehistoric remains. In response
to these problems of stratigraphic integrity, analysts exercised extreme care to define
and separate isolable components that, based on all available stratigraphic and dating
information, were unmixed or relatively unmixed. This approach has reduced the
sample of temporally-controlled remains to less than approximately 25 percent of the
total assemblage. The analyses reported here focus on this small sample.

448

Despite problems with the stratigraphic integrity of some parts of the site,
investigations at Zatopec have been able, through the application of four overarching
research domains delineated at the outset of fieldwork and the concomitant
methodologies adapted to the analytical requirements of the project, to convey a detailed
perspective on prehistoric cultural adaptations in the south Central Texas region. This
chapter discusses the most significant interpretations derived from the investigations
within the context of these research domains, particularly in terms of how they
contribute to ongoing investigations into hunter-gatherer adaptations of the later
prehistoric periods in the Central Texas cultural chronology. The first research domain,
understanding formation and geologic landform accretion processes as they influence
the stratigraphic relationship of key site components, is not discussed here. Instead,
readers are referred to Chapter 4 along with our observations that the development
of models for understanding the depositional context of cultural remains has proven
essential at Zatopec, and that similar efforts should be equally relevant to in-depth
analyses at other prehistoric sites in the region.
The results of this research reflect three fundamental approaches that shaped all
of our efforts. First, the record of cultural activity at Zatopec was viewed as a process;
emphasis was given throughout the analysis to identifying and interpreting changes
from one time period to the next. Second, and related to the first approach, this analysis
is comparative in nature at a basic level. Not only are time-controlled components
compared with and contrasted against one another to detect behavioral shifts from
Late Archaic I through Late Archaic II, Austin, and Toyah times, but aspects of each
component are compared to illustrate key trends and patterns within each period.
Finally, we understand the causes that produced many of the changes described
here to be both external to the groups of people who occupied the site (e.g., climate,
environment, resource availability) and internal to their sociocultural systems (e.g.,
individual aptitude and motivation, negotiated social labor roles, enculturation and
patterns of skill acquisition).
Summary of Findings and Conclusions
Below, each research domain (except for the first) is summarized. Significant
conclusions from these analyses are highlighted, and directions for future research are
suggested.
Research Domain 2: the Residential Character of Hunter-Gatherer Camps and
Aggregation Cycles
Cycles of aggregation and dispersion define almost all residentially mobile
prehistoric and contemporary hunter-gatherer societies (e.g., Lee 1979). These cycles
depend largely on the seasonal availability of foodstuffs and the number of people
in local bands. As multiple local bands come together, food requirements increase,

449

meaning that the times and places of aggregation are defined by resource abundance.
As resources are depleted, macrobands hive off into smaller units, sometimes nuclear
families, to fend largely for themselves until the next cycle of aggregation. More than
simply a response to limited resources and the relative lack of ability to generate
food surpluses, however, aggregation cycles also regulate important social activities
such as the exchange of information and marriage partners, performance of seasonal
rituals, and trade. Expanding on earlier studies on aggregation, we present a model for
the seasonal coalescence of certain specialized task groups, and for the emergence of
contexts best suited for imparting technical skills and knowledge to younger members of
the social group. This model, which considers social aspects of hunter-gatherer economic
organization, helps to fill a gap between studies focusing on the subsistence implications
of aggregation and those emphasizing ritual, mate exchange, trade, and gender roles.
For example, partly in relation to how labor is pooled by age and sex, and partly in
relation to the strong domestic character of aggregation sites, Conkey (1991) defined
aggregation cycles and places as contexts where strongly gendered behavior and roles
are most likely to emerge. Distinctions not just by sex but also by age are basic to the
definition of social labor and learning roles of hunter-gatherer bands (see Ingold 1999).
When they can be identified, aggregation locales represent ideal archaeological contexts
in which to consider many of these processes. In addition, given that prehistoric
aggregation sites existed in greater Central Texas, the recognition of the existence and
character of these sites is an important step in constructing place-specific archaeological
narratives of the prehistoric record of the region.
Aggregation sites have been widely described and defined in ethnographic and
archaeological literature (see Chapter 1), and the strongly residential character of
the Zatopec site has been previously recognized by Garber (1987). However, as Shott
(2004) has pointed out, aggregation of hunter-gatherer groups would have occurred
at various spatial and temporal scales, meaning that archaeologists must exercise
caution in identifying particular locales as aggregation sites. Aggregation should more
accurately be understood as a process, potentially occurring at different kinds and sizes
of sites, than as one type of site per se. Nevertheless, many of the criteria associated
with aggregation are present at Zatopec. It may be important to note, however, that
this evidence appears to change over time, suggesting that the defining elements of a
residential base camp may have also been mutable.
One of the best lines of evidence in the identification of Zatopec as an aggregation
locale of moderate size is the data set that includes three burials recovered from the
southern part of the site. Consistency of spatial patterning in important features and
activity areas (Trait 3) , one of the nine traits used to identify aggregation sites (see
Chapter 1), is clearly reflected in the spatial relationship of these burials. Burials 1
and 3, dated to 1300 ± 20 and 1305 ± 20 B.P. (A.D. 662–732 and 739–771, and 660–722
and 740–770), respectively, are almost identical in age, and were interred toward the

450

very end of the Late Archaic II period (as defined in this project). Burial 2, by contrast,
was dated approximately 100 years younger, at 1215 ± 20 B.P. (A.D. 720–742 and
769–884). However, Burial 2 was interred within the same burial feature and directly
on top of Burial 3. Many of the skeletal elements of Burials 2 and 3 were intermixed to
the extent that made it necessary to excavate both as a single lot (1193; see Chapter 5).
On the basis of the dating results, Burials 1 and 3 were interred at approximately the
same time, but probably in two separate events since they occupied two separate grave
depressions. Approximately 100 years later the site was reoccupied by a group who had
retained the memory of this burial location. The latter group reopened the earlier grave
depression of Burial 3, so that Burial 2 could be interred. It seems significant that these
events perfectly span the proposed distinction between Late Archaic II and Austin times
in regional chronology, since this burial sequence indicates strong cultural continuity
between these two archaeological time periods.
Additional evidence for site area reuse over time comes from overlapping hearths,
Features 07-2 and 07-3 that were excavated in Unit N1033 E1002 (Figures 5-13 and
5-14). Although not clearly dated, these features are believed to be of Late Archaic
II age based on the recovery of an Ensor point in Feature 07-1, only one meter to the
east (see Chapter 5), although they could also date to Late Archaic I. These features
establish a sequence of events involving the ongoing, continual reuse of parts of the
site that resulted in the formation of the scatters of fire-cracked rock that are strewed
about the area. Other elements and features in this sequence include Feature 07-4, an
ephemeral pit into a thin midden in the northwest part of the site and dated by two
assays to A.D. 880–1030 (see Table 5-2), as well as the midden south of the overlapping
hearths (in unit N1028 E1005). The second midden, which is clearly inverted based on
reversed dates (1990 ± 40 B.P. from the top and 1180 B.P. ± 40 from the bottom; see
Table 5-2) represents the redeposited remains of ongoing feature maintenance and the
recycling and discard of limestone rocks as they fractured into smaller and smaller
fragments through repeated exposure to extreme heat (see Leach and Bousman 2001).
The lower date from this midden, 1180 B.P. ± 40 (A.D. 720–740 and 770–970), makes
it almost the same age as the earlier two burials. In considering these feature data
together, evidence of continuity is seen in (1) the construction of rock-lined cooking
or heating features, a process that generated fire-cracked rock abundantly scattered
around the site; (2) later, the designation of a location for burying group members; (3)
the continuing use of other parts of the site for midden-forming activities while at the
same time keeping the burial area cleared of midden deposits; (4) the return of site
occupants to reopen the burial area to inter another individual; and (5) the ongoing
intermittent site occupations involving continued activities that resulted in yet more
midden disturbance and formation.
This long sequence of activities that helps define Late Archaic I–Austin occupations
reflects strong continuity in horizontal patterning, even if the vertical nature of

451

these deposits is not clearly stratified. This event sequence, in and of itself, suggests
continuity of cultural practices, implying population continuity as well and is relevant
to another trait associated with aggregation, larger group size than that found at
short-term camps (Trait 1). Along with larger groups, Conkey (1980) predicted that a
greater diversity of activities will be conducted at aggregation sites (Trait 5). Although
no analyses directly assess group size or the diversity of activities, the overall intensity
of site occupation at Zatopec is believed to have steadily increased from Late Archaic
I through Austin times, as indicated by projectile point recovery (Figure 7-18) and
the radiocarbon data for patterned occupation events (Figure 5-12). Indeed, the Late
Archaic II–Austin period(s) offer the strongest evidence for occupation intensity and
cultural continuity, observed not only in the reuse of burial areas at the site throughout
this interval but also in technological trends including rates of tool production and
patterns of tool use.
If Zatopec was an aggregation locale of moderate scale in the Late Archaic into the
early part of the Late Prehistoric (Austin) period, how can we understand its Toyah
component in relation to the aggregation issue? First, radiocarbon data suggest shorter
intervals between occupation events (Figure 5-13), from approximately one visit per
100 years to one per 50 years. Texas archaeology needs additional research using
radiocarbon and other data to reconstruct site occupation histories, and it is hoped
that the hypothesized reconstruction offered here can be tested by such research in the
future. Based on available data, regional inhabitants appear to have been changing
their patterns of settlement mobility. Mauldin et al. (2010) in noting this trend have
suggested the changes were a logistical response to increasingly unpredictable bison
herds. Second, overall tool production increased markedly in Toyah times, if not in
projectile points (which decline slightly from Austin, 7.0 to 6.67 per century), then in
bifaces, flake tools, blades, and flake cores (Table 12-1). A gradual increase in these
categories could be explained simply by a population increase — more people living
on-site and participating in related activities. However, the increases in tool frequency
range from approximately 25 percent to 110 percent, and are considered significant
enough to indicate a more fundamental shift in how the site was used in this period.
Table 12-1. Standardized rates of discard for artifact types per century from Zatopec.
Changes from Austin to Toyah arguably do not reflect the continual, gradual increase
in production and discard, but rather a qualitative shift in how the site was used. These
data are presented in detail elsewhere, but are summarized here to illustrate this point.

Not only did tool production increase sharply at this time, but so too did intensity
of tool use. Although this discussion involves much of the technological data necessary
for understanding the fourth research domain (see below), they are included here as
supporting evidence for the hypothesized change in the nature of site use in Toyah
times. The intensity with which certain tasks were being carried out is assessed in
several ways in this study, including tallying the overall frequency of tools and debitage;
calculating ratios between certain tool categories; noting the percentage of debitage
used as tools and the increasing preference for curated versus expedient tools, no matter
how formal their technological design. Even the greater frequency with which some
Toyah peoples scavenged flakes from the surface for use as tools reflects this change,
indicated by patinated-but-flaked-through flake tool frequencies of 2.61 percent in Late
Archaic II, 2.13 percent in Austin, and 7.69 percent in Toyah (see Figure 7-45).
Together, these analyses indicate that time spent at the site in the Toyah period
involved a steeply increasing work load, at least for some group members. Looking
specifically at flake tools, these became larger, more numerous, were more frequently
used to exhaustion, and were gleaned more regularly from the surface as if production
of these implements was less able to meet the increased demand for them. Comments
regarding how labor is organized and shared in aggregation cycles (Conkey 1980; Lee
1979; see Chapter 1) indicate the task groups coalesce and individuals often work
harder though more periodically, thereby ensuring greater resource variety, quantity,
and reliability. However, if pooled labor and periodic increases in effort are the norm for
aggregation sites, then the differences between Late Archaic II/Austin and Toyah tool
use patterns not only seems to reflect an exponential increase in the amount of labor
that was being expended, but, more specifically, labor expended mostly by certain task
groups. As discussed below, this pattern, which suggests increasingly sharp divisions of
labor by sex role, is interpreted as part of a larger shift in labor at the site during this
period.
Although we argue that Zatopec was the location of some form of aggregation
in earlier times, including at least the Late Archaic II and Austin periods, if not
the earlier Late Archaic I, its role in aggregation/dispersion cycles in Toyah times
remains unclear. Based on the comparative analyses presented here, the identification
of Toyah aggregation sites will probably be easier for Texas archaeologists if they
work backwards from available historic accounts describing the nature, location, and
seasonality of Native American aggregations, and extend their analysis back to both
late and early Toyah sites (e.g., Arnn 2008; Black et al. 1997; Henderson 2001; Johnson
1994; Karbula et al. 2001; Ricklis and Collins 1994). In any event, it is hoped that the
distinct transitions noted here may provide useful comparative benchmarks for future
studies of this issue.

453

Research Domain 3: Prey Selection and Resource Exploitation
Initially, the goal of this research theme was to reconstruct past environmental
conditions and patterns of resource exploitation at the site during periods of occupation.
Some aspects of the analyses address previous environmental conditions, if only to a
limited degree. For example, the analysis by Cummings and Yost of pollen from sample
1156-17, collected from inside bone cavities of Burial 1 (Chapter 10) and thereby
associated with Late Archaic II/Austin, describes taxa that are characteristic of an
open habitat near a wetland or spring. Phytoliths from this sample are from plants
that thrive during cooler, wetter portions of the year (e.g., fall, winter, spring) but also
in riparian zones where moist conditions are present year-round. Together, these data
sets indicate moderately mesic (moist) climatic conditions, although the sample may be
biased somewhat by the site’s proximity to Purgatory Creek, which presumably flowed
in prehistoric times. Freshwater sponge spicules in the sample further support the
proximity to a freshwater source. An estimate of season of occupation is derived from
the identification in the faunal assemblage of juvenile whitetail deer bones (Chapter 9),
the presence of which is consistent with late fall to early winter occupation. However,
beyond these assessments, organic preservation at the site was not adequate for
detailed paleoenvironmental reconstructions.
Consequently, attention was given to how the utilization of different animal
resources by the site’s inhabitants over time reflect both resource availability and also
shifting decisions about dedicating time to the pursuit of large, medium, and/or small
game. The ultimate objective of these analyses is not only to reconstruct these patterns
over time, but also to use these data to explore behavioral decisions about how food was
shared, how subsistence labor may have been organized, and to provide a context for
interpreting local technological shifts associated with relative emphases on pursuit of
large versus small game.
The reconstruction of site-specific and regional patterns of resource exploitation by
prey size presented by Sichler et al. (Chapter 10) is heavily influenced by taphonomic
factors that degraded the preservation of some elements over time, leaving them less
easily identified and undoubtedly obscuring some important data. In addition, many
elements were processed in ways that left them unidentifiable; large bone fragments
were commonly processed down to unrecognizable fragments as part of the grease- and
marrow-extraction process (e.g., Quigg 1998). A review of regional sites indicates that
different processing stages took place at different sites, meaning that any particular
site pattern might not conform with or represent overall regional patterns for any given
time period. For this reason, regional data were compiled to contextualize Zatopec’s
faunal record, although discussions of how labor may have been organized at this site
depend solely on the Zatopec record. Finally, recognizing the presence or abundance of
any particular prey type in multi-component, open-air campsites like Zatopec depends
heavily on stratigraphic integrity, which at this site was less than ideal. As a result,

454

bison presence and abundance at Zatopec are calculated in two different ways, by the
recognition of element in each analytical unit, and by direct radiocarbon dating of
collagen from bison bones. The results of these two analytical methods are somewhat
contradictory in terms of defining periods of reliance on bison, and are discussed below.
Looking at local (site-specific) patterns of prey selection, some trends are evident.
First, deer and pronghorn antelope, classified as medium-sized game, dominate the Late
Archaic I and II assemblages although they decline from 65.49 percent to 44.91 percent
of the classifiable fauna from these time periods (see Figure 9-2). Small animals, which
include birds, turtles, rodents, and other small-sized mammals, increase in frequency
during this time from 13.82 percent to 24.97 percent of the classifiable assemblage.
Bison increases as well, from 20.69 percent to 30.12 percent. If the labor of women
and others who would have been less able to travel far from camp to procure game is
represented by the small prey category, then their protein contributions to group diet
increased significantly from Late Archaic I to Late Archaic II. At this same time, bison
hunting, arguably a high-risk, high-reward logistical activity that cross-culturally is
performed almost exclusively by males (see Chapter 1 discussion, including Figure
1-7), also increased. These data indicate that the increased reliance on both small
animals and bison was accompanied by a decreased reliance on deer and antelope. The
popularity of bison hunting increased still more during the Late Prehistoric, with the
relative percentage of bison to all classifiable fauna rising to 57.14 percent in Austin
and to 60.04 percent in Toyah times. In contrast, small animals dropped to their lowest
relative frequencies, just over 13 percent in Austin to 4.97 percent percent in Toyah
times. Artiodactyls, including deer and antelope, remain constant during the Late
Prehistoric, between 29 percent and 35 percent.
Although technological data indicate that the dramatic shift in tool design and use
occured between Austin and Toyah times, rather than between Late Archaic II and
Austin, this dramatic increase in bison and decrease in small-sized prey at Zatopec
provides the context needed to understand the technological decisions that followed.
Along with more big game and, perhaps more importantly, fewer small game, lithic
production shifted to reflect the increasing need for tools to use for processing tasks (see
above discussion of intensity of tool use). Furthermore, to the degree that procuring
animals of different body sizes reflects gendered roles, with large game a primarily male
domain and trapping and gathering small game relatively ungendered, then Toyah
times represent by far the most gender-exclusive context for protein procurement in
the entire history of Zatopec. Hypothesizing just how dichotomous this social context
for gendered labor was depends on how one accepts available cross-cultural analogous
data as a reflection of the strength of participation by men and women in these tasks.
Although trapping small animals appears as a mostly male pursuit, gathering small
land fauna is performed almost equally by males and females (see Figure 1-7). Hunting
large terrestrial fauna, however, remains almost exclusively a male activity. Using

455

these cross-cultural patterns to interpret Zatopec’s faunal record leads to the hypothesis
that no more than 4.97 percent of the meat protein procured, processed, and consumed
at Zatopec was provided by women, whereas the rest, 95.03 percent, was the domain of
men’s work. Although vegetable foods (which are associated cross-culturally even more
strongly with women than big game hunting is with men) are unaccounted for in the
present analysis even though they are known to have been important in Toyah times
(see Dering 2008; Karbula et al. 2001), this conclusion potentially characterizes the
sharp division of labor that defined at least some Toyah sites.
The trends noted at Zatopec are comparable to those seen across the region. Early
Archaic assemblages (not available from Zatopec), reflect the highest diversity of prey
types, including percentage of small prey, of all times periods represented (see Figure
9-10). By the Late Archaic, exploitation of deer and antelope becomes common, but bison
reappear in the region and gradually increase in frequency. Significantly, bison are
much more abundant on some sites than others, indicating site-level activity patterns
that seem to carry forward into the Late Prehistoric. When factoring geophyte (starchy
tubers) data into the analysis, some Late Prehistoric sites appear to have been occupied
by logistical collector groups involved in procuring and processing bison whereas other
sites reflect localized forager adaptations. The regional result is a broad spectrum diet
that by Toyah times suggests sharply delineated task groups that may correlate with
age- and sex-based social statuses.
A note is warranted here concerning how bison are recognized in site assemblages.
In most cases, including the present study, the relative frequency of bison remains
is calculated after occupation zones (analytical units in the current report) are
reconstructed and ordered by time using direct dating or associated temporally
diagnostic artifacts. The accuracy of these models (e.g., Dillehay 1974; Huebner 1991;
Mauldin et al. 2010) depends therefore on the stratigraphic integrity of the deposits
under consideration and on the accuracy and precision with which they are dated. At
Zatopec, the results indicate a heavy reliance on bison in Austin times, a conclusion
that cannot be verified in the regional comparison undertaken here, since Austinage components were not distinguished from general Late Prehistoric ones in any
of the studies we used (see Figure 9-10). An alternative approach to reconstructing
bison presence involves directly dating collagen extracted from bone samples.
Certain reliability problems plagued early bone collagen radiocarbon dates, including
the difficulty in extracting carbon atoms that are indigenous to the sample, that
demonstrably do not include exogenous carbon, and that are sufficient in quantity and
state of preservation (Hedges and Van Klinken 1992:279). Many of these problems
have been resolved to some degree by recent improvements in direct dating associated
with the application of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) techniques that isolate
individual amino acids from collagenous bones and allow contaminates to be identified
and removed (Stafford et al. 1991).

456

Unfortunately, very few direct bison bone dates have been run in the study region
that are available for comparison. A review of extant literature identifies approximately
26 direct bison dates and at least a few of these (e.g., Dibble and Lorrain 1967) are old
enough that their accuracy is questionable by contemporary standards (Table 12-2;
compare with Table 5-2). Based on these dates, some directly dated bison are known
for the Austin interval, ca. 1250–750 B.P., although most of these come from sites in
the Texas and Oklahoma panhandle regions, relatively far to the north of Zatopec;
nearby exceptions are coastal sites presented by Ricklis (1990). These data do not
refute the reported presence of Austin-period bison at Zatopec, but neither do they
provide strong support. Rather, in the view adopted by this project, directly dated bison
remains represent a complementary and in many ways more useful way of dating the
presence of bison in a research area. Given available techniques for purifying samples
to ensure the veracity of bone dates, one obvious advantage of this technique is greater
accuracy of archaeological reconstructions of periods of bison presence at the site level.
Another is in extending the ranges of known bison presence by identifying ephemeral
components that contain bison but that lack other distinguishing material traits. One
example is from Zatopec, and includes the Colonial-age bison date (UGAMS 4426) that
corroborates the Black Luster Glaze sherd recovered by earlier field schools. A second
example is equally late dates from 41PT186, 41PT245, and 41TG346 in the Texas
panhandle (Quigg et al. 2010). Direct evidence for early Historic or Protohistoric bison
exploitation is exceedingly rare in the study area, but is an important line of evidence
for highlighting continuity or changes from earlier Prehistoric Toyah components to
early Historic periods that are also documented by written records. A final advantage
could come from compiling multiple site-level sequences and comparing these to assess
changes in site occupation histories within a region. An attempt is made to do this
using Late Archaic II/Austin and Toyah radiocarbon data from Zatopec, but a far larger
sample is required to verify the results presented here (see Chapter 5). As huntergatherer bands were continually on the move, regional settlement records should result
that reflect these differences in site histories. Considering that current data already
reveal important changes in the functions of different sites, even within the same time
periods, adding a precise understanding of when bison was exploited on certain sites,
as part of the reconstruction of occupation events, within a discrete regional pattern to
this record will provide considerable detail to the overall understanding of how these
regional cultural systems worked.

In addition to evaluating changes in prey selection over time, this analysis evaluated
patterns in which taxonomic elements were present at Zatopec in order to understand
how meat may have been shared between site occupants. Of the possible resources
utilized by hunter-gatherers, different forms of protein can be among the most
important in terms of conveying additional levels of meaning and significance (Speth
1990). Far from being an exclusively egalitarian activity, hunters both hunt and share
the results of hunting in a number of ways and for many possible reasons. Gurven and
Hill (2009: Figure 4) identified two primary psychological motivations for why men
hunt, called family provisioning and social status. Beyond simply hunting, however,
the outcome of this activity depends on how procured game is made available to other
individuals in a hunter’s social network. Lupo and Schmitt (2004) reviewed recent
analyses of prey selection and subsequent meat sharing behavior and described how
trade-offs between family consumption (which they called a provisioner strategy)
and gaining social advantages (which they called a show-off strategy) influence
men’s hunting and sharing behavior. The consistent recognition of these two kinds of
strategies for hunting and sharing behavior opens important analytical opportunities
for archaeologists.
Considering the potential social value of protein, and of different forms of protein,
the current analysis sought to identify possible changes in sharing behavior over time in
relation to emphasis on large game. Ideally, good contextual preservation would allow
the identification of discrete habitation localities within the Zatopec campsite pattern
for a given time period and faunal assemblages from these could be compared. Such was
not the case, however, and analysis focused instead on patterns of consumption between
on-site dependent consumers and those directly involved in procuring game. Speth
(1990) offers an example of unequal consumption of some meat resources between two

459

social groups (hunters and non-hunters) by describing the snacking behavior of some
hunters, who consumed fatty organs at the kill site and returned lower-ranked portions
to other dependent consumers. Following Speth, this analysis considered whether
Zatopec hunters who hunted away from camp may have preferentially consumed first
choice cuts at the kill site or at some other intermediate location before most of the
carcass was returned to camp for communal consumption.
Using methods proposed by Binford (1978) and Metcalf and Jones (1988) for
establishing the social and nutritional value of elements, bison and deer/antelope
elements were ranked as being of high, medium, and low utility. From these data,
a utility index representing the ratio of differently ranked elements was calculated.
Higher indices indicate that higher ranked elements occurred with greater frequency
in the Zatopec assemblage, meaning that they were made available more equitably
between hunters and people who remained in camp. Lower index scores reflect the
heavier frequency of lower-ranked portions on site.
Problems with differential preservation and the fact that bison was represented
mostly by teeth (see discussion in Chapter 9) prohibit the development of a complete
understanding of meat sharing at Zatopec. However, an important pattern was
recognized when bison utility was compared with that of deer and antelope, leading to
the conclusion that, during periods of increasing reliance on bison, deer and antelope
were shared less equitably. In order to look for this pattern elsewhere, the multicomponent Wilson-Leonard assemblage was similarly evaluated, and the same results
were identified: during periods when bison were (1) more common at the site and
(2) appear to have been shared more equitably, utility indices for deer and antelope
declined (see Figures 9-6 and 9-7). Based on these findings, it is concluded that periods
of bison hunting result in changes not just in how meat is shared, but in how different
kinds of meat is shared.
Assuming that bison and deer/antelope were hunted by the same individuals, this
finding seems to suggest that, during periods when bison was hunted, bison meat
was shared in apparently more communal, egalitarian ways whereas deer/antelope
were consumed preferentially by hunters. However, there is a good chance that this is
not actually the case. Consuming higher ranked deer and antelope elements at those
kill sites conforms to neither a family provisioning nor a show off strategy, both of
which require that meat be returned to camp in order to attain the social benefits that
come with sharing. The pattern only indicates that hunters, presumably male, acted
selfishly by retaining unequal access to some resources in relation to non-hunters
during periods when social benefits associated with large game hunting were more
available. With respect to the full range of motivations for hunting and sharing large
game, determining whether or not bison was shared widely among an entire band
(group-level provisioning), preferentially by a hunter’s immediate kin network (family

460

provisioning) or according to other reasons to help individual hunters attain higher
status (following Gurven and Hill 2009) will require the excavation of contextually
controlled assemblages within residential camps, and then comparing assemblages
associated with nuclear family living areas . In addition, a better understanding of
how bison were hunted (by groups or individuals) and where they were processed (at
kill sites, intermediate processing sites, or back at the main residential camp) will also
be required before archaeologists can fully understand meat sharing with respect to
bison. Nevertheless, future analyses should be informed by the patterns documented
at Zatopec and Wilson-Leonard showing that periods of reliance on large game were
marked by inegalitarian behaviors, at least between hunters and dependent consumers.
Research Domain 4: Hunter-Gatherer Technological Organization Over Time
The final research domain addressed in research and analysis of remains at Zatopec,
although the most complex, contributes the most information about the prehistoric
occupants of the site. Hunter-gatherers organize their technological systems according
to a wide range of variables, at least some of which represent internal dynamics
between individuals on the basis of skill and aptitude, social role, and motivations
relating to social status and prestige. Summarizing the findings of technological
organization at Zatopec requires at least a partial understanding of earlier conclusions
about hunter-gatherer technology, although the current analysis shows that none of
these conclusions can be considered complete.
For example, Bousman (1993) has argued that foragers, who moved often but
rarely encountered unexpected or unpredictable situations with respect to procuring
and processing resources, typically exhausted tools before discarding them. On the
other hand, collectors, including specialized logistical task groups, discarded tools
prematurely to avoid tool failure at critical moments. Tool use data from Zatopec show
that, over time, all tool categories were gradually used with increasing intensity, yet
this applied to flake tools at significantly higher rates than to other tools. Tomka (2001)
noted that reliance on a single resource that occurred often (or in high volume) led to
an increase in tool specialization and a decrease in expedient tools. Zatopec’s Toyah
assemblage, corresponding with the heaviest reliance on bison, showed a marked
increase in expediently-made tools, which seemingly contradicts Tomka’s assessment.
Although assemblage-level resolution is not good enough to conclude that more tool
forms were found in Toyah components compared with earlier times, blade material was
much more frequent at this time, which provides partial support for Tomka’s model.
At Zatopec, an increase was observed in the production of informal flake tools
as well as bifaces, and also in flake tool use. These findings cannot be explained by
any preceding research that was used to inform this analysis, or by other simplistic
explanations. For example, the extensive utilization of flake tools might be explainable
through a reduction in the amount of available raw chert; however, this outcrop was

461

never exhausted (Garber 1986). Another possible interpretation is that the increased
importance of flake tools in Toyah times is indicative of a shift to foraging strategies.
However, others have demonstrated a shift toward collector strategies during this time
period (Johnson 1994; Tomka 2001; Mauldin et al 2010), and, as discussed in Chapter 7,
Zatopec contains several indications of a shift toward logistical hunting.
Most previous studies start from the assumption that foragers practiced relatively
homogenous technological strategies and that a common decision-making logic
or rationale explains assemblage-level variation. Instead, we see the seemingly
contradictory data from Zatopec as best explained when divisions of labor by sex, if not
age are also considered. Important to developing this understanding is hypothesizing
links between technological variation and the task groups in question. In other
words, members of bands at Zatopec seem to have conducted their respective tasks
by fashioning and designing tools to meet their unique needs rather than in response
to a generalized strategy for making tools. Focusing on the Toyah component, some
examples illustrate how technological organization can be modeled using patterned
divisions of labor. Based on the sharp increase in biface and projectile point production
at this time (see Table 11-3), at the same time that flake tools increased in number
(Table 11-2) and usage (see Chapter 7), we conclude that hunters were engaging more
heavily in gearing up for bison hunts, and that people responsible for processing bison
necessarily spent more time at that task. In addition to these quantitative shifts in
work loads, however, social contexts associated with large game hunting also resulted
in qualitative changes in how work was being performed, how skills were imparted, and
how certain technological information was increasingly restricted, either deliberately or
as an unintentional outcome of increasingly distinct labor divisions. Two cases illustrate
what this process looked like in Toyah times. One involves people who hunted bison and
presumably made tools used for that task, and the other involves people responsible for
processing bison.
For bison hunters, both point and biface production increased strongly from earlier
periods (see Table 11-3). Also during this time, width-to-thickness ratios for late-stage
Toyah bifaces (and points) are consistently greater than in earlier periods, and overall
skill appears to have been higher. Not only were more bifaces being made, but they
were thinner and also more skillfully made (Table 11-5). The skillful production of
wide, thin bifaces was achieved at least in part through greater attention to platform
preparation. Biface makers not only removed more billet and other kinds of thinning
flakes than in earlier times (see Figure 11-3), which is expected considering that more
bifaces were being produced. As a group, Toyah knappers also ground their platforms
more than in earlier times (see figure 7-71), and they also ground their platforms more
variably in relation to each other than knappers in earlier times (see Table 7-50). In
other words, the Toyah period, characterized by big game hunting and the unequal
consumption of some meat, also saw more variation in individual performances between

462

knappers than in earlier periods. Perhaps as a result, the skill profile for Toyah-period
points differs markedly from that of other periods (see Table 11-1 and Figure 11-1), with
proportionally more low- and high-skilled points than seen in earlier times. Although
not as strongly pronounced, the same skill profile occurs for Castroville points, which
probably reflect the period of next-highest emphasis on bison hunting at the site (see
Figure 11-1). Together, these data support the conclusion that Toyah point and biface
makers, arguably the same task group that was involved in bison hunting, were
behaving in increasingly self-serving ways that must have set certain toolmakers apart
from other toolmakers in the same task group. We interpret this to be a reflection of
increasing competition within the group of individuals who made Toyah bifaces and
arrow points.
Evidence indicates that the technological performance of individuals involved not
in hunting, but in processing tasks became increasingly differentiated from those who
made and used points. Flake tools (see Figure 7-38) and the ratio of flake tools to bifaces
(see Table 11-2) increased at this time. Alone, these data are not noteworthy except to
establish that more flake tools were in use in Toyah times than before. Additionally,
the fact that flake tools were used much more extensively than before (see Figure 7-41)
merely confirms the increasing work load of flake tool users. It is important that bifacial
tools do not seem to have been used with the same kind of increasing intensity (see
Figure 11-16), which begins to suggest differentiated work conditions between these
task groups.
In addition to how flakes were used, important changes can be seen in what kinds
of flakes were used as tools. Looking at standardized frequencies, the use of nonthinning flakes as tools increased notably in Toyah times, but the use of thinning flakes
dropped. Although the frequency with which billet flakes were used as tools increases
slightly (see Figure 11-11), in reality use of these flakes as tools drops in relation to the
overall increase of billet flaking during this time (see Figure 11-11); the same is true for
thinning flakes (see Figure 11-12). Although the distinction in how thinning and nonthinning flakes are used as tools is strongest in Toyah times, it is noteworthy that the
pattern is also expressed in the Late Archaic II assemblage (see Figure 11-6), arguably
a time when emphasis on bison was also heavy (though not as heavy as Toyah). The
divergence between flakes used as tools and the process of bifacial flaking is also seen
in the flake core assemblage, where bifacial approaches to designing cores drops to
almost zero in Toyah times (see Figure 11-22). Interestingly, non-bifacial flake cores
show a slight peak in the Late Archaic II, adding some support to the conclusion that,
during periods of bison emphasis, different task groups undertook somewhat distinct
technological approaches to designing and maintaining their tool kits.
If Toyah flake toolmakers were increasingly removed from biface thinning activities,
what kinds of flakes were being selected for use? In addition to the fact that very few
billet flakes were used, and more non-thinning flakes were selected than in any previous

463

time, approximately half of all Toyah flake tools had between 1 and 33 percent cortex on
their dorsal surfaces, a sharp increase from earlier times. Also, most flake tool platforms
were relatively lightly ground compared with earlier times. This is not surprising
given the drop in the use of thinning flakes as tools. However, variation in platform
grinding increases (see Figure 11-10), suggesting that flake toolmakers acted with
greater variation as a group, similar to what occurred with Toyah point makers. This
figure does not include flakes with crushed platforms, which also peaks in Toyah times
(see Figure 7-46). The use of complete flakes as tools steadily declined in Toyah times
(see Figure 7-43), indicating an overall decrease in some skill levels (see discussion in
Chapter 1). A notable increase is also seen in how many flakes were apparently picked
up from the surface and used as tools, as indicated in the presence of an outer patina
on a flake surface that was subsequently flaked through (see Figure 7-45). This practice
provides yet another example of behavioral variation relating to procuring useful flakes
to use as tools. In summary, Toyah flake tools appear to have been procured through a
number of different strategies ranging all the way from gleaning of available material
and relatively poorly skilled knapping to some investment in platform preparation to
help ensure successful detachments.
As the need for flake tools increased during Toyah times, arguably in response to
the increased demands associated with bison exploitation, more flakes were made,
flake use intensified, flakes used as tools had less in common with biface thinning
flakes, flake tools became more variable as a category, and several more flakes were
gleaned from the surface after having been struck in earlier times but then discarded.
Together, these data show that some Toyah flake toolmakers were removing flakes
with low levels of knapping skill (seen in the increase in incomplete flakes) but were
increasingly differentiated from each other in terms of how platforms were prepared
and smoothed. Finally, flake cores showing bifacial approaches to platform design and
maintenance almost completely disappear in Toyah times. From these data, we conclude
that people who used Toyah flake tools (1) often did not make them (seen in patinated
flakes), (2) made them with somewhat less flaking skill than seen in earlier times (seen
in incomplete flakes), (3) employed non-bifacial approaches to removing flakes (seen
in flake tool and flake core types), (4) selected flakes with certain percentages of cortex
(1–33 percent), and (5) used them with much greater intensity that seen for biface tool
use (seen in E:M/R ratios for all tool types; see Figures 11-15, 11-16).
Conclusions
The analysis of excavated materials from Zatopec provides a great deal of insight into
hunter-gatherer technological organization, prey selection behavior, and residential
patterning from the Late Archaic I through Toyah times along the face of the Balcones
Escarpment. Although the Zatopec record, as presented here, is capable of addressing a
number of important research issues about which too little is known by archaeologists

464

working in the region, this concluding discussion turns attention to social processes that
can be identified as having played a significant role in shaping the archaeological record
at the site.
Even though many of these findings should be confirmed in future studies, almost
all of the data compiled here can be used to propose three fundamental hypotheses
concerning hunter-gatherer adaptations in Central Texas and elsewhere in response
to environmental and/or climatic changes. Important to these hypotheses is the use
of cross-cultural ethnographic information as a comparative analogy. To be sure,
ethnographic data do not confirm archaeological interpretations. Rather, they provide
a useful framework for interpreting archaeological information in ways that can be
evaluated in the future. The argument is made that gendered and other social labor
roles changed over time in relation to subsistence practices that included a focus on big
game. Although changes surely also occurred in response to focused reliance on other
resources, only bison are considered here. It is left to future analyses to address the
effect that intensive exploitation of other resources had on the record. Although these
hypotheses remain to be proven, they represent the most parsimonious interpretation of
available data from Zatopec.
Concluding Hypothesis One: Gendered Labor Divisions Became Pronounced
during Periods of Big Game Focus
During periods of intense focus on large game hunting, gendered roles in society
appear to have been transformed compared to earlier periods, with men’s and women’s
work becoming more strongly delineated and some women’s work becoming increasingly
tedious. At Zatopec, Toyah is the best represented period of big game focus, although
the Late Archaic II is also identified as an important period of bison hunting. Focusing
on some Toyah materials, the expression of technological skill improves over earlier
periods, and a greater investment in time and expertise in the manufacture of many
points and bifaces is indicated. There is also, however, increasing differentiation in
terms of skilled performance within groups of tool producers. For example, billet flakes
increase more than three-fold from Austin times (see Figure 7-68), but the degree
to which flake platforms were ground separates into approximately four levels of
smoothing rather than the three levels that define the two preceding time periods (see
Figure 7-71 and below). Data indicate that more points were being made, more bifaces
were being made, more debris from biface production was being generated, and more
time was spent in preparing flakes for removal during the biface production process.
Tool use data, however, reveal that bifacial tools were not used with much greater
intensity than during earlier periods (see Figure 11-16), suggesting that all of these
observed data indicate greater amounts of time spent in production but not necessarily
in use. In contrast, flake tools increase in number as well as in use intensity (see Figure
11-15), to the point that many flake tools were used to exhaustion prior to discard.

465

According to the available ethnographic record, large game hunting is primarily a
male pursuit (see Figure 1-7), and men would arguably have also been involved in the
production of necessary tools for that activity. For example, archaeological burial data
indicate that approximately 85 percent of billet flaking assemblages are associated with
males (see Chapter 1), and based on those figures billet flaking is primarily ascribed to
males at Zatopec. Associating the processing of bison exclusively with women is tricky,
however, considering that the same cross-cultural record indicating male dominance
of big game hunting is ambivalent regarding butchering or hide working (see Figure
1-7). However, Plains Indian women were exclusively associated with hide preparation
in early Historic times (Scheiber 2005), and protohistoric data suggest that hide
processing was women’s work in earlier times as well (Habicht-Mauche 2005). Perhaps
an important distinction is to be made between butchering and preparing skins, if
skins were processed in camp and butchering took place at kill site locations. No microwear analysis capable of distinguishing butchering from hide processing tools was
performed here, although it would constitute a highly significant component of future
analyses. Still, overall changes in tool frequency, and particularly in use intensity, are
sufficient to indicate dramatic changes in how social labor was allocated during Toyah
times. Moreover, considering technological distinctions among tools (see below), it is
hypothesized that whoever produced and used thin bifaces and projectile points were
not the same people who made and used flake tools.
Although the present discussion focuses primarily on Zatopec’s Toyah component,
future analyses could address this issue for other intervals characterized by a big game
focus, including Early Paleoindian, the Middle Archaic Calf Creek horizon, and Late
Archaic periods defined by Castroville and Montell points that are often associated with
bison hunting. Conversely, sites with other functions, such as intensive processing of
plant foods or of locally gathered small terrestrial or aquatic fauna, could also shed light
on how social labor roles by gender or age were altered in the relative absence of an
important focus on large game exploitation.
Concluding Hypothesis Two: In Periods of Big Game Focus, some Women Were
Alienated from some Forms of Technological Knowledge
A number of different data show a marked distinction in the technological strategies
for making and procuring flakes used as tools, and the production of bifaces and
projectile points. Thinning and billet flakes were used less often as flake tools, in spite
of the fact that both classes of flakes increased dramatically in Toyah assemblages. An
equally striking indication of the divergent technological relationships between flake
tool production and the production of bifaces and points is seen in the design of flake
cores, very few of which show bifacial approaches to platform maintenance. Finally, not
only did more flake tools include incompletely detached flakes (flaking failures), a larger
percentage than ever before included previously discarded flakes.

466

Ideally, contextual preservation would allow the identification of work spaces that
could be evaluated to demonstrate how technological approaches to tool manufacture
were associated with discrete task groups. Still, at Zatopec the expression of these
increasingly divergent views of how different kinds of tools should be made and used
indicates that those task groups worked together less and less over time. One perhaps
unintentional result of this shifting pattern of labor coordination was that flake
toolmakers rarely adopted bifacial approaches when making their tools. Rather, they
often (though not always) resorted to poorly skilled flake removals, or even to gleaning
discarded flakes that were found lying about.
If technological knowledge suited for crafting wide, thin bifaces became increasingly
unavailable to flake toolmakers, one probable outcome is that the detachments of flakes
used as tools was less well controlled, meaning that the kinds of flakes available for
use as tools was less predictable. This is exactly the case with Toyah flake tools from
Zatopec: more are incomplete or broken on detachment, more are gleaned from the
surface, and more overall variation is present. This is not to say that Toyah flake-maker
skill declined overall; skill profiles for this task group were not addressed in this study,
and future analyses should explore ways to assess skill on flake cores as was done
here with bifaces and projectile points. Still, the alienation of technological knowledge
regarding some techniques for controlling flake removals resulted in flake tools being
fashioned or procured through a number of ways.
Whether the apparent restriction of technological knowledge was intentional or
not might be approached by also examining whether raw stone materials of varying
quality were preferentially used for thin bifaces and projectile points versus flake tools
and cores. If poor quality material is consistently found to be associated with informal,
utilitarian tools, then it would be possible to conclude that the alienation of certain
forms of technological knowledge was indeed part of a larger pattern of maintaining
unequal access to certain key resources, including but not limited to information and
certain raw materials. In any event, the result of this technological discrepancy is that
the Toyah flake tool assemblage appears largely expedient in design, if heavily curated
in use intensity, and somewhat opportunistic in terms of how these implements were
obtained. In these ways they stand in contrast with other tool forms for the same time
period.
Concluding Hypothesis Three: In Periods of Big Game Focus, some Men
Increasingly Competed for Prestige
Ethnographic data indicate that forager men hunt in response to two general
motivating factors: provisioning their families and enjoying the benefits that come with
the prestige of successfully procuring large meat packages (Lupo and Schmitt 2004).
Gurven and Hill (2009: Figure 4) categorize the benefits associated with social status
gains as including access to extra pair-bond mating opportunities, deference from

467

others, assistance in rearing and caring for offspring, and preferential participation
in trade networks. From an evolutionary perspective, all of these contribute somehow
to biological fitness, and provide sufficient rationale for engaging in food procurement
behavior that is often associated with higher encounter failure rates and that produces a
less reliable protein supply. Importantly, however, big game hunters are nearly always
underwritten or supported to some degree by others who focus their subsistence-related
activities on more stable, predictable resources. Still, given the social advantages that
accompany successful big game hunting, it is often seen as an environment in which
participants compete for prestige and other benefits.
Data from Zatopec indicate unequal access to some meat, deer and antelope during
periods when bison hunting was more common, and this pattern is also seen in at least
one major nearby site (Wilson-Leonard). In this case, inequalities existed between
hunters and dependent consumers back at camp. Demonstrating whether or not the
bison elements that were returned to camp were also shared inequitably will require
better contextual preservation than found at Zatopec. Consequently, the current faunal
data are only partially capable of showing some kinds of competition between hunters,
or between hunters and dependent consumers. Technological data, however, clearly
show changes in performance in ways that suggest individuals were undertaking their
tasks in response to the expected pay-offs of greater hunting success.
Skill assessments of Perdiz points show disproportionately high occurrences of low
and high skill in relation to mediocre performance. The same is true but to a lesser
degree for Castroville points, and these two types are most strongly associated with
bison exploitation at Zatopec. In contrast, skill assessments for other periods show a
normal distribution reflecting average populations, with most points reflecting moderate
skill and relatively few low and highly skilled specimens being present. Additionally,
Toyah bifaces show higher overall skill from earlier periods, and more time was spent
in biface production, at least as indicated in flake platform smoothing (see Figure 11-9),
at this time. In general, the greater investment in Toyah biface production is directly
reflected in the increase in billet flake frequency, and in changes in platform treatments
for these flakes. Not only were the platforms for all Toyah flakes better prepared by
smoothing than in earlier times, but billet flakes, in particular, show changes in time
investment that indicate differences in individual knapper performance. Platform
smoothing on billet flakes generally follows the trend noted for all flakes (see Figure
11-9), except that three levels of performance are perfectly clear for Late Archaic II
and Austin times (Figure 12-1) and are only loosely indicated for all flakes. These three
levels of performance become differentiated into four levels of performance in Toyah
times, as Degree of Smoothing (DoS) 2 increases sharply and becomes distinguishable
from DoS 3. This increase almost perfectly accounts for the related decrease in DoS 1
frequency, and indicates that some Toyah billet flakers began spending incrementally

468

Figure 12-1. Differences in billet flake platform smoothing over time.

more time smoothing platforms than in earlier periods. Ostensibly, the sole objective
of this increase in time investment was to achieve better control of flake removals
for the production of wide, thin bifaces and related implements. As a riskier flaking
strategy, producing these kinds of artifacts carried higher chances of knapping failures.
Nevertheless, this mode of production represents a kind of time-intensive technological
elaboration associated with periods of heavy focus on hunting and processing large
game.
Together, the many lines of evidence from Zatopec reveal the rich cultural history
of Central Texas in general and of the Balcones Escarpment and its associated springs
and waterways in particular. Bands of hunters and gatherers aggregated intermittently
at Zatopec over an approximately 8,000-year time span, extending as recently as the
historical spread of Spanish mission influence into the northern reaches of New Spain.
Over time, but particularly from Late Archaic II to Toyah periods, important shifts
occurred here in settlement patterning and resource-related technological practices.
Based on our findings, these shifts directly reflect how social labor was scheduled,
negotiated, and coordinated by task groups. These factors contributed to assemblagelevel variation as much or more than any other source of influence that can be
identified, and are of utmost importance for understanding patterned adaptations in the
long hunter-gatherer record in Central Texas.

Re: Shovel testing of proposed location for sedimentation/filtration pond along Wonder World
Drive extension
Dear Mr. Avila,
This letter report presents the findings of archaeological shovel testing performed by the
Center for Archaeological Studies (CAS) of Texas State University on behalf of the City of San
Marocs in the area identified as a potential location of a sedimentation/filtration pond alongside the
proposed route of the Wonder World Drive extension. This work was conducted under Texas
Antiquities Permit No. 4569, issued to me by the Texas Historical Commission for conducting
archaeological investigations at nearby 41HY163.
Methods and Findings
The initial project area was located within approximately one-third of a mile of Hunter Road
on the west side of the proposed Wonder World Drive extension. The survey area includes moderate
slopes that trend downward toward the poorly defined Purgatory Creek channel, and a narrow strip
of level, elevated terrain to the west. The Hays County Soil Survey (Batte 1984) shows that the
project area is covered with Rumple-Comfort association soils, which include cherty clay loams
overlying chert and limestone cobbles and gravels. Soils range from 14 to over 28 inches in depth.
Based on communications with you regarding the proposed location of the
sedimentation/filtration pond, we initially targeted an area measuring roughly 200x300 ft, or
approximately 1.37 acres (Figure 1). On Thursday, August 23rd, we initiated a series of nine shovel
tests (STs), spaced evenly across the area in order to examine for subsurface archaeological deposits.
All shovel tests were excavated in 20 cm levels, with cultural and possibly cultural materials
recovered placed in individual field bags. These materials were described and placed in the shovel
test as it was backfilled. In many of the STs, we recovered either no cultural materials, or very
broken and battered chert fragments and pebbles (Appendix A). Most STs terminated at bedrock or
impenetrable gravels at approximately 20 cm below surface. We interpret these remains as indicating
the colluvial nature of the side-slope deposits, and consider them not to represent intact
archaeological remains.
In ST7, however, CAS recovered an arrow point made of metal (Figure 2), indicating a
historic period Native American presence (artifacts from ST7 were returned to CAS where they will
be permanently curated). This find is significant, as historic period Native American sites are
extremely rare in the Central Texas region. Accordingly, the next day we expanded our efforts and
conducted twelve additional shovel tests to define the boundaries of this potential site. A total of 21
shovel tests were conducted in the originally proposed pond area, and the site boundaries were found
to extend beyond the southern edge of the initial proposed pond location. Included among our

Appendix A

471

findings from the site area were three bifaces found on the surface within a 5 m diameter area
(Figure 3). Additionally, one of the STs (No. 15) placed on the site extended more than 80 cm, and
produced artifacts, fauna, and carbon. Together, these finds suggest the presence of discrete activity
areas, intact cultural features, and extended deposits in at least parts of the site.

Figure 1. Location of the shovel testing program in relation to the initial proposed location of
the sedimentation/filtration pond. (Original Espey base map incorrectly depicts north.)
The metal arrow point is historic in age, and provides some age estimate for the site. The
chipped stone artifacts are not considered temporally diagnostic. It therefore is possible that this site
contains multiple components, including both historic and prehistoric Native American materials.
Based on consultations with the Texas Historical Commission (THC), on Monday and
Tuesday, August 27 and 28th we extended our efforts all the way to the back of the historic house
that fronts Hunter Road and that was recorded by 2002 the Hicks & Company survey of the
proposed Wonder World extension (Karbula et al. 2003). Including the original 21 shovel tests, CAS
conducted a total of 41 subsurface probes (Figure 4) during this effort.

The extended effort allowed CAS to propose the precise boundaries of the historic period
Native American site as they are found within the surveyed area. The site extends approximately 121
meters along the southeast-to-northwest running fence line that bounds the City owned project area.
It measures 30 m wide across most of this area. Though site boundaries doubtlessly extend outside
the survey area and onto private property, a significant part of the site is located in the project area.

Boundaries of temporary site are shown, as is the location of the possible historic cemetery.
None of the additional shovel tests recovered any significant evidence of archaeological
remains. All pieces of chert that were recovered had heavily battered ridges from colluvial processes,
and many had random angular fractures from exposure to extreme heat or freezing conditions. One
of these, ST39, extended approximately 80 cm below the surface, but was placed adjacent to a
modern earthen berm, meaning that much of the sediments from this unit are probably highly
disturbed. We take all of this evidence as indicating secondary geologic depositional contexts,
suggesting that no cultural remains of potential significance are present here.
In the area immediately behind the historic house, a small area was noted that contains three
potential features that, based on their appearance, were thought to possibly contain human burials.
Two are uncarved, shaped limestone blocks placed side-by-side approximately 1 m apart (Figure 5A
4

Appendix A

474

and B). The third is an area measuring 2 x .75 m covered with broken concrete slabs and a limestone
flagstone (Figure 5C). This area is approximately 75 meters behind the house and is not separated by
any sort of fence or barrier. No other decorations or adornments that might identify it as a cemetery
are present, and it is not depicted on the San Marcos South U.S.G.S. 7.5’ Quad Sheet. The Hicks &
Company survey report does not identify the stones or mention a possible historic cemetery.

Figure 5. Possible headstones and small historic cemetery behind house recorded by the 2002
Hicks & Company survey. A and B are looking south, C looks east, and D faces north. The
stone in B is closest to the crew member in D.
In order to determine if this area indeed contains human burials, it was mechanically scraped
by carefully and systematically removing the topsoil overburden directly behind the two shaped
stones and also in the area covered by cement fragments. If these were human burials, it was hoped
that the outline of the grave shafts would become visible once the topsoil had been removed. In
addition to the area behind the shaped stones and under the cement blocks, scraping extended east to
within the proposed Wonder World Drive extension right-of-way (ROW) to ensure that human
burials did not extend into the area of proposed roadway construction.
Scraping revealed this area to be the resting place for the remains of domestic pets, including
two large dogs (Figure 6). One dog had been enveloped in a quilted blanket while the other was

5

Appendix A

475

simply surrounded by large stones. Each of the two exposed burials was less than 20 cm below the
surface. Additionally, a 2 inch water pipe runs immediately beneath the surface between the two
shaped stones. Scraping in the area toward and into the ROW exposed solid bedrock and dense
alluvial gravels from Purgatory Creek within 20 cm of the ground surface (Figure 7). Based on these
results, CAS determines that no historic human burials are located in this vicinity.

Figure 7. Scraped area into right-of-way, exposing near-surface bedrock and dense alluvial
gravels. View to northwest; dog burial in Figure 6A indicated by white arrow at left.
Located within 5 m of the extended scrape area, project personnel located a circular blue
hatch emerging from the ground with a vent pipe located within a few feet of the hatch (Figure 8A).
The prior survey report refers to this feature as a “modern fiberglass sewer of some sort” (Karbula et

6

Appendix A

476

al. 2003:45). However, closer inspection showed that the lid opens on two rusted hinges (Figure 8B)
to reveal a vertical shaft with a ladder mounted inside. This vertical shaft extends 10 to 12 feet into
the ground, where it joins a small opening at a right angle “elbow” joint (Figure 8C). This
passageway extends less than 10 feet before opening into a large domed chamber with a single light
bulb suspended from the ceiling. This construction consists of two molded fiberglass pieces joined
by nut-and-bolt assemblies; this joint is sealed by silicon caulking. An electronic blower is attached
to the chamber wall opposite the entrance (Figure 8D); this blower would have pumped fresh air
from the surface into the shelter through the air vent noted above. The interior of the chamber is
filled with an estimated 2 feet of water. In addition to a number of spare light bulbs, some debris is
visible beneath the water surface (Figure 8E, 8F).

Figure 8. Underground shelter dating to the late-1950s or early-1960s.
Shelters of this type were common from the late-1950s to the early-1960s. They were
frequently installed as a measure of protection against the risk of attacks on the United States,
particularly from nuclear bombs launched by the Soviet Union or one of its client nation states such
as Cuba during the Cold War. It is also likely that some shelters of this type were installed to offer
protection in cases of severe weather.
Recommendations
The historic and possibly prehistoric Native American site yielding the metal arrow point has
not been formally evaluated for eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) or formal designation as a State Archaeological Landmark (SAL). However, CAS
recommends that the site be treated as if it were eligible for NRHP listing under Criterion D, which
addresses sites that have yielded or may be likely to yield information important in prehistory or
history, and worthy of SAL designation, and that the City redesign its sedimentation/filtration pond
so the boundaries of this site are altogether avoided. Any additional work within the site boundaries

7

Appendix A

477

would require testing to confirm the site’s eligibility. The City, having been made aware of this
pending recommendation, has provided plans for the redesigned pond location indicating that it will
not impact the site area (Figure 9). Concerning placement of the sedimentation/filtration pond, CAS
recommends based on the results of shovel testing that the City be allowed to place the pond as
depicted in Figure 9, which has been shown not to contain deposits, features, or cultural materials
that are considered eligible for NRHP inclusion or SAL designation. CAS recommends that the City
be granted full regulatory clearance for this area.
The possible historic cemetery has been shown through mechanical scraping to be an old pet
cemetery that does not contain human burials. It is not considered historically or culturally
significant, and CAS recommends that the City be granted regulatory clearance for any future
development in this locality.
The shelter appears to date the late-1950s or early 1960s. Its exact date of installation is
unknown, and it is furthermore not known for what original purpose it was installed. Its potential
eligibility for inclusion to the NRHP is not assessed here, nor is its worthiness for designation as a
SAL. It is located within the intended ROW of the Wonder World Drive extension, and so will be
impacted by that roadway construction. Given the possibility that it dates to the post-World War IIto-Cold War era, however, its eligibility status should be determined prior to roadway construction.
CAS recommends that determinations of significance be made by an architectural historian under
Criterion A of the NRHP. This criterion addresses sites that are “associated with events that have
made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history.”
Please do not hesitate to ask if you have any questions. CAS appreciates the opportunity to
provide these results to you and the City of San Marcos.

TxDOT Comments on the Prehistoric Life, Labor, and Residence in
Southeast-Central Texas: Results of Data Recovery at 41HY163,
the Zatopec Site, San Marcos, Texas, edited by Jon C. Lohse
Report 18, Center for Archaeological Studies,
Texas State University-San Marcos
The authors have expended an exemplary level of effort in conducting data recovery
investigations at the Zapotec site. There can be no doubt that their field excavations
captured nearly every aspect of the site deposits that can be considered significant.
The laboratory analyses of materials recovered from the current fieldwork as well as
from the previous Texas State University at San Marcos archeological field schools
encompass a broad range of current technological and analytical methods. The
ambitious reporting and interpretation is well organized, theoretically based, and
presented in a relatively clear and concise scientific manner. The investigators have
faithfully and responsibly fulfilled the entire breadth of regulatory requirements
associated with the related development. It is TxDOT’s opinion however, that several
aspects of the authors’ interpretations deserve reconsideration.
The integrity of the site deposits does not seem sufficient for many of the analyses
that the reporting undertakes. The activities represented by the site’s main artifactbearing deposits occurred over many thousands of years, but these deposits typically
extend to no more than 60 centimeters below the ground surface. These characteristics
alone are sufficient to suspect that the artifacts occur in mixed contexts. This suspicion
is supported by the geoarcheological analyses conducted by Dr. Charles Frederick,
a recognized geomorphologist. In chapter 4 of the current report entitled, Results
of Excavations: Sediments Analysis and Stratigraphy, Dr. Frederick concludes that
the carbonate profile from sediments at the site is typical of older Holocene soils. In
addition, he concludes that younger components observed subsurface were most likely
transported deeper underground by bioturbation from burrowing animals as well as
from trampling and other prehistoric and historic human activities.
The archeological investigations conducted at 41HY163 clearly demonstrate a
bimodal distribution of coeval temporal artifacts with depth. Bimodal distribution
has been previously interpreted as the result of burrowing animals or trampling at
numerous other sites and is supported by evidence of the size-sorting of artifacts with
depth (Balek 2002; Bocek 1986; Erlandson and Rockwell 1987; Johnson 1989, 2002;
Schiffer 1983). The authors could have mitigated this concern by demonstrating that
size sorting by depth was not occurring on the site. However, no such explanation was
proposed.
The occurrence of patinated lithic artifacts in the deposits ascribed to the Late
Prehistoric deposits may also be attributable to bioturbation rather than the result of

Appendix B

487

scavenging and reuse of old artifacts as proposed by the authors. The authors undertook
a complex exercise attempting to argue for the stratigraphic integrity of small pockets
of the site deposits. However, the overwhelming majority of their excavation results
documented older materials mixed with or overlying younger materials. Bioturbation
processes and anthroturbation are both viable explanations for the vertical distribution
of radiocarbon assays and temporally chronologically artifacts that do not adhere to the
law of superimposition where older artifacts are mixed with or underlie younger ones.
The authors acknowledge that the site as a whole is compressed and mixed, yet they
still attempt to identify specific hand excavated levels within the site that they maintain
are minimally mixed. Hand excavated levels where diagnostics of more than one period
are present or where diagnostics were not recovered are assumed to lack integrity. The
remaining hand excavated levels, where only diagnostics of one period were present
and mixing could not be demonstrated from the artifact assemblage, are assumed to be
intact.
The authors construct analytical units by conflating data from these noncontiguous,
widely-distributed hand excavated levels into temporally-based collections. The
hand excavated levels comprising these analytical units are assigned to a particular
analytical unit by using “typological or technological information”—generally diagnostic
projectile points and tools, but also characteristic (albeit nebulous) technological
markers—that are typical of specific periods.
These analytical units are subsequently used to chart technological changes among
periods, an approach that leads to a circular argument. This strategy also largely
ignores the evidence imparted by the geoarcheological analyses and accepts as intact
those few hand excavated levels where an assumption of integrity cannot be falsified
based their artifactual content.
A more conservative approach would start with the assumption that all hand
excavated levels have been mixed to some degree and provide a more rigorous analysis
and account of those portions of the site that have somehow escaped the effects of
bioturbation. The authors have not undertaken such analyses to our satisfaction.
Based on the available evidence, the entire site comprises a single, compressed, mixed
assemblage. Such sites are common across central Texas. Consequently, we doubt that
the defined analytical units have sufficient integrity of location, design, and association
as prescribed by the National Park Service (Little et al. 2000) to provide reliable data
for use in many of the report’s analyses.
Having defined their analytical units, the authors propose various approaches to the
identification and explanation of site function, hunter-gatherer foraging behavior, and
gender roles. Subsequent analyses describe perceived changes in stone tool assemblages
and faunal assemblages. They observe shifts in the proportions of formal and expedient
tools, in knapping skills, and in densities of bison remains. The authors propose that

Appendix B

488

these changes can largely be attributed to the changing roles of prehistoric women.
They propose that the role of women in the Toyah Phase is particularly well-defined,
as women served as processors of bison meat and hides during that period. Many of the
questions that the report raises are interesting and worthy of further exploration. The
connections that the report draws between the research questions and the archeological
record, however, are sometimes tenuous.
The authors propose that 41H163 possesses the characteristics of an “aggregation
site”. Aggregation sites are roughly defined as unusual areas where the seasonal
abundance of a particular resource or resources allowed for denser accumulations of
prehistoric people than what would be possible at camps that were solely residential.
The authors distinguish “aggregation sites” from other types of residential camps
by the attributes of site size and assemblage diversity. This proposal seems overly
simplistic. Sample size effects must be considered carefully, particularly when
comparing site data among sites excavated under the constraints of compliance-driven
projects. Archeologists working in a regulatory context rarely have access to whole
sites, and their analyses may be limited by budgetary considerations. The upshot of
these constraints is that the sites utilized for comparison for sites such s 41HY163 may
have not been completely excavated and may not present the full accounting of human
occupation.
Distinguishing aggregation sites from other residential site types also requires
independent measures of the frequency of re-occupation within a particular
archeological period. Although an archeological period may represent a long period
of time, the occupation during that period may have been intense, with an absolutely
large number of repeat visits to that same location by a relatively small group. Another
period may represent a short period of time, but occupation may have been less intense,
with an absolutely lower number of repeat visits to the site. The interaction of variables
such as group size, period of occupation, frequency of occupation, and nature of activities
and site use affect the amount and diversity of material found at the site. In addition,
any discussion of aggregation sites should present the resource or resources responsible
for the denser aggregation of prehistoric peoples. No such discussion is presented in the
current report.
The authors’ methods don’t distinguish all of the variables needed to characterize
occupation. They cite the presence of burials as indicative of the site’s status as an
aggregation site without explaining the linkage that they draw between burial and
aggregation. Given the sample size, the extant chronometric data provide limited
insights to the intensity of reuse, and these data probably better reflect the likelihood of
charcoal preservation. The number of bison represented by the dated bones samples is
also not clear. Consequently, the possibility exists that different parts of one individual
animal may have been sampled for dating multiple times. In TxDOT’s opinion, such
issues undermine the authors’ arguments.
Appendix B

489

Based on their analyses of their assumed pockets of intact deposits, the authors
arrive at multiple conclusions. The authors’ suggest that the site was reoccupied
every 50-100 years. This suggestion is extremely hard to rectify with their notion that
41HY163 was an aggregation site. Furthermore, the authors don’t clearly explain why
they think that site type remained stable over the time of the site’s occupation. The
authors seemingly assume that the site always functioned as an aggregation-residential
camp, using the entire site’s composite record of material remains to reinforce that
assumption. The issue of site use deserves a more rigorous analysis.
A variety of issues similarly permeate the author’s discussion of foraging behavior
at the site. Leaving questions about the integrity of the analytical units aside, the
discussion of hunting seems to ignore simpler hypotheses about economic behavior in
favor of more elaborate ones related to prestige and sharing. Optimal foraging theory
predicts that when high-ranked game—as bison is presumed to be—is abundant,
low-ranked game drop out of the diet. Thus, the observation that bison abundance is
inversely correlated with the abundance of small- and medium-size game could simply
reflect efficient strategies for obtaining food and not status competition.
The discussion of animal part transport could similarly be supplemented with a
discussion of contrary, theoretically-derived hypotheses. These hypotheses predict that
low-value parts are less likely to be transported, because their value doesn’t justify the
transport cost (e.g., Binford 1978). Density-mediated attrition explains why lighter
bones disintegrate faster than denser bones and should be expected to affect the bones
represented in the archeological assemblage. Statistical methods have been proposed to
evaluate the significance of such processes (e.g., Faith and Gordon 2007; Rogers 2000;
Rogers and Broughton 2001). The authors did not conduct such evaluations raising
questions about the validity of the observed patterns and their conclusions.
In TxDOT’s opinion, the authors’ discussion of gender roles also suffers from
theoretical and analytical problems. The report surveys ethnographic evidence to
provide expectations for the division of labor by sex. The authors present a list of
references of studies related to identifying divisions of labor by age, sex, and task group.
Their review of cross-cultural ethnographic evidence finds that some activities tend
to be conducted predominantly by men and some activities predominantly by women.
Note that very few activities are exclusively the domain of any sex. The variability
and its explanation becomes the important issue. The question is, can circumstances
be identified under which these patterns should hold true? The applicability of the
observed patterns as a source of ethnographic analogies is not clear.
The authors find the ethnography of the Plains Hidatsa particularly relevant.
Plains Hidatsa women were apparently responsible for all activities save summer bison
hunting and related rituals which were conducted by men. The authors, however, do
not cite any ethnographic examples of women staying in camp during summer bison

Appendix B

490

hunts, creating stone tools, or butchering meat packages brought back to camp by
male hunting parties. Also note that the Hidatsa were Plains Villagers; in the case
of nomadic Plains bison hunters (such as the Lakota or Cheyenne), the whole band
typically followed the herd, and women would move in quickly to process the kill. The
ethnographic evidence does not portray the clear picture that the author’s would like to
paint. In fact, it contradicts it in that it appears that while the men were responsible
for killing the animals, it was the women who butchered the carcass and distributed
the meat. This ethnographic observation contradicts the high/low status hunter theory
proposed by the authors.
In addition, the authors cite previous studies of skeletal material as well as from
teeth of prehistoric burials for distinguishing gender roles. Yet no such analyses were
conducted for the burials recovered from 41HY163. The authors do mention that the
sample size of the burials may be too limited, but could have at least examined the teeth
of the individuals for patterns of wear that may have supported their research strategy
into gender roles.

The authors claim that “tools used for strongly-gendered activities will reflect
characteristic wear patterns”. They propose that tools strongly associated in
ethnographic studies with a particular gender would not be used in tasks that are
strongly associated in ethnographic studies with the opposite gender. Of course, lots
of other reasons exist why tool use might be limited to particular tasks. To pose a
trivial example, hunting tools are unlikely to be used in cooking activities, because
they are not designed for that function.
Tools used in very different contexts would not be expected to be made in a
similar fashion, either, as tool makers potentially faced different economic and
functional considerations. The authors suggest that gendered activities will be
characterized by tools with distinctive production trajectories. This suggestion may
have some merit, if explored in the right way.
The ideal test would be to compare tools with similar functional requirements
that are potentially associated with different gendered activities. Tools with similar
functional requirements may still be made in very different ways. The identification
of technological style entails the identification of intra-site isochrestic variation in
tool production for functionally-similar tools. In this context, isochrestic variation
refers to variation due to separate pathways for cultural transmission, such as toolmaking traditions being passed down within a particular gender (Bettinger et al.
1996). The authors’ approach, however, does not clearly allow such variation to be
identified.
There is at least one problematic aspect of the authors’ preposition that women
were most like responsible for relatively higher quantity of crude flake tools during
Toyah times. The authors’ model proposes that Toyah women were responsible for

Appendix B

491

processing bison carcasses at 41HY163. Under this scenario, Toyah women would
crudely break apart chert cobbles in order to make crude tools for butchering bison meat
and processing bison hides. However, the authors offer no discussion on how these
crude tool forms could have functioned in butchering and hide preparation. In order to
successfully propose this argument, the authors should have presented some discussion
on how these crude tools were capable of accomplishing these tasks. The authors did
not present any clear evidence that these tools would in fact be applicable in butchering
bison carcasses and preparing bison hides.
Based upon the questionable integrity of the site deposits as well as various
problems of method and theory, the authors’ conclusions can not be endorsed. This
is unfortunate because the report has much to recommend in terms of approach and
paradigm. Ultimately, however, these elaborate intellectual structures are constructed
on a compromised foundation and therefore run the very real risk of being completely
wrong in any number of ways.

Response to TxDot Comments on the Final Report
of Data Recovery at 41HY163, the Zatopec Site
by Jon C. Lohse
As the Principal Investigator of this project, I express my sincere gratitude for the
time and attention spent by the TxDOT cultural resources division, especially Jon Budd,
Scott Pletka, and Jim Abbott, in their review of the Zatopec mitigation report. The
clarity and insight of many of TxDOT’s comments is an indication of the care and effort
that went into the review of this, at times complicated report. I take their comments
as evidence of the professional commitment of that agency to improving archaeological
research carried out in the course of compliance-mandated projects in Central Texas.
Much of the complexity that characterizes parts of the Zatopec report stems from our
efforts to raise issues that are rarely, if ever addressed with prehistoric data in Texas.
Examples include exploring gendered labor roles in the past, investigating technological
consequences of different social conditions under which labor is organized, assessing
prehistoric skill differentiation, and understanding the nature of different kinds of
residential aggregation sites. These questions, while infrequently addressed in Texas,
all deal with the kinds of social relations and negotiated identities that were primary
factors in shaping the archaeological record. Rather than ignore these topics as many
others do, our goal in this project was to address them to the degree possible using a
constrained data set, and hope that by identifying these as valid research issues other
archaeologists would be motivated to respond.
In reading the condensed version of the TxDOT comments, a number of issues
are identified that likely account for the apparent reluctance to accept many of our
conclusions. Important among these is what appears as a philosophical difference of
view concerning how archaeology contributes to an understanding of the past. Another,
more fundamental difference involves the use of scalar models to pre-determine the
character or condition of some archaeological sites, in this case involving the probability
that relatively isolable deposits can exist within a site’s geologic matrix that otherwise
is comprised of mixed and compressed sediments. A number of lesser issues are also
present that reflect different preferred approaches to problems commonly encountered
when interpreting the past.
1. Concerning the philosophical objective of archaeological investigations
In my view, perhaps the most important obligation of archaeological research like
that carried out at Zatopec is documenting a basic and tenable sequence of events, or
proposing a viable cultural chronology of the site’s occupation history, that can be added
to an associated regional record. An additional priority, again in my view, should be
addressing weaknesses or shortcomings in the general understanding of prehistoric
societies. This can be accomplished by working within the parameters of current

Appendix B

494

archaeological understanding but then exploring the margins of that knowledge by
questioning certain taken-for-granted facts or established methodologies in an effort
to propose more precise, satisfying, or humanistic explanations for culture change
and human behavior. Archaeologists continually improve their view of the past not
by accepting and reiterating conclusions about how societies adapted to different
conditions, but by searching for different yet still-viable explanations for how or
why ancient peoples made certain decisions that appear as material remains in the
archaeological record.
On the basis of the TxDOT comments, however, and at the risk of oversimplification,
it appears that agency adopts the expectation that archaeology, if well done, will
produce verifiable “facts” that can be used to (re)construct a narrative of important
events that occurred in the past. These views are not starkly divergent, but they lead
to fundamentally different expectations of the veracity, usefulness, or relevance of
archaeological knowledge that is produced by projects such as this one. Regardless
of how our findings are received by the TxDOT cultural resources staff or other
archaeologists, what is at stake here is defining productive research issues for
contractors and regulators alike that can be pursued through compliance work in the
years to come.
What we identify as TxDOT’s view is reflected throughout the language of their
review. Much of TxDOT’s language mischaracterizes hypotheses, tentative conclusions
requiring additional support, and contextualizing information as statements of
fact or as specific analogous references intended to provide a one-to-one guide for
interpreting the remains from Zatopec. For example, our final chapter, Chapter 12:
Final Conclusions, presents three concluding hypotheses derived from our analyses
of multiple lines of evidence from the site. These concluding hypotheses are offered as
sound interpretations of the patterned data from Zatopec, as informed by cross-cultural
samples of ethnographic data. As hypotheses, they can not, or should not be accepted as
archaeological fact. Additionally, Chapter 1: Introduction to the Zatopec Data Recovery
Project and Research Issues frames the four research issues that were pursued in the
research. Because our approach to at least three of these issues is not easily compared
with most research in Texas, these discussions are not heavily informed by the extant
literature of Texas archaeology. Rather, our contextualizing statements rely on crosscultural examples and supporting argumentation, including from rarely-cited (by
Texas archaeologists) studies of contemporary forager behaviors found in the Human
Behavioral Ecology (HBE) literature and inspired by research showing the starkly
inegalitarian nature of hunter-gatherer social interactions, to define archaeological
correlates that researchers can focus on when they address these issues.
Our overarching theoretical orientation is patently non-processual (we use the term
“social archaeology” to describe a focus on behavioral variation potentially to the level of
individuals), which means that outcomes of this research are but one possible reading
Appendix B

495

of the evidence. Constructive dialogue involving alternative readings of this evidence
should not only be based on the presented data, but would ideally also be informed by
approximately the same theoretical expectations applied in this study. Given the theorydependent nature of data (see discussion by Johnson 1999:102), the same data sets can
be understood differently using different interpretive paradigms. Debating the validity
of competing interpretations based on altogether different understandings of what those
data “mean” can quickly become an unproductive enterprise.
In their comments, TxDOT seems not to observe that our most important findings
are presented as (concluding) hypotheses, and treats our discussion of these issues
throughout the entire report as firm conclusions that can be refuted. Moreover, they
seem not to understand or accept our statements from the perspectives we outline in
the report, and I suspect that much of their discomfort with our findings results from
this theoretical impasse. Two examples illustrate this point, and other lesser instances
are mentioned below. They note that we propose the role of women in Toyah times was
well defined: we strongly reject this statement based on the astonishing inadequacy
of available data with which to address this issue, not to mention the certainty that
several different groups comprised Toyah societies and that each probably offered
much different circumstances for its resident females. They characterize our discussion
of aggregation sites as something like a list of archaeological criteria for recognizing
these sites. In Chapter 1, we acknowledge that in the absence of written accounts there
is no certain standard of evidence that can be used to identify aggregation sites, and
our use of italics in this chapter to describe Zatopec as a kind of aggregation locale is
intended to convey the entirely relative nature of these types of sites. In Chapter 12, we
altogether concede that aggregation should be seen as a process rather than site type,
further noting that what it meant for a site to be a residential base camp surely changed
from one cultural period to the next. Our treatment of aggregation is discussed from a
different perspective below.
These two examples illustrate the response by TxDOT to what we intended as
an exploratory analyses to establish topics for consideration when investigating the
prehistoric record of Texas. Often, TxDOT seems to seek a concrete statement or fact in
our statements, while we merely intend to contextualize important issues or recommend
avenues for future work into topics that are very poorly understood. In my view,
the appropriate response would be for future researchers, including TxDOT and its
contractors, to consider the strengths and weaknesses of our concluding hypotheses not
only in relation to the supporting evidence we provide but also, and importantly, from
our perspective, and then to test these hypotheses using additional data and whatever
theoretical framework seems most productive. Undoubtedly, this exercise will result
in some modifications and improvements to our concluding hypotheses, although those
conclusions, in turn, can be evaluated and clarified by future researchers. This approach
is similar to a derivative of what Renfrew and Bahn (2008:44) call the hermeneutic

Appendix B

496

approach in archaeology; here, we observe that there can be no single, entirely complete
interpretation of the past. Rather, succeeding narratives, when constructed using
reliable data, should lead to the gradual enhancement of our understanding of the
past. Our work at Zatopec is heavily based on prior research in Central Texas, but adds
some important discussion of issues that are all but overlooked or ignored by Texas
archaeologists. We hope that future work, including projects funded or sponsored by
TxDOT, can return to these topics in a productive manner.
2. Concerning the use of scalar models for pre-determining the character of site
deposits
A large number of TxDOT’s comments stem from their skepticism of the possibility
that time-ordered, relatively unmixed sediments are present at the site. The
geoarchaeological study by Frederick (Chapter 4) fairly characterizes the ambiguous
nature of the site’s depositional history. Frederick concludes that available data
support, albeit weakly, a model for the burial of cultural materials on the site through
pedoturbation, or by root, animal, and human agency. This conclusion provides the basis
for some of the problems TxDOT identifies. Frederick also explores processes involved
in site build-up and the physical stratification of cultural materials over time, including
alluvial action from nearby Purgatory Creek, eroding and weathering of bedrock, and
colluvial slope wash. None are clearly identified, though none are refuted, and all
probably contributed in some way to the sediments that encase the site’s archaeological
record. This issue, the diffuse processes of sedimentation that contributed to poorlyresolved cultural strata, frames the other part of TxDOT’s concerns about the site and
our interpretations of its record.
Taking Frederick’s model at face value, our options were to determine whether the
processes he outlined characterized every cubic meter of the site’s deposit, or whether
pedoturbation occurred in patchy manner, with extensive but localized impacts on site
integrity. Exacerbating the problematic effects of pedoturbation were the facts that
early materials were clearly intermixed with later ones, indicating (to us) episodes
of site deflation and confirming Frederick’s reconstruction of site formation, and that
for most of the excavated unit-levels no data were recovered that indicated anything
at all about the site’s depositional character. With these two problematic issues in
mind, the appropriate “default” assumption was that site deposits were indeed mixed,
compressed, or undatable unless we had some form of chronometric or contextual data
indicating otherwise. This meant that, while accepting that Frederick’s model was valid
at the general scale of the entire site landform, localized exceptions could potentially
occur that would provide useful data for the kinds of diachronic analyses we wished to
perform. Subsequent effort was spent defining minimal stratigraphic sequences that (1)
provided some kind of temporal (technological, typological, or radiometric) data and that
(2) showed no obvious evidence for mixing or compression. The resulting analytical units

Appendix B

497

(AUs) provided the basis for our analysis of technological change over time.
Contrary to TxDOT’s comments, this does not involve a conflation of data from
across the site, as the same standards of evidence were applied in all cases in order
to define, as conservatively as possible, where artifact remains were recovered from
relatively unmixed and undisturbed levels. Nor is this a case of circular logic, as TxDOT
remarks, since the forms of technological evidence used to define these AUs were not
then the subject of comparative or behavioral analysis. Rather, they included widely
accepted time-sensitive markers such as the transition from dart to arrow points
across the Late Archaic 2-Austin interval, and the appearance of pottery in the Late
Prehistoric. I suspect some confusion here lies in our use of the term “technology” to
refer to different aspects of the prehistoric assemblage.
In our view the resulting AUs are defined with greater concern for recognizing
mixing and disturbance than virtually any of the reports that we consulted prior to
our analysis. This informal review, which included reports sponsored and presumably
endorsed by TxDOT, reveals the common practice of reconstructing horizontally bedded
layers (or zones) of occupational debris that can be placed into certain, relatively
discrete time periods. The resulting notion of “layer-cake” kinds of site strata reflects
a theoretical ideal that is not achieved at a very large number of open-air campsites in
Central Texas.
In my opinion, the problem here is that the kinds of geologic processes considered by
Frederick and other geoarchaeologists indeed apply to entire site areas. However, many
post-depositional processes that produce disturbed or mixed strata are highly localized.
Additionally, even in poorly-resolved strata, the possibility exists, and is demonstrated
at Zatopec, that small areas of time-ordered deposits are present. This is a scalar
issue involving how archaeologists pre-determine the potential for a site to contribute
meaningful data for addressing important issues. This issue pervades many site reports;
we commonly noted the inclusion of disturbed strata or contexts, errant or reversed
dates, and remains that were completely undated except by tenuous association with
nearby contexts in analytical units supposedly reflecting periods of occupation. Another
related issue we encountered was the occasional reconstruction of occupation periods
that are of such duration, exceeding 2000 years in cases (approximately 67 30-year
human generations), that they barely reflect any particular cultural activity except
making stone tools and heating limestone cobbles.
I strongly concur with TxDOT that Zatopec, in general, reflects a poorly stratified
cultural sequence. However, no empirical data is available to indicate that any
particular unit included in our analysis contained mixed, compressed, disturbed,
or otherwise compromised data. Rather, our temporally-based collections, which
unfortunately omit recorded features that could not be dated, isolates the notion of
cultural stratigraphy from physical strata and prioritizes temporal control when

defining cultural components.
3. Concerning other issues
Throughout their commentary, TxDOT seems to confuse or conflate certain aspects
of our argument. As an author and primary editor of the report, I accept responsibility
for awkward phrasing and unclear linkages between ideas and data. In other cases,
however, TxDOT seems to have overlooked important nuances in our presentation that
deserve mention. It is probably the case that their reading reflects, at least to some
degree, different theoretical perspectives on these kinds of data and what they should
mean to archaeologists. As such, lengthy rebuttals to these particular comments may
not be particularly useful, but hopefully will emphasize that different interpretations
can be derived from alternative theoretical frameworks.

TxDOT remarks that an occupation history of once every 50-100 years, a tentative
reconstruction of visitation periodicity based on an admittedly limited sample of
radiocarbon dates, is difficult to reconcile with our notion of Zatopec as an aggregation
site. In Chapter 5 we used radiocarbon data to suggest changes in site occupation
periodicity, from approximately once every 100 years in Late Archaic 2/Austin times
to once every 50 or so years in Toyah times. The important point here is what appears
to be a change in the frequency of site visits. Do other sites with similar temporal
components exhibit this same change in occupational frequency? The answer is
currently unknown, since to my knowledge radiocarbon data have never been used
in this region to reconstruct site visitation periodicity, in spite of the fact that several
mitigated sites in Central Texas boast radiocarbon records of many dozens of potentially
useful assays. If future research finds that, indeed, some Toyah sites were occupied
more frequently and at shorter intervals than in previous periods, much support
would be available for current models (e.g., Mauldin et al. 2010) concerning changes
in Toyah subsistence and settlement patterns in relation to earlier periods. I would be
encouraged to see TxDOT and other agencies and firms explore uses of radiocarbon data
beyond merely dating some site’s deposits in order to reconstruct zones or horizons of
contemporaneous occupation.
3b. radiocarbon data: bison dates
A large number (n=11 of 26) of the site’s radiocarbon data are direct assays on
bison bone. Our rationales for reconstructing the presence of bison through direct
dating rather than by loose archaeological association were to evaluate the accuracy of
models of periods of regional bison presence, and to chart, more specifically, when bison
hunting was important at Zatopec. Our results suggest that a great deal more temporal
specificity can be added to regional models of bison exploitation if archaeologists
recognize that dating by association yields, at best, imprecise results in terms of dating

Appendix B

499

bison hunting events. At worst, given degrees of mixing and other disturbances that are
commonly present on open air camps sites (including Zatopec), dating bison presence by
association can produce frankly inaccurate results.
For our analysis, we wanted to establish a chronology of bison exploitation that
could be compared with technological sequences, cross-dated using typological markers,
in order to determine when individuals involved in bison hunting may have adopted
new technological strategies, perhaps emphasizing flamboyant designs, or engaged
in different forms of sharing knowledge and experience with potential competitors.
Our results indicate that most apparent bison hunting at Zatopec occurred during
Toyah times (the fact that only one date came back as pre-Toyah is probably related
to poor organic preservation at the site, providing partial confirmation for Frederick’s
conclusions about site formation processes), contributing significantly to our
technological data for tool design and usage during this period when compared with
earlier times.
Additionally, a single assay was returned that appears to be Spanish Colonial in age.
This date seems to corroborate the ephemeral cultural presence on the site indicated
by the Black Luster Glaze ware sherd recovered during earlier excavations. Finding
mission-era locales that are outside actual mission contexts in Central and South Texas
is exceedingly problematic, and this result indicates the potential utility of directly
dating bison remains for reasons other than understanding prehistoric technological
behaviors.
Regarding the value of direct bison dates, TxDOT remarks only that it is possible
that many of the Toyah dates represent only a single individual; other contributions
from this dating program are unrecognized. I acknowledge that their suggestion may
be true, even if it can not be proven. However, because it remains unproven, it does not
undermine the validity of interpretations that are based in part on the number of Toyah
bison dates. Importantly, as more direct bison assays become available over time, not
only will site-specific periods of bison hunting become clear, the aggregate number of
bison dates should generally reflect periods of bison abundance (as opposed to simple
presence), an aspect of reconstructing prehistoric bison demography that is notoriously
difficult to get at with archaeological data.
3c. bison as a food resource and more
Our analyses of faunal remains is predicated in part on the understanding that
bison is not only a highly ranked food resource, but also that big game hunting is
frequently attended by different forms of social interaction and engagement than
accompany the recovery or exploitation of small-bodied prey. Implications exist not only
for gendered labor roles, but also for status competition between males who engaged
in this activity. A recent publication by Gurven and Hill (2009) clearly explains the
complexity of motivations for male hunting, and our review of this particular research

Appendix B

500

finds this article by far the most comprehensive and compelling available discussion
of this issue. Using optimal foraging theory, TxDOT offers the counter scenario that,
since bison are highly ranked, they will be exploited when present and that smaller,
lower-ranked resources will experience a related decline in these periods. In my view,
the optimal foraging explanation fails to accommodate all possible human responses
of interest. Our data show that smaller taxa indeed decline in number when bison are
abundant at Zatopec but also that other, non-dependent differences occur with deer/
antelope frequency. Moreover, when viewed in conjunction with other lines of evidence,
several conclusions can be drawn from the data that exceed the explanations capable
with optimal foraging theory. An important one is that patterns of food sharing, both
at Zatopec and at Wilson-Leonard, seem to become less equitable in certain ways
when bison are an important part of the diet. Another one involves comparing our
bison chronology for the site against technological data, specifically the expressed
skill variation in Perdiz points, to construct hypotheses concerning real changes in
how points are made by low-, medium-, and highly-skilled knappers. The point of our
analysis isn’t simply that bison are hunted when available and lower-ranked taxa
decline during these times, but that some people hunt bison when they are available
while other hunters perhaps remained focused on deer/antelope, that some bison
hunters develop and express technological aptitudes in different ways, and that basic
access to important food resources may become unevenly shared. A general statement
that can be posited and that accounts for all of these trends is that the presence of
bison corresponds with an increase in different forms of status competition and perhaps
display between at least some prehistoric band members in Toyah times at Zatopec.
The optimal foraging scenario offered by TxDOT as an alternative explanation of our
faunal data fails to accommodate the fullest range of human behaviors involving status
competition and other motivations for procuring large game.
In addition to alternate ways of viewing the bison data, TxDOT suggest other
explanations for the presence of the recognized elements at Zatopec. We find the
suggestion that low-value parts are less likely to be transported because of their low
value problematic in light of the fact that so many elements at Zatopec are low-value
but were clearly transported to the site once these animals were killed elsewhere.
Taphonomic bias against lighter bones, presumably associated with smaller-bodied
prey, is a viable explanation for our faunal recovery patterns involving small game,
yet does not explain the low utility indices recorded using robust elements nor does it
explain the changes in utility indices of deer vs. bison during certain periods.
3d. aggregation sites
In my personal opinion, there are clearly examples of macro-band aggregation sites,
in the fullest meaning of that term, in Central Texas. One outstanding example based
on historic accounts is the Spring Lake area of San Marcos. Others would include other

Appendix B

501

spring sites along the Balcones Escarpment as well as, perhaps, large cemetery sites
on the Coastal Plain reflecting cultural continuity and serial visitation by multiple
bands over centuries and millennia. Gault may be another example, at least for Clovis
times. Identifying Zatopec as an aggregation site of this magnitude is a problematic
assertion, and we do not intentionally make that claim in this report. In Chapter 12,
we even note that aggregation should be viewed as a process rather than site type.
However, we raise this issue for three important reasons. First, I think it is important
for archaeologists to begin delineating or distinguishing between residential base camps
that vary in qualitative as well as quantitative ways. This work may help predict with
greater accuracy what kinds of sites are likely to contain small prehistoric cemeteries
like the one at Zatopec. Second, by defining certain outstanding examples of aggregation
localities in Central Texas, central places to which macrobands returned over and over,
archaeologists can start constructing historical narratives of the region that are tied to
specific places that clearly were important to prehistoric peoples. Finally, in historical
perspective, we address aggregation at Zatopec as a way to begin informing our own
understanding of this issue in preparation for important work at the complex of sites
known as Spring Lake. Clearly Zatopec was not an aggregation locale at the scale of
Spring Lake. Yet archaeological data clearly show that bands gathered here repeatedly
over a long period of time.
To be clear, we do not believe (1) that Zatopec was an aggregation locale for all time
periods or (2) that important activities did not change over time at this (or other) site(s).
I furthermore do not believe that Zatopec even offers an outstanding example of an
aggregation site for any particular time period. Nevertheless, the evidence of a burial
tradition across the Late Archaic 2/Austin intervals clearly indicates cultural continuity
and serial visitation; in fact, the three fully excavated burials perfectly bracket the dates
for these archaeological time periods. This continuity is underscored by the clustering
of radiocarbon assays during the period of ca. AD 600-1000 (see Figure 5-25). These
burials, along with some other feature data, indicate site reuse and the maintenance
of certain activity areas from one visitation to the next, both of which are identified as
traits common to some aggregation locales.
TxDOT’s discussion of “required” measures for independently confirming that a site
was the location of aggregations is assuring, but also slightly confusing. On one hand, it
confirms our conclusion that aggregation sites are exceedingly difficult to define using
only archaeological criteria. On the other hand, it seems to reflect a view that the goal
of archaeologists with respect to this issue should be to confidently identify, rather
than hypothesize and test, which sites were aggregation sites. It also seems to overlook
our contention that aggregation should be understood, at least in most cases, as an
important stage in settlement-subsistence cycles and that variation in aggregationrelated behaviors may prove a useful way to distinguish between different kinds of
residential base camps.

Appendix B

502

3e. gender
I concur with TxDOT’s conclusion that our discussion of gender roles at the site
suffers in many important ways. Frankly, we found no perfectly satisfactory way of
dealing with this issue using limited, problematic, and constrained archaeological data.
Certain gender-related tendencies are clearly defined in the ethnographic record and we
rely heavily on the robust cross-cultural sample presented in Chapter 1 to inform our
interpretations. However, exceptions or important variations to these can also be found.
With respect to this issue, our analysis of the human remains themselves, potentially
the greatest source of actual data concerning sexed labor roles of site occupants, focused
instead on identification issues stemming from the project’s requirements under the
Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). Hopefully future
work can provide missing data that may be present on these individuals.
Quibbles with our selection of ethnographic examples aside, I would like to see
our concluding hypothesis that, during Toyah times, women’s labor increased in
its drudgery, evaluated elsewhere and disproven with archaeological data. In this
particular regard, historical accounts describing women’s labor roles with respect to
bison were recorded by Cabeza de Vaca (Krieger 2002), and summarized by HabichtMauche (2005). Collectively, these accounts document precisely these kinds of working
conditions that we hypothesized to have existed in terminal Late Prehistoric times as
well. In my view, this is one topic that Toyah studies are ideally situated to address,
given Toyah’s proximity to historical accounts describe gendered labor in the region
under conditions of intensive commercialization of bison products for economic gain.
If archaeological narratives can reliably build on and proceed from advances in
understanding made by prior studies, then I think the work by Arnn (2008) linking
Toyah social patterns and practices with the immediately following historical period will
make significant contributions to Texas archaeology. Bridging this minor temporal gap,
however, will require a certain measure of faith in the strength of cultural continuity of
the region, as well as conceding that Toyah “society” was actually comprised of several
distinct ethnic groups.
Concerning our assessment of women’s role in technological change, this is
admittedly a problematic connection. Beyond documenting the marked increase in
expedient tool use, measured in absolute and relative numbers of recovered tools,
tool use intensity, potential-to-actual utility (PEM:TEM ratios), and the increase in
scavenged flakes to use as tools in Toyah times compared with earlier periods, one
of the most compelling conclusions from our analysis is the documented technological
separation in terms of bifacial approaches to tool-making, specifically flake cores, at
this time. Here, our analysis of “technology” relies on more than merely tool design,
functionality, or use, but combines all of these factors and considers them from a
perspective informed by the historical record of our project area. One could interpret
these trends to mean that at least some women were alienated from bifacial approaches
Appendix B

503

to tool design but compensated in other ways. Indeed, based on the historical record of
how males and females divided their labor around bison processing, and of how some
women’s labor was viewed as a commodity to be controlled by some males, we offer this
statement as one of our concluding hypotheses.
With respect to Toyah gender, we simply prefer a hypothesized explanation
that incorporates all available data and that is also informed by a specific historical
narrative from a reasonably proximate period of time. TxDOT’s suggestions to the
contrary, such as the expectation that tools used in different contexts would not be
made in a similar fashion, seems to be based on their expectations of what toolkits
should look like rather than on documented technological similarities that define any
particular site assemblage. However, in terms of how this research can be improved
upon in the future, I strongly agree with their observation that similar studies include
more specific evidence linking the usage of certain kinds of informal tools tasks involved
with processing bison. In our analysis, we generally lumped many classes of informal
tools without detailed attention to possible variation in their uses or how this may
have affected their design. Additionally, I suggest that comparative analysis on flake
cores from other Toyah assemblages may help us understand this issue, although
our literature review showed that flake cores are rarely given the kinds of analytical
attention necessary to document the kinds of technological changes we identify.
Concluding remarks
As noted, I deeply appreciate the efforts of the TxDOT cultural resources staff
in reviewing our report. Naturally, I do not agree with all of their comments, and
find some of them based on particularistic quibbles that do not directly deal with the
entirety of our argument. I attribute some of these to theoretical or philosophical
differences regarding the production of archaeological knowledge, while others reflect
different understandings of this site’s potential to contain isolable components that can
provide the basis for comparative analyses. Nevertheless, the opportunity to discuss
and respond to these comments is a constructive way of defining and addressing, and
perhaps clarifying areas of disagreement or responding to questions that may have
arisen through the review process. I appreciate the opportunity to respond to TxDOT’s
comments, as well as the support and interest shown by TxDOT in our work at Zatopec,
and I recognize their continued efforts to improve the overall quality of archaeology
performed in the state.

Gower. The Gower dart point was identified as a distinct type by Shafer (1963). It
is defined as a crudely made point that is generally short with weak shoulders. The
stem has parallel sides and can be up to one-half the length of the blade. They have
deeply concave bases produced by the removal of a single large flake. Occasionally, the
concavity is retouched (Shafer 1963; Turner and Hester 1993). These points are from
the Early Archaic, San Geronimo (Early) Phase, 8000–6750 B.P. (Prewitt 1981a).

Hoxie. The Hoxie dart point was long considered part of the Darl and Zephyr point
group; however, Prewitt (1981b) identified it as a distinct type, based primarily on its
association with known Early Archaic artifacts. It is a long slender triangular point
with crude flaking and an alternatively beveled blade. The shoulders are distinctly
square though not barbed. The stems are generally parallel with squared or slightly
concave bases and can be alternatively beveled. In some cases stems are extremely
long—up to one-fourth of the length of the point. The diagnostic characteristic of
the Hoxie point is that the stem edges always exhibit some degree of smoothing or
grinding (Prewitt 1981b). These points date to the Early Archaic, San Geronimo
(Early) Phase, 8000–6750 B.P. (Prewitt 1981a).

Bandy. The lateral edges of the Bandy dart point range from gently convex to slightly
recurved. It is corner notched with narrow “V”-shaped notches which produce a
slightly expanding stem with strong barbs (Turner and Hester 1993). Bases are gently
concave and have a fishtail appearance. The smallest specimens approach arrow
points in size. They are usually very well made (Word & Douglas 1970). The Bandy
point is placed in the Early Archaic, ca. 6000–4000 B.C. (Shafer and Bryant 1977).
While not a diagnostic point for Central Texas, Bandy is found within the Early to
Late San Geronimo Phase, 8000–5750 B.P. (Prewitt 1981a).

San Geronimo (Late) Phase
Martindale. The Martindale is a triangular dart point that usually has convex lateral
edges ranging from 3.5 to 7 cm in length. The shoulders are prominent and well
barbed though barbs do not extend all the way to the base. It is typically from 2.5
to 4.5 cm wide. The stems range from nearly parallel to strongly expanding and are
between 2 and 3.5 cm wide. The diagnostic feature of this blade is its fishtail base
caused by two distinct convex curves meeting in a central depression (Suhm and Jelks
1962). The Martindale point dates to the Early Archaic, San Geronimo (Late) Phase,
6750–5750 B.P., and extends through the Jarrell Phase(5750–5000 B.P.) of the Middle
Archaic (Prewitt 1981a; 2007).

Uvalde. The Uvalde dart point has a triangular to lanceolate blade with typically
convex edges. It varies between 4 and 10 cm with an average length of 6 cm. It has
prominent shoulders that can be either rounded or barbed with a width between 2
and 3.5 cm. The stem expands widely, sometimes as wide as the shoulders. The base
has a large concavity similar to Pedernales points, but the stems are shorter and
flare outward more (Suhm and Jelks 1962: 255). This category can be very broad and
may include specimens that were previously typed as Early Corner Notched or Baker
(Turner and Hester 1993). The Uvalde point is from the Early Archaic, San Geronimo
(Late) Phase, 6750–5750 B.P. (Prewitt 1981a; 2007).

Middle Archaic
Arenosa. The Arenosa dart point was first named by Leland Bement (1991). It is very
similar to Langtry and Val Verde types and in older (pre-1991) literature it may be
referred to as Langtry Dart Point Variant 3 first identified by Schuetz (1956). It is
characterized by a triangular blade, with straight to slightly concave or recurved
lateral edges. In rare cases they can be convex. The points are generally exceedingly
thin and finely flaked. They are barbed, usually with square or occaisionally with
incipient barbs (Schuetz 1956). Stem attributes are the primary way to distinguish
it from Langtry or Val Verde. The stems are sharply contracting with a pointed or
convex base. Stems and bases are usually not beveled (Bement 1991). This point dates
to the Middle Archaic between 3500–1000 B.C. (Jelks 1978). It does not currently have
a placement within the Central Texas Chronological sequence (Prewitt 1981a; 2007).

Oakalla Phase
Early Triangular. There has been a lot of general confusion over the typing of Early
Triangular dart points. The following type names may have all been used to describe
these artifacts: Taylor Thinned Base and Baird beveled blade, which were later
shortened to Taylor and Baird (Kelley 1947; Turner and Hester 1993), Tortugas
(Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks 1954), and finally Early Triangular (Turner and Hester
1993). Black and McGraw see no distinction in the Baird and Taylor forms, arguing
that they are actually knives that change shape due to repeated retouch and beveling
over time (1985: 130). Prewitt (1995), however, maintains Baird and Taylor as
separate categories, with Baird being the alternately right-side beveled blade and
Taylor as the wider, more equilateral form. For this analysis, no distinction was made
and all were typed as Early Triangular by Elton Prewitt. This point ranges from a
thin triangular form to nearly equilateral triangle in size. They are characterized
by parallel bifacial flaking. They may also be bifacially or unifacially retouched, or
right-side beveled on both faces. The bases are generally concave, and they can range
from very thin to irregularly thinned (Black and McGraw 1985: 129). They date to the
Middle Archaic, Oakalla Phase, from 5000–4500 B.P. (Prewitt 1981a).

Clear Fork Phase
La Jita. The La Jita is a narrow triangular dart point with edges ranging from convex
to straight. It has slight shoulders with rounded edges. The diagnostic feature of
this point is its stem, which expands slightly and is rounded. It may be alternatively
beveled but lacks the steep beveling of the Nolan points (Black and McGraw 1985).
Turner and Hester (1993) suggest that this may be an unfinished Nolan point, and
these points have been noted to grade into Nolan points at certain sites (Black and
McGraw 1985: 119). This point may be called Medina in some literature of the early
1980s (e.g., Carroll 1983). The association with Nolan points tentatively places La Jita
in the Middle Archaic, Clear Fork Phase, 4500–4000 B.P.

Travis. The Travis dart point is a slender triangular blade with rounded shoulders.
The lateral edges are typically straight but occasionally convex which may give the
blade a leaf-shape appearance. The length ranges from 4.5 to 9 cm and the width from
2 to 2.5 cm. The stem is usually square with parallel sides and is 1.5 to 2 cm wide.
Stem length is typically uniform at 1.5 to 2 cm (Suhm and Jelks 1962: 251). Some
Travis points have been classified as Buda, but these are now believed to be a local
variation of the Travis point (Turner and Hester 1993). The Travis point dates to the
Middle Archaic, Clear Fork Phase, 4500–4000 B.P. and extends into the Marshall
Ford Phase (Prewitt 1981a).

Late Archaic I
Marshall Ford Phase
Bulverde. This dart point is from the Marshall Ford phase in the Late Archaic I,
4000–3400B.P. (Prewitt 1981a). The Bulverde point is usually triangular with straight
to slightly convex edges, ranging from 4.5 to 9 cm in length. The shoulders are
sometimes squared, but usually have short barbs. The stem is very wide, occasionally
greater than ½ of the width of the point and is usually straight (Suhm and Jelks 1962:
169).. The most diagnostic section of this point is its wedge shaped base. The stem is
finely flaked on all sides creating a very sharp base.

Round Rock Phase
Pedernales. The Pedernales dart point exhibits a wide range of variation in both
shape and size. It can be narrow, broad and leaf-shaped, or triangular depending on
how it has been reworked. Its shoulders can be weak, abrupt right-angled, or strongly
barbed. It can range from 3 to 13 cm in length and 3 to 5 cm in width (Suhm and Jelks
1962). It is possible that the larger specimens are not completed points, but rather
earlier Pedernales bifacial forms in the process of reduction (Ensor and Mueller-Wille
1988: 167-8). The Pedernales is typified by a relatively parallel stem with a deeply
concave base formed by the removal of two or three small longitudinal flakes or one
single larger flake from both faces of the basal edge.. (Suhm and Jelks 1962; Turner
and Hester 1993). This point dates to the Late Archaic I, Round Rock Phase, 3400–
2600 B.P. (Prewitt 1981a).

San Marcos Phase
Lange. The Lange dart point is a large triangular blade with straight to convex lateral
edges that ranges from 5 to 8.5 cm in length. It has prominent shoulders that are
often well barbed and are between 2.7 and 4 cm wide. The stem edges expand and
average 1.7 to 2.5 cm wide at the base. The basal edge is typically square though it
may be more or less concave (Suhm and Jelks 1962). It has been noted that many have
prominent shoulders but lack barbing (Black and McGraw 1985: 109). The points date
to the Late Archaic I, San Marcos phase, 2600–2250 B.P., though they can range into
the Uvalde Phase of the Late Archaic II (Prewitt 1981a).

Marshall. The Marshall is a massive dart point ranging from 5 to 11.5 cm in length
and 3 to 5 cm in width. The lateral edges vary from nearly straight to strongly convex.
The shoulders are strongly barbed with the largest barbs being in line with the basal
edge. Basal notching creates parallel or slightly expanding stems which are 1.2 to 2.5
cm wide. The stem is often short in comparison to the blade, being as little as 1/8 of
the total length (Suhm and Jelks 1962). The Marshall point is from the Late Archaic
I, San Marcos phase, 2600–2250 B.P. and extends into the Uvalde Phase (Prewitt
1981a).

Castroville. The Castroville dart point has a large triangular body that ranges from 5
to 10 cm in length. The width ranges from 3 to 6 cm. It is characterized by its broad
straight stem and its usually straight lateral edges. It often has massive barbs formed
by basal notching that can extend to be in-line with the base. The stem is very broad,
ranging from 2.4 to 3.6 cm in width at the base. The base is usually slightly convex
(Suhm and Jelks 1962: 173; Turner and Hester 1993). The Castroville point is from
the Late Archaic II, Uvalde Phase, 2250–1750B.P. (Prewitt 1981a).

Marcos. The Marcos dart point is a broad triangular blade ranging from 3 to 4.5 cm
across the barbs. It can vary dramatically in length from 4.5 to 10 cm. It is strongly
barbed with deep corner notching that angles inward at 45 degrees creating a strongly
expanding stem with a straight to convex base. The stem is consistently 1 cm long
(Suhm and Jelks 1962). It can be easily confused with Castroville points, but the
base is usually more sharply expanding. The Marcos point dates to the Late Archaic
II, Uvalde Phase, 2250–1750 B.P. and extends into the Twin Sisters Phase (Prewitt
1981a).

ranges from 4 to 10 cm and the width from 3 to 5 cm. It has pronounced shoulders that
are either square or barbed. The diagnostic feature of the Montell point is a bifurcated
stem caused by a long V-shaped basal notch that often runs the length of the stem
(Suhm and Jelks 1962). The stem ranges from parallel to expanding and is between 2
and 3 cm wide. The Montell point dates to the Late Archaic II, Uvalde Phase, 2250–
1750B.P. and extends into the Twin Sisters Phase (Prewitt 1981a).

Edgewood. The Edgewood dart point is a short triangular blade that ranges from 3 to
5 cm in length. The lateral edges are usually convex with a maximum width of 2 to 3
cm. The point has prominent to well barbed shoulders resulting from corner notching.
The stem expands sharply, making the base almost as wide as the shoulders with an
average width between 1.5 and 2 cm (Suhm and Jelks 1962). The Edgewood point
dates to the Late Archaic II, Twin Sisters Phase, 1750–1400 BP (Prewitt 1981a).

Ellis. The Ellis dart point is typically a short, triangular blade that is between 3 and
5 cm in length. It has prominent shoulders and shallow corner notches. The blade is
typically very thick, and it is often crudely flaked (Turner and Hester 1993: 113). The
width across the shoulders ranges from 2 to 3 cm. It has a long, expanding stem that
is typically ½ to ¼ of the total point length. The base never extends as wide as the
shoulders and averages 1.5 cm wide (Suhm and Jelks 1962). Turner and Hester (1993)
note that this point is easily confused with the Edgewood and Zavala types. This point
is from the Late Archaic II, Twin Sisters Phase, 1750–1400 BP (Prewitt 1981a).

Ensor. The Ensor dart point is fairly difficult to type because of variations in its length
and width. It can range from 3 to 7 cm in length and 2 to 3 cm in width (Suhm and
Jelks 1962: 189). It is a triangular point with usually straight sides. The shoulders are
prominent and often squared but can be barbed. It is most often side notched which
results in a wide base and a basal edge is in line with the shoulder. The bases are
usually squared, and the stem is not more than 1 cm in length (Suhm and Jelks 1962).
The stem neck is comparatively wide, but is thinner on corner notched varieties. It
often exhibits signs of heat-treatment (Black and McGraw 1985). The Ensor point is
from the Late Archaic II, Twin Sisters Phase, 1750–1400 BP (Prewitt 1981a).

Fairland. Fairland dart points are wide triangular blades with shallow side notching.
They range from 3.5 to 7 cm in length and have narrow shoulders that are 2 to 3 cm
wide. The base is strongly expanding being as wide, or wider, than the shoulders.
The diagnostic characteristic of this Fairland is its wide, deep concavity that is finely
flaked. This usually creates a very sharp base (Suhm and Jelks 1962). The Fairland
point dates to the Late Archaic II, Twin Sisters Phase, 1750–1400 BP (Prewitt 1981a).

Frio. Frio dart points have a narrow triangular outline. The lateral edges are usually
straight with prominent squared or down-turned (slightly barbed) shoulders. All
Frio points have U-shaped side or corner notches. They range in length from 3 to 7
cm, and the width across the shoulders is typically from 2 to 4 cm. The stem expands
rapidly and is often as wide, or wider, than the shoulders. Many specimens are heattreated (Suhm and Jelks 1962; Black and McGraw 1985). The diagnostic marker to
these points is a bifurcated stem which results from side and basal notches (Black and
McGraw 1985: 104). There is a consistent gradation between Frio and Ensor points
resulting in some typological problems. The Frio point is from the Late Archaic II,
Twin Sisters Phase, 1750–1400 BP (Prewitt 1981a).

Driftwood Phase
Darl. The Darl dart point is a long, slender, triangular blade that exhibits careful
flaking around the point. It ranges in length from 2.5 to 7 cm and in width from 1 to
1.5 cm. It is shouldered, but there is considerable variation in the size of shoulders.
Blade edges are often steeply beveled and are occasionally finely serrated. The stems
range from ½ to 1/6 of the total length and vary from parallel to flared edges. The
diagnostic characteristic is parallel oblique flaking that creates a ribbon-like effect.
The Darl point originates in the Late Archaic II, Driftwood Phase (1400–1250 B.P.),
though it can be found well into the Austin Phase (Prewitt 1981a).

Untypable Dart Points
This category includes mostly highly fragmented pieces from dart points. There were
a total of 194 specimens collected. They were separated into five categories: medial
dart point fragment, dart point barb fragment, distal dart point fragments, untypable
dart point stems, and untypable dart points. The untypable dart point assemblage
contained 26 specimens, of which six are described below (see fig).
Specimen 133-1 (fig) was found in XU15, Level 2 which loosely places this point in
the Early Archaic. It is a narrow triangular point with slightly convex lateral edges.
It has short barbs from corner notching. It is missing its distal tip and its stem from
impact fracturing which makes it untypable. Even lacking these elements, it is long
and wide for its thickness (87.08mm x 36.49mm x 8.04mm). Flaking is random with
mostly feather terminations. There is one small stack formation on its dorsal face near
the stem. The lateral edges are straight yet sinuous and exhibit some macroscopic usewear. Overall, this is a very well made point. Though Using the general criteria for
skill from Bamforth and Finlay (2008) this point is a skill level 4.
Specimen 177-2 (fig) could probably be forced into a type, but the reworking on the
stem makes classification too uncertain. It was found in XU18, level 1. It is a narrow
triangular point with straight, slightly asymmetrical lateral edges. It was barbed, but
both barbs have been removed by retouch. The stem is short and thin with a straight
basal edge. Retouch has obscured most of the original face. There is a mix of step and
feather terminations, so this artifact would be classified as skill level 3.
Surface scraping also produced multiple points. Specimen 1180-7 (fig) is a narrow
triangular point with rounded shoulders and a short stem. Part of the stem has been
removed making typing of this artifact impossible. It has very poor retouch along both
lateral edges with very large step terminations. This point would be classified as level
2.
Specimen 182-3 (fig) was found in XU 19, level 3 which places it roughly in the Late
Archaic II phase. It is a narrow triangular blade that has short barbs. Like most of the
untypable points, it is missing its basal edge. Both stem and distal tip were lost due
to impact fracturing. It has a very regular cross section and is alternatively beveled.
Both original flaking and retouch are very fine. The retouching creates a finely
serrated edge. This blade is classified as skill level 5.
The last two specimens worth noting, 132-1 and 1180-3, have a similar morphology
(figs). They are both wide triangular blades with slightly convex lateral edges.

Appendix E

532

Specimen 1180-3 has prominent shoulders that are slightly rounded. There is a
perverse snap fracture that removed one of the shoulders, half the stem, and the
entire basal edge. There is collateral flaking on the dorsal face. The flaking on the
ventral face is fairly well accomplished but lacks patterning. This is classified as skill
level 5. Specimen 132-1 has slightly down-turned shoulders and a very wide neck.
The basal edge was lost from thermal damage. It is thicker than 1180-3 and lacks fine
regular flaking. There are several failed flake removals, so it is a skill level 3.
Late Pre-Historic
Austin Phase
Bonham. The Bonham arrow point was referred to as Bonham barbed by Krieger
(1946). It is a slender triangular blade ranging from 2 cm to 4.5 cm in length. The
lateral edges are usually straight with a width that does not exceed 2 cm. Shoulders
are sometimes squared but usually have small barbs. The stem is narrow and parallel
edged and ranges from 0.5 to 0.7 cm in length. The base is straight or slightly convex
(Suhm and Jelks 1962: 267). The Bonham point dates to the Late Prehistoric and
ranges from 800–1200A.D. (Turner and Hester 1993). It falls within the Austin Phase
of Central Texas, though it is not a diagnostic point for this area (Prewitt 1981a).

Edwards. The Edwards arrow point is one of the largest arrow points found in Texas.
It is triangular with straight to convex lateral edges. It has prominent shoulders that
are usually well barbed from corner or side notching. The stem is rapidly expanding
and is symmetrically downturned, forming a concave base. The basal edge can range
from slight to V-shaped. Many of these points are serrated along the blade and exhibit
signs of heat treatment (Black and McGraw 1985). It has been suggested that this
point is slightly older than the Scallorn point based on stratigraphic excavations
(Lukowski 1987). While it is not diagnostic for Central Texas, the relationship with
Scallorn tentatively places Edwards in the Austin Phase of the Late Pre-historic
1250–650 B.P. (Prewitt 1981a).

Fresno. The Fresno is a stemless arrow point, usually in the shape of a simple
triangle. The lateral edges are generally straight and are finely flaked on both sides.
In rare cases they may even be serrated. They range in length from 2 to 3.5 cm and
in width from 1 to 2 cm. They have a square base (Suhm and Jelks 1962). Suhm and
Jelks also report that some are unifacially modified flakes with the ventral side being
only the smooth fracture plane. The Fresno is a diagnostic point for the Antelope
Creek Phase in the Texas Panhandle. In Central Texas it is found in the Austin or
Early Toyah cultural phases, 1250–400 B.P. (Prewitt 1981a).

Scallorn. The Scallorn arrow point is a small triangular point with straight or slightly
convex lateral edges which range from 2.5 to 4.5 cm in length. The shoulders are
usually well barbed from corner notching and range from 1.5 to 2 cm in width. The
stem expands sharply, up to the width of the shoulders. The base can be square,
convex, or concave (Suhm and Jelks 1962). Its edges are often finely serrated (Turner
and Hester 1993). The Scallorn dates to the Late Prehistoric, Austin Phase, 1250–650
B.P. (Prewitt 1981a).

Cliffton. The Cliffton arrow point was originally referred to as the Cliffton Contracting
Stem by Krieger (1946). It is crudely chipped and often only unifacially modified.
Its length ranges from 2 to 4 cm while the width does not vary much beyond the 1.5
to 2 cm range. It has shoulders but they are not clearly defined. The stem is either
pointed or contracting and is usually very short (Suhm and Jelks 1962: 269). Turner
and Hester (1993) maintain that Cliffton points are not a true type but rather an
unfinished Perdiz point. The Cliffton point is from the Late Prehistoric, Toyah Phase,
650–200 B.P. (Prewitt 1981a).

Cuney. The Cuney arrow point is a long, narrow, triangular point with straight
or slightly recurved lateral edges. It ranges in length from approximately 2 to 4.5
cm with a width between 1 and 2 cm. It has long barbs that extend downward or
flare outward. Its stem is parallel or slightly expanding with both width and length
between 0.4 and 0.7 cm. The base is usually notched or is slightly concave (Suhm
and Jelks 1962: 271; Turner and Hester 1993). The Cuney point dates from the Late
Prehistoric to the Historic period, Toyah Phase, 650–200 B.P. (Prewitt 1981a).

Perdiz. The Perdiz arrow point exhibits more variation in size and proportions than
most projectile points found within Texas. It has a triangular blade with very straight
edges and ranges from 1.5 to 6 cm in length. Though the longer specimens exceed the
typical range for arrow points, they are much thinner and lighter than dart points
of equivalent length. The shoulders are usually well-barbed, so the width ranges
from 1.2 to 3 cm. The stem is contracting, often to a sharp base. Finally, some are
unifacially worked rather than bifacial (Suhm and Jelks 1962), so they can grade into
Cliffton points (Turner and Hester 1993). The Perdiz dates to the Late Pre-historic,

Untypable Arrow Points
There are a total of 71 arrow point fragments sorted into medial, distal, barb, and
complete categories. There are only 3 complete yet untypable arrow points in this
assemblage (fig). Specimen 204-1 was found in XU21, level 2. The blade seems to be
similar to Cuney or possibly Bonham; however, retouch has altered the stem so that
it lacks the clear diagnostics necessary for either of these two types. It is a narrow
triangular blade with one straight edge, and one slightly recurved lateral edge. The
recurved lateral edge has a flared bard that exhibits thermal damage. The straight
lateral edge has evidently been retouched and has a rounded shoulder. There is
thermal damage on the ventral face. Both faces exhibit a collateral flaking pattern.
Using the generalized skill criteria (Bamforth and Finaly 2008), this projectile point
would be a level 4 or 5 with a slightly lower ranking for its retouch skill.

Appendix E

536

Both specimen 93-1 and specimen 1123-4 are likely expedient projectile points.
Both are made from flakes with slight edge modification on the blade and pressure
flaking to create the stem. Specimen 1123-4 is a short, wide triangular point with an
alternating beveled edge. The bulb of percussion is still evident on the distal tip of
the ventral face. The dorsal face has three scars that traverse the full length of the
longitudinal axis. It is possible that this point was removed from a blade core, though
the missing basal edge makes this conclusion uncertain. Overall, lot 1123-4 is a skill
level 2.
Like the previous specimen, 93-1 is alternatively beveled but lacks other edge
modification. The beveling only extends halfway down either lateral edge from the
distal tip. The stem is highly asymmetrical and was formed by quick pressure flaking.
Unlike the previous specimen, 93-1 is very thin. Overall, the specimen has a rough
basic symmetry. Since it would be hard to flake this piece without breaking the
artifact, it is classed at skill level 4.

Results

of

Texas A&M Pollen Study

by Dawn M. Marshall and Tim E. Riley
The current study focuses on nine pollen samples collected from Zatopec. Eight pollen
samples were collected from a column located at N1004.5, E996.4 and one sample was
collected from the pelvic region of human remains, location N1006 E997. Each of these
samples was submitted to the Palynology Laboratory at Texas A&M University (TAMU)
for analysis. Samples were assigned lot and specimen numbers when they were collected
in the field; when analyzed at TAMU, they were given slide numbers in a sequence from
TAMU-1 through TAMU-9 (Table K-1).
All samples were processed for pollen following standard methodologies (Marshall
2008). Sediments exhibited medium to high concentrations of charcoal within a colloidal
or fine grained particulate soil matrix of silty clays including silica or sand. Soil from
this area is differentiated between upland Blacklands which “are dark, calcareous,
loamy to clayey and alluvial. The soils are inherently productive and fertile, but many
have lost productivity through erosion and continuous cropping” (Hatch et al. 1990).
The Blackland Prairie was once a tallgrass prairie that included plants such as tall
dropseed (Sporobolus asper var. asper), asters (Aster), and mead’s sedge (Carex meadii)
among others. Trees common to this area include mesquite (Prosopis), oak (Quercus),
elm (Ulmus), cottonwood (Populus), and pecan (Carya). During the latter part of the
19th century, about 98% of the prairie was cultivated to produce cotton (Malvaceae
Gossypium), and several cereal grains from the grass family (Poaceae) including
sorghum, corn, wheat, and forages. More recently, and as a result of the influx of
livestock, approximately 50% of the area is currently used for cropland (Hatch et al.
1990). Within the area that includes San Marcos, the landscape consists of a Blackland
Prairie to the east and rolling hills of the Edwards Plateau to the west. The Edward’s
Plateau is also a region of numerous grasses and trees such as oak (Quercus), mesquite
(Prosopis) and juniper (Juniperus). Unfortunately, pollen preservation tended to be
differential and generally poor in all samples. This could be a result of high pH levels
in the soils due to the presence of calcareous materials in the Edward’s Plateau such
as limestone, dolomite and chert, or could result from other taphonomic processes that
affect pollen preservation.

613

Pollen Production, Dispersal, Deposition, and Preservation
The limiting factors of pollen dispersal and deposition include: the size of the pollen
grain, the number of pollen grains that are produced by a given plant, the mass and
shape of the pollen, ground topography, weather, depositional environmental conditions,
and the mode of pollen transport. Depending on the evolutionary history of the plant,
pollen will either be dispersed by wind (anemophilous), insects (entomophilous), water
(hydrophilous), animals (zoophilous), self pollination (autogamous), or a combination
of these (Bryant and Hall 1993; Regal 1982). Plants that are pollinated by insects or
animals evolutionarily have limited the amount of pollen they produce (e.g., windpollinated plants need to produce prodigious amounts of pollen to insure their proper
distribution). Other considerations are: the total amounts of pollen each species
produces, the percentage of sporopollenin found in the wall of the pollen grain (e.g., a
preservability factor of the pollen) (Havinga 1964, 1971, 1984), and the sinking speed of
pollen, which refers to the size and mass of the grain, its shape, which will determine
how fast and how far the grain will travel on wind currents (Jackson and Lyford 1999).
The size of pollen is not proportional to the weight of the pollen grain. For example, pine
pollen is large but light; because of its structure it can travel long distances and be a
major component of a pollen assemblage even when no pine trees are close by (Mack and
Bryant 1974). Generally, wind-pollinated plants will produce large amounts of pollen
while insect-pollinated plants will generally produce smaller amounts of pollen. For
example, red clover (Trifolium pratense) will produce approximately 220 pollen grains
per anther, rye (Secale cereale) produces approximately 19,000 pollen grains per anther,
pine (Pinus) produces approximately 160,000 pollen grains per anther, and juniper
(Juniperus) produces approximately 400,000 pollen grains per anther (Erdtman 1969).
Nevertheless, although juniper (Juniperus) is a prodigious producer of pollen, it does not
preserve well under less than ideal conditions.
Degradation of pollen grains
Pollen preservation depends on the environment and the taphonomic processes the
pollen grains undergo before sampling (Sangster and Dale 1961). The geographical
location and the soil/sediment in which the pollen is found are necessary information
to determine if differential preservation has occurred. Often, differences in the
preservability of certain taxa are obvious. Environments that are more likely to contain
fossil pollen are those soils and/or sediments that are slightly acidic (low pH) (Dimbleby
1957); have low Eh potential or oxidation/reduction (Tschudy 1969); have undergone
no rapid changes in moisture levels (Bryant and Dering 1992; Campbell and Campbell
1994; Holloway 1989); have low microbial activity (Davis and Goodlett 1960; Elsik
1966,1971; Havinga 1971; Lichti-Federovich and Ritchie 1965; Moore 1963; Rowley and
Gabaraheva 2004); and, ideally, are deposited in anoxic conditions.
The susceptibility of pollen grains to chemical, mechanical or biological agents

Appendix K

614

depends on many factors. According to Elsik (1971) the amount of degradation of
microspores (pollen and spores) varies from species to species and even within the same
species depending on which microorganism is present (e.g., phycomycetes or bacteria).
Campbell (1999) and others (e.g., Chmura et al. 1999; Cushing 1967; Fall 1987; Havinga
1984; Pennington 1996) have identified a number of relevant factors (e.g., water
transport, percentage of sporopollenin present in the pollen wall, oxidation etc.) when
evaluating the relative frequencies or the presence/absence of pollen types in deposits.
Sporopollenin		
Sporopollenin is the material found within the structure of the pollen wall that is
resistant to chemical oxidation. It is because of sporopollenin that most pollen (and
spores) remains preserved for thousands or millions of years. The composition of
sporopollenin is not entirely known. Several studies have been conducted to determine
the chemical composition of sporopollenin, but each has had limited success. Brooks
and Shaw (1968, 1972, 1978), and Shaw (1971) using oxidizing methods reported
that sporopollenin contained complex biopolymers formed by the polymerization of
carotenoids and carotenoid esters. They reported relative percentages of sporopollenin
in Lycopodium clavatum to be 23.4%, Alnus glutinosa 10.7%, Rumex acetocella
6.3%, Populus balsaminifera 1.4%, and Pinus montana 23.7%, among others.
Sporopollenin can cover both the outermost layer of the pollen or spore wall and
it can also be found in the wall’s inner surface. It has a basic chemical formula of
C90H142O36 but the structural formula is variable (e.g., that it is connected in different
ways – the pattern is different for the different types of pollen) (Fawcett et al. 1970).
Sporopollenin is similar to lignin and cutin as reported by Flenley (1971) who discovered
that it has a specific gravity around 1.4. According to Juvigné (1973), the specific gravity
of the sporopollenin in pollen grains can increase slightly over time and Riding and
Kyffin-Hughes (2004) assert that these changes in specific gravity are in part an effect
of the geothermal gradient found in fossil pollen.
Eh potentials and Differential Preservation
Eh potentials, also called oxidation-reduction reactions (redox), occur in soils and
can impact pollen preservation (Dimbleby 1984, 1985; Tschudy1969). Oxidationreduction reactions are a type of chemical reaction that occurs due to the loss or gain
of electrons to the reactants in a chemical equation. Originally the terms oxidation and
reduction simply meant chemical change though the loss and gain of electrons from
oxygen. In subsequent years this definition has come to include other reactions in which
oxygen is not present (Pearsall 1938). In nature most of these redox reactions do contain
oxygen and it is an important component to understanding the Eh potential or rather
the practical limitations of it. Theoretically, Eh potentials are a useful construct in
determining whether an environment is oxidizing or reducing. However, in practice Eh
potentials can be difficult to determine unless the measurements are taken using an Eh

Appendix K

615

meter in the field.
Once a sample is taken and exposed to the atmosphere the Eh potential will
shift especially if the redox reaction originally contains oxygen. When discussing Eh
potentials for pollen preservation the ideal is a reducing environment or an environment
that contains little or no oxygen. The more oxygen available to sediments the more
microbial activity will be present including earth worm activities (Ray 1959; Shakir
and Dinal 1997; Walch et al. 1970). If the soil contains low amounts of organic material,
pollen preservation may be poor. Nevertheless, with high organic levels microbial
activity may destroy pollen and thus impact pollen frequencies. Differential pollen
preservation is usually evident by the types of pollen found and the level and type of
degradation (Bryant and Hall 1993; Cushing 1967). In the case of the Zatopec samples,
pollen could be identified but the types of pollen found were those types most resistant
to decay. Many other pollen grains were present, but could not be identified because of
severe degradation; these are in the “indeterminate” category.

Soil pH
The pH is a measure of acid and alkaline levels. On a continuum from one to
fourteen, “one” is the most acidic and “fourteen” is the most alkaline, with neutral at
seven. For pollen to be preserved, experimentation (Havinga 1967, 1984; Holloway 1981)
and extensive sampling show that the range for the best preservation lies below a pH of
seven (Dimbleby 1985). Dimbleby states that although some pollen preservation may be
found in alkaline soils, the number of grains found will be low resulting in added efforts
to attain a 200 fossil pollen grain count. Horowitz et al. (1981) suggest that collecting
and processing more soil and counting more slides in these types of environments will
result in sufficiently high pollen counts. Others have reported questionable fossil pollen
interpretations from highly alkaline sediments (Schoenwetter 1996; Schoenwetter and
Geyer 2000). For high pH sediments, the question remains as to how valid these studies
might be due to differential pollen loss (Bryant et al. 1994; Bryant and Hall 1993).

Concentration Values
If fossil pollen concentration values are low this might indicate that preservation is
poor, which would imply differential pollen preservation may have occurred. According
to Dimbleby (1957), any soil with a pH above 6 will result in poor preservation
conditions for pollen. Other studies conducted in the American Southwest by Martin
(1963), Bryant (1969), and Hall (1981, 1995) indicate that a soil pH as high as 8.9 can
produce some pollen preservation. Nevertheless, differential preservation is usually
unavoidable with these types of sediments, especially if there is any moisture available
(Bryant and Hall 1993). According to Tschudy (1969) alkaline conditions combined with
the presence of moisture will produce a highly oxidizing environment. The American
Southwest (including parts of Texas), due to its general aridity, should have good
pollen preservation, but due to the alkalinity in many areas fossil pollen preservation
Appendix K

616

is also differential. The high number of degraded pollen grains is often a good clue that
preservation is poor or differential. If there is poor preservation then the interpretation
of pollen data becomes problematic. For example, if only the very hardy pollen grains
and those that are easy to recognize are found, then generally there is a problem with
the overall preservation (Bryant and Hall 1993). Some researchers have attempted to
establish criteria (such as if the number of pollen types is less than 20 or if the total
pollen sum is less than 100) to determine whether a sample is reliable (e.g., SanchezGoni 1994). Nevertheless, it depends on the research question and the area sampled.
Concentration values become important in an archaeological context when the pollen
concentration values for individual pollen types cannot be explained by natural means
(Dimbleby 1985). With the Zatopec samples, concentration values were only obtained in
samples TAMU-1, -2, and -3. After it became evident that differential preservation was
an issue, the remaining samples were scanned for economic and other pollen that could
be identified but otherwise not counted.
Pollen Extraction/Processing
Processing soil samples for pollen requires laboratory procedures that utilize numerous
acids, bases, and several mechanical methodologies. If not used correctly, some of
these chemicals and methodologies can destroy or remove pollen from samples. For
this reason, precise methodologies should be reported in order to ensure that fossil
pollen was not inadvertently lost or destroyed during processing. Chemicals and
procedures employed depend on the type of soil, the expected preservation of the pollen,
the expected types of pollen that may be encountered, and the preferred method of
processing. The most often cited and used methodology originates from Erdtman and
Erdtman (1933), usually with slight variations. Procedures used to process Zatopec
samples are as follows:
1. Twenty grams of sediment were weighed and placed into a 500 ml beaker.
2. Two Lycopodium tablets which contain 13,500 spores per tablet were added to the
sediments as tracer spores for concentration value purposes. Lycopodium spores
are used because it is extremely rare to find Lycopodium plants naturally occurring
in regions such as the Zatopec site. As a result the only Lycopodium that will be in
the samples will be those that were added intentionally.
3. At this point a solution of 34% HCl was added to the sediments to dissolve any
carbonates that may be in the samples. Carbonates can be problematic if still present during the next step of the processing procedure. The presence of carbonates can
indicate that the sediments originate from areas that contain higher pH levels that
can damage pollen and cause preservation problems. The samples reacted vigorously with the hydrochloric acid and indicated that carbonates were present in the
samples. HCl was added until no further reaction was noted.

Appendix K

617

4. Once the reactions ceased, distilled water was added to dilute the HCl. As per Lentfer et al. (2003) the samples were left to settle for four hours. After four hours all pollen will settle to the bottom of the container.
5. After four hours the supernatant, or liquid portion above the sediments was carefully siphoned off.
6. Hydroflouric acid (HF) is a weak acid that dissolves silicates. HF was added at this
step to remove any sand particles or silicates. Approximately 100 ml of 56% HF was
added to the samples, which were then agitated and left to digest for 24 hours.
7. After 24 hours, the beakers were filled with distilled water to dilute the HF, which is
caustic and can be very dangerous to handle.
8. The samples were allowed to settle for four hours and then again were carefully siphoned off. At this point HCl is once again added to the sample to remove any fluorosilicates that may have formed from the HF. The samples were then transferred to
50 ml, conical bottom centrifuge tubes (CT) to concentrate the pollen and remove the
supernatant.
9. After the samples were transferred to the 50 ml CT, they were washed repeatedly with distilled water (DW) to reduce the acidity of the samples and release fine
grained colloids from the samples. These particular samples were full of colloids
and required several rinses with water and later a 5% KOH solution was added and
rinsed with DW to further release colloids.
10. The samples were then washed with glacial acetic acid, centrifuged, and poured
off to prepare the samples for the acetolysis step. Acetolysis is a process developed
by Erdtman (1960) to remove extraneous materials not pollen and to remove cellulose from the pollen grain itself as a way to see the structure of the pollen grain for
identification. The acetolysis solution consists of a 9:1 mixture of acetic anhydride
and sulfuric acid. The solution is added to the CT tubes and placed into a heat block
which serves as a catalyst for the reaction. The samples were heated for 8 minutes
at 90 degrees C and then removed from the heat block, and washed with glacial acetic acid to stop the reaction.
11. After the samples were washed with DW, the next step was a heavy density separation. Using a specific gravity of 2.0 of zinc bromide, pollen will float above this
solution at a specific gravity of ~1.6 and is an efficient means by which to separate
organic materials from heavier organic materials and non-organic materials still
remaining in the sample (i.e. fine grained silicates left after the HF treatment). Zinc
bromide was added to each of the samples, and mixed with a vortex mixing machine
and centrifuged for 5–10 minutes at varying speeds.
12. Once the sediment was collected, the samples were washed with water, stained with
Safranin-O and rinsed with ethyl alcohol/ethanol (ETOH). They were then placed
into one dram, glass vials with glycerine and placed on a warming plate to remove
any remaining ETOH.

Pollen Counting and Identification
Pollen Counting
After the remaining ETOH was evaporated in each of the processed samples, the
samples were mixed thoroughly and slides made. Slides were made using one drop
of sample from the original dram vial (Jones and Bryant 2001). Pollen identification
and counting was completed using the Olympus BX51 microscope and SPOT imaging
software. Identifications were checked against the Texas A&M University Modern Pollen
Reference Collection, the Mobile Oil Modern Pollen Reference Collection, the Meredith
Lieux Modern Pollen Collection, and the Amoco Modern Pollen Reference Collection.
Several types of pollen were identified to genera but these represented hardy
pollen types that do not degrade easily. Although, as stated earlier, a minimum of 200
pollen grains should be counted from any sample to attain statistically valid relative
frequencies and concentration values, the Zatopec samples had degradation problems
and additional counts did not elicit additional information. Pollen grains that were
found but were unidentifiable was placed into the indeterminate category.
Charcoal and Charcoal Removal
Charcoal, even in small quantities, can be problematic during the processing and
analysis of pollen samples. Charcoal flecks and ash in pollen samples present three
primary problems: 1) charcoal is difficult to bond with other materials and therefore
is not easily digested through using various types of chemical procedures, 2) charcoal
fragments tend to break into smaller pieces during various processing procedures
including screening, sonification, and centrifugation, and 3) much of the charcoal in
samples occurs in the same size range and in the same specific gravity range as pollen
thereby making both screening and normal heavy density separation procedures
ineffective for its removal. In other words, it is virtually impossible to remove significant
amounts of charcoal from some archaeological samples to permit successful pollen
analyses. Samples from Zatopec did contain charcoal that seemed to increase from
TAMU-1 to TAMU-3, with TAMU-3 exhibiting the highest concentration. The charcoal
seemed to decrease from TAMU-4 to TAMU-8.
Results
Twelve different pollen taxa were found in the nine samples examined in this study
(Figure K-1, Table K-2). Types of pollen encountered included: Acanthaceae Justicia,
Asteraceae High Spine (HS), Asteraceae Low Spine (LS), Asteraceae Ligulaflora/
Fenestrate, Asteraceae cf Cirsium, Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthus, Fagaceae Quercus,
Juglandaceae Juglans, Malvaceae, Oleaceae Ligustrum,Onagraceae, Pinaceae,
Poaceae, Poaceae Cerealia, TCT and Ulmaceae Ulmus (Tables K-3 through K-7). The
majority of the pollen types found are wind-pollinated.

Appendix K

619

Acanthaceae Justicia (Water Willow)
There are nine species of Justicia, eight of which are found in Texas, including Hays
County. Acanthaceae Justicia is a perennial forb/herb (vascular plant without woody
tissue, i.e. small plant without bark), many of which grow more commonly in stream
beds, shallow water and mud. It usually flowers from spring to fall with most species
being entomophilous (insect pollinated) and/or autogamous or self pollinated. There is
presently no known economic use for this plant.

Asteraceae Cirsium/HS/LS/Ligulaflora-Fenestrate (Composites -Thistle/
High Spines - Sunflower Family/Low Spines - Ragweed/Dandilion)
Asteraceae is a family of plants commonly known as the composites, and is
sometimes referred to as the sunflower family. This plant family contains over 1,500
genera and more than 22,000 species that grow in almost every known habitat
(Mabberly 1997; Martin 1963). They are especially prolific in Central Texas. They can
be divided into certain categories, three of which occur at Zatopec. One primary group,
which is insect-pollinated, is called the “high-spine” group. As the name suggests the
pollen grains exhibit long “spines” that come out from the main body of the pollen grain.
High spine pollen types have spines that are greater than 2.5 microns, include plants
such as Helianthus or sunflower, and tend to be insect pollinated. Although high spines
are found throughout the column there are not significant differences in the presence of
this type of grain which may indicate cultural use.
In addition, other types of high spines are also found in this area and are not
considered economic plants. The other type in this category is designated as Asteraceae
High Spine cf Cirsium. The most common plant found in this genus is Cirsium
texanum or Texas Thistle. Because of degradation this identification is tentative but
reasonable. Asteraceae Low Spines is the ragweed group or low spine types. These
are wind-pollinated, are endemic and tend to preserve when other more fragile grains
are destroyed. The ligulaflora(e)/fenestrate category also refers to the structure and
morphologic characteristics found on this group. This type of structure is described as
a tectum (a feature in the wall of the pollen grain) with a limited number of somewhat
“window like” openings surrounded by a support structure. Dandelions are in this
category and are widely naturalized throughout Texas, especially in disturbed areas.
Young dandelion leaves are nutritious. Asteraceae pollen types were found in every
Zatopec sample.
Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthus (Goosefoot Family/Amaranthus)
Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthus consists of the family Chenopodiaceae and one
genus Amaranthus in the Amaranthaceae family. The nomenclature Chenopodiaceae/
Amaranthus, also “cheno-ams” (Martin 1963), derives from the similarity between the
pollen grains from these two sources. When any member of the Chenopodiaceae family

Appendix K

620

is found growing in a region where it is known that Amaranthus also is grown, then the
pollen from these two cannot be distinguished from one another. Both have periporate
pollen, or grains with multiple openings, and both contain types similar in size and
shape. Cheno-ams are very recognizable and generally will withstand degradation well.
Cheno-ams can give evidence of disturbed sites or areas where it could have been used
as a food source, and are especially common in Central Texas.
Juglandaceae Juglans (Walnut)
Currently, there are seven species of Juglans found in Texas, including the San
Marcos area. The most common genera found in Edwards Plateau region is the Arizona
walnut (Juglans major). All of the pollen from this genus is considered a heteroporate
pollen grain with several pores (usually 10–12 in the case of Juglans) that occur only
on one half of the grain; this pollen is distinctive because of this feature. Trees produce
nuts that were commonly used for food. Palynologically Juglans is mostly anemophilous
(wind-pollinated) and endemic to the area both prehistorically and historically. The
amount of pollen found does not suggest an economic emphasis.
Malvaceae (Mallow Family)
The Texas mallows are either herbaceous wildflowers or shrub-like plants. This
family contains important economic types such as cotton and okra and includes
several ornamentals including hibiscus. The fruit, flowers, and leaves have all been
used for food with many of the genera from this family medicinally useful. The plants
also contain strong fibers. Pollination vector for this family is entomophilous (insectpollinated) and the presence of these could suggest economic use. Nevertheless, many
of the pollen grains found from this family were not degraded which would suggest
contamination is an issue.
Oleaceae Ligustrum (Olive Family/Privet)
Privet is an invasive plant introduced into the United States in the early 1800’s.
According to the USDA Plant Database, there are currently seven species of privet
found in Texas. In the database of invasive plants Ligustrum has been identified in
Hays County. It is insect pollinated, blooms in the spring to summer, and is likely
growing nearby the Zatopec site. The Ligustrum grain, as with the Malvaceae that was
found, suggests that there is contamination in the sample(s) in which it was identified.
Onagraceae (Evening Primrose Family)
Onagraceae is known as the evening primrose family. According to the USDA Plant
Database, there are 13 genera from this family in Texas. Several genera and species
grow throughout the San Marcos area, and as a result the identification of the pollen is
at the family level only. There are recorded observations of wild plant use by Cherokee
Indians as to how “roots [were] boiled like potatoes” (Perry 1975). This is in reference

Appendix K

621

to Oenothera biennis L. or the Common Evening Primrose which is found within the
plant family Onagraceae. In addition, young leaves are edible. Onagraceae pollen from
Zatopec was found in sample TAMU-3. In samples 4–8 only one to two pollen grains
were found.
Pinaceae (Pine Family), Poaceae (Grass Family), Ulmus (Elm), and Quercus
(Oak)
Pinaceae (pine family), Poaceae (grass family), Ulmus (elm) and Quercus (oak) are
all wind pollinated plants; produce prodigious, hardy and easily recognizable pollen; and
are endemic to Texas. One of the early applications of palynology to archaeology was the
study of cultigens, specifically cereals, many of which are members of the grass family
(Van Zeist and Bottema 1983). Old World cereals are found in the United States during
post-contact times and are different genera in the grass or Poaceae family (also called
Gramineae). Within this large family are the cereals that were grown in the research
area during historical times such as wheat, barley, rye and sorgham. Nevertheless, noncultigen grasses are also found within this family and are often difficult to differentiate.
Today, as a result of genetic manipulation and continued cultivation of these plants, the
accepted standard for identifying pre-contact cereals is larger than 40 microns (Bottema
1992; Mercuri 2008). Identifying prehistoric economic types within the grass or Poaceae
family is difficult due to the overlap of size gradation and the similar morphology that
is exhibited in both economic and non-economic grasses such as size and axis to pore
ratios (Pohl et al. 2007). When Poaceae pollen is found that exhibits characteristics
of potential economic types, such as size, but other grasses that are non-economic can
also be found within this characteristic, then the pollen is said to be cerealia. This term
describes pollen grains from the Poaceae family that include potential economic types
but cannot be identified with certainty due to the ‘overlap zone’ between economic and
non-economic types. In the Old World the standard used to distinguish prehistoric
cereals is 37 to 40 microns. In the New World, maize is identified if the size is 45 +
microns, depending on the analyst, area, and time frame in question.
In areas such as San Marcos it is believed that the larger Poaceae grains identified
as cerealia are from those cultigens that are present in the area today represented
as sorgham and wheat. Nevertheless, prehistoric maize or Zea could be present and
would appear similar to cerealia pollen from the more modern cultigens (Fearn and Liu
1995). Although some pollen types in the Poaceae family can be distinguished using
various identification techniques, unless there is corroborating evidence in the form
of macoremains or other microfossils (such as starch and/or phytoliths), no definite
determination can be made whether the pollen is indeed Zea or maize (Bryant 2007). In
addition, because of the contamination question, other diagnostic methodologies may
not be applicable. Therefore, it is not certain at this time if the pollen found in sample
TAMU-9 is from prehistoric maize, is a contaminate from modern cereals, or is from

non-economic grasses. In addition, the quantity of pollen grains encountered does not
suggest cultivation activities or ingestion of the same.
TCT –Taxodiaceae/Cupressaceae/Taxaceae (Taxodium/Cypress/Taxus or Yew
Families)
These families are included together based on the morphological similarities of
their pollen. Frequently these three are found in the same or similar ecoregions and
when this occurs it is not possible to identify the pollen found to the genera level. This
is especially true when any degradation occurs. Identifying features that are available
on fresh specimens makes it possible to separate some of the genera from each other
such as Thuja vs. Juniperus. However, when the distinguishing morphological feature
is degraded away (as is frequently the case in archaeological samples) identifying the
pollen to genera is tentative at best. The accepted identification is simply TCT, and this
has been used in this analysis. In TAMU-3 there were two pollen grains identified as a
TCT and only two found in the rest of the column and TAMU-9. It is possible that these
grains are not contaminates, but given the fact that these tend to be some of the first
grains to start to degrade and given the level of degradation found in these samples, it
is surprising to find these. Nevertheless, these are all wind-pollinated and it could be
that many of the indeterminate pollen grains are from these families but too degraded
to tell. All of the plants found in these three families are considered Gymnosperms
and historically have been used for their wood, resin, berries and more recently as
ornamentals.
Discussion
The pollen samples from Zatopec were collected in order to reconstruct, to the degree
possible, prehistoric environmental conditions, and to identify resources that might have
been available and that could have been used by the site’s inhabitants. Additionally,
a single sample (TAMU-9) collected from the pelvic region of Burial 1 was submitted
in the chance that it contained a discrete pollen assemblage representing the ambient
environment at the time of that individual’s death, or perhaps of that individual’s
diet. Although palynology can be an important fact-finding endeavor, the differential
degradation of some pollen grains over others proved problematic. It is obvious from
the concentration values of some samples that there were large quantities of organic
materials that survived taphonomic processes. Nevertheless, on closer inspection of the
actual pollen types it seems obvious that the entire picture is not present. Pollen types
that have higher percentages of sporopollenin in the pollen wall are the same ones that
are will be found in severe degradation conditions. In addition the relative frequencies
in the indeterminant category represents over half of the samples in general and fresh
pollen types, and pollen types not present until after the early 1800s, are present in the
column sample and pelvic sample. This suggests contamination occurred in all of the
samples.
Appendix K

623

Because of the preservation of the pollen grains and other difficulties with this set of
samples, valid counts and, consequently, concentration values were impossible to obtain
for all of the samples. The location and geology of the area resulted in an environment
with a high pH whereas pollen preserves the best at a pH of 6 and below (Dimbleby
1985). The high pH and the contamination issues presented significant problems in the
analysis and interpretation of the site. Nevertheless, TAMU-3 presents some interesting
information. It is the sample that has a high concentration of organics and the level
where there is an increase in charcoal. This would suggest a cultural level. However, in
the absence of more diagnostic pollen types or other plant materials to corroborate the
pollen evidence any further interpretation would be conjecture.
