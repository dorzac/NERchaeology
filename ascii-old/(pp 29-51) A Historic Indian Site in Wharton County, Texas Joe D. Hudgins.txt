A Historic Indian Site in Wharton County, Texas
Joe D. Hudgins

ABSTRACT
Late Prehistoric and Historic Indian cultural materials were found by
the writer in 1969 at the Shanklin site in Wharton County, Texas. This paper
describes the artifacts and faunal remains that were collected from the plowed
surface of the site.

INTRODUCTION
The Shanklin site (41WH8) is on the north bank of Peach Creek, a tributary
of the Colorado River, about 5 km (3 miles) west-southwest of Hungerford,
Wharton County, Texas (Figure 1). The creek divides the prairie region to the
north from the heavily timbered Colorado River valley to the south. Before it
was cleared and cultivated, the site area was lightly timbered with oak and
elm trees.
Cultivation--mainly corn and milo in the past 10 years--has disturbed the
surface, resulting in furrows 16 to 18 cm deep. All of the artifacts and faunal
material was collected from the surface of an area about 35 by 50 meters in the
cultivated field.

Indian History of Wharton County
The earliest recorded historic aborigines in Wharton County were the
Karankawa-affiliated Coco Indians (Campbell 1976: 181). They were first encountered by Cabeza de Vaca in the 1530s and later by Frenchmen of La Salle’s
expedition in the 1680s. The Coco Indians were most frequently associated with
the lower Colorado River in an area now covered by Colorado, Wharton, and
Matagorda Counties.
The most recent sighting of Indians in the site area was in the early 1870s,
according to J. D. Hudgins, of Hungerford (Hudgins 1969). He recalled a small
group of Indians who visited his ranch during the summer and stayed for a few
days begging food. This band of Indians was known by the local inhabitants as
fish-eaters, because they lived on the creeks and rivers, depending for food almost entirely on fish and shellfish.

LITHIC ARTIFACTS
Utilized Flakes
In all, 1,260 flint flakes were recovered. Most are 5 to 6 mm long; six are
very small flakes recovered by screening a random sample from the furrow
through eighth-inch hardware cloth.
Analysis of all of the flakes revealed that 70 percent are tertiary flakes
(flakes from within cores, with no remnants of cortex), 25 percent are secondary
flakes (flakes with some cortex), and 5 percent are primary flakes (flakes with
cortex covering one side or most of one side).
Cores
Ten flint cores (four are shown in Figure 2) were collected. Eight had been
worked bifacially, and one (Figure 2, a) is a chopperlike implement.
Bifaces
Other lithic artifacts from the site include 10 large bifaces (Figure 3). They
are 7 to 10 cm long and 4 to 5 cm wide and are either oval or leaf shaped. These
bifaces were found only in the southwestern and northeastern areas of the site.
End Scrapers
There are 150 unifacial end scrapers, varying from 3 to 7 cm in length and
2 to 3.5 cm in width (Figure 4). Only about 15 percent have remnant cortex.
Most of the scrapers have one end worked into a rounded or humped shape. All
were recovered from the southwestern and northeastern areas of the site.

Drills and Gravers
Twenty-three flint drills and four gravers were recovered (Figure 5). The
drills, 2.5 to 5 cm long, have unifacial base and biracial stems; the gravers, 2 to 4
cm long, are all unifacial.
Arrowpoints
The collection includes 110 arrowpoints and 7 larger projectile points. The
arrowpoints are Fresno, Guerrero, Cuney, and Bulbar Stemmed types (Hester
1980: 104).
Fresno Points (Figure 6)
Thirty Fresno points were found, 17 biracial and 13 unifacial. They are triangular with fiat bases and range in length between 2 and 4 cm.
Guerrero Points (Figure 7)
Thirty-five Guerrero points were recovered, 21 bifacial and 14 unifacial.
Guerrero points are sometimes triangular, but they have concave bases. Guerrero
points have been described as Historic; specimens have been found at Spanish
missions in Coahuila and Texas (Hester 1980: 106) and at Spanish Colonial missions in San Antonio (Fox 1979:25-26).

Cuney Points (Figure 8)
Twenty-eight Cuney points were recovered, 12 bifacial and 16 unifacial.
They vary in length from 2.5 to 4 cm.
Bulbar Stemmed (Figure 9, a-e)
Nine bulbar-stemmed points were recovered, six bifacial and three unifacial. Two of these points (Figure 9, f, g) are generally triangular, each with a
small notch centered in the base. They are similar in length to Cuney points.

Other Point Types (Figure 10)
Four of the points recovered may fall into types other than those described
above. These points have small concave bases and pronouncedly convex sides. A
point of this type was found at Mission Conception in San Antonio (Cook
1980: 11, D).

Larger Projectile Points
Seven large biracial projectile points were recovered. Four (Figure 11, a-d)
are generally triangular and seem to be made from the same material as the arrowpoints. Two (Figure 11, e, f) have stemmed bases.
CERAMICS
Sherds
More than 8,000 ceramic sherds were collected from the surface of site
41WH8; they were about evenly distributed over the entire site. Most have hard,
smooth, thin walls and have fine, sandy, black paste. About 30 percent are bone
tempered. Colors of the exterior surfaces include buff (10 percent), light orange
(30 percent), and dark brown to black (60 percent). About 40 percent are decorated with straight or painted wavy black lines (Figure 12). The interior walls of
about 30 percent of the sherds are coated with asphaltum. Most of the sherds
from the Shanklin site appear to be of Rockport ware (Hester 1980: 128).
Two styles of rim sherds were found: smooth, slightly rounded rims (Figure
13) and notched rims (Figure 14). Two incised sherds (Figure 15) and a few fragments of clay handles (Figure 16) also were collected.
Figurines
A ceramic anthropomorphic figurine, 6.5 cm long and 2.5 cm in diameter
(Figure 17) is medium brown with a dark gray interior. On the back (Figure 17, a)
are three vertical rows of semicircular parallel indentations resembling fingernail
marks and one horizontal row of similar indentations that crosses the middle of
the vertical rows. Similar indentations are on the front of the figurine but do not
appear to follow a pattern. On the front the head has two eye holes and three
small incised marks above and beside the right eye (Figure 17, b). On the back
the head has no markings, but here a broken area exposes the dark gray interior
(Figure 17, a). From the side, the head is tapered toward the top. At the bottom
front of the figurine are two parallel vertical incised lines.
Smoking Pipe Fragments
A bowl fragment (Figure 18, a) and a stem fragment (Figure 18, b) from different smoking pipes indicate European influence. The bowl fragment is light
brown and has parallel lines extending from the seam. The stem fragment is gray
and has raised parallel lines extending from the seam.

HISTORIC EUROPEAN ARTIFACTS
Glass Artifacts
Seventeen fragments of heavily patinated glass were collected (Figure 19).
Most are dark green or blue green. One specimen (Figure 19, a) had been unifacially worked into an end scraper similar to the flint unifacial scrapers shown in
Figure 4. Three other fragments (Figure 19, b-d) had been bifacially worked into
round or oval shapes.
Coins

A single silver piece-of-eight was recovered (Figure 20) in excellent condition, showing little or no wear. The coin has a Mexican mint mark and the
date 1738.

Iron Artifacts
An iron artifact resembling a projectile point was recovered from the site
(Figure 21). By microscopic examination, Harry Shafer, of Texas A&M University, found that the edges of the artifact had striations from filing and that its base
had been deliberately blunted (Shafer 1982). The artifact is apparently a keyhole
escutcheon that has been made into a projectile point.
Other iron artifacts include the midsection of a knife blade 8 cm long and
3 cm wide; a square iron spike 9 cm long, with the pointed end bent around to
form a hook; and a triangular piece of iron 2.5 cm long and 5 mm thick, with one
side heavily coated with an asphaltlike substance.

SHELLS AND SHELL ARTIFACTS
Freshwater Mussel Shell
About 30 percent of the freshwater mussel shell fragments on the site had
been notched (Figure 22). The reason for the notching is not known.

Marine Shells
Oliva sayana
Specimens of the letter olive (Oliva sayana) mollusc were recovered (Figure
23). Specimen a had not been worked, specimen b has its top missing (whether
purposely or naturally is unknown), and specimens c-f have V-shaped notches in
the bottom ends. Specimen d is an artifact known as a tinkler; it has an especially
interesting incised groove around the top, above which is a series of 10 notches.
An Oliva shell similar to specimen d was found at site 41VT34 near Victoria
(Janota 1980: 41).
Other Marine Shells
The following shells were also found on the site:
Giant Atlantic cockle: Laevicardium (Dinocardium) robustum
Transverse ark: Andara (Clarkiuna) transversa
Plicate horn: Cerithidea (Cerithideopsis) pliculosa
Rangia: Rangia cuneata
Lightning whelk: Busycon (Perversium) pulleyi
The giant Atlantic cockle, transverse ark, and the plicate horn were identified by D. Gentry Steele, of Texas A&M University (Steele 1982). There is no
evidence that these specimens were used as ornaments, but the site is 80 km (50
miles) from the Gulf of Mexico, so it is probable that they were ornaments or
trade items.

BONE ARTIFACTS
Projectile Points
Four bone projectile points were found at the site (Figure 24). They were
apparently shaped by using single slicing motions with sharp blades; there are no
indications of grinding or smoothing.

Other Bone Artifacts
Other bone specimens found at the site had been drilled, smoothed, or
notched on one or both ends (Figure 25). Four of these specimens (b-e) had been
rounded and smoothed on both ends to make beads.
One bone fragment (Figure 25, f) has three painted black lines on the inner
side resembling the black lines on the potsherds in Figures 12 and 14.
Five bone fragments (Figure 25, g-k) had been purposely rounded or pointed
on one or both ends.
An alligator tooth (Figure 25, a) with a drilled hole through one end may
have been a bead.

FAUNA
More than 300 bone fragments were collected, representing the following
animals: cow or bison, modern horse, whitetail deer, black bear, cougar, opossum,
eastern cottontail, red-eared turtle, box turtle, soft-shell turtle, alligator, and gar.
The specimens representing black bear, cougar, eastern cottontail, and
opossum were identified by William L. McClure, of Houston (McClure 1982).
The species found at the site, together with the skeletal elements from which the
bone fragments came, are listed in Table 1.
Because elements of bear, cougar, and horse were found, the faunal collection makes this site unique among the prehistoric sites in Wharton County. Remains of bear were found only in the north and northeastern parts of the site;
remains of cow or bison were found only in the south and southwestern parts. No
teeth from modern bison were available for comparison, but the cow or bison
teeth are unusually large in comparison to those of a 2,000-lb. Brahman bull.

Only a small percentage of the bone fragments had been burned, and no
evidence was found of hearths or burned areas at the site, in contrast to the prehistoric sites in Wharton County that yielded many fired clay balls and high percentages of burned bone fragments. This variation may result from different
cooking methods of the prehistoric and historic Indians in the area.

CONCLUSIONS
The artifacts recovered from the Shanklin site (41WH8) and described in
this paper indicate a historic Indian site, occupied possibly during the eighteenth
or early nineteenth century. Many of the recovered artifacts resemble those found
in archeological contexts at Spanish missions in Texas.
The artifacts and faunal material from this historic Indian site are assumed
to represent a single temporal component; they present a good opportunity for
noting the differences between historic and prehistoric Indian occupation sites in
the area.
