ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey along a proposed pipeline (1.83 miles) and the site of
two proposed ground water storage tanks (1/4 acre) in Bell County, Texas was
performed by Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) for the West Bell County
Water Supply Corporation (WSC) in May of 2007. William E. Moore was the Principal
Investigator, and Edward P. Baxter was the Project Archaeologist. This study was
carried out under Texas Antiquities Committee Permit Number 4514. The project area
was investigated using the pedestrian survey method supported by shovel probing. In
all, the project area consisted of 2.5 acres. Altered chert cobbles were found on the
talus slope below the site of the proposed water storage tank, but laboratory analysis
found them to be not cultural. They appear to have been modified by natural fires.
There is, however, a source of chert that is probably in the ledge just below the summit
of the hill where the ground storage tanks will be constructed. These materials were
returned to the landowner who discarded them. Copies of the final report are housed at
the Texas Historical Commission (THC), Archeology Division, the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL), and BVRA.

INTRODUCTION
The West Bell County WSC proposes to upgrade its service to rural Bell
County by increasing the size of an existing water pipeline from six inches to
twelve inches and construct two above ground 5000-gallon water storage tanks
on top of a large hill south of Long Mountain. The length of the pipeline upgrade
is 1.83 miles, and the site where the tanks will be constructed is one-quarter
acre. The pipeline will be in a trench twenty-four inches wide and three feet
deep. The construction easement will be ten feet. The pipeline will be placed on
private property when possible, but it will be moved to the public right-of-way if
there is a problem with the preferred location. The proposed line parallels three
county roads. They are County Road 2484, Tally Ho Road, and Fire Lane Road.
There is an existing road that leaves Fire Lane Road and traverses the slope to
the top of the hill. This road will be used during the construction of the water
storage tanks. Therefore, no disturbance to the hill will be created except for the
route of the pipeline and the construction of the storage tanks.
The general location of the project area within the county is depicted in
Figure 1, and the area investigated is illustrated in Figure 2. An archaeological
assessment of the Area of Potential Effect (APE) was required by the THC,
Archeology Division. Since the water supply corporation is considered to be a
public entity, a permit from the THC was required and Antiquities Permit 4514
was issued to BVRA by this agency. The project area is depicted on two 7.5â
United States Geological Survey topographic quadrangles. These are Killeen
(3197-212) and Youngsport (3097-343). The official title for this project is the
West Bell County WSC Fire Lane Tank Project.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Bell County is located within the Balconian biotic province as defined by
Blair (1950:112-116) and includes the Gulf coastal plain from the Atlantic Ocean
to eastern Texas. The size and location of this province is described below by
Blair (1950:112):
The Balconian province, as here defined, takes in
most of the Edwards Plateau as limited by Sellards,
Adkins and Plummer (1933): (figures 3 and 4), the
Lampasas Cut Plain and Comanche Plateau of Raisz
(1939 [cited as 1946 in Blair]), and the Central Mineral
or Llano Uplift region. That part of the Edwards
Plateau lying west of the Pecos, and often referred to
as the Stockton Plateau, is not included, but is
referred instead to as the Chihuahuan province.
The Balconian climate is characterized by a decrease in rainfall from east
to west. Bell County is located in the eastern half of the province that has been
classified by Thornwaite (1948) as dry subhumid, mesothermal with average
annual potential evapotranspiration of between 39.27 and 44.88 inches. The
annual rainfall for Bell County is 34 inches, the January minimum temperature is
37 degrees Fahrenheit, the July maximum temperature is 96 degrees Fahrenheit,
and the growing season is 258 days (Kingston and Harris 1983).
According to Blair (1950:113), the most characteristic plant association of
this province is a scrub forest of Mexican cedar (Juniperus mexicana), Texas oak
(Quercus texana), stunted live oak (Quercus virginiana), and various less
numerous species. The project area is also located well within the Prairies
Vegetation Region and the Edwards Plateau Vegetation Region (Gould 1962).
Vegetational species characteristic of the region include Plateau live oak
(Quercus fusiformus), Texas oak (Quercus texana), ashe juniper (Juniperus
ashei), honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia),
cottonwood (Populus deltoides), pecan (Carya illinoinensis), elm (Ulmus spp.),
sumacs (Rhus spp.), Texas persimmon (Diospyros texana), agarita (Berberis
trifoliolata), Texas stillingia (Stillingia texana), yucca (Yucca spp.), Texas prickly
pear (Opuntia Lindheimeri), yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), and American beautyberry
(Callicarpa americana).
Grasslands include seep mulhy (Muhlenbergia
reverchnoii),
Canadian
wildrye
(Elymus
canadensis),
dichanthelium
(Dichanthelium spp.), Texas grama (Bouteloua rigidiseta), and red grama
(Bouteloua hirsuta). The project area is now primarily overgrown with juniper and
mixed oaks and grasses.

The Balconian Biotic Province is characteristically represented by a
general mixture of fauna from nearby surrounding provinces (Blair 1950). Typical
species found within the project area include White-tailed deer (Odocoileus
virginianus), cotton-tailed rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), nine-banded armadillo
(Dasypus novemcinctus), black-tailed jack rabbit (Lepus californicus), racoon
(Prycon lotor), hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), wild turkey (Melagris
gallopavo), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), scissor-tailed flycatcher
(Tyrannus forficatus), northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), western
coachwhip (Masticophis flagellum testaceus), and the bullsnake (Pituophis
melanoleucus sayi).
The project area is located within the Lampasas River drainage basin.
The nearest drainages to the project area are two unnamed tributaries of Rock
Creek, a tributary of the Lampasas River.
The water pipeline passes through five soil types (Figure 3). These are
Altoga silty clay, 2 to 5 percent slopes (AIC), Brackett association, rolling (BRE),
Denton silty clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes (DeB), Lewisville silty clay, 1 to 3 percent
slopes (LeC), and Lewisville-Altoga complex, 2 to 5 percent slopes (LgC). They
are described briefly as follows:
AIC soils are discussed by Huckabee et al. (1977:6) as gently sloping soils
on rounded hilltops, hillsides, and oblong foot slopes and consist of silty clays
containing chalky fragments. They are often gullied. BRE soils are discussed by
Huckabee (1977:10) as soils that formed mostly on the lower two-thirds of the
sides of hills. Included within these soils are fragments of limestone. DeB soils
are discussed by Huckabee et al. (1977:14) as gently sloping soils on low ridges.
Limestone fragments occur at various depths, and a fractured hard limestone is
usually found at 40 to 60 inches. LeC soils are discussed by Huckabee et al.
(1977:22) as gently sloping soils on foot slopes. From the surface to 60 inches,
this soil consists of silty clay. The soil survey does not discuss this soil past this
depth. LgC soils are discussed by Huckabee et al. (1977:22) as gently sloping
soils on convex slopes. This complex is made up of about 50 percent Lewisville
silty clay and 50 percent Altoga silty clay. The Lewisville silty clay extends to a
depth of 60 inches, while the Altoga silty clay contains an underlying chalky marl
that reaches to a depth of 62 inches.

It should be stated here that soil was virtually non-existent within the
current project area. Surface visibility was at least 50% throughout the area
examined. The field survey encountered, in most cases, a thin (0-10 cm) layer of
clayey soil over caliche, bedded cretaceous marine fossils, or limestone.
The large hill encompasses two soil types. The top of the hill is
composed of the Speck association, undulating (SpD) as defined by Huckabee et
al. (1977:29) and illustrated in the Bell County soil survey on Sheet 55. This
association is made up of stony and gravelly soils. Areas containing these soils
are irregular in shape and contain slopes from 1 to 8 percent. The slopes leading
to the crest of this hill are composed of the Real association, hilly (REF) as
defined by Huckabee et al. (1977:27) and illustrated in the Bell County soil
survey on Sheet 55. This association consists of long narrow strips along
canyon walls and hills. Slopes range from 10 to 30 percent. These soils consist
of gravelly soils and limestone with little soil formation present.
This survey encompassed two different environmental settings. First, the
pipeline traversed a landscape consisting of ridges, terraces, and slopes of hills
(Figure 4). Second, the proposed site of the ground water storage tanks
occupies the top of a steep hill (Figure 5).

CULTURE SEQUENCE
Bell County is located in the North Central Texas cultural-geographical
region as defined by Biesaart et al. (1985:76). This area is referred to as Central
Texas by most archaeologists and is rich in archaeological sites.
Summaries relevant to the prehistory of Bell County and vicinity have
been prepared by various archaeologists, primarily as a result of work at Fort
Hood in Bell and Coryell counties, Texas (Guderjan et al. 1980; Skinner et al.
1981, 1984; Thomas 1978; Roemer et al. 1985; Carlson et al. 1986), Belton
Reservoir (Shafer et al. 1964), the Youngsport site (Shafer 1963), and Stillhouse
Hollow Reservoir (Shafer et al. 1964; Sorrow et al. 1967). Summaries of the
region have been published by Suhm (1960), Weir (1976), and Prewitt (1981,
1985). Most recently, two thorough articles concerning Central Texas were
published in Volume 66 of the Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society. These
works, entitled "Forty Years of Archeology in Central Texas," by Michael B.
Collins (1995) and "Implications of Environmental Diversity in the Central Texas
Archeological Region" by Linda Wootan Ellis, G. Lain Ellis, and Charles D.
Frederick (1995), represent a major synthesis of the vast amount of collected
data for the region. The following discussion is taken primarily from the works
cited above.
Paleoindian Period
Although, according to Willey and Phillips (1958:80), problems exist with
the term "Paleo-Indian," it is so widely accepted that it is used in this discussion.
Paleo-Indian typically refers to those cultures that were oriented toward big game
hunting with food collecting not a major pursuit. Eileen Johnson (1977:65-77)
states that it has been erroneously stereotyped as a migratory systematic big
game procurement adaptation. Collins (1995:381) argues that subsistence in
Clovis times, for example, Paleo-Indian exploited a diverse fauna base that not
only included large herbivores such as mammoth, bison, and horse but also
included smaller animals such as water turtles, land tortoises, alligator, mice,
badger, and raccoon. At Kincaid Rock Shelter, a paved floor suggests that the
inhabitants of this site returned to the same site as part of a regular hunting and
gathering strategy in contrast with nomadic hunters who only pursued big game.
It is, therefore, assumed that an array of plants presumably also constituted part
of Clovis subsistence (Collins 1990; Collins et al. 1989)

9

According to Skinner et al. (1981:13), the Paleo-Indian period is one of the
least understood time periods in Central Texas prehistory, primarily because few
sites have been excavated. Evidence of this period often occurs in the form of
surface collected materials found over much of Central Texas. At Fort Hood, this
period is represented by distinctive projectile points found in multi-component
surface sites and as isolated finds (Carlson et al. 1986:15). Generally, it is
believed that this period lasted from about 10,000 B.C. until 6000 B.C.
Diagnostic artifacts of the period include dart point types Angostura, Clovis,
Folsom, Golondrina, and Plainview as defined by Suhm and Jelks (1962) and
Turner and Hester (1985).
These early sites are often found on old terraces of major river drainages
and may be more distant from major streams than some more recent
occupations (Bryan 1931). Some rock shelters, such as the Levi site, were
intensively occupied even though they are located a considerable distance from
major rivers. The only example of a rock shelter in Central Texas immediately
adjacent to a major drainage known to contain Paleo-Indian occupation is the
Horn Shelter (41BQ46) in Bosque County (Redder 1985).
Archaic Period
The Archaic represents a broad cultural time period that lasted from
approximately 8500 Before Present (B.P.) to 1250 B.P. in Central Texas.
According to Prewitt (1981:71), "The Archaic Stage dominates all other remains
in Central Texas." Prewitt (1981) has subdivided the Archaic into eleven phases.
LeRoy Johnson (1987) has questioned the validity of the phase concept as used
by Prewitt, especially the phases occurring before the Middle Archaic. These
have been grouped into Early, Middle, Late, and Terminal periods by Carlson et
al. (1986:15). According to Prewitt (1981:77-78), during the Early Archaic there
was a "strong orientation toward the gathering aspect rather than the hunting,
and a mobile population was of low density." This occurred during the Circleville,
San Geronimo, and Jarrell phases (8500 B.P. - 5000 B.P.). In the Middle
Archaic, food gathering had become very specialized as evidenced by the
presence of numerous burned rock middens/mounds (Prewitt 1981:78-80). The
Middle Archaic is seen by Prewitt to have taken place during the Oakalla, Clear
Fork, Marshall Ford, and Round Rock phases (5000 B.P. - 2600 B.P.). An
overall decrease in burned rock middens took place during the Late Archaic.
Bison were important as a food resource, but did not dominate subsistence
activities (Prewitt 1981:80-81). The Late Archaic occurred during the San
Marcos and Uvalde phases (2600 B.P. - 1750 B.P.). The Terminal Archaic,
according to the classification by Carlson et al. (1986), includes the Twin Sisters
and Driftwood phases (1750 B.P. - 1250 B.P.). An increase in the importance of
gathering and an apparent peak in site density seem to have occurred during
Prewitt's (1981:82) Driftwood phase.

10

According to the statistical overview (Biesaart et al. 1985) published by the
Office of the State Archeologist in 1985, the prehistoric site inventory for Bell
County was heavily skewed towards the Archaic. Of the 197 recorded sites, 2
were classified as Paleo-Indian, 10 Early Archaic, 37 Middle Archaic, 32 Late
Archaic, 52 General Archaic, and 29 Late Prehistoric. These statistics suggest
that Bell County was occupied mainly during the Archaic period which, according
to Prewitt (1981:Figure 3), lasted from 8500 years B.P. to 1250 B.P. This is
supported by the statement by Collins (1995:383) that "two-thirds of the
prehistory of Central Texas is 'Archaic' in character."
Late Prehistoric Period
This period has been referred by some as the Neo-American Stage (Suhm
et al. 1954), Neo-archaic (Prewitt 1981), and Post-Archaic (Johnson and Goode
1994). Technological changes are the primary distinguishing characteristics of
this stage. The Austin (1250 B.P. - 650 B.P.) and Toyah (650 B.P. - 200 B.P.)
phases belong to this stage of prehistory. During this time arrow points first
appeared as well as ceramics and possibly horticulture.
According to Collins (1995:385), there is now evidence that only the bow
and arrow appeared initially in Central Texas; pottery was added later, and
agriculture developed last and was of minor importance. Because Late
Prehistoric groups continued to practice hunting and gathering, a division or two
sub-periods seem to have taken place. These are referred to as early and late
by Collins (1995:385) with the break between the long-standing Archaic period
and the Late Prehistoric period occurring at circa 800 B.P. when Toyah replaced
Austin as the prevailing archeological manifestation.
The most obvious change that emerged at the beginning of the Late
Prehistoric period is the introduction of the bow and arrow and decreased use of
the atlatl or spear thrower. Otherwise, subsistence lifeways in the Late
Prehistoric were probably little different from those in the earlier Archaic period
(Prewitt 1981:74; Weir 1976). A chronological model by Dillehay (1974) of bison
presence and absence periods on the southern plains suggests that bison were
present during the Toyah phase but not during the preceding Austin phase.

11

Historic Period
Collins (1995:386) divides the Historic period of Central Texas into three
sub-periods: early, middle, and late. During the first two, vestiges of both
indigenous and European peoples and cultures were present; however, in the
third the indigenous peoples had virtually disappeared. The early Historic subperiod in Central Texas began in the late 17th century with the first documented
arrival of Europeans. Bell County is situated within the historic range of the
Tonkawa Indians who inhabited the area in the 16th Century (Newcomb 1986).
By the 19th Century, they had broken ties with the Comanche and Wichita and
were associated with the Lipan Apache (Aten 1983:32). They have been
described as typical southern Plains Indians who were hunters and gatherers
and who lived along the streams and rivers of Central Texas. Remains of this
group have not been found in an historic context in Bell County.
During this period, Texas was occupied by numerous aboriginal groups
including the Caddo, Jumano, Tonkawa, Comanche, and Lipan Apache
(Newcomb 1986). Trade is known to have existed between the Jumanos and the
Caddos. The Lipan Apaches and subsequently the Comanches entered the
region from the Plains while following key animal resources as they migrated into
Texas. Contact period occupations are often identified by the occurrence of
glass beads, gun parts, gunflints, metal projectile points, and European
manufactured ceramics. The archival search did not locate any Historic Indian
sites in Bell County; however, Texas Archeological Society (TAS) member Bob
Burleson (1995:6) reports finding a metal arrow point cut from a barrel strap in
fresh gravels placed on the road to his farm. In adjacent Coryell County, a blue
glass bead was found with one of the burials at 41CV1, a group burial along the
Leon River (Jackson 1931), and a steel arrow point has been reported as an
isolated find on Horse Creek in the extreme east corner of Coryell County
(Campbell 1952).
Historically, Bell County was first settled in 1834 and 1835 by colonists
who settled along Little River. The area was abandoned during the "Runaway
Scrape" of 1836, reoccupied, and deserted again after the fall of Fort Parker in
June 1836. The early settlements were constantly harassed by hostile Indians
and, although several forts were established, by 1838 all settlers had left the
county. On May 26, 1839, the Indians suffered a decisive defeat at what is
referred to as the "Famous Bird Creek Fight" about one and a half miles
northwest of the present site of Temple, Texas. However, settlement did not
return to the Bell County area until after 1843.

12

Bell County was created on January 22, 1850 and was named for Peter H.
Bell. Nolan Springs was chosen as the county seat and named Nolanville, but on
December 16, 1851 the name was changed to Belton. Early settlement was
along the creeks and rivers. Early histories of Bell County refer frequently to the
Shallowford Crossing on the Leon River as an important transportation route for
wagon traffic. The exact location of this crossing has not been identified, but it
substantiates the importance of this part of Bell County during its early
settlement. By 1860, most of the land had been taken. The last serious Indian
raid occurred in 1859. With the Indian problem apparently resolved, settlement
increased and the county grew from 4799 in 1860, to 9771 in 1870, and to
20,518 in 1880. The number of farms in the county increased from 640 in 1869,
to 2231 in 1871, and to 4249 in 1889. Bell County is chiefly an agricultural region
with cotton and corn the leading crops. The construction of Fort Hood led to a
population increase in the county from 44,863 in 1940 to 74,145 in 1950.

13

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
According to Prehistoric Archeological Sites in Texas: A Statistical
Overview (Biesaart et al. 1985:111), there were 197 sites recorded at TARL in
1985 when this study was published by the Office of the State Archeologist. At
this time, Bell County was third in the North Central Texas region, and the 197
sites represented 7.35% of the region and .97% of the state. The archaeological
significance of this area is further indicated by the fact that 61 of the 197 sites
recorded in 1985 were registered as State Archeological Landmarks. This figure
represents 30.96% of all sites in Bell County.
Since 1985, however, the number of recorded sites has greatly increased;
more than 1240 sites were on file at TARL as of May 10, 2007 (TARL site files).
Although sites have been recorded by private contract archaeology firms, local
archaeological societies, and interested individuals, this increase in the number
of sites in the county is mainly due to large-scale federal projects such as Lake
Belton, Stillhouse Hollow Reservoir, and Fort Hood.
The efforts of members of the Central Texas Archaeological Society and
Bell County Archeological Society have made notable contributions. These
include articles in the form of bulletins, newsletters, special reports, and
unpublished manuscripts on file at TARL or with society members. Bell County
has been the subject of intensive investigations by members of the Central Texas
Archeological Society. As a result of the above-mentioned investigations, "Bell
County is one of the better known Central Texas counties and has provided
significant information toward the understanding of prehistoric chronologies in
this part of Texas" (Young 1987:9).
At the time of this survey there were no archaeological sites recorded in
the project area or APE. The nearest recorded site to the current project area is
41BL979, approximately 150 meters to the west. This site was recorded by
archaeologists from Hicks and Company, Inc, in 1991 following a survey of the
proposed Ding Dong to Trimmier Transmission Line for Brazos Electric
Cooperative of Waco. This site is described on the site form as a lithic
procurement site. Although there was a large quantity of chert in the area, no
finished artifacts were found. The site form mentions numerous split cobbles and
cores as well as primary, secondary, and tertiary flakes being present. All of the
materials exhibited early stages of reduction and were found on the slope just
below the base of the summit. These materials are currently housed at Hicks
and Company, Inc. in Austin. The authors of the site form believe that the source
of this chert is on the summit and adjacent slope. The report documenting their
work is not on file at TARL, and BVRA was not able to obtain a copy from Hicks
and Company.

METHODS
Background Research
Before entering the field, a background investigation was conducted. Site
records at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin, Texas were
checked for previously recorded sites in the project area and vicinity. In addition,
site reports documenting work in the region were examined for information
concerning archaeological surveys and other work relevant to the project area.
The project was discussed with the engineers and the General Manager of the
West Bell County WSC to ensure that the correct route was examined.
Field Survey
The fieldwork was accomplished using the pedestrian survey method
supported by limited shovel probing due to a lack of deep soil. The highway
right-of-way, as well as the proposed construction easement on private property,
was visually inspected. Both sides of Tally Ho Road were examined. Surface
visibility was excellent over most of the project area. The two intermittent creek
crossings, as well as the section of the pipeline near the recorded lithic
procurement area (41BL979) were carefully inspected. Altered chert cobbles
were identified during the pedestrian survey along the steep slope of the large hill
where the storage tanks are proposed. A sample of chert material was collected
for analysis in the laboratory to determine if these objects were cultural and not
the result of natural processes. The survey was documented by field notes and
images taken with a digital camera. A hand-held GPS was used to document
survey locations.

15

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The field survey identified a small scatter of altered chert cobbles along
the eastern slope of the large hill where the ground storage tanks will be
constructed. Only one altered chert cobble was observed on the surface at the
summit of the hill. We believe that these nodules originated in a ledge at or
below the summit of the hill. No finished tools were found, and no flakes were
present. Analysis of these materials in the laboratory determined that they were
not modified by man. No bulbs of percussion are present on any of the
specimens observed in the field or collected for analysis. The consensus is that
they were fractured by a naturally occurring fire.

16

RECOMMENDATIONS
The current survey identified a small scatter of altered chert cobbles on
the steep slope beneath the summit of the hill where the ground water storage
tanks are to be constructed. This area is not significant; therefore, it is
recommended that construction be allowed to proceed as planned. Should
evidence of an archaeological site be encountered during construction, all work
in the area of the find must cease until the situation can be evaluated by the
THC. Also, if the route of the pipeline or the location of the water storage tanks is
changed, the THC must be notified as additional survey by a professional
archaeologist may be warranted.
