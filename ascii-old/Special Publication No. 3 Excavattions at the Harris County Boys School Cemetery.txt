BY LAWRENCE E. ATEN

INTRODUCTION AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The Harris County Boys School is located on the east bank of Mud Lake (more recently referred to
by local real estate developers as Forest Lake) at its confluence with Clear Lake which, in turn, is a
small, westerly extension of the Galveston Bay estuary (Fig. I). In more general terms, the Boys School
property is located about 21 miles southeast of downtown Houston, Texas and a half mile east of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Johnson Space Center. Situated on the grounds of
the Harris County Boys School (which extends northward along the eastern shore of Mud Lake for
about ’¼ mile north of NASA Road 1) were four archeological sites known only by the following site
numbers: 41 HR 80, 85, 86, and 87. The first three of these sites have been the subject of archeological
investigations of one sort or another by the senior author. Unfortunately, as of May 1972, sites 41 HR
80 and 85 were largely destroyed and site 41 HR 86 was totally destroyed. Initially, these
investigations were conducted only by agreement with the county officials responsible for the school;
but later, subsequent to passage of the Texas Antiquities Code, they were conducted under terms of
Texas Antiquities Committee permits for archeological investigations No. 2 and No. 24. This present
report covers all data concerning the cemetery and its context at Boys School as well as appropriate
comparative mortuary data. It does not present subsistence and environmental data in any detail nor
does it attempt to deal with more intensive excavations in habitation areas of 41 HR 85, Area A or 41
HR 86. This present report is extensively revised and expanded from an earlier version coauthored by
Aten and Charles K. Chandler, and presented to the Texas Antiquities Committee in June 1971.
Two of the Boys School sites (41 HR 80 and 85) were originally located by Richard M. Cramley
(formerly of Houston) who briefly excavated at 41 14R 80 during May 1968. Evidently he encountered
human skeletal remains at the outset of his work and by the end had dug three five-foot grid units
encountering all or part of 12 burials. Several of these burials contained artifacts and this situation
attracted some attention both because of the paucity of known grave concentrations on the upper
Texas coast and because of the even more scarce occurrence of grave artifacts (other than occasional
columella beads). Gramley left Houston in June 1968, but before doing so he deposited the skeletal
material, artifacts, animal bone, and a sketch of the burial arrangement in Austin with Curtis D.
Tunnell, the Texas State Archeologist. Because of a general lack of information on upper Texas coast
mortuary practices and because of imminent plans (subsequently modified) by the Harris County
government to damage the site during construction in the summer of 1970, excavations were
commenced by the senior author during the summer of 1969 to obtain more extensive systematic data
on the cemetery.
A total of 30 work days (spanning four separate occasions between May 1969 and April 1972}
have been spent at the site with a crew varying widely in size, but averaging about five in number. All
field work was conducted under the general supervision of Aten although the second period of
excavation in the cemetery (March 22-29, 1970) was ably supervised by AI B. Wesolowsky. The work
undertaken at the Boys School sites has developed several aspects: the first concerned excavation of
the cemetery and of small stratigraphic tests to determine the general historical and cultural context
of the cemetery within the depositional sequence at the site. Second, because of the presence of thin,
unstratified occupation refuse lenses in some areas of the sites, attempts were made to excavate these
lenses using different techniques for the purpose of determining the most appropriate excavation
procedure. Third, extensive collections of faunal materials for quantitative studies of aboriginal
subsistence were made from all excavations at all sites. These latter two aspects, however, were
undertaken in conjunction with an area-wide research program dealing with settlement and
subsistence patterns on the upper coast and are not detailed here. The principal subjects of this
present report are the cemetery excavations and stratigraphic tests of 41 HR 80 and 85.

HARRIS COUNTY BOYS SCHOOL

For the purposes of this report, the division of labor was as follows: description of the excavation
program, analysis of physical and cultural stratigraphy, description and analysis of ceramics,
technological history, description and analysis of the cemeteries and burial practices, supplementary
comments on demography and conclusions were prepared by Aten; description and analysis of most of
the non-ceramic artifacts was prepared principally by Chandler; and description and analysis of the
human skeletal remains and demography were prepared by A1 B. Wesolowsky and R. M. Malina. These
latter were asked to report whatever in their judgment was considered to be relevant, but more
specifically, to make comments upon the demographic structure of the cemetery population, and upon
health and nutritional status of the various individuals so far as this could be determined. By mutual
agreement between Aten, Wesolowsky, and Malina, anthropometry, other than for stature
structions, was not considered relevant to our present problems and was not undertaken.
Many individuals have aided and participated in this project; so many, in fact, that it
unfortunately is not possible to itemize all of the helpful services and favors that have been rendered
and which are all much apprecia ted. However, I feel a particular obligation to mention the assistance
and cooperation received from Curtis D. Tunnell (Texas Historical Commission) who initially suggested
the project and helped to support it, and from Dee Ann Story (Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory) and David S. Dibble (Texas Archeological Survey) who also materially supported the
project.
Other individuals and groups who have been particularly helpful are (alphabetically): Aura Aten,
Charles N. Bollich, the Brazosport Museum of Natural Science Archeology Club (led by the late F.
Raymond Walley), Robert L. Cole, Douglas Comstock, B. M. Davidson, Glen Fredlund, Marge and Lou
Fullen, Thomas R. Hester, members of the Houston Archeological Society, John Kelley, James
McMichael, and Harry J. Shafer. James Malone and A1 B. Wesolowsky, at that time graduate students
in the Department of Anthropology at The University of Texas at Austin, willingly served long hours as
my field assistants on separate occasions. Moreover, Wesolowsky brought much humor and good
cheer to an otherwise cold and bleak field camp while excavating in March 1970. My colleague, Robert
K. Alexander of the University of Delaware, pointed out certain statistical inadequacies early in the
cemetery analysis for which I am grateful. Also, I am indebted to J. Richard Ambler (Northern Arizona
University) for access to field notes on burials from excavations he directed in the Wallisville
Reservoir in the summer of 1966. In the analysis of Galveston Bay area cemeteries, considerable use
was made of field notes and comparative collections housed at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory of The University of Texas at Austin. In spite of a!l this assistance from archeological
colleagues, work at Boys School could not have been carried out without the continuing cooperation,
goodwill, and assistance of Superintendent John A. Peters and Assistant Superintendent R. H. Baker.
Numerous other school personnel rendered the field crews many favors and we were particularly
appreciative of the efforts of the many school boys who volunteered to help with the excavation. The
cordiality of these relations with school officials, personnel, and students has been especially
gratifying to me personally.
RESEARCH BACKGROUND AND DESIGN
As was previously indicated, archeological attention was initially drawn to the sites at Boys
School because of the apparent potential for recovering mortuary data and that additional research
interests subsequently developed. I would like, then, to discuss the context of these developments. The
need for archeological investigation at Harris County Boys School, prompted by the anticipated
destruction of 41 HR 80, was adapted to an ongoing, more general program of investigation by the
senior author into the archeology of the upper Texas coast. Prior to the time this program began in the
mid-1960’s with the analysis of the Jamison Site materials (Aten 1967), systematic empirical data and
definition of problems were largely unavailable for this area. The Addicks Basin investigations of
Wheat (1953) had been cited frequently (e.g., Suhm, Krieger and Jelks 1954: 128-130) for a

EXCAVATION PROGRAM

characterization of Galveston Bay area culture primarily because little else was available. However,
resulting from the failure to recognize the importance of an evidently clear stratigraphic separation of
several key ceramic technological and stylistic developments (which Wheat indicated were present),
an ineffectual temporal framework has persisted in the local scientific literature. In the absence of a
viable chronological framework, it was not possible to recognize cultural trait distributions which
were required as the necessary first empirical steps toward generation of studies dealing with
problems of a higher order in this particular setting. Moreover, the Addicks study, in my view, served
to perpetuate the widespread myth of the prehistoric Galveston Bay area as one which was culturally
and developmentally dull (cf. Newcomb 1956; also see Willey 1968: 338) and, by implication, possibly
one from which little of interest could be learned about culture. Perhaps I overreact to the Addicks
report, but it is nevertheless a fact that most professional archeological fieldwork in Texas has been
conducted elsewhere than on the coast. To be sure, there are multiple reasons for this (not the least
being the location of water control construction projects), but one cannot help notice a distinct lack of
enthusiasm founded upon the factors outlined above.

HARRIS COUNTY BOYS SCHOOL

In my view, the only rational sequence of research in a situation of such limited information was to
concentrate initially upon gaining control over the temporal and spatial dimensions of the aboriginal
cultures of the area and then to develop subsequent research on this foundation. I have outlined
elsewhere (Aten 1971: 9-10) the general philosophical approach which was taken: namely, an interplay
of inductive and deductive approaches used to evaluate working hypotheses until a body of at least
partially true statements of culture-historical relationships has begun to emerge. This was not a
reflection of a reductionist point of view, but rather was a temporary strategy dictated by the existing
circumstances of data preservation and documentation.
When field work began at Boys School, data on mortuary practices in the Galveston Bay area
were likewise sparse (Aten 1965; Campbell 1957; Wheat 1953) and relatively unsynthesized. Some
unpublished comparative data was available in the form of the excavation notes recorded by E. R. Ring
of the Jamaica Beach Site cemetery; a few additional observations were gleaned from field notes and
photographs pertaining to the Caplen Site cemetery added to those amply reported by Campbell (1957);
and the field notes on a few burials from the Wallisville Reservoir area were made available by J. R.
Ambler. The quality of these data as sources of information for the present study ranges from the
sporadic and limited WPA documentation on Caplen to the very complete notes, sketches, and
photographs on Wallisville burials contained in Ambler’s notes. Subsequent excavations at Wallisville
Reservoir have revealed additional burials and these too are included in the discussion. Some other
burial discoveries are known, but they lack documentation in one or another critical aspect
(chronological context, form, associations, etc.) and, although discussed, are not utilized here.~ The
major objective at the outset of our work on the cemetery, then, was to describe the temporal, cultural
and demographic parameters of the Boys School cemetery.
It should be obvious that there are two basic research perspectives one might develop in a
problem such as this: (1) elucidation of cultural patterns within the cemetery population presumably
reflecting structural lines within a society; and (2) elucidation of cultural patterns between
populations. As will be seen, internal variation in the cemeteries appears to be of a very small order
and the analytical possibilities on a sample of this size are exhausted rather quickly. Moreover, the
absence of known contemporaneous cemeteries prohibits any synchronous cultural comparisons.
Diachronic variations between cemeteries do exist and for heuristic purposes are treated as
principally the result of evolution of a single culture system. However, at least one and perhaps more
cultural boundaries are probably crossed in our data (although this is not known with certainty) and
the extent to which such treatment is truly applicable is not at all clear. This report presents all the
data that can be mustered though, and therefore represents the best approximation we can presently
make. Any significant improvement or test of the conclusions presented here probably must be done
through excavation of additional cemeteries in the area.
Mortuary sites of the kind found on the upper coast offer a great many problems both in
excavation and in analysis. Acquisition of suitable samples of cemetery populations is a timeconsuming and expensive task, and is not a type of investigation in which dazzling progress has been
made. In an initial study such as this, dealing with data of varying quality and quantity, our main intent
has been to suggest correlated variables within populations and to suggest the course of shifts through
time in these correlations. Measurement of the strength of these relationships is probably beyond our
data capabilities at present and will not generally be approached in this paper. Hopefully, though, this
study will go far enough toward organization of the presently chaotic data on mortuary practices so
that coherent research on this important socio-cultural realm will continue. While no compulsion is felt
to be apologetic about any of the interpretations given here, it is freely acknowledged that, in some
instances, much interpretation and hypothesizing has been built on meager evidence. This, however, is
a necessary consequence of the present state of data availability, and unless some strenuous

Texas Archeological Society, Volume 44.

hypothesizing is not done, thereby suggesting the types and relevancy of mortuary data, the current
situation is likely to persist.

SITE DESCRIPTIONS
The excavations documented in this report took place at what originally were thought to be two
sites (41 HR 80 and 41 HR 85) which were separated by a deep gully through which flows an
intermittent stream. Based upon their configuration, however, it seems likely that these sites were
formerly a continuous mass of shell and other occupation refuse which has been dissected at some
more recent period (Fig. 2). In any event, the site is now physically separated into two areas of refuse,
and, for convenience, this distinction will be maintained throughout this report.

HARRIS COUNTY BOYS SCHOOL

41 HR 80
This site, which contains the aboriginal cemetery, is approximately 80 meters long (in a general
north-south direction), approximately 30 meters wide, and has a maximum surface relief of about 40
cm. (Fig. 2). The northern one-third of the site is used as a trash disposal area and the midden in that
area has been extensively disturbed by grading and burial of trash. The surface of the southern twothirds of the site also shows considerable signs of disturbance in the innumerable small hummocks and
depressions presumably reflecting the presence of modern pits for burial of dead domestic animals
from the Boys School farm. This site has been subjected to such disturbances for many years and were
it not for the known existence of the cemetery as a result of Gramley’s testing, the site would almost
certainly never have been selected by us for excavation.
Today, very little further excavation could be carried out in the upper portion (roughly,
Stratigraphic Unit 1; see discussion of physical stratigraphy) of this site due to extensive modern
disturbances. The widespread occurrence of the siltstone layer (Stratigraphic Unit 2; see Figure 3),
however, effectively serves as a stratigraphic marker capping a rather extensive accumulation of
preceramic refuse which apparently remains relatively undisturbed and available for investigation at
some future time.
41 HR 85
This site is approximately 50 meters long and, at a maximum, is about 20 meters wide (Fig. 2). The
greatest thickness of this site was encountered in Test Pit 2 where 85 cm. of refuse were penetrated. A
stratigraphic profile oriented roughly perpendicular to the major site axis is included in Figure 3.
Modern disturbances at this site at the time of excavation were more limited than those at 41 HR 80
and consisted of some erosion along an unpaved road that traverses the long axis of the site and some
domestic animal burials in the southwest portion of the site. As of May 1972, however, virtually all of
this site has been destroyed during landscaping of the new Boys School facilities which were
constructed nearby.
EXCAVATION PROCEDURES
The first work performed at the site in 1969 was to relocate and clear out Gramley’s excavation to
find metal grid stakes he had left buried and to continue excavation of burials he had located but not
removed. Once this had been accomplished, it was our intention to expand this excavation in all
directions. A new grid of one meter squares was established to coincide partially with Gramley’s grid
of 5 foot squares. This change in grid size was made for convenience in burial documentation and for
conformity with the measurement system in use on most other archeological projects being conducted
in the area at that time. All excavation grid units were identified by the coordinates of the grid
intersection in the northeast corner.
Simultaneously, a topographic map of the site was constructed and small holes were dug around
the perimeter of the site for the purpose of locating the limits of the shell midden and determining its
stratigraphic relationship to the underlying Pleistocene Beaumont Formation.
Excavations in the cemetery area were carried out by one-meter grid units and in 10 cm. levels
measured from the ground surface around each grid intersection. These levels were maintained
beyond the apparent limits of each burial and between burials, but ultimately proved to be of no great
value, presumably owing to the extensive prehistoric disturbance of the midden in the cemetery area.
Artifacts, animal bone, and other specimens located in proximity to a burial were documented as
to their position and were kept separately from those recovered in arbitrary levels. Most of these,
however, appear to be midden constituents (although some may have been grave goods from
prehistorically disturbed burials) rather than in situ grave goods. Admittedly this was often a
subjective judgment in view of the absence of clearly definable grave outlines. Nevertheless, if
specimens were not reasonably intact, modified in some way and/or placed in some obvious situational
relation to the skeleton, they were not considered to be grave goods for purposes of this analysis. Thus,

EXCAVATION PROGRAM

7

most potsherds, lithic debris, and faunal remains were excluded from grave analysis, while red ochre
scattered amongst the skeletal parts and brackish water mussel shells apparently lining the bottom of
several graves were not.
When skeletons were encountered they were as completely cleared of matrix as possible and all
burial dimensions and qualitative attributes (as given in Table 6) were recorded. Then, with the aid of
a one meter square wooden frame laced with strings forming a 10 cm. grid placed over the burial and
over at least one excavation grid intersection, a reasonably accurate sketch of all bones and
associated grave features was made. Sketches were supplemented by black and white and color slide
photography of each burial with and without the one-meter grid frame in place. Generally, only
approximate age (i.e., infant, juvenile, adult) was recorded in the field notes. All age, sex, and skeletal
observations reported here (Table 7) were made subsequently by Malina and Wesolowsky in the
laboratory.
Following field documentation of burials, they were usually removed from the ground
immediately. Some bone stabilization with gelva impregnation was performed in the field. Skeletons
were removed and packed for transportation by packaging and labeling separately the bones from
various anatomical segments of the body (e.g., right hand, left hand, vertebrae, right leg minus
extremity, etc.). Following the note-taking, sketching, and photography, all skeletal materials were
packaged and returned to Austin for additional cleaning and for study by the physical anthropologists
involved in this project. All field records, photographs, and specimens, except for the human skeletal
remains, have been deposited at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory of The University of
Texas at Austin. The human skeletal remains have been deposited at the Physical Anthropology
Laboratory of the same institution.
Simultaneously with commencement of the cemetery excavation, it was also intended to excavate
some stratigraphic tests in areas well away from the disturbances of burial emplacement to determine
the stratigraphic succession of specimens in the midden refuse. Since repeated grave excavation in
prehistoric times had taken place, there were many sherds, lithics, faunal remains, and oddments of
human skeletons scattered about between graves and in grave fill, thus inhibiting a direct
determination of the chronological position of the midden deposits in which the cemetery was
emplaced in the cemetery area proper.
Grid units U-99 and CC-93 (41 HR 80) and Test Pit 2 (41 HR 85) were started so as to aid in
developing a stratigraphic interpretation of campsite occupation at 41 HR 80-85 and to be used in
placing the cemetery in an historical context. The associated V-99 (41 HR 80) and Test Pit 2A (41 HR 85)
were dug only through the upper deposits to enlarge our sample of ceramics as encountered in the
original tests. Grid unit CC-93 (41 HR 80) was excavated to a depth of 80 cm. when the cemetery field
work was terminated. At that time, a small hole was dug to bedrock clay (reached at a depth of 102
cm.) to sample and describe the remainder of the stratigraphic section. Occupation refuse in this lower
22 cm. deep portion of CC-93 was very sparse, if present at all.
Subsequent to excavation of Test Pit 1, which was dug when it accidently became apparent that
some occupation refuse was present in the sandy field east of the shell midden, a line of shovel holes
was excavated at roughly two meter intervals between Test Pits 1 and 2 (Figures 2 and 3) for the
purpose of determining whether or not this non-shell occupation refuse was an isolated or a general
occurrence. The materials recovered are listed in Table 4 and, interestingly, included a Plainview
proiectile point. The issue here is whether or not occupation occurred at the site that did not entail
shellfish as an item of subsistence, for such a possibility had not been heretofore considered or
suggested for the upper coast on the basis of any field evidence. The problem was decidedly peripheral
to study of the cemetery but seemed worth looking into, especially since on one occasion heavy
overnight rains prevented us from working in the cemetery for a day or so.
On subsequent visits to the site, we excavated an additional five square meters of stratigraphic
testing in the sandy field adjacent to Test Pit 1, 8 square meters at a place designated 41 H~ 85/Area A
in an attempt at detailed excavation of an apparent Clear Lake Period single occupation shell lens (to

8

HARRIS COUNTY BOYS SCHOOL

be reported elsewhere), and two additional one meter square stratigraphic tests (BB-95 at 41 HR 80
and Test Pit 2B at 41 HR 85)to resample the shell midden for small vertebrate faunal remains using
improved techniques.
All excavated refuse was screened through 1/4 inch screen with small samples of matrix from each
level of U-99, and CC-93 (at 41 HR 80) and Test Pit 2 and 2A being washed through 1/16 inch screen to
recover small specimens, especially small faunal remains. These matrix samples have been picked for
faunal remains and while the recovery of animal bones was proportionally great (compared to 1A inch
screen recovery), the sample ultimately proved unsuitable to generating the quantitative data needed
for use in a major study of subsistence. For this reason, it was necessary (in May 1972) to excavate two
additional stratigraphic tests (BB-95 at 41 HR 80, and Test Pit 2B at 41 HR 85) in which all refuse was
fine-screened and our faunal sampling was thereby much improved. The artifacts recovered from
these tests are described here, solely for the convenience of not having to do it elsewhere; all faunal
analyses will be reported elsewhere. The excavation of these latter two tests, however, was not
directly related to the problem of the cemetery.
Most stratigraphic tests were excavated in 10 cm. levels, except for Test Pit 2 (41 HR 85) where
the second level was accidently dug five cm. too deep. Test Pit 1 (41 HR 85) was begun in 10 cm. levels,
but specimens were so sparse that it was finished in 20 cm. levels. Excavation of the adjacent test
squares 2 through 5 (41 HR 85) was done entirely in 20 cm. levels.
All specimens were kept in separate bags labeled with site, grid, and level numbers or by burial
association. All excavated grid units were labeled according to the coordinates of the northeast grid
stake. In the laboratory, all specimens were catalogued with the site number and a lot number which
signified, in abbreviated form, the provenience of the specimen within the sites. All recent trash items
were returned to the laboratory where they were tabulated and entered on specimen inventory forms
and then discarded. These tabulations of trash items were made to help provide some indication of the
extent of modern pit disturbances in the excavated areas, especially in the cemetery where graves
often occurred only a couple of centimeters under the ground surface.

PHYSICAL STRATIGRAPHY
The thickness of the midden at 41 HR 80 varies considerably (from a minimum of about 5 cm. to a
maximum of at least 115 cm.) and the surface of the bedrock clay (the Beaumont Formation) upon
which the site was founded was evidently irregular (Fig. 3). In the stratigraphic profiles presented in
Figure 3 and Table 2, the uppermost unit is a more or less disturbed zone resulting from burial of dead
farm animals and use of the area as a trash dump. The former naturally resulted in pits often marked
by surface depressions. Fortunately, we were able to avoid these except for two occasions, once in the
western end of the cemetery (as noted on Fig. 17), and again in Test Pit 2B in which situation we were
able to offset the excavation. Our repeated visits to this site over a period of several years gave some
insight into its use as a trash dumping area which helped in understanding the depositional situation.
The northern end of 41 HR 80 was evidently used to dump a sizeable pile of trash at the edge of the
bluff which was then covered by fill bulldozed from the adjacent midden; this area is shown as the
"graded area" on Figure 2. The remainder of the site was primarily used as a space upon which to
place piles of junk and trash which might range from old automobiles to wrecked office furniture. With
virtually every visit to the site, however, these piles would have been moved about or disappeared
entirely to be replaced later by something else. The result of this activity was a superficial churning of
the upper few centimeters (rarely more than 10 cm. and usually less) of the site and the consequent
incorporation of fragments of wire, glass, nails, etc. In most cases we began our controlled excavations
at the present ground surface since skeletal remains very often appeared virtually in the grass roots.
In the case of the stratigraphic test at BB-95, however, a layer of obviously recent fill overlay the shell
midden to a depth of about 10 cm. In this case, the fill was removed and controlled excavations began
at the top of the shell.

The issue of the nature of surface disturbance at 41 HR 80 was principally of importance in
regard to the cemetery. Since it was already clear to us from Gramley’s work that grave disturbance
was a common feature, it was important for satisfactory interpretation of mortuary practices to have
some idea if the disturbances were prehistoric or recent in origin. In an effort to acquire evidence on
this question, all refuse in the cemetery area was screened by grid square and level and all recent junk
or trash was retained along with the aboriginal artifacts. This trash was subsequently counted in the
laboratory (without regard to type of material), densities per square meter were plotted on a plan map
of the cemetery excavation, and then these data were contoured. This revealed the only major
occurrence of trash in the top two levels of the cemetery area to be in the vicinity of the previously
mentioned disturbance at the western end (Fig. 17). This supported our field impression that most of
the cemetery was undisturbed by any recent activity. In general, this topmost zone had the same
composition as Unit 1 (described below) except for the addition of trash and the greater amount of
rootlets and weathering of the shell.
Stratigraphic Unit I consists primarily of clam (Rangia cuneata and Rangia flexuosa) and oyster
(Crassostrea virginica) shells with a matrix of very dark grayish brown (10 YR 3/2) silty and clayey very
fine-grained sand. Stratigraphic Unit 2 consists of clam and oyster shells in essentially the same matrix
but with a relatively more dense concentration of siltstones (cf., Fig. 4B, Analysis Unit 5). Stratigraphic
Unit 3 consists of clam and oyster shells with a matrix of dark grayish brown (10 YR 4/2) silty and

10

clayey very fine-grained sand. The bedrock clay (i.e., the Beaumont Formation) consists of a mottled
yellow (10 YR 7/6) light brownish gray (10 YR 6/2) sandy clay. Locally there is an additional zone
(Stratigraphic Unit 4) recognized between Unit 3 and the underlying bedrock clay; Unit 4 contains
relatively less shell and relatively more clay than Unit 3. Based on analysis of bulk matrix samples
from U-99 and CC-93, it appears that the density of cultural to non-cultural debris (expressed as
percent by weight) in Units 1, 2, and 3 ranged between 10 percent and 16 percent; Unit 4, on the other
hand, had a density of about 1 percent. The persistent high proportion of siltstones in Unit 2 (although
they do occur in Units 1 and 3) is a somewhat unique feature. Extensive siltstone and sandstone lenses
exist in the Beaumont Formation and evidently these lenses outcrop on the bottom of Clear Lake since
some of the siltstones had oyster shells attached to them.
The now destroyed shell midden, 41 HR 85, also varied considerably in thickness and had a
somewhat different physical character than 41 HR 80. As shown on Figure 3 there were, from a
physical standpoint, two major stratigraphic zones overlying the bedrock clay (Beaumont Formation).
The zone labeled "dense Rangia and oyster midden" consisted of a grayish brown (2.5 Y 5/2) clayey
sand matrix with a density of cultural material ranging from about 7 to 9 percent. The upper part
(not more than 10 cm. below surface) of this unit contained small quantities of trash probably due
to the same causes described for 41 HR 80. The lower part of this upper unit (beginning around a depth
of 30 cm.) showed a noticeable increase in burned siltstones and probably correlates with
Stratigraphic Unit 2 at 41 HR 80.
The lower unit, that labeled "Sparse early shell midden" on Figure 3, consisted of a light brownish
gray clayey silt generally with a density of cultural material of about I to 3 percent.
Moving laterally to the northeast, away from the shell midden and towards the excavation labeled
"Area B", the sediment becomes markedly less organic and more sandy. For purposes of developing
data on the stratigraphic relationship between the apparent very light occupation located at Area B
and the adjacent shell midden, a series of small shovel holes were dug at two-meter intervals between
Test Pits i and 2 (Fig. 2) and a composite profile drawn (Fig. 3). The principal cultural zone occurred
around 15 to 20 cm. deep. The sediment incorporating the cultural material consisted of a light gray
(10 YR 7/1) silty sand. This was underlain by a light brownish gray (10 YR 6/2) sandy clay with orange
mottles and iron concretions (i.e., the Beaumont Formation) at a depth of about 40 cm.
CULTURAL STRATIGRAPHY
An initial problem to be overcome at Boys School was to determine some manner of linking
together subparts or levels of the several excavations for purposes of analysis. Initially we turned to
the physical stratigraphy. Although Stratigraphic Unit 2 was an excellent marker for 41 HR 80, we
were left uncertain about correlating individual excavation levels above and below Unit 2. And, of
course, we could not accurately trace Unit 2 into 41 HR 85. We then turned to the distribution of
artifacts, but these were so scarce in the preceramic levels that they were of no significant assistance
in relating excavation levels to each other. We then turned to the sequence of relative proportions of
shellfish species in each level since earlier analysis of shellfish from bulk matrix samples had
indicated the presence of a consistent pattern of change that might serve as the basis for seriation
(Table 1). This, however, would require guessing on several of the excavation levels from the earlier
tests since only in BB-95 and Test Pit 2B was this information available for each level.
We then turned to the burned siltstones. These are materials that had to be introduced into the
site through some form of cultural action, and as was mentioned earlier, were thought to be closely
related to collection of oysters--a resource known to have fluctuated substantially in its use at the site.
Moreover, the siltstones had been collected and counted from nearly all levels of all excavations at the
site. Their drawback is that they tend to break and our tabulation had to include estimates of how
many siltstones may have broken from others during and subsequent to excavation. In spite of this
possible weakness, graphic plots of the percentage of the total number of siltstones occurring in each
level of a given stratigraphic test showed remarkable similarities in pattern (Fig. 4A). To further

demonstrate just how similar these patterns are the data points from Figure 4A have been
superimposed in Figure 4B and a sequence of twelve seriated stratigraphic reference points
(subsequently termed "analysis units’e) results~ to one of which each excavation level has been
assigned (Table 2). As a check on our hypothesis of association between rate of oyster exploitation and
siltstone occurrence, the average frequency of oysters (expressed as percent of total shell weight in
any given excavation level or bulk matrix sample, as the case may be) is also given in Fig. 4C. While
there are clear similarities between the shape of the curve in Fig. 4B and in Fig. 4C (for C. virginica),
the correspondence is not a perfect one. In this regard, it is doubtful that the rise of C. virginica to 25
percent in Analysis Unit 12 has much significance inasmuch as the size of the shellfish sample here is
very small and substantially smaller than that for Analysis Unit 11 (cf., Tables 1 and 2). Just where the
remaining problem lies (e.g., sample error or a partially faulty hypothesis--either or both are
possibilities) we cannot be sure. In any event, the siltstone frequencies, by virtue of their repetitive
patterns have been used to organize the levels of all stratigraphic tests (except 41 HR 85, Area B) into a
single sequence for purposes of further analysis of the cemetery and of the other cultural materials
(cf., Fig. 16, Table 2). 41 HR 85, Area B (Fig. 2) was not shell midden and consequently no siltstones
occurred. However, based on the density of cultural materials recovered, it appears that the cultural
zone in Area B occurred around a depth of 15 to 20 cm. As may be seen on Figure 3, /re project a
correlation of the Area B refuse with some portion of the upper midden zone of the 4.. HR 85 shell
midden. Radiocarbon dates thus far run on midden refuse (Valastro, Davis, and Varela 1975: 80) are
consistent with the ordering of Analysis Units, although they are too few in number to provide a
significant test of it. These dates are discussed below.
1. TX-968A: 2170 _+_180 B.P., or 220 B.C. _+_180 radiocarbon years. This date was obtained on
small charcoal fragments occurring throughout the 10-25 cm. level of Test Pit 2 at 41 HR 85 (Fig. 3).
2. TX-968B: 1500 _+-70 B.P., or A.D. 450 _+_70 radiocarbon years. This date was obtained on
Rangia cuneata shell taken from Bulk Matrix Sample No. 2A (10-15 cm. depth) in Test Pit 2 at 41 HR 85
(Fig. 3). Applying the formula for correcting such shell dates (as discussed in Valastro, Davis, and
Varela 1975: 77) a corrected date of A.D. 683 _+_103 radiocarbon years is obtained.
3. Tx-969:3670-+-80 B.P., or 1720 B.C._+_ 80 radiocarbon years. This date was obtained on Rangia
cuneata shell taken from Bulk Matrix Sample No. 4 (65 to 70 cm. depth) in Test Pit 2 at 41 HR 85 (Fig. 3).
Again applying the correction for Rangia shell dates, an age estimate of 1476 B.C. _+-103 radiocarbon
years is obtained.
Tx-969 correlates with Analysis Unit 9; Tx-968A and Tx-968B both ostensibly correlate with
Analysis Unit 3. Unfortunately, several factors combine at this point to minimize the utility of these
latter dates. First, at this early stage of fieldwork in the Galveston Bay area, we did not fully
appreciate the much more compressed nature of superposition in shell middens ringing the upland
bluffs as opposed to the more "expanded" stratification in the marshland middens, as in the Trinity
River delta. Second, in excavating the 10-20 cm. level of Test Pit 2, an error was made and the level
was bottomed out at 25 cm. depth. Third, the occurrence in Galveston Bay area shell middens of
charcoal in sufficient quantity for radiocarbon dating is rare. Such charcoal ordinarily does not occur
in discrete hearths but becomes scattered about in the vicinity of where a fire once existed. As luck
would have it, such an area of increased density of charcoal occurred in the 10-25 cm. level of Test Pit
2 and, as became evident when excavating later tests, this particular depth range embraced both
preceramic and early ceramic refuse. Tx-968B comes from the upper third of this level while Tx-968A
represents either a discrete earlier event or an average of the entire interval. Consequently, the
circumstances surrounding these two dates are regrettably sloppy; however, they are not wholly
without value. Considering the sample collection locations it is probably realistic to correlate Tx-968A
with Analysis Unit 3 or 4, and Tx-968B with Analysis Unit 2.
In an effort to determine the stratigraphic relationship of the cemetery to the remainder of the
site, we note that all burials except two appeared to be entirely within Stratigraphic Unit 1. More to
the point, though, we note that the deepest part of all except two of the 29 burials with this data

recorded (some burials having been assigned numbers in the laboratory) are not more than 30 cm. deep
and over 50% are not more than 20 cm. deep. Of the 26 burials with data recorded for their shallowest
portions, all are within 20 cm. of the surface, and 65% are within 10 cm. of the surface. Consequently,
it is not unreasonable to conclude that the graves originated from a ground surface approximating that
of the present, and post-dating the last major deposition of occupational refuse in the immediate
vicinity of the cemetery (Fig. 16).
Although the age of the cemetery will be discussed further in Chapter III (Description of the Boys
School and Other Galveston Bay Area Mortuary Data) after the artifacts and their occurrence have
been described, we might as well at this point describe an abortive attempt at obtaining radiocarbon
dates directly from the human bone (Valastro, Davis, and Verela 1975: 80).
1. Tx-1059:640 -+-130 B.P., or A.D. 1310 _+_130 radiocarbon years. This date was obtained on
metacarpals and tarsals, calcaneus, talus, vertebrae fragments, long bone fragments and a scapula
fragment from Burial 1.
2. Tx-1060:2140 _+_380 B.P., or 190 B.C. _+_380 radiocarbon years. This date was obtained on
scapulae, sacrum, cranial and calcaneus fragments, left clavicle, and right innominate bones of Burial
2.
The excavation of the grave for Burial 2 appears to have disturbed the remains of Burial 1 and
thus be younger; the dates, however, do not even reflect that relationship. Given the relative
consistency of our artifact and stratigraphic data it appears more prudent to set aside this
radiocarbon data from further consideration at this time. Obviously something is wrong and even
though it is possible to speculate on a variety of possible sources of the problem, the fact is that no
strong evidence exists to point us in the direction of any of these possibilities.
Finally, we must point out that in conjunction with the previously mentioned analysis of
subsistence, some 13 Rangia cuneata samples have been examined for their season of collection
according to the method briefly outlined in Aten (1972). While this method will be described in detail
elsewhere, the results may have significance for our subsequent consideration of technological history
at Boys School. These results are that from Analysis Unit 10 (stratigraphically earlier samples were
not suitable for examination) through Analysis Unit 8, the season of clam collection was primarily the
end of July through the end of August. Beginning with Analysis Unit 7 and continuing until Analysis
Unit 1, collection occurred between mid May and mid June. As will be seen, this change in scheduling
occurs more or less simultaneously with some important changes in lithic technology.

II. DESCRIPTION AND ANALYSIS OF THE
ABORIGINAL TECHNOLOGY
BY LAWRENCE E. ATEN AND CHARLES K. CHANDLER

This section will deal with description and classification of the aboriginal artifacts recovered
from the cemetery and stratigraphic test excavations at 41 HR 80 and 41 HR 85. In the following
discussions these artifacts are first classified into 4 maior categories, depending upon the material
from which they were made: i.e., clay, stone, bone, or shell. Within these general groups, the artifacts
are further divided into more discrete classes according to shared morphological characteristics and,
in some cases, presumed functional identity. These classes are often separated into finer groupings,
each of which shares several specific features, such as "contracting stem dart points". Where
possible, as in the case of certain ceramics and proiectile points, these final groupings are identified
with established types, but more often they are given the status of a descriptive category.
In the interest of conserving space, the following abbreviations and symbols are used routinely
throughout the descriptions.
1. Specimen numbers are given as a hyphenated pair; the first number (80 or 85)refers either to
site 41 HR 80 or 41 HR 85 respectively, and the second refers to the catalogue or burial number (in the
case of the latter, only physical proximity to the burial is necessarily implied; not cultural
associations). The provenience of each specimen can be determined by checking catalogue or lot
number on the artifact distribution tables (Tables 3 and 4) for the appropriate site. The only exception
to this procedure is that for the purpose of presenting this data, all specimens from the cemetery fill
(i.e., not clearly associated with a grave) are grouped together in Table i under the heading "Cemetery
Fill". These specimens are indicated in the following descriptions by the presence of a "C" following
the lot number. These latter specimens are actually catalogued for their grid and level occurrence
(except for those recovered by Gramley) and can be so restudied in the laboratory. Our inspection of
artifact distributions in the cemetery fill, however, indicates that anlysis of this sort is not fruitful and
we do not wish to inflate the text with tables that do not, at this time, seem useful. This procedure
results principally from the fact that cemetery area is so thoroughly churned by aboriginal grave
excavations, that no argument for preservation of original spatial associations of midden refuse can be
made within the confines of the cemetery. Excavation units which yielded no specimens are omitted
from the artifact distribution tables.
2. Dimensions (always given in millimeters) are given under the following headings: L = maximum
length; W = maximum width; T = thickness; S.L. = stem length; S.W. = maximum stem width; and
M.S.W. = miminum stem width (used only on expanding stem proiectile points}.
3. Material (Mat) for chipped stone artifacts is given as C (chert}, S (silicified wood), and Q
(quartzite}.
4. Measurements of broken specimens for which a dimension could reasonably be estimated are
indicated by an asterisk (*).
5. All color measurements are given in Munsell color numbers and terminology.

CERAMICS
Approximately 1600 potsherds were recovered from the cemetery excavations and an additional
750 sherds (roughly) were recovered from stratigraphic tests. As has already been stated, the initial
excavation and analysis of the Harris County Boys School Site was for the main purpose of studying the
mortuary practices; limited stratigraphic testing was done primarily to determine the range of
occupation periods represented in the midden refuse as part of the effort to determine the period of
use of the cemetery and the identity of the artifacts found in the cemetery area fill; i.e., were they from
midden refuse or disturbed graves. Nevertheless, some unexpected specimens were recovered which
indicate the presence of ceramic traits related to the Tchefuncte Period of the lower Mississippi

Valley. Such material has recently appeared as a prominent component of assemblages in the Sabine
Lake area and, in a more attenuated form, in early ceramic assemblages from the Trinity River deltaic
plain.
Development of a practical and reliable ceramic typology to be used as the basis of a
chronological framework for the upper Texas coast has been a problem that has not easily yielded a
solution. The sources of difficulty were largely a lack of many well-documented samples, and a lack of
many suitable attribute-state criteria which permit unequivocal sorting. As a result of having studied
large quantities of ceramics from the lower drainages of the Sabine, Neches, Trinity, San Jacinto and
Brazos Rivers of the upper coast area, the essential ceramic typological outlines now seem much more
clear (Aten, MS).
The principal bases for type separation are those of presence or absence of decoration, presence
or absence of temper, kind of temper, and presence or absence of certain fairly obvious paste
characteristics such as the thick walls, contorted texture, and poorly-wedged coils characteristic of
Tchefuncte ceramics versus the even-textured, more homogeneous paste of the Goose Creek types.
Some attempts have been made to define types on the additional bases of such attributes as color and
hardness (Ambler 1970, 1973); however, these attribute states have been found to be essentially
unsortable at the typological level even though some do tend to describe the appearance of certain
local ceramic manifestations (Aten, MS; Aten and Bollich 1969). The most obvious solution to the
problem of equivocally sortable attributes is that probably we should resort, in the future, to a typevariety form of taxonomy of the kind described by Phillips (1970: 23-31) as opposed to type-variety as
presented by other authors. The background and evidence for this taxonomic framework vis-a-vis that
suggested by Ambler (1970, 1973) are discussed further in Aten (MS).
Principally as a result of stratigraphic testing in the nearby Wallisville Reservoir, located at the
mouth of the Trinity River, and with corroborating data from Harris County Boys School, the Brazos
delta, and the Sabine Lake area, the chronological sequence of the recognized ceramic types has been
largely determined for the Galveston Bay area (Aten, MS). This sequence of ceramic types and
assemblages and a set of derived ceramic chronological periods is given in Figure 16 and constitutes
the basic historical framework within which the Harris County Boys School data is considered.
Most of the pottery types and descriptive categories found at the Harris County Boys School have
been defined previously, and these prior definitions will be heavily relied upon except where
modifications are suggested.
TEMPERED CERAMICS
San lacinto Plain
On a very few sherds of this type were recovered. The paste characteristics are identical to those
presented in the type description (Aten 1967: 13-14) and in Ambler (1967: 39-42) and Aten (MS).
San Jacinto Incised
Only one sherd of this type was recovered and it is identical to that discussed in the type
description (Aten 1967: 14). It is a rim sherd (direct with interior thinning, and lip notches) and the
design consists of a set of three horizontal lines immediately below the lip.
Unclassified grog-tempered plain
A single sherd was recovered from the surface of 41 HR 85 which was abundantly tempered with
grog (probably crushed sherd) fragments. The surface is extensively crackled. The general
appearance of this sherd is much more reminiscent of grog-tempered plainwares found around the
southern periphery of the Caddo area than of the indigenous grog-tempered type San Jacinto Plain.
Conway Plain
Some 23 sherds of this tentatively proposed type were found at Boys School. The definition of this
type will be published in a report on stratigraphic testing in the Sabine Lake area by Bollich and Aten.
The principal characteristic of the type as it thus far has been formulated (primarily by Bollich) is the

ABORIGINAL TECHNOLOGY

17

presence of abundant and relatively large sand grains embedded in a silty or clayey matrix, with no
intermediate grain sizes. Since such grain size combinations seem to be unlikely (or, at least, rare) in
the sediments of the coastal area it is felt that the implication of this~ kind of paste is that the sand is
indeed tempering and not a natural constituent of the clay source; this latter being in contrast to the
character of the Goose Creek pastes.
In the Sabine Lake area, this type has been found to be partly contemporaneous with Tchefuncte
ceramics but to continue after their disappearance. Several of these sherds have been recovered
bearing noded rims. The paste characteristics, vessel form (as best it can be determined), lip notching
and rim nodes, and stratigraphic placement and associations all led Bollich to suggest (and we concur)
that this pottery may be technologically related to the Alexander pottery complex plainware, O’Neal
Plain, as it is known from the Lake Ponchartrain area of southeast Louisiana (Ford and Quimby 1945:
65) although no podal supports have yet been discovered. Recently this type has also been noted in an
early context in the Wallisville Reservoir (Aten, MS).
No decorated sherds nor any rim or base sherds were recovered from Boys School; only the
characteristic paste attributes. The average thickness of 10 sherds was 5.4 ram.
Unclassified bone-tempered plain
Two undecorated body sherds of a bone-tempered ceramic were recovered in the surface
collection from 41 HR 85 and one from BB-95. The HR 85 sherds both are sufficiently similar in color,
texture, and thickness to have been from the same vessel. The paste consists of a silty clay and is
abundantly tempered with bone fragments averaging about one millimeter in diameter. The core is
poorly developed and the color is brown to olive and reddish brown. Average thickness is about 5.7
ram. No indication of vessel form or any form attribute is observable in these two sherds.
UNTEMPERED CERAMICS
Tchefuncte Plain
This well-known Lower Mississippi Valley pottery type was found in several areas of the Boys
School sites, and totaled nearly 50 sherds (Fig. 6 C,E) representing perhaps six or eight vessels. Such
material is beginning to be recognized widely on the upper Texas coast and is included as a constituent

of the Clear Lake Period ceramic assemblage (Fig. 16). Many of the Texas sherds have been compared
directly with the Tchefuncte type specimens at Louisiana State University (by Bollich and Aten) and
were found to be morphologically identical. In view of the stratigraphic and radiocarbon data on this
material from near Beaumont (Bollich and Aten, unpublished data), from the Wallisville Reservoir
(Aten, MS), and at Harris County Boys School, as well as the several other Tchefuncte ceramic traits
that are also found in association with this material (see below), there can be no doubt that we are
dealing with Tchefuncte ceramics.
The principal differences between the Texas material and the Ponchartrain Tchefuncte other
than their cultural contexts are the diminished absolute and relative abundance of sherds and the
reduced repertoire of vessel form attributes in the Texas sites. Only three rim sherds representing as
many vessels were recovered (oriented profiles are given in Fig. 5, B-D), but it was possible to measure
their average body thickness and to estimate their orifice diameter. These are:
Fig. 5, B (85-6) - 9.6 ram. avg. thickness; 200 mm. est. diameter
Fig. 5, C (80-118C) N 12.2 mm. avg. thickness; 200 mm. est. diameter
Fig. 5, D (80-138C) - 9.3 mm. avg. thickness; 187 ram. est. diameter
No base sherds were recovered, although two flat bases of the closely related type Mandeville
Plain were found (Fig. 5, E). The average body thickness of 23 sherds was 8.4 mm. with a standard
deviation of 1.2 ram. A major difference between the original type description of Tchefuncte Plain
(Ford and Quimby 1945: 52-54) on the one hand, and the Texas and Louisiana specimens on the other
(including the type specimens), is the presence of clay (sherd of grog) temper in the former and its
absence in the la tter.
Tchefuncte paste with interior incising
Two sherds, possibly from separate vessels, were recovered from the cemetery fill which have
excellent Tchefuncte paste characteristics but are incised with sets of parallel vertical lines on the
interior. One in particular is deeply incised with ridges of clay pushed up on either side of the incision
(Fig. 6D). Investigating the possibility that this may have been a grater, the ridges of clay were
examined microscopically, with negative results; no sign of wear or abrasion could be seen. No
typological construct exists for interior incised Tchefuncte ware and none is needed here for our
present problems. Interior incising is a widespread occurrence on the northern Gulf Coast but appears
in minute quantities (Neyland and Aten 1971); it has not previously been reported on Tchefuncte
ceramics.

ABORIGINAL TECHNOLOGY

Tchefuncte Stamped
Six sherds from a single vessel of Tchefuncte Stamped were recovered from the cemetery
excavation. The design consists of vertical rows of rocker-stamping executed with either a notched or
forked tool (Fig. 6A, B). This peculiar rocker-stamping technique is very common in the Tchefuncte
Period of Louisiana (Ford and Quimby 1945: 56-57}. The average body thickness of this vessel is 9.4
mm., and the estimated vessel diameter at the rim is 187 mm. An oriented rim profile is illustrated in
Fig. 5A.
One sherd from this vessel came from Gramtey’s collection (for which we have no provenience
other than that it came from the burial area) and the remainder all came from the fill in and
immediately under the remains of Burial 9 (Fig. 19A; one sherd can be seen immediately right of the
proximal end of the tibia in the lower foreground}. This burial was extensively fragmented and
disarticulated, and so it would be difficult to make any kind of argument for association between the
Tchefuncte Stamped sherds and the emplacement of Burial 9.
Goose Creek Plain
For discussions and descriptions of vessel-forming techniques, paste characteristics, surface
finish, and vessel form, the reader is referred to the revised type description (Aten 1967: 10) and to
further elaboration by Ambler (1967: 31}. The Goose Creek sandy paste plainwares from the Harris
County Boys School are, for the most part, adequately characterized by these prior descriptions. We
can, however, make some additional observations.
With respect to rim forms, three types occurred in the Boys School sample and these are
illustrated in Figure 5F (direct with interior thinning}, G (direct with flat lip}, H and I (direct with
rounded or sharp lip). The distribution of these rim forms in the various excavation areas is given
below. Because of the small number of specimens, these are not separated by Analysis Units.

What is meant here by flat and conical base form probably needs no explanation, but the flat,
noded and rounded forms are illustrated in Figure 5E, J and K respectively.
All in all, this is a fairly homogeneous pottery group although a vague distinction does appear to
be taking shape (in terms of types and rim forms present) between the sherds recovered in the
cemetery excavation versus those in the U-99 and V-99 stratigraphic tests (the other excavations
produced so few Goose Creek Plain sherds they really are not worth discussing from the standpoint of
intra-type variation). To pursue this point a little further, we may make two additional observations.
The first is qualitative and is that there is a marked difference between the cemetery fill and U and V99 in the adequacy of coil wedging. Goose Creek Plain sherds from the cemetery fill show a decidedly
greater tendency to break along coil junctures and to preserve the cylindrical form of the coil than do
sherds in U-99 and V-99. This, of course, is a prime characteristic of Tchefuncte ceramics which are
relatively abundant in the cemetery fill and are virtually absent in U and V-99.
The second observation concerns average body sherd thickness. Approximately a hundred Goose
Creek Plain body sherds from each excavation area were selected at random and their thickness was
measured (cemetery fill, N = 102; U & V-99, N = 101). The average body thickness for Goose Creek Plain
sherds in the cemetery fill is 5.27 mm. with a standard deviation of 0.94 mm.; the average thickness for
sherds from U and V-99 was 4.86 mm. with a standard deviation of 0.79 mm. The difference between
these means is very small but the number measured is large, so a t-test for determining the probability
of having sampled sherd populations with different mean thicknesses (and therefore some different
structural features) was calculated. The resulting t value was 3.4288 which, at 201 degrees of
freedom, is highly significant at the .001 level.
What all of this gets back to is that there is measurable variability within the Goose Creek Plain
type, but not in terms of unequivocally sortable attributes (i.e., not in terms of the kind of features
required as typological criteria). Thus, if there were some good reason to do so (and we do not
presently see one associated with analysis of the mortuary complex), we could consider separating the
cemetery fill plainware from the U and V-99 plainware as varieties within the Goose Creek Plain type
on the basis of the aforementioned differences. For our present purposes it is sufficient to note that
there is a difference between the Goose Creek Plain ceramic technology in the cemetery fill versus that
in U and V-99 that is probably related to time (since Clear Lake Period ceramics occur in the cemetery
fill and not in U and V-99).
Goose Creek Incised
The morphological characteristics of this type are adequately described in the revised type
description (Aten 1967: 11); also recommended is Ambler (1967). Aten (MS) has attempted to organize
and synthesize the limited data available on Goose Creek Incised design styles into an understanding of
the general changes through time in these design assemblages. This effort has only been partially
successful and to achieve much success, requires samples larger than those present here. In the Boys
School sample only six sherds are sufficiently complete to permit documentation of the entire design
motif and for this reason no serious design analysis is feasible. Most of the incised sherds are from U
and V-99 (likewise a reflection of age younger than the cemetery ceramics) and their designs consist of
sets of horizontal lines, horizontal and vertical lines, wavy horizontal lines and some punctations.

ABORIGINAL TECHNOLOG Y

21

One unusual specimen from U-99, lot 12 is illustrated in Figure 7G. AlthOugh difficult to see in the
illustration, the design appears to have been executed by a drag and jab technique. Another unusual
specimen from the cemetery fill is illustrated in Figure 7E. The design on this vessel is unusual in that it
consists of a set of widely spaced, parallel, vertical lines that extend from near the base to well up the
side of the vessel. The rim area is not preserved so we cannot be sure if this is all there is to the design.
It is also worth noting that of the 11 incised sherds with rims preserved, 9 are direct with flat lips, one
is direct with round lip, and one is direct with interior thinning.

Goose Creek Red-Filmed
Only 7 sherds of this type were recovered, and all were from the cemetery. These sherds are
virtually identical in their paste characteristics to those discussed in the original type description
(Aten 1967: 11-13).
Rim sherds from three vessels are present, two of which are direct with flattened lip and one is
direct with sharp lip. The principal time of popularity of this type, based primarily on stratigraphic
excavations at Wallisville Reservoir, is during the Turtle Bay and Round Lake Ceramic Periods (Fig.
16). However, occasionally a sherd of red-filmed pottery shows up in both earlier and later contexts
where there is no physical possibility for accidental mixing with Turtle Bay and/or Round Lake Period
refuse. It is highly inadvisable that any attempt be made to revise the ceramic chronology on the basis
of such data as we have from Boys School for it is decidedly inferior in its stratigraphic discrimination
to that available at Wallisville.

Goose Creek Stamped
Nine sherds apparently representing at least seven vessels were recovered which had paste
characteristics identical to those of the other Goose Creek wares but which were decorated with a
variety of forms of rocker stamping. This ceramic will be proposed as the type Goose Creek Stamped in
a forthcoming report on stratigraphic testing in the Wallisville Reservoir (Aten, MS) and appears to be
a good marker for the Clear Lake Period. Three rim sherds are present all of which are direct with
interior thinning and have lip notching. The average thickness of the sherds is 5.1 ram. Four of these
sherds, all of which came from the cemetery fill, are illustrated in Fig. 7A-D, F. The stamped designs
were evidently made both with narrow and wide curved instruments. Sometimes the tool impression is
neat and complete (Fig. 7C-D, F) while for others the impression was made only at the ends of the stamp
when it was rocked to advance to the next position (Fig. 7A-B). Of the nine sherds from Boys School, all
except one was found in the cemetery fill, which is where the bulk of the other ceramics with
Tchefuncte pottery complex affiliations were found.
Mandeville Plain
Some ten sherds of this type were recovered at the Harris County Boys School. The original
description of this type (Ford and Quimby 1945; 62) is beset with the terminological problems
previously noted for the Tchefuncte types and only an inspection of the original type material at
Louisiana State University has served to clarify the situation for our usage.
The principal characteristics of the type specimens are sandy clay paste with contorted texture
and poor coil wedging; also, no sherd or grog tempering was seen. The fact that these characteristics
are not made clear in the type description evidently caused problems for Phillips (1970:109-110) in his
attempt at synthesis of Lower Mississippi Valley pottery. He concluded that, at best, Mandeville Plain
should be considered a variety of Tchefuncte Plain. This is not the place to argue the problem but we
will maintain that the physical distinction between Tchefuncte and Mandeville paste characters is
clear and that Mandeville Plain has a distribution related to, but disjunct from, Tchefuncte Plain and
should thus be retained as a separate construct.
The Harris County Boys School specimens as well as much larger samples from Wallisville
Reservoir and the Sabine Lake area have paste characteristics very much the same as the Louisiana
type specimens. The small sample from 41 HR 80 does not include any rim sherds but does include two
flat bases (Fig. 5E). This type also forms the bulk of the collections from Wallisville Reservoir utilized
by Ambler (1970) to propose the type Lost River Plain. All of us working in the Galveston Bay area
failed initially to recognize this material as Mandeville, but most of us can now see that this is the case
and that the type Lost River Plain should be abandoned.

Unclassified fingernail punctated ware
Five sherds from a single vessel recovered from an eroded area of 41 HR 85 are sandy paste, thin
(about 4 ram.), hard and uniformly black in color, and have a zone extending about 40 ram. below the
lip containing vertical columns of fingernail punctations. At 40 ram. below the lip the zone of
punctations is terminated by a single horizontal incised line. The vessel wall below this line was
evidently undecorated. The rim was everted, direct, and has been modified with small scallops.
The decoration and upper vessel form appear to be much like the vessel illustrated in Plate 79K
under "Miscellaneous Fulton Aspect Utility Pottery" in Suhm and Jelks (1962). On the other hand, the
paste is very hard and compact, and contains no grog. In view of the relative variety, if not abundance,
of Tchefuncte ceramic complex traits at Boys School, we may therefore speculate on the possibility of
dealing with a variety of Alexander Pinched (Ford and Quimby 1945: 64-65).

Blade: roughly triangular with edges slightly concave, straight or slightly convex; weak to
prominent shoulders without barbs.
Stem: contracting sides with convex bases.
Comment: all specimens are bifacially worked; however, specimen 80-2 is only casually so. The
blade edges are worked on the dorsal flake surface only and this gives the edges a steep, beveled
effect. The stem and one shoulder have minimal flaking on the ventral flake surface. Specimen 80-13 is
manufactured from a previously made biface. This is evidenced by heavy patina over most of the
blade surfaces inside the more recent biracial edge chipping. This same specimen also has asphalt
adhering to the stem. On the 50.9 ram. long specimen from 80-146, asphalt covers the entire stem up to
the shoulders. On 85-43 asphalt covers the entire stem and extends on to the blade.

Dart point fragments
This category is represented by five specimens. One (80-16) is a dart point blade; three (80-16, 804, 80-B9C) are rectangular stem fragments with convex bases; and one (80-31C) is a fragment of a
comparatively large contracting stem dart point with lightly smoothed la teral stem edges. It is broken
diagonally across the blade just above the stem ar~ part of this broken edge has marginal retouch. It is
not clear whether this edge was used as a tool or whether this retouch flaking may be accidental.

Other Chipped Stone Artifacts
Biface
Specimen 80-147 is a bifacially chipped, irregularly triangular tool made of chert; no wear was
evident to suggest function. The specimen measures 48.4 ram. long, 25.1 mm. wide, and 14.3 ram. thick.
Abraded biface fragment
Specimen 85-44 is an irregular blade fragment of a narrow, chert biface. Its present dimensions
are 37.5 mm. long, 17.7 mm. wide, and 8.7 mm. thick. Presumably this specimen was at one time the distal tip of a projectile point (there being very few other large bladed lithic implement classes on the
upper Texas coast), but it shows heavy abrasion on all ridges and humps around flake scars, including
the edges of the break at the proximal end. Evidently this specimen, though perhaps a projectile point
originally, had some subsequent use involving considerable handling either as an implement or for
another purpose. Although it might have been abraded in a stream or on a beach, no such high-energy
environments exist at the site and the specimen would still have had to be brought in through some
means related to the human occupation.
Unclassified biface fragments
This category is represented by two convex basal fragments of what have frequently been
referred to as knives. Both are bifacially chipped by the percussion technique and lack marginal
retouching. One (85-27) has a small area of nodular cortex on the basal portion. These specimens are
too fragmentary to estimate length but both appear to have been ovoid in form.

Miscellaneous biface fragments
These are three specimens (80-151, 85-37, and 85-45), each made from chert, which are
unidentifiable to any further extent.

Drill
The one drill recovered from the 41 HR 80 excavations (80-15) is small and bipointed (Fig. 8, F). Its
length is 13.4 ram. and maximum width is 3.3 ram.; the width is 2 ram. at a distance of I ram. from each
point. One end is essentially triangular in cross section and the other is essentially square. This
artifact fits well in the holes of most of the small beads (Styles F and G) and it appears likely that a tool
of this form was used for drilling such holes. This specimen appears to be made from a rectangular,
elongate chert splinter obtained either as a burin spall or debris from bipolar flaking. Such drills are
relatively common in coastal Texas sites.
In addition, two chert drill fragments were recovered from Test Pit 2B (specimens 85-44 and 8545). 80-45 was only a bit fragment and appears to have had a maximum diameter of 4.0 ram. 80-44 had
a maximum bit diameter of 3.3 ram. and appears to have had an enlarged base.

34

HARRIS COUNTY BOYS SCHOOL

Stone awl
This specimen (85-37) was an elongate chert splinter, rectangular in cross-section, that has been
chipped only on two opposite sides, the other two having been the dorsal and ventral flake surfaces.
The bit has been broken about 13.0 mm. back from the distal tip and there is no way of determining the
shape of the proximal end. Were it not for the distal tip, this specimen would certainly be called a drill.
The unique feature is the square, chisel-like distal tip. This edge shows considerable wear and
rounding as if all pressure was directly on the distal tip with none on the sides which would be the case
for a drill. The maximum width of the bit is 2.9 mm.
Cores

Specimen 80-58 (B-2) is a small (28 mm. by 31 mm.) nearly flat, chert pebble with flakes removed
from a prepared platform. On the end of the core opposite this percussion impact area, one or more
flakes have been discharged, possibly due to rebound force from a rigid anvil. Slight use-polish
appears along the edge where flakes were removed from the prepared platform and may reflect
subsequent utilization as a scraper. This specimen was found near Burial 2 but we cannot be sure of
its association with the grave.
Specimen 80-0 (surface). This is a small (39 mm. by 29 mm.), very irregular remnant of a pebble of
yellowish tan chert which was possibly a bipolar core.
Specimen 80-107 (surface). A flattish, subrectangular chert pebble (approximately 47 mm. by 41
mm. by 17 mm.) with one flake removed from each end on the same side. These two flakes appear to
have been removed by the bipolar technique (direct percussion and rebound) and the pebble was
evidently not used further.
Specimen 80-3. A small (approximately 45 mm. by 20 mm.), very irregular chert pebble core with a
small area of cortex on each side.
Specimen 80-0 (surface). A small (44 mm. by 27 mm. by 13 mm.) flat core of light brown chert.
Flakes have been struck from a ridge on one end and the opposite end shows slight crushing, possibly
from contact with an anvil but it was not possible to definitely determine if this was a bipolar core.
Graver
80-101C (large lunate flake). A graver tip has been worked on one end by unifacial chipping. Small
marginal retouch flake scars appear along the concave edge and a few small modification flakes have
been removed from the convex edge near the graver tip. This is the largest flake from the site and it
was struck from a prepared platform core.
80-17 (possible graver). One end is chipped into a small rounded point and modification flakes
extend along one lateral edge.
Modified initial cortex flake
Specimen 80-68C is an initial cortex flake (approximately 34 mm. by 17 mm. by 4.5 mm.) that has
been modified somewhat to a form possibly intended to be a dart point but was evidently not finished.
The percussion bulb has been trimmed into a point, and shallow notches have been chipped into each
side near the proximal end. The base has also been slightly modified.
Flake scrapers
Three chert flakes have steep marginal retouching along one edge. On two specimens this flaking
is on the end and on one it is on the longest side. One of the end scrapers (80-17) is made on a cortex
flake. Except for the scraping edge, these flakes are otherwise unmodified.
Utilized flakes
Sixteen small (L= 15.6, W= 10, T= 2) to medium (L= 37, W= 16, T= 6) flakes have marginal
retouching along one edge that in most cases appears to be the result of use. All of these have minute
readily visible scars and in some cases have a fine saw-like edge. Some of these were used by Chandler
in a sawing fashion on fresh deer bone and functioned surprisingly well. A groove approximately 3
mm. deep was readily cut around a deer long bone with additional usage flakes discharged along_ the

ABORIGINAL TECHNOLOGY

35

flake working edge in this process. Many of the bone artifacts from this site bear evidence of having
been shaped by sawing, scraping and grinding and it is probable some of these utilized flakes were
used in this manner.
Unmodified flakes
Flake terminology used in this report essentially follows that described by Shafer (1969: 3-5; Fig.
2), although not in quite so much detail. The frequency of flake types is given in Tables 3 and 4; all
specimens were chert unless otherwise noted. The specimens reported from BB-95, Test Pit 2B, and
Squares 2-5 include those recovered on the 1/16 inch mesh screen. While some artifacts described
above have been referred to as bipolar, we confess to a considerable amount of uncertainty about our
ability to recognize bipolar attributes except in the most obvious cases. Consequently, we have not
identified bipolar refuse in the flake material although there were only relatively few instances in
which we felt a flake might possibly represent the technique. Hopefully, a reexamination of this
material by someone familiar with bipolar flaking may provide a more definitive statement about its
presence or absence.
Ground Stone
End notched stone
Specimen number 80-41 (Burial 2) is a fragment of an end notched quartzite stone that has been
pecked and ground to shape (Fig. 13, D). Its method of manufacture and type of end notching resemble
the Type 4 Waco sinker of central Texas, described by Watt (1938). However, this specimen, if
complete, would be exceptionally long. Its present dimensions are L= 57, T--25, W= 36; width of
notched end = 14, thickness -- 10. The notch is broad and shallow and has a depth less than i mm.
This fragment appears to be slightly over one-half the original artifact and, assuming a
symmetrical shape, is estimated to have had a total length of about 96 ram. The broken edge is worn,
which indicates the artifact was used in some manner after having been broken.
Unidentified ground sandstone object
Specimen 80-66C is a small, flat, sandstone fragment which is broken across its long axis. This
fragment appears to be about one-half the length of the original artifact and the broken edge is covered
with a heavy coating of asphalt (Fig. 13, C-C’). While the function of this asphalt is unknown it appears
probable it was applied in an effort to mend the broken pieces together. Dimensions are L--32.5,
W = 40, T-- 16.5. Assuming a symmetrical shape, the estimated original length is 65 ram. Both sides
have broad, shallow (less than one ram.) grooves.
Miscellaneous stone tools

Hammers tone
Specimen number 80-30 (possibly associated with either Burial i or 2) is a quartzite stone with
roughly ovoid outline and flattish sides (Fig. 13, E); length is 59.0 ram., width is 49.0 ram., and thickness
is 26.0 ram. All edges show scars from hammering or pecking, and one end is broken with the heaviest
use scars across the broken edge.
Abraders and grinding stone fragments
Numerous pieces of sandstone and siltstone were collected but only 3 of these appear to have been
utilized.
Specimen 80-93C is a thin, flat, triangular sandstone fragment. One side is slightly concave and
smoother than the other.
80-B14C is a thin, flat, sandstone fragment with broad irregular concave areas on both sides. This
may be a grinding stone fragment or an abrader, but evidence of use is difficult to establish.
80-25C is a thin, flat sandstone fragment with definite abrasion facets. One side has a uniformly
flat, smooth surface which is sharply tapered toward the broken edge. The opposite side is slightly
concave and smooth. The flat tapered area is definitely worn and may have been used as an abrader
or, more probably, a grinding tool.

36

HARRIS COUNTY BOYS SCHOOL

While grinding implements have been rarely mentioned for Texas coastal sites, they are often
present and seem to be miniature versions of the larger mano and metate common to many areas of the
State.

BONE AND ANTLER ARTIFACTS
A total of 139 bone artifacts was recovered, the majority of which are made from the long bones of
a large mammal species (probably deer), of deer antler, a few of bird bone, and a canine tooth of a
carnivore. Most of these artifacts show signs of fairly extensive modification such as chopping,
chipping, whittling, sawing or polishing.
Tubular bone bead
Two small cylindrical sections of limb bone (possibly from a bird) have been sawed and snapped to
form tubular beads (Fig. 14, P). The ends are not smoothed, and there appears to be no attempt at
modification beyond cutting to length. The length of specimen 85-7 is 13.0 mm. and diameter is 5.8 mm.;
specimen 85-43 measured 12.5 ram. in length and 6.0 mm. in diameter. Bone beads have been
previously reported from other Texas coastal sites, but more commonly from the lower coast (e.g.,
Hester 1969).
Compound fishhook barb
One barb portion of a composite fishhook (80-42) was found with Burial 2 (Fig. 8, H). It was made
from a splinter of a large long bone and has been ground smooth. It is nearly triangular in cross section
and one end is beveled for attachment to the hook shank; a heavy asphalt deposit is adhering to this
beveled area.
Compound fishhooks are known from at least four other Texas coastal sites: Cedar Bayou (Ambler
1967), Anaqua (Story 1968), the Galena Park Site, and the Dow-Cleaver Site (Aten 1971); however, the
use of asphalt as an aid to securing the barb to the shank has not been reported previously.

Flageolets
Five tibia fragments of a large wading bird were found with Burial 2, and represent three
flageolets (Fig. 11, A-B). The two nearly complete specimens are each about 19.5 cm. long with a single
stop hole about 12 cm. from one end. None of the Boys School specimens is decorated. The tibia shafts
have been scraped and the ends abraded to thin and shape them. These bones are probably from the
great blue heron (Ardea herodias); however, other possibilities are storks (Ciconiidae) or cranes
(Gruidae) (B. M. Davidson, personal communication)..
Similar artifacts have not been reported from other Texas coastal sites although they have been
reported from sites in the McGee Bend Reservoir area of East Texas (Jelks 1965). These were also
found associated with burials and in each case the flageolet was in or beside one of the hands of the
deceased.
Historic accounts indicate that:
"Over much of the Gulf area, when it was first visited by Europeans, it was customary to
welcome strangers of quality coming in peace by sending men forward, usually including the
chief himself, blowing upon flutes, or rather flageolets." (Swanton 1946: 628).
"Their instruments were nothing but a thick sort of reed or cane, with two openings, one
at the top to blow into and the other end for the wind to come out of, like organ pipes or
whistles." (LeMoyne, cited in Swanton 1946: 628).
In any event it would appear that the use of flageolets was widespread over much of the Gulf
coastal area, particularly to the east of Galveston Bay.
Bone dice
A set of six bone gaming pieces or dice were recovered from under the mandible of Burial 2 (Fig.
11, E-J). This set is made up of three matched pairs which bear designs on one side only. Two pairs (Fig.
11, E-H) are made from thick-walled long bone and are piano-convex in cross section. The other pair
(Fig. 11, I-J) is thinner and more flat and appears to be made from either skull or scapula. The two pairs
made of long bone show traces of red paint on their convex surfaces.
The surfaces of these specimens are well abraded but not highly polished; the incised lines and
crosshatching are neatly executed and were probably made with the thin edge of a flint flake in a
sawing motion. The pits of the third pair are shallowly drilled and it appears that not all were drilled
with the same tool. Previous reports of this type of artifact from other Texas sites are scarce, and it
appears that in some instances they may have been overlooked as gaming pieces because of an
absence of design. For example, rectangular tabular bone, piano-convex in cross section is reported
from the Pecan Springs Site (Sorrow 1966) and there are similar undecorated, tabular, bone artifacts
in the collection excavated from the Galena Park midden near Houston by E. R. Ring (this collection is
now at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin). Aten (1967) reported from the Jamison
Site three small, well-worn rectangular pieces of petrified wood with the edges cut and/or ground,
which, judging from their mutually similar size could also have been dice.
A pair of two incised bone gaming pieces is known from the Corpus Christi area (now on display in
the Corpus Christi Museum) one of which may be the specimen illustrated by Martin (1930). There is
also a set of four matched pairs of bone dice from the Grelle Site (41 BT 1) in central Texas that were
brought to our attention by William R. Sorrow. One pair has incised triangles along lateral edges only,
one pair has one end lightly notched and the other two pairs are undecorated.
Culin (1904) reports that games of chance and of dexterity were found among all the Indian tribes
of North America. Gaming pieces were made of a great variety of material--bone, split cane, wooden
staves, corn, peach and plum stones, beaver and woodchuck teeth, walnut shells, shell, brass, and
pottery disks. With minor exceptions they have two faces, distinguished by color or marking. Score
was usually kept according to which side (plain or decorated) turned up. In some cases the design on
each die indicated a particular number count. The bone dice from the Boys School Cemetery more
closely resemble those Culin reported from various southwestern states (Arizona, New Mexico, Utah)
than those from the southeast.

Incised awls or pins
One complete bone object (80-52) that may be an awl or pin was found with Burial 2 (Fig. 11, D). It
is well polished, has incised lines on one side, and has remnants of red paint remaining in the incising.
Its dimensions are L = 50.4, W = 8.4, and T = 2.7. All of the incising appears to have been made by
sawing. One lateral edge (right side of Fig. 11, D) has a shallow "U" shaped notch 7 mm. from the base.
This does not appear to be an implement for heavy work such as punching holes in hide.
Three other fragments of incised bone were recovered with Burial 1. All three have the same
crosshatched triangle design and may represent only one artifact (Fig. 11, C).
Canine tooth
A single notched lower canine of either a small coyote or medium sized dog was recovered with
Burial 1 and appears to be an ornament (Fig. 8, G).
Perforated canine teeth were found at the Galena Park Site and are also reported by Martin at a
small unnamed site on Copano Bay (Martin n.d.). Both cut and perforated dog teeth were found with a
burial at the Coppell Site (Ford and Quimby 1945).
Bone projectile (?) point
This specimen (85-41) was manufactured from a splinter of a thick-walled mammal bone and is
20.6 ram. long and 8.2 mm. in diameter. It has been whittled and battered to a blunt, faceted distal tip,
is more or less cylindrical, and was grooved around the proximal end and then snapped off the original
splinter.

Three finished socketed bone points are represented. One (85-14) is nearly complete (Fig. 13, AA’), one (85-13) has the distal end broken and one (80-94) is a basal fragment. The shafts have been cut
and ground, the articular end snapped off, and the cancellous tissue of the bone interior reamed out to
create a hollow base for insertion of the shaft. All three have asphalt adhering to the socket.
There is one other artifact (85-13) almost identical to the complete socketed point except the base
is not cut or hollowed out (Fig. 13, B-B’) and the point has only been roughed out by percussion chipping
of the bone. It is interesting to note that all of these socketed bone points found in midden refuse have
damaged bases, and it seems to be this factor more than the condition of the point which determines
whether the tool will be discarded.

Ulna tools
Type I (Fig. 12, E) has a well-formed point which closely resembles tools ethnographically reported
as basketry awls. Three specimens of this type were found at Boys School (none with burials); another
good example is illustrated in Ford and Quimby (1945: Fig. 13, C).
Type II (Fig. 12, A-C) is the more familiar ulna spatulate awl which is supposed to be for flint
knapping, but which does not show the characteristic wear that should result from such use. We have
no real suggestions to make other than that we should not mix them with other types of ulna tools.
Most of the Boys School specimens were associated with graves and they come in all sizes (or
really, all states of wear). Judging from the several abrasion facets present on the tip of each specimen,
one would think they were used for some kind of rubbing or scraping purpose.
The specimen illustrated in Fig. 12, D (80-49, Burial 2) is of unknown type in that it shows limited
wear at the tip which was insufficient to give the artifact the characteristic shape of either two types
described above.
Splinter awls
Eight splintered sections of heavy, long bone shafts with minimal modification were found (Fig. 12,
G-H). All have been sharpened to a point at one end by means of limited grinding, scraping, or
whittling.
Ground bone awls
Only two reasonably complete objects from the cemetery fill may be identified as ground bone
awls. One (80-10C) is short (34 mm. in length, 11 ram. in width and 7 ram. in thickness), is distally ground
from alternate sides to a blunt chisel edge, and the proximal end has been broken and then ground
from one side to form a steep bevel (Fig. 8, K).
The other (80-32C) was greater than 94 ram. long with a maximum width near the base of 14 mm.
and is 6 mm. thick (Fig. 12, F). It was longer originally but the broken condition of the base makes
determination of length impossible.
Ground bone awl fragments
These twenty-five fragments show a finish varying from grinding to a high polish. A few show
chipping or chopping scars under the grinding. Some are distal ends that vary from sharply to bluntly
pointed; others are body fragments of ground or polished bone tools some of which may actually be
fragments of projectile points or some other artifact type. All appear to be made of deer long bone
except for two which are thin, light fragments that appear to be made from bird bone.
Antler projectile points
Two antler tines were recovered adjacent to Burial 2 that have been fashioned into projectile
points. On the complete specimen (80-44) the proximal end has been cut and snapped and its entire
surface has been whittled, scraped and polished (Fig. 8, I). Small slightly angular facets around a
portion of the proximal end indicate it was severed by chopping with a sharp flint (?) tool through the
external compact layer into the spongy interior and then the antler was broken. It is 65 mm. long and
13.3 ram. in maximum diameter at the proximal end and, presumably, was hafted by inserting it into a
socket.
The other specimen (80-48) has the proximal end broken but its original length was in excess of 39
mm. (Fig. 8, L). Its distal end is polished to a fine point and there is a heavy asphalt deposit around the
base with a narrow circumferential groove at the edge of the asphalt evidently made with a flint flake.
It appears evident this point was hafted by inserting, it into a socket with asphalt as a binder (hafted
portion indicated by arrow on Fig. 8, L).
Another short antler tine (85-7) was found at 41 HR 85 which has the proximal end cut by sawing
and the base deeply reamed out (Fig. 8, J-J’). The distal end is ground to a very blunt, rounded point and
could not have functioned as a piercing implement. The length is 38 mm. and the interior hole is 6 mm.
by 8 mm. in dimensions. Two specimens similar in size and form (although fashioned from deer
phalanges) have been recovered from Mayes Island Period refuse in the Trinity River delta (Aten,
unpublished data).

Antler flakers
Two large antler tines (80-35C, 80-59, Burial 2) with evidence of considerable use on their tips
appear to be flaking tools. Their proximal ends are broken and the bases hollowed although this does
not appear to be intentional but is probably due to erosion of the soft internal structure of the antler.
Drumfish teeth and quartz pebbles
Forty drumfish teeth and three small quartz pebbles were found clustered at the left elbow of
Burial 2. While no container for these objects was in evidence, they may have been used as a rattle in
some form of perishable container. The use of drumfish teeth and quartz pebbles in rattles has been
reported for the Eva Site (Lewis and Lewis 1961: 89).
Tool manufacture residue
One basal portion of a deer antler was found which had been cut through the compact external
layer and snapped off the remainder, but is otherwise unmodified. It is probably residue from tool
manufacturing but was found in close proximity to the other artifacts placed with Burial 2.
Also found was a distal metapodial articulation (85-42) from an adult deer that had been cut or
ground through the cortex around the epiphyseal region and then snapped off the shaft of the bone.
This evidently is a step in the manufacture of bone tools such as the socketed bone points. Another
specimen identical to 85-42 was described and illustrated in Aten (1971: 43; Fig. 9).

SHELL ARTIFACTS
A total of 196 shell artifacts was recovered from 41 HR 80; of these, 193 are beads. The remaining
three shell artifacts are a large conch whorl pendant, a modified bonnet shell, and an unidentifiable
artifact fragment made from conch whorl. All of the shell artifacts came from the burial area and most
were in direct association with burials.
Beads
Most of the beads (191) are made of conch columella while one is made from the outer whorl of a
conch and one is a pearl of unidentified type. All of the columella beads, as well as the pearl bead, are
biconically drilled; the single disk-shaped bead has a conical perforation drilled from one side. These
beads are divided into various styles on the basis of their form. Some of these styles tend to grade into
each other and there is some overlap in dimensions; this is especially true of styles F and G (Fig. 14). All
of the columella beads show evidence of having been ground after cutting to length; and, in some cases,
this grinding has produced small facets which are generally more noticeable on the smallest beads. In
all cases the biconical perforations have been made parallel to the long axis of the columella, but in
some of the smaller beads these perforations are not through the greatest dimensions of the bead (i.e.,
some of these have a diameter greater than their length). Portions of the spiral groove of the columella
are retained on most specimens, but on some these appears to have been a deliberate effort made to
remove this groove by grinding. This has resulted in a rather flattish appearance which is most evident
in style D. While all of the beads tend to have their greatest diameter near the midsection, this does not
appear to be by deliberate intent except in the case of styles D and E; these latter are referred to as
barrel shaped.
In styles C and F additional grinding has been done, apparently to reduce the diameter, and this
has removed all traces of the columella groove on 3 style C beads and 17 style F beads. This additional
grinding has also worn into the edges of the drilled longitudinal perforation on some specimens and has
caused the ends of these to be irregular, while on most specimens the cut ends are reasonably straight
and at right angles to the long axis.
Style A: long tubular with thick wall and large diameter.
Only two specimens were recovered (Fig. 14, A-B); these have an average length of 40.3 ram. and
an average diameter of 15.5 mm.
Style B: medium tubular with thick wall and large diameter.

HARRIS COUNTY BOYS SCHOOL

Ten specimens of this style were recovered (Fig. 14, C-D) and these have an average length of 27.6
ram. (st. dev. = 2.9) and an average diameter of 12.7 ram. (st. dev. = 0.9). Of these, 8 beads were found
associated with Burial 3 and all appear to have been drilled with the same tool.
Style C: long tubular with thin wall and small diameter.
Only five specimens of this style were recovered (Fig. 14, E-F); their average length is 34.8 ram. (st.
dev. = 8.2) and their average diameter is 10.1 mm. (st. dev. = 0.4).
Style D: large barrel shape.
Sixteen specimens were found (Fig. 14, G-H); their average length is 17.9 mm. (st. dev. = 1.9) and
their average diameter is 11.6 mm. (st. dev. = 1.1).
Style E: medium barrel shape (grades into spherical form).
Nineteen specimens were found (Fig. 14, I-J); their average length is 8.8 mm. (st. dev. = 1.0) and
their average diameter is 8.7 mm. (st. dev. = 0.7).
Style F: small barrel shape (grades into spherical form).
Some 103 specimens of this style were recovered (Fig. 14, K-L); they have an average length of 5.5
mm. (st. dev. = 1.0) and an average diameter of 5.5 ram. (st. dev. = 0.5). The single pearl bead recovered
was of this form.
Style G: short tubular with thin wall and small diameter.
Thirty-six specimens of this style were recovered (Fig. 14, M-N); they have an average length of
10.2 ram. (st. dev. = 2.1) and an average diameter of 5.3 ram. (st. dev. = 0.4). Of these, 35 are from a
single burial (Burial 30) and all appear to have been drilled with the same drilling tool.
Style H: disk shape.
Only one specimen of this style was recovered (Fig. 14, 0-0’); it has a length of 9.0 mm. and a width
of 16.5 mm.

Tubular, barre! shaped, and spherical columella beads are bead styles that seem to be confined
primarily to the upper Texas coast and eastward (and to contiguous inland areas) as opposed to the
lower coast and south Texas. Bead styles in the latter area tend to run to shell disk and tubular bone
forms (Hester 1969) as well as to a variety of other shell and bone artifact types generally not
encountered on the upper coast.
Because of prehistoric disturbance of graves in the cemetery area, many columella beads were
found scattered about in the fill. In some cases, though, associations were evident. Burial 2 had beads
around the right wrist either strung together or attached to a garment. The beads with Burial 3 appear
to have been strung together and may originally have been suspended around the neck although this is
uncertain because of post-interment disturbance of the body. The beads with Burial 13 were in fill in
the chest area but their relation to the body is indeterminate. In Burial 21, a sizeable concentration of
beads occurred near the right tibia but evidently were not worn. Finally, the large number of beads
from Burial 30 were clearly worn about the neck strung probably in two strands in the sequence of
three to four Style F beads and then one Style G bead.
Conch shell beads associated with burials are known from several sites in the Galveston Bay
area and from at least one site in the Sabine Lake area. Simmons (1903) reported tubular conch beads
from the burials at the site at the mouth of Clear Creek, on the western edge of Galveston Bay, but these
specimens are not available for study. Numerous tubular columella beads were recovered at the
Caplen Site (Campbell 1957) along with many shell disk beads and Oliva shell beads (none of which were
found at the Boys School Site). As a group, the tubular beads from Caplen are much larger and heavier
than those from Boys School. This is also true of the several beads recovered from a destroyed burial
at a site on the Edgar Brown Estate in Orange County (Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
collections).
The scarcity of shell artifacts along the Texas coast is probably partly due to a lack of excavation
and reporting; however, the use of shell as a medium of exchange may be another factor. Swanton
(1946: 481,542)speaks of this trade:
"The ancient bead of the interior Indians of the South is said by Adair (1775) to have
been made out of the conch shell, and it was shaped by rubbing on a hard stone. They varied
in size and characteristics. One reason for the profuse use of beads as ornaments was the
fact that they also constituted a medium of exchange and could be made useful in that
capacity at a minutes notice besides furnishing visible witness to the standing and credit of
the wearer."
Shell pendant
Specimen 80-62 (Fig. 15, A-A’) is a large, decorated shell pendant made from the outer whorl of a
conch (probably Busycon perversum) and was found with Burial 4. The pendant is roughly triangular
in outline and its maximum dimensions are 144 ram. in length and 95 ram. in width. It has a single
suspension hole drilled at the small end. This hole is conical and was drilled from the interior (concave
side). Viewed from the concave side the entire perimeter has a series of fairly evenly spaced incised
notches although this notched perimeter is badly eroded around the base. The concave surface is
decorated with a series of shallowly drilled pits arranged in two roughly parallel lines along the long
axis of the pendant and near the mid-line. These pits start at the base and extend upward about two
thirds (98 ram.) the artifact’s length to intersect another double row of similar pits across the short
axis. A cluster of shallow pits without pattern is located to the left of the vertical rows of pits and
below the horizontal rows of pits. Below the cluster of pits without pattern is another double row of
pits running from the left lateral edge to intersect the two vertical rows about 45 ram. from the base of
the artifact. There is a single row of similar pits along the lateral edges from the suspension hole to the
double row of pits across the short axis. A total of 138 drilled pits are visible on this specimen.
On the reverse (convex) side there is an eroded pattern that appears to cover about one-half or
more of the surface (Fig. 15, A’). Viewed under the microscope, we can see no tool marks to indicate
that this pattern was engraved on the shell. Rather, the depressions have more the appearance of

having been etched. The pattern itself clearly resembles a textile pattern of widely spaced elements
that is similar to the twined weave openwork illustrated by Mason (1904: Plate 130, lower) taken from
a textile-impressed sherd recovered from somewhere in the eastern United States. The Boys School
specimen appears to have been a flexible textile, most likely a wallet or pouch, which either was
placed in the grave of Burial 4 or was worn in the pelvic area and either contained the she!l pendant or
was resting on the pendant so that the shell in contact with the plant fibers was dissolved resulting in
an etching of the textile pattern on the exterior surface of the shell.
In the shell midden at the Galena Park Site, a conch whorl pendant was found that was very
similar (except for its smaller size) to the one reported here. Also, a circular conch whorl pendant was
reported from the Caplen Site (Campbel! 1957) which, although different in shape, had a design on the
interior composed of shallow drilled pits.
Another small, rectangular fragment of conch whorl from the cemetery fill has one cut and ground
edge and may be a fragment of a pendant or gorget.
Modified Scotch Bonnet shell
One modified Scotch Bonnet shell (Phalium granulatium) (Fig. 15, B) containing 12 hackberry seeds
was found in the vicinity of Burial 16 but this area is so disturbed we cannot be sure of any association
with the burial. The shell has been ground along the inner lip, around the umbilicum, and on to the edge
of the outer lip. The specimen does not appear to have had any utilitarian use.

DISCUSSION OF TECHNOLOGICAL HISTORY~
As was discussed earlier, bluff-top middens such as those at Harris County Boys School present
difficulties for stratigraphic interpretation which result from their relatively low rate of accumulation
per unit of time. Consequently, discrimination of individual deposition episodes or even of the
combined refuse from general periods of occupation is difficult. To construct a refined chronological
framework from such data would be a very time consuming task. Fortunately, however, a
chronological framework is under development which is based primarily on the more clear artifact
stratigraphy of sites tested in the Trinity River delta. Thus, we are able to relate the Boys School data
to a chronology that, for ceramic using periods at least, is based on more detailed information than is
available from Boys School. A summary of the chronological periods as needed for this present
analysis is given in Figure 16. More details on the chronological relationships of the upper Texas coast
may be found in Aten (1971). At this point we must identify key artifact groups by the stratigraphic
Analysis Units previously derived in Section I, identify the cultural assemblages that each Analysis
Unit represents, and then relate these Analysis Units to the local chronology as given in Figure 16. This
will be followed by a general commentary on the major technologies represented at Boys School.
In Table 5 are shown the most important artifact classes (from the viewpoint of chronology) by
Analysis Unit. For this purpose we have excluded artifacts from the cemetery fill and from Area B of
41 HR 85; the former because of disturbance by aboriginal grave digging, and the latter because we
are unsure of its correlation with the shell midden Analysis Units, although this is probably with Units
2, 3, and/or 4. Table 5 (Major artifact categories by Analysis Unit) largely groups the non-ceramic
specimen categories together on a basis that usually presumes some chronological significance. The
"Arrow points" category groups together all stem forms and fragments. Although expanding and
contracting stem form changes as documented for the Toyah and Austin Foci [Jelks 1962) are known
from the coast, both stem forms do appear to have been present from the first appearance of the
arrow, changing only in their proportions (cf., Aten 1967: Fig. 6a). In any event, because there are so
few specimens the principal data to be derived here concerns presence or absence of the arrow
technology.
The "Dart points" category is subdivided into "fragments", "contracting stem", and "straight
stem" (expanded stem forms did not occur at Boys School). This is because of the greater
representation of dart points in our data, and because of the demonstrated chronological potential of
their stem forms (Aten 1967: Fig. 6a; Johnson 1962: 268-280). The category "Miscellaneous Lithic
Tools" is primarily to show the distribution of bifaces (other than the projectile points) and of unifaces.
These tools have not yet been shown to have chronological significance on the coast. The categories
"Bone Points" (all but two are socketed) and "Miscellaneous Bone Tools" (usually awls) have likewise
not previously been shown to have chronological significance; however, we have a growing suspicion
that, as shown on Table 5, they are confined to the relatively later periods. "Lithic Materials" includes
all chipped stone artifacts as well as flakes and is subdivided into the three basic mineral and rock
type categories of chert, quartzite, and silicified wood. These have been demonstrated to have
important chronological significance in this area (Aten 1967: Fig. 6b). Virtually all other artifact
categories from this site were associated with burials as grave goods.
Analysis Unit 1: Principally significant here is the fact that only arrow points and Goose Creek
Plain pottery are present. In the Galveston Bay area, the earliest known points from a dated context
come from Wallisville Reservoir and date about A.D. 500 (Aten, unpublished data). Since, in this area,
no arrow points are known from any Clear Lake Period context that was not readily susceptible to
mixing with later materials (as at 41 HR 80 and 85), it seems fairly secure at this point to infer the
introduction of arrow points to have occurred sometime between A.D. 350 and A.D. 500 (radiocarbon
years). At the same time, the absence of any pottery type other than Goose Creek Plain is significant
and, coming subsequent to Tchefuncte and related ceramics, is indicative of what is known as the
Mayes Island Period (Aten, unpublished data). Although the Goose Creek Incised and Red-filmed types
have also been found in Mayes Island contexts, these are rare occurrences. Consequently,
assignments of Analysis Unit i to the Mayes Island Period seems appropriate.

DISCUSSION OF TECHNOLOGICAL HISTOR Y

51

Analysis Unit 2: The relative abundance of arrow points in relation to a small proportion of
Tchefuncte Plain suggests Analysis Unit 2 consists of mixed refuse from the Mayes Island Period and
the earlier Clear Lake Period.
Analysis Unit 3: The occurrence of one arrow point in this and each of the next two levels cannot
be taken too seriously until and unless this association is documented in a much better physical context
than we have here at Boys School. Evidence that specimens have moved downward in the site may also
be seen in the occurrence of six Goose Creek Plain sherds in Analysis Units 9-12. Although rodents do
not ordinarily burrow in these shell middens (at least not until the recent advent of the South American
nutria, Myocastor coypus), the clays that are a principal ingredient of the sediment matrix in the
midden have such a high coefficient of expansion that during dry periods, deep cracks open as the
ground becomes dessicated. In middens, the presence of much clam and oyster shell tends to inhibit the
formation of such dessication cracks (by making the midden "soil" less homogeneous); nevertheless,
they do occur and debris (including artifacts) does fall in them. In any event, of greater significance in
this Analysis Unit is the preponderance of dart points and of Tchefuncte and Mandeville ceramics.
This unit is therefore correlated with the Clear Lake Period.
Analysis Unit 4: Although the quantity of ceramics is substantially reduced over that in Analysis
Unit 3, the proportions are still appropriate for the Clear Lake Period. This Analysis Unit may include
both Clear Lake Period and preceramic refuse but we have no way to determine the presence of the
latter.
Analysis Units 5-12: Although 12 sherds were recovered from Analysis Unit 5 this is probably
insignificant, in consideration of the type of refuse stratification at these sites. Analysis Unit 5 is
probably the latest fully preceramic zone we are able to recognize at Boys School and is preceded by a
long sequence of deposition within which there are a number of significant developments, some having
been previously discussed in Section I. From a technological standpoint it is significant to note the
preponderance of straight stemmed dart points, the absence of the use of quartzite until late in
preceramic times (both of which features were previously documented at the Jamison Site; Aten 1971),
and the absence of bone tools until late in the preceramic period. However, because of a lack of
absolute dating of the coastal preceramic we are unable to precisely correlate these preceramic
Analysis Units with an absolute chronology. A general review of the relevant geological literature
indicates that coastal habitats reached the present location of the coastal zone somewhere around
3600-4000 radiocarbon years ago. Consequently, shell middens predating this period are not likely to
be found presently exposed in the Galveston Bay area. Older sites may exist, although these would
reflect an inland or non-littoral habitat adaptation. We do, of course, have the single corrected age
determination on Tx-969 of about 3400 radiocarbon years ago which is shown on Figure 16 as
associated with Analysis Unit 9. The preceding and succeeding analysis units are shown on Figure 16
in a generalized fashion.
Based on this chronological interpretation of the analysis units we may conclude that the bulk
(chronologically and volumetrically) of habitation at this site was preceramic in age. This habitation
activity continued at least through the Clear Lake Period and regular reuse of the site for habitation
apparently ended somewhere around A.D. 600. Ceramics indicative of later periods are exceedingly
rare. Use of the site as a cemetery appears to have postdated the termination of the site’s use as a
habitation area. The age of the cemetery will be more thoroughly discussed in Section Ill.
Now, looking more closely at specific artifact classes, we may offer some concluding observations.
With respect to the ceramics, these were fairly easy to interpret from a typological standpoint. Of
particular interest was the variety of Tchefuncte ceramic complex attributes relative to those
recorded elsewhere on the Texas coast. Ordinarily, the only evidence recovered in any given site has
been Tchefuncte and/or Mandeville plainware although at 41 JF 31, Tchefuncte Plain occurred along
with a noded rim pottery similar to the Alexander series (Charles N. Bollich and L.E. Aten,
unpublished data). At Boys School, however, we have Mandeville and Tchefuncte Plain, and
Tchefuncte Stamped. In addition, there were other typically associated types and attributes such as

52

HARRIS COUNTY BOYS SCHOOL

Goose Creek Stamped, Conway Plain, and thick, poorly wedged Goose Creek Plain. It is not necessarily
of significance that such exotica as Goose Creek Stamped and Tchefuncte Stamped were only
recovered from the cemetery when one considers that 2.5 times as much area was excavated in the
cemetery relative to non-cemetery parts of the site. Consequently, we should not leap to a conclusions
of association between these ceramic types and the graves. Such an association cannot be absolutely
ruled out, but given the present data, would be difficult to demonstrate.
A number of additional general observations may be made about the lithic technology. Chipped
stone assemblages from Texas coastal sites (particularly the shell middens) have never attracted much
attention primarily, we suppose, because other than in Orcoquisac Period sites chipped stone
specimens of any kind are present in exceedingly low densities and are not the useful chronological
indicators they have become in central Texas, for example. However, since we have begun using 1/16
inch mesh screen in conjunction with the customary larger screens, we have obtained significantly
larger samples of chipping debris, and these have proved informative. From an evolutionary
standpoint, the dart point sequence shifting from straight to contracting stem form (Table 5) is
consistent with published data from numerous other sites in the area (e.g., Aten 1967; Johnson 1962)
although the functional significance of this style change is unknown at this time. The Plainview point
recovered from one of the shovel tests near 41 HR 85 may represent a very early occupation at the site
but no further evidence of this possibility was ever discovered during our work. Of particular interest
is the distribution of lithic materials (i.e., primarily chipping debris) as shown on Table 5. The pattern
of change in use of quartzite in relation to chert and silicified wood is distinctly similar to that
documented at the Jamison Site (Aten 1967). Although we prefer to await description of lithic material
from the Wallisville Reservoir before developing any major conclusions, it seems fairly obvious that
the appearance of quartzite, in addition to being a useful chronological indicator, must also be a clue to
either the development of new raw material sources or exchange relationships, or both. The lithic
assemblage reveals a number of other significant features about technology. One is the absence of any
large and/or heavy stone implements of any sort, an unremarkable situation when one considers the
distance to the nearest inland gravel sources (in excess of 50 miles), but remarkable in view of the
extreme and universal degree of shattering of the heavy long bones of large mammals at these sites.
This circumstance will be discussed further in reference to the bone tool technology. Another
important feature concerns the abundance (nearly 20%) of bifaces reworked from other biface tools
indicating some incentive for the conservation of materials.
Yet another feature concerns the nature of the chipping debris. As can be seen from Tables 3, 4,
and 5B, initial cortex flakes are rare and secondary cortex flakes are not really abundant either. Most
flakes recovered are one or another of the interior types and they represent a considerable variety of
source material; i.e., it is evident that the bulk of flakes from any given excavation unit did not result
from the reduction of a single cobble or preform but rather from treatment of a considerable number
of different stone materials. The frequency distribution of these flake types is given in Table 5B and a
number of distributional peculiarities are readily obvious by inspection.
1. There is an increase in flake density subsequent to AU 8 and a decrease subsequent to AU 3.
2. No particular change is obvious in the frequency of initial cortex flakes.
3. A general increase in proportion of secondary cortex flakes occurs subsequent to AU 7 (the
100% for AU 1 is not considered to be based on a significant sample and is disregarded in this
discussion).
4. There may be a general increase in proportion of single faceted interior flakes subsequent to
AU 7.
5. There is a significant decline in proportion of multiple faceted interior flakes subsequent to AU
7 and again subsequent to AU 3.
6. There may be a significant increase in proportion of "other" interior flakes subsequent to AU
3. The "other" category primarily includes flakes with ridges or peaked striking platforms and may
represent the bipolar technique.
7. There is a marked increase in the occurrence of flake fragments beginning with AU 2.

DISCUSSION OF TECHNOLOGICAL HISTORY"

53

In suggesting the significance of these seven features of chipping debris distribution, we should
also bear in mind several previously mentioned facts:
1. The first major appearance of arrow points is in AU 2.
2. That the principal occurrence of quartzite artifacts is in AU 3 through 6.
3. That a shift in the season during which the site was inhabited (from late summer back to late
spring) occurred beginning in AU 7.
It thus appears that the first major chipped stone technology at the site was one focused on the
production of large (i.e., dart point size) bifaces from preforms with most of the cortex previously
removed. These bifaces presumably were made with a relatively "refined" edge as indicated by the
preponderance of multiple faceted interior flakes. At about the time of Analysis Unit 7, when the
season of occupation changed and use of quartzite is first evident (all of which indicate some manner
of reorientation of the local cultural system or systems) the technology also shifted to one in which
somewhat less well-trimmed preforms were finished to a less refined state than previously (as
suggested by an increase in single facet over multiple facet flakes, and by the increase in secondary
cortex flakes).
Technological changes necessary for production of the arrow point are evidently reflected in
Analysis Unit 2. The marked decline in multiple faceted interior flakes and increase in "other"
(possibly bipolar) interior flakes may mark the introduction of the bipolar technique on the coast as a
specialized process for production of arrow points (from small preforms?). This interpretation is
supported by the sharp proportional increase in flake fragments; as a by-product of the bipolartechnique these would be expected in greater quantity than from other techniques. Possible
subsistence shift concomitants of these lithic technology changes are currently under study and will be
reported elsewhere. A sharp decline in density of debris may be reflective of a reduced intensity of
occupation, or perhaps there are other unknown reasons.
Bone artifacts at the Boys School sites occurred entirely within Analysis Units 1-5 (to some portion
of which the cemetery fill must be assigned) and as grave goods associated with burials. The bone
artifacts may be broadly grouped as tools and as non-tools. The tool group occurs both in habitation
refuse and as a grave accompaniment; the non-tool group (such as flageolets and gaming pieces) except
for two bone beads from 41 HR 85, occurs entirely as grave accompaniments (and most of these with
Burial 2). Although bone tools such as fishhooks and various types of awls continued to be
manufactured until historic times, it appears as if the socketed bone point may principally be a feature
of the late preceramic and early ceramic periods on the upper Texas coast (see Aten 1971:50-51 for
discussion). This, of course, is not the case farther east in Louisiana where socketed bone points are in
use until quite late. All specimens from Boys School were made from deer metapodials, although
elsewhere in the area socketed points are known to have been made from antler and deer phalanges
(Aten, unpublished data). The system of manufacture of the Boys School specimens is relatively clear.
The metapodial articulation (usually the distal articulation) was grooved around the epiphyseal region,
presumably with a chipped stone tool or flake, and then snapped off the shaft. The end to be worked to
a point was evidently roughly shaped by percussion (cf. Figure 13 A, B). This irregularly pointed piece
was then evidently ground to a more or less smooth and symmetrical form. Then the cancellous bone
inside the proximal end was ground out, and the finished point hafted using asphalt as cement. Just
how the percussion-like initial reduction was performed is unclear inasmuch as no choppers or
hammerstones of sufficient size or weight to perform this task were found. This is remarkable in view
of the fact that thousands of small fragments or chips of large deer-sized mammal long bone were
recovered (of which about 10% had been scraped or abraded) although no such whole long bones were
found.
The shell artifacts were entirely associated with the cemetery and the technological features of
these specimens were covered previously in their descriptions.

III. DESCRIPTION OF BOYS SCHOOL
AND OTHER GALVESTON BAY
AREA MORTUARY DATA
BY LAWRENCE E. ATEN

At least four cemeteries (i.e., those spatially limited areas in which human interments were
repeatedly made as a result of choice rather than chance}, all of which are located in the Galveston
Bay area, are presently known from the archeological literature for the coastal zone of upper Texas.
Although others undoubtedly exist, those which are presently known are: the Caplen Site, located on
Bolivar Peninsula; the lamaica Beach Site, located on Galveston Island; an unnamed and now
destroyed site located at the mouth of Clear Creek; and the Harris County Boys School Site (Fig. 1}. The
"mouth of Clear Creek" site, however, was destroyed by 1896 (Simmons 1903) and never professionally
investigated. We simply note, for distributional purposes, that a site formerly existed at the mouth of
Clear Creek which apparently contained a large number of burials emplaced in a shell midden. In
addition to these known cemetery localities, numerous other isolated grave occurrences are known.
Because of the implications these isolated interments appear to have for the historical development of
mortuary practices in the Galveston Bay area, relatively well-documented examples from the Addicks
and Wallisville reservoirs will also be described in this section.
BURIAL DOCUMENTATION
There has been re-examination and intensification of interest in recent years in recovery of data
bearing on cultural and sociological inferences from archeological cemeteries (e.g., Brown 1971;
Cruber 1971; Sprague 1968) as well as on demography. Since the possible range of formal variations in
grave composition and organization is relatively limited, it is surprising that rigorous criteria for grave
description are not yet in general use. With a view towards elimination of equivocal and ambiguous
forms of documentation, Sprague’s 1968 paper provides a thoughtful evaluation of terminology and
attribute classification, and was extensively drawn upon in preparing the burial attribute outline
given in Table 6. For argumentation supporting the use of these attributes and for illustrations of the
debilitating effect upon analysis of incomplete and/or ambiguous terminology as commonly encountered in burial description, see Sprague {1968).
Generally, the attributes of burials analyzed in this report, along with estimated age and sex of the
individuals interred, are recorded in Tables 7 through 10; however, those attributes which did not vary
much are recorded instead in the text to follow. In all cases, attribute categories not occurring at a site
were excluded from the appropriate table. Presentation of data on grave goods is supplemented,
where possible, by line drawings (Figures 17, 18, and 22). In transposing age data reported by others, it
was found that such general terms as "adolescent," "juvenile", and "child" were sometimes used in
an incomparable manner. The following convention was adopted for use in this report (and for Tables
7 through 10}:
Infant
= 0 to approximately 2 years
Juvenile
= about 2 to 10 years
Adolescent = about 10 to 20 years
= 20 or more years
Adult
Written documentation according to the attribute outline given in Table 6 was completed for all
Boys School burials prior to their removal from the ground. The attribute documentation for all other
cemeteries and isolated burials was taken from field notes, photographs, and published reports. In
Tables 7 through 10, an "x" indicates attribute state occurrence; a "-" indicates indeterminance. If no
state is shown as occurring for any given attribute, this signifies indeterminance due either to physical
disturbance of the grave or to the absence of documentation where field notes were the only source of
information.

Statistical tests (generally chi-square and Student’s t) were occasionally used to aid in determining if burial attributes were evenly distributed over the various age and sex groups in each
cemetery, the null hypothesis in each case being that of no difference in distribution. The computations
made are not given here; these are straightforward and can readily be checked with the data given in
Tables 7 through 9. Because of generally small sample sizes, only in a few cases has it been possible to
demonstrate differences in attribute distribution over age and sex categories. However, for the
remainder, we do not conclude that attributes were evenly distributed for to do so would affirm the
consequent. On the contrary, the conclusion is that given the available data, it has not been possible to
demonstrate differences--a conclusion that should not be confused with that of no differences.

HARRIS COUNTY BOYS SCHOOL CEMETERY
Excavation procedures at Boys School have been described previously in Chapter I; in this section
description of various features of the cemetery will be presented.
Cemetery Limits

Although it was not possible to determine precisely the limits of the Boys School Cemetery due to
shortage of field time, it seems likely that we were successful in making a general approximation of
these limits. All graves were encountered in the south end of 41 HR 80 in shell midden refuse. By
referring to Figure 2 it can be seen that the cemetery excavation was closely bounded on the south and
east by the limit of midden refuse, on the north by stratigraphic tests in which no skeletal material was
encountered, and on the west by the eroded slope of the midden and the bluff overlooking Mud Lake
where, similarly, no skeletal material was observed eroding from the midden. Moreover, no skeletal
remains were seen by us, or were ever reported to have been found in the damaged northern end of 41
HR 8O.
In Figure 17, it can be seen that areas began to occur around the north and northeast sides of the
excavation in which no burials were encountered. The most probable direction for additional burials
to be encountered then, would be southwest of our excavation, although the occurrence of several
depressions in that area which looked suspiciously like farm animal graves suggests that further
excavation would probably not add significantly to our present information. Since no testing was done
beyond the limits of the shell midden (except for the several shovel tests dug around the midden
periphery) we cannot be absolutely sure that burials were not placed beyond the midden. The facts
are, however, that none have ever been encountered in any of our shovel tests around 41 HR 80, nor
upstream along the gully dividing 41 HR 80 from 41 HR 85, nor in a small borrow pit (for sand fill)
located about 50 meters east of 41 HR 80, nor more recently when construction activities lowered the
ground level by as much as a meter over several acres extending northeast from 41 HR 85. In addition,
the apparent termination of graves in our excavation where it neared the edge of the shell midden
strongly suggests the graves were confined to a restricted portion of the midden. With these limitations
to burial occurrence, it seems likely that our excavations have revealed most of the graves existing at
41 HR 80. Unfortunately, we cannot be certain of the exact proportion.
Cemetery Age

The previously mentioned radiocarbon dates (assays made on Burials 1 and 2) are informative
only to the extent that they focus on some portion of the first millenium A.D.
The fact that the skeletons are very shallowly buried (27 burials, out of a total of 29 that were in
situ, or 93%, were not deeper than 30 cm. below ground surface) strongly indicates that they were
placed in graves excavated from the present ground surface, and therefore post-date the latest maior
midden refuse deposits recognized in the cemetery portion of the site; i.e., probably post-date the early
part of the Turtle Bay Period which began circa A.D. 600 (radiocarbon years) (Fig. 16). There were no
European artifacts (other than modern trash) found with the burials (or anywhere else in the site) so
the cemetery is not likely to be as late as the historic period. The fact that there was virtually no grog-

56

HARRIS COUNTY BOYS SCHOOL

tempered pottery found in either 41 HR 80, 85, or 86 (Tables 3 and 4) suggests the immediate Boys
School area was scarcely used at all in the post-Turtle Bay ceramic periods, although early Round
Lake Period refuse is evident at 41 HR 82 (O’Brien 1971: Table 2), located about 1/2 mile north of the
cemetery. It is difficult to believe that significant use of the Boys School cemetery could have continued
into the Round Lake Period without somewhat larger quantities of grog-tempered pottery having been
left in nearby sites thereby representing intermittent habitation at the very least.

Although no extensive Turtle Bay Period occupation refuse has yet been recognized in the Boys
School sites or in the immediate surrounding area, the small amount of Turtle Bay occupational refuse
revealed in Test Pits U and V-99 may represent short-term occupation deposited by persons engaged in
burying.’

’It should be noted that several sites were located along the nearby north shore of Clear Lake some years ago by the late
Wayne B. Neyland. Waterfront development in the past fifteen years has evidently resulted in the destruction of virtually all these
sites, but some of Neyland’s sherd collections are stored at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin. These should
be studied to identify periods of occupation prior to interpreting diachronic irregularities in Clear Lake area settlement patterns.

57

DESCRIPTION OF MORTUARY DATA

Stratigraphic evidence, therefore, seems to preclude an initial cemetery usage significantly
earlier than the Turtle Bay Period since the graves appear to have been dug into refuse of at least
Clear Lake and perhaps Mayes Island Period age. On the basis of this rather circumstantial evidence
then, and upon the presently unverified but plausible assumption that corpses would not be
transported any great distance for burial (thereby resulting in some contemporaneous habitation
refuse in proximity to the cemetery) the best estimate we can now deduce is that the cemetery
primarily dates to some portion of the Turtle Bay Period, or from roughly A.D. 600 to A.D. 950
(radiocarbon years).
Cemetery Plan
The overall distribution of burials is presented in Figure 17 and a more detailed presentation of
the principal grave good occurrences is given in Figure 18. On Figure 17 an outline has been dashed
around each of the burials; these are not grave pit outlines based on field data, for such pits were
virtually never in evidence owing to the homogeneity of midden and grave fill. The main function of
these outlines is to illustrate the frequent intersections of graves as evidenced by disruption of
skeletons.
No consistent spatial or stratigraphic differentiation of grave placement based upon the age or
sex of the individuals buried therein is evident (compare Fig. 17 and Table 7). The repetitious
occurrence of intersecting graves, moreover, implies that actual (as opposed to putative) isolability of
the grave was of no significant general concern in the local system of mortuary practices. This absence
of concern may very well have been manifested through the intermediate effect of interment at such
infrequent time intervals that precise knowledge, markings, or evidence of prior grave locations were
lost, but the result is the same. We may conclude that, conditional upon the efficacy of our sample, if
any role or rank distinctions were recognized in life in the culture and society (or societies) interring at
Boys School, such distinctions were not recognized in death in the overall internal configuration of the
cemetery. It would appear that the principal factor was burial at a specified place (i.e., the cemetery)
rather than where burial would be within that place (cemetery). Whether in future investigations a
contrast will develop between those individuals contemporaneously buried within a cemetery place
versus those not so buried remains to be seen although the demographic analysis to be presented
shortly indicates this may be something of a possibility. Practical necessity would seem to preclude
rigid adherence to any such distinction though, unless cemeteries ultimately prove to be considerably
more widely distributed than now appears the case.
Burial Attributes
For burials excavated by Gramley, prior to our work at the site, attributes had to be determined
from burial sketches since no field photography or written descriptions were available for any of those
interments or associated grave goods. Fortunately, these sketches (for Burials 1-8, and 10) are quite
detailed and are much of the basis for Figure 18 and a portion of Figure 17. Several individuals listed
on Table 7 are not shown on the burial plan (Fig. 17). These are usually indicated by a subscript a or b
after the burial number and occur because, occasionally, bones of individuals clearly not part of the
principal individual in a grave were recognized by the physical anthropologists in the laboratory. For
such individuals, whose condition results from the extensive prehistoric disturbance of graves, we
have no positional data. They were used in determining age and sex composition of the cemetery,
except in certain obvious cases where stray anatomical elements belonged to an individual who could
reasonably be determined (such as Burial 26 probably being the skull for Burial 3, and Burial 8
probably being the skull for Burial 20).
Form of disposal: all burials were primary inhumations except numbers la, 7, 9, 17a, 22a,
22b, and 34 which were indeterminate, and Burial 25 (Figs. 17 and 20A) which may have been a
secondary bundle burial but which more likely was a burial disturbed and piled together during

excavation of the grave for Burial 15. Such a disturbed condition is also illustrated in the extreme case
of Burial 9 which was a relatively discrete pile of completely disarticulated and often fragmented bone
(Fig. 19A). The disturbed Burial 23 is unique as to form of disposal. Although evidently a primary
interment of an infant (possibly newborn), the body appears to have been placed inside a ceramic
vessel and then buried. A recently excavated trash pit or farm animal grave apparently truncated the
vessel (and skeleton), and the remaining part of the skull and several other bones are resting on the
inside of a large segment of a Goose Creek Plain vessel (Fig. 21). This is the only know occurrence of
such a burial container from the upper coast.
Individuality: all graves contained single individuals except Burials la, 7, 17, 17a, 22a, 22b and
34 which were indeterminate.
Articulation: all burials were articulated except numbers la, 7, 8, 9, 17, 17a, 22a, 22b, 23, and 34
which were indeterminate, and Burial 25 which was disarticulated (as previously noted, this appears
to have occurred accidentally during interment of Burial 15). Most burials were also disturbed
prehistorically by later interments (cf. Figs. 19A, 20A) and seven have additionally suffered some
modern disturbance (Fig. 21).

Position: all burials were flexed except numbers la, 3, 5, 7, 9, 17, 17a, 18, 22a, 22b, 23, 24, 25, 30,
and 34 which were indeterminate and Burial 33 which was semi~flexed (Fig. 17).
The various arm positions documented were "along sides", 29%; "hands to face", 29%; "crossed
on chest or pelvis", 29%; "mixed, side and crossed", 5%; and "mixed, face and crossed", 5%. The frequencies observed are too low to permit use of a chi-square test for whether or not the various kinds of
arm position are evenly distributed by age groups and/or sex. Similarly, frequencies are too low to
make any test for differentiation of head rotation. The percentages of occurrence are "to right", 29%
and "none", 71%.
Deposition: The forms of depositing the corpse in the grave were "on back", 28%; "on chest",
11%; "on right side", 39%; and "on left side", 22%. No significant results were obtained when using
the chi-square technique to test for differentiation of deposition forms by age or sex.
Orientation: When studying data on skeleton orientation, differentiation can be made in patterns
of burial bearings and patterns of head directions. Since any potential rules for orienting a body along
some astronomical or other axis still leave room for choice about which direction the head will point,
head direction was tabulated according to whether or not it was pointing to the eastern or western
hemisphere of the compass. This selection for analysis (as opposed to the northern and southern
hemispheres) was made in consideration of the preponderant east-west orientation of burials at Boys
School and from the other sites to be considered as well. The average bearing of burials at Boys School
(irrespective of age, sex or head direction) was 85.9° with a standard deviation of 44.6°. Mean
bearings were also tabulated for males and females in each hemisphere and the significance of the
differences between these were tested with a t-test for difference of means. The results, however,
were insignificant and no bearing differentiation based on sex can be suggested at this time. When
bearings were tabulated by age groups, however, the mean bearing for east pointing adults was 68.8°
(st. dev. = 41.2°), and mean bearing for west pointing adults was 103.8° (st. dev. = 15.2°). Testing for
a significant difference between these means, a "t" significant between the .05 and .10 levels of
probability was obtained. The same result, however, was achieved when contrasting the east group as
a whole versus the west group as a whole, so we cannot yet say that there is actually an age group
difference. The mean bearing for all east pointing burials was 74.2° (st. dev. = 44.8°); mean bearing
for all west pointing burials was 114.8° (st. dev. = 30.3°).
We may tentatively suggest differentiation of burial bearing (the west group’s mean bearing is
more southerly than the east group’s bearing) based on whether the individual was pointed to the east
or to the west. The percentage of burials with heads pointing towards the east was 71% and toward
the west was 29%. It is possible there may be a social explanation for this difference or there may be
an element of seasonality and season-specific orientation operating here if we speculate that these
orientations are related to solar positions on the horizon. No significant results were obtained when
testing with chi-square for differentiation of head direction by age or sex.
Grave goods: As was indicated previously, discrimination of grave goods from other specimens at
times involved subjective judgments. The relationships of grave goods to the respective burials are
illustrated in Figure 17 and 18; all specimens have been described, illustrated, and noted as to
provenience. Additionally, red ochre and the brackish water mussel Modiolus demissus granosissimus
Sowerby (Andrews 1971:156)were materials introduced into the grave at the time of burial, and are
here considered to be grave goods.
Grave goods were present in 12 burials out of the 29 that were documented in the field.
Numerically more of these 12 burials are adult males than any other age or sex group and it also may
be significant that all three infant burials recognized in the field contained grave goods of some sort.
Realistically, though, our data do not yet make any strong cases for inferring differential distribution
of grave goods, as a whole, between age or sex classes in this cemetery.
The specific grave goods items may, with some confidence, be subdivided into several functional
categories:

DESCRIPTION O~ MORTUAR Y DA~A

6~

Figure 19: Burials at 41 HR 80. A, Burial 9; note extreme fragmentation and disarticulation. B, Burial 13.

1. Items of personal adornment; these are the various styles of shell beads which were usually
found distributed around some part of the body; e.g., neck or wrist.
2. Implements; utilitarian artifacts of an industrial nature such as fishhooks, awls, bone
projectile points or hammerstones.
3. Personal goods; artifacts that are either non-functional or are of a non-industrial nature and
that presumably are significant in a personal sense, possibly (but not necessarily) magico-religious,
recreational, or secular ceremonial; e.g., bone dice, flageolets, the broken and worn ground endnotched stone, the probable rattle indicated by drumfish teeth and pebbles from Burial 12, and the
conch shell pendant. While the shell pendant might have been an item of personal adornment on
occasion, its presence in the cemetery appears to have been inside a woven pouch or bag hung from or
placed at the waist. The ground quartzite netsinker was broken, with the break heavily worn
indicating some considerable use or handling. It has been carried in this analysis as "personal goods"
rather than as an "implement", but to do the opposite, which is not wholly unreasonable, has no
significant impact on analysis.
4. Other burial accompaniments; these include red ochre and Modiolus shell. The Modiolus
occurred as a small concentration about 15 cm. in diameter located at the bottom of the grave and
usually slightly to one side of the body rather than directly under it. These shells are extremely fragile
and were usually reduced to small fragments when encountered in excavation. For this reason, we do
not know if whole mussels were placed in the grave (as would be indicated by articulated valves) or
simply the shells. Moreover, such shell concentrations can easily be missed or disregarded as part of
the midden deposit, and so we are unsure that such a feature, unreported by Gramley, was uniformly
absent from the burials excavated by him.

vertical, mandible protrudes at left; beads encircle neck area.
The red ochre occurred as small fragments either concentrated in a sin!!! area adjacent to some
part of the body (perhaps originally enclosed in a perishable container) or else scattered throughout
the grave fill around the body. Red ochre is not native to the coastal zone and must have been imported.
3It was commonly used on the coast for painting pottery (Goose Creek Red-Filmed), for mortuary
purposes, to color artifacts such as the bone dice from Burial 2, and perhaps for other uses, but should
probably be considered a raw material or an ingredient.
5. Burial container; this unique feature of Burial 23 (i.e., placed in a ceramic vessel) was
described previously under "form of disposal" and has been included here as a grave good.
Table 11 lists the occurrence of grave good categories by burial and cemetery (the previously
mentioned "burial container" is excluded from this table for editorial convenience). Bearing in mind
the uncertainties inherent in drawing conclusions from this small sample, we shall suggest what is
indicated for the Boys School cemetery. "Personal adornment" goods occur only on adult males and
infants; females are not represented. "Implements" occur only with adult males perhaps indicating
that the activities represented by these artifacts are exclusively or primarily male~associated; e.g.,
weaving or basketry (as indicated by the bone awls), fishing, hunting, and flint working. "Personal
goods" are associated only with male and female adults possibly indicating these items to be of
personal significance or personal property. "Other burial accompaniments" (red ochre and mussel
shell) are associated with male and female adults and with infants. Except for Burial 2, which has a
little of nearly everything, the occurrences of personal adornment items, implements and personal
goods are mutually exclusive. Ochre and mussel shell occur alone as well as with all other grave good
categories (at least, via Burial 2) and all age and sex groups. These latter may have been the grave
goods most likely to have been associated with an abstract general system of values or beliefs relating
to the death event. The occurrence of the other artifact categories may have been determined by, and
thus reflect, roles or statuses in life. In this regard, we should make two final observations. First, the

DESCRiPtION O~ MORTUARY DA~A

63

individual in Burial 2 is unique among all other known burials on the upper coast in variety of the
associated grave goods assemblage. Perhaps this individual was a shaman or other high status
individual, or perhaps he was a transient and his personal property reflects accumulation in a
different cultural and/or social system. Second, we should not lose sight of the fact that nearly 60% of
the Boys School burials had no grave goods of any kind.

CAPLEN CEMETERY
The Caplen Site (41 CV 1), located near the town of Caplen on Bolivar Peninsula (Fig. 1), was
excavated in 1932 by A. M. Woolsey under the direction of Prof. 1. E. Pearce of the University of Texas.
Campbell [1957) reported such data as could be reconstructed from the field notes, but since all except
20 of the skeletons were discarded by the excavators and since no documentation on the cemetery plan
has survived, analysis was necessarily quite limited. Nevertheless, with data on two additional
cemeteries now available some of the Caplen burial data can be seen in a larger perspective. For this
reason the original field notes, as well as Campbell’s report, were used to compile data similar to those
recorded for the other cemeteries; this data is presented in Table 8. There are still too many gaps in
this data to greatly improve on Campbell’s analysis but some additional comparisons can now be made.
The Caplen Site was approximately 15 meters in diameter (Campbell 1957: 450) and, iudging from
excavation photographs in the field notes, was principally an oyster shell midden that was underlain
by beach deposits and overlain by a layer of dark soil. Some of the burials were interred in the beach
underlying the midden, others were in the shell midden, and still others were in the overlying dark soil.
Depth below the ground surface was recorded by the excavators but in the absence of any
stratigraphic profiles, these depths proved to be poor guides to the stratigraphic zone any given burial
would be found in [iudging this from the field photographs). We are left with hints of considerable time
duration for the cemetery [indeed, Woolsey’s notes speak of three levels or "tiers" of burials), but are
unable to determine any of the details. It does seem likely, however, that the burial statistics from this
site represent averages of a rather long period of time.
The presence of clay (i.e., grog) tempered sherds [Campbell 1957: 465-7) would indicate midden
occupation sometime subsequent to the beginning of the Round Lake Period (Fig. 16) or after about A.D.
1000 [radiocarbon years). The presence of Holly Fine Engraved sherds may further suggest this
occupation as having been toward the earlier end of the Round Lake Period. In any event, the relative
paucity of reported artifacts attributable to the midden may indicate that the site was infrequently
[perhaps never) occupied following the apparent early Round Lake occupation. At what point the use
of the location as a cemetery began cannot be surely stated except that it is not likely to have been
earlier than the earliest campsite occupation [inferred on mediocre artifactual evidence to be circa
A.D. 1000-1200). The fact that one grave was encountered containing European trade artifacts
indicates that site use as a cemetery continued in the historic period. That the cemetery was spatially
located away from an active campsite is demonstrated for at least its later phases by the presence of
graves in the dark, non-midden soil overlying the shell. Whether or not the cemetery was so isolated
during the earlier phases is not demonstrable, given the available evidence in the field notes. This
seems plausible, however, in view of the great number of burials in the site and the proximity of many
of the skeletons to the upper surface of the shell. In view of these considerations, the period within
which the Caplen cemetery was probably utilized can be suggested as extending from about A.D. 1200
to about A.D. 1800 [radiocarbon years). We have no data bearing directly on a determination of the
season of use of the cemetery.
Form of disposal: most burials which were undisturbed were primary inhumations; the field notes
occasionally refer to bundle burials, but grave disturbances [prehistoric and/or modern) seem to have
been so common that it is more probable these are simply disturbed graves, much like Burial 25 at Boys
School. At least three burials [Burial 2, 37, and 53) were described as having red ochre on the bones.
Since the bones are not now available for study, we cannot determine if the bones were actually coated
with ochre, or if there was ochre in the grave fill, a factor we should like to have known when
considering if the burials were primary or secondary. We may conclude, however, that primary

of the Dead for the Galveston Bay Area
(adapted from Sprague 1968)
Form of disposal
A. Simple (single operation disposal):
i. Primary inhumation (i.e., concealment of the articulated corpse in the ground). This is the
most common form of disposal archeologically known for the area.
ii. Surface disposal (i.e., abandonment of the corpse on the ground surface). This procedure
was reported historically by Cabeza de Vaca for unwanted female infants among the
Mariames and Yguace; archeologically it may be represented by the occurrence of infant
phalanges in Clear Lake Period midden deposits at 41 HR 85 and by fragments of a human
tibia at the top of the shell zone at the Galena Midden. Negative evidence for burials from
local preceramic shell middens may reflect this means of disposal as well.
B. Compound (multiple operation disposal):
i. Reduction of the corpse through cremation; followed by,
ii. Secondary disposal through surface scattering of the cremated remains.
Cabeza de Vaca reported the Coaque cremated shamans and mixed the ashes with water
which was then drunk by relatives of the deceased. Local archeological evidence consists of
a single apparently cremated adult from Wallisville Reservoir, although other cremations
have been reported from Livingston Reservoir. The possibility should not be discounted that
such cremations may be formally identical (and perhaps even historically related) to those in
more obvious ritualistic contexts, as at Jonas Short and Coral Snake mounds. A
classificatory difficulty exists here if the remains are scattered subsequent to cremation.
Why do we find cremated burials to be excavated? The answer may at least partially lie in
the fact that a great deal of energy is required to cremate a body and that it is rare for one to
be totally consumed in aboriginal sites. Thus, the ideology and behavior may call for scattering of the remains (through beverages or otherwise), but the behavior also results in the
preservation of partially charred bones in the archeological site.
II.

III.

Individuality (i.e., the number of individuals placed in a single grave excavation).
A. One individual.
B. More than one individual:
i. Multiple (more than one articulated skeleton);
ii. Mass (more than one disarticulated skeleton).
Because of their entirely different implications, multiple burials consisting of adult female
and foetus or newborn infant combinations should be clearly distinguished from other
age/sex combinations.
Articulation.
A. Articulated.
B. Disarticulated.
C. Semi-articulated.
D. Post-interment articulation disturbance.
Due to prehistoric or modern disturbance of the grave, the extent of original articulation is
partially or completely indeterminate.

Position (i.e., the relationships of segments of the body to each other rather than to any external
feature such as the grave pit or to compass directions).
A. Degree of flexure (i.e., position of legs with respect to the trunk of the body).
i. Extended.
ii. Flexed (legs are at less than a right angle to the trunk).
iii.Semi-flexed (legs are at or are greater than a right angle to the trunk but are not extended).
B. Position of arms:
i. Along sides of body.
ii. Hands to face (or under chin, at sides of head, etc.).
iii.Crossed on pelvis [or abdominal area).
iv. Crossed on chest.
Mixed positions frequently occur; i.e., each arm is in a different position. This is indicated
on the burial attribute tables by an entry in the two appropriate columns.
C. Rotation of head [i.e., in relation to a central axis, or in life, the position of looking forward):
i. To right (of central axis).
ii. To left (of central axis).

V.

iii.Forward [i.e., no rotation).
Orientation of the body.
The bearing of a horizontally placed skeleton is described by a line drawn between the skull and
the center of the pelvis. If we visualize the skull to be mounted on this line as a pointer, thus forming an imaginary arrow, the compass direction to which this "arrow" points is given as the
orientation of the body. Thus, for example, orientations given as N45E and $45W refer to two
burials having the same directional axis with their heads to the northeast and southwest, respectively. The orientation of a body placed in a sitting position is given as the direction toward which
the ventral or chest side is facing.

VII.

Crave goods.
These require textual elaboration for discussing their relationships since they may take on a
great many variations. For some analytical purposes it was sufficient to compare the proportion
of burials with grave goods against other variables; thus, the simple presence/absence scaling on
Tables 7-10. Additional comments on grave goods may be found in the text.

lower edge of sherd concentration.

inhumation was probably the principal disposal type with secondary inhumation of both disarticulated
bone bundles and of articulated ochre-covered skeletons (or portions thereof) as possibilities to be
alert for in future excavations.
Individuality: interments for the most part consisted of single individuals; however, in Burial 24
an adult female was reported along with the remains of an infant. At least two other instances of a pair
of adult skeletons in the same grave were indicated in the field notes (Burials 15 and 16, and Burials 19
and 23), but again we cannot be certain if they were actually associated or were fortuitously interred
close to each other as in the Burial 15 area at Boys School (Fig. 17). Also, reported in Burial 13 were six
adult skulls and in another burial (unnumbered), there were three adult skulls. Whether these
represent a specific type of multiple skull interment or reflect disturbances of prior burials by later
ones are additional questions we cannot yet answer given the available field data.

72

HARRIS COUNTY BOYS SCHOOL

Articulation: all undisturbed burials were articulated, but about one-third of the graves were
either so disturbed or the bones had so decayed that it was impossible tff determine whether they
remained articulated when interred.
Position (also see Table 8): it was possible to determine that 37 burials had been flexed; the
remainder were indeterminate. No cases of extended or semi-flexed positions were documented in the
field notes. The arm positions reported (or observed on sketches and photographs in the field notes) are
those of "crossed on chest or pelvis", 63%; "hands to face", 33%; and "mixed (to face and on chest)",
3%. No significant difference could be seen either between sex or general age group (i.e., infant,
juvenile/adolescent, adult) when compared with arm position. However, this is because the
frequencies are too low to test statistically and not because we have definitely determined
differentiations to be absent.
Similarly, the data on head rotation is too deficient to make comparisons by age group or sex;
however, the types of rotations reported or observed are "to left", 5%; "to right", 10%; and "none",
85%.
Deposition (also see Table 8): in terms of overall percentages, deposition on "back" was 48%, on
"right side" was 28%, and on "left side" was 24%. The data on types of deposition contain somewhat
larger frequencies, so chi-square tests were run on matrices contrasting first age and then sex
categories against types of deposition. Many of the cells had very low frequencies and so these were
not the best of circumstances for using such a test. Both results were extremely low and insignificant
in terms of probabilities that the types of deposition were distributed differently for the various age
and sex categories. The result of these tests, then, is that we have not been able to demonstrate
differentiation of burial deposition type by age or sex.
Orientation (also see Table 8): body orientation was practically never given in degrees, but in
terms of general compass directions. Thus, for example, orientations of E-W or NW-SE as shown in
Table 8 indicate a burial oriented E-W with head to the east, and a burial oriented NW-SE with head to
the northwest respectively; the head end is always given first. Unfortunately, this data is only
sufficient to indicate that the predominant burial direction was W-E (i.e., head to west); 8 heads
(18.6%) were to the east, 30 heads (69.8%) were to the west, 3 heads (7%) were to the south, and 2
heads (4.7%) were to the north.
Grave goods (also see Table 8): grave goods were present in 17 burials (about 26%) at Caplen.
Unfortunately, the age and sex data on skeletons from this site are so fragmentary that general
comments about occurrence of grave goods by age or sex category are not possible. We can, however,
categorize the types of grave goods in the manner previously described for Boys School, and the results
are given in Table 11. As at Boys School, the "items of personal adornment" consisted primarily of
shell beads although Burial 44 also contained a bone pendant. "Implements" referred to the apparent
shell bead-drilling tool kit (including some undrilled shell blanks) found with Burial 2 and the undrilled
bead blanks (presumably) found with Burial 44. "Personal goods" includes the tortoise shell rattle in
Burial 12 and the pigment stones in Burials 25 and 42. Although the pigment stones might justifiably be
considered implements, again, to do so would have no impact on analysis since we have no sex
identification on either burial. The red ochre found in several burials was apparently much more
abundant in any given grave than was the case at Boys School.
The occurrence of these grave goods categories appears to be far more discrete than at Boys
School (Table 11). "Items of personal adornment" are present with bodies of all ages, as are "personal
goods". Ochre, which is more exclusive in its distribution here than at Boys School is only associated
with adults. "Implements", in both cases relating to shell bead manufacture, are associated with
adolescent and adult females thus suggesting the sex/craft linkage noted by Campbell (1957: 460).

JAMAICA BEACH CEMETERY
The Jamaica Beach Site (41 GV 5), containing the smallest and evidently youngest of the known
cemeteries, is located approximately midway along the length of Galveston Island (Figures 1 and 22).
The site, positioned adjacent to Lufkin and Ostermayer bayous on the West Bay side of the island, was

DESCRiPTiON O~ MORTUARY DATA

73

originally excavated in the winter of 1962-63 by members of the Houston Archeological Society for the
Houston Museum of Natural Science. Since that time, only a generalized account has appeared of the
findings and of the somewhat unusual circumstances surrounding the excavation (Ring 1963). In
addition, a description of the only skeletal material available (5 crania) has been given by Aten (1965).
Fortunately, copies of the excavation notes and burial sketches are now available to us in the
archeological papers of E. Raymond Ring (director of the original excavation) which were deposited at
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory some years ago. The cemetery plan, presented here for
the first time (Fig. 22), and the description of Jamaica Beach mortuary data are derived primarily from
this source. In the summer of 1971, a small area of the midden at this site was excavated by Aten for
the principal purpose of obtaining data on subsistence; and while these data will be reported
elsewhere, some of the conclusions will be utilized here.
The Jamaica Beach Site consisted of a narrow, elongate midden situated adjacent to, but
apparently separate from, the cemetery. In other words, the burials had been emplaced in sterile sand
adjacent to the midden area. The cemetery was smaller than those at Caplen and Boys School (only 19
burials were recorded) and was noticeably different in that there were virtually no intersecting graves
or prehistoric grave disturbances.
Five radiocarbon dates were obtained from this site (Ring 1963: 5): two from shells associated with
burials (A.D. 1460 ± 100 on Dosinia shell, A.D. 1500 + 150 on Littorina shell) and three from the midden
(A.D. 1500_+_110 on Littorina shell, A.D. 1280 +120 and A.D. 1120+120 both on oyster shell). In view of
the consistency of the three dates run on Dosinia and Littorina shells (which converge on an average
date of about A.D. 1500), these have usually been accepted as the more probable estimate of the period
of midden occupation and cemetery use.
The significance of the radiocarbon dates run on oyster shell (averaging to about A.D. 1200) is
uncertain. While it is possible an earlier occupation may have gone unrecognized, the bulk of the
evidence suggests the A.D. 1500 estimate to be more nearly correct. This evidence consists of:
radiocarbon dates associated with burials; European artifacts in the midden (Ring 1963: 6-7); and the
assemblage of sandy paste, grog-tempered and bone-tempered ceramics recovered by Aten in 1971
(unpublished data) which tend more to be a feature of the post-A.D. 1400 period in the Brazos DeltaWest Bay area (cf., Aten 1971: Fig. 10). Occupation season is indicated by lhe archeological fauna
recovered by Aten in the previously mentioned 1971 test. This fauna contained a disproportionately
small component of reptiles thereby suggesling campsite occupation during a cold or winter season. If
it is possible to identify the Jamaica Beach site with the cultural milieu described by Cabeza de Vaca in
A.D. 1528 for a group known as the Coaques, winter occupation on the barrier island would be
expected (Covey 1961). Of possible additional significance in this regard is the occurrence of eight
Dosinia discus shells nested over the left femur of Burial K at this site. Although Ring’s notes and
report do not indicate if these were paired valves, one of the present authors (Aten) was present at
Jamaica Beach when this feature was excavated and his recollection is that the shells were resting on
either side of the bone with their hinge areas adjacent. It is possible the shells were still articulated by
the ligament when placed in the grave. The significance of this occurrence is that articulated Dosinia
valves are washed up on the Gulf beaches in great numbers in the winter season (Andrews 1971: 207208). While this is not conclusive evidence of interment in winter, it lends some further support to the
other evidence.
Form of disposal: all burials at this site were primary inhumations as evidenced by the fully
articulated nature of the remains.
Individuality: all graves, save two, contained single individuals. One of the exceptions contained
three individuals (Burials M, N, and O) buried directly on top of each other (with Burial O on bottom);
separating each skeleton, however, was a layer of shell (principally oyster). The other contained two
individuals (Burials P and Q) with P buried directly above Q; there is no mention in the notes of the
presence of a shell layer separating these (also see Figure 22). Most persons today would probably
agree that winter on the exposed coastal barrier islands would be a physiologically stressful period

(and Cabeza’s comments that food tended to be scarce in January would only make it more so). In view
of this, the facts that multiple burials are present and intersecting graves are absent may take on new
meaning. Both may reflect a higher mortality rate and consequent need to inter more than one
individual at some point, as well as a more frequent interment rate in which the time lapse between
interments was insufficient to allow surface evidence of earlier grave locations to disappear. The
Jamaica Beach cemetery would appear to represent a far shorter span of time than either Caplen or
Boys School.
Articulation: all burials were articulated; eight burials (F, G, H, 1, M, N, O and P) suffered some
disturbance by vandals while the site was being excavated.
Position (also see Table 9): all burials were flexed except Burials D and H which were semiflexed.
The percentages of occurrence of the various arm positions are: "hands to face", 55%; "crossed on
pelvis or chest", 16%; "mixed, side and face", 11%; "mixed, side and crossed", 5%; and "mixed, face
and crossed", 11%. Because of the limited range of age groups represented in this sample, it was not
possible to statistically test for differentiation by age of the remaining items on the attribute list. A chisquare test run on arm positions versus sex categories yielded an insignificant result and thus we
cannot demonstrate any sex differentiation.
The percentages of occurrence of the head rotation types are: "right", 14%; and "none", 86%.
The frequency data for head rotation by sex is too sparse to test by chi-square.
Deposition (also see Table 9): the percentages of the various deposition forms are: "back", 22%;
"chest", 11%; "right side", 5%; and "left side" 17%. Chi-square was used to tedt for differentiation
by sex among the various forms of deposition; however, this result, too, was insignificant and so we
cannot suggest any such sex differentiation here either.
Orientation (also see Table 9): burial orientation data are decidedly better at Jamaica Beach than
at Caplen. We note that only one individual has the head in the eastern hemisphere of the compass; this
is the brachycephalic individual discussed in Aten (1965) as being physically distinct from the other
crania examined. The average bearing of all burials (irrespective of age, sex, or head direction) is
105.2° (standard deviation= 12.7°); the mean bearing for those with heads to the west is 104.6°
(standard deviation = 12.9°). Contrasting the mean bearings of the males versus the females with a
difference of means test, a "t" value of 1.0452 is reached which, with 11 degrees of freedom, is not
especially significant. Thus we cannot suggest sex differentiation with respect to burial bearing or
head direction.
Grave goods (also see Table 9); two adult female burials (10%) contained associated grave goods.
In the case of Burial K, Ring’s notes indicate these consisted of eight Dosinia discus (Andrews 1971:
180-181) valves. These shells are included in Table 11 as "personal goods". Burial S had, located
around the neck, two incised bone beads and a perforated canine tooth pendant. Also present lying
adjacent to the left forearm, were an incised and punctated bone awl about 23 cm. long, two bone pins
or needles, and a flat, incised and punctated bone pendant about 7 cm. long. The beads and tooth
pendant found in the neck area are classed as "items of personal adornment"; the incised and
punctated bone pendant may also have been worn, but this is uncertain from the data at hand; finally
the bone awl and pins are listed as "implements" in Table 11. Since the artifacts or photographs of
them are not available for examination, it is not possible to compare and possibly differentiate these
tools, all associated with an adult female, from those tools associated with adult male burials at Boys
School.
Of uncertain significance for recognition as an aspect of materials included in graves is the
presence of other shells. Without giving details as to occurrence, Ring commented in his notes that
"... where discernible and determinable, all burials had considerable shell (oyster and periwinkle
plus some Venus, Thais, Dinocardium) placed over them; in some cases very heavily."
ISOLATED BURIAL LOCALITIES
As was previously noted, there are a few instances of sites having been excavated to a sufficient
extent that one could be reasonably sure, from the stratigraphic and spatial dispositions, that the

76

HARRIS COUNTY BOYS SCHOOL

documented burials occurred as isolated emplacements rather than as part of an aggregate (i.e., a
cemetery). All of the burials described below, as far as can be determined, were primary
emplacements (except the cremation) of articulated, single individuals not placed in relation to an
aggregate; the remainder of the attributes are given in Table 10. For descriptions of any grave goods,
see the cited reports.
41 CH 13 (Wallisville Reservoir, Ambler 1973: 32-38): four burials were discovered at this site in
grave pits ranging in depth from 85 to 110 cm. below the surface. These were traceable upward to
within 20 to 30 cm. of the surface. These pits probably could not have been dug quite so deep if they
had originated from the present ground surface, and are more likely to be contemporaneous with
occupations represented by the site’s upper levels. Since ceramics from these levels are characteristic
of the Clear Lake Period (Aten, unpublished data), these burials may be the earliest yet known for the
Galveston Bay area. In this regard, it is probably significant that these are also the only sitting position
burials known for this area. A conch shell gorget found on the lap and under the skull of Burial 1 is
considered here as a grave good "item of personal adornment" as are shell beads found around the
waist of Burial 4. Much red ochre was also found around the bones of Burial 4 (Table 11).
41 CH 16 (~A/allisville Reservoir, Ambler 1973: 50-52): three burials were discovered at this site;
however, since the burial descriptions in Ambler (1973) differ from the descriptions given in the
original field notes in some possibly significant respects, interpretations here are based on the field
notes. All burials were damaged but were described as flexed and horizontal, rather than the sitting
positions reported in Ambler (1973). Moreover, Burials 1 and 3 contained in situ remains with 1 or 2
cm. of the ground surface. Since surface erosion of such sites is generally insignificant, it seems clear
that at least these two burials were emplaced subsequent to most or all occupational activity. Data for
Burial 2 are less certain, except that the bottom of the grave is at a depth of about 55 cm. below the
ground surface. Thus we can be less sure of its emplacement subsequent to site occupation. In any
event, these graves all date to sometime after the late Clear Lake Period or early Mayes Island Period
(Aten, unpublished data). The only grave accompaniment noted at this site was red ochre in the fill of
Burial 3 (Table 11).
41 CH 32 (Wallisville Reservoir, field notes and specimens on file at Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory): a single burial was discovered at this site in a dense clay zone which separated an
underlying preceramic shell midden from an overlying, much younger shell midden. The clay zone and
the overlying shell zone contained sherds indicative of occupation beginning in late Old River Period
and extending into the Orcoquisac Period (Aten, unpublished data). The burial is attributable to some
time within this span.
41 CH 110 (~Vallisville Reservoir, Gilmore 1974 and personal communication): two burials were
encountered in the 1972 excavations at this site both of which appeared to be primary interments
made in culturally sterile sediments prior to initial deposition of the overlying midden which dates
either to the terminal Round Lake Period or to the early Old River Period. The point bar deposits in
which the burials are emplaced, and upon which site 41 CH 110 rests, date to Trinity River Channel
Stage 3 which ended about A.D. 600 (Aten, unpublished data). It was, therefore, physically possible for
the burials to have been placed any time between A.D. 600 and the early Old River occupation of the
overlying midden. However, 41 CH 110 is clearly oriented with the unnamed, north-flowing bayou
immediately east of the site. This bayou is a former main channel of the Trinity during Channel Stage 4
and was itself abandoned about A.D. 1400 (Aten, unpublished data) at which time it became a cut-off
meander. It is no coincidence, then, that the earliest radiocarbon dates from this site are statistically
identical to the time the adjacent bayou became a quiet marshy backwater (i.e., around A.D. 1400) that
would be more productive given the foraging subsistence typical of the prehistoric cultures of that
time. Thus, it seems more reasonable to suggest these burials are contemporaneous with the very
earliest occupations at this site, or sometime in the early Old River Period. Both burials were oriented
nearly east-west with heads to the west. Both contained red ochre, which was especially abundant in
Burial 1 (Table 11).

4! CH !72 (Wallisvi!le Reservoir, T.D. Di!lehay and R.H. Butler, personal communication): the
remains of a single cremated individual (apparently an adult) were encountered in levels ranging from
10 to 30 cm. depth which, based on ceramics, date to the Mayes Island Ceramic Period. In view of the
relatively shallow depth, this burial could range in time of emplacement from relatively recent
prehistoric time to as far back as the Mayes Island Period. No grave accompaniments were found and
this burial, because of its different formal attributes, is not included in Table 10. The excavators
believe this skeleton may have been emplaced subsequent to incineration.
41 HR 5 (Doering Site, Wheat 1953: 171-3): four burials were reported by Wheat from this site. By
comparing skeleton depths against the artifact stratigraphy given in the report and this, in turn, with
the presently recognized artifact chronology (Fig. 16), it appears the grave for Burial 1 originated from
a surface contemporaneous with either the Clear Lake Period or the Mayes Island Period (but
preceding the introduction of the bow and arrow). The graves for Burials 2, 3, and 4 evidently
originated from surfaces occupied after the introduction of the arrow but before introduction of grogtempered ceramics and, therefore, during the late Mayes Island Period or the Turtle Bay Period.
41 HR 7 (Kobs Site, Wheat 1953: 180-2): three burials were also reported by Wheat from this site.
Again, by comparing skeleton depths with artifact stratigraphy, it appears that the graves for Burials
5 and 6 originated from surfaces post-dating the introduction of arrow points but which precede the
appearance of grog-tempered pottery and, thus, are contemporaneous with either the late Mayes
Island Period or with the Turtle Bay Period. Burial 7 is somewhat younger, with the grave appearing to
have originated from a grog-tempered ceramic bearing zone, and therefore, is probably associated
with either the Round Lake or Old River periods. A tortoise shell rattle associated with Burial 5 is
considered here as an item of "personal goods" (Table 11).
In reviewing the data from Addicks Dam Basin (41 HR 5 and 7) we note on Table 10 that while sex
ca tegories are about evenly represented, the sub-adult age ca tegory is distinctly under-represented. It
is worth noting also that there is a direct correlation between the age of burials (as interpreted here)
and their degree of preservation as indicated in Wheat’s sketches (Wheat 1953: Figures 10 and 16).
Thus, we may have, at Addicks, an age category bias (i.e., under-representation of infants, juveniles,
and adolescents) introduced by differential preservation of sub-adult skeletal material. This, of course,
is in distinction to the generally excellent chemical environment in shell middens for preservation of
bone material.

NON-GRAVE OCCURRENCES OF HUMAN SKELETAL REMAINS
It will also be appropriate, for the synthesis to follow, to mention yet another kind of evidence for
disposal of the dead. The excavations of shell midden refuse in both Test Pit 2B and in Area A at 41 HR
85 (Fig. 2; analysis of Area A is not reported here) each yielded a single isolated digital phalange,
apparently from infants. No other evidence of a burial or of isolated skeletal elements was found. In
view of the magnitude of physical separation between the two excavation areas in question, it seems
most probable that the two phalanges represent two separate individuals. Preliminary evaluation of
the artifacts indicates that both phalanges were incorporated in Clear Lake and/or Mayes Island
Period refuse and more than likely date to sometime within that time range. Although there are
possibilities that these phalanges originated from a prehistorically damaged or destroyed burial, it
would appear to be a strong possibility that they are remains of the bodies of infants which were
abandoned on the ground surface.
A third occurrence of what may possibly be a similar situation is documented in the previously
referenced unpublished notes of E. Raymond Ring now on file at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory. In the late 1950’s, Ring totally excavated a small shell midden (41 HR 61) on Hunting Bayou
in Galena Park. Ceramics from this site consist primarily of a Clear Lake Period assemblage (Aten,
unpublished notes), and this dating is supported by a radiocarbon date, on Rangia cuneata from the top
of the shell zone, of A.D. 50+105 (Ring 1961: 318), which may be corrected to A.D. 285. (An additional
radiocarbon sample from the contact of the shell zone with the underlying Beaumont Formation has

HARRIS COUNTY BOYS SCHOOL

78

evidently been contaminated by non-radioactive carbon and yields an abnormally old age estimate). In
this zone of non-shell refuse overlying the Clear Lake Period shell midden at this site, Ring excavated
two small, conjoining fragments of the same adult human right femur. Ceramics were common but
grog-tempered wares were conspicuously absent. Also, a single arrow point occurred. These artifact
data would indicate that this upper zone (and, presumably, the human femur fragments) dates
anywhere from about A.D. 500 to A.D. 950 (radiocarbon years). Ring interpreted these specimens as
evidence for cannibalism, and they may be. An alternative possibility, however, is that these are
skeletal fragments from an adult whose body had been abandoned on the ground surface and from
which fragments of the femur became incorporated in the midden refuse. To be sure, there are other
alternative possibilities: the bones may have been dug out of an archeologically undiscovered grave,
perhaps by an animal, and left upon the surface then to be incorporated in the midden deposit. Or, they
may have been brought to the site by an aboriginal who may have obtained them in one of a number of
ways. This is idle speculation, however, and for our subsequent purpose of presenting a coherent
hypothesis of mortuary practice development, the interpretation of surface abandonment of the body
will be adopted. This choice is not entirely one of convenience as it will be seen in our discussion of
population demography that an entirely different category of evidence indicates that placement of
corpses elsewhere than in graves at middens may have been an extremely commonplace occurrence.

NON-OCCURRENCE OF BURIALS
As important as our positive evidence is for studying aboriginal mortuary practices, it is equally
important to point out certain lines of negative evidence. First, a very considerable volume of
preceramic refuse has been excavated at various places on the upper Texas coast, and there has
never, to our knowledge, been discovered a contemporaneous burial. Likewise, all of the more recent
ceramic periods in the Galveston Bay area have had roughly equal amounts of excavation; yet, only
four burials are known that are likely to date from the Clear Lake Period, and only four or five burials
are known that possibly date to the Mayes Island Period (Table 10). Beginning with the Turtle Bay
Period, however, the burial inventory enlarges considerably. Even if an occasional burial should be
discovered in preceramic refuse in the future, as well as more Clear Lake and Mayes Island Period
burials, their usual absence nevertheless seems clear.

UNUSED BURIAL DATA
Finally, certain additional and well-known burial localities will be briefly mentioned primarily
because failure to do so might otherwise be questioned. First, there is the Albert George Site (Walley
1955), located about 25 miles southwest of Houston on the Brazos River floodplain. This site may have
consisted of a cemetery emplaced in an earlier pre-existing midden which contained pottery, but for
which no arrow points were reported thus suggesting midden occupation sometime between
approximately A.D. 100 and A.D. 500. There is no precise mention of how many burials were
recovered, but evidently there were at least 14 (in six 5-foot square grid units) of which at least four
burials appear to have contained grave goods (i.e., at least 28%). Since one of the graves was said to
contain a cache of six dart points, perhaps the cemetery as well dates to a time shortly before the
introduction of arrow points. The data is too sparsely reported, however, to have any real impact on
analysis.
A second burial locality is on Lawrence Island (in the Trinity River delta) where a small group of
burials were excavated by Burley Gardner and A. M. Woolsey in the summer of 1931 and 1932 (field
notes on file at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory). The area evidently was not a cemetery
as defined and used here in that the spatial density of about one burial per 70 square meters in the
excavation was quite low. The field notes, however, are sufficiently complete so that all positional data
can be determined. The problem (and the reason these data are not used here) is that even a rough
guess about their age cannot be made. The notes indicate that the burials are in sand and are capped

DESCRIPTION OF MORTUARY DATA

79

by a thin lens of shell extending out from a neaby midden. Since the burials appear to pre-date the shell
zone, rather than having been excavated through it, we might have made a guess about age of
interment if we knew which of the several shell middens on the island was nearby. Sharer (1966: 6)
identified it as 41 CH 1, but this seems not to be the case since Woolsey’s notes say the site was an eastwest trending shell ridge on the north side of the island; 41 CH 1, to the contrary, is a north-south
trending shell ridge located on the east side of the island. Several sites of varying ages formerly existed
on the north side of the island (before the recent construction of the Wallisville Dam) but no choice
among these seems obvious to us. Some landmarks were mentioned in the field notes and it might be
possible to determine the excavation locality by questioning some of the older residents of the area, but
for the present the data are not usable.
A third instance is a single burial from 41 HR 62 (adjacent to the previously mentioned Galena
Midden) excavated by E. R. Ring considerably earlier than his well-done Jamaica Beach excavation
and documented in his notes and papers on file at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in
Austin. There, the excavation controls on artifacts and description of the skeleton position are not
adequate for use except to say that it was an isolated, flexed burial apparently postdating the
introduction of arrow points.
A fourth occurrence is the intriguing remains of a young (mid-20’s) female from the Presidio San
Agustin de Ahumada (41 CH 53)a t Wallisville, Texas (Tunnell and Ambler 1967: 21-22).. The burial was
removed by relic hunters and so the excavators were only able to obtain sketchy, recollected
information about the burial form. Although this form appea~s to have been aboriginal in nature, the
physical features of the skeleton were aberrant and may, in fact not be those of an Indian. In any event,
the data and association with the Spanish site are too sketchy to be any help in this analysis.
A moderately large number of other isolated burials are known to have been excavated
throughout the Galveston Bay area, but yet remain unreported in the literature.

IV. THE HUMAN SKELETAL MATERIALS FROM BOYS SCHOOL
AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR
ABORIGINAL DEMOGRAPHY
BY AL B. WESOLOWSKY AND ROBERT M. MALINA

INTRODUCTION
The 32 individuals represented in the collection of skele tal ma terials from the Harris County Boys
School Site are in a reasonable good state of preservation. Completeness, however, varies from
practically entire skeletons to individuals represented by only a few bone fragments. Aside from
stature reconstructions, traditional osteometric approaches were not used in this study since there is a
growing realization in physical anthropology that understanding of the significance of data derived
from such techniques is markedly deficient. An additional reason is that metric data would not add
materially to our understanding of the cultural aspects of the Boys School cemetery. These bones are
presently stored in the Physical Anthropology Laboratory of the University of Texas at Austin and are
available for additional study there. In this section, we will discuss stature reconstructions and
osteopathology, and will offer comments on implications of the skeletal materials for demography. We
would like to express our appreciation to Dr. Thomas T. Lowry, an orthopedic surgeon, for his
assistance in evalulating the post-cranial skeleton of Burial 21.

STATURE RECONSTRUCTIONS
Stature reconstructions were possible on seven adult specimens, five males and two females. The
reconstructed statures of the present series are compared to the Texas Coastal series of Woodbury
and Woodbury (1935) in Table 12a. The utility of attempting stature reconstructions for earlier human
populations is questionable, especially when we recall the complexity of factors that operate on an
individual to produce his adult stature (cf. Huber 1968). Nevertheless, the Boys School material and the
other available skeletal data are not vastly different in their reconstructed statures, although a larger
series would be needed for definitive statements.

OSTEOPATHOLOGY
The health status of the present series, as reflected in skeletal and dental pathology, is generally
good. No pathologies were observed in the juvenile materials, or, with one exception, the adult females.
Six of the seven observed pathological conditions occurred on five males and one female in the 30-40 +
years of age range, and may represent to some extent concomitants of the normal aging processes.
Of the observed pathologies, the following three were diagnosed as arthritic changes:
A. Burial 1 -- a bony spur on the first lumbar vertebra, with other lumbar vertebrae showing
some slight lippings.
B. Burial 2 -- moderate osteoarthritic lipping of the lumbar and cervical vertebrae, with no
involvement in the thoracic vertebrae or in the rest of the skeleton. Such a pattern of occurrence of
lipping has been noted by Stewart (1966) in Eskimo materials and he suggested that the observed
pattern is a reflection of differential spinal mobility. That is, the neck area and the lower back are the
areas that are required to do the most twisting and are the most mobile. Such a pattern should be
common in most of Homo sapiens.
C. Burial 16 -- slight lipping of the articular facets of the proximal ulna. There is no evidence of
pathology elsewhere in the skeleton.
Infections of the bone and other conditions accounted for two pathological individuals:
A. Burial 13 -- an adult male which showed a mild inflammation affecting the cortical bone of the
femur and tibia that was diagnosed as periostitis.
B. Burial 29 -- a 30-40 + years old female (the only pathological female) showed a combination of
osteoarthritis and bone inflammations. The vertebrae showed considerable lipping, and the left tibia

evidenced a condition quite similar to that in Buria! !3 above, but with some involvement of cancellous
bone. In addition, this individual had a fractured right clavicle and her teeth were so worn as to expose
the pulp.
The two remaining pathological specimens are somewhat unusual, and are difficult to classify
conveniently:
Burial 5--this 30-40 years of age male displayed a well-delineated depression on the posteriorinferior lingual surface on the right horizontal ramus, and an area of bone elaboration on the left
inferior border, opposite the depression. Roentgenography indicated an obvious radiolucency in the
area of the depression (the right side), and an area of similar size, but with less well-defined borders
inferior to the affected area on the left side (Fig. 23). Since both radiolucencies are in the same general
area bilaterally, a genetic and/or developmental situation is suggested. The most common bilateral
anomaly that produces a lingual depression or radiolucency below the mandibular canal is a
developmental lingual mandibular salivary gland depression. The developmental inclusion of
glandular tissue within or more commonly adjacent to the lingual surface of the body of the mandible
produces either a deep, well-defined depression or, if it lies within the mandible, it produces an
expansion of the bone.

Figure 23: Mandible from BuriaI 5, 41 HR 80. Note bilateral horizontal ramus involvement.

Burial 21--this young adult male (22-25 years of age based upon the medial clavicular epiphyses)
was apparently "crippled". Joint involvement was evident in the left elbow, with bony spurs at the
olecranon process. The right femur was rotated internally approximately 80°, had a small diameter,
and displayed reduced cortical thickness. The right tibia was likewise reduced in diameter and
cortical thickness when compared to the left tibia. The right tibia and femur both showed
subperiosteal bone deposition. Slight subperiosteal bone deposition was also noted on the left tibia.

HARRIS COUNTY BOYS SCHOOL

82

The condition of the entire right lower extremity compared to the left is suggestive of a post-paralytic
condition. The involvement of the right tibia, which appears atrophic, would seem to rule out a
developmental deformity during the years of active growth. Furthermore, no evidence of healed
fractures (with possible consequent deviant growth) was apparent on any of the long bones.
Healed fractures, which we are considering apart from the pathology described above, were
noted in four adults (three males and a single female). The males all had a distally fractured ulna (left
ulna in Burials 1 and 31, right ulna in Burial 13) suggesting, perhaps, "parry" fractures. The adult
female mentioned above (Burial 29), had a healed fracture of the right clavicle. The sub-adult skeletons
were free from dental caries and osteopathology. The adult dentitions were also in a good state of
health. Out of 25 dentitions of varying completeness, hypercementosis was present in two individuals
(8%), abcesses present in four (16%), and caries in only three (12%). This small tally of dental
pathology was evenly distributed among adult males and females. Likewise, dental wear was similar
between the sexes, the degree of wear ranging between 2 and 3 on a five-point scale (i.e., 2 = islands
of dentine exposed; 3 = dentine exposed over most of the occlusal surface).

NON-METRIC CHARACTERISTICS
No consistent pattern of "non-metric" features was evident in the collection, except for
"shoveling" of the incisors. Observed characteristics include the following:
A. Burial 8 -- bilateral mylohyloid bridges.
B. Burial 11 -- Carabelli’s cusps on the second deciduous left molar.
C. Burial 17 -- third molar present on the left, congenitally absent on the right.
D. Burial 21 -- supernumerary premolar.
All of these features have been noted on numerous skeletal collections from archeological
excavations and in modern populations. The significance of their presence at the Harris County Boys
School Site cannot as yet be evaluated.

DEMOGRAPHY
Evaluation of sex and age at the time of death were based upon the criteria presented by
Brothwell (1962) and Krogman (1962), as well as the authors’ own experience. When present, the pubic
symphyses of adult males were used to age the skeleton. More often, however, we had to rely on the
less satisfactory method of judging cranial suture closure and dental attrition. The sub-adults,
however, could be aged more confidently by dental development and epiphyseal union. The evaluations
of age and sex are recorded in Table 7 and are summarized in Table 12b.
Although dealing with a small sample, there are several points of interest:
1) The age at the time of death ranges from one individual under six months (Burial 23) to adults
over 40 years of age (Burials 1, 15, 29).
2) Seven (22%) of the 32 individuals were under 10 years of age at the time of death; four of these
seven were under two years of age.
3) Of the 23 individuals which are adult (over 20 years of age), 12 are male and seven are
female, with the remainder unidentified as to sex. Of the 19 adult individuals identified as to sex, 63%
are male and 37% are female.
The implications of these observations, while not certain, are of interest if we try to see if any
cultural patterns are reflected in the skeletal data. If we try to assume that this collection of 32
individuals generally reflects the demographic structure of the population from which it was drawn
two questions must first be answered.
First, is the collection of skeletons an accurate reflection of the total demographic constitution of
the cemetery (as opposed to the structure of any once living population)? Since argument has
previously been given that a very large part of the cemetery was probably excavated, we think this
assumption is justified. Second, does the demography of the skeletal collection reflect the actual
demographic structure of the population from which the cemetery population was drawn? It seems

HUMAN SKELETAL MATERIALS

83

certain that the occupants of the Boys Schoo! locality followed a seasonal round of settlement and it
would appear that the Boys School Site was occupied primarily during the summer, although otherseason occupation to some extent cannot be ruled out at this time. Since the Indians were evidently
more likely to be living elsewhere during the winter, during which time the rigors of subsistence and
weather might be expected to be greater, it may be likely that we are dealing with season-specific (and
therefore site-specific) mortality trends. The notion of season-specific mortality trends adds an extra
dimension of complexity to interpretations of the social biology of this human population.
In light of these assumptions and caveats, what conclusions may be drawn from the Boys School
material? First, if we assume that the skeletal collection from Boys School does represent the overall
demographic composition of the Indian population that inhabited the site, the low percentage of
children under 10 years of age is unexpected. Table 12c compares the age structure of several modern
groups and the Boys School material for relative frequency of those under 15 years of age versus those
over 15 years (we can, of course, only approximate this breakdown in the Boys School data). The
similarity of the ratio of age categories at 41 HR 80 and those in the United Kingdom deserves
comment. The ecology and social biology (medical practices etc.) of the Indians of the Texas coast are
obviously not to be directly equated with that for modern, industrialized societies. What we think may
be a viable possibility is that the sample drawn from the Harris County Boys School Site reflects
population demographic patterns during seasons when subsisting was relatively easy and the weather
not harsh: i.e., in the summer. The way to test this hypothesis would be to excavate and describe the
demographic structure of cemeteries at sites where the archeological data indicates occupation
during the winter by approximately coeval and culturally similar groups. In this situation one would
expect, all other factors being equal, that the proportion of sub-adults (and of older adults) would show
a marked increase. Although neither are coeval with nor culturally similar to the Boys School
cemetery, the exceptionally low proportions of sub-adults in both the Caplen and Jamaica Beach
cemeteries (10% and 13% respectively; Tables 8 and 9) would seem to argue that either the hypothesis
stated above is incorrect, or that there was some additional form of disposition other than burial in
these two cemeteries, especially since there is some data to indicate that the Jamaica Beach Site was
occupied during the more stressful winter season. At present we cannot evaluate this question further.
Second, the range of ages at the time of death suggests that cemetery interment was not an agespecific funeral practice at Boys School. If it was age-specific, this rule was not rigorously enforced.
That is, since practically all ages are represented in this collection, we can say that age at the time of
death was evidently not always a determining factor governing interment in the cemetery. The
possibility is not ruled out that young children of a particular sex were denied admission to the
cemetery. Specifically, ethnographic accounts by Cabeza de Vaca (Covey 1961) of Indian groups
located west of Galveston Bay mention killing male children in response to dreams, and discarding
female newborns (with breeding females being secured from other social groups). Since the
determination of sex of the bones of sub-adults is problematical, the sex of infants from Boys School
cannot be determined. This issue is open and cannot be decided on the basis of available evidence;
however, it is interesting to note that during excavations at 41 HR 85 in a very small, discrete
accumulation of Clear Lake or Mayes Island Period campsite refuse (not reported here), a single infant
phalange was recovered from the top of the thin lens of refuse. The only conclusion we can make at this
time is that in order to substantiate inferences such as certain age-specific funeral practices, we must
be alert for very subtle evidence.2
Finally, the observation that there are nearly twice as many identified adult males as females is
difficult to explain. Differential disposal of female corpses is a possibility, but before making any
inferences we need to gain more confidence in the estimate of the proportion of females in the living
population. For example, at the much more recent prehistoric and protohistoric Jamaica Beach Site,
males and females were evenly divided.
2The second occurrence of an infant phalange, noted in the previous chapter describing mortuary data, was discovered after
this ~tion was written--LEA.

CONCLUSIONS
In the final analysis, we must not be above questioning ourselves as to the value of the study of the
human skeletal remains from 41 I-]:R 80. The substantive potential of archeological research has only
lately come to be appreciated, and the same is true of the study of the skeletal biology of earlier human
populations. Much of this report on the human skeletal material is descriptive; stature reconstructions,
non-metric characteristics, and pathology, as seen here, contribute little, at this point, to our
understanding of the cultural and human biological dynamics along the Texas coast. A major part of
the problem with these sorts of data is the small sample size of individuals and the near total lack of
comparative data. Clearly, much future work must be done. At the present time, the Harris County
Boys School sample is the only one available with an adequate evaluation of age and sex structure. The
next best sample comes from Jamaica Beach, but this sample was evaluated by persons unskilled in the
subtleties of age and sex determination. The Caplen sample is unsatisfactory because the excavators
discarded the majority of the skeletal remains during excavation. However, when additional
demographic data does become available we should be in a better position to integrate demographic
patlerns with patterns of seasonal site utilization and patterns of technological development, and to
evaluate questions about how these latter cultural developments affected the structure of the human
populations of the area. Important in this regard is the hypothesis that there may be season-specific,
and therefore site-specific, mortality trends, and we feel that this hypothesis is amenable to testing in
future excavations. Demonstration of the presence or absence of such trends or patterns should
become an integral part of future cultural ecological studies done in the area.

V. SUPPLEMENTARY COMMENTS ON
PREHISTORIC DEMOGRAPHY
BY LAWRENCE E. ATEN

The preceding chapter which includes some observations on aboriginal demography was
completed by Wesolowsky and Malina quite a long time before the balance of this report. In light of
more recent information, preparation of this short section of additional demographic analysis now
seems desirable.
Wesolowsky and Malina concluded that age and sex frequencies for neither the Boys School
cemetery nor the Jamaica Beach cemetery appear to reflect proportions that would occur in natural
human populations. Both cemeteries are markedly deficient in sub-adults (especially infants) and Boys
School has a pronounced imbalance of males over females. It should also be noted that Boys School
seems to have a deficiency of old adults. Wesolowsky and Malina have suggested that cultural
phenomena are likely to be prominent among potential explanations for these imbalances; e.g.,
alternative modes of disposal for certain age/sex categories, and the presence of site and season
specific mortality trends.
However important these data and hypotheses may be for clarifying cultural patterns and
variation, it clearly would be a substantial aid to have more and better skeletal data to improve our
knowledge of the human population demographic parameters. But if site (season) specific mortality
trends, and age and sex specific criteria for cemetery admission did in fact exist, larger and better
samples will do little to eliminate these biases for purposes of demographic analysis. If our present
experience is any guide, neither does it appear, in the Galveston Bay area, that many large cemeteries
will be encountered with hundreds of individuals represented. More than likely we will have to
continue to rely on consolidation of data from individual graves and small groups of graves, such as
have been described in this report, for which there is adequate contextual control. Therefore, if
demographic analysis is to advance on the upper Texas coast, methods are required which are
relatively insensitive to the common inadequacies of archeological data. In this regard, the recent
publication of Demographic Models for Anthropology (Weiss 1973) may prove to be a major step
toward development of such methods.
The structure of any human population is susceptible to quantitative description through the use
of a variety of parameters which are not always within reach of archeological analysts; for example,
fertility rates, mortality rates, sex ratios, age ratios, growth rates, and many more. Weiss (1973} has
presented tables modeling 49 quantitatively different stationary population states on the basis of 19
descriptive parameters. Because these parameters are interrelated, it is possible to select a model
demographic table based on matching up parameters calculated from field observations and thereby
estimate other demographic characteristics of the population which the archeological skeletal data
represents.
The model demographic tables are based upon a general assumption that the populations being
described are stationary, although the models usually will not be far wrong unless this assumption is
seriously violated (Weiss 1973: 10). There are other more specialized caveats as well; for example, if a
burial population is biased for cultural reasons (e.g., if infants and juveniles are disposed of in some
alternative manner so as not to be accurately represented) the skeletal age distribution cannot be used
directly. Weiss has provided a number of alternatives, however, designed to enable the investigator to
choose a model table even though his data are inadequate in some respect. Since anthropological
samples generally require combining male and female data so as to obtain adequate sample sizes,
Weiss’s models are all non-sex models; that is, they represent the combined experience of both sexes.
The results of Weiss’s new study, though not so sophisticated as analysis of an accurately censused
modern population (much detail is sacrificed in compensating for the deficiencies of anthropological
data), nevertheless appears to offer some stimulating new opportunities in the study of prehistoric
populations. Therefore, an attempt will be made here to model prehistoric populations in the Galveston

COMMENTS ON PREHISTORIC DEMOGRAPHY

Bay area using these techniques and to use these models to develop additional arguments relating to
mortuary practices. It should be recognized at the outset that the results are more heuristic than
definitive. They may, however, alert others to some of the potentialities of skeletal data, and to help
structure research in the future which, after all, is one of the principal objectives of this report.
In the Galveston Bay area there are only two cemeteries (Boys School and Jamaica Beach) which
have sufficiently detailed data on age structure to permit analysis. Although supporting information is
lacking, it is assumed, for the present, that both samples represent what were relatively stationary
populations, at least to the extent that population growth rates within the span of a lifetime were
probably very small (of., Weiss 1973: 10). In support of this assumption, the following considerations
are offered. Although there are no known direct estimates of aboriginal population available for the
Galveston Bay region during the period of European contact, it is worth noting that Swanton (1911: 43)
estimated the combined population of the Atakapa, Akokisa, Bidai, and Deadoses to have been about
3,500 persons around A.D. 1700. These, of course, occupied a vast territory extending from the lower
Trinity valley and upper Galveston Bay eastward to Vermillion Bay in Louisiana. The Akokisa, in turn,
are generally said to have occupied a range extending from the lower Neches River westward to the
shores of upper Galveston Bay. Swanton assumed the Texas representatives (i.e., the Akokisa, Bidais,
and the Deadoses) to constitute about one-half of the total, or about 1750 persons.
Mooney (1928) subsequently began a detailed review (never completed) of documentary sources
bearing on the question of population estimates. Relying on Sibley and on certain French sources, he
estimated the population of Atakapa residing in Louisiana during the period roughly centering on A.D.
1650 to be about 1500 persons (Mooney 1928: 9). Swanton later suggested the Akokisa would add
perhaps 500 individuals to this figure (Swanton 1952: 199). Swanton also cites Sibley as claiming the
Akokisa a century later (about 1760-1770) to have numbered 80 men (Swanton 1952: 199). This, in turn,
may translate to a population somewhere in the range of 300 persons. Since Mooney’s and Swanton’s
A.D. 1650 figures were designed to precede the known periods of European introduced diseases (the
first great smallpox epidemic in the lower Mississippi Valley is reported to have occurred in A.D. 1698;
Mooney 1928: 7) these figures may be more reflective of at least the order of magnitude of theAtakapa
and Akokisa population size during the prehistoric period than are the figures Swanton quotes from
Sibley. That is, we shall consider the Akokisa to have consisted of about 500 persons, of whom we
would expect the greater part to be concentrated in the Galveston Bay area (this latter expectation
being based on the greater extent of high carrying capacity habitats in the Galveston Bay area; i.e.,
floodplain and deltaic plain streams, lakes, and marshes, and the large estuary). Interestingly, Birdsell
(1968: 232) notes the average size of the dialectical tribe among widely different groups tends to
approximate 500 persons (a tendency independent of regional variations in population density)
perhaps as a function of the communications possibilities.
There is presently no way of knowing how accurate these estimates may be, but they would seem
to indicate that the population of the Galveston Bay area probably did not exceed a few hundred at the
time of European contact. Since there are no presently noticeable differences in site abundances over
the span of time represented by the two cemeteries (i.e., from the Turtle Bay Period through the Old
River Period, or about 1,000 years) the assumption of a more or less stationary population seems
reasonable. If the local population growth rate had not been very close to stationary, increase in
numbers of individuals over a period of a thousand years would have vastly exceeded Swanton’s
estimate and probably would have produced noticeably larger quantities of late sites relative to
earlier, pre-Turtle Bay sites.
Frequency distributions, by age category (i0 year interval), are presented in Table 10 for the Boys
School and Jamaica Beach skeletons. Although those skeletons aged simply as "adult" could not be
used, those classed as "infant" or "adolescent" (on Tables 4 and 6) were assigned to the 0-9 and 10-19
year categories respectively. Obviously, neither distribution is of the appropriate form for a natural
population. Excluding the markedly underrepresented earliest age category, however, relations
between the remaining categories are not intolerable for analysis. Because of the under-representa-

88

HARRIS COUNTY BOYS SCHOOL

tion in the 0-9 year category, we cannot derive proportional data for age classes, or any other measure,
such as the dependency ratio (Weiss 1973: 40), which contrasts the proportion of old and young
individuals with the intervening adult population. What shall be sought, then, will be some measure
reflecting the state of the adult populations; specifically, average adult age, and mortality rates
between adult age categories.
There is no need to describe in extenso either the meaning of the "survivorship" and "mortality
rate" parameters or the analytical procedure; the reader is instead referred to Weiss (1973). The
survivorship column, however, is simply an inverted cumulative frequency; this is needed to calculate
mortality rates. Mortality rates are "... the proportion of all individuals alive at age X (at the beginning of the age class) who will die before reaching the beginning of the next age class" (Weiss
1973: 36). It is calculated by dividing the survivorship of the age class of interest into the survivorship
of the next older age class, and subtracting the result from 1. Mortality rates for all but the first and
last age categories in both cemetery populations, and the average age of adults (including the 10-19
year age category) were then matched against similar values in the 49 model tables in Weiss (1973:
Appendix C). A fairly close match was found for the Boys School cemetery data in Model Table: 20.055.0; the match for the Jamaica Beach data with Model Table: 30.0-70.0 was less satisfactory, but was
the best that could be found.
Having selected model population parameter tables which appear to match our best available
data from the Galveston Bay area, we may proceed to see what additional population information may
be extrapolated from these tables. In Table 13 are listed those parameter values which are presently
useful in contrasting the Boys School and Jamaica Beach cemeteries. In general, we can see that the
Jamaica Beach population appears to have had a noticeably longer life expectancy, higher average
ages, and a considerably larger proportion of adults surviving past age 50 than in the Boys School
population. Moreover, to maintain population stability, the Jamaica Beach population may have had
lower birth and death rates and required a smaller average biological family size’ and fewer offspring
per family than did the Boys School population (Table 14). For tables of additional parameters such as
mortality rates, fertility rates, life expectancy, and others, the reader is referred to Weiss (1973: 129;
168).
The crude birth or death rates may be analyzed further for their implications for Galveston Bay
area mortuary practices. In a stationary population, the birth rates and death rates are identical and
are expressed as the number of birth or death incidents per person per year (Table 14). Even if the
stationary population assumption is not exactly fulfilled in this Galveston Bay data, the growth rates
from the two populations are at least likely to have been exceedingly small for the reasons cited
earlier. The birth/death rate in the Boys School model population appears to have been about 4.75 per
100 persons per year, and in the Jamaica Beach model population, about 3.07 per 100 persons per year
(Table 14). For convenience, let us round off to 1000 years the time span between the beginning of the
Boys School cemetery and the final use of the Jamaica Beach cemetery. Let us also hypothesize a
stationary population size of 300 persons for the environs of Galveston Bay at any given time over this
period of a thousand years, a figure selected only for its plausibility and consistency with the
previously mentioned Swanton, Mooney, and Sibley estimates of overall Akokisa population. Although
the estimated population size of 300 is only a plausible guess, it may result in a conservative
expression of the point being made, for assuming a death rate of .0485 per person for the first 500
years (the Boys School rate), and a death rate of .0307 per person for the latter 500 years (the Jamaica
Beach rate), approximately 11,880 corpses would have required disposal in the Galveston Bay area
during the total 1,000 year time span under consideration. It thus appears that the known pattern of
distribution of aboriginal burials is far too limited to account for the probable number of corpses that
had to have been disposed.

’Possible independent support for the estimated average biological family size of 3.98 persons may exist in Mrs. Oliver’s
observation that she never saw more than two children in a Karankawa family (Gatschet 1891: 65).

I am aware, as of 1972, of about 170 burials either having been excavated or looted out of
approximately 60 sites of all ages distributed over the entire Galveston Bay area. Few of these sites
were totally excavated, of course, and relatively few of them yielded any burials at all. Clearly, though,
either we have been extraordinarily unlucky (bone preservation in the area being generally good
enough to have recovered some part of a skeleton), or else the remains simply are not there to be found.
No doubt, some will be unimpressed by this argument, citing the limited extent of our data. We are
clearly at a disadvantage here, trying to argue a negative point, but our existing information is not
inconsequential. To date, about 5 percent of the known sites have accounted for nearly 70 percent (or
116) of the known burials. To date, there are about 500 archeological sites known within a band
perhaps 20 miles wide around Galveston Bay. If we speculate that there may be an additional 1,000
sites yet to be found, a total of 1,500 sites may exist. Let us also speculate that two-thirds of these sites
represent the last 1,000 years of Indian history and prehistory (likely a generous estimate). Then,
based on our present experience, and allowing even higher than the known average of 4 burials per
site for 95 percent of the sites and 40 burials per site for 5 percent of the sites (i.e., cemeteries), then a
total of 5,800 burials may exist in local sites; a figure far short of the estimated nearly 12,000 corpses
requiring disposal given a standing population of about 300 persons.
We may, of course, speculate in the reverse direction. If we assume (1) that most corpses
were buried in cemeteries and/or middens, and (2) that we may expect around 5,800 burials to be
found, what then would have been required in the way of a stable source population? Using the same
procedure earlier utilized to derive the estimate of 12,000 corpses, we substitute 5,800 corpses and
solve for the source population size. Then we see that a population of 150 persons of all ages should
yield about 5,800 corpses over a millenium. Intuitively this figure seems much too low given the area
involved, but is this necessarily so? Obviously, there are a great many "ifs" attending this analysis, of
which we have mentioned only a few. It would appear, however, that we must seriously consider two
possibilities in future research in the Galveston Bay area:
1. An exceedingly low standing population size--on the order of 150 persons or roughly 0.1
person per square mile, or
2. A somewhat higher population size of about 300 persons (roughly 0.25 person per square mile)
and a high incidence of corpse disposal elsewhere than through burial in midden sites or cemeteries.

VI. ANALYSIS OF GALVESTON BAY
AREA MORTUARY PRACTICES
BY LAWRENCE E. ATEN

INTRODUCTION
we should begin this section by recalling a caveat made at the outset of this report to the effect
that the quantity of our data is limited and its quality is variable. Nevertheless, we intend to develop
and focus this data on as many research problems and analytical possibilities as is feasible. First,
though, it is necessary to review the manner in which we will be dealing with two basic aspects of the
data: (1) the socio-cultural relationships between sites to be discussed; and (2) the nature of the
ethnohistoric data that is used.
For the purposes of this report, we assume the cemetery and isolated burial sites to be
representatives of a single culture though, on the societal level, probably of different bands. The
reasoning here is based on the similarity in technology and in subsistence, to the extent we have data
on this, and upon geographic proximity. In point of fact, we cannot be completely sure of this. At the
Addicks sites excavated by Wheat (1953) there appear to be some significant differences in hunting
patterns relative to those on the littoral (Aten, unpublished data). Also, Simars De Bellisle reported
encountering Indians from a non-Galveston Bay area group while hunting on a prairie which, judging
from his directions, must have been somewhere in the general vicinity of Addicks (Folmer 1940) and so
it would appear that occupation there by non-local groups cannot be discounted. Burials from Addicks
play such a small part in this analysis, however, that it is not really worth the effort to engage in
disputation over the affiliation of those sites.
The Jamaica Beach site is also a bit uncertain. It has been debated for a considerable period of
time whether or not Cabeza de Vaca’s Malhado Island was indeed that which we know today as
Galveston Island; we follow the argument used by Covey (1961) and others in assuming that it was. If
we grant that Malhado and Galveston were one and the same island, there is still the problem of
relating the Jamaica Beach Site to the Han or the Coaque. Most anthropologists, at least from the time
of Albert Gatschet, have considered the Han likely to have been Akokisa and the Coaque to have been
Karankawa. Cabeza de Vaca reported that while the language of the Han differed from that of the
nearby Coaque, they nevertheless had "... customs in common" (Hedge 1905: 530). This could mean a
multitude of things but is not inconsistent with the existing archeological data. Artifacts and
subsistence evidence from Aten’s 1971 stratigraphic test at Jamaica Beach are substantially similar
both to Brazes Delta sites [Aten 1971 and unpublished data) and to Galveston Bay area sites (e.g.,
Harris County Boys School). Forced to make a choice on technological grounds, we would at this time
find more similarities for Jamaica Beach artifacts (especially the ceramics) in the Brazes Delta area at
sites such as Dew-Cleaver (Aten 1971) and others. Thus, it is possible (perhaps even probable) that
Jamaica Beach represents occupation by an eastern Karankawa band. Culturally, the eastern
Karankawa and the Akokisa apparently were very similar, and so for the purpose of developing the
generalized conclusions reported here, we shall consider them all culturally one.
Ethnohistoric documentation of mortuary practices is very limited but nevertheless does provide
some guidance. Our sources which make reference to burial are Cabeza de Vaca (Covey 1961), I. O.
Dyer (1917), Alice Williams Oliver (Gatschet 1891) and some Atakapa texts recorded by Albert
Gatschet (Gatschet and Swanton 1932). Additionally, a brief general survey of the literature on
mortuary practices of southeastern Indian groups has been made. Principally, this indicates
widespread commonalities in certain mortuary features such as the use of rattles and red ochre,
orientation of the dead body, a belief in the "One-above" that evidently precedes Christian influence,
significance in the four cardinal directions, and so on. Other features such as grave furniture,
positioning of body parts, and cremation, are seen to be substantially more variable. While many of
these features are not archeologically visible, mention of many of them in the Atakapa and Karankawa

GALVESTON BAY MORTUARY PRACTICES

93

ethnohistoric documentation strongly indicates that the societies of the Galveston Bay area shared in
the same basic magico-religious value system common to the southeast generally. Consequently,
although we may cross what appear to be socio-cultural boundaries it does not seem unreasonable to
assume correspondence in some basic mortuary practice features over the geographic area under
consideration here, be the remains Akokisa (Atakapa) or be they an eastern Karankawa band. Thus,
for example, given Cabeza de Vaca’s description of burial of "medicine men" or shamans among the
Han and Coaque, we find Gatschet’s description of the activities of Karankawa shamans of great
interest for shedding light on possible Akokisa practices as well.
DIACHRONIC REVIEW OF BURIAL ATTRIBUTES
In Table 15 we have summarized the relative frequency of occurrence of the various burial
attributes. Although some attempts were made in earlier sections to evaluate the occurrence of these
attributes by age and sex categories, this data is not equally available for all burial groups being
considered. Consequently, Table 15 only presents gross frequencies for each burial group. Our largely
unsuccessful attempt to use statistical tests to aid in discrimination of age/sex correlates of these
attributes have been discussed in previous sections and are not reiterated here in any detail.
Form of disposal The existing data shows a trend from a combination of primary disposal and
surface disposal in the Clear Lake Period to virtually exclusive use of primary disposal probably
supplemented with occasional cremations by the time of the Round Lake Period. The actual situation
may not be this simple, however. There are records from the historic period of infanticide among the
Mariames and Yguace (Covey 1961) and our data may be a reflection of the poor archeological
visability of such a practice. On the other hand, Cabeza de Vaca indicated these to be the only two
groups in tile area to engage in this practice at the time of his visit. Also, we have previously argued on
the basis of demographic factors, the likelihood of alternative means of disposal than that of primary
burial in middens or cemeteries. If this is correct, our data for the Clear Lake through Turtle Bay
periods may be only coincidentally reflecting what was, in fact, a more general situation.
Also poorly represented in this data is the cremation. One such burial is known archeologically
from 41 CH 172 that dates from some point in post-Clear Lake time. Additionally, there is the famous
description of this practice given by Cabeza de Vaca. The cremation of shamans (or anyone else) would
be an extraordinary act in most places on the coastal priaire in view of the relative scarcity of fuel. It
is one thing to build a fire sufficient to open clams or to fire pottery; it is quite another thing, in terms of
energy requirements, to incinerate a human body. This suggests two things: (1) that cremation activity
as described by Cabeza de Vaca may be archeologica!ly visible, in the manner reported at 41 CH 172
because of the difficulty of reducing the entire body to ashes; and (2) that these difficulties indicate the
shaman to have been viewed by other members of the society as quite a special person--one whose
shamanic skills made a profound impression on the general population and entitled this status to very
special mortuary rites.
Individuality. The data available indicates a consistent absence of multiple interments except at
Jamaica Beach. In this instance, recall that adult female/foetus or newborn infant combinations have
been excluded from this tabulation on the presumption that these likely are mother/child combinations
whose joint death was associated with the pregnancy. Additionally, we do not have adequate
documentation on individuality from Capten. At Jamaica Beach there are two multiple burials
containing three and two individuals respectively, all of whom were adult, and three of which (Burials
O, P, and Q) apparently had attained an advanced age. Although sex data is limited, apparently both
males and females are represented. Although we shall soon see Jamaica Beach as different in some
respects from the other burial groups, this particular feature seems best explainable as a function of
increased mortality during a physiologically stressful season. This stress may have resulted directly
from cold or, perhaps, from cold complicated by malnutrition during food shortages at the end of the
cold season.

Articulation. All burials from all sites were articulated, at least where this attribute was
determinable. There were, however, a large number of cases where prehistoric disturbance during
subsequent interments, as well as modern disturbances, made direct determination impossible. This
feature of prehistoric cemeteries, i.e., disturbance of prior graves, commonly resulted in a breaking
and scattering about of skeletal odds-and-ends. Sometimes skeletal parts were left in a partially
articulated condition as in the Burial 15 area at Boys School (Fig. 20A). This apparently has misled
some earlier workers to interpretation of grisly aboriginal scenes. For instance, Pearce (1932)
described finding "... the remains of 25 butchered bodies buried in a wide, shallow pit, possibly the
refuse of a characteristic Karankawa cannibal feast. Many of the bones show the mark of axes and all
the long bones had been broken into at least two or three pieces."
Body position. Although relative frequency differences do exist between burial groups, the range
of positions was confined to flexed and semi-flexed. No particularly clear temporal pattern emerges
from the data in Table 15, nor does the occurrence of a semi-flexed position appear to be correlated
with any other attribute. The only suggestion we can draw is that the three cemeteries seem to show a
lower proportion of semi-flexed burials than do the isolated burials.
Arm position. There is considerable variety in the forms taken by this attribute (Table 15);
however, the principal forms are "hands to face" and "crossed on chest/pelvis". Of possible
significance is the fact that arms positioned "along sides" is virtually confined to the pre-Round Lake
Period burial groups. Although there is minor occurrence of mixed forms prior to the Jamaica Beach
Cemetery, the major occurrence of variation in arm position is at Jamaica Beach.
Rotation of head. More than any other attribute, head rotation direction would seem to be the one
most likely to be influenced by post-burial factors such as decay of soft parts and ground compaction.
Nevertheless, it is one feature that does show strong patterning (Table 15). The Clear Lake Period
burials all have head rotation to the right (i.e., to the right side of the body). Beginning with the Mayes
Island Period burials, a clear majority of the burials show no head rotation and the relative frequency
of this latter feature steadily increases through time at the expense of rotation to the right.
Interestingly, rotation to the left is a rare feature. These patterns are not correlated with, and thus are
not artifacts of, patterns of body deposition as discussed below.
Deposition. The single most outstanding feature of the Clear Lake Period burials was the
predominant use of the so-called "sitting" position. Actually these are flexed burials which differ from
subsequent flexed burials only in the fact that they are placed on end rather than on their side, back,
or chest which is the usual manner in later periods. This form of deposition disappeared rather quickly
to be replaced completely by some form or recumbent deposition. In the post-Clear Lake time periods,
deposition on the back was usually the major form of body placement. Placement on the left side
usually comprised about a quarter of the cases; burial on the right side a slightly larger proportion.
Burial placement on the chest was a very rare occurrence. At the Jamaica Beach Site, however, these
proportions shifted with a noticeable increase in burial on the right side and slight decreases in burial
on the left side and on the back.
Orientation. As was indicated earlier, there are two aspects of body orientation to differentiate
and consider. One is the body axis; the other is position of the head-end of the body along this axis.
Either or both may be utilized as symbols in mortuary ritual. When describing each of the cemeteries,
we discussed attempts to correlate these orientations with age and sex categories, but because of the
limited amount of appropriate data available attempts at these correlations were generally not
productive. In anticipation of the discussion to follow, we are assuming these orientations usually to be
related to the path tracked by the sun, an assumption to be discussed more fully later. Although we
have not calculated precisely the azimuths of the solstices for the Galveston Bay area, a reasonable
approximation that is sufficiently accurate for our purposes may be made from the archeological
literature. At the Mohr Site, located at about 40 degrees North latitude in Pennsylvania, the solstices
occur at 31 degrees from true east-west (Gruber 1971). At the Crystal River Site, located at about 28
degrees 50 minutes North latitude in Florida, the solstices occur at 271/2 degrees from true east-west

HARRIS COUNTY BOYS SCHOOL

(Hardman 1971). Harris County Boys School lies at about 29 degrees 30 minutes North latitude and
Jamaica Beach is situated a few minutes of latitude to the south. Consequently, we estimate that on the
average for the Galveston Bay area the solstices occur about 28 degrees from true east-west. If we
allow a 5 degree margin for errors in aboriginal sighting of the rising or setting sun at the summer and
winter solstices, these azimuths (in relation to magnetic North) for the summer are at 49 degrees and
295 degrees, and for the winter they are at 115 degrees and 229 degrees.
The data on body axis orientations are summarized in Table 16. It is difficult at this point to find
meaning in the overall average bearings except to point out that, aside from Jamaica Beach, our burial
groups are not particularly homogenous. Of greater significance is the time trend of change in
proportion of burials oriented within solstitial limits (Table 16) wherein, over the span of time
represented in this data, the proportion of burials oriented within solstitial limits increased from 40%
in the Clear Lake Period to 84% in the Jamaica Beach Cemetery.
Similarly, data on head direction along the body axis is summarized in Table 16 with respect to
east or west halves of the compass, summer or winter solstice period, and the gross age categories of
adult or sub-adult. Again there is a substantial variability, the significance of which we cannot now
fully assess. However, a number of significant evolutionary trends are noticeable. In the Clear Lake
Period all heads point to some easterly direction; 43 % of the Mayes Island-Turtle Bay isolated burials
do likewise; 75% of the Boys School burials point to the east; 50% of the Round Lake to Orcoquisac
Period isolated burials; 18% of the Caplen burials; and finally, 6% of the Jamaica Beach burials point
to the east. This gradual shift from east to predominantly west pointing burials is probably a very
significant feature, and will be discussed later. However, we should note that, in most cases, burials
emplaced to point in one direction may actually have been emplaced to face in another. We have
analyzed in terms of the direction pointed by the head end of the body axis because this reveals more
structure in the data than if we were to consider the facing direction along with body axis. This may be
an error, but additional burial data will be needed to determine if the facing orientations are
significant.
Positively correlated with the proportion of easterly pointing bodies are the occurrences of head
rotation to the right (Pearson’s r ~.83) and presence of grave goods (r--.72). A strong negative
correlation (r = -.84) exists between bodies with heads to the east and the likelihood of being oriented
within the solstitial azimuth limits. Attempts to correlate burial orientations with age and/or sex
categories have not met with particular success.
Grave goods. Taken in their gross aspect, grave goods of any kind never occurred with more than
half of the burials in any of our samples and began a sharp decline in occurrence after the end of the
Turtle Bay Period (Table 16). For the three cemeteries, at least, this decline is accompanied by a shift
in predominant association of grave goods with males at Boys School to females at Jamaica Beach.
Corresponding changes occur in arm position and perhaps in body deposition mode. The concurrent
changes in body orientation appear to have been initiated much earlier but may not be unrelated.
We have previously described the functional categories used to identify the various types of grave
goods reported. These are: items of personal adornment, implements, personal goods, other
accompaniments, and burial container. All are tabulated in Table 11, except "burial container" for
which there is only one not altogether clear example from Boys School.
Items of personal adornment appear to be associated with all age groups except, perhaps, at
Jamaica Beach; data on sex association is too limited even to hazard a guess. Implements appear to be
associated with adults and, in one case, an adolescent. They may reflect craft or skill specialties of the
individual who was buried and may also reflect sexual division of labor. For example, at Caplen,
artifacts related to columella bead manufacture were associated with females. At Boys School, deer
ulna awls, presumably associated with weaving or basketry, were associated with adult males.
Personal goods are associated only with male and female adults. Other burial accompaniments include
red ochre and mussel shell which are associated with both Sexes and all age groups.

Generally, items of personal adornment, implements, and personal goods tend to be mutually
exclusive in their occurrence. Red ochre and mussel shell often occur alone but tend to accompany
some other form of grave furniture more than do the other categories. As a point of interest, few
diachronic differences are presently evident in the average number of grave goods categories that are
likely to be with a burial. These averages are: Clear Lake Period isolated burials, 1.5 categories; Boys
School Cemetery, 1.5 categories; Round Lake to Orcoquisac Period isolated burials, 1.0 category;
Caplen Cemetery, 1.2 categories; Jamaica Beach Cemetery, 1.5 categories. This presumably reflects a
basic stability in grave furniture symbolism in mortuary rituals. No significant directional trends are
presently evident in the differential associations of these functional categories.

HARRIS COUNTY BOYS SCHOOL

ELEMENTS OF GALVESTON BAY AREA
MORTUARY RITUAL
As has been indicated, mortuary ritual presumably reflects distinctions recognized in life and
constitutes a rite of passage marking the initiation of the deceased into a post-mortem status group. In
a landmark study of approaches for the investigation of mortuary data, Binford (1971) has reviewed
the general relation between features of mortuary practice and societal complexity (as approximated
by subsistence mode), and demonstrated that these are highly correlated variables. This unsurprising
result is of significance in support of our assumption that the type of social organization represented
by the Galveston Bay area data sets some limitations upon reasonableness for interpretation of
mortuary ritual and subsequent development of suitable research designs for testing these
interpretations. Consequently, in the discussion to follow, we shall consider the nature of the society,
factors involved in selection of an appropriate place of burial, and then review the presently
discernable ritual symbols.
Social organization. Direct evidence from ethnohistoric and archeological research indicates the
aboriginal societies of the Galveston Bay area probably to have been organized as bands (subdividing
and reforming according to a regular seasonal schedule), probably to have had shamans and headmen
as the principal sociocentric statuses, and certainly to have been focused primarily on a hunting and
gathering mode of subsistence (e.g., Covey 1961; Fotmer 1940; Gatschet 1891; Ambler 1973; Aten,
unpublished data). How many such bands existed is not known, but some are likely identified for us in
the multitude of recorded names for the Karankawa (Coaque, Copane, Cujane, etc.) as well as by the
Han, Charruco, and Orcoquisas (probably Akokisa bands). Inasmuch as Cabeza de Vaca reported the
Han and Coaque bands to be virilocal and Gatschet (1891: 63) reported the Karankawa of the early
19th century to have had a patrilineally inherited headman for "civil affairs" and an appointed leader
for military ventures, an inference of male-centered egalitarian social organization is probably safe to
assume.
It is helpful for the further interpretation of mortuary practices to consider certain other
structural attributes that are likely to be present in an egalitarian society, and for this we draw
heavily upon Freid:
"An egalitarian society is one in which there are as many positions of prestige in any given
age-sex grade as there are persons capable of filling them" (1967: 33).
Formal ranking and stratification are absent and distinctions between group members (other than
by age and sex) are usually not enduring. Ordinarily, "... egalitarian societies have powerful leveling
mechanisms that prevent the appearance of overly wide gaps in ability among members." One
important such mechanism is an economy based upon "generalized reciprocity". Generalized
reciprocity exists where there are significant, but largely implicit pressures for establishing
expectations for return gifts should an appropriate opportunity arise; "... balance is not required:
those who can, give and continue to give"; "... those who need, take and continue to take" (Fried
1967: 35). This latter point is especially pertinent in reference to Burial 21 at the Harris County Boys
School Cemetery. This burial, a young adult male estimated to have been 22-25 years of age, appears to
have suffered from a post-paralytic condition which affected the left elbow and atrophied the right
lower leg. It seems reasonable to assume that such an individual would not have been able to survive to
adulthood amongst mobile hunter-gatherers without the kind of assistance that would be possible in a
reciprocative economic framework.
Selection of an appropriate burial place. In the data already presented we have described a
number of different types of disposal of human bodies: interment in aggregates, isolated interments,
cremation, and isolated surface abandonment. The significance of these types of disposal requires
careful consideration. An aggregate of interments, of course, is what we refer to here as a cemetery.
We are not aware of attempts to formalize the notion of what a cemetery is; rather, general
understanding of the concept seems to be an assumption. Binford (1968: 272), for instance, describes
the appearance of "true" cemeteries and while we might reasonably guess at his meaning, we cannot

GALVESTON BAY MORTUARY PRACTICES

99

be sure of it. Webster’s Third New International Dictionary (unabridged~) defines cemetery as a
sleeping chamber or burial place; "an area for burial or entombment"; a generalized meaning which
might apply to any location where burial has taken place--even of only a single body. While the
dictionary is much too vague to be of any assistance in recognizing useful distinctions in our data,
Binford, on the other hand, writing of "true" cemeteries, may have a more formally organized space in
mind than we presently know of as existing in the Galveston Bay area.

The burial aggregates reported for the Galveston Bay area appear not to have developed in what
was concurrently a living space. This is strongly indicated by the field relations of the graves and of
habitation refuse at both Harris County Boys School and Caplen; and clearly the Jamaica Beach graves
were physically removed from any habitation. Additionally, there is a little ethnographic data to
support this interpretation. Gatschet (1891: 67) cites an instance of the death of an infant child of a
Karankawa chief wherein the body was not buried at the campsite. Also, Dyer (1917: 3) reported a
Lake Charles Atakapa shaman to have said, upon inquiry about the location of their burial place, that
"... the dead and living could not live together." The available evidence, therefore, indicates that
bodies interred in aggregates were so placed by survivors not then residing at the burial location.
Since no unequivocal evidence for secondary burials exists (the only possibilities being the socalled "skull burials" at Caplen and Burial 25 at Harris County Boys School, both of which are
probably the result of disturbances due to subsequent grave excavations), it seems unlikely that
interment would have taken place very far from the death location at least when death occurred at a
habitation site. How far is speculative but, for example, the Siriono carried bodies off about a quarter
of a mile (Holmberg 1969: 234) and this seems reasonable to suggest an order of magnitude for the
spatial separation between habitation and burial loci.
The phenomenon of the burial aggregate may be an intentional development or it may be an
artifact of some other activity. In the case of the latter, the difference between sites with isolated
individual burials and one with a collection of graves conceivably could originate through a change in
settlement pattern and annual scheduling. That is, a shift from shorter visits at many locations to
longer visits at fewer locations might indirectly create the aggregates we observe. However, such a
change would almost certainly have to be in conjunction with either an environmental alteration
controlling key resource availability, or a technological development both of which would work
changes in the organizational network of statuses in a society even if fundamental changes in social
structure did not occur. The appearance of new energy harnessing devices multiplies the opportunities
to acquire status through the introduction of new skill needs. And, certain innovations permit more
thorough exploitation of a location’s resources thereby enabling visits of longer duration. These are
not especially novel ideas. For example, Binford (1968: 272) suggests the appearance of cemeteries is
related to the development or appearance in an area of energy harnessing devices such as fish weirs
and pottery. He proposed that the appearance of such devices would require an organizational
restructuring for their efficient use and that this in turn would result in a more refined role/status
network, the dislocation of which (by a death) would require treatment through mortuary ritual.
In another study, Saxe (1971: 50-51) has made a preliminary examination of the role of cemeteries
which, in many ways, complements Binford’s hypothesis. Saxe showed that in at least one geographic
area increasing population density and patti-centered social organization control mortuary practices
in egalitarian societies because such practices reaffirm the structure of the social group and because
the group’s "control" of a territory (or of the resources within it) is legitimized by ancestor reference.
In such a circumstance the mere existence of a grave aggregate is symbolic of a group’s past presence
in a territory and expectation of future entitlement to that territory or its resources.
There presently is not adequate survey data on the age distribution of sites in the Galveston Bay
area to determine whether or not quantitatively significant shifts took place which would indicate
alteration in the number of habitation locations visited and the frequency of these visits. In fact, a
substantial amount of new data on season of occupation from upper Texas coast shell middens that is
currently undergoing analysis indicates a basic stability in scheduling from at least the Clear Lake

100

HARRIS COUNTY BOYS SCHOOL

Period through historic times (Aten, unpublished data). At the same time, there is data to indicate the
occurrence of significant technological changes. Beginning with their appearance in the area at about
A.D. 100, ceramics increased substantially in quantity and in variety of decorative design styles after
the beginning of the Turtle Bay Period (about A.D. 650). This same time range (late Mayes Island-early
Turtle Bay periods) saw the appearance of the bow and arrow. In addition, analysis of faunal remains
from the Dow-Cleaver Site in the Brazos Delta leads strongly to the inference that the use of fish weirs
appeared in this period as welt (Aten, unpublished data). It is subsequent to these technological
innovations that the first known grave aggregates occur in the Galveston Bay area.
It therefore appears that technological factors could have resulted in longer stays at fewer
localities within a stable scheduling framework and, in conjunction with these longer periods of
residence, that burial aggregates were created. In view of the numerous locational alternatives for
placing a burial that would still exist given the preceding changes in settlement pattern which would
not result in creation of an aggregate, it appears reasonably clear that burials were so placed to be
within a formally designated space.~ Within this designated space, the numerous intersecting graves
probably reflect infrequent interments such that precise locations of prior burials were forgotten
and/or no longer visible from the ground surface.
At the Harris County Boys School and Caplen cemeteries we have previously documented our
inability to describe any systematic organization of the cemetery space. In the Jamaica Beach
Cemetery, however, there may be evidence that concepts of the place of body disposal continued to
undergo modification. Although the extremely regular placement and near absence of intersecting
graves there could be explained by the apparently shorter span of use of this cemetery in conjunction
with an apparently greater seasonally induced mortality rate (as probably evidenced by the multiple
burials), the extreme consistency in orientation and other positional attributes suggests that
alternative factors may have been at work. Indeed, Jamaica Beach may represent a distinct trend
beyond the earlier types of cemetery as a formally designated space, to a new type of cemetery as a
formally organized space. Thus it is intriguing to recall the conclusion reached by Schaedel (1949: 135)
that Karankawa religious and political structure apparently evolved to a more complex level of
integration in the period subsequent to Cabeza de Vaca’s sojourn.
This apparent developmental sequence for burial aggregates surely documents important, albeit
only dimly visible, changes in societal and/or in man/land relationships. It is equally important,
however, that this mortuary sequence be kept in perspective. In a previous section discussing
demography, we deduced that there either would prove to be an exceedingly low standing population
so as to account for all of the burials likely to be found in all sites in the area dating to the last thousand
years of local prehistory, or there would have been a more reasonable larger standing population size
and we must consider that for every body interred in a cemetery or habitation site, another may have
been disposed of elsewhere. In the latter situation, which we favor, no doubt some portion of this
number became deceased in places or under circumstances that rendered recovery of the body
difficult or impossible, but we are still left with a sizeable number of bodies that have been disposed of
in some manner not now archeologically visible.
Since the use of the word "burial" has been to signify "... deliberate mortuary treatment and not
necessarily placement of the remains in a covered grave" (S. Binford 1968: 141), it is in this light we
should consider the remaining known disposal types: isolated interments, cremations, and isolated
surface abandonment.
Isolated interments (i.e., simply those not part of a recognizable aggregate) are presently known
only from habitation sites. They clearly reflect a mortuary treatment similar, perhaps identical, to that
evident in the burial aggregates. The earliest known isolated interments date to the Clear Lake Period
and are found through to historic times (Table 10).
’As a result of this we probably should revise our earlier definition of a cemetery (i.e., spatially limited areas in which burials
were made by choice rather than chance) to "a spatially limited area in which burials were interred to be part of a socially
defined aggregate of graves rather than a random collection of individual graves."

GALVESTON ~A Y MORT~AR Y PRACTICES

~oi

Cremations likewise reflect a mortuary treatment, although substantially different from that of
primary interments. Only one such burial is known archeologically (from 41 CH 172) and it may date
anytime from the Mayes Island Period to historic times. There is no archeo!ogical evidence, other than
the cremation itself, to suggest the status of the particular individual involved. Although the Han and
Coaque were reported to have cremated shamans, this may or may not be the case with the cremation
from 41 CH 172. Indeed, the nature of the grave goods with Burial 2 at Boys School suggests that
interment possibly may have been of a shaman. It should also be mentioned that Gatschet (1891: 67)
asserted that cremation was out of the question in the Trespalacios Bay area because of the absence of
a suitable fuel. This, however, appears to have been a deduction on his part (a reasonable one on the
face of it) combined with a lack of mention of this act by his principal informant, Mrs. Oliver. Also, in
text material collected by Gatschet from Atakapa informants in Lake Charles, Louisiana in 1885, there
is a brief description of an Atakapa burial ceremony which includes the statement that they "... never
burned the dead" (Gatschet and Swanton 1932: 20). This too was quite a late period to collect
information, the Atakapa having been essentially non-existent for many years as of 1885, and among
other things, this statement could reflect a degree of Christian influence.
The isolated surface disposals present somewhat different problems. First, only three are known,
all of which occurred quite early. Two of these were infants, one an adult; and the two age groups may
present us with quite different sets of possibilities. The principal options explaining the two infant
phalanges at 41 HR 85 are natural deaths and infanticide. There is only one ethnohistoric account
of infanticide. This was the report by Cabeza de Vaca of infanticide among the Mariames and
Yguaces, groups of uncertain affiliation but possibly Karankawa (Covey 1961). According to Cabeza,
these were the only groups in the area to have such a practice. We are, however, describing
prehistoric events occurring more than a thousand years earlier in the Clear Lake Period. For that time
there are no known infant burials and, consequently, it may be that all deceased infants were
abandoned on the surface of the ground. Should a contemporaneous pattern of infant burial be
discovered in the future, we would suggest that the surface disposed infants are likely to be females
because this age/sex category would have been unable, at such an early age, to acquire status in a
male centered egalitarian society. It is not yet possible to determine if there is any significance to the
absence of data on similar surface abandoned infant remains in later time periods.
The apparent surface abandoned adult dating to some time in the Mayes Island-Turtle Bay
periods discovered at the Galena Midden probably poses a different situation. In our previous
description of these remains we alluded to some conceivable explanations. On the other hand, in light
of our argument that for every subsurface interment there is likely to be a non-interment body disposal,
then we should expect to coincidentally encounter evidence as we have here from time to time.
What then does our evidence indicate of criteria for selection of burial place and basic mode of
disposal? We can say very little about the earliest known burials in the pre-cemetery period. These
appear to be isolated interments of adults with a more or less formalized ritual, and surface
abandonment of deceased infants at or near the habitation site and either surface abandonment or
some form of interment of those dying away from the main habitation site.
Beginning with the appearance of cemeteries, infant burials are known. We may suggest, further,
that entry into a burial aggregate for infants and very young children in what appears to have been a
male-centered society may have been predicated on sex, with male infants being buried in the
aggregate and females abandoned on the ground surface. Interment of adolescents and adults,
however, may have been predicated more upon location of death and perhaps on the cause of death.
We have noted the absence of conclusive evidence for secondary burial upon which to suggest
transport of the body from some distant place. Nor is there any skeletal or artifactual evidence from
any of our known burials of violent death. On the positive side, we do see considerable variety in
statuses represented in the cemeteries. Consequently, it appears that entry into the burial aggregate
for adolescents and adults was conditioned primarily upon death at or near the main habitation site
and perhaps upon a non-violent cause.

102

HARRIS COUNTY BOYS SCHOOL

The circumstances leading to the isolated interments appear to be essentially the same as for the
aggregates although no isolated infant or juvenile interments are presently known. The composition
and formal aspects of the adult and adolescent isolated burials do parallel those of the aggregates
although, as a group, they show somewhat more variability in attributes. This isolated character of
burial probably was due primarily to death during a more transient portion of the annual round when
the group traveling together was smaller in size than during more settled periods. This greater mobility
probably served to spread the interments over more locations.
For those individuals who died while away from either type of habitation site (i.e., base camp or
transient camp) while on hunting, foraging, raiding, or other types of trips, we can only speculate as to
their final treatment. We cannot say these were uniformly not buried in some fashion as we have no
evidence by which to exclude this possibility. We may have limited evidence, though, for surface
abandonment under some circumstances in the human bone fragments from the Galena Midden which
we have interpreted as remains of a surface abandoned body. In support of at least the reasonableness
of this interpretation we note that Yarrow (1881: 103) reported "If a Caddo is killed in battle, the body
is never buried, but is left to be devoured by beasts or birds of prey, and the condition of such
individuals in the other world is considered to be far better than that of persons dying a natural
death". And finally, we also note the remarks by Simars de Bellisle that the group of Akokisa with
which he was hunting caught and killed an individual from another group (the Tojals) and evidently the
body was left lying on the ground (Folmer 1940: 219).
Statuses symbolized in mortuary ritual. It is difficult when dealing with societies we know so
poorly as those of the Galveston Bay area, to categorize the referents of mortuary ritual symbolism in
terms of their respective cultural subsystems. Some, such as body orientation, we probably can
recognize as being related to ideological rituals for social control in a cybernetic sense (cf., Wallace
1966: 126). The shaman presents a more complicated situation in that his existence is heavily rooted in
religious experience but his ordinary interaction with other members of the society was as a healer,
which activity had a decidedly more secular dimension. Some symbols have more immediately
recognizable secular referents as with the apparent tool kits found in some cemeteries. Others, such as
most body position features, are difficult to categorize and we shall not attempt to do so.
HEADMAN. Most ethnographic or ethnohistoric accounts of the Karankawa and Atakapa make
some reference to chiefs or headmen (e.g., Dyer 1917: 3; Gatschet 1891: 63); one source even speaks of
there being, among the Atakapa, "... many chiefs, one being the head of all the rest" (Gatschet and
Swanton 1932: 11). On the basis of this documentation it is probably safe to assume such a figure
existed, but we are presently unable to recognize the remains of any headman in our data with
certainty if, indeed, one is present. We assume this status would be indicated by associated grave
goods although we are unsure of just what kind. The only burial reported here that is in any way
unique in this respect is Burial 2 from the Boys School Cemetery. Of significance here is the range of
associated grave goods; items of personal adornment, implements, personal goods and red ochre are
all present. The implements include fishing, weaving or basketry tools (which may relate to the fishing
activity), and possibly flint knapping tools. Personal goods include bone flageolets, bone dice, an
apparent non-bone (gourd?) rattle, and the apparently non-utilitarian, end-notched stone fragment.
Winters (1969) has recently .reviewed the eastern U.S. literature for rattles and flageolets and we have
drawn on his conclusions to some extent. Winters (1969: 73-74, 78) observed that gourd rattles (as
opposed to the turtle shell rattles) were primarily employed in social dances and amusements of a
secular nature. The turtle shell rattles, on the contrary, were personal ceremonial equipment used
more in ceremonies of a sacred nature. Flageolets present a more equivocal picture.
Although in the East they tended to be associated with secular functions, there is some evidence of
the use of bone flageolets by shamans in medicine bundles. Also, the broken, worn, end-notched stone,
an artifact found in central Texas but normally not on the coast, may have had magical significance.
Non-functional items have been recovered with some other burials; for example, the modified Scotch
Bonnet shell with Burial 16 and possibly the Busycon pendant found perhaps inserted into a pouch or

GALVESTON BAY MORTUARY PRACTICES

lO3

wallet at the waist of Burial 4 at the Boys School Cemetery; and the stack of Dinocardium and Dosinia
shells over a femur of Burial K at Jamaica Beach. Perhaps these were charms of magical significance
to the owner that might be found with an adult from time to time as well as with shamans. We are thus
left with several possibilities. One is that the presence of the bone flageolets and possible charm
objects may indicate Burial 2 was a shaman. The fact that shamans may have been cremated in the
historic period is no sufficient reason for presuming this to have been the case a thousand years
earlier. Another possibility, in view of the great difference in the grave good assemblage between
Burial 2 and any other burial now known, is that this was not a local or indigenous person, but rather,
a transient who had accumulated substantial personal property in some other social or value system.
If, however, we consider the possibility that the headman may have possessed more personal property
than other members of the group, and that these goods would reflect skills in the many aspects of
acquiring food as well as secular ceremonial activities, then perhaps Burial 2 at Boys School is our
only example of a "headman".
Bearing on the historical significance of this interpretation, are the facts that we have
documented a substantial decline through time in the proportion of burials with grave goods (Table 15)
and that Dyer (1916: I) has noted, "The Coshuttas were the only ones near Galveston who made
offerings to the dead . . .". Thus it may be, Gatschet and Swanton (1932: 19) notwithstanding, that
grave accompaniments continued to disappear in the historic period. This obviously would affect the
criteria by which headmen could be recognized in the archeological burial situation.
SHAMAN. The existence of a status of shaman or "medicine man" among Galveston Bay area
protohistoric and historic societies is also a well documented fact (Covey 1961; Dyer 1916, 1917;
Gatschet 1891; Gatschet and Swanton 1932). Since the only reference to the role of these individuals
seems to be that of healer (Dyer 1917; Gatschet 1891: 69), it is necessary to briefly review the nature of
shamanism before proceeding.
A shaman is an individual who, as a result of some extraordinary experience, is presumed by
other group members either to have the ability or the power to intervene in the realm of the
supernatural (Norbeck 1961: 101-106; Wallace 1966: 86). As Wallace has noted (1966: 126), shamans
have power, in principle, to deal with any magico-religious problem, but ordinarily confine themselves
to diagnosing and healing illnesses for which services some form of remuneration is usually received.
Recruitment of shamans may come about in diverse ways; the most prominent is that of undergoing a
dramatic mystical experience (Norbeck 1961: 105; Wallace 1966: 126). Wallace (1966: 206-207)
emphasizes the genesis of a shaman as often involving severe mental illness for which the society’s
ritual treatment may, if successful, at least bring the victim through in a self-sustaining and socially
productive condition. Although such rituals "... can hardly be said to prevent or cure hysteria,
depression, epilepsy, or other emotional and neurological ills, they may provide a program for the
course of the condition that will render it predictable, acceptable, and even useful to both the victim
and his community" (Wallace 1966: 207). Norbeck (1961: 105) goes on to list other ways the call to
become a shaman may take place; some are: recovery from a near-fatal illness or accident; unusual
physical characteristics; participation in unusual events such as being born a twin, by breach birth, or
during a thunderstorm. In this connection, it may be significant to note that, according to Dyer (1917:
6), Atakapa dying from snakebite were believed to have been prevented thereby from enjoying an
afterlife, but rather were "... eternally damned." If this was the case, it is not inconceivable that a
snakebitten person who did not die might, as Norbeck indicates, be viewed as quite a special person in
communication with the supernatural and thus a shaman candidate.
The value of this review is that it aids somewhat in placing the reported cremation of shamans in a
more clear perspective. While the only thing most shamans might do for any other member of a group
would be to cure an illness, they were, nevertheless considered to have the power to communicate with
supernatural entities for purposes that might not always be beneficient. Consequently, a cremation
mortuary ritual for shamans that would prevent them from making the journey to the west and to the
afterlife along with "normal" persons might prove quite a rational approach to an Atakapa.

Parenthetically, this might also explain the discovery of cremations of two juveniles at the Jones Hill
Site in nearby Livingston Reservoir (McClurkan 1968: 9), but until better archeological documentation
is available we cannot be certain of the longer term history of shaman cremation in the Galveston Bay
area.
CRAFT SKILL STATUSES. Occasionally graves are found containing apparent age and sex-linked
tool kits. At Boys School, two adult male burials contain flint knapping tools, two adult male burials
contain awls presumably related to basketry and/or possibly net or other textile weaving, and one
adult male burial contains implements associated with fishing. At Caplen Cemetery, two females (one
an adult, the other an adolescent) were found associated with implements and materials for making
shell beads. From Jamaica Beach, one adult female’s grave contained a bone awl and bone pins which
have not been adequately described and consequently we cannot be certain of their functional
association. Of possible but unclear significance here is that implements reflecting craft skills are
known only from the cemeteries; not from isolated burials. Also, we note that the early craft indicators
(at Boys School) are associated with male burials while the later ones (at Caplen and Jamaica Beach)
are associated with females.
RELIGIOUS STATUSES. As previously indicated, the shaman status has strong religious aspects
but that status has been considered separately. Of principal importance for consideration at this time
are body orientation and use of red ochre. Ethnographic accounts of American Indians in the
southeastern U.S. frequently contain references to prescriptions for body orientation and the
underlying cultural rationale. As a more or less typical example, Chickasaw legend defined a former
home to the west beyond the Mississippi River. Once the soul of a deceased person was prompted to
leave the place of death, it traveled westward, passed under the sky and proceeded upward to the land
of The One Above, or the Breath Holder (Swanton 1928: 174, 256). To facilitate this journey, in
mortuary ritual the head "... was always placed toward the west, for otherwise it was thought the
soul would lose its way" (Swanton 1928: 233).
The early 18th Century report of Espinosa described the belief of the Caddo that when the soul
leaves the deceased, it travels toward the west (Swanton 1942: 204). In describing a memorial
ceremony for those dying away from home or in war, a portion of the ritual provides that, "About seven
men leave the house, turn their faces toward the east and say their prayers"; subsequent to this,
ground corn is scattered to the "four winds" (Swanton 1942: 204). Most Caddo informants described
the interred body as having to be placed with the head to the west, thus "facing" the rising sun.
We have few such ethnographic references for natives of the Galveston Bay area. We do know,
however, that the Western Atakapa "... prayed standing to One-Above. They danced the sacred
dance to One-Above" (Gatschet and Swanton 1932: 11), a religious practice similar to that previously
described for the Chickasaw. Also, Gatschet (1891: 71) describes as religious acts, at least two habits
of the Karankawa relating to cardinal and solar directions. In one, individuals would blow smoke
through their nostrils to the north, east, south, and west, a practice reminiscent of the previously
described Caddo ceremony of casting ground corn to the "four winds". In the other, individuals often
were observed staring at the sun as it set "into the sea", a practice Gatschet says was common to the
Creeks and is reminiscent of the previously mentioned Caddo habit of turning to the east to say their
prayers.
The data is minimal, but is sufficient to demonstrate a common ascription of religious significance
to body orientation and related mortuary rituals among the Atakapa and Karankawa and other
cultures in the southeastern U.S. We do not insist that these rituals have the same significance in the
Galveston Bay area as they do for other cultures in the Southeast, but we do feel safe in the assumption
that burial orientation is not a casual, unpatterned feature but one that is structured, probably in
reference to solar positions, and whose significance derives from the native cosmos.
It is interesting to note that Swanton (1942: 210) indicated his belief that the practice of burying
with head to the west (and, therefore, facing east) was a feature reflective of Christian influence on
native cultures. The data in Table 16, however, indicates the shift from "head to east" around to

GALVESTON BAY MORTUARY PRACTICES

lO5

"head to west" in the Galveston Bay area was gradual and had begun a thousand years before the time
of Cabeza de Vaca.
Binford (1971) developed the argument that body orientation was utilized in mortuary ritual most
often to symbolize the social affiliation of the deceased, and secondarily the sex of the deceased. We
have no data indicating a correlation between body orientation and sex in the Galveston Bay area
although our data on sex is not especially good. The data on orientation does, however, reflect a
gradual but nearly total reversal in body direction during the roughly 1300 years between the Clear
Lake Period burials and those of the Jamaica Beach Site. Such a change would appear likely to reflect
changing concepts of the afterlife, but since these different orientations existed concurrently they may
be symbolic of the deceased’s former membership in one or the other of two sodalities. Evidently,
membership in such a special purpose, non-residential group was either not extended to the entire
population or on occasion, aspects of mortuary ritual were withheld from the deceased, since burials
occasionally were oriented virtually to the north or south. Perhaps this signified individuals precluded
from the preferred afterlife because of special circumstances, of which the previously mentioned
implications of dying from snakebite may be one. Possibly includable here also would be those adult
individuals who may have been killed in war and abandoned where they died (if this feature did indeed
exist), and those newborn infants (females?) who were cast out to die or be killed.
Finally, we should discuss the occurrence of red ochre. Winters (1969: 79) notes that abundant
evidence for the ceremonial use of ochre exists although a systematic survey has evidently never been
conducted. He has proposed that in the Indian Knoll Culture, the use of red ochre was determined by
"... certain unknown physical conditions at the time of death of the individual, mediated by variables
of sex, age, status, and role" (Winters 1969: 82). While discrete placement of ochre within the grave
tends to characterize its use in Galveston Bay area burials also, a more pertinent observation here may
be that nearly 70% (i.e., 9 out of 13) of the red ochre burials are west pointing and only 15% are east
pointing. This reinforces the possibility that sodality affiliation is the principal referent of both red
ochre and body orientation, and that these sodalities relate to primitive religious belief.
ECOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE MORTUARY DATA
Up to this point we have discussed the synchronic and diachronic prehistoric patterns of mortuary
ritual symbols in the Galveston Bay area, and have then attempted to determine the referents of many
of these symbols. The results of this analysis generally have been supportive of two major hypotheses
put forward by Binford. The first of these hypotheses proposes that a positive correlation exists
between the appearance of cemeteries (i.e., burial aggregates) and the appearance of energy
harnessing tools in a society (Binford 1968: 272-273). The second hypothesis, which is closely related to
the first, is that the place and complexity of mortuary rituals will vary "... directly with the number of
duty-status relationships obtaining between the deceased and other members of the community..."
(Binford 1971: 21). While the field data reported here were not collected with testing of these
hypotheses in mind, the Galveston Bay area situation does not at this time appear to contradict them.
Furthermore, we have proposed, in the form of our interpretations, numerous new hypotheses about
various burial modes and the symbolic referents of several components of mortuary ritual, most of
which are readily susceptible to verification as new burial sites are discovered.
Binford (1971) has forcefully argued that direct comparison of mortuary trait frequencies is
unproductive because of the difficulty in cross-culturally controlling the referent of any given burial
symbol. In this sense we are at a considerable disadvantage when trying to compare the Galveston Bay
area mortuary system to those of neighboring cultures located to the north, east, and west because of
the absence of any similar referential investigation. As far as presently can be determined, the
mortuary practices of other societies along the upper Texas coastal zone (and in the immediately
adjacent inland areas) are more or less of the same character and complexity as those of the Galveston
Bay area; i.e., they reflect the status network of mobile, egalitarian hunter-gatherer societies. Farther
to the north and west, however, significant contrasts are evident, the most obvious of which is the

106

HARRIS COUNTY BOYS SCHOOL

evidence for ranked societies in the Caddo area and their attendant more elaborate mortuary rituals.
This evidence, however, is generally known and will not be discussed further here.
Before concluding this present study, though, we should at least examine one other type of
information to which our mortuary data relates and which became better focused subsequent to
discussions with Elton Prewitt who is currently studying mortuary practices in the Brazos Valley. The
principal initial observation is quite simple: while unequivocal evidence of violent death is fairly
frequent in mortuary sites of the inland portion of the Brazos Valley, it is totally absent in the
Galveston Bay area. Moreover, the Brazos Valley mortuary data contains evidence very suggestive of
redistribution systems and of the so-called "big man" syndrome with its attendant seeking of prestige
and status (E. Prewitt, personal communication). This evidence is being readied for publication by
Prewitt but what is important for us is that such a mortuary pattern and status network constitutes the
very antithesis of the pattern in the Galveston Bay area. Thus it is advisable to go back and re-examine
some of our data for the significance of this difference in the light of a larger cultural setting.
It has long been argued that systematic infanticide (usually biased toward females) was a
commonly used device for population control among hunter-gatherer societies (e.g., Birdsell 1968) and
consequently, the ratio of males to females is an important parameter to be examined in mortuary
studies. Howells (1960} argued that this imbalance of infant skeletal remains in the archeological
record may be due to preservation difficulties or to other variables. A thorough, logical analysis of
some of these variables has recently been made which had as one conclusion that systematic
infanticide among hunter-gatherers was atypical as a population control measure (Denham 1974).
However, in another recent analysis, Divale (1972) specifically sought out mechanisms for
population control through examination of the correlation between demographic and cultural
variables. He proposed that systemic population control among hunter-gatherers involved
¯.. female infanticide which regulates the excess females and produces a shortage of adult
women. Because of their scarcity, conflicts over women are the cause of most primitive
warfare through which the excess males are regulated (Divale 1972: 242).
Cross-cultural testing of this hypothesis, controlled for Galton’s problem, apparently was
confirmative in regard to the demographic correlations, but such analysis does not conclusively
demonstrate causal relationships.
Harris (1974: 79-80) has pointed out that higher ratios of men to women in hunter-gatherer
societies means more protein per capita as well as a slower rate of population growth. This, then, has
substantial adaptive implications especially in those areas where populations live close to
environmental carrying capacity. As an illustration of this, Harris (1974: 99) re-examined the
circumstances of Yanomamo warfare wherein the shortage of women and a variety of other associated
factors have usually been interpreted as pointing to sex as a basis for conflict much as is stated above
in Divale’s hypothesis. But, as Harris notes, the problem with basing an explanation of warfare (or
raiding, or feuding) on attempts to redress the imbalance of women is that this problem is
artificial--the Yanomamo and other societies create it themselves. In consideration of this, Harris
argues that one of the key factors behind Yanomamo warfare is not simply the seeking of mates, but the
functional or adaptive significance of female infanticide as a means of coping with carrying capacity
limitations. Divale (1972: 231) reasoned that if the function of female infanticide and warfare was to
control population growth, "... it may be deduced that the system developed when it was no longer
possible for human groups to continuously expand into uninhabited territories." Whether or not such
was the case, it would seem that this practice, to be adaptive, would have been a response to some
constraining environmental factor. Consequently, a better expression of the role of infanticide might
be made, via Leibig’s Law of the Minimum, in terms of the most severe environmental limitation with
respect to subsistence. We are presently unable to quantify this limitation or to state its technological
correlates in the Texas coastal zone but this certainly is an investigation that should be approached in
the future.

GALVESTON BAY MORTUARY PRACTICES

Thai infanticide as an adaptive pattern may have existed on the Texas qoast is hinted at both by
the Clear Lake Period archeological data and by ethnohistoric documentation of the Mariames and
Yguace (Covey 1961) which has been mentioned several times. Although we cannot be very certain of
the reliability of the adult sex ratios in the archeological data reported here, these are: for the Mayes
Island-Turtle Bay isolated burials, a ratio (males to females) of 133:100; for the Boys School Cemetery,
160:100; for the Caplen Cemetery, 54:100; and for Jamaica Beach there is a ratio of 100:100. There are
no available data for the Clear Lake Period burials and we are strongly inclined to believe the Caplen
data have been heavily biased because of the large number of skeletons that were discarded. Despite
this, the existing Galveston Bay area data suggests a shift through time toward more equal
representation of the sexes. While this shift might reflect a change in the status of women in
prehistoric society, this does not seem too likely in view of the facts that women always were in the
cemeteries and that there are no other strong indicators of change in sex-oriented status symbols
(although there was the apparent increase in gross association of grave goods with females at Jamaica
Beach). It may be that we are seeing an evolutionary development from precariously adapted bands
(that utilized female infanticide as one adaptive mechanism) in the Clear Lake Period to more securely
adapted bands by the Old River Period in which sex ratios could be maintained in a more natural
balance. In this regard, the Mariames and Yguace may have been reflective of the more precarious
situation persisting in a much tess ecologically diverse portion of the coastal plain.
What then may have stimulated such a change in adaptive efficiency? It is not possible, at this
point, to preclude environmental changes as directly having influenced this shift although no data
collected thus far indicates that any significant unidirectional developments took place during the time
period being discussed. It is entirely possible, however, that the previously described technological
innovations which took place around 500-600 A.D. did stimulate a long-term development in the
efficiency of the subsistence economy which ultimately was manifested in changes in systemic
population growth control measures which obviated the necessity to create an excess of males in the
social group as a means for maintaining a suitable nutritional input per capita.
It would appear, then, that alternative means of adaptation were employed wherein the bands of
the Galveston Bay area undertook adaptation primarily through technological innovation while the
societies of the inland Brazos Valley undertook adaptation primarily through sociological innovations.
The nature of the difference between these two approaches may lie in the degree of economic
improvement required for survival in the two areas. The Galveston Bay area formerly contained quite
a diverse and productive set of natural habitats, a setting almost certainly more productive than those
of the Brazos Valley per unit area, although we have not attempted to measure this difference. One
important element for further understanding of this adaptation process involves a detailed
examination of the evolution of Galveston Bay area subsistence and a very large body of data has been
acquired on this subject which is currently undergoing analysis.

RETROSPECT
We have touched on a number of diverse yet related topics in this report and each has been fairly
well summarized at its place; consequently, these will not be repeated in a summary section. It is
useful, though, to look back at what has been covered so as to make some suggestions for the future.
A wide range of interpretations and suggested relationships have been given, some based on
reasonably good data while others amount to sheer speculation. All, however, point in a plausible
direction for researching information on the organizational development and adaptation of aboriginal
bands in the Galveston Bay area. Most of these interpretations can readily be tested by new data
collection so long as investigators take care to assure that appropriate data both on burials and their
cultural context is collected.
Some, no doubt, will be disappointed at our failure to undertake extensive anthropometry on the
Boys School material. We did not desire to perform such measurements in advance of the definition of
anthropometric problems and in advance of identifying appropriate measurements that would bear on

108

HARRIS COUNTY BOYS SCHOOL

them. Moreover, there was not available suitable skeletal material from other Galveston Bay area sites
upon which to base a comparative investigation of anthropometrically based problems. On the other
hand, description of the human paleopathology was helpful. Obviously, individuals such as the
crippled adult-male (Burial 21) have significant and readily appreciable cultural implications as do
those with other pathologic conditions (cf., Stewart 1966), but we cannot make full use of such data
without comparative material from other local sites.
It is essential for future investigators of mortuary practices in the Galveston Bay area to be
cognizant of the wide range of information that is necessary to be documented at a burial site so that
mortuary data may be correctly understood. Chronological age of interment, the interment setting,
contemporaneous technological and settlement features, and, of course, full recording of the cultural,
demographic, and pathological aspects of the body and grave all need to be addressed. It should be
abundantly obvious by now that a very large part of our difficulties in this study stemmed from
deficiencies in field documentation; and the non-uniform nature of these deficiencies only served to
weaken analysis further.
A brief word is also in order regarding sampling. Any sampling program should be designed in
light of some knowledge of the dimensions of the universe to be sampled. Now, after having attempted a
thorough review of existing data, it appears that this is knowledge we do not yet have. Consequently,
we believe that the only sound approach to mortuary data, in the Galveston Bay area, is total recovery,
a point well-made by others (e.g., Heizer and Baumhoff 1956), but too often ignored. If a burial is
discovered, excavation must continue until it is determined either that the grave was an isolated one or
that it is part of an aggregate. If an aggregate has been encountered, it should either be fully
excavated, or else left preserved for complete investigation in the future. This has not been a problem
in the data analyzed in this report. So far as we are able to determine the isolated burials were in fact
isolated, and the aggregates were completely excavated, or very nearly so. The point is worth making,
however, because it is highly likely that burial sites will be encountered during future construction and
land development activities and that decisions for recovery of data will have to be made. A tragic loss
of some of our most revealing information sources about ancient societies will occur if traditional
archeological salvage sampling approaches are taken.
