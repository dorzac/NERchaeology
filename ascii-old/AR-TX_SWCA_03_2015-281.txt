ABSTRACT
On behalf of Brookfield Residential, SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted an intensive
cultural resources investigation of the proposed Easton Park Development Project in southeast Austin,
Travis County, Texas. The project involves the construction of a roughly 2.0-mile-long extension of
William Cannon Drive that ranges between 150 and 330 feet in width, and encompasses 71.3 acres. It would
begin at McKinney Falls Parkway and end at U.S. Route 183. The project also proposes to develop 230.7
acres adjacent to the roadway extension for residential use. The area of potential effects (APE) is defined
as the 2.0-mile corridor and the adjoining parcels, totaling 302 acres.
The proposed road right-of-way will eventually be controlled by Travis County, a political subdivision of
the State of Texas; therefore, compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas is necessary. Additionally, the
project must comply with application requirements for a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Ft. Worth District
Section 404 permit in accordance with 33 CFR Part 325, Appendix C (Processing Department of Army
Permits: Procedures for the Protection of Historic Properties; Final Rule 1990; with current Interim
Guidance Document dated June 24, 2002) and with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(16 USC 470), and its implementing regulations (36 CFR 800). Portions of the project within the 100-year
floodplain may also be subject to permitting by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and require
Section 106 compliance, as well.
The goal of the work was to locate all prehistoric and historic archaeological sites within the proposed APE,
establish vertical and horizontal site boundaries as appropriate, and evaluate the significance and eligibility
of any site recorded for inclusion to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or designation as a
State Antiquities Landmark (SAL). The investigations were initiated with a background review of previous
work, historic map review, and an archival review of the APE parcels. Field work involved an intensive
pedestrian survey with shovel testing of the APE. The background review determined that portions of the
APE have been previously surveyed and that two archaeological sites consisting of a prehistoric lithic
scatter (41TV2196) and a twentieth-century farmstead (41TV2366) are within the APE. Both sites were
recommended as not eligible for inclusion to the NRHP or designation as an SAL. Historic maps revealed
approximately 20 possible historic-age structures within or adjacent to the property, dating back to 1896.
While the archival review determined that property ownership for some of the APE parcels extends back
to the late-nineteenth century, no historically significant individuals or families owned the properties.
All field work was conducted March 10–20, 2014, during which time a total of 168 shovel tests were
systematically excavated across the APE. The intensive pedestrian field effort revealed that the proposed
APE is within a semi-rural setting that is quickly becoming more urbanized. The APE exhibits prior
modifications from residential and agricultural development and associated utility installations. The
investigations revisited sites 41TV2196 and 41TV2366, documented four new archaeological sites
(41TV2456–41TV2459), and encountered three isolated artifacts (IF01–IF03). The cultural resources that
were encountered are primarily associated with historic homestead and farmstead structures and activities
from the early- to mid-twentieth century. Based on a variety of factors, none of the archaeological sites
recorded or revisited during this survey are recommended for listing in the NRHP or as an SAL.
In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify cultural
resources within the APE. As no properties were identified that meet the criteria for listing in the NRHP,
according to 36 CFR 60.4, or for designation as an SAL, according to 13 TAC 26.12, SWCA recommends
no further cultural resources investigations are warranted within the project APE.

INTRODUCTION
On behalf of Brookfield Residential, SWCA
Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey of the proposed
Easton Park Development (EPD) Project in
southeast Austin, Travis County, Texas (Figure 1).
The EPD project would connect the existing portion
of East William Cannon Drive with U.S. Route 183
(US 183). The western terminus of the
approximately 2.0-mile roadway extension begins
at the intersection of East William Cannon Drive
and McKinney Falls Parkway. The alignment then
progresses in a southeastern direction for 2.0 miles
to its eastern terminus near the intersection of Farmto-Market (FM) 1625 and US 183. The width of the
right-of-way (ROW) varies throughout the project
area. Roughly 0.4 mile of the proposed new ROW
is 150 feet wide, while the remaining 1.6 miles is
330 feet wide, encompassing a total of about 71.3
acres.

The purpose of the work was to locate and identify
all prehistoric and historic archaeological sites in
the APE, establish vertical and horizontal site
boundaries as appropriate with regard to the APE,
and evaluate the significance and eligibility of any
site recorded within the APE for inclusion to the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), or for
designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL).
Matthew Stotts served as Project Archaeologist,
conducting survey investigations with Field
Technicians Mercedes Cody, Mary Noell, and
Krista Flores in March 2014.

PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION
The APE is situated in southern Travis County,
specifically southeast Austin, and in a semi-rural
setting surrounded by rolling, open pastures and
intermittent residential housing. The overall APE
slopes southeast dropping from 600 feet above
mean sea level (amsl) on the west end to 535 feet
amsl on the east end. The APE is bisected by
Cottonmouth Creek, a northward-flowing drainage
that empties into Onion Creek about 3.0 miles
downstream from the APE (see Figure 1). The APE
consists primarily of open pasture with scattered
oaks and various hardwoods, particularly along the
riparian corridor of Cottonmouth Creek. The
southern slope of the prominent Pilot Knob runs
through the center of the APE.

The parcels adjacent to the roadway extension are
also proposed for development, and encompass
about 230.7 acres. The depth of impacts are not
known at this time, but are expected not to exceed
5 feet below ground surface. The area of potential
effects (APE) is defined as the 2.0-mile-long
corridor and adjoining parcels, totaling 302 acres.
The intensive cultural resources survey conducted
by SWCA included a background literature review
and a 100 percent pedestrian inspection with shovel
testing in accordance with the guidelines provided
in Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act (NHPA) (16 USC 470), and its implementing
regulations (36 CFR 800) and the Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines. All work
conducted within the APE was done in compliance
with the Antiquities Code of Texas under Permit
No. 6810, with Ken Lawrence as Principal
Investigator. The 46-acre 100-year floodplain was
surveyed in accordance with Section 106 of the
NHPA, in anticipation of possible permitting
requirements by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA), and as part of the
sponsor's
compliance
with
application
requirements for a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers

Known disturbances within the APE include
vegetation clearing, residential and agricultural
activities, and the construction and maintenance of
numerous two-track roadways. Other notable
disturbances that are evident along the margins of
the APE on adjacent properties include, grading and
clearing activities, utility installations (overhead
and subsurface), and residential construction.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

(NRCS 2014). Finally, Eddy gravelly loam (3–6
percent slopes) comprises a small portion of the
western end of the APE. It is characterized as
shallow to very shallow, well-drained soils that
originated from chalky limestone and typically
occupies gently sloping to steep upland areas
(NRCS 2014).

Geology and Soils
Geologically, the overwhelming majority of the
APE is mapped as Upper Cretaceous-aged Igneous
rocks (Ki) a formation localized to Pilot Knob
(Barnes 1995). These deposits are described as
nontronite and basalt intruded into the pyroclastics
(i.e., volcanic materials) of extinct Pilot Knob
volcano (Barnes 1995). Notably, portions of the
APE are situated along the southern slopes of the
prominent Pilot Knob, which is a complex of small,
rounded hills derived from the core of the extinct
volcano that was buried in shallow sea deposits of
clay and marl (Spearing 1991:65). A small portion
near the southeastern edge of the APE is mapped as
Upper Cretaceous-aged clay of the Ozan Formation
(Ko) that is characterized as light-gray-to-brown
clay and marl with variable amounts of quartz and
calcite fragments (Barnes 1995).

Vegetation
The APE is situated along the margin of the
Edwards Plateau and the Blackland Prairie regions
(Everitt et al. 2002; Kutac and Caran 1994). The
Edwards Plateau forms a sharp boundary in floral
distribution between the thin-soiled limestone
uplands and the wide coastal plains. Upland areas
are dominated by a mixed live oak (Quercus
virginiana) and Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei)
woodland interspersed with occasional grassy
openings. Other tree species present in low
densities throughout these areas include cedar elm
(Ulmus crassifolia) and Texas oak (Quercus
fusiformis). Shrub density varies between low to
dense in upland areas. Species occurring in low
densities include Texas persimmon (Diospyros
texana), agarita (Berberis trifoliolata), and prickly
pear (Opuntia spp.) with thick, mixed grasses in
areas (Van Auken 1988). Originally, the uplands of
the Edwards Plateau sustained short grasses and the
alluvial valleys had deciduous forests (Black
1989:12). The lower elevation areas along the
riparian zone often include a dense understory of
acacia (Acacia spp.), prickly pear, and other brushy
species (Petrides 1988; Simpson 1988).

There are five soil units mapped within the APE
that, in order of prevalence, include Behring clay,
Houston black clay, Tinn clay, Heiden gravelly
clay, and Eddy gravelly loam (NRCS 2014).
Behring clay (1–5 percent slopes) is mapped in
most of the open pasture areas east and west of
Cottonmouth Creek and is characterized as deep
permeable soils derived from shale, and situated on
nearly level to sloping erosional uplands (NRCS
2014).
Houston black clay (0–5 percent slopes) is located
at the southeastern end of the APE near US 183 and
is described as very deep, permeable soil derived
from Cretaceous-aged calcareous clays and marls
that occupies nearly level to sloping uplands
(NRCS 2014). The frequently flooded Tinn clay (0–
1 percent slopes) soils correspond with
Cottonmouth Creek and are characterized as very
deep, well-drained, permeable soils formed in
calcareous clayey alluvium. They are situated on
floodplains of streams and drainages of the
Blackland Prairie (NRCS 2014).

Faunal
Two biotic provinces divide Travis County (Blair
1950). The western portions of Travis County lie
within the Balconian biotic province that comprises
the Edwards Plateau region (Blair 1950). The
eastern portions of the county are within the Texan
biotic province, which extends from central Texas
to east-central Oklahoma (Blair 1950). The APE is
situated within the eastern half of Travis County at
the western edge of the Texan biotic province.

Heiden gravelly clay (8–20 percent slopes) is
mapped in the portion of the APE closest to Pilot
Knob and is described as slowly permeable, welldrained, and deep soils derived from weathered
shale and situated on moderately steep uplands

The Balconian and Texan biotic provinces are
transitional zones from the mesic forests of eastern
North America to the xeric grasslands of the central
United States. These provinces have a high faunal

3

diversity. Blair (1950) identified at least 49 species
of mammals, 57 species of reptiles, and 23 species
of amphibians native to the Texan biotic province.
The Balconian contains 57 species of mammal,
over 42 species of reptile, and 15 species of
amphibians (Blair 1950). None of the fauna for the
Balconian is restricted solely to this province (Blair
1950).

The following cultural-historic outline is based on
the regional chronologies proposed by Collins
(1995) and Johnson and Goode (1994), which build
upon the seminal efforts of Suhm (1960) and
Prewitt (1981, 1985). Using standard terminology,
the cultural sequence is divided into four periods:
Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and
Historic. The Archaic period is subdivided into four
subperiods: Early, Middle, Late, and Transitional.

Some native mammals common to the Texan biotic
province include: opossum (Didelphis virginiana),
eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus), eastern fox
squirrel (Sciurus niger), pocket gopher (Geomys
breviceps),
fulvous
harvest
mouse
(Reithrodontomys fulvescens), white-footed mouse
(Peromyscus leucopus), hispid cotton rat
(Sigmodon hispidus), eastern cottontail rabbit
(Sylvilagus floridanus), swamp rabbit (Sylvilagus
aquaticus) (Burt and Grossenheider 1976).

Paleoindian Period
Paleoindian artifacts and sites date from about
11,500 to 8800 years before present (B.P.) and are
not uncommon in Central Texas (Collins 1995,
2004), but are fairly rare in the APE (Bever and
Meltzer 2007). The period begins at the close of the
Pleistocene with the earliest evidence of humans in
the Central Texas region. Diagnostic artifacts of the
period include lanceolate-shaped, fluted projectile
points such as Clovis, Folsom, and Plainview types.
These projectile points were hafted onto wooden
spears, launched from atlatls (spear throwers), and
used to hunt a variety of game, including mammoth,
mastodons, bison, camel, and horse (Black 1989).
During the Paleoindian period, the prominent
interpretation suggests a hunter-gatherer adaptation
strategy with increased harvesting of flora and
small game as the big game died off and the climate
warmed following the end of the Pleistocene ice
age. Representative Central Texas Paleoindian sites
include Kincaid Rockshelter, Wilson-Leonard,
Gault, and St. Mary’s Hall (Collins 1995).

Mammals common to both of these provinces
include coyote (Canis latrans), gray fox (Urocyon
cinereoargenteus), mink (Mustela vison), muskrat
(Ondata zibethica), raccoon (Procyon lotor),
striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), and white-tailed
deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Historically, red
wolf, bison and black bear ranged into or near these
regions (Burt and Grossenheider 1976; Davis and
Schmidly 1994; Schmidly 1983).
The general reptilian assemblage for both provinces
include the Great Plains rat snake (Elaphe guttata
emoryi), Eastern yellowbelly racer (Coluber
constrictor flaviventris), Yellow mud turtle
(Kinosternon flavescan flavescan), bullfrog (Rana
catesbiana), southern leopard frog (Rana
utricularia), and the gulf coast toad (Bufo
vallicepus) (Blair 1950; Conant and Collins 1998;
Kutac and Caran 1994; Werler and Dixon 2004).

Archaic Period
As the Paleoindian period came to an end, humans
began to harvest more intensively local floral and
faunal resources (Collins 1995, 2004). Material
culture became more diverse and the use of burned
rock middens and ovens became widespread. This
period is known as the Archaic period and dates
from approximately 8800 to 1200 B.P. in Central
Texas (Collins 1995; Johnson and Goode 1994).
While Collins (1995) and Johnson and Goode
(1994) subdivide the Archaic into Early, Middle,
and Late subperiods, we have added the
Transitional subperiod after the Late Archaic for
reasons discussed below.

CULTURAL SETTING
Situated in southern Travis County, the APE lies
within the Central Texas archaeological region, as
defined by Collins (1995) and Prewitt (1981). This
area is noted by its distinctive environmental
conditions, as it is located at the boundary of the
moist, humid forests to the east and drier, savannahlike grasslands to the west that greatly influenced
cultural development.

4

Early Archaic

include the Landslide, Wounded Eye, Gibson, and
Panther Springs (Collins 1995).

Early Archaic artifacts and sites date from about
8800 to 6000 B.P. (Collins 1995). Once thought to
be Paleoindian in age, some unstemmed point
types, such as Angostura, have recently been
recognized as the first Early Archaic diagnostic
styles (Collins 1995). By about 8000 B.P., these
points were replaced by stemmed varieties such as
Early Split Stem, Martindale, and Uvalde (Black
1989; Collins 1995). Most sites were open
campsites although cave sites have been found
(Collins 1995). Current site distribution data
suggest that Early Archaic peoples were
concentrated along the eastern and southern
margins of the Edwards Plateau in areas with more
stable water sources (Collins 1995; McKinney
1981). Specialized tools, perhaps used in
woodworking, known as Guadalupe and Nueces
bifaces, were prevalent in this period (Collins
1995). While subsistence data are sparse, it appears
that people hunted deer and other small animals,
fished, and cooked bulbs in earth ovens (Collins
1995). This strategy evolved, in part, due to the
changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene
(McKinney 1981).

Late Archaic
Late Archaic artifacts and sites date from about
4000 to 2250 B.P. The period began with very xeric
conditions but gradually became more mesic
(Collins 1995). Characteristic dart point types
include Bulverde, Pedernales, Marshall, and
Marcos (Collins 1995). Increasingly complex and
sedentary cultural manifestations first appeared in
the Late Archaic. Sites of the Late Archaic are very
common and include burned rock middens, open
campsites, and lithic procurement sites. Population
increases are evidenced by large cemeteries and
grave goods. Also, trade and exchange networks
between cultures appear to have increased in
complexity as evidenced by exotic goods in sites
and cemeteries (Black 1989). Bement (1991)
interprets the evidence for group investment in
territory due to evidence in the Thunder Valley
sinkhole cemetery, dated to 2900 B.P. based on
stratigraphy, to indicate that groups were declaring
control over a particular territorial range during the
Late Archaic. Representative sites of the Central
Texas Late Archaic include the Anthon and Loeve
Fox sites (Collins 1995).

Middle Archaic

Transitional Archaic

Middle Archaic artifacts and sites date from about
6000 to 4000 B.P. with multi-use bifacial knives
becoming more common. Characteristic Middle
Archaic projectile points include Bell, Andice,
Taylor, Nolan, and Travis, several of which are
deeply notched (Black 1989). These artifacts could
have served as knives and projectile points. Bison
were hunted intensively at the start of the Middle
Archaic but, as the climate became drier, a reliance
on dry climate plants such as sotol probably became
common. The end of the Middle Archaic may have
been the most xeric conditions ever in Central
Texas (Collins 1995). The climatic change was
accompanied by a technological shift as Nolan and
Travis points, which are thick and have narrow
blades, first appeared in the archaeological record
(Collins 1995). Burned rock middens and earth
ovens first appeared ca. 5000 B.P. and became
increasingly common, although their exact
functions may have varied based on the culture and
environment (Johnson and Goode 1994).
Representative sites of the Texas Middle Archaic

As Collins (1995:384–385) notes, diverse and
comparatively
complex
archaeological
manifestations toward the end of the Late Archaic
attest to the emergence of kinds of human conduct
without precedent in the area. This period (2250–
1250 B.P.), referred to as the Transitional Archaic
(Turner and Hester 1999) or Terminal Archaic
(Black 1989), is not recognized by all researchers.
Other chronologies extend the Late Archaic to
1200–1250 B.P. (Collins 1995; Johnson and Goode
1994) to encompass this later subperiod. Johnson et
al. (1962) originally designated the Transitional
Archaic as a subperiod of the Archaic because of
the similarities between the latest dart point types
and the earliest arrow point types. Since then,
however, the designation has failed to be
universally accepted by researchers. In two
chronologies for Central Texas, Collins (1995) does
not include the Transitional as a subperiod of the
Archaic, and Johnson and Goode (1994) separate

5

the Late Archaic into two subperiods designated
Late Archaic I and Late Archaic II. The
Transitional Archaic, as it is used here, closely
corresponds to Johnson and Goode’s (1994) Late
Archaic II, but begins after the appearance of the
Marcos point type—not with it. In this scheme, the
Transitional Archaic coincides with the last two
style intervals recognized by Collins (1995:Table 2)
for the Late Archaic subperiod.

During the earlier Austin interval, use of burned
rock middens may have reached its maximum,
based on conclusions by Black and Creel (1997).
Characteristic arrow points of the Austin interval
include Scallorn and Edwards (Collins 1995;
Turner and Hester 1999). By the Toyah interval,
plain-ware ceramics appeared, indicating possible
influence in the Central Texas region from ceramic
producing cultures to the east and north (Perttula et
al. 1995). Contrary to bog pollen data (Collins et al.
1993), data from Hall’s Cave in Kerr County
indicate that the climate of Central Texas began to
dry around 1000 B.P. (Toomey et al. 1993). This
drying trend may have resulted in a change in
vegetation that made Central and South Texas more
conducive to bison migration into the area. Bison
remains in archaeological sites in the region
became common after 750 B.P. (Dillehay 1974;
Huebner 1991).

During the Transitional Archaic, smaller dart point
forms such as Darl, Ensor, Fairland, and Frio were
developed (Turner and Hester 1999). These points
were probably ancestral to the first Late Prehistoric
arrow point types and may have overlapped
temporally with them (Hester 1995; Houk and
Lohse 1993).
Several researchers believe that the increased
interaction between groups at the end of the Late
Archaic was an important catalyst for cultural
change (Collins 1995; Johnson and Goode 1994).
This change may have included increased regional
stress and conflict between groups as interaction
became more frequent (Houk et al. 1997). In Bexar
County, for instance, researchers noted a distinct
shift in settlement patterns during this period (Houk
et al. 1997). Groups apparently used hilltops as
camps rather than just lithic procurement locations.
These elevated locations would have provided
points from which to observe game and other
groups of humans as they moved through the
surrounding creek valleys and upland prairies
(Houk et al. 1997).

Most Toyah sites have the distinctive Perdiz arrow
point type, and some sites also have bison
processing tool kits. This technological change has
been interpreted by Johnson (1994) as a spread of
an ethnic group and by Ricklis (1992) as the spread
of technological ideas in response to opportunities
provided by increased bison populations in the Late
Prehistoric. It is thought that during the Late
Prehistoric period subsistence strategies became
increasing complex and that human populations
were very high (Black 1989; Collins 1995).
Representative sites of the Central Texas Late
Prehistoric include the Kyle, Smith, and Currie
Sites (Collins 1995).

Late Prehistoric Period

SPANISH COLONIAL/MEXICAN
INDEPENDENCE PERIOD (1630–1820S)

By the end of the Transitional Archaic, the bow and
arrow was introduced, as indicated by the
increasingly smaller size of projectile points. The
Late Prehistoric period dates from 1250 to 260 B.P.
(Collins 1995). Characteristic artifacts include
small arrow points such as Perdiz and Scallorn, as
well as a variety of specific-use tools. The Austin
and Toyah intervals of the Late Prehistoric,
originally recognized by Suhm (1960) and Jelks
(1962), remain accepted divisions for the period.
These style intervals may represent distinct cultural
entities (Johnson 1994), although others challenge
this view (Black and Creel 1997).

In the early Historic period (A.D. 1630 to present),
the period of European contact and settlement in
Texas, the general Austin area was inhabited by
several aboriginal groups including the Jumano,
Tonkawa, Lipan Apache and Comanche
(Newcomb 2002). The first Europeans into the area
were probably Spanish missionaries who
established three missions at nearby Barton Springs
in 1730 (Webb 1952). The Spanish mission period
in this area was of short duration and failed to
colonize or even tame the area south of the
Colorado River and north of Onion Creek. An

6

aboriginal presence thus continued in the Austin
area into the 1860s.

Lawlessness became a problem during the 1880s,
and Travis and Central Texas counties experienced
a period of “mob rule.” Citizens formed an antimob organization, but competing groups conducted
essentially open warfare. After several people were
killed, the Texas Rangers were dispatched to the
area and order was eventually restored (Murphy
2007).

After Mexico gained independence from Spain, the
newly formed country used a policy of land grants
to attract Anglos from the United States to help
inhabit the sparsely populated northern regions of
Mexico. During the 1820s, Stephen F. Austin
obtained grants from the Mexican government to
settle hundreds of families along the lower Brazos
and Colorado Rivers (Webb 1952). This colony,
known as the “Old Three Hundred Colony”, was
successful in pushing the European settlement
frontier further west into the Central Texas region.
Prior to the Texas Revolution, most of the “Old
Three Hundred Colony” settlement was focused
south of Bastrop and the old La Bahia Road (Webb
1952).

Recovery during this period was gradual, but was
assisted by a diverse agricultural economy
particularly cattle. In the 1870s, several major cattle
trails heading to markets passed through Central
Texas. One invention that had an effect on Texas
and its economy during this time was barbed wire.
Barbed wire, first demonstrated in 1871, enabled
ranchers to alter land and control cattle in a lessintrusive, more profitable manner, and brought
additional commerce and trade to central and South
Texas (NRHP 1976). Though barbed wire was one
of the largest influences on Texas in general, the
most influential ‘invention’ on the region was the
railroad. The railroads effectively served as a means
of transportation and, to varying degrees, generally
bolstered growth in the economies of the region.

REPUBLIC OF TEXAS/PRE-CIVIL WAR
(1836–1860)
During the Texas Revolution with Mexico, the area
continued to be inhabited only by aboriginal Native
Americans. After the war, a growing Texan
population led many settlers to move northwards in
search of open, profitable land to plant crops and
raise cattle. This wave of migration spurned new
conflicts with the native groups living in the area,
cumulating in the Battle of Brushy Creek, near what
is today the town of Taylor, in February of 1839.
This battle, between the Comanche and the Texas
Raiders, resulted in numerous deaths and
eventually resulted in the removal of the Native
American presence in the area.

Throughout the early twentieth century, trade,
transportation, and tourism continued to bring
economic prosperity to the region. The
establishment of military facilities and the activity
surrounding World War I and World War II kept
the railway system active and commercial activity
in the east prospered.
Through the remainder of the twentieth century,
population in Central Texas increased largely due
to expansion and commercial opportunities in urban
and rural areas. The construction of public
highways and automobiles facilitated the
commuting of Central Texas citizens to urban
employment.

THE POST–CIVIL WAR TO TWENTIETH
CENTURY (1865–1950)
Subsequent to the Civil War, Texas entered the
Reconstruction period. To begin reconstruction
federal troops, in part, had to spread the word of the
Emancipation Proclamation (Campbell 2003:268).
In Galveston on June 19, 1865, General Gordon
Granger and the Union army spread the word of the
slaves’ emancipation (Campbell 2003:268). Thus,
this day became known as ‘Juneteenth’ and has
been celebrated by Texas African Americans ever
since (Campbell 2003:268).

METHODS
BACKGROUND REVIEW
An SWCA archaeologist conducted a background
review and environmental literature search of the
APE to determine the locations and content of any
previous archaeological surveys and recorded
archaeological sites in or near the APE. The

7

investigation utilized the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) Texas Historic Sites Atlas
(Atlas). These sources provided information on the
nature and location of previously conducted
archaeological surveys, previously recorded
cultural resource sites, locations of NRHP districts
and properties, sites designated as SALs, Official
Texas Historical Markers, Recorded Texas Historic
Landmarks, cemeteries, and local neighborhood
surveys. However, the Atlas does not necessarily
list all previous work conducted within a specific
area. Previous cultural resources investigations
listed on the Atlas are limited to projects under
purview of the Antiquities Code of Texas or the
NHPA, as amended. In addition, projects under
these regulations may not be posted on Atlas due to
a delay between the completion of field work and
the completion of reports. As a part of the review,
an SWCA archaeologist reviewed the Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Historic
Overlay, a mapping/geographic information
systems database with historic maps and resource
information covering most portions of the state
(Foster et al. 2006).

Shovel tests were approximately 30 centimeters
(cm) in diameter and excavated to culturally sterile
deposits, bedrock, or impassible basal clay,
whichever came first. The matrix from each shovel
test was screened through ¼-inch mesh and the
location of each excavation was plotted using a
hand-held Global Positioning System (GPS)
receiver. Each shovel test was recorded on a
standardized form to document the excavations.
SWCA performed a non-collection survey.
Artifacts encountered were tabulated, analyzed, and
photographed in the field, but not collected.

SITE EVALUATIONS
Each prehistoric and/or historic archaeological site
discovered or reevaluated during the survey was
assessed for eligibility for inclusion to the NRHP
according to 36 CFR 60.4., or for designation as an
SAL according to 13 TAC 26.8 of the Rules of
Practice and Procedure. Assessments considered
both the archaeological aspects of sites and any
standing structures. NRHP eligibility assessed
these four criteria:

FIELD METHODS

(a) associated with events that have made a
significant contribution to the broad patterns of our
history; or
(b) associated with the lives of persons significant
in our past; or
(c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a
type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high
artistic values, or that represent a significant and
distinguishable entity whose components may lack
individual distinction; or
(d) that have yielded, or may be likely to yield,
information important in prehistory or history.

SWCA’s investigations consisted of an intensive
pedestrian survey with subsurface investigations
within the APE. Archaeologists examined the
ground surface and erosion profiles and exposures
for cultural resources. Subsurface investigations
involved shovel testing in settings with the potential
to contain buried cultural material, based upon
proximity to waterways, soil types, prior
disturbances, and landforms. For linear projects, the
THC’s survey standards require 16 shovel tests per
mile, per 100 feet of corridor width. Area surveys
require a minimum of one shovel test per two acres
for projects 10 to 100 acres in size and one shovel
test per 3 acres for projects over 100 acres in size.
Thus, the combination of 2 miles of roadway, the
46-acre FEMA 100-year floodplain, and additional
proposed development acreage requires a minimum
of 172 shovel tests within the project APE. No
shovel tests are warranted in areas that exhibit
previous disturbance, have a slope greater than 20
percent, or surface visibility greater than 30
percent.

For official SAL designation, four characteristics of
each archaeological site were relevant and were
considered: density, thickness, and time span of
cultural deposit; integrity; research potential; and
susceptibility to vandalism.

RESULTS
BACKGROUND REVIEW
The background literature review determined that
two cultural resources surveys are known to have

8

been conducted within and immediately adjacent to
portions of the APE and that two archaeological
sites (41TV2196 and 41TV2366) are recorded
within it. Six cultural resources surveys and 21
archaeological sites are located within a 1-mile
radius of the APE (Table 1). The two
archaeological sites within the APE are discussed
below, along with previously conducted cultural
resources surveys. Additionally, there is one
cemetery within a 1-mile radius of the APE. The
review of the TxDOT Historic Overlay maps
revealed approximately 20 possible historic-age
structures within or adjacent to the current APE
(Foster et al. 2006).

In 2006 and 2007, a cultural resources survey was
performed by Halff Associates for the McKinney
Falls Parkway Expansion Project along the western
margin of the current APE between East William
Cannon Drive and Thaxton Road in Travis County,
Texas (Leezer 2007). Two archaeological sites
(41TV2196 and 41TV2197) were identified during
the survey, with site 41TV2196 located within the
southwestern portion of the current APE, and site
41TV2197 located south of it (see Table 1). Both
sites are dispersed prehistoric lithic scatters
primarily consisting of tested cobbles, cores, and
primary stage debitage (Leezer 2007). Based on the
natural and artificial impacts to the sites, as well as
the lack of diagnostic artifacts, both were
recommended not eligible for inclusion to the
NRHP or designation as an SAL, and no further
work was recommended (Leezer 2007).

An archaeological survey was conducted by
Ecological
Communications
Corporation
(ECOMM) in 2010 within portions of the current
APE for the City of Austin’s South IH-35
Water/Wastewater Program Project in Travis
County, Texas (Butler and Feit 2010). One cultural
resource site (41TV2366) recorded during this
investigation falls within the current APE, and
another previously recorded cultural resource site
(41TV1096) reassessed during this investigation is
north of the current APE, but within a 1-mile radius
(see Table 1).

In addition to the above investigations, another five
cultural resources surveys have been conducted
within a 1-mile radius of the current APE. In 2003,
SWCA conducted a cultural resources survey south
of Colton Bluff Springs Road and near the
southwestern portion of the current APE.
Investigators identified a historic farmstead
(41TV2033) with historic features (e.g., residence
structure and well) and scattered artifacts (Houk et
al. 2003). The historic farmstead (41TV2033) is
interpreted as dating from late-nineteenth to midtwentieth centuries and was recommended not
eligible for inclusion to the NRHP and no further
investigations were recommended (Houk et al.
2003). Site 41TV2033 is located 0.4 mile west of
the APE and is depicted on the 1896, 1932, and
1955 USGS topographic maps. In 2009, ECOMM
performed an archaeological survey for the
Slaughter Lane Eastward Extension Project in
Travis County, Texas (Butler and Feit 2009). The
project recorded two historic sites (41TV2333 and
41TV2334) south of and within a 1-mile radius of
the current APE (see Table 1).

Site 41TV2366 is located north of Colton Bluff
Springs Road, just east of Cottonmouth Creek, and
southwest of Pilot Knob. The site is a historic 2.4acre early twentieth-century farm complex
consisting of a wood-frame, single-story house, a
garage, a barn, workshop, limestone well, storm
cellar, and several additional outbuildings, at least
one of which was likely used as a residence (Butler
and Feit 2010). The portion of site 41TV2366
within the IH-35 Waste/Wastewater Program
project area was recommended not eligible for
inclusion to the NRHP or designation as an SAL,
and no further work was recommended (Butler and
Feit 2010). However, ECOMM’s report
specifically mentions that should the larger
property be affected by the proposed William
Cannon Road extension, then further research for
site 41TV2366 may be warranted, particularly
additional shovel testing at the farm complex itself,
and possibly additional archival research (Butler
and Feit 2010).

FIELD SURVEY

cultural material. Shovel tests across the ridges
typically encountered gravelly clay atop chalky,
degrading limestone bedrock. Unique within the
APE is the northern portion of area 1C, where
igneous basalt resulting from eruptions at Pilot
Knob is present across the surface (Figure 5). Little
to no soil is present in this northern portion and no
cultural material was observed. Surface visibility
across the APE is generally 10 to 20 percent with
scattered areas of sparse vegetation providing an
excellent visibility of 50 to 75 percent.

Between the dates of March 10 and March 20,
2014, SWCA archaeologists conducted an
intensive pedestrian and subsurface survey of the
entire 302-acre APE. The proposed project involves
three components that include 2 miles of proposed
road ROW (71.3 acres), 46.4 acres of FEMA 100year floodplain, and 184.2 acres of additional land
proposed for development (Figure 2). The results of
the investigation for each of these areas are
discussed separately below.

Proposed Travis County ROW

A pedestrian survey was conducted across the
entire APE with varied frequency of subsurface
investigations in accordance with the guidelines
provided in Section 106 of the NHPA and the CTA
Guidelines. The current condition of the APE,
including previous disturbance and soils, was
documented through detailed notes, shovel test
records, and photographs. The THC minimum
survey standards for project areas exceeding 100
acres in size require one shovel test per 3 acres.
Accordingly, a project area of this size (i.e., 302
acres) is recommended to have 100 shovel tests.
Overall, a total of 168 shovel tests were excavated
within the APE in support of the current project,
which exceeds the recommended amount (Figure
3).

The 2 miles of proposed road ROW will eventually
be controlled by Travis County. Survey
investigations within the ROW were performed in
compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas
(Permit No. 6810). The width of the proposed
William Cannon ROW varies from 150 to 330 feet
from west to east culminating in 71.3 acres (see
Figure 2). Due to the varying width, the ROW was
surveyed by means of two and three transects for a
distance of 0.4 and 1.6 miles, respectively. The
western half of the proposed ROW parallels an
existing waterline, resulting in extensive impacts to
the APE in this area (Figure 6).
THC minimum survey standards for linear surveys
require 16 shovel tests per mile, per 100 feet of
corridor width, or 88 shovel tests for the currently
proposed APE. Based on the extent of prior
disturbances and surface visibility that consistently
exceeded 30 percent, a total of 67 shovel tests was
excavated within the proposed 2-mile ROW.
Within the overall 302 acres, however, the survey
exceeded the THC minimum survey standards.

Field investigations encountered two general
settings within the upland Blackland Prairie
environment: broad, gently sloping creek
floodplains and rolling, gravelly ridges. An
interfluve ridge, east of Cottonmouth Creek,
roughly divides the APE. This ridgeline extends
south from Pilot Knob, a Late-Cretaceous Period
volcano, the peak of which is located 270 meters
(m) north of the APE boundary. The vast majority
of the APE traverses open, rolling prairie land
characterized by tall grass and a lack of trees
(Figure 4). Patchy grass, cacti, mesquite, and
juniper is common across the gravelly upland
ridges extending through the center of the APE,
south of Pilot Knob, and along the southwestern
APE boundary, north of Colton Bluff Springs Road.
As expected, the soils within the APE vary
depending on landform from deep, calcareous clays
to shallow, gravelly clay. The excavations within
the floodplain occasionally encountered dense
gravels, at which point the tests were terminated;
but excavations were more frequently terminated
due to an absence of Holocene-age deposits and

Eight shovel tests were positive for cultural
material within the proposed ROW. Seven of these
tests were located within the boundary of newly
documented site 41TV2456, discussed in detail
below. The eighth positive shovel test is located on
site 41TV2457, located within the proposed ROW
at the intersection of Highway 183 and FM 1625.
Previously recorded historic site 41TV2366 is also
located within the ROW, on the east side of
Cottonmouth Creek. The boundary of site
41TV2366 was expanded approximately 200 m to
the north to include a tenant farmer house,
outhouse, and associated mid- to late-twentiethcentury debris (see Figure 3).

100-year Floodplain
The second project component is the 46.4 acres of
FEMA floodplain (see Figure 2). The 100-year
floodplain flanks both sides of Cottonmouth Creek
and was investigated for anticipated compliance
with application requirements for a USACE Ft.
Worth District Section 404 permit and FEMA
permitting. The THC minimum survey standards
for this area indicate 23 shovel tests within the
floodplain. SWCA excavated a total of 34 shovel
tests, exceeding the recommended coverage. None
of the shovel tests in the floodplain were positive
for cultural material (see Figure 3).
Figure 4. Project overview, facing west.

The Cottonmouth Creek cut banks were also
examined, revealing very dark, grayish-brown clay
through the extent of the APE (Figure 7). The cut
bank profiles are only present in the northern half
of the APE. From Colton Bluff Springs Road
through roughly the mid-point of the APE, the
creek has one main channel that is about 1 foot deep
with rounded banks and several shallower channels
winding through the floodplain, suggestive of a
braided channel network (Knighton 1998). These
channels merge as water flows downstream to
create a single channel that is roughly 3 feet deep
and 8 feet wide. This fluvial arrangement is
typically associated with frequent lateral accretion
and erosion (Knighton 1998). Accordingly, the
lateral movement of the drainage may affect the
integrity of any cultural deposits (if present) that
may be buried.

Figure 5. Basalt outcrop, facing south.

Of note, a fire hydrant and four Austin Water
Works meters are located on the right bank of
Cottonmouth Creek, in the northern portion of the
APE (Figure 8). The hydrant is a “5 ¼ American
Darling Valve B-62 B-5” made in Beaumont, Texas
with a date of 1987. Regardless of the specific date,
this model was introduced in 1962 (American
2014). As this is not historic in nature, a GPS point
and photographs were taken as evidence of modern
disturbance.

Site 41TV2196

Proposed Development- Areas 1A, 1B, and
1C

Site 41TV2196 was initially recorded as a lithic
procurement site by Halff Associates Inc. (Baletti
and Valentine 2006). It is located on a hilltop at the
intersection of McKinney Falls Parkway and
Colton Bluff Springs Road (see Figure 3). The
portion of the site that overlaps the current APE is
on the east side of McKinney Falls Road
overlooking the broad floodplain of Cottonmouth
Creek to the east. During the current SWCA revisit
of the site, investigators documented historic farm
remnants consisting of a concrete perimeter beam,
well pipe, and earthen levee/stock pond (Resources
1–3).

The third component of the APE involves the
proposed development outside of the road ROW
and 100-year floodplain (see Figure 2). The
proposed development areas do not require
compliance with either the Antiquities Code of
Texas or Section 106 of the NHPA, but were
investigated for due diligence. As such, the 184.2acre development areas (1A=54.7 acres, 1B=83.6
acres, and 1C=45.9 acres) were surveyed in
accordance with the THC minimum survey
standards requiring 61 shovel tests. SWCA
excavated 72 shovel tests across these areas
exceeding the required amount, four of which were
positive for cultural material and part of 41TV2459
(Appendix A).

The overall site boundary was expanded roughly 35
m to the northeast to include the earthen levee and
stock pond, while the newly documented historic
artifact scatter occupies an 85 m by 65 m area
within the previously recorded boundary (Figure 9).
As such, the current boundary of 41TV2196
measures 450 m northwest to southeast by 130 m
northeast to southwest. Vegetation consists of
patchy grass, mesquite trees and mixed hardwoods.
A total of four shovel tests (MC15, MN11, MN12,
and MS14) were excavated during the revisit to
supplement the previous five excavated by Halff
Associates Inc. (Baletti and Valentine 2006). All
shovel tests excavated during the current project
were negative for cultural material. Soils on the site
consist of silty loam or clay over dense gravels at a
depth of 30 to 40 cmbs (Appendix A).

Portions of Area 1A adjacent to Colton Bluff
Springs Road and Area 1C, along the northern APE
boundary exhibited shallow, gravelly soil or
bedrock at the surface. The remainder of the
combined areas consisted of thick Blackland Prairie
clay with no evidence of cultural activity. The four
positive shovel tests recorded within the proposed
development areas were located on newly
documented site 41TV2459, in area 1B.
Within area 1C, previously recorded historic site
41TV2366 was expanded approximately 200 m to
the north to include a wooden, 2-room tenant farm
house, outhouse, and associated mid- to latetwentieth-century debris.

Very little historic material is present in the area of
the concrete perimeter beam and well pipe and there
is no evidence to suggest activity prior to the midtwentieth century. Historic debris consists of one
clear and one brown bottle glass fragment, one
metal paint bucket, and one window glass fragment.
Based on proximity to the roadway, these items
could be attributed to roadside debris. One chert
core was noted on the surface of the hilltop;
however, no other prehistoric material was noted.

The resources present at the site (the foundation
ruin, the well, and the earthen levee) were likely
constructed during the 1930s or 1940, indicating
that they were built by the Shans family. Thomas
Buford Shans, born in 1892, worked as an oil well
driller in Texas. Shelly Shans was born Shelly
Shano in 1895. The Shans had five children.
Research could not locate specific historical
significance related to the Shans family.
Site 41TV2196 was evaluated according to NRHP
and SAL criteria. Based on the lack of historical
significance and the overall lack of integrity, site
41TV2196 is recommended as not eligible for
inclusion to the NRHP or for designation as an
SAL. Accordingly, no further work is
recommended.

The concrete perimeter beam (Resource 1) is
located on a flat hilltop at the southwest corner of
the APE (Figure 10). The perimeter and center
beam are 10 inches wide and the foundation
footprint measures 20 feet by 23 feet (Figure 11).
Its age is unknown.

Site 41TV2366

Resource 2, the well, consists of a 9-inch-diameter
steel well pipe. The top of the pipe is flush with the
ground surface, and its steel collar extends 4 feet
below ground. The overall depth of the well is
estimated to be 10 feet. Its age is also unknown,
although, as previously noted, none of the artifacts
or features suggests activity prior to the midtwentieth century.

Site 41TV2366 is located on the right bank of
Cottonmouth Creek, 980 m east of McKinney Falls
Parkway and 430 m north of Colton Bluff Springs
Road (see Figure 3). The site lies at the base of a
rising upland landform, southwest of Pilot Knob.
The area is largely within open agricultural fields
with short grass and hardwoods around the home
and dense secondary growth surrounding the tenant
house to the north.

An earthen levee (Resource 3) is located 50 m north
of the hilltop. The levee is approximately 10 feet
wide and a maximum of 4 feet high. It extends 260
m to the east into a stock pond which marks the
northeastern extent of the site (Figure 12). Based on
the lack of typical household debris in the area of
the foundation and well, it is possible that this area
was strictly agricultural in nature.
The archival review indicates the parcel containing
site 41TV2196 was owned by Thomas Buford
Shans and Shelly Shans in the 1950s. Deed records
show that Thomas Buford, the surviving husband of
Shelly Sans, sold the parcel to Jimmie Lee Cowan
in 1958. Deed research could not identify when the
Shans family acquired the parcel; however, the
1940 U.S. Census records show that they were
living on Route 1 in Creedmoor in 1940. This is
likely the parcel in question. The 1930 Census
shows them living on West Mary Street in Austin,
so they moved to the Creedmoor property some
time during the 1930s.

The site consists of a 1920s to 1930s farmstead
containing 11 extant resources (Figure 13). The site
was investigated by Butler and Feit in 2010; their
report provides a detailed description of the
farmstead. In addition to the main farmstead, the
current investigations encountered a 2-room,
wooden tenant farmer house and wooden outhouse
200 m to the north (Figure 14). As such, the site
measures 310 m northeast to southwest by 130 m
northwest to southeast.

Research indicates that the parcel containing Site
41TV2366 was owned by farmers Robert and
Rachiel (also spelled Rachael and Rachel) Pierson
(also spelled Peerson and Pearson), who also owned
the adjacent parcel along Cottonmouth Creek. The
Piersons sold their land in 1914 and 1915. The new
owners of the parcels were a group of Robert
Pierson’s nieces and nephews, who all had the
surname Cowan. Nephew Robert C. was the eldest
Cowan.

The tenant house and outhouse (Resources 12 and
13) are surrounded by bottles, tin cans, and
children's toys dating to the late-twentieth century.
No artifacts predating the mid-twentieth century
were noted on the ground surface. A total of nine
shovel tests (KF22, KF27–28, KF31, MC60–62,
MC64, and MS48) were excavated within the
expanded site boundary (six around the main
farmstead, one in the open field, and two near the
tenant house) and all were negative for cultural
material. Soils encountered within the shovel tests
consist of silty loam to clay (Appendix A).

The 2010 investigations at 41TV2366 determined
the site is not eligible for inclusion to the NRHP or
for designation as an SAL. Nothing was observed
in the current investigations to alter the previous
recommendations; SWCA concurs with these
findings and recommends no further work.

open field to the southeast. Prehistoric artifacts
were identified on the surface and within shovel
tests (KF10, KF16–17, MC37, and MC45–46) to a
maximum depth of 40 cmbs (Appendix A). This
component is relatively sparse, with no diagnostic
artifacts or features encountered.
In addition to prehistoric lithic debitage, historic
artifacts recovered within the shovel tests include
whiteware, brown bottle glass, clear bottle glass,
square nails, round nails, miscellaneous metal,
porcelain, metal wire, and one metal button (wire
fastened) (Figure 15). One of the whiteware
fragments exhibits part of the Order of the Garter
with the phrase “Honi Soit Qui Mal y Pense.,”
indicating production in Great Brittian by a
manufacturer holding a Royal contract. No further
identification could be made. Additionally, an
enormous amount of modern items (1960s–present)
are present in and around all structures on the site
including automotive/mechanical equipment,
office cubicles, classroom desks, home furniture, a
motor boat, and typical household items. One older
piece of mechanical equipment includes a “Century
Electric Co.” 10-horse-power electric motor that is
mounted atop a concrete block near the stone house.
The company was in operation from 1910 until the
1970s, at which time they were owned by Gould
Inc. (Vintage Motors 2014). Patent dates on the
motor are March 7, 1899 and January 13, 1903. The
company obtained an additional patent in 1914,
indicating that this piece of equipment was likely
put to use at the site between 1903 and 1914.

Site 41TV2456
Site 41TV2456 consists of multiple historic
components imprinted atop a prehistoric lithic
scatter. The site is located on a hilltop within a
rolling prairie environment, 630 m due west of the
intersection of Hwy 183 and FM 1625 (see Figure
3). Vegetation consists of short grass and
hardwoods with longer, patchy grass in the field to
the southeast. A tributary drainage of the North
Fork Dry Creek curves around the site from
northwest to southeast.
The site’s historic component consists of a
farmstead with stone structure and artifacts dating
to the mid- to late-nineteenth century, as well as
multiple structures that were built in the 1930s
(Resources 1–13; see Figure 10). Resource 1 (the
stone house) and artifacts in the northeast portion of
the site represent the earliest occupation. The house
that was occupied until the mid-2000s was likely
built in the 1930s, and additional structures were
added to the farmstead through the 1960s. A total
of seven shovel tests were excavated (KF10, KF16–
17, MC37, MC45–47), all of which were positive
for cultural material to a maximum of 40 cmbs.
Soils across the site consist of silty loam to clay
(Appendix A). Overall, the site measures 145 m in
diameter.

Resource 1 is a mid- to late-nineteenth-century
stone house located in the northeast portion of the
site. The building is in a ruinous state, with portions
of two walls standing. The house’s original
footprint measured 15 feet by 30 feet (Figure 16).
Currently, the northeast and northwest walls and the
roof are gone. Although in poor condition, the
southeast and southwest walls remain with missing
stones and a partially collapsed section. The walls
are constructed with limestone rubble with sandy
mortar and yellowish sandstone used for chinking.
The house was side-gabled, with its entry on the
southeast wall. The structure’s door is missing, and
a fallen tree has damaged the opening. One window
opening in the southwest wall has wood framing
and a wood lintel, but is missing the window sash.

The prehistoric component consists of nondiagnostic lithic debitage diffusely scattered in the
central portion of the site and extending into the

22

Resource 2 is a 1930s Hay Barn. It is a front-gabled
building with a tall entrance on one gable end. The
wood-framed barn is clad in corrugated metal and
has a metal roof. Inside, the first floor is a single
open space with a low ceiling and several wood
supports. The second floor is a hayloft with small
hayloft windows at each end. At one corner of the
barn is an inset parking area supported by hewn tree
trunks. Several sections of corrugated metal siding
are missing.

this central passage. To either side of the central
passage are animal stalls, located within the
building’s wide side wings.

Resource 3 is a large Barn with a tall front-gabled
central volume flanked by two wide attached wings.
The barn dates from circa 1930 and is framed with
a mixture of tree trunks and milled lumber. Sections
of the roof framing appear to be recently replaced.
The building is clad in corrugated metal. The barn
was intended for use as an animal barn, and has a
wide central passageway inside. Broad barn doors
are located in each gable end to provide access to

Figure 17. Resource 5, facing northeast.

Resource 4, the Water Tower, is a circa 1930 metal
structure consisting of four canted metal poles
braced with metal crossbeams. Atop the supporting
structure is a cylindrical metal water tank. The
water tower is rusted but appears to be intact.

Resource 6 is a small Tenant House located a short
distance northeast of the main house, along a
concrete walkway that connects several resources
at the site. The front entrance opens into the fenced
rear yard of the main house (Resource 5). The
Tenant House is a circa 1940s building with
horizontal board siding and a heavily damaged
wood roof that was repaired with a covering of
metal and fiberglass corrugated siding. The
structure is missing its door and the windows have
been covered with plywood.

Resource 5 is the House, a circa 1930 bungalow
with narrow wood siding. The building is frontgabled and has a partially inset, partial-width front
porch (Figure 17). The porch has been altered by
the addition of screening. The roof, which is clad in
metal, has a prominent eave overhang. Several of
the building’s wood elements are deteriorated,
including siding, trim, window sash, and window
screens.

Resource 7, the Garage, is a partially collapsed
structure with corrugated metal siding. It dates from
circa 1930 and is framed with a mixture of town
wood tree trunks and wood boards. It has a dirt

24

floor. The roof, which was once side-gabled, has
collapsed.

concrete block structures that shelter electric
pumping equipment. They were likely constructed
in the 1960s.

Resource 8, a Storage Shed, is a barn-style shed
with wood framing and corrugated metal siding.
The shed is windowless and has one door in its front
elevation gable end. A metal carport is attached to
the rear elevation. The shed and its carport are
rusted and several pieces of corrugated metal are
missing. The shed was likely constructed in the
1940s to 1950s. The interior space is currently
occupied by several elementary school desks and
dismantled office cubical walls.

Additional small features that were not assigned
resource numbers include a solid set of concrete
steps and an outdoor fire pit. The steps are located
at the northeast end of a concrete walkway, where
they provide easy passage from the house to the
barns, which are located beyond a barbed wire
fence line (see Figure 10). The apparent fire pit is
located near the well, and is constructed of
limestone blocks with concrete mortar and an iron
grate cooking surface.

Resource 9, the Mechanic Garage, is a large frontgabled garage building with a wide front entry bay
in its front elevation (Figure 18). The circa 1930
building has a thick slab foundation and a concrete
floor. The walls and overhanging roof are clad in
corrugated metal. Inside, the garage has elaborate
barrel-vaulted roof framing, which opens up more
of the building’s interior height to allow taller
vehicles inside. A trough-like concrete drainage
sink runs along one side of the building at floor
level. The garage has several window openings, all
of which are wood framed. Some of the historic
window sashes are in place, while other openings
have been covered with corrugated metal. At the
rear of the garage, several small interior walls have
been formed with vertical planks.

The archival review indicates that the parcel
containing site 41TV2456 was owned by Marion E.
and Sarah Elizabeth Houston in the late 1800s
during the time the stone house was constructed.
Marion E. Houston was born in Texas in about 1869
and Sarah Elizabeth was born in Tennessee in 1875.
Census records show the couple living in southeast
Travis County in both 1910 and 1920. Earlier
records could not be located, but since deed
research indicates the Houstons owned the land
prior to 1900, the stone building (Resource 1) was
likely constructed by them. Marion and Sarah
Houston had seven children. Research could not
locate specific historical significance related to the
Houston family.

Resource 10 is a Brick-Lined Well that has been
partially covered by brush and debris. The circular
well is lined with rough bricks. The well is located
along the concrete path behind the House (Resource
5) and to the east of the Tenant House (Resource 6).
It was likely constructed in the 1930s or 1940s to
provide water to these resources.
Resource 11 is a Collapsed Shed that was once a
wood-framed structure with corrugated metal
siding. Its construction date and original
appearance is unknown.
Resource 12 is a Concrete Foundation for a
structure once located at the site. The original
building here is gone and its past characteristics are
not known. Its construction date is unknown.

Resources 13a and 13b are both small pump houses
with adjacent wells. The pump houses are small

Deed records show that the Houstons sold the
parcel to Fred Sassman in 1914. Sassman was a
German immigrant who served in the Confederate
Army and died in 1929. In 1932 Fred’s widow,
Mary Ross Sassman, sold the parcel to her son
William E. Sassman, who is listed in census records
as a farmer. William owned it until 1976. It was
likely William E. Sassman who built the circa
1930s and 1940s buildings at the site. Research
could not locate specific historical significance
related to William E. Sassman. Specifically, the
stone house (Resource 1) is in a ruinous state and
lacks enough integrity to convey its historic
characteristics. The 1930s to 1940s farmstead
cluster does contain several buildings that are in
good condition with good integrity, but others have
had significant alterations.

sections, hog wire, barbed wire, and tires are all
located near the west end of the site (Figure 20).
Positive shovel test MC39 was located in this area.
MC39 included one clear glass fragment, four
miscellaneous metal fragments, and one painted
concrete fragment.
The House (Resource 1) is a cross-gabled house
that was likely built in the 1930s and modified
sometime in the 1950s (Figure 21). The alterations
involve enclosing the porch, replacing the windows
with aluminum sash, and replacing the siding with
asbestos. Corrugated metal skirting covers the
house’s pier and beam foundation, preventing
examination.
Similarly, the other site structures largely date to
the mid-twentieth century. There is a large concrete
slab (Resource 2) behind the house, with a partiallyexposed fiberglass septic tank pipe running through
it. Northwest of the house is a cinderblock garage
(Resource 3), a limestone cistern (Resource 4),
multiple industrial foundation pads (Resources 5
and 6), and a well with wooden pump house
(Resource 7).

Site 41TV2456 was evaluated according to NRHP
and SAL criteria. Based on the lack of historical
associations, lack of distinctive architectural
characteristics, and lack of integrity, the site is not
likely to yield further information. Site 41TV2456
is recommended as not eligible for inclusion to the
NRHP or for designation as an SAL. Accordingly,
no further work is recommended.

Resource 2 (Foundation 1) is a concrete perimeterwall foundation located directly behind the
residential structure. The foundation likely dates to
mid-twentieth century. No data was available to
identify what type of structure was originally
located on the foundation.

Site 41TV2457
Site 41TV2457 is an historic mid-twentieth-century
site containing several structures, ancillary features,
and industrial foundation slabs surrounded by
historic and recent debris (Figure 19). The site is
situated in open, level prairie immediately
southwest of the intersection of US183/FM 1625
(Figure 3). Vegetation at the site consists of short
grass and a few scattered hardwoods.

Resource 3, the Garage, is a long, side-gabled
concrete block building with a rolling metal door
along half of its front elevation (see Figure 20). The
garage has several small window openings with
concrete sills. The building techniques suggest that
it dates to the middle twentieth century.

Overall, the site contains seven historic resources
(Resources 1–7) and measures 105 m northwest to
southeast by 85 m northeast to southwest. A total of
seven shovel tests were excavated on the site
(KF32–35, MC34, MC39 and MS51), one of which
(MC39) was positive for cultural material at a depth
of 30 to 45 cmbs (Appendix A). Soil on the site
consists of dark gray clay with high gravel content.
The artifact assemblage present around the yard is
mid- to late-twentieth century, comprised mostly of
industrial debris. Milled lumber, railroad timbers,
50-gallon barrels, concrete and plastic conduit

Resource 4 (a cistern) has been infilled with brush
and debris and is 15 feet in diameter and
constructed from limestone. Several concrete
patches are found along its rim. It appears to date to
the 1930s, with repairs dating to the 1950s.

only foundations, or simple structures with
significant alterations. Based on the lack of
historical associations, lack of distinctive
architectural characteristics, and lack of integrity,
the site is not likely to yield further information.
Site 41TV2457 is recommended as not eligible for
inclusion to the NRHP or for designation as an
SAL. Accordingly, no further work is
recommended.

Resource 5 (Foundation 2) is a concrete slab located
directly west of Resource 4. This small slab
foundation is featureless and overgrown with
vegetation. No data was available to identify what
type of structure was originally located on the
foundation or its date of construction.

Site 41TV2458
Site 41TV2458 consists of an historic early- to midtwentieth-century farmstead with structures and
associated features within a scatter of latetwentieth-century debris. The site is located at the
back edge of the Cottonmouth Creek floodplain,
immediately north of Colton Bluff Springs Road
and 615 m southeast of McKinney Falls Parkway
(Figure 3). The site wraps around the east and north
sides of a modern house and yard.

Resource 6 consists of two industrial foundation
slabs such as those built to support pump jacks or
other oil and gas machinery (see Figure 20). These
concrete slabs exhibited no inscription to indicate
date of construction.
Resource 7 is a Well and Pump House that date to
the mid-twentieth century for construction. The
well is manufactured from poured concrete and
bears no temporal inscription. The pump house is a
small wood-framed structure with a concrete floor
and currently houses electric pumping equipment.

Overall, the site includes seven historic resources
(Resources 1–7) and measures 120 m northwest to
southeast by 50 m northeast to southwest (Figure
22). Vegetation consists of tall grass, hardwood
trees, and dense secondary undergrowth around the
abandoned structures. Items such as a gas can,
wooden trunk, glass bottles, an historic icebox, and
metal cans dating to the mid- to late- twentieth
century were noted in and around the historic
resources. Six shovel tests (KF23–24, MC17, and
MC54–56) were excavated on the site, all of which
were negative for cultural material. Soil
encountered on the site consists of silty clay loam
over thick clay (Appendix A).

The archival review indicates that the parcel (No.
298750) containing site 41TV2457 is located
within a parcel that was historically owned by
William E. Sassman. As with the nearby parcel,
William’s parents Fred and Mary Ross Sassman
acquired parcel 298750 in 1914 and transferred it to
William in 1932. The first constructed resources at
this site date to the period immediately following
William’s acquisition. It is not known which of the
William Sassman sites were used as his homestead
and which were used by tenants or other family
members. William Sassman sold the parcel with
site 41TV2457 to J.E. Boyd and C.E. Boyd in 1951.
Therefore, the mid-twentieth-century structures
present at the site were likely constructed by the
Boyd family. Research could not locate specific
historical significance related to William E.
Sassman, J.E. Boyd, or C.E. Boyd.

Resource 1, the House Foundation, consists of a
broken concrete foundation slab that measures
roughly 10 feet by 18 feet. The foundation would
have supported an early- to mid-twentieth century
structure with a pier and beam foundation.

Site 41TV2457 was evaluated according to NRHP
and SAL criteria. The residential structure
(Resource 1) at the site has been significantly
altered and can no longer convey its historic
characteristics. Further, the mid-twentieth-century
site features are either dilapidated ruins containing

Resource 2 is an underground Storm Cellar located
north of Resource 1 (Figure 23). The underground
chamber is accessed by a short stone stairway
flanked by limestone retaining walls. The interior
of the cellar is lined with limestone blocks and
measures 6 feet by 20 feet from the steps to the back
of cellar. No inscriptions were observed, but the
manufacturing techniques suggest an early- to midtwentieth-century construction.

Resource 5, the Coop, is an 8 square foot, wooden
chicken coop located just west of Resource 4. The
structure has a corrugated metal roof and a small
window covered with chicken wire. Manufacturing
techniques suggest an early- to mid-twentiethcentury construction.
Resource 6, the Barn and Corrals, is located in the
western portion of the site and measures roughly 36
feet by 24 feet (Figure 24). The barn is a frontgabled structure clad in wide, vertical wood planks
and a corrugated metal roof. The interior has a
raised wooden floor, a wide central aisle, and
animal stalls or storage rooms. The adjoining corral
contains animal stables with a mix of fencing types.
The stables have wooden gates and are partially
sheltered by an open shed-like wood and metal
awning. No inscriptions were observed, but the
manufacturing techniques suggest an early-to midtwentieth-century construction.

Resource 3 is a Well and Pump House located north
of Resource 1. The collar of the well feature is
brick-lined and finished with concrete, while the
small, square pump house is constructed of rock
with a concrete coating. Only two of the pump
house walls remain standing of the original 4 foot
by 4 foot structure. No inscriptions were observed,
but the manufacturing techniques suggest an earlyto mid-twentieth-century construction.
Resource 4, the Shed, is a short, wood structure
with a low-pitched, front-gabled roof. The small
two-room building has a concrete slab floor in one
room and a dirt floor in the other and measures 5
feet high by 10 square feet in size. The building
contains a low wooden bench along one interior
wall, an historic icebox, and assorted debris. No
inscriptions were observed, but the manufacturing
techniques suggest an early- to mid-twentiethcentury construction.

Resource 7, the Animal Pen, is a low, covered
animal shelter at the northwest corner of the site.
The small structure is constructed from corrugated
metal siding and measures 12 square feet by 3 feet
in height.

The archival review indicates that the parcel
containing site 41TV2358 was transferred to
several Cowan family members by their uncle
Robert Pierson in 1914 or 1915. R.P. Cowan and
Nettie Cowan established the farmstead in the
1920s to 1930s and lived there until Nettie died in
1971. One of the Cowan sons inhabited the parcel
until 1975 and the house was subsequently razed
leaving only the concrete foundation. Archival
research could not located specific historical
significance related to the Cowan family.

fragments, eight square nails, one screw, and one
hook. Metal cans and fragments were also noted on
the surface.
Resource 1, the Well or Cistern, is made of
limestone with a 3-foot-diameter neck that extends
2 feet above the ground surface (Figure 26). It has
a bell shape that appears to begin curving a few feet
below the surface. However, the interior of the
feature is obscured by soil and leaf litter. No
inscriptions were observed, but the manufacturing
techniques suggest a late-nineteenth-century
construction.

Site 41TV2458 was evaluated according to NRHP
and SAL criteria. The early- to mid-twentiethcentury farmstead cluster does contain buildings
that are in good condition with good integrity, but
also includes a house ruin and resources with
significant alterations. Based on the lack of
historical associations, lack of distinctive
architectural characteristics, and lack of integrity,
the site is not likely to yield further information.
Site 41TV2458 is recommended as not eligible for
inclusion to the NRHP or for designation as an
SAL. Accordingly, no further work is
recommended.

Resource 2, the Well, is a 6-inch-diameter steel pipe
vertically extending about 3 feet above the ground
surface (Figure 27). Resource 2 is located on the
hilltop near the likely site of the house. According
to a former landowner (Donny Cowan), the well
was drilled for oil/gas exploration in the 1960s and
subsequently used for water (Donny Cowan,
personal communication 2014).
Similar to Resource 2, Resource 3 is a 10-inchdiameter steel pipe that vertically extends about 3
feet above the ground surface. This well is located
about 50 m north of Resource 2 and also appears to
have been installed in the 1960s for oil/gas
exploration.

Site 41TV2459
Site 41TV2459 consists of the remnants of a latenineteenth century homestead with structures and
associated features (Resources 1–5) within a scatter
of late twentieth century debris. The site is located
on the northeast edge of a hilltop, 30 m northeast of
Colton Bluff Springs Road and 400 m southeast of
McKinney Falls Parkway (Figure 6).

Resource 4 is a concentration of cut limestone
blocks, each measuring 1 by 2 feet in size. The
blocks occupy a roughly 20 foot by 24 foot area and
appear to be the remnants of a late-nineteenthcentury chimney.
Resource 5 is a pile of brick located near Resource
4. The bricks are typical red brick manufacture,
measuring 8 by 4 inches in size. The dense pile of
bricks is 8 feet diameter and appears to be
intentionally mounded for recycled use. The area
surrounding Resources 4 and 5 contained dense
historic materials.

Overall, the site measures 80 m north to south by
55 m east to west (Figure 25). Vegetation consists
of tall grass, hardwoods, and dense secondary
growth. A total of six shovel tests were excavated
(KF25–26, MC57–59, and MS47), four of which
(KF25, MC57–58, and MS47) were positive for
cultural material to a maximum depth of 40 cmbs.
Soil encountered on the site consists of silty loam
over limestone bedrock.
Artifacts recovered from the positive shovel tests
include miscellaneous metal fragments, brown
bottle glass, brown ceramic fragments, whiteware,
clear bottle glass (several with heavy patina), olive
glass fragment, mortar fragments, two coal

The archival review indicates that the parcel
containing the site was owned by Robert and
Rachiel Pierson prior to 1900. The late-nineteenthcentury resources at the site were likely constructed
by Piersons who also owned the adjacent parcel to
the east (see discussion of Site TV2366). The parcel
containing the site was sold by Robert Pierson to a
group of his nieces and nephews in 1914 or 1915.
Robert Pierson (also spelled Peerson and Pearson)
was a farmer who was born in Georgia. Research
could not located specific historical significance
related to the Pierson family.
Site 41TV2459 was evaluated according to NRHP
and SAL criteria. The late-nineteenth-century stone
resources lack physical integrity and are no longer
able to convey their historic associations. Based on
the lack of historical associations, lack of
distinctive architectural characteristics, and lack of
integrity, the site is not likely to yield further
information. Site 41TV2459 is recommended as not
eligible for inclusion to the NRHP or for
designation as an SAL. Accordingly, no further
work is recommended.

Isolated Finds
Several isolated occurrences of cultural materials
were encountered during the survey of the APE.
These surficial artifacts, when examined, were
determined to not be associated with any other
materials suggesting an archaeological site and
were designated as isolated finds. The
investigations encountered two prehistoric isolated
artifacts (IF01 and IF02) on the west side of
Cottonmouth Creek, and one isolated historic water
tank (IF03) located just east of the City of Austin
access road from Colton Bluff Springs Road to the
Pilot Knob substation.

Figure 27. Site 41TV2459 Resource 2, facing
north.

Artifact IF01 is a secondary chert flake that was
found on the ground surface roughly 75 m west of
Cottonmouth Creek (Figure 28, left). The flake was
encountered near an existing water line where

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

result of modern waterline construction after
decades of agricultural utilization.

SWCA conducted an intensive cultural resources
survey on behalf of Brookfield Residential for the
proposed Easton Park Development Project APE in
southeastern Travis County. The APE is defined as
a 2.0-mile-long corridor that will connect East
William Cannon Drive with US 183 and the
development of the adjoining parcels that
encompass about 230.7 acres. The depths of
impacts for the project are not currently known, but
are not expected to exceed 5 feet below ground
surface. The overall APE for the proposed project
is 302 acres, which includes the proposed road
ROW and the development of adjoining parcels.

IF03 consists of an historic water tank. The
reservoir is a corrugated metal cylinder, measuring
6 feet high by 8 feet diameter. It is currently resting
on the ground surface near a pile of lumber that is
mixed in with several fallen tree trunks (Figure 29).
A wooden deer stand, metal ladder, and several
segments of iron sucker rod are located against a
nearby fence line, indicating that there may have
been a well at the location. No well was
encountered and it is likely that the water tank is
related to historic agricultural practice. No artifacts
or additional features were encountered in the area.

The proposed road right-of-way will eventually be
controlled by Travis County, a political subdivision
of the State of Texas; therefore, compliance with
the Antiquities Code of Texas was necessary.
Additionally, the project must comply with
application requirements for a U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers Ft. Worth District Section 404 permit in
accordance with 33 CFR Part 325, Appendix C
(Processing Department of Army Permits:
Procedures for the Protection of Historic Properties;
Final Rule 1990; with current Interim Guidance
Document dated June 24, 2002) and with Section
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (16
USC 470), and its implementing regulations (36
CFR 800). Portions of the project within the 100year floodplain may also be subject to permitting by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency and
required Section 106 compliance, as well.
The purpose of the work was to locate and identify
all prehistoric and historic archaeological sites in
the APE, establish vertical and horizontal site
boundaries as appropriate with regard to the APE,
and evaluate the significance and eligibility of any
site recorded within the property for inclusion to the
NRHP or designation as an SAL. The investigations
included a background review of previous work,
historic map review, an archival review of the APE
parcels, and an intensive pedestrian survey with
shovel testing of the APE.

Figure 29. Isolated Artifact 3, facing northwest.

The background review determined that portions of
the APE have been previously surveyed with two
cultural resources sites documented in the APE
(41TV2196 and 41TV2366). The historic map

35

review revealed approximately 20 possible historicage structures within or adjacent to the property
dating back to 1896.
During the cultural resources survey, SWCA
archaeologists examined the entire 302 acre APE
with intensive pedestrian inspection and a total of
168 shovel tests. The THC’s survey standards for a
project of this size require 172 shovel tests.
Considering the amount of disturbance and surface
visibility, the current investigations exceeded the
THC standards. In general, the APE consists of an
eroded and rocky upland setting with very shallow
soil. As the APE is located along the edges of the
road ROW, there was a significant amount of
disturbance throughout. Disturbances consist of
road construction and maintenance activity, buried
and overhead utilities, private driveways, and sheet
erosion.
The SWCA investigations revisited sites
41TV2196 and 41TV2366, documented four new
archaeological sites (41TV2456–41TV2459), and
encountered three isolated artifacts (IF01–IF03).
The encountered cultural resources are primarily
associated with historic homestead-farmstead
structures and activities from the early to middle
twentieth century. Based on a variety of factors,
none of the archaeological sites are recommended
for listing in the NRHP or as an SAL.
In accordance with the Antiquities Code of Texas
and 33 CFR 800.4, SWCA has made a reasonable
and good faith effort to identify cultural resources
within the APE. As no properties were identified
that meet the criteria for listing on the NRHP,
according to 36 CFR 60.4, or for designation as an
SAL, according to 13 TAC 26.12, SWCA
recommends no further cultural resources
investigations are warranted within the project APE
