ABSTRACT
In October and November of 2009, archaeologists from aci consulting conducted an intensive
cultural resources survey of 58.1 acres for the Northgate Site re-evaluation. Blanchard Partners
Investments, LLC is investigating development potential on the 58.1 acres currently identified by
the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) as
the Northgate Archaeological Site or 41EP6 (listed 1972), located within the Castner Range
National Register District (listed 1976). The project area is situated on land owned by the
University of Texas-El Paso. During the 37 years since the initial identification, evaluation, and
nomination, a significant amount of work has been conducted in the area. Prior to making any
decisions regarding this property, it was determined that a re-evaluation of these cultural
resources was justified. The work was conducted as an intensive survey in accordance with the
Texas Antiquities Code (Permit # 5443) and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act as amended (36 CFR 800). The non-collection survey utilized methods that conform to the
revised Texas Historical Commission (THC) survey standards.
The area under investigation is located north of Diana Dr., east of Kenworthy St. and south of
Loop 375 in northwest El Paso, El Paso County, Texas. The projected construction impacts are
still under development. It is clear, however, that the construction of facilities will be limited to
the 16.8 acres located in the northwest part of the project area. At this time there is no plan for
additional development of the remaining 41.3 acres; however there may be some discussion of
recreational foot and bike paths in the future. The 41.3 acres currently not proposed for
development lies within a flood zone area, and construction potential is extremely limited.
This investigation consisted of aci consulting archaeologists conducting a thorough site files
search, preparing a research design, and completing intensive subsurface testing of the project
area utilizing the excavation of backhoe trenches in areas of soil development; this was
supplemented by pedestrian survey throughout the project area. Comprehensive records, handdrawn profiles, GPS mapping, and photographs of the excavations were maintained to record the
survey.
A records search was conducted at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and the
THC online Atlas of Historic Places and Texas Archeological Sites Atlas to locate any previously
recorded prehistoric and historic archaeological sites, cemeteries and previous surveys in the
vicinity of the project area. Sixty sites were recorded within one mile of the project area. Ten of
those sites are multi-component sites, and fifty are single-component prehistoric sites. Only one
site was recorded within the project area, 41EP6. This site is also listed on the NRHP and as a
State Archeological Landmark (SAL). 41EP6 and fifty-eight of the sixty previously mentioned
sites comprise the Castner Range Archeological District. According to the THC database,
eighteen previous surveys and testing projects have been conducted within one mile of the project
area. The previously recorded sites and surveys will be presented and discussed in the following
text of this report. Following the THC and TARL database search, aci archaeologists walked
pedestrian transects across the proposed area of potential effect (APE). Then 102 backhoe
trenches were excavated in areas of potential soil development. Finally, the areas immediately
adjacent to the APE were examined to confirm that no architectural resources of greater than 50
years of age were present.
During survey, aci archaeologists noted that the project area has been subjected to and affected by
infrastructure construction as well as previous intensive archaeological excavations. Soils
consisted of sand and loamy sand deposits overlying limestone and granite gravels. Evidence of
cultural material rested on the surface of the landscape in the form of pottery fragments and a few

i

lithic debitage specimens. The 58.1 acres for the Diana Road Development project area was
intensively surveyed. The area of 16.8 acres proposed for construction contains no cultural
material and is recommended for removal from the NRHP and SAL boundaries of 41EP6. A new
boundary for 41EP6 has been recommended, and during the January 2010 Texas Historical
Commission Quarterly Meeting the amendment to site 41EP6 with the newly established 7.8 acre
boundary was approved unanimously.
Should the UT system sell the 7.8 acres on which site 41EP6 is located, either the UT system or
the new owners should notify the THC of the sale. In addition, any potential private individuals
or corporations that purchase this land should notify the county clerk of their ownership of this
landmark.
aci consulting further concludes that the proposed construction undertaking within the 16.8-acre
portion of the property will have no adverse effect on any SAL or NRHP eligible properties. Meg
Thornton acted as Principal Investigator, and Jennifer Hatchett Kimbell served as Project
Archaeologist. The archaeological work described herein was carried out under Texas Antiquities
Permit Number 5443.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
This report summarizes the results of an archaeological survey of 58.1 acres for the Northgate
Site Reevaluation project in northwest El Paso, El Paso County, Texas. During October and
November, 2009, aci consulting carried out an intensive cultural resources survey of the 58.1-acre
area of potential effect (APE) for the Northgate Site Reevaluation (Figure 1). Blanchard Partners
Investments, LLC contracted aci consulting to investigate the locality for a proposed commercial
development and provided the funding for the current survey. The project area is situated on land
owned by the University of Texas-El Paso (UTEP).
The objective of this survey is to ascertain the presence or absence of identifiable cultural
resources within the project area and then to document and complete National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) and State Archeological Landmark (SAL) eligibility recommendations
for any such identified cultural resources. Prior to the initiation of any work, a research design
was prepared and used as the basis for a Texas Antiquities Code (TAC) permit application. Upon
approval of TAC permit 5443 and prior to field work, a review of the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) and Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) site files was
completed. This review revealed 60 sites within 1 mile of the project area. Site 41EP6, located
within the project area, is listed on the NRHP and is a SAL. Site 41EP6 is also listed within the
Castner Range Archeology District along with 58 of the previously mentioned sites. Eighteen
previous archaeological surveys and testing projects have been recorded within one mile of the
project area. Subsequent fieldwork by aci consulting included pedestrian survey and intensive
backhoe trenching in areas of soil development and locations with a potent for buried cultural
remains. Cultural material in the form of ceramics and lithic debitage was noted on the surface.
Conditions within the project area suggested extensive land-altering modifications including, but
not limited to, infrastructure construction, modern trespassing activities, and previous intensive
archaeological investigation.
Archaeological investigations were guided by the process outlined in the TAC (13 TAC 26.20),
and were designed to assure compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act of 1966 (as amended) and the Antiquities Code of Texas. This project was completed under
TAC Permit Number 5443, and all efforts complied with current THC and Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA) guidelines for intensive survey. Meg Thornton acted as Principal
Investigator, and Jennifer Hatchett Kimbell served as Project Archaeologist.

1.1 Project Area
This project was conducted on state-owned land with access obtained by Blanchard Partners
Investments, LLC, pursuant to the TAC (13 TAC 26.20(2). The project area is located in El Paso
County in West Texas, on the north side of the city of El Paso; it is bounded on the north by the
Castner Dam borrow pits, on the east and southeast by Castner Dam, on the south by Diana
Drive, and on the west by Kenworthy Street (Figures 1 and 2). This project area is divided into
two sections, 16.8 acres in the northwest portion of the project area and 41.3 acres in the
southeast portion of the project area. These portions are separated by the dashed line on Figures 1
and 2.
The current setting of Site 41EP6 is somewhat unique. The 41.714 acres of the originally
designated Northgate site exists within a Range Dam Flood Easement established by the US
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). This easement was established by the USACE to provide
ample space for the flooding of the property necessary for the pooling of the dam. During times

1

of flooding, this area fills with water and rises behind the dam until it reaches the spillway
elevation and begins to overflow. The USACE identified the elevation of the pooling surface and
overlaid a flood easement on the affected properties below that elevation for the right to allow
water to pool within those boundaries as part of the dam. Therefore, no properties or structures
are allowed to be built within this Range Dam Flood Easement.
The original Northgate Dam construction was completed in 1973 with a modification in 1986 to
raise the height to 67 feet. The core of the dam is earthen with a rock and soil foundation. The
dam is 3,325 feet long and drains an area of 6.8 square miles. Its capacity is 1,038 acre feet with
a normal storage of 120 acre feet, and the maximum discharge is 29,000 cubic feet per second.
The original environment of this site was a natural pooling area for water pouring off of the
Franklin Mountains down through Fussleman Canyon. This run-off would have carried large
amounts of sediment and debris and created a high likelihood of buried materials in this particular
location. At the same time, this high-energy erosion also would create erosional channels
throughout sites that may have been located at higher elevations to the west. Both erosion and
deposition play a constant and critical role in the development and preservation of site 41EP6.
O’Laughlin (1980) suggests that a hiatus in alluviation occurred between A.D. 1000 and the late
1800’s for the eastern alluvial slopes of the Franklin Mountains; however the deposition rates
calculated by Ruhe (1967) do seem to correspond well to many of the sites buried under
approximately 10 cm of alluvium. Yet, in areas like the Northgate Dam location, very different
patterns emerge based on the site-specific characteristics and the dynamic nature of the location.

1.2 Environmental Setting
1.2.1 Physiography
The proposed project area includes approximately 58.1 acres, located in the westernmost portion
of Texas, in northwest El Paso, El Paso County. The site is located in the Rio Grande Valley,
within the Rio Grande Watershed, approximately 10 miles east of the Rio Grande River. The
physiography of this region in West Texas is known as basin and range and is characterized by
generally north-to-south trending mountain ranges separated by wide internal drainage basins or
bolsons. El Paso County lies over the Hueco Basin and is bordered by the Diablo Plateau to the
east.
1.2.2 Climate
El Paso County is hot in the summer and moderately cold in the winter. In winter, the average
temperature is 48 degrees F, although daytime temperatures often reach 55 to 65 degrees F.
Summer temperatures average 95 degrees F in the daytime but fall to about 65 degrees F at night.
Sunshine is abundant year round, and the climate is extremely arid. Rainfall is too light for the
growth of vegetation apart from desert plants; therefore, irrigation is necessary for farm crops,
gardens, and lawns. More than half of the yearly precipitation occurs in the summer months
during brief thunderstorms, and light snowfall occurs almost every winter but rarely covers the
ground. Dust storms and sand storms are easily formed by a moderately strong wind and are
frequent in the spring, especially in March and April. Although possible, they rarely occur at
other times of the year (El-Hage and Moulton 1998).
1.2.3 Flora
The vegetation type within the proposed project area is described as “Urban” (McMahan et al.
1984). The project area parcel has been an area of development, although low scrub brush now
fills the area (Figure 3). Previous site visits in the vicinity of the proposed project area (Hard et al.
1983) identified the presence of vegetation, including, but not limited to: Palmer amaranth
(Amaranthus palmeri), espanata vaqueros (Tidestromia lanuginosa), lechuguilla (agave
lecheguilla), prickly pear (Opuntia sp.), fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canascens), plains dozedaisy
(Aphanostephus ramasissimus), hairyseed bahia (Bahia absinthifolia), tarbush (Flourensia
cernua), many-bristlepectus (Pectis papposa), cowpen daisy (Verbesina encelioides), broom
snakeweed (Xanthocephalum sarothrae), spectacle pod (Dithyrea wislizenii), pinnate
tansymustard (Descurainia pinnata), hairypod pepperweed (Lepidium lasiocarpum), spurge
(Euphorbia sp.), bluestem (Bothriochloa sp.), six-weeks grama (Bouteloua barbata), bush
muhley (Muhlenbergia porteri sp.), spike dropseed (Sporobolus contractus), gyp phacelia
(Phacelia integrifolia), mescat acacia (Acacia constricta), milkvetch (Astragalus sp.), honey
mesquite (Posopis glandulosa), creosotebush (Larrea tridentate), and soap-tree yucca (Yucca
elata).

1.2.4 Soils and Geology
Soils of the proposed project area are classified in the Pajarito series (Figure 4). The soils in this
series are described as deep, pinkish-gray, loamy, calcareous, and moderately alkaline (SCS
1971). They are found on alluvial fans, in intermountain basins, and on terraces above the Rio
Grande flood plain in the northern and eastern parts of the county. The slope of this soil series
ranges from less than one percent to approximately three percent. The soils in this series are fine
sandy loam, well drained, moderately permeable, and susceptible to water erosion and blowing
(SCS 1971). Fertility and available moisture capacity are moderate (SCS 1971). One soil unit
occurs in the project area:
Pajarito association, level (PAA) – The Soil Conservation Service (1971) characterizes this
mapping unit as gently sloping on fans and level to nearly level on terraces above the Rio Grande
flood plain. Pajarito soils dominate this association, which also includes Agustin, Simona,
Bluepoint, Turney, Wink, and Mimbres soils. Pajarito soils are pinkish-gray on the surface,
friable, calcareous, moderately alkaline fine sandy loams about 18 inches thick. The subsoil is
described as light-brown, friable fine sandy loam to a depth of approximately 36 inches. The
soils in this association are susceptible to water erosion and blowing if not protected.
Archaeological projects from the 1970s and 1980s (Gerald 1972; O’Laughlin and Greiser 1973;
Hard 1983) also provide information from trenching and excavations. Typically, the stratigraphy
consists of sandy loams and gravels. The surface levels contain alluvial gravels and cobbles, and
strata of this type are interspersed with dense layers of brown and tan sands with fewer cobbles.

The Franklin Mountains are a north-south trending fault block that has tilted westward. In this
mountain block, formations from the Paleozoic to Holocene are represented (Harbour 1972).
Precambrian cobbles of quartzite, rhyolite porphyry, limestone, basalt, and granite are the
principle sources of materials for chipped stone, ground stone, and hearth stone as previously
recorded (Hard 1983). Many of these materials are located in local arroyos and washed down
through Fusselman Canyon. These source materials occur in a wide variety of colors and provide
an array of textures for a variety of material type needs.
1.2.4 Water Resources
The project area is located on an alluvial fan extending from Fussleman Canyon and the Franklin
Mountains. In Fusselman Canyon surface water occurs as small intermittent springs coming from
the middle member of the Lanoria quartzite formation (McAnulty 1967). Large arroyos and
small braided channels leading into and across the site indicate that floodwaters also drain from
the canyons directly into the project area, which served as a natural holding pond and has now
been developed into a dam to utilize the original landform. Figure 1 highlights the largest of the
drainage channels across the project area and the largest area of sheet washing that has occurred.
It is likely that in the canyons, water-bearing sands could be reached by digging shallow wells.
Other canyons in the area, such as Indian Springs Canyon and Cottonwood Canyon, also contain
springs.
To the east/northeast of the project area, playas once held water for months after heavy, late
summer rains. Modern development has now depleted those available water resources both by
ruining original landforms and by heavy usage. Rainfall averages 21.2 centimeters (8.35 inches)
per year, but the distribution is uneven, making it undependable.

2.0 REGIONAL HISTORY AND CULTURE CHRONOLOGY
The proposed Diana Dr. development project area is located in the Trans-Pecos Texas culture
region. This region has been divided into various cultural periods and traditions, with
subdivisions based primarily on technologies and settlement patterns (Table 1). The following
will present a brief synthesis of the succession of cultures in the region and their possible
relevance to the proposed project area based on past research and current interpretations of
available data from previous work in this region, particularly in the vicinity of the project area.

2.1 Paleoindian
The arrival of humans in the New World occurred during the Paleoindian period, which dates
from 11,500-8,800 BP (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). As the Pleistocene period ended, diagnostic
Paleoindian materials in the form of Clovis, Folsom, and Plainview projectile points began to
enter the archaeological record. These points were lanceolate in shape and fluted for hafting to
wooden spears. Using the launching momentum from atlatls (spear-throwers), Paleoindian people
frequently hunted large game such as mammoth, mastodons, bison, camel, and horse (Black
1989). In addition to megafauna, Paleoindian groups likely harvested less daunting prey including
antelope, turtle, frogs, etc. Arguably, one of the oldest confirmed Clovis sites in North America is
the Aubrey Clovis Site (41DN479) in Denton County, Texas with a carbon date assay of 11,550
BP (Ferring 2001). Some evidence of nomadic hunters of megafauna has been recovered in El
Paso County. Clovis, Folsom, and late Paleoindian projectile points have been recorded during
surface collections in the Hueco Bolson (Carmichael 1986:7-11; MacNeish 1993:159,160;
Anderson and Carter 1985; Largent et al. 1991), suggesting the presence of hunting zones and
base camps. Studies of the prehistoric Texas environment suggest that Late Pleistocene climates
were wetter and cooler (Mauldin and Nickels 2001; Toomey et al. 1993), gradually shifting to
drier and warmer conditions during the Early Holocene (Bousman 1998). As megafauna
gradually died off during the shift to warmer climates, human subsistence patterns shifted toward
smaller game and plant foraging.

2.2 Archaic Period
Archaic trends in El Paso County indicate a broader spectrum of subsistence patterns than existed
during the Paleoindian period. Strategies leaned more heavily on gathering than on large game
hunting, and mobility was slightly more geographically restricted (Shafer 2001). Four temporal
phases make up the Archaic period in this region (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). These phases are
Gardner Springs (8,000-6,300 BP), Keystone (6,300-4,600 BP), Fresnal (4,600-2,900 BP), and
Hueco (2,900 BP-1,800 BP) (MacNeish 1993). This temporal scheme requires additional
diagnostic markers, and excavated sites with stratified deposits are rare, but the work of
Carmichael and MacNeish has provided archaeologists in this area with a solid point of departure
for interpreting a landscape that is heavily deflated and subject to intensive development and
looting.
2.2.1 Gardner Springs (8,000-6,300 BP)
The archaeological record has not yielded as much data on the Gardner Springs phase as on the
other Archaic subperiods. Projectile point styles that characterize this phase include Jay, Abasolo,
and Bajada (Anderson 1987; Beckett and MacNeish 1994). Small bands hunted smaller game and
gathered foods from numerous types of microenvironmental zones in the spring and summer.
Environments exploited in the fall tended to be riverine, basin floor, and mountain habitats. In the
winter, these people typically frequented the basin floor playas as well as higher elevations where
acorns and piñon nuts could be stored for long periods of time (Beckett and MacNeish 1994;
MacNeish 1993).
2.2.2 Keystone (6,300-4,600 BP)
Like the Gardner phase, the Keystone phase saw fairly static settlement patterns and similar
subsistence strategies. Several Keystone sites have suggested population increases, social stress,
and climatic changes. Projectile point styles indicative of this phase include Bat Cave, Pelona,
Shumla, Gypsum-Almagre, Amargosa, and Todsen. MacNeish states that this phase exhibits “a

9

subtle shift toward a more efficient desert foraging subsistence system as well as a possible
exploitation of more desert plants from more ecozones” (1989:689).
2.2.3 Fresnal (4,600-2,900 BP)
Significant pattern changes occurred during this subperiod, during which a shift from seasonal
camps to more semi-permanent base camps took place. Domestic plants such as maize, pumpkin,
and some squash began to take dietary precedence over hunted meat, according to C12-C13 and
N15 proportions examined in human burials (Brown et al. 1995). A higher quantity of recorded
Fresnal sites might also suggest a population increase during this phase. Projectile point styles
exhibited in the Fresnal phase consist of Fresnal, San Jose, Augustin, Chiricahua, and also Todsen
(Beckett and MacNeish 1994; MacNeish 1993).
2.2.4 Hueco (2,900-1,800 BP)
This phase saw a heavier reliance on corn, squash, amaranth, and beans, with a shift towards
more semi-permanent occupations of sites. Mesoamerican influence is present during the Fresnal
phase (Beckett and MacNeish 1994; MacNeish et al. 1993; MacNeish and Beckett 1987), but
these influences are more apparent in the Hueco phase, indicated by increases in observed
cultigens in the archaeological record (Holmes 2002). This phase also suggests seasonal
exploitation of desert basin resources (Graves and Peterson 1996; Mauldin et al. 1998). Projectile
point styles include Hueco, San Pedro, Armijo, and Hatch (Beckett and MacNeish 1994).

2.3 Formative Period
The presence of brownware ceramics marks the onset of the Formative period. This incorporation
of pottery into the relatively mobile lifeway indicates an important change in food preparation
and storage. This section will use chronological systems that fall within the Formative period,
divided into regional periods correlated with local phases that pertain to the project area (Miller
and Kenmotsu 2004). The five temporal designations that make up the Formative period in this
area are the Early Pithouse Period/Early Mesilla Phase (1,800-1,400 BP), Late Pithouse
Period/Late Mesilla Phase (1,400-1,000 BP), Transitional Pithouse Period/Doña Ana Phase
(1,000-600 BP), Pueblo Period/El Paso Phase (600-500 BP), and the Post El Paso Phase (500 BP
to European contact).
2.3.1 Early Pithouse Period/Early Mesilla Phase (1,800-1,400 BP)
The Mesilla phase is characterized by data recovered during large scale surveys in the Hueco
Bolson and Tularosa Basin (Carmichael 1986; Whalen 1977, 1978, 1980). Recorded sites indicate
short-term camps associated with larger playas of concentrated resources. The Early Mesilla
phase is very much a continuation of the mobile settlement patterns of the Late Archaic with the
addition of ceramics and a major population surge (Carmichael 1986). Ceramic assemblages
typically consist of plain brownwares in the form of bowls, deep bowls, tecomates, and shortnecked jars. Diagnostic lithics include San Pedro projectile points, oval basin metates, and onehanded manos.
2.3.2 Late Pithouse Period/Late Mesilla Phase (1,400-1,000 BP)
The population growth observed in the Early Mesilla continued to increase significantly in the
Late Mesilla (Whalen 1980). Sites from this phase are observed in both the basin floor and edges
of the Hueco Bolson. Aggregated pithouse villages such as Turquoise Ridge and Los Tules

formed at this time. Subsistence strategies centered around the gathering of wild plants and the
hunting of small game, particularly rabbits. Ceramic assemblages consisted primarily of plain
brownware ceramics in the forms of hemispherical bowls, deep bowls, tecomates, short-necked
jars, and ladles. Intrusive ceramics from neighboring Mogollon regions, such as Alma Plain,
Alma Nick-Banded, Three Circle Red-on-White, Three Circle Nick-Corrugated, and Mimbres
Styles I and II, have been documented at several Late Mesilla sites (Dering et al. 2001). Changes
in projectile point styles consist of corner-notched, expanding-stem arrow points, signifying a
transition to bow and arrow hunting strategies that complimented or replaced atlatl hunting during
this phase. However, wooden shafts with sharpened tips have also been recovered from Late
Mesilla contexts (Cosgrove 1947).
2.3.3 Transitional Pithouse Period/Doña Ana Phase (1,000-600 BP)
Diagnostic architectural elements from the Doña Ana Phase consist of rectangular pithouses as
well as small huts (Dering et al. 2001:48). The distribution of sites tended to rest along
mountainous outwash fans at the basin edge rather than the basin floor, possibly due to increased
corn consumption (Whalen 1994). Additional data gathered on new styles of metates and manos
also suggest a heavier reliance on corn processing (Carmichael 1986). Corn consumption was
steady, but corn was not necessarily grown locally, as it may have been traded during interactions
with more sedentary Mimbres communities (Shafer et al. 1999). Locally painted wares, such as
El Paso Bichrome and early style El Paso Polychrome, entered ceramic assemblages during the
Doña Ana Phase. Mimbres Style III Black-on-White ceramics are also very common in Doña
Ana components. It is possible that the Doña Ana phase was a local cultural manifestation that
was briefly incorporated into the Classic Mimbres regional system (Schafer et al. 1999).
2.3.4 Pueblo Period/El Paso Phase (600-500 BP)
This phase of the Pueblo period experienced growth in settlements, larger residential units, a
population increase, more specialized site types, increased ceremonialism, and more interaction
with surrounding cultural regions (Dering et al. 2001). Diagnostic architectural traits of the El
Paso Phase include the presence of surface pueblos. Motifs in rock art dating primarily to the El
Paso phase are not unlike symbolism found in other Pueblo period art (Dering et al. 2001). This
increase in ceremonial expressionism could be attributed to a heavier reliance on agriculture
(Dering et al. 2001) or may be a result of Mimbres influence from the Doña Ana phase (Shafer
1996). Subsistence data suggests more intensive use of domesticates than any previous period.
Floral inventories included corn (8- and 10-row cobs), beans, gourd, mesquite, prickly pear,
amaranth, tornillo, sunflower, yucca, etc. (Browning et al. 1993, Foster and Bradley 1984;
Whalen 1980). Diagnostic ceramic assemblages consist of classic or late-style El Paso
Polychrome jars with everted rims, restricted-orifice necked jars, and hemispherical bowls
(Perttula et al. 1995; Moore 1947; Wheat 1955). Intrusive diagnostic ceramics include Ramos
Polychrome, Villa Ahumada Polychrome, Chupadero Black-on-white, Las Lunas Smudged,
Playa Red Incised, St. John’s Polychrome, Fourmile, Pinedale, Pinto Gila, and Tonto
polychromes. This phase of the Pueblo period is considered the apex of socioeconomic
complexity in the Hueco Bolson, embodying numerous manifestations of the Southwest with
influences from Mountain Mogollon, Casas Grandes, and Salado cultures (Dering et al. 2001).
2.4.5 Post El Paso Phase (500 BP to European contact)
The abandonment of sites during the late Formative period has been a topic of much speculation.
It could be attributed to a shift in bison herd migration, climatic changes, internal conflict,

11

collapse of trading alliances, warfare, or a combination of variables (Holmes 2002; Dering et al.
2001).

2.5 Protohistoric Period
Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca and the remaining survivors of the Narvaez expedition were the
first Europeans known to have set foot in modern-day Texas; they landed on the Texas coast
following a shipwreck in 1528. Between 1528 and the late 1600s, Spanish excursions into what is
now Texas were limited. Europeans did not begin to settle the territory until the beginning of the
eighteenth century, and still the inhabitants of the region were mostly Native Americans until the
late 1700s. The Protohistoric period includes the first contacts between Europeans and Native
Americans, and in the El Paso area it pertains to the first Spanish accounts of the landscape in
present-day El Paso, continuing until more permanent Spanish settlement in the 1650s when
missions were built to convert the Sumas and Mansos. Europeans first entered the El Paso area on
April 28, 1598 when Don Juan de Oñate and a party of settlers and soldiers forded the Rio
Grande (Brown et al. 1995). The Spanish considered this region, now part of west Texas, to be
part of New Mexico.
The Manso, Suma, and Jumano Indians inhabited the El Paso Valley on both sides of the Rio
Grande River during the Protohistoric period. The Mansos lived in the area of modern El Paso
and to the north, and the Sumas lived south of El Paso. They subsisted primarily on fishing,
hunting deer and bison, gathering plants, and cultivating corn (Griffin 1983). The Jumano Indians
occupied the area east of present-day El Paso. They were primarily hunter-gatherers, but some
bands farmed land at La Junta (Holmes 2002). Some data suggests that a shift in site locations
might be due to more defensively planned sites (Gibbs et al. 2000). The material culture of Native
Americans in this area soon changed with the introduction of Spanish metals. The period is
concluded with the establishment of a strong Spanish presence in the region in the mid-1600s and
early 1700s. Sporadic encounters between the indigenous populations and Europeans occurred at
this time. Identifying this period archaeologically is problematic, since a clear set of material
culture associated with this period is lacking. Protohistoric sites may have a mixture of Late
Formative and Historic artifacts.

2.6 Historic Period
In the El Paso area, this period begins in 1659 with the establishment of Missión de Nuestra
Señora de Guadalupe at a place known as El Paso del Norte (now Ciudad Juarez), just south of
the Rio Grande from present-day El Paso. The mission and its associated settlements became an
important waypoint on the road from Mexico City to Santa Fe, and the European population of
the area grew relatively rapidly. The Pueblo Revolt of 1680, during which several Indian groups
in New Mexico rebelled against the Spanish, drove most of the Spanish population of northern
New Mexico south to El Paso del Norte, along with some Indian refugees. By 1684, the
settlement had spread far beyond the walls of the Missión de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe. The
San Lorenzo, Senuco, Ysleta, and Socorro Native American communities had established
permanent farming villages; however, strife with Spanish leaders, coupled with disease, drought,
and war, soon led to the abandonment of numerous settlements.
In 1821 Mexico, which included modern-day Texas, gained its independence from Spain. The
Mexican government encouraged Anglo settlement of the territory of Texas, hoping to protect the
border from land-hungry Americans. However, by the 1830s the mostly Anglo inhabitants of
Texas, dissatisfied with the Mexican government, began to seek their independence, which they
won in 1836. In 1845, the United States annexed Texas, but the southern border was debated;

12

Mexico claimed the border of Texas was the Nueces River, while Texas and the United States
claimed all the area south to the Rio Grande. This disagreement was one cause of the U.S. war
with Mexico, and in 1846 the United States seized the El Paso area and declared the Rio Grande
as the official border (Timmons 1990).
The inhabitants of the El Paso area maintained close ties with the Republic of Mexico both
economically and culturally and had little involvement with the Republic of Texas between 18361845 (during which time both Texas and Mexico claimed the land between the Nueces and the
Rio Grande). Following the Mexican War and the resulting Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848,
all the area north of the Rio Grande became part of the United States. A military force was sent
from San Antonio in 1849 to establish a military post in El Paso (Timmons 1990). This post,
established by a company of 275 soldiers, later became known as Fort Bliss. In 1850, San
Elizario, which had been a Spanish presidio town and lies fifteen miles southeast of modern-day
downtown El Paso, was named the first seat of El Paso County. By 1860, El Paso County had a
population of 4,456 and a strong agricultural base. In 1860 the census showed only fifteen slaves
in the area; however, in 1861 the county voted strongly in support of secession (Fehrenbach
2000). Confederate troops occupied Fort Bliss from 1861 to August 1862, when they surrendered
the fort to Union forces.
The Salt War of San Elizario, a bloody racial and political conflict, began in El Paso County in
1877 and ushered in a period of widespread lawlessness and unrest. Fort Bliss had been
abandoned following the Civil War, but it was reoccupied in an effort to re-establish stability in
the region (Timmons 1990). Despite the military presence, El Paso maintained its reputation for
vice until the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when the city finally passed ordinances closing
gambling halls and brothels. The arrival of the railroad in the 1880s helped to nurture the El Paso
economy, which grew steadily during the 1890s and the early twentieth century (Fehrenbach
2000). The Mexican Revolution also aided the El Paso economy, as border towns became supply
centers for the rebels south of the border. Over time, farming and cattle ranching increased in
economic viability. By 1929, cotton had became an important crop for the region, which also
supplied chickens and eggs to the regional market. Manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, and workers
all suffered through the Great Depression, but the increase in personnel and enlargement of Fort
Bliss during World War II helped the El Paso community recover. Fort Bliss remains an
important economic element of El Paso today.

3.0 PREVIOUS ARCHAEOLOGY
3.1 Inventory of Previously Recorded Sites and Surveys
A search of the THC Archeological Sites Atlas revealed that 59 archaeological sites have been
identified within one mile of the Northgate Archaeological Site, 41EP6. Fifty-eight of these sites,
as well as 41EP6, comprise the Castner Range Archaeological District, 76002021. The locations
have been digitized by the THC and are based on the UTMs provided by the archaeologists or
based on field maps. This type of mapping has led to some discrepancies in location information
and some uncertainty in the exact boundary information of previously identified sites and
centroids. At the Northgate site the first THC maps were based on hand drawings, then very
early UTMs and verbal descriptions; these variations have accumulated through time on the THC
maps. Based on a general understanding of what occurred during the land transfer from Fort Bliss
to the US Department of Education, it is believed that the Northgate Archaeological Site was
identified as the entire 58.1 acres of land nominated to the NRHP and transferred as a whole unit
(58.1 acres of land) (Denton per. comm. 2009). Prior to testing 41EP6, it was suggested that the
site boundaries as identified at THC may not accurately reflect either the original extent or the
current configuration of the site. In addition, due to the methods of digitization, it is possible that
the representation of the site location has shifted somewhat on the THC site file maps (Figure 5).
The fifty-nine sites that comprise the Castner Range Archaeological District certainly could form
the basis for a unique discussion on the comparison of types of material discovered within each
site. This could include a discussion of which sites were identified by the presence of surface
hearth features versus those consisting of only subsurface remains. An analysis of sites that
included surface materials as well as significant subsurface features, such as housepits and buried
ground surfaces, could also provide insight into future excavation and testing practices.
However, the data available for this type of comparison is questionable. In some cases, data
included in the site forms did not match data within the corresponding reports. In other cases,
certain field site numbers were utilized twice while others were not utilized. This project focused
strictly on the Northgate Site, 41EP6, and its direct environment; any larger analysis fell outside
the scope of the project, but revisiting this data could prove useful for future studies in the region.
Data utilized in the following discussion was extracted from reports of previous investigations,
and the feature designations used here reflect the original labels, unless an explanation of a
change in feature number is provided.

3.2 41EP6- The Northgate Archaeological Site
The Northgate Archaeological Site, 41EP6, is a Ceramic period village. Some researchers have
referenced this location as one of the last such sites available for excavation and investigation
(Miller and Gibbs 2003). However, previous to the current investigation, no one had evaluated
the integrity of the site. In addition, no one had compiled a comprehensive inventory of all the
archaeological work that had actually been conducted at the site. The site is located very near the
El Paso Water Protection Range Dam. Several surveys and test excavations took place between
the mid-1960s and the early 1970s during preparations for and construction of the dam (Bilbo
1972; Gerald 1972; Aten 1972; O’Laughlin and Greiser 1973).
Following the testing of 41EP6, additional work was conducted in the general area to identify
other sites that would be affected by the construction of the dam. The sites identified during
those surveys comprise what is known as the Castner Range Archaeological District (76002021)
(Gerald 1975; Hard 1983). In 1976 the property containing the Northgate Site was transferred
from the U.S. Army Fort Bliss to the U.S. Department of Education, UTEP. Upon receipt of this
property the Anthropology Department at UTEP began utilizing the area for training of
archaeologists. In 1984 the US Army Corps of Engineers (Rayl 1984) conducted an additional
survey adjacent to the dam areas but identified no other cultural materials, although removal of
borrow material was noted to have caused adverse impacts due to increased erosion; the
utilization of correct angles during dam construction was recommended to mitigate these impacts.
The annual utilization reports for the Northgate property written by UTEP have been found for
the years 1988-2003. During this fifteen-year period, two main archaeologists, Dr. Rex Gerald
and Dr. John Peterson, reported working on this property. Both taught field methodology
courses, taking students to the property to identify fire-cracked rock hearths, trash middens, and
pithouses. Unfortunately, the form utilized for these reports indicates no change over the fifteenyear period (US Dept of Education 1988-2003). There is no indication of the materials located,
no maps supplied, and no reports filed at THC or the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL). In the 1988, 1989, and 1990 report, there is a sentence that mentions excavations of
hearth material, but in another section it says no excavations were made. The reports throughout
this time period indicate evidence of trespassing and fence cutting, and Daudistel described
damage to the site on his 1991-1992 report (US Dept of Education 1988-2003). In 2000,
Peterson noted dumping of household goods along with continued trespass issues. No reports for
the nine years since that time are readily accessible, although the situation at the site has
apparently changed little.
Site 41EP6 deposition has faced additional dynamic changes since the 1970s and 1980s
excavations based on many of the reports. These changes are caused by the increasing level of
disturbance by off-road vehicles (ORVs) and other human-created impacts that include the results
of previous excavations. Fence posts, wire fencing and other debris left behind following the
excavations and that may have at one time served to protect the site have now fallen into disrepair
and serve to attract pedestrians and potential looters. In addition, this open space in a highly
populated section of town is heavily used by ORVs every weekend. These ORVs create trails,
increase erosion along arroyos, and create new gullies. Every fence around the area has been
breached in numerous places, and only two “no trespassing” signs are visible. During the ten
days aci archaeologists were present, a daily average of seven visitors to the project area was
observed, and on the weekend approximately fifteen people came within the project area
boundaries with at least 50 percent on ORV’s. It is also possible that the increase in population of
the surrounding area has pushed wildlife to this location. A very large number of rabbits have
built dens in this area, causing disturbance to buried cultural materials; large numbers of rabbits

16

and coyotes were seen across this property during the recent archaeological investigations. Any
one of these factors alone would not necessarily cause major impacts, but their cumulative effects
can significantly damage an archaeological site. Much of the top 15 to 30 centimeters of the soil
was completely disturbed; modern garbage was often found within the top 30 centimeters and
occasionally to depths of 65 centimeters.
Table 2 indicates all of the published and easily obtained information on previous excavations
within the boundary of 41EP6 (Gerald 1972; Aten 1972; O’Laughlin and Greiser 1973).
Locating unpublished records that may (or may not) remain in university labs and work areas is
difficult due to lack of continuity of students, deaths of faculty, lack of funding, and any other
number of reasons. However, following Table 2, a synopsis is provided of each project
conducted on 41EP6 for which records or published reports could be found. In some cases, these
reports were written several years following the field work, and the original field documentation
was not located. This inventory should help elucidate the information previously obtained from
41EP6 and connect the various excavations to present a clearer picture of what was present at this
site (Figure 6). The use of various mapping protocols and changes in technology since the mid1960s have made such a comparison challenging.

3.2.1 The Identification and Salvage Period
The first research efforts that occurred within the current project area were conducted in
November 1964 under a National Park Service permit. At this time, the U.S. Army owned or
managed this section of land, and the El Paso Archaeological Society and the El Paso Centennial
Museum conducted a pedestrian survey. According to records (Bilbo 1972) both organizations
collected “equal material samples.” Rock mounds and cultural remains were recorded as in
context and undisturbed. Based on the pottery the site was associated with the Mesilla Phase of
the Jornada Branch of the Mogollon Culture. However, due to the variety of pottery it could also
be attributed to the later El Paso Phase. The pottery types recovered are listed here:
Mimbres Classic Black on White
Mimbres Bold Face
El Paso Brownware
Chupadero Black on White
Alma Plain
Playas Red and Incised (Bilbo 1972).
After this first visit the site lay undisturbed until a burial was seen eroding from a small wash
within the site boundaries (Bilbo 1972). The El Paso Archaeological Society again received a
grant from the NPS to excavate this and an additional burial discovered in March 1966. The
burial was in a reclining flexed placement, head between knees; the hands were folded across the
abdomen in one and the feet in the other. Leslie Davis (Appendix III in Gerald 1972) supplied a
brief letter report based on observing the exhumation, and no detailed analysis was conducted on
the skeletal materials. The remains indicated the individual was a young adult female with no
traumatic or chronic pathology, and dental morphology indicated that stone ground food was a
major part of the diet. The redistribution of phalanges was post-mortem, most likely due to
rodents. There is no clear-cut evidence this was an intentional burial; however the excavation and
preservation techniques were inadequate to salvage the skeleton. Additional recommendations
are also provided, including recommendations in the event an additional burial is discovered and
further analysis of the skull, teeth, and long bones, left hand, left foot, and the pelvic fragments,
as well as the dirt from the skull. This would appear to contradict the statement that the
excavation was inadequate to salvage the skeleton; however no additional correspondence
regarding this material or any information about the second burial was recovered during our
records search.
During the excavations of these burials, further examination of the rock features in the 300-x500- meter site (then identified as CA1B) was conducted. Each feature is described as containing
“hundreds of fist-sized, angular, fire-cracked rocks/ fire-charred soil/ small pottery sherds” (Bilbo
1972). The pottery recovered included:
El Paso Polychrome Undecorated (86.7%)
El Paso Polychrome Decorated (6%)
Mimbres Black on White (3.6%)
Ramos Polychrome (1.2%)
Chupadero Black on White (1.2%)
Casa Colorado Black on White (1.2%)
The feature sizes average approximately 5 meters in diameter. Bilbo (1972) points out that no
site map was created at this time, except for the plotting of the burials and the two excavated rock
features. The rock features are characterized by an equal distribution between quartzite and
igneous rock and a very small amount of sedimentary material (approximately 2 percent). This
differs from the composition of the natural site area; however, approximately 700 meters west

21

there is a large accumulation of the same types of rock where it is likely this material was
obtained.
There was no recovery of lithic materials, although the EPAS survey field notes indicate that two
private general surface collections were known (Bilbo 1972). The site was described as
containing a layer of “dark silty refuse bearing material which thinned out towards the edges of
the areas of occupations” (Lehmer 1948 reference in Bilbo 1972).
Bilbo (1972) monitored the site between 1966 and 1972, observing an increase in vandalism of
the surface features. During this period additional material was also collected, including faunal
remains, identified as goat or sheep, from Feature 24 (although number designations change
between Bilbo’s earlier report and the 1972 report).
3.2.1 The Testing Period
In 1972, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers decided to proceed with the Range Dam project, and
the National Park Service contracted with the Texas Archeological Salvage Project to conduct
evaluation services for the Northgate Site (Aten 1972). This evaluation included identifying the
extent of the site, the chronological and cultural periods within this site, the context, scientific
questions that might be answered by this site, and the evaluation of loss if this site is destroyed.
Finally, based on the imminent destruction of this site, Aten identified additional studies that
would be required and the cost of those studies. In addition, the Northgate Site had just been
listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. [Please note the nomination was
completed prior to the evaluation phase.]
Aten (1972) found that prehistoric archaeological materials that might be affected by construction
covered an area of approximately 326,000 square meters (80.6 acres) in two areas, although the
densest concentrations of artifacts covered much less ground. To the west of the main village
site, an area used for movement of contractor’s equipment correlated with a portion of the artifact
scatter, and the main village area was located in the eastern portion of the site. In addition, several
trails (or roads) bisect the site. These trails are still present and were mapped during the 2009 site
testing. Some of these trails are early ranch roads, and some were expanded or added to during
the military use of the area.
The archaeological remains in the western portion of the site were not mapped in detail in the
1972 report, but three “essential facts” are identified by Aten (1972). First, cultural remains are
seen as dense concentrations of individual burned rock hearths, rather than as mounds of many
hearths. In addition there are possibly one or two midden circles, and ceramics are virtually
absent in the area, indicating that this portion of the site may be chronologically or culturally
unrelated to the main village area. Second, the entire equipment movement area was located on a
portion of the site and should be relocated beyond the extent of cultural remains. Finally, Aten
proposes that excavation of the site portion correlating to the equipment movement area might be
a more efficient solution than relocating the equipment movement area, as site features appeared
to be largely confined to the surface and could be quickly excavated.
In the main village area to the east, Aten’s data indicates five focal points, although temporal
relatedness can not be determined. These remains cover approximately 140,000 square meters
(34.6 acres). The remains in this area are located at a depth of approximately 30 centimeters.
Aten (1972) states that “the village occupation was limited to the buried surface although certain
features have been eroded by sheet wash and wind, the higher features have been eroded and
truncated with their contents being scattered about the immediate area of the feature.” Regardless

22

of this erosion, Aten argues that the village area is well-preserved and covers approximately
40,000 square meters (9.8 acres).
There is also a small section of land that lies between the western outlying remains and the
remains of the main village and that has been graded. Information that could have been obtained
from this location has been destroyed by intense surface disturbance. This area is crossed by one
of the access roads and a telecommunications/power line and may have been a construction
staging area in the past.
During Aten’s investigations, researchers identified 181 burned rock hearths and hearth mounds
in the main village area, possible jacal pithouses (shallow), pithouses (deep), one out-of-context
disturbed human burial, midden circles, and deep hearths. Table 3 contains a synopsis of the
material recovered from the excavation. Aten (1972) grouped the ceramics into three main
classifications which are further summarized: general collections including surface material and
trench material, subsurface materials from excavations, and hearth circle “surface tests”.
Aten’s testing illustrated the complexity of the site within a couple of areas, particularly Feature
183, a pithouse feature bisected by Aten’s Trench 3 (Figure 7). The area he identifies as the
village area appears to be located in the eastern section of the site; however, the amount of testing
completed did not sufficiently demonstrate the extent of that complexity throughout the entire site
boundaries as nominated to the NRHP. [As we will show in our survey, the area Aten describes
as the village area is largely included within the newly proposed boundary.]
In 1972 and 1973 additional survey was conducted in the southwest corner of the site area where
the Range Dam Spillway was going to overlap the site boundaries (O’Laughlin and Greiser
1973). This project excavated 200 2.5-x-5-meter units. Two hearths occurred within this random
sample. The sample of material, including fire-cracked rock hearths, sherds, and lithic debris
sparsely scattered over the surface, indicates activity areas for food production from the Mesilla
Phase (900-1100 A.D.)

An additional excavation was conducted within the Castner Range Archeological District (Hard
1983, fieldwork in 1978), and site 41EP2877 was excavated. In an area with a few dispersed firecracked features and with a high density of sherds and lithics, Features 7 and 11 resulted in the
discovery of a small house feature. Hard compares this structure with other house features from
the Mesilla phase, demonstrating that there is wide variation among the buildings, including the
feature found at 41EP6. Perhaps of most interest in Hard’s (1983) report is his discussion of the
fire-cracked rock features and the potential roasting places that may have been utilized by the
aboriginal groups that resided at 41EP2877 and 41EP6. It is likely that Agave lecheguilla and A.
neomexicana (agave-mescal), yucca and sotol were roasted in some of the fire pits that then
create the archaeological signature of fire-cracked rock features. Hard (1983) also suggests that
many of the ceramics found nearby likely served a function related to the fire pits and were used
as scoops for the removal of material from the pits. Some of the isolated ceramics from different
temporal periods discovered near the features may be a result of inhabitants collecting found
sherds for such a purpose.
The Northgate Site was revisited in 1984 (Rayl 1984) to evaluate additional construction on the
Northgate Dam to raise the height of the structure. The proposed impact included the use of
borrow material. The plan included the continued use of existing haul roads and the maintenance
of slopes to reduce erosion. Gully erosion had already begun to intensify in the Northgate site
since the erection of the Northgate Dam, and attempts were made to stabilize the borrow area to
help reduce erosion. Recommendations were also made for gully plugs and rip rap; however,
there is no evidence either of these efforts were made. Dr. Rex Gerald conducted the survey for
this project and personally communicated that no cultural materials were found within this project
area (Rayl 1984).
A compilation of previous research conducted at the Northgate Site indicates that, rather than
comprising one large continuous site, Northgate likely represents a number of smaller, possibly
unrelated sites. Some areas of the site, such as those investigated by Rayl (1984), contain no
cultural features, while other sections contain high concentrations of artifacts and large features
such as the house remains labeled as Feature 183 (Aten 1972). This suggests that a closer
evaluation of the occupation areas within the site could help to clarify boundaries, aiding in the

26

management of the cultural resources, and could improve understanding of the culture history of
the region.

4.0 SURVEY METHODS
4.1 Methodology
4.1.1 Subsurface Examination
Survey methods complied with THC/CTA survey standards for the overall project area. Backhoe
trenching was conducted to determine the potential for deeply buried remains and to determine
the integrity of the soils in this area. Three areas were avoided with the backhoe trenching: those
areas with little potential for deeply buried cultural material, previously excavated areas, and
areas with a high degree of disturbed integrity.
First, during a field visit conducted on July 2, 2009, some areas of consolidated desert pavements
resulting from extensive erosion were noted. These areas typically have little potential for buried
cultural deposits. In addition, areas with a high degree of water erosion, such as arroyos and
drainage channels, also have little chance of buried or intact buried deposits. Trenching was not
conducted in these low-probability areas.
Secondly, the areas in Figure 6 that had been previously excavated, such as borrow pits for the
dam (although those were identified as north of the site) or for field schools between 1976 and
1987, were avoided. If an area had the potential to be either a cultural feature or an area of
previous excavation, it was examined by a small trench to ensure that no feature was overlooked.
Finally, areas of high disturbance were avoided. From all records it is clear this area has been and
continues to be utilized by off-road bikers, hikers, dog owners, and assorted other public as a
recreation area. Distinct roads have been worn into the surface of the ground, disturbing any
surface and subsurface features, and no trenches were excavated within these areas. This
prevented wasting time and money on testing heavily-disturbed areas and helped to protect
Blanchard Partners LLC and UTEP from any potential issues with open excavation pits in welltraveled pathways. All open pits were filled as quickly as possible. In rare occasions it was
necessary to leave a trench open overnight; these trenches were fenced, and signs were posted.
These trenches were subsequently filled as soon as possible.
All location data for previously existing trenches, new trenches, and identified features (modern,
historic, or prehistoric) was collected with a sub-meter accurate Trimble GeoXT GPS unit. This
data was collected and provided in both digital and hard form to TARL staff to assist in
accurately mapping boundaries of previously recorded sites. Hand-drawn field maps were also
completed of profiles of all trenches excavated to demonstrate stratigraphy and any evidence of
buried soils, disturbance, and any features present. The variety of documentation was critical for
the recordation of this project.
4.1.2 Pedestrian Survey
A pedestrian survey of the APE was conducted to supplement the backhoe trenching. The
pedestrian survey was used to help determine locations for backhoe trenching and to help
establish the new site boundaries based on artifact densities. In addition, the pedestrian survey
was utilized to identify any surface fire-cracked rock features that might be located within the

27

project area. The project area was generally walked in parallel transects spaced no greater than 30
meters apart, although many areas were walked in much closer transects and areas with very
heavy disturbance were not surveyed. If any surface artifacts were found, the artifacts were
identified and the coordinates were recorded to help determine the backhoe trench locations. In
addition, areas that appeared to be trenches from previous excavations were mapped with a
Trimble GeoXT and utilized to determine additional new backhoe trench locations.
There was a low probability that historic sites existed within the project area. General Land
Office Plat maps and old county road maps were used in conjunction with USGS maps to
determine property boundaries and the potential location of historic sites. If any historic sites had
been found within the project area, then archival research would have been conducted to
determine the nature and chronology of the occupation. All newly discovered historic sites would
have been recorded at TARL, and the sites would have been assessed for potential significance.
The data collected from the sites would have been integrated into the present understanding of
local and regional history.
As surface features were encountered, artifacts were field identified, or, in the case of large
artifact scatters, a random sample was field identified in order to quantify the density of the
scatter and the types of artifacts present. This was a non-collection survey, and artifacts were not
collected during any part of the project.

5.0 ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY RESULTS
The entire 58.1 acre area was subject to an intensive archaeological survey. One-hundred-two
backhoe trenches were excavated, and these were supplemented by a pedestrian survey (Figure 9;
Appendix A). Four trenches yielded artifacts, while the other ninety-eight trenches were devoid
of cultural material. It became clear during this investigation that much of the project area
exhibited evidence of landscape modification (Castner Dam) (Figure 8) and public development
(Sue Young Park and Veterans Hospital) (Figures 10 and 11). However, one section of the project
area still retained intact site deposits that included surface and subsurface materials.

Trench Descriptions
The trenches within this project area were excavated to depths ranging from 90 centimeters to
180 centimeters (Appendix A). Profiles of typical negative trenches from the project area are
provided in Figures 12 through 14. The trench profiles were fairly uniform and soil colors
remained relatively constant, although gravel content changed and could be seen at varying
depths. This is likely due to varying erosional channels seen throughout the project area (Figure
9). aci archaeologists mapped the largest drainages with the GPS to include on the site map;
however, the hundreds of small drainages and channels continuing from these large drainages
were not mapped. Intrusive fill is noted in several of the trenches, particularly in the northwest
portion of the project area. Modern refuse was also noted at levels up to a depth of 40
centimeters below surface in four trenches (Appendix A). Small amounts of historic debris was
noted across the surface, although it was not recorded in a systematic fashion. The project area
has been used as a dumping area for many years, and the debris dumped has retained no
contextual information; due to extensive erosion across the southeastern portion of the project
area, even specific dumping episodes could not be identified.
Trench 51 is one of the four positive trenches, and its profile demonstrates the basic stratigraphy
seen across the site (Figure 15). Trench 54 (Figure 16) is also very similar, with fire-cracked
rock, burned rock and some charcoal found within the first 50 centimeters. The cultural materials
are all found within the fine loamy sand that varies in depth from 30 to 70 centimeters below
surface depending on the trench’s location relative to drainages. Beneath the cultural horizon lies
a very similar fine loamy sand with an increase in gravels and rocks, and beneath that lies a level
of fine loamy sand and fine gravel.
Proposed 16.8 Acre Construction Parcel
A smaller 16.8-acre parcel in the northwestern portion of the project area has been identified as
the area proposed for construction. In this 16.8-acre area, no artifacts were encountered on the
surface or subsurface. Much of the 16.8-acre area has been scraped and filled or has suffered
from sheet erosion (denoted on Figure 9). Within the 16.8-acre area, thirty-four backhoe trenches
were excavated, and all were negative for cultural materials. It is aci consulting’s conclusion that
no portion of 41EP6 is located within the northwest portion of the project area.
Fire-cracked Rock Features
During previous investigations (Aten 1972; Gerald 1975) many fire-cracked rock features were
identified. At the time of this project these features were certainly not as apparent as they may
have been in the late 1960s and early 1970s. At this time the heavy recreational use, erosion, and
flooding has taken a toll on a majority of features. Eight areas were identified as being potential
fire-cracked rock features. These features did not have any darkened soil or any dense scatter of
artifacts, only a collection of possible fire-cracked rock. These potential features were bisected to
test the possibility of these being cultural phenomena. All eight of these features were negative
for additional cultural material; there was no charcoal or darkened soil beneath the surface and no
additional artifacts. Due to the usage of this area as a holding pool during flooding it is likely that
much of the surface material, including the fire-cracked rock, has been moved, and once-intact
features are no longer identifiable on the surface.

Cultural Material
The first artifacts were encountered beginning just west of the Powerline Access Road (Figure 9).
A small artifact scatter composed of approximately twenty El Paso Brownware sherds was
located primarily in an open area surrounded by mesquite, with small drainages located in the
vicinity. Three trenches (46, 84, and 83) were excavated in close proximity to this artifact scatter,
and no subsurface remains were discovered. These artifacts were also located directly adjacent to
the Powerline Access Road. This road is believed to have served as a ranching road and was then
utilized by the military as a range road. This road is now commonly used by pedestrians and
ORV’s, as well as other vehicles accessing the project area for various reasons. The artifacts
found in this location retain less information useful for interpreting Site 41EP6 than would similar
artifacts found in more intact contexts.
Additional isolated materials consisting of flakes and brownware sherds were located within
drainages across the landscape, but they retain little contextual information. The context is lost
by erosion, bioturbation, or other post-depositional processes. During survey the density of these
artifacts was noted, and any area with a tight scatter was tested by a backhoe trench.
A revised boundary for 41EP6 is proposed based on a relatively high density of artifacts in
conjunction with four positive trenches as well as a reduced amount of erosion activity. The
density of material included an average of 3-4 artifacts per 5 square meters. A much more dense
concentration of artifacts was located around trench 51. The artifacts encountered include a mix
of lithic flakes and body ceramic sherds (primarly El Paso Brownware and unidentified grayware)
(Appendix B). No diagnostic stone tools were recovered throughout the entire project.
Trenches 49, 51, 54, and 60 were positive for subsurface cultural material (Figure 9). Trench 49
had one historic ceramic found at a depth of 10 centimeters below the surface. This artifact is not
related to 41EP6, but rather to the historic and modern dumping episodes. Trenches 54 and 60
both had subsurface ceramics consisting of El Paso Brownware found at a depth of 30
centimeters below the surface. Trench 60 had one body sherd, and Trench 54 had 20 sherds.
Trench 54’s relatively high number of sherds in a small area may be indicative of a single broken
vessel (Appendix B).
Trench 51 was the location of the highest concentration of material. This area contained the same
types of materials identified in Aten (1972) from Feature 183. This included a mix of ceramics
consisting of El Paso Brownware, a few fragments of Mimbres Black on White, and
unidentifiable grayware and brownware (Figure 17 and 18). There were no Chupadero sherds
identified in the project area. (Given their distinctive color and the amount of pedestrian traffic in
the project area, any items of this type resting on the surface could easily have been collected by
casual visitors.) The majority of material recovered in this area clearly dates to the Mesilla phase
(A.D.400 – 1100). Temporally later material such as El Paso Polychrome ceramics from the El
Paso phase are found in very small amounts. Overall, it is difficult meaningfully discuss these
ceramics due to their highly fragmentary nature and the relatively small sample size.
No diagnostic lithics were recovered during the testing and survey at 41EP6. One possibility for
the lack of diagnostic material could be related to surface collecting by casual visitors. However,
few diagnostic tools had been discovered previously at 41EP6, although a collection of cores,
scrapers, and hammerstones were previously recorded. The same types of raw material were
recovered during the recent excavations that were reported from previous projects. These
materials are primarily rhyolite and quartzite, both readily available in the immediate vicinity of
the project area. Some granite was also utilized for flaking material, and, although granite

35

grinding tools were reported from Feature 183 (Aten 1972), no evidence of such implements was
observed during this project.

6.0 CONCLUSION AND MANAGEMENT PLAN
aci consulting completed an intensive archaeological examination of a 58.1-acre Diana Drive
property for this report. The backhoe trenching confirmed that there are no subsurface materials
within the 16.8-acre area proposed for construction and aided in the establishment of a new
boundary for the National Register Site 41EP6, including approximately 7.8 acres. This revised
boundary includes the four positive trenches as well as a relatively dense concentration of surface
artifacts. House Features 183 (Aten 1972) and the one partially-documented burial from previous
investigations (Davis 1972 in Gerald 1972) are also included within this proposed boundary.
This boundary was submitted to the Board of Regents of the University of Texas System, who
submitted it to the THC. The THC and Archeology Advisory Board voted on amending the
current boundary from the current 58.1 acre site boundary to the newly submitted 7.8 acre
boundary on January 29, 2010 at their Quarterly meeting in Austin, Texas. This amendment was
approved unanimously and a metes and bounds survey was conducted and submitted to finalize
the paperwork. It is recommended that an updated NRHP nomination form be submitted to the to
the Keeper of NRHP to update their files and the National Register Information System.
aci consulting recommends that the new boundary of the 7.8-acre parcel be securely fenced to
protect the site from being further damaged from modern disturbances, especially ORV’s. This
will also help prevent looting, bioturbation, and other inadvertent impacts. This fence will be
monitored for vandalism and damage and will be maintained in good condition.
Should the UT system sell the 7.8 acres on which site 41EP6 is located, either the UT system or
the new owners should notify the THC of the sale. In addition, any potential private individuals
or corporations that purchase this land should notify the county clerk of their ownership of this
landmark.
It is the opinion of aci consulting that developing a protection, preservation, and management
plan for a site that has been sitting largely unprotected for 37 years would be to the benefit of the
resource. aci consulting recommends that construction be allowed within the 16.8 acre footprint
identified in the northwest part of the property following the steps for protection and preservation
laid out within this report.
