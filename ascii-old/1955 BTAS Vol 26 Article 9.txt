EXCAVATIONS NEAR GRAN QUIVIRA,
NEW MEXICO
EARL GREEN

Part of the program of the 1954 field school operated by
The Museum, Texas Technological College, consisted of
general reconnaisance in the east-central New Mexico area.
The material considered in this report concerns a single
circular pit-house which was dug near the Gran Quivira
National Monument.
The site is approximately two miles northwest of the
Monument and is near the northern boundary of the Homer
Jackson ranch. There are no definite indications of prehistoric dwellings in this locality; however, a single pit-house
was discovered in pipe-line trenching operations in 1953
and was excavated under the direction of Dr. Fred Wendorf,
who also selected the spot where the pit-house described
here was found. In this case, the choice of locating a test
trench was based on a concentration of holes made by
burrowing animals.
DESCRIPTION OF PIT-HOUSE
The pit-house is almost perfectly circular and has a diameter of 15 feet with an average depth of 33 inches (Fig. 8).
A bench or strath was cleared off around the top of the
wall for a distance of 16 to 18 inches but there were no
indications of posts other than in the pit itself. The pit was
dug down into a thick caliche bed, and rough surfaces on
both the wall and floor were smoothed with clay plaster.
There were four large center post holes arranged in a
rectangular pattern, but the rectangle was not oriented
with the cardinal directions. In addition to the four large
center posts, there were several small holes around the
edge of the floor and a few holes placed horizontally in
the wall. Other than the location of the small holes at the
edge of the floor, no definite pattern could be ascertained.
The centrally located fire pit was roughly rectangular
in outline and had a built-up rim approximately 2 inches

above the general level of the floor which slopes centripetally from the wall. There was only a small quantity of
ash near and in the fire pit but the clay bottom and rim
were baked to a reddish-brown color.
During excavation of the room, potsherds were found
from the surface downward, with increasing frequency between the roofing material and the floor. The room had
not burned and none of the supporting posts were preserved; in fact, one of the striking features of the fill was
the absence of charred wood. Small particles of charcoal
did occur throughout the fill and were fairly common near
and on the floor. Other indications of fire were two large
pieces of burned roofing clay and one mass of charred
corn found near the floor.
MATERIAL CULTURE
Material culture from the circular pit-house was essentially limited to worked stone and potsherds, and is given
in two categories for stratigraphic purposes. The first group
includes all of the material from the surface down to the
top of the roofing clay, and the second group contains
materials from the fill between the roof and the floor.

from A. D. 600 to 900, and it is concluded that the pit-house
was occupied around A.D. 600 or 700 or 900 at the latest.
