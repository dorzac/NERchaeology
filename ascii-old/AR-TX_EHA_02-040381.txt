Abstract
PBS&J conducted a cultural resources survey of the proposed Copperas Cove to Ding Dong 138 kV
Transmission Line project at the request of TXU Electric Delivery Environment, Safety, and Industrial
Health, between September 13 and 17, 2004. Dr. Maynard Cliff served as Principal Investigator for the
project. The field crew consisted of Elizabeth Sills, Russ Shortes, Phil Bishop, and Shelley Jameson. The
proposed transmission line is approximately 15 miles (24.1 kilometers) long, and the width of the
proposed right of way varies from 70.2 feet (21.3 meters) to between 16 and 23 feet (5 to 7 meters). A
total of 111.6 acres (45.2 hectares) was surveyed. The proposed line parallels an existing transmission line
for approximately .42 mile (.67 kilometer) and shares an existing right of way. In all, 63 shovel tests were
excavated along the proposed right of way in an effort to locate cultural resource sites. The survey
revisited one cultural resource site (41BL355) and recorded two new cultural resource sites (41CV1633
and 41BL1224). Site 41BL355 is an eroded small lithic scatter that was previously disturbed by the
construction of Farm-to-Market Road 116. Site 41CV1633 is a large chert procurement site. Site
41BL1224 is a twentieth-century historic site probably associated with ranching. This site consists of a
water trough, a pile of limestone rocks, a limestone slab, and a small scatter of historic artifacts. Since
none of the sites have been fully assessed at this time, their National Register status remains unknown.
Nevertheless, the current investigations clearly show that the portions of the three sites within the
proposed project right of way would not contribute to their eligibility even if any of the sites were later
determined to be National Register eligible. Therefore, no further assessment is recommended for any of
the sites at this time.
Based on these results, it is recommended that the proposed TXU Electric Delivery Copperas Cove to
Ding Dong 138 kV Transmission Line project be allowed to proceed within the designated right of way
without any further consultation with the Texas Historical Commission. However, if the proposed right of
way changes in the area of any of the recorded archaeological sites, then the Texas Historical
Commission should be notified and consultation should resume. Furthermore, if evidence of presently
undiscovered cultural remains is encountered during the construction of the proposed transmission line, it
is recommended that the discovery be evaluated by a qualified archaeologist who can provide
recommendations on how to proceed in accordance with federal and state regulations.

I. INTRODUCTION
PBS&J was contracted by TXU Electric Delivery Environment, Safety, and Industrial Health of Dallas to
conduct a cultural resources survey of the proposed Copperas Cove to Ding Dong 138 kV transmission
line between the existing Copperas Cove Switching Station, in Coryell County, and the Ding Dong
Switching Station, in Bell County, Texas (Figure 1). The proposed transmission line is approximately
15 miles (24.1 kilometers [km]) long. The width of the proposed right of way (ROW) for the Copperas
Cove to Ding Dong transmission line varies from 70.2 feet (ft) (21.3 meters [m]) in the northern and
south-central portions, to 40 ft (12.2 m) in the southern portion. In the north-central portion the width of
the ROW varies between approximately 16–23 ft (5–7 m) because it is located between Farm-to-Market
Road 116 (FM 116) and the property boundary of Fort Hood Military Reservation. An estimated 11 miles
(17.7 km) of the proposed route has a 70.2-ft-wide (21.3 m) ROW, approximately 3 miles (4.8 km) has a
16–23-ft-wide (5–7 m) ROW, and approximately 2 miles (3.2 km) has a 40-ft-wide (12.2 m) ROW. The
proposed new transmission line has a total project area of approximately 111.6 acres (45.2 hectares).
The proposed Copperas Cove to Ding Dong transmission line will consist of self-supporting, singlecircuit pole design (concrete and/or steel) with davit arms and/or braced posts. In addition, there will be a
small section of double-circuit poles as the line exits Copperas Cove Substation. The poles will vary in
height from 75 ft to 170 ft (23–52 m). The average pole height will be 85 to 90 ft (26–27 m). The
mechanized land clearing will impact depths of 6 to 24 inches (15–61 centimeters [cm]). To a much lesser
areal extent, the ROW will be impacted by the construction of tower footings that can impact average
depths of 10 to 25 ft (3–7.6 m) within a 2–5 ft (.6–1.5 m) diameter area, although individual pole footings
may go as deep as 25 to 30 ft (7.6–9.1 m).
The objectives of the survey were to (1) locate and record all cultural resources that may be within the
proposed ROW; (2) assess the significance of any such cultural resource sites and evaluate their potential
eligibility for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP); and (3) provide site-specific
recommendations for additional work, as appropriate.
These investigations were performed in compliance with the Texas Antiquities Code of 1977, as revised
through 1995 (Texas Natural Resource Code: Title 9, Chapter 191); the Federal Water Pollution Control
Act of 1972 (PL 95–500, 33 USC 1251 et seq.), as amended through 2002 (also known as the Clean
Water Act); the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (PL 89–665), as amended in 1974, 1976,
1980, and 1992; the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL 91–190, 83 Stat. 915 USC 4231,
1970); the Procedures for the Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties (36 CFR 800); the
Archeological Resources Protection Act of 1979; as well as the guidelines set forth by the Council of
Texas Archeologists and the Register of Professional Archaeologists.

II. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
PHYSIOGRAPHY AND GEOLOGY
The proposed Copperas Cove to Ding Dong transmission line is located in southwestern Coryell and
western Bell Counties. Physiographically, the project area lies within the Edwards Plateau region of
Texas. This is bounded on the east and south by the Blackland Prairies, on west by the Central Texas
Uplift and the North Central Plains, and on the north by the Grand Prairie (Bureau of Economic Geology
[BEG] 1996). This region forms the southernmost part of the Great Plains. The Edwards Plateau is
characterized by flat upper surfaces, with thin soils over hard limestone and dolomite, and box canyons.
Although the entire plateau is eroded, the margins are more deeply so, with the result that the plateau as a
whole is perceptibly higher that the surrounding areas. Elevations on the Edwards Plateau range from
450 ft (137 m) above mean sea level (amsl) on the east to about 3,000 ft (914 m) amsl on the west.
Geologically, the Cretaceous-age Walnut Clay, Comanche Peak Limestone, Edwards Limestone, and
Glen Rose Formation, underlie the area (BEG 1970, 1974). Recent alluvium and fluviatile terrace
deposits are found adjacent to streambeds along the ROW and include deposits of gravel, sand, silt, and
silty clay.
The Walnut Clay ranges in thickness from 38 to 45.7 m and is located throughout the project area. It
consists of clay, limestone, and shale. The Comanche Peak Limestone is fairly hard and contains mega
fossils. It forms midslope beneath the Edwards Limestone and ranges from 15 to 30.5 m in thickness. The
Edwards Limestone is pure except for abundant chert nodules, and it forms the upper area slope of high
areas and ranges in thickness from 4.8 to 18.2 m. Both the Comanche Peak Limestone and the Edwards
Limestone can be found in the project area at Sevenmile Mountain and Ivy Mountain. The Glen Rose
Formation consists of limestone, clay, marl, and sand. It ranges in thickness from 61 to 114 m and thins
northwestward (BEG 1970, 1974).

SOILS
The soil surveys for Coryell and Bell Counties were used to identify and characterize the soils that are
crossed by the proposed ROW. The proposed ROW is situated on four different soil associations. These
are the Eckrant-Real-Rock outcrop and the Slidell-Topsey-Brackett, both located in the northern part of
the project area in Coryell County; the Speck-Tarrant-Purves association located in the central portion of
the project area in Bell County; and the Trinity-Frio-Bosque association, located in the southern portion
of the project area along the floodplain of the Lampasas River (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil
Conservation Service [USDA, SCS] 1977, 1985).
The Eckrant-Real-Rock outcrop association consists of shallow, gently sloping to steep, cobbly and
gravelly, clayey and loamy soils and rock outcrops underlain by hard limestone. These soils are found on
the uplands. Eckrant soils are found on ridgetops, high divides, and in broad smooth areas and have a

II: Environmental Setting

mildly alkaline, very dark grayish brown cobbly silty clay surface layer, approximately 13 cm thick. The
subsoil can extend to a depth of 30 cm, and the underlying material is limestone. Real soils are found on
“steep side slopes of mountains and ridges” (USGS, SCS 1985:5) and have a dark brown gravelly clay
loam surface layer, approximately 13 cm thick. The subsoil consists of a dark brown, very gravelly clay
loam that can extend to a depth of 43 cm. The underlying material is strongly cemented limestone. The
Rock outcrop is limestone, 8 to 30 cm thick, but can extend up to 9 m. In places a thin mantle of soil
overlies the rock.
The Slidell-Topsey-Brackett association is located on the uplands, and is comprised of deep, gently
sloping, clayey, loamy, and gravelly soils underlain by marl and shale. Slidell soils are “gently sloping
valley fill areas along drainageways” (USGS, SCS 1985:7). They consist of a dark gray silty clay surface
layer to a depth of 15 cm below which is a dark gray silty clay that can extend to a depth of 46 cm. The
underlying material can extend to a depth of 203 cm and is light clay mottled with yellow and brown.
Topsey soils are found on broad, undulating uplands. They consist of a dark grayish brown clay loam
surface layer, approximately 20 cm thick. From 20 to 36 centimeters below the surface (cmbs) is a
grayish brown loam, while a light yellowish brown loam and silt loam extends to a depth of 71 cmbs. The
underlying material is loamy marl and shale down to 1.7 m. Brackett soils are found on undulating
uplands. They consist of pale brown gravelly loam to a depth of about 15 cmbs. The subsoil is a pale
yellow loam and the underlying material below 43 cmbs is interbedded loamy marl and shaly clay.
The Speck-Tarrant-Purves association is also located on the uplands and is comprised of “gently sloping
to sloping and undulating to rolling, very shallow to shallow, gravelly, loamy and clayey soils over
limestone” (USGS, SCS 1977:3). Speck soils have a very dark grayish brown gravelly clay loam surface
layer, approximately 20 cm thick. The subsoil is reddish brown clay in the upper part and dark reddish
brown clay in the lower part to a depth of 48 cmbs. The underlying material below 48 cm is limestone
bedrock. Tarrant soils have a surface layer of dark grayish brown silty clay, about 41 cm thick. The
underlying material is hard limestone bedrock. Purves soils have a dark brown calcareous silty clay
surface layer, about 36 cm thick, and the underlying material is also hard limestone bedrock.
The Trinity-Frio-Bosque association consists of deep, loamy clayey soils formed in alluvium on
floodplains. Trinity soils have a very dark gray clay surface layer, approximately 51 cm thick. The next
layer is black clay that can extend to a depth of 1.07 m. The underlying material is a dark gray clay down
to 1.83 m. Frio soils have a dark grayish brown silty clay surface layer, about 91 cm thick. This is
underlain by a brown silty clay that can extend to a depth of 2.24 m. Bosque soils have a grayish brown
clay loam surface layer, about 13 cm thick. Under this is a dark grayish brown clay loam that can extend
to a depth of 1.14 m. Below this is a brown clayey loam that extends to a depth of 1.52 m. The underlying
material consists of a light brownish gray silty clay, down to 2.03 m.

II: Environmental Setting

CLIMATE AND HYDROLOGY
Coryell and Bell Counties have a humid subtropical climate. The seasonal fluctuations of temperature are
extreme. During the spring, summer, and fall, air masses off the Gulf of Mexico dominate, while during
the winter the climate is significantly affected by polar Canadian air masses. Monthly temperatures for
Coryell County, recorded at Gatesville, Texas, for the period from 1951 to 1980, ranged from an average
of 46° Fahrenheit (F) in January, to an average of 84.5° F for August. The average daily maximum
temperature for this period ranged from 58.8° F for January to 97.2° F for July and August, while the
average daily minimum ranged from 33.2° F for January to 71.8° F for July (USDA, SCS 1985).
The average annual precipitation is about 825.8 millimeters (mm), about half of which (482.6 mm)
usually falls between April and September. January and December are the two driest months of the year.
The average rainfall during these months drops to 47 mm. During the period between 1951 and 1980,
January had the lowest rainfall, 46 mm, while May had the highest average rainfall, 116.3 mm.
Thunderstorms are most common in the spring, occurring on about 45 days out of each year. Snowfall
averages about 40.6 mm a year (USDA, SCS 1985).
The proposed transmission line lies entirely within the Brazos River basin. This basin is bounded on the
north by the Red River basin, on the east by the Trinity River and San Jacinto basins, on the west by the
Colorado basin, and on the south by the Brazos-Colorado coastal basin. The Brazos River is
approximately 840 river-miles (1,352 km) in length and drains an area of 42,800 square miles
(110,851.5 km2) (Texas Water Development Board 1997). The northern portion of the survey area is
located on the uplands and is drained by the headwaters of several unnamed tributaries of Clear Creek and
Gann Branch, both of which flow south into the Lampasas River. The southern portion of the survey area
is located within the floodplain of the Lampasas River. The proposed ROW crosses Reese Creek in the
southern portion of the project area. This creek also flows south into the Lampasas River.

VEGETATION AND FAUNA
The proposed ROW is located within the Cross Timbers and Prairies vegetational region as delineated by
Hatch et al. (1990). The Cross Timbers and Prairies region is bordered by the southern extension of the
Central Lowlands and the western extreme of the Coastal Plains. The vegetation along the proposed ROW
consists primarily of forbs, grasses, and cedar, post oak, and mesquite trees (Figures 2 and 3). Wild plants
were an important source of food for the prehistoric inhabitants of central Texas. Kindscher (1987) has
documented the use of 123 species of native plants used as food by historic Native Americans in western
North America. Among the wild plant foods listed by him are a number whose ranges extend into central
Texas and which could have been used by the prehistoric occupants of Coryell and Bell Counties. These
include wild onion (Allium canadense), prostrate pigweed (Amaranthus graecizans), giant ragweed
(Ambrosia trifida), New Jersey tea (Ceannothus americanus), Lamb’s quarters (Chenopodium
berlandieri), wavy-leafed thistle (Cirsium undulatum), buffalo gourd (Cucurbita foetidissima), white
prairie clover (Dalea candida), sunflower (Helianthus annuus), pricklypear (Opuntia macrorhiza), violet

wood sorrel (Oxans violacea), blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), fescue (Festuca spp.), junegrass (Koeleria
pyramidata), muhly (Muhlenbergia spp.), panic grass (Panicum spp.), maygrass (Phalaris caroliniana),
sand dropseed (Sporobolus cryptandrus), eastern grama grass (Tripsacum dactyloides), pussy-toes
(Antennaria spp.), sage (Artemisia spp.), curly-top gumweed (Grindelia squarrosa), knotweed
(Polygonum spp.), cinquefoil (Potentilla spp.), mountain mint (Pycnanthemum spp.), and goldenrod
(Solidago spp.).
The proposed ROW lies within the Balconian and Texan biotic provinces, as defined by Blair (1950). The
Balconian biotic province encompasses the northern portion of the proposed ROW and is a distinct
province that encompasses the Balcones Fault zone. The Texan biotic province encompasses the southern
portion of the proposed ROW and is a broad transitional ecotone between the grasslands of the western

portions of Texas and Oklahoma (the Kansan biotic province in the north and the Balconian biotic
province in central Texas) and the forests to the east (the Austroriparian biotic province). The vertebrates
and fauna from the two provinces are represented by a mixture of species from the Austroriparian and
Kansan biotic provinces. Animal species that may have been important to prehistoric and early historic
inhabitants for food, shelter, and clothing include bison (Bos bison), rabbit (Sylvilagus spp.), fox squirrel
(Sciurus niger), raccoon (Procyon lotor), Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), white-tailed deer
(Odocoileus virginianus), beaver (Castor canadensis), black footed ferret (Mustela nigripes), black bear
(Ursus americanus), and diverse rodent fauna. Important birds that occurred in the area include turkey
(Meleagris gallopavo), quail (Colinus virginianus), and the prairie chicken (Tympanuchus cupido) (Davis
and Schmidly 1994; USDA, SCS 1985). In addition to mammals, fish, such as gar (Lepisosteus sp.),
bowfin (Amia calva), pickerel (Esox sp.), catfish (Ictaluridae) and bass (Centrarchidae); and reptiles and
amphibians, including snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina), lizards (Iguanidae), snakes (Colubridae),
and frogs (Rana sp.), were also exploited.

III. CULTURAL SETTING
CENTRAL TEXAS CULTURE HISTORY
Coryell and Bell Counties lie within the northern portion of the Central and Southern Archeological
Planning Region as defined by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) (Mercado-Allinger et al. 1996).
More particularly, the area is located within the Central Archeological Region, which forms the northern
portion of the Central and Southern Planning Region of Texas. Based on previous research, the general
cultural history of this area can be divided into four primary chronological and developmental periods—
Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and Historic. These divisions are believed to reflect changes in
subsistence and cultural development as reflected by material remains and settlement patterns. Dating of
these periods follows the recent overview by Collins (1998) and is in accord with the revised dates for the
subdivisions of the Archaic period on the eastern Edwards Plateau proposed by Johnson (1994).

Paleoindian Period (ca. 9500 to 6500 B.C.)
Beginning prior to 9500 B.C. and continuing to about 6500 B.C., the Paleoindian period is the earliest
known prehistoric cultural interval in central Texas (Black 1989:25; Collins 1998:381–383). Coinciding
with the decline of the Wisconsin glaciation, the Paleoindian period is characterized by a relatively cool,
moist climate with a gradual drying trend after 8000 B.C. This period is sometimes described as being
characterized by a big game hunting tradition, due to a presumed reliance upon now-extinct Pleistocene
megafauna, most commonly Bison antiquus figginsi, as a food source during the earlier portion of the
period. However, it should be stressed that megafaunal remains are rarely found in association with
Paleoindian sites. Many archaeologists believe that this correlation between Paleoindian groups and the
hunting of megafauna has been exaggerated (Bryant and Shafer 1977; Johnson 1977). Ethnographic
studies of modern low-energy societies have suggested that hunter-gatherer groups relied more heavily on
gathered vegetal material than was previously thought.
Social organization in the Paleoindian period probably consisted of loosely structured, highly mobile
groups composed of several nuclear families, often referred to as “bands.” Few intact Paleoindian sites
have been recorded in this region of central Texas. Perhaps the most common type of Paleoindian site
reported in this area is a small, scant lithic scatter, typically located in upland areas along the divides of
major and minor watersheds. These archaeological sites are thought to represent transient campsites,
resource procurement loci, or retooling stations by band-sized or smaller groups. Rarer are
rockshelter/butchering localities such as the Montell Shelter (41UV3) in Uvalde County (Sellards 1952)
and the Levi site (41TV49) in Travis County (Alexander 1963). The deeply stratified Wilson-Leonard site
(41WM235), in Williamson County, contained one of the few Paleoindian burials discovered thus far in
North America (Collins 1998). Temporally diagnostic tool types associated with this stage include a
variety of finely chipped, sometimes fluted, lanceolate projectile points, such as the Clovis, Folsom, and
Plainview types (Black 1989:25). Projectile point styles suggested to date to the later part of the

450965/040381

13

III. Cultural Setting

Paleoindian period in central Texas are Wilson, Golondrina-Barber, and St. Mary’s Hall (Collins
1998:382). Many of these projectile points are made of nonlocal lithic materials.

Archaic Period (6500 B.C. to A.D. 600)
The Archaic period, beginning about 6500 B.C., appears to be characterized by a diversification in
subsistence patterns with an increased reliance upon the hunting of modern species of game, including
deer and rabbit, as well as the collecting and consumption of edible roots, nuts, and fruits. This
diversification in subsistence patterns is reflected in the artifact assemblages, with a proliferation of
projectile point types as well as the development of a variety of specialized stone subsistence tools.
Focusing specifically on the eastern Edwards Plateau, which includes Fort Hood and the current project
area, Johnson (1994) divide the Archaic into three major subdivisions: the Early Archaic, the Middle
Archaic, and the Late Archaic. The Late Archaic is further subdivided into a Late Archaic I subperiod and
a Late Archaic II subperiod. He proposes new dates for the Archaic, at least on the eastern Edwards
Plateau, and ties apparent cultural changes during this long period into a sequence of proposed Holocene
climate changes (Johnson 1994).
The Early Archaic period (ca. 6500 to 3600 B.C.) dates to the latter part of the early Holocene and the first
half of the middle Holocene, a period when bison were supposedly absent from central Texas. Despite the
continuation of the drying trend begun at the beginning of the early Holocene, the Early Archaic period
on the eastern Edwards Plateau has been characterized as a mesic climatic interval (Johnson 1994:Figure
2, 20–24). Two broad projectile point styles have been identified for the Early Archaic in this area, the
Early Barbed (also called Early Corner-Notched) tradition and the Early Split-Stem tradition (Johnson
1994:22). Johnson (1994:24) goes on to note that “the last Early Archaic dart points of the Edwards
Plateau were arguably the Uvalde and Martindale styles, as well as unnamed wide-stemmed dart heads
otherwise shaped very much like Martindale points.”
The subsequent Middle Archaic period (ca. 3600–2300 B.C.) is roughly coeval with the latter half of the
middle Holocene. Climatic conditions in central Texas during this period may have been moderately
moist, with a continuation of the drying trend begun during the early Holocene, culminating in the dry
Edwards Interval of the late Holocene (Johnson 1994:Figure 2, 25–26). This gradual drying trend was
probably accompanied by the eastward extension of the ranges of upland xerophytic plants, such as sotol,
yucca, and nopal. It has been suggested that the increased use of such plants as food explains the
development of a number of burned rock middens at the end of the Middle Archaic period on the eastern
Edwards Plateau (Johnson 1994:26).
Burned rock middens are “accretions of cracked and burned limestone rocks” (Weir 1976:135). Prewitt
(1981) suggests that they first appeared between 3000 and 2600 B.C., and their widespread use lasted to
about 1000 B.C. More-recent work shows that their use continued into the Late Prehistoric period (Black
et al. 1997; Johnson 1994:34–35). A number of hypotheses have been put forward in an attempt to
explain how these features formed, but they all seem to fall into four categories (Collins 1991:5):

450965/040381

III. Cultural Setting

1. Burned rock middens are the result of the construction of intersecting hearths on a stable
surface at a single locality over a long period of time;
2. Burned rock middens are the result of the centralized dumping of domestic refuse, including
broken hearth rocks;
3. Burned rock middens are the remains of earth ovens; and
4. Burned rock middens are accumulations of rock cooking slabs broken by heat.
Weir (1976) postulated that these features were the byproduct of acorn processing. According to Creel
(1977), the most overriding circumstance that characterizes burned rock midden location is their
proximity to water. The most recent overview of burned rock midden technology concludes that they are
the result of a variety of cooking techniques making use of hot rocks to store and transmit thermal energy
(Black et al. 1997).
The earliest dart point style of the Middle Archaic period on the eastern Edwards Plateau may have been
the Calf Creek/Bell type. Bison were apparently present in the region briefly at the beginning of the
Middle Archaic, and it has been suggested that intrusive hunters followed them into central Texas, from
the north or northeast, introducing Calf Creek/Bell points (Johnson 1994:24–25). Later, other dart point
styles appeared on the eastern Edwards Plateau, including Early Triangular and Morrill, followed by a
number of unnamed dart point styles with long and narrow rectangular stems, and finally, La Jita, Nolan,
and Travis points (Johnson 1994:Figure 2, 26–27).
As noted above, the Late Archaic period (ca. 2300 B.C.–A.D. 600) has been divided into two subperiods.
The Late Archaic I period (ca. 2300–600 B.C.) is largely coeval with the dry Edwards Interval in central
Texas, a period of reduced rainfall and higher temperatures (Johnson 1994:Figure 2). Despite this, human
populations appear to have increased in central Texas during this time (Johnson 1994:36). Burned rock
middens were deposited at many sites on the eastern Edwards Plateau during the Late Archaic I
subperiod, representing the residue from baking yucca, sotol, and other xerophytic plants that would have
been at their maximum range at this time (Johnson 1994:32–34). In the later part of the Late Archaic I
subperiod, bison may have again been present on the eastern Edwards Plateau (Johnson 1994:35). The
earliest dart point style identified for the Late Archaic I subperiod on the eastern Edwards Plateau is the
Bulverde point, which may be intrusive into central Texas from the north or northeast (Johnson 1994:29).
This was followed by Pedernales, Marshall, Montell, and Castroville styles.
The Late Archaic II period (ca. 600 B.C.–A.D. 600), corresponding to the middle part of the late Holocene,
witnessed the return of fairly mesic conditions to the eastern Edwards Plateau (Johnson 1994:Figure 2,
36–37). Xerophytic plant resources presumably declined as a result of moister climate, with a
concomitant decline in the deposition of burned rock middens associated with their exploitation. Bison
were apparently also absent from the eastern Edwards Plateau at this time. Dart point styles in use during
the Late Archaic II subperiod on the eastern Edwards Plateau included Marcos, Ensor, Frio, Darl, and
Figueroa types (Johnson 1994:Figure 2, 37). During this subperiod, Johnson (1994:37–39) sees
extraregional influence on central Texas from both the Southern Plains and the eastern United States. He

450965/040381

15

III. Cultural Setting

notes that Marcos dart points are very similar to points of the same age from the Southern Plains, while
later in the subperiod external influence appears in the form of “Gulf whelk shells, and atlatl weights
typically of exotic stone” (Johnson 1994:37). Residents of the eastern Edwards Plateau may have
contributed large and thin, bifacial corner-tanged knives and bifacial preforms of Edwards chert to the
Late Archaic II exchange network (Johnson 1994:38).

Late Prehistoric Period (A.D. 600 to European Contact)
The Late Prehistoric period (post–A.D. 600) is coeval with the later part of the late Holocene. Most of it
was characterized by a mesic climate on the eastern Edwards Plateau, with a short period of xeric
conditions from about A.D. 1200 to 1300–1400 (Johnson 1994:Figure 2, 41). Bison returned to the
Edwards Plateau at about this time and stayed even when the region returned to mesic conditions. This
period is marked in many parts of North America by the advent of incipient agriculture; however, in
central Texas, a hunting-gathering form of subsistence continued right to the end of the prehistoric period.
As a result of this, Prewitt (1981) has suggested that the term “Neoarchaic” be applied to this late period,
while Johnson (1994:39–41) has applied the term “Post-Archaic.” Distinctive assemblages of small
projectile points (i.e., arrow points) serve to divide the Late Prehistoric period into two phases, the Austin
and the Toyah.
The Austin phase (ca. A.D. 800–1300) is characterized by expanding-stem (Scallorn) and subtriangular
(Granbury) arrow points, serrated flakes, and Friday-type knives (Jelks 1962; Prewitt 1981). Diagnostic
artifacts of the later Toyah phase (ca. A.D. 1300–1750) include contracting-stem arrow points (Perdiz and
Cliffton), Covington-type knives, tools made from bison bone, and flint drills (Jelks 1962). The Toyah
phase is also distinguished by the appearance of pottery (Prewitt 1974). Diagnostic ceramics associated
with this phase consist of bone-tempered Leon Plain pottery.

Historic Period (post–1700)
For indigenous people of central Texas, the first European contact may have occurred when the Spanish
explored Little River in Milam County and established missions. In 1748 and 1749, the Spanish
established Mission San Francisco Xavier de Horcasitas, Mission Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria, and
Mission San Ildefonso on the San Gabriel River in Milam County to minister to the Tonkawa Indians
(Stephens and Holmes 1989). These missions were subsequently abandoned in 1756 and their property
transferred to the new Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá, established in 1757 along the San Saba River in
present-day Menard County to convert the Apache. Presidio San Luis de las Amarillas was established at
the same time to protect the new mission. In March 1758, the mission was destroyed by a raiding party of
Comanche, Wichita, and other northern Indians. The presidio that housed several dozen soldiers and was
located 3 miles downriver from the mission, survived the attack, but it subsequently was abandoned in
June 1768 (Webb et al. 1952). Aside from prospecting and possibly some limited mining of gold and
silver, and a few other Spanish exploratory expeditions between San Antonio and Santa Fe, the area

450965/040381

16

III. Cultural Setting

remained under the control of Native Americans until the middle of the nineteenth century when AngloAmericans and Europeans began surveying land in the region.
The first settlers in Coryell and Bell Counties arrived in the early 1800s. Present-day Coryell and Bell
Counties were originally included as part of Roberston’s Colony, referred to previously as the Texas
Association, Leftwich's Grant, and the Nashville Colony. Coryell County was organized in 1854 and
named after James Coryell, a landowner. Gatesville was named the county seat and is the largest city in
the county.
The United States Army established Fort Gates, along the western frontier, in the late 1840s, but it was
abandoned in the early 1850s due to further western expansion. In 1860, cattle and subsistence farming
dominated the local economy and few settlers owned slaves. In 1861, county residents voted for secession
and a few companies volunteered for military service. During the war, Gatesville was the headquarters of
the Second Frontier District, under the command of Major George B. Erath. The county was in severe
economic decline after the Civil War and recovery was slow. Between 1864 and 1866, the county lost
63 percent of its tax base, most of which was due to declines in farm acreage, and in farm and livestock
value. Economic improvement was on its way by the late 1860s, and cattle still dominated the market but
agricultural yields were on the increase, aided by the Texas and St. Louis Railway and the Gulf, Colorado
and Santa Fe Railway. By 1900, cotton was the main industry in the county, but most farmers had to
abandon their fields during the Great Depression. In 1911, the Stephenville North and South Texas
Railroad laid track to Gatesville, opening up the northwestern part of the county to rail service.
During the twentieth century, Coryell County continued to be largely rural, with an agricultural economy.
A sizable amount of the county’s improved acreage was devoted to cotton production prior to the 1930s.
Then, with the onset of the Depression, many farmers devoted more acreage to feed crops and livestock,
including sheep and goats. The United States’s entry into World War II brought an end to the depressed
economy in Coryell County, with the construction of Camp Hood, the Bluebonnet Ordnance plant, and a
German prisoner-of-war camp. This boom continued into the 1950s, when Fort Hood was made a
permanent military base. In the 1970s and 1980s, Gatesville was chosen as the site for several new units
of the Texas Department of Corrections (Smyrl 2004).
The first known colonists to settle in present-day Bell County settled along Little River. These early
settlers fled their homesteads during Antonio López de Santa Anna’s attempt to control Texas, then
returned only to flee in 1836 after an Indian attack on Fort Parker, located in present-day Limestone
County. Many settlers fled the area during 1836 and 1843 due to the increase in Indian attacks. After 1843
many settlers returned to the area. Bell County, named after Peter H. Bell, was established on January 22,
1850. Belton, formerly known as Nolan Springs, was named the county seat. The County was reorganized
in 1860 when the line between Bell and Milam Counties was redrawn. In 1859, Salado College was
established. The county did not have the plantation economy like east Texas and cattle was the main
economy.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
The earliest professional excavation in Coryell County apparently occurred at the Ranney Creek Cave site
in the early 1930s. Apparently, the work was not reported (Prewitt 1974). A preliminary survey for Belton
Reservoir by Robert Stephenson in the late 1940s, included a small portion of Coryell County in its upper
end (Shafer et al. 1964). Additional survey, followed by testing in middens and rockshelters, was
conducted at Belton Reservoir by Miller and Jelks (1952). Another round of investigations took place at
Belton Reservoir in 1962, during which at least 12 sites were tested (Shafer et al. 1964). In the mid 1970s,
a program of site testing and mitigation was undertaken at Hog Creek Reservoir, in northeastern Coryell
County and southwestern Bosque County (Henry et al. 1980; Larson and Kirby 1976).
Beginning in the 1970s, and continuing through to the present, an extensive program of survey and
excavation was undertaken at Fort Hood, which covers approximately 339 square miles (878 square km)
in Bell and Coryell Counties. The Fort Hood Archeological Society and several university and private
archaeological contracting agencies have systematically surveyed and tested prehistoric sites within the
boundaries of the base and produced numerous reports (Abbott and Trierweiler 1995; Briuer and Thomas
1986; Carlson 1993a, 1993b, 1993c, 1997; Carlson and Briuer 1986; D. Carlson et al. 1983, 1986;
S. Carlson et al. 1988; Ellis et al. 1994; Frederick et al. 1994; Guderjan et al. 1980; Kleinbach et al. 1999;
Mehalchick et al. 1999; Nordt 1992; Roemer et al. 1985; Skinner et al. 1981, 1983; Thomas 1978;
Trierweiler 1994, 1996). Relatively recent discussions of the history of archaeological research at Fort
Hood can be found in Ellis et al. (1994) and Abbott and Trierweiler (1995).
In addition to the work conducted on Fort Hood, numerous small investigations have been conducted
around the cities of Belton, Temple, and Copperas Cove (Anthony 1998; Brown et al. 2001; Brown and
Horvathe 1989; Davis 1996; Ensor 1990; Largent 1993; Leach-Palm and Rader 1996; McWilliams 1999;
Miller and Drake 1998; Miller et al. 1997; Moore 1990, 1997; Moore et al. 1996a, 1996b; Peck et al.
1993; Rader 1994; Tovar 1996; Turpin 1996). Most of the sites recorded in these investigations were not
deemed significant enough to warrant further work. A couple of eligible sites that were recorded in survey
investigations include 41BL1073, a multicomponent early-twentieth century and prehistoric site (Moore
and Bradle 1996), and 41BL1006, a nineteenth-century cabin (Brown et al. 2001). In 1996 archaeologists
from Brazos Valley Research Associates recorded three potentially eligible prehistoric sites (41BL1066,
41BL1069, and 41BL1070). Site 41BL1066 is a Middle Archaic site, 41BL1069 is an Early to Middle
Archaic site, and 41BL1070 is a Middle Archaic to Late Prehistoric Site (Moore et al. 1996b).
Many National Register investigations not associated with Fort Hood have been conducted in Bell and
Coryell Counties. In the 1970s Southern Methodist University conducted test excavations at the L.E.
Robertson Shelter (41CV2) and the Stone Rock Shelter in Coryell County. Site 41CV2 had a date of
A.D. 775 and was occupied during either the terminal part of the Archaic period or the early part of the
Austin phase (Larson and Kirby 1976). Then in the 1980s Brazos Valley Research Associates conducted
testing investigations at site 41CV1544. Recently, Prewitt and Associates conducted archival research and

excavations at the Pepper Creek Paupers’ Cemetery (41BL1201) (Boyd 2003; Freeman 2002) and PBS&J
conducted National Register testing at site 41CV1630 (Cliff 2002).

IV. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
BACKGROUND RESEARCH AND RECORDS CHECK
Prior to the initiation of fieldwork, PBS&J conducted background research and a records check for the
entire proposed transmission line. Basic background research for the project area included examining the
Texas Historic Sites Atlas Online (THC 2001a) and the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas Online (THC
2001b). Both were checked for recorded archaeological sites, historic county courthouses, NRHP-listed
properties, historical markers, neighborhood surveys, and museums.
In addition to the basic background search detailed above, a records search was conducted at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) of The University of Texas at Austin and at the THC to
identify any recently recorded cultural resource properties within or close to the proposed ROW. While at
the THC, the files and maps were examined for NRHP and State Archeological Landmark (SAL)
properties.
The cultural resource files at TARL revealed seven previously recorded archaeological sites within 610 m
of the proposed ROW (i.e., 41CV958, 41BL193, 41BL355, 41BL356, 41BL358, 41BL363, and
41BL408). All seven sites are located within Fort Hood. Site 41CV958 was recorded in 1988 as a lithic
scatter by Callum and Pry and was described as being in poor condition (Callum and Pry 1988). Site
41BL193 was recorded in 1978 by Don E. White and George B. Thomas. At that time, the site was
described as a prehistoric lithic scatter (White and Thomas 1978). The site was revisited in 1981
(Nightengale 1981a). Site 41BL355 was recorded as a dispersed prehistoric lithic scatter encompassing a
terrace and its slope. The site was initially recorded in 1981 by B. Nightengale and revisited in 1983 by
W. Meiszner (Meiszner 1983a; Nightengale 1981b). The scatter included both Late Archaic and Late
Prehistoric material. The western edge of 41BL355 falls within the present proposed ROW. Site 41BL356
was also initially recorded in 1981 by Nightengale and subsequently revisited in 1983 by Meiszner, in
1986 by Moore and Strychalski, and in 1988 by Pry and Callum (Meiszner 1983b; Moore and Strychalski
1986a; Nightengale 1981c; Pry and Callum 1988a). It consisted of a historic cattle tank, a windmill base,
and scattered historic trash dating possibly to the early twentieth century. Site 41BL358 was recorded as a
lithic scatter containing tools in 1981 by Nightengale (Nightengale 1981d). The site was subsequently
revisited by Meiszner in 1983 (Meiszner 1983c). Site 41BL363 was originally recorded in 1981 by
Dough Comstock as a low density lithic scatter on an eroded terrace (Comstock 1981). The site was
revisited in 1983 by Meiszner and was found to have been impacted by juniper clearing, which had
further eroded the site (Meiszner 1983d). Site 41BL408 was recorded as a historic site consisting of a cut
limestone water trough, scattered historic trash, and cut limestone blocks dating to the early twentieth
century. The site was originally visited in 1983 by Thomas and revisited in 1988 by Pry and Callum (Pry
and Callum 1988b; Thomas 1983). Both sites 41BL193 and 41BL356 are inexactly mapped, with two
potential locations for each site.

IV. Research Design and Methodology

PEDESTRIAN SURVEY
From September 13 to September 17, 2004, PBS&J archaeologists conducted a 100 percent survey with
supplemental shovel testing of the proposed ROW. The field methodology, approved by the THC in the
generic research design for Oncor Electric Delivery Company (now TXU Electric Delivery) transmission
line projects in Texas (PBS&J 2002), called for the proposed ROW to be stratified into High Probability
Areas (HPAs), Moderate Probability Areas (MPAs), and Low Probability Areas (LPAs) on the basis of
perceived likelihood for the occurrence of unidentified cultural resource properties. HPAs were defined as
possessing the greatest cultural resource potential. Site integrity was also presumed to be highest in these
areas. HPAs include areas of interfluve summits and shoulderslopes, which contain deep soils and lie
within 305 m of natural water sources. These also include levee remnants and rises within floodplains,
toeslopes, and lower alluvial terraces. HPAs were initially defined on maps prior to the field effort and
were adjusted during the actual survey based on microtopography, soil conditions, and the degree of
surface erosion or disturbance. MPAs were defined in the field as areas of undisturbed uplands,
undisturbed areas greater than 305 m from water, and nonbedrock or undisturbed slopes of greater than
20 percent but less than 45 percent. LPAs were also defined in the field as areas of very steep slopes (i.e.,
greater than 45 percent), exposed bedrock, modern development, or extensive ground disturbance, such as
mass wasting, sheet erosion, or cedar clearance.
The survey consisted of a pedestrian surface inspection of the entire proposed ROW, with varying degrees
of shovel testing to locate buried cultural resources obscured by vegetation. One extensive HPA was
identified and was shovel tested, with a density of approximately one shovel test per 30 m of linear ROW.
The MPAs of the proposed ROW were subjected to a walkover to verify surface conditions, with shovel
tests excavated judgmentally, but generally at intervals of between 50 to 100 m. The LPAs were walked
and examined, but were not shovel tested.
In all, 63 shovel tests were excavated within the proposed ROW in an effort to locate cultural resource
sites. Shovel tests were approximately 30 cm in diameter and were excavated in arbitrary levels not
exceeding 10 cm. The vast majority of shovel tests were excavated to subsoil (the Bt horizon) or to
bedrock. In a few cases, the silty soil became too compact to continue and the shovel tests were
terminated at that depth. Information relating to each shovel test was recorded on a shovel test form,
including a description of the sediments present, the general environmental setting of the shovel test, its
distance from the beginning of the transect, any artifacts that were present, and any additional comments.
None of the shovel tests contained any cultural remains and all were backfilled upon completion. The
detailed shovel test data are included in Appendix B.
Once an archaeological site was identified, its location was recorded on a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
7.5-minute quadrangle map. If any soil was preserved on the surface of the site, a series of shovel tests
was excavated within the proposed ROW. A pace-and-compass map was drawn showing the location of
the shovel tests and any other salient features at the site, and the site area was photographed. A temporary

field designation was assigned, and a TexSite form was completed and submitted to TARL for
assignment of a permanent trinomial designation.

450965/040381

22

V. RESULTS
The current project area is situated within rangeland and cedar thicket, characterized by extensive erosion
and overgrazing. The northwestern portion of the project area contains a moderate amount of urban
construction and some commercial rock quarries (Figure 4). The central and southern portions of the
project area are characterized by eroding ridges with extensive areas of limestone bedrock on the surface.
Other disturbances along the ROW include two electrical substations, various pipeline ROWs, manmade
water impoundments, and electrical transmission lines (Figure 5).
The literature and records review conducted for this project revealed one previously recorded
archaeological site within the proposed Copperas Cove to Ding Dong transmission line ROW—41BL355.
The subsequent archaeological survey of the proposed ROW recorded two new cultural resource sites—
41CV1633 and 41BL1224—and revisited the previously recorded 41BL355. Each of the three sites is
described separately below and the potential effect of the proposed project evaluated.

41BL355 (REVISIT)
Site 41BL355 is a sparse surface scatter of prehistoric lithics located on an intermediate upland terrace
near a secondary drainage of Clear Creek (see Appendix A). The site was originally recorded in 1981 by
the Fort Hood Archeological Survey and was subsequently revisited and reevaluated in 1983 by the same
group. The site was reported to be on a northwest-southeast-trending terrace projection, about 600 m
southwest of Sevenmile Mountain, about 400 m west of the creek. The site consisted of a high density
“dispersed lithic scatter encompassing the terrace and slope,” with lithic material consisting of “finished
tools, cores and flakes with some [burned rock]” (Nightengale 1981b). The site dimensions in 1981 were
given as 175 m long (northwest-southeast) by 40 m wide, with a shallow depth and no features. Artifacts
recorded as being present on the site in 1981 include one Bulverde dart point basal fragment, one Nolan
dart point basal fragment, one complete Fresno arrow point, beveled end scrapers, a chopper, two knives
(one identified as a possible Lerma point), utilized flakes, cores, and lithic debris (Nightengale 1981b).
The site was recorded as being in good condition in 1981, although it was noted that most of the lithic
material had been exposed by erosion of the slopes on all sides of the site. Based on the artifacts observed
on the site, 41BL355 was evaluated as having at least two components—one late Early Archaic and one
Late Prehistoric.
When the site was revisited in 1983, it was found to have been “badly damaged” by juniper clearance by
bulldozers (Meiszner 1983a). The datum apparently placed in the site in 1981 could not be relocated in
1983, having been either destroyed or displaced, and examination of the area impacted by brush removal
showed lithic tools and debris “scattered over a large area around [the] terrace” (Meiszner 1983a). The
site dimensions were redefined as being 300 m long (northwest-southeast) by 150 m wide. The site
condition at this time was downgraded to poor, with an estimated 20 percent of the site adversely

impacted by erosion and 50 percent adversely impacted by brush clearance. Two additional projectile
points were collected from the site at this time but were not identified on the site form (Meiszner 1983a).
The present survey relocated site 41BL355 on October 18, 2004. The proposed ROW in this area runs
between FM 116 and the boundary fence for Fort Hood, and apparently only the extreme western edge of
41BL355 was identified in the project area. This portion of the site was found to be an extremely sparse
lithic scatter located on an eroded slope (Figure 6). Disturbances to this portion of the site include erosion
and the construction of FM 116. At this point, the site is located approximately 400 m west of a secondary
tributary of Clear Creek, at an approximate elevation of 305 m amsl. The soil in this area is mapped as
belonging to the Brackett series, more specifically the Brackett association. This series consists of rolling
loamy soils formed in loamy material underlain by limestone (USDA, SCS 1977:9–10). The vegetation at
the time of the present survey consisted of scattered cedar trees, short grasses, and forbs. The ground
surface visibility was approximately 60 percent. No evidence of the 1983 brush clearance was noted by
the field crew.
The width of the ROW at this point is approximately 6 m. From north to south, adjacent to FM 116, the
site extends for about 142 m. To the west, the site extends beyond the edge of the ROW, onto Fort Hood
property, for approximately 250 m based on the previously recorded site location (THC 2001c). The site
apparently does not extend east of FM 116. Taking this into account, the site seems to measure about
400 m long (northwest-southeast) by about 200 m wide, with about 852 square meters (m2) on the western
edge located within the proposed ROW. All of the site area along the proposed ROW has been bladed and
is heavily disturbed, with bedrock exposed along the highway cut (Figure 7). For this reason, no shovel
testing of the site area within the ROW was done. Beyond the ROW, to the west, the site area appeared to
be deflated and eroded, with no significant soil buildup. Artifacts observed on the surface of the ground
included chert debitage, cores, and one broken biface that was photographed but not collected (Figure 8).
In summary, the portion of site 41BL355 identified within the proposed ROW consists of a low-density
scatter of prehistoric lithic material located on an upland ridge. This project extends the previously
recorded boundaries of the site about 100 m to the northwest, but it is not clear if this is due to the site
area being underestimated in 1981 or to the progressive dispersal of the cultural material by erosion and
brush clearance over time. What is clear is that the portion of the site within and adjacent to the proposed
transmission line ROW has suffered significant adverse effects from surface erosion, based on the
shallow bedrock, and from construction disturbances. The low density of artifacts in the ROW and the
extent of previous disturbances in this area suggest that this portion of the site does not possess any
significant research potential. Since the National Register status of 41BL355 has not been fully assessed
at this time, its significance remains unknown. Nevertheless, it is clear that the portion of the site within
the proposed project ROW would not contribute to its eligibility even if the site were later determined to
be National Register eligible, and therefore no further assessment is recommended at this time.

V. Results

41CV1633
Site 41CV1633 appears to be a prehistoric lithic procurement site located on an extensive chert outcrop
along the southwestern slope of Sevenmile Mountain. The site was initially encountered approximately
5 m east of a dry tributary of Clear Creek at the base of Sevenmile Mountain, approximately 323 m amsl.
From here, the site follows the proposed ROW to the southeast for approximately 1.87 km, generally
following the slope of the mountain, going as high as 366 m amsl in the center (see Appendix A). At the
time of recording, the western edge of the site was covered by overgrazed rangeland, with scattered
clumps of cedar trees mixed with short grass and prickly pear (Figure 9). Over most of the rest of the area,
the site was covered by cedar thicket, with little ground cover and extensive areas of exposed and eroded
bedrock (Figure 10). Generally, ground surface visibility was 50 percent or more. The site area is mapped
as being on Topsey-Pidcoke association, 2 to 8 percent slopes, at the base of Sevenmile Mountain, and on
Real-Rock outcrop, 12 to 40 percent slopes, on the slopes. The Topsey-Pidcoke association consists of
loamy soils on undulating uplands (USDA, SCS 1985:28), while the Real-Rock outcrop consists of areas
of shallow soils and areas of rock outcrop on sideslopes of uplands (USDA, SCS 1985:26).
For the present survey, the boundaries of 41CV1633 were determined based on the distribution of cultural
materials observed on the surface of the ground within the proposed ROW. Very little soil was present on
the site, with bedrock at or near the surface, depending on the slope. The western edge of the site is
located on a colluvial landform, and the artifacts in this area are probably eroded from higher elevations.
Within the ROW, the site covers an area of about 39,995 m2, measuring 1.87 km northwest-southeast by
21 m northeast-southwest. Artifacts observed on the surface of the site included lithic debitage, numerous
flaked cobbles (possibly cores), and occasional flake tools, including a beveled-edge projectile point
(Figure 11). Battered cobbles and broken flakes, possibly of natural origin, comprised more than
90 percent of the chert pieces visible on the surface of the site.
Extensive chert fields and lithic procurement sites are not uncommon in association with Sevenmile
Mountain. At least three large chert fields have been identified by the Fort Hood Archeological Survey in
the vicinity of 41CV1633. None are located within the proposed ROW. Site 41CV958 was identified on
the northwestern slopes of Sevenmile Mountain, east of 41CV1633 and over 500 m west of the proposed
ROW; site 41BL786 was identified on the top and both east and west slopes of Sevenmile Mountain,
southwest of 41CV1633 and over 650 m west of the proposed ROW; and 41BL787 was identified on the
top and western slopes of Sevenmile Mountain, southwest of 41BL786 and over 1,000 m northwest of the
proposed ROW. Site 41CV958 is reported to cover an area 360 m long by 240 m wide, but it is mapped
as being roughly C-shaped, following the edge of the mountain and covering an estimated 200,000 m2.
The site was monitored in 1988, and several bifaces and numerous flakes were reported on the surface
(Callum and Pry 1988). Sites 41BL786 and 41BL787 are both recorded on Fort Hood monitoring forms
as chert fields with no artifacts (Moore and Strychalski 1986b, 1986c). No dimensions are given for either
site, but the site location maps suggest that 41BL786 covers an estimated area of about 350,000 m2, while
41BL787 may cover as much as 800,000 m2. Smaller lithic procurement sites and/or chert fields

associated with Sevenmile Mountain include 41CV227, west of 41CV958 (Meiszner 1979, 1983e;
Dureka and Callum 1988), and 41BL789, southeast of 41BL787 (Moore and Strychalski 1986d)
In summary, site 41CV1633 consists of a very large and dispersed surface scatter of lithic material,
mostly apparently unworked cobbles and naturally fractured debris. Geologically, the site is located on an
outcrop of Edwards Limestone that contains an abundance of chert nodules (BEG 1970) (Figure 12).
Although over 90 percent of the lithic material on-site is probably natural, the presence of some cores and
tools indicates that the area was utilized in the prehistoric period, probably as a lithic procurement site.
The site has apparently been impacted by wind and water erosion, as well as cattle grazing, road
maintenance, and brush clearance. Approximately 40,000 m2 of the site are within the proposed ROW,
but it is not known what the total size of the site is, although the size of similar sites on Sevenmile
Mountain strongly suggest that 41CV1633 is at least several hundred thousand square meters in area. The
low density of lithic tools and artifacts within the ROW, and the lack of any deep deposits or features in
this area suggest that this portion of 41CV1633 does not possess any significant research potential. Since
the National Register status of 41CV1633 has not been fully assessed at this time, its significance remains
unknown. Nevertheless, it is clear that the portion of the site within the proposed project ROW would not
contribute to its eligibility even if the site were later determined to be National Register eligible, and
therefore no further assessment is recommended at this time.

41BL1224
Site 41BL1224 is a historic archaeological site located on a gradual slope, at an elevation of about 227 m
amsl, overlooking the floodplain of the Lampasas River, in the southern portion of the proposed ROW
(see Appendix A). The nearest natural source of surface water to the site is a small tributary of the
Lampasas River, about 230 m to the west. The Lampasas River itself is about 1.15 km south of the site.
At the time of recording, the site was on overgrazed rangeland with scattered clumps of trees, including
post oak, mesquite, and cedar. Generally, ground surface visibility was 45 percent or higher. The site is
mapped as being on Venus clay loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes. The Venus series consists of loamy soils on
stream terraces (USDA, SCS 1977:32).
The site is estimated to cover an oval area measuring about 20 m north to south by 32 m east to west (ca.
510 m2), based on shovel tests, surface debris, and features (Figure 13). These features included a circular
concrete water trough just outside the ROW (Figure 14), a limestone slab, and a pile of limestone rocks
(Figure 15). The only artifacts observed on the surface of the site consisted of a few pieces of whiteware,
one piece of aqua-colored glass, one large piece of flat sheet metal, and one large piece of an unidentified
metal artifact. No surface collection was made. Six shovel tests were excavated around the site area, all of
which were negative. The shovel tests showed a shallow, grayish brown fine sand over limestone
bedrock, either at the surface or at 5 cmbs (Table 1).

Soil Description

Artifacts

Nothing is shown in the vicinity of site 41BL1224 on the 1936 General Highway May for Bell County
(Texas State Highway Department 1936). Several buildings, possibly comprising a single farmstead, are
located on the north side of FM 2670, about 1 km southwest of 41BL1224, and a nondomestic building,
probably a barn, is shown on the south side of FM 2670, about 1.3 km southwest of the site (Texas State
Highway Department 1936). Both of these structures are located within the Lampasas floodplain. The
more recent USGS quadrangle map for this area (USGS 1958, revised 1979) appears to show three or four
complexes composed of domestic and nondomestic buildings in the near vicinity of 41BL1224 (see
Appendix A). It is probable that the rural settlement pattern in this area has extended to the edge of the
Lampasas River floodplain only since the end of World War II, providing circumstantial evidence that
41BL1224 dates only to the middle to late twentieth century.
In summary, 41BL1224 appears to be a mid-to-late-twentieth-century historic site, probably associated
with ranching. The results of the shovel testing indicate that no subsurface artifacts or features are present
within the proposed transmission line ROW. Also, in the opinion of PBS&J historians, the site will not
yield any additional historic information. Given that no diagnostic materials were recovered, and given
the lack of any subsurface deposits or structural features within the ROW, it is believed that this portion
of the site has no research potential. Since the National Register status of 41BL1224 has not been fully
assessed at this time, its significance remains unknown. Nevertheless, it is clear that the portion of the site
within the proposed project ROW would not contribute to its eligibility even if the site were later
determined to be National Register eligible, and therefore no further assessment is recommended at this
time.

VI. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
As a result of cultural resource investigations conducted in connection with the proposed TXU Electric
Delivery Copperas Cove to Ding Dong 138 kV transmission line, two previously unrecorded cultural
resource sites (41CV1633 and 41BL1224) were recorded, and one previously recorded site (41BL355)
was revisited within the proposed transmission line ROW. Site 41CV1633 is a large chert field and lithic
procurement site, and site 41BL355 is a low-density lithic scatter. Site 41BL1224 is a historic site
associated with the ranching industry and probably dating to the middle to late twentieth century. Since
none of the sites have been fully assessed at this time, their National Register status remains unknown.
Nevertheless, the current investigations clearly show that the portions of the three sites within the
proposed project ROW would not contribute to their eligibility even if any of the sites were later
determined to be National Register eligible. Therefore, no further assessment is recommended for any of
the sites at this time.
Based on the examination of the project area during the field survey, it seems likely that the limited
number of both prehistoric and historic sites identified along the proposed ROW is due to erosion,
modern disturbance, and limited water in the vicinity of the ROW. The limited amount of permanent
water sources along the proposed ROW is noticeable on the USGS maps of the area, and was verified by
the field survey. Most of the creeks in this terrain are seasonal and dry for the majority of the year.
Seasonal flooding of these creeks also leads to heavy erosion, resulting in entrenched, steep-sided
channels, often with scoured creek beds and exposed bedrock at the base (Figure 16). Such flooding, and
the resultant erosion, would destroy any small seasonal sites in close proximity to these upland drainages.
Recent disturbance has also played a critical role in destroying potential site areas in the region.
Urbanization in the northwestern portion of the project area, especially around the City of Copperas Cove,
has impacted the areas around the proposed ROW (Figure 17). In addition, large portions of the ROW
were found to have been impacted by brush clearance for rangeland, resulting in extensive surface
disturbance and increased erosion.
Based on these results, it is recommended that the proposed TXU Electric Delivery Copperas Cove to
Ding Dong 138 kV Transmission Line project be allowed to proceed within the designated ROW without
any further consultation with the THC. However, if the proposed ROW changes in the area of any of the
recorded archaeological sites, then the THC should be notified and consultation should resume.
Furthermore, if evidence of presently undiscovered cultural remains is encountered during the
construction of the proposed transmission line, it is recommended that the discovery be evaluated by a
qualified archaeologist who can provide recommendations on how to proceed in accordance with federal
and state regulations.
