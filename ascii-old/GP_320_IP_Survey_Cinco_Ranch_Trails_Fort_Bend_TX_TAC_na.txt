ABSTRACT

This report presents the findings of an intensive pedestrian survey containing an
existing 4.23-kilometer (2.63-mile) hiking and biking trail, and approximately 0.96 kilometer
(0.60 mile) of proposed new trail along Buffalo Bayou in Fort Bend County, Texas. New
and existing trail parameters will consist of a 9.14-meter (30-foot) wide right of way (ROW).
The Area of Potential Effect (APE) for this project equals approximately 4.74 hectares (11.72
acres) and includes all land within the new and existing ROW. The cultural resources survey
took place on privately owned land that is expected to be transferred to the Fort Bend County
Parks Department. Funds for trail construction are being sought from the National Park
Service through a grant from Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, thus triggering Section
106 procedures. If the land transfer takes place, state review under the Texas Antiquities
Code may also be required.
Prior to fieldwork mobilization, a background literature and site file search was
conducted to identify the presence of recorded sites near the project area. The search
indicated that 12 previously recorded archaeological sites are located within 1.6 kilometers (1
mile) of the current project area. Archaeological Sites 41FB140 and 41FB141 are located
adjacent to the project APE.
Field investigation took place on June 7 to June 8, and June 30, 2006, and included
the excavation of 36 shovel tests to depths ranging between 10 and 100 centimeters (3.94 and
39.37 inches). In general, the soils within the area of proposed new trail ROW showed signs
of periodic inundation and previous disturbance due to the channalization of Buffalo Bayou.
Likewise along the existing trail ROW, where much of the surface appeared to be low-lying
floodplain. Also previous disturbances have resulted in the loss of intact soils. This can be
attributed to both natural and manmade processes.
These include flooding, the
channalization of Buffalo Bayou, and by the filling of trail sections that near oxbow lakes.
No cultural materials or features related to previously recorded sites were discovered
within the APE. No previously unrecorded architectural resources appearing to be over 50
years in age were identified adjacent to the project area. One newly recorded archaeological
site (Site 41FB309) was recorded during this survey. The site entailed a prehistoric Goose
Creek red-filmed ceramic fragment and a shell fragment located on a raised area of ground
adjacent to an oxbow lake in the area of proposed new trail ROW. The site, as it is currently
delineated within the current APE, displays very little density. The limited nature of the site
suggests a possible lack of integrity or possible previous disturbance, and therefore HRA
Gray & Pape currently recommends the site as not eligible for inclusion on the National
Register of Historic Places.

i

HRA Gray & Pape recommends that no further archaeological work is required for
the project as it is currently planned. However, if project plans require disturbance in areas
outside the currently planned ROW, further testing should be undertaken to establish the
spatial limits of Site 41FB309.

CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION

TCB INC., contracted with HRA Gray & Pape, LLC (HRA Gray & Pape), of
Houston, Texas, to perform an Intensive Pedestrian Survey on property containing an
existing 4.23-kilometer (2.63-mile) hiking and biking trail, and approximately 0.96
kilometers (0.60 mile) of proposed new trail along Buffalo Bayou in Fort Bend County,
Texas.
The cultural resources survey took place on privately owned land belonging to
Newland Communities. This land is expected to be transferred to the Fort Bend County
Parks Department, and funds for trail construction are being sought from the National Park
Service (NPS) through a grant from Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. Details regarding
the intent, schedule and method of transfer were not provided prior to fieldwork, and have
yet to be determined.
Due to the anticipated use of Federal funding, the goals of the cultural resources
survey were to determine if the initiation of this project would affect any previously
identified historic properties as defined by Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended (36 CFR 800) (ACHP 1999), and to establish whether or
not previously unidentified cultural resources were located within the projectâs Area of
Potential Effect (APE). If the land transfer takes place, state review under the Texas
Antiquities Code may also be required.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The trail segment is located on approximately 5.19 kilometers (3.23 miles) of
property along the north and south banks of Buffalo Bayou. As proposed, new trail
construction will begin on the south side of the bayou near a new subdivision west of Cinco
Ranch Boulevard (Blvd), and extend east to terminate where Cinco Ranch Blvd crosses
Buffalo Bayou. At this point the project area becomes an existing trail that starts at Cinco
Ranch Blvd and continues east along the north side of Buffalo Bayou, crossing the Grand
Parkway (State Highway 99 [SH99]), South Peek Road, and South Mason Road. At South
Mason Road the project area crosses to the south of Buffalo Bayou and continues east to
terminate in the vicinity of Barton Park Lane. A wooded area of trail between Willowbranch
and the west end of Portage Rock Lane is not included in the current project area. New and
existing trail parameters will consist of a 9.14-meter (30-foot) wide right of way (ROW).
The APE for this project equals approximately 4.74 hectares (11.72 acres) and includes all
land within the new and existing ROW.

CHAPTER II. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING OF THE STUDY AREA

The following section provides a discussion of the general geomorphologic
characteristics found along the Buffalo Bayou drainage in northern Fort Bend County, Texas.
This is followed by discussions of soil morphology, climate, and floral and faunal species
typical of the area.

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY
The Texas Coastal Plain is part of the larger Gulf Coastal Plain. The coastal plain is
characterized by a low topographic relief and extends from Florida to Mexico. The Texas
Coastal Plain reaches as far north as the Ouachita uplift in Oklahoma, and as far west as the
Balcones escarpment in central Texas. The basic geomorphologic characteristics of the
Texas coast and associated inland areas, which includes Fort Bend County, resulted from
depositional conditions influenced by the combined action of sea level changes from glacial
advance in the northern portions of the continent, and subsequent downcutting and variations
in the sediment load capacity of the regionâs rivers. Fort Bend County is underlain by
relatively recent sedimentary rocks and unconsolidated sediments ranging in age from the
Pleistocene to the Holocene (Abbott 2001; Barnes 1992; Mowery et al. 1960; Van Siclen
1991).
Although older geologic units have been identified in the region (see Abbott 2001;
Barnes 1992; Van Siclen 1991), units relevant to the study of long-term human occupation in
the region surrounding the project area include the Beaumont Formation, generally believed
to predate human occupation in the region, and the so-called âDeweyvilleâ terraces,
positioned stratigraphically between the Beaumont and Recent deposits. These terraces date
to between one hundred thousand to four thousand years ago, and are characterized as
consisting âof up to three inset fluvial terracesâ¦(distinguished by the presence of)â¦large
looping meander scarsâ¦â indicative of watercourses capable of fluvial action and discharge
markedly greater than that seen today (Abbot 2001:16). Overlaying these deposits may be
relatively thick or thin Holocene deposits, laid down in the areas by alluvial or eolian factors,
or potentially, marshy environments (Aronow 2005).
The project area is depicted on the Richmond NE and Clodine 7.5-minute quadrangle
maps and is located on the north and south sides of Buffalo Bayou. The bayou is part of the
Brazos River floodplain, which is composed of low ridges, swales, and oxbow lakes (Abbott
2001). The project area is situated on land between the modern day channalized Buffalo
Bayou and remnants of its former channel in the form of oxbow lakes.

SOILS
The proposed project area contains soils that have been mapped and described by
Mowery et al. (1960), and updated by the National Cooperative Soil Survey Web Soil Survey
(NCSS WSS 2006) and the Soil Survey Staff, Natural Resources Conservation Service,
United States Department of Agriculture (SSS NRCS USDA 2006). Soils mapped within the
project area consist of Clodine fine sandy loam (Ca) and Bibb fine sandy loam (Bg).
Descriptions of these soils are summarized below.
Clodine fine sandy loam (Ca) encompasses the entire project area west of SH99. This
is a very deep and somewhat poorly drained soil formed out of the Pleistocene-aged
Beaumont Formation. It is typically found on nearly level coastal prairies and has a surface
layer of dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam to a depth of 25.4 centimeters (10 inches) followed by a
layer of gray (10YR 5/1) loam to a depth of 89 centimeters (35 inches). This is followed by a
layer of light gray (5Y 7/2) loam containing 10 percent calcium carbonate concretions to a
depth of 152.40 centimeters (60 inches). This soil is regarded as having low to moderate
potential for containing intact cultural deposits (Abbott 2001).
Bibb fine sandy loam (Bg) encompasses the entire east half of the project area. This
soil is a very deep, poorly drained loam and sandy alluvium found on flood plains and
streams and is commonly flooded. Bibb soils have a surface layer of brown (10YR 4/3)
sandy loam 10.16 centimeters (4 inches) deep followed by mottled dark gray (N 4/ ) and dark
grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy loam to a depth of 30.48 centimeters (12 inches). This is
followed by gray (5Y 5/1) sandy loam commonly containing thin strata of silt loam or loamy
sand to a depth of 93.98 centimeters (37 inches). Below that is a layer of gray (N 5/ ) silt
loam to a depth of 152.40 centimeters (60 inches). This soil is regarded as having high
potential for containing intact cultural deposits (Abbott 2001).

CLIMATE
The close proximity to Fort Bend County to the Gulf of Mexico tends to influence the
temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity of the region. Summers are hot and humid;
winters are warm and only occasionally experience incursions of polar air from the north. In
Fort Bend County average daily temperatures in the summer hover in the low 80s (degrees
Fahrenheit) and average winter temperatures are typically in the high 40s (degrees
Fahrenheit). Rainfall is highest in the summer and early fall with an average yearly total of
109.8 centimeters (43.23 inches) (Mowery et al. 1960:table1).

FLORA AND FAUNA
The project area is located near the western edge of the Austroriparian biotic
province, and is situated in the Upland Prairies and Woods subregion of the Gulf Coast

5

Prairies and Marshes Region (Abbott 2001). Evidence from pollen analysis in Central Texas
suggests that, at least during the Late Pleistocene, the area may have been populated by
vegetative species that were tolerant of a cold weather environment. Climactic fluctuation
during the Holocene would eventually result in a gradual trend towards warmer weather,
similar to that seen today (Abbott 2001).
Late Pleistocene flora may have included populations of spruce, poplar, maple, and
pine (Holloway 1997), in an oak woodland environment that would eventually transition to
an oak savanna in the late Holocene (Abbott 2001). Fauna during this time would include
currently present species such as white-tailed deer and various smaller game, as well as
bison, and, in localized areas, pronghorn sheep and the American alligator (Abbott 2001).
The modern vegetative community associated with this region consists of a diverse
collection of primarily deciduous trees and undergrowth, but native vegetation in much of the
area has been replaced by modern cultigens and pasture (Abbott 2001). Modern land
alteration activities, especially those associated with agriculture, have resulted in the removal
of native plant species from the area. Identified trees may include water oak, pecan, various
elms, cedar, oaks, sweetgum, and mulberry, to name a few. Honeysuckle, dewberry, yaupon,
and blackberry are common, as are indiangrass and bluegrasses (Abbott 2001).
The modern faunal community includes mammals such as deer, squirrel, opossum,
raccoon, skunk and various small rodents, numerous bird species, and reptiles including the
Texas rat snake, the western cottonmouth, the kingsnake, and turtle species. Black bear and
bison and Coastal Prairie predators including wolves, and mountain lion were also present in
the area occasionally in the early historic past (Abbott 2001; Wharton 1939).

CHAPTER III. CULTURAL SETTING OF THE STUDY AREA

Most sites near the coast between the Brazos River and Sabine Lake consist of
middens of clams found in estuaries or exposed in cutbanks along streams (Aten 1983;
Patterson 1985). These middens usually contain faunal material as well as cultural remains
such as lithic tools and pottery. Inland sites are less likely to consist of middens and are
more similar to generalized open campsites. In both areas, sites are found near stream
channels.
Addicks Reservoir was one of the earliest projects conducted in the area (Wheat
1953). The research done during that project initialized the formation of the Galveston Bay
Focus and the development of a cultural sequence of the region based on lithics and ceramics
(Aten 1983). The cultural context of the upper coastal region is described by Aten (1983)
and Story (1990). This information is merged with the archaeological data here to give a
complete picture of life on the Upper Texas Coast.

PREHISTORIC ARCHAEOLOGICAL TIME PERIODS
Along the Upper Texas Coast, the Paleoindian period begins around 12,000 B.P. and
ends near 9,000 B.P. (Aten 1983; Story 1990). This period is poorly represented in the
archaeological evidence for the region (Aten 1983) and no sites for this period have been
verified. Isolated artifacts include Clovis, Angostura, Scottsbluff, Meserve, Plainview, and
Golondrina point types (Aten 1983). Sites from this stage would be either buried by
alluvium or found in upland sites.
The Transitional Archaic period begins about 9,000 B.P. and ends around 7,500 B.P.
(Aten 1983; Story 1990). This stage is also poorly represented in the archaeological work in
the area but isolated finds of Bell/Calf Creek, Early-Side Notched, and Early Expanding
Stemmed dart points are attributed to this time period. The Archaic stage is thought to
include a shift towards a diet more geared towards plant processing but still includes hunting.
Plant processing technology seen during the entire Archaic period includes stone lined
hearths and baking pits as well as milling tools (Story 1990). Groups began to travel over
less of the landscape and population density seems to have risen.
Beginning at 7,500 B.P. and spanning 2,500 years (Aten 1983), the Early Archaic
period in this region has not been well documented. The sites may have been destroyed or
deeply buried (Aten 1983; Story 1990). In situ, Early Archaic remains have been found at
the Addicks Reservoir as well as other localities in the area (Story 1990). Points from this
period include Bell, Carrollton, Trinity, Wells, and Early Stemmed. It is possible that the
Carrollton, Trinity, and Wells points continued to be used into the middle Archaic (Patterson
1996).

7

The Middle Archaic period (5,000 to 3,000 B.P.) reveals the earliest surviving shell
middens (Aten 1983). These middens contain remains of shellfish, such as oysters and
estuarine clams, faunal material from terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates, and the earliest
known human burials in the region (Aten 1983). Characteristic projectile points include
Bulverde, Williams, Lange, and Pedernales types.
The Late Archaic lasted from 3,000 to 2,000 B.P. and shows evidence for population
increase (Aten 1983). By 2500 B.P., the climate in this area was essentially like the modern
climate. Ground stone artifacts made from materials from southwestern Arkansas and found
in context with human burials in cemeteries such as the Ernest Witte Site indicate the
possibility of trade (Hall 1981). Projectile points differ from earlier periods in that they are
corner-notched or expanding-stemmed forms, such as the Kent, Ellis, and Pontchartrain
types. Other types can be found, such as the unnotched Pamillas. These types are thought to
precede the Gary type, which can be found into the Late Prehistoric (Story 1990). During the
Late Archaic, more utilitarian biface tools are prevalent as well as are bone tools. Late
Archaic assemblages are very similar to the early part of the Late Prehistoric stage (Aten
1983).
The transition from the Late Archaic stage to the Late Prehistoric is indicated by the
introduction of ceramics into the assemblage (Aten 1983). Cultural shifts during the Late
Prehistoric include the possible adoption of a more sedentary lifestyle and major
technological changes, such as sandy paste ceramics and late in the stage, the bow and arrow
(Story 1990). The cultural tradition during the Late Prehistoric along the Upper Gulf Coast
has been designated as Woodland. Story (1990) has suggested the use of the term Mossy
Grove Tradition to define cultural patterns of the region. The Trinity River seems to be a
dividing line in this tradition with cultures east of the river being more similar to those in
Louisiana than to those west of Galveston Bay. The eastern tradition also seems to have
begun earlier than that in the west, beginning about 2,000 B.P. and lasting 600 years (Aten
1983; Story 1990).
Story (1990) splits the Mossy Grove Tradition into five distinct time intervals on the
coast, while noting that only two are found inland. Aten (1983) defined these intervals for
the area between the Brazos River and Galveston Bay as the Clear Lake (1850-1525 B.P.),
Mayes Island (1525-1300 B.P.), Turtle Bay (1300-950 B.P.), Round Lake (950-600 B.P.),
and Old River (600-250 B.P.) periods based on ceramic styles. Only the Round Lake period
is recognized by Aten for the West Bay-Brazos Delta due to the low artifact class diversity
compared to areas east of Galveston Bay as well as a time discrepancy in which equivalent
periods are later in time than those to the east (Aten 1983).
Early ceramics from this area are similar to Tchefuncte period wares found near
Sabine Lake and into Louisiana and include sandy paste varieties such as Mandeville Plain,
Goose Creek Plain (Anahuac variety), and Tchefuncte Plain (Aten 1983; Story 1990). These
early sites appear similar to pre-ceramic sites due to the low number of ceramic sherds found.
The appearance of sandy paste and sand-tempering occurs about 1900 B.P. with the OâNeal
Plain (variety Conway) being a good example (Aten 1983). Rocker-stamped decorations, a

8

distinctive marker for this period, are uncommon in the West Bay-Brazos Delta, as are
incised wares (Aten 1983).
The Mayes Island period brought about the introduction of the bow and arrow, which
was probably used along with the atlatl until the historic period (Aten 1983; Story 1990).
The arrow points during this period included both notched and expanding-stemmed forms
(Aten 1983; Story 1990).
Ceramic indicators for the Turtle Bay period include Goose Creek red-filmed along
with other decorated ceramics, all of which are rare in the West Bay-Brazos Delta area. At
the beginning of the Round Lake period, the earliest use of grog or large crushed ceramic
particles as tempering agents is seen. Typical varieties include Baytown Plain (variety San
Jacinto) and San Jacinto Incised. Along with these types, a reduction in Goose Creek types is
seen. Aten (1983) describes this period as having an increase in population due to the larger
number of sites in more specialized locations.
During the Old River period, a resurgence of Goose Creek ceramics is seen as the
Baytown types decrease in popularity. Contact with Europeans begins near the end of this
period, but visible changes in material culture are not seen until about A.D. 1750 along with
a rapid decline in population (Story 1990).

HISTORIC PERIOD DEVELOPMENTS
Present day Fort Bend County was established on December 29, 1837, from parts of
earlier counties consisting of Austin, Brazoria, and Harrisburg. The town of Richmond,
which had been incorporated in May of that same year, was voted the county seat by the
citizens of the new county (Hardin 2002).
In 1821, the schooner Lively set sail from New Orleans and anchored at the mouth of
the Brazos River. Of this first contingent of Austinâs settlers, a small party continued 145
kilometers (90 miles) up the Brazos to a bend in the river. Here, in November of 1822, a
blockhouse was built. Other settlers followed and a small community that came to be
referred to as Fort Bend grew around the blockhouse. Fort Bend was located on one of the
primary fords of the Brazos River and as such, played a role in the troop movements of the
Texas Revolution. The site was abandoned when Santa Annaâs Mexican Army crossed the
river in route to the battle of San Jacinto. When the area was resettled, the new community
of Richmond was established (Leffler 2002).
The first Texas land grant is reported to have been made in 1731 for land near San
Antonio. The Mexican government continued the process after Spanish rule was toppled in
1821. The area of what is now Fort Bend County was originally settled in the 1820s as part
of the land grant to Moses Austin by the Mexican government in 1821. Having died that
same year, his son Stephen F. Austin was allowed to carry out the colonization. Of the 297
original grants to Austin, 53 were situated in present day Fort Bend County (Hardin 2002).

9

Persons who received grants often had a say in the size, shape, and location of the
parcel, with areas along streams and rivers the most sought-after. After the Texas
Revolution, the General Land Office (GLO) was established to manage land grants and
surveys. Before new grants or amendments to old ones could take place, the GLO required
new surveys accompanied by field notes, sketches, deeds, and other forms of documentation.
Even so, accuracy of some of the older property maps is quite flawed due to poor equipment,
inconsistent units of measure, and dangerous frontier conditions (Jacobson 1992). As was
customary by the Mexican government, the league was rectangular shaped with a quarter of
it falling along the river. The original grant was written in Spanish and appears to have been
measured in varas, the Spanish yard.
The Brazos River was a regional trade center in the following decades, with barges
and steamboats carrying the cotton, corn, and sugar produced in the region down to
Galveston. In 1853, the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos, and Colorado Railway proved a further boon
to business connecting Stafford Point to Harrisburg. African slaves were essential to the
plantation economy of the region and by the 1850s outnumbered the white inhabitants of the
county. Because of this economic reality, Fort Bend planters strongly supported the
Southern secession and the Civil War (Hardin 2002).
The economy of Fort Bend in the nineteenth century focused on cotton, sugar, corn,
and livestock production. In the 1890s, a one million dollar sugar refinery was constructed at
Sugar Land. The county also contains substantial amounts oil, gas, and sulfur deposits,
which have played a major role in the economic development of the area (Hardin 2002).
The current project area lies within the Cinco Ranch planned community located
40.23 kilometers (25 miles) west of Houston and 16.10 kilometers (10 miles) north of
Richmond in northern Fort Bend County. The location had been a working cattle ranch and
rice farm dating to the 1930s before the development began in the mid 1980s. The ranch
resulted from the partnership of five families, who gave the location the name of Cinco
Ranch. Cinco Ranch Venture purchased the land in and began the development of the
community. Cinco Ranch encompasses 2913.74 hectares (7200 acres) and had a population
of 11,196 in the year 2000 (Jasinski 2004).

CHAPTER IV. PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

Prehistoric archaeological sites identified in the inland regions of the Gulf Coastal
Plain tend to be composed of ephemeral, shallow deposits reflecting short-term occupation
episodes. In general, these sites consist of temporally non-diagnostic lithic scatters, thin
subsurface deposits, or suggest the presence of multiple cultural components within a mixed
stratigraphic archaeological context. Historic sites near the project area typically consist of
farms or homesteads dating to the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries. Portions of the
current project area are located on land that was either previously surveyed or nearby
previously surveyed areas. These surveys are summarized below.
In 1988, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc. performed an intensive pedestrian
Survey on approximately 273.16 hectares (675 acres) for Cinco Ranch Venture subdivision
in Fort Bend and Harris Counties, Texas. Three sites were recorded as part of the
investigation. These were Sites 41FB182, 41FB183, and 41FB186. These sites were
recorded as prehistoric campsites, two of which (Sites 41FB182 and 41FB183) have potential
for a listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and require further testing
(Moore 1988).
In 2003, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc. conducted an intensive pedestrian
survey of 0.52 hectares (1.28 aces) along Little Prong Creek east of Katy Gaston Road in
northern Fort Bend County, Texas. No previously recorded sites exist in the project area, and
the survey yielded no cultural resources. It was concluded that no additional archeological
investigations were necessary prior to the proposed project (Donachie 2003).
Approximately 68.80 hectares (170 acres) were covered by an intensive pedestrian
survey conducted by Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc., in 2003. This investigation was
requested by the Corps of Engineers-Galveston District. A total of 172 shovel tests were
excavated within a 100-meter buffer of Little Prong Creek. No cultural resources were found
(Mangum and Moore 2003).
Approximately 97.13 hectares (240 acres) were surveyed for the construction of the
Grand Parkway (SH99) by the State Department of Highways and Public Transportation
(SDHPT) in 1990. The survey resulted in no newly discovered cultural resources (SDHPT
1990).
In 1989, 93.08 hectares (230 acres) were surveyed for the widening of SH99. No
sites were found during the survey. One isolated find consisting of an Archaic period dart
point was found during the survey. No other archaeological or historic properties were found
within the proposed project's area of effect (Texas Department of Transportation [TxDOT]
1989).

Prewitt and Associates, Inc., conducted a cultural resources management survey
sponsored by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE)-VD within a 1786.69-hectare (4415acre) area in 1986. In the course of the survey 31 prehistoric and 21 historic sites were
investigated. Of the prehistoric sites, 2 may be eligible for the NRHP, 6 are not eligible, and
23 need further work before confident assessments can be made. Assessments of the historic
resources suggest that 3 sites are NRHP eligible, 16 sites are not eligible, and 2 sites may be
eligible (Fields et al. 1986).

CHAPTER V. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

This intensive pedestrian survey was designed to identify and assess preliminarily
cultural resources that may be impacted by the proposed project. Potential buried and surface
archaeological resources fall within the purview of this investigation.

LITERATURE REVIEW AND SITE FILE RESEARCH STRATEGY
Site file research was initiated by reviewing records maintained by the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas, by consulting on-line research
archives maintained by the Texas Historical Commission (THC). Site file research resulted
in a listing of all previously recorded archaeological sites within 1.6-kilometers (1-mile) of
the project areas, and all recorded historic structures eligible for NRHP listing located
adjacent to the project APEs. Site file research was used to provide a historic context to the
archaeological survey, and additional documentary research was conducted in order to
provide an understanding of the development and history of the APE, the surrounding area,
and southeast Texas in general. This research then was used to prepare an overview history
of the area, and provided an understanding of the contextual framework of Fort Bend County
prehistory and history.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL FIELD METHODS
The intensive pedestrian archaeological investigations associated with the current
undertaking were designed to define all sites, prehistoric and historic, within the defined
project boundaries. In addition to site identification, the intensive pedestrian investigations
also must provide sufficient data to determine whether or not additional investigations will be
required to evaluate fully the potential eligibility of any newly defined site location for
inclusion on the NRHP.
Archaeological survey methods utilized during the intensive pedestrian investigations
consisted of segment and shovel test survey. Segments were defined largely by their location
in relation to fences, access roads, waterways, and other natural and anthropogenic features.
Segments were lettered in the order in which they were surveyed. Within each segment were
a number of shovel tests. Shovel tests were used as a reference to maintain horizontal control
and provenience across a given survey area. In general, shovel tests were positioned at 30-meter
(100-foot) intervals in areas considered to possess high and low probability for containing
cultural materials. Regardless of the interval, linear transects were utilized for the positioning of
the shovel tests across the specific survey area. Dependent upon the terrain, environmental
setting, and groundcover identified at each shovel test location, one of three possible actions was
performed; these possible actions are described below. All actions performed at a specific test

13

location, the general observations of the surveyor, and the results of survey actions were
recorded on a shovel test log, which includes provenience, survey method, and cultural
materials identified.
In areas where sufficient surface visibility allowed for an examination of the ground
surface (i.e. surface visibility in excess of 30 percent), a surface inspection of an area measuring
4 meters2 (43 feet2) was performed at each shovel test. All prehistoric or historic culturally
diagnostic materials identified within this block were collected, bagged and provenienced by
segment and shovel test number. In addition, all diagnostic artifacts noted during transect
survey were recorded by provenience along the segment. The results of the surface inspection
activities were recorded on the shovel test log.
In areas where surface visibility was less than 30 percent, intensive pedestrian
investigations were performed by the excavation of 30-centimeter (12-inch) diameter shovel
tests. Shovel tests also were excavated in areas considered likely to contain intact subsurface
deposits regardless of surface visibility. Shovel tests were typically excavated to a maximum
depth of 100 centimeters (3 feet) into the underlying substratum, or until culturally sterile soil
was encountered. Removed soils were screened through 1/4-inch hardware cloth when possible.
Soils with high clay content were sorted by hand. Descriptions of soil texture and color
followed standard terminology and the Munsell (2000) soil color charts. All recovered
artifacts were bagged and provenienced by segment and shovel test number. The results of the
shovel test activities were recorded on the shovel test log along with any additional information
concerning soils encountered and a drawing of the exposed profiles.
Walkover survey was performed in previously disturbed locations, areas located on
excessive slope (greater than 20 percent) or in areas containing standing water. Information
concerning the environmental and topographic conditions identified during walkover survey
was recorded on the shovel test log.

SITE DEFINITION
If a cultural resource was located, additional shovel tests were excavated at 10-meter
(30-foot) intervals or as the ROW width would allow in an effort to define site boundaries
and to determine the integrity of surface and subsurface deposits. Two consecutive negative
shovel tests excavated in cardinal directions were used to determine site boundaries. For
each resource identified, photographs were taken of the general vicinity and of any visible
features. A sketch map was prepared, showing site limits, feature locations, permanent
landmarks, topographic and vegetational variation, sources of disturbance, and all shovel test
locations. Sufficient information was included on each map to permit relocation of the site.
Notes were taken on surface and vegetational conditions, soil characteristics, dimensions and
construction of features evident, and the amount and distribution of cultural materials
present.

14

CURATION
Artifacts recovered during field investigation are temporarily stored at the Houston
office of HRA Gray & Pape. Following the completion of this project, it is anticipated that
all artifacts will be provided to the landowners. If curation in a state repository is required,
artifacts will be prepared for curation according to guidelines specified by the Secretary of
the Interiorâs Standards and Guidelines for Archaeology and Historic Preservation (1983).
At the completion of fieldwork, the artifacts were appropriately cleaned and allowed
to dry. After identification, each unique artifact or group were placed in 4 mil plastic reclosable bags. Identification tags made from acid-free paper were placed with the artifacts
for future identification. Each tag contains the title of the final report, the HRA Gray & Pape
project number, an individual artifact number, full provenience information, entire artifact
description, processing date, and count.

CHAPTER VI. RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

One previously unrecorded archaeological site was located during survey of the
project area. No previously unrecorded architectural resources appearing to be over 50 years
in age were identified adjacent to the project area.
Twelve previously recorded cultural resources were identified within a 1.6-kilometer
(1-mile) radius of the project area during site file research. These resources consisted of both
prehistoric and historic period components. The results of the site file research are discussed
in the following section, followed by a discussion of the results of the cultural resources field
investigation.

SITE FILE AND LITERATURE RESEARCH RESULTS
Site file research was conducted by consulting on-line research archives maintained
by the THC. Research efforts produced a listing of all recorded archaeological sites within
1.6 kilometers (1-mile) of each project area, and all recorded historic structures eligible for
NRHP listing located immediately adjacent to the projectâs APE.
Cultural resources identified during this literature search included previously recorded
archaeological sites, and previously conducted cultural resources surveys. No previously
recorded architectural resources or NRHP properties were located within the boundaries of the
current project. This review indicated that 12 previously recorded archaeological sites are
located within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the current project area. These sites are listed in
Table 1 below.

Seven of the previously identified sites are recorded as Prehistoric sites generally
containing lithic flakes and ceramics. These are typically located on small rises alongside the
oxbow lakes that lie to either side of the bayou ROW. Four of the sites are recommended as
being potentially eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. Some of these prehistoric sites, in
particular Sites 41FB140 and 41FB141, are recorded close to the current project ROW. Three
sites are recorded as historic structures. Site 41FB92 is recorded as a structure in good condition
that lies adjacent to Clubhouse Lake and reportedly built in 1935. Site 41FB93 is recorded as a
house and garage perhaps dating to the mid 1930âs. The house currently serves as the field
headquarters for Cinco Ranch. Site 41FB94 is recorded as a house dating to the 1920âs. None
of these historic sites were recommended for further work.

INTENSIVE PEDESTRIAN SURVEY RESULTS
Intensive pedestrian survey activities were designed to assess the potential impact that
construction processes might have on archaeological resources located within the Cinco
Ranch Southwest Trails project area. The project area was subdivided into 9 segments based
on the artificial structures, specifically roads and drainages, which divided them. A total of
36 shovel tests were excavated. The locations of these are shown on Figures 2 and 3 and
referenced to segments in Table 2.

Shovel tests were conducted along one transect excavated at 30-meter (100-foot)
intervals within the proposed new trail ROW of Segment A, or near the locations of
previously recorded sites in existing trail ROW Segments B through I. Subsurface
investigation included the excavation of 36 shovel tests to depths ranging between 10 and
100 centimeters (3.94 and 39.37 inches). Shovel tests were terminated when sterile subsoil
was encountered or when 1 meter (3.28 feet) was reached. Shovel tests resulted in a range of
soil profiles indicative of previous impacts within the APE. Representative soil profiles of
the area are seen in Shovel Tests A3, A23, C1, and E2 (Figure 4).
Shovel tests displayed soil profiles typical of the Clodine and Bibb soil series mapped
for the area. These areas displayed a landscape typical of areas that are frequently flooded.
It was visually obvious that portions of the existing trail that near oxbow lakes were filled to
bring the trail level up to a height equal with the bayou ROW. This resulted in 1 meter (3.28
feet) or more of fill being placed on the original surface. Overall, soil profiles displayed a
sandy or silty sand upper horizon overlaying an extremely compacted layer of loam or silty
clay loam. Generally, areas that bordered the existing trail contained vegetation typical of
wetland areas and soils appeared to have a disturbed upper stratum typical of alluvial areas.
Causes of disturbance can be also be attributed to the chanalization of Buffalo Bayou.
Several oxbow lakes were created and / or disturbed in the process.

Site 41FB309
Site 41FB309 was identified through 1 positive shovel test containing a prehistoric
Goose Creek red-filmed ceramic sherd. The site is located on a small rise on the edge of an
unnamed oxbow lake, located south of Buffalo Bayou (Figure 2). Delineation of this site
was accomplished by the placement of shovel tests at 5 to 10-meter (16.40 to 32.81-foot)
intervals radiating out from the positive shovel test in cardinal directions. This interval was
limited to the width of the project ROW. A total of 8 additional shovel tests, excavated to a
maximum depth of 1 meter (3.28 feet) were added, one of which was positive for cultural
material (Figure 5). Details of positive shovel tests are shown in Table 3 below.

CHAPTER VII. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This report presents the findings of an intensive pedestrian survey conducted on
property containing an existing 4.23-kilometer (2.63-mile) hiking and biking trail, and
approximately 0.96 kilometer (0.60 mile) of proposed new trail along Buffalo Bayou in Fort
Bend County, Texas.
Initial investigation consisted of a background literature and site files search to
identify the presence of recorded sites in close proximity to the project area. The search
indicated that no sites are located within the project APE. Twelve previously recorded sites
are located within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) radius of the project area.
Field investigation consisted of surface inspection, walkover, and shovel testing
within the project area. Subsurface investigation included the excavation of 36 shovel tests
in previously undisturbed and disturbed areas to depths ranging between 10 and 100
centimeters (3.94 and 39.37 inches). Survey personnel assessed both proposed new ROW
and existing ROW during the survey.
In general, the soils within the area of proposed new trail ROW showed signs of
periodic inundation and previous disturbance due to the channalization of Buffalo Bayou.
Likewise along existing trail ROW, where much of the surface appeared to be low-lying
floodplain. Also previous disturbances have resulted in the loss of intact soils. This can be
attributed to both natural and manmade processes.
These include flooding, the
channalization of Buffalo Bayou, and by the filling of trail sections that near oxbow lakes.
No cultural materials or features related to previously recorded sites were discovered
within the APE. No previously unrecorded architectural resources appearing to be over 50
years in age were identified adjacent to the project area. One newly recorded archaeological
site (Site 41FB309) was recorded during this survey. The site entailed a prehistoric Goose
Creek red-filmed ceramic fragment and a shell fragment located on a raised area of ground
adjacent to an oxbow lake in the area of proposed new trail ROW. The site, as it is currently
delineated within the current APE, displays very little density. The limited nature of the site
suggests a possible lack of integrity or possible previous disturbance, and therefore HRA
Gray & Pape currently recommends the site as not eligible for inclusion on the NRHP.
During this investigation, shovel tests showed much of the APE to be low-lying
floodplain, some of which has been disturbed by activities related to creek channalization,
specifically dozing and dredge relocation. HRA Gray & Pape recommends that no further
archaeological work is required for the project as it is currently planned. However, if project
plans require disturbance in areas outside the currently planned ROW, further testing should
be undertaken to establish the spatial limits of Site 41FB309.
