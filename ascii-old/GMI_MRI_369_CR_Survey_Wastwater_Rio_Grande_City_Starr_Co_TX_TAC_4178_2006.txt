MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

This report documents the results of a cultural resources survey of two tracts of land for a
proposed water treatment plant and an associated water treatment plant near Rio Grande City in
Starr County, Texas for Camp Dresser & McKee, Inc. The water treatment plant area, which
abuts the Rio Grande on the south, consists of two large tracts totaling 192.49 acres. Of this,
approximately 80 acres required intensive pedestrian survey. The remaining parts of these tracts
have been used for gravel excavation and are thus less likely to yield any intact archaeological
remains or deposits. Two small water plant sites, 20 acres each in size and located on upland
landforms to the northeast and northwest of Rio Grande City, were also surveyed. All properties
involved in this survey project are owned by the City of Rio Grande City, Texas.
The purpose of the cultural resources investigation was to determine the presence/absence of
archaeological resources and to evaluate identified resources for their eligibility for inclusion on
the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), as per Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, or as a designated State Archeological Landmark under
the Antiquities Code of Texas. Fieldwork included reconnaissance survey, pedestrian survey, and
geomorphological investigations. Texas Antiquities Permit 4178 was obtained prior to
investigations in the field.
Two archaeological sites and five isolated occurrences were identified during the survey. Site
evaluations were conducted at both sites in order to determine their potential for eligibility for
listing on the NRHP. Both sites are affiliated with the prehistoric era. They are both chipped
stone quarry and reduction sites. One of these sites, 41SR374, is entirely a surface manifestation.
As a result of its being located atop an exposure of gravels, the lithic reduction debris is likely
representative of numerous use events. As it lacks contextual integrity and the potential to
provide data to an understanding of prehistory in this region, it is recommended ineligible for
inclusion in the NRHP.
The second archaeological site identified, 41SR375, is situated in an upland location within a
previously-plowed lot of land. While some of the larger lithic artifacts at the site were identified
as being partly buried beneath the modern ground surface, geomorphological investigations
indicate that they lack contextual integrity due to the previous agricultural activities at the site.
This site, too, is therefore recommended as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

In June 2006, Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), was awarded a subcontract from Camp Dresser &
McKee, Inc. (CDM), to conduct an intensive archaeological survey of two tracts of land for a
proposed water treatment plant and an associated water treatment plant near Rio Grande City in
Starr County, Texas (Figure 1). The water treatment plant area requiring survey consists of
approximately 80 acres out of two larger tracts totaling 192.49 acres, and abuts the Rio Grande
River on the south (Figure 2). The remaining parts of these tracts have been used for gravel
excavation and are thus less likely to yield any intact archaeological remains or deposits. As
such, no further work was recommended in the remainder of the tracts. Two small alternative
plant sitesâreferred to as the northeastern and northwestern parcelsâmeasure 20 acres each.
They are located on upland landforms to the northeast and northwest of Rio Grande City and
were also subject to survey (Figures 3 and 4). All properties involved in this survey project are
owned by the City of Rio Grande City, Texas.
The purpose of the cultural resources investigation was to determine the presence/absence of
archaeological resources and to evaluate identified resources for their eligibility for inclusion on
the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), as per Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, or as a designated State Archeological Landmark under
the Antiquities Code of Texas. Prior to fieldwork, a review of the site files available online in the
Texas Historical Commissionâs (THC) Archaeological Sites Atlas was conducted. No cultural
resource sites had previously been recorded within any of the three parcels of land, nor within a
mile of the project parcels. However, review of a listing of Historical Markers, also available
through the THC, revealed one indicating the location of a mission on the northern half of the
largest parcel in the project area.
Fieldwork included reconnaissance survey, pedestrian survey, and geoarchaeological
investigations. First, reconnaissance survey was conducted within the entirety of project area to
identify previously impacted and non-impacted areas. Intensive pedestrian survey with shovel
testing was conducted by three archaeologists systematically investigating much of the 80 acre
parcel and most of the two 20 acre parcels. Shovel testing was conducted in areas where ground
cover hindered site detection or in areas of high site probability. This strategy is in accordance
with current survey standards as approved by the THC.

INTENSIVE ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY, RIO GRANDE CITY WATER TREATMENT PLANT, RIO GRANDE CITY, STARR CO., TEXAS

Backhoe testing and geological examination were conducted in areas where the potential for buried
sites is thought to exist (i.e., within the floodplain). Seven backhoe trenches were used as means of
identifying buried land surfaces, documenting Holocene depositional environments, and evaluating
the potential for buried deposits.
Documentation of cultural resources was completed in accordance with the Council of Texas
Archeologists guidelines. A State of Texas site form recording locational information, vegetation
cover, contextual integrity, estimated temporal period, and cultural materials noted was
completed for both sites identified. In addition, a scaled map was drawn for each site using a
Global Positioning System (GPS). Isolated finds of chert flakes or tools were recorded, their
locations noted, and their surrounding vicinities scanned for additional materials.
Timothy Graves served as Project Archaeologist. He was assisted during fieldwork by crew
members Aaron Hockman and Amanda Martinez. Dave Shanabrook provided geoarchaeological
expertise for this project, and Christine G. Ward served as Principal Investigator.
In the following report, the environmental and geological setting of the project area are presented
in Chapter 2. Prehistoric and historic cultural contexts of the project area including previous
research in the area are then presented in Chapter 3. The methods used for survey are discussed
in Chapter 4, followed by discussion of the results of this survey in Chapter 5. Finally, a
summary of our recommendations is presented in Chapter 6.

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The three project areas are located to the west and north of Rio Grande City in Starr County, in
southern Texas (see Figure 1). This part of South Texas is characterized by low elevation and a
hot and humid climate; the most significant factor affecting the regionâs environment is its
relation to the Rio Grande, which bounds the south edge of the county and forms the International
Boundary between the United States and Mexico. Southern Starr Countyâand the project areas
around Rio Grande Cityâincludes the Rio Grande floodplain and terrace, and uplands along
drainages and arroyos leading into it.
In this chapter, the environmental context of the Rio Grande City region is presented. The
physiography, geology, and soils in the region are each summarized, and descriptions of the
present environmentâincluding disturbancesâin the vicinity of each of the project areas are
provided.

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND GEOLOGY
The non-deltaic part of the lower Rio Grande valley regionâin which the project area liesâis in
the Gulf Coastal Plains physiographic province (Fenneman and Johnson 1946). The Gulf Coastal
Plains extend northward and westward from the Gulf Coast, encompassing an area roughly
defined by the extent of the Balcones Escarpment to a point, at its northwest edge, just west of the
Dallas, Texas area (Bureau of Economic Geology 1996). The project area, in the Lower Rio
Grande valley, is near the boundary between two sub-regions of the Gulf Coastal Plains: the
Interior Gulf Coastal Plains and the Coastal Prairies. The Interior Coastal Plains sub-region is
comprised of unconsolidated sand and weak shales that erode into long, sandy ridges. The Coastal
Prairies begin at the Gulf of Mexico shoreline, and are comprised of recently deposited sands,
silts, and clays.
As a whole, there is little topographic relief in the Gulf Coastal Plains, though the elevation at its
northwesternmost pointânear Del Rio, upriver from the project areaânears 1,000-ft (305-m)
above mean sea level (Swanson 1995). Rio Grande City lies at approximately 200-ft (61-m)
elevation above mean sea level.

INTENSIVE ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY, RIO GRANDE CITY WATER TREATMENT PLANT, RIO GRANDE CITY, STARR CO., TEXAS

Spearing (1991:106) characterizes the area in the Rio Grande City area as being comprised of
siltstones and pinkish claystones, topped with a hard pebbly, gray sandstone. Ridges form from
erosion of this Goliad Formation sandstone. Primary sediments throughout the areaâall
sedimentaryâresulted from the Cenozoic subsidence of the Gulf of Mexico (Spearing 1991;
Swanson 1995).

SOILS
Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) soils maps for Starr County were consulted, and
the three project areas are each dominated by different soils. In the area of the proposed water
treatment plant, Lagloria silt loam and McAllen fine sandy loam are present. Lagloria silt loam
consists of very deep, well-drained, nearly-level soils in bottomland locations. This soil
dominates that area between U.S. Highway 83 and the Rio Grande (see Figure 1). It is generally
a light brownish-gray silt loam extending up to 60-in (150-cm) in depth. McAllen fine sandy
loam is present among the nearly-level to gently sloping uplands in the northern part of this same
tract. It consists of deep, well-drained sediments that is a fine sandy loam to approximately 14-in
(36-cm) depth overlying sandy clay loam. Pits and quarries, present in some of this northern half
of the proposed water treatment plant project area, have obscured the original soils in those areas.
In the northwest of the three project areas (see Figure 1), soils of the Jimenez-Quemado
Association dominate. These soils are shallow, well-drained, and located in upland locations.
They formed in gravelly alluvium, and consist of gravelly sandy loam; underlying material is
caliche and found at approximately 12-in (30.5-cm) depth. The third of the project areas, located
to the northeast, is dominated by McAllen fine sandy loam, as described above.

PRESENT ENVIRONMENT IN THE PROJECT AREAS
The large southern parcel, comprised of the Fordyce Tract # 2 (South of U.S. Highway 83) and
Fordyce Tract # 1 (North of U.S. Highway 83), includes several distinct areas with regard to
topography, geology, and flora. Fordyce Tract # 2 is located primarily on Pleistocene fluviatile
terrace deposits, with a small sectionâin the far southeast and east-central partâconsisting of
recent Holocene alluvial deposits. Surface sediments in Fordyce Tract # 2 consisted primarily of
a very pale brown silt loam with a trace of gravel inclusions with a few areas containing moderate
densities of gravel inclusions. Flora in Fordyce Tract # 2 was quite formidable and included
honey mesquite, blackbrush acacia, granjeno, and Mimosa spp., behemoth prickly pear cacti
forming extremely dense stands, and a wide variety of grasses (Figure 5). Surface visibility in
some areas with high densities of grasses restricted visibility to less than 10 percent of the
surfaces otherwise surface visibility ranged from 30 to 60 percent.
Fordyce Tract # 1 is entirely located on Pleistocene fluviatile terrace deposits. The area has been
impacted by agricultural activities. The area was last tilled an estimated five to six years prior
according to locales in the area. Surface sediments consisted of a light brown (Munsell 7.5 YR
6/4) sandy loam with a trace of gravel inclusions. The flora included mainly nut grass obscuring
30 to 40 percent of the surfaces with occasional Honey mesquite (Figure 6). Some prickly pear,
acacia, and other shrubs are located in the far- east portion of this parcel.

The northeast 20-acre parcel is located on the northeast slope of a Pliocene-age hilltop and an
associated southeast to northwest trending drainage basin (Figure 7). The southwestern half of
the area is situated entirely upon exposed Goliad Formation bedrock with minimal surface
sediments. Surface sediments consist of a reddish-brown sandy loam with moderate densities of
gravel deposits and roughly 20 to 40 percent surface exposure of bedrock and caliche. The
northeastern half of the parcel lies in a drainage basin. Surface sediments here include brown
sandy loam with low densities of gravel deposits. The surface visibility ranged from 60 to 70
percent across the entire 20-acre parcel. The flora in the area includes mesquite, Javalina bush,
prickly pear, all thorn, grasses, and an indeterminate bush that may be sumac. The only part of
this area that has been disturbed by modern activity is in the southeast part of the project area
where Texas Highway 755 extends through the area.

The northwest 20-acre parcel is located near and within the western headwaters of an intermittent
eastward-trending drainage leading into Los Olmos Creek. This lot is on top of a Pliocene or
Pleistocene-age surface associated with the Uvalde Gravel surfaces. More than one-third of the
parcel had been severely altered by heavy equipment to depths exceeding 1.0-m (Figure 8). The
northwest quarter has been residentially developed. Surface sediments in areas not disturbed
included light brown sandy loam with moderate to extremely high densities of gravel inclusions.
The surface visibility in the parcel ranges from 70 to 80 percent. The flora in the area includes
mesquite, acacia, yucca baccatta, prickly pear, a variety of other cacti, and a variety of grasses.
The east half of the parcel appears not to have been disturbed by modern activity.

CULTURAL CONTEXT AND PREVIOUS RESEARCH

Archaeological investigations in the lower Rio Grande valley of South Texas have been relatively
limited, and it is one of the least researched areas in the state (Black 1989). Recently, however,
there have been a number of summaries of the prehistoric and historic contexts for the region
(e.g., Black 1989; Hester 2004; Ricklis 2004). In this chapter, a regional chronology, based on
these and other resources, as cited, and a summary of previous archaeological investigations in
the lower Rio Grande valleyâfocusing on the project areas in the vicinity of Rio Grande Cityâ
are presented (Table 1). Much of the following summary has also been previously presented
(Cooper et al. 2003; Gibbs et al. 2006).

PREHISTORIC CULTURAL SEQUENCE
The prehistoric cultural sequence for South Texas is separated into three sequential temporal and
cultural periods: Paleo-Indian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric (see Table 1). The dates for this
chronology are based on a comprehensive study of the region conducted by Black (1989).

13

INTENSIVE ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY, RIO GRANDE CITY WATER TREATMENT PLANT, RIO GRANDE CITY, STARR CO., TEXAS

Paleo-Indian Period
The Paleo-Indian period (ca. 9500-6000 B.C.) is generally characterized as the period when small
highly mobile social groups relied heavily upon hunting of Late Pleistocene megafauna, though
data for the immediate project area are lacking. In addition, estuarine and coastal resources
available further downstream near the mouth of the Rio Grande would also likely have been
important resources to Paleo-Indian populations in the region. The hunting emphasis is perhaps a
mischaracterization, as data from other regions across North America now indicate more reliance
on gathering and processing of plant species than has previously been recognized.
Paleoenvironmental data for adjacent south-central Texas to the north of the project area indicate
that temperatures were generally cooler and the climate more humid during this time period than
today (Bousman et al. 1990). Paleo-Indian populations likely hunted extinct species including
mastodon, mammoth, large tortoise, and long nosed peccary. Other species, such as bison, that
are missing today from South Texas, were probably also used by these populations (Black 1989;
Bousman et al. 1990). Plant data are generally missing from the archaeological record for this
period. Though these regional data are few, indications from nearby regions are that a broad
spectrum of both plants and animals were relied upon.
No Paleo-Indian period sites, nor confirmed isolated finds dating to this period, have been
recorded or reported from within or in the larger vicinity of the project area. A few sites and
isolated finds, however, have been reported from nearby areas and they give an idea of what
could be present. Some, such as the Perdida Site (Weir 1956), located in north of the project area
in Starr County, are broad, exposed lithic scatters with evidence for thousands of years of
occupation and use. Paleoindian period projectile point types included Plainview, Meserve,
Angostura, Scottsbluff, and Clovis. Hundreds of projectile points however, dating to several
different temporal periods, were documented from the surface of the site and subsurface
investigations were not conducted; subsurface extent to the deposits is unknown. Sites in Willacy
County, to the east and downstream of the project area, produced extinct tortoise shell fragments
that were dated to 9,360Â±415 Before Present (B.P.) from an undisturbed context 70-80 cm below
the surface (Bousman et al. 1990), indicating the possibility of buried deposits dating to this era in
the region. Isolated Paleo-Indian projectile point discoveries include a Folsom projectile point
base found near Laguna Atascosa (Anderson field notes, TARL files), and a Lerma-type
projectile point found within the dune fields of Willacy County (Mallouf et al. 1977:167-168).
Isolated finds, such as these, could indicate use of the area by Paleo-Indian populations; however,
such projectile points may also have been curated items picked up by later prehistoric populations
and deposited far from their point of origin.

Archaic Period
The Paleo-Indian to Archaic period transition in the South Texas Plains is marked by a shift from
an apparent greater emphasis on a big-game hunting subsistence strategy to one stressing more
generalized broad-spectrum hunting and gathering (Black 1989). This subsistence modification
was accompanied by gradual changes in technology, settlement, and population as well, as
reflected in the division of the long Archaic era into three sequential periods.

14

CHAPTER 3: CULTURAL CONTEXT AND PREVIOUS RESEARCH

Early Archaic Period
The Early Archaic period (6000 B.C.-2500 B.C.) has been suggested as representing a shift from a
highly nomadic hunting and gathering lifestyle during the Paleoindian period to a slightly less
mobile, broader-spectrum subsistence strategy. A reduction in large game species caused by
depredation and/or environmental factors may have promoted usage of a greater diversity of plant
and animal resources. Subsistence data that do exist for areas adjacent to the project region
indicate use of fresh-water mussels, land snails, turtle, and fresh-water drum (Scott and Fox
1982).
A technological shift from Paleo-Indian lanceolate points to Early Archaic stemmed dart points is
characteristic for the transition. Reasons for the change are not yet understood. Early Archaic
projectile point styles within the Coastal Bend of South Texas, as described by Black (1989),
include Andice, Bell, Early Triangular, and early expanding stem forms such as Bandy,
Martindale, Uvalde, and other similar dart points. Also included in these assemblages are large
triangular bifaces with concave bases, Guadalupe bifacial tools, and Clear Fork unifacial tools
(Black 1989:49).
As with the Paleo-Indian period, Early Archaic period archaeological data are lacking for the
lower Rio Grande valley. No known Early Archaic period sites are within or adjacent to the
project area. Extrapolations from inland and coastal areas to the north and northeast indicate that
groups during this time remained small in size and were highly mobile within relatively large
territories (Black 1989; McKinney 1981). Most sites are located on high terraces, or upland
locations, though a few Early Archaic period components have been found deeply buried in
alluvial deposits well to the north of the project area (Scott and Fox 1982). Upland sites
frequently occur on exposures of Uvalde gravels, which consist of large quantities of knappable
chert. These gravels served as quarry locations throughout the Archaic and into the Late
prehistoric eras. As a result, thousands of years of cultural use may be exposed on the surface at
one of these quarry sites.

Middle Archaic Period
Little evidence of Middle Archaic (2500-400 B.C.) assemblages exists as well within the lower
Rio Grande valley. As with earlier time periods, the data presented below are summarized from
research in adjacent areas in order to form a broad picture of cultural adaptations during this time
period.
As presently known for South Texas, the Middle Archaic period continues the shift to a greater
reliance on plant resources, based on the presence of dated burned rock middens that might be
related to those found in central Texas (Hall et al. 1986). Open campsites, hearths, earth ovens,
and burned rock accumulations are found on floodplains, terraces, natural levees along present
and former stream channels, and in upland locales (Black 1989; Hester 2004). Late in the Middle
Archaic period, and continuing somewhat into the Late Archaic, cemeteries are found in parts of
South Texas (Hester 2004), though, again, none have been recorded in the project area. Upland
sites also frequently occur on exposures of Uvalde gravels, and assemblages may be mixed with
earlier and later quarry uses.

15

INTENSIVE ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY, RIO GRANDE CITY WATER TREATMENT PLANT, RIO GRANDE CITY, STARR CO., TEXAS

Middle Archaic period lithic technologies are identified relatively easily in the archaeological
record; triangular dart points, particularly Tortugas and Abasolo, dominate among lithic
assemblages (Hester 2004:138). Other projectile point types and lithic tools that occur in Middle
Archaic contexts include Matamoros, Palmillas, Morhiss, and Bulverde dart points, and unifacial
and bifacial distally beveled tools that have been heavily reworked and resharpened. Other
artifacts appearing in the archaeological record from this period include incised bone, tubular
stone pipes, conch columella gouges, and conch adzes (Black 1989).

Late Archaic Period
Late Archaic period sites (400 B.C.-A.D. 700) are more common within the lower Rio Grande
valley. Sites are generally characterized by dense accumulations of burned rock, hearths, and
earth ovens, and are often located adjacent to present stream channels. Lithic procurement sites
are often on high terrace exposures of gravels (Hester 2004). As with upland locations used
during earlier time periods, assemblages may be mixed with both earlier and later quarry uses.
While cemetery sites may have continued throughout the southern and central coastal region of
Texas (Hall 1981; Lukowski 1987), isolated burials may also be found throughout the region
(Hester 2004).
Corner-notched or side-notched projectile points, as well as smaller triangular styles, typify those
found in Late Archaic assemblages and include Ensor, Frio, Marcos, Fairland, Catan, Matamoros,
and Ellis dart points. Beveled tools are common, and corner-tanged bifaces, while found, are
more rare (Black 1989). Ground stone artifacts are also frequently identified at these sites.
Subsistence data indicate use of a wide variety of fish, shellfish, and small mammals, suggesting
a greater emphasis on collection rather than hunting and gathering. Farther inland, a variety of
plant species was used, in addition to small mammals (rabbits, rodents, etc.). Population densities
were higher during this period than before and may have been a continuation of population
growth during the Middle Archaic (Black 1989). Trading of items between inland and coastal
groups is suggested by the presence of shell pendants some distance inland (Hall 1981).

Late Prehistoric Period
The Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 800-1600) is probably the best understood of the prehistoric
sequence because the remains are more numerous and better preserved than those of previous
periods. Radiocarbon dates from this period are relatively more common, allowing for more
precise temporal control. In addition, the few ceramics that exist have aided in understanding the
Late Prehistoric period in South Texas.
Near the mouth of the Rio Grande, downriver of the project area, a distinctive Late Prehistoric
period complex has been defined that began around A.D. 1000. The Brownsville Complex, first
postulated by Sayles (1935), is relatively well confined to the Rio Grande Delta. Characterized
particularly by the manufacture of shell ornaments, the presence of âexoticâ lithic materials such
as obsidian, jadeite, and serpentine, and ceramics, this complex likely has an origin in the
Huastecan region of Mexico (Ekholm 1944; MacNeish 1947; see discussion in Ricklis 2004).

16

CHAPTER 3: CULTURAL CONTEXT AND PREVIOUS RESEARCH

Several Late Prehistoric period cemeteries have been documented in the lower Rio Grande valley
area, though not within the present project area. Two of the larger, better-studied examples are
the Floyd Morris site (41CF2; Collins et al. 1969) and the Ayala site (41HG1; Campbell and
Frizzell 1949; Hester and Rodgers 1971; Hester and Ruecking 1969). These sites are discrete
cemeteries and appear not to be associated with habitation areas. Many of the graves contain
quantities of funerary items, and the human remains are usually discovered in bundled or flexed
positions. Cremated remains and skeletons covered in red ochre have also been located
(Campbell and Frizzell 1949; Hester and Ruecking 1969). The formal cemetery sites, the shell
industry, and the Huastecan-like ceramics may strongly indicate semi-sedentary settlement and
subsistence strategies during the Late Prehistoric period in this region.
Subsistence dataâfrom limited numbers of excavations as well as extrapolated information from
ethnohistorical documentsâsuggest that the river and the coast both played strong roles during
the Late Prehistoric period. Hunting, gathering of plant resources, and fishing are all represented
(Ricklis 2004). These populations were likely semi-sedentary, establishing seasonal or temporary
camps in places where specific resources might be available.

HISTORIC PERIOD SEQUENCE
With the European discovery of the area in 1519 and the subsequent exploration, traded and
discarded European goods became available to aboriginal groups. Later, Spanish settlements
traded with aboriginal groups and educated them in such skills as wheel-turned pottery making.
Consequently, these sites contain artifacts that include glass or metal projectile points, trade
beads, and wheel-made ceramics, augmenting previous technologies with new materials. Four
historic aboriginal sites have been located within the lower Rio Grande valley, including 41CF8
and three others discovered by A. E. Anderson (Kibler 1994).

The lower Rio Grande valley was subject to early exploration by the Spanish, and was settled
early in the Historic era. The history of the U.S. portion of the lower Rio Grande is intermeshed
with the history of Mexico. The following discussion on the history of the lower Rio Grande
region is primarily summarized from Cooper and others (2003), though other sources are cited as
well. For additional information, the reader is directed to some of the many volumes that have
been written on this topic (Alonzo 1998; Fontana 1994; Graham 1994; P. Kelley 1986; Perttula et
al. 1997; SÃ¡nchez 1994; Tijerina 1998).

Early Exploration Colonial Settlement
There were numerous visits to the region by various Spanish expeditions throughout the sixteenth
century, but these were restricted largely to the coastal region and the area around the mouth of
the Rio Grande. The earliest Spanish visits to southern Starr County were likely in the
seventeenth century. Jacinto de Sepulveda crossed through the area in 1638 while on a search for
rumored Dutch sailors along the coast. In 1747, a foray by Alonso de Leon passed through while
searching for Fort St. Louis, a French settlement also along the coast.
In spite of a 1747 declaration by Miguel de la Garza that the area was unsuitable for raising stock
or agriculture, Jose de Escandon, in 1749, was given the task of colonizing the inland part of the
lower Rio Grande valley in order to provide settlements along the northern border of Spanish
17

INTENSIVE ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY, RIO GRANDE CITY WATER TREATMENT PLANT, RIO GRANDE CITY, STARR CO., TEXAS

settlements (Handbook of Texas Online: Starr County). The Spanish colonial administrators in
New Spain originally intended for settlements in southern Texas and much of northern Mexico to
be established as a line of northern defense. They called this protective line of defense the
âfronteraâ, and their strategy was to settle it with a hearty stock of people who would serve as a
buffer colony protecting Monterrey and Saltillo from the hostile American Indians of Texas
(Cooper et al. 2003).
Numerous journals and diaries were kept describing the terrain. From these records, it appears
that the EscandÃ³n party was able to ascertain that three separate rivers ran into the Rio Grande
from the south: the Salado, the San Juan, and the Alamo. EscandÃ³n hoped to establish
settlements near these three rivers since the surrounding areas could be easily irrigated (Alonzo
1998:29).
Over a span of four years, primary settlements were founded along the south bank of the Rio
Grande. La Villa de Santa Ana de Camargo (at modern-day Camargo, across the river from
present-day Rio Grande City) and Nuestra SeÃ±ora de Guadalupe de Reynosa (at Reynosa) were
established in 1749. Villa de San Ignacio de Revilla (Revilla), later known as Guerrero, was
established 1750 and Lugar de Mier (Mier) was established 1752 (SÃ¡nchez 1994:27-28).
Settlement efforts to the north of the Rio Grande were not undertaken as quickly as those to the
south as the land was generally not considered as favorable because of limited amounts of water
and a much greater chance of Indian hostilities.
Most of the original land grantsâin the form of either porciÃ³nes or ranchosâin the project area
were established from the apportionments initially set up by EscandÃ³n (Alonzo 1998:36-39). The
porciÃ³nes were long and thin, running perpendicular to the river, to allow equitable access to
water. Beyond the riverfront porciÃ³nes, EscandÃ³n had established a wider band of very large
cattle-grazing ranchos. These ranchos, along with those around San Antonio, were the
beginnings of the American cattle industry.
In 1750, JosÃ© Vasquez Borrego became the first Spaniard to establish a settlement north of the
river. This settlement was known as Nuestra SeÃ±ora de los Dolores and was located upriver from
the project area. It began as a rancho and then continued as a small community (it was
abandoned in 1815). In 1763, Rancho Carnestolendas was established on porciÃ³n 80 by
Francisco de la Garza Martinez. Rancho Carnestolendas was located on the site that is now Rio
Grande City (Handbook of Texas Online: Blas Maria de la Garza Falcon). Corrales de los Saenz,
a community founded on porciÃ³nes 71 and 72, was also founded around 1763. It later became
the community of Roma, just upstream of Rio Grande City.
There is currently a paucity of information on Spanish colonial archaeology from the Lower Rio
Grande valley, despite the well-documented historical record. For discussions of these
deficiencies, see Fox (1989:91) and Cooper and others (2003).

Upheaval
These large-scale ranching operations continued to provide the primary occupation in this portion
of the project area for many years. However, significant political changes occurred that affected
the area from ca. 1800 to 1920 because the lower Rio Grande valley was often disputed territory.
Troop movements and numerous battles occurred throughout the area. Beginning in 1821 with
18

CHAPTER 3: CULTURAL CONTEXT AND PREVIOUS RESEARCH

Mexican Independence from Spain, the area was in political upheaval until Texas achieved
statehood in 1846. Both the Republic of Texas and Mexico laid claim to the region, just as the
United States and Mexico would later. After statehood, however, the area was still the setting for
various conflicts, including ones during the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), the escapades
of Juan Nepomuceno Cortina (1859-1860), the Civil War (1861-1865), and Mexican political
upheavals and revolution (1865-1918).
One early conflict that impacted the region resulted in the short-lived Republic of the Rio Grande.
At the time of Texas independence in 1836, Mexico refused to relinquish its claim on lands in the
Rio Grande valley and continued to garrison the small villages along the river. Mexican citizens
who wanted more self-determination than they had under Mexicoâs centralist government
protested, and conflicts between Mexican troops and Mexican citizens erupted. Because many
Mexicans owned property on both sides of the river, these engagements took place on both sides
as well. Much of this conflict took place in the lower reaches of the Rio Grande, where men such
as Antonio Canales and Antonio Zapata held sway. In 1840, Canales called for a convention to
meet and form the Republic of the Rio Grande, with Laredo serving as the capital (SÃ¡nchez
1994:35). However, forces from the Mexican central government soon entered Laredo and the
revolution was put down (Cooper et al. 2003).
Shortly after Texas won its independence from Mexico, the Mexican government attempted to
regain Texas. Between 1842 and 1844, a second Texas-Mexican war took place. Santa Anna
refused to recognize the Republic of Texas and went so far as to order Mexican soldiers across
the Rio Grande. This intrusion, of course, led to hostilities between Mexico and Texas.
Skirmishes continued until Mexican forces at the Battle of Mier soundly defeated a rag-tag
company of Texas soldiers. Eventually though, in 1844, a peace treaty was signed between Santa
Anna and the Republic of Texas.
The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, signed in 1846, had a direct bearing on the project area. The
first provision made the United States responsible for containing marauding Indians, and the
second provision made the Rio Grande an âInternational Waterway,â recognizing Mexicoâs right
to use the river for transportation (Carlson et al. 1990:8). In 1847, the town of Rancho Davis was
established by Henry Clay Davis near the site of the former Carnestolendas Ranch. Camp
Ringgold, later Fort Ringgold, was established at Rancho Davis in 1848. When Starr County was
organized in 1848, Rancho Davis was renamed Rio Grande City and established as the county
seat (Handbook of Texas Online: Starr County). Fort Ringgold was closed in 1944; many of the
buildings were purchased by the county school district.

The Rio Grande for Travel and Exploration
From the time the Rio Grande was first encountered by explorers and settlers, an interest was
generated in using its waters for transport and trade. The first attempt to travel upriver by
steamship was made around 1828 (Kelley 1986:18-19); its main purpose was not trade but
exploration. How far upriver the navigators reached is not recorded. Shortly thereafter, an
enterprising native of Maine named Alpheus Rackliffe began a flatboat business that ran a regular
route as far upriver as Presidio Del Rio Grande, situated on the south side of the river and across
from present-day Eagle Pass, well upstream of the project area.

19

INTENSIVE ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY, RIO GRANDE CITY WATER TREATMENT PLANT, RIO GRANDE CITY, STARR CO., TEXAS

Regular river traffic developed after the annexation of Texas to the United States in 1846. This
was facilitated by the construction of a shipyard located near the mouth of the river that could
both build and repair ships. The shipyard had been built at the behest of General Zachary Taylor,
who felt that steam power was the most logical way for him to transport men and supplies during
the Mexican-American War (Kelley 1986:31). During this period (1846-1848), the Major
Brown, under the command of Captain Mark Sterling, made a thorough examination of the Rio
Grande and traveled upriver as far as Laredo.
The Mexican-American War brought other men to the river that would have a dramatic impact on
the region; among these men were Mifflin Kenedy, Richard King, and W. W. Chapman. These
men, along with Charles Stillman of Brownsville, would come to dominate river trade. Much of
the early success of steamboat traffic on the Rio Grande was due to the constant demands of
supplies for the large military presence along the river because of the Mexican-American War.
When regular steam traffic was initiated, the town of Roma (immediately upsteam of Rio Grande
City in southern Starr County) became the head of navigation on the Rio GrandeâRio Grande
City also became a trading center as a result. Steamboats continued to be a profitable pursuit
until the coming of the railroad in the 1880s. One known steamboat wreck (41CF177) occurred
close to Brownsville; others potentially exist as numerous boats are known or suspected to have
been lost in or near the Rio Grande.

Secession and Civil War
The Texas Secession Convention met in Austin in 1861 and voted overwhelmingly to secede
from the United States, and the citizens of the lower Rio Grande valley agreed with the vote. Prosecession sentiment in the valley was a matter of the strong ties many prominent families in the
region had to Austin; the issue of slavery was not important to the lower Rio Grande valley
region (SÃ¡nchez 1994:55). While there were many encounters in the lower Rio Grande valley
between the Confederate and Union forces during the Civil War, they were primarily in and
around Brownsville.
Settlement in Starr County underwent growth in the late 1860s, primarily due to Civil War
veterans who stayed in the region to make their fortunes (Handbook of Texas Online: Starr
County). Few purchased land, and many made their livings through smuggling and trading.
Many married into established Hispanic families in the region.

Irrigation and Farming on the Rio Grande
A plan to establish an irrigation dam on the Rio Grande upriver of Rio Grande City was first put
forth in 1891 (Handbook of Texas Online: Starr County). In the early twentieth century, as the
potential for agriculture in the lower Rio Grande valley became apparent, several irrigation
districts were developed. The San Benito Land and Water Company as well as the American Rio
Grande Land and Irrigation Company are only two of these, both near the mouth of the Rio
Grande (Cooper et al. 2003). Irrigation did not come to Rio Grande City at this time, and the
economy of southern Starr County continued to be foremost based on ranching. During World
War II, when the country was searching for new sources of rubber, an experiment was conducted
in Rio Grande City to grow guayle, a rubber-producing desert shrub. While cultivation of
guayale did continue after the war, it waned with time. Crops, primarily vegetables, feed crops,
and cotton, are still grown today along the Rio Grande on irrigated lands.
20

CHAPTER 3: CULTURAL CONTEXT AND PREVIOUS RESEARCH

PREVIOUS RESEARCH
Prior to fieldwork, a search of the Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas was undertaken for the
project area. No known archaeological sites are located within a mile of any of the three project
parcels. Expanding the search however, to include a radius of 2 miles includes a number of
recorded archaeological sites.
No known sites are located anywhere near the southern parcel (consisting of the Fordyce #1 and
Fordyce #2 tracts), in spite of their proximity to the river and thus a higher likelihood for
occupation and use during the prehistoric and historic eras. An Historical Marker (Marker
Number 4936) lies along Highway 83 adjacent to the Fordyce Property. This marker recognizes
the presence, at one time, in the area of the Mission San Augustin de Laredo a Visita.
Mission San Augustin de Laredo a Visita was established in this area in 1749 as part of Jose de
Escandonâs project to settle this region. As it was built in association with La Villa de Santa Ana
de Camargo, across the river from present-day Rio Grande Cityâand it was not until 1750 that
the first settlement was established north of the river in the form of the settlement known as
Nuestra SeÃ±ora de los Doloresâthe location of the mission was almost certainly not in the
project area. It was not until 1763, when Rancho Carnestolendas was established on porciÃ³n 80
by Francisco de la Garza Martinez, that the area of Rio Grande City was first settled. The
Historical Marker was placed in its present location in 1936 as marking the one-hundredth year of
Texas Independence, and its placement likely had little to do with actual indications of Mission
remains in the immediate area; instead, its placement here was more likely to recognize the
establishment of Spanish presence in the region.
Three previously recorded archaeological sites are within a 2-mile radius of the northwestern
parcel. Sites 41SR258-260 were recorded as part of a project involving a proposed dike for the
Rio Grande (Cole 1979). They are located to the southeast of the project parcel, on the north
edge of Rio Grande City and on the south/west terrace overlooking Los Olmos Creek. All three
sites are presumed prehistoric occupations, as represented by surface scatters of lithic artifacts.
All sites are quite small, ranging from 15-x-15 m in size to 30-x-30 m in size. Two of the sites,
41SR259-260, have some subsurface extent, based on trowel tests at one site and observed
erosional disturbance at the second. Firm, or even estimated, dates for these sites are not
provided on the site forms.
Five previously-recorded sites are within a 2-mile radius of the northeastern parcel. Sites
41SR109-111, and 41SR113-114 are all situated to the west-southwest of this parcel. These
sitesâas well as others located farther outside the researched radius of the present project area,
were recorded in the mid-1970s during a project conducted by the University of Texas at San
Antonio. These sites are all located alongside an unnamed drainage leading into Los Olmos
Creek. Three of the sites were identified as âlithicâ sites, one as a lithic quarry, and one as a
possible campsite. All are presumed to date to the prehistoric era. The sites range from 50-x50 m to 100-x-150 m in size; site 41SR114 is plotted much larger than the others on the
topographic map, but no precise size is provided on the site form. Estimates of age for these sites
are also not known based on the site forms.
Given the nature of these known archaeological sites in the project area, and the near-ubiquitous
presence of lithic quarry sites across gravel exposures throughout South Texas (see Black 1979;
Hester 2004), we anticipated the presence of cultural materials on the surveyed propertiesâin
21

INTENSIVE ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY, RIO GRANDE CITY WATER TREATMENT PLANT, RIO GRANDE CITY, STARR CO., TEXAS

particular, we anticipated the presence of lithic quarries or scatters if gravels were exposed on the
modern ground surface, particularly in upland locations. Such lithic scatters on gravel exposures
are often surface-only manifestations, and sometimes involve the conflation of several instances
of use over spans of time in excess of thousands of years on a single exposed surface.

22

CHAPTER 4
SURVEY METHODS

The purpose of the proposed cultural resources investigation was to determine the presence or
absence of archaeological resources, and to evaluate identified resources for their eligibility for
inclusion on the NRHP, as per Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as
amended, or as a designated State Archeological Landmark under the Antiquities Code of Texas.
Texas Antiquities Permit 4178 was obtained prior to investigations in the field.
The project consisted of an intensive survey of a proposed water treatment plant, and two small
water plant sites for Rio Grande City in Starr County. The water treatment plant area, which abuts
the Rio Grande on the south, was determined to require survey in approximately 80 of the total
192.49 acres (see Figure 2; this parcel is referred to as the Fordyce Property, or Fordyce Tract #1
and Tract #2). The remaining approximately 112 acres have previously been impacted by use as
a gravel quarry and are not likely to yield intact archaeological remains or deposits, and thus no
further work was recommended in this larger 112 or so acres of the Fordyce Property. Two small
water plant sites, 20 acres each in size and located on upland landforms to the northeast and
northwest of Rio Grande City were also surveyed (see Figures 3 and 4; these tracts are referred to
as the northeastern (El Tanque) and northwestern (El Sauz) parcels, respectively).
Prior to fieldwork, a review of the site files at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory was
undertaken. This review examined the records of known sites within a mile of the project
corridor. No known archaeological sites are located within that distance of the 3 project parcels.
An Historical Marker, however, is located along one edge of the project area. Marker Number
4936 indicates the previous presence and importance of the Mission San Augustin de Laredo a
Visita. The area was inspected and no cultural resources were apparent. The site of the mission
itself is most likely across the river, as it was established prior to settlement on the north side of
the Rio Grande.
The field investigations included reconnaissance survey, pedestrian survey, and
geoarchaeological investigations. The reconnaissance survey was conducted within the entirety
of project area. This effort assisted in identification impacted and non-impacted areas. Intensive
pedestrian survey with shovel testing was conducted by three professional archaeologists who
systematically investigated 33.5 acres in the southern parcel south of U.S. Highway 83, 44.5 acres
in the northern parcel just north and abutting U.S. Highway 83 and two 20 acre parcels. The
23

INTENSIVE ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY, RIO GRANDE CITY WATER TREATMENT PLANT, RIO GRANDE CITY, STARR CO., TEXAS

intensive pedestrian survey included walking at 15 m intervals. These transects were oriented
east-west in the southern portion of the Fordyce Tract 2, north-south in the Fordyce Tract # 1,
east-west in the northeast 20 acre parcel and north-south in the northwest 20 acre parcel.
Intensive surface inspection was conducted within a 15 to 30 m radius of any surface cultural
evidence encountered. Shovel testing was conducted in areas where ground cover hindered site
detection, in areas of high site probability, and establishing and/or determining site extents
horizontally subsurface and depth of cultural deposits within identified cultural resource sites.
This strategy was in accordance with current survey standards as approved by the THC. The Los
Adjuntas Banco area in Fordyce Tract 2 received particularly close examination.
Backhoe trenching and geoarchaeological examination were conducted in areas where the
potential for buried sites exists (i.e., at stream crossings and within the floodplain) as well as near
one identified surface site. Trenching in the Rio Grande floodplain, particularly in the east half of
Fordyce Tract 2, was conducted to identify buried land surfaces, locate buried sites, and
document Holocene depositional environments. Seven trenches were excavated to adequately
examine the potential for buried deposits.
Cultural resource site boundaries were delimited by the archaeological crew, based on surface
distribution of artifacts and through the placement of shovel tests. Shovel tests were
approximately 30 cm in diameter. Sediments from each shovel test were screened through Â¼inch mesh hardware cloth. In order to estimate depth of deposit, shovel tests were excavated to
the base of cultural deposits. Other shovel tests were excavated to either the top of the B-horizon
or to a depth of 100 cm below surface. All artifactual material recovered from shovel tests were
collected and analyzed. All shovel tests on sites were systematically placed to determine the
extent of subsurface cultural bearing deposits.
Surface collections of both historic and prehistoric materials involved only temporally diagnostic
artifacts or tools. A single projectile point, daing to the Prehistoric era, was collected from
surface contexts. Likewise, a single decorated ceramic was collected that dated to the Historic
era.
Site documentation was completed in accordance with the Council of Texas Archeologists
guidelines. A State of Texas site form recording locational information, vegetation cover,
contextual integrity, estimated temporal period, and artifactual material noted was completed for
the sites identified. In addition, a global positioning system (GPS) was used to map the sites and
GPS data points were recorded for each site datum, collected surface artifact, shovel tests. Sketch
maps of each site were also produced. The GPS information was stored electronically and
downloaded. Differential correction of the GPS data was done using the Texas Department of
Transportation Pharr, Texas Base Station. This information was used to generate site maps
showing the datum location, shovel test locations, site boundary, and other relevant information.
The provenience of these was documented using a sub-meter accuracy GPS (0.9 m) and the
appropriate UTM coordinate were recorded. Sufficient information was recorded to permit the
completion of site forms approved by the THC for sites located in Texas.
A complete photographic record was also kept and used to record cultural resource sites, the
general topography and condition of the area at the time of the survey. All photographs were
documented as to date, direction, and content, and a digital format was also used to record the
level of fieldwork conducted. Each site was photographed from the datum towards all cardinal
dsirections and documented damage evident to the cultural property by earth disturbances.
24

CHAPTER 4: SURVEY METHODS

The sites located were identified by a temporary marker. The markers contained identifying
numbers in the form of âGMI 30119.00.06â2 and GMI 30119.00.06â3â. This number is a
temporary field number only. Site designations were applied only to clusters of artifacts (whether
surface or subsurface) that represent occupation or activity areas. Field notes concerning sites
were maintained by the project archaeologist. These field notes documented survey conditions,
vegetation cover, and initial interpretations of the cultural properties.
The data analysis for the project involved description and evaluation of all recorded cultural
resource sites. Additionally, artifact data collected during fieldwork were also analyzed and
described. These data were supplemental in formulating a recommendation on the eligibility of
the sites identified during the survey for inclusion on the NRHP and/or designated as a State
Archeological Landmark. Materials generated from this project were curated at the Center for
Archaeological Research at the University of Texas at San Antonio.

25

CHAPTER 5
SURVEY RESULTS

Fieldwork consisted of archaeological and geomorphological investigations. In this chapter, the
results of these two distinct, yet inter-related, aspects of fieldwork are discussed. The
archaeological investigations are presented first, with separate discussions included for each of
the individual parcels and the two archaeological sites. The geomorphological investigationsâ
which were conducted only within the Fordyce Propertyâare then presented, including
discussions of the general geology of the project area, sediment and profile descritions of backhoe
trenches, and archaeological implications of these observations. These two discussions are then
combined, providing a more complete understanding of the results of the field investigations.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Archaeological survey of Fordyce Tract # 1, Fordyce Tract # 2, and the two 20-acre parcels to the
northwest and northeast of Rio Grande City relusted in the identification and recording of two
cultural resources sites (41SR374 and 41SR375), one modern area of ranching activity, and five
isolated occurrences. One cultural resource site (41SR374) is located atop Pliestocene age
fluviatile terrace deposits and the other (41SR375) is located atop a Pliocene or Pliestocene age
surface associated with Uvalde gravels. Isolated occurrences (IO) of cultural materials were
identified in Fordyce Tract # 2 and the northeast 20-acre parcel.

Fordyce Tract # 2
Fordyce Tract # 2âthat survey area south of U.S. Highway 83âwas subjected to both
reconnaissance and intensive pedestrian survey. Reconnaissance survey was conducted in the
northwest part of the parcel, where gravel and fill extraction have impacted the area to such an
extent that 10-m of fill have been removed in some areas. The remaining approximately 33.5
acresâextending from UTM Zone 14, 2916240 to 2916500 N and from 514500 to 515100 Eâ
were intensively surveyed (Figure 9).

CHAPTER 5: SURVEY RESULTS

The majority of this 33.5-acre area was also found destroyed and/or altered by heavy equipment
with original surfaces or terrain nearly entirely lacking. Cultural materials were evident on the
truncated modern ground surface. These materials included a tan chert flake (IO 2), and an
occurrence of a transfer print ceramic (IO 1; possibly historic) and a 1950-1960âs ranching
activity area that included a stock tank, remains of a corral, and various refuse near the river
margin. The associated refuse in the stock tank area of included wooden planks, copper buttons,
plastic buttons, keys, aerosol paint cans, transfer print ceramics, porcelain, white earthenware,
clear bottle glass, cinder block fragments, spark plugs, Coke bottle fragments, a few small pieces
of window-pane glass, plastics, and sanitary cans.
This area was initially thought to be undisturbed; 15 shovel tests were thus excavated in the area.
The shovel tests were generally excavated to a meter below the modern ground surface. All of
these shovel test lacked cultural materials.

Fordyce Tract # 1
Fordyce Tract # 1, located north of Highway 83, was also subject to a variety of survey methods,
dependent on the amount and nature of evident disturbance. Reconnaissance survey was
conducted in the gravel pit areas in the south portion, windshield survey was conducted in the
developed, residential section in the east to northeast portion, and intensive pedestrian survey was
conducted in the remainder of the parcel (roughly 44.5 acres out of 113.32 acres). Intensive
pedestrian survey was conducted in an area extending from UTM Zone 14, 2916200 to 2916460N
and from 514600 to 515140E (Figure 10). A single archaeological site was located within this
area (41SR374).

Site 41SR374
Site 41SR374 is a very large site located on a low ridge on the second terrace above the Rio
Grande floodplain. It is located within an agricultural field that had not been utilized for up to 5
years prior to the recording. The field and site area has been overgrown with nut grass, obscuring
40-80 percent of the siteâs surface. In spite of the thick grass, the site limits could be determined
upon surface inspection. A subsurface extent to the siteâs deposits was identified in shovel tests
within the site and outside the surface manifestation to the north and a backhoe trench to the
south. The dimensions of the site were determined to be 160 m east-west by 182 m north-south,
totaling an area of 21,372 m2. Cultural materials were restricted to a low ridge top above a
shallow drainage basin to the east and sloped terrain to the west (Figure 11).
Surface artifacts included 1,000 to 1,500 pieces of chert, quartzite, and rhyolite debitage. Other
lithic artifacts noted on the surface included cores, core tools (choppers), the single collected
projectile point, several sandstone metate fragments, and some scattered sandstone and chert firecracked rocks. Surface density of materials ranged from as few as one item per 100 m2 to as
many as 5-10 items per m2. Formal analysis was not conducted of surface lithic debitage. A
cursory examination of debitage from the modern ground surface indicated that all stages of lithic
reduction and tool preparation had occurred on the site. A single projectile point was collected
from the surface in the far-eastern part of the site and it was identified as a Tortugas point (Figure
12). This projectile point dates to the latter part of the Middle Archaic Period. Thermal features
were likely present at the site at one time, as fire-cracked rock was also identified on the modern
ground surface.

Seven shovel tests were excavated on the site, and several others were excavated outside the site
boundaries to the north, south, and west. Three of the seven shovel tests within the siteâs
boundaries contained subsurface lithic debitage within upper unconsolidated sediments. An
additional shovel test just north of the site boundary as defined by the surface distribution of
artifacts also contained subsurface lithic debitage. Analyses of the collected chipped stone
artifacts were conducted, and these analyses are presented in Appendix A.
A single backhoe trench (BHT 7), located immediately south-southeast of the surface artifact
distribution also contained subsurface cultural materials; this resulted in expansion of the siteâs
boundaries to encompass the area of the backhoe trench. Cultural materials (i.e lithic debitage,
fire-cracked rocks, and shell) documented in the backhoe trench extended to 67-cm below the
modern ground surface. While this depth might be considered to extend below the plow zone,
geomorphological investigation indicates that these materials are likely from disturbed contexts
(see discussion below).

CHAPTER 5: SURVEY RESULTS

Northwest 20 Acre Parcel â El Sauz Locale
Most of this 20-acre parcel was subject to intensive pedestrian survey. Much of the southwestern
part of the parcel had been extensively disturbed by heavy machinery. Evident through deep
furrows, these disturbances extended more than a meter below the original ground surface. The
extreme northwest corner of this parcel is located within a residential development. A single
archaeological site (41SR375) was identified in the extreme southeast part of the parcel (Figure
13).

Site 41SR375
Site 41SR375 is a large surface scatter of lithic artifacts at the headwaters of an unnamed
drainage that leads eastward into Los Olmos Creek. The site is located on a Pliocene or
Pliestocene-age surface associated with Uvalde gravels, and is primarily a flaked stone quarry and
reduction site. Surface artifacts extend across a 134-m north-south by 160-m east-west area,
encompassing an area of 10,729 m2. The site is restricted to a low ridge above the drainage, and
within the drainage and nearly level surfaces near the western site boundary. Areas to the west of
the site boundary have been disturbed by heavy equipment activity.
Surface artifacts included 750 to 1,000 pieces of chert, quartzite, and rhyolite debitage. Other
lithic artifacts noted on the surface included cores, tested cobbles, and core tools (choppers).
Surface density of materials ranged from as few as one item per 100 m2 to as many as two to five
items per m2. Formal analysis was not conducted of surface lithic debitage, but a cursory
examination of debitage on the surface indicated that all stages of lithic reduction and tool
preparation had occurred on the site. The site appears to primarily represent a lithic quarry site
associated with exposed Uvalde gravel deposits.
Eight shovel tests were excavated within the siteâs boundaries (Shovel Test #s 33-40). All shovel
tests lacked subsurface cultural deposits. Many of the larger lithic artifacts (e.g., cores and core
tools) however, were only partly exposed on the ground surface, indicating some buried cultural
materials could be present in the uppermost stratum.

Northeast 20 Acre Parcel â El Tanque Locale
This entire parcel was subject to intensive pedestrian survey (Figure 14). Only the extreme
southeastern part of the parcel had been disturbed or altered from the construction of Texas Farm
Road 755. Three isolated occurrences were recorded in this parcel. These included a utilized
quartzite flake (brown in color; IO 3), a dual occurrence of a piece of white chert angular debitage
and a white chert flake (IO 4), and a white/tan chert split nodule flake (IO 5). All of the isolates
were located in the south to southwest portion of the parcel. Two shovel tests excavated in the
area of the isolated surface finds revealed a lack of sediments lying above bedrock. Additionally,
bedrock was exposed on the surface in many portions of the south to southwest portion of the
parcel.

GEOMORPHOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Geomorphological investigations were undertaken on the Fordyce property.
These
investigationsâwith the aid of a backhoe operator excavating trenchesâwere intended to
evaluate the potential for intact buried cultural deposits. The general geology of the Fordyce
Property is first presented, followed by discussions of the backhoe trench profiles and sediments,
and the implications of these investigations for the archaeology of the project area. Complete
descriptions of the excavated and exposed sediments are provided in Appendix C.

General Geology
The near-surface geology of the study area consists of Quaternary clays, silts, sands, and gravels
resting unconformably on Tertiary marine deposits. The Quaternary sediments are principally
alluvial in origin, although there may be eolian or colluvial elements in some areas. The study
area is located in the western portion of the coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico where the Late
Cretaceous and Tertiary bedrock units dip gently to the southeast and east. These units have been
eroded and in places deeply incised during the Quaternary as sea level rose and fell in response to
worldwide glacial events. This eroded surface has since been buried beneath fluvial and deltaic
sediments deposited by the Rio Grande (see Brown et al. 1980; Cooper et al. 2003; and Day et al.
1981 for a more complete discussion).
The study area lies entirely within the valley of the present Rio Grande in an area where the
riverâs valley is relatively narrow and bounded in many places on the north side by bedrocksupported uplands. In this vicinity, the river is a strongly meandering stream with an extremely
sinuous, active channel that often shifts location within its meander belt. Several large bancos or
cut-off meander loops in or immediately adjacent to the study area are a clear indication of this
type of activity. However, the portion of the Rio Grande floodplain within the study area has
been heavily modified over the past several decades by activities such as agriculture, road
construction, and quarrying for sand and gravel that have greatly disturbed the sedimentary
deposits and probably removed all traces of other fluvial features. The natural landforms and
deposits in the southern half of the tract north of US Highway 83 and the northern half of the tract
south of US Highway 83 have virtually been removed by sand and gravel quarrying. The
northern portion of the tract north of the highway has been deeply plowed and subjected to other
agricultural activities. Several light-duty gravel roads have recently been constructed on the
southern portion of the tract south of the highway. These events have made it extremely difficult
to accurately determine a detailed depositional history of this area and have probably modified
some of the near-surface sediments.

Sediment and Profile Description
A total of seven backhoe trenches was excavated in the study area. Five were placed in roughly a
northwest-southeast line across Los Aquinsas Banco No. 91 (Backhoe Trenches [BHTs] 1â5;
Figure 15), and the other two (BHTs 6, 7) were placed on the what appears to be an older fluvial
terrace in the old agricultural field north of US Highway 83. All of the trenches encountered
Quaternary-age alluvial sediments. A complete description of the sediments can be found in
Appendix A. The sediments themselves range from fine-grained clays and silts to clean, wellsorted sands and extremely coarse gravels. Typical of fluvial deposits, the finer and coarser
36

materials have been segregated into distinct beds based on the level of energy required to
transport the differing size of clastic grains. Deposits in two of the trenches (BHTs 2 and 3) still
displayed remnants of original primary sedimentary structure, and several (BHTs 4 and 5) (Figure
16) exhibited extremely sharp contacts between very coarse-grained and very fine-grained
deposits indicating rapid changes in depositional energy and potentially periods of erosion.
However, only the lowest zone in BHT 3 displayed a consistent change in grain size with depth
that is fairly common in fluvial sediments. This coarsening upwards sequence could be a portion
of a crevasse splay deposit, but its truncated upper boundary makes it impossible to determine
with certainty. The remaining deposits do not display any noticeable or consistent change with
depth. What is noticeable is that in the area of Banco No. 91, the deposits seem to grow coarser
as the terrain becomes higher to the south. This probably reflects moving from the abandoned,
cut-off meander loop or slough that only receives low energy deposits during flood events to the
point bar inside of this loop that was deposited in high energy environments when the meander
loop was still part of the active Rio Grande channel. The gravels deposited on this point bar
surface now seem to be acting as âarmorâ for this former point bar surface preventing further
erosion.

The exact age of the deposits encountered is impossible to determine with the available data. In
the area south of the highway, the presence of primary sedimentary structures and the youthful
appearance of the soil profiles (AC-C or C-C-C) strongly suggest that they belong to the latest
portion of the Holocene, especially given that this area is completely located within the active
meander belt of the Rio Grande. The intense meandering action of the river, the narrow width of
its floodplain, and the rapidity with which the river sweeps across it would seem to guarantee that
the Rio Grande would effectively annihilate any significantly older deposits within a few hundred
yards of its current bank. Further, the extremely high deposition rates observed in studies just to
the east of this area (Cooper et al. 2003) would suggest that even if older deposits had survived,
they would be buried quite deeply and well below the depths tested in this study.
The age of the sediments encountered in the two trenches north of the highway is more
problematic. Again, the pedogenic development is very poor and the soil profiles appear quite
youthful. In this case, given the location of the deposits on a very high terrace, it seems likely
that the âyouthfulâ appearance may be due to other factors such as removal of organically
enriched soil zones by wind and water erosion and disturbances by deep plowing and other
agricultural activities rather than just the sediments being very recent in origin. They must be
older than the cultural materials that rest on their surface and younger than the adjoining uplands,
but more data would be required to determine their age more precisely.

38

CHAPTER 5: SURVEY RESULTS

Archaeological Implications
The depositional history and modern disturbance of the study area has important consequences
for the preservation of buried, in situ, cultural deposits. In the areas of the sand and gravel
quarries, it is almost certain that any cultural deposits have been badly disturbed, if not destroyed
outright. These quarries have affected well over half of the main study area. South of US
Highway 83, backhoe trenches encountered what appears to be the upper portion of a gravel-rich
point bar deposit. This type of environment, close to water and with plentiful stone resources,
would seem to make an attractive habitation site, but no cultural deposits were observed. Further,
the age of the sediments penetrated appears quite recent. Based on studies done in areas just to
the east (Cooper et al. 2003), the surface sediments may only be a few hundreds of years old and
those that could potentially contain older cultural materials may be buried quite deeply, if they
were not removed by later erosion. North of the quarries on the north side of US Highway 83,
fire-cracked rock, chipped stone, and other cultural lithic materials were found on the surface and
buried within the plow zone of the old agricultural field. It is thought that the sediments there
form the upper portion of older fluvial terrace deposits that perhaps are as old as the terminal
Pleistocene. This view is reinforced by the fact that all of the cultural materials seem to be
located in the very near-surface and are not deeply buried, suggesting that the deposits predate the
arrival of humans in this area. This cannot be stated with absolute certainty, but it is certain that
any cultural deposits will have been disturbed by modern agricultural activities and their integrity
seriously degraded.
To summarize, the potential for locating buried, sealed, in situ cultural deposits in most of the
study area is extremely low. The old field utilized until recently for agriculture located on the
high fluvial terrace north of US Highway 83 does have some potential for a site, and cultural
materials have been located there. However, these deposits have certainly been disturbed and
may only represent a surface rather than a buried site.

39

CHAPTER 6
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

In the following pages, the results of the cultural resources survey are first summarized. National
Register eligibility criteria are then discussed. Those archaeological sites that possess integrity
and material content that may be used to address important research domains are regarded as
potentially eligible properties. Recommendations are then offered concerning the NRHP
eligibility of the sites that were identified and recorded within the Rio Grande City Water and
Water Treatment Plants project area. Given the relatively sparse knowledge of the archaeology
of the lower Rio Grande valley region, there is little in the way of comparable archaeological sites
by which to identify significant cultural resources. The approach we suggest is therefore broadly
based on site integrity and site content that may be used to address regional research issues.
Finally, the archaeological sites recorded during the present survey are discussed specifically in
relation to their potential to contribute information toward a better understanding of research
domains.

SUMMARY
Two prehistoric-period archaeological sites were recorded during the present survey project. The
Prehistoric period archaeological record for the region generally indicates a relatively high level
of mobility by small groups of hunter-gatherers. Sites recorded during the present survey, and
those previously recorded in the project region, indicate that sites are frequently found in high
terrace and upland locations along and in the vicinity of exposures of Pleistocene gravels. These
sites were generally used as lithic quarries and for the primary reduction of lithic raw materials.
Many of these sites were used repeatedly throughout the prehistoric cultural sequence, and thus
these gravel exposures often exhibit a range of artifacts representing up to thousands of years of
use.
One of the two sites identified during the present cultural resources survey was located atop such
a gravel exposure. Site 41SR374 is entirely a surface manifestation. The other site identified
during the present project (41SR375) had numerous artifacts partly buried at the modern ground
surface, lithic artifacts recovered from the top stratum in shovel tests, and a few artifacts found
more deeply buried within a backhoe trench. Geomorphological investigations at and in the
vicinity of this site however, suggest that all of the buried cultural materials are located within
41

INTENSIVE ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY, RIO GRANDE CITY WATER TREATMENT PLANT, RIO GRANDE CITY, STARR CO., TEXAS

previously disturbed strata. This upland location was, until approximately six years ago, plowed
for agriculture, and the results of that damage have likely effected the integrity of the site
deposits.

NATIONAL REGISTER ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
The qualification of a cultural resource as eligible for listing in the NRHP is based on the
applicability of four criteria for evaluation defined by 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part
60. After the identification of relevant research domains, the following criteria are applied:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design,
setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and
(a) That are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns
of our history; or
(b) That are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(c) That embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a
significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
(d) That have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history [36
CFR Â§ 60.4, emphasis added].

With regards specifically to prehistoric resources, as in the present project, the goal of prehistoric
archaeological research and management is to fill gaps in our knowledge about specific research
domains. Scientific importance is partially driven by the research paradigms of the time and in
part by the amount of information available about a particular research topic in a specific
geographic area. The most robust forms of scientific importance should honor diverse and
occasionally competing schools of research interests and their attendant approaches (including
cultural-historical, processual or ecological, and post-processual paradigms). The scientific value
of prehistoric archaeological sites is assessed under Criterion D.
Criterion D: resources that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in
prehistory or history [36 CFR Â§ 60.4]. This criterion addresses scientific importance and applies
primarily to prehistoric sites. In order to fulfill Criterion D, a site must possess certain attributes,
such as intact buried cultural strata with functionally and temporally diagnostic materials, datable
cultural features, and so on, such that further intensive research at the site could be expected to
add additional information to relevant research questions.
The research domains are addressed through testing and excavation programs; over time, data
required for addressing specific questions are collected, analyzed, and compiled. Eventually, the
potential importance, or significance, of sites that contain only the types of data already collected
may diminish. This suggests that the identification criteria of important historic properties are
tied to both a specific geographic area reflecting a cultural adaptation or cultural region and a
state of accumulated knowledge about a research domain topic. The criteria and priorities of
important sites are apt to shift as accepted research paradigms change or as data accumulations
approach redundancy. Archaeological sites that retain integrity and contain artifacts and features
capable of contributing information toward addressing relevant research issues are significant and
should therefore be considered eligible for listing on the NRHP.

42

CHAPTER 6: SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

SITE ELIGIBILITY
The nature of the prehistoric sites inventoried and evaluated affects the research domains that
may be adequately addressed. The critical question to address in the assessment of this site is
whether additional work would significantly augment existing knowledge of prehistory or
whether the important information available from the site was collected during the current site
identification and recording.
Given that site 41SR374 is entirely a surface manifestation, and its surface content is moderately
disturbed, with little contextual integrity, it has little or no potential to contribute to any relevant
research domains for the geographic region or temporal span represented. For this site, it is
determined that the important information available from it was collected through identification
and documentation. Its location was identified, and the site contentâor what remains of the site
content on the modern ground surfaceâwas documented. Site 41SR374 is thus recommended as
not eligible for listing on the NRHP.
Site 41SR375 is primarily a surface manifestation, with minimal extension into subsurface
deposits. As indicated in Backhoe Trench #7 and in shovel tests excavated across the site, there
are subsurface cultural deposits on the site. However, geomorphological investigations indicate
that the subsurface deposits are minimal and located entirely within an upper stratum that had
previously been disturbed through agriculturally-related activities. Again, the important
information to be gleaned from this site has been collected through identification and
documentation. It is therefore recommended that site 41SR375 is not eligible for listing on the
NRHP.
