ABSTRACT
Over a total of 16 days between March 10 and May 28, 2010, Moore Archeological Consulting,
Inc., conducted a cultural resource survey investigation for an approximately 5.5 mile (ca. 8.8
km) long section of the Spring Creek hiking trail, in north Harris County, Texas. The objectives
of the investigation were to locate and identify cultural materials, sites, or historic properties
within the proposed trail’s potential impact area1, and to prepare management recommendations
regarding any identified resources. The investigations were conducted for Jacobs Engineering
Group, Inc., in response to a request by the Harris County Public Infrastructure Department and
Harris County Precinct 4, under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5518.
An intensive pedestrian field survey of the project area was conducted, and included both surface
and subsurface (shovel test and backhoe trench) examination. A total of 293 shovel tests and two
backhoe trenches were excavated. Shovel testing identified ten potential archeological sites, of
which three were designated as isolated finds (IF 1-3), and seven were designated as sites
41HR1077, 41HR1078, 41HR1079, 41HR1080, 41HR1081, 41HR1082, and 41HR1083. The
seven sites were comprised of five prehistoric occupation sites (41HR1077, 41HR1078,
41HR1079, 41HR1082, 41HR1083), and two multi-component sites (41HR1080, 41HR1081)
with both prehistoric and historic materials. All of the prehistoric sites were determined to be
small and ephemeral in nature, with low artifact density and diversity. The historic component at
41HR1080 was extremely limited, while that of 41HR1081 appears to be relatively modern, and
heavily disturbed by road construction and use. Further, both of these locations appear to
represent historic trash dump areas, rather than occupation sites. Consequently, the seven sites do
not appear to possess the potential for future study, and are thus not eligible for inclusion on the
National Register of Historic Places. No further archeological work is recommended for sites
41HR1077-41HR1083. Once the current report is finalized, the prehistoric artifacts and select
historic artifacts (excluding redundant and nondiagnostic historic materials approved by THC)
recovered from the sites will be curated at TARL.
In the event that archeological deposits or features should be encountered in other areas during
construction, work should cease in the immediate vicinity and the Archeology Division of the
Texas Historical Commission contacted for further consultation.

INTRODUCTION
of 50 ft to either side of the trail APE, as
well as any high probability landforms
visible from the trail, and the entire
circumference
of
Bender
Lake.
Consequently, the area included in the
pedestrian survey totaled 270 acres. In
addition, expected deep impacts related to
the construction of a light bridge at the
Cypress Creek crossing required the use of
backhoe trenching to prospect for any
deeply buried sites in that location.

Over a total of 16 days between
March 10 and May 28, 2010, Moore
Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted a
cultural resource survey investigation for an
approximately 5.5 mile (ca. 8.8 km) long
section of the Spring Creek hiking trail, in
north Harris County, Texas. The objectives
of the investigation were to locate and
identify cultural materials, sites, or historic
properties within the proposed trail’s
potential impact area (as defined through
negotiation with the Archaeology Division
of the THC to include both the trail footprint
and any high probability landforms visible
from the trail), and to prepare management
recommendations regarding any identified
resources.
The investigations were
conducted for Jacobs Engineering Group,
Inc., in response to a request by the Harris
County Public Infrastructure Department
and Harris County Precinct 4, under Texas
Antiquities Permit Number 5518.

Intensive pedestrian field surveys of
the project areas were conducted, and
included both surface and subsurface
(shovel test, backhoe trench) examination
(Figure 2; see Appendix 1 for details).
Backhoe trenches were conducted only at
the Cypress Creek crossing location due to
the expected deep impacts in that area; the
remainder of the trail construction will be
limited to shallow impacts and the vast
majority will occur in Atasco soils which
exhibit a low potential for containing deeply
buried prehistoric sites (Abbott 2001). A
total of 293 shovel tests and two backhoe
trenches were excavated.
The field
investigations were conducted by project
archeologist Randy Ferguson and field
technician Sarah Blake, Chris Brown, and
Rachel Goings. David Driver served as the
project’s principal investigator.

The project area is depicted on the
Maedan, Texas 7.5' USGS topographic
quadrangle map (Figure 1). The proposed
APE construction impacts along the
majority of the trail system (many sections
of the proposed trail follow extant informal
ATV trails) are to be limited and superficial
in nature. However, because hikers often
leave pedestrian trails to visit interesting offtrail areas (e.g., look-out points, lakes, etc.)
the survey corridor extended to a minimum

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
from the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in mild
winters and relatively cool summer nights
(Wheeler
1976:2,
66).
Summer
temperatures average 92°F (33°C), while
winter temperatures average 64°F (18°C).
Annual precipitation averages 46 inches
(117 cm).

Soils and Geology
Harris County is located within the
West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic
province (Hunt 1974). In the Texas region,
the surface topography of the plain is
characterized by relatively flat topography
that dips slightly towards the Gulf of
Mexico. Geologically, the project area lies
atop the Beaumont Formation, a surface
outcrop that extends from just east of the
Mississippi River in Louisiana, to
Kingsville, Texas (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1982).
The formation was
deposited during a series of glacial and
interglacial events during the Middle to Late
Pleistocene. Extensive riverine downcutting
and erosion of the formation occurred during
the periods of lower sea levels associated
with the Wisconsin glaciation. During the
Holocene, after sea levels rose once more,
the resulting river valleys filled with alluvial
soils, creating broad, level floodplains.

Hydrology
The project areas are located along
the south side of Spring Creek, which forms
the boundary between Harris and
Montgomery Counties, and which is a major
tributary of the San Jacinto River.
Flora and Fauna
Harris County lies within the
Austroriparian biotic province (Blair
1950:98-101). Not determined by a marked
physiographic break, the western boundary
of this province is loosely identified by the
distribution of pine and hardwood forests on
the eastern Gulf coastal plain. The county is
situated within the pine-oak subdivision of
the Austroriparian province (Tharp 1939).
Blair (1950) lists the dominant floral species
of the pine-oak forest subdivision as loblolly
pine (Pinus taeda), yellow pine (Pinus
echinata), red oak (Quercus rubra), post oak
(Quercus stellata), and blackjack oak
(Quercus marilandica). Hardwood forests
are found on lowlands within the
Austroriparian and are characterized by such
trees
as
sweetgum
(Liquidambar
styraciflua),
magnolia
(Magnolia
grandiflora), tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica), water
oak (Quercus nigra), and other species of
oaks, elms, and ashes, as well as the highly
diagnostic Spanish moss (Tillandisia
usneiodes) and palmetto (Sabal glabra).

The project area is depicted on
sheets 13 and 23 of the Soil Survey of Harris
County (Wheeler 1976). The soil types
present along the trail route include Atasco
fine sandy loam, 1 to 4 percent slopes (AtB),
Hatliff loam (Hf), and Voss soils (Vs).
Atasco fine sandy loam soils are described
as moderately well drained with medium
surface runoff (Wheeler 1976:11), Hatliff
loam soils are described as moderately well
drained with slow runoff (Wheeler 1976:16),
and Voss soils are described as frequently
flooded and moderately well drained to
somewhat poorly drained and with slow
surface runoff.
Abbott (2001) defines
Atasco soils as upland loamy ancient (preHolocene) alluvium with low potential for
containing deeply buried archeological sites.
Hatliff and Voss soils are defined as
floodplain recent alluvium with a high
potential for containing deeply buried
archeological sites.

Blair (1950) and Gadus and Howard
(1990) identify the following mammals as
common within the Austroriparian province:
white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus),
muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), raccoon
(Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis latrans),
opossum (Didelphis virginiana), Scalopus
aquaticus, Pipistrellus subflavus, Lasiurus

snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentinia), mud
turtle (Kinosteron spp.), river cooter
(Chrysemys concinna) and diamondback

common water turtles. Common lizards
include Anolis carolinensis, Sceloporus

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
11,000-10,000 B.C., and lasts for
approximately 4000 years. During this time,
it is proposed that populations continued
with a highly nomadic hunting tradition
brought with them from the Old World.
Traditional models emphasize the heavy
reliance that these groups placed on the
hunting of the large mammals of the
Pleistocene. Plant foods and small game
undoubtedly supplanted this diet, and may
have played a more important role than
previously thought (Black and McGraw
1985; Patterson 1995).
Artifact types
associated with this phase include various
fluted and non-fluted lanceolate projectile
points, such as Clovis and Folsom. In
general, due to a paucity of well-stratified
older sites, the Paleoindian stage remains
poorly defined in southeast Texas.

Southeast Texas Culture History
The project area is located within
the southeast Texas archaeological region
(Patterson 1995; Story et al. 1990). The
culture history of the region extends back at
least 12,000 years into the past. A number
of researchers have compiled chronological
frameworks to describe the cultural histories
of the area (Aten 1983; Ensor 1991;
Patterson 1995; Shafer et al. 1975; Story et
al. 1990). The majority of these divide
human occupation into four broad stages,
Paleoindian, Archaic/Lithic, Ceramic/Late
Prehistoric, and Historic. The stages are
based on a proposed sequence of economic
strategies as they are revealed through the
archaeological and/or historical record.
These proposed shifts in dominant lifeways
consider
cultural,
economic,
and
technological factors in order to provide a
heuristic model useful for attempting to
understand ancient and early historic
populations. While the dates assigned to the
period interfaces are based on "absolute"
dating methods, they of course represent a
generalized time range for the implied
cultural evolution. The dates provided in the
following discussion will be drawn from
Ensor (1991) and are presented in Table 1.

By 8000 B.C., the Late Wisconsin
glaciation had ended, increasing climatic
aridity and creating extensive changes in the
environment. As a result, the majority of
Pleistocene megafauna became extinct. This
required drastic changes in the dominant
subsistence strategies of the affected
populations. By 8000 B.C., the start of the
Early Archaic stage, the remaining southeast
Texas populations had adapted to the
environmental changes by shifting to a
lifeway dominated by seasonal scheduling.
This type of subsistence economy
specializes in a regionally circumscribed and
repetitive exploitation of specific floral and

territory, the nomadic populations were able

to better exploit the various resources
available within their local environment.

A.D. 600 (Aten 1983).

However, research has suggested
that human population densities remained
low in the area, and may have even
decreased significantly during this time
(Moore and Moore 1991). Eventually, the
stabilization of the climate by around 1000
B.C., the start of the Late Archaic, appears
to have led to increasing populations. This
rise in regional population may have been
further facilitated by the development of
long-distance
trade,
technological
innovations, and changing social relations
(Patterson 1995).

Historic Overview
European contact in the region
began in the early 16th century with the illfated Narváez expedition that, in 1528,
deposited Cabeza de Vaca onto the Texas
coastline, possibly on Galveston Island.
More long-term contacts resulting from
permanent European settlement did not
directly impact aboriginal lifeways in
southeast Texas until the early 18th century
(Patterson 1995).
However, European
diseases introduced by explorers and early
traders had begun to affect Native American
populations in Texas by the 16th century
(Ewers 1974). Throughout the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries, epidemic diseases,
the mission system, and the fur trade
seriously reduced, and in some cases
exterminated, the indigenous populations
residing in the region.

The final prehistoric period in
southeast Texas is marked by the emergence
of ceramics. Ceramic artifacts appear in the
archaeological record of the Galveston Bay
area by approximately A.D. 100, and by
A.D 500, had been adopted by a number of
inland populations (Pertulla et al. 1995). A
plain, sand-tempered type of ceramic
identified as Goose Creek became prevalent
during the period, although a number of
decorated varieties and tempering materials
were also present (Patterson 1995; Pertulla
et al. 1995). The appearance of Caddoan
pottery in southeast Texas around A.D.
1000-1300 has been used to suggest the
presence of extended trade networks or
migration during this time (Aten 1983). The
period has also been associated with the

Anglo-American settlement in the
Harris County area began in the early 1820s,
with a number of Mexican land grants
awarded in 1824 (Henson 1996). The
modern boundaries of the county were
established as Harrisburg County by the
Texas Congress in 1836, and it was renamed
Harris County in 1839. The presence of the
highly navigable Buffalo Bayou stimulated

the city of Houston in particular. The
establishment of six railroad lines in the area
prior to the Civil War further stimulated
economic prosperity, and helped lure a

included the current project property
(Greiner Engineering Sciences, Inc. 1980).
Of the 12 sites (all prehistoric) identified in
this survey, five were located along Panther
Branch (41MQ70-41MQ74). The closest of
these is 41MQ74, which lies 0.65 km north
of the current project area.
This site
consisted of seven flakes and was described
as highly eroded.
While it was not
recommended for further work, two of the
Panther Branch sites (41MQ70, 41MQ73) to
its north were tested (Greiner Engineering
Sciences, Inc. 1981). One of the sites,
41MQ73, was determined to be considered
eligible for nomination to the National
Register of Historic Places (Greiner
Engineering Sciences, Inc. 1981:17).

Prior
to
beginning
field
investigations,
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc., performed a background
investigation of archeological and historical
literature relevant to the project area.
Literature examined for this project includes
site inventory records on file at TARL,
previous archeological investigative reports
on file at the Texas Historical Commission
(THC)
and
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc. and other published
literature pertinent to the current project.
The archival background search
identified the presence of one previously
located site within the current project area.
The site, 41HR414, represents a prehistoric
occupation along the bluff of the creek’s
southern bank (TARL records). The site is
located just east of the halfway point of the
proposed Jones Park trail. The site was
recorded by the Houston Archeological
Society in 1982, and the observed artifacts
included debitage and ceramic sherds. The
artifacts were associated with a 10 cm thick
dark stratum that was located at a depth of
30-40 cm below the ground surface. The
site was already being impacted by hiking
and livestock trails at the time of its
discovery.

In 1980, an initial survey of the
Jesse H. Jones Park tract along Spring Creek
was conducted (Heartfield, Price, and
Greene, Inc. 1980). Later, personnel from
Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc.
conducted additional survey for the Jesse H.
Jones Park expansion. Ten new sites were
recorded, eight prehistoric and two historic.
Only three of the prehistoric sites yielded
culturally diagnostic materials (Moore 1988;
Moore 1990). In addition, personnel from
Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc.
conducted a survey of the 334 acre
Burroughs Park Tract for Harris County,
Precinct #4. The project area was bordered
by Spring Creek and was subjected to
intensive shovel testing as well as historic
land-use and geomorphological studies.
Three prehistoric and one historic site were
identified during the course of survey
(Moore 1990).
One site, 41HR625,
produced a large number of artifacts. It was
considered
as
eligible
for

Archeological Landmark (SAL) status. The

An

archeologist, William McClure, recorded
sites 41MQ44 and 441MQ48 on Neidigk
Lake along Spring Creek. The sites were
revisited by personnel from the Texas
Archeological Survey in 1986 (Moore
1990). In 1979 a survey of the 23,000 acre

only a small portion of the site is located
inside the park boundaries, its eligibility for
inclusion in the National Register could not
be determined. The limited number and
types of artifacts recovered from the portion
of the site located within the park suggested
the site represents a short-term occupation
site with a limited degree of activities. The
Texas Historical Commission review found
that “the portion within the park would not
contribute to (the site’s) eligibility if it were
later determined eligible.” Consequently, no
further work at site 41HR1018 was
recommended within the park boundaries.

other two prehistoric sites produced
evidence of more ephemeral occupations,
however they were also considered as
eligible for SAL status due to their excellent
state of preservation (Moore 1990).
In 2006, Moore Archeological
Consulting, Inc., conducted a cultural
resource survey investigation of an
approximately 30 acre portion of the
existing Harris County, Precinct 4, Pundt
Park, and two components totaling 3.0 km
of the Spring Creek Trail System, in north
Harris County, Texas (Driver 2007). A new
site, 41HR1018, was identified, but because

FIELD METHODS AND RESULTS
screened through ¼” mesh (Figures 4-7;
Appendix 1; individual ST locations shown
in THC report copy only). Each of the
project’s shovel tests were recorded and
plotted on the project map. The tests along
the proposed trail alignment were placed at
approximately 100 m intervals. A single
line of shovel tests, placed at 50 m intervals,
was excavated around the shoreline of
Bender Lake. In addition, a number of tests
were placed at opportune points in areas
which might look inviting to hikers. A total
of seven sites and three isolated finds were
identified by the shovel tests.

The fieldwork was conducted over a
total of 16 days between March 10 and May
28, 2010, and consisted of a pedestrian
survey that included systematic shovel
testing, backhoe trenching, and visual
examination for surface exposure of cultural
materials. The survey was focused on the
trail APE as well as a 50 ft corridor to either
side of the trail, and also included any
locations that appeared to represent high
probability areas for prehistoric/historic
occupation. The total area included in the
pedestrian survey comprised 270 acres.
The project area is depicted on the
Maedan, Texas 7.5' USGS topographic
quadrangle map (Figures 1). The majority
of the project area included naturally
wooded areas, with light to heavy
undergrowth that provided a wide range of
ground surface visibility (Figures 2, 3). The
vegetation included Oak, Pine, Sweetgum,
Magnolia, Bald Cypress, American Holly,
American Beautyberry, and Yaupon.

Two backhoe trenches (BHTs 1, 2)
were placed at the proposed pedestrian
bridge crossing of Cypress Creek (Figure 1)
8-13). Each trench measured approximately
5 m in length and 1 m in width. BHT 1 was
placed on the north bank and reached a
maximum depth of 2.95 m (Figures 8, 10,
11). On the south bank, BHT 2 was
excavated to a depth of 2.70 m (Figures 9,
12, 13). Neither trench produced cultural
materials or features.

A total of 293 shovel tests (ST)
were excavated, each in 10 cm levels and

A total of 18 artifacts were
recovered, and consisted only of lithic
debitage (17 chert, 1 silicified wood). The
artifacts were recovered from Levels 1, 4,
and 6-11 (0-10, 30-40, 50-110 cmbs; Table
2). While not all of the shovel tests were
able to reach the depths of the deepest
recovered artifacts, 13 of 14 tests reached 1
m in depth and approximately half of the
tests reached 110 cm or deeper. The
majority (78%) of the recovered cultural
materials were produced by two of the tests
located adjacent to the dirt road, STs 2 and
148. In terms of their vertical distribution,
almost all of the artifacts were recovered
from Levels 6-11 (50-110 cmbs), with
Levels 8-9 (70-90 cmbs) containing the
highest densities (56%).
None of the
recovered materials were chronologically
diagnostic.

During the pedestrian survey, shovel
testing identified ten potential archeological
sites. Additional shovel tests placed to
delineate and assess these locations
determined that three were isolated finds (IF
1-3), and seven were cultural resource sites
(41HR1077-41HR1083). The sites included
five prehistoric occupation sites (41HR1077,
41HR1078,
41HR1079,
41HR1082,
41HR1083), and two multi-component sites
(41HR1080,
41HR1081)
with
both
prehistoric and historic materials.
Site 41HR1077
This prehistoric occupation site is
located on the south bank of Bender Lake
(Figure 14), directly adjacent to the dirt road
that will be part of the proposed trail. The
site measures approximately 40 m northsouth by 30 m east-west, covering a total
area of approximately 0.3 acres (ca. 0.12
ha).

Prehistoric site 41HR1077 is small
in size and exhibits low artifact density and
diversity. Consequently, the site does not
appear to possess the potential for future
study, and is thus not eligible for inclusion
on the National Register of Historic Places.
No further archeological work is
recommended. Once the current report is
finalized, the artifacts recovered from
41HR1077 will be curated at TARL.

The site was first identified by the
recovery of nine pieces of lithic debitage
from ST 2. An additional 12 shovel tests
(STs 143-153, 155) were conducted in order
to delineate and evaluate the site. Four of
these additional tests (STs 146, 148, 150,
151) were positive for cultural materials.

artifacts produced at this site were recovered
from Levels 3 and 5 (20-30, 40-50 cmbs).
Neither of the recovered artifacts was
chronologically diagnostic.

Site 41HR1078
This prehistoric occupation site is
located in the uplands on a high sandy hill
roughly 400m from Spring Creek (Figure
15), directly adjacent to the dirt road that
will be part of the proposed trail. The site
measures approximately 10 m north-south
by 20 m east-west, covering a total area of
approximately 0.05 acres (ca. 0.02 ha).

Prehistoric site 41HR1078 is small
in size and exhibits low artifact density and
diversity. Consequently, the site does not
appear to possess the potential for future
study, and is thus not eligible for inclusion
on the National Register of Historic Places.
No further archeological work is
recommended. Once the current report is
finalized, the artifacts recovered from
41HR1078 will be curated at TARL.

The site was first identified by the
recovery of a single chert flake fragment
from ST 23 (Table 3). An additional nine
shovel tests (STs 186-194) were conducted
in order to delineate and evaluate the site.
One of these additional tests (ST 194) was
positive for cultural materials, and contained

Site 41HR1079
This prehistoric occupation site is
located on a sandy mound remnant on the
left bank of a side drainage of Spring Creek,
and is immediately north of the proposed
trail (Figure 16).
The site measures
approximately 30 m north-south by 20 m
east-west, covering a total area of
approximately 0.15 acres (ca. 0.06 ha).

A total of nine artifacts were
recovered from Levels 2-4 (10-40 cmbs;
Table 4). In terms of their vertical locations,
the recovered cultural materials were evenly
distributed, with three artifacts from each of
the positive levels. The recovered artifacts
included the distal tip of an unidentifiable
arrow point of silicified wood, and eight
pieces of lithic debitage (6 chert, 2 silicified
wood). The presence of the arrow point
fragment indicates the site dates to at least
the Early Ceramic period.

The site was first identified by the
recovery of four pieces of debitage from ST
82. An additional 12 shovel tests (STs 206215, 217, 220) were conducted in order to
delineate and evaluate the site. Three of
these additional tests (STs 208, 215, 220)
were positive for cultural materials. The
majority of the positive tests were located in
the center/west portion of the sandy mound.
The only positive off-mound shovel test, ST
208, produced a single piece of debitage
(Level 2). The shovel testing revealed that
the potential cultural-bearing deposits in this
area are extremely shallow, with what
appeared to be the underlying, pre-Holocene
subsoil clays located at depths of 36-50
cmbs for tests on the mound, and 18-33
cmbs in off-mound areas. The shovel tests

Prehistoric site 41HR1079 is small
in size, shallow in depth, and exhibits low
artifact density and diversity. Consequently,
the site does not appear to possess the
potential for future study, and is thus not
eligible for inclusion on the National
Register of Historic Places. No further
archeological work is recommended. Once
the current report is finalized, the artifacts
recovered from 41HR1079 will be curated at
TARL.

(1919, 1949, 1961) found no depiction of
historic structures in the area around Bender
Lake. However, a road was depicted on
both the 1919 and 1949 maps that
terminated near the area of both 41HR1080
and 41HR1081. Consequently, the historic
materials from these two sites most likely
represent artifacts in a secondary context
(e.g., trash dump) location.

Site 41HR1080
This multi-component site is located
on the south bank of Bender Lake, between
the shore and the dirt road that will be part
of the proposed trail (Figure 17). The site
measures approximately 20 m in diameter,
covering a total area of approximately 0.08
acres (ca. 0.03 ha).
The site was first identified by the
recovery of a single chert flake fragment
from ST 108. An additional eight shovel
tests (STs 156-163) were conducted in order
to delineate and evaluate the site. Two of
these additional tests (STs 156, 157) were
positive for cultural materials.

Site 41HR1080 is small in size and
exhibits low prehistoric artifact density and
diversity. The single recovered historic
artifact does not appear to represent a
historic component for this site, but is most
likely displaced from the nearby historic
trash dump (see 41HR1081, which is located
10 m to the east of 41HR1080).
Consequently, the site does not appear to
possess the potential for future study, and is
thus not eligible for inclusion on the
National Register of Historic Places. No
further archeological work is recommended.
Once the current report is finalized, the
artifacts recovered from 41HR1080 will be
curated at TARL.

A total of four artifacts were
recovered, three prehistoric and one historic
(Table 5). The single historic artifact was a
shard of amber bottle glass from ST 156,
Level 3 (20-30 cmbs). The prehistoric
artifacts were limited to three pieces of chert
debitage: one from Level 3 (20-30 cmbs),
one from Level 8 (70-80 cmbs), and one
from Level 10 (90-100 cmbs). None of the
recovered materials were chronologically

Site 41HR1081
This multi-component site is located
on the south bank of Bender Lake, and is
bisected by a dirt road that will be part of the
proposed trail (Figure 18). Based on the
distribution of both surface and subsurface
materials, the historic component of the site
measures approximately 40 m northeastsouthwest by 30 m northwest-southeast,
covering a total area of approximately 0.30
acres (ca. 0.12 ha). A significant number of
historic artifacts (low-fired brick fragments
and dark green bottle glass shards) were
visible in the dirt road in the southern end of
the site. The prehistoric deposits of the site
appear to be much smaller in size,
measuring roughly 15 m in diameter, and are
restricted to the northeast corner of the site.

The historic artifacts were recovered
from STs 106, 164, and 165, and were
present in Levels 1, 3, and 7 (0-10, 20-30,
60-70 cmbs). In ST 165, the only shovel
test that produced both prehistoric and
historic materials, their stratigraphic
relationship (historic above prehistoric)
suggests that the deposits are relatively
undisturbed in this portion of the site. In
contrast, the spread of historic materials
(including any structural remains, i.e.,
bricks) across the ground surface in the
southwestern end of the site indicates that
significant elements of the historic deposits
were heavily disturbed by the construction
and use of the dirt road. Recovered historic
artifacts included two square nails, one piece
of barbed wire, one whiteware sherd, and
two shards of amber bottle glass. Though
limited in terms of chronologically
diagnostic materials, the majority of this
material was well-preserved and appeared to
be of relatively recent origin. While a
significant amount of time was spent
looking for surface expressions of historic
features (e.g., partially buried foundation
piers, in-filled cisterns or wells, etc.), no
such architectural features were identified.

The site was first identified by the
recovery of a square nail from ST 106. An
additional 10 shovel tests (STs 159, 162,
164-171) were conducted in order to
delineate and evaluate the site. Four of
these additional tests (STs 164-166, 171)
were positive for cultural materials.
A total of 14 artifacts were
recovered, consisting of eight prehistoric
artifacts and six historic artifacts (Table 6).
The prehistoric artifacts were recovered in
the northeast portion of the site, from STs
165, 166, 171. Prehistoric materials were
present in Levels 2, 5-7, and 9-10 (10-20,
40-70, 80-100 cmbs), and included the distal
fragment of a chert arrow point, five pieces
of lithic debitage (3 chert, 2 silicified wood),
and two sherds of Goose Creek plain pottery
(Figure 19). The presence of the arrow
point and ceramic material indicates the site
dates to at least the Early Ceramic period.

A review of curated USGS maps
(1919, 1949, 1961) found no depiction of
historic structures in the area around Bender

The historic component covers a larger area,
but is more diffuse, and contains relatively

This prehistoric occupation site is
located on a sandy ridge that parallels a
remnant channel of Spring Creek (Figure
20). The topography drops precipitously off
to the northeast into the old channel. The

tests were able to reach the depths of the
deepest recovered artifacts, 10 of 12 tests
reached 115 cm in depth and eight of the

artifacts were lithic debitage (7 chert, 3
silicified wood). None of the recovered
materials were chronologically diagnostic.

located approximately 40 m east of the
proposed trail alignment.

produced by ST 287, which contained four
artifacts. While four of the shovel tests were
terminated at less than 50 cm depths due to
the presence of an underlying shallow clay
stratum immediately west and east of the
site deposits, the remainder of the tests were
able to reach depths below the deepest
recovered artifacts. The recovered artifacts
were limited to lithic debitage (2 chert, 4
silicified wood). None of the recovered
materials were chronologically diagnostic.

The site was first identified by the
recovery of a single piece of lithic debitage
from ST 178. An additional 10 shovel tests
(STs 284-293) were conducted in order to
delineate and evaluate the site. Two of these
additional tests (STs 284, 287) were positive
for cultural materials.

Prehistoric site 41HR1083 is small

RECOMMENDATIONS
Shovel testing identified ten potential
archeological sites, of which three were
designated as isolated finds (IF 1-3), and
seven were designated as sites 41HR1077,
41HR1078,
41HR1079,
41HR1080,
41HR1081, 41HR1082, and 41HR1083.

Over a total of 16 days between
March 10 and May 28, 2010, Moore
Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted a
cultural resource survey investigation for an
approximately 5.5 mile (ca. 8.8 km) long
section of the Spring Creek hiking trail, in
north Harris County, Texas. The objectives
of the investigation were to locate and
identify cultural materials, sites, or historic
properties within the proposed impact area,
and
to
prepare
management
recommendations regarding any identified
resources. The investigations (MAC PN 0863) were conducted for Jacobs Engineering
Group, Inc., in response to a request by the
Harris
County
Public
Infrastructure
Department, under Texas Antiquities Permit
Number 5518.

The seven sites were comprised of
five prehistoric occupation sites (41HR1077,
41HR1078,
41HR1079,
41HR1082,
41HR1083), and two multi-component sites
(41HR1080,
41HR1081)
with
both
prehistoric and historic materials. All of the
prehistoric sites were determined to be small
and ephemeral in nature, with low artifact
density and diversity.
The historic
component at 41HR1080 was extremely
limited, while that of 41HR1081 appears to
be relatively modern, and heavily disturbed
by road construction and use. Further, both
of these locations appear to represent
historic trash dump areas, rather than
occupation sites. Consequently, the seven
sites do not appear to possess the potential
for future study, and are thus not eligible for
inclusion on the National Register of
Historic Places. No further archeological
work is recommended for sites 41HR107741HR1083. Once the current report is
finalized, the prehistoric artifacts and select
historic artifacts (excluding redundant and
nondiagnostic historic materials approved by
THC) recovered from the sites will be
curated at TARL.

The proposed APE construction
impacts along the majority of the trail
system (many sections of the proposed trail
follow extant informal ATV trails) are to be
limited and superficial in nature. However,
because hikers often leave pedestrian trails
to visit interesting off-trail areas (e.g., lookout points, lakes, etc.) the survey corridor
extended to a minimum of 50 ft to either
side of the trail APE, as well as the entire
circumference of Bender Lake. In addition,
expected deep impacts related to the
construction of a light bridge at the Cypress
Creek crossing required the use of backhoe
trenching to prospect for any deeply buried
sites in that location.

In the event that archeological
deposits or features should be encountered
in other areas during construction, work
should cease in the immediate vicinity and
the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission contacted for further
consultation.

An intensive pedestrian field survey
of the project area was conducted, and
included both surface and subsurface
(shovel
test
and
backhoe
trench)
examination. A total of 293 shovel tests and
two backhoe trenches were excavated.
