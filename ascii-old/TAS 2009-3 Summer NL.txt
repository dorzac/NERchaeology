Summer 2009

You are invited to Del Rio for the 80th Annual
Texas Archeological Society Meeting
The Texas Archeological Society’s 80th Annual Meeting
will be held on October 23-25, 2009 for the first time in Del
Rio, Texas. All TAS members are invited to attend the meetings, and, for the third year, non-TAS members can attend
the sessions and/or the banquet at a slightly higher fee than
members. This is an opportunity for the Society to encourage
new membership in a region that has spectacular archeological sites but few TAS members! SHUMLA is your host, and
we are planning a number of tours to sites such as Panther
Cave, Satan Canyon, Fate Bell Shelter, and White Shaman
Shelter, not to mention self-guided tours of historic Del Rio
and opportunities to visit many local attractions such as the
Whitehead Museum, Val Verde winery, Amistad Dam and
Lake, Fate Bell Shelter in Seminole Canyon State Historical
Park, and the Judge Roy Bean Visitors Center in Langtry. A
schedule of regular hours/tours for these destinations will be
included in your registration materials.
The conference hotel is the Ramada Inn located conveniently along US Highway 90 (Veterans Boulevard) in Del
Rio, Texas. Contact the hotel early to reserve a room at a flat
rate of $85.00 per night plus tax for single king bedded rooms
for 1 or 2 guests or a room with 2 queen sized beds for 2 to
4 guests. A small block of student rooms has been reserved
at the Days Inn of Del Rio for $65 per night plus tax for a
single room suite. A valid student ID is required to obtain this
special rate. The Ramada Inn will have a fast full breakfast
buffet available Saturday morning until 11:00 a.m.

Thursday Afternoon—SPECIAL TOURS
The weekend will informally begin on Thursday afternoon with two special two-hour tours to Panther Cave at
1:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m. TAS members will board a National
Park Service vessel provided by SHUMLA partner Amistad
National Recreation Area. At the same time, a really special

Cedar Springs has its place in the world of rock art imagery.

for the Satan Canyon tour. To ensure a spot, early registration
is highly encouraged. For those planning on signing up for
the Satan Canyon tour, participants must be in top physical

Dr. Boyd Biography
Dr. Carolyn Boyd is the Executive Director and cofounder of SHUMLA, an archeological research and educational nonprofit corporation formed to connect people of all
ages with the land and their cultural heritage. She serves as
Adjunct Professor at Texas State University and as a Research
Fellow at the Center for Arts and Symbolism of the Ancient
Americas in San Marcos, Texas and the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory in Austin.
Dr. Boyd received her doctorate in archeology from Texas
A&M University based on her analysis of the 4,000 yearold rock art of the Lower Pecos River Region of southwest
Texas and northern Mexico. Her background as an artist has
provided her with a unique perspective to recognize these
paintings as planned compositions, not random accumulations
of images over time. Her expanded dissertation, Rock Art of
the Lower Pecos, was published in 2003 and is considered
an important contribution on rock art interpretation. Dr. Jo
McDonald, Australian rock-art expert, has said:
“Dr Carolyn Boyd’s exciting work, interpreting
and disentangling the mythologies, is providing a

SHUMLA Executive Director

recent advances in rock art
research of the Lower Pecos at
the Friday night Public Forum.

Prewitt)

coherent explanation for the complexity of this art.
The fact that there is a good archaeological record
and that rock art dating allows for a contextualization
of this art body means that this regional style has
extremely high scientific value. The Lower Pecos rock
art region is on a par with several other of the greatest
rock art provinces of the world (in Australia, Africa
and in Paleolithic France). And the complexity and
compositional intricacies seen in many of the individual
panels is unrivalled—even on this world stage.”

Dr. Boyd teaches Field Methods in Rock Art, a three-week
field school offered each May through Texas State University,
gives numerous lectures around the country, serves on several
graduate committees, and continues her rock art research in
the Lower Pecos.

Nominations Needed for TAS Annual Awards
No Nominations Means No Awards!!!!!

On an annual basis, the Texas Archeological Society singles
out individuals and groups who are TAS members or are involved
in TAS activities and recognizes the contributions that these individuals have made to TAS and to Texas Archeology. The awards
are made on the basis of nominations that are received during
the summer so that the Committee and the Board can make their
recommendations at the September Board Meeting.
The TAS regularly presents five awards to members in
recognition of their outstanding service to the Society and
to Texas archeology. This past year the Board established a
Lifetime Achievement Award with the understanding that this
was not to be an annual award. The annual awards are:
Fellow: Awarded to a TAS member for major contributions to the TAS and to Texas archeology. This is our most
prestigious award and no more than one Fellow award is
given per year. In 2008, Joan Few of Houston received this
award.
Distinguished Service: Awarded to an individual or group,
usually but not necessarily TAS members, for a specific major

nominations were submitted and no award was given.
Golden Pen: Awarded to an avocational TAS member for a
significant published contribution or contributions to Texas archeology. Mark Walters of Tyler received this award in 2008.

Silent Auction Items Needed Please!
Every year at the TAS Annual Meeting we have a big
“Silent Auction” event to raise funds to help support TAS
programs. It’s time to start thinking about items you wish to
submit. Everyone is encouraged to use your imagination and
please donate something so there will be more fun items for
you and everyone to bid on, and that means more funds for the
TAS programs we all enjoy! Auction donations don’t have to
be archeology related—if you like it, then chances are someone else will be willing to bid on it whether large or small!
Suggested items range from jewelry, books, gift certificates,
artwork (including your favorite photos), gift baskets, coffee,
archeology field tools, museum visitor passes, restaurant/hotel
passes, free all-inclusive trips, tee-shirts, backpacks, pottery,

baskets, archeology videos, etc.
Whether you are able to attend or not you can send your
items in advance to Kim Canseco who can be reached at 830313-1610 or kcanseco@stx.rr.com. If you are in the Del Rio
area, please give Kim a call or email and she’ll be happy to
come by and pick up your items. The sooner the items come

Wild Man
Dave Richards
May 15, 2009 | Commentary from
The Texas Observer
I first came across Bob Burleson’s name in the preface to Justice William O. Douglas’ Farewell to Texas: A
Vanishing Wilderness. “Jim Bowmer and Bob Burleson
of Temple guided me through secret canyons of the Rio
'RANDE v $OUGLAS RECALLED hLED ME IN EVER WIDENING
circles to discover wilderness areas from Capote Falls in
the west to the Big Thicket in the east.”
Bob, who died in April at 71, played an instrumental
ROLE IN LURING THE 3UPREME #OURT?S h'REAT $ISSENTERv AND
part-time conservationist to Texas on the trip that became
a groundbreaking book in 1967. Bob and his uncle, Jim
Bowmer, with whom he practiced law, had decided they
needed to publicize what they saw as threats to the Texas
environment. They knew about Douglas’ nature writings
and offered to pay his expenses and take the justice on a
tour of the state’s endangered areas. The result was one
of the first serious popular treatments of Texas’ physical
wonders and the threats they faced.
Bob leaves behind a formidable legacy of environmental achievement—literary, political, and personal. For
some, he’ll be remembered as our generation’s pioneer
in river exploration. The ultimate wilderness river trip in
4EXAS IS THROUGH THE ,OWER #ANYONS OF THE 2IO 'RANDE?

Former TAS President Bob Burleson
In 1973, Bob Burleson served as TAS President,
drafting and helping to pass the Texas Antiquities
Code. On many occasions, he helped preservationists and archeologists through legal mazes to protect
antiquities for future generations. TAS Field School
attendees will remember Bob as a dedicated worker
in the field with an outgoing personality. The evening
sing-along sessions always consisted of an everchanging assortment of musicians, usually with Bob
as a natural host. His repertoire of songs was amazing
as well as entertaining.
His wife Mickey, daughters Clair and Lea, and two
grandchildren survive Bob.
He will be missed.

Bob entertains at Field School, 2006

Entering at Stillwell Crossing, below the mouth of Boquillas Canyon at the edge of Big Bend Park, you don’t
spot civilization again until you reach Judge Roy Bean’s
Langtry, more than 100 miles down the river. Today you
can arrange for river guides to take you. Bob did it on his
own—and then helped others make the journey, publishing
the first detailed guide to this unexplored part of Texas.
Later, when Congress was considering designating it as a
Wild and Scenic River, a group of us, including then-Land
Commissioner Bob Armstrong, took Joe Lelyveld of The
New York Times down the Lower Canyons. We wanted
good PR for the proposal. After several days of fast water
and loose behavior, Lelyveld was suitably impressed. His
subsequent piece in the Times concluded that it mattered
little what Congress decreed: The river and the people were
already wild enough.
Bob’s activism ranged as broadly as he did. Under
his leadership, the Texas Explorers Club, which he helped
FOUND BECAME THE MOVING FORCE BEHIND CREATING 'UADALUPE
Mountains National Park. Bob had hiked these mountains,

knew their owner, and convinced him to cooperate with
the national park campaign. After years of constant pushing by Sen. Ralph Yarborough, the park became one more
tribute to Bob’s persuasive powers and his determination to
preserve Texas’ best. Bob became Texas conservationists’
favorite member of the state Parks and Wildlife Commission, leading the fight against dredging oyster beds. He
SERVED FROM ???? UNTIL ???? WHEN 'OV? $OLPH "RISCOE
declined to renominate him.
Though Bob’s guitar was a constant companion in his
travels across the Southwest and Northern Mexico, you
should not conjure up a vision of some latter-day Woody
'UTHRIE? "OB WAS A LAWYER AND HIS PRINCIPAL PRACTICE WAS
defending insurance companies against medical malpractice cases—making him, in some people’s estimation,
one of the Darth Vaders of the law. He was also the guy
who spent a number of years volunteering with the botany
department at the University of Texas, exploring Northern
Mexico and collecting plants and fauna in cooperation

with the Mexican government. His 1986 book with David
Riskind on “unconventional tourism” in the region, Backcountry Mexico, came from that part of his life. Bob was
impossible to pigeonhole.
With his wife, Mickey Burleson, Bob also became a
pioneer in “prairie replication.” The Burlesons restored
their 500-acre Bell County farm to a pre-cultivated, prelivestock state of tall-grass natural prairie; more than 80
varieties of wildflowers, among other original prairie
plants, have returned there. As part of their project, the
Burlesons co-authored a guidebook, The New Southern
Reconstruction: Home Grown Prairies.
“If you have reverence in your heart for the natural
world,” Bob said, “if you feel like your time on earth
is really very short, then you don’t necessarily have the
right to use up all the resources of the earth for your own
personal benefit.”
He was a great man to run the river with.

An Archeological Opportunity
By Ana Madrigal
I was lucky enough to attend another of TAS’ academies, this time focusing on Historical Archeology. As
an undergraduate at the University of Texas at Austin, I
had taken a few courses in this subject but had never had
the chance to really dig in. The theater and museum we
had lecture in were fantastic and really set the stage for
immersing yourself in the past, but of course that also
could have just been Joan Few’s contagious enthusiasm
and talent.
As a student of archaeology, I also enjoy the large
amount of information we received in our packets and the
CD. Countless times during the school year have I pawed
through Academy booklets and data sheets to use for a
class project or just as a refresher course before going out
into the field for practice.
The only complaint I have of these academies is that
they are just that; only two or sometimes three days’ worth
of information, such a short time spent with fellow budding
(or even retired) archaeologists and historians, and then
it’s back to work or the city you came from. Even though
I have only been attending these academies for the past
few months, I don’t see any reason why I won’t be coming back next year, and especially why I won’t be coming

back alone. As I was walking out the door to head to the
academy early that first morning, my mother tentatively
asked if I thought there might be any room left to sign up. I
replied that I didn’t see why they wouldn’t and they seemed
like a friendly bunch who wouldn’t mind making room for
another even if they didn’t; so she grabbed her purse and
before I knew it I had another partner in crime!
It really is so difficult to find archaeological opportunities that are local and most importantly, affordable, and I
think the TAS academies are just that! But besides that, I
really feel that people who care about archaeology, history,
and preserving stories for years to come surround me. So
again, I want to extend my sincerest thanks to you and all
of the others who have helped give me this scholarship!

Lake Jackson Opportunity
By Elizabeth Chapman
The ancient, winding oak trees and the still lake might
be out of a scene from Gone With the Wind, but I know better. The TAS Field School at the Lake Jackson Plantation
has replaced my romantic notions with a cold, hard scientific
glance. The ruins of the sugar mill are a testament to slavery’s
role in Texas history. Strewn throughout the piles of bricks
and rubble, the remains of a once-grand plantation house,
were once artifacts that belie the habits of the family that
once lived on this land.
The timing for this academy could not have been better—
my seventh grade Texas history students and I were just about
to start our unit on the Antebellum South and the Civil War.
It’s a difficult subject for the modern history teacher: how to
present this era of our past while being culturally sensitive,
historically accurate and politically correct. Lucky for me, the
TAS Academy made my job a little easier! Incorporating the
data about the material culture of the Texas coastal plantations
has given my lessons and activities an academic perspective
as well as a detailed, human approach. My students cringed
when I showed them a diagram of a machine to grind sugar
cane and I explained that machetes were kept nearby in case
a slave’s hand became caught in the gears. They have a more

accurate understanding of the culture and economy of Texas
during this era because of the demographics from the TAS
Academy which I shared with them.
In the fall, I hope to redesign my school’s unit on archeology to make our project more closely mirror the methods
practiced by professional archeologists. I think I will find the
guidance from the TAS field school very helpful! I wish more
teachers could experience this incredible opportunity.
As an aside—I thoroughly enjoyed my experience! The
methods part was interesting and useful—I wish I could figure
out a way to do the shard identification activity with my own
students. The perspective on plantation culture in Texas was
truly invaluable. I think my understanding of that period is
so much more complete now. In terms of what I would try
in the future, as a teacher I would have found the experience
even more meaningful with other educators. I’m not sure if
TAS has ever looked into this, but I think you could do an
incredible job with a professional development program for
teachers. If the cost were similar to that of the field school, I
think plenty of school districts would send people.
Thank you so much for this opportunity! My students
and I have really benefited from it!

“Digging Up Bones” from its Collection
Some of the greatest archeological and paleontological discoveries in North American have been made in the
Texas Panhandle. Over the last 75 years, the Archeology
Department of the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum has
amassed one of the largest archeological and paleontological collections in the United States. A new exhibit, Stones
and Bones from the Collection, will premiere at the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum on August 22, 2009, and run
through January 31, 2010. It will highlight the diversity of
the museum’s magnificent archeological, paleontological,
and geological treasures. PPHM’s significant collections
include Antelope Creek sites, Paleoindian bison kills, Triassic reptiles, and Mio-Plio-Pleistocene megafauna.
Visitors will learn the difference between archeologists, paleontologists, and geologists, when a rock is not
really a rock, and how to get involved protecting the natural and cultural history of Texas. The exhibit will feature
stones (geology), bones as stones (fossils), and stones and
bones as artifacts (archeology). The exhibit will promote
membership in the Texas Archeological Society, the Panhandle Archeological Society, and the Panhandle-Plains
Historical Society.
Stones and Bones from the Collection is one of a series of exhibits by the Archeology Department. For more

Recording Dead Man Canyon
By Teddy Stickney
The TAS Rock Art Recording crew had a session of
recording a small site in Dead Man Canyon in the Devils River
region, March 16-21, 2009. The shelter, more of an over hang
on the south perimeter of the canyon, is located approximately
three meters above the channel of the canyon. Many times in
the past the canyon has carried enough water to deposit debris
on the shelter’s floor by floodwaters. Luckily the water level has
never reached high enough to get on the panels of art.
The remnants of the paint along the wall of the shelter
left evidence of this being used as a pallet for painting. On the
south end of the shelter we recorded several meters of icons

that could be identified. One very skillfully painted red bird
was mapped in the northern end of the shelter.
It took the crew two days to record this shelter. The next
three days the crew members visited two shelters that had
previously been recorded and one shelter that the land owner
had found. This large shelter had some rock art, which the
rock art recording crew will be back to record later.
We wish to express our thanks to Mr. and Mrs. Rick
Rylander for allowing the crew to stay at their bunkhouse.
These accommodations were very comfortable and the
recording crew really appreciated their generosity.

Recent Documentation of a Profile in Mound A at
the Jamestown Mound Site (41SM54),
Smith County, Texas
Mark Walters and Timothy K. Perttula

Introduction
The Jamestown Mound site (41SM54) is located in
the northwestern part of Smith County, Texas, in the upper Sabine River basin in East Texas. The Archaeological
Conservancy (TAC), whose main office is in Albuquerque,
New Mexico, currently owns a portion (18 acres) of the
site as an archaeological preserve. There are seven known
prehistoric Caddo earthen mounds as well as midden and
habitation deposits identified at Jamestown (Perttula 1989;
Perttula and Walker 2008:Figure 1).
The Jamestown site remains a poorly known Caddo
mound center, however, and any new archaeological information about the deposits on the site will be useful to the
Caddo archaeological community as well as to the Caddo
Nation of Oklahoma. This article concerns the recent documentation of a significant profile in the principal earthen
mound (Mound A) at the site.

Mound A Background
The largest mound at Jamestown, Mound A (ca. 43
m in diameter and 4 m in height), is on the western edge
of TAC property. It has a wire fence across the crest that
separates a called 1.0 acre tract from the TAC property.
A survey conducted by the TAC when they acquired the
property in 2005 shows an area of encroachment involving the north/south property fence that bisects the Mound
A. In February 2009, Mark Walters, who is the Jamestown
site Steward for TAC, learned that the landowner of the
1.0 acre tract was excavating a hole in Mound A in this
area of encroachment. Mr. Walters visited the site and
talked with the landowner. With the landowner’s permission, Mr. Walters documented the excavation and made
a profile drawing of the north wall of the hole that was
approximately 1 m in diameter and 1.6 m in depth. The
hole was located approximately 1 m west of the existing
north/south wire fence on the crest of the mound.
E. Mott Davis, W. A. Davis, and Lathel Duffield of the
University of Texas at Austin visited the Jamestown site

✦

Summer 2009

in February 1959 and reported that Mound A was in good
condition with the exception of one large hole near the crest
of the mound. Mr. Sam Whiteside later placed a test unit in
1959 on the portion of Mound A that is currently owned by
TAC to determine if the mound was natural or man-made
(Perttula and Walker 2008:6 and Figure 7); his work confirmed that Mound A is an artificial and prehistoric construction. The exact location of that unit is not recorded but Mr.
Walters, who assisted in that effort, remembers that it was
on the opposite side of the fence from the current hole. In
that earlier work, Mr. Whiteside identified two buried zones
marked by concentrations of charcoal and ash at 27 cm bs
and 82-92 cm bs (this closely correlates to a burned house
floor documented in the 2009 profile, discussed below).
These two zones were separated by a clayey mound fill,
and there was clayey mound fill above the uppermost buried
zone. The concentrations of charcoal that marked both zones
suggest that they represent the remnants of two different
Caddo structures (of unknown age) that stood on the mound,
before they were burned and covered up by mound fill.

Profile of Mound A
Documented in 2009
The top 60 cm of the new profile in Mound A has a
disturbed pothole deposit of light yellowish-brown sandy
loam mixed with clumps of red clay (Zone I) (Figure 1).
There were also historic artifacts in this zone, including
one 20th century colorless glass bottle. The presence of the
red clay in the disturbed deposits suggests that there was
one or more mound capping episodes that were disturbed
by a previous pothole, likely the upper mound fill zone
identified by Sam Whiteside in his excavation (see Perttula
and Walker 2008).
Below the disturbed Zone I is a 13 cm thick mound
fill deposit (60-73 cm bs) of light yellowish-brown sandy
loam (Zone I) overlaying a 9 cm thick (ca. 73-82 cm bs)
cap of red sandy clay (Zone III). Below the clay cap is a
charcoal-stained 8 cm (82-90 cm bs) thick layer of brown

??# ? ??? ????
??# ? ??? ????

sandy loam (Zone IV) representing the remnants of a
burned Caddo house (see Figure 1). Underlying the first
burned house floor is a 10 cm thick zone (Zone V, 90-100
cm bs) of yellowish-brown sandy loam with scattered
flecks of charcoal that probably represents the movement
of charred organic materials from the burned floor into a
lower zone of mound fill.
Beneath Zone V is another mound fill deposit of light
yellowish-brown sandy loam (Zone VI) that is approximately 25 cm in thickness (100-125 cm bs). This is followed by
another mound fill deposit of red clay (Zone VII, 125-137
cm bs). This second clay cap covers another 8-10 cm thick
lens of charcoal-stained brown sandy loam (Zone VIII, 137145 cm bs) representing a second burned Caddo house floor
exposed in the profile. Below this burned floor is another
mound fill deposit of light yellowish-brown sandy loam
(Zone IX) that extends to at least 160 cm bs. No excavations
occurred below this depth.

Conclusions
The 2009 documentation of a profile in Mound A at the
Jamestown Mound site, in conjunction with previously obtained information from earlier work there (see Perttula and
Walker 2008:Figure 7), indicates that at least three burned
Caddo house floors are present within the top 160 cm of the
earthen mound: at ca. 27 cm bs, 82-92 cm bs, and 137-146
??????
cm bs. Associated Caddo artifacts are very sparse in these
burned house floor deposits. The mound appears to have been
built up through the construction, use, and destruction of specialized structures, probably not intended for domestic use,
that stood on the mound platform through several temporal
episodes; it is likely that there are additional burned house
floors preserved in the lower (and still untouched) mound
deposits (ca. 1.6-4 m bs) in Mound A.
Prehistoric artifacts were unfortunately not noted in the
cursory examination of the Mound A profile, and thus in
the absence of radiocarbon or OSL dates, no archaeological
information was gathered that is indicative of when Mound
A was constructed and used in the course of the Caddo
settlement of the site and the local region. However, Caddo
artifacts found in previous investigations across the Jamestown site (although not from Mound A), especially decorated ceramic vessel sherds, suggest that the mound center
was established and used during the Middle Caddo period,
from ca. A.D. 1200-1400 (Perttula and Walker 2008:7).
Finally, the landowner also reported that he found no
artifacts in his excavations, other than historic materials

from the disturbed Zone I (see Figure 1). In an encouraging
note, the landowner stated that he would discontinue work
on the mound and backfill his excavations. Hopefully, there
will be no more damage done to Mound A at this important,
but as of yet, little known East Texas Caddo mound site.

Forensic Recovery of a Looted Burial at
the Memphis (Texas) City Park
Matthew S. Taylor, Assistant Curator of Archeology, Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum
In February 2009, two individuals discovered human
remains in the Memphis City Park while illegally hunting for
artifacts. According to articles in the Amarillo Globe-News
(Beilue 2009) and Hall County Herald (Cook 2009), the pair
were hunting for “arrowheads” and noticed bone eroding out
of the wall of an abandoned sand pit. After digging into the
wall, they uncovered a human skull. Concerned that they may
have discovered a crime scene, the pair contacted the Hall
County Sheriff’s Department and Memphis City Police.
The Memphis Police investigated the scene and Police
Sergeant J.R. Helm quickly determined that the human remains were archeological and not of medico-legal significance
(Beilue 2009). Jehromie Penrod, Chief of Police, contacted
the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum (PPHM) for consultation. In late February, staff of the PPHM and Texas Historical Commission (THC) archeology stewards Rolla Shaller and
Alvin Lynn conducted a salvage excavation of the remnants
of the burial and a survey of the immediate area.

Archeological and Osteological
Investigations
The archeological survey of the city park and the abandoned sand pit did not reveal any prehistoric cultural materials other than those associated with the burial. However, it is
strongly suspected that the immediate area may have greater
archeological significance. The two individuals who discovered
the human remains were likely looking for artifacts because
cultural material had previously been found in the vicinity.
Conversations with the Memphis police and articles in the Amarillo Globe-News suggest that artifacts had indeed been found
in the park before the discovery of human remains. The grave
site was small and had been nearly destroyed by erosion and
unauthorized digging (Figure 1). Most of the human remains
were found in a talus slope immediately below the burial.
Memphis police recovered a large (18.2cm) conch shell
gorget and four snail shell beads. Excavations and screening of the talus slope revealed an additional 43 snail beads
and a canine tibia, but it is not clear if the animal bone was
directly associated with the burial. The gorget appears to be
from a large whelk (Buscyon sp.) and is similar to gorgets
found in Late Archaic (1500 BC–AD 600) cemeteries on the
Texas coastal plain (Hall 1981) and several Antelope Creek
(AD 1200–1450) burials in the Canadian River Valley (Lintz
1986). Although conchs are found along the coast of Texas,

the nearest modern sources of whelks big enough to make
very large pendants are the southwest coast of Florida or the
gulf coast of Tamaulipas, Mexico (Hall 1981).
After consulting with various experts on North American snails, the beads were identified as the Onyx Rock Snail
(Leptoxis praerosa). The native range of this water snail
includes the Ohio, Cumberland, and Tennessee Rivers and
THEIR TRIBUTARIES ?'OODRICH ???? ? ! SEARCH OF 00(- ARCHIVES
revealed that beads made from this snail had not been previously reported in the Texas Panhandle.
The human remains were analyzed macroscopically
according to procedures outlined in Buikstra and Ubelaker
(1994). Skeletal preservation was fair to good, depending on
the skeletal element. Unfortunately, many joint surfaces were
damaged post-mortem, which limited some analyses. The
features of the skull and pelvis indicate that the individual was
male. Based upon the severity of dental wear and the presence
of extensive osteoarthritis, the individual is estimated to be at
least 55 years of age at death. A measurement of the left femur
diaphysis resulted in an estimated stature of 178±3.27cm (5'8"
to 5'11") using Steele’s (1970) formulas.
Pathological conditions observed on the skeleton indicate
that this individual suffered from chronic disorders associated with old age. Significant osteoarthritis or degenerative
joint disease was observed in the spine, right shoulder, the
sacro-iliac joint, and the hands. The cortical walls of the long

staff set out immediately to record, survey, and excavate the
disturbed site. Memphis Police Chief Jehromie Penrod and
Sergeant J.R. Helm should be commended for moving rapidly
to protect endangered cultural resourced under their jurisdiction
(Figure 2). Their response is evidence that public outreach done
by the Texas Archeological Society, Texas Historical Commission, and Panhandle-Plains Historical Society is having a positive effect on local attitudes and law enforcement regarding the
protection of cultural resources and unmarked graves.

bones appear to be unusually thin and the overall weight of
the skeletal elements is lighter than expected. This may be
the result of osteopenia, or the abnormal thinning of cortical
bone. High-resolution imaging of the long bones is necessary
to quantify this bone loss. The dentition was characterized
by a high level of occlusal surface wear. Four maxillary and
three mandibular teeth were lost before death. An active dental
abscess was observed above the right first maxillary molar.

Discussion and Conclusion
Unfortunately, the lack of diagnostic artifacts prevents a
reasonably accurate estimation of the date of the Memphis City
Park burial. Present budget constraints do not allow for submittal of a radiocarbon date at this time. Based upon the artifacts
that were recovered, the context of the site, and comparison
with other burials in the Texas Panhandle (see Summers
1997), the individual may date to the Archaic period (7500 to
1700 years before present). However, radiocarbon assays are
required before any firm date can be established. The PPHM
HAS BEGUN THE CONSULTATION PROCESS AS REQUIRED BY .!'02!?
the final disposition of the remains is undetermined.
The exotic grave inclusions found with the burial are
important artifacts that will shed light on the nature of early
long-distance exchange networks. Exotic items such as these
made their way into the Texas Panhandle during the Antelope
Creek Phase (Lintz 1986), but were much more rare in earlier
time periods (Summers 1997). A full report on the Memphis
City Park burial is currently being prepared for publication
that will further interpret the significance of these artifacts.
The finding and excavation at Memphis City Park is a
fine example of the recognition and protection of archeological resources by local law enforcement. In keeping with the
Panhandle-Plains Historical Society’s mission to preserve and
protect the cultural history of the Texas Panhandle, PPHM

Books for Summer Reading
Texas Archeologist “Wrote the Book” on the Improbable
Fred Wendorf really hates being compared to Indiana
Jones. For a serious scientist who has devoted his life to
breaking down archeological barriers and preserving history, being likened to a two-dimensional movie character
is not that flattering.
But Wendorf has been a magnet for adventure, which
comes across loud and clear in his new book, Desert Days:
My Life as a Field Archaeologist, published by Southern
Methodist University Press. From New Mexico to the Nile
Valley, Wendorf has taken great joy in doing what other
scientists said couldn’t, or shouldn’t, be done. And if that
sounds like a movie hero, so be it.
The story of this Terrell, Texas native and Southern
Methodist University emeritus professor begins and almost
ends on a battlefield in Italy during World War II, where
shrapnel wounds destroyed nerves in his right arm and
rendered it almost useless. He spent two years in Army
hospitals before returning to the University of Arizona,
determined to become an archeologist.
However, Wendorf was reluctant to sign up for the
archaeology field school because he thought his bad arm
would make him a liability on-site. “I soon learned that
despite my war injuries I could dig with a pick and shovel,
and I could do it well,” Wendorf writes. He would not put
down that pick and shovel for the next four decades:
Wendorf is the father of what is now known as “salvage archeology.” His lengthy excavation just steps ahead
OF AN %L 0ASO .ATURAL 'AS PIPELINE IN ???? SET THE STANDARD
for preserving archeological remains at a time when postwar construction was turning massive amounts of dirt.
“People started thinking abut the destruction that was occurring every time America built a bridge, a roadway or a
pipeline,” Wendorf says.
He shrugged off the low expectations of other archeologists in 1961 to study the area soon to be flooded by the
Aswan Dam on the Nile River. His work opened the doors
to the prehistory of the area when few were interested in
what occurred before the time of the Pharoahs. The British Museum acquired Wendorf’s eventual collection of six
million Nile Valley artifacts in 2001.

Wendorf’s crew found a group of 58 skeletons in 1965
at Jebel Sahaba in present-day Egypt that calibrated radio
carbon dating has proved to be 14,700 years old. The bones
bore signs of extreme violence, providing evidence of the
earliest organized warfare in prehistoric times.
Wendorf is Henderson-Morrison Professor of Prehistory Emeritus in Dedman College of Humanities and Sciences at SMU. He is revered at the Dallas university for his
excavation of the old U.S. Cavalry outpost at Fort Burgwin,
N.M. that eventually became home to the satellite campus,
SMU-in-Taos and its archaeology field school.

Silent Witness to Texas History: Archeology and
Artifacts of Goliad‚ Presidio La Bahia By Anne A. Fox,
Samuel P. Nesmith, and Daniel E. Fox
Publication Date: March 2009 275 pages, 106 figures,
39 full color ISBN: 978-0-615-27997-8
“This is a seminal achievement for Texas archeology and history, as the artifacts from the site
represent one of the most important Spanish colonial, Mexican, and Anglo-American collections ever
excavated in Texas.”
—from the Preface by Jim Bruseth

In 1963-1964, archeologist Roland Beard recovered
more than 12,000 artifacts during an excavation at Presidio
,A "AHIA A ???? 3PANISH MILITARY FORT IN 'OLIAD 4EXAS?
Those artifacts lay unheralded in display cases and in a
dusty storage room for more than 45 years.
Until now. Historical archeologists Anne and Daniel
Fox and renowned military historian Samuel Nesmith
have undertaken the first study of the Presidio La
Bahia restoration collection. Their work, just published
as Silent Witness to Texas History, provides detailed
identifications and descriptions, complete with hundreds
of photographs, of one of the largest and most impressive

artifact collections in Texas. From Spanish colonial,
Mexican, and Texian weapons to a wide range of
domestic artifacts, the collection provides a fascinating
view of life at the presidio during 100 years in history
when Texas underwent political change from a Spanish
colonial power to modern statehood.
The book will interest archeologists and anyone interested in Texas history. Including a detailed analysis of
the largest collection of gun parts found at a Texas site, it
offers a good picture of the arms and equipment carried
by the Mexican soldiers and the fledgling Texian army
during the Texas Revolution. Pictured and described are
engraved Spanish colonial escopeta trigger guards and
Mexican India pattern musket parts, Texian cannons and
military uniform buttons. A military history includes the
COMPLETE -EXICAN /RDER OF "ATTLE AT THE TIME OF THE 'OLIAD
Massacre, when Colonel Fannin and 341 of his troops were
EXECUTED ON ORDERS OF -EXICAN 'ENERAL 3ANTA !NNA?
This book also provides insight into daily life at the
presidio when it was occupied by Spanish, and later Texian, soldiers. The authors analyze the collection of more
than 6,000 ceramic sherds, a vast collection of cast-iron
items such as kettles, and colored and specialty bottle
glass. A detailed history of Presidio La Bahia and the
'OLIAD AREA FOCUSES MUCH DESERVED ATTENTION ON A PLACE
that, although still unknown to many, was a silent witness
to some of the most important events and cultural shifts
in our state’s history.

About the Authors
Anne A. Fox has worked in the field of historical
archeology for more than 40 years. With her extensive
knowledge of Spanish colonial archeology and ceramics,
she has led and participated in archeological excavations
for the Center for Archaeological Research at The University of Texas at San Antonio, including projects at the
Alamo and the Spanish missions.

Reorganization Accomplished!
By Barbara Chadwick, Region 4 Director
The East Texas Archeological Society has reorganized! There were 20 people in attendance at Stephen
F. Austin University for the meeting on May 17th. While
there were several former members, it was great that there
were also several new faces, including representation
from the SFA anthropology department—both students
and professors!
The program for the evening included an overview
of three different ongoing investigations in the NacogdoCHES3AN !UGUSTINE AREA? $R? 'EORGE !VERY PRESENTED A
report on the Heritage Center at SFA and further testing
at Mission Dolores, Dr. Morris Jackson gave a presentation on the future 9 Flags Museum and sites on and near
the square in Nacogdoches, and Dr. Tom Middlebrook
discussed the D’Ortalon rancho site. There is need for
further investigation at these sites as well as lots of survey
work to be done.

The attendees voted to have Dr. Middlebrook as the
interim president since he has possession of the society’s
bylaws, checking account, etc. He will take time this summer to compile the information for a meeting in September,
at which time the annual membership dues will be collected,
officers will be elected, and an events calendar will be created. It was also agreed to make a contribution to the 17th
Annual East Texas Archeological Conference to be held in
conjunction with the Caddo Conference in March of 2010
in Tyler. Finally, even though the society is “in transition”,
plans are underway for several different Texas Archeology
Awareness activities in October!
If you live in the East Texas area and are interested
in joining this society, please contact Barbara Chadwick,
Region 4 Director, at jvalleytex@yahoo.com or Dr. Tom
Middlebrook, steward in the THC network, at TMdlbrk@
