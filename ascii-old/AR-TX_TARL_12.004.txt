INTRODUCTION
BY
TIMOTHY K. PERTTULA

This publication brings together, and makes
generally available for the first time, four reports
on late 1950s archeological investigations by The
University of Texas (UT) at Ferrell’s Bridge Reservoir—now known as Lake O’ the Pines—in the Big
Cypress Creek basin in Northeast Texas. The reports discuss the excavations and archeological findings at the Whelan site (41MR2), the Dalton site
(41UR11), the Ben McKinney site (41MR12), and
the Isadore Segal site (41MR1). The principal focus of the reports is on the Late Caddo period (ca.
A.D. 1400–1680) occupations at each of the sites,
although each site also had Archaic (ca. 8000–500
B.C.) and Woodland (ca. 500 B.C.–A.D. 800) period use; the Dalton site was also occupied during
Late Paleoindian times (ca. 8600–8000 B.C.).
Thurmond (1990, 24–25) provides a succinct
summary of the history of archeological investigations at Lake O’ the Pines between 1951 and 1960,
noting that the investigations:
were strong on the provision of detailed intrasite
information of specific site types, but weak in the
assessment of overall site density and distribution.
A substantial number of sites received a level of
investigation sufficient to permit a comfortable evaluation of the chronological and functional characters
of their components (a rare occurrence in northeast Texas)… (Thurmond 1990, 24).

In addition to the archeological work summarized in this publication, other investigations by UT
that led to the preparation of reports included work
at the Late Caddo Harroun site (41UR10), a mound
center (Jelks and Tunnell 1959); Jake Martin
(41UR12) (Davis and Davis 1960), a shallowly buried Archaic archeological deposit; Southall (41UR3),
a large Late Caddo habitation area and cemetery
(looted in the years after the UT work ended)
(Tunnell 1959a); and Sam Roberts (41CP8), a multicomponent Archaic and Caddo site on Prairie Creek
at the northern end of Lake O’ the Pines (Tunnell
1959b). A small mound of Late Caddo age was
investigated in one area of the site, and there are

also apparent Whelan phase and Titus phase habitation areas there.
After the UT work ended in 1960, archeological investigations—other than a mid-1980s reanalysis of recovered Caddo ceramics from the Whelan
site (Lisk 1984, a thesis pertinent to additional research on this site; see Thurmond 1990)—at Lake
O’ the Pines did not begin again in earnest until the
mid-1990s. That work, funded by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District, who manage the lake, was a consequence of intensive timber harvesting along the lake shore and in larger
land tracts around the lake itself. Archeological
surveys of these proposed timber harvest tracts
have been on-going since the mid-1990s (i.e.,
Burson and Cliff 2000; Cliff and Hunt 1998; Hunt
and Borrego 2002; Hunt et al. 1995, 2002; Largent
et al. 2004; Linder-Linsley and Lindsay 1997; Moore
et al. 1996; Rose and Trierweiler 2009, 2010;
Trierweiler and Bonine 2004; Trierweiler and Jones
2005, 2006; Trierweiler et al. 2002).
Archeological Resource Protection Act permitted survey investigations were also conducted by
the Friends of Northeast Texas Archaeology in the
late 1990s. Their concern was to document the
extent of the looting of prehistoric Caddo cemetery
sites on Federal lands at Lake O’ the Pines, and
identify previously unrecorded Caddo sites that may
be vulnerable to looting (Perttula et al. 1996;
Perttula and Nelson 1997; see also Cast and Perttula
2002). These investigations indicated that there
had been considerable looting of Caddo burials on
federal property along and near the shoreline at
Lake O’ the Pines, including at the Ben McKinney
site, one of the reports included in this publication.
Excavations at archeological sites at Lake O’
the Pines since 1960 have been very limited, and
thus little new information about the prehistoric
peoples that lived along Big Cypress Creek in this
area of East Texas has been gained in the last 50
years. These investigations include a mostly unproductive testing project along a recently exca1

vated pipeline trench at the Dalton (41UR11) site
and 41UR191 (Burson 2001), and a limited examination of a looted Late Caddo Titus phase mound,
namely the Camp Joy Mound (41UR144; see Turner
1993; Perttula and Nelson 2001). This mound site
had been overlooked during all previous archeological surveys at Lake O’ the Pines. The Camp Joy
mound was built and used by a Titus phase group
beginning perhaps in the mid- to late 15th century,
its purpose being to mark the location of an important building that was deliberately burned at that
location.
The Camp Joy mound is located very near to
the Dalton, Chastain (41UR18), and Harroun sites;
these “sites” may in fact comprise separate, arbitrarily distinguished portions of a dispersed multiple mound center used by a larger Titus phase
community or communities in the Titus phase heartland. Each of these sites have mounds built over
wooden structures that probably had a special religious and ritual purpose to the Caddo communities, and the earthen mounds were built up over
the structures after they had been burned.
More recently, as a result of Native American
Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA)
consultation between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma, certain
NAGPRA funerary objects from the Ben McKinney
site were reexamined and documented by Perttula
et al. (2009). This work determined that these
funerary objects were culturally affiliated with the
Caddo Nation since the manner of burial practice
(i.e., in a pit where the body of the deceased Caddo
individual is primarily laid in the grave in an extended position with funerary objects placed around
the body) and the kinds of funerary objects placed
with the deceased, including culturally diagnostic
and well-recognized Caddo pottery types and arrow point types, and other recognizably Caddo
objects, are completely consistent with these being
from Caddo burials. They were not unassociated
funerary objects of unknown cultural affiliation as
a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (2004) study had
implausibly determined.
One of the main archeological contributions
of the 1950s UT work at Lake O’ the Pines was the
recognition of the Whelan phase, a local Late Caddo
archeological culture best known from sites with a
distinctive ceramic assemblage in the middle reaches
2

of the Big Cypress Creek basin (Thurmond 1985,
1990, 228). The best known sites of the Whelan
phase, dated by Thurmond (1990, Table 8) to A.D.
1400–1500 and by Perttula (1992, 102–107) to
A.D. 1350–1450, are the sites at Lake O’ the Pines,
including the Whelan and Dalton sites included in
this report.
The few calibrated radiocarbon dates for the
Whelan phase indicate it began no earlier than AD
1387 (Table 1), based on the dates from the Sam
Roberts, Harroun, and Dalton sites. Its chronological span is poorly developed because of the few
absolute dates for the Late Caddo period sequence
(Thurmond 1990, Table 60; Story 1990, Table 81),
but recent excavations in the Big Cypress Creek,
White Oak Creek, and Sulphur River basins have
aggressively pursued Late Caddo dating strategies.
More than 90 calibrated radiocarbon dates and 160+
Oxidizable Carbon Ratio dates (e.g., Frink 1994)
from Titus phase contexts suggest that it dates
from ca. A.D. 1430–1680 (Perttula 2005, Tables
11–2 and 11–3).
The early radiocarbon dates from the Lake O’
the Pines Caddo sites discussed in this report were
apparently obtained on concentrations of wood
charcoal (probably of several species of wood, and
it is not known if the dated samples were on just
one wood species) from burned Late Caddo house
debris. The dates from the Sam Roberts and Dalton
sites were run after the reports were actually written, so the authors did not have the benefit of the
results when they prepared their conclusions about
the age of the sites. Suffice it to say that the radiocarbon dating of Caddo sites at Lake O’ the Pines
is not adequate in itself to establish with any confidence the age of Whelan and Titus phase sites
found there.
The use of wood charcoal is far from ideal for
radiocarbon dating, primarily because of the possibility that modern charcoal (from recent East Texas
timber harvesting) has been commingled with the
ancient wood charcoal whose age is in question;
the dating of any old wood sections from large
chunks of burned wood can also result in obtaining
falsely older radiocarbon results. The dating of
samples of plant annuals—charred seeds and nutshells, as well as pieces of charred corncobs and
cupules—is much preferred these days for radiocarbon dating, as they are more likely to be asso-

ter of dates also overlaps with the beginning years of the Titus phase. This

FOREWORD
This is a descriptive report of a field project at the Whelan site, 41MR2, a prehistoric late Caddoan
site in Marion County, northeastern Texas. The project was carried out by the Division of Research in
Anthropology of The University of Texas through a co-operative agreement with the National Park
Service, as part of the Inter-Agency Archeological Salvage Program. The Whelan site is in the Ferrell's
Bridge Reservoir Area on Cypress Creek, a western tributary of the Red River. The field project was carried
on from January to April, 1957, under the supervision of the writer.
The cultural material from the Whelan site does not fit well into any one of the established late
Caddoan (Fulton Aspect) complexes, as it bears resemblances to the Titus, Texarkana, Bossier, and
Frankston foci. Work done more recently than that reported here indicates that the Whelan material
represents only one of two or more complexes to be found in this part of Cypress Creek valley. However,
it will not be possible, until the total Ferrell's Bridge Project is completed, to make a general statement
concerning the valley. For this reason the present report is largely descriptive in nature, full comparative
studies being deferred until later field work at Ferrell's Bridge is completed and the data may be analyzed
as a whole.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The work described here was carried out under the terms of a cooperative agreement between The
University of Texas and the National Park Service. I am grateful to Charlie R. Steen, Archeologist at the
Region Three office of the Park Service, and to Edward B. Jelks, formerly of the Austin office of the River
Basin Surveys of the Park Service and now in charge of the Texas Archeological Salvage Project, for
arranging this agreement. Mr. Jelks in particular has been most generous as advisor, helper, and friend,
and he lent us considerable field equipment which contributed a great deal to the effectiveness of our
work.
Personnel of the Corps of Engineers at the Ferrell's Bridge Dam gave us their hearty cooperation and
frequent assistance, and it is impossible to express adequately my gratitude for their support. In particular, thanks are due H. W. Fletcher, Project Engineer; O. L. Stafford, Assistant Project Engineer; John A.
Whitson, Realty Officer; W. S. Alsop, Chief Inspector; W. R. Thomas, Clearing Inspector; and Miss
Margaret Ramsay, Clerk. They and their co-workers on the staff at the dam were always ready to extend

A considerable number of people from the Ferrell's Bridge area helped us out in one way or another,
among them Tom Browning, Harold Caver, Jr., J. H. Chatham, E. W. Hayner, Mr. and Mrs. John S. Moseley,
George Ramsay, R. R. Nicholas, Gus Noble, I. B. Price, Jr., Loss Sloan, and Clarence Wicker. Dr. Clarence
H. Webb and Robert L. Fulton of Shreveport visited the Whelan site while we were working there, and I
benefited considerably from their observations based on long experience in Caddoan archeology.
I am also grateful for the administrative support of Dr. T. N. Campbell, Chairman of the Department
of Anthropology and Director of the Division of Research in Anthropology at The University of Texas, and
Mr. Jens M. Jacobsen, Director of the Office of Government Sponsored Research at The University, who
steered the project through the tortuous paths of the bureaucratic maze. No small part in this same task
was played by Anne Mayhew Brown, Secretary of the Department of Anthropology, who performed
effectively the intricate functions of her office which kept the entire project moving along.
Acknowledgment is made of particular services at the site rendered by LeRoy Johnson, Jr., and Paul
Rosenberg. The processing of the artifacts in the laboratory was done by W. Brent Hempkins, Don R.
Morrison, Miles Richardson, S. L. Gilman, and Howard Wimberley.
Particular thanks are due to my field assistant, W. A. Davis, whose manifold talents as foreman and
archeological technician were a major factor in the success of the field work.

The Whelan Site, A Late Caddoan Component

GEOGRAPHICAL, HISTORICAL,
AND ARCHEOLOGICAL
BACKGROUND
GEOGRAPHY
Cypress Creek is a major western tributary of
the Red River, flowing for more than 125 miles east
and southeast through northeastern Texas into
Caddo Lake on the Texas-Louisiana border and
thence into the Red River at Shreveport. Alternative local names are Big Cypress Creek (in contrast
to Little Cypress Creek nearby) and Cypress Bayou.
The Ferrell's Bridge Dam, a project of the U.S.
Corps of Engineers, is on Cypress Creek approximately 10 miles west of Jefferson in Marion County,
Texas (Figure 1). The official name for the reservoir impounded by the dam is Lake O’ the Pines.
The Conservation Pool of the lake will have an
elevation of about 200 feet above sea level, and
the lake is not expected to go below this level. The
Water Supply Pool will be at approximately 230
feet, at which level the lake can be expected to be
held more or less permanently. The Flood Control
Pool will be at 250 feet—the elevation of the spillway lip—and at this level the lake will extend upstream nearly 30 miles and will vary in width up to
about 2 miles. Archeological salvage work at the
reservoir area is limited to the area of the Flood
Control Pool and adjacent Public Access and construction areas.
This area is near the northwestern margin of
the Gulf Coastal Plain (U.S. Corps of Engineers
1953). The topography is characterized by rounded,
sand-covered hills aligned in belts trending roughly
northwest-southeast. Elevations reach approximately 375 feet above sea level in the southern
portion of the Ferrell's Bridge region, and over 400
feet in the northern part. These highest points are
generally capped by erosion-resistant iron ores of
Tertiary age.
The rugged topography of the hills contrasts
with remnants of a nearly flat Pleistocene terrace in
Cypress Creek valley at about 250 feet elevation at
the dam site. Below this terrace is the present floodplain of Cypress Creek, varying in width up to nearly
2 miles. The floodplain sediments are alluvium of

E. Mott Davis

Recent age, and like the Pleistocene terrace are
made up of sands and clays.
This region is part of the “Piney Woods” of
the southeastern United States. The native vegetation is classed as southern hardwood forest, predominantly oak-pine. The hillsides and uplands are
forested mainly with oak and pine, and the bottomlands with mixed hardwoods. Until the early
20th century, the bottoms were covered with a primeval forest of great trees with relatively little underbrush. Local people recall how, as late as the
1920s, one could ride and hunt in this forest, and
see as far as the tree-trunks would allow. Today
only great stumps remain as reminders of this forest, which has been entirely lumbered away. The
growth which has succeeded it consists of mixed
hardwood trees and an almost impenetrable tangle
of underbrush and thorny vines. For all practical
purposes it is impossible to conduct effective archeological reconnaissance in this thicket, and one
can find sites only by hearing of them from people
who have hunted and fished along Cypress Creek
for many years.
The climate is humid, the annual precipitation
being about 48 inches a year. Summer temperatures commonly go above 90º F., whereas in winter
frosts are common, and snow is not unknown. The
mean annual temperature is 65º F., and there is a
257-day average growing season (Texas Almanac
1958–59). Spring is the chief rainy season, the
summer and fall being relatively dry. There have
been wide variations in this pattern—for instance,
the long drought of several years which terminated
in January, 1957; the extraordinarily heavy rainfall
which began at that time and increased to a climax
in April with major floods; and a second period of
almost unprecedented rains in October and November of the same year. At such times of heavy
rains Cypress Creek overflows its banks, a circumstance frequent enough to make agriculture on the
floodplain precarious. Nearly all of the bottomland
is today in forest.
HISTORY
This countryside was once the home of Indians speaking Caddoan languages. Specifically, historical records indicate that at the time of first White
contact, Cypress Creek valley was between the main

area began in the 1840s.
Paddle-wheel river boats of
shallow draft could come up the
Red River and Cypress Creek as
far as Jefferson, which became
a supply and shipping point for
a hinterland several hundred
miles in diameter. By 1860
Jefferson had a population of
about 30,000. This pattern of
movement up the streams from
the Mississippi valley could well
have had its counterpart in prehistoric times, since the streams
afford natural highways and
were the logical routes of agricultural expansion. However,
cross-country travel is also easy
in this country, as there are no
real topographic barriers to
movement in any direction.

general interest in history and traditions. Interest
in local prehistory is increasing, but as yet it has
largely taken the form of pot-hunting, which often
assumes serious proportions. Whole Indian cemeteries are undergoing systematic destruction for
pottery vessels and other aboriginal objets d’art.
The archeologist on survey finds interest, cooperation, and friendliness everywhere, except for the
secrecy to be expected in many pot-hunters and in
people who are operating clandestine stills in the
woods. Most of the sites known in the Ferrell's
Bridge area were found through the unselfish assistance of local people, including a few collectors
who value scientific endeavor above the augmentation of their own collections.
LOCAL ARCHEOLOGY
Cypress Creek is in the Caddoan archeological
area, and many Caddoan sites are known in the
vicinity of the Ferrell's Bridge Reservoir area. There
are also indications of earlier occupations. East Texas
Archaic sites are relatively common on the uplands
and spurs bordering the valley. They are characterized by large projectile points, occasional grooved
stone axes, and an absence of pottery. It is not
unusual to find sparse indications of Archaic occupation stratigraphically below Caddoan components
in East Texas.
There are also occasional hints of a PaleoIndian occupation in the form of Scottsbluff and
Meserve points, numbers of which—all surface
finds—are to be found in local collections. Rarely,
fluted points are reported, as well as a few which
conform to the Plainview category. As yet no actual
Paleo-Indian sites are known.
The Caddoan sites known in the Ferrell's Bridge
area before 1957 were all Titus Focus components
of the Fulton Aspect, believed to date from about
A.D. 1200–1500 (Suhm et al. 1954, 189–195). I
know of only one probable Gibson Aspect site in
this whole area, on Caddo Lake; but there are also
reports of other Gibson Aspect, as well as Fulton
Aspect, components elsewhere on Caddo Lake.
However, in the vicinity of the Ferrell's Bridge Reservoir itself no components but those of the Titus
Focus had been reported before the work described
here, and all archeological digging in this area, by
professionals or amateurs, had been devoted to

E. Mott Davis

the excavation of Titus Focus cemeteries. The H.
R. Taylor site in the Little Cypress drainage not far
from Harleton is, as a matter of fact, one of the
type sites of Titus Focus. At this site more than
550 vessels were found with 64 burials, one of the
burials containing 35 vessels and other artifacts
(Suhm et al. 1954, 190). Within the Cypress Creek
drainage are numerous other Titus Focus sites, of
which the Cash, Reed, and Riley sites are at the
edge of the reservoir area itself. As mentioned previously, no historic Caddoan sites are known in this
part of Cypress Creek valley.
In summary, then, the archeological knowledge of the Ferrell's Bridge reservoir area and vicinity, as of 1956, consisted of a good deal of information about Titus Focus—itself only a burial
complex as far as investigations had gone—and
scattered, unsystematic knowledge of Archaic components based on examination of surface collections.
History of Archeological Studies
In 1931 A. T. Jackson excavated several Titus
Focus cemeteries in this area for The University of
Texas, including the Taylor, Cash, Reed, and Riley
sites already mentioned. After Jackson’s work, more
than 20 years passed without systematic archeological attention to the area. Then in the late 1940s
the Corps of Engineers drew up plans for the Ferrell's
Bridge Reservoir, and this project brought the Inter-Agency Archeological Salvage Program into the
picture. In 1951 the River Basin Surveys office in
Austin (then a branch of the Smithsonian Institution and later transferred to the National Park Service) sent E. H. Moorman and E. O. Miller to make
a preliminary archeological survey of the reservoir
area. This work was carried out in January, February, and April, 1951, and resulted in the recording
of 32 sites (River Basin Surveys 1951). The potsherds collected from the surface of these sites
were predominantly of Titus Focus types, but some
resembled Texarkana Focus types, and a few were
Gibson Aspect sherds.
Construction work on the Ferrell's Bridge Dam
was well under way in 1956 when plans were completed for archeological salvage work by The University of Texas, through a cooperative agreement
with the National Park Service. The work described
13

E. Mott Davis

The Whelan Site, A Late Caddoan Component

in this report, which took place in early 1957, represents the first part of the Ferrell's Bridge Archeological Project. This first phase of the work was
devoted to the Conservation Pool area, the minimum area of water storage, which extends about
four miles upstream from the dam. This pool was
scheduled to fill in the late summer of 1957 when
the creek was to be closed and the water allowed
to rise to the level of the outlet tubes. Forest clearing plans called for clearing only a part of the Conservation Pool area.
The only site known within the Conservation
Pool was the Whelan site, numbered 29A6-2 and
more recently changed to 41MR21, near the upper
end of the Conservation Pool area on the left (north)
side of Cypress Creek. Accordingly it was at this
site that the work was concentrated. A few inconclusive tests were carried on at the nearby Segal
site (41MR1), but this site, being above the Conservation Pool, was left for later investigation. The
present report is, then, concerned exclusively with
the Whelan site.

THE SITE
The Whelan site, now inundated by the Lake
O’ the Pines, was a mound and occupation site on
the north side of Cypress Creek approximately 4
miles upstream (northwest) from the Ferrell's Bridge
Dam. It was at the upper edge of the Conservation
(dead storage) Pool of the lake, and 20 to 25 feet
below the Operating Pool level. The site was reached
by a logging road which goes south from state
Farm Road No. 729 12 miles west of Jefferson,
opposite the stone house of Mr. J. H. Chatham. It
was Mr. Chatham who originally showed the site to
a River Basin Surveys reconnaissance party. It is
difficult to locate the spot precisely on a map because of dense forest and a lack of distinctive topographic features, but a location of 32º46’26” N,

The site number 29A6-2 follows the quadrangle system of
site designation which has been used at The University of
Texas for about 20 years. This system is now being replaced
by a trinomial county system like that in wide use in the
United States. According to this latter system, the Whelan
site is numbered 41MR2, with 41 standing for Texas in the
alphabetical series of 48 states, MR for Marion County, and 2
for the second site listed in the county.

14

94º33’47” W would certainly be within the site area
(U.S. Corps of Engineers 1949–50).
The site lay at the edge of an intricate system
of sloughs which constituted former channels of
Cypress Creek. The creek itself ran in a channel
about 200 yards south of the site. During spring
rains the whole system of channels was under water,
and this was the situation during most of our digging. The site was as close to the creek as normal
high water would allow, and might well have been
directly on the creek at the time of occupation.
In this part of the valley the floodplain extends about a mile north from the creek before the
land rises to the uplands. Some of the floodplain is
relatively level, but there are frequent sandy ridges
as much as 10 feet high. The site itself is at the
inner edge of the floodplain on a broad low elevation, not more than 2 feet above the rest of the
floodplain but enough to keep it fairly dry when
the rest of the bottoms are muddy with spring
rains, and just enough so that it is not quite inundated by the Conservation Pool.
This location is subject to major flooding relatively frequently—at least once a decade, to judge
from recent history—so that it cannot be considered ideal as a habitation site, and may have been
chosen for other reasons, a possibility which will be
examined in the final section of this report.
The site was first recorded on February 9,
1951, by E. O. Miller and E. H. Moorman, on their
original survey of the Ferrell's Bridge reservoir area
for the Austin office of River Basin Surveys. They
were guided to the site by Mr. J. H. Chatham, who
lives about 1 mile north on the highway. Because
of the dense woods and maze of old logging roads
it took an intimate knowledge of the land to find
the site. Miller and Moorman inspected the site and
made a small test (no longer visible in 1957) in
Mound B and “at about 2½ feet found 2 potsherds
and a quantity of charcoal.” They gave each mound
a separate site number: Mound A was 29A6-2,
Mound B was 29A6-4, and Mound C was 29A6-3
(Miller-Moorman journal and field notes, on file at
The University of Texas, Department of Anthropology). They did not see Mound D, which was first
noted by the present writer in 1957. In the survey
report on this work (River Basin Surveys 1951) the
three mounds are grouped as one site, 29A6-2,
and at the time the county site designation system

The Whelan Site, A Late Caddoan Component

was adopted at The University of Texas in 1957,
the designation was changed to 41MR2.
Construction of the Ferrell's Bridge Dam necessitated the carrying out of archeological salvage
work in the reservoir area. E. B. Jelks and I visited
the site in October, 1956, again guided through the
woods by Mr. Chatham. Shortly afterward the clearing crews came through this area, removing the
forest from the area to be flooded. Fortunately
they bypassed the Whelan site, and the main effect
of their work was to open up the bottoms so that
a guide was no longer needed to find the way.
Excavation of the site began late in January 1957,
as described later.
In its original appearance the site appeared as
four low mounds, three of them (Mounds A, B, and
C) arranged roughly in an east-northeast—westsouthwest line and the fourth (Mound D) some
distance away to the northwest (Figure 2). Mound
A was the largest, being about 5 feet high and 65
feet in diameter. Mound B, 365 feet N. 78ºE of
Mound A, was the smallest, being about 2.75 feet
high and about 50 feet in diameter. Mound C was
220 feet N. 66ºE from Mound B, and was intermediate in size between Mounds A and B. Mound D
was about the same size as Mound C, and lay 450
feet N. 30ºW of Mound A. Mounds A and C were at
the edge of a slough, and Mound D was near the
edge. Faint traces of borrow pits were to be seen at
the south and southeast edges of Mound A and on
the north and east margins of Mound B.
The site was covered by dense brush and a
stand of trees up to about 40 years old. It had
never been under cultivation. Its original condition
has been affected—and that very little—by flooding and erosion, pot hunting, and logging. Flooding seems to have affected the site hardly at all,
the amount of sedimentation since aboriginal times
apparently having been insignificant. There were,
however, some evidences of minor erosion in the
form of small gullies at the edge of the slough. The
heavy vegetation prevented any appreciable erosion, and evidence of much washing of the mounds
consisted only of the fact that the borrow pits were
almost entirely filled. As for pot-hunting, there were
a few holes in the mounds, but the disturbances
were minor. Local men tell of having done a little
digging here in their boyhood days when they were
fishing along the creek. The logging of this area

E. Mott Davis

early in the present century also seems to have
disturbed the site very little. A further stroke of
good fortune lay in the fact, already mentioned,
that reservoir plans called for leaving this part of
the reservoir area in woods, so that the site was
spared the destructive effects of mechanical forest
removal.
SUMMARY OF WORK ACCOMPLISHED
When we first began work at the Whelan site,
late in January, 1957, the complete absence of
cultural material on the surface left some doubt as
to whether the mounds were cultural or natural
features; in other words, we were not sure whether
we actually had an Indian site or not. Such doubts
were laid to rest as soon as the digging began,
since sherds were found in numbers from the start.
All the work was done in the area of Mounds
A and B. A stake was placed in the topographic
center of Mound A and called N200/E200. The origin of the grid was thereby in the slough and beyond the reaches of the site, and all of the site was
believed to be in the northeast quadrant of the
grid. (Actually, Mound D turned out to be in the
northwest quadrant; but no work was done there.)
The grid was oriented on magnetic North. The top
of stake N200/E200 was arbitrarily called 100 feet
above site datum, the top of Mound A being about
0.3 feet lower.
Initially, lines were run north and south on
line E200, and east and west on line N200. As
needed, additional stakes were put in at 10 foot
grid points. In the excavations, squares were named
by the grid designation of the southeast corner.
The first excavation was a 10-foot square in
the northwest quadrant of the center of Mound A,
square N200/E200. This square was dug about 5
feet deep, and it was seen that there were at least
two super-imposed fills within the mound, an upper uniform brown fill and a lower mixed and stratified fill, with some burning evident at the contact
of the two fills about 2.5 feet below the surface.
Both fills contained cultural material, the upper fill
being so rich in sherds that it seemed certain a
village midden must be nearby, some of which had
gone into the construction of the mound.
The next step was the testing of the mound
vicinity, looking for a midden and occupation area.
15

The Whelan Site, A Late Caddoan Component

A test pit 5 feet square was dug every 50 feet
along the N200 line eastward from Mound A to
E600. This line ran past Mound B, about 70 feet
south of that mound, and the easternmost test pit
was southeast of the mound. Some cultural material was found as far east as about E300, but farther east than that the tests were nearly sterile.
Another series of tests was dug south from Mound
A on line E200 as far south as N50, that being at
the edge of the slough. Some sherds were found
south to N130, but the pits at N100 and N50 were
nearly sterile. The borrow pit for Mound A appeared
clearly in the profile when the test pits were extended to make a trench at the southern flank of
the mound.
Following this work, a grid of test pits every
50 feet was dug in the area around the mound.
The northern and southern limits of this testing
were at N100 and N300, and the eastern and western limits were at E100 and E300. This testing
showed that although a little cultural material was
to be found nearly everywhere, enough material to
indicate direct occupation was present only in the
area immediately east and southeast of the mound
and no farther than 110 feet distant. Near N200/
E260 post molds appeared. At N150/E300 potsherds and other debris were particularly abundant.
Accordingly, this area southeast and east of
the mound was cleared of timber and undergrowth—
no small task—and the excavations were enlarged.
The post molds near N200/E260 were found to
represent the posts of a small circular structure,
perhaps a granary, called here Structure I. The rich
midden area around N150/E300 turned out to be
within a circular structure about 26 feet in diameter, presumably a house, called here Structure II.
Meanwhile the investigation of Mound A continued. There was evidence that the first test, described earlier, had gone through a floor at the
contact of the upper brown fill and the lower mixed
fill. The southeast quadrant of the center of the
mound, ten-foot-square N190/E210, was thereupon opened, and at a depth of about 2.5 feet a
poorly defined floor was found, with a heavily
burned area at the center of the mound. Eventually, as described in more detail later, remains of
three and perhaps four superimposed circular structures and a series of superimposed central fire-

E. Mott Davis

places, many of which were underlain by centerpost molds, came to light within the mound. The
situation was much disturbed and stratigraphically
very complex, and many details were beyond recovery. In the course of the work in Mound A, two
10-foot squares were dug well into the sub-mound
fill and traces of a possible pre-ceramic occupation
were found.
Mound B, 360 feet east and 70 feet north of
Mound A, was also investigated. Three 5-footsquare test pits were dug in the vicinity of the
mound, but all proved nearly or entirely sterile. An
east-west trench 5 feet wide was dug across the
mound on line N270. When cultural material was
found in the center of the mound, an area 20 feet
square was opened. A fireplace was found in the
center of the mound, as well as some potsherds,
but otherwise the mound was sterile. These evidences are described in more detail later.
All this work was done between January 21
and April 2, 1957. On August 5 through August 8
the writer and Miles Richardson cut a series of profiles in the northeast quadrant of Mound A, in square
N200/E210, in order to learn more about the stratigraphic relationships of the several structures within
the mound. This was the final work at the site. It
had been planned to spend time later mapping,
looking for burials (none having been found), and
testing the remaining two mounds, but heavy rains
in the autumn of 1957 filled the lake prematurely
and the site was inaccessible after October 15.
TECHNIQUES OF INVESTIGATION
Excavation was done for the most part in terms
of squares either 5 feet or 10 feet on a side, and
some 5-x-10-foot excavations were dug. In every
case the excavation was designated by the grid
point at its southeast corner, and the dimensions
of the excavation recorded to make clear the area
under investigation. The digging was done in terms
of arbitrary 0.5-foot levels. At no point was stratigraphic differentiation clear enough to warrant digging in terms of strata, although changes within
each 0.5-foot level were noted and it is readily
possible from the notes to distinguish the strata
and separate the cultural material accordingly.
Normally each level of a 10-foot square was
dug by fourths, that is by a 5-foot square at a time,
17

E. Mott Davis

so that the documentation of the sherds could
thereby be more precise. The notes and drawings
were in terms of whole 10-foot squares.
For the most part, digging was done with
square-ended shovels, which work efficiently and
neatly in the East Texas sand. In most areas the
earth was passed through a half-inch screen; but
not all the area was screened. With the completion
of each level, the floor was scraped with trowels
and all features recorded. If probable post molds
appeared, they were sectioned vertically before the
next level was dug and a note made as to whether
the feature was a post mold or more likely a root
stain or old rodent hole. An attempt was made to
draw profiles every 10 feet within the area excavated, but this aim was not entirely fulfilled.
Within Mound A, the work was usually carried
on in terms of the same 10-foot squares as elsewhere, and as a rule the 0.5-foot levels were maintained. But these arbitrary restrictions were often
modified for the study and interpretation of special
features such as post-mold patterns.
A transit was used in setting up the grid, which,
as already described, was oriented on magnetic
north and based on the center of Mound A as N200/
E200. Horizontal measurements were usually made
at right angles from grid lines or from walls of
excavations. These measurements from walls were
of course not always precise with regard to the
grid, because of inevitable minor irregularities in
the walls, and an attempt to offset this factor was
made by frequent direct grid-line check. Nevertheless, the measurement-from-wall method is subject to some error and is not recommended for
precise work. Its only advantage is in its speed, a
factor which looms large when the shovels are
moving faster than the documentation. In any case,
all critical measurements were made either directly
from grid lines or in terms of intersecting arcs; that
is, by measuring the distance of the feature from
two grid points with tape and plumb bob.
Vertical measurements, based on the top of
stake N200/E200 as 100 feet above arbitrary site
datum, were usually made by sighting with a hand
level from the nearest stake. No sights were made
more than 15 feet away by this method, and most
were less than 10 feet. At greater distances, level
sights were made with a transit, and the transit
was used to control elevations generally through18

The Whelan Site, A Late Caddoan Component

out the site.
The excavation record was made in separatenote form, individual record sheets being kept for
each level or feature. A general site journal was
also maintained. The record was supplemented with
numerous photographs, most of which were documented at the time they were taken.
FACTORS AFFECTING INVESTIGATION
There were two major factors influencing the
effectiveness of the investigation: vegetation and
weather.
When the work began, the site was covered
with a dense tangle of underbrush as mentioned
earlier, as well as with a stand of hardwood trees
up to about 2.5 feet in diameter and 60 feet tall. All
excavation work had to be preceded by clearing
this growth, surveying was seriously hampered by
it, and the excavations themselves were impeded
by roots and stumps. It was sometimes difficult to
make a wall or floor clean enough so that features
could be distinguished and recorded.
A further hindrance to the work was the rainfall, which increased in frequency and intensity as
the weeks went by. Fortunately the rain fell almost
entirely at night and on weekends, so work was
rarely actually halted; but certain key excavation
areas filled with water and remained full before
work in them was completed, and some excavation
walls slumped before being recorded, so that a few
archeological problems never were cleared up. In
addition, the road to the site became a morass and
occasionally considerable time was lost walking in
and out from the site. Just as work finished at the
beginning of April, 1957, the storms increased in
frequency and violence and the whole valley was
flooded. The site went under water, but re-emerged
later in the summer and was about 6 feet out of
water in September, at which time only the Conservation Pool was full. It was planned that further
work would be done in October, as mentioned earlier, but the rains began again and once more the
valley filled and the site went under water. It is to
be presumed that no further work can be done.
SOILS
The normal soil profile at the site was formed

The Whelan Site, A Late Caddoan Component

in sand with red clay at the bottom. A black humus
0.2-0.3 feet thick was everywhere the top zone.
The humus zone faded downward rather quickly
into a medium brown sand about 0.6 feet thick,
which in turn faded downward into a pale brown
sand, in places mottled with white. Where the underlying red clay was only 2-3 feet below the surface, as was the case in much of the area investigated, the pale brown sand became increasingly
stained with red clay as one went downward; but
the transition into the red clay itself was relatively
abrupt.
The top of the red clay subsoil was not level.
Over much of the site it was 2-3 feet below the
surface. Sixty feet east of Mound A it was only 1.6
feet deep. Beneath the mound itself we found only
gray clay—locally known as “post-oak clay”—although it may be presumed that with deeper digging we might have eventually found the red clay.
However, in a test pit 9 feet deep at N100/E300 no
red clay zone was encountered. Here the sand faded
from the dark humus to a pale brown, almost white
sand, in the first 6 feet below the surface; then
became increasingly mottled with red in the next 2
feet; and below that, for at least 1 foot, was pure
white sand.
In the midden area, that is within Structure II,
the top 1 foot of soil was a dark chocolate brown,
almost a purple-brown, easily distinguishable from
the medium brown and gray-brown of other areas.
Within the occupation area the cultural material occurred almost entirely within one foot of the
surface, in the humus and medium brown sand,
the finds being much less abundant below that.

MOUND A
Mound A was approximately 5 feet high and
65 feet in diameter (Figure 3). The top was slightly
flattened. The remains of a borrow pit a few inches
deep were visible on the south and southeast sides
at the foot of the mound. On the west side the
mound was directly against the precipitous edge of
a slough which was at one time a channel of Cypress Creek, and was in fact filled with water during much of the time we worked at the site.
A series of structures had been built on the
site of the mound, one after the other, and their

E. Mott Davis

manifestations intruded upon one another within
the mound to such an extent that proper interpretation of the sequence of events and the full nature
of the structures was most difficult to determine.
STRATIGRAPHIC ZONES
Three stratigraphic zones were distinguished
in the fill of Mound A. They are numbered from
bottom to top, but will be described here in the
reverse order. Reference is made to Figure 4 for a
profile through the mound showing the relationships of these zones.
Zone III
Zone III was the cap of the mound, a layer of
medium brown sand with the modern humus at
the surface. The zone was 2.5-3 feet thick on top
of the mound, depending on irregularities in the
surface. Erosion could have removed as much as a
foot more. On the flanks of the mound the zone
thinned and was 1.5-2 feet thick 20-30 feet from
the center where the zones blended into the normal soil profile.
Zone III was devoid of structural evidences
and represented a single final episode in the construction of the mound. It contained many sherds
and was clearly derived from the occupation fill to
the south and east of the mound. The builders of
the mound appear to have taken off a layer of
earth less than a foot thick from the area within 50
feet east and southeast of the mound, and to have
removed about 3 feet of earth from a borrow trench
9 feet wide at the southern edge of the mound.
This trench was only faintly perceptible on the surface, having been filled with wash from the mound;
but it showed up in the north-south profile on line
E200.
Zone II
Zone II was the structural and occupational
zone within the mound. It was a fill of stratified
sand and ashes about 1.2 feet thick, with
unconformities at top and bottom in most places.
It occupied a circular area about 18 feet in diameter at the center of the mound. As will be seen
later, this area corresponds to the area of the most

recent structures built on the mound. The top of
the zone was at 97 feet above datum (slightly higher
in the center) and represented the floor of the last
structure to be built here. In places charred wood
rested on this floor at the junction of Zones II and
III. The bottom of Zone II was at 95.8 feet, on the
original ground surface. In the center, and
stratigraphically a part of Zone II, was a hearth
area which consisted of a series of superimposed
fireplace basins and sub-fireplace post molds. The
bottom of the lowest basin was at 94.1 feet above
datum, and the lowest sub-fireplace post mold
extended down to 92.9 feet. These features will be
described in more detail later.
The fill within the many other post molds also
belonged to Zone II. Most of the deeper molds
(those of Houses C and D, to be described) extended down to about 92.9 feet. The deepest post
mold went down to 92.65 feet above datum.
Zone I
Zone I was the sub-mound earth. At the top,
immediately below Zone II, was a purplish humic
zone about 0.6 feet thick. Below that was 4 feet of
20

sand, medium brown at the top and becoming pale
brown downward. Just above 91 feet—the level of
our deepest excavation in the mound area—there
was a quick transition downward into pale gray
clay. This is locally called “post-oak clay” because
of its common occurrence in “post oak flats,” floodplain areas where post oaks grow.
As mentioned above, Zone I was penetrated
by a fire pit and numerous post molds from Zone
II.
Discussion
Each stratigraphic zone was separated from
the one above by an unconformity (except that in
one or two places the division between Zones II
and III was not sharp), and each represents a different part of the history of the site. Zone I, the
sub-mound fill, contained scattered sherds and flint,
the sherds becoming very infrequent, and in some
squares absent, in the deeper levels. It appears to
be typical floodplain fill, and the cultural material in
the deeper part may represent the remnants of
occasional Archaic occupation. The material in the
upper part of Zone I appears to represent the early

part of the main occupation of the site by Fulton
Aspect Caddoan people. The top of Zone I was the
surface of the ground before the mound was built.
Zone II represents an intentional accumulation of earth associated with the building and use
of structures by Caddoan people.
Zone III is a 3-foot-thick cap put on the
mound after the destruction of the latest structure.
There are no indications of more recent structures
on the top of the mound.
EVIDENCES OF STRUCTURES IN MOUND A
Many post molds were found in the course of
excavation of Mound A, arranged in circles around
the mound center. The circles represented the remains of structures built one after the other. The
number of structures represented is probably four,
but it could possibly be more or less than that
number because it was not possible to determine
the level of the tops of most of the post molds, nor
could the number of floors be distinguished in the
excavations. These and other difficulties will become apparent in the course of the description
which follows. In any case, evidence is reasonably
specific as to how the mound was built and used,
and the case for there having been four structures
(rather than some other number) is sufficiently
strong so that this presentation is best served if
the post molds are grouped under the headings of
Houses A, B, C, and D, from presumed latest to
presumed earliest. The term “House” is, of course,
arbitrary in this case, as the structures were in all
likelihood ceremonial rather than residential.
Most of the stratigraphic distinctions described
here were worked out in square N190/E210, the
southeast quadrant of the structures.
Houses A and B
Houses A and B were represented by a series
of post molds extending downward from the top
of Zone II. They could not be seen clearly in horizontal section, due to the mixed nature of the fill,
and in our initial test in the northwest quadrant we
removed a good many of them unknowingly, even
though we felt sure we were in a structure and
were looking for signs of molds. Once it became
clear that we had gone through the floor of a struc-

E. Mott Davis

ture and had destroyed a number of molds, we
moved to the southeast quadrant and began by
peeling in 0.5 foot layers until the top of Zone II
appeared at about 97 feet above datum. Then we
worked in from the outside, slicing a vertical face,
and were able to locate the post molds by finding
them in vertical section. Eventually this vertical face
was made 2 feet high, from 97 feet to 95 feet
above datum. When we cored the post molds (Figure 5) it became clear that most of them had two
fills, an upper and a lower. The only interpretation
that could feasibly be made of this situation was
that these molds represented post holes that had
been used twice. Later work in other squares revealed three cases where the upper and lower post
holes were clearly separated, supporting the case
for two different, sequent structures.
The task of determining how many post molds
belonged to which house had to be worked out
mainly in the laboratory, because mud, collapsing
walls, and the mixed condition of the mound fill
made it impossible to view the problem as a whole
in the field. As already stated, the main information
came from the southeast quadrant. In the southwest quadrant some major post-Zone II disturbance seems to have obliterated all but a very few
of the House A and House B post molds. In the
northwest quadrant the House A molds were destroyed in the original testing, and only the lower
parts of the House B molds were recorded. The
northeast quadrant was dug mainly by slicing a
vertical face, pivoting it around the center of the
mound, in order to unravel some of the confusion
of post molds. We were unable to identify many
House B molds here.
The mean diameter of House A was 17 feet,
and of House B, 19 feet. The post molds were
nearly all 0.5 feet in diameter, irregularly spaced
with the centers 1.4-1.8 feet apart. In a few cases
they were as close together as 1 foot and in a few
others as far apart as 2 feet. The floors of both
houses were at, or close to, 97 feet above datum—
the top of Zone II. The bottoms of the House A
post molds were at an average elevation of 95.6
feet above datum, making them 1.4 feet deep—
rather shallow for post holes of a Caddoan house.
Those of House B extended down to an average
elevation of 94.2 feet above datum, so that they
were about 2.8 feet deep, or about arm’s length.
23

E. Mott Davis

The Whelan Site, A Late Caddoan Component

It should be noted, in anticipation of later discussion, that the stratified fill of Zone II, made up of fireplace ashes and sand, was found only
within Houses A and B. Outside them,
Zone III rested directly on Zone I.
Houses C and D
These structures (or this structure, as only one structure may be
involved) were earlier than Houses A
and B, and appear to have been built
on the surface of the ground before
mound construction began. The post
molds began at the top of Zone I in
those cases where the tops could be
determined, and were an average of
2.8 feet in depth. The bottoms were
mostly between 92.9 feet and 93.1
feet above datum; one mold went
down to 92.65 feet, and one was at
93.25 feet. Average diameter of the
molds was about 0.5 feet.
In the southeast quadrant these
molds were grouped into two distinct arcs (Figure 6) but elsewhere
they were less easy to separate into
distinct patterns. In the northeast
quadrant, molds of the outer rings
are usually, but not always, deeper
than those of the inner ring, and in

the upper shelf can be seen the dark zone representing the top of Zone I, the original ground surface. The crossed strings are
on N195 and E205, and the arrow is 1 foot long.

THE HEARTH
The profile of the hearth area in the center of
Mound A showed a series of superimposed fireplace basins and sub-fireplace central post molds.
Figure 4 shows the fireplace sequence and part of
the most recent post mold, and Figure 7 shows the
post molds.
The phenomenon of a central fireplace with a
large post mold underneath it is a diagnostic
Caddoan trait, although not all Caddoan houses
manifest it. The feature results from the practice,
documented in Spanish chronicles (Swanton 1942,
150–151), of erecting a strong center post to serve
as a scaffold from the top of which the wall posts
could be bent inwards and their tips tied together.
Once this operation was completed, the center post
was taken out or cut down and the fireplace was
located in the same spot.
At least three such episodes of construction
are represented in the profiles shown in Figures 4

and 7. Three post molds are evident, and at least
three superimposed fireplaces. It should be noted
that in the field the number of fireplaces was not
clear and it was thought that there were more than
three; but a laboratory comparison of several drawings and photographs indicates a minimum of no
more than three. In addition a possible fourth post
mold is present, but the field notes state that the
nature of its fill suggests that it is probably an old
rodent hole.
The three stratigraphic units of the fireplace
area will be described in chronological sequence.
Fireplace 1 and Post Mold 1
Fireplace 1 consists of ashes lying on a zone
of baked earth. The fireplace is on the top of Zone
I, and has been scooped out to a depth of 0.3 feet,
so its bottom (the top of the baked earth) is at
95.5 feet above datum. Post Mold I is believed to
be associated with Fireplace 1, although the asso25

E. Mott Davis

Fireplace 2 and Post Mold 2
Fireplace 2 was scooped about
0.5 feet deep into the floor just mentioned, down to 96.1 feet above datum. It was filled with ashes. Post Mold
2 was probably associated with it
(again a later post mold intervened,
obscuring the relationship) since the
bottom of the post mold is at 93.6
feet above datum, 2.5 feet below the
bottom of the fireplace.
Fireplace 3 and Post Mold 3
Fireplace 3 was in a basin scooped
out of the ashes of Fireplace 2. Its
bottom was at 96.6 feet above datum, at which level it truncated Post
Mold 3 which extended down 2.7 feet,
to 93.6 feet above datum. The fireplace included several thin strata of
ash and burned earth. As far as can be
determined, Fireplace 3 was contemporaneous with the top of Zone II,
and it and Post Mold 3 probably belong to the final structure, House A.
Figure 7. Sub-fireplace central post molds in Mound A, vertically sectioned and
scribed (center of picture). Three post molds, the upper ones intruding into
the lower ones, are shown. The lower horizontal string is at 95 feet above
datum. At the left is what is probably an old tap root, possibly in a former
post mold.

ciation cannot be proven because of the intrusion
of later post molds. However, the bottom of the
post mold is at 92.9 feet above datum, or 2.6 feet
below the bottom of Fireplace 1, and this depth is
nearly as great as a post hole can be dug by hand,
even with the aid of a scoop. It is unlikely that Post
Mold 1 is related to a higher fireplace.
Ashes appear to have accumulated in Fireplace 1 and to have spread—mixed with dirt—over
the surrounding floor until the floor was at about
96.7 feet above datum, or 0.9 feet above its original level. It was not possible to tell in the profiles
just what the elevation of this higher floor (into
which the basin of Fireplace 2 was dug) was, and
an error of 0.2 feet either way is quite possible.
26

DISCUSSION

Because of the intrusion of later
features into earlier ones, it appeared
in the field that evidence for some of
the construction episodes in the fireplace area had probably been lost, a supposition
strengthened by the evidence for four houses in
the post hole patterns. Subsequent analysis of the
data does not rule out this possibility by any means;
but still there is no good evidence in the fireplace
itself for more than three structures.
Fireplace 1 and Post Mold 1 are believed to
belong to House D, since they are the earliest features and are on the surface of Zone I. Fireplace 3
and Post Mold 3 are assigned to House A since
they represent the final construction and are at the
top of Zone II. Fireplace 2 and Post Mold 2 are
probably to be correlated with House B, since they
are at or near the top of Zone II but are earlier than
the final construction.

The Whelan Site, A Late Caddoan Component

With these correlations we have mentioned
all the fireplaces and central post molds but are left
with House C unaccounted for. It is possible that
Houses C and D represent, in actuality, only one
house with two concentric rings of post molds. In
such a case the instances of one post mold intruding into another, cited earlier as evidence for two
separate, sequent structures, might represent repair work on one structure which, as indicated by
the accumulation of ashes and dirt on the floor,
was used for a long time. There seems no way to
determine this matter on the evidence available.
Our minimal history of the mound is, then, as
follows: a house (House D and possibly House C as
part of it) was built at ground level and used for a
long enough time for about a foot of ashes and dirt
to accumulate on the floor. Then a new house,
House B, was built at the higher level. Finally House
A was built, and its destruction was accompanied
by some burning. Eventually the cap of the mound,
Zone III, was added over the remains of House A.
A feature which has not been mentioned pertains to a peculiar soil feature associated with some
of the post molds of House A. The soil discoloration associated with a few of these molds extended
radially outward (i.e., away from the center of the
structure) from the mold proper for a distance of a
little over 1.5 feet, almost as if the posts had been
placed at the inner end of a radial slot. The “slots”
were not sharply defined in every case. We were
unable to determine why they were there. It is
hoped that other excavations may turn up a similar
phenomenon under circumstances more susceptible of interpretation.

brown sand and diminishing below it, supports the
idea that the surface at the time of the digging of
the post molds was at the bottom of the medium
brown sand.
Eighteen of the post molds were not seen
until skimming progressed to the top of the red
clay, in which all the molds appeared as distinct
gray sandy circles.
The 22 molds formed a rough circle about 10
feet in diameter (Figure 8). They varied in size
from 0.45-0.6 feet in diameter, most of them being
0.5 feet across. We were not able to determine
their depths because of flooding of the excavation.
The circle of molds was evidently laid out by eye,
since it was far from perfect. The situation can best
be described in terms of a circle 9.9 feet in diameter with its center at N193.85/E258.55. The centers of the molds lay as much as 0.25 feet inside or
outside of this circle. Two molds lay on the circle,
14 lay inside it, and six lay outside. Average spacing of the molds was 1.4 feet apart, center to center, and this was also the approximate mode. The
maximum was 1.6 feet and the minimum was 1.05
feet. There were no gaps in the pattern.
No structural features were found within the
circle. This fact, together with the absence of an
entrance gap and the small size of the circle, makes
it seem likely that these molds represent the foundation of an elevated structure designed for some
purpose other than residence. Historic Caddos are
known to have used elevated granaries (Swanton
1942, 148, quoting Joutel; also see frontispiece in
Bolton 1915) and it seems likely that this structure
was something of the sort.

STRUCTURE I

STRUCTURE II

Structure I, called Feature 320 in the field,
was a circular pattern of post molds 60 feet east of
the center of Mound A (Figure 8). In this area the
soil showed the normal profile described earlier.
The red clay was only 1.5-2.0 feet below the surface. Only four of the 22 post molds in Structure I
could be seen in the sand above the underlying red
clay. They appeared to have been dug from a surface about 1 foot below the present surface, at the
bottom of the medium brown sand. The distribution of sherds, which were frequent in the medium

Structure II, called Feature 483 in the field,
was a circular pattern of post molds about 26 feet
in diameter, with a central fireplace and a sub-fireplace post mold (Figure 9). It was about 100 feet
east-southeast of the center of Mound A.
Most of the post molds of Structure II did not
show up until the excavation was carried about 3
feet below the surface, or (as discussed below) 2
feet below the probable level of the house floor. It
was most difficult to detect the post molds or to
distinguish them from root stains and filled rodent

holes. The method of digging, described in detail
earlier, involved plotting all circular stains as each
level was cleaned, and sectioning each stain vertically in order to make a guess (it was only a guess,
even with this technique) as to whether it represented a post mold. By this means, after digging
three 10-foot squares to 93.5 feet above datum—
the surface being at or slightly below 96 feet—we
were able to plot enough probable molds to gain a
rough idea of the size and shape of the structure
and to govern further excavation accordingly. In
two squares, we were also able to see a poorly
defined zone of transition between the chocolatebrown house fill and the brown sub-humus sand
outside the house; and this zone of transition, presumably representing the edge of the house floor,
showed up best at 95 feet above datum. Finally, we
scraped the floor clean at 93 feet above datum
(93.5 feet in some squares) and found an incomplete circle of 43 post molds, most of which had
not been detected earlier. Later analysis of the excavation notes added ten more post molds which
filled most of the gaps in the circle.
The pattern (Figure 9) does not form a perfect circle, the radii from the central post mold—
which was at N150/E294.4—being as follows: north,
12 feet; east, 13 feet; south, 15 feet; west, 13 feet.
Thus the north-south diameter was 27 feet and
the east-west diameter 26 feet.
There are extra post molds at several places,
especially on the east side of the circle. They may
represent furniture posts, or may even indicate that
two houses are represented. The latter possibility
is strengthened by an instance in which one post
mold intersects another in the northeast quadrant.
Our difficulties in finding the post molds make
it likely that a number were missed entirely. Field
exigencies also prevented us from completing the
investigation of the house pattern, so that we were
never able to determine the depths of the post
molds or to make a special search for an
entranceway. Gaps are to be observed in the southwest, southeast, and north parts of the circle, and
at least one of these must have represented an
entrance. The others may only be places where
post molds were present but were not detected.
There was no distinct floor level, but the soil
immediately below the humus within the structure
was stained a rich chocolate-brown (in contrast to
30

The Whelan Site, A Late Caddoan Component

the medium brown color found elsewhere) to a
depth of approximately 1 foot below the surface,
and the transition to the underlying brown sand
was sudden, although not an unconformity. Cultural material—sherds, bone fragments, occasional
flint chips and artifacts—was abundant in this chocolate-brown zone and diminished in frequency below it. Presumably, then, there was a floor at or
near the bottom of the chocolate-brown zone, at
about 95 feet above datum, or 1 foot below the
surface.
The bottom of the chocolate-brown zone,
which may have been the house floor, was not
level. The profiles drawn on grid lines in the house
area show numerous dips and what appear to have
been pits. These pits did not show distinctly in the
floors of the excavations as the digging progressed
level by level, but two pits were clear. They are
shown in Figure 9. Both were about 2 feet in diameter and 1.7 feet deep, and contained carbonstained fill and sherds. The northern one held a
number of broken animal bones. It may be presumed that they were refuse pits.
A number of dips in the floor may have been
shallow post holes but were not certainly so. Two
which almost certainly were aboriginal post molds
are shown on the plan.
The central fireplace was a poorly defined,
irregular area of baked and carbon-stained earth.
In maximum dimensions it was about 4 feet eastwest and 5 feet north-south. There was no evidence of intentional preparation of a hearth.
Underneath the baked earth of the fireplace
was a central post mold approximately 0.5 feet in
diameter. Its center was at N150/E294.4. The
records suggest that there may have been two such
molds, since photographs seem to show another
post mold 0.7 feet east-southeast of the first, with
its center at N150/E195. If there were two central
post molds, there must have been two houses. In
view of the total evidence, however, it is more likely
that there was only one house.
In summary, Structure II was a circular house
about 26 feet in diameter with an unprepared central fireplace and a post mold (or possibly two post
molds) under the fireplace. The position of the
entrance is not known. The refuse pits within the
house and the abundance of cultural material in
the fill make it certain that this was a residential,

The Whelan Site, A Late Caddoan Component

not a purely ceremonial, structure.

MOUND B
Mound B was a small mound approximately
2.5 feet high and 50-55 feet in diameter. Its center
was at N270/E560, 360 feet east and 70 feet north
of the center of Mound A. A slight depression immediately east and north of the mound probably
represented a borrow pit.
Three test pits were dug in the immediate
vicinity of the mound, on the southwest, southeast, and north sides. They were almost devoid of
cultural material. An east-west trench 5 feet wide
was dug across the center of the mound on the
north side of line N270, going at least 1.5 feet
below the original ground surface. Later it was expanded to 20 feet wide at the center of the mound.
Within the mound a hearth area was found.
In the center was a fireplace, a heavily burned area
approximately 2.5 feet in diameter, its center being
at N275.3/E561. It was seen first at the level 95.5
feet above datum, in other words 1.25 feet below
the top of the mound and about 1 foot above the
surrounding ground level. The heavy carbonization
and baking of the earth was most pronounced at
95.9–94.5 feet above datum, and continued down
to about 94 feet, 1.5 feet below its highest point.
There was no evidence of successive superimposed
fireplaces, and it is believed that the deep baking
resulted from one fireplace.
Surrounding the fireplace was a poorly defined carbon-stained area about 10 feet in northsouth diameter and 8 feet in east-west diameter. In
this larger area were found sherds, broken animal
bones, pieces of daub, and sandstone fragments,
to a depth of more than 1.5 feet below the level of
the top of the fireplace. A few pieces were found all
the way to the bottom of the excavation at 92.5
feet above datum, 3 feet below the top of the
fireplace and 2 feet below the surrounding ground
level.
No post molds or other structural evidences
(aside from the fireplace) were found within Mound

and random cultural material found in the center of
the mound, the fill was uniform, and much like that

of the natural “pimple mounds” that are common
in this region. The cultural significance of Mound B
remains a mystery.

ANALYSIS OF THE ARTIFACTS:
GENERAL REMARKS
More than 15,000 artifacts were found during
the work at the Whelan site. Most of them were
body sherds, plain or brushed; but numerous items
of pottery and stone were found that could be
treated typologically in some detail. Pressure of
subsequent work at the Ferrell's Bridge Reservoir
has limited study of the Whelan artifacts to classification, and the task of detailed tabulation for
purposes of stratigraphic analysis is only beginning. It is unlikely, however, that any major new
discoveries will result from this tabulation, since all
evidences are that the materials (aside from scattered possible Archaic evidences) represent a single
late Caddoan occupation during which no significant changes took place.
The following discussion, then, is primarily
descriptive in intent. Where specimen counts are
given, they are for the purpose of indicating frequency relative to other categories discussed, rather
than being presented for purposes of working up
overall percentage tables.

POLISHED STONE
One piece of polished stone work came from
the site, a fragment of a perforated gorget of black
slate (Figure 10, B). It was found in Zone III on
the east side of Mound A. If the complete specimen was symmetrical it was bi-lobed—something
like a dumbbell—with two holes drilled on the longitudinal axis. Reconstructed dimensions, which are
probably correct to 5 mm. if the complete specimen was symmetrical, are 86 mm. maximum length
and 71 mm. maximum width. The thickness is 6
mm. The specimen is well made and carefully polished. The holes were drilled from both sides and
are biconical in section. They are 10 mm. in diameter at the surface and 4 mm. in diameter at the
narrowest point.

CHIPPED STONE
The number of artifacts of chipped stone was
relatively small compared to the amount found in
many sites. Total identified specimens were 98, of
which 60 were dart points and ten were arrowpoints.
Preliminary analysis by stratigraphic zone, as reported below, gives no indication of typological
change with the passage of time. Materials used
were flints, cherts, quartzite and petrified wood
from Arkansas, and a small amount of yellow and
red jasper from local gravels.
Small Waste Cores
These specimens were observed in the course
of sorting the stone materials. A good many probably were discarded before it was realized that they
were artifacts. They are small nodules from local
gravels, usually of yellow or orange jasper, with
several flakes struck from them, and some of the
cortex remaining. The total number is in excess of
20. Their function is unknown.
Small Core Choppers
(Figure 10, E-H)
There were 12 of these specimens, ranging in
length from 36 mm. to 51 mm., the mode being
about 40 mm. In thickness the extremes are 11
mm. and 17 mm., the mode being about 15 mm.
They are percussion flaked so as to have an edge
all around or nearly all around. The outline is usually irregular, but there is a point, or an attempt at
one, at one end, and on most of the specimens
that end shows signs of use. In a few cases there
are no evident signs of use. One specimen from
the humus on the south side of Mound A has a
sharp, narrow point, and may have been used as a
drill (Figure 10, H).

above. Some are asymmetrical and almost certainly
were knives (Figure 10, I-K). Others, more slender
and pointed, and in some cases with crude stems,
descriptively are more appropriately called crude
points (Figure 10, L, M). Some are made from large
flakes, others from small cores. Lengths of complete specimens are from 40-55 mm., the mode
being about 50 mm.; thicknesses are from 5-13
mm., no mode being evident. Materials are petrified wood and purple quartzite.
Large Points – “Pogo Points”
(Figure 10, C, D)
There are two large points in the collection.
One (Figure 10, D) is a complete specimen found
in Structure II. It was made from a large flake of
bluish Arkansas novaculite and is well worked with
flat primary flake scars and good pressure flaking
at the edge. There are a few large primary scars
near the base, and a very deep one on one face
which has thinned the point more than seems best
for its strength. In outline it is like a Gary point,
and is one of the forms included under the rubric
“Pogo Points” by Shum et al. (1954, 398–399).
Maximum dimensions are: length, 103 mm.; width,
54 mm.; thickness, 11 mm.
The other spear point (Figure 10, C) is a basal
fragment of a crude point with slender contracting
stem and one flaring rounded barb. It also falls
into the varied Pogo Point category. It was found
in the humus on the southwest side of Mound A.
Crude, Irregular Dart Points
Five crude dart points are made from flakes.
All but one are quite nondescript. In length they
vary from 22-37 mm. One, from Zone 1, the submound fill, below the south edge of Mound A, was
deeper than the occurrence of pottery in that area.
It is a crude thick wide specimen with a pointed
stem and one shoulder.

Knives and Crude Points
(Figure 10, I-M)

Triangular Dart Points

There are 14 of these specimens, of which
nine are probably knives and five either knives or
crude dart points. These specimens are thinner and
better made than the core choppers described

There are five triangular dart points which
conform descriptively to the general CatánMatamoros style of the lower Rio Grande Valley
(Suhm et al. 1954, 410–411, 448–449). The his33

torical significance of this resemblance is problematical, and in view of the small number of these
points at the Whelan site, may be more coincidental than otherwise.
Four of the specimens are simple triangles,
the bases being convex or slightly so. The other
(from Zone III, the cap of Mound A) is alternately
beveled to the left.
Two of the specimens are crudely made. They
are 28 and 32 mm. long. The other three are 36,
37, and 38 mm. long. Widths range from 21-25
mm. and thicknesses from 5-7 mm.
Gary Points
(Figure 10, N-V)
Thirty-two specimens are classed as Gary
points. They vary considerably in size and shape.
The range is from “Gary Typical” to “Gary Small”
(Ford and Webb 1956, 52 and Fig. 17), the smallest ones (Figure 10, U, V) being even smaller than
the “Gary Small” specimens illustrated by Ford and
Webb. Stems vary from characteristic Gary tapering stems to specimens with almost straight stems
and barbs, resembling Carrollton points (Figure 10,
S). There are four specimens of “Gary Small,” but
the dividing line between them and larger specimens is not sharp. All categories of Gary points—
Typical, Small, and straight-stemmed—come from
all stratigraphic units in the site, but the small ones
were all found with pottery, whereas two of the
Typical Gary points and one straight-stemmed specimen came from deeper than the occurrence of
pottery.
The size range of these points is from 25 mm.
to 54 mm. long, with one small reworked specimen
only 20 mm. long. Materials used are a little yellow
and reddish jasper, presumably from local gravels,
and quartzite, chert, and petrified wood from Arkansas.
Dart Points, Squared Stem
(Figure 11, A, B)
There are four dart points with squared stems.
Three are most like the Kent Points of Suhm et al.
(1954, 432–433). They are all from Zone III, the
cap of Mound A. The fourth (Figure 11, B) is more
like a Yarbrough point (Suhm et al. 1954, 492–
34

493). It came from Zone I, the sub-mound fill,
below the south side of Mound A, associated with
a few sherds. The only complete specimen of these
four is 38 mm. long. The others were longer.
Dart Points with Expanded Stems
(Figure 11, C-G)
There are five of these specimens. Two have
wide stems with straight bases and fit descriptively
into the Ellis Point category (Figure 11, C, D; Suhm
et al. 1954, 420–421). Three have narrow stems
with convex bases (Figure 11, E-G) and might be
classed as “Palmillas-like’” but, as defined, Palmillas
appears really to be a stem category rather than a
point category (Suhm et al. 1954, 463–464), and
hence little cultural-historical significance can be
attached to the appearance of these points from
the Whelan site. One of the three specimens is not
unlike a Trinity point.
Dart Points, Fragments
There are nine tips of large- to medium-sized
dart points, one slender-stemmed point which might
be a Gary point but the stem is broken just enough
to make the classification obscure, and one fragment of what may be the stem of a Gary point.
Arrowpoint: Perdiz
(Figure 11, I)
One broken arrowpoint is almost certainly a
Perdiz point, but the identification cannot be positive. It was found at the east edge of Mound A, in
the pale sand just above the red clay, associated
with a few sherds. It is made of gray chert.
Arrowpoint: Friley
(Figure 11, J)
This specimen is from the cap of Mound AZone III, or possibly Zone II. It is a stemmed point
with slightly recurved barbs. This is a variant of
Alba points which occurs in parts of East Texas and
Louisiana.

There are three very small points in this category. The smallest (Figure 11, K) is 14 mm. long
and has recurved barbs like the Friley point. It is
from Zone III, the cap of Mound A. The other two
specimens are broken. They are simple barbed
points. Both are from Zone I, the submound fill
under Mound A, associated with a few sherds.
Arrowpoint: Expanding Stem
(Figure 11, N)
This specimen has serrated edges and is much

like a Scallorn or Eddy point (Suhm et al. 1954,
506–507; Suhm 1957, 36). It is 21 mm. long and
12 mm. wide. It was found in Mound A, in a situation which was either the bottom of Zone II or the
top of Zone I.
Arrowpoints: Hayes
(Figure 11, O, P)
A classic Hayes point of yellow jasper (Figure
11, P) was found in the southwest part of Mound
A. The stratification at this place was not clear, but
35

E. Mott Davis

the point appears to have come from Zone I, the
sub-mound fill, and was associated with a few
sherds. Its dimensions are 41 x 21 x 3 mm. Another specimen (Figure 11, O) may be a small broken Hayes point. It is from the humus on the south
side of Mound A.
Arrowpoints: Miscellaneous
There are two miscellaneous arrowpoints in
the collection: first, a broken flake worked to make
a crude triangle, possibly intended to be a point,
which came from Zone III on the south side of
Mound A; second, a small thick point, very crude,
with a square base (Figure 11, H), which came
from approximately 3 feet below the surface in
pale sandy silt, in test pit N100/E250.
DISCUSSION OF STONE TOOLS
The major fact of significance of the stone
tools from the Whelan site is that they are not
unusual for a late Caddoan site. They also bear out
the hypothesis that only one ceramic occupation is
indicated, since several different point types are
represented in all zones in the mound, Mound A. A
few Gary points were found deeper than pottery,
and they represent the total indication of possible
Archaic occupation at the site.
Gary and Ellis points are mentioned by Suhm
et al. as occurring on the surface of Titus Focus
sites, their association with Titus Focus being unproven (Suhm et al. 1954, 193). At Whelan, a site
with numerous Titus Focus traits, these points definitely are in the same deposits with specimens representing those traits.
The Hayes point, belonging as it does to a
late Gibson Aspect type (Suhm et al. 1954, 502–
503), is an anomaly in this Fulton Aspect site. Possibly it is significant that this point occurred relatively deep in the fill of Mound A.

THE SHERD COLLECTION
Approximately 15,000 sherds were found in
the work at the Whelan site. There were no complete vessels, and no restorable vessels. It may be
36

The Whelan Site, A Late Caddoan Component

assumed that this circumstance was due to our not
having found any burials.
GENERAL DESCRIPTION
The pottery ware is not unusual, being quite
characteristic of Caddoan pottery in general. Most
sherds are from 5-7 mm. in thickness, the range
being 3-9 mm. with a few exceptional pieces being
thicker. Colors range from pale brown to gray and
black. Often the paste is evenly colored throughout, but at times there is a dark core with lighter
exterior and interior. Firing clouds are common. In
texture, the paste is quite variable, but in general it
is medium to fine. Temper is predominantly grit
and sand, with a small but significant percentage
of sherds which are bone-tempered. Nearly all sherds
are smoothed and a few are burnished. The tempering material sometimes shows at the surface,
particularly if it is bone.
An estimated four-fifths of the collection is
divided about equally between plain and brushed
sherds without decoration.
PLAIN SHERDS
Plain sherds make up about two-fifths of the
total sherd collection. At least four-fifths of the
plain sherds are body sherds, about which little can
be said by way of preliminary analysis beyond the
general description of the pottery already given.
Plain Rims
There are 211 undecorated rim sherds in the
collection. Nearly all of them represent straight
expanding rims or flaring rims, with rounded lips. A
few rims appear to be vertical.
Of the 211 sherds, 92 have simple, direct lips
and an equal number have lips which are thickened
by having been rolled outward slightly. Four specimens have a sharp angle at the lip, with the lip
scalloped. Twelve of the simple-lip sherds have flat,
squared lips. Five sherds are large enough to show
that they come from two relatively small vessels
which are shouldered, with pronouncedly flaring
rims. Two sherds, from one vessel, show a slight
carination. In a few cases of thickened rims, the lip
is beveled outward.

The Whelan Site, A Late Caddoan Component

Miscellaneous Plainware Items
Noted in Reconstruction Work
These items stood out in the course of working over the collection.
Carinated Bowls
One large carinated bowl was partially reconstructed. The rim is 46 mm. high. The lip is slightly
rolled out. Reconstructed diameter is 360 mm. A
second carinated rim is of redware and shows horizontal burnishing marks. A third partial vessel is of
gray ware, with the rim 42 mm. high.

base. The thickness of the base sherds ranges from
8-13 mm. One specimen has a perforation drilled
through from the two surfaces. The hole is 18 mm.
in diameter at the surfaces and 7 mm. in diameter
at the narrowest point. Another sherd has a cylindrical hole, not tapered, 17 mm. in diameter. Two
other specimens show perforations, always in the
approximate center of the specimen.
Red Filmed Plain Sherds
These specimens are discussed later under
“Engraved Sherds.”
BRUSHED SHERDS

Globular Vessel
This is a fragment of quite thin and delicate
ware. The nature of the complete vessel could not
be determined.
Flared Vessel
A cylindrical slightly flared vessel, like a flowerpot, is rather crudely made. The bottom and rim
are missing. Extant height is 90 mm., and estimated diameter at the base is 140 mm.
Peaked Rim
Part of a carinated vessel of large diameter
shows that the complete vessel had six or seven
peaks on the rim. A line is incised on the rim exterior just below the lip, and two others are spaced
15 mm. apart below it.
Black Sherd
One black burnished sherd shows part of a
perforation 2 mm. in diameter.
Base Sherds
There are 65 base sherds. These specimens
are circular flat pieces, or fragments thereof, which
may have come from vessels of any of the categories, decorated or plain, described herein. They are
from 80-90 mm. in diameter. There are also some
smaller fragments showing the angle of side and

Brushed sherds constitute as large a group as
plain sherds. Most are body sherds. The brushing
is mostly random, and roughly parallel; the brushing elements being of no consistent thickness.
The distinction made here between brushing,
trailing, and incising is that brushing is done with a
brush, i.e., with elements bound together, whereas
trailing and incising are done with an individual
tool. In incising, the tool is pointed, so that the
mark is V-shaped in cross-section. In trailing the
tool is rounded or flat, so that the mark is wide and
usually U-shaped in cross-section. There are, of
course, intermediate examples, but these distinctions serve in most cases.
The direction of the brushing with relation to
the entire vessel—whether vertical, horizontal, or
otherwise—varies considerably on the few sherds
large enough to enable it to be determined. On rim
sherds the brushing is almost always horizontal, as
described below. On some body sherds it is horizontal (Figure 11, S); on others it is diagonal, going from upper left to lower right; and on others it
is vertical (Figure 11, Q, R). No statement can be
made as to general practice in this respect, because most of the brushed sherds are too small to
judge their orientation with relation to the complete vessel.
There are some cases of cross-brushing, in
which the sherd was first brushed in one direction,
and then in another on top of the first stroke. This
trait is not common.
The brushed sherds indicate that vessel shape
is, in most cases, a large jar, elongated rather than
37

globular, and in some cases at least with slightly
constricted neck.
Brushed Rims
Lip rolled out slightly, horizontal brushing
Eighty-five sherds. These are all vertical rims
of large vessels. The brushing lines vary from thin
to broad. Most of the brushing is relatively carefully done. In two cases there are punctations at
the bottom of the sherd, indicating possibly the
bottom of the zone of horizontal brushing.
Same, with diagonal incisions on exterior of
lip
Three sherds, probably from the same vessel.
Same, with lip rolled out pronouncedly,
coarse brushing, and a coarse groove
One sherd.
Direct lip, horizontal brushing
Thirteen sherds. One rim is flaring, one has a
flat node.
Rims with vertical or steeply diagonal brushing
Thirteen sherds. Two are vertically brushed
with a row of punctates just below the lip. One has
a flat lip and is vertically brushed. One has punctates
on the exterior of the lip. Others have round lips,
some of them very slightly rolled out.
Flared lip
Two sherds from the same vessel show a
straight neck with flared, scalloped lip, with a few
irregular brushed lines on the lip exterior.
Other Brushed Sherds, and Sherds
Showing Combinations of Brushing
with Punctation and/or Incision
In general this group is related in some way
38

to the type Pease Brushed-Incised, which is discussed below. Working from sherds only, it is not
possible to tell where the Pease type ends and
some other category begins. In putting some sherds
within the Pease type and listing others outside
that category, I am trying to facilitate description
rather than seeking to establish typological lines.
Rims with horizontal and diagonal brushing
or incision, with horizontal rows of punctates
(Figure 12, B)
This category consisted of two sherds. These
specimens are much like the rims of Pease vessels,
and are close to a brushed type recently set up, but
not yet published, by Jelks: Broaddus Brushed. A
third specimen lacks the punctates but is otherwise
quite similar; it has diagonal paired incisions.
Brushed panels and related items
These specimens are difficult to categorize;
they may be variants of the Pease category. They
are sherds with brushing in small panels at an angle
to one another. Of the 13 sherds, nine show brushing at right angles.
Pease Brushed-Incised and Related Sherds
Sherds classed as Pease Brushed-Incised were
distinguished primarily by the presence of panels
of brushing or incising over the body, the panels
being separated by lines of punctations or appliqué
strips. Normally the necks are brushed horizontally
and have at least one horizontal row of punctates.
In most cases the divisions between the panels run
vertically, as expected in classic Pease (Suhm et al.
1954, 338). However, some sherds have the
appliqué or punctate bordering lines running obliquely, thus providing a distinct variation of the
classic Pease type.
There are quite a lot of sherds too small for
positive type identification which show lines of
appliqué or punctations, with seemingly zoned
brushing or incisions.
And there is one partially reconstructed vessel
(Figure 13) from Structure II with neat zoned brushing but without bordering lines of appliqué or
punctates. Despite the lack of these zone-demarking

Brushed-appliqué sherds, Pease (Figure 14,
A-C)
There are 110 sherds which can with fair certainty be assigned to the Pease Brushed-Incised
type.
Crude brushed-appliqué group, presumed to
be Pease
Twenty-seven sherds are more crudely treated
than those of the preceding category. Some of the
brushing is more like random incising.
Brushed-punctate group, tentatively Pease

About 250 sherds fall in this category. Of them,
30 are neatly brushed with stab-and-drag or linear-stab lines across them, but no other distinct
zonation; that is, the punctated lines are superimposed upon the brushing which itself is not divided
into zones. Only one sherd has stab-and-drag lines;
the others are lines of stabs.
A series of rims, mostly high and vertical, have
a row of punctates (usually made diagonally from
lower left to upper right) below the lip, horizontal
(occasionally vertical) brushing on the neck, and
another row of punctates at the bottom of the
neck.
Six sherds, mainly from the neck region, are
horizontally brushed with a horizontal row of linear
stab-punctates. At least three vessels are represented.
There is also a wide variety of miscellaneous

makes it difficult to separate this
technique sharply from fine, careful
brushing on the one hand, or incising-trailing on the other, but the
motifs are quite distinct. One sherd
has trailed curvilinear designs superimposed on an over-all combed
design; another shows circles; another is a rim sherd, neatly combed,
with a row of punctates around the
lip. These sherds show clear affiliations with the Foster Trailed-Incised
and Keno Trailed types (Suhm et al.
1954, 272–273, 310–311).
PUNCTATED SHERDS
Relatively closely spaced
punctates, with round instrument (Figure 14, F, G)

A distinctive series of 34 sherds, punctated
with a large coarse instrument, usually a reed. Some
sherds are transitional to the first punctated category above. As in that category, rare sherds show
punctation with a square-ended instrument.

Ten sherds show widely spaced horizontal rows
of punctations on the rim. There is no brushing.

Rims with vertical punctations (Figure 14,
N, O)

Fifteen sherds are related to the Sinner Linear
Punctated type (Suhm et al. 1954, 356–357). In
some cases the work is done so carefully that the
resemblance to cord-impression is remarkable.

Fourteen sherds have closely spaced punctations below the lip, producing the effect of a series
of vertical parallel lines.

INCISED SHERDS
Incised sherds are not uncommon in the col41

lection. Numerous small sherds are not included in
the following discussion.
Rims with diagonal parallel incisions, presumed to be Maydelle Incised (Figure 14, PR)
There are 38 sherds in this category. Assignment to Maydelle, rather than Canton Incised is
almost entirely a matter of context. Cross-hatching
appears on only two sherds.
Miscellaneous sherds with parallel incisions
and parallel cross-hatched incisions
There are 193 sherds and much of this material may belong in the Maydelle Incised category.
In a few cases the incisions are so carelessly done
that the distinction from brushing is not clear.
Rims with horizontal or nearly horizontal incised lines
Seventeen sherds are in this group. Some of
them have lines about 10 mm. apart, slanting
slightly. On others the lines are more widely spaced.
Curvilinear and other incised designs (Figure 12, D-F)
Thirty-four sherds show incised circles, bands
with diagonal hatching, parallel curved lines, and
other motifs. These seem to be cases of incised
decoration following the patterns of the engraved
ware (which is to be described later). On some
specimens the lines are wide enough to be called
trailed, but these sherds do not otherwise form a
distinct group. One specimen is also punctated.
Miscellaneous incised sherds
These 45 specimens include pieces with random incised lines and a number of sherds too small
to assign to any category. A few rim sherds have a
single horizontal line on the exterior below the lip.
APPLIQUÉD SHERDS
Most of the appliquéd sherds have already
42

been discussed in the section on brushed sherds.
There are, however, a number of specimens requiring separate consideration.
Close-spaced vertical appliqué on short rim
(Figure 12, A)
Four sherds which all may be from the same
vessel. The vessel had a flaring rim, vertical incisions on the lip exterior, and vertical appliqué below that. The appliqué is thin and irregular and
extends only to the shoulder area which meets the
neck at an angle and is horizontally brushed.
Miscellaneous appliqué
About 150 sherds fall in the miscellaneous
category. Numerous plain-ware sherds in this class
are not markedly different from the “Brushedappliqué sherds, Pease” except that those in the
present category are not brushed. The appliqué
strips vary from wide and coarse to quite fine. The
work is not very neat. Usually the appliqué strips
are indented at regular intervals. Some of the strips
are parallel and spaced as close as 15 mm. apart.
NECK-BANDED SHERDS
Twelve sherds have incompletely smoothedover coils. Four of them are rim sherds. The work
is crude. It is presumed from context, that these
sherds are assignable to the type La Rue NeckBanded (Suhm et al. 1954, 316–317).
SHERD WITH BASKETRY IMPRESSION
One small specimen (Figure 12, C) is either a
sherd or a piece of naturally baked or hardened
clay, with the clear imprint of splint wickerwork on
it. The material does not appear to have any temper, and it is lightweight for a sherd, but is quite
hard as if it had been well fired.
ENGRAVED SHERDS
Ripley Engraved

They show a wide variety of design motifs—scrolls,
circles, cross-hatched panels, ticked and spurred
lines, crosses and diamonds with circles, and others—which are characteristic of this type (Suhm et
al. 1954, 346–349). It has not been possible to
reconstruct an entire vessel, even on paper, from
the fragments found. Vessel shapes, as tentatively
reconstructed, include carinated bowls and bottles,
and one compound bowl.
No sherds were found that could with certainty be assigned to type Taylor Engraved, which
is closely akin to Ripley. However, on sherds alone
it is not always possible to distinguish the two types.
The lips of the rim sherds are like those described for the plain ware; direct rounded, rolled
outward or thickened, or (in a few cases) attached
to the rim at an angle. Normally there is a horizontal line engraved or incised just below the lip. The
lip is often tapered on the inside, which, combined
with the exterior incision undercutting the lip on
the outside, gives the false impression of a rolledout lip.
Four Ripley Engraved rim sherds have vertical

or diagonal punctation or incision along the exterior of the lip.

“Careless Curvilinear Engraved”
(Figure 15, E-H)
Eighty-four sherds show a distinct style of
engraving which, for lack of a better term, I have
called “Careless Curvilinear.” The style of execution
is much like that appearing on sherds of the type
Poynor Engraved of the Frankston Focus (Suhm et
al. 1954, 342–345), although the motifs are not
the same. The style is quite cursory, and a frequent
characteristic is filling in of areas with random lines,
43

E. Mott Davis

rather than excising the areas as in classic Ripley
Engraved. On many of these specimens the motifs
are clearly Ripley Engraved, whereas on others the
impression is somewhere between Ripley and
Poynor. A few sherds might actually be assignable
to Poynor Engraved. Two rim sherds have the exterior lip covered with small punctates, and a
body sherd shows rows of punctates.
Other Engraved Sherds
Rectilinear with cross-hatching (Figure 15,
C, D)
Eight sherds showing this motif are unlike
Ripley Engraved in design but like that type in execution. These sherds do not correspond well to
any particular type, but the design is more like
Friendship Engraved than any other published type
(Suhm et al. 1954, 274–275).
Belcher Engraved
Two sherds have parallel lines with a dashed
line between, and are classed as Belcher Engraved.
Engraved-punctate sherds
Certain engraved-punctate sherds have already
been mentioned in the description of Ripley Engraved and Careless Curvilinear Engraved sherds.
There are also three other sherds: (1) a shoulder of
a carinated bowl showing a line of fine punctates
just above the shoulder, like Glassel Engraved or
Friendship Engraved; (2) a rim with three engraved
horizontal lines and a fine line of punctates below,
suggesting Barkman, Simms, or Belcher Engraved;
and (3) a sherd with an engraved line and a
punctated area, unidentifiable as to possible type.
Right-angle panels of parallel lines
One engraved sherd shows this motif. Except
for the technique, it is much like the Maydelle-like
incised sherds described earlier.
Nodes
Four sherds show nodes: (1) two sherds are
44

The Whelan Site, A Late Caddoan Component

nodes with a cross engraved on each; (2) one sherd
is a node with a nondescript engraved design; (3)
one sherd is a bottle neck sherd with two nodes
and an engraved design encircling them.
Red filmed sherds
There were 167 red filmed sherds. They are
either engraved with Ripley Engraved designs (but
have not been included in the Ripley Engraved count
given above) or are plain. Judging from the appearance of the plain sherds, many or most of
them are from the same vessels as the engraved
ones, and for this reason the whole group is placed
here under engraved sherds. The count is as follows: engraved, 47; plain body sherds, 116; base
sherds, 4. Three of the plain sherds are from bottle
necks, and the rest are from bowls.
DISCUSSION OF THE SHERD COLLECTION
The major fact of significance emerging from
study of the Whelan site sherds is that both classic
Titus Focus elements and non-Titus Focus elements
are present and significant. Because of the preponderance of Ripley Engraved sherds in the engraved
pottery, one might expect that the site would be
assigned to the Titus Focus. Therefore, the presence in significant numbers of sherds of Pease
Brushed-Incised pottery, which does not belong to
the Titus Focus as now defined (Suhm et al. 1954,
189-195), is an important matter. It is to be expected that a few “foreign” sherds, such as those
of Belcher Engraved and the ones resembling Friendship Engraved, might occur in a Titus Focus site,
because such signs of inter-influence are not uncommon in Caddoan sites. But the occurrence of
numbers of Pease Brushed-Incised sherds is a distinct anomaly, and it is evident from this fact alone
that the Whelan site does not properly fit into the
Titus Focus as now defined. Pease Brushed-Incised is characteristic of the Bosssier Focus, and is
thought of as an early Fulton Aspect type, growing
directly out of the Haley Focus utility ware of the
Gibson Aspect.
Other items differentiating the Whelan site
sherd collection from what one expects in a typical
Titus Focus site are the presence of the “Careless
Curvilinear Engraved” style and the absence of cer-

The Whelan Site, A Late Caddoan Component

tain pottery types, such as Harleton Appliqué, which
are commonly found in Titus Focus components.
The problem of classifying the Whelan site
component will be touched upon again in the final
section of this report.

OTHER POTTERY OBJECTS
POTTERY PIPES
A broken biconical pipe (Figure 15, I) was
found in Structure II. It is of pottery, the material
being heavily bone tempered and 5 mm. thick. The
external diameter of the bowl is 40 mm., and the
height of the specimen is 30 mm. In form this pipe
is more like those of the Frankston Focus than
those of the Titus Focus.
A small fragment of another pipe was found
in the cap (Zone III) of Mound A. It is tempered
with bone and grit.
DAUB
Several hundred fragments of clay daub appeared in the course of the excavation, especially
in Zone III, the cap of Mound A. Many of them
show impressions of grass and rods. Many—perhaps most—of them were burned. Nearly all of
these fragments have been saved, in the hope that
a detailed study of the impressions on them can be
made. It is assumed that these clay fragments represent clay plastered on the exterior of Caddo
houses, and it is possible that such a study might
shed a little light on construction practices.

OBJECTS OF EURO-AMERICAN
MANUFACTURE
Three objects of White manufacture were
found below the surface. All are believed to be
intrusive.
A button or pin of the campaign variety, bearing the words “BRING ONE” was found in the humus on Mound A. It has been identified by local
people as a pin worn by members of church or civic

E. Mott Davis

groups during campaigns to have each member
bring someone else to service or meeting.
A musket ball 12.0-12.5 mm. in diameter was
found in Zone III of Mound A, associated with a
minor disturbance, probably a rodent hole.
A shotgun shell was found at a depth of about
1 foot below the surface in the eastern part of
Structure II. It is marked “Western Xpert No. 12.”
No sign of intrusion was noted, but since the object was found in the course of shoveling, evidences of intrusion could well have been destroyed.
Since no other such objects were noted at any
depth, this recent specimen, like the other two, is
judged to be intrusive.

DISCUSSION OF THE
WHELAN SITE
Although this is a descriptive rather than interpretive report, a summary discussion of problems arising from the work at the Whelan site is in
order.
Among Caddoan sites, Whelan is unusual in
that no burials were found there. However, since
the total site was large and only a small part of it
was investigated, it is probable that there were
burials somewhere in the site. We expected to find
them in the mounds, but there were no burials
found in the two mounds investigated.
The problem of classification of the component in terms of the established Caddoan complexes has been brought up already. The engraved
pottery from Whelan marks it as a Titus Focus site;
but the utility pottery indicates otherwise, as does
the absence of such characteristic Titus Focus traits
as Harleton Appliqué pottery and Talco points.
The Titus Focus as it now stands is really a
burial complex, since it has been defined almost
entirely on the basis of burial associations. It may
be, then, that the Whelan site is simply a Titus
Focus occupation site, and that the Titus Focus
people used Pease Brushed-Incised pottery in their
everyday life but did not put it in their burials; and,
conversely, that they put Talco points in their burials but did not use them otherwise. (Points of this
type are called “Burial Points” by the local ama45

E. Mott Davis

teurs because they never find them except in burials.) For confirmation or disproof, this hypothesis—
like the two others to follow—must await work in
sites that include both occupation areas and burials.
A second possible interpretation of the situation at Whelan is brought to mind by the presence
of the “Careless Curvilinear” style of engraving, with
its implications of Titus-Frankston fusion. Perhaps
the Whelan site represents an early stage in the
development of Titus Focus, before “classic” Titus
had become sharply distinguished from other late
Caddoan foci such as Frankston, Texarkana, and
Belcher.
A third interpretation is that the Whelan site
was occupied by a different group of people from
the Titus Focus people, but at approximately the
same time as Titus Focus, and sharing a number of
traits with that Focus.
As already stated, we must have middens and
burials together, before we can be sure of the true
historical significance of this site.
Another problem presents itself in this analysis. Why was the Whelan site located so near the
creek, where it would be subject to periodic flooding? And why did we find only one house in the

46

The Whelan Site, A Late Caddoan Component

area investigated? Both of these questions point to
the possibility that this was primarily a ceremonial
site, serving people who lived in village areas elsewhere in the valley. Structure II might have housed
a priest and his family, or some other functionary
concerned with the site. To support such a hypothesis, it would of course be necessary to test the
entire site to see whether there might have been
more houses present. The filling of the lake prevented our doing this testing. It would also be
helpful if we could investigate nearby village sites,
of which at least one, the Segal site (41MR1), is
known about a mile north of Whelan. But the lake
has prevented our working at the Segal site. What
we really have needed is a settlement pattern study
of this part of the valley, an intriguing type of project
which we once thought would be made possible by
the clearing of the forest from the reservoir area.
Unfortunately, Mother Nature has willed it otherwise, and a determination of the function of the
Whelan site occupation in the life of the Caddoan
Indians of Fulton Aspect time in Cypress Creek
valley will probably remain a mystery until circumstances permit intensive work in some nearby area
which was occupied by the same peoples.

ABSTRACT
The Dalton site is a low mound on the upland surface at the edge of the valley of Cypress Creek in
northeastern Upshur County, Texas. It was excavated by a University of Texas-National Park Service field
party in 1958. At the site, a circular pole structure with entranceway extending southwest was built in a
shallow depression. Later another similar structure was built on the same spot. This last structure burned
down, and the mound was erected over it. The mound fill contained pottery and stone artifacts forming
a complex essentially the same as those found at the Harroun and Whelan sites, which are also in the
Ferrell’s Bridge Reservoir area and which also had mounds built over burned structures. This complex,
called the Whelan complex in this report, is apparently an early version of the Titus Focus, a late
prehistoric Caddoan complex represented by many cemeteries in this part of Texas. The Whelan complex
differs from the “classic” Titus Focus in that it includes Perdiz points, Pease Brushed-Incised pottery, and
mounds, and lacks points of the types Talco, Bassett, and Maud, and pottery of the types Harleton
Appliquéd and Belcher Engraved. Otherwise the artifact content is essentially the same, and the Whelan
complex is best considered part of the Titus Focus, by expanding the definition of the latter as suggested
earlier by Jelks and Tunnell. The reasons for building structures, burning them, and erecting mounds over
them, are not known, but the whole complex of behavior is evidently ceremonial in nature.

FOREWORD
This report describes excavations in 1958 by a University of Texas-National Park Service archeological field party at the Dalton site, a Caddoan mound site in the Ferrell’s Bridge Reservoir area in northeastern Texas. The work was carried on under the terms of a cooperative agreement between The University
and the Park Service.
We are grateful to the personnel of the office of the U.S. Corps of Engineers at the Ferrell’s Bridge
Dam for their cooperation and assistance, which were major factors in the success of our work. In
particular, thanks are due to the following: H. W. Fletcher, Project Engineer; O. L. Stafford, Assistant
Project Engineer; John A. Whitson, Realty Officer; W. S. Alsop, Chief Inspector; W. R. Thomas, Clearing
Inspector; and Miss Margaret Ramsay, Clerk.
The following people living in the vicinity of the reservoir were particularly helpful to us: Mr. and Mrs.
John S. Moseley, Mr. and Mrs. Charles L. Dalton—the former occupants of the site, for whom it was
named—L. C. Scudday, R. R. Nicholas, Robert L. Turner, and the late Edward M. German. Dr. Clarence H.
Webb of Shreveport and Sam Whiteside of Tyler visited the site and contributed valuable information and
advice based on their extensive knowledge of archeological materials in the area.
The real work was, of course, done by the men on the field crew, and the quality of the results rests
upon their skill and industry. We therefore acknowledge gratitude to the following: W. A. Davis, Assistant
Archeologist; W. Brent Hempkins, Staff Assistant; Robert W. Stevenson, student; Mrs. Ardath Deaver,
volunteer assistant; and the men who did most of the shovel work—H. H. Jackson, Loss Sloan, W. C.
(Casey) Jones, James H. Starrett, and Charles F. Campbell.
We are particularly grateful to Edward B. Jelks, in charge of the Texas Archeological Salvage Project,
and T. N. Campbell, Chairman of the Department of Anthropology at The University of Texas, for
assistance, advice, and encouragement, both moral and material, throughout the project. We also acknowledge the skill, industry, and patience of Mrs. Pat Bess, Secretary of the Department of Anthropology,
in coping successfully with the authors’ whims and inconsistencies in typing the final copy of the report.
This report is the result of collaborative effort. Davis, the senior author, has been in general charge
of the project since its inception, and is primarily responsible for the final section of the report. Gipson,
who began his participation as a student on the original field party, is primarily responsible for the part of
the report dealing with the structural analysis of the mound, and for the preparation of the illustrations,
both line and photographic. Otherwise our contributions have been about equal. In any case, we have
both participated in all phases of the report, and the result is a joint product.

The Dalton Site, A Late Caddoan Mound Site

INTRODUCTION
This report describes results of excavations at
the Dalton site (41UR11), a Fulton Aspect Caddoan
site in the Ferrell’s Bridge Reservoir area on Cypress Creek, northeastern Texas. The site is closely
related to the Titus Focus, of which there are many
sites in this area. The Dalton material is different
enough to indicate that it may represent an early
stage in the development of the Titus Focus. In
this respect this site helps to support finds made at
two other sites within the same reservoir area, the
Whelan site (Davis 1958), and the Harroun site
(Jelks and Tunnell 1959), which appear to represent the same culture as the Dalton site.
THE ENVIRONMENT
The geography of the Ferrell’s Bridge Reservoir area and the history of archeological work there
have been described in detail in earlier reports (Davis
1958; Jelks and Tunnell 1959; Davis and Davis
1959) and need be reviewed only briefly here. Cypress Creek is a tributary of the Red River, flowing
southeastward for more than 100 miles through
the heavily wooded rolling country of northeastern
Texas (Figure 16). The Cypress Creek valley in the
area of the Ferrell’s Bridge Reservoir is approximately 200 feet above sea level and varies in width
up to about 2 miles. The rolling upland surface is
some 75-100 feet above the valley floor, and some
hills in the area are as much as 100 feet higher still.
The area abounds in deer, small game, and fish,
and must have been good hunting territory for the
Indians. It is not rich agricultural country, and this
may be a partial explanation for the seeming brevity of the occupation of the area by prehistoric
Caddo Indians. In the Ferrell’s Bridge area the only
known sites either are those of the non-agricultural
Archaic stage or are sites belonging to, or closely
related to, the Titus Focus, a Caddoan complex of
late prehistoric times (Suhm et al. 1954, 189–195).
HISTORY OF SALVAGE RESEARCH
Salvage archeology in the Ferrell’s Bridge Reservoir began early in 1957 and was completed in
the fall of 1959. In this 2-1/2-year interval, seven

E. Mott Davis and Jules R. Gipson

excavation projects were completed by field parties of The University of Texas and the National
Park Service. The work described in this report
concerns one of those projects, a field party under
E. M. Davis and W. A. Davis, which worked in June
and July, 1958, under the auspices of The University and the Park Service, and with which was combined a summer archeological field school of the
Department of Anthropology of The University of
Texas. This project was primarily concerned with
two sites, the Dalton Mound and the Jake Martin
site. The latter site is about 0.25 mile east of the
Dalton Mound and is the only Archaic site to be
excavated in the reservoir area. The work at the
Martin site has been reported earlier (Davis and
Davis 1959). The present report is concerned with
the Dalton Mound.

THE SITE AND THE WORK
LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION
The Dalton site is located in the northeastern
corner of Upshur County, Texas, about 3 miles
northeast of Ore City and 5.5 miles south of the
steel mill of the Lone Star Steel Co. It is in an area
of woods and fields on the upland surface about
150 feet from the steep southwestern edge of Cypress Creek valley. At the southern edge of the
mound is an old road cut, the remains of the old
Jefferson to Pittsburg highway, which once crossed
Cypress Creek a short distance northeast of the
site. A more recent dirt road lies just south of the
road cut.
The mound is about 55 feet in maximum diameter and 2.5 feet high. As the topographic plan
shows (Figure 17), it is not circular but is in the
form of a very rough right triangle, the hypotenuse
being northwest and the long side to the south. To
judge from what was learned of the internal structure in the course of excavation, and from comparisons with the closely related Harroun and
Whelan sites (Jelks and Tunnell 1959; Davis 1958),
the mound was originally circular and had eroded
to its present outline. A large tree stands on the
east flank of the mound.
The land around the mound is relatively level.
However, about 600 feet west-southwest is an53

other mound and near it is a burial and occupation
site. The occupation area seems to extend southeastward to a point some 700 feet south of the
Dalton mound. Unfortunately for our investigations
these features were mostly on private land and the
owners, although sympathetic with our work, were
unwilling to have us dig more than one test because of the damage that would have resulted to a
stand of clover which it had taken some years to
establish. We were able to do some additional testing at the southeastern end of the site. This site is
listed under two site numbers, 41UR14 (Sam Gray
#2) and 41UR18 (Chasteen), and the brief work
there is to be reported in a later statement. It is
entirely likely that it and the Dalton site are one
and the same.
HISTORY OF EXCAVATIONS
The Dalton mound was first noted in December, 1957, by Mr. Sam Whiteside of Tyler, while he
was on the way to visit the field project at the
Harroun site, which is about a mile to the east. The
Dalton site was in an area designated to become a
public access and recreation area in the reservoir
development program, and was therefore appropriate for salvage investigation.
Work at the site was carried on from June 11
to July 15, 1958, by a crew of from four to eleven
persons under the supervision of E. M. Davis and
W. A. Davis. As part of the same field project, work
was going on simultaneously at the nearby Martin
site.
Summary of Work Accomplished
A part of the mound was excavated completely
and considerable trenching of the surrounding area
was also carried on in an effort to find an occupation area (Figures 18, 19). No such area was found,
and we are at a loss to understand where the nearly
two thousand sherds found in the mound came
from unless the earth for the mound was carried
from the site mentioned earlier, some 600 feet south
and southeast. It is possible that there could have
been occupation in Mr. and Mrs. Dalton’s yard northwest of the mound where we did not test; but they
had never seen any sherds there and we observed
no surface evidences of Indian occupation.

The Dalton Site, A Late Caddoan Mound Site

TECHNIQUES OF INVESTIGATION
Grid and Elevation Control
A stake was driven in at the topographic center of the mound and was called grid point N500/
E500, i.e., 500 feet north and 500 feet east of the
arbitrary origin of the grid. It was planned that in
this way profiles through the center of the mound
could be drawn on grid lines. (Later, excavation
proved that N500/E500 was 6 feet north of the
structural center of the mound.) The top of this
stake was arbitrarily assigned an elevation of 100
feet above site datum. Using a transit, north-south
and east-west base lines were established, on E500
and N500 respectively. Grid north is 0o53’ east of
magnetic north. Stakes were driven in at grid points
on these lines as needed, using a steel tape for
measurements. Other stakes were located at grid
points by setting up the transit over stakes on lines
N500 or E500 and turning a right angle, then measuring with steel tape. In this way main reference
stakes were placed at 10-foot grid points as necessary, and other stakes were, when desired, placed
at 5-foot grid points by measuring with tape and
plumb bob from the 10-foot stakes. All excavation
squares were designated by the grid designation of
the southeast corner.
At the end of work a permanent reference
stake made of angle iron was put in at N540/E500.
Top of this stake is 96.97 feet above site datum.
Excavation and Documentation
Square-ended shovels were used in the digging. Most of the earth excavated from the mound
was screened through 1/2-inch or 1/3-inch mesh
screens. All fine work was done with trowels.
Most of the excavation was carried on in terms
of arbitrary 1/2-foot levels. After about a week of
work the structural sequence in the mound seemed
clear, and we began to excavate and document in
terms of stratigraphic zones. Almost immediately,
however, it became apparent that the sequence
was more complex and more obscure than we had
supposed. It was therefore necessary to return to
the arbitrary levels. A detailed record was made of
the changes in the nature of the fill within each
level, in order to permit correlation of the speci-

mens with the structural sequence, once the latter
had been worked out. The actual stratigraphic sequence was not clear until the work was nearly
finished, and some of it was not clear until laboratory analysis had proceeded for some time.
Thus the documentation of the specimens is
for the most part in terms of 1/2-foot levels, which
only incidentally and occasionally correspond to
stratigraphic zones. However, thanks to the nature
of the records it is possible to correlate the finds
with the structural sequences, albeit with varying
degrees of precision.
Precise locations of all significant artifacts and
structural features were determined by measuring
the distance from two stakes with steel tape and
plumb bob. Elevation control was by transit and
hand level. The floor of each square was drawn at
every 1/2-foot level, and profiles were drawn on
most 10-foot grid lines.
The test trenches beyond the limits of the
mound were dug in 1/2-foot levels following the
surface contour. In Trenches A and B the earth was
screened from sample squares every 50 feet along
the trench. In the other test trenches no screening
was done.
A continuous field record was maintained, levels and features being recorded on individual record
58

sheets. A daily log of the work was also maintained, and the written records were supplemented
by numerous photographs. The field records are
on file in the archeology laboratory of the Department of Anthropology of The University of Texas.

THE MOUND
STRATIGRAPHY
Eight stratigraphic zones have been defined
within the mound. Although these zones were not
everywhere clearly distinguished from one another,
the total sequence could be reconstructed from
sections of a number of different profiles. The sequence was particularly well defined in the profile
on the N500 grid line between E490 and E500
(Figure 20), which accordingly has served as a useful representative profile in interpreting the stratigraphy and in reconstructing the history of the mound.
It is quite possible that the whole stratigraphic
sequence was present in other sections but was
not so recorded. Our reason for so suspecting is
that when we first cleared and recorded the type
section on line N500, we distinguished only six
zones, rather than eight; but after this surface had

been exposed for several days and when light conditions were better, we could distinguish Zones III,
IV, and V (as described below) where previously
these three zones had appeared as a single zone. It
is quite likely, therefore, that we missed the separation of these zones elsewhere.
Starting at the bottom, the zones are:
Zone I: Underlying Clay
Zone I was composed of a compact red clay,
which underlies the whole region. Its thickness at
the site is not known. About 80% of the post molds
which were recorded within the mound extended
down into this zone. In most squares, the excavation was discontinued when Zone I was reached.
In a few squares the work penetrated as much as
1 foot into Zone I.
A few artifacts were found in Zone I, but they
do not constitute a separate group typologically
from those found above.
Zone II: Subsoil
This zone was the sub-humus soil zone of
this area which, like Zone I, was continuous under
the mound. It was composed of a pale brown sand
which became redder in its lower portions. However, there was a distinct separation between Zones
I and II. Under the mound, Zone II varied in thickness from 1-2 feet, with a mode of about 1.5 feet.
The profiles show that in the center of the mound
a shallow depression, 0.3-0.4 feet deep and about
18 feet in diameter, was scooped out of this zone,
probably before the first house was built. Around
this depression was a scarcely perceptible embankment about 0.3 feet high and 6 feet wide, presumably made of the earth thrown out of the depression. The circular post mold patterns to be described later were within the depression and were
roughly concentric with it, and all post molds found
were represented in Zone II.
Numerous artifacts were found in Zone II.
They are not distinguished typologically from those
in other zones.
Zone III: Lower Floor
Zones III, IV, and V were superimposed lenses

E. Mott Davis and Jules R. Gipson

which occupied a circular area about 23 feet in
diameter in the center of the mound. Outside of
this area, Zone VII rested directly upon Zone II.
Zone III was a lens of compact red clay, 0.10.3 feet thick and about 20 feet in maximum diameter, which probably served as a floor for House A,
the earliest of the two structures built during the
history of the mound. The minimum thickness was
just outside the post mold rings where the zone
was part of the encircling embankment.
Zone IV: Ash
Zone IV was a discontinuous zone of gray
sandy ash. It ranged in thickness from 0.1-0.3 feet.
The zone was thicker and more clearly defined toward the center than outward around the post mold
ring. The diameter of the zone was about 19 feet,
slightly less than that of Zone III. Zone IV was not
detected in all profiles (it may have been missed in
some cases, as noted earlier) but nevertheless it
seems to have represented a specific episode in
the history of the mound, and hence has been
given a separate designation.
Zone V: Upper Floor
Zone V resembled Zone III. It was a lens of
compact red clay, varying in thickness from 0.2
feet to almost 1.0 feet, and had a maximum diameter of about 23 feet, about 3 feet larger than Zone
III. Within the post mold rings, the zone had a
mode of about 0.25 feet in thickness, while outside
the rings the clay was almost 1.0 feet in thickness
and appeared to have formed an embankment, as
in the case of Zones II and III, the latter of which
Zone V completely covered. Zone V is believed to
have been the floor of the latest structure, House
B.
Zone VI: Destruction Zone
This zone was composed of carbonaceous
sand, a sand stained to a fairly uniform black with
both small and large flecks of charcoal scattered
throughout the zone. The top of the zone was
extremely irregular. The zone formed a circular lens
about 15 feet in diameter and varying in thickness
from 0.1-1.4 feet. It was thickest in the center,
61

E. Mott Davis and Jules R. Gipson

within the post mold rings. This zone is believed to
have been the “destruction zone,” representing the
burned remains of House B. Much of its sand content was probably derived from the zone above.
Zone VII: Mound Cap
Zone VII was a layer of brown sand covering
all the lower zones. In the center of the mound it
rested on Zone VI; farther out it overlay the outer
edges of Zone V; and at the edges of the mound it
merged with Zone II. Zone VII averaged about
1.75 feet in thickness, but occasionally was less
than 1 foot in thickness, especially directly over the
clay embankment around the outer portions of the
post mold ring. This zone was the “cap” which
accounted for the ultimate form of the mound.
Zone VIII: Humus
Zone VIII, the highest zone, was a humus
zone up to 0.5 feet in thickness, which had been
formed since Zone VII was piled up. It was not
present everywhere on the mound, since erosion
had removed the humus from some areas.
STRATIGRAPHY OUTSIDE THE MOUND
In the area around the mound, the normal
soil sequence for this region—humus, brown sand,
and underlying red clay—was found everywhere.
Those three zones were designated Zones VIII,
IIo, and I.
Zone I: Underlying Clay
Zone I was the underlying red clay which has
already been described as one of the zones under
the mound. There was no difference in stratigraphic
significance between the part of this zone under
the mound and those parts away from the mound.
Zone IIo: Subsoil
Zone IIo, the brown sand, was continuous
with Zones II and VII within the mound. Doubtless
it is mainly to be equated with Zone II, but since
objects found in it might relate to the time of Zone
VII, it has been distinguished from Zone II by the
62

The Dalton Site, A Late Caddoan Mound Site

suffix “o.”
Zone VIII: Humus
Zone VIII was the modern soil zone, which
was continuous with, and to our eyes indistinguishable from, Zone VIII on the mound. It might be
expected that this humus zone would have continued under the outer part of the mound, at least as
far inward as the central depression under the
mound, since there was doubtless a humus zone
present before the mound was built. In such case
the old humus zone would have separated Zone
VII from Zone II; but we note no such separation.
It is to be expected that Zone VIII outside the
mound had a longer history than Zone VIII on the
mound, and because of this it would have been
better if we had used different designations as was
done in the case of Zone II. However, this distinction was not made. In view of the final results, little
if any significant loss of information appears to
have resulted.
EVIDENCES OF STRUCTURES
The Post Molds
Eighty post molds were recorded within the
mound. Sixty-three of them were well documented:
for most of them, the center was located precisely
by intersecting arcs from two grid points; the horizontal section (as it appeared at the top of Zone I)
was drawn; the mold was sectioned vertically and
the vertical section was drawn; and the remainder
of the mold was cored (i.e., the fill within the mold
was removed) as a verification of the total shape of
the mold. Eight molds were less fully documented,
and nine were indistinct and were recorded as
“probables.”
There were indications of the molds in Zone
II, but the full pattern showed distinctly only in
Zone I. For this reason the recording of the post
mold patterns was done at the top of Zone I.
The molds formed a pattern of two roughly
concentric circles (hereafter called “rings”), three
central molds, and two parallel lines extending
southwestward from the outer ring (Figure 21).
Each ring evidently represented a circular structure
with center post and the two parallel lines repre-

sent two superimposed entranceways.
The rings were not completely excavated, since
they passed under the section of the mound on
which a large tree grew. This tree was left undisturbed at the request of the Corps of Engineers,
since it was desired that major trees in the recreation area be preserved. Excavations beyond the
tree demonstrated that no entranceway was present
other than to the southwest. In view of the relatively uniform nature of the rings, it is doubtful
that much significant information was lost by not
excavating beneath the tree.
The two rings overlapped in their western parts
and it was not possible in that area to be sure in
every case which post mold belonged to which
ring. However, the resulting error in interpretation
is probably minor.
We found no distinct evidences of a central
fireplace, even though both in the field and in the
laboratory we looked closely for such evidences.
Numerous burned and ashy areas were encountered, but they were irregular and appear to have
resulted from the burning of one or both of the
structures. One such area was noted directly above
the post molds, but it was not well defined and was
relatively small. In short, the effects of more widespread burning appear to have obscured evidences
of a fireplace or fireplaces, if such features ever
were present.
The structures represented by the post mold
patterns will be referred to here as “houses,” although no specific function is intended to be implied. Indeed, as discussed later we believe the
“houses” were ceremonial in function.
House A
House A was represented by the inner ring of
post molds. The ring was 15 feet in diameter, and
19 of the well-documented
MOUNDpost
A molds were assigned to it. Originally there may have been as
many as 34 posts in the ring. Measurements of the
post molds were as follows:
Diameter: range 0.3-0.8 feet, mean 0.6,
mode 0.6.
Distance between centers: range 0.75-2.75
feet, mean 1.3, mode 0.8.
Elevation of bottom above site datum: range
64

The Dalton Site, A Late Caddoan Mound Site

94.1-95.0 feet, mean 94.83, mode 94.50.
House B
House B was represented by the outer ring of
post molds. The ring was 18 feet in diameter, and
22 of the well-documented post molds were assigned to it. Originally, as in House A, there may
have been as many as 34 posts in the ring. The
data concerning these molds are as follows:
Diameter: range 0.3-0.8 feet, mean 0.6,
mode 0.5.
Distance between centers: range 0.5-2.75
feet, mean 1.71, mode 2.0. (The smaller
distances are represented by two cases
of paired molds.)
Elevation of bottom above site datum: range
94.3-95.5 feet, mean 94.76, mode 94.5.
Evidences for Sequence
There is evidence that House A was built first,
and House B later. The evidence is not direct, because it was not possible to determine the surface
or surfaces from which the individual post holes
were dug, as only the lower parts of the molds
could be distinguished, after the floors (Zones V
and III) had been removed. However, the lower
floor of red clay (Zone III) was of smaller diameter
than the upper floor (Zone V), and this fact suggests that the lower floor correlates with the smaller
post mold ring—House A—which in that case would
be earlier. Furthermore, the bottoms of the post
molds of House A were at an average elevation
0.23 feet lower than the average elevation of the
bottoms of the House B molds. The difference is
approximately the same as the difference in elevation of the two floors, Zones III and V. If we assume that the post holes were dug to the same
average depth below the surface, then the post
holes of House A were dug from the level of the
lower floor, and the House B holes were dug from
the upper and later floor, after 0.23 feet of occupation fill and clay floor had been added to the floor.
Center-Posts
Three large post molds were located in the

The Dalton Site, A Late Caddoan Mound Site

center of the rings. They doubtless represent the
center-posts characteristically used as working platforms during the construction of Caddo houses;
but why there were three center-post molds here,
when there were evidences of only two structures,
we were unable to determine. The northernmost of
the three molds was larger and deeper than the
others: it had a diameter of 0.8 feet and its bottom
was at 93.99 feet above site datum. The southern
mold was 0.62 feet in diameter, its bottom being at
94.41 feet The middle mold of the three was 0.7
feet in diameter, with its bottom at 94.57 feet above
datum. The northernmost mold, being deepest,
might have been the earliest and hence relate to
House A. On the other hand, if one uses the center-post molds as pivot points for a compass, the
middle mold best matches the House A post mold
ring and the southern mold best matches the House
A post mold ring and the southern mold best
matches the House B ring. None of these evidences
is definitive, and we cannot consider it possible to
correlate specific center-post molds with particular
structures.
Entranceway
There were 22 entranceway post molds forming two roughly parallel lines about 12 feet long
and 2.9 feet apart, extending southwestward from
the house rings. Fourteen of the molds were
bunched in the first 5.5 feet of the lines, nearest
the rings. It appeared that two structures were
represented, one of them about 5.5 feet long; the
other extending out the full distance of 12 feet.
There is room for error here, since on the basis of
the horizontal plan it was not possible to separate
the molds of one structure from the other, except
in the outer 6.5 feet of the lines, where all the
molds, eight in number, are presumed to belong to
the longer entranceway.
General data on the entranceway post molds
are as follows:
Diameter: range 0.45-0.8 feet, mean 0.62,
mode 0.60
Distance between centers: no meaningful
statement can be made, since two structures seem to be mixed here.
Elevation of bottom above site datum: range

E. Mott Davis and Jules R. Gipson

94.6-95.3 feet, mean 94.93, mode 94.90.
The eight molds assignable to the outer end
of the long entranceway did not form a consistent
pattern, as in one place a mold seemed to be missing and in another two molds overlapped. The
degree of detail in the documentation of these molds
also varied considerably. The following data are
available:
Diameter (based on four molds): range
0.50-0.75 feet, mean 0.64, mode 0.65.
Distance between centers: extremely varied; on an impressionistic basis, it looks
as if the posts were meant to be spaced
an average of about 1.5 feet apart.
Elevation of bottom above site datum (based
on five molds): range 94.7-94.9 feet,
mean 94.83, no mode.
We were unable to find strong evidence relating either entranceway with House A or House B.
The mean elevation of the bottoms of five molds
from the long entranceway is 0.1 feet lower than
the figure for the entranceway molds in general,
and this difference might indicate that the long
entranceway was part of House A, since the House
A molds extended down farther, on the average,
than those of House B. However, this evidence is
only suggestive.
Clay Daub
Two-hundred-nine hardened lumps of clay
were found in the site. Many of them bore marks of
grass or sticks. They are believed to be the remains
of clay which was daubed on the structures, a known
Caddo practice (Webb 1959, 59 ff.).
Stratigraphically (Table 2), 14 clay daub fragments came from zones earlier than the mound, 18
were certainly no higher than Zone V, 49 were from
mixed or disturbed areas, and the remaining 128
specimens came from the upper zones of the mound,
mainly from levels which included Zones V-VI and
VI-VIII. This distribution indicates that most of
these pieces came from House B, the more recent
house. They were very likely baked to their present
consistency when the house burned. House A might
well have been plastered with clay also, but if so

the evidences of it—along with other remains of
the house—were cleared away before building
House B. The pieces from deeper zones perhaps
owed their position to the same factors as those
which led to the presence of pottery sherds as low
as Zone II; that is, to activities here before the
presence of the mound, by the group that later
built the mound.
Further evidence as to the nature of these
pieces of clay is found from their horizontal distribution (Figure 22). In general the distribution is in
the same area as that of the houses. There is no
clay from the outer end of the entranceway, a fact
which supports the suggestion that this part of the
entranceway is to be attributed to House A. There
is remarkably little daub from the northeastern and
southeastern parts of the post mold ring. This is
hard to explain other than being due to some indeterminate accident during the burning of House B.
STRUCTURAL HISTORY OF THE MOUND
The history of the construction of the Dalton
66

Mound can best be divided into three stages. They
will be described in chronological order.
Stage I — The First Structure, House A
During Stage I, House A, represented by the
inner ring of post molds, was constructed. The
stages in this construction were as follows, it being
understood that their sequence is not certain: a
shallow circular depression was dug; the post holes
were dug and the building was constructed; red
clay (Zone III) was brought in and spread over the
depression, presumably to serve as a floor. Our
knowledge of the site is not sufficient to allow us
to say with certainty whether the post molds were
dug before or after the depression was scooped
out, or before or after the clay floor was laid down.
The clay floor, Zone III, was necessarily laid down
after the circular depression was created.
It is not possible to estimate, even relatively,
how long House A was utilized or to determine
what its ultimate fate was. Zone IV, an ashy zone,
could have resulted from the destruction of the
house by fire, or it might represent accumulated
ash repeatedly scattered from a fireplace; or it could
result from a combination of the two.
Seven unidentifiable fragments of burned bone
were found on the screen during the digging near
the center of the mound in a 1/2-foot level which
included parts of Zones II, III, and IV. These specimens may well have been associated with the earlier house (they certainly did not post-date it), and
if so, they are the only such items which differ from
finds higher in the mound.
No remains of House A, other than post molds,
were found above the floor, unless the ash of Zone
IV represents the burned remains of the house. It
seems likely that the remains of House A were
intentionally cleared away before work on the later
house, House B, began.
Stage II — The Second Structure, House B
Stage II represents the building, use, and
destruction of the second house, House B. The
post holes of the outer ring were dug and the structure was built. Red clay (Zone V) was carried in and
laid down. Again, it was not possible to determine
whether the post holes were dug before the clay

67

E. Mott Davis and Jules R. Gipson

floor was laid down, or vice versa.
The fact that Zone V, the clay floor of House
B, directly overlay Zone IV, the ash zone of House
A, may indicate that the time between the destruction of House A and the construction of House B
was relatively short, or it may simply signify that
the area was cleared off before work began on
House B.
There is good evidence that House B was
destroyed by fire. Overlying Zone V, the upper clay
floor, is a comparatively thick zone (Zone VI) of
carbon-stained sand, with pieces of charcoal scattered throughout. The top of this zone is extremely
irregular; in vertical section it is in places almost
convoluted, and in general the irregularities are far
greater than would be expected in a surface eroded
by runoff. The impression is that of a surface on
which charred sticks and poles were scattered. The
situation is about what one would expect from the
incomplete combustion of a pole and brush structure.
Stage III — Building the Mound
Stage III represents the building of the mound
itself. After House B burned—probably immediately
afterward—sand (Zone VII) was piled over the remains, creating the mound in approximately its
present form. Some of this sand seems to have
filtered down through the charred remains of House
B and contributed to the fill of Zone VI.
There is no evidence of further activity at the
mound following the piling up of Zone VII. The
formation of Zone VIII, the modern humus, in the
top of Zone VII appears to have taken place after
the abandonment of the site.
Discussion
The structures in the Dalton Mound were probably used for ceremonial purposes rather than as
domiciles. If they had been residences, one would
expect a relative concentration of occupational
debris on the floor of each structure. No such concentrations were observed. The whole pattern of
construction and use points to ceremonialism; the
building of one structure directly over the preceeding
one, the destruction of one and perhaps both structures by fire, the covering of the later one by a
68

The Dalton Site, A Late Caddoan Mound Site

mound, and the absence of signs of residential
use, all indicate stylized behavior of a non-utilitarian nature.
In this respect the evidence from the Dalton
Mound coincides with that from the Whelan and
Harroun sites in this same reservoir area, as well as
from the Belcher site about fifty miles to the east
and from a series of sites in southwestern Arkansas. At the Whelan site (Davis 1958) there were
evidences of at least three superimposed non-residential structures within a mound. The last structure was destroyed by fire; the fate of the earlier
ones could not be determined. There were three
other mounds at the site; one of them, a small
sand mound, contained only a fireplace, and the
other two were not investigated. At the Harroun
site (Jelks and Tunnell 1959) there were three
mounds covering remains of burned structures
which had not been used as residences; in the case
of one of the mounds, one such structure was built
directly over the remains of an earlier one. There
was also a small mound at this site which covered
the burial of an adolescent. As discussed later, both
the Whelan and Harroun sites are felt to be closely
related to the Dalton site. At the Belcher site (Webb
1959), large mounds resulted from a series of structures, one above another, each one of which was
burned in connection with funeral rites for important personages. Some of these structures had been
used as residences, perhaps of civil or religious
leaders and their families (ibid., 203–204). They
date from Haley Focus through Belcher focus times.
At a series of sites in southwestern Arkansas,
Harrington found numerous mounds covering the
remains of structures which had been burned
(Harrington 1920, 21–22, 48–49, 50–52, 70–81,
93–94, 96–97, 110–111). Some of these mounds
had burials in them, and others were in mound
groups which included burial and platform mounds.
Krieger assigns many of these mounds to the Haley
Focus (Newell and Krieger 1949, 206–208).
At the more recent end of the time scale, there
is historical evidence for the construction and burning of structures for ceremonial purposes by the
Caddo. Joutel observed, when staying with the
Hasinai in 1687, that an “assembly cabin” was built
as part of the preparations for a war party
...because they make such cabins when they are
preparing for war and have feasts there in order to

The Dalton Site, A Late Caddoan Mound Site

excite the young men to go...these savages did
not reenter their own cabins after the assembly
cabin had been made...(Swanton 1942, 184, quoted
from Margry).
Before setting out on the war party, they

...set fire to their assembly cabin in order to burn it
down, as if it had been made and dedicated merely
to serve on this occasion during a limited space of
time (ibid., 184).

Joutel does not mention the building of
mounds, and mound-building seems to have been
given up by the Caddos before the Europeans appeared (ibid., 154).
In summary, there is archeological and
ethnohistoric evidence for the ceremonial construction and burning of houses by the Caddo, extending from Haley Focus times to the late 17th century.
The occasion for this practice was not always the
same; at the Belcher site, in the Haley and Belcher
Foci, the structures were destroyed as part of the
obsequies for important personages, whereas
among the historic Hasinai the practice is reported
as being part of the ceremonial preparations for
the setting out of a war party.
SUMMARY OF THE HISTORY OF THE
MOUND
The Dalton Mound is an earth covering for
two ceremonial structures which, one after the other,
were built, used, and destroyed. The construction
of the first, House A, involved the digging of a
shallow circular depression about 18 feet in diameter, an operation probably necessitating only the
removal of sod. The earth was spread out around
the edges of the depression. House A, a round pole
structure about 15 feet in diameter with a southwestward-facing entranceway, was built in this depression. A clay floor for this house was laid down,
possibly before the house was built. The fate of
House A is not known; its remains were cleared
before the construction of House B, the floor of
which was just above that of House A. House B
was similar to House A in construction, but slightly
larger. It was destroyed by fire, and later (perhaps
immediately afterwards) earth was piled over the
remains to make the mound. There is no evidence
as to the occasion for these practices, which are
presumed to have been ceremonial.

POTTERY
A total of 1,975 pottery sherds were found at
the Dalton site, of which 1,605 came from undisturbed fill within the mound and directly beneath
it, 225 came from tests outside the mound, and
145 were found on the surface or in disturbed areas. They are tabulated as to stratigraphic provenience in Table 3. The only sherds which might be
directly associated with the time of mound use,
rather than having been thrown in as part of the
mound fill, are those which were documented as
being from Zones III-IV-V. Seventy sherds were so
documented. The actual number of sherds from
these zones is larger, but the documentation of
many specimens is in terms of units larger than
these three zones, as Table 3 shows. It seems likely
that even the 70 sherds documented from these
zones were part of the fill, rather than being the
leftovers of occupation of the structures.
The numbers given the categories in the following descriptions are for cross-reference with
Table 3 and the illustrations.
1. Plain Sherds
Plain sherds number 1,008, or 51% of the
total. Of them, 857 are of brown to tan ware and
151 are of “rust ware” (described below under categories 10A and 10B).
As an experiment, we divided the brown to
tan sherds into dark and light sherds to see whether
the difference in color might have any distributional significance, but it had none whatsoever.
Further, the color difference is only a matter of
accidental variation in firing, probably on the same
vessel in many cases. There were 207 sherds classed
as “dark” and 650 classed as “light.”
A general description of the brown to tan
sherds follows:
Temper: predominantly bone and crushed sherd
or clay, about 50% each.
Texture: mostly smooth uneven; dark-colored
sherds, however, are mostly smooth even.
Color: ranges from extremely dark brown through
orange to very light tan.
Surface finish: smoothed; inside usually
smoother than outside.

The Dalton Site, A Late Caddoan Mound Site

The Dalton Site, A Late Caddoan Mound Site

Wall thickness: at least 90% of sherds are 7
mm. thick; range is 6-8 mm.
Lip form: thickened and rolled out; some are
slightly tapered on interior; a very few direct rims.
Base: only one case noted: flat, circular.
Vessel shape and size: no complete vessels. Rim
sherds mostly too small to tell anything except lip
form (see above). Some reconstruction was possible; in every case the vessel is a carinated bowl
with flaring rim.
2. Brushed Sherds
Brushed sherds, where the brushing is not
combined with some other form of decoration or
surface finish, constitute 394 specimens or 20% of
the total sherds. In general characteristics they are
much like the (brown to tan?) plain sherds. Most of
the brushing is relatively coarse and was done with
some care. For purposes of description they have
been subdivided and tabulated in a number of categories as described below after the general descriptive outline.
Temper: about evenly divided between crushed
sherd or clay and bone; a few rare cases have both
clay and bone.
Texture: medium, rarely granular, occasionally
coarse.
Color: same as plain sherds, q.v.
Surface finish: interior smoothed; exterior roughened by brushing.
Wall thickness: range 6-8 mm., mean about 7
mm., mode 6.5-7.5 mm.
Lip form: slightly to markedly rolled out.
Base form: no information.
Vessel shape and size: no information.
2A. Brushed body sherds
These sherds, 382 in number, have been divided for purposes of tabulation into five groups:
2A-1. Horizontal brushing (Figure 23, L, M).
2A-2. Vertical brushing (Figure 23, N, O).
2A-3. Indeterminate direction of brushing.
2A-4. Brushed in two directions.
2A-5. Fine brushing (Figure 23, P, Q).
The method of determining whether a sherd

E. Mott Davis and Jules R. Gipson

was brushed vertically or horizontally was to observe the fractures to see if there was any breakage along the coil, as indicated by two parallel fractures; or to determine by the use of a rule the
direction of greatest curvature, which was assumed
to be horizontal because of the usual elongated
shape of Caddoan vessels. Where these methods
failed, the sherd was classed as “brushed in indeterminate direction.” Of the brushed sherds, 74%
were indeterminate, 17% were brushed vertically,
and 9% were brushed horizontally. Four sherds
show superimposed brushing in two directions at
an angle to each other. Eight sherds show brushing
lines that are very fine, closely spaced, and shallow.
2B. Brushed rim sherds
Only 11 rim sherds show brushing without
other decorative treatment. Of them, four have
careful horizontal brushing; one has careless diagonal and horizontal brushing, partially smoothed
over; and one small sherd has steep diagonal brushing. The remainder are five sherds from one vessel,
with coarse horizontal brushing.
2C. Brushing in panels
Two sherds show brushing in panels without
other treatment. One is a neck sherd; it is impossible to tell which is the rim and which the body.
One part is brushed horizontally, the other part
diagonally. The other sherd shows parts of two
panels which are carefully brushed at right angles
to each other.
2D. Brushed with appliqué: Pease
Fifty-three sherds show an appliqué fillet or
fillets separating brushed areas (Figure 23, R-T). In
some cases the brushing is parallel to the fillet, and
in others it is at an angle. The fillets, which seem to
have been formed by pinching, range from 2 mm.
wide and 1 mm. high to 10 mm. wide and 4 mm.
high. In about half the cases, the fillets are
punctated. In a very few sherds more than one
fillet is present; in these cases the distance between fillets is from 10-16 mm. and the fillets are
very narrow and low.

The Dalton Site, A Late Caddoan Mound Site

In terms of the established Caddoan terminology, these sherds are assignable to the type
Pease Brushed-Incised (Webb 1948, 110–113;
Suhm et al. 1954, 338).
3. Punctated and Pinched Sherds
Under this heading we describe all those sherds
which have punctation or pinching as a major feature of decoration. In many cases the punctation is
combined with other forms of treatment.
Temper: of the sherds, 80% to 90% are tempered with crushed sherd. The rest are bone tempered.
Texture: mostly smooth even. A few are granular
and uneven.
Color: ranges from black through brown to light
orange.
Surface finish: interior ranges from smooth to
rough. Exterior around punctates is fairly rough.
Wall thickness: range 4-9 mm.; average about 7
mm.
Lip form: most are rolled out; a few are straight.
Base form: no information.
Vessel shape and size: no information.
3A. Punctated-incised
There are 26 sherds in this category, ten of
them from a single vessel. There is not a sharp line
between these sherds and those in the punctatedbrushed category (3B) described below.
3A-1. The vessel represented by the ten sherds
(Figure 23, V) cannot be reconstructed successfully. The sherds, which include three rim sherds,
show horizontal parallel rows of oblique punctates
made with a small round instrument, the rows being separated by two, three, or four carelessly incised parallel lines. The design becomes more irregular near the rim; the highest element, below
the lip, is a horizontal row of punctates. The lip is
direct and flattened.
3A-2. The 16 remaining punctate-incised
sherds include six rim sherds and show different
combinations of punctation and incision (Figure
23, U). There are rows of punctates of different
shapes below the lip, usually with horizontal incised lines below them. Two sherds show groups
of punctates next to an incised line which may be

E. Mott Davis and Jules R. Gipson

the border of a punctated area.
In addition to the 26 sherds described here,
there are seven punctated-incised sherds described
below in category 3D, and two others of the rust
ware, category 7D.
3B. Punctated-brushed
Forty-one sherds show combinations of punctation and brushing. In Table 3 they have been
separated into those with horizontal brushing (3B1; Figure 24, A-C), and those with vertical brushing
(3B-2; Figure 24, E-G).
Nineteen rim sherds show a row of punctates
directly below the lip exterior, with horizontal brushing below. Eight body sherds show vertical brushing and 15 horizontal brushing have rows of
punctates made after the brushing. In most cases
punctates are long and slender, but some are short.
Such brushed-punctate combinations are characteristic of the brushed wares of this area, and may
belong to any number of different types, such as
Pease Brushed-Incised or Bullard Brushed (Suhm
et al. 1954, 252, 338). None of the sherds is large
enough for assignment to a specific type.
3C. Rim sherds with row of punctates below
lip
There are eight of these sherds, much like
those in Category 3A but without brushing (Figure
24, H). The punctates are closely spaced and mostly
direct, i.e., made with the instrument perpendicular
to the surface; a few are oblique. The instrument
was square or round, and about 3 mm. in diameter.
3D. Fingernail punctates
Six body sherds and one rim sherd show fingernail punctates (Figure 24, I, J); all but two show
incised lines. Four sherds show random fingernail
punctates, apparently filling areas bordered by incised lines. Three sherds have punctates in rows,
one (Figure 24, I) is apparently from a small rounded
vessel, with horizontal rows of fingernail punctates
and a horizontal line at the shoulder.

3E-1. Parallel pinched ridges: Killough
Pinched (Figure 24, K, L). Ten body sherds show
this design, made by a thumb-and-forefinger pinch;
in a few cases a two-thumb pinch may have been
used. Specimens are scattered from Zones II to
VII-VIII. Most of the sherds are sherd tempered;
two are bone tempered. Some grit is also present
in the paste. Sherds are black on the interior, dirty
gray on the exterior. Most of them are 5 mm. thick,
76

range being 4-6 mm. The shape of the vessels
cannot be determined. At least two vessels are represented, and possibly as many as five or six.
3E-2. Miscellaneous pinching. Eleven
body sherds, the paste of which is like that of the
Killough Pinched sherds just described, show different kinds of pinched decoration. Some of them
are much like the Killough Pinched sherds. Three
categories can be seen: (1) closely spaced random

The Dalton Site, A Late Caddoan Mound Site

E. Mott Davis and Jules R. Gipson

pinching (Figure 24, N); (2) pinching in rows (Figure 24, M); (3) pinched sherds too small to permit
determination of the design.

and near the top of the mound.

3F. Miscellaneous punctated sherds

A general description of the incised and trailed
sherds is as follows:
Temper: about half the sherds are bone tempered,
and half are tempered with crushed sherd.
Texture: fine to medium.
Color: dark brown to buff; one orange sherd.
Surface finish: mostly smoothed; a few rough.
Wall thickness: range 4-9 mm., mean 7 mm.,
mode 7 mm.
Lip form: mostly rolled out; a few are straight.
Base form: no information.
Vessel shape and size: one partially reconstructed
vessel seems to be a wide-mouthed jar.

Two rim sherds and 26 body sherds show
miscellaneous punctations (Figure 24, O-R). Eight
sherds show punctates in rows; a few of these are
stab-and-drag punctates, whereas in other cases
the punctates have their longest dimension at right
angles to the row. The other sherds, including the
rim sherds (one of which has a node), have random punctates; some are slender, some round, some
oblique, and a few are vertical.
Also to be noted under this heading are two
randomly punctated sherds of rust ware, mentioned
below under Category 7D.
4. Appliquéd Sherds
In this category are listed sherds with appliqué
fillets as the dominant feature. Other appliquéd
sherds are described under Category 2D.
4A. Appliqué fillets with incisions and
punctates: Pease
Four sherds have appliqué fillets with
punctates along the sides and an incised line, parallel to the fillet, bordering the punctates on each
side. One sherd shows random body punctates,
and another shows parallel incisions 8.5 mm. apart
parallel to the fillet (Figure 24, S). Another sherd is
like the last-mentioned but with the fillet hatched
with transverse incisions (Figure 24, T). The sherds
are assigned to the type Pease Brushed-Incised.
4B. Appliqué ridges in a design: Harleton?
Three small eroded sherds have parallel ridges
about 7 mm. apart. On one sherd enough is present
to show a design of concentric circles (Figure 24,
U). These sherds seem to belong to the type
Harleton Appliquéd (Suhm et al. 1954, 288), a diagnostic Titus Focus type. One of those sherds is
from Zone II, one from Zones II-III, and one from
Zones VII-VIII; their distribution is thus beneath
the mound, possibly in the bottom of the mound,

5. Incised and Trailed Sherds

5A. Wide parallel incisions and trailed lines:
Maydelle?
There are ten sherds with wide incisions or
trailed lines, relatively widely spaced and parallel,
in panels or cross-hatching (Figure 25, A, B). None
are rim sherds, but the pattern is like that on
Maydelle Incised rim sherds (Suhm et al. 1954,
324).
One other Maydelle-like sherd was found, of
rust ware, listed below under Category 7D.
5B. Incised herringbone design: Pease
Eleven sherds have a series of parallel incisions meeting another series at an acute angle,
making a herringbone effect (Figure 25, C, D). The
incisions are narrow, and except in one case are
closely spaced. The series are separated by a low
appliqué fillet on two sherds, and by an incised line
on one sherd. These three sherds are almost certainly of the type Pease Brushed-Incised, and the
other eight sherds very likely belong to this type.
Three other sherds appear to fall into this
category; they are of rust ware and are listed under
Category 7D below.
5C. Vessel with incised panel design
Eight sherds represent the neck and shoulder
area of one vessel, plus several places on the body

(Figure 25, E). No rim sherds are included, although
part of a rim, without the lip, is represented; and
three rim sherds which may be from this vessel are
classed above under Category 3B-1. The design is
incised with a wide instrument, almost like trailing.
On the rim the incisions are side by side and look
like deep brushing, horizontal or slightly oblique.
On the neck are two horizontal zones, 8.5 mm.
apart, or three closely spaced horizontal incisions.
From the lower of these zones, similar three-incision zones drop vertically, or at a steep angle, over
the rounded shoulder. These vertical zones are 6-8
mm. apart. Most of these sherds appear to come
from a clay zone in the northeast corner of sq.
N490/E500 at 97.5-97.0 feet, representing the floor
of one or both of the structures in the mound. It is
possible, however, that they come from slightly
above or below this zone. This vessel, nevertheless, has a good claim to actual contemporaneity
with the use of the structures.
5D. Complicated incised
78

Five sherds, probably all from one vessel, show
a design which is best described as “complicated
incised” (Figure 25, F). The sherds are light brown
sherds with no visible temper and a fine paste.
Basically the design is two-directional, being made
up of parallel bands, 7-8 mm. apart, of three or
four closely spaced incised lines, with the intervening areas hatched with closely spaced diagonal incised lines which may have been made before the
parallel bands were cut across them. This vessel is
related in design to that described above as Category 5C. The sherds were widely scattered in the
fill.
5E. Miscellaneous incised sherds
Seventy-six sherds are classed as miscellaneous incised. Eight are rim sherds, all but two
having a slightly out-rolled lip. Two have a horizontal incised line at the bottom of the roll; three have
many horizontal incisions below the lip, as if the
neck area were filled with them (Figure 25, G); two

The Dalton Site, A Late Caddoan Mound Site

(from one vessel) have closely spaced vertical incisions extending down from the lip roll, evidently
part of a design of zoned incisions (to judge from
one other sherd present from the same vessel);
and one sherd has, in addition to the horizontal
incision below the lip roll, a short diagonal incision
as if it were part of a repeated design.
Of the 69 miscellaneous incised body sherds,
21 show parallel incisions, mostly closely spaced;
two are cross-hatched, and the rest merely show
parts of incised lines.
5F. Trailed sherds
These 12 sherds are distinguished by designs
of broad incisions made with a blunt instrument.
They are discussed here under two headings.
5F-1. Closely spaced diagonal parallel
trailing down from lip. Six sherds, two (and
perhaps all six) being from this same vessel, show
this design. One rim sherd (Figure 25, H) shows
that the trailed lines form a zone with a diagonal
edge. This is one of the rim designs characteristic
of Caddoan utility ware in this area.
5F-2. Miscellaneous trailing. Six sherds
show parallel trailed lines, much like the incised
ware from the site. One neatly executed example
might be from a Keno Trailed vessel (Suhm et al.
1954, 310). One trailed sherd was clearly of the
type Maydelle Incised and was put in that category,
no. 5A.
6. Red Ware
Thirty sherds are classed as red ware, in the
sense of having a red pigment applied to one or
both surfaces. We have differentiated them into
“red wash,” in which the pigment is extremely thin,
and “red slip,” in which it is about 0.5 mm. in thickness. A general description of the sherds follows:
Temper: about 50% of sherds have bone temper,
40% have crushed sherd, and 10% have sand.
Texture: mostly medium to medium coarse;
some—i.e., the five slipped sherds—are very fine.
Color: paste color as in plain sherds; surface color
varies from brownish red to blood red. The pigment is blood red.
Surface finish: smooth, except for one sherd
which shows a slight polish.

E. Mott Davis and Jules R. Gipson

Wall thickness: range 5-10 mm.; red wash sherds
average about 6 mm.; others about 8 mm.
Lip form: rolled out; a few straight.
Base form: no information.
Vessel shape and size: one sherd is from the
rim of a bottle; otherwise no information.
6A. Red wash
Ten sherds, many of them badly eroded, have
a very thin red wash. Five (tabulated as 6A-1) have
pigment on both surfaces and appear to be from
different vessels. One, a rim sherd from a bowl or
jar, shows two horizontal engraved lines. The other
four, including a rim sherd from a narrow-necked
bottle, have no alteration of the surface.
Five other sherds, tabulated as 6A-2, show
red wash, much eroded, on the exterior only. Four
of them, and possibly all five, may be from the
same vessel. There is no engraving or other surface modification.
6B. Red slip, engraved
Five body sherds, four of them probably from
the same vessel, show a thick red slip on the exterior. The slip is about 0.5 mm. in thickness. On one
sherd the slip is almost entirely eroded away. All
the sherds show fragments of engraved designs of
the sort expected on Ripley or Taylor Engraved
pottery.
6C. Probable red wash or slip
There are 15 sherds with red surfaces which
probably are washed or slipped, but there is some
doubt as to the nature of the coloring, which might
be the result of firing.
Five engraved sherds related to this category
are described below under Category 12D.
7. Rust Ware
We have separated a group of 197 sherds,
about 10% of the total collection, because of their
distinctive red color, a result of firing rather than
being caused by the addition of a slip or wash.
7A. Plain, bone temper
79

E. Mott Davis and Jules R. Gipson

In 90% of these 78 sherds the color is red
throughout the sherd; the remaining 10% have a
dark gray core.
7B. Plain, sherd temper
In all cases these 73 sherds have a dark core.
7C. Brushed

Four sherds, from at least two vessels, have
unusual roughened exteriors (Figure 25, J). One of
the sherds is a large neck and rim sherd with slightly
flaring rim and out-rolled lip. The surface is roughened by an unknown technique. We tried duplicating the pattern in clay by stamping and rolling with
a corncob, but the results were inconclusive.
10. Perforated Ceramic Discs

Of these 28 sherds, only three or four have
bone temper, the rest have sherd temper. The brushing seems to be vertical in most of the determinable cases.
7D. Incised or punctated
Three rust ware sherds are trailed, one being
a rim sherd of the type Maydelle Incised. One sherd
shows random brushing with a line of short incisions, possibly belonging to the type Pease BrushedIncised. Two sherds show zoned incisions, possibly
being of the Pease type. Two sherds show random
body punctations, and two show a combination of
punctation and incision.
7E. Engraved
Eight rust ware body sherds, of which two are
bone tempered and six are tempered with crushed
sherds or clay, show some engraving. Three are
large enough to suggest that the designs fall in the
general Ripley-Taylor Engraved category discussed
below as Category 12B. It is not possible to determine the shape or size of the vessels represented.
8. Peaked Rims
There are six small rim sherds with the lip
turned out at an angle in two cases, curved out in
three, and indeterminate in one. In each case the
lip is brought to a peak. One specimen has part of
an engraved or excised design on the body, and
another has parallel incising on the exterior of the
lip. One has vertical punctations or incisions on the
lip exterior with irregular horizontal brushing below
(Figure 25, I). Three are smoothed and plain.
9. Roughened Sherds
80

The Dalton Site, A Late Caddoan Mound Site

Two perforated ceramic discs are represented
by three sherds. One disc, from Zones II-III, is
complete and is from the side of a Pease BrushedIncised vessel (Figure 25, K). It has an appliqué
fillet down the middle and an incised or brushed
design on either side of the fillet. The other disc,
represented by two sherds from Zones III-VI, is of
plain ware with bone temper.
11. Sherds with Indeterminate Design,
Not Engraved
Eighty-eight sherds are too fragmentary or
eroded to permit determination of the nature or
technique of the design which can be seen faintly
on them. Most of the work is probably done by
incision. Some of it might be brushed. Four of the
specimens are rim sherds.
12. Engraved Sherds
Engraved sherds constitute only 3.7% of the
total sherds found, there being 72 specimens. For
the most part they are very small fragments, less
than 40 mm. in maximum diameter, without enough
of the design showing for specific type identification. A general description follows:
Temper: mainly crushed sherd; a very few show
some bone temper, and there are five sherds (Category 12D below) showing grit and shell temper.
Texture: medium to fine; a few are medium coarse.
Color: pale tan to tan, and gray to gray-black.
Surface finish: carefully smoothed, and in a few
cases burnished. Many are eroded so that a burnished surface, if originally present, would not have
survived.
Wall thickness: range 4-7 mm., mode 5-6 mm.;
one exceptional sherd is 8 mm. thick.
Lip form: mostly rolled out; see Category 12E

The Dalton Site, A Late Caddoan Mound Site

below.
Base form: no information.
Vessel shape and size: bottle and bowl sherds
are present; otherwise no information.
12A. Circles with central element: Ripley
Engraved
Five specimens have engraved circles with a
circle or cross in the center (Figure 23, A). The
motif is a standard element of Ripley Engraved
pottery (Suhm et al. 1954, 346).
12B. Ripley or Taylor Engraved, or related
types
Most of the identifiable engraved sherds—30
specimens—fall in this generalized category (Figure 23, B-H). In effect, we are here identifyng attributes rather than types.
Five sherds show groups of curved lines in a
“cursive curvilinear” style (Figure 23, B, C). The
technique is like that of Poyner Engraved (Suhm et
al. 1954, 342–344), but the motifs suggest either
Ripley Engraved or Taylor Engraved (ibid., 360), or
might even be found on vessels of the type Wilder
Engraved (ibid., 366).
Seven sherds are shoulder sherds of bottles
(Figure 23, D). They show concentric lines and
some hatched bands encircling the neck.
Eighteen sherds show fragments of motifs—
parallel lines depending from other lines (Figure
25, E, H), lines meeting at angles (Figure 25, F),
narrow cross-hatched bands, and other less easily
definable motifs—which are believed to be parts of
the designs on Ripley Engraved or Taylor Engraved
vessels, but some of which might be from related
types such as Wilder Engraved or Hodges Engraved
(Suhm et al. 1954, 296–298). In some cases the
lines are filled with red pigment.
Five additional engraved sherds of red ware
have been described above under Category 6B.
12C. Zoned punctates, engraved
One rim sherd from a bowl (Figure 23, I) from
Zone VI-VII, shows a slanting panel of closely
spaced punctates engraved below the rim, bordered by an engraved line just below the lip and

E. Mott Davis and Jules R. Gipson

another line slanting down from the lip. The pointed
tip of a similar adjoining panel is also present. Traces
of white pigment remain in the punctations and
lines. The surface is chocolate brown and has been
burnished. In form the sherd is characteristic of
Titus Focus engraved sherds, such as those of the
Ripley Engraved type, but it is somewhat heavier,
being 8 mm. thick. The specimen was found in a
level which included parts of Zones VI and VII.
Zoned punctations of this sort are frequent
on the bodies of Titus Focus bottles, particularly
those of the types Bailey Engraved (Suhm et al.
1954, 240), Wilder Engraved, and occasionally Taylor Engraved; and Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks illustrate a punctate design on the body of a Ripley
Engraved vessel, presumably a bowl (Suhm et al.
1954, Pl. 58, O). However, zones of punctations
are not to be expected on bowl rims of this focus,
so that the present instance is quite unusual. Actually, a rim design of this sort is more characteristic
of bowls of the type Pennington Punctated Incised
of the earlier Gibson Aspect (ibid., 340); but because of the shape of this sherd and the use of
engraving rather than incision, it may represent a
Gibson Aspect design used by a Titus Focus potter.
One other sherd, which is quite small, shows
a group of engraved punctations. It cannot be assigned to any type.
12D. Curvilinear hatched bands, shell temper: Hudson Engraved?
Five sherds, probably from the same vessel,
are distinct in the Dalton site collection (Figure 23,
J). They were scattered from Zones II to V-VII.
The material is a redware, akin to Category 6C
above, but the exterior surface is dark gray, the red
being visible below it in the broken cross sections;
the interior surface is rusty red to red-brown-gray.
The paste ranges from slightly sandy to medium in
texture. Temper is a small amount of crushed rock
or other grit, plus a scattering of shell temper. The
shell has leached from many places on the exterior
surface, leaving a fine pock-marked appearance.
Otherwise the surface is well-smoothed, and is
engraved with a crude design of bands about 6
mm. wide, composed of two bordering lines with
diagonally hatched interior. The design appears to
be a spiral; in some places it is rectilinear, and in
81

E. Mott Davis and Jules R. Gipson

other places curvilinear.
Of the established Caddoan types, these sherds
most closely fit the type Hudson Engraved (Suhm
et al. 1954, 304) except that on Hudson sherds the
cross-hatching is said to be very fine, whereas on
the present sherds it is crude and erratic, and in
some places absent entirely as if it either were not
finished or had been smoothed over.
Two features of these sherds have particular
significance. The presence of shell temper is a clear
indication of influence from the north and northeast in relatively late prehistoric times. The curvilinear band design is a sign of influence from northwestern Louisiana, where it is found on such pottery types as Maddox Engraved (Suhm et al. 1954,
320), Hudson Engraved, and—with longitudinal
dashes in the bands—Belcher Engraved (ibid., 244).
12E. Fine engraving on rim sherds
Three sherds with direct lips show fine undulating engraved lines below the lip, the lines being
ticked in one case (Figure 23, K).
12F. Miscellaneous engraved sherds
Twenty-seven sherds are put in this residual
category. Seven of them are rim sherds, all with
out-rolled lip and at least one horizontal engraved
line immediately below the lip roll. Twenty are body
sherds. Some have single engraved lines; some
have parallel lines; one base-and-body sherd has
fine lines. None of these specimens is distinctive,
and all fit into the Titus Focus context suggested
by most of the other sherds.
DISCUSSION OF THE POTTERY
Table 3 presents the stratigraphic provenience
of the pottery categories just described. This table
shows no significant difference in stratigraphic distribution among the descriptive categories. In a
case like Category 12D, where five sherds probably
from a single vessel are scattered from Zones II to
V-VII, the table gives evidence of the historical
unity of the collection.
In Table 4, the descriptive categories with
particular significance, in terms of the problem of
cultural relationships, are grouped into eight typo82

The Dalton Site, A Late Caddoan Mound Site

logical categories, and these eight are, in turn,
brought together into three larger groups according to their bearing on the problem of relationship
to the Titus Focus. There are 191 sherds involved,
and 15 descriptive categories.
Sherds Diagnostic of Titus Focus
There are five sherds definitely of the type
Ripley Engraved and three of Harleton Appliqué,
totaling 0.41% of the total collection. In such small
numbers their presence might indicate that they
are trade sherds or otherwise intrusive, except for
two factors to the contrary. The first of these factors is that the five Ripley Engraved sherds have
been selected out of a much larger group of sherds
(Category 12B, discussed below) which cannot be
assigned specifically to a given type, but belong to
Ripley Engraved, Taylor Engraved, or related types.
Only these five sherds are unquestionably of the
type Ripley Engraved, but there are certainly a number of others in the larger category which must
have come from Ripley Engraved vessels. The second factor is that Harleton Appliquéd, although a
diagnostic type for the Titus Focus, is, in the authors’ experience, never a common type in that
focus, and would not be expected to occur in large
numbers in a Titus Focus collection. However, in a
typical Titus Focus site one might reasonably expect considerably more than 0.15% of Harleton
Appliquéd sherds. In summary, then, Ripley Engraved is probably a significant type at the Dalton
site, whereas Harleton Appliquéd probably is not.
Sherds Characteristic of Titus and
Related Foci
In this group, making up 5.37% of the total
collection, are 106 sherds which for the most part
cannot be assigned to specific types, and whose
attributes are common not only in Titus Focus but
also in other related foci such as the Frankston
Focus and the Texarkana Focus. Logically, this group
could be expanded to include most of the collection not included in Table 4, since the plain sherds,
the miscellaneous sherds, and most of the rest of
the sherds are generally characteristic of the Fulton
Aspect complexes in this area. The sherds being
discussed here, however, are of a nature which

some other similar types such as Hodges Engraved.
Five of the sherds, probably from one vessel,
83

E. Mott Davis and Jules R. Gipson

are probably of the type Hudson Engraved. They
are the only shell-tempered sherds in the entire
collection. The Hudson Engraved type is characteristically a historic Caddoan type from sites on the
Red River in northeastern Texas and in the eastern
Caddoan area (Suhm et al. 1954, 304). Suhm,
Krieger, and Jelks (1954, Plate 36, D) illustrate one
specimen from the Riley site, a Titus Focus site in
Upshur County not far from Dalton, and suggest
that it, together with the Red River specimens, may
be a trade piece “or some other type not yet recognized” (ibid. 304). The subsequent work of Harris
and others on the Red River (Huff 1960; Harris
1960) has not resolved this uncertainty. The occurrence of Hudson Engraved vessels in the Riley and
Dalton sites can well be explained on the basis of
trade. Both because of the type, and because of
the attribute of shell tempering, the presence of
these sherds at Dalton suggests a relatively late
time in the history of the Titus Focus. However,
other evidence to be presented below contradicts
this suggestion. Consequently it may be more reasonable to suggest that shell tempering first reached
the Titus Focus area, in trade specimens, relatively
early in Titus Focus times.
Seventy-two sherds are classed as Pease
Brushed-Incised. Only 11 of them are classed as
“probables” (eight in Category 5B, and three in
Category 7D); for the rest, the identification is felt
to be reasonably sure. In addition there are probably a number of sherds from Pease Brushed-Incised vessels in the general “punctated-brushed”
category (Category 3B) discussed above under
“sherds characteristic of Titus and related foci.” Pease
Brushed-Incised is a type not found in Titus focus
burials. Before the work at Ferrell’s Bridge, its distribution was thought to be limited almost exclusively to the northwestern Louisiana-southwestern
Arkansas area, where it first appeared in the Haley
Focus, reached a peak of popularity in the Bossier
Focus, and died out early in the Belcher Focus (Suhm
et al. 1954, 338; Webb 1948, 110–113; Webb 1959,
144–150, 189 ff.). The work at the Ferrell’s Bridge
Reservoir shows Pease Brushed-Incised to be an
important type along Cypress Creek, since at the
Whelan and Harroun sites (Davis, 1958; Jelks and
Tunnell 1959), as at Dalton, it is a significant type
in a context otherwise dominated by Titus Focus
pottery traits.
84

The Dalton Site, A Late Caddoan Mound Site

SUMMARY
The pottery collection at the Dalton site represents a single complex, as indicated by the stratigraphic scattering of specimens in the several sherd
categories. Most of the material is characteristic of
the Titus Focus as defined by Suhm, Krieger, and
Jelks: sherds belonging to or akin to the Ripley,
Taylor, Bailey, and Wilder Engraved types; Maydelle
Incised sherds; Bullard Brushed and related brushed
and punctated-brushed sherds; and Killough
Pinched sherds. However, the presence of a significant number of Pease Brushed-Incised sherds is
an anomaly as far as the Titus Focus is concerned,
as are also the near-absence of Harleton Appliquéd
sherds and the absence of sherds of the type Belcher
Engraved. Shell-tempered Hudson Engraved sherds,
probably from a single vessel, are believed to represent trade material.
In all these respects, except for the presence
of a very few Harleton Appliquéd and Hudson Engraved sherds, the Dalton site collection is like those
from the Harroun and Whelan sites, and the three
sites can be said to share a common pottery complex.

STONE WORK
There are 89 stone artifacts in the collection
from the Dalton site, of which 72 are of chipped
stone, one is a lump of ochre, and 16 are of ground,
pecked, and/or polished stone.
The quality of workmanship varies widely, from
crude to skilled. In general the work is competent.
Materials used are about 50% foreign quartzites,
cherts, and flints, and 50% local jasper, petrified
wood, and ferruginous sandstone. The proportion
of specimens made of foreign as opposed to domestic materials varies with the general artifact class.
Among the 42 projectile points there are 30 specimens made of exotic materials and 12 of local
materials, a proprotion of 2.5:1 in favor of foreign
materials. Among other chipped stone tools there
are 13 specimens of foreign material and 17 of
local material; here the proportion is 1.3:1 in favor
of local materials. Among the 16 ground, pecked,
and/or polished stone tools, local sandstone was

The Dalton Site, A Late Caddoan Mound Site

used almost exclusively, there being only two pieces
certainly of foreign material.
Five of the specimens were found on the surface of the road south of the mound and hence
may not be related to the site itself. They are a
Bulverde point (Category 5 below), two dart point
fragments (in Categories 18 and 19), and two
gouges (Category 29).
The stone specimens have been grouped into
36 descriptive categories, which are tabulated by
stratigraphic occurrence on Table 5. The category
numbers given are for cross-reference with Table 5
and the illustrations. The fact that in most of the
categories there are very few specimens testifies to
the variety of form found in all of these artifacts.
DART POINTS
1. Gary Typical
Of the five Gary points in the collection, three
(Figure 26, A-C) are classed as Gary Typical, as
defined by Ford and Webb (1956, 52). There is a
distinct size difference between these three specimens and the Gary Small points described below.
All three are made of foreign quartzite. They are
from Zone II, Zone IIo, and the surface.
None of the specimens is complete, but
lengths are estimated at 50-80 mm. Widths are 32,
31, and 26 mm. and thickness 8, 10, and 9 mm.
respectively. The most complete specimen is restored from two fragments which do not fit but
seem certainly to be from the same specimen because of shape and material. As reconstructed its
length is 80 mm.; the stem is 11 mm. long. Both
corners of the stem are broken. The shoulders are
slightly barbed. All three specimens have relatively
slender tapering blades and strong shoulders. One,
a proximal fragment, has a stem which may have
been as much as 1/3 the total length of the specimen.
2. Gary Small
The two Gary Small specimens (Figure 26, D,
E) are complete. Dimensions are 35 x 21 x 7 mm.
and 34 x 24 x 6 mm. In both cases the stem is
about 1/3 the total length, and the shoulders project
slightly beyond the edges of both stem and blade.

E. Mott Davis and Jules R. Gipson

The smaller specimen is made of local yellow jasper; the other is of exotic quartzite. The specimens
are from Zones I and III-VII.
3. Points with Straight to Slightly
Contracting Stem: Maçon
Two specimens in this category (Figure 26, F,
G) are from Zones II-IV and the surface. They
have straight stems, one of which contracts at the
base, and the other is squared. Both specimens are
of exotic materials: quartzite and black flint. One
specimen (R350) lacks the tip; it may have been
more than 80 mm. long. The width is 33 mm. and
the thickness is 10.5 mm. The other specimen
(R112NE) is complete. Dimensions are 65 x 28 x
11 mm. In blade outline these specimens resemble
Gary points, and they are much like a “Gary Variant” illustrated by Ford and Webb (1956, 52, Fig.
17 m). However, they best fit the Maçon point type
of Ford and Webb (ibid, 56, Fig. 18 a–d). The
significance of this situation is that these points
are relatd in form to the Gary point type but are
straight-stemmed.
4. Yarbrough
Three Yarbrough points (Figure 26, H-J) are
of purple-gray fine-grained quartzite. They are from
Zone II, II or V, and VII-VIII. They have triangular
blades and slightly expanding stems with concave
edges. Two have distinct shoulders, and on the
third the shoulders are weak. The blade is alternately beveled to the right in the two distinctly
shouldered specimens. In longitudinal section the
bases are sharply beveled. On one specimen there
is stem edge grinding; the others are not ground.
These specimens conform well to the Yarbrough
type (Suhm et al. 1954, 492). Dimensions are: 42
x 19 x 7 mm.; 40 (estimated) x 21 x 7 mm.; 55
(questionable estimate; much of the tip is gone) x
24 x 7 mm.
One additional stem fragment (R180N) falls
within the Yarbrough range in outline (Suhm et al.
1954, Plate 125, T–V) but differs from the stems
of the three points just described in having parallel
sides.

A single fragmentary specimen (Figure 26, L)
found on the surface of the road south of the
mound, and hence possibly not part of the Dalton
site occupation complex, is like the Yarbrough points
just described in respect to form and material, except that the stem is relatively short, straight, and
narrow, and thins gradually to the base. One shoulder of the blade is slightly barbed. Most of the

blade is missing. This specimen conforms to the
Bulverde type (Suhm et al. 1954, 404), which is
characteristically a Central Texas type. The specimen is striking both in its resemblance to and its
differences from the Yarbrough points just described. Dimensions are: width 27.5 mm.; thickness, 7 mm.; stem length, 9 mm.; stem width at
base, 13 mm.

6. Heavy Point with Expanding Stem,
Straight Base: Lange?
This specimen (R533; Figure 26, K) from
Zones I-IIo, is a thick, heavy point of white chert
with a triangular blade and straight-edged, slightly
expanding stem with straight base. It is most likely
the Lange type as defined by Suhm, Krieger, and
Jelks (1954, Pl. 97, L), but also resembles certain
of their Yarbrough points (ibid., Pl. 125, F). In outline it is much like an East Texas Scottsbluff point,
but lacks the regular flaking of that form, and is
much thicker. Dimensions are 66 x 32 x 13 mm.;
stem length is 17 mm. and basal width is 23 mm.
7. Proximal Fragments, Straight to
Expanding
Two small proximal fragments (Figure 27, I,
J) are parallel or slightly expanding sides and slightly
convex bases. They are from Zones II-III and VIIVIII. They may be parts of stems or may be basal
portions of unstemmed points. One (R61) is 24
mm. wide and 10 mm. thick; the other (R178N) is
21 mm. wide and 6 mm. thick.
A third specimen (R105NW; Figure 27, H),
from Zone II, is a speckled gray flint fragment, part
of a parallel-sided knife or heavy point, lacking the
tip. The length was at least 50 mm.; width is 21
mm. and thickness 9 mm. The specimen shows
coarse but regular percussion flaking on both faces.
The sides are roughly parallel, and are serrated and
sinuous because of the coarse flaking. The blade
edges are alternately beveled to the left. One face
has been flattened by the removal of a longitudinal
flake which seems to have been struck off from the
tip downward, removing the central ridge. All in all,
this is a very unusual specimen, and its significance
is unknown.
8. Proximal Fragments, Possibly of PaleoAmerican Points
Two proximal fragments (Figure 27, K, L) may
be stems, but show features suggesting PaleoAmerican points—basal thinning on one specimen,
regular flaking and slight edge grinding on the other.
One specimen (R105) is from Zone II; it is of gray
chert and is 21 mm. wide and 9 mm. thick. The
90

The Dalton Site, A Late Caddoan Mound Site

other (R350) was found on the back dirt of Excavation D; it is of white chert and is 25 mm. wide
and 7 mm. thick.
9. Reworked Base, Possible Drill; Parallel
Sides, Concave Base
This specimen (R247; Figure 27, M), from Zone
IIo in Trench C, is of red-brown jasper, a material
probably of local origin. Dimensions are 20 x 18 x
5 mm. The basal edges are 6 and 10 mm. long.
The base is slightly concave. The tip is reworked to
a short, sharp point, alternately beveled to the left.
The basal concavity is sharply beveled on one face,
slightly beveled on the other. It is impossible to say
whether this is the former base of an unstemmed
point, or a stem fragment.
10. Point with Narrow Straight Stem,
Concave Base
This specimen (R250; Figure 27, A), from the
southwestern part of the mound but without zone
provenience, is a slender thick point of red-brown
jasper, a material probably of local origin, and lacks
the tip. The fragment is 30 mm. long; width 16
mm., stem width 13 mm., and thickness 8 mm.
The base is markedly convex. Stem edges are
slightly smoothed. This is a slender, thick specimen, bearing a remote resemblance to Pedernales
points (Suhm et al. 1954, Pl. 113, C). In this collection it is quite distinctive.
11. Barbed Points with Expanding Stem,
Convex Base: Palmillas-Williams
Two thick points (R105 and R184NW: Figure
26, Q, R) from Zones II and I-II are irregular specimens with convex-edged blades and expanding
stems with convex bases. They are made of yellow
and yellow-red jasper presumably of local origin.
Dimensions are 50 x 34 x 12 mm. and 49 x 31 x 11
mm. The tips are rather blunt. On R184NW the
stem is rounded and bulbous; on R105 the corners
are rounded and the base is slightly convex. Resemblances are to the Palmillas and Williams types
(Suhm et al. 1954, 462, 490).
There is also a stem fragment (R154) from
Zone I-II, which is rounded, thick, and bulbous,

and seems to have come from a Palmillas-like point.
It is made of gray fine-grained quartzite.
12. Point with Expanding Stem, Slightly
Convex Base
This specimen (R227SE; Figure 26, P), from
Zone I-II, is a coarsely flaked asymmetrical point
made of a poor quality of local petrified wood. The
shoulders are distinct but not quite squared, and
the stem expands slightly, with a slightly convex

base. Dimensions are 35 x 17 x 7 mm.; stem length
is 7 mm., width at neck of stem 13 mm., width at
base 14 mm. This specimen bears some resemblance to Travis points (Suhm et al. 1954, 484).
13. Broken Point with Expanding Stem:
Trinity-Ensor?
This specimen (R180N; Figure 27, B), from
Zone II, is made of yellow petrified wood which is
of better quality than most of the local petrified
91

E. Mott Davis and Jules R. Gipson

wood. It is broken across the base but seems, from
its general outline, to be nearly complete. It may
be that the break is older than the manufacture of
the point. The stem is almost as long as the blade
and is formed by broad shallow side-notches. Dimensions are 25 x 17.5 x 14 mm.; base width is
16.5 mm. Resemblances are with the Trinity and
Ensor types (Suhm et al. 1954, 422, 484–486).

The base is convex and bifacially beveled. Dimensions are 57 x 31 x 11 mm.; length from center of
notches to base, 10 mm.; notch width, 6 and 7
mm.; notch depth, 3 mm. This specimen is like an
Ensor point (Suhm et al. 1954, 422), except for the
convex base and the relatively poor workmanship.

14. Point with Expanding Stem, Concave
Base: Fairland-Like

Two small specimens of varicolored jasper
(R134, R205NE; Figure 27, N, O), from Zones I-II
and III-VI, are bunts which have expanding stems
with concave edges and slightly concave bases,
suggesting that they have been reworked from
Yarbrough points. In each case the distal end is
bifacially beveled to form a convex edge curving
from shoulder to shoulder. R134, the smaller of the
two, is asymmetrical, and one basal corner shows
the original cortex of the rock. Dimensions are 21
x 18 x 7 mm. and 23 x 24 x 8 mm.

This specimen (R105; Figure 26, M), from
Zone II, is a short wide point made on a thin flake
of yellow-brown jasper, a material possibly of local
origin. The blade is triangular with convex edges;
the stem is made by corner-notching, and the base
is convex, producing ears at the basal corners. This
specimen differs from the Edgewood type (Suhm
et al. 1954, 418) in that the stem is relatively shorter
and wider. Dimensions are 27 x 21 x 4 mm. This
specimen is most like the Fairland type, which is a
central Texas type (ibid., 424), except that in Fairland
points the stem is usually as wide as the blade.
15. Point with Expanding Stem, Concave
Base
This specimen (R90; Figure 26, N), from Zones
VI-VII, is a roughly worked point of petrified wood,
a material that is probably of local origin and is
difficult to flake effectively. Nevertheless, the point
is reasonably well shaped. The blade has irregular,
convex edges. The shoulders are indistinct, and
the stem, which is only slightly narrower than the
blade, is formed by shallow broad side notches—
really a constriction of the lower end of the blade.
There is a remote resemblance to the Pedernales
type (Suhm et al. 1954, 468). Dimensions are 32 x
21 x 7 mm.
16. Side Notched Point with Convex Base:
Ensor-Like
This point (R228SW; Figure 26, O), from Zones
I-II, is a large, heavy side notched specimen of
cream-colored chert. It has a long triangular blade
with a blunt tip which seems battered. The flaking
on both faces is irregular, with much step-flaking.
92

17. Bunts, Reworked from Points

18. Dart Point Blades, Stem Missing
One fragment (R13; Figure 27, C), from Zone
VI-VII, is a neat isosceles triangle of purplish-gray
flint. It is alternately beveled to the right, with square
shoulders and enough of the stem remaining to
indicate that it probably had parallel sides. No type
assignment or comparison is possible. Blade dimensions are 31 x 24 x 6 mm.; the stem is 14 mm.
wide.
Another dart point fragment (R81; Figure 27,
D), is from the surface of the road south of the
mound and hence may not be part of the occupation complex at the site. It is a small blade of gray
chert, poorly worked, the tip being alternately beveled to the right. The sides of the stem, as far as
they have survived, are parallel. The blade dimensions are 21 x 18 x 7 m. The dart point stem is 11
mm. wide.
19. Miscellaneous Dart Point Fragments
There are three tip fragments of dart points,
three mid-section fragments, and one base fragment. All are of foreign materials—cherts and finegrained quartzite. The tip fragments are relatively
slender and tapering. The mid-section fragments
are lenticular in cross-section and are 19, 25, and

The Dalton Site, A Late Caddoan Mound Site

27 mm. wide and 6, 9, and 10 mm. thick.
The base fragment (R344) is from the surface
of the road south of the mound, and thus may not
have been made by the people responsible for the
mound. It seems to have been the base of a crude
knife or dart point. There is a wide shallow notch
on one side and a slight shoulder on the other. All
edges show signs of use in the form of tiny stepflaking. The fragment is 21 mm. wide, 11 mm.
thick.

OTHER CHIPPED STONE
22. Miscellaneous Knife Fragments

ARROW POINTS

Four fragments appear to be parts of heavy,
irregular pieces which are assumed to have been
knives. One is local yellow jasper, and the rest are
of exotic flints and quartzites. Three are tip fragments, two of them well-made and one very thick
and relatively crude. One fragment is either a base
or a blunt tip. Three are from Zones I and I-II, and
one is from Zone VI-VIII.

20. Arrow Points, Contracting Stem

23. Heavy Pointed Bifacials

There are two small points with contracting
stems (Figure 27, E, F). Both are from near the
surface, and may well not be part of the artifact
complex of the people who built the mound. Both
are made of exotic materials.
R36 (Figure 27, F), from the sod or just below
the sod (Zones IIo-VIII) at the western edge of
the mound, is a thin flake of fine purplish quartzite,
worked to a slender diamond-shaped blade, with
the proximal end contracting to a squared base. It
is alternately beveled, like a Plains diamond-shaped
knife. Dimensions are 27 x 14 x 3 mm.; length
from shoulders to base along mid-line, 9.5 mm.
R312 (Figure 27, E) from Zone IIo-VIII in
Excavation G, is a pale gray chert specimen which
is like a Scallorn point except that the stem contracts rather than expanding, and has a rounded
base. It is of gray-brown flint and is not very neatly
flaked. Dimensions are 33 x 17 x 6 mm. The stem
width is 7 mm., and the distance from shoulders to
base along the mid-line is 8.5 mm.

Three specimens are heavy, relatively crude
bifacial specimens. One was probably a knife; the
other two could have been used either as knives or
as spear points.
R105, from Zone II, is a crude edged and
pointed specimen of gray quartzite with an irregular stem the base of which is broken. Dimensions
are 31 (estimated) x 26 x 7 mm.
R205NE, from Zone III-VI, is of orange jasper, probably a local material. It is a very rough
triangular blade with a stem which is in part formed
by the natural outline of the rock and in part shaped
intentionally. Only the top and one edge of the
blade have been sharpened, by percussion flaking.
Dimensions are 44 x 35 x 13 mm.
R223NE, from Zone II-III, is a well-made very
thick bifacial of a fine yellowish quartzitic material.
In outline it is roughly diamond-shaped, with one
pointed and one rounded end. It is roughly planoconvex, the ventral (flatter) face being worked with
large flakes and curving upward at the rounded
end of the specimen. The dorsal face has a peak in
the center and a ridge extending from the peak to
the pointed end of the specimen; flakes run from
the edges to the peak and the ridge. A good edge
has been made all around by bifacial percussion
flaking. Dimensions are 49 x 25 x 16 mm.

21. Arrow Point, Straight Stem: Alba
A small point (F264; Figure 27, G) found on
the back-dirt beside Excavation C—the excavation
for the entranceway—is a skillfully worked Alba point
(Suhm et al. 1954, 494, Plate 126, A, B, C). It is
made of yellow-brown jasper, probably of local
origin. The blade forms an approximate equilateral
triangle; the edges are serrated. The base is broken, but probably little more than 1 mm. is missing. Dimensions are 15 (estimated) x 12 x 4 mm.
Stem width is 6 mm. and length of blade is 12 mm.

24. Well Made Small Bifacials
Four specimens (Figure 27, P-S) make up this
group. These are 33 mm. or less in maximum dimension and were used as knives or as scrapers.
R23 (Figure 27, S) from Zone I, is a small
93

E. Mott Davis and Jules R. Gipson

bifacial specimen of local yellow jasper, edged all
around, with the outline of a right triangle. One
side is carefully edged by pressure flaking on one
face, the retouch on the other face being less exact; this was probably the working edge, seemingly designed for scraping. The other side and the
hypotenuse do not seem to have been used; their
edges were formed by a few large coarse flakes.
Dimensions are 23 x 17 x 8 mm.
R44 (Figure 27, R), a heat-spalled or otherwise broken fragment of red-brown jasper, from
Zone II, has a squared end with one good edge
made by bifacial pressure flaking. The most attention was paid to the bevel on one face. It is probably a cutting or scraping tool made on a random
fragment. Dimensions are 29 x 27 x 10 mm.
R179NE (Figure 27, Q), from Zone II, is a
small, thick, well-made bifacial cutting tool with
concave base made by short flute-flakes, rounded
tip, and cutting edge all around. It may have been
a bunt, but is very thick for a projectile point. It is
made of yellow-brown jasper, probably from a local pebble. One face is relatively flat and the other
is humped. On the flat face the flakes are large and
irregular. On the humped face they are smaller and
more carefully executed, going from the edge to
the hump. All edges show fine use-flaking, except
at the concave base. Dimensions are 27 x 17 x 9
mm.; width at base, 10 mm., depth of basal concavity, 1 mm.
R348 (Figure 27, P), recovered from the back
dirt, is a well-made small gouge of orange-brown
jasper, with a central ridge on each face and a
hollowed-out bit at one end. It is widest at the bit
end, with straight edges tapering slightly to a
rounded butt. A low central ridge on the ventral
face (the face not beveled for the bit) is formed by
coarse but regular flakes which extend inward from
the edges. The high ridge on the dorsal face is less
regularly flaked. There is some sign of fine pressure-flaking along the edges, more on the ventral
face than on the dorsal face. The bevel of the bit is
neatly pressure-flaked; there are also some stepflake scars, as if the preliminary flaking were by
percussion. Dimensions are: length 33 mm.; width
at bit 18 mm.; width at butt 13 mm.; thickness 11
mm.
25. Poorly Made Small Bifacials
94

The Dalton Site, A Late Caddoan Mound Site

These specimens are 11 crude random pieces
with edges made by bifacial percussion flaking. Four
are made from local jasper pebbles, five from dark
petrified wood probably of local origin, and two
from exotic gray quartzite. Only two are intentionally shaped. These specimens constitute rough
knives and chopping tools. Most of them come
from the lower levels of the mound. The largest
specimen is 51 mm. long.
26. Flake Scraper
R134NW, from Zone I-II, is a slender oval
flake struck from the outside of a jasper pebble.
One long side is unifacially worked to a scraping
edge, the final edge being made by pressure flaking. Dimensions are 35 x 17 x 5 mm.
27. Utilized Flakes
Three flakes, of exotic material—chert and fine
quartzite—are detritus from the manufacture of
other artifacts, and also show signs of edge use.
They are from Zones II, II-V, and VII-VIII.
28. Crude Bifacials
There are two very coarsely flaked heavy flakes
of exotic flint and fine quartzite, from Zone II. It is
not certain that they have been used. Maximum
dimensions are 56 and 60 mm.
29. Gouges
Two ferruginous sandstone gouges (Figure 28,
E, F) of the general “Clear Fork” category, were
found on the surface of the road south and southeast of the mound. Since such items are limited to
pre-ceramic complexes, as far as present evidence
goes, they are probably not part of the artifact
complex of the people who built the mound. One is
roughly triangular in outline, the other rectangular.
Both specimens are coarsely but skillfully flaked,
and both show some polish on the face opposite
the gouge bevel. Dimensions are 71 x 42 x 21 mm.
and 63 x 35 x 17 mm.

Numerous flakes (not tabulated) were found
in the mound fill. They are all percussion flakes
varying from 3-14 mm. in thickness and from 15 to
43 mm. in maximum dimensions.
Twenty-nine broken pebbles, of which six are
not cataloged, are in the collection. They represent
local pebbles from which flakes have been struck,
or which have been broken in half, and are presumably the waste from the manufacture of small
chipped stone artifacts. Maximum dimensions range
from 26-50 mm., and minimum dimensions from
9-20 mm.
An even larger number of unbroken pebbles
was found in the course of work. It is not certain
whether any of them have any cultural significance.

30. Ochre
A small irregular piece of ferruginous sandstone from Zones VI-VII has a bright red ochre
stain which rubs off easily. Whether it is of cultural
significance cannot be determined.

men is from Zones III-V and hence, like the vessel
described in pottery Category 5C, may very well be
contemporaneous with the use of the houses.
32. Pitted Stones
Six cobbles of ferruginous sandstone show
one, or more usually two, small pits pecked in the
surface (Figure 28, A, B). Four are from Zone II
beneath the mound; two are from Zone IIo outside the mound. In all but one case the pits have
been pecked in a face which has been smoothed,
and the stones may have served a combined function as mullers and pitted stones. Maximum dimensions of these pieces range from 57-111 mm.
The pits range in diameter from 10-45 mm. and in
depth from 1-6 mm.
33. Mullers-Pitted Stones
Two sandstone specimens, from Zones I-IIo
and I-II, are rectanguloid pieces with rounded corners, the opposite faces being ground flat or slightly
convex, and the edges pecked and ground smooth.
A very shallow pit—actually just a pecked area—
can be indistinctly seen in one face of each. These
pieces are presumed to have been grinding stones
held in the hand, and to have been used occasionally as anvils. One specimen is complete and measures 115 x 86 x 53 mm.; the other (Figure 28, C)
is broken; it is 74 mm. wide and 38 mm. thick.
34. Possible Grinding Stone Fragments
Four ferruginous sandstone fragments have
one or more faces which may have been ground.
They are too small for their nature as artifacts to be
certain. They were found scattered from Zones II
through VII.

The Dalton Site, A Late Caddoan Mound Site

steep bevel and a blunt point, and one large shallow scar on the other. Whether this specimen is a
celt fragment, subsequently altered, or is in large
measure natural, it is impossible to say. In any case
it must have been brought to the site by man.
Dimensions are 68 x 56 x 30 mm.
36. Large Pieces of Uncertain Function
Two large specimens are of uncertain significance. One, R253, is from a sand lens within the
red clay of Zone I, under the southern edge of the
structure within the mound. It is a block of ferruginous sandstone, triangular in cross-section, on
which one face seems to have been smoothed to a
slightly convex surface. There seems to have been
shaping of the specimen by percussion flaking.
Dimensions are 89 x 72 x 39 mm.
The second problematical piece, R249, is a
block of light-colored crystalline material, which may
have been burned. It is from Zone II underneath
the western part of the mound. It is square in cross
section and roughly rectangular in longitudinal section, with one end somewhat pointed. It may have
been partially pecked to its present shape, but is
too rough to tell. It could have been used as a
hammerstone. Dimensions are 112 x 57 x 50 mm.
Miscellaneous Sandstone Pieces
Many pieces of native ferruginous sandstone
(not tabulated), ranging from little nodules 20 mm.
in diameter to large blocks more than 100 mm. in
diameter were encountered at random in the fill. If
they have cultural significance, we have not been
able to determine it.
SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION OF STONE
ARTIFACTS

35. Possible Celt Fragment

Summary

R105 (Figure 28, D), from Zone II near the
center of the mound, is a piece of hard ferruginous
sandstone, oval in cross-section, with roughly parallel sides. One end is a flat face with slightly rounded
edges, as if the face might be intentional rather
than an accidental break. The other end is altered
by two large flake scars on one side, producing a

There are 89 stone artifacts from the Dalton
site; 39 dart points and dart point fragments, three
arrow points, four knife fragments, 20 miscellaneous bifacials, one flake scraper, three utilized
flakes, two chipped gouges, one piece of ochre,
one polished slate fragment, eight pitted stones of
which two were also used as mullers, four grinding

The Dalton Site, A Late Caddoan Mound Site

stone fragments, one possible celt fragment, and
two large pieces of unknown function. Foreign varieties of stone were used in about half the specimens, and are found most commonly in the projectile points. The gouges, a Bulverde dart point,
and two dart point fragments may well not be part
of the site complex, since they were found on the
surface some distance away from the mound.
The dart points are mainly Gary and related
points, Yarbrough points, and various expandingstem points. No category is represented by large
numbers: Yarbrough is the largest, with four.
Function
When we look at this collection in terms of its
functional significance, the small number of stone
artifacts is notable. This is a trait common to many
Fulton Aspect Caddoan sites. One suspects that
stone work was less important to these people than
to many of their contemporaries elsewhere on the
continent. It is probable that they used a good deal
of wood and bone, which have not survived.
By far the most numerous class of specimens
is that of projectile points, making up almost half
of the total. This circumstance presumably reflects
the importance of hunting in the life of these people,
hunting being the only means of obtaining meat.
The grinding tools are probably related to the use
of wild or domesticated seed products. Why no
milling stones were found is a puzzle, in view of the
mullers in the collection. Possibly the lower elements of the grinding pair were made of hard wood.
Items with Possible Stratigraphic
Significance
For the most part, the specimens are so scattered among the several stratigraphic zones that
the categories do not have stratigraphic significance. A few categories, however, may have such
significance, and they will be discussed here.
Almost all of the dart points with expanding
stems or side notches come from zones earlier than
the mound. These are the eight specimens in Categories 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 16. It must be remembered that there were a good many pottery
sherds under the mound also, of categories the
same as those within the mound, so that there

E. Mott Davis and Jules R. Gipson

might be no chronological significance to this distribution. However, in the case of the expandingstem points only one specimen, and that a rather
individualistic one (Category 15) was found in the
mound; the rest were all underneath it. This circumstance leads one to suspect that Palmillas-Williams, Ensor-like, Trinity-like, Lange-like, Fairlandlike, and related expanding-stem points actually
are older than the time this site was occupied. On
the other hand, Gary and related points and
Yarbrough points appear to be an integral part of
the artifact complex of the Dalton Mound people.
There are only three arrow points from the
site, as opposed to 39 dart points. Two of the
arrow points were found in or just under the sod;
the third, an Alba point, was found on the back
dirt. It is possible the occupants of this site did not
use arrow points at all, and that the points were
made and left here after the site was abandoned.
The Alba point—the only specimen of a specific
type—is of a type most characteristic of Gibson
Aspect complexes, but is also found in the Bossier
Focus of the Fulton Aspect (Suhm et al. 1954, 197,
494). Since this specimen was found on the back
dirt, little can be said of its chronological significance. The whole question of the use of arrow
points, as opposed to dart points, by the prehistoric Caddoans of this area, is a puzzling one which
we will touch on again briefly later.
The polished slate fragment described as Category 31 was associated with Zones III-V and hence
may have been left in place at the time of the use
of one of the houses. Since we believe the structures to have been ceremonial in function, it is
possibly significant that this slate fragment was
probably from a non-utilitarian artifact. However, it
must also be kept in mind that it could have been
thrown in as part of the mound fill.
The eight pitted stones in the collection, two
of which are also mullers, come from zones earlier
than the mound. Specimens like these are common in Caddoan sites of all ages, and we suspect
that their absence in the mound itself may be a
matter of selectivity on the part of the original occupants: if an Indian were scooping dirt to add to
the mound, he might reject objects as weighty as
these stones, in order that his load would not be
unnecessarily heavy. The presence of two grinding
stone fragments in the mound fill does not weaken
97

E. Mott Davis and Jules R. Gipson

this suggestion, as these fragments were small.
Cultural Relationships
There is relatively little published information
to draw on concerning the stone artifacts from
Fulton Aspect Caddoan sites in this area, but two
matters of significance can be noted.
First, the collection from the Dalton site is
much like that from the nearby Harroun and Whelan
sites (Davis 1958; Jelks and Tunnell 1959), both as
to types and as to their frequencies. Specifically,
the stone artifact forms which seem to make up
the complex common to these sites are Gary and
related contracting-stem dart points, relatively small
bifacial tools often made from pebbles, pitted
stones, and mullers. Perdiz arrow points are probably part of the complex as they were associated
with the other traits at Harroun and were present
at Whelan, although there were none at Dalton.
Expanding-stem dart points were found at all three
sites, but their stratigraphic position at Harroun
and Dalton suggests that they may be earlier than
the other materials; at Whelan the information is
uncertain. Yarbrough points are absent or insignificant in number at Whelan and Harroun, but present
at Dalton. Like the other expanding-stem points,
they might pre-date the general artifact complex at
the three sites.
Second, in view of the ceramic evidence for
relationship with the Titus Focus, it is striking that
no Talco, Bassett, or Maud arrow points, which are
typical of the Titus Focus (Suhm et al. 1954, 193),
were found in the Dalton site—or, for that matter,
in the Harroun and Whelan sites. Actually, all documented discoveries of these points have been made
in graves, and the local pot-hunters know them as
“Burial Points.” In terms of present evidence (which
is quite incomplete because no extensive Titus Focus
occupation site has been excavated as yet) these
points are part of a burial complex only, and in
such case one would not expect to find them in
occupation fill such as went to make the Dalton
Mound. It is hard to believe that these people would
have restricted the use of the bow and arrow to
ceremonial practices; but at present there is no
evidence that they hunted with projectiles other
than those tipped with what we consider to be dart
points.

The Dalton Site, A Late Caddoan Mound Site

Summarizing the matter of cultural relationship, then, the Dalton site stone artifacts are like
those of other Titus Focus-like sites in the Ferrell’s
Bridge Reservoir area—the Whelan and Harroun
sites—with which there are even more specific similarities in ceramic traits. There is an absence of
diagnostic Titus Focus stone artifact types, a circumstance which could be due to the difference
between artifacts found in burials (all the “classic”
Titus Focus sites are cemeteries) and those found
in occupation fill such as seems to have gone into
making up the Dalton Mound. It could also be due
to an actual cultural difference, and this is the conclusion indicated by the ceramic evidence.

SUMMARY, DISCUSSION, AND
CONCLUSIONS
SUMMARY
The Dalton site is a mound about 55 feet in
diameter and 2.5 feet high, covering the remains
of two circular pole structures which were built,
one after the other, in a shallow depression, using
the traditional Caddoan technique in which a center-post was employed as a working platform and
removed when the structure was complete. Evidence for a central fireplace is inconclusive. Each
structure had an entranceway extending southwest.
In the case of the last structure, at least, clay daub
was used in the construction. The later structure,
and perhaps the earlier one as well, was destroyed
by fire. The mound fill contained pottery sherds
and artifacts, derived from an occupation area the
location of which was not determined, although it
may be the same as a site some 600 feet away.
The pottery collection is essentially the same
as that from the Harroun and Whelan sites, in which
characteristic Titus Focus types (Ripley and Taylor
Engraved, Maydelle Incised, Bullard Brushed) are
accompanied by a significant number of Pease
Brushed-Incised sherds. The stone artifacts are
relatively few in number and include Gary and related contracting-stem points, Yarbrough points,
expanding-stem points of several types which seem
to be earlier than the general occupation of the
site, three arrow points (an Alba point is the only

The Dalton Site, A Late Caddoan Mound Site

recognizable type), a group of relatively small bifacial tools, two Clear Fork gouges which are probably not part of the local complex, and a few pitted
stones, mullers, and grinding stone fragments.
FUNCTION
At the Dalton site, it appears that people built
circular structures for ceremonial purposes and
subsequently destroyed them, and that ultimately
they erected a mound over the ruins of the last
structure. As we have seen earlier the same customs are manifested at the Harroun and Whelan
sites, which have much the same artifact complex
as Dalton, and also at the Belcher Mound in Louisiana and at a number of sites in southwestern
Arkansas. What might have been the reason for
these practices?
Mounds in the eastern United States were
nearly all built either in connection with burials or
as substructures for ceremonial buildings, or for
both reasons. Of the Caddoan mounds we have
just mentioned, the Belcher Mound seems to have
fulfilled both functions. But at Harroun, Whelan,
and Dalton, as well as in a number of Harrington’s
sites in southwestern Arkansas, the function of the
mound itself is obscure, as no burials were associated with the mound and the structures were underneath the mound, not on it. At these sites, then,
the reasons for erecting the mound are not known.
In regard to the ceremonial construction and
burning of houses by the Caddo, we have noted
earlier two cases where the occasion for the practice is known. At the Belcher Mound the houses
were destroyed in connection with burial rites, and
among the historic Hasinai—in the case recorded
by Joutel—the custom was part of preparations for
war. Both of these circumstances are of significance to the whole society; and we note that even
where we do not know the reason for destroying
the house, as in the case of the sites at Ferrell’s
Bridge, a sizeable group of people must have been
involved, since the ceremonial complex included
the building of a mound, a task involving the cooperative effort of an appreciable number of people
when done by hand. Thus we may presume that
the Dalton Mound and similar sites represent the
activities of larger groups than, say, single biological families.

E. Mott Davis and Jules R. Gipson

Furthermore, where we know the occasion for
building and burning the house, the situation—
death, or imminent warfare—was in both cases one
containing some degree of anxiety. It may be conjectured, then, that when the Caddos built a house,
used it ceremonially, and burned it down, they were
following a traditional reaction to a particular kind
of unsettling situation. As a hypothetical example,
if it were felt that there was danger of spiritual
contamination in connection with an event of importance to the group, it might be considered safest to carry on the attendant ceremonies in a special structure which could afterward be “sterilized,”
as it were, by burning it down. No such specific
rationale has been documented for the Caddos, as
far as we know, but there is one recorded indication of the use of fire and smoke in treating the
possessions of the dead (Swanton 1942, 210, quoting Parsons).
The most we can justifiably hypothesize is
that the burned structures within the Ferrell’s Bridge
mounds area represent the repeated enactment of
a ceremony of importance to the local group, a
ceremony the emotional context of which included
some element of anxiety. The occasion for the ceremony—whether a death in the group, war, or something else—is not known. If it was a death, the
body must have been removed to some other spot
for interment, since no burials have been found
directly associated with these structures.
CULTURAL RELATIONSHIPS
We have seen that the Dalton site shares most
of its significant traits with the Harroun and Whelan
sites, not only in its pottery but also in its stone
artifacts and in the trait of mound-building over
burned ceremonial structures. We have also seen
that the trait complex represented at these three
sites is very much like that manifested in local Titus
Focus sites, but that it diverges from the Titus
Focus in a few significant respects. Both of these
matters will now be reviewed.
Relationship to the Whelan and Harroun
Sites
The Dalton, Whelan, and Harroun sites are
characterized by low mounds covering the remains
99

E. Mott Davis and Jules R. Gipson

of circular structures which were used ceremonially
and ultimately destroyed by fire. At Dalton the
entranceways of both structures extended southwest, whereas at Harroun the entranceways of the
structures extended west in three cases and southeast in one case. At the Whelan site no entranceways
were found, but the evidence was inconclusive in
this respect. A burial was found at the Harroun site,
but not in connection with the houses. No burials
were found at Dalton and Whelan. At Whelan a
residential house was next to a mound, and what
was probably a granary was nearby. No evidences
of residence were found at Harroun or at Dalton,
but the fill of the Dalton Mound contained occupational detritus, and it may be presumed that an
occupational area was not far away, possibly the
one which was found about 600 feet distant.
The pottery from the Harroun, Whelan, and
Dalton sites makes up what is essentially a single
ceramic complex, the differences being minor. This
complex includes characteristic Titus Focus types:
Ripley Engraved, Taylor Engraved, and related engraved materials; brushed ware assignable to the
general category Bullard Brushed; and Maydelle
Incised. It also includes Pease Brushed-Incised
pottery, not a characteristic Titus Focus type.
Harleton Appliquéd, a diagnostic Titus Focus burial
type, is absent at Whelan and Harroun and is represented only by three sherds possibly of this type
at Dalton. Belcher Engraved, often found in Titus
Focus sites in this area (Suhm et al. 1954, 192), is
absent at Dalton and Harroun, and in the Whelan
collection there are only three sherds out of almost
15,000.
The stone artifacts from the three sites are
also quite similar. In each case they constitute a
small fraction of the total artifact complex. Gary
and related contracting-stem dart points are certainly part of the complex, as demonstrated at
Harroun and indicated at Dalton and Whelan. Expanding-stem dart points seem to be earlier than
the main occupation of the site at Dalton, and may
also be early at Harroun (although a possible
Palmillas point was associated with one of the
Harroun houses); their stratigraphic provenience
at Whelan is not reported. Four Yarbrough points
were present at Dalton, but there was only one at
Whelan and none were found at Harroun. Perdiz
arrow points were definitely associated with the
100

The Dalton Site, A Late Caddoan Mound Site

occupation complex at Harroun, and very likely were
at Whelan where the evidence is less definitive, but
were not found at Dalton.
We have, then, three components of a single
complex which, for the sake of this discussion, we
will call the Whelan complex after the site where it
was first found and at which it is most richly represented. (In using the generalized term “complex”
we are intentionally avoiding implications as to the
place this group of traits may occupy in some taxonomic hierarchy.) The Whelan complex is characterized by the following traits: mounds built over
the burned remains of circular ceremonial structures with entranceways whose orientation is not
consistent from house to house; pottery of Ripley
Engraved, Taylor Engraved, and related engraved
types, Maydelle Incised, Pease Brushed-Incised, and
brushed sherds including Bullard Brushed; Gary and
related contracting-stem dart points; probably Perdiz
arrow points; small bifacial tools; pitted stones;
and mullers.
Relationship to the Titus Focus
The next problem is that of the relationship of
the Whelan complex to the Titus Focus. Jelks and
Tunnell (1959, 59) have listed five divergences of
the Whelan complex from the Titus Focus: the presence of Perdiz points, Pease Brushed-Incised pottery, and mounds, and the absence of Harleton
Appliquéd pottery and Talco points. To this list it
seems valid to add the absence of Belcher Engraved pottery, a frequent Titus Focus type in this
part of the Titus Focus area.
These differences must be viewed in the light
of the fact, already noted, that the Titus Focus as
generally defined is exclusively a burial complex.
All the Titus Focus sites which have been investigated have been cemeteries. It is therefore to be
suspected that the current list of characteristic Titus
Focus traits, as given, for instance, by Suhm, Krieger,
and Jelks (1954, 191 ff.), is actually a selected
list—selected aboriginally, by virtue of the special
circumstances under which the artifacts were left
behind. One might expect, then, that a general
artifact inventory of the same culture might show
divergences from the presumably more specialized
burial complex.
The question is, whether the differences be-

The Dalton Site, A Late Caddoan Mound Site

tween the Whelan complex and the Titus Focus are
due to such purely functional considerations as
these, or whether some other factor, such as change
in time, might enter in. Jelks and Tunnell have suggested (1959, 59–60) that both factors, time and
function, probably are involved in the differences.
It is our feeling, however, that time—culture
change—is the chief factor involved here. Function, it is true, is an adequate explanation for the
presence or absence of mounds; but the use of
Perdiz points as against Talco and Bassett points,
and the presence or absence of pottery types such
as Pease Brushed-Incised, Harleton Appliquéd, and
Belcher Engraved cannot, in our minds, be adequately explained on a functional basis.
Examining first the differences in arrow point
styles, we note that Talco and Bassett points are
usually found in Titus Focus burials (Suhm et al.
1954, 193), whereas in the Whelan complex the
only certain type is Perdiz, the association of which
was demonstrated at the Harroun site (Jelks and
Tunnell 1959, 57). Perdiz and Bassett points are
related, the only difference being in the length of
the stem, and intermediate specimens are known.
However, the Perdiz points from the Harroun site
(ibid., Fig. 15, O–R) are in no sense intermediate,
and could not be confused with the short-stemmed
Bassett points. One such Perdiz point was found at
Harroun in the only burial yet documented for the
Whelan complex; in this burial it was associated
with two Ripley Engraved vessels. No ready functional explanation is apparent for the use of a Perdiz
point in this burial, as opposed to Talco, Bassett, or
occasional Maud points which are found in “classic” Titus Focus burials. Our feeling is that the difference in point types must reflect culture change
in time. In view of the evidence for a relatively
earlier date for the Whelan complex, as reviewed
below, we offer the hypothesis that Perdiz points
are ancestral to Bassett points in this area, the
latter developing from the former through reduction of the stem. Moving further into the realm of
conjecture, it is possible that the stemless Talco
and Maud types derived from the Perdiz-Bassett
group through complete elimination of the stem.
These are speculations, but they are suggestive
enough to indicate the need for a detailed study of
projectile point variations in the late Caddoan complexes of this area.

E. Mott Davis and Jules R. Gipson

More striking than projectile point differences,
because manifested by much larger numbers of
specimens, is the presence of Pease Brushed-Incised pottery in the Whelan complex and its absence in the Titus Focus. Jelks and Tunnell (1959,
59) have noted that the known distribution of Pease
Brushed-Incised in the Haley and Bossier Foci suggests that the Whelan complex might be earlier
than the classic Titus Focus sites. To us this conclusion is inescapable. Trade sherds point to the
contemporaneity of the Titus and Belcher Foci
(Suhm et al. 1954, 194; Webb 1959, 206). At the
Belcher site, clear stratigraphic evidence shows that
Pease Brushed-Incised was a popular type before
Belcher Focus times and died out early in Belcher
Focus times, whereas Belcher Engraved is a later
type, overlapping with Pease only in the early Belcher
Focus (Webb 1959, 145). Under these circumstances, it seems very likely that the Whelan complex, in which Pease Brushed-Incised is a significant type and Belcher Engraved is noticeably absent, must be earlier than the Titus Focus, in which
the reverse situation holds true. The 50 miles which
lie between the Ferrell’s Bridge Reservoir and the
Belcher site do not constitute a great enough distance to permit a marked difference in the chronological range of these types in the two areas, particularly in view of the many other traits that are
found in both places, signifying fairly constant contact.
It also seems unlikely to us that the absence
of Pease Brushed-Incised pottery from Titus Focus
burials would be due to functional causes —that is,
to a feeling on the part of the Titus Focus people
that Pease Brushed-Incised pottery was not the
sort to be put into burials. A great range of pottery
styles—plain, brushed, punctated, incised, engraved—is found in Titus Focus burials, and there
is nothing apparent in the nature of the Pease type,
other than its specific decorative motifs, which sets
it off from these others in any way. Furthermore,
amateurs have found burials in this area with Pease
Brushed-Incised vessels associated with Titus Focus types (Jelks and Tunnell 1959, 59). These may
well be Whelan complex burials. If so, these burials
and the one at Harroun indicate rather strongly
that the differences between the Whelan complex
and the Titus Focus are not primarily functional in
nature.
101

E. Mott Davis and Jules R. Gipson

CONCLUSIONS
The Dalton site is a component of what we
have called here the Whelan complex, which is also
represented at the Harroun and Whelan sites. All
these sites contain mounds built over burned structures, a phenomenon believed to result from ceremonies associated with events involving some
apprehension and distress on the part of the group.
The Whelan complex is closely related to the local
Titus Focus, which heretofore has been known only
from burials. The Whelan complex sites are believed to date from an earlier time than the Titus
Focus burials, rather than being simply another type
of site created by the same people. It is reasonable
to suppose that the people responsible for the
Whelan complex were the immediate ancestors of
the Titus Focus people. How much time is involved
here is not known.
A taxonomic question remains, one brought
up by Jelks’ and Tunnell’s suggestion that the distinctive Whelan complex traits “be added to those
previously recognized for the Titus Focus” (Jelks
and Tunnell 1959, p. 61). In other words, Jelks and
Tunnell feel that the Titus Focus should be expanded to include what we have been calling here
the Whelan complex. Is this inclusion justifiable?
To us it is—as long as one does not take too seri-

102

The Dalton Site, A Late Caddoan Mound Site

ously the concept of “focus” as some sort of sharply
distinguished cultural entity. Ideally a focus is a
static, descriptive concept, whereas here we are
dealing with the problem of change in time. However, if “Titus Focus” is used to designate a particular segment of cultural development as distinguished
from others, a segment which does not have sharp
boundaries in cultural history, then it is a useful
term to apply in clarifying one aspect of Caddoan
prehistory. Similarly, the term “Whelan complex”
should be useful for the present, until more of the
details of Titus Focus history have been worked
out. When that happens, it may well be that the
Whelan complex will blend into other facets of the
Tiutus Focus so gradually that the use of a distinguishing term will obfuscate rather than enlighten,
and it will then be time to drop the term. Archeological terminology is an essential tool which must
be treated as a servant, not as a master.
In brief, it seems most useful to include the
Whelan complex, as represented at the Whelan,
Harroun, and Dalton sites, in the Titus Focus, by
expanding the definition of the latter as Jelks and
Tunnell have suggested. The differences between
the Whelan complex sites and the Titus Focus burials probably mean that the former date from an
earlier time than the latter.

ABSTRACT
The Ben McKinney site is a prehistoric cemetery and occupation area in western Marion County,
Texas, which was excavated by a University of Texas-National Park Service field party in the fall of 1957.
There were evidences of at least 11 burials, of which three were excavated and fully documented by the
field party, five were dug by local members of the Texas Archeological Society, and the remaining three
were indicated by scattered evidences. The grave goods are typical of the Titus Focus, a late Caddoan
complex of this area, as it has been defined in the literature. The occupation area was small and the
artifact collection from it is not fully definitive, but it is in all likelihood part of the same component as the
burials. The occupation complex does not include Pease Brushed-Incised pottery, and this absence makes
it probable that the local Whelan complex sites (Whelan, Harroun, and Dalton), which do have Pease
pottery, are not contemporary functional variants of the Titus Focus, but represent a different period in
Titus Focus development. The work at the McKinney site represents the first full documentation of Titus
Focus burials, and the first systematic investigation of a Titus Focus occupation area.

FOREWORD
The archeological project reported here was carried on by the authors in the fall of 1957 at the
Ferrell’s Bridge Reservoir (now the Lake O’ the Pines) in Marion County, Texas, for The University of Texas
and the National Park Service.
Our project was strongly supported by people in the area around the Ferrell’s Bridge Dam, and we
are grateful to them. The staff of the U.S. Corps of Engineers at the Dam were especially cooperative, in
particular the following: H. W. Fletcher, Project Engineer; O. L. Stafford, Assistant Project Engineer; John
A. Whitson, Realty Officer; W. S. Alsop, Chief Inspector; W. R. Thomas, Clearing Inspector; and Miss
Margaret Ramsay, Clerk. Other people to whom we are indebted for their help are Mr. and Mrs. John S.
Moseley, R. R. Nicholas, Robert L. Turner, the late Edward M. German, and L. C. Scudday.
The men on the field crew worked diligently despite mud and cold, and on their efforts depends the
basic merit of the project. August Love, Laborer Foreman, and Jon Loomis, student laborer, had much to
do with the success of the work, as did the other laborers—Loss Sloan, Walter Casey Jones, Lloyd Sloan,
Gayland Robinson, Otho Robinson, Robert Brockman, and John Johnson.
We also acknowledge indebtedness to Dr. T. N. Campbell, Chairman of the Department of Anthropology, The University of Texas, and Edward B. Jelks and his staff of the Texas Archeological Salvage
Project for continued support in field and laboratory.
The illustrations in the report were prepared by Jules R. Gipson and Edwin N. Wilmsen. The manuscript was typed by Mrs. Pat Bess. To these three a profound debt of gratitude is owed, for work above
and beyond the call of duty.
The authors jointly carried on the field work reported here, but have had different shares of the
preparation of the report. Davis has been in general charge of the project. Golden served as Assistant in
the field, and was in charge of the field work in Davis’ absence, which was frequent. In the laboratory,
Golden was responsible for all processing, and for the arduous and painstaking job of restoring and
recording all the pottery vessels, a job never before undertaken for a Titus Focus collection as far as we
know. The analysis of the vessels is Golden’s ; that of the sherds and other artifacts is Davis’. Golden was
called away to other employment before being able to complete his part of the work to his own satisfaction, and Davis must accept responsibility for any flaws in the final form of the report.

The Ben McKinney Site, A Titus Focus Site

INTRODUCTION
This report is one of a series dealing with
archeological salvage investigations at the Ferrell’s
Bridge Reservoir on Cypress Creek, northeastern
Texas. It covers work done at the Ben McKinney
site (41MR12) in the autumn of 1957, by a field
party sponsored jointly by the Department of Anthropology of The University of Texas and the
National Park Service.
The Ferrell’s Bridge Reservoir (now the Lake
O’ the Pines) is on Cypress Creek, a major western
tributary of the Red River, which flows into the
latter at Shreveport, Louisiana. The Ferrell’s Bridge
Dam is in Marion County, Texas, about 60 miles
airline west-northwest of Shreveport and about 10
miles west of Jefferson (Figure 29). The countryside is rolling and heavily wooded. Detailed descriptions of the environment and history of this
area may be found in other reports of this series (in
particular, Davis 1958; Jelks and Tunnell 1959).
Aboriginally this was in the territory utilized
by certain groups of Caddo Indians. There are no
records of Caddos actually living in this part of
Cypress Creek Valley in the time since the first coming of the Europeans, although they doubtless
hunted in this area; but the archeological record
makes it clear that in prehistoric times they did live
in the area.
HISTORY OF ARCHEOLOGICAL WORK
Field parties from The University of Texas and
the National Park Service worked at the Ferrell’s
Bridge Reservoir beginning in January, 1957, and
ending in October, 1959, carrying on seven excavation projects in that time. The work reported
here was the second such project. Others have
been reported elsewhere (Davis 1958; Jelks and
Tunnell 1959; Davis and Davis 1959; Davis and
Gipson 1960).
Previous archeological work in this part of Texas
took place in the 1930s, mainly by The University
of Texas (Goldschmidt 1935; Jackson 1933, 1934;
Pearce 1932, 51–53). This early work took the form
of excavation of several of the prehistoric burying
grounds which are extremely numerous in this countryside and which, because of the abundance of

E. Mott Davis and Bernard Golden

artistic pottery in the graves, have long attracted
the enthusiastic attention of shovel-wielding relichunters. On the basis of finds made in the 1930s,
Krieger later distinguished a burial complex called
the Titus Focus, named after Titus County where
many of the sites are located (Krieger 1946, 205–
247 passim; Suhm et al. 1954, 189–195).
The Titus Focus is attributed to ancestors of
certain of the historic Caddo, and is estimated to
date in the vicinity of A.D. 1200–1500. As defined
in the sources cited above, it is a burial complex
characterized by large numbers of Ripley Engraved
and Taylor Engraved vessels, and lesser numbers
of vessels of the types Harleton Appliquéd, Bailey
Engraved, Bullard Brushed, Maydelle Incised, and
LaRue Neck Banded. Frequently, vessels of types
native to areas farther east and north, such as
Hodges Engraved, Glassell Engraved, Simms Engraved, Belcher Engraved, and Keno Trailed, also
occur in the graves. Talco and Bassett points, and
petaloid celts, are also characteristic. The sites are
relatively uniform in content, and no subdivisions
of the focus as it has been defined have been suggested.
For many years, the Titus Focus was the only
ceramic complex recognized in the area extending
west and northwest from the present location of
Ferrell’s Bridge Reservoir. The first salvage work in
the reservoir area, however, changed this situation.
This first work was at the Whelan site (Davis 1958),
which turned out to be like the “classic” Titus Focus sites excavated in the 1930s in respect to most
of its artifact content, but different from them in
having mounds, evidences of pole structures, and
Pease Brushed-Incised pottery in significant
amounts. The Whelan site also lacked such characteristic Titus Focus traits as Talco points, Bassett
points, and Harleton Appliquéd pottery. Whether
these differences were to be attributed to the nature of the site—a mound and occupation site as
contrasted with the classic Titus Focus sites, which
are cemeteries—or actually indicated that the Whelan
materials represented a different time phase of Titus
Focus, or signified something else, could not be
determined.
THE PRESENT PROJECT
Such was the situation at the time the project

described in the present report began. It was our
intention, in this project, to sample intensively a
number of sites in the reservoir area in the hope of
finding another site like the Whelan site, and possibly also a classic Titus focus cemetery which might
have an associated occupation area. In this way we
might hope to learn more about the nature of the
relationships between these two types of sites.
We began with an intensive reconnaissance,
which very fortunately turned up both types of
sites, notably the Harroun site which, superficially
at least, resembled the Whelan site, and the
McKinney site which, judging from the work of
local amateurs, was a classic Titus Focus site. There
were also other sites almost as promising.
As so often happens, our systematic plans for
unraveling a particular segment of Caddoan cultural history were drastically changed by external
circumstances—in this case, the weather. Not long
after the beginning of field work in the fall of 1957,
heavy rains began to fall, and they continued in
extraordinary volume for many weeks. Although
the work of building the reservoir was not complete, the reservoir partially filled up. The Harroun
site went under water, as did all the other sites we
intended to look into except for the McKinney site,
which was at the edge of the valley, within the
flood pool area of the reservoir but out of reach of
the waters which were rising at this particular time.
Therefore, we perforce devoted ourselves exclusively to the McKinney site, and that site is the
subject of the present report.
Fortunately, later on the lake went down again,
and as part of another project Edward B. Jelks was
able to work at the Harroun site, which did turn out
to be closely related to the Whelan site. A report on
the Harroun site has since been published (Jelks
and Tunnell 1959).
The purpose of the work at the McKinney site
was twofold. First, we wanted to document exhaustively some Titus Focus burials, since no one
had done so before and the record, both published
and unpublished, was inadequate for detailed analysis. Second, we wanted to find and excavate a
Titus Focus occupation area; this also had never
been done, and was needed in order to determine
something of how the Titus Focus people lived,
and whether their everyday artifact complex might
be the same as that found at the Whelan site.

E. Mott Davis and Bernard Golden

We were partially successful in achieving these
objectives. Although the rains prevented our excavating more than three burials, those three are fully
documented and the record on them makes up the
major part of the present report. We also found an
occupation area; but unfortunately, it was so small
and so disturbed by cultivation that relatively little
was learned from it. However, the material did not
appear to be the same as that found at the Whelan
and Harroun sites.
In sum, thanks to the work at the McKinney
site a beginning has been made in the task of properly documenting the burial complex of the Titus
Focus; but the problem of the nature of everyday
Titus Focus materials, as distinct from the burial
complex, still remains largely unexplored.

THE SITE
LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION
The Ben McKinney site (41MR12) is on a hillside at the southwestern edge of the Cypress Creek
valley about 8 miles airline upstream (west-northwest) of the Ferrell’s Bridge Dam. It is in the western part of Marion County, about 500 feet south of
where the old road from Ore City to Jefferson drops
into the valley. It is 6 miles east of Ore City by this
road. Coordinates for the site are: N32o47’23”,
W94o38’12” (U.S. Corps of Engineers 1950, Sheet
6).
The site (Figure 30) is on both sides of a
minor dirt road leading south from the old Ore City
to Jefferson road. It is on a hillside facing north
and east, on the west side of the valley of a small
creek which is a tributary to Cypress Creek. There
was formerly a small farmhouse at the top of the
hill on the north side of the road. It burned down
in 1950. The elevation at this highest part of the
site is approximately 248 feet above sea level, just
below the elevation of the Flood Control Pool of
the reservoir. From here the land slopes gently eastward toward the small creek, about 350 feet away,
dropping some 20 feet in that distance until it
reaches a broad level area—called the “low terrace”
in this report—which is the lowest major terrace
above the small creek and is an extension of the

The Ben McKinney Site, A Titus Focus Site

main Cypress Creek flood plain, here some 3 miles
wide. Next to the little creek itself there is a narrow
lower terrace and below it a very narrow and discontinuous flood plain.
Midway down the slope on the north side of
the road is a relatively level area 50-75 feet in
diameter. This is the location of the burial area
which is the major feature of the site. About 150
feet to the south of the road, at the same elevation, is a small occupation area. These two areas
make up the site proper.
The road goes eastward down the hill through
the southern edge of the burial area and then curves
southward. It has been cut about a foot below the
surface by grading and erosion. Evidences of other
roadways, indicated by refilled ruts, are to be found
in the site, and one very deep abandoned road cut
is just west of the site. Doubtless it has been necessary to relocate the road periodically because the
relatively heavy rainfall keeps turning it to mud and
eventually the ruts become too deep. These numerous roadways, including the present one, have
disturbed parts of the burial area.
All of the site was under cultivation in the
past. At the time our work began, however, it had
not been cultivated for at least 5 years, and was
covered with a dense growth of tall weeds and in
places by scrub trees.
When excavations began, the Corps of Engineers had recently acquired the land as part of the
reservoir area, from the heirs of the Morrow Estate.
Ben McKinney, after whom the site is named, was
one of the Morrow heirs who had farmed the land
in the recent past.
STRATIGRAPHY
The soil profile at the site is formed in sand,
underlain by red clay. The highest zone is the plow
zone, a humus-stained sand averaging 0.5 feet thick,
which contained many objects of modern manufacture as well as Indian specimens. Below it is
brown sand, ranging in color from gray-brown
through light brown (the usual color) to orange.
The lower part of this brown sand is mottled with
reddish clay, and eventually the brown sand gives
way downward to the lowest zone, the red clay,
which underlies this entire area and extends downward to an unknown depth.

E. Mott Davis and Bernard Golden

The top of the underlying red clay varies
markedly in depth from the surface. At the top of
the hill, test pits 6 feet deep failed to reach the clay.
On the low terrace the tests showed clay within 1.5
feet of the surface in some places, but elsewhere
on the terrace tests 2.5 feet deep did not reach the
clay. In the burial area the red clay was between
1.5-2 feet below the surface. In the vicinity of the
occupation area it was less than 1 foot below the
surface, and in some places was at the surface.
These latter shallow occurrences seemed due to
hillside erosion caused by cultivation.
It will be noted on Table 6 that stratigraphic
provenience is recorded in terms of distance below
the plow zone, rather than below the surface. This
procedure was followed in compiling the table because the vagaries of cultivation and erosion had
so affected parts of the site that depth from the
surface seemed to have little meaning. However,
now that analysis is complete and the table has
been made, it seems unlikely that matters have
been clarified by this practice, since in most cases
the figure for depth below plow zone is, in effect,
simply the figure for depth below surface less 0.5
feet
HISTORY OF WORK
The McKinney site was first recorded by E. H.
Moorman and E. O. Miller on February 7, 1951, in
the course of their preliminary reconnaissance of
the reservoir area for the River Basin Surveys (Miller
et al. 1951). The house on the site had recently
burned down, and in an adjacent garden plot Miller
and Moorman found one engraved sherd and one
plain clay-tempered base sherd. There was no other
evidence of an archeological site. The reason that
Miller and Moorman looked here, and then listed
the spot as an archeological site, was simply that it
seemed a very likely spot to them. Those who have
walked in the footsteps of Miller and Moorman, as
the authors did at Ferrell’s Bridge, have gained a
hearty respect for the archeological sense of smell
of these two reconnaissence men.
In September, 1957, R. R. Nicholas of
Daingerfield, an amateur archeologist, noticed while
driving past the site that a pottery vessel had been
exposed by a road-grader at the side of the road
cut. He and a co-worker, the late Edward M. Ger-

man of Lone Star, dug one burial here shortly afterwards.
On October 5, 1957 the authors, with August
Love and Jon Loomis, visited the site as part of the
intensive reconnaissance mentioned earlier. Although well acquainted with Mr. Nicholas, we did
not know of his discovery then, and were simply
following all the leads provided by the survey report of Miller and Moorman. Finding evidences of
recent investigations, we soon learned who was
responsible for them, and thanks to the full information provided by Messrs. Nicholas and German
we were able to learn the probable nature and significance of the site, and to determine that it merited intensive investigation.
Preliminary testing took place on October 11,
1957. Regular excavation (Figure 31) began October 21 and continued through December 23, with
occasional interruptions because of protracted rains.
The total crew varied in size from six to nine men.
The first work was done in the burial area.
Test trenches were used in hunting for burials, but
the work was much impeded by increasingly heavy
rains, and since the burial area was relatively level
it held water more than the rest of the site and
quickly became muddy. Our work was also impeded
by a number of refilled ruts in the southern part of
the burial area, which confused the picture badly
and made us quite uncertain as to the nature of
what we were finding. After about 2 1/2 weeks of
intermittent work in the burial area conditions became so muddy that we had to give up work there
entirely and devote our energies to a search for an
occupation area.
This search was carried on by digging test
pits 5 feet square and test trenches some of which
were 3 feet wide and others 5 feet wide. We began
by working northwest to the top of the hill, which
seemed the most logical area for occupation, but it
turned out to be mostly an occupation area for the
recent farmers. We then tested southward across
the road, finding only scattered sherds there. Next
we dug trenches southeast of the burial area to the
road, and eastward from the burial area across the
low terrace. Meanwhile an extensive series of small
test pits was being dug over a more widespread
area. None of this work produced more than an
occasional piece. Finally, 10 days before the end of
the project, we dug an east-west trench on the

E. Mott Davis and Bernard Golden

hillside south of the burial area; and in that trench
we found the occupation area.
Meanwhile, the rains had let up enough to
permit resumption of work in the burial area, where
we were eventually able to excavate and document
three burials before the season ended.
During the latter part of our investigations we
had a number of visitors at the site, and news of
our findings spread over the countryside. Once we
had completed our work and had left the site, a
cloud of relic-hunters descended upon it with probes
and shovels. For some reason they seem to have
had relatively poor luck. Upon learning about these
depredations, the Corps of Engineers put up signs
which inhibited further looting. At our suggestion
the most competent local amateurs, Messrs. Nicholas and German and their co-worker, Mr. Robert L.
Turner of Pittsburgh, found, dug, and documented
four more burials, the positions of which are noted
on Figure 32. It is striking, and sobering to us, that
these additional burials were for the most part located within the area where we worked, but were
not detected by us. This circumstance is due in
part to the wet conditions under which we operated, which made it difficult to detect soil differences, but it is probably also due to our inexperience in the investigation of burials in this region.
We heard a number of reports of burials having formerly been found at the site, and there was
one old pit just west of our burial area excavations,
where a grave had evidently been plundered. A
local farmer who visited the site showed us where
he recalled seeing pots washing out in erosion gullies
many years before, about 100-50 feet east of the
burial area. Our tests there, however, produced no
evidence of burials. We also heard indirectly that
one of the former occupants of this farm visited
our diggings on a Sunday, when we were not there,
and later remarked that we were working in entirely the wrong place; the area where they used to
plow up pots, he said, was some distance away
down the hill. Unfortunately this intelligence reached
our ears on the last day of our work, and there was
no opportunity to hunt down the man, who had
moved many miles away. It is presumed that this
information signifies that there is another burial
area in the vicinity, perhaps several hundred yards
northeast of our burial area on the low terrace,
beyond the reach of our tests.

TECHNIQUES OF INVESTIGATION
The grid was laid out with a transit, working
from an initial base point stake which was called
N100/E500; that is, 100 feet north and 500 feet
east of the assumed origin of the grid. It was thought
that in this way the entire site would fall within the
northeast quadrant of the grid. However, the work
eventually took us also into the southeast quadrant (an undesirable circumstance because the abbreviation “S” for “South” is often indistinguishable, in handwritten field notes, from the number

“5”). Vertical control was also by transit, based on
an arbitrary elevation of 100 feet above site datum
for the top of the base stake. According to the
topographic map of the reservoir (U.S. Corps of
Engineers 1950, Sheet 6), the base of this stake is
between the 235 feet and 240 feet contour lines.
Stakes were placed on grid points as needed,
using transit and steel tape. Within the burial and
occupation areas, precise measurements from stakes
were made with steel tape and plumb bob.
The digging was done with square-ended
shovels, which function well in the East Texas sand.
119

E. Mott Davis and Bernard Golden

Fine work was done with trowels and smaller tools.
The earth was screened through 1/2- or 1/4-inch
mesh screens except in the case of the long test
trenches, in which screening was done only in test
squares every 25-50 feet along the trench.
All the digging was done by 1/2-foot levels,
except within the burial pits themselves. In the test
trenches and test pits the levels were measured
from the surface, the elevation of which, with relation to site datum, was determined by transit. In
the burial and occupation areas the levels were
measured from the site datum.
The excavation in the burial and occupation
areas was done by squares 5 feet or 10 feet on a
side. All specimens were sacked and recorded by
5-feet square and level.
Extensive records were kept in the form of
individual record sheets for levels and features. The
written record was supplemented by numerous
sketches, scale drawings, and photographs. A topographic map was also made of the site (Figure
30).
Two of the burials were cored out as pits,
once the outline was clear. Reference pins were
placed at each end of the pit and measurements
were made from them. (It would have been just as
practical to make all measurements from grid
stakes.) As described on later pages, the burial pits
seem to have extended up to the plow line, but
they were not always clear that high, and in the
case of Burial III the outline was uncertain enough
so that we were never able to core the pit, but had
to dig the whole area by levels, recording the probable horizontal outline at each level as we went
down. The position of each artifact within the burial
pits was measured and drawn precisely. There was
no skeletal material in the pits, presumably because it had decayed, so that there was no problem of skeletal documentation.
Most of the vessels in the graves either were
badly cracked or were shattered. It was necessary
in the laboratory to do an extensive job of restoration and repair, the results of which may be seen in
the latter part of this report.
As has already been noted several times, the
work was seriously affected by the weather. When
the rain became too frequent, the burial area became so muddy that it was impossible to trace
burial outlines or detect other structural features. A

120

The Ben McKinney Site, A Titus Focus Site

similar difficulty was encountered late in the season when the weather turned cold; one morning
when we left for work the temperature was 15oF.
As the sun rose on these frosty days, the ground
thawed and, as it thawed, became muddy. The
whole situation was impractical for fine work, and
at such times we had to limit our efforts to digging
test trenches, an activity that had the advantage of
helping to keep people warm. Fortunately the cold
weather abated, and during the final two weeks
conditions were for the most part good for properly detailed excavation, observation, and documentation.

THE BURIAL AREA
MOUND A
The burial area was a relatively level spot on
the hillside, somewhat over 50 feet in diameter.
Evidences of 11 burials are known to us. Two were
discovered before our work: the remains of a burial
which Mr. Nicholas found torn up by the road grader,
and a burial later dug by Nicholas and German. The
remaining nine are shown on the plan (Figure 32):
three which we dug (Burials I-III); four which Nicholas and German excavated after our work (Burials
IV-VII); the northeast-southwest line of artifacts
which we found in the southern part of the burial
area and which must signify at least one grave;
and the old pit just west of our excavations where
someone had evidently looted a burial in the past.
More extensive work under better conditions might
well turn up other burials, and several may well
have been destroyed by the road.
The orientation of the graves was from approximately east-west to northeast-southwest.
There was no skeletal material in the graves, a
common circumstance in this area as bones decay
quickly and are absorbed into the soil. In the absence of bones, there was no indication in any of
the graves as to which way the head lay.
The three graves which we dug, Burials I, II,
and III, appeared to extend up to the plow line,
and it is not certain from which surface they were
originally dug. They seem to have been at least 2.5
feet deep. The outline of Burial III was never clear,
but Burials I and II showed up in the excavation

The Ben McKinney Site, A Titus Focus Site

floor as oblong areas contrasting with the surrounding brown sand because of the many particles of
red clay in the grave fill. As soon as we were reasonably sure of the outline, work proceeded by
removing and screening the grave fill, recording
the positions of all specimens, and drawing vertical
sections of the long and transverse axes of the
grave. We found it advantageous to probe cautiously ahead of our work with a chaining pin about
1 foot long, whence this procedure enabled us to
determine whether we were likely to run into a
specimen soon and allowed more rapid work when
the pin detected no specimens ahead. The probing
was done with care and no breakage resulted, but
it is not recommended as a substitute for meticulous excavation, since small specimens such as arrow points can easily be disturbed or missed entirely, and in the latter case will be found on the
screen rather than in their original positions. This
sort of probing is, however, a useful measure when
time is short.
Burials I, II, and III are described below, following which the rest of the materials found in the
burial area are described.
BURIAL I
Burial I (Figure 33; 34, top), which had the
field designation Feature 444, was roughly rectangular in outline. It was 9.4 feet long, 3.5 feet wide,
and at least 2.3 feet deep. Orientation was eastnortheast by west-southwest; more precisely, the
long axis was oriented about N. 60oE. The outline
of the pit was discernible as soon as the plow zone
was removed, and therefore it is presumed that the
pit was dug from a surface no lower than the bottom of the plow zone.
As already mentioned, there was no skeletal
material. In the case of this burial, however, there
is a possibility that there never was a body in the
pit, since the positions of the vessels leave almost
no room for a body. Of course, it may be that some
of them were resting on the body. However, small
fragments of unidentifiable bone and charcoal were
scattered on the floor of the pit, and the possibility
exists that the individual had been cremated and a
few of the remains placed in the grave along with
the burial goods. This suggestion is, of course,
highly conjectural.

E. Mott Davis and Bernard Golden

Within the pit were 20 items worthy of note:
16 vessels, one Talco arrow point, one mass of
kaolin, one cluster of stone chips, and the bone
and charcoal fragments just mentioned. Their positions are shown on the plan (Figure 33), and
descriptive comments are provided below. Two
sherds were also found in the fill of the pit. One is
identified as type Taylor Engraved; the other is a
red-brown sherd with widely spaced engraved lines.
Two additional items may be associated with
this burial. A small teardrop-shaped knife (no. 89,
described in the section on stone work), which was
found on the screen, came from 0.5-1.0 feet below
the plow zone and was within 1.5 feet of the southwest end of the burial pit. An irregular piece of
sandstone (no. 100) which may have been used as
a pitted stone came from the fill of the southwestern end of the pit 2.0-2.5 feet above the floor.
Many of the vessels were crushed by the weight
of earth, but they were sufficiently intact so that
their shapes could be discerned readily in the field
(Figure 34, top).
Three vessels (nos. 55, 81, 105) were found
some distance above the floor at the northeastern
end of the pit. Nine vessels (nos. 47, 51, 52, 64,
72, 73, 75, 76, 77) and the kaolin were arranged in
a line slightly to one side (southeast) of the longitudinal axis of the pit. Three vessels (nos. 43, 56,
65) were widely spaced along a line on the northwest side of the long axis. One large olla (no. 113)
was at the middle of the southeast edge of the pit.
Pottery types represented are as follows: Ripley
Engraved, six; Ripley or Taylor, one; Taylor Engraved and Taylor-like, five; Harleton Appliquéd,
one; Cass Appliquéd, one; Belcher Engraved, one;
Bullard Brushed, one.
Details on type and position are given here, in
order of catalog number.
No. 43. A small carinated bowl of type Taylor
Engraved. It was upright on the floor of the pit,
near the northeast corner.
No. 47. A small jar of type Cass Appliquéd. It
was the northeasternmost vessel in the main line
of vessels. It stood upright on the floor, about one
foot from the northeastern end of the grave.
No. 51. A carinated bowl of type Taylor Engraved. It was in the main line of vessels, upright
on the floor about 2 feet from the northeastern
end of the grave.

No. 52. A large shouldered pot, or bowl with
compound flaring rim, of type Ripley Enraved. It
lay just southeast of the long axis and about 1.5
feet from the southeastern end of the pit. It lay
bottom up on the bottom of the pit. It was broken.
No. 55. A tall bowl or jar of type Belcher
Engraved. It lay on its side with mouth west-northwest, 0.5 feet above the floor in the eastern corner
of the burial pit.
No. 56. A small carinated bowl, of type Ripley
Engraved. It lay upright on the floor, north of nos.
72 and 73, and about a foot from the northeastern
edge of the grave.
No. 64. A miniature carinated bowl of type
Ripley or Taylor Engraved. It lay upright on the
floor of the grave against the northern edge of the
mass of kaolin (see below).
No. 65. A small bottle of type Taylor Engraved.
It lay on its side on the floor of the grave with its
mouth south-southwest, one foot from the northwest edge of the pit and 2 feet from the northeastern end.
No. 72. An elaborately decorated bowl of type
Ripley Engraved. It lay in the main line of vessels,
partly under the northeastern rim of vessel no. 73.
No. 73. A compound bowl of type Ripley Engraved. It lay in the main line of vessels, on the
floor of the grave, partly over no. 72.
No. 75. A carinated bowl of type Taylor Engraved. It rested upright on the floor of the grave
in the main line of vessels.
No. 76. A deep bowl of type Ripley Engraved.
It was in the main line of vessels, near the southwest end. It lay upright on the floor of the grave
and was only slightly broken.
No. 77. A jar, of type Harleton Appliquéd. It
was upright on the floor of the grave in the main
line of vessels.
No. 81. A large jar, probably of type Bullard
Brushed. It lay upright and tilted eastward, in the
northern corner of the grave. Its base was about
0.75 feet above the floor of the grave, and it appeared to have been put in place after the grave
was partially filled.
No. 91. A Talco point. It lay on the floor of
the grave on the east-northeast side of vessel no.
76. The field records are not clear as to its orientation, but the tip seems to have been toward the
southwestern end of the pit.

124

The Ben McKinney Site, A Titus Focus Site

No. 105. A carinated bowl of type Ripley Engraved. It lay upside down in the eastern corner of
the pit, about 1.75 feet above the floor and 0.9
feet above the highest side of vessel no. 55. This
vessel was only 0.8 feet below the modern surface,
just below the plow line, and its discovery was our
first indication of the presence of a burial. There
was a faint indication of a pit at this level, which did
not become very clear until the excavation continued downward another 0.5 feet, at which level the
pit—and vessel no. 81—appeared distinctly. Vessel
no. 105 was evidently put in place when the burial
pit was almost full.
No. 113. A jar of olla, probably of type Taylor
Engraved. It lay upright at the southwestern edge
of the grave at its midpoint, next to vessels nos. 73
and 75. It was badly crushed but essentially complete.
Flint chips. A concentration of flint chips
about 0.4 feet in diameter lay on the floor of the pit
between vessels nos. 43 and 52. Some scraps of
what may have been decayed bone were noted
just above these chips.
Kaolin. In a gap in the main row of vessels,
between vessels nos. 51 and 72 and about 0.5 feet
from each, was a mass of kaolin 0.3 feet in diameter, on the floor of the pit. Vessel no. 64 was at its
northern edge.
Bone and charcoal fragments. Small fragments of bone and charcoal occurred on the floor
in an area 4 feet long and 1.6 feet wide in the
center of the pit. There was no single direction in
the grain of the charcoal, and the bone fragments,
which are burned, are too small for identification.
BURIAL II
Burial II, called Feature 510 in the field, was a
pit 10.5 feet long, 3.2 feet wide, and at least 2.4
feet deep (Figure 34, bottom; 35). It was oriented
northeast-southwest; more precisely, the longitudinal axis was oriented about N. 44oE. As in the
case of Burial I, the pit outline was first visible
immediately below the plow line, about 0.7 feet
below the present surface.
The main portion of the pit was 8.8 feet long.
At the northeast end there appeared to be a shallow extension, like a shelf, 1.7 feet long, the floor
of which was about 1.3 feet higher than the main

E. Mott Davis and Bernard Golden

floor of the grave.
No bones were found in the grave. A few very
small fragments of charcoal were found in the bottom of the pit. One sherd of type Ripley Engraved
also came from the fill of the pit. Grave goods
consisted of 11 vessels, ten in the main pit and one
on the shelf, and a large mass of kaolin. The vessels in the main pit were in two groups; five (nos.
48, 50, 80, 83, and 104) clustered just southwest
of the center, and the other five (nos. 42, 49, 57,
68, and 102) less tightly grouped at the northeast
end together with the mass of kaolin. There were
six vessels of type Ripley Engraved or Ripley-like,
three of Taylor Engraved or Taylor-like, and two of
Harleton Appliquéd.
The specimens are listed here in order of catalog number. All vessels were upright on the floor of
the main pit unless otherwise stated. No vessels
were found inverted.
No. 42. A small carinated bowl of type Ripley
Engraved, was the most southern of the group of
vessels near the northeastern end.
No. 48. A small carinated bowl of type Ripley
Engraved, was tilted northeast. It was the easternmost of the group of vessels southwest of the
center of the grave.
No. 49. A compound bowl of uncertain type,
probably Ripley Engraved, was slightly above the
floor, near the eastern corner of the pit.
No. 50. A carinated bowl of type Ripley Engraved, was tilted northwest, and was the
westernmost of the group of vessels southwest of
the center of the grave.
No. 57. A small carinated bowl of type Ripley
Engraved, was tilted southwest; it was the
westernmost of the vessels near the northeastern
end of the grave.
No. 68. A bottle of type Taylor Engraved,
was just west of no. 57.
No. 80. A carinated bowl of type Ripley Engraved, was badly crushed; it was the northernmost of the group of vessels southwest of the
center of the grave.
No. 83. A carinated bowl of type Ripley Engraved, was crushed; it was the westernmost of
the group of vessels southwest of the center of the
grave.
No. 102. A narrow-necked jar of redware,
probably of type Taylor Engraved, was badly

126

The Ben McKinney Site, A Titus Focus Site

crushed at the eastern corner of the grave.
No. 103. A jar of type Harleton Appliquéd
with the rim broken off, was on the floor of the
shallow shelf-like northeastern extension of the
grave. It is possible that the rim was broken off by
the plow, since the vessel was not far below the
plow line, but the breakage seems too regular for
such an explanation to suffice.
No. 104. A jar, probably of type Harleton
Appliquéd, was badly broken on the floor of the pit
in the group of vessels southwest of the center,
between nos. 48 and 50.
No. 125. A mass of Kaolin, was at the northeastern end of the main pit.
BURIAL III
Burial III (Figures 36, 37) had the field designation Feature 536. It was a pit with its long axis
roughly east-northeast by west-southwest; more
precisely the orientation was about N. 70oE. It was
approximately 9.8 feet long and 4 feet wide. The
depth is not certain because conditions were exceedingly wet during much of the investigation of
this grave and it is not certain whether it was present
immediately below the plow line or not. We were
unable to core the pit out, but took it and the
surrounding area down by levels, recording the
outline at each level, as well as we could see it. The
outline was visible as high as 0.5 feet below the
plow line, and extended 2.5 feet below that; hence
the pit may have been as much as 3 feet deep. In
Figure 37 we have given the outline of the pit at
two elevations, about 98.20 and 97.40 feet above
datum. The bottom appeared to range from 97.0697.31 feet above datum.
The burial contained no bones. The fill contained a few fragments of charcoal, and two plain
ware sherds, dark in color. There were 23 specimens in the pit: 15 vessels, one pottery pipe, five
Talco arrow points, one knife, and one petaloid
celt. All specimens were found in situ except for
four of the projectile points. The vessels are classified as follows: Ripley Engraved, six; Taylor Engraved and Taylor-like, three; Harleton Appliquéd,
two; Bailey Engraved and Bailey-like, two; Hodges
Engraved, one; Maydelle Incised, one.
Unlike the situations in Burials I and II, the
materials were at many different levels in the pit

instead of being mostly on the floor. Directly on the
floor in the center of the grave was a miniature
shallow bowl (no. 58) resembling Taylor Engraved.
A Talco point (no. 90) was nearby, and another
Talco point which was found on the screen came
from close by. Three additional Talco points were
screened from the dirt which came from the deeper
part of the pit, and it may be that all five arrow
points were originally together. Also on or near the
floor were two large Ripley Engraved bowls (nos.
61 and 74), a Harleton Appliquéd jar (no. 78), a
petaloid celt (no. 92), a Taylor-like jar (no. 53),
and a Bailey-like bottle (no. 67).
Higher in the fill were the rest of the vessels,
from 0.6-1.2 feet above the floor. In the northern
corner a Bailey Engraved bottle (no. 69) lay on its
side with a small crude discoidal knife (no. 88) next
to it; and above it a Hodges Engraved compound
bowl or jar (no. 46) also lay on its side. At the
northeastern end of the pit was a pottery pipe (no.
70), which must have been put in place when the
pit was nearly full.
In the eastern corner of the pit five vessels
were stacked, a Harleton Appliquéd jar with four
carinated bowls around it. A small Ripley Engraved
carinated bowl (no. 63) was on its side, and nested
in it was another (no. 54). On, or in, these two
vessels sat a Harleton Appliquéd jar (no. 71). Two
other small carinated bowls, one of type Ripley
Engraved (no. 45) and one of type Taylor Engraved
(no. 44), were on their sides leaning against the
southeastern side of the jar, opposite and higher
than the first two bowls.
The remaining two vessels were a Ripley Engraved carinated bowl (no. 79) midway along the
southeastern edge of the grave, and a Maydelle
Incised jar (no. 59) high in the fill at the western
corner.
Specimens associated with Burial III, in order
of catalog number, are as follows:
No. 44. A small carinated bowl of type Taylor
Engraved, in the stack of vessels at the northeast
end.
No. 45. A small carinated bowl of type Ripley
Engraved, in the stack of vessels at the northeast
end.
No. 46. A compound bowl of type Hodges
Engraved, located high in the fill; north corner.
No. 53. An olla-like jar with “cursive curvilin-

ear” design akin to Taylor Engraved, on the floor
by the southeast edge, next to no. 74.
No. 54. A small carinated bowl of type Ripley
Engraved, in the stack of vessels at the northeast
end.
No. 58. A miniature shallow bowl, possibly of
type Taylor Engraved, on the floor of the pit near
the center.
No. 59. A large jar of type Maydelle Incised,
high in the fill at the western corner.
No. 61. A compound bowl of type Ripley Engraved, on the floor in the southwestern part of
the pit.
No. 63. A small carinated bowl of type Ripley
Engraved, at the bottom of the stack of vessels at
the northeast end.
No. 67. A bottle with a design resembling
Bailey Engraved, on the floor in the northeastern
part of the pit.
No. 69. A bottle of type Bailey Engraved,
about 0.5 feet above the floor at the northern corner.
No. 70. A ceramic pipe with conical bowl and
cylindrical stem, high in the fill at the northeastern
end of the pit.
No. 71. A jar of type Harleton Appliquéd, the
central feature of the stack of vessels at the northeastern end.
No. 74. A carinated bowl of type Ripley Engraved, on the floor in the northeastern part of the
pit, next to no. 53.
No. 78. A jar of type Harleton Appliquéd, on
the floor in the western part of the pit.
No. 79. A carinated bowl of type Ripley Engraved, midway along the southeastern edge, high
in the fill.
Nos. 84, 85, 86, 87. Talco points (found in
screening pit fill) from the deeper part of the pit;
one of them was from near vessel no. 58.
No. 88. A small chipped discoidal blade, about
0.5 feet above the floor at the northern corner,
next to the mouth of vessel no. 69.
No. 90. A Talco point, on the floor of the
center of the pit with the tip north, near vessel no.
58. It could have been part of a cluster of such
points, together with nos. 84-87.
No. 92. A petaloid celt, on the floor midway
along the southeastern edge, next to vessel no.
74.

OTHER MATERIALS FROM THE
BURIAL AREA
Burials IV, V, VI, VII
After the completion of our work, Messrs. R.
R. Nicholas, Edward M. German, and Robert L.
Turner, local amateur archeologists with whom we
had been cooperating, excavated and documented
four burials which we have labeled Burials IV, V, VI,
and VII. The results of their work have not as yet
been analyzed, but we have included the approximate location of their burials in Figure 32 for the
sake of completeness. As far as our observations
have gone, their finds corroborate ours.
The “Line of Artifacts”
Twenty-four other artifacts were found in the
burial area, and those found in situ are shown on
the plan (Figure 32). On the plan the specimens
are labeled by field number rather than catalog
number (catalog numbers are used on the burial
plans), and consequently both field and catalog
numbers will be given here, since for the most part
specimens are referred to by catalog number in
this report.
Most prominent among the finds in the burial
area was a northeast-southwest line of specimens,
twelve in number, in the southern part of the burial
area excavation. They could well represent two
burials. Muddy conditions, and mixture caused by
eroded and refilled ruts, obscured any pit outlines
that may have been present here.
In the southwestern part of the line of artifacts, grouped closely enough together so that they
could represent one burial, were the following, in
order of their location from southwest to northeast: a Bullard Brushed jar (F121A, no. 82), a Simms
Engraved carinated bowl (F105A, no. 38), a Simms
Engraved shouldered bowl (F105B, no. 36), a small
plain ware bottle (F95D, no. 39), a small plain ware
bowl which may once have had effigy appendages
(F95B, no. 37), and a petaloid celt (F88A, no. 94).
Farther northeast and in the same general line,
or close to it, were the following: two pitted stones
(F126, no. 98; F141, no. 99), a Taylor Engraved
shouldered bowl (F129B, no. 41), a Simms Engraved carinated bowl (F129A, no. 60), a small

130

The Ben McKinney Site, A Titus Focus Site

Wilder Engraved bottle (F125, no. 40), and a
Yarbrough point (R214, no. 96) which was found
on the screen. It is not possible to say whether the
pitted stones and the projectile point were associated with the vessels or were earlier.
Miscellaneous Finds
Scattered elsewhere in the burial area were
the following: a few sherds of a large carinated
Ripley Engraved bowl (F88B, no. 111); a small plain
ware bottle (F154, no. 66); a Frio point (R79, no.
122); a Gary Small point (R79, no. 121); the basal
portion of a Wells point (R46, no. 97); a grooved
sandstone axe (F83, no. 95); a polished fragment,
probably a celt (F454A, no. 93); and five pitted
stones (F72, no. 115; R79, nos. 117, 118; F42, no.
123; R537NE, no. 108). There was also a teardrop-shaped chipped knife (no. 79) close to Burial
I, which has been mentioned in the discussion of
that burial.

No. 93 (F454A). A fragment of a polished
artifact, probably a celt, about 6 feet east of the
northeast end of Burial II.
No. 94 (F88A). A petaloid celt, in the line of
artifacts.

found about 20 feet west of the line of vessels, just
above the red clay and 1.5 feet below the plow
zone. Sherds were also found at this level, but not
in direct association with the ax. As discussed later,
it is suspected that this ax signifies an earlier occupation than the one represented by the burials.

No. 123 (F42). Pitted stone, west of Burial
VII between 1.0–1.5 feet below the plow zone.
DISCUSSION OF THE BURIAL AREA
There are a few regularities noticeable about
the burials. First, the pits are oriented from eastwest to northeast-southwest. Second, they are similar in dimensions and were doubtless designed for

E. Mott Davis and Bernard Golden

extended rather than flexed burials. Third, the vessels and other artifacts in the graves run true to
form for the Titus Focus, as discussed in later sections of this report.
The only seemingly significant irregularities in
respect to artifact distribution are with regard to
the distribution of Simms Engraved vessels and
Talco arrow points. All three of the Simms Engraved
vessels were in the line of artifacts in the southern
part of the burial area. Possibly these vessels, which
are of a type not native to Titus Focus but are
occasionally found in Titus Focus burials, had some
special significance to the person in whose grave
they lay, or to his survivors, a significance not felt
by the people associated with the other burials.
However, we could not define grave outlines in
connection with the line of artifacts, and it is possible that these vessels were not all in the same
grave.
There were five Talco points in Burial III, one
in Burial I, and none in Burial II. It is often suggested that the presence of arrow points in a grave
signifies the burial of a male. If so, Burial III, which
had more grave goods than the others, might be
the burial of a relatively important male. Burial II,
without points but with a mass of kaolin—perhaps
potter’s clay—might then be the grave of a woman,
since we assume that the women were the potters.
Burial I however contained both a Talco point and
a mass of kaolin so it is unclear if either is indicative
of sex.
Among the artifacts other than those in the
burials, the grooved stone axe is the only one which
is almost certainly not part of the Titus Focus occupation. Such axes have never been found associated with Caddoan burials. As far as is known, they
date from the Archaic stage in this area (Suhm et
al. 1954, 151). Since this specimen was not associated with a burial, and even though pottery sherds
were found at the same level, it is likely that it
dates from an earlier time than the cemetery. It is
possible that certain of the other chipped and rough
stone artifacts are also not part of the Titus Focus
occupation, but there is no evidence one way or
the other to shed light on this problem except in
the case of the crude discoidal knife, which was
definitely in Burial III next to the Bailey Engraved
pot. It is unlikely that it was merely thrown in as
part of the fill.

THE OCCUPATION AREA
About 160 feet south of the burial area and at
the same elevation on the hillside was an area about
40 feet in east-west diameter and 20 feet in northsouth diameter which—in contrast to the rest of
the site—contained many evidences of Indian occupation: flint flakes, mussel shell fragments, abundant pottery sherds, and two complete artifacts.
This spot we called the occupation area. The weather
and the project schedule did not quite let us complete an exhaustive investigation of this area—for
instance, we may not have found its northern limit—
but in general the evidences were that our investigation was reasonably complete.
In almost all parts of the occupation area the
plow zone rested directly on the red clay. This is
the reason that Table 6 shows only three items
from the brown sand in this area. There had been
extensive erosion on this part of the hillside, probably as a result of cultivation, and in places the red
clay was at the surface. It is quite likely that a good
deal of earth had been removed from the occupation area.
Other than a possible trash pit there were no
structural evidences of any sort in the occupation
area, and the amount of information recovered,
aside from that gained in analyzing the artifacts,
was relatively small.
The “Trash Pit”
Slightly north of the middle of the occupation
area was a spot measuring about 2.5 feet northsouth by 4.8 feet east-west, which was made up of
a brilliant red clay mix, contrasting with the less
vivid color of the surrounding red clay. The center
of this feature was at S55.4/E414.4, and in the
field notes it is referred to as Features 564 and
574. As first found, the brilliant red clay formed a
hump directly beneath the plow line, and looked as
if it resulted from continued baking by an open
fire. It turned out that it was an inclusion within the
general red clay underlying the site, and extended
down into the latter about 1.5 feet; it was, in other
words, the fill of a pit. Our work here was interrupted more than once by rain, and was termi-

E. Mott Davis and Bernard Golden

nated by the end of the project before we had
investigated the pit to our complete satisfaction,
but we were able to dig out part of it. It contained
fragments of charcoal, small unidentifiable bone
fragments, and sherds. It seems to have been a
trash pit; but it might have been a fire pit which
filled up slowly during the time it was used.
ARTIFACTS
The artifact collection from the occupation area
is made up of the following: 854 pottery sherds;
one pottery effigy pipe (no. 70, described in the
pottery section of this report) from the back dirt of
the original test trench which resulted in the discovery of the occupation area, and hence from the
plow zone; and one large stemmed point classed
as a Pogo point (no. 107, described in the section
on stone work), which was found in the plow zone.
The identifiable sherds are of categories to be expected in a Titus Focus site, but they are generalized enough so that they might also be found in a
related focus such as the Belcher Focus (Suhm et
al. 1954, 199–203). As discussed in the pottery
section, a large proportion of the pottery sherds
are other than engraved or red ware, contrasting
sharply with the situation in the burial area, and
this circumstance supports the identification of this
spot as an occupation area.
DISCUSSION
The occupation area could have included at
most a single house, since it was no longer than 40
feet in maximum diameter. There were, however,
no structural evidences (except for the possible
trash pit), and if a house had been present it was
either too temporary to leave evidences, or else all
evidences had been removed by erosion.
Anticipating the concluding section of this
report, we note that out of the 854 pottery sherds
there were none identified as Pease Brushed-Incised, a circumstance which makes it reasonably
certain that this artifact complex is not the same as
that at the Whelan and Harroun sites. Even though
the evidence is not conclusive, we believe that the
occupation area is part of the same component as
the burial area, and hence that the Titus Focus
occupational complex is not the same as that of

133

E. Mott Davis and Bernard Golden

Whelan or Harroun. This is a hypothesis which must
be tested further, since the evidence here at the
McKinney site is not abundant enough for good
demonstration of the differences and similarities
between the two complexes.

POTTERY

The pottery collection from the McKinney site
is made up of 1,355 sherds, 52 whole or restored
vessels, and two pipes. In the first part of this
section the sherds will be described, with additional notes, where relevant, about the vessels in
the categories under discussion. Folllowing that,
the vessels will be enumerated. The two pipes are
described at the end of the section.
THE SHERD COLLECTION
A total of 1/355 pottery sherds was found
during the work at the McKinney site. Their occurrence is summarized in Table 6. The numbers given
the categories are for convenience in cross-referencing between the descriptions, the table, and the
illustrations (Figures 38, 39).
1. Plain Ware
There are 632 plain sherds, making up 47%
of the total sherd collection. The temper is mainly
crushed sherd or clay, with some grit. About 1/7 of
the sherds have crushed bone as a noticeable major tempering ingredient; it occurs in minor quantities in other cases. In most cases the paste is
black. Surface color ranges from black through dark
gray to buff, brown, and pale gray, and there are
cases showing that the color varied within the same
vessel, presumably through irregular firing. Surfaces are mostly well smoothed. Thickness is mostly
about 6 mm. There is a surprising scarcity of rims,
only four being recorded; they are slightly flared,
with outrolled lips in three cases and a flattened lip
in the fourth. There is no information on vessel
shapes except that one sherd is part of a thick flat
base. In our preliminary sorting we divided the
plain sherds according to whether they were rim or

134

The Ben McKinney Site, A Titus Focus Site

body sherds, had clay-grit or bone temper, and
were of dark or light exterior color. No significant
differences in distribution could be seen between
the categories so set up, and they have been lumped
together in Table 6.
In the vessel collection there is one plain ware
bowl (no. 37) and two bottles (mentioned below).
Most of the engraved bowls have plain bodies.
The two following categories have been set
aside from the main category of plain sherds.
1A. Polished or burnished plain sherds
These 48 sherds are orange-brown in color.
Thanks to eroded surfaces there is no sharp line
between these sherds and some of these in the
general Category 1. Many of these sherds probably
came from engraved vessels.
1B. Bottle sherds
Sixteen plain sherds show a curvature of small
radius and hence are presumed to be from the
necks of bottles, or (in one case) from the neck of
an olla. Surface color ranges from pale buff through
orange-brown to pale gray. One sherd shows an
outrolled lip. Thickness ranges from 4-7.5 mm.,
most sherds being 5-6 mm. thick.
In the vessel collection there are two plain
ware bottles, nos. 39 and 66, both of them miniatures.
2. Brushed Ware (Figure 39, F-I)
We initially classified and tabulated the 355
brushed sherds (26.5% of the total sherds) according to the direction of brushing (horizontal,
vertical, more than one direction, or indeterminate),
whether the surface was light or dark in color, and
whether the temper was clay or bone. There turned
out to be no distributional significance to the resulting categories, and they have been lumped in
Table 6. More than two-thirds of the brushing is of
indeterminate direction, in any case.
The brushed ware is the same as the plain
ware with respect to temper, color, thickness, and
form.
In the vessel collection, three vessels (nos.
59, 81, and 82), have brushed bodies. Two are

five of Harleton Appliquéd (nos. 71, 77, 78, 103,
104).

3. Punctated Sherds

5A. Parallel incised panels on rims: Maydelle
Incised (Figure 38, A-E)

3A. Punctates in curvilinear bands: Cowhide
Stamped? (Figure 38, I)
Ten sherds show punctates filling relatively
narrow curved bands, apparently parts of scrolls.
They are probably, but not certainly, from a single
vessel. These specimens probably represent the
type Cowhide Stamped, from the Belcher Focus,
since on Cowhide Stamped vessels one occasionally finds punctates used to fill curvilinear zones
(Suhm et al. 1954, 260, Pl. 13, A. D.; however,
punctations are not mentioned in Webb’s definition
[1959, 128]). All sherds are from the burial area.
3B. Miscellaneous punctates
Four sherds show a row of punctations made
with a flat or square-ended stick applied at an angle
so that a ridge of clay was punched up on one side
of the punctation. One of them is a rim sherd with
rounded lip, the row of punctations being just below the lip and resembling vertical incisions.
Other punctated sherds are discussed below
under Miscellaneous Engraved sherds, Category 7H.
In the vessel collection, closely spaced random punctates appear on the neck of a Bullard
Brushed jar (no. 81). Two Harleton Appliquéd jars
(nos. 71, 77) have a row of punctates just below
the lip.
4. Appliquéd Sherds
There are five appliquéd sherds, all from the
occupation area. One has a coarse appliqué strip
interrupted by coarse punctations about 8 mm.
apart. Two small sherds show a neat appliqué ridge;
one of them is also brushed. Two other sherds
have parallel appliqué ridges about 7 mm. apart
and could well be from vessels of the types Harleton
Appliquéd or Cass Appliquéd.
The vessel collection includes six appliquéd
specimens: one of Cass Appliquéd (no. 47) and

136

5. Incised and Trailed Sherds

Nine sherds appear to belong to the type
Maydelle Incised (Suhm et al. 1954, 324). Eight
are from the occupation area and one from the
tests. They show adjoining panels of parallel lines,
dipping alternately to right and left. On one sherd
the lines are trailed; on the others they are incised.
The identification of sherds as type Maydelle
Incised because of this motif is not entirely without
reservations, since of the two complete vessels in
this collection which show the motif, one is Maydelle
(no. 59), but the other is a jar of type Harleton
Appliquéd (no. 71).
5B. Parallel incisions and trailed lines (Figure 38, F-H)
Twenty-three sherds are in this category, all
from the occupation area. Thirteen sherds of utility
ware show parallel trailing. In six of the cases, all of
them heavily bone tempered, one set of parallel
lines is superimposed over another, nearly at right
angles (Figure 38, G); one of them is a rim sherd,
on which the lines slant obliquely from about 10
mm. below the lip. Ten other sherds show narrow
parallel incised lines.
In the vessel collection, two Harleton Appliquéd
jars (nos. 77, 104) have a rim decoration of vertical
incised lines.
5C. Keno Trailed (Figure 38, K, L)
Four sherds, all from the tests and probably
representing a single vessel, show curvilinear designs which are indistinguishable from those on
Taylor and Bailey Engraved vessels (see below,
Category 7E), but are executed with very wide lines
which appear to have been smoothed over. The
total effect is distinct from that of Taylor or Bailey
Engraved, and the sherds seem to be referable to
the type Keno Trailed (Suhm et al. 1954, 310; Webb
1959, 133–136), which has this distinctive techni-

The Ben McKinney Site, A Titus Focus Site

cal attribute and shares designs with Taylor and
Bailey Engraved, as well as having distinctive design elements of its own.
5D. Panels of parallel diagonal incisions
separated by vertical incisions: Pease
Brushed-Incised? (Figure 39, J, K)
There are two of these sherds. One (Figure
39, J), from the burial area, shows vertical parallel
incised lines separating areas of parallel diagonal
incisions. This is a characteristic decoration of Pease
Brushed-Incised pottery (Suhm et al. 1954, 338).
A second smaller sherd (Figure 39, K) is similar but
the lines are more widely and carefully spaced. The
type Pease Brushed-Incised is out of context in a
Titus Focus cemetery, and the identification must
be considered tentative in view of the small sample.
There are no complete vessels of Pease BrushedIncised from the site.
5E. Miscellaneous incised sherds
This is a residual category of small sherds
showing incised lines, usually straight. Fourteen
are clay tempered and two are bone tempered.
6. Red Ware
Fifty-seven plain sherds are classed as red
ware, about evenly divided between those with a
polished red-brown slip and those with a brilliant
red film.
6A. Red film
Twenty-nine sherds, mostly from the burial
area, have a coat of brilliant red pigment, not polished, and much eroded in some places to reveal a
pale yellow-buff surface beneath. The core is very
dark, tempered with sherd and grit. The surface is
well smoothed. One sherd looks as if it were painted
in zones, with a curved unpainted strip between.
Three vessels in the collection show this red
film: two of type Ripley Engraved (nos. 48, 105)
and one probably of type Taylor Engraved (no.
102).
6B. Red-brown slip, polished

E. Mott Davis and Bernard Golden

Twenty-eight sherds, all but two from the
occupation area, are of a red-brown slipped ware,
well polished and fired. In most cases the paste is
dark and sherd tempered. There is no indication of
the shape of the vessels except that one sherd
shows part of a flat bottom.
Only two pieces in the vessel collection seem
to be of this red-brown slipped ware. They are
both of type Ripley Engraved (nos. 73, 79).
7. Engraved Sherds
There are 238 engraved sherds, making up
18% of the total sherd collection. This is a rather
high percentage, and doubtless reflects the presence of the burial area. As noted later, the proportion of engraved sherds is much higher in the burial
area than in the occupation area.
Problems of classification
The problem of classifying decorated sherds,
as well as complete vessels, is made more difficult
by the fact that recognized Caddoan types grade
into one another, and often are not distinguishable
on sherds, or sometimes even on whole vessels.
In the McKinney site collection it is possible to
sort some of the sherds by type, whereas others
must be classed by design elements which are found
in more than one type.
It seems most profitable to think of the “types”
as areas in a typological continuum, where certain
attributes of design and manufacture cluster in a
more or less stable complex. The fact of the continuum represents the fact that Caddoan prehistory has few if any, sharp breaks, either temporal
or geographic. The attributes represent particular
traits in manufacture and decoration which can be
studied individually as to geographical and temporal distribution—that is, each attribute can be considered, for purposes of study, to have its own
history. The types, the more or less stable clusterings
of attributes, are presumed to represent a feeling
on the part of the makers that these particular
combinations formed desirable whole, attractive
units.
The degree of stability of the attribute clusters represented by currently recognized Caddoan
pottery types varies considerably, which is another

137

E. Mott Davis and Bernard Golden

way of saying that the types are of varying historical validity, a situation which reflects the preliminary nature of much of the research in this area.
7A. Ripley Engraved (Figure 38, J)
Thirteen sherds, all but one from the burial
area, are referable specifically to the type Ripley
Engraved. Two rim sherds show the well-known
Ripley circle with enclosed diamond, and eleven
sherds from a carinated bowl of brown to black
ware show characteristic Ripley Engraved designs.
The vessel collection includes 20 Ripley and
Ripley-like vessels, which are listed on a later page.
7B. Ripley or Taylor Engraved
Thirteen sherds have features common to the
types Ripley Engraved and Taylor Engraved. Six
are from the burial area, six from the occupation
area, and one from the tests. They include rims
with fragments of slanted elements—parts of
scrolls—with central longitudinal lines, the elements
being bordered by wide hatching; and rim and shoulder sherds with deeply engraved curved lines appearing to be the areas of Ripley or Taylor carinated bowls where two panels meet.
One vessel from the site is listed as “Ripley or
Taylor Engraved.”
7C. Taylor Engraved (Figure 38, M, N)
Taylor Engraved sherds and vessels, particularly in the case of carinated bowls with scroll design, have many resemblances with certain vessels
identified in the literature as Ripley Engraved and
Hodges Engraved, to the point where the differences are at times not at all clear. In the case of
body sherds of bottles, it is frequently impossible
to tell whether one is dealing with Taylor Engraved
or Bailey Engraved.
Nine sherds in the McKinney collection, evenly
distributed among the several parts of the site, are
tentatively identified as Taylor Engraved. Two of
these sherds show a curved line joining a straight
one, the triangular area between being crosshatched. An examination of the literature and of
vessels in The University of Texas collections indicates that this trait occurs only on a few Taylor

138

The Ben McKinney Site, A Titus Focus Site

Engraved specimens. Other sherds (Figure 38, N)
show lines with spurs which join the line at a sharp
angle. This is again a trait which in the context of
the east Texas Fulton Aspect appears to be limited
almost entirely to Taylor Engraved vessels.
Eleven vessels from the site are classed as
Taylor Engraved or Taylor-like.
7D. Taylor-like: red ware with hatched panels
Six sherds scattered in the occupation area
combine to make two larger sherds which are of
polished red ware and show engraved panels filled
with wide hatching. In one case enough of the
panel is present to show that the hatching is in a
herringbone pattern. The design seems most closely
affiliated with certain designs on Taylor Engraved
bottles (e.g. Suhm et al. 1954, Plate 66, F). In any
case the treatment, although unusual, is not foreign to the Titus Focus affiliation indicated by the
complete vessels in the burials in this site.
7E. Taylor or Bailey Engraved (Figure 39, A,
B)
A series of 41 black ware sherds, mostly from
the burial area, show wide engraved lines arranged
in patterns of concentric curves. They could belong
to vessels of either the Taylor Engraved or Bailey
Engraved types, and some are certain to be from
the same vessels as those represented by certain
of the positively identified Bailey Engraved sherds
described below. Four similar sherds have been
described earlier as type Keno Trailed.
7F. Bailey Engraved (Figure 39, C)
Six sherds—four from the burial area and two
from the tests—are like those just described but
they contain key parts of designs which identify
them as of the type Bailey Engraved (Suhm et al.
1954, 240).
Among the whole vessels there is one classed
as Bailey Engraved and one classed as Bailey-like.
7G. Hodges Engraved (Figure 39, D)
The Hodges Engraved type (Suhm et al. 1954,

The Ben McKinney Site, A Titus Focus Site

E. Mott Davis and Bernard Golden

296–299) one of the most elaborately decorated
of Fulton Aspect pottery types, is represented in
the sherd collection by 11 sherds, three from the
burial area and eight from the tests. The sherds are
identifiable as Hodges Engraved because they show
engraved cross-hatching in a curvilinear design and,
in two cases, negative circles. These are Hodges
Engraved trade marks when not associated with
shell tempering; if associated with shell tempering
they would be classed as Natchitoches Engraved.
In the vessel collection there is one Hodges
Engraved compound bowl or jar.

in, and in the vicinity of, the burials. There were
also sherds from one additional vessel from the
burial area (F88B; no. 111), which is included in
Table 6. The occurrence of all these vessels is discussed in the sections dealing with the burials and
the burial area, and brief notes concerning each of
them are in the section on the sherd collection.
The purpose of the present section is to provide a checklist of the vessels by types, as a crossreference with other sections of the report.

7H. Miscellaneous engraved sherds

Nineteen vessels: nos. 42, 45, 48, 50, 52, 54,
56, 57, 61, 63, 72, 73, 74, 76, 79, 80, 83, 105, 111
(sherds).
Forms: small carinated bowls, eight (Figure
40); carinated bowls, seven whole vessels (Figure
41) and one group of sherds; compound bowls,
three (Figure 42, A-C).

There are 139 sherds in this residual category.
Slightly more than half are sherds with single or
widely spaced curved engraved lines. They could
well belong to the Ripley or Taylor Engraved types
but are too small for identification. The majority of
these specimens are of an orange-brown color,
sometimes with red pigment in the engraved lines.
A few are of dark ware, sometimes showing white
pigment in the lines. Most of them are from the
occupation area. There are also 13 rim sherds, most
of them showing three widely spaced horizontal
parallel lines, probably parts of Ripley Engraved
designs. The lips are in most cases tapering and
slightly everted, often with a horizontal engraved
line immediately below the lip on the exterior.
Eight sherds show areas of fine punctations
bordered by lines that are engraved or incised (Figure 39, E). They are of black ware, polished or well
smoothed. Traces of red pigment can be seen in
some of the punctations. This motif is found in
many Titus Focus vessels, and also is found on
pottery types farther northeast. In the vessel collection this motif appears on four pieces: a Bailey
Engraved bottle (no. 67), a Bailey-like bottle (no.
69), a Ripley Engraved bowl (no. 72), and a miniature Taylor-like bowl (no. 58).
About 50 of the sherds show engraved lines,
singly or in groups, over too small an area to permit identification of design or type. Most of them
are from the burial area.

POTTERY PIPES
Two pottery pipes were found at the McKinney
Site, one of them in Burial III and the other in the
occupation area. They are illustrated in the accompanying photographs (Figure 50).
No. 70, from burial III, is a poorly fired clay
pipe with a conical bowl which meets the slightly
expanding stem at an angle of about 135o. It is red
filmed and is decorated with wide incised lines in a
design of triangles, chevrons, and circles, and at
least one rectilinear scroll. The design is difficult to
interpret because much of it is eroded or broken
away, but it seems to be related to those on Ripley
Engraved or Taylor Engraved vessels. This general
form of pipe is one of those characteristic of this

area (Suhm et al. 1954, 188, 193; Jackson 1933,
passim), although this exact form is not duplicated
in examples known to us.
No. 106, from the plow zone in the occupation area, is a small animal head effigy with a pointed
nose and prominent ears. The small cylindrical bowl
is at the back of the head. Marks have been made
for the mouth, but otherwise the specimen is undecorated and crudely finished. The piece is unusual for this area, as far as we can determine.
Discussion of the Pottery
The sherds and vessels from the McKinney
site form a ceramic collection which is entirely characteristic of the Titus Focus as it has been defined
in the literature (e.g., Suhm et al. 1954, 189–195).
Pottery types Ripley Engraved—a diagnostic Titus
Focus type—and Taylor Engraved, and closely re-

lated vessels and sherds, are most numerous.
Harleton Appliquéd, another diagnostic type, is
important in the vessel collection although little
represented in the sherds. Wilder Engraved, the
third type diagnostic of the focus, is represented in
one vessel. Vessels and sherds of Bailey Engraved,
and vessels of Cass Appliquéd, Bullard Brushed,
Maydelle Incised, and a conical-bowl pottery pipe,
all fit well into a Titus Focus context.
Vessels not of Titus Focus types—Hodges
Engraved, Belcher Engraved, and Simms Engraved—
belong to types which have frequently been found
in Titus Focus graves in the past, perhaps occurring as trade pieces from their native areas north
and east. Sherds of type Cowhide Stamped probably have the same significance.
Only the two Pease Brushed-Incised sherds
are really foreign to the classic Titus Focus. It is
doubtful, however, that these sherds are signifi147

excavated and published, it is important that the
occupation area at the McKinney site be positively
identified, if possible, with the Titus Focus burials
such a short distance away. There is nothing in the
material from the occupation area to suggest that
it is not part of the same component as the burials,
but, as a glance at Table 6 will show, the identification is not quite conclusive. There are no sherds
surely of types Ripley Engraved, Harleton Appliquéd,
or Wilder Engraved from the occupation area, and
one or more of these types should, at this stage of
studies, be present for a good Titus Focus identification. However, the chances are great that the
occupation area and the burial area represent one
component, and they have been so treated here.
It has already been noted that the absence of
Pease Brushed-Incised sherds in the occupation
area material strongly indicates that the artifact
complex of these people is different from the people
responsible for the Whelan and Harroun sites.

cant, since they constitute only two out of 1,355 in
the total collection. Since there are indications at
other sites in the Ferrell’s Bridge reservoir area that
Pease Brushed-Incised is a type of early Titus Focus (Jelks and Tunnell 1959, 59; Davis and Gipson
1960), it should not be unusual for a few stray
sherds of this type to show up in this area.

Thirty-two artifacts in stone were found at
the McKinney site: six arrow points, six dart points,
a spear point, three knives, three celts, a grooved
axe, nine pitted stone, and three combination pitted-stone-mullers.

Distribution of fancy wares.

Talco points (Figure 51, A-F)

It is striking that the sherd collections from
the occupation and burial areas differ markedly in
the relative proportions of engraved and red ware
sherds, which are fancy wares, as opposed to other
sherds. In the occupation area, engraved and red
ware sherds constitute 10.3% of the total, whereas
in the burial area they make up 44.67%. It is assumed that this difference verifies our interpretation of the “occupation area” as being what we
have named it.

All six of the arrow points found were Talco
points (Suhm et al. 1954, 508), and all came from
burials: one (no. 91) from Burial I and the remaining five (nos. 84-87, 90) from Burial III. As far as
the authors know, all the documented occurrences
of these points have been in Titus Focus graves, so
the circumstance at McKinney runs true to form.
These specimens are thin, delicate, isosceles triangles with sharp tips and slightly concave bases.
On two specimens the tip is broken. Materials are
yellowish and gray chert and fine-grained quartzite, probably not of local origin. Range of dimensions is as follows: length, 30-42 mm.; maximum
width (at base), 13-16 mm.; thickness 2.5-3 mm.

DART POINTS
Frio point (Figure 51, G)
No. 122. From the burial area, is a stubby
point with basal ears which have been broken off.
The point resembles certain specimens illustrated
by Suhm et al. (1954, Plate 93, A, H) as Frio points,
a type found in central and western Texas but not
characteristic of East Texas. The present specimen
is made of a poor grade of yellow chert, probably
of local origin. Dimensions are: length (incomplete)
22 mm., width (incomplete) 18 mm., thickness 6
mm.
Gary Small points (Figure 51, H, I)
Nos. 119 and 121. Two points conforming
to the Gary Small category (Ford and Webb 1956,
52). Point no. 119 is from the test area and no.
121 from the burial area. They are of yellow-brown
and dark brown jasper, possibly of local origin. Dimensions are: 29 (estimated) x 19 x 7.5 mm., and
35 x 6 x 19 mm. The stem makes up nearly 1/2 of
the total length of no. 119, and about 1/3 of the
total length of no. 121. The chronological position
of Gary Small points is not well known, but they
seem to be most common in late Archaic and ceramic times in this area (Davis and Davis 1959, 52–
53). They have not been seen as part of the Titus
Focus except at the aberrant Whelan and Harroun
sites (Davis 1985; Jelks and Tunnell 1959, 47).
Morrill point (Figure 51, K)
No. 120. A dart point found in the tests,
conforms to the Morrill type (Suhm et al. 1954,
456). It is of purple fine-grained quartzite, possibly
of local origin. The distal end has been broken off.
The length may have been as much as 50 mm.; the
width is 18 mm. and the thickness is 9 mm. The
specimen is roughly worked, the blade being alternately beveled to the right and with roughly parallel sides both on blade and stem. The shoulders
project slightly and the base is slightly convex. The
edges of the stem are smoothed. The Morrill type
is an East Texas type (Ibid.).
Wells point (Figure 51, J)

152

The Ben McKinney Site, A Titus Focus Site

No. 97. The basal portion of a dart point
found in the burial area, is of the Wells type (Suhm
et al. 1954, 488). It is of purple and gray finegrained quartzite, probably foreign in origin. Most
of the blade is missing. The shoulders are small
and almost barbed. The stem is long and tapering
and the base shows the cortex of the rock from
which the piece was originally made. Maximum width
is 23 mm., and thickness is 8 mm.
Yarbrough point (Figure 51, L)
No. 96. A complete specimen from the burial
area, is a Yarbrough point (Suhm et al. 1954, 492).
It is of purplish fine-grained quartzite, probably
not of local origin. Dimensions are 38 x 19 x 6 mm.
The stem expands slightly and the base is straight.
The stem edges have been smoothed slightly.
SPEAR POINT
Pogo point (Figure 51, O)
No. 107. A large complete point from the
plow zone of the occupation area, is put in the
somewhat catch-all category of Pogo points (Suhm
et al. 1954, 398). It is of coarse yellowish chert,
probably not of local origin. Dimensions are 95 x
41 x 12 mm. The blade is long and tapering, the
shoulders slightly barbed, and the stem has straight
sides and a rounded base. Stem sides and base
appear to have been smoothed. This is a wellmade point, of a form which occurs sporadically in
this area (Ibid.).
KNIVES
Under this category we list three specimens,
two complete and one fragmentary, which are
unstemmed bifacial chipped tools.
No. 88 (Figure 51, N). From Burial III, is a
small coarsely flaked discoidal specimen of mottled
cherty material, irregular in outline and with a cutting edge all around. Maximum dimensions are 37
x 31 x 10 mm.
No. 89 (Figure 51, M). From the burial area
close to Burial I, is a teardrop-shaped knife, coarsely
but regularly flaked and quite symmetrical except
where two flaws in the stone cause irregularities.

The Ben McKinney Site, A Titus Focus Site

The material is a purple and gray fine-grained
quartzite. Dimensions are 59 x 34 x 13 mm.
No. 1450. A tip fragment from the tests, is a
beautiful piece from a large pointed bifacial artifact, carefully flaked with broad flat flakes and with
fine pressure retouching along the edges. The fragment is 29 mm. long, 31 mm. wide, and 7 mm.
thick. It appears to represent only a small part of
the original specimen.
CELTS AND AXES
Petaloid celts (Figure 51, Q, R)
Nos. 92 and 94. These two specimens are
petaloid celts of fine-grained sandstone, almost
identical in size and appearance. They have been
pecked into shape, then polished lightly all over,
and the bit has been given a high polish. They
taper from the bit to a narrow rounded butt. No. 92
is from Burial III: its dimensions are 73 x 35 x 25
mm. No. 94 is from the “line of artifacts” in the
burial area; its dimensions are 72 x 35 x 26 mm.
This form of artifact is characteristic of the Titus
Focus and is also found in contemporary neighboring complexes (Suhm et al. 1954, 193–194 and
passim).
Celt fragment
No. 93. From the burial area, is a fragment of
what appears to be a large celt. It was originally a
roughly cylindrical object of fine-grained sandstone
or quartzite, somewhat flattened on one face, with
a width of approximately 53 mm.; the thickness
tapers from 40 mm. to about 32 mm. The surface
is well polished. The fragment is 78 mm. long;
there is no indication of the original length.
Grooved ax (Figure 51, P)
No. 95. From the burial area, is a complete
full-grooved ax of orange and purple fine-grained
sandstone. It was pecked into shape and then
polished all over except for the rounded butt. Dimensions are 103 x 78 x 45 mm. Specimens such
as this have never been found associated with Titus
Focus materials and they are believed to date from
Archaic times in this area (Suhm et al. 1954, 151).

E. Mott Davis and Bernard Golden

The present specimen was found in the brown sand
near the underlying clay, and it probably was not
made by the people responsible for the burials.
PITTED STONES AND MULLERS
Pitted stones
There are nine irregular blocks of local ferruginous sandstone which have from one to four
pits in the surface. Five are from the burial area,
one questionable specimen is from Burial I, and
three are from the tests. Pitted stones are characteristic of all complexes in East Texas. They are
commonly thought to have served as anvils for
cracking nuts. One of our workmen told us of using sandstone blocks for this purpose as a child,
and said that there were certainly pitted stones
around the old farmstead where he grew up, testimony of his youthful love for hickory nuts.
Pitted stones-mullers
Nos. 98, 108, 116. These three specimens
are pieces of local ferruginous sandstone which, by
virtue of their smooth faces, appear to have been
used as grinding stoes held in the hand. Each one
has a pit in at least one face. Two of them (nos.
108 and 116) are flat, about 30 mm. thick, the
maximum dimension being about 85 mm. They
come, respectively, from the burial area and the
test areas. No. 98 is triangular in cross-section,
with dimensions being 94 x 55 x 53 mm. One base
has a deep pit and the other two have slight pits on
them.
DISCUSSION OF THE STONE ARTIFACTS
The only stone artifacts certainly associated
with Titus Focus pottery at this site were the Talco
points, one petaloid celt, and a crude discoidal knife.
The knife is an addition to the Titus Focus inventory. The other items are well known as Titus Focus
artifacts. It is likely that the Pogo point, the Gary
Small points, possibly others of the points, the teardrop-shaped knife, and the pitted stones and
mullers should be attributed to the Titus Focus
people as well, but at this site the association cannot be demonstrated.

SUMMARY, DISCUSSION, AND
CONCLUSIONS
SUMMARY
The Ben McKinney site is a prehistoric burial
ground in western Marion County, Texas, at the
edge of the valley of Cypress Creek, in the Ferrell’s
Bridge Reservoir area. The site was excavated in
the autumn of 1957. Three graves were excavated,
and other burial material was also recovered. The
graves contained no skeletal material; the bones
may have been absorbed into the soil, a common
circumstance in this area. The collection of grave
goods is made up of 52 pottery vessels, a pottery
pipe, six Talco arrow points, two petaloid celts, two
masses of kaolin, and a small chipped discoidal
knife. The vessels are chiefly of types Ripley Engraved and Taylor Engraved, and also include
Harleton Appliquéd and a small representation of
types Bailey Engraved, Wilder Engraved, Bullard
Brushed, Simms Engraved, Maydelle Incised,
Hodges Engraved, Cass Appliquéd, and Fulton Aspect plain ware. In every respect this is a characteristic classic Titus Focus burying ground.
In the burial area, but not necessarily associated with the burial materials, were also found 338
sherds of types akin to those represented in the
vessels, a Frio point, a Gary Small point, a Wells
point, a small teardrop-shaped knife, a fragment of
a probable large celt, a polished full-grooved ax,
five pitted stones, and two combination pitted
stones-mullers. It is not known whether these items
are to be attributed to the people who dug the
burials. In the case of the full-grooved ax—a characteristic artifact of the Archaic stage in this area—
it is assumed that the Titus Focus people are not
responsible.
A short distance from the burial area was a
small occupation area, much disturbed by cultivation so that for the most part only the plow zone
remained on top of the basal red clay. There were
no structural evidences except for a pit, the fill of
which seemed burned and which contained sherds,
charcoal flecks, and small bone fragments. In the
occupation area were found broken mussel shells,
flakes, 854 sherds of types similar to those in the
burial area, one Pogo point, and one small pottery
154

effigy pipe. There were proportionally many less
fancy ware sherds—engraved and red ware—in the
occupation area than in the burial area.
Extensive tests in the vicinity of the site produced 158 sherds of types resembling those in the
occupation and burial areas, one Gary Small point,
one Morrill point, one knife tip, three pitted stones,
and one pitted stone-muller. These were scattered
finds, and there was no evidence of significant prehistoric activity other than in the burial and occupation areas.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
The purposes of the work at the McKinney
site were, first, to find, excavate, and document
fully several Titus Focus burials, and second, to
find a Titus Focus occupation area in order that the
occupation complex of the Titus Focus, hitherto
unknown, might be determined. The latter objective was desired not only in order to find how the
Titus Focus people lived, but to determine, if possible, the nature of the relationship between the
Titus Focus and other sites in the reservoir area,
notably the Whelan site, which was the only other
site dug in the reservoir area at the time the work
at the McKinney site began, and which shared many
traits with the Titus Focus but also showed some
marked differences, as in the use of Pease BrushedIncised pottery (Davis 1958).
The first objective was fulfilled, in that three
burials were excavated and fully documented, and
the materials recovered conform closely to the definition of the Titus Focus (Suhm et al. 1954, 189–
195). Although certain types characteristic of the
Titus Focus are not represented, such as LaRue
Neck Banded and Glassell Engraved, the sample
obtained is small enough so that these absences
are not significant. In short, the McKinney site
burying ground is a typical example of the very
numerous Titus Focus cemeteries in this area. It is
not as large as some of the sites—the famous Taylor site, not far away, had 64 burials (Suhm et al.
1954, 190)—but is otherwise entirely characteristic
of the focus.
The second objective was only partially fulfilled because of the small nature of the occupation
area and the relatively generalized nature of many
of the sherds. The probability is high that it is part

The Ben McKinney Site, A Titus Focus Site

of the same component as the burial area, but this
identification is not positive. However, proximity
argues for the association, the artifact material is
entirely compatible with it, and no evidence weighs
against it. Therefore it seems quite justifiable to
assume, for purposes of discussion, that we are
dealing with an occupation area of the classic Titus
Focus.
It is not profitable to make a detailed, traitby-trait comparison between the occupation materials from the McKinney site and the “Whelan complex” materials—that is, those from the Whelan
site and the more recently excavated Harroun and
Dalton sites (Jelks and Tunnell 1959; Davis and
Gipson 1960, especially p. 69)—because the former
are relatively so small in number, 854 sherds and
two complete artifacts as against nearly 15,000
specimens from the Whelan site alone. Nevertheless, at least one important difference is to be noted
between these two bodies of material. If the
McKinney occupation were a reflection of the same
culture as is manifested by the Whelan complex—
as is suggested by many similarities between the
two—we would expect to find some 3.5% of sherds
of the type Pease Brushed-Incised, which at the
McKinney occupation area would amount to some
30 sherds; but in fact we found none at all there.
From the entire McKinney site—burial area, occupation area, and tests—there are only two possible
Pease Brushed-Incised sherds out of 1,355, rather

E. Mott Davis and Bernard Golden

than the 45 to 50 which might be expected if we
were dealing with Whelan Complex materials. This
difference is surely significant. Even at the Harroun
site where the sherd collection numbered only 562,
there were 17 Pease Brushed-Incised sherds (Jelks
and Tunnell 1959, 38–41).
Putting it more succinctly, we are making two
tentative conclusions about the McKinney site occupation area: first, that it is a material manifestation, albeit small, of the occupation complex of the
classic Titus Focus; and second, that this complex
is significantly different from that of the Whelan,
Harroun, and Dalton sites in that it lacks Pease
Brushed-Incised pottery. If these conclusions are
correct, then the differences in structures, projectile points, and pottery between the Whelan complex and the classic Titus Focus are not purely functional in nature—that is, they are not simply due to
the fact that the Whelan complex is manifested in
mound and occupation sites, whereas the Titus
Focus is represented entirely by burials—but are
probably due to culture change in time. This conclusion agrees with those suggested elsewhere by
Jelks and Tunnell (1959, 58–61) and Davis and
Gipson (1960, 71–74). Conclusive demonstration
of these relationships awaits excavation of an extensive Titus Focus occupation site, but a good
beginning has been made by the work at the
McKinney site.

FOREWORD
This report deals with the excavation and analysis of the Isadore Segal site (University of Texas site
no. 41MR1), located in Marion County, Texas, at the Ferrell’s Bridge Reservoir (now the Lake O’ the Pines).
The site was tested in 1957, and in 1959 limited excavations were carried out by the Department of
Anthropology of The University of Texas, under terms of a memorandum of agreement (No. 14-10-333528) between The University and the National Park Service. The field work was carried out by Archeologist
E. Mott Davis, assistant archeologist Curtis D. Tunnell, and crew members Richard Ross, W. C. Jones, John
Ruegenberg, and Chester Rogers.
Special thanks are extended here to Messrs. I. B. Price, Jr., Harold Caver, Jr., R. R. Nicholas, and Jerry
Brod, amateur archeologists who aided in the preliminary testing of the site in 1957. Sincere appreciation
is also expressed to the members of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at the Ferrell’s Bridge Dam, who
gave considerable assistance to the salvage project. Through the courtesy of Mr. O. L. Stafford, Superintendent, a small bulldozer tractor aided the excavations at the Segal site, and tractor operator John D.
Lane is to be commended for his care in using the tractor for archeological testing.
The author is especially grateful to a number of co-workers who were helpful in the preparation of
this report. Edward B. Jelks and Lathel F. Duffield provided frequent advice and assistance. E. Mott Davis
participated in the preparation of the sections dealing with field evidences. LeRoy Johnson, Jr., took the
author’s detailed manuscript, edited it, and consolidated it to its present form.

THE SITE
LOCATION AND APPEARANCE
The Segal Site (41MR1) is in northwestern
Marion County at the northern edge of the flood
plain of Cypress Creek, about 5 miles above the
Ferrell’s Bridge Dam. It is approximately 5/8 mile
south-southwest of Victory High School, and the
same distance southeast of the mouth of Alley Creek
Valley. The Whelan Site (Davis 1958) is about 1 1/
4 miles to the southeast. The map coordinates for
the Segal Site are 32o47’20” N, 94o34’28” W. A
small spring-fed branch emerges from a little side
valley near the site, and flows southwestward into
Alley Creek, which in turn empties into Big Cypress
at a point about one mile south of the site. The site
(Figure 52) is situated on a relatively level surface
area at the mouth of the aforementioned side valley, at a point where it widens to join the Big Cypress Creek Valley. This location would be convenient for horticulturalists, although the area is subject to periodic flooding. Alley Creek and the spring
branch would have provided a convenient, semipermanent source of water for the inhabitants of
the site. The bottomlands in the neighborhood were
formerly in dense forest consisting of various species of oak, walnut, hickory, sweetgum, cypress,
and pine. In the early 1920s Mr. J. N. Chatham,
tenant, cleared and farmed the land on which the
site is located. At that time the property was owned
by Mr. Isadore Segal, a resident of Jefferson, Texas.
In 1957, Mr. Chatham reported that, over a period
of many years, he had plowed down an Indian
mound at the site, and told of finding numerous
fragments of pottery, clay pipes, a ball of clay covered with fingerprints, and human skeletal material. Mr. Chatham also stated that he had intentionally changed the channel of the small creek, (which
originally ran through the eastern part of the valley) so that it ran along the western side of the
valley close to the site.
ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
The Segal Site was first recorded on February
9, 1951, by Messrs. E. O. Miller and E. H. Moorman
during their preliminary survey of the Ferrell’s Bridge

W. A. Davis

Reservoir area. They were guided to the site by Mr.
Chatham. Because heavy grass cover prevented
their finding many artifacts, Miller and Moorman
judged the site not very promising. E. Mott Davis
and Edward B. Jelks visited the site on October 3,
1956, and found it to be in much the same condition as when Miller and Moorman were there. Mr.
Chatham, who again guided the archeologists,
pointed out the approximate location of the mound
which he had plowed down years before.
Because of the reported mound and the large
number of artifacts found at the site by Mr. Chatham,
the Segal Site was selected for limited excavation
in 1957. Unfortunately Mr. Chatham could not locate the exact spot where the mound had formerly
stood because the bottomland had been cleared
and the landmarks with which he was familiar were
gone.
Preliminary testing of the site was carried out
during February of 1957. In the limited area tested,
this work revealed that there were abundant artifacts in and immediately below the surface plow
zone, which was approximately 6 inches thick.
In 1959, in the 8 working days from September 29 to October 8, a crew of four men, directed
by E. Mott Davis and Curtis D. Tunnell, carried on
limited excavations at the Segal Site and recovered
the main body of data reported here. A few weeks
later the Ferrell’s Bridge dam was closed, and soon
afterwards the Segal Site was permanently inundated by Lake O’ the Pines.
EXCAVATION AND RECORDING METHODS
In 1957, when the preliminary testing was
carried out, a wooden stake was set at a point
which was assumed from surface indications to be
at the southern edge of the site. This stake was
designated as grid point N500/E500 in the standard grid of 5-foot squares that was employed,
and the top of the stake was assigned an arbitrary
elevation of 50 feet. This stake was used thereafter
as the primary datum point for both horizontal and
vertical control.
After the initial testing, all materials found were
sacked and labeled according to whether they came
from above or below the plow zone. All digging
below the plow zone was done in 1/2-foot vertical
intervals, and the floors of all levels were carefully

trowled to facilitate the detection of occupational
features.
During the second and final season at Segal
(1959), a bulldozer tractor with blade and fire plow
was used to cut several shallow trenches through
the site in order to aid in the location of occupational features and concentrations of artifacts.
Trench 1 consisted of a cut about 7 feet
wide, 87 yards in length, and up to 2 feet in depth.
The location of this and the other trenches is shown
on Figure 52. Trench 1 revealed several dark stained
areas and an abundance of pottery.
Trench 2, located to the east of Trench 1,
was 7 feet wide, 137 yards long, and from 1-2 feet
deep. Several areas of shallow, grayish midden soil
were exposed by this trench.
Trench 3 was a north-south trench located
to the east of Trench 2. It was 7 feet wide, 97 yards
long, and from 1/2-1 1/2 feet deep.
For the most part the results of the tractor
excavations were very disappointing and no significant occupational features were found in the
trenches.
INTERNAL STRATIGRAPHY
Deposits at the Segal Site consisted of alluvial
sand with some silt. Four distinct strata were distinguished (Figure 53):
Zone IV. The plow zone and topsoil was a dark
gray and brown mottled sand, humus-stained, and
containing numerous root disturbances. It varied
in thickness from 0.5-1.0 feet, the usual thickness
being about 0.7 feet.
Zone III. This midden deposit consisted of a
mottled gray-brown to dark brown sand much disturbed by rodents. The zone was thin and discontinuous, measuring 0.3-0.6 feet in thickness, and
presumably represented that part of the original
midden topsoil which was deep enough to escape
the action of the plow.
Zone II. This zone of upper subsoil contained
medium- to light brown sand and showed less rodent disturbance than above. It was not sharply
differentiated from Zone I, and measured from 0.91.5 feet in thickness.

W. A. Davis

Zone I. The zone of lower subsoil was a mottled,
light gray-brown sand, with increased proportions
of clay in the lower part, and with heavy iron staining in some areas. No rodent burrows were detected. This zone extended downward to an unknown depth, the deepest test having been made
with a post-hole digger to a depth of 5.3 feet below the surface.

The scattered midden deposits were thin and
considerably mixed with the underlying soils as a
result of rodent runs and other disturbances. In
several instances the lower part of the plow zone
seemed to consist of midden soil, but it was not
always possible to be certain about the identification. Trench 2, however, revealed an area of dark
gray mixed soil which was thought definitely to
represent midden fill.
Post Molds
Numerous post molds and several probable
post molds were recorded. They consisted of gray
to almost black sandy soil. Although no definite
pattern or plan was noted, they may well have
belonged to houses or other structures that had
been destroyed by disturbances.
Pits
Pit 1, a relatively large pit that appeared to
have been used for the disposal of trash, showed
up in the northwest corner of 5-foot-square N545/
E490. The pit fill was of a gray color which was
darker in the lower part than in the upper part.
Though the pit was not completely excavated, it
was determined to contain many potsherds and
other cultural detritus, especially in the lower portion.
The lower portion of another pit (Pit No. 2),
measuring about 1.8 feet in maximum diameter,
was located in the east wall of square N530/E525.
This pit contained a burned, mottled, reddish soil
which looked like the bottom of a fire pit. Though
numerous post molds were present in the vicinity,

this feature could not definitely be related to any of
them.

THE ARTIFACTS
POTSHERDS
A total of 3,940 potsherds was found at the
Segal Site, but no complete or restorable vessels
were recovered. A majority of these specimens seem
to be of the same basin ware, hence a single description of the paste will suffice for the entire group.
The sherds in general appear to be closely related
to the types recovered from the Whelan Site (Davis
1958), the Harroun Site (Jelks and Tunnell 1959),
the Dalton Site (Davis and Gipson 1960), and the
McKinney Site (Davis and Golden 1960). The sherds
vary from 3-11 mm. in thickness, and the paste
color ranges from cream or orange to medium or
dark brown, gray, and black, with the core frequently darker than the interior and exterior surfaces. A few sherds show noticeable fire-mottling.
The texture of the paste is usually medium to fine
and compact, but in some cases it is coarse and
friable. Most of the sherds have been well smoothed,
particularly on the interior surface, and some have
a fair polish.
All of the sherds are tempered with a coarse
clay grit, and approximately 60% of them contain,
in addition, large amounts of pulverized bone and
a light-colored clay mineral, probably kaolin.
The ceramics are classified here into descriptive groups according to the technique of decoration or surface treatment: plain, brushed, incised,
punctated, appliquéd, and engraved, and various
combinations of these. When possible, typological
affiliations will be pointed out, employing the type
names used by Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks (1954).
Plain Potsherds
The 1,605 undecorated potsherds are all body
sherds with the exception of 40 basal sherds, five
which apparently represent bottlenecks, and 88
rimsherds. Five specimens have a conspicuous red
film.
No attempt will be made to place the body or
basal sherds into specific types, since it could not

W. A. Davis

be determined whether they came from completely
plain vessels or from decorated vessels with plain
fields on their surfaces.
The majority of the rim sherds are from vessels which had outwardly inclined rims and rounded
lips. A few sherds, however, have flat lips, and some
vertical rims are present in the collection. One interesting rim sherd (Figure 54, A) is slightly everted,
has a rounded lip, and is collared in the Coles Creek
style. Six of the rims definitely can be identified as
bottle sherds, while the others seemingly represent
deep bowls and large utilitarian vessels.
Brushed Potsherds
A total of 1,550 brushed potsherds were recovered from the Segal Site; 1,512 of them are
body sherds and 38 are rim sherds. The brush
marks were invariably applied to the exterior surfaces of the vessels, while the interior surfaces were
smoothed or, rarely, slightly polished.
Various techniques were used in the application of the brush marks. Most of the body sherds
(1,278) show one-directional brushing in which the
brush striations are approximately parallel to each
other. The brush marks vary from well executed
deep lines of the style known as “combed” (Figure
54, B) to a random, shallow style of application.
Other sherds show two-directional, overlapped
brushing (153 sherds), or brush marks on only one
part of the sherd surface (62 sherds); another 19
body sherds have separate fields filled with brushing, in which the striations of one field are at right
angles to those of adjacent fields. This last style of
execution occurs commonly on vessels of the Pease
Brushed-Incised type.
Most of the brushed rim sherds are of the
direct rim form with rounded lips, although tapering rims are also present. One slightly everted rim
sherd is noticeably collared. Another unusual specimen has a rim which turns outward from the body
at approximately a 90o angle and has a flat, scalloped lip. On most of the rim sherds the brush
marks run horizontally, although a few have vertical or diagonal striations.
As regards typology, only the body sherds
with fields of brushing at right angles can safely be
assigned to a definite type—Pease Brushed-Incised.
The remaining sherds could well belong to any of

the following types: Bullard Brushed, Harleton

Punctated Potsherds
Of the 100 punctated potsherds recovered
from the Segal Site, 24 are rim sherds and 76 body
sherds. The punctations are executed in several

different styles and are arranged in various patterns. Among the different forms present are (1)
small punctations most likely made with a pointed
stick, (2) punctations formed by means of fingernail impressions, (3) those probably made by flatended reeds, and (4) punctations made with reeds
with hollow ends.
Most of the sherds show a completely ran-

dom surface application of the punctations, but
single or multiple rows of punctations occur occasionally on both rim and body sherds (Figure 54,
C). On the rim sherds the punctations are generally
of the fingernail-impressed type, running in horizontal rows.
The vessel shape indicated by a majority of
the punctated sherds is a deep, semi-globular vessel with outturned or straight rim. The lips, for the
most part, are rounded.
Little can be said about specific ceramic types,
although the rim sherds with horizontal rows of
punctations could represent the Harleton Appliquéd
type. The single rows of punctations found on 17
body sherds are of particular interest since they do
not constitute a common trait in the pottery of the
Titus, Belcher, or Frankston foci.

sherds (Figure 54, F) features triangular areas outlined by incising, which are filled with randomly
spaced punctations. This specimen is of the Maydelle
Incised type. Another rim sherd, (Figure 54, G),
probably of the same type, exhibits a grid of diagonal incised lines with punctations near one edge of
the grid. The remaining sherds (Figure 54, H), particularly the body sherds, are too small to allow for
accurate determination of their original decorative
designs. The punctations themselves are of the
styles mentioned in the preceeding two groups,
while the vessel shapes cannot accurately be determined. Three of the specimens, however, have
lips flush with the rim, while the other rim sherds
are slightly everted and have rounded lips.

Punctated-Brushed Potsherds

A total of 193 incised potsherds was recovered, 30 of which are from the rim sections of
vessels and show segments of the lip. As regards
vessel shape, the most usual form mentioned previously seems to be represented in this group of
sherds: deep, globular vessels with direct or everted
rims and, for the most part, rounded lips.
Four sherds (Figure 54, I) of the incised category show panels or fields of vertical incised lines
alternating with panels of parallel diagonal lines,
and seem to represent the Pease Brushed-Incised
type. Another 11 sherds (Figure 54, J) have crossed
diagonal lines which form a series of diamondshaped motifs; these resemble the Maydelle Incised type. Six specimens (Figure 54, K; 55, A)
resembling also the Maydelle Incised type rather
strongly, show herringbone designs consisting of
equidistant “V”-shaped lines. A group of ten sherds
(Figure 55, B) shows the broad-stroke style of incising which is generally called trailing. These sherds
may well belong to the type Foster Trailed-Incised
of the Belcher and Texarkana foci. One interesting
sherd exhibits a slightly everted, collared rim with
rounded lips and has an incised, horizontal line just
below the lip. This is quite similar to the rim treatment found on various Coles Creek ceramic types.
For the remaining 162 sherds the design motifs
could not be determined because of the small size
of the specimens. However, vertical, horizontal, diagonal, and perhaps other kinds of incisions are
present. In some cases the soft clay appears to

Ninety-nine sherds are both punctated and
brushed. Fifty-six are body sherds and 43 are rim
sherds. The punctations are most frequently of the
variety presumably made by a stick, although small
fingernail and oval punctations are also present.
The punctations occur for the most part in
single rows, with brushing parallel to (Figure 54,
D)—or at right angles to—the rows. The brushed
rim sherds of this group usually have horizontal
lines of punctations just under the lip (Figure 54,
E). Most of the rim sherds are from vessels with
outturned rims and rounded lips; they have vertical, diagonal, and horizontal brush striations on
their exterior surfaces in addition to the punctations. These apparently represent the Pease
Brushed-Incised type. Two unusual rim sherds have
peaks or nodes on their lips with lines of punctations just below.
It is difficult to type the body sherds without
the aid of reconstructed or complete ceramic vessels from the site, but for the most part they seem
to be from either Bullard Brushed or Pease BrushedIncised vessels.
Punctated-Incised Potsherds
Thirteen sherds have both punctations and
incisions on their surfaces. Five of them are rim
sherds, the remainder body sherds. One of the rim

Potsherds with Appliqué
Eleven body sherds have parallel fillets of clay
affixed to their exterior surfaces. On five speci-

The Isadore Segal Site at Ferrell’s Bridge Reservoir, Northeastern Texas

mens the appliqué fillets are small and spaced in
parallel rows approximately one centimeter apart.
Five other sherds (Figure 55, C) are identical to the
above, but have higher appliqué ridges which are
spaced farther apart. The sherds with appliqué fillets probably represent the Harleton Appliquéd type.
One sherd has a small, rounded appliqué node
on its surface. The node is about 7 mm. high and
has a diameter of 7-10 mm.
Appliquéd-Punctated Potsherds
Seven body sherds were found whose exterior surfaces were roughened by the addition of
appliqué fillets with punctations in between. The
punctation marks were formed by fingernail impressions or by means of a sharp rounded tool.
These specimens are similar to type Harleton
Appliquéd, but because of their very small size no
positive typological identification can be made.
Appliquéd-Incised Potsherds
Eight body sherds from the Segal Site exhibit
parallel appliqué ridges, in between which are incised lines running either parallel to, or diagonal
to, the ridges. The ridges vary from large and widely
spaced to small and closely spaced.
Appliquéd-Brushed Potsherds
A group of 34 sherds is identical to the above
appliquéd-incised group except that there is brushing, instead of incising, between the appliqué ridges.
Most of the brush striations are parallel to the lines
of appliqué, but some run diagonally and a small
amount of cross-brushing is present.
Ridged Potsherds
Thirty-four sherds (Figure 55, D) have ridges
on their surfaces which superficially resemble
appliqué but which actually were made by other
techniques. In the case of 22 specimens, the ridges
were formed by grooving the plastic clay with a
broad, smooth tool in such a manner as to push
up the clay into small ridges. The ridges formed in
this fashion are smooth, carefully formed, and run
parallel to each other. These sherds probably be-

W. A. Davis

long to the Belcher Ridged type. Another ten body
sherds were ridged by end-to-end fingernail pinching. No type name can be suggested for these
specimens at the present time. Two additional
sherds, representing sections of rims, show pinched
ridges immediately below the lips.
Neck-banded Potsherds
Three neck-banded rim sherds (Figure 55, F)
were found at the Segal Site. The unsmoothed
coils, all of which are from the rim areas of vessels,
constitute the only apparent surface decoration.
These strongly resemble the La Rue Neck-Banded
type sherds of the Frankston and Titus foci.
Engraved Potsherds
A total of 164 engraved potsherds was found
at the Segal Site, including 23 rim sherds and 141
body sherds. The most common vessel shapes represented by this collection are carinated bowls,
bottles, and compound bowls. Various design motifs are present, and it is principally from these that
typological assessments can be made. At least four
sherds (Figure 55, E) show the circle-and-cross
design that is diagnostic of the Ripley Engraved
type. Another sherd (Figure 55, G) has long, diagonal lines (sections of scrolls) that are characteristic of the Taylor Engraved type. The remainder
exhibit various diagonal and horizontal lines, ticked
lines, excised areas, and (rarely) lines filled with
red or white pigment. All or most of these specimens probably belong to the Ripley Engraved type
or the Taylor Engraved type.
Miscellaneous Rim Sherds
One interesting rim sherd (Figure 55, I) has
two adjacent peaks or high nodes on the lip. These
are 5 mm. high and spaced 8 mm. apart. Similar
peaks or nodes occur commonly on the rims of
effigy bowls.
Miscellaneous Body Sherds
There are 118 body sherds which show a great
deal of erosion and general alteration. The orginal
surface treatment of these sherds cannot be deter171

mined, hence they cannot be placed in any of the
above descriptive categories.
Clay Lumps
Twenty-four lumps of fired clay were found at
the Segal Site. All are highly irregular in form, and
several have reem or grass impressions, supporting the idea that they are burned fragments of
wattle-impressed daub.
STONE ARTIFACTS
Arrow Points
Six arrow points were recovered during the
excavations. One of them (Figure 55, J), possibly
of the Perdiz type, has a triangular blade and a
relatively long, contracting stem. The total length
of this point is 5 mm. Another point (Figure 55, K)
much like the Bassett type, has a slender, triangular blade, and a short, contracting stem. Total length
measures 19 mm. The third point (Figure 55, L),
falling between the norms for Perdiz and Bassett
types, has a serrated blade, small protruding barbs,
and a pointed base. Specimen measures 24 mm. in
length.
An arrow point fitting the definition of the
Cliffton type (Figure 55, M) was found. This specimen is thick, has a short contracting stem, and
measures 25.5 mm. long by 20 mm. wide. The
only other identifiable arrow point (Figure 55, N) is
of the Bonham type. It has a slender triangular
blade and a small rectangular stem, and measures
22 mm. in maximum length. The remaining arrow
point (Figure 55, O) is fragmentary, lacking the
stem, and no type designation can be given for it.
Retouched Flakes
Three flakes were found which are worked
unificially. Two of them are flaked along one edge
only, while the third is worked around the greater
part of its circumference.
Celt
One fragment of a celt (Figure 55, H), made
of what appears to be basalt, was found. The poll
172

end is missing. It has a convex cutting bit ground
from both faces. Celts of this kind are not uncommon in sites of the Titus Focus.
Grooved Stones
Three pieces of ferruginous sandstone were
found which have channels or grooves presumably
used for abrading purposes. On two of the specimens the grooves are parallel to the long axis of
the stone.
Pitted Stones
Two bifacial fragments of sandstone have pits
pecked into their surfaces. One of the fragments
has a single pit on one face and a groove on the
opposite face; the other specimen has one pit on
each face.
Hammerstone
One hammerstone was found. It is an orange-colored chert nodule that has been battered
at one end.

PROVENIENCE OF THE
ARTIFACTS
A study of the horizontal distribution of the
artifacts from the Segal Site has revealed no significant differences in the occurrence of the various
classes and types. It has been noted, however, that
the greatest concentration of cultural debris was
located near stake N550 between E490 and E510.
A vertical plotting of the specimens according
to the natural strata (Table 7) has likewise failed to
indicate any important distributional differentiation
by types or classes of artifacts. A great majority of
the specimens, it can be observed from Table 7,
were found above Stratum II, with the largest numbers near the surface of the site in Stratum IV. The
relative percentages of types, however, are reasonably consistent from stratum to stratum.
The major conclusion drawn from the provenience data is that only one major component or
occupation is represented at the Segal Site.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The excavations at the Isadore Segal Site failed
to turn up any significant occupational features—
burials, mounds, houses, or the like—although
3,981 potsherds and stone artifacts were recovered.
Plain potsherds comprised approximately 40%
of the total sherd count, which is somewhat less
than usual for sites of the Titus Focus area. The
decorated sherds for which type designations could
be given include Pease Brushed-Incised, Bullard
Brushed, Harleton Appliquéd, Maydelle Incised,
Belcher Ridged, Ripley Engraved, and Taylor Engraved. The Ripley Engraved, Taylor Engraved, and
Harleton Appliquéd types are characteristic of the
Titus Focus, while Bullard Brushed and Maydelle

Incised are found in both the Titus Focus and the
Frankston Focus. Belcher Ridged is primarily a
Belcher Focus type, and Pease Brushed-Incised goes
primarily with the Bossier and Haley foci and with
the Whelan Complex. In addition to the abovenamed types, several sherds were found which
resemble Coles Creek forms.
With regard to the lithic artifacts, Perdiz type
arrow points, in the East Texas area, are characteristic of the Frankston Focus, and the Whelan Complex, while the points falling halfway between
Bassett and Perdiz are probably of Whelan Complex affinity.
Considering the artifact assemblage as a
whole, its affiliations seem to be with the Whelan
Complex (Davis 1958) and therefore the Segal Site
is probably a manifestation of the early Titus Focus.
