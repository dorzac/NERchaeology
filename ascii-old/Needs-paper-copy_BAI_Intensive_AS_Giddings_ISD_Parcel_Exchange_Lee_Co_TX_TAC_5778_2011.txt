On November 4, 2010, Blanton & Associates, Inc. (B&A), at the request of Giddings Independent School
District (Giddings ISD), conducted an intensive archeological survey (as per 13 TAC 26.20 and 26.5) of
approximately 10.6 acres of undeveloped private property currently used as pasture in Lee County, Texas
that Giddings ISD proposes to purchase as part of a proposed parcel exchange with the Texas Department
of Transportation (TxDOT). After purchasing the 10.6-acre property, Giddings ISD proposes to exchange
the parcel with TxDOT for four acres (from an approximately 6.5-acre parcel) of developed land in the
City of Giddings currently used as a TxDOT maintenance facility. Due to previous extensive surface and
subsurface impacts, as well as potential hazardous materials issues within the 6.5-acre parcel (Parcel 1), it
was B&A’s opinion that an intensive survey of the developed property was not warranted, though survey
efforts were recommended for the undeveloped 10.6-acre parcel (Parcel 2). Surface and subsurface
investigations within Parcel 2 noted a rectilinear arrangement of trees in the northern part of the property
but discovered no archeological material. Examination of a 1974 aerial image of Parcel 2 shows a plowed
field with no rectilinear alignment of trees; this indicates that the trees appeared on the property after
1974 and accordingly, B&A does not consider the alignment an historic archeological resource associated
with the location of a previous standing structure. Based on these data, B&A recommends that the
proposed parcel exchange should be allowed to proceed as planned without additional investigations as no
archeological historic properties pursuant to 36 CFR 800.4(d)(1) or State Archeological Landmarks
(SALs) (13 TAC 26.12) would be impacted in Parcels 1 and 2. No artifacts were collected. Curation was
unnecessary.

PROJECT TITLE: Intensive Archeological Survey of 10.6 Acres for a Proposed Giddings Independent
School District Parcel Exchange in Lee County, Texas
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: On November 4, 2010, Blanton & Associates, Inc. (B&A), on behalf of
Giddings Independent School District (Giddings ISD), conducted an intensive archeological survey (as
per 13 TAC 26.20 and 26.5) of approximately 10.6 acres of undeveloped private property currently used
as pasture in Lee County, Texas that Giddings ISD proposes to purchase as part of a proposed parcel
exchange with the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). After purchasing the 10.6-acre
property, Giddings ISD proposes to exchange the parcel with TxDOT for four acres from an
approximately 6.5-acre parcel (Parcel 1) of developed land in the City of Giddings currently used as a
TxDOT maintenance facility. Due to previous extensive surface and subsurface impacts, as well as
potential hazardous materials issues within the 6.5-acre parcel, it was B&A’s opinion that an intensive
survey of the developed property was not warranted, though survey efforts were recommended for the
undeveloped 10.6-acre parcel (Parcel 2).
PROJECT LOCATION: The 6.5-acre Parcel 1 contains an existing TxDOT facility on the north side of
the City of Giddings approximately 1.1 miles north of the United States (US) Highway 77/West Austin
Street intersection. The 10.6-acre undeveloped Parcel 2 is in west-central Lee County approximately 5.5
miles northwest of downtown Giddings. The parcels are mapped on the Paige, TX (3097-114) USGS 7.5minute topographic quadrangle.
TOTAL ACREAGE SURVEYED: 10.6 acres
DATE OF WORK: November 4, 2010
PURPOSE OF WORK: B&A assisted the project sponsor in their compliance with the Antiquities Code
of Texas.
TEXAS ANTIQUITIES PERMIT NUMBER: 5778
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Brandon S. Young
PROJECT ARCHEOLOGIST: Mark D. Willis
NEWLY RECORDED SITES: None
PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITE(S): None
COMMENTS: Due to previous extensive surface and subsurface impacts, as well as potential hazardous
materials within Parcel 1, it was B&A’s opinion that an intensive survey of the developed property was
not warranted. Survey efforts were however recommended for Parcel 2. Surface and subsurface
investigations within Parcel 2 noted a rectilinear arrangement of trees in the northern part of the property
but discovered no surface or buried archeological material.

Examination of a 1974 aerial image of Parcel 2 shows a plowed field with no rectilinear alignment of
trees; this indicates that the trees and alignment appeared on the property after 1974 and is not considered
by B&A to be an historic archeological resource associated with a previous historic standing structure.
Given the results of the 10.6-acre survey and the previous impacts to Parcel 1, it is B&A’s opinion that
there is little to no potential for Parcels 1 and 2 to contain previously unidentified State Archeological
Landmarks (SALs) (13 TAC 26.12) or archeological historic properties (36 CFR 800.16[1]). Based on
these data, B&A recommends that the proposed parcel exchange should be allowed to proceed as planned
without additional investigations as no SALs or archeological historic properties pursuant to 36 CFR
800.4(d)(1) would be affected.

I NT R ODUC T I ON
On November 4, 2010, Blanton & Associates, Inc. (B&A), on behalf of Giddings Independent School
District (Giddings ISD), conducted an intensive archeological survey (as per 13 TAC 26.20 and 26.5) of
approximately 10.6 acres of undeveloped private property currently used as pasture in Lee County, Texas
that Giddings ISD proposes to purchase as part of a proposed parcel exchange with the Texas Department
of Transportation (TxDOT). Giddings ISD would exchange four acres from an existing 6.5-acre TxDOT
maintenance facility (Parcel 1) for the 10.6-acre property (Parcel 2) (Figures 1 through 2.2).
As the proposed parcel exchange would involve property owned by the State of Texas (e.g. Giddings
ISD), the project is subject to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas, now subsumed in Title 13,
Part II of the Texas Administrative Code. This legislation requires that any political subdivision of the
State of Texas must identify potential State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) through survey of public
lands prior to actions that could potentially damage those SALs. Archeological surveys on public lands
require a Texas Antiquities Permit (TAP) from the Texas Historical Commission (THC). These
investigations were conducted under TAP No. 5778 issued to Principal Investigator Brandon S. Young.
Mark D. Willis served as Project Archeologist.
Because the proposed land exchange will not utilize federal funds or require federal permits, it is not
subject to the provisions of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA).
PR OJ E C T L OC A T I ON A ND DE SC R I PT I ON
The approximately 6.5-acre TxDOT maintenance facility (Parcel 1) is adjacent to the Giddings ISD
Intermediate and High Schools on the north side of the City of Giddings approximately 1.1 miles north of
the United States (US) Highway 77/West Austin Street intersection (see Figures 1 and 2.1). Giddings
ISD would obtain ownership of the northern-most four acres of the parcel while TxDOT would retain
ownership of the remaining approximately 2.5 acres. The parcel primarily is paved, gravel driveways and
parking lots, as well as administrative buildings and work areas. Within the maintenance facility are piles
of gravel and asphalt for roadway repairs, fuel tanks, and an above-ground asphalt storage tank. The
majority of the four acres that would be obtained by Giddings ISD consist of asphalt and scraped and
packed dirt.
The 10.6-acre undeveloped parcel that Giddings ISD proposes to purchase is on State Highway (SH) 21
approximately 5.5 miles northwest of downtown Giddings (see Figures 1 and 2.2). The tract consists of
maintained pasture with several trees. There are no drainages/jurisdictional waters of the U.S. within the
parcel, but near the southwest corner of the property on adjacent private property is a stock pond.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
G E OL OG Y
Geology of the existing 6.5-acre TxDOT maintenance facility (Parcel 1) is the Eocene-age Yegua
Formation that consists of sandstone, clay, and lignite with some chert (Barnes 1981). Given the age of
this formation, there is little to no potential for it to contain buried archeological resources.
The geology of the 10.6-acre parcel (Parcel 2) Giddings ISD proposes to purchase is the Eocene-age
Cook Mountain Formation that consists of clay containing small concretions and marine fossils (Barnes
1981). Given the age of this formation, there is little to no potential for it to contain buried archeological
resources.
There is no recent (Holocene) alluvium mapped within either parcel (Barnes 1981). Regionally, Holocene
alluvium has consistently been shown to have a good potential for containing buried archeological
deposits.
SOI L S
Soil in the 6.5-acre Parcel 1 consists of Zack fine sandy loam, 1 to 5 percent slopes. This is an upland soil
that developed in situ from residuum weathered from shale and siltstone of the Eocene Yegua formation.
A typical profile exhibits fine sandy loam from 0 to 10 centimeters below ground surface overlying clay
from approximately 10 to 50 centimeters blow ground surface. Beneath the clay is sandy clay loam and
mixed clay strata to at least 150 centimeters below ground surface (NRCS 2010). This soil has little to no
potential to contain archeological resources.
Soils in the 10.6-acre undeveloped parcel consist of Davilla-Wilson complex, 0 to 2 percent slopes.
Davilla soils, 0 to 2 percent slopes, are found on paleoterraces and developed from Pleistocene loamy
alluvium derived from mixed sources (there are no drainages within the project area). A typical profile
exhibits fine sandy loam from 0 to 20 centimeters below ground surface overlying three dense clay loam
strata to approximately 200 centimeters below ground surface (NRCS 2010). Wilson soils, 0 to 1 percent
slopes, are on paleoterraces and developed from Quaternary alluvium derived from mixed sources (e.g.,
slope wash from adjacent uplands; there are no drainages within the 10.6-acre parcel). A typical profile
exhibits fine sandy loam from 0 to 12 centimeters below ground surface overlying clay to a depth of
approximately 130 centimeters (NRCS 2010). It is the opinion of B&A that these soils have little
potential to contain intact buried archeological material.
F L OR A
The existing 6.5-acre TxDOT facility (Parcel 1) contains virtually no vegetation except occasional
grasses.
Vegetation in the 10.6-acre Parcel 2 consists of upland species described as grassland and fencerow.
Dominant plants in the grassland vegetation type include johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense),
bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon), whorled windmill grass (Chloris verticillata), silver bluestem

(Bothriochloa laguroides), yellow-puff (Neptunia lutea), woolly croton (Croton capitatus), green
milkweed (Asclepias viridis), bahia grass (Paspalum notatum), Texas paintbrush (Castilleja indivisa), and
Texas vervain (Verbena halei), with occasional live oak (Quercus virginiana) contributing less than 10
percent canopy cover. Fencerow vegetation in Parcel 2 typically consists of live oak, sugar hackberry
(Celtis laevigata), cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia), Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei), yaupon (Ilex vomitoria),
poverty weed (Baccharis neglecta), southern dewberry (Rubus trivialis), mustang grape (Vitis
mustangensis), saw greenbriar (Smilax bona-nox), poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans), heart-leaf tie
vine (Ipomoea cordatotriloba), giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida), western ragweed (A. psilostachya),
Virginia wild rye (Elymus virginicus), and Cherokee sedge (Carex cherokeensis).
Curiously, there is a small area in the north central part of the tract that contains Arizona ash (Fraxinus
velutinus), sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), water oak (Q. nigra), live oak, redbud (Cercis canadensis),
red mulberry (Morus rubra), catalpa (Catalpa speciosa), cultivated pear (Pyrus sp.), and loblolly pine
(Pinus taeda). The arrangement and variety of these trees suggests they were intentionally planted.

A review of records available on the THC’s online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) was
conducted 20 September 2010 to determine the presence of previously recorded archeological sites or
previously investigated archeological project areas within a 1,000-meter radius of, or adjacent to, Parcels
1 and 2. The research indicated that there are no previously recorded archeological sites or previously
investigated archeological project areas within a 1,000-meter radius of Parcel 1.
In contrast to the above, part of a previously conducted TxDOT archeological impact evaluation and one
segment of the historic El Camino Real (SH 21) are adjacent to Parcel 2 (TASA 2010). Between 2006 and
2008, a series of archeological surveys and impact evaluations in the TxDOT Austin, Bryan, and Yoakum
Districts included an archeological impact evaluation of 33 acres of the existing SH 21 (El Camino Real)
right-of-way (ROW), part of which parallels the northern boundary of Parcel 2. Based on existing
conditions, it was recommended that the 33 acres of existing ROW did not warrant survey prior to the
proposed widening (Ellis et al. 2009).

Due to previous extensive surface and subsurface impacts, potential hazardous materials issues within the
property, and the geologic and soil characteristics of Parcel 1, it is B&A’s opinion that an intensive
survey of the 6.5-acre existing developed TxDOT parcel was not warranted, as it has no potential to
contain any archeological resources. Based on the above, as well as the adjacent segment of the historic
El Camino Real (SH 21) and a rectangular arrangement of trees in Parcel 2, B&A conducted an intensive
100 percent pedestrian survey of Parcel 2 augmented with subsurface testing. The survey complied with
appropriate archeological survey methods as defined in the Department of the Interior's Standards and
Guidelines (NPS 1983), the Guidelines of the Council of Texas Archeologists (1987), and the survey
standards developed by the THC in conjunction with the Council of Texas Archeologists (THC n.d). All
field investigations were thoroughly photographed.
Surface investigations consisted of a 100 percent pedestrian survey of Parcel 2 utilizing 20- to 30-meter
wide transect intervals. In accordance with CTA (1987) and THC (n.d.) survey standards for block
surveys, systematic shovel testing augmented surface investigations, as surface visibility was below 30
percent throughout the 10.6-acre parcel. Shovel tests were 30–40 centimeters in diameter and excavated
until soil characteristics/bedrock prohibited further excavation. Shovel tests were excavated in arbitrary
20-centimeter levels with all soil screened through 0.25 inch wire mesh. All shovel test locations were
plotted with hand-held global positioning system (GPS) receivers and documented on a B&A shovel test
form. Shovel test results and the existing soils did not suggest there was a potential for the 10.6-acre
parcel to contain deeply buried archeological material that would require backhoe trenching.
B&A also conducted historic background research consisting of an oral history and review of historic
maps and aerial photographs.

R E SUL T S OF I NV E ST I G A T I ONS
Due to previous extensive surface and subsurface impacts, potential hazardous materials issues, and
geologic and soil characteristics, it is B&A’s opinion that an intensive survey of Parcel 1 (see Figure 2.1)
was not warranted, as it has no potential to contain archeological resources. In contrast, B&A intensively
surveyed the undeveloped Parcel 2 that Giddings ISD proposes to purchase given the adjacent segment of
the historic El Camino Real (SH 21) and an arrangement of trees in the north end of the parcel (Figure 3)
Surface investigations in Parcel 2 revealed a nearly level upland pasture with several trees along the
northern and southern fence lines of the parcel as well as a rectilinear arrangement of trees in the northern
end of the property (Figure 4). The stand of trees measures approximately 60 meters by 20 meters with
its long axis parallel to SH 21 (see Figure 3). The stand of trees contains Arizona ash, sycamore, water
oak, live oak, redbud, red mulberry, catalpa, cultivated pear, and loblolly pine that were presumably
planted for their ornamental and/or shade value (see Figure 4). Surface investigations in and around the
tree arrangement discovered however, no archeological material or evidence of a previous standing
structure such as a house or outbuilding associated with a prior farmstead.
Subsurface investigations across the 10.6-acre parcel involved the excavation of 16 shovel tests (STs 1
through 16), which extended to a maximum depth of 90 centimeters below ground surface (Table 1).
Shovel testing typically revealed three stratigraphic zones. Zone I is loose brown loam extending from
ground surface to between 5 and 15 centimeters below ground surface. Zone II extends to a maximum
depth of 25 to 30 centimeters and is a mixture of Zone I and the underlying Zone III (dense compact black
clay loam to clay with small gravels). The only exception to the consistent soils observed during shovel
testing occurred in ST 7, which contained a fourth zone of light brown clay loam/loamy clay subsoil from
80 to 90 centimeters below ground surface, at which depth excavations terminated due to the compactness
of the soil (see Table 1). The excavation of STs 1 through 5 in around the arrangement trees discovered
no archeological material. The excavation of STs 6 through 16 across the 10.6-acre parcel similarly
yielded no archeological material.

To determine the age of the arrangement of trees, B&A interviewed a local resident and employee at the
adjacent Elm Creek Cafe. The informant stated that, despite living in the area for 21 years, she never saw
a house or other structure amongst the stand of trees (personal communication 2010). Several historic
maps and aerial photographs of the area where also reviewed. Examination of the Texas State Highway
Department’s (TSHD) 1936 (revised 1940) General Highway Map, Lee County, Texas indicated that
between 1936 and 1940, the 10.6-acre parcel contained no structures. A 1974 aerial photograph of the
parcel clearly shows it as a plowed field with no arrangement of trees (Figures 5.1 and 5.2). As such, the
stand of trees was planted sometime between 1974 and approximately 1989 and is therefore, less than 36
years old. Given that age, the arrangement of trees is not considered an historic archeological resource.

Based on the results of the intensive survey, the oral history, and archive review, it is B&A’s opinion that
there is no potential for Parcel 2 to contain previously unidentified archeological resources. Further, based
on extensive previous surface and subsurface impacts to Parcel 1, as well as geologic and soil conditions
within Parcel 1, it is also B&S’s opinion that Parcel 1 has no potential to contain archeological resources.

Due to previous extensive surface and subsurface impacts, potential hazardous materials, and geologic
and soil conditions within Parcel 1, it is B&A’s opinion that an intensive survey of Parcel 1 was not
warranted. Surface investigations within Parcel 2 noted a rectilinear arrangement of trees in the northern
part of the property but discovered no archeological material. Subsurface investigations in Parcel 2
involved the excavation of 16 shovel tests, none of which contained any buried archeological material.
In addition to surface and subsurface archeological investigations in Parcel 2, B&A conducted an oral
history interview with a local resident and employee of the Elm Creek Cafe that is adjacent to Parcel 2 to
determine the age of the rectilinear arrangement of trees on Parcel 2. The local informant indicated that
she had lived in the area for 21 years and never saw a structure on Parcel 2. B&A’s review of the TSHD’s
1936 (revised 1940) Lee County highway map indicated that there was no standing structure on Parcel 2
between 1936 and 1940. B&A also examined a 1974 aerial photograph of Parcel 2 that shows a plowed
field with no rectilinear arrangement of trees. As such, the arrangement of trees was planted sometime
between 1974 and approximately 1989 and is therefore, less than 36 years old. Given that age, the
arrangement of trees is not considered an historic archeological resource.
Given the extensive previous surface and subsurface impacts to Parcel 1, as well as geologic and soil
conditions, it is B&A’s opinion that Parcel 1 has no potential to contain archeological sites warranting
SAL designation (13 TAC 26.12) or archeological historic properties (36 CFR 800.16[1]). Further, given
the negative results of the intensive survey of Parcel 2, it also is the opinion of B&A that there is little to
no potential for Parcel 2 to contain previously unidentified archeological sites warranting SAL
designation (13 TAC 26.12) or archeological and non-archeological historic properties (36 CFR
800.16[1]).
Based on the above data, B&A recommends that the proposed parcel exchange should be allowed to
proceed as planned without additional investigations, as it would not affect any SALs or archeological
and non-archeological historic properties pursuant to 36 CFR 800.4(d)(1).
If archeological resources are identified during any future construction on Parcel 2, work in the immediate
area should cease until the THC is contacted and accidental discovery procedures can be implemented.
