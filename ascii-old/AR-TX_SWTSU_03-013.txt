MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
Management Objectives
This report describes the results of investigations undertaken to assess the archaeological resources
at the Spring Lake Site, 41HY160, on the campus of Texas State University-San Marcos in Hays
County, Texas. The Spring Lake Site, 41HY160, was recorded in the 1980s at the Aquarena Center,
then a privately owned water park. In 1994 Texas State University-San Marcos purchased the Aquarena
Center with the intention of converting it into an educational and research facility focused on rivers
and springs in Texas. Eventually the University founded the River Systems Institute and it is now
housed at the Texas River Center in the restored Hotel at the San Marcos Springs. In preparation for
the construction planning for the Texas River Center, an archaeological testing project was undertaken
in January 2001 and this report describes the results of that investigation. The primary goal of this
project was to determine if intact and well-preserved archaeological materials were contained in the
area planned for eventually construction.

Conclusions and Recommendations
The archaeological investigations were designed to assess the geological context and the nature
of the preserved archaeological materials at the Spring Lake Site, 41HY160. An extensive geological
coring effort extracted 22 cores from over 9 meters of alluvial sediments in the San Marcos River
ﬂoodplain. These cores extended from the Hotel to beyond the football stadium. Five depositional
units (A-E from older to younger) were identiﬁed, which dated from the Late Pleistocene to the Late
Holocene, and all of these depositional units either contained preserved archaeological materials or
were contemporary with know archaeological occupations in the immediate vicinity of Spring Lake. A
single ﬂake was recovered from geological Core E in Depostional Unit A channel gravels. Radiocarbon
dates conﬁrm sediment accumulation spanning the last ~12,000 radiocarbon years. Archaeological test
units recovered a wide range of lithic tools, faunal remains, burned rock features and ﬂoral remains
that have been identiﬁed as Middle and Late Archaic, and Late Prehistoric in age. Five intact burned
rock features were excavated and documented. The careful excavation and archaeomagnetic analysis
of burned rock from the cooking features demonstrates the presence of burned rock cooking pits and
scattered burned rock hearths. These features were clearly constructed and used as cooking facilities
by prehistoric inhabitants. The prehistoric inhabitants also actively hunted a number of large animals
that consisted of bison, antelope and deer, and a variety of small species such as rabbits, turtle, ﬁsh,
rodents, and snakes. The more limited ﬂoral remains demonstrate the use of cheno-ams for food,
and oak, juniper and bald cypress for ﬁrewood. Better preserved plant remains were recovered from
Depositional Unit A in the geological Core D and these demonstrate the potential for well preserved
archaeological ﬂoral remains is great in the deeper portions of the site. A great diversity of chipped
stone artifacts (projectile points, preforms and other bifaces, scrapers and other unifaces, groundstone
tools) provide the most abundant evidence of technological activities, and production and procurement
strategies at the site. The wealth of evidence and the secure geological context of these materials,
clearly demonstrates that the potential for the recovery of signiﬁcant archaeological materials at the
Spring Lake Site, 41HY160, is great and it is recommended that any impacts of planned construction
iii

on archaeological resources be mitigated. All recovered materials are curated at the Archaeological
Curation Facility, Texas State University.

Project Description
This report discusses the results of Phase
I archaeological testing performed in January
2001 by the Center for Archaeological Studies
(CAS), Texas State, at the Texas Rivers Center
site (41HY160) in southern Hays County, Texas
(Figure 1-2). This testing project was an element
of the master plan and partnership between
the TPWD and Texas State to develop a public
interpretive and educational center.

CAS, in conjunction with the Texas Historical
Commission (THC), acted as the agencies
for oversight management of archaeological
compliance-related activities during the duration
of the testing. At the state level, the State Historic
Preservation Ofﬁcer (SHPO) at the Texas
Historical Commission Department of Antiquities
Protection (THC-DAP) evaluates the signiﬁcance

The purposes of this project
were 1) to determine the presence
or absence of cultural remains in
the areas to be impacted, and 2)
to evaluate the integrity of any
discovered cultural materials
and determine their potential
for
providing
signiﬁcant
archaeological
information.
Based on the excavation of six
1-x-1-m units, 22 new geological
cores and previous investigations,
this report documents the
presence of intact and well­
stratiﬁed archaeological deposits
within the upper 1.7 m of a 8­
9 meter thick intact alluvial
terrace in the ﬂoodplain adjacent
to the San Marcos Springs.
These alluvial deposits contain
human occupations dating from
Paleoindian to Late Prehistoric
times.

clients with preservation planning when those
resources are threatened. Texas Antiquities
Committee Permit Number 2510 was issued for
the project.
The site is situated within silty clay terrace
deposits surrounding the San Marcos Springs, at
the headwaters of the San Marcos River. Several
earlier projects by Southern Methodist University
(SMU) and Texas State archaeologists at this
site and ﬁve other sites within close proximity
identiﬁed cultural resources ranging in age from
approximately 11,500 years to 150 years ago. The
purpose of this testing project was to evaluate
the integrity of that portion of the site that was
threatened by planned construction activities. Six
1-x-1-m units were excavated within the footprint
of proposed new buildings. Test units were
limited to the upper, approximately 1.7 meters,
because of the high water table at the site. The
archaeological investigations were accompanied
and assisted by the geomorphological studies
performed by Lee C. Nordt of Baylor University.

Report Organization
This report is divided into twelve chapters and
ﬁve appendices. Chapter 2 provides a summary
of the unique environmental setting within the
Central Texas region, and more speciﬁcally,
around the headwaters of the San Marcos River.
The chronological context for the project area
is also discussed in Chapter 2. Implications for
buried sites derived from previous archaeological
investigations conducted around the San Marcos
Springs are synthesized in Chapter 3. Research
questions addressed during this project, and the
testing strategies employed to address them, are
included in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 discusses the
ﬁeld and laboratory methodologies employed to
address the speciﬁc research questions.

Fieldwork was conducted in January and
February 2001. Britt Bousman served as principal
investigator, and daily ﬁeld operations were
directed by the project archaeologist and Co-PI,
David Nickels. CAS staff members who worked
on the project in the ﬁeld and lab included Jimmy
Barrera, Brandon (Charlie) Burton, Carrie Davis,
Sheryl Gibbs, Linda Hodges, Ryan Kashanipour,
Michael McCarthy, Colby Michefsky, Dale
Norton, Antonio Padilla, Kevin Schubert,
Shawn Soucie, James Taylor, and Nathan Todd.
Additionally, Texas State student volunteers
Jennifer Cochran and Melissa Lehman assisted
with the ﬁeld and lab work. Field activities at the
site included site mapping, geological coring, and
hand excavating 1-x-1-m test units.

The results of geological coring and the
potential for buried cultural deposits within the
Pleistocene and Holocene sediments are presented
in Chapter 6. The results of the excavations, site
structure, and radiocarbon dates are discussed
in Chapter 7. The analysis of vertebrate and
plant remains are discussed in Chapters 8 and 9,

Environment
Introduction
The San Marcos Springs site (41HY160) at
the Texas River Center lies in southern Hays
County, and is situated in a deep alluvial terrace
at the conﬂuence of the headwaters of the San
Marcos River and an intermittent tributary, Sink
Creek (Figure 2-1). Clear cool waters emanate
from approximately 200 small artesian springs
and three large ﬁssures to form
the San Marcos Springs along
the Balcones Fault Line. The
area’s diverse ﬂora and fauna,
rich lithic resources, and reliable
spring waters have lured humans

The location of San Marcos
Springs makes it conducive to
inﬂuences from more than one
region. This chapter provides
a synopsis of environmental

encompassing the northern
fringe of the South Texas Brush
Country, the western portion of
the Gulf Coastal Prairies and
Marshes, the southeastern edge
of the Edwards Plateau, and the

southern tips of the Oak Woods and Prairies, and
Blackland Prairie in east-central Texas (Figure

Okallala clay loam (Ok) soils are generally
dark grayish brown in color, are moderately
alkaline throughout, with approximately 60
percent calcium carbonate, and an extremely

Archaeological investigations in
Okallala clay should thus be less

artifacts are more likely to be

cracking within archaeological
deposits occurs (e.g. Villa 1982;

Waters 1992:299-300; Nickels 2000:84-90).
The area around 41HY160 is an ecotone
incorporating an interface of diverse ecological
communities. These include the Juniper-OakMesquite Savanna, the Blackland Prairie, and
Oak-Hickory forest (Figure 2-5).

Lithic Resources
Immediately west of the site, rich sources
of chert crop out in the Edwards Plateau region.
Nodules and cobbles of good quality chert are
commonly found eroding out of the limestone
on the plateau itself, and in creek bed gravels
originating on the plateau (Barnes 1974; Black
and McGraw 1985; Potter et al. 1992). Evidence
of gravel beds has been located in the bottoms of

Historic alterations to the

include

Regional Paleoenvironment
Introduction
Recent research, particularly
during the past decade, has
contributed a great deal
toward
the
understanding
paleoenvironments of Texas (e.g.,
Bousman 1998; Brown 1998;
Caran 1998; Frederick 1998;
Fredlund et al. 1998; Kibler 1998;
Nordt et al. 2002; Ricklis and
Cox 1998). However, the Texas
paleoclimatic record contains
signiﬁcant gaps, primarily due

al. (1993) argue that summer temperatures in the
Late Pleistocene were 6° C cooler than present
averages, and that by ~13,000 B.P. (Toomey and
Stafford 1994), the wetter interval became warm
and more arid. For the period between 12,500
and 11,800 B.P., the Boriack Bog data indicate
that a drier episode stimulated a brief shift to
grasslands, and are corroborated by oxygenisotope ratios showing a cooler setting in South
Texas (Bousman 1992; 1994:80). Nordt et al.
(2002) also identify a cooler than modern period
occurring around 12,000 B.P. in the sediments
at Applewhite Reservoir. The Hall’s Cave
record indicates a wetter interval around 11,000
B.P. (Toomey and Stafford 1994), and microvertebrate fauna from Wilson-Leonard indicates
that prior to about 12,000 B.P., conditions were
relatively cooler and moister, followed by more
xeric conditions from about 11,500 to 11,000 B.P.
(Balinsky 1998).

to the scarcity of deep, ﬁnely stratiﬁed, and welldated deposits (Stahle and Cleaveland 1995:51).
Bousman (1998) suggests that Pleistocene biotic
communities have a different structure from
Holocene communities, caused by wetter winters
and drier summers, in a cooler climate.
Essentially, the arguments over ﬂuctuations
in the environment can be based upon the relative
percentages of grassland and arboreal pollen, C3
versus C4 opaline phytolith ratios, oxygen-isotope
ratios in mollusca, noble gas in aquifer waters, and
δ13C ratios in buried soils. Six paleoenvironmental
datasets within 240 kilometers (150 miles) of
41HY160, and from which relevant information
is useful, are: 1) Wilson-Leonard in Williamson
County, 2) Boriack Bog in Leon County, 3)
Hall’s Cave in Kerr County, 4) Fort Hood in
Bell and Coryell Counties, 5) Weakly Bog in
Leon County, and 6) the proposed Applewhite
Reservoir in Medina County
(see Figure 2-7). In the
discussion that follows, all
dates, unless otherwise stated,
are approximate, and are given
as radiocarbon years before
present (B.P.), i.e., before A.D.
1950.

B.P.)

correlate
C/13C ratios in
buried Applewhite soils with
two episodes of glacial melting

argue that the data demonstrate

B.P. Using data from Hall’s Figure 2-7.Study area and sites discussed in the text from which

and from Applewhite Reservoir in Medina
County, where a dry period for roughly the same
time frame (6000 to 4800 B.P.) is indicated. A
revised interpretation from Hall’s Cave also
argues for an arid episode, but between 7000 and
2500 B.P. (Toomey and Stafford 1994). Likewise,
the phytolith and microfauna records from the
Wilson-Leonard site in Central Texas (Balinsky
1998; Fredlund 1994) agree with increasing
aridity in the Middle Holocene, indicated by
spreading grasslands around 4400 B.P. and 4500
B.P., respectively. Finally, Johnson and Goode
(1994) also report a dry period occurring in the
Fort Hood area, but later still, between 5000 and
2500 B.P. (calibrated).

Early Holocene (10,000–7500 B.P.)
δ13C ratios from Applewhite soils (Nordt et al.
2002) indicate increasing temperatures between
11,000 and 10,000 B.P., toward the PleistoceneHolocene boundary, followed by perhaps a stable
climatic period between 10,000 and 9000 B.P.
Arboreal species in the Boriack Bog spectra show
a return of the woodlands between 9000 and
8000 B.P. As corroborating evidence, the WilsonLeonard microfaunal data suggest a presumably
moister period from about 9500–8750 B.P.,
followed by drier conditions (Balinsky 1998).
Molluscan data from the same site indicate a shift
from marshy to drier conditions around 9000
B.P. (Shaw 1998), and the phytolith data indicate
a similar change in climate (Fredlund 1998).
After 8000 B.P. woodlands rapidly declined,
and by 7500 B.P., open grassland communities
were predominant (Bryant 1977; Bousman 1998).
Although the estimated percentages of grass
cover have ﬂuctuated from 7500 B.P. through
the present, they appear to have remained
predominate over woodland percentages until
perhaps the past 350 years (Bousman 1994:80).

Late Holocene (4000 B.P.–Present)
Although the Wilson-Leonard phytolith
data suggest that by 4000 B.P. the woodlands/
grasslands mixture was very similar to today’s
(Fredlund 1998), there are indicators that the
climate continued to ﬂuctuate in the Late
Holocene. Based on stable carbon ratios from
deposits at Fort Hood, Nordt et al. (1994)
suggest a warm and dry episode between 3000
and 1500 B.P. However, at Hall’s Cave, Toomey
and Stafford (1994) see a wet period appearing
within this same time frame, at about 2500 B.P.
In a more precise argument, Bousman suggests
that the grass pollen frequencies found in the
Weakly Bog pollen spectra and Applewhite δ13C
ratios indicate unique drying episodes and a
slight cooling trend between approximately 1600
and 1500 B.P., and again between approximately
500 and 400 B.P. (Bousman 1994:80; Nordt et al.
2002).

Middle Holocene (7500–4000 B.P.)
Although Nordt et al. (2002) demonstrate
a marked cooling period around 7000 B.P. at
Applewhite, the Middle Holocene is often seen as
the beginning of the Altithermal drought, marked
by reduced rainfall and higher temperatures
substantially affecting subsistence and mobility
(Nordt 1992; Nordt et al. 2002; see also Johnson
and Goode 1994; Ellis et al. 1995; Bousman et al.
2002). At Boriack Bog, the continuous decline of
the woodlands in the Early Holocene was brieﬂy
reversed around 6000 B.P., but nevertheless
continued to decline until 5000 B.P. Around that
time, a wetter climate caused a slow increase in
arboreal pollen (Bousman 1994:80). This MidHolocene arid period indicated at Boriack Bog
agrees with data presented by Nordt et al. (1994)
from Fort Hood, in Bell and Coryell Counties,

Summary
The paleoenvironments of Texas are as varied
as the landscape. The waning of the Pleistocene,
or late-glacial period, marked a transition from
a cooler, wetter environment to one that steadily
grew warmer and drier, and more seasonal, with
11

intermittent moist periods through about 6000 B.P.
Most researchers generally agree that the period
between 6000 and 3000 years ago was warm and
dry. Over the past 3,000 years, intermittent moist
and dry intervals have occurred (see Figure 2-8).

Paleoindian
This period or interval spans approximately
2,700 years, estimated at between ca. 11,500–
8800 B.P. in Central Texas (Bousman et al. 2004;
Collins 1995:381–383, 2004). The Paleoindian
period begins before the close of the Pleistocene.
Diagnostic artifacts of the early Paleoindian
interval include Clovis and Folsom projectile
points. Late Paleoindian period occupations begin
with the ﬁrst stemmed (as opposed to lanceolate)
points known as Wilson (Bousman 1998;
Bousman et al. 2002), and a variety of lanceolate
forms such as Angostura, Golondrina, St. Mary’s
Hall, and Barber (among a few others). Within
Texas’ political boundaries, Meltzer and Bever
(1995:47–81) have documented the presence of
406 Clovis points in 128 of 254 counties.

It is unlikely that the climate has changed
signiﬁcantly in the past few thousand years in the
area surrounding San Marcos Springs as to induce
marked vegetation changes. The greater changes
have been induced by human intervention through
the clearing of wooded areas along the rivers for
construction purposes; pumping more water for
irrigation, which has lowered water tables; and
overgrazing by livestock. Although there are still
many seeps, springs, and streams in the area,
they probably ﬂowed with greater abundance
during wetter intervals than at the present time,
which would have provided abundant resources
for prehistoric occupants.

In general, Paleoindian adaptations have
been considered to be one of small bands of
nomadic, big-game hunters following herds of
Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth,
mastodon, bison, camel, and horse, across North
America (Black 1989a). More recently, emphasis
has been placed on the wide diversity of plants
and animals used by these early Americans
for subsistence, such as turtles and tortoises,
alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons (Black
1989a; Bousman et al. 2004; Collins 1995:381,
2004; Collins and Brown 2000), although they
undoubtedly hunted large animals as well (Dibble
and Lorraine 1968).

Cultural Chronology
Introduction
This section provides a brief synthesis of
cultural time periods identiﬁed in Central Texas
(see Figure 2-8). As in the previous section, all
dates in the following discussion are approximate,
and are given as radiocarbon years before present
(B.P.), i.e., before A.D. 1950. Prewitt (1981, 1985),
building on the work of Weir (1976), sorted through
the mass of archaeological data from Central
Texas and established a chronology deﬁned by
stages and phases. Collins (1995, 2004) reviewed
the evidence for Central Texas and offered new
temporal estimates for human occupations from
the Paleoindian through Historic periods. Johnson
and Goode (1994) accomplished the same for the
Eastern Edwards Plateau. Based on the research
by Joel Shiner and others it is clear that the San
Marcos Springs have been occupied continually
from Clovis times.

Known Clovis sites include killsites,
quarries, caches, open campsites, ritual sites, and
burials (Collins 1995:381–383, 2004). However,
most Paleoindian ﬁnds in Central Texas have
consisted of surface lithic scatters on upland
terraces and ridges (Black 1989b:25, 1989c:48).
A few Paleoindian components deeply buried
in alluvium have been discovered, such as
Berclair Terrace in Bee County (Sellards 1940),
Berger Bluff in Goliad County (Brown 1987),

distributed and that diagnostic projectile point
types are seen across a wide area, including most
of Texas and northern Mexico.

Kincaid Rockshelter in Uvalde County (Collins
et al. 1989), Wilson-Leonard in Williamson
County (Bousman et al. 2002; Collins et al.
1993; Collins 1998, 2004), and the Gault site in
Williamson County (Collins and Brown 2000).
As the warming that marks the transition from
Pleistocene to Holocene climates began to take
effect in Texas, prehistoric inhabitants adapted
with changes in lifestyle (Bousman et al. 2002).
This climatic shift is also marked by the population
decline and eventual extinction of mammoth,
mastodon, horse, and camel. The evolution of
giant bison (Bison antiquus) into modern bison
(Bison bison) apparently took place during the
Late Paleoindian period well after the end of the
Pleistocene (Lewis et al. 2007).

Story believes that population densities
were low during the Early Archaic, and that
groups consisted of related individuals in small
bands with “few constraints on their mobility”
(Story 1985:39). Their economy was based on
the utilization of a wide range of resources,
especially such year-round resources as prickly
pear and lechugilla, as well as rodents, rabbits,
and deer (Story 1985:38).

Middle Archaic
Collins (1995:383, 2004) deﬁnes this
intermediate interval of the Archaic as lasting
from about 6000–4000 B.P. in Central Texas.
The Middle Archaic appears to have been a time
of increased population in Central Texas, based
on the large number of sites in the region from
this period (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125, 128).
Weir (1976:126) suggests that as the climate
became more moist, deer and acorn-producing
oaks thrived in Central Texas, attracting groups
at least seasonally, from all other regions
of Texas. The current understanding of the
paleoenvironmental record conﬂicts with this
interpretation. McKinney (1981:114) suggests
that as the climate became drier during the
Middle Holocene, Central Texas groups, as well
as groups from other regions accustomed to arid
conditions, would have moved into the Central
Texas Hill Country (the Edwards Plateau).
Perhaps not by coincidence, cemeteries make
their ﬁrst appearance during the later part of
this period, suggesting a movement toward less
mobility and perhaps territorialism.

Archaeological evidence suggests that after
10,000 B.P., large gregarious game animals, except
bison, were extinct in Texas. Human hunters
were forced to concentrate on deer, antelope, and
other medium-size or smaller game. Changes in
the subsistence base required technological shifts
that mark the beginning of a new cultural period
known as the Archaic.

Early Archaic
Collins (1995:383, 2004) dates the Early
Archaic from 8800 to 6000 B.P. in Central Texas.
The extinction of large herds of megafauna and the
changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene
(ca. 10,000 B.P.) stimulated a behavioral change
by the prehistoric inhabitants of North America.
While the basic hunter-gatherer adaptation
remained intact, an economic shift away from
big game hunting was necessary. In general,
more intensive exploitation of local and smaller
resources in Central Texas—such as deer, ﬁsh,
and plant bulbs—is indicated by greater densities
of ground stone artifacts, ﬁre-cracked rock
cooking features, and more specialized tools.
Weir (1976) speculates that Early Archaic groups
were small and highly mobile, an inference based

A wide variation in projectile point styles
suggests an increase in the diversity of game
animals taken seasonally, along with a shift to

concentrated, seasonal nut harvests in the riverine
environments of the Balcones Escarpment
(Black 1989a; Hall 1998). Weir (1976) believes
that an expansion of oak on the Edwards Plateau
and Balcones Escarpment led to intensive plant
gathering and acorn processing. He also believes
that the widely scattered bands prevalent in the
Early Archaic now began to coalesce, at least
during the acorn-gathering season, into larger
groups who shared the intensive work of gathering
and processing the acorn harvest (Weir 1976:126).
Many researchers believe burned rock middens
are a result of this endeavor (Creel 1986; Prewitt
1991; Weir 1976), but other investigators doubt
this conclusion (Black et al. 1997; Goode 1991)
Regardless, the exact processes which formed
these middens are still a matter of controversy
(Black 1989b:28; Black et al. 1997; Leach and
Bousman 2001; Leach et al. 2005; Mauldin et al.
2003).

Some researchers believe populations
increased throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt
1985), while others feel populations remained the
same or fell during this period (Black 1989b:30).
Story (1985:44–45) believes the presence of
cemeteries at sites such as Ernest Witte in Austin
County (Hall 1981), and Hitzfelder Cave (Givens
1968) and Olmos Dam (Lukowski 1988) in Bexar
County, indicates that Late Archaic populations
in Central Texas were increasing and becoming
more territorial.
Prewitt (1981:80–81) asserts that the
accumulation of burned rock middens nearly
ceased during the course of this period; however,
excavations at the Blue Hole site in Uvalde County
(Mueggenborg 1994:1–74), the Honey Creek
midden at 41MS32 in Mason County (Black
et al. 1997), the Mingo site in Bandera County
(Houk and Lohse 1993:193–248), the Mustang
Branch site in Hays County (Ricklis and Collins
1994), and multiple middens in Brown County
(Mauldin et al. 2003) provide evidence that large
cooking features up to 15 m in diameter were
still very much in use (see also Black et al. 1997).
In addition, recent research has documented a
predominance of radiocarbon dates from Central
Texas middens that fall within the latter part of
the Late Archaic and into the early part of the Late
Prehistoric (Mauldin et al. 2003). Subsistence
is assumed to have become less specialized on
acorns, in favor of a broad spectrum subsistence
base (Black 1989b:30). By about 1450 B.P., bison
populations had again declined (Dillehay 1974).

The common presence of deer remains
in burned rock middens encourages the view
that processing and cooking of deer took place
at these sites (Nickels et al. 2001; Black and
McGraw 1985:278; Weir 1976:125). Bison bone
is encountered in archaeological sites in central
Texas, at least occasionally, during all but the
earliest part of the Middle Archaic (Dillehay
1974). There has been a tendency to equate the
presence of burned rock middens with the absence
of bison (Prewitt 1981); however, examinations
of several recent faunal reports show that after
about 4500 B.P., bison and burned rock middens
are contemporaneous, at least in the southern
Edwards Plateau and northern South Texas Plain
(Meissner 1993).

Late Archaic
Late Prehistoric

Collins (1995:384, 2004) dates the ﬁnal interval
of the Archaic in Central Texas to approximately
4000–1200 B.P. The most commonly found point
types during the Late Archaic are Ensor and Frio,

The term “Late Prehistoric” is commonly
used to designate the period following the Late
Archaic period, and is generally thought of as
15

spanning the period 1200–420 B.P. (Collins
1995, 2004). Although Collins (1995:385, 2004)
contends that the commonly used date of 1200
B.P. for the end of the Archaic, and beginning of
the Late Prehistoric in Central Texas is arbitrary,
a series of distinctive traits marks the shift
from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period,
including the technological shift to the bow and
arrow and the introduction of pottery (Black
1989b:32; Story 1985:45–47). Two distinct phases
recognized within the Late Prehistoric period in
Central Texas are the Austin and Toyah phases.

Toyah Phase
Beginning rather abruptly at about 650 B.P.
in Central Texas, a shift in technology occurred.
This phase is characterized by the introduction
of blade technology, the ﬁrst ceramics in central
Texas (bone-tempered plain wares known as
Leon Plain), a shift from an expanding stem type
to a narrow contracting stem type called “Perdiz,”
and alternately beveled bifaces (Black 1989b:32;
Huebner 1991:346). The Perdiz arrow point
may best represent the appearance of a distinct
culture in south-central Texas lasting for about
300 years, which archaeologists have labeled the
Toyah phase.

Austin Phase
Most researchers agree that the earlier
Austin Phase of the Late Prehistoric period was
a time of population decrease in Central Texas
(Black 1989b:32). During the Austin phase, there
appears to be a subtle transition period (Hester
1995, 2004) when expanding stem dart points
may have been used as early arrow points (e.g.
Edwards point). Nevertheless, the most prevalent
point found in Austin phase sites is the Scallorn
arrow point.

In the late 1940s, J. C. Kelley (1947a; 1947b)
identiﬁed the Perdiz arrow point with what he
termed the Toyah Foci. Six years later, Jelks (1953)
demonstrated that in general, Austin Foci Scallorn
were found underlying Toyah Foci Perdiz and
Cliffton arrow points in the Blum Rockshelter. A
few years after that, Suhm (1957) conﬁrmed the
predominance of Perdiz and Cliffton points as
characteristic of the Toyah assemblage, vertically
positioned over Austin Foci Scallorn points.
Other apparently intrusive arrow points in Toyah
assemblages include Fresno points from North
Texas.

Even though small burned rock middens
associated with Scallorn and Edwards points
have been found (Goode 1991:71; Houk and
Lohse 1993:193–248), they are rare. Settlement
shifts into rock shelters have been noted during
this time (e.g., Fox and Fox 1967; Shafer 1977;
Skinner 1981). Cemeteries from this period often
reveal evidence of conﬂict (Black 1989b:32). For
example, an excavation of a burial just north of
San Antonio (41BX952) revealed an Edwards
point between two lumbar vertebra (Meissner
1991). Additionally, six human skeletons were
exhumed from the Loeve-Fox site in Williamson
County “with arrow points (all of the Scallorn
type) in such a manner as to suggest that the
penetration of projectiles was the cause of death”
(Prewitt 1974:46).

Jelks’ Toyah traits include: Perdiz and
Cliffton arrow points, double-pointed and
beveled knives, gravers, small drills, stone sidescrapers, expedient scrapers, crude bifaces,
bison bone scrapers, deer bone spatulates, bone
awls, Leon Plain and possibly intrusive pottery,
ground stone, hematite pigment, worked mussel
shells, smoothed antler tines, pendants, tubular
bone beads, ﬁshhooks, and needles, along with
perishable wood and grass/mat items (Jelks 1962:
86-90).

associated bison (Black 1986; Black and McGraw
1985; Henderson 1978;; Prewitt 1974).

In Jelks’ opinion,
The Toyah Focus probably came to an
end during the Late Prehistoric period, at
which time it was replaced over much or all
of central Texas by a short-lived complex
of artifacts that included triangular arrow
points, Goliad Plain pottery (described by
Monger 1959:164-165), and probably other
distinctive artifact styles. This hypothetical
complex–if it actually exists–may represent
the archaeological remains of the historic
and protohistoric Tonkawa and/or Jumano
Indians [1962:99].

Although bone-tempered pottery with
stick-brushed exteriors is considered diagnostic
to Toyah, intrusive wares are also present.
Sometimes found are asphaltum-coated sherds, a
Karankawan, Texas Gulf Coast tradition. Some
of the vessels found at Toyah sites are identical in
decoration to Northeast Texas Caddoan vessels.
Others show a Jornada Mogollon inﬂuence,
particularly ollas, while others appear very
similar to the Los Angeles type found in Sierra
de Tamalipas. In many cases, the jars found at
Toyah sites contain residue, presumably from
boiling bones for grease. The faunal assemblages
would seem to support this presumption, as most
are severely splintered, crushed, and broken. The
fact that crushed bone appears in much of Toyah
pottery may not be a coincidence (Hester 1995,
2004).

Prewitt (1985) and Black (1989b) suggest
Toyah technology encroached from north-central
Texas. However, Patterson (1988) notes the Perdiz
point was ﬁrst seen in southeast Texas by about
1350 B.P. and was introduced to the west some
600–700 years later. In contrast, Johnson (1994;
1995) suggests that the Perdiz point seems to
have had its origin along the western periphery
of the Edwards Plateau and perhaps its advanced
technology spread quickly. Although its style is
unique, and some would argue that style is the
indicator of social group identity and thus change
(e.g. Sackett 1989, Weissner 1983), Johnson
and Goode (1994) offer that it was functionally
designed to hunt bison. Johnson believes the
piercing point would have been ideal if shot in
adequate numbers to make the bison slowly bleed
to death. Perdiz projectile points are widely found
throughout Texas, and often associated with bison
kills (e.g. Ricklis and Collins 1994).

The only archaeological evidence that
domesticated plants were ever introduced in
Central Texas consists of a single corncob found in
Late Prehistoric context in Timmeron Rockshelter
in Hays County (Harris 1985), another found
during excavations in Kyle Shelter in Hill County
(Jelks 1962:113-114), and Zea mays remains at the
Wild Turkey Midden (41MI8) in Mills County
(Holloway 1988:4, 8). Not enough evidence exists
to postulate there was ever a signiﬁcant presence
of maize in the area. The arrival of the Spanish
during the later Protohistoric/Historic period
brought signiﬁcant cultivars to Central Texas.

Huebner (1991:354-355) suggests that the
sudden return of bison to Central Texas resulted
from a more xeric climate in the plains north of
Texas and increased grasses in the Cross-Timbers
and Post Oak Savannah in North-Central Texas,
forming a “bison corridor” into the South Texas
Plain along the eastern edge of the Edwards
Plateau. Sites from this period frequently have

Protohistoric and Historic Periods
The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning
of the Protohistoric period in Central Texas is
characterized by written accounts of European
contact with indigenous groups (Wade 2003). The
Protohistoric period begins in 1528 when Spanish
explorer Cabeza de Vaca traversed parts of Texas
17

Many historians believe that the Daycao
River was the modern Trinity River, however
the Caddo village was in the vicinity of modernday Nacogdoches and the Trinity River is only
60 miles (~90 km) away. This is a very short
distance to travel over ten days on horses. Also
no “mountains’ are found on the west side
of the Trinity River. It is more likely that the
mountains were probably the Edwards Plateau
at the Balcones Escarpment and the river was
probably either the Colorado or the Guadalupe.
Austin is approximately 200 miles (~300 km)
from Nacogdoches and this is a more reasonable
distance. The people may have been the hunting
and gathering Toyah. Obviously the Caddo did
not know these people well and it is also obvious
that Toyah sites have very few Caddo trade items
(Collins 1995, 2004).

and left a diary of his ﬁve years spent among the
hunter-gatherers of Texas and northern Mexico
(see for example, Hallenbeck 1940; Covey 1961;
Sauer 1971; Hickerson 1994). In 1541, Coronado
entered the Texas Panhandle with hopes of
ﬁnding riches (Winship 1896; Flint and Flint
1997); the same year, after assuming command
from Hernando de Soto, Spanish explorer Luis
de Moscoso Alvarado ventured into Texas and
encountered Caddoan-speaking and other groups
before turning back (Swanton 1985). In 1568
while returning to Nova Scotia from Mexico,
Englishman David Graham passed inland along
the Texas Gulf Coast (Cutrer 1985:7-12).
It is probable that the ﬁrst Spanish explorers
to reach Central Texas were a small contingency
sent by Moscoso to scout west from the East
Texas Caddo villages. The chronicler Elvan
documents:

By the 1540s and 1550s, Spanish ranchers
had established large ranches in northern Mexico,
with several hundred thousand cattle and Native
Americans used as slave labor. Large mining
ventures in northern Mexico did the same. This
encroachment from the south forced Native
Americans to escape into the South-Central
Texas region. In 1598 the Spanish pushed into
New Mexico, and made Santa Fe the capital.
Archaeological evidence from the Longhorn Site
the Southern Plains demonstrates that horses and
cattle were quickly adopted by Plains Indians in
the early 17th Century (Boyd and Peck 1992). The
harsh treatment of the Pueblo Indians in Northern
New Mexico lead to the Pueblo Rebellion of 1680.
The Spanish and a few loyal native groups ﬂed to
the El Paso area, establishing Isleta Pueblo, but
left behind thousands of horses, dramatically
increasing access to horses at this time.

There the [Caddo] Indians told them that ten
days’ journey thence toward the west was a
river called Daycao where they sometimes
went to hunt in the mountains and to kill
deer; and that on the other side of it they
had seen people, but did not know what
village it was. ... After marching for ten
days through an unpeopled region [they]
reached the river of which the Indians had
spoken. Ten of horse, whom they governor
had sent on ahead, crossed over to the other
side, and went along the road leading to the
river. They came upon an encampment of
Indians who were living in very small huts.
As soon as they saw them, they took ﬂight,
abandoning their possessions, all of which
were wretchedness and poverty. The land
was so poor than among them all, they did
not ﬁnd a “alqueire” of maize” (Swanton
1985: 263).

When the Spanish missions were established
in East Texas in the late 1600s, Spanish entradas
became common in Central Texas. One of the
ﬁrst was Alonso de León’s expedition of 1680
18

when the Camino Real (King’s Road) was ﬁrst
established as a Spanish trail from Villa Santiago
de la Monclova in Mexico to East Texas. This
roadway followed established Native American
trade routes. These expeditions provide the ﬁrst
detailed written observations on the original
Native Americans and landscape in the San
Marcos area.

and they also border with the Salineros Indians
and the Apaches, with whom they are often at
war. The Apaches live in a mountain range that
runs from east to west (Hatcher 1932: 58). This
mountain range is probably the southern side of
the Balcones Escarpment between San Antonio
and Del Rio, and the Rio del Norte is probably
the Rio Grande.

Written records show that various groups
lived near the San Marcos Springs during the
Protohistoric period. Some of these groups
probably lived permanently in the San Marcos
area, e.g., Cantona, Muruam, Payaya, Sana
and Yojuane, while others came to the region
seasonally on bison hunts, e.g., Catqueza,
Caynaaya, Chalome, Cibola and Jumano
(Newcomb 1993; Johnson and Campbell 1992;
Foster 1995:265-289). Later groups such as the
Tonkawa, Lipan Apache and Comanche migrated
south from Oklahoma and the Plains and replaced
the former groups through warfare, diseases and
settlement at the Spanish missions (Dunn 1911:
Campbell and Campbell 1985; Newcomb 1961,
1993; Wade 2003).

On June 18, 1691 the Domingo Terán de los
Ríos expedition camped at the Indians’ rancheria
near the Comal Springs at the headwaters of the
Comal River. The Native American name of
the Comal Springs was Conaqueyadita, which
means “where the river rises.” The large number
of Native Americans at the Comal Springs
worried the Spanish and they left for a nearby
camping location that is now known as the San
Marcos Springs. The Domingo Terán de los Ríos
expedition camped there from June 20-25, 1691,
and they saw many buffaloes and ﬁsh while at
the San Marcos Springs. But during the ﬁrst
night their horses stampeded, and they spent the
next few days recovering the horses. In the end
only 35 horses were retrieved. Approximately 75
horses escaped. (Hatcher 1932:15). On June 23,
1691 approximately 60 Cantona Indians visited
the Spanish camp at the San Marcos Springs
and recorded their name for the springs as
Canocanayestatetlo, which means “hot water”
(Hatcher 1932:60). At this time the chroniclers
for the Domingo Terán de los Ríos expedition
noted that the Native Americans to the south
and west of the San Marcos River all spoke the
same language but the groups to the north spoke
a different language (Foster 1995:58).

The ﬁrst Spanish fording of the San Marcos
River was in 1690 by Alonso de León (Foster
1995). In 1691 the Domingo Terán de los Ríos
expedition arrived at the Guadalupe and Comal
Rivers from the south. At the Comal Springs
they encounter a group of 2,000-3,000 mounted
Choma, Cibola, Cantona, Cholome, Catqueza
and Chaynaya Indians. Fray Massanet noted that
“every year they come to the headwaters of the
Guadalupe River and sometimes as far as the
Tejas country. They come to kill buffaloes and
carry away the skins because in their country,
there are not buffaloes. When it gets cold they
return to their own country” (Hatcher 1932: 58­
59). Massanet also stated that the Choma, Cibola,
Cantona, Cholome, Catqueza and Chaynaya
Indians live in along the banks of the Rio del Norte

Over the 50 years from the ﬁrst Spanish
visit to San Marcos area in 1680 until 1730, nine
Spanish expeditions traveled to San Marcos. In
addition to the three expeditions discussed above,
the Governor Gregoria de Salinas Varona visited
the San Marcos area on June 27 in 1693 (Foster

1976).

1995: 77-93). On April 15, 1709 the EspinosaOliveres-Aguirre expedition was at the San
Marcos Springs (Foster 1995:95-106). Captain
Domingo Ramón, Espinosa and Saint-Denis
were at the Springs on May 20, 1716 (Foster
1995:109-125). Governor Martín de Alarcón
lead an expedition that reached the San Marcos
River on May 9, 1718, and on May 13, 1718 on
the return trip he named the San Marcos River
the ‘Rio de Inocentes” (Hoffman 1935:85; Foster
1995:169). In 1721 the Marqués de San Miguel de
Aguayo visited the San Marcos Springs and in
1727 Brigadier Pedro de Rivera’s inspection tour
reached the San Marcos area (Santos 1981; Foster
1995:145-161, 163-175; Jackson 1995).

Many factors led to the abandonment of the
San Gabriel missions: drought, an epidemic,
immoral behavior of the soldiers and commander,
Apache attacks, neophyte desertions, and
unhealthy conditions. Between 1755 and 1756 the
San Xavier missions were temporarily located
on the San Marcos River (Bolton 1970:263-278
[1915]), but the exact location in San Marcos is
unknown.
While the missions were at San Marcos over
1,000 Lipan Apaches joined the missions. The
Apaches convinced the Spanish missionaries to
establish a mission and presidio for them in their
own territory to protect them from Comanches. In
1756 the property from the San Xavier missions
was assigned to the ill-fated Santa Cruz de San
Sabá Mission, and in 1757 the presidio soldiers
were assigned to the new San Luis de las Amarillas
Presidio near the new Mission. Both were built
near the present-day town of Menard on the San
Saba River (Weddle 1964). The neophytes from
the San Xavier missions at San Marcos were
sent to the San Antonio missions, except for the
Mayeyes. The Spanish built a separate mission
for them on the Guadalupe River near New
Braunfels, but it was abandoned in 1758.

The first Spanish settlement in Central Texas
was at San Antonio with the establishment of the
Mission San Antonio de Valero (the Alamo) in
1718 and later with the founding of San Antonio
de Béxar (Bolton 1970 [1915]; Habig 1968; de
la Teja 1995). A number of Native American
groups occupied the area around San Antonio,
and these have been classified under the term
Coahuiltecan, (Campbell and Campbell 1985) but
at least by 1721 Apaches had begun to replace the
native Coahuiltecans (Wade 2003:161). However
the first Spanish settlement in San Marcos was
not until 1755. In August of that year the San
Francisco Xavier de Horcasitas, San Ildefonso,
and Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria missions
and the San Francisco Xavier de Gigedo Presidio
were abandoned on the San Gabriel River near
Rockdale and established temporarily at San
Marcos. The San Francisco Xavier de Horcasitas
Mission was originally established for the
Tonkawan groups known as Yojuane, Mayeye
and Ervipiame (Himmel 1999). San Ildefonso
Mission was founded for the Atakapan groups
called Akokisa, Bidai and Deadose. Mostly
Karankawan groups such as the Coco, Top and
Orocoquisa populated Nuestra Señora de la
Candelaria Mission, but the Bidai, an Atakapan

After the missions at San Marcos were
removed, the most complete record of Spanish
visiting the San Marcos Springs comes from letters
written by Athanase de Mézières to Teodoro de
Croix. The first letter, dated September 25, 1779,
states:
“having halted near the head of the San
Marcos River, a worthy rival of the San
Xavier (Brushy Creek) in respect to the
conveniences which it offers for settlement,

from an ill-proportioned mount such a
volume of water that it [at] once becomes a

caves, with wonderful formations, here are
some steps, an altar, frontal candlesticks,
and a font; there, curtains, festoons, ﬂowers,

there is no lack of benches, which invite
the spectator to contemplate at leisure
ﬁgures, some sacred, some profane, upon
which nature has spent so much care that
our Europe may well grieve at not being
endowed with their equal. ... I have just

him of a trail of ten or twelve men, which

not have disastrous consequences. May
God, etc. Salado, September 25, 1779. I kiss
the hand of your Lordship, etc. Atanasio de
Mesieres” [Bolton 1914: (II) 283-285].

During the Spanish period the Tonkawa
tribe became associated with the San Marcos
Springs. This was due partly to the missions
moving there temporarily in the mid 1700s, but
the abandonment of the area by the original
inhabitants was certainly another factor. Much
of what is known about the Tonkawa comes
from the work of Newcomb (1961, 1993). Recent
linguistic analysis shows that the original Native
Americans in the San Marcos area, such as the
Sana, were not Tonkawa and apparently the
Tonkawa migrated south from Oklahoma in the
1700s (Johnson and Campbell 1992).
In the second half of the 18th century, the
area north of the Guadalupe River was unsettled.
The land was the King’s Lands (realengas)
and neither the missions nor ranchers from
San Antonio could herd cattle there (Jackson
1986:59-60). A plan was developed to move the
Adaesanos (displaced people from Los Adaes)
between the San Marcos and Guadalupe rivers
to alleviate the need for agricultural and grazing
land near San Antonio (Jackson 1986:184-185).
At that time there was much tension between the
citizens of San Antonio de Béxar and the missions
(de la Teja 1995). In 1772 the Baron de Ripperda
suggested that a small fort and a settlement
should be established at the San Marcos Springs,
but this did not happen (Bolton 1914: [I] 335-336),
and the Adaesanos were told that they could take
over the agricultural lands of the Missions Valero
, even though that never came to pass (Jackson
1986: 185).

In a summary of Athanase de Mézières’
letters, on May 23, 1780, de Croix states “the
San Marcos River rises in a large channel
of water which springs from a great rock, in
the neighborhood of which are wonderful
crystallizations which represent various figures”
(Bolton 1914: (II) 315).
The only archaeological evidence of
Native American occupation at the Springs
during the Protohistoric Period comes from
the site of 41HY165 (Ringstaff 2000). A single
Mission projectile point was excavated by Chris
Ringstaff near the modern Spring Lake dam.
No other evidence was recovered. There is

It was not until 1808, when the village of San
Marcos de Neve was established under the King’s
name on the San Marcos River, downstream from
the modern town at the El Camino Real crossing,
but it was abandoned in 1812 because of ﬂooding

(Stovall et al. 1986). Some of this property is now
within the town of San Marcos. On December
22, 1840 Nathaniel Lewis purchased 640 acres
that included the headwarters of the San Marcos
Springs from Rafael and Maria Veramendi (Hays
County Deeds and Records [HCDR] Vol. A:10).
On August 21, 1845 General Edward Burleson
and Dr. Eli T. Merriman bought this 640 acres
from Lewis (HCDR A:169) and the portion that
Burleson acquired included the headwaters and
springs of the San Marcos River.

and Indian raids (Horrell 1999). This was the
last ofﬁcial Spanish community established in
Texas.
In 1827, Mexico had gained its independence
from Spain and European settlers were moving
westward across the Coastal Plains and
Blackland Prairies toward the Edwards Plateau.
During the period of Mexican rule in 1831 Juan
Martin de Veramendi, a native of San Antonio
and the ninth governor of Coahuila y Texas under
Mexican rule, received a land grant consisting of
two leagues in the area that is now San Marcos.
When Veramendi died of cholera in 1833 in
Saltillo, portions of his holdings, including land
at San Marcos were inherited by his daughter,
Maria Josepha Veramendi Garza and her husband
Rafael Garza.

A year after Burleson bought the San Marcos
Springs, William McClintock, a volunteer with the
Second Kentucky Regiment during the War with
Mexico (he was killed in 1847 during the Battle
of Buena Vista) wrote a detailed description of
the San Marcos Springs and surrounding area:
“2 miles north of St. Marks we crossed the
Blanco, a mountain torrent of purest water,
narrow and deep, there is the ﬁnest spring
or springs (for they are not less than 50 in
a distance of 200 yds.) I ever beheld. These
springs gush from the foot of a high cliff
and boil up as from a well in the middle of
the channel. One of these, the ﬁrst you see
in going up the stream, is near the center,
the channel is here 40 yds wide, the water
15 or 20 feet deep, yet so strong is the
ebullition of the spring, that the water is
thrown two or three feet above the surface
of the stream. I am told that by approaching
it in a canoe, you may see down in the
chasm from whence the water issues. Large
stones are thrown up, as you’ve seen grains
of sand in small springs, it is unaffected
by the dryest season. I am persuaded that
the quantity of water which is carried off
by this stream in the course of a year is
greater than that by the South Licking, it
is about 60 feet wide and 3 feet deep on an
average, with a current of not less than ten

By 1836, Texas had gained its independence
from Mexico and Texas Rangers offered better
protection from Native Americans resisting
encroachment. After the war in 1840 the Republic
of Texas passed “An Act to Provide for the
Protection of the Northern and Western Frontier”
(Texas Republic 1839). In the San Marcos area
this resulted in the building of a road between
Austin and San Antonio known as Post Road
and a fort established at the headwaters of the
San Marcos River known as Post San Marcos.
William Lindsey surveyed and laid out the road
from Austin to Post San Marcos. Adjunct General
Hugh McLeod laid out the fort and Captain
Josepha Wiehl’s company, the First Infantry
Regiment, garrisoned the fort in October 1840
(Pierce 1969:150-151). In March 1841 the Texas
army was disbanded and the Post San Marcos
troops marched to Austin where they were
discharged (Pierce 1969:151). The fort has never
been located or direct evidence recovered.
During this time William Lindsey began to
purchase land from the Rafael and Maria Veramendi

The town of St. Marks, (that is to be, for

the loveliest spots in nature. Immediately

Edward Burleson built a two-roomed log
house on the edge of the Balcones Escarpment
overlooking the San Marcos Springs in 1848
(Bousman and Nickels 2003) and he lived there
until died in 1851 of pneumonia in Austin while
serving as a state senator (Jenks and Kesselus
1990). During his years in Texas Burleson became
close friends with Placio, a Tonkawa chief,
and Placio visited Burleson at his San Marcos
home annually (Himmell 1999). After his death,
Burleson’s wife sold the property, known as the
Homestead Tract, in 1855 (Bousman and Nickels
2003). Eventually the property was sold to A. B.
Rogers in 1926 (HCDR 91:458), who in the 1940s
began to develop the property as a theme park
known as Aquarena Springs. The San Marcos
Springs remained under private ownership until
1994 when Texas State University purchased the
property (Bousman and Nickels 2003).

PREVIOUS R ESEARCH AND POTENTIAL FOR
BURIED SITES
C. Britt Bousman

Potential for Buried Archaeologi
cal Deposits
The archaeological and geoarchaeological
investigations described in the following two
sections demonstrate the great potential for
human occupation in and around the San
Marcos Springs. Evidence for prehistoric
occupation began at least by the Clovis period
at approximately 11,500 years ago, and extends
through the Late Prehistoric period, ending about
260 years ago. Historic documents record the use
of the springs by Spanish and Native American
groups in the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries, and in the
mid-nineteenth century by early
settlers such as General Edward
Burleson.

are 41HY37, 41HY147, 41HY160, 41HY161,
41HY165, and 41HY306 (Shiner 1981, 1983;

and Lyle 1998; Goelz 1999; Arnn et al. 1999; Lyle
et al. 2000; Ringstaff 2001).
In 1978 Joel Shiner (1979, 1981, 1983) began
underwater investigations at 41HY161 (the Ice
House Site) below the dam at Spring Lake. This site

than a semi-sedentary mobility pattern.

appeared to be disturbed and contained a mixture
of prehistoric, mostly Archaic, and historic
artifacts. In 1979 Shiner shifted his attention to
the underwater excavation of 41HY147 (known
as the Terrace Locality) in Spring Lake adjacent
to a large spring-eye. A mid-nineteenth century
dam forms Spring Lake at Aquarena Springs and
it ﬂooded the once-dry alluvial terrace deposits.
In his underwater excavations at 41HY147, Shiner
recognized three strata on an eroded slope at the
base of the escarpment. The top stratum was
approximately 20-30 cm thick and consisted of a
gray matrix with shouldered and notched Archaic
projectile points. The middle stratum was a 10­
20-cm-thick red sandy deposit with shouldered
and lanceolate projectile points, clearly mixed
deposits with Archaic and Paleoindian artifacts.
The lowest layer was a 30-40-cm-thick red clay
with Paleoindian lanceolate projectile points
and numerous mega-faunal remains, including
mammoth and mastodon teeth, and bison bone.

In 1990 and 1991, Paul Takac, a graduate
student at Southern Methodist University,
continued Shiner’s underwater excavations
at 41HY147 (Takac 1990, 1991a, 1991b). His
project was eventually abandoned because of the
difﬁculty and costs involved in careful underwater
excavations. Nevertheless, he documented a total
of 46 Paleoindian projectile points collected by
Shiner and himself at 41HY147, with most being
Late Paleoindian in age.
Texas State ﬁeld school participants, under the
direction of James Garber, began to investigate
sites near the San Marcos Springs, including
41HY37, 41HY160, 41HY161, and 41HY165 in
1982. Garber et al. (1983) reported on the 1982 ﬁeld
school at 41HY160. This site is on the peninsula
between Spring Lake and Sink Creek at the
Aquarena Center golf course. Thirty-four square
meters were excavated in the vicinity of T-Box 6.
The deepest excavation unit (XU1) extended to a
depth of 2.4 meters below the surface. Intact Late
Prehistoric through Early Archaic occupations
were exposed. Garber et al. (1983) recovered
over 35,600 lithic artifacts, including 504 lithic
tools and 53 diagnostic projectile points. Late
Prehistoric projectile points such as Perdiz,
Scallorn, Cliffton, and Alba were found between
0-20 centimeters below the surface (cmbs), points
characteristic of the Transitional Archaic Period
(Darl, Fairland, and Edgewood) were recovered
between 20-40 cmbs, Late Archaic projectile
points (Ensor, Frio, Marshall, and Castroville)
were excavated between 30-50 cmbs, early Late
Archaic points (Pedernales) occurred primarily
between 50-70 cmbs, and Nolan and Early
Stemmed points representing the Middle and
Early Archaic intervals were found between 70­

Shiner’s underwater excavations at 41HY147
and 41HY161 produced abundant evidence of
Archaic and Paleoindian occupations, including
Clovis, but the remains were not found in
sedimentary contexts that could be used to
reconstruct detailed views of these past occupants’
lifeways. Nevertheless, Shiner (1983) proposed
that the Paleoindian inhabitants of 41HY147
probably were semi-sedentary and stayed at the
springs for long periods of time. Shiner (1983)
based his hypothesis on the apparent large number
of Paleoindian projectile points and bones found
in his excavations in contrast to well-known killsites in the Southern Plains with fewer points. In
addition, he suggested that the presence of large
springs with constant water temperatures would
allow “edible ﬂora and fauna [to] be available yearround” and the “green foliage near the temperate
water would attract mega-fauna during the dry
or cold seasons” (Shiner 1983:5-6). Johnson
and Holliday (1983) contested this hypothesis,

excavated six units at 41HY160 in the vicinity
of the Aquarena Center ofﬁces (see Figure 3-2).
Intact deposits were found immediately below
the present surface in two of the units. Neither
the 1991 nor the 1998 excavations have been
analyzed and reported. In 1997, Dawn Ramsey
(1997) conducted a pedestrian survey and shoveltesting project at Aquarena Center. She excavated
10 shovel tests on the east side (left bank) of
Sink Creek and northeast of the entrance road
immediately east of the escarpment. All but one
shovel test produced prehistoric artifacts.

190 cmbs. Faunal remains consisted of bison,
deer, and antelope. The thirteen documented
features included two burned rock middens,
ﬁve stone hearths, three stone alignments, one
posthole, one trash pit, and a special activity
area possibly associated with the production of
ceramics. One stone alignment and an adjacent
posthole might be the remains of a structure.
The ﬁeld school returned to 41HY160 in 1983,
but these excavations have not been analyzed or
reported.
In 1984, 41HY165 was recorded and brieﬂy
tested. Excavations were renewed in 1996 and
continued through 1998. Jennifer Giesecke
(1998), then a BA student at Texas State, analyzed
the faunal remains for a class project. Chris
Ringstaff (2001) presented this material for his
MA Thesis; otherwise the excavations at this site
have remained unanalyzed and have not been
reported.
Texas State ﬁeld school
participants returned to 41HY160
under the direction of David
Driver in 1991. Three units
were excavated in the T-Box 6
area, three in the vicinity of the
swimming pool in front of the
hotel (Figure 3-2), and a seventh
unit was excavated northeast of
the anthropology ﬁeld laboratory
on the edge of the golf course.
Most of the upper deposits near
the swimming pool were believed
to be mixed (James Garber,
personal communication 1999),
but some of the lower deposits
appeared to be intact.

Geoarchaeological Assessment of
Buried Site Potential

In 1997 Ford and Lyle (1998) conducted
a limited shovel testing and backhoe testing
operation at 41HY161, in the parking lot
constructed for Joe’s Crab Shack on the right
bank of Spring Lake and immediately upstream
from the dam. These investigations demonstrated
the presence of extensively disturbed deposits.
In 1998 Lyle et al. (2000) excavated backhoe
trenches, shovel tests, and excavation units along
the route of a water pipeline that went through
41HY161; the entire length of the pipeline
route was monitored during construction.
The route extended from the banks of the San
Marcos River immediately downstream of the
Ice House and Spring Lake Dam, ran adjacent
to the Aquatic Biology Building, and then
continued west. Test units west of the Aquatic
Biology Building documented intact deposits
with eight stratigraphic units. A Late Archaic
(Williams) component in Zone 7 was found
stratiﬁed above a Late Paleoindian (probably
Angostura) component in the lower portion of
Zone 7. Below the Angostura component was a
buried soil in Zone 8. Organic matter from this
soil was submitted for radiocarbon dating and the
resulting estimate of 1060±70 B.P. (Beta-132889,
δ13C= -20.1 ‰) reﬂects a serious contamination
problem with modern organic matter. Dense
subsurface roots from nearby bald cypress trees
are the likely contaminant.

Before excavations were undertaken,
the current geoarchaeological information at
41HY160 was assessed. Although not without
problems, two recent studies (Goelz 1999; TETCO
1999), as well as a 1999 geotechnical analysis of
the construction site (Gunter 1999), were used to
determine the condition of the site as it pertains
to archaeological resources.
In 1999 Prewitt & Associates conducted a
geological assessment of seventeen 30-foot (9­
m) cores (Goelz 1999). The primary result of
this work was to provide an outline of the Late
Quaternary geological history of the valley and
the potential for prehistoric occupations. Goelz
(1999:5-6) identiﬁed two stratigraphic units (I
and II) and four depositional facies (Ig and Il [my
labels], and IIa and IIb).
Goelz (1999) argues that stratigraphic Unit
I unconformably overlies Cretaceous bedrock
(Person Formation of the Edwards Group). This
unit is divided into a thick gravel facies (Ig)
and a thin discontinuous loam facies (Il). The
gravel facies represents deposition by a highenergy ﬂuvial system such as a stream channel
ﬂoor or a point bar. It was present in the lower
portion of Cores 4, 7, 8, 14, and 15 (Figure 3-3),
but unit designations are not clearly marked on
the remainder of the core descriptions. The loam
facies (Il ) was present in only Cores 15 and
19. This facies is an organic-rich, ﬁne-grained
deposit that probably reﬂects the occurrence
of a “backswamp” or marsh environment. A
radiocarbon assay of 11,470±100 B.P. (Beta­
132062, δ13C= -26.7 ‰; calibrated age 13,444

In 1999 Godwin et al. (2000) conducted
test excavations at 41HY306 and data recovery
excavations at a portion of 41HY37. The City of
San Marcos installed a 24-inch water line at the
base of the Balcones Escarpment and along Bert
Brown Road. Diagnostic projectile points from
the Early, Middle, and Late Archaic periods were

Thirty cores were extracted
during this initial geotechnical
and geoarchaeological study;
twenty-one were in the immediate
area of the Texas Rivers Center
Phase 2 construction (see
Figure 3-3), and the remaining
cores were placed further to
the southwest on the peninsula.
Data collected during these two
projects were used to construct
the current site conditions;
however, limitations existed and
these are discussed below.

in Core 15 supports the argument that most of
the alluvial deposits in the valley accumulated
during a temporal span that could potentially
contain cultural materials.
Stratigraphic Unit II consists of two facies.
Unit IIa consists of ﬁne-grained ﬂoodplain
deposits, and Unit IIb represents the accumulation
of coarse-grained, poorly sorted colluvial deposits
simultaneously accumulating at the base of the
escarpment and interﬁngering with the alluvial
deposits of Unit IIa. A buried soil was observed
in Core 3 and Core 9 at approximately 2 m below
the surface. A radiocarbon date from Core 3
(3660±50 B.P., Beta-132061, δ13C= -21.7 ‰;
calibrated age with multiple intercepts of 3979,
3936, 3933 years B.P.) is used to suggest that
this soil formed during a brief period of surface
stability during the Late Archaic period.

The thickness of alluvial
sediments above bedrock are
plotted on Figure 3-4. These
plots show that deposits are
shallow near the escarpment, but
quickly thicken to an average
depth of 8.4 meters in the central
portion of the site. The southeasternmost core (Core 15) is 9.2 meters, and
this may represent an incised channel in the
underlying bedrock. It is possible that deposits
become even thicker toward the middle of the
valley.
Figure 3-5 illustrates the thickness of
disturbed ﬁll below the surface. Only cores
near the swimming pool have deposits that have
signiﬁcant amounts of disturbed ﬁll. Importantly,
the cores immediately south of the swimming
pool have no recorded disturbed ﬁll, and this is
an area where building construction is planned
in Phase 2.
Figure 3-6 shows which cores produced
prehistoric cultural materials and the maximum
depths at which this material was observed. The
recovery of cultural materials in such small cores
is not common and recovery usually indicates

29

reasonably dense occupation. In
the area of the swimming pool,
only one core (Core 4) did not
produce prehistoric artifacts (see
Figure 3-3). Cultural materials
were recovered to a depth of
6.5 meters in core B-19 in the
southern portion of the pecan
grove, and similar depths could
be expected nearer the swimming
pool. As the radiocarbon date of
11,470 B.P. is from a 9.15-m depth
in Core 15, all of the deposits
above this level could potentially
contain evidence of prehistoric
occupations, and the estimated
age for cultural materials at 6.5
m below the surface is 8850 B.P.
Figure 3-7 presents the
depth of ground water. The
most distinctive and expected
pattern is that ground water is
encountered at shallower depths
in cores that are closer to standing
water at the head of Spring Lake.
Ground water depth can be
expected to ﬂuctuate with changes
in rainfall. Garber et al. (1983)
estimate that the water table is 12
feet (3.65 meters) higher because
of Spring Lake. The most serious
problem that ground water poses
is instability of deposits. Hand
excavation below ground water
depths is not safe or logistically
feasible without shoring and
pumping.
Figure 3-8 illustrates the
thickness of intact deposits. The
most complete sections are south
and east of the swimming pool.

While the cores described by
Goelz (1999) provide important
information, there are problems
with them that affect their
usefulness in future investigations.

Corporation (TETCO) originally
extracted their cores in May and
June of 1999 for a geotechnical
study of the construction site,
although three cores were taken
strictly for geoarchaeological
purposes. TETCO removed nine
5-foot cores that did not sample
the lower deposits and twentyone 30-foot cores that reached
bedrock. The cores were extracted
with truck-mounted rotary and
auger drill rigs. Three extraction
strategies were used. First,
cohesive soils (most of the Late
Pleistocene and Holocene alluvial
sediments are within this class)
were continuously sampled with
a hydraulically advanced 3-inch
diameter steel push-tube sampler.
This was implemented until
“refusal.” Secondly, granular soils
were intermittently sampled with a
split spoon sampler. Finally, rock­
like materials were continuously
cored with an NX size double
walled core barrel equipped with a
diamond or carbide cutting bit.

Summary of Site Poten
tial and Limitations
Clearly, 41HY160 has a
remarkable potential to provide
signiﬁcant new information to the
prehistoric record of Texas. Every
excavation unit that has been dug
through undisturbed deposits has
contained evidence of prehistoric
occupations. Another measure of
the site’s potential can be gained
by brieﬂy inspecting sediment
deposition rates. Even though
the data are extremely limited,

the swimming pool will probably not include
preserved Late Prehistoric and Late Archaic
components. These will most likely be present
immediately south of the pool. The distribution
of water table depths shows that most excavations
will be terminated between 2-3 m below the
surface without some type of pumping. This
means that testing the deeper deposits with Early

have a greater chance of being buried quicker and
organic materials being better preserved.

deep alluvial deposits exist throughout the area,
except near the escarpment wall. It is also in this
area where colluvial deposits are most likely. The

R ESEARCH QUESTIONS AND TESTING STRATEGY
C. Britt Bousman and David L. Nickels

Research Questions
Balinsky 1998) suggests that dramatic changes in
prehistoric faunal exploitation occurred during
the same periods of occupation as represented
at 41HY160, and that these changes were related
to major environmental shifts. Giesecke (1998)
tentatively identiﬁes shifts between deer and
bison at 41HY165, but these results must be
conﬁrmed with more detailed analysis. The use
of plant foods can also be expected to change, but
too little is known about what type of plants were
used and how these were processed.

A number of major questions were addressed
by the investigations at the Texas Rivers Center.
However, as the reader may recall from the
introductory chapter (Chapter 1), the purposes
of this project were 1) to determine the presence
or absence of cultural remains in the areas to
be impacted, and 2) if cultural materials were
found, to evaluate their integrity and potential
for
providing
signiﬁcant
archaeological
information.
Because this is a testing project, the issues of
site integrity and preservation potential were the
most important issues considered. Other issues
that can be addressed with further analysis are
related to how humans adapted to natural changes
in the environment, as well as the availability
or of ﬂuctuating food resources. These issues
are not dealt with in this testing report, but our
methodology was designed with them in mind
(see Chapter 5).

Environment
How has the local and regional environment
changed? How have environmental changes
inﬂuenced the exploitation of plants and animals
in the area? Was the resource base stable during
this 12,000-year period or did the prehistoric
inhabitants respond to regional ﬂuctuations
in the plant and animal populations (Dillehay
1974; Bousman 1998)? Were the changes great
enough that prehistoric Native Americans had to
alter their economic, mobility, or technological
exploitation patterns?

Economy
What economic changes occurred during the
prehistoric period? The only nearby site that can
compare to 41HY160 at Spring Lake is WilsonLeonard (41WM235) in southern Williamson
County (Collins 1998). Both sites have evidence
of quasi-continuous occupation from the Early
Paleoindian through the Late Prehistoric periods.
The faunal record at Wilson-Leonard (Baker 1998,

Technology
How have prehistoric technological strategies
responded to changes in economic exploitation
patterns? A shift from formal and curated lithic
tools to a greater use of informal expedient tool
using strategies is evident in the ﬂake tools at
35

spatial analysis of Late Archaic occupations at
41MV120 in Maverick County suggests a highly
repetitive but informal use of space as would be
expected on forager sites (Vierra 1998). Intra-site
analysis of artifact distributions can be used to
shed light on hunter-gatherer mobility patterns.
If additional structures can be identiﬁed,
then their use in detailed intra-site analyses
of hunter-gatherer camps would be extremely
informative, particularly if investigators can gain
an understanding of how site structure relates to
mobility patterns. Does the internal structure of
prehistoric occupations at the springs support the
argument for semi-sedentary occupation?

Wilson-Leonard (Prillman and Bousman 1998).
Are changes in cooking technology a response to
economic changes and availability of foodstuffs
(Wandsnider 1997)? Are similar shifts present
at 41HY160? Did the prehistoric inhabitants
alter their technological strategies to match the
exploitation patterns?

Mobility
How did changes in hunter-gatherer mobility
inﬂuence technological patterns? According to
Shiner (1983), we should expect to encounter
evidence for semi-sedentary settlement patterns,
even in the Paleoindian period. McKinney
(1981) and others have remarked on the intensive
exploitation and occupation of spring related
sites along the Balcones escarpment, but does
this occupation intensity translate to sedentary
mobility patterns? Did shifts in mobility patterns
inﬂuence the use of curated and expedient tools?
How are non-local raw materials incorporated
into the technological system? Are different
resources from differing areas used in speciﬁc
periods?

Site Preservation
This issue has been discussed in detail in the
previous chapter, and in sum, three major questions
related to site preservation are addressed. How has
the nature of sediment accumulation affected the
presence of archaeological evidence at 41HY160?
Did erosion and different facies deposition inhibit
the preservation of archaeological remains in
speciﬁc periods? Could these different patterns
of erosion and deposition account for the cultural
historical record preserved at 41HY160?

Habitation Structures
Two possible structures have been recovered
from the Texas State excavations at 41HY160
and the nearby site of 41HY163 (Garber et al.
1983; Garber 1987). Other investigations in
Texas demonstrate the construction of habitation
structures; four structure types have been
identiﬁed (Lintz et al. 1995). Ethnoarchaeological
investigations of hunter-gatherer sites demonstrate
the unorganized nature of sites occupied by highly
mobile foragers and the more organized nature
of sites occupied by semi-sedentary collectors
(Binford 1986; Fisher and Strickland 1989;
O’Connell 1987; Yellen 1976). Both foragers and
collectors are known to construct habitations, but
artifact distributions differ between these different
hunter-gatherer adaptations. Recent intra-site

Test Excavation Strategy
In order to address the research questions
discussed in the previous section, the test
excavation strategy was divided into two
operations. The ﬁrst was geoarchaeological
coring, and the second was 1-x-1-m unit test
excavations. The primary objective of this second
phase of investigation was to obtain enough
information to determine if a data recovery phase
of investigations was warranted and, if so, how
to best design the second phase of archaeological
work.

vertical distribution of Late Prehistoric and Late
Archaic occupations in these two construction
areas. Older occupations could not be sampled by
test units due to water table depth. Dr. Lee Nordt
acted as the geoarchaeological consultant in order
that the high resolution alluvial and colluvial
stratigraphy obtained from the cores and these
excavation units could be linked directly to the
excavated samples. During the 1991 Texas State
ﬁeld school, a 1-x-1-m unit was excavated in the
area of the swimming pool. This information was
used to supplement the six planned units.

Geoarchaeological Coring
New geoarchaeological cores are needed in
order to better understand the geological history
of the valley. The previous cores extracted by
TETCO and described by Goelz (1999) were
not retained and could not be examined, making
further interpretations impossible. Furthermore,
core recovery was too incomplete (see Chapter
3), and this led to a serious concern regarding the
accurate interpretation of the geological context
of the prehistoric occupations in the valley.
Additional coring was conducted by the
Bureau of Economic Geology (UT-Austin) in
order to document the Late Pleistocene and
Holocene depositional history of the valley,
including the exact depth of disturbed deposits
in the swimming pool area. This produced
another set of cores that were extracted in two
valley cross-sections from east to west, but with
a concentration in the swimming pool area where
most of the Phase 2 construction will occur. One
problem with the previous coring effort is that
they were taken in a longitudinal pattern rather
than on a cross-section, making reconstructing
alluvial ﬁll very difﬁcult. Serious questions
persisted concerning the depth of disturbed
ﬁll in the Phase 2 construction area, and these
questions were to be answered as the ﬁrst step in
the archaeological investigations.

A number of special samples were collected
from the test excavations, including radiocarbon,
archaeomagnetic samples of burned rock
from features, and macrobotanical samples.
Archaeomagnetic burned rock samples provide
information on the context of burned rock cooking
features and the use parameters (temperature
and heating interval) of these features. Macrobotanical samples offer information on past
environments, as well as prehistoric plant use.
Furthermore, Accelerated Mass Spectrometry
(AMS) radiocarbon dating was used because
AMS provides a much more precise and accurate
assay, which is important for deposits of such
great age. AMS also has the capability to date
materials that are very small (charcoal) or contain
very little contemporaneous carbon (bone). Recent
dating efforts on similar sites have relied almost
exclusively on AMS dating. Sediment textural
analysis could be used to accurately assess the
character of sediments and thus depositional
environments. This information would be critical
for a detailed understanding of the integrity of
the archaeological remains. These would all
be considered as feasibility tests, and the most
productive could be used in the mitigation (data
recovery) phase of investigations.

Test Excavations
Six 1-x-1-m test units were excavated to an
average depth of 1.7 m before reaching the water
table. Two units were placed in the footprint of
the pavilion and the restrooms (Phase 1 Master
Plan), and four units were placed in the area of
the swimming pool and surrounding parking lot.
These last four units were placed in areas where the
geoarchaeological cores indicate that undisturbed
deposits have survived. The primary purpose of
these units was to determine the horizontal and

were made for special analysis to the taxa level.
It was expected that numerous burned rock
features would be encountered. Radiocarbon and
archaeobotanical samples were taken from these
features. Furthermore, archaeomagnetic cores
were collected and analyzed at Dr. Wulf Gose’s
Paleomagnetic Laboratory at the University
of Texas at Austin. Archaeomagnetic analysis
provides a reliable technique to determine the
context of burned rock features and many of
the use-parameters of these features, such as
maximum heating temperature, reuse of burned
rock, possible stone boiling, and approximate
heating time. This information could be critical
in the analysis of prehistoric subsistence and
cooking strategies (Wandsnider 1997).

photographs, and elevation records. All excavated
sediment was screened through ¼-inch mesh,
and all artifacts, bone, and any other signiﬁcant
materials were collected.

Analysis of Artifacts and Features
The artifacts analysis was designed to provide
information regarding the various research
questions discussed in the previous section.
The vast majority of materials to be analyzed
were lithic artifacts. These were classiﬁed by
class (tool, ﬂake or core) and by raw material.
More detailed analysis consists of ﬁne-grained
classiﬁcations into various tool types, e.g.,
projectile points. Other observations related to
manufacturing strategies, intensity of use, and
reuse could also be made (Bousman 1993). Faunal

Introduction

Mapping
A site datum was established in an area not
projected to be disturbed by new construction,
and was tied into a permanent benchmark using a
Sokkia Total Station with a data collector. All test
units and core boreholes were mapped using the
Total Station, thus allowing for greater accuracy
and speed in mapping (Figure 5-1). Mapping
data were downloaded from the data collector to
a database spreadsheet loaded onto a computer
hard drive in the CAS laboratory. The data was
checked for accuracy and maps were produced
using Surfer and ArcView software.

This chapter provides a discussion of the
ﬁeld and laboratory methods used during the
2001 excavations, as well as subsequent analysis
and curation of the cultural material recovered.
The methods employed throughout the project
were a direct result of those research questions
and testing strategies discussed in the previous
chapter. In total, six hand-dug 1-x-1-m units were
excavated, and 22 geologic cores were extracted
to investigate and evaluate 41HY160 during this
project.

Field Methodology
During a four-week period
beginning January 5, 2001, CAS
conducted a Phase I testing project
at 41HY160. Preﬁeld operations
included a thorough review of
the data from previous testing
projects at 41HY160. In addition
to 1-x-1-m unit excavations, ﬁeld
investigations conducted by
CAS included site mapping, the
collection of macrobotanical,
archaeomagnetic, and magnetic
susceptibility samples, and
geomorphological studies.

Figure 5-1. Excavation units and bore holes were mapped using a Sok­
kia total data station.

Unit Excavations
Six units, assigned numerical
designations 1–6, were excavated
during the current testing project.
All were 1-x-1-m, placed within
the footprint, or immediate area
of proposed new construction,
and dug in 10-cm arbitrary
levels using trowels. With the
exception of special samples, all
excavated material was screened
through ¼-inch mesh. Initially,
when work began on the ﬁfth of
January, all sediments were dryscreened. However, because of
the wet, sticky clay, this method
did not prove to be either time
or cost effective. Therefore, on
the twenty-third of January, all
sediments were placed in 5­
gallon bucket mixtures of water
and baking soda. After stirring
and allowing the combination
to set for 30 minutes or longer,
the sediments were then water
screened (Figure 5-2).

Figure 5-2. Water screening at the Anthropology Field Laboratory.

Each unit was identiﬁed by
the provenience of its southwest corner. Normally,
two crew members were assigned to each unit.
Unit datums were established at ground surface in
the southwest corner of the unit. Feature numbers
were assigned when identiﬁed, plan views were
drawn, and photographs were taken. Twenty-one
ﬂotation samples were collected from 10 different
features for further analysis. Additional samples
were collected in and around features, or from
soils that appeared to be organically enriched by
human occupation.

Archaeomagnetic Samples
CAS drilled and collected 125 core samples
for archaeomagnetic analysis from nine burned
and ﬁre-cracked rock features. Rocks from these
features were drilled in place using an Echo E­
Z Core rock drill, model D-2801, with a 1 1/8­
inch diamond-tipped bit (Figure 5-3). The angle
and dip were recorded using a Brunton compass
mounted on a goniometer (Figure 5-4). The
elevation of each sample relative to the unit
datum was also recorded. A plan view was drawn
of the drilled rocks with the archaeomagnetic
sample number assigned. After each sample was
scored and marked with a permanent marker to

Lithic Artifacts

The processing of lithic
artifacts began with washing and
sorting into debitage and tool
categories during a preliminary
analysis. A more complete form
of analysis was made on all whole
ﬂakes recovered. This consisted
of the identiﬁcation of a ﬂake type
(e.g., core preparation, biface
thinning, uniface, sequence).
Individual tool categories were
further analyzed by speciﬁc
attributes designed for each tool
type. Data were then entered on
an Excel Spreadsheet. Chapter
10 presents further discussion
of how lithic artifacts were
analyzed for this project.

Curation
Artifacts processed in the CAS laboratory
were washed, air-dried, and stored in archivalquality bags. Acid-free labels were placed in
all artifact bags. Each bag was labeled with
a provenience or corresponding lot number.
Tools from all excavations were labeled with
permanent ink and covered by a clear coat of
acrylic. Artifacts from each investigation were
separated by class and stored in acid-free boxes.
Boxes were labeled with standard labels. Firecracked rock was discarded after analysis. Heavy
fraction, light fraction, and other samples (i.e.
14
C, archaeomagnetic samples) were also placed
in acid-free boxes.

Fire-cracked Rock
All ﬁre-cracked rocks were collected for
analysis. A total of 2,650 rocks from 12 features
and other contexts were counted, size-sorted
or weighed, and examined for material type
(limestone, sandstone, quartz, etc.).

Carbon Dating
CAS collected 38 carbon samples. Ultimately,
four wood charcoal samples were selected for
radiocarbon analysis by Thomas Stafford. The
selected samples were processed at the Stafford
Research Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado. For

GEOLOGY, LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION,
AND GEOARCHAEOLOGY AT SPRING LAKE
Lee C. Nordt

Introduction
San Marcos Springs in San Marcos, Texas
is an area rich in archaeological history. Six
prehistoric sites with components ranging in age
from the Paleoindian to Historic periods have
been recorded in the Sink Creek valley, but none
tested to depths of more than 2 to 3 m (Garber
et al. 1983; Arnn and Kibler 1999; Lyle et al.
2000). The Paleoindian artifacts discovered at
the bottom of Spring Lake greatly contribute to
the archaeological importance to the area (Shiner
1983).

the importance of the Sink Creek valley as a
reservoir for preserving a long-term prehistoric
archaeological record of central Texas.

Two previous studies with a geoarchaeological
focus have been conducted. Arnn and Kibler
(1999) excavated backhoe trenches across the
Sink Creek ﬂoodplain and along the northern
valley escarpment. No datable, or time-diagnostic
materials, were discovered in the ﬂoodplain
down to depths of 3 m. However, along the
valley escarpment radiocarbon ages from buried
features indicated the presence of at least 2 m
of Late Holocene colluvium. Goeltz (1999), in
association with the Trinity Engineering Testing
Corporation (TETCO), excavated cores in the
immediate vicinity of the springs at Spring Lake.
Two bulk humate radiocarbon ages were obtained.
The oldest dated to Clovis time (11,470±100
B.P., Beta 132062), which came from the base
of the alluvial valley ﬁll at a depth of 8.6 m. A
bulk humate date of 3660±50 B.P. (Beta 132061)
was obtained from a depth of 2.4 m. Although
these ages are only estimates, they demonstrate

Methods

The purpose of this study is to investigate for
the ﬁrst time the complete alluvial stratigraphy
of the Sink Creek valley in the vicinity of the
San Marcos Springs. Results can be used to
assess prehistoric site distribution, preservation
potentials, and perhaps subsistence strategies and
settlement patterns.

Stratigraphic data were collected from
22 cores taken with a truck-mounted drill rig
provided by the Bureau of Economic Geology
at The University of Texas, Austin. Undisturbed
core samples were taken in 5-foot sections, and
down to bedrock in most cases. With cores that
suffered compaction or sample loss, thickness
and depth adjustments were made. Core sections
were transported to the Department of Geology
Stratigraphy Laboratory at Baylor University
and described following procedures of the Soil
Survey Division Staff (1993). All cores and
depths are graphically illustrated relative to Core
A, the top of which was set at 0 meters elevation.
Archaeological test units (TU) were described
in the ﬁeld. Radiocarbon dating for this project
was performed by Stafford Research and Center

Setting
Geology
The study area is located within the Balcones
Fault Zone Physiographic Province bounded
by the Edwards Plateau to the north and the
Gulf Coastal Plain to the south (Vauter and
Yelderman 1993). As shown in Figure 6-1, the
local Cretaceous geological sequence includes
limestones, shales, and clays from the Navarro/
Taylor Group (youngest), Austin Formation, Eagle
Ford Group, Buda Formation, Del Rio Formation,
Georgetown Formation, Edwards Group (Person
and Kainer Formations), Walnut Formation, and
Glen Rose Formation (oldest). The Edwards
Aquifer formed in fractured and displaced blocks
of the Edwards Group, Georgetown and Walnut
Formations, with the Del Rio Clay and Glen Rose
Limestone serving as upper and lower conﬁning
beds. The steep escarpment northwest of Spring

The San Marcos Springs are the second largest
along the Balcones Escarpment (Guyton and
Associates, 1979). They issue from the Edwards
Aquifer, which regionally ﬂows in the subsurface
from northwest to southeast (see Figure 6-1).
Formation of the Balcones Escarpment began in
the Miocene as soft coastal plain rocks subsided,
creating a regional fault zone trending from the
west to east in the study area. With subsequent
dissolution, widening, and connecting of ﬁssures,
the Edwards Aquifer began to form (Vauter and
Yelderman 1993).

Most spring water emanates
from ﬁve major limestone
openings in the bottom of Spring
Lake (Guyton and Associates
1979). Spring Lake was created
in 1849 when a dam was
constructed by Edward Burleson
300-m downstream from the
main springs (Bousman and
Nickels 2003). Before the dam
was constructed, the spring
bubbled out of a channel some
40 yards wide and 15 to 20 feet
deep (McClintock 1930). Today,
it is known that the springs are
up to 12.2 m deep with 3.1 m of

a late Pleistocene to early Holocene age (Denton,
Krum, Lewisville, Rumple, and Anhalt series).
Rock outcrops within the complex are mapped
as Comfort, Tarpley, and Medlin series. This
geomorphic surface is conﬁned to the area above
the major valley constriction north of the study
area in the Spring Creek valley. The Pleistocene
alluvium forms terraces situated from 3 to 12 m
above the surface elevation of Spring Lake (175
m). The terraces contain deep soils of the Houston
Black, Krum, and Lewisville series (Batte 1984).
These soils formed in what was a large alluvial
valley at the regional conﬂuence of Sink Creek,
and the San Marcos and Blanco Rivers. The
degree of soil development is indicative of at

that contributed by Spring Lake dam. Average
daily spring ﬂow between 1956 and 1974 was
4.56 m3 s-1 with an average lake surface elevation
of 175 m (Guyton and Associates 1979).

Geomorphology
Sink Creek is a low order tributary ﬂowing
into the head of the San Marcos River, which
begins at the San Marcos Springs (Figure 6-2).
Sink Creek begins in the uplands of the Edwards
Plateau north of the study area. Just northeast
of the study area the creek takes a sharp turn
through a valley constriction before entering
Spring Lake. This angle may be created in part
where the creek encounters the
southwest projecting San Marcos
Springs Fault. Today, Sink Creek
ﬂows only during heavy rainfall
events. The San Marcos River
ﬂows for about 8.5 km before
joining the Blanco River. Base
ﬂow from the springs is the main
water source for the San Marcos
River.

Sink Creek

The landscape surrounding
the study area is subdivided
into ﬁve geomorphic units:
Upland Limestone Bedrock,
Pleistocene/Upland
complex,
Pleistocene alluvium, Early
Holocene alluvium, and Late
Holocene alluvium (see Figure
6-2). The Upland Bedrock Unit
is underlain by Cretaceous
limestone, marl, and chalk and
it is mantled by thin rocky soils.
The Pleistocene/Upland complex
consists mainly of a veneer (1 to
2 m) of gravelly alluvium with
subsoil carbonate (Bk) and clay
(Bt) development consistent with

D). Unit A is 2 to 2.5 m thick and consists of
channel gravels deposited directly on the eroded
bedrock ﬂoor of the Sink Creek valley. A veneer
of yellowish brown to brownish yellow overbank
deposits appear to cap the channel gravels in
some areas. The gravels are also contained in a
yellowish brown to brownish yellow mud matrix.
In Core A, a brownish yellow to light yellowish
brown colluvial wedge, containing clays and
matrix supported limestone pebbles and cobbles,
emanates from the northwest valley wall and
interﬁngers with Unit A gravels in Core B (Figure
6-4). In two locations the gravels are capped by
dark gray to black marsh deposits emanating
from the springhead (Figure 6-7, Cores E and
D). In Core E the marsh is subdivided into two
horizons between depths of 666 and 706 cm. The
upper layer is a very dark gray clay to clay-loam
that is weakly calcareous with a lower layer that
is black, calcareous, and with many more snail
fragments. Both layers have well-preserved, ﬁne
to medium plant fragments. In Core D, the marsh
consists of ﬁve layers between depths of 712 and
851 cm. The upper three layers are noncalcareous
clay to clay-loams ranging from dark gray and
gray in the upper two layers to black in the third
layer. The lower two layers are calcareous (many
snail fragments), very dark gray to dark gray
silty clay-loams. Plant fragments occur mainly in
the third and fourth layers. Iron depletions along
channel voids indicate that roots were anchored
in layers 2 and 3 during marsh development. Two
radiocarbon ages indicate marsh accumulation at
9585±40 B.P. based on dating of plant fragments
(Table 6-1), and to as old as 11,470±100 based
on bulk humate dating (Goeltz 1999). Sediment
humates tend to date older than charcoal in
central Texas alluvium (Nordt 1992), thus the
marsh deposits in Cores E and D are tentatively
grouped together.

least a Late Pleistocene age. Cores J and K from
this study were excavated in the parking lot of the
Texas State football stadium and both revealed
truncated soils with numerous carbonate nodules
indicative of a Pleistocene age. This area marks
the Pleistocene/Holocene boundary on the
southeast side of the Sink Creek valley.
The Holocene alluvium is subdivided into
early and late (see Figure 6-2). The Early Holocene
alluvium ﬁlls the broad Sink Creek and San
Marcos River valleys just above the conﬂuence
with the Blanco River. In the study area, the Early
Holocene terrace surface is about 2.5 m above the
surface elevation of Spring Lake. The upstream
section of this unit, including the Sink Creek
valley, consists of ﬁne-grained soils of the Tinn
series, whereas the downstream section along the
San Marcos valley consists of loamy soils of the
Oakalla series. The Late Holocene alluvium is
conﬁned to the entrenched and modern ﬂoodplain
of Sink Creek and the San Marcos River. Here,
frequently ﬂooded and weakly developed Oakalla
soils are mapped. In the study area, Spring Lake
marks the approximate elevation of the ﬂoodplain
surface.

Stratigraphy
The alluvial stratigraphy of the Sink Creek
valley is divided into ﬁve unconformably bound

through 6-7). After this time, deposition slowed
as a cumulic A horizon began to form at the Unit
D terrace surface. Although deposition across the
Unit D surface may have continued after 3300
B.P., the rates were undoubtedly slow in that
the surface horizons are nearly decalciﬁed from
landscape stability and pedogenesis. As noted in
Core A, colluviation was still ongoing during this
time (Figure 6-4).

(Figure 6-5), and based on radiocarbon dating of
charcoal from cultural features near the surface,
it continued until at least 3300 B.P. (Figures 6-6
and 6-7; Table 6-1). Although the littoral zone of
the spring may have contracted after 5900 B.P.,
the water table level was still sufﬁciently high

Unit E occurs in two areas in the Sink Creek
valley. Near the springhead in Cores F, M, N, O,
K2, and L, surface horizons are calcareous and
with less subsoil carbonate accumulation than
in Unit D (Figures 6-5 through 6-7). It appears
that Unit E in this area records deposition after
formation of the Unit D surface soil, but the
origin of the sediment is uncertain. It may be
that the springhead area began to backﬁll with
ﬁne-grained slackwater sediments penetrating
into the area from the Blanco River/San Marcos
River conﬂuence. Perhaps Late Holocene
ﬂood sediments from Sink Creek tended to
preferentially collect around the spring area
where the water table was nearer to the surface.
Signiﬁcant sedimentation, however, did not
occur on the Unit D terrace surface during
Unit E times. Unit E also ﬁlls a small channel
in Core B and the narrowly conﬁned, modern
Sink Creek ﬂoodplain (Figure 6-4). Along Sink
Creek in Core H, Unit E consists of a black to
dark gray, calcareous and clayey surface horizon
over a weakly developed brown and clayey
Bw subsoil (Figure 6-4). At 303 cm, an abrupt

contact separates Unit E from the underlying,
truncated Unit D. In Core B, Unit E consists of
an overthickened and black, calcareous, clay to
clay-loam surface horizon grading down into a
weakly developed Bk horizon with redoximorphic
features indicative of poor drainage (Figure 6-4).
At the base of the Unit E ﬁll, a dark gray zone
modiﬁed by prehistoric activity occurs. Here,
Unit E also abruptly overlies Unit D.

Landscape Evolution
Regional work indicates that widespread
channel entrenchment occurred sometime
between 15,000 and 11,000 B.P. along central
Texas streams (Blum and Valastro, 1989; Nordt,
1992). This is consistent with data from the San
Marcos Springs because channel entrenchment
must have occurred prior to 11,450 B.P. when Unit
A marsh deposits began accumulating. Unit A was
a bedload stream depositing a veneer of channel
gravels across an eroded bedrock ﬂoor. The
littoral zone from the springhead was expanding
across the ﬂoodplain no later than 9585 B.P. as
56

have occurred in response to elevated water tables
and channel discharge. In fact, marsh deposits
in Unit C reached the highest level during the
Late Quaternary at some 1.5 to 2 m above those
in Unit B. As with Unit A, multiple episodes of
channel gravel capping marsh deposits occurred
in Unit C, and persisted up until around 5900
B.P. Based on the location of Unit B in the cores,
the associated channel deposits may have been
more sinuous than during previous depositional
episodes. The strong brown matrix mud may
indicate an inﬂux of eroded, oxidized upland
soils from the surrounding drainage basin. The
ﬂoodplain appears to have widened somewhat at
this time and expanded further eastward toward
the modern Sink Creek channel.

the water table was adjusting to the newly created
base level from channel entrenchment. The marsh
deposits in Unit A undoubtedly accumulated in
shallow water of the littoral zone given the dark
sediment colors and preservation of numerous
plant fragments. The mineral textures of the
deposits demonstrate that ﬂooding from Sink
Creek never terminated during marsh formation,
but only slowed. Marsh deposits were largely
noncalcareous at this time indicating somewhat
acidic anaerobic conditions in the ﬂoodplain
away from the springhead. One of two scenarios
can explain the widespread occurrence of Unit
A marsh deposits. First, the littoral zone of the
spring spread out over a large, low lying area of
the Sink Creek ﬂoodplain. The second possibility
is that the marsh deposits accumulated in channel
swales or cut-offs during an extended period of
slow deposition. However, given the paucity of
ﬁne-grained overbank deposits, it seems unlikely
that the channel network was sinuous at this
time.

Profound ﬂuvial geomorphic changes
began shortly after 5900 B.P. in the Sink Creek
valley. Fine-grained ﬂood deposition began
to overwhelm the littoral zone adjacent to the
springhead, burying former spring deposits
that never again appeared. There is no reason to
believe that the spring ever went dry, but rather,
after 5900 B.P. the littoral zone disappeared in
response to rapid sediment inﬂux from Sink
Creek or from slackwater deposition emanating
from the conﬂuence of the San Marcos and Blanco
River valleys some 8 to 9-km downstream. Given
that the surface elevation of Core F is about 1.5
m below the adjacent Early Holocene terrace,
the springhead was apparently carrying ﬂood
sediment out of its waters and down the San
Marcos River after each ﬂood event. Based on
core data, there are no channel gravels associated
with Unit D. If the lower gravels associated with
Units A, B, and C were facies to Unit D, then
buried paleosols would be present in ﬂoodplain
alluvium associated in time with each of the
marsh deposits. Perhaps climate conditions were
becoming warmer or drier, creating erosion of
oxidized Pleistocene soils from the uplands. It is
possible that the valley was overwhelmed with

Between 9585 and 7365 B.P., an episode
of channel entrenchment terminated marsh
formation associated with Unit A. The spring and
associated water table dropped by about 0.5 to
1 m, which may have been the cause of channel
erosion. Channel B is of limited lateral extent and
conﬁned to the northwest part of the Sink Creek
valley near the springhead. Deposition slowed,
and marsh development began, by 7365 B.P. The
Unit B marsh deposits also contain similar colors,
textures, and preservation of plant fragments as
in Unit A. However, Unit B contains a single thick
marsh deposit, and Unit A has multiple episodes
of marsh formation suggestive of more ﬂoodplain
or spring instability.
Renewed channel aggradation occurred
shortly after 7365 B.P., as the Unit B marsh
deposits became buried by channel and overbank
deposits of Unit C. Renewed aggradation may

and 9500 B.P. These sediments have the potential
to preserve Paleoindian features, including Clovis.
This is consistent with discoveries of Clovis
artifacts in Spring Lake (Shiner, 1983) and Early
Archaic points at depths of only several meters
in some parts of Unit D alluvium of Sink Creek
(Garber 1983; see also this report). During initial
deposition of Unit A, the valley was ﬁlled with
a veneer of gravelly alluvium deposited from a
bedload stream. Fluvial ﬂooding then slowed as
the littoral zone of the springhead expanded out
into the ﬂoodplain, covering the channel gravels
with organic rich marsh deposits. Although in
a secondary context, a ﬂake discovered in the
channel gravels in Core E demonstrates cultural
activity in the area prior to 9585 B.P. It seems
unlikely that Paleoindians would have occupied
the littoral zone now represented by the marsh
deposits capping the Unit A gravels. However,
environments immediately adjacent to these
sediments in the ﬂoodplain, or perhaps on the
nearby Pleistocene terraces or uplands, would
have certainly been attractive occupation sites.

ﬁne-grained sediments deposited as a series of
hyperconcentrated ﬂows or from a ﬁne-grained
anastomozing stream network. Slackwater from
the large ﬂoodplain just downstream near the
Blanco and San Marcos Rivers may have also
contributed to ﬁne grained deposition up valley.
Deposition of Unit D continued until at least 3300
B.P. Deposition slowed markedly afterward as
evidenced by a nearly decalciﬁed, cumulic, dark
A horizon at the surface of the Early Holocene
Unit D terrace.
The Sink Creek channel down cut and began
creating the narrow, modern ﬂoodplain sometime
after 3300 B.P. This event may have reduced
depositional rates across the broader Unit D Early
Holocene ﬂoodplain. As with Unit D, no channel
gravels occur within the modern ﬂoodplain. It is
also possible that the Unit D channel was in the
location of the modern Sink Creek channel and
simply ﬁlled in slowly during the Late Holocene
as depositional rates slowed. Regardless, ﬂood
deposition in the Late Holocene was conﬁned
mainly to the Sink Creek ﬂoodplain, around the
springhead, and up a small channel headward
from the spring (Core B). Late Holocene alluvium
is also conﬁned to a narrow, frequently ﬂooded
meanderbelt downstream along the San Marcos
River. Late Holocene colluviation continued in
the study area where Late Archaic features were
dated in colluvium a short distance upstream
from the project area (Arnn and Kibler, 1999).
Evidence of colluviation at this time in the
vicinity of Core A was probably removed during
construction of the Aquarena Springs resort.

The Sink Creek ﬂoodplain became unstable
shortly after 9500 B.P. as the channel down cut
near the springhead prior to depositing Unit B (see
Figure 6-8). The channel gravels at this time were
apparently conﬁned to the west side of the valley.
The ﬂoodplain then stabilized no later than 7400
B.P. as the littoral zone of the springhead again
expanded out on to the ﬂoodplain, although not as
much as during deposition of the Unit A marsh.
Late Paleoindian and Early Archaic artifacts may
be buried within Unit B. Contextual integrity
would be highest within the marsh zone, but as
discussed previously, occupation may have been
preferentially adjacent to the ﬂoodplain or on
terraces or uplands.

Geoarchaeology
Alluvial, colluvial, and spring sediments
dating to the past 11,500 years are contained
within the Sink Creek valley in the study area
(Figure 6-8). With current dating, Unit A is
temporally bracketed in time to between 11,500

and 5900 B.P., the Sink Creek valley began

stream (see Figure 6-8). Although channel
activity was still conﬁned to the western part
of the valley, the ﬂoodplain widened somewhat.
Only Early Archaic artifacts should be buried in
Unit C. The highest potential for preservation in
primary contexts would be in the thick marsh
deposits of the expanding littoral zone or in the
veneer of overbank clays adjacent to the marsh
deposits.

The Sink Creek Channel migrated towards its
modern position in the center of the valley after
3300 B.P. Deposition was probably preceded by
an episode of down cutting as the former Unit D
ﬂoodplain was abandoned and transformed into a
terrace. Unit E near Core B apparently represents
a side channel ﬂowing towards the springhead
from the trunk stream, and perhaps partially
ﬁlled with slackwater deposits emanating up
valley from the San Marcos River. A veneer of
Late Holocene sediment covers only parts of
the Unit D ﬂoodplain surface. Artifacts dating
from the Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric may
be preserved in discrete occupation zones in
Unit E, but forming a palimpsest of occupation
zones on the surface of the Early Holocene Unit
D terrace.

Rapid valley ﬁlling began shortly after 5900
B.P. along Sink Creek creating Unit D. Finegrained deposition continued until at least 3300
B.P., after which ﬂooding and sedimentation
began to slow, forming a thick cumulic surface
soil. This depositional event created the bulk of
the broad constructional Early Holocene terrace
now bordering both sides of the modern Sink
Creek channel. The channel at this time was
an anastomozing, suspended load stream, with
slackwater probably backing into the valley from
the Blanco River/San Marcos River conﬂuence.
Even though deposition was from a suspended
load stream, deposition was nevertheless rapid
enough to prevent signiﬁcant periods of landscape
stability and paleosol formation. Early Archaic

Archaic features is high because of the presence
of thick, rapidly deposited overbank sediments.
Middle and Late Archaic, and Late Prehistoric
features will be preserved in discrete primary
contexts in the modern Sink Creek ﬂoodplain or
in an abandoned channel near the springhead, or
compressed as a palimpsest near the surface of
the Unit D terrace.

The majority of sediments in the Sink Creek
valley date to Paleoindian and Early Archaic
times, with depths of preservation ranging from
over 6 meters for the former and from several
to 6 meters for the latter. Contextual integrity
is moderate for Paleoindian and Early Archaic
features because of the presence of a bedload
stream and associated marsh deposits, whereas

STRATIGRAPHY, CHRONOLOGY, AND
SITE FORMATION PROCESSES
David L Nickels

Introduction
This chapter provides the results of the
current investigations. It presents the ﬁndings of
geomorphological studies in the upper 1.7 m of the
site, as well as a review of the vertical distribution
of artifacts. Only the six units excavated during
this project are discussed here; for a discussion of
the geomorphological investigation of the entire
site, which includes the nearly seven meters of
deposits lying below the depth of the six excavated
units, see Chapter 6.
In examining the vertical
distribution of artifacts and soil

Units 1, 2, and 3 were excavated
through intrusive pavement

be discussed only brieﬂy in this

itself has not been disturbed or displaced.” (Villa
1982:278).

General Discussion
Villa (1982:277) points out that both Old
World and New World archaeologists routinely
observe clear breaks in sedimentary stratigraphy
with associated cultural material, and accept
these separations as isolatable components. As
such, these discrete assemblages are suitable
for constructing relative cultural chronologies.
However, she argues that stratigraphic
disturbances and the resulting movement of
artifacts are not always obvious and detectable
by even the most trained eye in the ﬁeld. She
cites “living ﬂoor” studies, which presume that
layers that appear to be undisturbed “would
yield discrete assemblages” but were sometimes
criticized as being too coarse-grained (Villa
1982:277). Even thin ﬂoors may represent a
palimpsest of occupations, and “considerable
vertical displacement of artifacts (both upward
and downward) may occur even when the matrix

Wood and Johnson (1978) note that sediments
are not static mediums, and identify natural postdepositional processes affecting the vertical
distribution of artifacts include frost heave, dry
soil creep, soliﬂuction (saturated soil creep), and
subsidence (sinking) in cave deposits. Although
in some cases these processes are easily
identiﬁable in the ﬁeld, in many other cases they
are not. Another post-depositional disturbance
often overlooked is biogenic perturbation,
e.g., termites, earthworms, and other animal
burrowing. Human post-depositional inﬂuences
on artifacts may include trampling, tool reuse, the
digging of postholes, storage pits, baking pits, or
burial graves, and the borrowing of sediments for
sealing cooking ovens or ceramic manufacture.
Yellen (1977:103), Gifford and Behrensmeyer
(1977), and Stockton (1973) argue that trampling
64

causing the clayey soils to expand and shrink.
“When expansion occurs, an artifact is lifted
slightly from its original position, leaving a small
void or cavity under the artifact. As the soil dries,
the matrix around the artifact shrinks. Because
the cavity under the artifact also shrinks, the
artifact cannot fall back into its original position,
and ﬁne-grained particles ﬁll the void” (Waters
1992:299-300).

will cause the smaller artifacts to move downward,
while generally leaving the larger artifacts on
or very near their original surface. Periodic
wetting and drying of soils due to percolating
rainwater, and an oscillating water table will also
cause artifacts to move downward (Cahen and
Moeyersons 1977).
Unlike trampling, which causes artifacts
to move downward, cryoturbation and
argilliturbation cause artifacts to move upward.
Cryoturbation results in the upward movement of
larger artifacts, caused by freeze and thaw cycles.
The San Marcos area is little affected by these
cycles because of its temperate climate, although
occasional freezes of short duration do occur.
However, “the depth and rate of freezing are
maximized in areas where (1) annual temperatures
are below freezing for long periods, (2) the matrix
is composed of ﬁne-grained particles such as silt,
and (3) abundant moisture is present in the soil to
enhance ice lens formations” (Waters 1992:294).
Basically, because of their thermal properties,
stone artifacts freeze slower than the surrounding
soil. When the soil around an artifact freezes, the
ground heaves upward, carrying the artifact with
it. As the artifact is lifted by the frozen soil, it
leaves a cavity underneath it. Thus, immediately
beneath the “warmer” stone artifact, the frost
line dips into the cavity, ﬁlling it with an ice lens.
As the soil and ice begin to thaw, the underlying
cavity is partially ﬁlled with looser subsurface
soil, thus not allowing the artifact to drop
back into its original vertical position (Waters
1992:292-299).

Soil types and textures certainly are a
variable in that vertical movement of artifacts
can occur, and Stockton (1973, 1977) argues that
the phenomena can occur in all types of deposits,
whether mostly sand, or a mixture of sand, silt,
and clay. Experimental studies have demonstrated
that 94 percent of artifacts recovered in loamy
soils were vertically within 1 cm of their original
placement after trampling, and the looser matrix
caused by trampling “caught and held small- to
medium-sized ﬂakes” (Gifford-Gonzalez et al.
1985:808). Conversely, in sandy soils the majority
of artifacts easily worked their way downward,
at least until they encountered a moist layer of
sand.
Regardless of soil conditions, Villa (1982:287­
287) cautions against “over interpreting stratiﬁed
sequences” without analyzing conjoinable pieces
of stone, bone, and pottery relative to the total
assemblage. Although we agree with Villa (1982)
that the best method to evaluate the vertical
movement of artifacts is by reﬁtting or conjoining
artifacts, using ﬂake weights and lengths have
also been demonstrated as effective alternative
means of evaluating vertical displacement. Yellen
(1977:103), Gifford and Behrensmeyer (1977), and
Stockton (1973) argue that trampling will cause
the smaller artifacts to move downward, while
generally leaving the larger artifacts on or very
near their original surface. Gifford-Gonzalez et
al. (1985) concluded from their experiments and
those of Villa and Courtin (1983) that length,

Argilliturbation occurs when the wetting and
drying of surﬁcial layers of clays, called vertisols
(Soil Survey Staff 1975), push artifacts toward
the surface. Even before the Burleson Dam was
constructed in 1849, the immediate area around
San Marcos Springs was most certainly subjected
to repeated episodes of wetting and drying,
65

weight, and volume are interrelated variables
that affect the downward displacement of ﬂakes
caused by trampling, and thus statistically
can be used interchangeably to evaluate their
stratigraphic integrity.

920 (21.2 %) smaller ﬂakes may have moved
upward as much as 10 cm, while 56 smaller ﬂakes
(1.3 %) may have moved downward as much as
10 cm; the downward movement most likely was
due to vertical cracking.

In sum, these and other studies implicate
that the integrity of occupation zones can be
methodically tested by examining the vertical
distribution of artifacts. There will be exceptions:
animal burrowing, subsequent cracking in
clayey soils, and some human intervention (e.g.,
borrowing and digging) may displace larger
artifacts to lower levels and conversely, smaller
artifacts upward; however, an overall mean size
(or weight) should exhibit patterning by levels.
Although we agree with Villa (1982) that the
best method to evaluate the vertical movement
of artifacts is by reﬁtting or conjoining artifacts,
reﬁtting is very time consuming and not feasible
in most contract situations. Flake weights and
lengths can be used as an effective alternative
means of evaluating vertical displacement.

Site Speciﬁc Discussion
We begin by brieﬂy describing the excavations
in Units 1, 2, and 3. These three units were
excavated through construction ﬁll to the depth of
the water table; no intact sediments or soils were
found. However, Units 4, 5, and 6 all contained
intact soil horizons and cultural deposits. Thus,
with the data from these three units we are able
to provide beneﬁcial archaeological results and
inferences.

Unit Excavations in Fully Disturbed De
posits (Units 1, 2, 3)
Unit 1 was placed west of the swimming pool
(Figure 7-6 and see Figure 7-1), and was excavated
to the water table, 162 cmbs. Various matrixes
of construction ﬁll, ranging from rounded river
gravels to mottled clays, were encountered
throughout, along with modern trash (Appendix

Speciﬁcally, in clay soils one would
expect to see a pattern similar to an inverted
champagne glass, with larger
ﬂakes representing the zone
of occupation, and smaller
ﬂakes representing the upward
movement that has occurred. At
other sites in South and Central
Texas, archaeologists (Vierra
1998; Nickels et al. 1998:91-92;
Nickels 2000) have examined the
vertical movement of artifacts
through soil horizons, and they
have successfully correlated the
data with occupation levels. In
clay soils on an upper terrace
along a major drainage in Wilson
County, Nickels (2000:87) found

the unit to about 1 m below the

to beneﬁt archaeologically, this
unit also contributed to our
understanding that this area
around the swimming pool had
been ﬁlled in with more than 165
cm of sediment, and not dredged
as initially believed..
Unit 3 was placed in a
narrow grassy strip between the

this unit, we now know that the area around the
swimming pool was built up instead of dredged.
The base of the palm tree at 160+
cm below the modern surface
apparently represents the 1929
initial elevation level of the hotel
complex.
Unit 2 was placed in the
parking lot northeast of the
swimming pool (see Figure 7­
1). After breaking through the
pavement and excavating through
various matrixes of construction
ﬁll and modern trash (Appendix
A) to 165 cm, we encountered a
second road base (Figure 7-8).
Following a weekend, either the
rising water table or possibly a

by zones of human occupation are
what we would expect to observe
in these clayey soils. However,
the depositional context of
sediment and clay soils around
San Marcos Springs is such that
vertical movement of artifacts
through layered sediment and
soil packages due to size sorting
could be problematic (e.g.,
Stevenson 1991; Vierra 1998). To
evaluate the vertical movement
of debitage in layers below

cm; excavations were terminated at this depth
because the water table level was reached at 171
cm, and the unit was repeatedly ﬂooded. These
patterns suggest discrete human occupation
zones between 80-90 cm, 100-110 cm, 150-160
cm, and possibly 170-180 cm.

Unit 4

As stated above, we expect to see such
decreasing patterns in clayey soils. Notably,
the pattern between 150-110 cm shows a steady
increase in ﬂake size as we move upward.

The reader is reminded that the upper portion
of this unit consisted of gravels backﬁlled during
the construction of the swimming pool, and
thus we are not able to evaluate
neither the depth nor nature of
the soils above 80 cm. However,
a close examination of Figure 7­
14 suggests there are three trends
showing a decrease in ﬂake
dimensions from the bottom
upward. These are between
180-160 cm, between 160-140
cm, and between 110-90 cm. If
the upper portion had not been
removed, we would expect to
see another pattern of decreasing
ﬂake size.
These trends are followed
by a sharp increase in ﬂake
dimensions between 170-180

Figure 7-11. Excavations in progress. Unit 4 is in the grassy area by the
palm trees in the middle distance and Unit 5 is in the parking lot to the

there are three trends showing
a decrease in ﬂake dimensions
as we move from the bottom
upward. They are between 120­
100 cm, between 100-80 cm,
and between 80-50 cm. These
patterns suggest discrete human
occupation zones between 60-80
cm, 90-100 cm, and 110-120 cm.
The absence of any unbroken
ﬂakes recovered between 120­
130 cm precludes any patterning
for that level.
The patterns are as we would
expect, except between 160-140
cm, which shows a trend toward
an increase in ﬂake length. As
with Unit 4 above, based solely on this line of
data, we may conclude that these levels are
disturbed, or a change in lithic reduction strategy
occurred.

Figure 7-12. Antonio Padilla at screen and Jimmy Barrera in Unit 5;
Unit 6 is behind fence in background (between pickups); Facing South.

Normally, without data to conclude otherwise, one
assessment could be that these levels are possibly
disturbed. However, other corroborating data
such as soil susceptibility (discussed below) and a
general increase in total ﬂakes, fauna, and snails
follow the same trends, thus indicating increasing
intensity of occupation, peaking at the 120-110
cm levels. Of course, a general
shift in lithic reduction strategy,
such as from bifacial, late stage
reduction to expediently utilized
ﬂakes, could inﬂuence the ﬂake
size also.

Unit 5
The reader is reminded that
the upper portion of this unit was
truncated during the construction
of a parking lot, and the upper 40
cm was subsequently backﬁlled
with gravels; thus we are not able
to evaluate either the quantity
or nature of natural deposition
above 40 cm. However, a
review of Figure 7-15 suggests

Additionally, the recovery of relatively shorter
ﬂakes found between 150-160 cm (compared to
the level above) suggests a probable sixth zone of
occupation below 160 cm.

Unit 6
It is unclear whether or not the upper portion
of this unit had been removed during landscaping
activities in the area; only that the upper 15 cm
consisted of pea gravels and intrusive clay loam.
Figure 7-16 shows four trends with a decrease in
ﬂake dimensions as we move from the bottom
upward; those being between 150-130 cm,
between 120-90 cm, between 90-70 cm, and
between 70-30 cm. The recovery of relatively
longer ﬂakes between 20-30 cm (compared to the
three lower levels) suggests some removal of the
upper portion of this unit.

Soil Magnetic Susceptibility
General Discussion
Soils and sediments acquire magnetism from
the Earth’s ambient magnetic ﬁeld. The amount of
the magnetic force acquired by a sediment or soil
is called its magnetic susceptibility. Susceptibility
is proportional to the concentration of ferro- and
ferromagnetic minerals in the soil. The magnetic
susceptibility of soils can be altered by both
pedogenic and cultural processes. In both cases,

The patterns in Figure 7-16 suggest discrete
human occupation zones between 20-30 cm, 60­
70 cm, 80-90 cm, 110-120 cm and 140-150 cm.

noted by archaeologists and paleomagnetists,
has been derived from the presence of wood ash
and charcoal (Gose 2000). Granted, wood ash
also can be present due to past range and forest
ﬁres. However, horizontal studies within distinct
strata indicate that the increase in values around
prehistoric hearths is remarkably distinct, as is
the vertical separation of clearly distinguishable
cultural strata from natural strata (see for example,
Gose and Nickels 1998). This is particularly true
if multiple heating events are distinguishable in
the archaeological record (e.g., Heller and Evans
1995). In Central Texas, where many of the soils
are particularly carbonaceous and have high
ferromineral contents, the increase in magnetic
susceptibility values on archaeological sites is

the organically induced pedogenic and cultural
processes enhance (increase) susceptibility
values. In pedogenic studies, a signiﬁcant increase
in soil susceptibility values has been observed in
the A horizon of soil proﬁles, probably as a result
of organic activities, which creates maghemite, a
ferromagnetic mineral (see for example, Singer
and Fine 1989). Other research (e.g., Heller and
Evans 1995) indicates that the susceptibility
values can also be altered by changes in climate.
Even though the pedogenic and climatic
processes that may alter the magneticsusceptibility
of soils are important and beg further research
on and around archaeological sites, thus far the
most signiﬁcant variability in susceptibility

Soil Susceptibility Relative to Complete
Flake Length
In the two previous sections, we have separately
examined the vertical distribution of complete
ﬂake length and magnetic soil susceptibility. We,
in turn, interpreted the data as corroborating
evidence to suggest that human occupation levels
should be present between certain levels. Table
7-2 presents those levels where peaks in soils
susceptibility and ﬂake length are observed (see
Figures 7-14 through 7-16), and from which we
argued that these levels have a high potential for
containing intact cultural deposits. These data
reveal that generally, the susceptibility values

Site Speciﬁc Discussion
During this project, we collected soil
columns in Units 4, 5, and 6. The methods for
collection and processing are discussed in
Chapter 4. Figures 7-14 through 7-16 depict the
soil susceptibility values relative to ﬁre-cracked
rock features in each unit. Peaks in magnetic
susceptibility reﬂecting more intense human
occupation occur as follows: in Unit 4 between
90-100 cm and 130-140 cm; in Unit 5 between
50-60 cm, 100-110 cm, and 130-140 cm; and in
Unit 6 between 40-60 cm, 70-80 cm, 110-120 cm,
and 140-150 cm.

Several archaeologists (e.g., Simmons 1956;
Allen and Cheatum 1960; Jelks 1962; Johnson
1964; Hester 1995) have long believed that snails,
speciﬁcally Rabdotus, were a part of prehistoric
diets. Brown (2002:248) suggests that it is very
doubtful that snails would naturally be attracted
to, or survive on an archaeological site while it
was occupied for several reasons: 1) the intended
and unintended clearing of vegetation would
remove both the vegetal nutrients presumably
consumed by snails; 2) cleared areas allow for the
moisture to evaporate quickly and snails need this
moisture; 3) the compacted soils from human use
would contribute to a signiﬁcant decrease in the
moisture needed for snails to survive, and 4) the
mere trampling by humans would kill the snails.
In sum, at the Smith Creek Bridge site (41DW270),
Brown (2002:265) believes Rabdotus were most
likely gathered as a food source while the site
was occupied, and they then were attracted to the
site during periods of human abandonment.

their peak values just below the peaks in mean
ﬂake lengths.

Snails
Why are snails (particularly Rabdotus) so
prevalent on archaeological sites? Although some
researchers (e.g., Matteson 1959; Neck 1987c)
assert that they are drawn by calcium-rich mussel
shells also commonly found in abundance and
in association with large quantities of Rabdotus
(e.g., Nickels 2000), this is not the case at
41HY160; only 2 umbos were recovered during
this project. Although it is inconclusive whether
snails feast and thrive on living or dead organisms
(both plant and animal), many researchers (e.g.,
Mueggenborg 1994; Neck 1994b; Wright 1997)
believe snails are attracted in large quantities
to the decomposing organics left behind in
prehistoric cultural middens. On the other hand,
Brown (2002:248) points out that the snails may
be attracted not to the human organic garbage,
but rather to the lush, moist vegetation that
springs up in the enriched soils soon after a site is
abandoned, but before it is entirely covered over.
This would account for the direct association
of snails with middens. A problem with this
argument is that if middens accumulate with
repeated and continuous use, then snails should
only be present in the uppermost portion of the
midden (Brown 2002:248). Such is not the case in
most midden deposits, where snails are prevalent
throughout (e.g., Mueggenborg 1994).

Brown’s (2002) analysis of several species of
snails at 41DW270, as well as a Master’s Thesis
by Andy Maloff (2001), provide both theoretical
and innovative methodological approaches to
answering the question of why there are so many
snails on archaeological sites. Regardless of the
reason the snails are present, a general consensus
seems to be that snail densities increase and
decrease commensurate with increases and
decreases in cultural remains densities, such
as ﬂakes (e.g., see Brown 2002; Nickels 2000).

Unit 4 there appears to be a discrete separation
of intensive human occupation between 120­
130 cm and again between 160-170 cm. In Unit
5 we see the same phenomena between 120-130

pattern, suggesting that area was occupied with a
relative constant intensity through time.

sherd found between 50-60 cm in Unit 5 (4-14
cm below ﬁll zone), and a second small (79 mm)
glass sherd found between 60-70 cm in Unit 6
(45-55 cm below ﬁll zone). Although the tiny
glass sherd found in the screen from Unit 6 could
be troubling, all other data indicate no evidence
of disturbance to that depth and whatever process
introduced the glass had only a minor affect.

Summary
In sum, the vertical distribution and
clustering of artifacts within distinct soil zones
indicates discrete levels of occupation, and
strongly suggests different periods of occupation
at the site. Diagnostic artifacts and radiocarbon
dates indicate Late Prehistoric, Late Archaic, and
Middle Archaic components are present. This
evidence is discussed in the following section.

Intrusive Modern Trash
In the 1960s, a swimming pool and parking
lot were constructed in the area of the site where
Units 1 through 5 were excavated, and the Unit
6 area was and is still being used as a family
picnic area. As such, modern trash was found
in ﬁve of the six units (1, 3-6). Attesting to the
prehistoric components’ stratigraphic integrity,
all 72 fragmented pieces of modern trash
(Appendix A) were conﬁned to the construction

Chronology
The previous section discussed the sediment
deposition and soil formation processes that
have occurred at the site. Speciﬁcally, seven
77

horizons with cultural material were identiﬁed.
The purpose of this section is to build on the
soil horizon ﬁndings and the archaeological
excavation results in order to synthesize the
chronometric information in a coherent and
evidential manner.

Three lines of evidence are available
for dating deposits at 41HY160. The ﬁrst is
from time-diagnostic projectile points. The
second involves absolute dating techniques
and includes radiocarbon dating of three wood
charcoal samples. The ﬁnal technique involves
stratigraphy. This includes, at its broadest
level, the depositional sequences identiﬁed by
Nordt (Appendix E). Although no humate dates
were obtained, the soil horizons are relevant
to this discussion because they encompass
the stratigraphic ordering or superposition of
depositional units, and the artifacts within these
units, correlated previously in this chapter.

from Level 10, 170-180 cmbs, at the base of
Feature 12, a ﬁre-cracked rock hearth. Stafford
Laboratory Sample SR-6101 was collected from
Unit 6, Level 5, 70-80 cmbs within Feature 6, a
concentration of ﬁre-cracked rock, and with an
associated Pedernales point.

Projectile point types and radiocarbon dates
suggest that the site was also occupied as early
as 4450 B.P., during the Middle Archaic interval,
and into the Late Archaic interval. Evidence for
dating these occupations at the site is presented
in Table 7-7. An analysis of cultural remains
discussed in Chapters 8 and 9 suggests that the
site was occupied seasonally; whether or not it
was occupied year-after-year or periodically
through several millennia is unknown.

Evidence for Dating the Occupations
Within the Upper 1.7 Meters at 41HY160
Without associated absolute radiocarbon
dates, the Late Prehistoric Toyah phase component
can be only relatively dated. The recovery of a
single Perdiz point buried between 50-60 cm
below the modern surface in well-stratiﬁed
deposits is considered to reliably represent an
approximated period of occupation ca. 700-250
B.P. (Collins 1995). Although bone-tempered
pottery is often associated with Perdiz points,
none was found during this project.

A view of Figure 7-21 indicates that the
radiocarbon dates do not progressively get older
with depth. However, depths below the modern
surface become less signiﬁcant when the three
dates are plotted against the sloping soil horizons
identiﬁed by Lee Nordt (Figure 7-22). The dates
are in a rough stratigraphic sequence when
considering the soil horizon stratigraphy: near
the bottom of the AB Horizon. (3300±40 B.P.),

Summary
Several lines of data have been used to
evaluate the vertical integrity of the site. These
data validate the presence of intact buried cultural
deposits, and thus the overall high integrity in the
portion of 41HY160 tested by Units 4, 5 and 6
during this project. Speciﬁcally, we used mean
ﬂake length as a basis for evaluating the potential
natural disturbances that can occur around the
springs. The pattern we observed is generally
that expected on a site that has been periodically
inundated and exposed through ﬂooding,
layering it with silty clay vertisols, and is in a
climatic region of periodic wetting and drying. It
is a distinct pattern repeated in Units 4, 5 and 6
that suggests the presence of human occupations
within discrete zones, as corroborated by the
presence of non-diagnostic artifactual remains,
ﬁre-cracked rock cooking features, radiocarbon
dates, diagnostic artifacts, and soil susceptibility
variations.

Interestingly, no diagnostic artifacts dating
to the latter half of the Late Archaic were
recovered from Units 4, 5, and 6. Whether the
area was truncated naturally or artiﬁcially, or
whether the area was simply not occupied during
the latter half of the Late Archaic, is unknown. In
the previous chapter, Nordt depicted this slope in
Figure 6-8, which shows the probable locations
and depths of Late Archaic occupations in close
proximity to Spring Lake (west of Units 4, 5,
and 6). The sloping surface can also be seen in a
historic photograph taken before construction of
Aquarena Center and the swimming pool (Figure
7-23), suggesting that the slope was not caused
(and by implication, truncated) by artiﬁcial
causes.

ANALYSIS OFTHE VERTEBRATE
FAUNAL R EMAINS
Brian Shaffer

Introduction

Results of Analysis

Faunal remains recovered from excavation
of four units at 41HY160 revealed the presence
all ﬁve classes of vertebrates from a total sample
consisting of 4,388 specimens. Analysis was
undertaken to identify the taxa represented, the
taphonomic condition of the remains, and any
unique aspects, such as speciﬁc forms of cultural
modiﬁcation. This was accomplished using the
comparative specimens housed at the Institute
of Applied Sciences Zooarchaeology Laboratory
at the University of North Texas (UNT).
Identiﬁcations were made based primarily on
morphology and comparison with specimens
from the UNT collection. The one exception to
this was the identiﬁcation of cf. Bison sp. from
tooth specimens. The context and depth of the
specimens indicated they were prehistoric and
hence could not be domestic cattle. Since the
specimens were not readily separable from
domestic cattle, the identiﬁcation was left as
“cf.” This denotes that the specimens compare
favorably with the identiﬁcation as bison but
that the identiﬁcation is not deﬁnite. Data were
recorded using the vertebrate Faunal Analysis
Coding System (Shaffer and Baker 1992) with
the data transferred into Microsoft Excel as a
spreadsheet.

No unusual or unexpected taxa were
identiﬁed. All taxa identiﬁed were within
expected normal geographical distributions.
Faunal remains were tabulated using the number
of identiﬁed specimens (NISP). This is simply
the number of specimens identiﬁed to each
taxonomic category (Table 8-1). Commonly
used in conjunction with NISP, the minimum
number of individuals (MNI) was also calculated
(Table 8-2). The skeletal representation of each
taxon was examined to determine the minimum
number of animals that could be represented.
The entire assemblage was treated as a single
aggregate, so MNI was determined primarily on
the basis of element duplication. Animal age was
also taken into consideration, but in no case when
approximate age at death could be determined
did the number of aged specimens indicate a
greater number of individuals than represented
by element duplication.
Table 8-3 presents the taphonomic ﬁndings
by category. Table 8-4 provides a more in-depth
breakdown of taphonomy by taxon. A detailed
listing of faunal remains recovered from each
unit and level is provided in Appendix B. In terms
of natural processes affecting the assemblage,
with the exception of breakage, the assemblage
does not appear to have been greatly affected.
Weathering, or exposure to the weather-related
elements (sun, rain, etc.), was not a signiﬁcant
factor in the deterioration of the assemblage.

Spiral fractures can occur in most tubular bones
or thick-walled portions of bones, such as parts
of the pelvis particularly around the acetabulum,
the scapula in the area of the neck and spine of
the blade, and other such elements, when they
are fresh or contain collagen. Spiral fractures
may be associated with the processing of bone
for marrow or grease, but also may be caused by
other processes such as by carnivore gnawing.
No deﬁnitive carnivore bone breaking evidence
was observed. However, impact points were
noted on six specimens. Impact points represent
the points of percussion where bone is struck by
a hard object such as a hammerstone. The result
is a conical fracture that can be identiﬁed on the
interior of the bone. While most of the identiﬁed
impact points occurred singularly, one deer-sized
artiodactyl tibia shaft fragment was identiﬁed
with three impacts located along the same plane
down the shaft. Such impacts are indicative of
intentional attempts to open the bone as might be
done for the removal of marrow.

faunal sample, it is quite likely that the chemical
etching is the result of pH conditions within
the ground as opposed to carnivore or raptor
stomach acid. Rodent gnawing was also present
on several specimens but was generally limited
to only a few marks. There were exceptions. A
few of the specimens exhibited marked rodent
gnawing where much of the surface of the bone
was damaged. Although rodent damage seems
to be limited in the assemblage, the possibility
exists for rodent damage to speciﬁc specimens
to have been extremely destructive. It is also
possible other such examples were not recovered
because the specimens were reduced to a size
smaller than the screens would recover.
Broken bones were recorded as having angular
or spiral fractures. Angular fracturing occurs in
skeletal elements, such as ﬂat bones of the pelvis
blades, ﬂat sides of ribs, sternum, scapula, or
cranium of mammals and birds, as well as in
elements such as turtle shell. These may occur
either when the bone is still fresh or contains
collagen, or after the bone has lost its collagen.

number of identiﬁed shell fragments may be
due to the combination of fragmentation and
ease of identiﬁcation. Of the identiﬁed turtles,
an MNI of two was assigned to the Kinosternid
and Chrysemid turtles based on disparity of
element sizes. At least one larger and one smaller
individual were present in both groups.

by reptiles, birds, ﬁsh, and amphibians. While it
is expected that mammals would likely represent
the largest portion of the assemblage, the lack
of more aquatic species is surprising given the
proximity of the site to water. All of the identiﬁed
turtle remains include taxa that favor aquatic
habitats, however. The only possible exceptions
are the two specimens identiﬁed as Emydidae,
which includes box turtles; all other members
of the family, such as the painted turtles, sliders,
and cooters, are aquatic. Turtle shell elements
are easy to recognize as turtle, even from small
fragments. The presence of a relatively large

The lack of ﬁsh in the assemblage could be
attributed to the poor preservation typical of
ﬁsh remains due to their generally more fragile
composition, which makes them more susceptible
to taphonomic factors. However, there is no
88

While a large proportion of the assemblage
comes speciﬁcally from larger-sized mammals,
there is an interesting disparity that occurs when
compared to the smaller taxa, such as the cottontail
rabbits and the rodents. Based on MNI, no more
than one deer, one pronghorn, and one bison can
be attributed to representing the assemblage.
Represented by many fewer fragments, gophers
are represented by two individuals, cotton rats
by three, and cottontail rabbits by seven. Given
the generally poor representation of these smaller
taxa and lack of recovery of a signiﬁcant number
of elements from any one location, there is no
reason to assume they represent individuals that
died in burrows. The lack of chemical etching
indicates that they likely were not deposited as a
result of carnivore or raptor activity. There are no
cut marks or other direct evidence to conclusively
identify that they are the result of cultural activity
either. By the same reasoning, there is no direct
evidence that the pronghorn or the bison were at
the site as a result of cultural activity.

evidence to suggest that osseous ﬁsh elements
would necessarily decompose more quickly at
the site. For example, four of the gar elements
recovered were scales. Gar scales tend to preserve
very well even when other elements do not, and
each individual ﬁsh will have hundreds of scales.
It is therefore plausible to assume that ﬁsh did
not make up a large portion of the diet of the
inhabitants at this site.
After turtle, the next most commonly
recovered reptile was snake. Snakes were
identiﬁed as Colubrid (non-poisonous) and
Viperid (poisonous) based on the presence and
size of the ventral spine on the dorsal vertebrae
recovered. Once again, based on size, at least two
individuals were present in each group.
Birds comprised a small portion of the
assemblage. All avian specimens, however, were
from larger-sized birds. Most of the elements were
too fragmented for more speciﬁc identiﬁcation,
but they undoubtedly came from birds ranging in
size from duck to turkey.

So what can account for this disparity in NISP
and MNI representation amongst the mammals?
It is my feeling that the MNI representation is
likely more accurate in terms of the number of
individuals at the site. Smaller taxa are more
susceptible to recovery bias and to taphonomic
degradation than larger taxa. Specimens from
the smaller taxa may have been missed in the
recovery process or were recovered as fragments
that could not be identiﬁed as anything other
than Vertebrata. The recovered and more intact
specimens were identiﬁed and tallied.

Within the mammal component of the
assemblage, specimens from medium/large and
large/very large mammals dominate. Part of
the reason for this is that fragmented remains
from these larger taxa still can be identiﬁed to
class and approximate animal size. Fragmented
remains from smaller taxa, such as rabbits
and rodents, are difﬁcult to discern from nonmammalian fragmented remains, such as from
birds. Therefore, these specimens can only be
identiﬁed as Vertebrata. The higher level of largersized mammal remains compares well with the
presence of deer-sized artiodactyl that dominate
the identiﬁed mammalian assemblage, plus the
additional bison-sized artiodactyl specimens.
These match the more speciﬁcally identiﬁed deer,
pronghorn, and bison remains.

For the larger taxa, there is a greater
likelihood of being able to identify particular
elements. Even small pieces can be identiﬁed
because in relative terms, a small portion of a big
element from a deer is still considerably larger
than a big portion of a small element from a
cottontail rabbit. Landmarks and other features
89

are more easily identiﬁed. As such, the resulting
large mammal assemblage may be composed of
a high number of heavily fragmented remains
that can be attributed to only a few individuals
(see Table 8-4). In this case, a good portion of
the fragmentation of the larger mammals (such
as deer) undoubtedly was the result of human
activity based on the large number of spiral
fractures and impact points.

more general level. It is likely that the long bone
specimens are also from bison.

Of note, quite a bit of the expected artiodactyl
skeletons was not well represented although
fragments should have been quite visible and
identiﬁable. Only six specimens were identiﬁed as
rib fragments from medium/large mammals and
artiodactyls. Only three vertebral and one pelvic
specimen were identiﬁed. This indicates that
these portions most likely were not transported
to the site or were not processed in the areas of
the site excavated. Only one hoof was recovered
even though numerous foot and leg elements
were recovered. This may indicate that hooves
were taken with skins from the site.

Discussion

More troubling are the remains of carnivores
at the site, including raccoon, fox, and coyote.
These are almost entirely represented by teeth
and associated dental elements. What roles these
taxa played in relation to the human occupants of
the sight are not certain.

Analysis of the 4,388 specimens recovered
from 41HY160 produced some interesting results.
The assemblage is dominated by a large number
of fragments from larger taxa, but most of the taxa
recovered are smaller taxa, such as rabbits, rodents,
turtles, and snakes. Extrapolating from the data
available, the assemblage gives the impression of
large game exploited in low frequency and small
game exploited in a higher frequency. This is
not an unreasonable hypothetical perspective as
smaller game most likely was more readily and
locally available. The lack of key elements for the
larger artiodactyls indicates that these animals
may not have been killed locally and that they
have been butchered elsewhere with only portions
of the carcass returned to the site. Of the skeletal
elements that did make it to the site, many were
processed for marrow.

The large artiodactyl specimens from the site
are problematic. Bison is represented speciﬁcally
by teeth only. Large artiodactyl is represented
by long bone specimens but these were not of
sufﬁcient size to positively distinguish bison
from elk and so the identiﬁcations were left at the

PLANT R EMAINS FROM 41HY160
J. Philip Dering

Introduction
dissecting microscope, and comparing them to
references in the archaeobotanical herbarium.

CAS submitted 22 ﬂotation samples for
botanical analysis. This chapter presents a
description of the plant materials from the site,
and examines the archaeobotanical assemblage
in the context of other assemblages recovered
from sites in the region. Included in this data are
the identiﬁcation of seeds and wood fragments.

The anatomy of some woods is so similar
that it is very difﬁcult to identify to the genus
level. In other cases, genera within a plant family
are usually distinguishable, but some of the
archaeological material is often too fragmented
or deteriorated to allow identiﬁcation to the
genus level. For these reasons, I combine some
taxa into wood types. All identiﬁcations in the
“type” category represent identiﬁcations to the
taxon level indicated by the name of the type. The
following wood types or categories are used:

Methods
The analysis follows standard archaeo­
botanical laboratory procedures. Each ﬂotation
sample is passed through a nested set of
screens of 4 mm, 2 mm, and 0.45 mm mesh and
examined for charred material and separated
for identiﬁcation. Because of the high rates of
deterioration at most open archaeological sites
in North America, including those located in
arid regions, only carbonized plant materials are
considered to be part of the archaeological record.
Charred wood caught on the 4mm and 2 mm mesh
screens is separated for weighing, counting, and
identiﬁcation. Carbonized wood from the 4 mm
and 2 mm screens (smaller pieces are seldom
identiﬁable) were separated in a grab sample and
identiﬁed. The material caught on all of the sieve
levels, including the bottom pan, was scanned
for ﬂoral parts, fruits, and seeds. Identiﬁcation of
carbonized wood samples was accomplished by
using the snap technique, examining them at 8 to
45 magniﬁcations with a hand lens or a binocular

Willow/Cottonwood Wood Type (Salicaceae)
—Includes members of the Salicaceae, willow
and cottonwood, which are difﬁcult to distinguish
by genus.
Juniper/Cypress Wood Type (Taxodiaceae)—
Includes hawthorns, wild plums, and wild
peaches. Small fragments of the wood when
charred are difﬁcult to distinguish.
Indeterminate Hardwood—Refers to any
woody seed-bearing plant, i.e., not a cone-bearing
tree such as pine, cypress, or juniper.

9. There are seeds present throughout the core,
but these are not distributed evenly. The analyzed
portion of the core measures approximately
212 cm. If we divide it into four roughly 50 cm
sections, we can see that the majority of the
seeds are concentrated in the middle portions
of the core. There are only two seeds in the top
50 cm, but below that level seed abundance rises
signiﬁcantly. In the second 49 cm (712-761 cm)
there are 42 seeds, and in the third 58 cm section
(761-819 cm) the number of seeds rises to 87.
Only 25 seeds were noted in the bottom section
of the core below the 819 cm level.

Results
Archaeobotanical Assemblage
The samples were recovered from two areas
of the site. Fifteen samples came from Core D,
from about 6.6 meters below surface to a depth
of 8.7 meters below surface. Excavation Unit 4
contained several features from which seven
ﬂotation samples were analyzed. The botanical
materials from these two sampling areas
were quite different both in a qualitative and a
quantitative sense.
Most of the plant material in Core D is not
carbonized. Usually, uncarbonized plant material
is not considered part of the archaeological
record because deterioration occurs within a
few years of deposition. However, because of the
depth of the core and the presence of waterlogged
sediments, there is a possibility that this material
is contemporaneous with the archaeological
deposits at the site. The samples in Core D
contained 105 seeds and 24 seed fragments,
none of which were charred. In addition, acorn
fragments (n=3) were noted from FS 9 and 12.
Twelve carbonized wood fragments weighing .3
gram occurred in the core. By contrast, most of
the small amount of material identiﬁed from Unit
4 was carbonized. Identiﬁed botanical material
from Unit 4 included one charred cheno-am seed
and seven charred wood fragments.

Unit 4
Table 9-2 contains the results of the analysis
from Unit 4. The seven samples contained a
single Cheno-am seed and seven fragments of
wood charcoal. One of the fragments was oak,
and two were of the juniper/cypress wood type.
All of the identiﬁed plant material from Unit 4
was carbonized.
Analysis and interpretation of ﬁeld notes has
indicated that Features 3, 7, and 9 are all part of
a slab-lined hearth that has been re-designated
Feature 3; hence samples U4 1–5 are from the
same feature. This is a nearly intact ﬁre-cracked
limestone cobble feature, with tabular limestone
lining the base of a 50-cm deep pit. A radiocarbon
assay yielded an age of 3300±40 B.P. This is
the feature from which we recovered the single
cheno-am seed. Although a single cheno-am seed
does not constitute very hard evidence for bulk
processing of this resource, it suggests that some
cheno-am processing occurred in the slab-lined
feature.

Core D
Results from Core D samples are presented
in Table 9-1. These are correlated to Depositional
Unit A (see Chapter 6) and date to 9585±40 B.P.
(10,940 cal. B.P.) or older. Eleven different taxa are
represented in the samples, including potentially
economic seeds of goosefoot, hackberry, prickly
pear, grape, and acorn fragments. None of the
seeds were carbonized. A few fragments of
charred wood were recovered from Samples 8 and

Feature 11 (combined from Features 11
and 12) was a ﬁre-cracked limestone cobble
concentration. A single radiocarbon assay from
the feature produced a Middle Archaic age
(4325±45 B.P.). Carbonized wood recovered from

utilization of acorns in California suggests that
oak processing often may not have encouraged
accidental charring of acorns (see Gifford 1936
for summary of processing), one possible reason
why acorn fragments are not often encountered
in open sites.

this context indicated that either juniper or bald
cypress and oak were utilized as ﬁrewood.

Discussion and Ethnobotanical Overview
If the Core D plant materials are indeed
contemporaneous with the cultural materials from
41HY160, then these materials present signiﬁcant
information regarding subsistence patterns of the
region. There are ﬁve economically important
plants recovered from the core, including
goosefoot, hackberry and grape, prickly pear, and
acorn fragments. In addition, a single carbonized
cheno-am seed was recovered from Unit 4.

In addition, there is not much evidence for
baking acorns in earth ovens, perhaps the most
common cooking feature in the region. Several
references mention roasting either whole acorns
or ﬂour (Gifford 1936; Dixon 1907). However,
most of the ethnographic observations note that
heat or ﬁre is often not used until the acorns are
reduced to ﬂour (Gifford 1936; Kroeber 1953).

Acorns
The presence of pericarp fragments at
41HY160 suggests that acorns may have been
utilized as a food source at the site. A total of
three acorn fragments were recovered from
two samples, FS 9 and 12. It is quite possible
that acorns played an important part in Archaic
and Late Prehistoric subsistence in the region
(e.g., Creel 1986) but direct evidence is not
overwhelming. Acorns have been recovered
from some other sites on the Edwards Plateau,
including the Honey Creek site (41MS32), and
41BN63 in Bandera County (Dering 1997;
2002). The extensive literature that exists for the

Initial processing centered around the removal
of tannic acid from the acorns. The process usually
followed two procedural pathways, either burial
of the whole acorn or leaching the ﬂour (Gifford
1936:86). In one method mentioned speciﬁcally
for live oaks, entire acorns were buried in the
ground or in mud until they molded (Dixon
1907:426). In the other method, the meat was
separated from the shell and then pounded into
ﬂour (Gifford 1936:86; Jackson 1991). Leaching
of either whole acorns or the ﬂour often would
occur on the bank of a stream or other body of

94

the Southwest and Mesoamerica, there are very
few ethnohistoric notations of its use in Texas.
Cabeza de Vaca describes how the Mariames
preserved prickly pear fruit by squeezing,
splitting, and drying the fruit. The same source
describes roasting prickly pear pads and green
tunas (fruit) without describing how the oven
was constructed (Favata and Fernandez 1993
[1555:72, 84]). My experiments demonstrate
that green prickly pear fruit requires earth oven
baking for at least 12-15 hours, so the term “roast”
is probably not functionally accurate.

water, making the location of 41HY160 an ideal
place to process acorns.

Cheno-am or Goosefoot
Cheno-am refers to the seed-like fruit
(achene) of either Chenopodium (Goosefoot) or
Amaranthus (Pigweed). The term is used when a
seed is modiﬁed by carbonization, a process that
often obscures some of the shape and surface
sculpturing of the achene. The material from
Unit 4, which is charred, has been assigned to
the category cheno-am. The uncharred material
from Core D can be assigned to the genus
Chenopodium. For practical purposes, however,
both plants serve roughly the same functions in
the regime of a forager in the Edwards Plateau
region. Both goosefoot and pigweed were utilized
throughout their range in North America as a
potherb (Bye 1981). The seeds of both genera,
which are parched and ground into ﬂour, have
been important to many groups throughout the
southwest, including the Zuni, Navajo, and the
Papago (Russell 1908; Stevenson 1915; Vestal
1952). Some species of goosefoot are cool-season
plants, setting seed in the spring after winter
growth (Bohrer 1991).

Hackberry and Grape
Both hackberry and grape are mid-to-late
summer fruits that were utilized by most Native
American groups. Although neither made a major
contribution to the diet, they were added to many
meals. Unlike acorns or prickly pear, there are no
references to the mass processing of grapes and
hackberry into a storable long-term carbohydrate
source. Grapes were eaten fresh or dried for
temporary storage by several groups throughout
the Southwest (Palmer 1878:616; Havard 1884:104;
Hedrick 1919:599). Hackberry fruits/nutlets were
pounded into powder and added to other foods by
several Plains groups (Gilmore 1977:24).

Prickly Pear

Conclusions

A single prickly pear seed was recovered
from Core D. This tremendously important
economic plant was utilized by Native Americans
throughout its range. In Texas, prickly pear
has been noted in archeological deposits in the
northern, central, southern, and western reaches
of the Edwards Plateau, including the Honey
Creek site (41MS32), 41MK8 in McCullough
County, 41VV1897 in northern Val Verde County
(Dering 2002), and dozens of rock shelter sites in
southern Val Verde County (Dering 1999; Irvin
1966).

The carbonized material from Unit 4 is
unquestionably archeological in nature. The
cheno-am seed and the wood charcoal from
Feature 3 suggests seed parching or processing
using hot coals. The juniper/cypress and oak
wood from Feature 11 also indicates utilization of
both oak and juniper or bald cypress wood as fuel.
The antiquity of the botanical material from both
Features 3 and 11 is suggested by radiocarbon
ages from these contexts that places Feature 3 in
the latter part of the Middle Archaic Period and
Feature 11 in the Late Archaic Period.

Although prickly pear was considered to be
of utmost importance to many groups throughout
95

site and the presence of springs suggests that
41HY160 may meet these conditions. If this is
the case, then the archeological record indicates
that the area was occupied periodically during
the late spring/early summer and later in the
late summer/early fall seasons. The goosefoot
seeds could come available earlier in the growing
season, and prickly pear and acorns are ready to
eat later in the growing season.

The
uncarbonized
archaeobotanical
assemblage from 41HY160 presents a special
case. At open sites throughout North America it
is normal procedure to consider only carbonized
plant material to be part of the archeological
record (Miksicek 1987). The only exceptions
to this “open site” rule are plants that are kept
in anaerobic conditions, especially waterlogged
conditions. The deeply buried nature of the

beveling, completeness, break type, maximum
length, blade length, blade width, haft length,
neck width, base width, and maximum thickness.
Finally, all specimens were exposed to ultraviolet
light to evaluate raw material source.

This chapter describes the culturally altered
lithic material collected from hand excavated units
during this project. The purpose of this chapter is
to highlight the overall tool assemblage; selected
pieces found in association with features will be
discussed in Chapter 11: Analysis of Cultural
Features. A total of 18,378 pieces of chipped
stone, 2 pieces of ground stone, 1 hammerstone,
and varia (miscellaneous) items were recovered
during the excavations (Appendix A).

The eighteen projectile points found were
classiﬁed into the following subgroups: arrow
point, dart point, or dart point preform. In this
system, preforms are recognizable as a stage of
projectile point manufacture in that they have
barbs and/or shoulders but were not completed,
and they can be classiﬁed as a type (e.g., Marshall
preform [Bradley 1975]).

Chipped Stone
During the analysis, the chipped stone
artifacts were subdivided into the following
classes: projectile points (n=18), bifaces (n=82),
unifaces (n=213), cores (n=19), and unmodiﬁed
debitage (n=18,046). After artifacts were
catalogued, classes were analyzed according to
a variety of attributes. The attributes provided
a thorough technological and morphological
characterization of the lithic assemblage at the
site. The attributes for each class are deﬁned
below.

The projectile points and preform were then
assigned to a projectile point type based on the
commonly accepted point typology developed
for Central and South Texas (e.g. Turner and
Hester 1999), and classiﬁed into types by Steve
Tomka and Elton Prewitt. Points which could
not be assigned with conﬁdence to a previously
established type were coded as “untypable,” a
designation generally reserved for fragmentary
specimens lacking enough diagnostic attributes
to determine their size or shape (see Table 10­
1). One point was coded as “untyped”; it has
enough diagnostic attributes to establish it as a
type, but those attributes do not ﬁt into any of the
previously deﬁned projectile point types.

Projectile Points
Projectile points are one of the more
important artifact categories because they can
provide information on cultural afﬁliations and
chronology. For projectile points, the following
attributes were recorded: raw material type,
97

If a point was incomplete, the break could
be coded as either use/resharpening related,
manufacture, post-depositional, or indeterminate.
Length and width measurements were made only
for those dimensions that were complete.

Arrow Point
Perdiz (700-250 B.P.)
Although there is a wide variation in Perdiz
arrow points, they are triangular in shape,
usually exhibiting well-barbed shoulders and a
contracted stem. In Central Texas Perdiz points
are diagnostic to the Toyah phase of the Late
Prehistoric interval, approximately 700-250 B.P.
(Collins 1995).

Tables 10-1 and 10-2 provide data on the
projectile point assemblage, and Figures 10-1
and 10-2 show the points recovered during this
project. All but two are made of ﬁne-grained
chert, and all but two have been burned or were
otherwise exposed to intensive heat. Additional
data including dimensions, results of ultraviolet
light evaluations, and detailed provenience
information were also recorded. The points were
assigned Unique Item (UI) numbers in the lab.

UI 8–Perdiz
The only Perdiz recovered during this
project (UI 8) was found in Unit 5, Level 6. Its
distal end is missing, and its right barb (from a
dorsal view) has been broken off, likely during its
manufacture. The opposite side is well-barbed,
and its slightly contracting stem is broad with a
convex base (Figure 10-1a).

The blades of Marshall
points “vary from triangular

basal and vary from narrow
to broad, and stems vary from
square to slightly expanding,
often short compared to the
length of the blade. Bases are
concave or straight to slightly
convex, although Turner and
Hester (1999:149) exclude convex
bases from their type deﬁnition”

of the Edwards Plateau (Johnson and Goode
1994).

UI 1 – Marshall
UI 1 (Figure 10-1b) is a Marshall point
collected from the backdirt pile of Core C. It is
triangular in shape, with convex lateral edges, a
slightly expanding stem, and originally a straight
base. Its remaining barb was created as a result of
corner notching. The core drill removed the other

UI 7 (Figure 10-1c) is also triangular in

distal end that gradually becomes thicker toward
the shoulders. Complete except for two missing
barbs, it has a straight stem, with a slightly
concave, well-thinned base. According to Elton
Prewitt (personal communication, April 2001),
this specimen is a classic Marshall that has been
nicely reworked, leaving a ridge on both faces
from the reworking. It was found in Unit 6, Level
9.

Pedernales/Marshall Transition Points
(2700-2100 B.P.)
Two points (UIs 4 and 13) with characteristics
of a Pedernales to Marshall technological
transition were recovered. “Johnson (1995:202­
206) demonstrated the close relationship among
the Marshall, Pedernales, and Montell point types
and postulates a Bulverde-Pedernales-MarshallMontell/Castroville cultural continuum in the
ﬁrst part of the Late Archaic” (McKinney et al.
2001:157). Elton Prewitt (personal communication,
April 2001) describes the Pedernales to Marshall
transition as a temporal drift occurring against
the Balcones Escarpment from San Antonio to
Austin during the early part of the Late Archaic.
Prewitt sees it as a gradual transition among a
single social unit only in the corridor from San
Antonio to Austin, in the Blackland Prairie to the
Post Oak belt.

UI 12 – Marshall-like
UI 12 (Figure 10-1d) has such extensive use
damage along both lateral edges to its slight
shoulders that it is difﬁcult to identify as a type.
It resembles a Zephyr base because of its slight
edge smoothing, but unlike a Zephyr, its stem
is not beveled. Given its other morphological
characteristics and its excavated context from
Unit 5, Level 12, it is most likely a Marshall
(Elton Prewitt, personal communication, April
2001). Its stem is symmetrical, showing ﬁne
thinning ﬂake removals, and a concave base. In
addition, mineral accretions are adhered to the
surface of this specimen.

UI 4 - Pedernales/Marshall
UI 4 (Figure 10-1f) was found in Unit 6, Level
13. It is a Pedernales in transition to a Marshall
that is missing part of one basal ear and has
been heavily reworked (Elton Prewitt, personal
communication, April 2001). This is a short (37
mm) point with one strong shoulder remaining
that is barbed. Its stem is rectangular with a
moderately deep basal concavity. Finally, it has a
very sharp, needle-like distal end, with use wear
along its slightly recurved lateral edges.

UI 20 – Marshall Preform or “Practice
Point”
According to Elton Prewitt (personal
communication, April 2001), UI 20 is a Marshall
practice point (Figure 10-1e), a form that is
commonly found with completed Marshall points.
It has a manufacturing failure along its distal
end that has been deeply notched, constituting
a practice piece. Its stem is typical Marshall
size, although the stem expands moderately,
getting toward Marshall expanding stem types.
Although it has a slightly concave base, it is
otherwise generally ovate in shape, formed from
markedly convex lateral edges. Slight barbs have
been formed by corner notching. This specimen
was found in Unit 4, Level 10.

UI 13 - Pedernales/Marshall
UI 13 (Figure 10-2a) was found in Unit 4,
Level 9. It is an unﬁnished specimen with slightly
convex lateral edges and strong shoulders. Its
stem is straight, with a concave base that has
large basal thinning ﬂakes removed from both
sides. One basal ear is missing, and the distal end
is missing due to a manufacture failure.

102

UI 19 – Pedernales

Pedernales Points (4250-2300 B.P.)

UI 19 (Figure 10-2e) is a Pedernales point
found in Unit 4, Level 11. Its rectangularshaped stem has straight lateral edges, is deeply
bifurcated, and exhibits ﬂuting ﬂake scars. One
shoulder is lacking most of a barb, and the opposite
shoulder is weak. Its distal tip has been broken
off during use, and there is evidence of heavy use
damage along the blade’s distal portions.

The Pedernales point is “one of the most
common point types found in Central Texas,
where they are frequently associated with
burned rock middens” (Black and McGraw
1985:113; McKinney 2001:163). Their common
occurrence in archaeological sites may be due
to their supposed long span of manufacture, for
perhaps nearly 2,000 years. “Thick, rectangular
stems and deeply indented or bifurcated bases
with a characteristic ﬂake-scar pattern make
up the most identiﬁable trait of the Pedernales
dart point style (Black and McGraw 1985:113;
Johnson 1995:200; Miller and Jelks 1952:175), a
fortunate circumstance since Pedernales blades,
though nominally triangular, in truth vary
quite amazingly in size and shape.” (McKinney
2001:163).

Travis Point (4450-4000 B.P.)
Most recently, Travis points recovered
from excavations at the Wilson Leonard site
(41WM235) in Williamson County have been
described as “rather elongate points [which]
characteristically exhibit convex-edges blades
that tend to converge into the stem area with
little or no demarcation of shoulders…Stems are
generally square to gently expanding, and basal
edges may be dulled or lightly ground” (Dial et
al. 1998:408). Collins (1995:376) approximates
the age of Travis points in Central Texas to range
between 4450 and 4000 B.P.

UI 6 – Pedernales
UI 6 (Figure 10-2b) is a Pedernales basal
fragment that exhibits post depositional heat
spalls and breakage. This proximal piece found
in Unit 6, Level 8, has a slightly expanding stem
that is deeply bifurcated, and has sub-cortex
along its base.

UI 18 – Travis
UI 18 (Figure 10-2f) is an unﬁnished Travis
point that has a straight stem and base, but is
lacking its distal point due to a manufacturing
failure. Its generally straight lateral blade edges
converge into the stem’s very slight shoulders. It
was collected from Unit 4, Level 12.

UI 11 - Pedernales
UI 11 (Figure 10-2c) is a Pedernales stem
with a deeply concave base. Although it is wellthinned, and has straight, slightly ground edges,
it appears to have been broken while still in the
manufacturing process. It was found in Unit 5,
Level 11.

Untypable Points (Ages Indeterminate)
UI 5
UI 5 (Figure 10-3a) is an untypable Archaiclike dart point that has been reworked into a
scraper. It is beveled to the left from a dorsal
view, creating a scraper-like working edge; the
opposite lateral edge is straight. A long ﬂake scar
is running down its ventral face, and the beveled
edge is damaged from use. It has moderately
strong shoulders, and a long, gently expanding
stem. Its concave base contains cortex all along

UI16 – Pedernales
UI 16 (Figure 10-2d) is a Pedernales stem
collected from Unit 4, Level 12. It is straight,
with well-trimmed lateral edges, a deeply
concave base, and ﬂuting ﬂake scars. It exhibits
a fracture due to extreme heat; presumably postdepositional damage.

possible manufacturing error. This thick (10 mm)
specimen contains knots and hinge fractures
on both sides, and exhibits incomplete corner
notching, suggesting that it could be a perform. In
its unﬁnished form, it has slightly convex lateral
edges, with strong shoulders and weak barbs.
It has a very wide and short contracting stem,
with a concave base. In addition, it has mineral
accretions adhering to both sides. It was found 83
cmbs in Unit 5, Level 9.

its basal edge. The stem is edge ground, thus it is
deﬁnitely not a Marshall; edge grinding occurs
all through the Archaic in Texas. An example is
the Late Archaic, Zephyr point (Elton Prewitt,
personal communication, April 2001). This point
was collected from Unit 6, Level 12.

UI 9 (Figure 10-3b) is an unﬁnished,

that slightly taper to converge into an expanding
stem. It has a concave base, and a dorsal ridge
beginning near its distal tip and running nearly
three-fourths of the length of the blade. It was
found in Unit 6, Level 15 and this provenience
would suggest that it may be contemporary with
Nolan or Travis forms.

UI 10 (Figure 10-3c) is a proximal, base
fragment of a dart point broken due to a
manufacturing failure. The stem is contracting,
with a moderately deep basal concavity. There is
lateral smoothing on its edges, but there is too
little of the specimen remaining to type it. It is
too thick to be Paleoindian, and too wide for
Angostura; its excavated context suggests that
it is likely Pedernales (Elton Prewitt, personal
communication, April 2001). It was found in Unit
5, Level 10.

Non-diagnostic Bifaces
Methodology
Chipped stone artifacts that have been
ﬂaked on both sides of the same lateral edge are
classiﬁed as bifaces (Figure 10-4a). The goal of
analyzing non-diagnostic bifaces at 41HY160
was to evaluate the manufacturing technology
that was occurring at the site. A total of 82 bifaces
provides a credible sample size. Included in the
assemblage are 11 complete specimens. Classiﬁed
functionally, the assemblage also includes a crude
end scraper and a chopper (Figure 10-4b). One of
the bifaces is beveled. Three could be classiﬁed as
quarry blanks (Figures 10-5c, d; 10-6b), and two
are sub-triangular types (Figures 10-4c, d) very
common on the Edwards Plateau (Elton Prewitt,
personal communication, April 2001).

UI 14
UI 14 (Figure 10-3d) is a proximal fragment
that exhibits moderate shoulders and an
expanding stem with a slightly concave base. It
is not completely corner notched (Elton Prewitt,
personal observation, April 2001), and its distal
end is missing due to a large ﬂake removal attempt
that hinged, causing a manufacturing failure. It
was found in Unit 4, Level 17.

UI 21
UI 21 (Figure 10-3e) is an untypable point
collected from Unit 5, Level 16. It exhibits use
damage along the distal portion of its lateral
edges, and its distal tip is missing due to a use
fracture. A large portion of one lateral edge of this
specimen is missing due to a post-depositional
fracture; however, the remaining lateral edge
is straight, with a moderate shoulder, a short
expanding stem, and a straight base.

For each specimen, the following attributes
were recorded: raw material type, raw material
grain, burning, presence or absence of cortex,
tool completeness, length, width, stage of
reduction, and evidence for tool recycling. While
the analytical data for each individual specimen
is presented in Appendix F, Table 10-3 presents
a compilation of data for the entire assemblage.
Colors ranged from grayish white to yellowish
brown and brown. Material type is not shown
in the Table 10-3 because all were made from
chert.

Untyped Point
Although UI 3 resembles a Darl (Figure 10­
3f), it exhibits only slight beveling on its stem, and
is lacking beveling along its blade. Otherwise, it
could conceivably be a Darl, but its workmanship
is not that normally observed on Darls (Elton
Prewitt, personal communication, April 2001).
This specimen is long (68.5 mm) and narrow
(17.2 mm), with slightly convex lateral edges

Raw material grain was simply noted as ﬁne
or coarse. Burning or heating was coded as either
being present or absent, and was determined by

The stage of reduction of a biface was coded
as either early, middle, late, or indeterminate
(Collins 1975). To insure consistency, all bifaces
were coded by the author. Early stage bifaces
(n=15) usually retain a small to large amount of
cortex and have relatively few ﬂake removals,

the presence of crazing, and/or discoloration with
a waxy feel. Tool completeness was coded as
either complete, incomplete, or indeterminate. All
bifaces were measured to the nearest millimeter,
Their attributes are summarized and discussed in
the following paragraphs.
108

functionally and typically classiﬁed as “choppers”
are normally early stage bifaces with a cortex
covered proximal end and a crudely ﬂaked distal
end. Their distal ends commonly show usewear derived presumably from activities such as
butchering and woodworking (Turner and Hester
1999). Three early or middle stage reduced pieces
exhibited possible expedient use wear, and were
likely used in this condition.

all of which were removed by hard hammer
percussion. The edges of these bifaces are
generally very sinuous when viewed in proﬁle.
Middle stage reduction bifaces (n=36) are
typically thinner than early stage bifaces, have
little or no cortex remaining, and have numerous
ﬂake scars, many of which may extend beyond
the mid-line of the biface. The edges are less
sinuous than those of early stage specimens. Late
stage reduction bifaces (n=26) are thin, have no
cortex, and have numerous ﬂake scars. Most of
the ﬂakes from late stage reduction are removed
by billet or soft hammer percussion. Flake scars
are, therefore, relatively longer and more shallow
than in early stage reduction. The edges of late
stage bifaces are usually straight when viewed in
proﬁle. Five of the 82 bifaces were too fragmented
to determine a stage of reduction, and were coded
as “indeterminate”.

Biface shape was coded as either ovate,
pointed-ovate, triangular, round, or indeterminate.
The pointed-ovate form is characterized by a
rounded or convex base with a pointed blade. A
triangular biface has a pointed blade and straight
base.
Break type was classiﬁed as manufacture,
use, post-depositional, burning, or indeterminate.
Manufacture breaks typically result from either
lateral biface thinning failures or basal thinning
failures (Tomka 1986). A common break type

Bifaces may be utilized at any stage in
the reduction process. For example, artifacts

associated with lateral biface thinning failures
is known as a perverse fracture. Deﬁned by
Crabtree (1972:82), perverse fractures are easily
identiﬁed by the twisting of the fracture plane on
a rotational axis that corresponds to the direction
of the force that initiated the fracture.

unifaces were recovered and classiﬁed during
this project (Table 10-4). The degree of retouch
for unifaces is a subjective category. The possible
classiﬁcations are expedient, minimal, formal,
and indeterminate. Expedient unifaces are ﬂakes
that have been modiﬁed through use, but not by
intentional ﬂaking or shaping. Without the use
of a microscope, I scanned all 18,378 pieces of
debitage for the presence/absence of expedient
unifaces, ﬁnding a total of 148. Minimally
retouched unifaces have not been drastically
altered from their original form, but some ﬂaking
has been used to alter the shape of one or more
of its edges; there are 60 within the assemblage.
Five formal unifaces were also found. Formal
unifaces include artifacts functionally classiﬁed
as scrapers, gouges, or unifacial knives. One
or more of their edges have been signiﬁcantly
shaped through the deliberate patterning of ﬂake
removals. Selected specimens of unifaces are
shown in Figure 10-7.

Use breaks commonly result from impact
with a hard surface or material, or from prying
(Tomka 1986). End shock, resulting in a
transverse fracture, is caused when the elastic
limits of the material are exceeded (Crabtree
1972:60). In replication studies, Tomka (1986:94)
demonstrates that end shock type breaks result
from using a biface to pry something, as well
as from the suspended weight of the shaft when
hafted bifaces were thrown with sufﬁcient force
to penetrate wood. Impact occasionally results in
the removal of burin-like ﬂakes along the lateral
edge of a biface and/or crushing at the point of
impact (Tomka 1986:94).
Post-depositional breaks are typically the
result of force applied to the lateral surface of
a biface. This results in a bulb of percussion
originating not from the edge of the artifact, but
from its face (Tomka 1986:96). Post-depositional
breaks can result from numerous activities
including natural and artiﬁcial factors.

Colors ranged from grayish white to yellowish
brown and brown. Material type is not shown in
Table 10-4 because all were made from chert.

Flake from Core E
A ﬂake made from Edwards chert was
recovered from Stratigraphic Unit A gravels in
Core E at a depth of 7.14-8.53 meters below the
surface (Figure 10-7d). This ﬂake is 54.3 mm
long, 34.3 mm wide and 11.2 mm thick. Much
of the facetted platform and edges have been
damaged recently from the drilling process. This
is the oldest in situ cultural material recovered.

Breaks resulting from burning are heat
fractures, or pot lids, and are the result of
differential expansion and contraction of the
parent material. Unlike a fracture resulting from
direct force on the material, as is the case with
the removal of a ﬂake, burning fractures and pot
lids lack compression rings (Crabtree 1972:84).

Although broken, it measures 88.9 mm long, 35.1

marks are present on its outer sphere.

below datum) (Figure 10-8a) can be described as
a ﬂat- or concave-surface metate, or as a milling
slab similar to those milling slabs illustrated
from 41KM16, the Buckhollow Encampment, in
Medina County (Johnson 1994:151-160). Although
broken, this particular specimen is 103.2 mm
long, 26.5 mm wide, and 26.5 mm thick at its
thickest point. It is heavily encrusted with alkaline
accretions, possibly hiding striations. Although its
slightly concave dorsal surface is heavily coated
with calcium carbonate, smoothed, rounded, and
polished coarser granules are visible. This broken
piece was apparently recycled as a tabular heating
stone in the base of Feature 3, a slab-lined hearth
(see Chapter 10).

Hammerstone
A quartzite hammerstone (Figure 10-8c) was
also found near the base of Feature 3 (see Chapter
11). It is a complete specimen, measuring 67.8
mm long, 59.4 mm wide, and 41.0 mm thick. It
has deep pock marks, more so on one lateral edge
and end than elsewhere.

Other Materials

Discolored from burning, a mano fragment
(Figure 10-8b) was recovered near the base
of Feature 3, two levels above the milling slab
fragment described in the previous paragraph.
The mano is also made from limestone, and is

The miscellaneous items we describe in
this section are calcite and quartz crystals, and
burned clay.

one ﬂake out of the over 18,000 recovered during
the excavations was made from quartz crystal.

Calcite Crystal
A small, prismatic, calcite crystal was found
in Unit 6 between 150-160 cmbd. Its clarity has
been dulled, it weighs 7.3 grams, and is 27.7 mm
long. It is not culturally altered.

Burned Clay
Chunks of burned clay weighing a total of
41.2 grams were recovered from Unit 6, between
120-130 cmbd. Although all were discolored in
varying hues of red and gray, one piece appears
to have an imprint of a piece of bark on its deeply
reddened face. It cannot be determined whether
the bark impression is natural or is the result of a
daub mixture.

Quartz Crystal
A translucent piece of quartz crystal was
found in the same unit and level as the calcite
crystal described in the previous paragraph. It is
10.2 mm long and weighs only .7 grams. Only

ANALYSIS OF CULTURAL FEATURES
David L. Nickels

Feature Excavations
Five unique features recorded in Units 4, 5,
and 6 are listed in Table 11-1, and are described
in this section. Data on the cultural remains
discussed in connection with the features may be
found in the accompanying appendices. Stereonet plots used in this discussion are duplicated
from Wulf Gose’s Appendix D to this report.

Feature 1: Fire Cracked Rock Concentra
tion – Unit 6

The reader will note that the feature numbers
are not sequential. We liberally assigned feature
numbers in the ﬁeld with the approach that it’s
better to be a splitter than a lumper, and features
are more easily combined than split once the
ﬁeldwork is complete and the units are backﬁlled.
As such, after reviewing the data in the lab, we
elected to combine feature numbers designated
in the ﬁeld. Features 1, 6 and 13 were combined
as Feature 1. Although a scatter of bone, ﬂakes, a
tooth, and small FCR was assigned Feature 2 in
the ﬁeld, subsequent laboratory analysis indicated
that there was nothing special about the scatter;
it was not outside the norm of cultural material
found in other levels and units, and thus Feature
2 was re-categorized as a non-feature. Feature 3,

When the tops of ﬁre-cracked rock were
initially encountered 60 cmbs in Unit 6, they were
designated as Feature 1. As excavation continued,
additional ﬁre- cracked rocks similar in size and
quantity were uncovered in subsequent lower
levels (see Table 11-2). During the excavation it
was unclear whether the underlying ﬁre-cracked
rocks between 70 and 80 cm, and 80-100 were
related, and thus they were designated as Features
6 and 13. However, as the rocks were analyzed
in the laboratory, it became apparent that those
from 60-100 cm were similar in size and quantity,
and the plan maps and photographs showed no
discretely distinct patterns between levels. That,
along with the corroborating data from ﬂakes,
soil susceptibility, fauna, and snails suggest that

7 and 9 were combined as Feature 3. Features 4
and 5 were combined as Feature 4. Features 8 and
10 were combined as Feature 8. Features 11 and
12 were combined as Feature 11.

greater than 1-inch in size, 5,060 snails, and 368
grams of faunal material (see Table C5 for details).
A wood charcoal fragmented dating to 3550±45
BP, and a Pedernales projectile point were found
between 70-80 cmbs. A Marshall dart point was
found between 80-90 cmbs. No ﬂotation samples
were analyzed as charred remains were not visible
in the ﬂotation sample.

Features 1, 6 and 13 are one and the same, and
hereinafter will be referred to as Feature 1.
Feature 1 is described as a loosely integrated
scatter of ﬁre-cracked limestone cobbles and
oxidized clay (Figures 11-1 and 11-2) between 60­
100 cmbs. Hearth stones spread approximately 40
cm vertically suggests that they may have been
placed in a pit, however we saw no evidence of
a pit in the rather homogeneous
clays, nor were there tabular
stones normally observed in
slab-lined pit hearths (see for
example, Nickels et al. 2001:45­
118). Although the hearthstones
had been scattered and were no
longer in situ, the burned clay
was reddened from oxidation,
and provided a clear contrast to
the surrounding, darker clay.
Cultural material recovered
in association with Feature 1
included 2,241 complete and
3,985 incomplete ﬂakes, 251
pieces of ﬁre cracked limestone

Archaeomagnetic Results

Feature 3: Slab-lined Hearth – Unit 4

Based upon a review of their apparent context
and suitability, a total of 13 archaeomagnetic core
samples from 13 different rocks
in Feature 1 were selected for
analysis (Figure 11-2). A review
of Figure 11-2 would seem to
indicate two roughly in situ,
circular patterns of ﬁre cracked
rocks in the north central
and northeastern portions of
the unit. Unfortunately, the
archaeomagnetic data indicates
that none of the 13 analyzed
rocks were in situ (see Appendix
D).

Feature 3 (Figures 11-3 and 11-4) is described
as a partially intact ﬁre cracked limestone cobble

and paleomagnetic analysis are shown in
stereoplots in Figure 11-5. Of those, four samples
representing three rocks (Numbers 25, 27, 28,
36) show evidence of being heated to in excess
550 oC, and have moved only slightly since they
cooled in place after the last cooking event. Note
that the rocks from which these samples came are
relatively larger (Figure 11-4), suggesting they
may represent the latest usage of the cooking
feature. Had they been subjected to repeated
usage, they likely would have fractured into
smaller pieces. Of the remaining eight samples
representing six rocks, seven might have been
heated twice, with low temperature components
ranging in temperatures from 200 oC to 400 oC,
and high temperature components between 450
o
C and 600 oC.

Cultural material recovered in association
with Feature 3 included 626 complete and 2,348
incomplete ﬂakes, 1,119 pieces of ﬁre cracked
limestone greater than 1-inch in size Table 11-3),
3,613 snails, and 484.4 grams of faunal material
(see Table C5 for details). In addition, a hammer
stone, a mano and a tabular milling stone fragment
that was apparently recycled for use as a heating
stone within the base of the feature (see Chapter
11). A wood charcoal assay from 107 cmbs in
Feature 3 dated to 3300±40 BP.
A single, charred cheno-am seed and an
indeterminate species of charred wood were
recovered from a ﬂotation sample collected within
Feature 3, between 105-110 cmbs. Phil Dering
(see Chapter 9) suggests that the combination of
these two specimens implies that cheno-am seeds
(either goosefoot or pigweed) were being parched,
or processed over hot coals. After parching, the
seeds most likely would have been ground into
ﬂour. Most probably growing wild, the stems and
leaves of cheno-am plants are known to have been
used in historic times as both food and medicines
(Castetter 1935).

Of the 12 samples (eight rocks) that were
heated to between 200 oC and 400 oC, eleven are
generally in a grouped pattern when plotted on a
stereo-net plot (see Figure 11-5), indicating that a
few may have rotated only slightly since they were
heated and allowed to cool. Notably, those rocks
on the western edge of the hearth were heated to
lesser temperatures than the rest of the hearths
stones (Appendix D). One rock (Sample 33) has
ﬂipped upside down. Sample 29 is problematic;
although it came from the same rock as Samples
27 and 28 which are relatively intact, Sample 29
does not group well with Samples 27 and 28. It
could be that the sample moved during extraction
after we measured its dip and angle, or we simply
did not record the proper dip and angle.

Archaeomagnetic Results
A total of 42 archaeomagnetic samples were
drilled from ﬁve different levels in Feature 3
(Table 11-4 and Figure 11-4).

Level 8 – The Top of Feature 3

cm, based on radiocarbon dates
accumulated for multiple burned
rock middens in Central Texas
(Black et al. 1997; Mauldin et al.
2003), we believe the radiocarbon
date more accurately dates its
usage.
Evidence obtained through
the use of archaeomagnetic
analysis indicates multiple
ﬁrings occurred in the pit,
likely for parching or processing
cheno-am seeds (either goosefoot
or pigweed) over hot coals (see
Chapter 9). Although relatively
few rocks have remained in place
since they were last heated and
cooled, scattered and collapsing
stones may be expected in and
around a cooking pit feature that
is repeatedly being used, cleaned
out, and reused.

Normally, one would expect to see larger
burned and/or ﬁre cracked cobbles left in place at
the bottom of a cooking feature within a burned
rock midden. However, we believe that this pit
feature may represent the initial use of a larger
burned rock midden. An examination of Table
11-3 indicates that the larger rocks are near the
top of Feature 3. Our personal observations
and ﬁeld sketches indicate that most of these
are tabular, used to line the pit. Otherwise, the
rocks remaining near the base of the pit are
progressively smaller, presumably having been
ﬁred repeatedly. Archaeomagnetic data available
for Levels 9-12 corroborates this scenario in that
the rocks showing evidence of the least multiple
ﬁring events were in Level 9 (90-100 cmbd), while
those with the most multiple ﬁring events were in
Level 10, between 100-110 cmbd (see Table 11-9),

2500C. All three rocks sampled had been heated
multiple times.

Summary of Feature 3
Feature 3 is a partially intact ﬁre cracked
limestone cobble feature with a basal tabular
limestone lining inside a 50-cm deep pit between
83-133 cmbs. Although recovered in chronological
stratigraphic order, diagnostic Pedernales and
Marshall projectile points found between 90-119
cmbs may or may not date the pit accurately if the
points were moved with turbated earth during the
digging, covering, and cleaning out of the pit, in
much the same manner as a burned rock midden
(e.g. Leach and Bousman 1998; Leach et al. 2005;
Mauldin et al. 2003). Although the same concept
could apply to a radiocarbon date of 3300±40 BP
obtained from about halfway into the pit at 107

size considered).
Finally, Mauldin and others (2003) have
demonstrated that tiny pieces of ﬁre cracked
rock <1-inch in size will accumulate at the base
of cooking features within the larger midden.
However, Feature 3 is not within a midden
context, has not likely been subjected to intensive
use over long periods, and is generally more
restricted in circumference near its base.

The only two ﬁre cracked rocks which could
be successfully drilled in the ﬁeld were submitted
for analysis (see Figure 11-11). Admittedly two
samples are not adequate for dependable results,
and unfortunately, the archaeomagnetic data
indicates that neither of the two were in situ (see
Appendix D).

hearth remnants, while a ﬁfth is considered as
a generally intact limestone cobble cooking pit
with tabular limestone lining around its upper
portion. Diagnostic projectile points found in
association with the ﬁve features suggest that they
were used during the Late Archaic period, and
radiocarbon dates obtained from wood charcoal
more speciﬁcally indicate their use at 3300±40
BP, 3550±45 BP, and 4325±45 BP.

Archaeomagnetic Results

Limited charred remains from these features
suggest that cheno-am seeds (either goosefoot or
pigweed) may have been parched, or processed
over hot coals. After parching, the seeds most
likely would have been ground into ﬂour. Most
probably growing wild, the stems and leaves of
cheno-am plants are known to have been used
in historic times as both food and medicines
(Castetter 1935). The recovery of a ground stone
mano and a milling stone fragment suggests that
the occupants ground some form of seeds or nuts
for consumption. Juniper or cypress, and oak were
being used as fuel wood for the campﬁres. The
bones of a variety of animals were also recovered
in association with the features (see Chapter 8),
as well as snails. Whether or not snails were used
as a food source is debatable (see Chapter 7).

A total of ten samples representing nine
different rocks were successfully collected from
Feature 11 (see Figure 11-16). The results of their
being subjected to reheating and paleomagnetic
analysis are shown in stereo-net plots in Figure

rocks generally cluster, most have been rotated,
and/or turned upside down since they were last
heated and cooled. They are not in situ and have

SUMMARY AND R ECOMMENDATIONS
C. Britt Bousman

Results of Testing
In January of 2001 the Center for
Archaeological Studies excavated six 1-x-1-meter
excavation units at the Spring Lake Site (41HY160)
in the area to be affected by the construction of the
Texas Rivers Center. Units 1-3 sampled disturbed
sediments throughout their exposures. Units 4-6,
however, did encounter in situ sediments within
some of the exposed sediments.

First, the valley was scoured to bedrock
by erosion before ~11,470 B.P. (13,320 cal B.P.)
when some of the earliest alluvial sediments
were deposited in the present ﬂoodplain. The
initial deposit, Depositional Unit A, consisted
of wide spread channel gravels that were capped
by marsh deposits. Unit A accumulated between
11,470-9585 B.P. (13,320-10,940 cal. B.P.) and
potentially contains signiﬁcant Early Paleoindian
occupations as a ﬂake recovered from the channel
gravels in Core E suggests. At some point between
9585-7365 B.P. (10,320-8185 cal. B.P.) localized
channel entrenchment terminated the deposition
of Unit A and the eroded channel began to ﬁll
with marsh and gravel deposits that constitute
Unit B sediments. A reasonable age estimate
for the erosion event between Unit A and Unit
B is 9500 cal. B.P. It is possible that important
Late Paleoindian materials are contained in
Unit B sediments as a ﬂake recovered from
Core R suggests. Renewed channel aggradation
beginning no later than 7365 B.P. (8185 cal. B.P.)
marks the accumulation of Unit C sediments.
These overbank gravels and marsh deposits
continued to accumulate until at least 5925 B.P.
(6740 cal. B.P.) and possibly as late as cal. 5910 cal.
B.P.. Early Archaic materials might be preserved
in Unit C sediments. At the latest by 4325 B.P.
(4910 cal. B.P.) but probably as early as 5910 cal.
B.P. a thick ﬁne-grained ﬂoodplain sediment was
rapidly deposited to form Unit D and it covered
the entire ﬂoodplain. Unit D sediments form the

Geoarchaeology and Chronological
Results
The geological sequence presented by Lee
Nordt in Chapter demonstrates that the San
Marcos River has a complex and remarkably
complete sedimentary record of Late Pleistocene
and Holocene geological history. The potential
for a remarkable archaeological record is great.
Twenty two geologic cores were extracted from
the ﬂoodplain of the San Marcos River and Sink
Creek extending from the hotel across the valley
to the Texas State University football ﬁeld. The
geoarchaeological investigations demonstrated
the presence of ﬁve depositional units in the
ﬂoodplain. Nine radiocarbon dates have been
measured on organic carbon from these deposits.
The discussion will use both radiocarbon years
and tree-ring calibrations using the OxCal
program. It should be noted that no attempt was
made to date stratigraphic boundaries, but this
should be a goal in future geoarchaeological
investigations.

gnawing. There is limited botanical evidence for
cheno-am (Chenopodium and Amaranthus spp.)
seed consumption in the Late Archaic Feature 3,
and very good preservation of Late Pleistocene
and Early Holocene macrobotanical remains
(goosefoot, hackberry, prickly pear, grape, and
acorn fragments) from Depositional Unit A. It
is unclear if these older, well-preserved, ﬂoral
remains are related to human activities as they
were recovered from a geological core, but if older
occupations are present it is highly probable that
well preserved ﬂoral remains could be recovered
from these deposits and the other marsh deposits
in Depositional Units A, B and C..

bulk of the T1 sediments and contain Middle
and Late Archaic occupations. After 3300 B.P.
(3535 cal. B.P.) deposition slowed considerably
and a thick A Horizon formed on the surface.
Also at this time Sink Creek began to downcut
its channel and the area around the springs were
also entrenched. Unit E T0 alluvial sediments
began to accumulate creating a narrow modern
ﬂoodplain adjacent to Sink Creek and the springs.
Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric materials are
present in the top of Unit D and probably present
in the Unit E sediments. No radiocarbon assays
were obtained from Unit E.

Archaeology Findings
Signiﬁcance Assessment of the
Recovered Cultural Resources
and Recommendations for Future
Investigations

Only disturbed sediments were exposed
in Excavation Units 1-3, near the Hotel, but the
sediments (Depositional Unit D) exposed in
Excavation Units 4-6 uncovered Late Prehistoric
to Middle Archaic components in a well-stratiﬁed
and datable context. In Units 4-6 temporally
and culturally diagnostic artifacts consisted of
Perdiz arrow points and Marshall, Pedernales
and Travis dart points. Radiocarbon assays of
wood charcoal document a Middle Archaic
component dated to 4325 B.P. (4910 cal. B.P.)
and Late Archaic components dated to 3550 B.P.
(3830 cal. B.P.) and 3300 B.P. (3535 cal. B.P.). The
vertical frequency and size distribution of lithic
artifacts as well as burned rock cooking features
suggested that multiple prehistoric components
were present in the A and B horizons of Unit
D. Archaeomagnetic analysis of the burned
rock demonstrate that the features were intact
cooking facilities. Additional ﬁndings indicate
that faunal preservation is very good and these
materials consist of a wide variety of small
animals (mammals, snakes, turtles and ﬁsh) as
well as many larger mammals including bison,
antelope, and deer. Most of the bones are highly
fragmented, but it appears to be due to human
processing and cooking, and not to carnivore

41HY160 is a State Archaeological Landmark
and, in regard to the criteria employed by the
National Register of Historic Places (especially
Criterion D), its signiﬁcance is not in question.
The major question asked of these investigations
is whether the area planned for construction of
the Texas Rivers Center contained archaeological
deposits in a well preserved context or had they
been disturbed by 20th Century construction
activities?
In the west side of the project area, near the
Hotel, intact sediments were not encountered in
Excavation Units 1-3. This is due to a number of
factors. First, it is clear that before any signiﬁcant
construction at the San Marcos Springs, a natural
channel lead into the Springs from the north that
was possibly an overﬂow channel of Sink Creek
(see Figure 7-23). The ground level of the Hotel
was approximately 1.5 meters lower than the
current ground level. The swimming pool, which
is now removed, was placed in this channel. It
appears that a limited amount of terrace sediment

132

was removed for the deeper portions of the pool,
but in order to place the pool at its height, a fair
amount of sediment was needed to ﬁll in the natural
channel. This resulted in the burial of the lower
stairways leading from the hotel to the Springs.
Also at some point, gravel was placed in the area
with the paved parking lot to the northeast of the
Hotel. This created a ﬂat and level area between
the golf course and the Springs. Because of the
elevated water table in this area, intact sediments
were only observed in cores.

are very near the surface on the peninsula at
41HY160. Also the work of Shinier and other
investigators demonstrates that the immediate
area contains a wealth of Paleoindian, Archaic
and Late Prehistoric materials. The sediments
adjacent to and below Excavation Units 4-6 will
also contain similar aged prehistoric occupations.
Any future construction or other activities that
would adversely impact the known or suspected
archaeological materials at the Spring Lake Site,
41HY160, should be mitigated.

Further to the east in the area near Excavation
Units 4-6, a thin sediment cap representing ﬁll
was encountered at various thicknesses in these
three units, but below this were intact sediments.
These sediments contain the archaeological
materials described in this report. It is clear
from these results that the archaeological
materials in this area are well-preserved in
a good stratigraphic context and that they
should be investigated if further construction
is undertaken. Unpublished, and at this time,
unanalyzed materials from previously excavated
units suggests that archaeological materials

The primary goal of this project was
successfully achieved and the results of the
archaeological testing indicate that high
resolution well-preserved artifactual and faunal
materials will be present in future excavations.
The preliminary analyses undertaken in the
project will not conclusively answer all of the
research questions posed in Chapter 4, however,
the results of this project suggest that the research
questions that consider prehistoric economy,
technology and mobility in a environmental
context can be successfully addressed with data
recovered from 41HY160.

APPENDIX B

FAUNAL R EMAINS
Brian Shaffer
Faunal remains recovered from 41HY160 identiﬁed the presence all ﬁve classes of vertebrates from
a total sample consisting of 4,388 specimens. Analysis was undertaken to identify the taxa represented,
the taphonomic condition of the remains, and any unique aspects, such as speciﬁc forms of cultural
modiﬁcation. This was accomplished using the comparative specimens housed at the Institute of
Applied Sciences Zooarchaeology Laboratory at the University of North Texas (UNT). Identiﬁcations
were made based primarily on morphology and comparison with specimens from the UNT collection.
The one exception to this was the identiﬁcation of cf. Bison sp. from tooth specimens. The provenience
of the specimens indicated they were prehistoric and hence could not be domestic cattle. Since the
specimens were not readily separable from domestic cattle, the identiﬁcation was left as “cf.” This
denotes that the specimens compare favorably with the identiﬁcation as bison but that the identiﬁcation
is not deﬁnite. Data were recorded using the vertebrate Faunal Analysis Coding System (Shaffer and
Baker 1992) with the data transferred into Microsoft Excel as a spreadsheet. All original identiﬁcations
are presented here.

ARCHAEOMAGNETIC ANALYSIS
Wulf Gose

Introduction

Example of How the Analysis is Conduct
ed

A total of 111 archaeomagnetic samples
from the Texas Rivers Center was processed
and analyzed in the Paleomagnetic Laboratory,
Department of Geological Sciences at The
University of Texas at Austin. The purpose of
this appendix is to provide detailed data and
information regarding the individual samples.
Archaeomagnetic analysis of ﬁre-cracked
rock reveals whether or not a feature has been
disturbed since the last heating and cooling
event. It can also provide an estimate for the how
many times a rock has been heated and to what
temperatures.

Figure C-1 shows the changes in the vectors
of magnetism for four samples from Unit 4,
Level 8, Feature 3 (U4-8-3). In this equal area
projection, declination is measured clockwise in
angles with north plotted at the top of the circle
and inclination is 0° at the periphery and 90° at
the center of the stereonet. Positive inclinations
are shown by crosses and negative inclination by
open circles. “PDF” indicates the present magnetic
ﬁeld direction in San Marcos. The direction of
magnetization of culturally burned rocks should
plot within about 30° of this orientation if they
have remained fully undisturbed since their
last heating. The shaded ellipse in Figure C-1
delineates this 30° area.

The methods used in collecting and processing
the samples has been discussed in Chapter 4. All
samples were thermally demagnetized in 50°C
increments from 150 to 600°C in the laboratory.
After each demagnetizing event they were allowed
to cool, their magnetic vectors were measured by
a cryogenic magnetometer, and then recorded on
a computer database, before being reheated to the
next higher increment. The resulting data were
plotted in orthogonal vector diagrams and equalarea stereonets for principal component analysis.
An example of how these are interpreted follows
below.

The magnetic vector of Sample 36 from
Feature 3 groups tightly up to the 550°
demagnetization step. Upon exceeding the
magnetite Curie point (580°C), the direction
vector changes orientation. Sample 24 changes in
the same manner. The direction of both samples
falls within the expected area. By contrast,
Samples 30 and 26 have negative inclinations.
All archeological samples should have positive
inclinations if they remained in situ and thus the
stereonet implies that these samples have moved
signiﬁcantly since their last heating.
However, a different interpretation emerges
when one looks at the data in vector component

and, within the same graph, the

Level 8 (80-90 cm bd)
Feature 3 in Unit 4 was
excavated at four different levels.
The highest level sampled for
magnetic analyses is level 8. Four
cores carry only one component
of
magnetization
pointing
in a north-easterly direction
(Figure C-3a). This implies
that these rocks were heated to
above 550°C and moved only
slightly since the last heating
event. The other cores from this

Figures C-8 and C-9 depict the equal-are
stereographic projections for the 13 samples
from Levels 7, 8, and 9. Most of the directions
of magnetization are randomly distributed which
raises the question whether the few directions
which may indicate in situ heating, are not also
part of a random distribution.

Of the 3 samples collected at this level, only
Sample 101 carries a magnetization (low-T) which
may have been acquired in situ (Figure C-7). All
three have temperature components indicating
more than one heating.

Summary

Feature 4, Unit 5

The archaeomagnetic data do not delineate a
distinct heating pattern. Only a limited number
of samples yield directions of magnetization that
could be interpreted as having been acquired

Only two samples is not sufﬁcient for an
overall evaluation of a feature. Both samples
have been disturbed (Figure C-10).

An equal-area stereographic plot of the data
from 23 samples from Feature 8 (Figure C-11)
indicates that the samples are not quite random
but nearly so. This indicates that they are highly
disturbed.

The ten samples from Feature 11 provided
little useful data (Figure C-12). Although it
appears that the rocks generally cluster, no
component of magnetization with linear trend
of at least three consecutive data points was
identiﬁed.
