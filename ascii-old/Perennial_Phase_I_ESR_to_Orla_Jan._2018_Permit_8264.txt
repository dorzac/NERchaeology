ABSTRACT
Crestwood Midstream Partners LP (Crestwood) intends to construct a new 16.0 mile (mi) (25.7 kilometer
[km]), 20-inch diameter natural gas pipeline to be located in Loving and Reeves counties, Texas referred
to as the ESR to ORLA HP Pipeline Project (Project). The majority of the Project will traverse private
property and is not subject any state or federal regulatory triggers. However, one segment totaling 0.48 mi
(0.77 km) will cross property owned by Texas A&M University (Texas A&M), a political subdivision of
the State of Texas. As such, the portion of the Project that traverses the Texas A&M property falls under
the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of Texas (Code). As this property, designated herein as the
Permit Area, is owned by Texas A&M, cultural resources investigations were conducted in order to
satisfy the requirements of the Code. The purpose of the survey was to identify any prehistoric and
historic-age archeological sites located within the Area of Potential Effect (APE) and evaluate their
significance and eligibility for designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL). The cultural resources
investigations were conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) Permit No. 8264. The
remaining portions of this pipeline traverse private property. As such, only the portions of pipeline
corridor that crosses state lands will be discussed herein.
To provide flexibility to Crestwood during workspace design, Perennial Environmental Services, LLC
(Perennial) conducted survey efforts within a broader Environmental Survey Area (ESA) that totaled
approximately 17.6 acres. Actual Project impacts will be restricted to a smaller workspace, the limits of
which will be determined following engineering analysis. Depths of impact associated with the actual
APE are anticipated to range from 3.0 to 6.0 feet (ft) (0.9 to 1.8 meters [m]). Jennifer Cochran served as
the Principal Investigator (PI) for the Project and Colene Knaub and Rafael Cortez conducted the field
efforts on December 22, 2017.
In all, a total of 38 shovel tests and 9 bucket auger tests were excavated across the Permit ESA.
Subsurface investigations tests revealed diverse soil textures such as fine sand, silty loam and loamy clay.
Auger testing was terminated upon reaching compact sand or the presence of compact limestone
inclusions at 110.0-175.0 cm (43.0-69.0 in.) below ground surface. No evidence of any cultural resources
was observed along the modern ground surface or within any of the shovel tests or bucket augers
excavated within the Permit ESA.
Based on the results of the survey effort, no intact, significant cultural resources will be affected by any
construction activities within the Permit Area. In accordance with the Code, Perennial recommends no
further cultural resources investigations within the 17.6-acre Permit ESA.
Should historic properties and/or human remains be encountered during construction, work in the
immediate area will cease and a qualified archaeologist will be called to evaluate the finding(s) and
provide recommendations for how to manage the resource under the State Historic Preservation Plan. All
findings will be reported to, and activities coordinated with the appropriate interested parties. In the event
that human remains are encountered, all activity that might disturb the remains shall cease, and may not
resume until authorized by appropriate law enforcement, and/or the Texas Historical Commission (THC).

PERMIT ESA DESCRIPTION
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The Permit ESA is located approximately 5.5 mi (8.8 km) east of Orla, Texas, and lies within the
floodplain of the Pecos River. According to aerial imagery and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
topographic maps, the Permit ESA is situated within an erosional setting with disturbances
present along the central portion from a past oil and gas activities. Topography across the Permit
Area consists of rolling uplands with vegetation typical of the Trans-Pecos ecoregion (Griffith
2004). Much of the landscape is dominated by desert grassland, but many of the native grasses
have been replaced by scrub vegetation as a result of overgrazing. Landscape alterations caused
by prolific oil and gas development are also prevalent across much of this region.
GEOLOGY AND SOILS
Geologically, the Permit Area is underlain by Terrace Deposits (Qt) (USGS 2017). These
deposits consist of sand, silt, clay, and gravels with calcium carbonate (caliche) deposits in
terraces along streams. These deposits typically date to the Pleistocene and Holocene age.
Elevation across the Permit ESA averages 2750.0 ft (839.0 m) above mean sea level (amsl).
Four soil types are mapped within the Permit ESA, and these soil series are associated with
floodplains. The Harkey series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in
calcareous mixed alluvial sediments derived from sedimentary material. These soils are found on
floodplains and stream terraces with slopes of 0 to 3 percent. The Patrole series consists of very
deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in stratified silty over clayey alluvium.
These soils are on nearly level flood plains with slopes ranging from 0 to 1 percent (National
Resources Conversation Service [NRCS] 2017). The Monahans series consists of very deep,
well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in ancient alluvium containing significant
amounts of gypsum and calcium carbonate. The Pajarito series consists of very deep, and well
drained soils that formed in a sandy to moderately sandy mixed sediments from mixed sources.
These soils are typically on plains, bajadas, and alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent,
dominantly 1 to 3 percent (NRCS 2017).
METHODS
BACKGROUND REVIEW
Prior to initiating fieldwork, Perennial conducted a records and literature review of the Texas
Historical Commission (THC)’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database and the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) database to identify previously recorded cultural
resource sites, historic structures, properties listed on the NRHP, designated historic districts, or
designation as SALs which could potentially be affected by the proposed Project. Any

previously recorded cultural resource site forms, reports of archaeological investigations, general
historical documents, and secondary sources concerning the background of the area were
reviewed. The records search included a review of all previously recorded site forms and
surveys on file within a 1.6-km (1.0-mi) review radius of the Permit ESA.
In addition to a records and literature search, archeologists gathered information from secondary
sources concerning the prehistoric and historic background of the area. Documents associated
with the history of the area were used to model prehistoric and historic settlement patterns in
relation to the landscape and terrain characteristics as well as cultural patterns and regional
trends. NRCS soil data, the USGS Orla SE, Texas 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle, aerial
photographs, and contemporary geologic and physiographic features were also examined.
FIELD METHODS
The cultural resources survey was performed by a team of two archaeologists. The field crew
surveyed the entire 0.48 -mi (0.77-km) segment within the Permit Area. In areas with ground
surface visibility less than 30 percent, the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards
(TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per 1.0 mi (1.6 km) for linear survey corridors
measuring up to 100.0 ft. (30.5 m) in width. However, the ground surface visibility across all
surveyed portions of the Permit ESA was excellent ranging from 80 to 90 percent visibility. As
such, no minimum shovel tests were required across the Permit ESA. In accordance with the
approved scope of work (Appendix A), Perennial implemented an intensive shovel testing and
pedestrian survey program. Specifically, two transects of shovel tests spaced approximately
164.0 ft (50 m) apart were excavated within the Permit ESA in order to assess the area for buried
cultural deposits. Each shovel test was placed approximately 98.4 ft (30.0 m) apart along each
transect.
Per the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA)/THC survey standards, shovel tests were
excavated to a depth consistent with the project impacts or to the base of Holocene deposits
likely to contain cultural resources unless dense, impenetrable clay soils or inundation prevent
the continuation of excavations. Shovel tests measured approximately 11.8 inches (in) (30
centimeters [cm]) in diameter and were excavated to a depth of 3.3 ft (1.0 m). In many cases,
shovel tests were terminated at shallower depths due to the presence of compact sand with high
concentrations of caliche or leached soils. All soil matrices were screened through 6.3-millimeter
(¼-inch) mesh hardware cloth unless dominated by clay. Clayey matrix was trowel-sorted and
visually inspected. The matrix from each shovel test was screened through 0.25-in (6.0millimeter [mm]) mesh. For each shovel test, Perennial recorded the following information on
standardized shovel test forms: location, maximum depth, and the number of soil strata. For
each soil stratum, thickness, texture, color, and the presence or absence and nature of cultural
materials were recorded. During field survey, the archaeologist was equipped with a handheld

sub-meter GeoXT Trimble GPS device, topographic maps and aerial photographs of the Permit
ESA, a digital camera, as well as shovel test and photographic logs, and daily journal forms.
In addition to shovel testing, a hand-operated auger was utilized within the Permit ESA to probe
for deeply buried cultural materials below shovel testing capabilities (i.e, 3.3 ft [1.0 m]). If the
auger probes revealed that buried horizons or evidence of cultural materials were present at
depths below shovel testing capabilities, then additional work in the form of backhoe trenching
would have been utilized to adequately assess these deposits. However, the auger testing
revealed that deep alluvium containing cultural deposits was not present within Permit ESA. As
such, additional investigation in the form of mechanical trenching is not recommended for any
portion of the Permit ESA.

RESULTS
BACKGROUND REVIEW
Perennial archaeologists conducted a thorough background and archival desktop analysis of the
Permit ESA prior to field inventory surveys. Utilizing data collected from the THC’s Atlas
(2017) online database and the NRHP database, indicated that there are two previously recorded
archaeological sites (41LV32, and 41LV33) mapped within the 1.0-mile (mi) (1.6-kilometers
[km]) radius of the Permit Area (Atlas 2017) (Figure 2 and Figure 3). Neither of these sites are
located within, or directly adjacent to the Permit Area (Atlas 2017). According to the Atlas
(2017) one previous cultural resource survey intersects the eastern portion of the Permit ESA. A
linear survey was conducted by SWCA in January 2016 for the Medallion Delaware Basin
Project. The survey was negative for cultural resources.
Site 41LV32 is a prehistoric lithic scatter located 0.4 mi (0.64) km east of the Permit ESA.
Observed cultural materials include 15 pieces of lithic debitage, a one-handed mano fragment,
two utilized flakes, an edge-modified flake, and two cores. Given the sparse nature of surface
materials, lack of subsurface deposits, and the heavy prior disturbance, this site is not eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP.
Site 41LV33 is a prehistoric lithic scatter located 0.77 mi (1.23 km) to the east of the Permit
ESA, approximately on the project centerline, 0.36 mi (0.58 km) east of 41LV34. Observed
cultural materials include 15 pieces of lithic debitage, a one-handed mano fragment, two utilized
flakes, an edge-modified flake, and two cores. Given the sparse nature of surface materials, lack
of subsurface deposits, and the heavy prior disturbance, this site is not eligible for inclusion in
the NRHP.
Prehistoric archeological sites in this region are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial
terraces near stream/river channels, arroyos, or drainages. Archaeological site patterning across

the region traversed by the Permit ESA exhibits an obvious preference for riverine settings in
proximity to landforms overlooking the Pecos River and its tributaries. A brief review of the
previously recorded sites along the Pecos River within a 5.0-mi (8.0-km) radius of the Permit
ESA was conducted. Generally, a variety of sites, from lithic procurement sites to campsites,
were observed within and immediately adjacent to the Pecos River floodplain. However,
according to the Atlas (2017), all of the sites within the review radius and within a similar setting
to the Permit ESA were recorded as surface sites with artifacts and features noted in near surface,
or on the modern ground surface. This patterning suggests that the likelihood for deeply buried
cultural materials within the palimpsect alluvial deposits of Pecos River floodplain is relatively
low.
In regard to historic-age resources, the lack of visible structures in proximity to the Permit ESA
on the relevant topographic quadrangle maps and on Google Earth aerial imagery suggests a
decreased potential for historic-age standing structures and associated cultural deposits within
the Permit ESA. This is likely a factor of the remote nature of the Permit ESA setting.
FIELD SURVEY
On December 22, 2017, two archaeologists carried out an intensive surface and subsurface
cultural resources investigations across the Permit ESA (Figure 4). Vegetation across the Permit
ESA consisted of typical West Texas scrub vegetation including creosote, sotol, species of cacti
and native grasses. Overall, ground surface visibility was excellent, ranging from 80 to 90
percent. The landscape across the Permit ESA consisted of open range across the Pecos River
floodplain (Figure 5 to Figure 7). Evidence of extensive overland erosion was noted across
much of the Permit ESA.
Pedestrian survey efforts were initiated along the western end of the Permit ESA. The field crew
traversed the Permit ESA from west to east along evenly spaced transects placed approximately
49.2 ft (15.0 m) apart along the width the Permit ESA. The modern ground survey was carefully
examined for any signs of cultural materials or features present within the Permit ESA. No
evidence of any cultural materials was observed in surface contexts
Due to proximity to the Pecos River, subsurface testing efforts were also conducted within the
Permit ESA in order to examine for buried cultural materials or buried soil horizons with the
potential to contain intact cultural deposits. Shovel tests were excavated along two transects
spaced approximately 164.0 ft (50.0 m) apart along the Permit ESA. Each shovel test was
excavated at 98.4-ft (30.0-m) intervals along each transect. Bucket augers were also excavated
along each transect at the location of every fifth shovel test in order to examine the presence of
deeply buried cultural materials. In practice, the auger was employed to excavate a small 4-inch
soil core. The intact soil core was examined while contained within the auger bit so that any

stratigraphic soil changes could be identified and documented. The soil from the core sample
was then screened for artifacts. No cultural resources were observed along the modern ground
surface or within any of the 38 shovel test or 9 bucket augers excavated within the Permit ESA.
In general, shovel tests revealed approximately up to 3.3 ft (1.0 m) of very pale brown and light
yellowish-brown silty loam and fine sand. In some cases, however, loamy clay and compact
sand, often with increased limestone inclusions present, was encountered at deeper depths
(Appendix B).
Additionally, nine bucket augers were excavated along the Permit ESA to examine the potential
for deeply buried cultural deposits (see Figure 4). Specifically, soils within RCBA5 along the
western portion of the Permit Area exhibited the following soil profile: Stratum I (0-140 cm)
consisted of very pale brown (10YR 7/4) fine sand. Stratum II (140-165 cm) revealed a dark
yellowish-brown (10YR 4/4) fine sand. The bucket auger terminated with the presence of very
compact sandy soils with increased calcite inclusions as well as limestone gravel inclusions. The
soil profiles for all excavated bucket augers are presented in Appendix C.
Based on available NRCS (2017) soil data, the mapped A horizon in this location extends to a
depth of only 30.0 cm (12.0 in.) below surface in these areas. Several of the excavated shovel
tests indicated the presence of a shallow A horizon, however, the majority of shovel and bucket
auger tests indicate the presence of the B and C horizons present along the modern ground

surface. Additionally, there is no evidence of any dark, highly organic buried soils horizons
present within the any of shovel tests or bucket auger tests in excavated in this location. The
shovel test and bucket angering data coupled with the NRCS soils data suggests a decreased
potential for buried cultural components in this area.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Crestwood intends to construct a new 16.0 mi (25.7 km), 20-inch diameter natural gas pipeline to
be located in Loving and Reeves counties, Texas referred to as the ESR to ORLA HP Pipeline
Project. The majority of the Project will traverse private property and is not subject any state or
federal regulatory triggers. However, one segment totaling 0.48 mi (0.77 km) (designated as the
Permit Area) will cross property owned by Texas A&M, a political subdivision of the State of
Texas. The cultural resources survey was designed to inventory and assess cultural resources
across the entirety of the Permit Area. These efforts involved both surface and subsurface
archaeological survey conducted accordance with the Code and CTA/THC survey standards and
guidelines. The cultural resources investigations were conducted under TAC Permit No. 8264.
The remaining portions of this pipeline traverse private property and were not included in this
report.
Perennial conducted survey efforts within a broader ESA that totaled approximately 17.6 acres in
order to provide flexibility to Crestwood during workspace design. Actual Project impacts will
be restricted to a smaller workspace, the limits of which will be determined following
engineering analysis. Depths of impact associated with the actual APE are anticipated to range
from 3.0 to 6.0 ft (0.9 to 1.8 m). Jennifer Cochran served as the PI for the Project and Colene
Knaub and Rafael Cortez conducted the field efforts on December 22, 2017.
In all, a total of 38 shovel tests and 9 bucket auger tests were excavated across the Permit ESA.
Subsurface investigations tests revealed diverse soil textures such as fine sand, silty loam and
loamy clay. Auger testing was terminated upon reaching compact sand or the presence of
compact limestone inclusions at 110.0-175.0 cm (43.0-69.0 in.) below ground surface. No
evidence of any cultural resources was observed along the modern ground surface or within any
of the shovel tests or bucket augers excavated within the Permit ESA.
Based on the results of the survey effort, no intact, significant cultural resources will be affected
by any construction activities within the Permit Area. In accordance with the Code, Perennial
recommends no further cultural resources investigations within the 17.6-acre Permit ESA.
Should historic properties and/or human remains be encountered during construction, work in the
immediate area will cease and a qualified archaeologist will be called to evaluate the finding(s)
and provide recommendations for how to manage the resource under the State Historic
Preservation Plan. All findings will be reported to, and activities coordinated with the
Crestwood – ESR to Orla HP Pipeline Project

appropriate interested parties. In the event that human remains are encountered, all activity that
might disturb the remains shall cease, and may not resume until authorized by appropriate law
enforcement, and/or the THC.

Introduction
Crestwood Midstream Partners LP (Crestwood) is proposing to construct the ESR to Orla
Pipeline Project (Project), an approximate 22.5-mile- (mi-) (36.2 kilometer- [km-]) long pipeline,
in Loving and Reeves counties, Texas (Project) (Attachment 1). The proposed Project consists
of the installation of various diameter natural gas transmission mainline and gathering pipelines.
Ground disturbing activities associated with Project include clearing of existing vegetation,
grading, and excavation within a defined construction right-of-way (ROW).
While the majority of the Project will traverse private property, one segment totaling 0.48 mi
(0.77 km) will cross state-owned property (Attachments 2 and 3). The area of potential effect
(APE) associated with the Project across these properties measures approximately 17.4 acres
with depths of impact ranging from 4.0 to 6.0 feet (ft) (1.2 to 1.8 meters [m]) below ground
surface. As these properties, designated herein as the Permit Area, are owned by Texas A&M
University, cultural resources investigations across the Permit Area will be conducted to satisfy
the requirements of the Antiquities Code of Texas (Code). The following scope of work outlines
the proposed Phase I survey plan for the portion of the Project that traverses this Permit Area.
Environmental Setting
The Permit Area is located approximately 5.5 mi (8.8 km) east of Orla, Texas, and lies within the
floodplain of the Pecos River. According to aerial imagery and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
topographic maps, the state lands appear to be situated within an erosional setting with
disturbances present along the central portion of the Permit Area from a past oil and gas
activities. Topography across the Permit Area consists of rolling uplands with vegetation typical
of the Trans-Pecos ecoregion (TPWD 2017). Much of the landscape is dominated by desert
grassland, but many of the native grasses have been replaced by scrub vegetation as a result of
overgrazing. Based upon recent aerial imagery, surface ground visibility appears good to
excellent. Landscape alterations caused by prolific oil and gas development are prevalent across
much of this region.
Geologically, the Permit Area is underlain by Terrace Deposits (Qt) (USGS 2017). These
deposits consist of sand, silt, clay, and gravels with calcium carbonate (caliche) deposits in
terraces along streams. These deposits typically date to the Holocene age.
Two soil types are mapped within the Permit Area. The Harkey series consists of very deep,
well drained soils that formed in calcareous mixed alluvial sediments derived from sedimentary
material. These soils are found on floodplains and stream terraces with slopes of 0 to 3 percent.
The Patrole series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in
stratified silty over clayey alluvium. These soils are on nearly level flood plains with slopes
ranging from 0 to 1 percent. (NRCS 2017).

Cultural Resources Background Review Results
Perennial conducted a thorough cultural resources and environmental literature search of the
Permit Area. A Perennial archaeologist reviewed the Orla SE NW USGS 7.5-minute
topographic quadrangle maps and searched the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database and the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) database to identify previously recorded cultural resource sites, historic structures,
properties listed in the NRHP, designated historic districts State Antiquities Landmark (SAL)s
which could potentially be affected by the proposed undertaking. Any previously recorded
cultural resource site forms, reports of archaeological investigations, general historical
documents, and secondary sources concerning the background of the area were also reviewed.
The records search included a review of all previously recorded site forms, cemetery data, and
surveys on file within a 1.0-mi (1.6-km) review radius of the Permit Area.
Based upon the archival review, two previously recorded archeological sites or cemeteries are
mapped within 1.0-mi (1.6-km) of the Permit Area (Atlas 2017). Sites 41LV32 and 41LV33 are
mapped along the Project centerline approximately are located approximately 0.4 mi (0.6 km)
and 0.78 mi (1.25 km) east of the Permit Area, respectively. These sites consist of prehistoric
artifacts scatters observed primarily within surface contexts. Cultural materials consist of lithic
debitage, mano fragments, utilized flakes, and cores; however, no features or diagnostic
materials were present at the site (Atlas 2017). Investigations revealed the sites were in poor
condition from extensive erosional activities. As such, sites 41LV32 and 41LV33 were
determined as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.
Field Methods
The cultural resources survey will be performed by a team of two archaeologists. The field crew
will survey the entire 0.48 -mi (0.77-km) segment of the Project length located within the Permit
Area. In general, the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require
that a minimum of 16 shovel tests be excavated per 1.0 mi (1.6 km) for ROWs measuring up to
100.0 ft (30.0 m) in width (1 survey transect). The proposed survey corridor for the Permit Area
within the Project will measure approximately 300.0 ft (91.5 m) in width and will require three
evenly spaced survey transects in order to conform to TSMASS. Overall, the survey will cover
100 percent of the Project length for areas located across the Permit Area. An intensive
pedestrian survey will be conducted at survey intervals no greater than 91.5 ft (30.0 m) apart
along the width of the Permit Area. In areas where the ground visibility is less than 50 percent,
shovel tests will be excavated at 164.0 to 328.0-ft (50.0 to 100.0-m) intervals apart along the
length of the Permit Area. In areas where the surface visibility exceeds 50 percent, shovel
testing will be conducted intermittently along areas with increased probability to contain buried
cultural deposits, such as areas adjacent to drainages or within sand dunes. The number of
survey transects may be reduced in areas where the Permit Area overlaps with existing pipeline
4|Page

corridors or other industrial areas. Additional shovel tests may be excavated in portions of the
Permit Area with distinct landforms. In areas where landforms exhibit moderate-to-extensive
disturbances from natural or human-induced processes such as shallow surface plowing, land
clearing, and minor channelization, shovel tests may be excavated on a discretionary basis. Any
deviations from TSMASS will be thoroughly documented, and disturbances will be
photographed.
In general, shovel tests will measure approximately 12.0 in (30.0 cm) in diameter and will be
excavated by natural strata. Per the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA)/THC survey
standards, shovel tests will be excavated to a depth consistent with the project impacts or to the
base of Holocene deposits likely to contain cultural resources unless dense, impenetrable clay
soils or inundation prevent the continuation of excavations. All soil matrices will be screened
through 6.3-millimeter (¼-inch) mesh hardware cloth unless dominated by clay. Clayey matrix
will be trowel-sorted and visually inspected.
For each of the shovel tests, the following information will be recorded on shovel test logs:
location, maximum depth, and the number of soil strata. For each soil stratum, thickness,
texture, color, and the presence or absence and nature of cultural materials will be recorded.
Perennial will maintain a non-collection policy whereby all diagnostic artifacts will be photodocumented, while only representative samples of non-diagnostic materials will be photographed
by artifact class for each site. Field data will be collected on the spatial distribution of artifacts,
artifact concentrations, and densities of surface assemblages across all of the sites. Diagnostic
artifacts such as projectile points will be typed in the field to the best extent possible based on
defining characteristics, design, and a comparative analysis of comparable assemblages in the
region.
The field crew will record all shovel test locations, isolated finds, archaeological sites and
associated features using a handheld GPS device. Also, each archaeologist will be equipped with
a compass, shovel test and photographic logs, daily journal forms, and appropriate THC site
forms. The crew will be equipped with topographic maps and aerial photographs of the survey
corridor, a digital camera, and a cellular telephone to maintain contact with the home office
(terrain permitting).
If necessary, in addition to shovel testing, a hand-operated auger will be utilized in select locales
with deep alluvium or colluvium or known archaeological site deposits to probe for deeply
buried cultural materials below shovel testing capabilities (i.e, 3.3 ft [1.0 m]). If the auger
probes reveal that buried horizons or evidence of cultural materials are present at depths below
shovel testing capabilities, then additional work in the form of backhoe trenching would be
utilized to adequately assess these deposits. In practice, survey crews will flag any areas where
deep alluvial or colluvial sediments exists deeper than depths capable of being excavated with
5|Page

shovel testing efforts. Mechanical trenching of cultural resources sites or survey areas with deep
deposits present is not currently proposed for this phase of the project.
If deep, alluvial or
colluvial settings are identified during survey efforts, an additional mobilization to the Permit
Area will be necessary to evaluate these areas for the potential of deeply buried cultural deposits.
If an archaeological site is identified, the appropriate delineation techniques will be
systematically applied to identify the horizontal and vertical limits of each site’s boundary. Site
boundaries may be determined based on both surface artifact density and the presence or lack of
subsurface components. For subsurface sites, a series of shovel tests will be excavated radiating
in the four cardinal directions or, if more appropriate, along perceived major and minor
topographic and site axis. In practice, shovel tests within potential sites will be placed along
transects at 33.0-ft (10.0-m) intervals to determine the depth and potential integrity of cultural
deposits, and to carefully examine for the presence of intact archaeological features and/or
discrete episodes of occupation. In the absence of subsurface deposits, controlled pedestrian
surface inspections will be conducted and site boundaries defined based on a marked reduction in
surface artifact density. Shovel testing or pedestrian surveys will not be conducted beyond the
Texas A&M University property boundaries to ensure no trespassing onto private property
occurs.
Historic Structure Documentation
All historic-age structures (i.e., older than 50 years) located within the Permit Area will be
thoroughly documented during the survey efforts. Historic Standing Structure forms will be
completed for each resource. The historic structures will be adequately photo-documented,
sketch maps will be drawn, and each resource will be plotted with a GPS device. Shovel tests
may be excavated in the vicinity of the structures to determine if an associated subsurface
archaeological component is present. All data will be reviewed by a qualified architectural
historian to determine construction date, style, integrity, and overall significance and SAL
designation.
Reporting
Following the completion of the field surveys, Perennial will prepare a draft report of the
investigations. Data on any newly recorded sites will be submitted to the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) in order to receive trinomial data for reporting. The format of the
report will adhere to review guidelines suitable to the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO)
in accordance with the THC’s Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the
CTA Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. The report will document
previous investigations in the area, background cultural setting, the methodology used during the
investigations, the general nature and extent of cultural resources encountered during the cultural
resource survey, and management recommendations for any documented cultural resources per
all applicable state and federal laws. A complete draft report will be submitted to Crestwood for
6|Page

comments and review. Once the client approves the report, the draft report will be submitted to
the THC for review. Following the agency review period, any appropriate edits or comments
will be incorporated, and a final draft will be produced and distributed appropriately.
Laboratory Methods
Perennial will maintain a non-collection policy whereby all diagnostic artifacts will be photodocumented, while only representative samples of non-diagnostic materials will be photographed
by artifact class for each site. Field data will be collected on the spatial distribution of artifacts,
artifact concentrations, and densities of surface assemblages across all of the sites. Diagnostic
artifacts such as projectile points will be typed in the field to the best extent possible based on
defining characteristics, design, and a comparative analysis of comparable assemblages in the
region.
Perennial will prepare all materials recovered during the study and arrange for the transfer of
recovered materials and records to a suitable curatorial facility pursuant to the standards and
guidelines set forth by the THC/CTA. An additional ten copies will be distributed to various
designated repositories across the state in accordance with the TAC permit obligations.
Human Remains
In the event that human remains are encountered during any part of the Phase I survey effort,
work will stop immediately and the appropriate local law enforcement personnel and medical
examiner’s office will be notified of the discovery. Should the medical examiner determine that
the human remains are older than 50 years, then the State Archeologist will claim jurisdiction of
the discovery and will commence consultation with any concerned parties including landowners,
appropriate Tribes, and living descendants to ensure compliance with existing state laws. No
remains will be removed from the site until jurisdiction has been established and the appropriate
permits have been obtained. All activities will adhere to the Texas Health and Safety Code (8
THSC § 711.010) and the Texas Antiquities Code (13 TAC §§ 22.1-22.6). If the human remains
are determined to be Native American, they will be handled in accordance with the Native
American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA).
