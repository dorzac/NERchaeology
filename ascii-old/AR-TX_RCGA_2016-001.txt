Introduction

T

his document describes the results of Phase
I cultural resources survey of the proposed
Texas Eastern Polk County Emergency
Repair, in Polk County, Texas (Figures 1.1 and
1.2). Fieldwork for this project was completed
on October 11, 2017. Survey entailed examination of an area that measured 2.32 ha (5.74 ac) in
extent. This cultural resources investigation was
completed on behalf of Texas Eastern Transmission, LP by R. Christopher Goodwin & Associates, Inc.
This field effort was designed to identify and
to evaluate all historic properties, archeological
sites, cultural resources loci, standing structures,
and/or cemeteries that may be impacted adversely
by the proposed project. All work was performed
in accordance with the procedures outlined in the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as
amended; the Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act of 1974; and, Title 36 of the Code of
Federal Regulations, Parts 60-66 and 800, as appropriate. Guidance for reporting on Cultural Resources Investigations 18 CFR 380.12(f) and 36
CFR 800, Archeology and Historic Preservation:
The Secretary of the Interior’s Guidelines, and
with guidelines contained within the Texas Historical Commission’s Preservation Connection:
Texas’ Statewide Historic Preservation Plan. This
undertaking also was guided by survey protocols
promulgated by the Council of Texas Archeologists, the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory, the Antiquities Code of Texas, and the Texas
Historical Commission’s Rules of Practice and
Procedure for the Antiquities Code of Texas.

investigate and repair the pipeline within Kickapoo Creek. Option 2 proposes to replace the small
section of extant pipeline with an adjacent new
section of pipeline using a Horizontal Directional
Drill (HDD). In order to facilitate either of the
two construction options, a workspace measuring
610 m (2000 ft) in length and 38.1 m (125 ft) in
width and located along the eastern side of the extant pipeline corridor was examined for cultural
resources. The workspace covered an area that
extended for 305 m (1000 ft) on both the north
and south sides of Kickapoo Creek.
Summary of Results and Recommendations
Intensive pedestrian survey augmented by
the excavation of 11 shovel tests failed to identify
any cultural material or evidence of intact cultural
deposits within the limits of the proposed project
area. No cultural resources were identified as a
result of this investigation, and no additional testing of the Polk County Emergency Repair Project
area is recommended.

Previous Investigations, Research
Design, and Field Methodology

T

he following section describes the research design, field methodologies, and
background research used to complete
the Phase I cultural resources survey and archeological inventory of the proposed Texas Eastern
Emergency Repair Project in Polk County, Texas
(Figures 1.1 and 1.2). In addition, the procedures
to be utilized in the architectural recordation of
historic standing structures identified during survey and perceived to be at least 50 years of age
or older and within 50 m (164 ft) of the proposed
Area of Potential Effect, are presented. Finally,
this chapter provides the name and address of the
curation facility where all project notes and materials will be curated.

proposed project area was performed by PBS&J
(Cordova and Wagner 2007) for the Kinder Morgan Tejas Pipeline LLC in Polk County, Texas.
This survey resulted in the identification of one
new site, 41PK256, and an update to previously
identified site 41PK247. In addition, an attempt
to relocate previously identified site 41TN07
proved unsuccessful. Avoidance of impacts to
both sites 41PK247 and 41PK256 was recommended. These two sites lie beyond 1.6 km (1 mi)
of the currently proposed project area.
Site 41PK280 was identified approximately
300 m (984.2 ft) north of the current project area
(Figure 1.2). The site was identified between a
logging road and an extant pipeline corridor. The
artifact assemblage recorded within the site included chert debitage and a single sherd of sandtempered prehistoric ceramic. Site 41PK280
overlooks a small stream bed located near the
eastern bank of Kickapoo Creek. The site is of
unknown prehistoric origin and was recommended for additional testing to assess the NRHP eligibility of the site.

Previous Investigations
To ensure that all potential impacts to known
historic properties were addressed prior to investigating the project area, a review was undertaken
of those previously completed cultural resources
investigations, recorded archeological site locations, recorded historic standing structures, and
properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places situated within 1.6 km (1 mi) of the
currently proposed project area. This review was
conducted by R. Christopher Goodwin & Associates, Inc., of data currently on file with the Texas
Historical Commission.
Only one previously completed cultural resources survey and one previously recorded archeological site were identified within 1.6 km
(1.0 mi) of the proposed project area. No historic
standing structures or properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NHRP) were
identified as a result of this review.
The single cultural resources investigation
completed within 1.6 km (1.0 mi) of the currently

Stratification of the Areas of Potential Effect
Prior to initiating the field survey, the potential for identifying intact archeological deposits
within the Area of Potential Effect was assessed.
Traditionally, environmental factors such as elevation above the surrounding terrain, slope, accessibility to lithic resources, and proximity to
perennial water sources have been used to develop site predictive models. These models often are
used to stratify a particular project area into high
and low probability areas for containing archeological sites. The use of such analytical devices is
seen as a means of maximizing the efficiency of a
cultural resources survey. In theory, this approach

should result in the identification and recordation
of a greater number of archeological sites, since a
more intensive sampling strategy is employed in
those areas that exhibit the highest probabilities
for containing intact cultural deposits.

an architectural evaluation of any historic standing structures older than 50 years in age located
within or adjacent to the project area. These field
methodologies are described in more detail below.

Research Design
The current Phase I cultural resources survey and archeological inventory was designed to
obtain data pertaining to the nature and distribution of all cultural resources located within the
proposed project area. Fieldwork for this investigation was comprehensive in nature; planning
took into account the results of the single archeological survey previously completed within
the immediate project vicinity, as well as an assessment of the probabilities for identifying cultural resources within each survey item. Survey
included on-ground inspection of all portions of
the project item; field methodology included both
pedestrian survey and systematic shovel testing
throughout the proposed project area.
All fieldwork was conducted in accordance
with the procedures outlined in the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended; the
Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act of
1974; and Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 60-66 and 800, as appropriate. Additionally, this survey effort abided by the standards
set forth in Archeology and Historic Preservation:
The Secretary of the Interior’s Guidelines, and
with guidelines contained within Preservation
Connection: Texas’ Statewide Historic Preservation Plan. Information provided by the Council
of Texas Archeologists, the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory, the Antiquities Code
of Texas, and the Texas Historical Commission’s
Archeological Survey Standards for Texas and
Rules of Practice and Procedure for the Antiquities Code of Texas also was utilized.

Shovel Testing
Stratification of the proposed project area
was based on discussions held between the Project Manager and the Project Archeologist, as well
as on previously recorded site distributions and
settlement data gleaned from other archeological
surveys completed within the broader region, environmental factors such as elevation above the
surrounding terrain, slope, and proximity to, and
elevation above, perennial water sources. Since
the entirety of the of the Texas Eastern Polk
County Emergency Repair project area was considered to have a high probability for containing
archeological sites, shovel tests were excavated
at 50 m (164 ft) intervals along a single survey
transect. An additional judgmental shovel test
was excavated within the limits of the project
area.
Each survey shovel test measured approximately 30 cm (11.8 in) in diameter, and each
was excavated to a minimum depth of 50 cmbs
(19.7 inbs), to sterile clays, or until the influx of
ground water impeded the excavation process.
All shovel test fill was screened through 0.64 cm
(0.25 in) hardware cloth; extremely wet soils and
clays were hand-sifted, troweled, and examined
visually for cultural material. Each shovel test
was excavated in 10 cm (3.9 in) artificial levels
within natural strata and the fill from each level was screened separately. Munsell Soil Color
Charts were used to record soil color; soil texture
and other identifiable characteristics also were
recorded using standard soils nomenclature. All
shovel tests were backfilled immediately upon
completion of the archeological recordation process.
As a result of this investigation, 11 shovel
tests were excavated successfully throughout the
Texas Eastern Polk County Emergency Repair
project area (Appendix I). Only three shovel tests
could not be excavated since they either were located within areas disturbed by prior construction
work or were located directly within Kickapoo

Field Methodology
The field methods used to complete this investigation were designed to provide complete
and thorough coverage of the Area of Potential
Effect. This undertaking included pedestrian survey and systematic subsurface testing within the
limits of the proposed 2.32 ha (5.74 ac) project
area. In addition, this investigation also included

the entire project area. In addition, the survey
considered any historic standing structures that
were situated within 50 m (164 ft) of the proposed corridor boundaries. All architectural investigations were undertaken in accordance with
guidelines established in National Register Bulletin 24: Guidelines for Local Surveys: A Basis
for Preservation Planning (National Park Service
1995). No structures were located during the cultural resources survey.

Creek. No historic standing structures were identified as a result of the cultural resources survey
of the proposed project area.
Architectural Review and Standing Structures Recordation
Survey crews were instructed to record any
standing structures encountered during the Phase
I cultural resources survey and archeological inventory of the proposed project area that they
perceived to be at least 50 years or more of age.
Since the project has the potential to impact or
destroy historic properties, the purpose of this architectural recordation was to: (1) collect reconnaissance-level architectural survey data for each
building 50 years in age or older located within
or immediately adjacent to the proposed Areas of
Potential Effect; (2) apply the National Register
criteria to each recorded structure(s); and (3) apply the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation’s Criteria of Effect to each historic property.
The architectural survey was conducted within

total of three shovel tests could not be excavated
either because of the presence of highly disturbed
soils located adjacent to the creek or because the
proposed shovel test location actually fell directly within Kickapoo Creek.
A typical shovel test excavated within the
project item (Transect 1 Shovel Test 6 at 250 m
[820.21 ft]) contained only a single soil horizon
(Figure 3.2; Appendix I). Stratum I, a light gray
(10YR 7/2) sand, extended from the ground surface to a depth of 50 cm (19.7 in) below surface
(bs). No standing structures, artifacts, or features
were identified during the survey of Segment
JCL101117A.

he Phase I cultural resources survey of the
Texas Eastern Polk County Emergency
Repair Project area in Polk County, Texas
included the investigation of one linear workspace which totaled approximately 2.32 ha (5.74
ac) in extent (Figures 1.1, 1.2, and 3.1). Vegetation noted throughout the project area included
planted pines, mixed hardwoods, and light secondary growth species. Soils mapped in the vicinity of the project area consisted of Hatliff-PluckKian complex (0 to 1 per cent slopes) fine sandy
loams and Laska fine sandy loam (1 to 5 per cent
slopes) (NRCS 2017).
Segment JCL101117A
Segment JCL101117A measured 610 m
(2001 ft) in length and 38.1 m (125 ft) in width
(Figure 3.1). This area traversed a gently sloping
to moderately sloping landform positioned approximately 45.7 to 54.8 m (150 to 180 ft) above
mean sea level. Vegetation consisted mainly of
planted pine, mixed hardwoods, and light undergrowth species. The entirety of the project area
was tested at 50 m (164 ft) intervals along a single survey transect. A total of 10 of 13 planned
shovel tests and a single judgmental shovel test
were excavated within the project workspace. A

Summary and Management Recommendations
The Phase I cultural resources survey of the
proposed Texas Eastern Polk County Emergency
Repair Project area resulted in the examination
of a 2.32 ha (5.74 ac) project item. Pedestrian
survey augmented by the systematic excavation
of 11 shovel tests failed to produce any cultural
material or evidence of intact cultural deposits
within the project area. No additional investigation of the proposed Texas Eastern Polk County
Emergency Repair project area is recommended.
