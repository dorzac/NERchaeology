Management Summary
Archaeologists from Central Texas Archaeological Resources (CTAR), on behalf of the City of
Ballinger, Runnels County, Texas, conducted an intensive areal archaeological survey with deep
mechanical testing within the boundaries of a proposed Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP)
Expansion, located in Ballinger, Runnels County, Texas on August 24-25, 2014. The proposed
WWTP expansion was funded by a Texas Community Development Block Grant (TxCDBG)
and therefore, subject to the Antiquities Code of Texas. The city’s current treatment plant in
Ballinger was nearing it capacity and was required by the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality (TCEQ) to expand its capabilities in order to meet its future needs. The project design
would increase the overall size of the treatment plant, meeting the TCEQ mandate. The survey
area was on public property currently owned by the City of Ballinger, Texas.
The location of the proposed new retention ponds were the Area of Potential Effects (APE) for
the survey. The APE contained approximately 8.21 hectares (20.3 acres). All field work was
conducted in accordance with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and the Council of Texas
Archaeologists’ (CTA) survey standards as outlined in 13 TAC 26.5(35), 13 TAC 26.20(1), and
13 TAC 26,20(2). The archaeological survey was conducted by Principal Investigator, Katherine
Turner-Pearson, MA, RPA on August 24-25, 2014. A total of seven shovel tests were excavated
to depths of 42-60 centimeters below the surface (cmbs). Archaeologists placed five backhoe
trenches within the APE of approximately 6.5 meters (m) x 2.15 m in surface size and 2.0 m in
depth. No archaeological sites or cultural remains were revealed during the shovel tests or
mechanical testing; however, one archaeological site was discovered during the pedestrian
survey. The site, 41RN277, was a surface lithic scatter believed to be archaic in age. The site
was disturbed with no diagnostic artifacts, and did not meet the National Register of Historic
Places’ eligibility requirements. Archaeologists recommended that the project proceed as
planned.
Project and site documentation will be curated at the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) in Austin, Texas, and a copy of this report will be filed with the THC in Austin and the
CTAR offices in Woodway, Texas.

Introduction and Project Description
Archaeologists
from
Central
Texas
Archaeological Resources (CTAR), on
behalf of the City of Ballinger, Runnels
County, Texas, conducted an intensive areal
archaeological survey with deep mechanical
testing within the boundaries of a proposed
Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP)
Expansion, located in Ballinger, Runnels
County, Texas on August 24-25, 2014
(Figure 1). The proposed WWTP expansion
was funded by a Texas Community
Development Block Grant (TxCDBG) and
therefore, subject to the Antiquities Code of
Texas (see Attachment A). The city’s
current treatment plant in Ballinger was
nearing its capacity and was required by the
Texas Commission on Environmental

Quality (TCEQ) to expand its capabilities in
order to meet its future needs. The project
would increase the overall size of the
treatment plant in order to meet the TCEQ
mandate.
The City of Ballinger proposed the
construction of a new retention pond
adjacent to the original treatment plant
facilities in order to fulfill the TCEQ
requirements (Figure 2). The city proposed
the construction of one sewage treatment
pond utilizing approximately 5,000 tons of
rip-rap and the installation of approximately
365.76 linear meters (1,200 linear feet) of
piping, values, and all associated
appurtenances. The total area of potential
effects (APE) was 8.21 hectares (20.3 acres)
with the depth of impacts between 1.22

limestone, undifferentiated, which is part of
the Wichita group along with some beds of
Leonard age formations (Moore 1958).
The physiographic features within the
project area are terrace deposits of
Pleistocene and Holocene sands, Holocene
alluvium sand deposits, and Clear Fork
Group Permian mudstone and sandstone of
the Leonard soil series (U.S. Geological
Survey 2014).

Project Setting
Geology
The geologic formations of the project area
are Permian in age, with the main portion
Quaternary flood plain and terrace alluvium.
The other portion consists of Lueders

Topography and Drainage
The City of Ballinger is located in Runnels
County, immediately above the confluence
of the Colorado River and Elm Creek, with
the majority of the city nestled between the
two streams. The city of San Angelo is
located 58 kilometers (km) (36 miles)
southwest.
The project APE is located on the east side
of Elm Creek immediately above its
confluence with the Colorado River
(Figure 1).
Located in northwest Texas, Runnels
County is defined by the Colorado River and
2|Page

its tributaries. In the Ballinger area, the
main tributary is Elm Creek, with the
primary watershed the Colorado River. The
Colorado River flows southeast across the
lower third of Runnels County terminating
at the Concho River. The bottom lands of
the Colorado are generally steep, narrow
bluffs along the larger bends of the river,
with wide floodplain horizons opposite. The
relief on the north side of the Colorado
consists of a greater relief than the areas to
the south. The best geologic sections of the
Permian rocks found in the county are found
along the Colorado River bluffs (Beede and
Waite 1918).
The surface elevation at the site is
approximately 497 m (1631 ft.) above mean
sea level (amsl).
Soils
The soils in the project APE are
predominantly Spur loam, a loamy alluvium
of Holocene age, with a small amount of
Bukreek loam (1 to 3 percent slopes) and
Mereta clay loam (1 to 3 percent slopes)
along the far north and northeast portions
(National Cooperative Soil Survey 2003,
2013, 2013).
The Spur soil series consists of very deep,
well drained, moderately permeable soils.
They are nearly level to very gently sloping,
with slopes ranging from 0 to 2 percent.
They are formed in loamy alluvial sediments
on nearly level and gently sloping flood
plains in the Central Rolling Red Plains
(National Cooperative Soil Survey 2003). A
typical profile contains an A horizon from 0
to15 inches of brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay loam,
with a moderate medium granular structure

that is hard and friable with many fine roots
and many fine to medium pores. The A
horizon is followed by a Bk1 horizon from
15 to 38 inches of brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay
loam. It is of a moderate fine subangular
blocky and moderate fine granular structure.
This is followed by a Bk2 horizon 38 to 50
inches in depth. It is a brown (7.5YR 5/4)
clay loam, with a moderate fine subangular
blocky structure. Next is a Bk3 that is 50 to
60 inches deep. It is a light reddish brown
(5YR 6/4) clay loam, with a weak fine
subangular blocky structure (National
Cooperative Soil Survey 2003).
The Bukreek soil series consists of very
deep, well drained, moderately permeable
soils that formed in the loamy alluvium of
the Quaternary age. These soils occur on
very gently sloping terraces on dissected
plains. The slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.
Bukreek soils are fine-loamy, mixed,
superactive, thermic Typic Paleustolls and
are often cultivated. A typical horizon
contains an Ap horizon from 0 to 23 cm (0
to 9 in) of reddish brown (5YR 4/3) loam,
that is of a weak fine granular structure. The
A horizon is followed by a Bt1 from 23 to
41 cm (9 to 16 in) in depth of reddish brown
(5YR 4/3) sandy clay loam. Beneath the
Bt1 horizon is a Bt2 horizon from 41 to 81
cm (16 to 32 in) that is a reddish brown
(5YR 4/4) sandy clay loam. The Bt2 is
followed by a Bt3 from 81 to 122 cm (32 to
48 in) of yellowish red (5YR 5/6) sandy clay
loam that is of a moderate medium
subangular blocky structure. Below the Bt3
is a Btk1 from122 to 168 cm (48 to 66 in). It
is a red (2.5YR 5/6) sandy clay loam, that is
of a moderate coarse subangular blocky
structure. Next is a Btk2 horizon from168 to
3|Page

226 cm (66 to 89 in) of red (2.5YR 5/6)
loam. It is of a weak coarse subangular
blocky structure that is hard and friable.
The final horizon is a Btk3 from 226 to 259
cm (89 to 102 in) that is a red (2.5YR 5/6)
loam. It is of a weak coarse subangular
blocky structure that is hard and friable
(National Cooperative Soil Survey 2013).
The Mereta Soil Series consists of an Ap
horizon from 0 to 12 cm (0 to 5 in) of dark
grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam that is
of a weak fine granular structure. The Ap
horizon is followed by a Bw1 horizon from
12 to 28 cm (5 to 11 in) in depth. It is of a
moderate fine subangular blocky structure.
Next is a Bw2 horizon 28 to 48 cm (11 to 19
in) in depth of a brown (7.5YR 4/3) clay
loam that is a moderate fine subangular
blocky structure which is followed by a
Bkkm horizon 48 to 58 cm (19 to 23 in)in
depth. It is a pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2)
caliche that is strongly cemented and platy.
Next in depth is a BCkk horizon 58 to 102
cm (23 to 40 in) deep consisting of a pink
(7.5YR 8/4) loam, that is massive; soft, and
friable. The final horizon is a BCk horizon
from 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 in) in depth of
a light brown (7.5YR 6/4) clay loam, that is
massive, soft, and friable (National
Cooperative Soil Survey 2013).
Flora and Fauna
The average high in Ballinger is 77 degrees
Fahrenheit (F) and the average low is 52.1
degrees F, with an overall average
temperature of 64.9 degrees F. The average
precipitation is 61.09 cm (24.05 inches)
(U.S. Climate data 2014).

The county is located largely in the Rolling
Plains of North Central Texas, with its
southeastern portion in the Edwards Plateau
(Texas Parks and Wildlife 2014). This
positions it on the edge of Blair’s Kansan
and Balconian Biotic Provinces (Blair
1950).
Flora in the county includes Little bluestem
(warm season perennial), Texas wintergrass
(cool season perennial), crabgrass (warm
season annual), and rescuegrass (cool season
annual) grasses; forbs such as bluebonnets
(cool season annual), native sunflowers
(warm season annual), Engelmanndaisy
(cool season perennial), and Maximillian
sunflower (warm season perennial), and
trees that include cedar elm, Texas ash, post
oak, cottonwood, pecan, and willow.
Common shrubs are coralberry, skunkbush
sumac, elbowbush, and Mexican buckeye,
and grape, Carolina snailseed, white
honeysuckle, greenbriar, and poison ivy
vines (Texas Parks and Wildlife 2014).
Located in north central Texas are four big
game species that include White-tailed deer
(Odocoileus virginianus), Mule deer
(Odocoileus
hemionus),
Pronghorn
(Antilocapra americana), and Javelina
(Tayassu tajacu). Upland game includes
Bobwhites (Colinus virginianus), Scaled
Quail (Callipepla squamata), Rio Grande
Turkey (Meleagris gallapavo), Mourning
Doves (Zenaida macroura), White-winged
Doves (Zenadia asiatica), Squirrels (Sciurus
niger), and Rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus).
Furbearing Mammals include American
badger (Taxidea taxus), American beaver
(Castor canadensis), gray fox (Urocyon
cirereoargenteus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes),
4|Page

mink (Mustela vison), muskrat (Ondatra
zibethicus), nutria (Myocastor coypus),
Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana),
raccoon
(Procyon

ring-tail
(Bassariscus astutus), western spotted skunk
(Spilogale gracilis), eastern spotted skunk
(S. putorius), striped skunk (Mephitis
mephitis), and the common hog-nosed skunk
(Conepatus mesoleucus).
Other birds
include Pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) and
Migratory Upland Game Birds including
three species of Teal (blue-winged teal
[Anas discors], green-winged teal [A.
crecca], and cinnamon teal [A. cyanoptera],
Geese (white-fronted [Anser albifrons],
snow [Chen caerulescens], and Canada
geese [Branta Canadensis]), and Sandhill
Cranes (Grus canadensis) (Texas Parks and
Wildlife 2014).
Background Research
A review of the Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas (Texas Historical Commission 2014)
indicates one documented archaeological
site, one archaeological survey, and three
state historic properties located within 1,000
m of the project boundary, and are shown on
(Figure 4). Site 41RN194, located 410 m
southwest of the project along the banks of
Elm Creek is an archaic camp site. The site
was discovered in 1986 in connection with
the construction of the current Ballinger
waste water treatment facility, which makes
it especially significant to the current
project. The site report offers little
information other than it had one un-named
diagnostic artifact, burned rock, and
freshwater clam shells found within a linear
series of hearths that ran parallel to the
stream channel. According to the report, it

was not a series of burned rock middens.
The report also indicates that a large portion
of the site remains on private property
(Guffee 1986).
An aerial survey of the current Ballinger
WWTP
boundaries
was
conducted
immediately south of the current project
APE. While no date of the survey was
noted, it most likely occurred in 1986,
around the time of the discovery of site
41RN194. A TDHPT linear survey is also
located to the southwest of the project area
(Texas Historical Commission 2014).
The Lynn-Hathaway Building (Texas
Historical Landmark 3151) is located 200 m
west of the project at the corner of 8th and
Hutchins in downtown Ballinger.
The
German Methodist Church and First Fire
Station (Texas Historic Landmark 2174) is
located 870 m west of the project APE at
420 Strong Street, and the Colorado River
Ferry Crossing (Texas Historic Landmark
976) is located 1.07 kilometers (km) from
the project at the south end of 8th Street
(Texas Historical Commission 2014).
No known archaeological sites or surveys
are located within the proposed project
boundaries.
Research Design
Based on the findings presented above and
the initial recommendations from the THC,
CTAR recommended they conduct an
intensive areal pedestrian survey combined
with deep mechanical testing, within the
boundaries of the proposed WWTP project
APE. The survey would meet or exceed the
THC’s and the Council of Texas
5|Page

Figure 3. Known Archaeological Sites, Surveys, and Historical Markers within 1,000 Meters of the Project APE
(Texas Historical Commission 2014)

Archaeologists’ (CTA) guidelines for areal
surveys of between 11 and 100 acres, with a
minimum of five shovel tests within the
APE, combined with four to five backhoe
trenches due to the excessive depth of the
proposed impacts (the backhoe trenches
would replace five of the usually
recommended ten shovel tests). The exact
number and placement of the shovel tests
and backhoe trenches would be decided in
the field based on the environmental and

geological conditions encountered at the
time of the survey.
Additionally, all structures 50 years or older
within the project APE or along the APE
parameter
would
be
identified,
photographed, and included in the Final
Report of Investigations.
All the field work performed would meet or
exceed the minimum standards as identified
by the CTA and the THC and would comply
6|Page

with applicable standards as defined or
referenced in 13 TAC 26.20 and THC
policy.
If alternative methods were
necessary, the report would provide explicit,
plausible justification for deviation from
those standards. All shovel tests would be a
minimum of 30-x-30 cm in size, and would
extend to an adequate depth to examine the
stratigraphic sequence at each testing locale.
The shovel tests would not extend below
100 cm.
Each shovel test would be
excavated in 20-cm arbitrary levels, and all
soil would be screened through one-quarterinch mesh hardware cloth. All backhoe
trench excavations would be monitored by a
professional archaeologist. All backhoe
excavations would be examined by a
geoarchaeologist for cultural activity and
buried paleosols. All soil horizons would be
identified and recorded for inclusion into the
Final Report of Investigations.
It was determined that only diagnostic
artifacts discovered would be collected
during the survey, and any collected artifacts
would be temporarily housed during
curation at the CTAR laboratory in
Woodway, Texas and permanently housed at
the
Texas
Archeological
Research
Laboratory (TARL).
All archaeological fieldwork for the project
would
be
conducted
by
trained
archaeologists from CTAR who fulfilled the
CTA’s professional requirements for
archaeologists and the Secretary of the
Interior’s Professional Qualifications and
Standards for Historic Preservation Projects
(Department of the Interior, Archaeology
and Historic Preservation: Secretary of the
Interior’s Standards and Guidelines).

Fieldwork would be supervised by a
Registered Professional Archaeologist who
meets or exceeds the Secretary of the
Interior’s
Standards
for
Principal
Investigators. It was also stated that in the
event that human remains were encountered
during the survey, the THC, Public
Management, Inc., and the City of Ballinger
will be notified immediately, and all
investigations in the immediate area would
cease until written notice from the THC.

Field Methodology
The survey was conducted on August 24-25,
2014 by Principal Investigator Katherine
Turner-Pearson, MA, RPA. On the first day
of the survey she met with Steve Nixon, the
Operations Manager for the City of
Ballinger, who discussed the background of
the project area. According to Nixon, just
beyond the northeast portion of the project
APE and within the fenced area of the
WWTP, is the city’s previous landfill, which
is now a large grass covered hill. At the
bottom of the hill, and within the project
APE is a pond that was most likely created
as a borrow-pit during the covering of the
city dump and the subsequent construction
7|Page

of the surrounding road. The pond and the
adjacent low-lying area around it had been
greatly disturbed and thus were not included
in the current survey as any archaeological
sites located within these areas would most
likely be destroyed.
At the time of survey, portions of the project
APE were abnormally green with overgrown
grasses due to recent rains. However, these
areas were predominately in the previously
disturbed and low lying areas. The upper
and undisturbed areas bore thin patches of
native grasses and scrub trees with 80-90
percent ground visibility.

Exhibit 3. Excavation of Backhoe Trench by the City of
Ballinger

The undisturbed portion of the APE was
surveyed first, utilizing 60 meter (m)
transects due to the optimal visibility.
Shovel tests were placed in areas which
suggested a high probability of having a
buried site. One criterion for shovel testing
was locations of surface lithic debris in
order to determine if there was a shallowly
buried site that was washing out of the
slope. A total of seven shovel tests were
placed within the APE. The locations of the
shovel tests are shown on Figure 4. None of
the shovel tests uncovered any cultural

Exhibit 4. Backhoe Trench BT-4

remains or other indicators of buried
archaeological sites.
After the completion of the pedestrian
survey, a series of five backhoe trenches
were placed in the upper, undisturbed area
of the project APE to determine if there
were any deeply buried archaeological sites
(Figure 4). The soil in this area is slated to
be removed during the construction of the
new retention pond. The City of Ballinger
provided the backhoe and the operator for
the survey and Principal Investigator and
geoarchaeologist Katherine Turner-Pearson,
MA, RPA inspected the trenches and
recorded the soil horizons.
The five
backhoe trenches varied in size, but all were
approximately 6.5 m long, 2.15 m wide, and
2.0 m deep. Two of the backhoe trenches
were placed near, and just outside areas that
had surface debitage or artifacts, and all of
the trenches spanned the upper ridge of the
site which was deemed to have the greatest
potential for intact buried archaeological
sites.

Results of Investigations
During the pedestrian survey one new
archaeological site was discovered. The site
was a lithic scatter of unknown age located
along the downward slope of the high,
undisturbed area of the APE (Figure 5). The
artifacts observed included scrapers and
chert flakes with heavy patinas and desert
varnish. Subsequent shovel tests in the area
failed to produce any buried artifacts or
indications of cultural remains.
No
diagnostics were observed, and no artifacts
were collected. Due to the heavy patina and
desert varnish, the site was most likely
archaic or older in age. The site was given a
field number of Ballinger 8141 and later the
official trinomial of 41RN277.

Project APE
Shovel Tests
Backhoe Trenches

Seven shovel tests were placed within the
project APE. The shovel tests were a
minimum of 30-x-30 cm in width and 50-60
cm in depth. The shovel tests were
excavated in 10 cm arbitrary levels. Soils
within the shovel tests were sifted through
one quarter inch mesh hardware cloth and
sorted for cultural remains. The soil horizons
within the tests were observed for color and
type. No cultural remains or artifacts were
detected during the shovel testing, however
a buried A-Horizon was located in Shovel
Test-1 (ST-1) and Shovel Test 7 (ST-7). A
map of the locations of the shovel tests are
shown on Figure 4 and a summary of the
horizons from the tests are shown on
Table 1.
9|Page

Figure 5. Location of Lithic Scatter, Archaeological Site 41RN277

The backhoe trenches showed a complex
geomorphology of the two meandering
streams near the project APE. The alluvial
floodplain sediments included alluvial soils
of various ages (based on soil colors and
types), as well as deposits of both large and
small gravels, indicating high velocity flood
movements in the area in the past. The
horizons varied greatly among the backhoe
trenches indicating the streams cut through
older deposits, and rerouted the stream
channels numerous times throughout its
history. These movements make it hard to
predict the likelihood of deeply buried
archaeological sites or remains. While

neither buried cultural remains were
observed in either the shovel tests or the
backhoe trenches, it is still possible that
there are buried sites or cultural remains in
areas outside the testing. A buried AHorizon was located in Backhoe Trench 5
(BT-5), suggesting that the area in close
proximity to the backhoe trench may be a
good candidate for containing a buried
archaeological site, even though no site was
observed. A summary of the backhoe
trenches is shown on Table 2.

All buildings within and immediately
adjacent to the project APE were examined
for historic age and significance. No
historic age buildings were located within
the project APE, and none were located
immediately adjacent to the APE. A farm

adjoining the WWTP included a modern
manufactured home with metal outbuildings and barns of recent age.

project APE, however the cross is of a
modern construction, and not historic in age.
Appropriately named “The Cross,” it can be
seen for many miles around the City of
Ballinger.
Erected in 1993 by Jim and
Doris Studer, the landmark stands 100 ft. tall
and is tip to tip 70 ft. wide in its arms. The
visible portion weighs 50 tons and it has
another 100 tons of attached material buried
beneath it for balance. The Cross is open to
the public 24 hours a day and is lit at night.

Summary
Approximately 8.21 hectares (20.3 acres)
were surveyed, and seven shovel tests and
five backhoe trenches were excavated by
CTAR in preparation for the WWTP
improvements for the City of Ballinger in
Runnels County, Texas. All the shovel tests
and backhoe trench excavations were
negative. One surface archaeological site,
41RN277, was discovered during the
pedestrian portion of the survey, but no
diagnostic artifacts were observed and no
temporal date was indicated. However, the
amount of desert varnish and patina on the
artifacts suggests an Archaic age for the site.
No artifacts were collected.
One backhoe trench and two shovel tests
revealed buried paleosols, though no cultural
remains were found in association with
them. None of the buildings adjacent to the
project APE were of historic significance,
and a section of the APE was already
disturbed during the construction of the
original WWTP and city landfill.
Recommendations
During the pedestrian survey CTAR
identified one archaeological site, 41RN277.
The site was a lithic scatter along a
downward sloping ridge with evidence of
frequent run-off erosion. Based on the
desert varnish on the surface of the artifacts,

the site appears to have been exposed for a
very long time, and is no longer completely
in sitú. The site does not appear to offer any
significant research potential and is not
unique compared to other similar sites in the
county. It is the opinion of the Principal
Investigator that the site does not meet the
National Register of Historic Places’
eligibility requirements as set forth in 36
CFR 60.4 – Criteria of Eligibility, or that it
may merit designation as a State
Archeological Landmark, as outlined in 13
TAC 26.8, Criteria for Evaluating
Archeological Sites.
The results of the shovel tests and backhoe
trenches revealed buried paleosols, but no
cultural remains or archaeological sites;
therefore, it is recommended that the
WWTP project be allowed to proceed.
However, in the event that unanticipated
archaeological materials, historic or
prehistoric, are encountered during the
construction phase of the proposed project,
work in the immediate area must cease and
the THC notified of these findings. In the
event that human remains are encountered
at any time during the construction, all work
and activities in the area must cease, the
area protected, and the THC notified
immediately. The records from this survey
will be curated at the TARL and the THC in
Austin, Texas.
