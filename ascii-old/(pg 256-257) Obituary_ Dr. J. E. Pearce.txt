OBITUARY
Dr. J. E. Pearce, Head of the Department of Anthropology of the
University of Texas, died on October 22, 1938, at his home in
Austin, Texas.
Dr. Pearce at the time of his death was in his seventieth year. For
a great many years his was as a "voice crying in the wilderness"
for the establishment of a great State Museum. For this purpose
he carried on a constant fight against great odds.
For far too long it seemed that anti-science was intrenched, and
that truculent ignorance was in the saddle in Texas. But at last this
resistance to progress was overcome, and it was very largely due to
Dr. Pearceâ€™s efforts that Texas now has the beginnings of a very
creditable mutton at Texas University.
Dr. Pearce was the pioneer in scientific exploration of Texas
archeological sites, and in publication of the results of such investigations. His Texas archeological writings cover a period of from
1916 to 1938. Texas lost a valuable crusader for science in the
passing on of Dr. Pearce.
