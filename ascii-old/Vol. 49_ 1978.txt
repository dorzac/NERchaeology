The Tuck Carpenter Site
And Its Relation to Other Sites
Within the Titus Focus
ROBERT L.

TURNER, JR.

ABSTRACT
The Tuck Carpenter Site (41 CP 5) was excavated on weekends
between May, 1963, and October, 1967 by the author and R.W.
Welsh. It was located on the west side of Dry Creek, approximately
three miles east of Pittsburg in Camp County, Texas. The site was a
Titus Focus cemetery which contained 44 graves. Two graves contained two individuals each; 40 graves contained only one person.
The remaining two graves contained no traces of bone. However,
from the quantity and location of the burial offerings, they probably
contained only one person. The skeletal material ranged from nearcomplete preservation to a complete absence in the graves. Usually,
the skull and major leg bones were present, and pelvic fragments
and arm bones appeared less frequently.
An analysis of the artifacts from the graves indicates that the
graves were not all placed by the same people, but that early and
late components were present.
The relationship of the Carpenter site graves to other Titus
Focus sites and cemeteries is discussed.

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
Camp County in Northeast Texas is within the Coastal Plain.
This region is crossed by several sizable creeks which eventually
empty into Caddo Lake and then the Red River near Shreveport,
Louisiana.
Most of Camp County is traversed by small streams or
branches, which over the years have developed bottomlands or

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

flood plains bordered by upland or terraces 25 to 50 feet higher.
The extreme eastern part of the county is hilly with occasional outcroppings of iron ore.
Camp County is in the area usually referred to as the Piney
Woods of East Texas. The entire county is wooded except where
land has been cleared for agricultural purposes. The predominant
tree is the pine, and many varieties of oak and gum are present.
Trees producing nuts are the oak, chincapin, hickory, pecan, and
black walnut. Wild plum, muscadine, persimmon, and mayhaws
may be found, and in the spring dewberries and blackberries grow
in abundance.
The people of the Titus Focus were part of the Fulton Aspect of
the Neo-American period and would mainly be placed in the Caddo
IV time period (Davis 1970), the last prehistoric period. They were
an agricultural people and lived in permanent villages. These villages, as far as is known, were located on the terraces above the
flood plains.
It is the author’s observation that small midden areas are
located on the terrace along the streams. Each midden may
represent one or two houses, and the entire group of middens probably composes the village. This observation applies to the environs
of the Carpenter Site as well as others. Fig. 1 shows the relation of
several middens to the Carpenter cemetery.
The cemetery is located on a projection or spur which
protrudes into the flood plain of Dry Creek The elevation of the
cemetery is 300 feet above mean sea level which is between that of
the flood plain and the upland. The sandy soil rests upon a red clay
base at depths of one to eight feet.
During periods of regular rainfall, which excludes the summer
months and early fall, the ground is soft and may easily be dug.
This characteristic of the soil probably was one reason why it was
selected as a cemetery by these people.
The region, formerly occupied by the people now defined as
Titus Focus, has as its axis Cypress Creek which lies between the
Sulphur and Sabine Rivers. Fig. 2 is a map of this region which
locates known Titus Focus and other sites that have been excavated. A few excavated sites are located on the major creeks,
both to the north and south of Cypress as indicated.
The Titus Focus was defined by Suhm, et al. (1954: 189-195)
using information obtained from excavations of cemeteries
during the 1930’s.

During the 1930’s, field parties under the direction of J. E.
Pearce of the University of Texas excavated many cemeteries in
Northeast Texas. Field foremen who did the actual work were
A. T. Jackson, Walter R. Coldschmidt, Burleigh B. Cardner, and
A. M. Woolsey (Davis 1970: 30-32). Among those excavated were
the following Titus Focus cemeteries as noted in Fig. 2: the
Russell, Caldwell, A. P. Williams, W. A. Ford, H. R. Taylor, Cash,
Riley, Cason, Joe Justiss, Atkinson, Reese, Culpepper, Candy, and
Galt Sites. The Starrett cemetery was represented by purchased
collection of artifacts and was not excavated by the field parties. All these cemeteries were used by Suhm, et al. (1954) to
define the Titus Focus traits.
Suhm, et al. (1954) characterized the people of Titus Focus
as producers of large quantities of pottery which they placed in
the graves. Included in some of the graves were groups of arrow
points primarily of the Talco type. Bassett and Maud points were

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

TUCK CARPENTER SITE

minor types in some areas. The most common vessel types that
serve as markers for this Focus are Ripley Engraved, Harleton
Applique, Taylor Engraved, Wilder Engraved, and Bailey
Engraved.
Subsequent to the Handbook publication, (Suhm, et al. 1954)
additional excavations of Titus Focus and other sites in the
Cypress Creek basin were conducted by professional archeologists. The specific area was in the Ferrell’s Bridge Reservoir
or Lake O’ the Pines which was then under construction.
The surveys and excavations which were carried out during
the late 1950’s were under the auspices of the River Basin
Surveys office located in Austin. This office was initially under
the Smithsonian Institution and later under the National Park
Service. Titus-related sites that were excavated are: The Dalton
Site (Davis and Gipson 1960), the Harroun Site (Jelks and Tunnell
1959), the Whelan Site (Davis 1958), and the McKinney Site
(Davis and Golden 1960). In addition to these, the Roberts Site in
Camp County was surveyed, and very brief excavations by Jelks
and Tunne!l were conducted. No formal report was submitted on
the Roberts Site. The locations of these sites are also noted in
Fig. 2.
Based on the findings at four of these sites (those above
except McKinney), E. Mort Davis (Davis 1970: 47-50; also Davis
1958) defined the Whelan Complex which he equates in time
with the Bossier Focus of the Fulton Aspect of the Caddo III time
period. Characteristics of the Whelan Complex which differ from
Titus Focus, as previously defined, are: (1) mounds built over the
burned remains of circular structures which show no signs of
having been lived in; (2) the presence of significant quantities of
Pease Brushed Incised sherds (a type characteristic of Bossier
Focus and absent in Titus as previously defined). Davis concluded that the Whelan Complex was ancestral to the Titus
Focus. Radiocarbon dates from Whelan Complex sites indicate a
principal overlap of 1450 A.D. to 1550 A.D. or possibly 1650 A.D.
(Davis 1970: 48).
Of the five Caddo Periods, Caddo I and II encompass the
Gibson Aspect, and III through V encompass the Fulton. The five
periods were first proposed by Webb (in Davis 1961) to better
differentiate the actual periods in the Caddoan sequence. This
period arrangement was again introduced by E. M. Davis at the
Eleventh Caddoan Conference in 1968.

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

It is emphasized that the various Caddo periods and the
Gibson and Fulton foci do not necessarily begin and end with the
turns of the centuries. As an example, recent samples from the
Davis Site (reported by Story at the Thirteenth Caddoan Conference) provided radiocarbon dates which extended from the
eighth into the thirteenth centuries.
During the late 1950’s, the same time period that Davis,
Jelks, Tunnell, Golden, and Gipson were working in the Lake O’
the Pines reservoir, several Titus Focus cemeteries were excavated, or partially excavated, by the late Ed German of Lone
Star, Ralph Nicholas of Daingerfield, and the author, formerly of
Pittsburg. These sites were: B. J. Horton, Guest, Chasteen, Alex
Justiss, Keith, and Harold Williams, which are also shown in Fig.
2. The Keeling Site was excavated by Mr. and Mrs. Roy Keeling
of Upshur County. The Rumsey Site is represented only by a
collection of artifacts, as is the Ellison Lake (Lone Star Lake)
Site. The Johns Site was excavated primarily by Tommy Johns
(formerly of Pittsburg, Texas) with the assistance of the author.
Although many Titus Focus cemeteries have been excavated,
only one report with general distribution has been published
about this specific type of site in northeast Texas (Scurlock,
1962: 285-316). As there is undoubtedly an end to these
cemeteries, it is the intent of the author that a major cemetery of
the Titus Focus people be reported. This paper is written to
fulfill that purpose.

BURIAL ARRANGEMENT
Fig. 3 is a map of the cemetery which shows the relation of
the graves with each other. The cemetery was arranged in
rather loose north-south rows. No pattern in the location of male
or female graves is apparent. That is, they seem to be intermingled.
Some of the graves shown in Fig. 3 have the skeleton and
grave offerings sketched in, while other graves are shown in
outline form only. This does not indicate any particular differences between graves. The areas outlined with dashed lines in
the figure represent excavations by an unknown person or
persons. The two holes just south of Grave 42 may represent
graves. Whether graves were actually found is not known. The

TUCK CARPENTER SITE

author does not believe the excavations shown in the top, righthand side of the figure uncovered any burials.
The small rectangle marked "28" in Fig. 3 does not
represent a grave, but the location of a single vessel. A concentration of sherds was found at a depth of 19 inches from the
surface. The sherds formed about three quarters of a nine-inch
diameter compound bowl. About a foot to the east of the pot was
one flint flake, a small fragment of burned bone, and several
small, ferruginous sandstone rocks. The broken pot shows use as
a cooking vesse!, which is unusual for this form of pot. The
burned bone fragment, flake, and sandstone rocks may not
represent purposely placed objects, but accidental groupings of
objects which occurred when the hole was filled. The
significance of the burial of this broken and incomplete vessel is
unknown. Fig. 4 and 5 are photographs of the site and of
selected graves.
Figs. 6-9 are examples of drawings made of each grave. At
the top of each figure is a plan view, or view looking down into
the burial. At the bottom of each figure is a side view, which
shows the depth from the present ground surface to the skeleton
and each artifact. The scale which shows depth is applicable to
all distances and dimensions in both the plan and side views of
each figure.
Various artistic liberties have been taken to provide a
clearer picture for the reader. First, the outline of the grave (in
both views) is shown outside and below the artifacts and
skeleton. Actually, the skeleton and many of the artifacts were
resting on the floor of the grave. Also, in the plan view, vessels
on the sides and ends of the grave were usua!ly against the
walls. Generally, the grave was no longer than necessary to
accommodate the skeleton and artifacts shown.
Numbers are assigned to each pot as seen in the plan view.
Letters are assigned to other types of artifacts, groups of artifacts, or special features.
The position of each vessel or artifact in the plan view
shown in Figs. 6-9 should be correct to within an inch or so. Side
view sketches are not as precise. To establish the relative
positions between the artifacts and the skeleton in each grave,
triangulation was employed. Two stakes were placed at the
surface beside the grave in an east-west line by compass
heading and at a measured distance apart, usually five feet.

TUCK CARPENTER SITE

Using a steel tape and plumb line, the horizontal distance of
each artifact from each stake was measured and recorded. The
field notes for each grave included a sketch that noted the
position on each artifact where the measurements were made,
i.e., center of base, junction of neck and body, etc. In addition,
the depth from the surface to the uppermost portion of each
artifact was recorded. The inclination of each vessel with
respect to the vertical and its direction of tilt were estimated,
sketched, and recorded. Based on the field sketch, notes,
measurements, and the artifacts after reconstruction, the grave
drawings were completed.
The sketches show the vessels as unbroken, except for
instances when incomplete vessels were placed in the graves.
Actually, about 55% of the vessels were broken to some degree.
This occurred most often when the grave floor was on, or into,
the clay. The clay provided no cushion, but rather a fixed
platform against which the vessels were crushed by the grave
fill. When sand extended below the grave floor, vessel breakage
was minimal. It is the author’s opinion, based on the above
observation, that the broken vessels were a result of crushing
and not of deliberate breaking or "killing."
The direction of each skeleton with respect to west is indicated beside the plan view of each grave drawing. The cardinal points, north and west, are true and not magnetic compass
headings.
In each grave the approximate quantity of skeletal material
that was found is shown in the drawing. The amount varied from
none, as in Grave 1, to almost complete preservation, as in Grave
18.

EARLY AND LATE COMPONENT GRAVES
An analysis of the artifacts from the cemetery indicates the
graves were placed at two different time periods. Thirty-five of
the graves are assigned to the early component or period, nine to
the latter. The late component graves are numbered 1, 3, 10, 19,
31, 32, 33, 34 and 36.
The major difference between the graves of the two components, which will be apparent to the reader after inspection of
the grave drawings, is the presence in the late component graves
of a distinctive decorative motif on many of the Ripley Engraved

lO

carinated bowls. This motif, which is widespread in the Titus
Focus, is characterized by small pendant triangles attached just
below the lip and similarly sized upright triangles at the
shoulder of the bowl. Four panels encircle the rim. Fig. 12 (a-c}
depicts typical bowls of this variety.
In addition to the vessels with the pendant triangle motif,
seven of the nine graves contained Talco arrow points. Only two
of the 35 graves assigned to the early component contained these
points. The two late component graves which did not contain
Talco points contained Maud points. Thus, all late component
graves had triangular arrow points as offerings.
A third distinguishing feature of the late component graves
is their location within the cemetery. All were on the outer
fringes which indicates their later arrival on the scene.
Five additional graves contained triangular arrow points but
did not include bowls with the pendant triangle motif. Graves 20
and 25 contained Talco points and graves 2, 23, and 44 Maud
specimens. Like the late component graves four of these five
were located on the outer edges of the cemetery. The one exception was number 23 which had one other grave between it
and the outside edge.
These five graves show a closer relationship to the late
component graves than do the others at the site. They are
related through the triangular point forms and through their
peripheral position within the cemetery.
The arrow points, from the interior graves which contained
points, were of the stemmed varieties, Bassett and Perdiz. These
graves and those among them which did not contain points were
the oldest graves at the site. Bassett and a very few Perdiz
points were also in some of the late component graves along with
the triangular point types.
In many of the early component graves, a major percent of
carinated bowls featured a triangular motif. In this design one to
three vertical lines extend from the shoulder to the lip at the end
of each design unit. A diagonal line connects one group of
vertical lines to the next. The triangular space above and below
the diagonal is filled with a smaller triangle that usually contains a semicircle or other simple shape set off by engraved
bands or excised areas. This design repeats four to eight times
around the rim. Fig. 12 (h, k, and m) pictures this motif. This, too,

TUCK CARPENTER SITE

11

may be classified as Ripley Engraved, but a motif that preceded
the pendant triangle in time.
Eight of the nine late component graves contained bottles of
Wilder Engraved. The ninth, Grave 3, contained a small bottle
with a simple untyped design. None of the late graves contained
the classic Ripley Engraved bottles of the first component. It
appears that at this site, the Wilder Engraved bottle design
survived from the earlier component to the late component, but
the classic Ripley Engraved bottle design did not.

CEMETERY LOCATION
The graves were located in a midden established by the
earlier component people, or at the same time the area was
occupied by them. This conclusion is based on the fact that
debris, typical of a midden area, was found both on the surface
and in the grave fill.
Artifacts from both locations included: bottle sherds of
Ripley, Wilder, and unidentified types; engraved, incised,
brushed, appliqued, red slip, plain, and base fragments from
other vessel types. In addition, flakes and chips, a few bone fragments, and small pieces of petrified wood were both in the grave
fill and on the surface. Two celt fragments were found in the
fills. Several ferruginous sandstone fragments, broken from
larger pieces such as metates or other tools, were also in the
grave fills. However, none were found on the surface.
Ripley Engraved bottle sherds from the same bottle were
found in the fill of Graves 12 and 13. No sherds from either the
surface or grave fills were of the pendant triangle type which is
a marker type of the late component graves.
In modern times the cemetery site had been cultivated
although at the time of excavation, the land was in pasture. As a
consequence, the surface had been disturbed by the deep
plowing. Therefore, no fire pits or other features were found.
In many cases the grave fill was difficult to distinguish from
the undisturbed sandy soil. If the grave was dug into the clay,
red clay fragments would be mixed with the sand of the fill
which, of course, helped in defining the grave shape. Even when
clay was mixed, it was usually much more evident in the lower
part of the grave. This would indicate that the last dirt removed

12

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

when the grave was originally dug was the first returned when
it was filled.
In graves which had not penetrated the clay, small flecks of
charcoal, along with the midden debris, were the only indications of a grave. The charcoal flecks most likely came from
the midden surface, as did the sherds, and became mixed with
the dirt when the grave was filled.

GRAVE DESCRIPTIONS
In the descriptions of the graves and their contents that
follow, the number that appears beside each vessel is its
identifying number that corresponds to the number in that
particular grave’s plan view. Letters are assigned to other types
of artifacts, groups of artifacts, and special features. They
correspond, in a like manner, to those objects lettered in the
same plan view.

Remarks:
Noteworthy features of this grave are: the placement of the rock
between the teeth, the presence of the beamers, and the gouge in
association with the beamers.
Beamers have been reported from the Clark Site near Waco by
Watt (1965), the Pecan Springs Site near Ennis by Sorrow (1966),
and from the Sanders Site on Red River by Krieger (1946). These
locations are closer to the Carpenter Site than any other sites
where beamers have been reported.

C, 25 arrow points: 10 Talco with eared base; one Maud

untyped point of grey flint. Four stemmed points near
Vessel 11 did not have a consistent orientation, nor did
the eight points by the right knee. One point by the right
ankle was disturbed, and its direction was not noted.
However, the remaining points were oriented as shown,
indicating former attachment to arrow shafts. A single
point was located in the pelvic area.
Remarks:
The cache at ’A’ included three items which indicated this cache
may include an arrow point-making kit. These items are the deer
ulna fragments, the flakes, and the petrified wood piece.
Artifacts from a grave cache at the Alex lustiss Site which probably included such a kit were the following:
’/2 lb. hematite stone, scraped all over, apparently to manufacture red paint;
10 deer ulnae;
15 pieces petrified wood, 1-4 in. long;
10-20 flakes;
2 dart points (nondesciript, may represent an additional flint
supply);
6 small Talco points;
2-8" long bones, ’/2" in diameter (probably deer);
5/8" length of tooth enamel (beaver?).
Artifacts pictured in Fundaburk and Foreman (1957: P1. 66) and

described as a Caddo flint working kit contained:
2 arrow points;
9 bone points;
16 antler tines;
10 ulnae;
2 bone pins;
1 twisted bone;
1 beaver tooth;
1 novaculite chip;
3 jasper pebbles.
Grave 19 was that of an important person as indicated by its
depth and the quantity of grave offerings. It was probably that of a
male. The large blade of the cache is an unusual artifact for a
Titus Focus grave. The only similar artifacts known to the author
from a Titus Focus cemetery were from the Gait Site. Grave 2 of
the Gait cemetery yielded two large ceremonial blades, both in
excess of 14" in length. The blade from Grave 19 is off-white in
color, resulting from a uniform layer of patination. A small flake
shows a grey color beneath its outer layer. The darker color probably represents the original coloration of the flint.

Remarks:
This grave is particularly unusual because it was a double
burial; that is, two individuals were buried simultaneously in the
same grave. The individual to the north was probably male and the
other, female. Grave 23 was also a double burial, Of 391 Titus
Focus graves from 32 different sites, the only other double burial
was Grave X-8 at the Ford Site.
Of the 17 vessels in Grave 21, four seemed to be associated with
the skeleton to the north and the remaining 13 with the one to the
south. All arrow points were associated with the northern
skeleton.
Vessel g3 contained a number of bone fragments about the size
of those that would come from a deer though they are not
positively identified as such. In order to get the drawing on the
page, both Vessels #1 and #17 were moved inward nine inches.
True distance across the grave to encompass these vessels would
be about 101/2 feet. Vessel #15 was inside vessel #2 as shown. The
grave floor was dug into the clay about 6 inches.

Remarks:
This grave was the second doable burial at the Carpenter Site.
The grave was dug very slightly into the clay. Extremely few bone
pieces remained. The skulls were crushed against the clay floor.
Arrow points were associated with both skeletons. Point groups D,
E, and G were aligned as if they had formerly been attached to
arrow shafts. Group F was not.
Vessel 9 is quite similar to bottles described by Skinner, et al.
(1969; 42 and 44) which were found in the shaft and multiple
burials at the Sam Kaufman Site (McCurtain Focus component) in
Red River County. Six of the seven bottles described were polished
red-slipped vessels with the marks of the polishing stone still
remaining. One vessel was not red-slipped. Five of the vessels were
decorated at the base of the neck with a distinctive four point
diamond applique. The Kaufman bottles were quite large. The
mean diameter and height were 27 and 33 cm., respectively. Their
paste contained shell temper and a gray core. Vessel 9 is not as
large as the Kaufman vessels nor does it contain shell temper. It
does have the gray core, smoothing-stone marks, a red slip, and a
diamond applique about the neck. The Carpenter vessel does have
a slight shoulder where the neck intersects the body that is not on
the Kaufman bottles. The applique found on both the Kaufman and
Carpenter bottles is a raised, smooth area above the body contour.
The Kaufman bottle type described above, as well as a deep
carinated bowl type with red slip, incurring rim, and slightly
scalloped lip were not given a type name in the Kaufman report.
Skinner has since designated this type as Avery Red. Vessel 9 of
Grave 23 is identified as this type.

D, Cache--A small jar, Vessel 3, contained green pigment
and was resting on tan potter’s clay beside lumps of
kaolin. Along with the clay was a piece of petrified
wood, a mussel valve, and a ferruginous sandstone
smoothing stone, polished on the convex portion. One
human tooth was close to Vessel 3. The human mandible
fragment was close by at A. Two extremely worn molars
were in the mandible. Whether the mandible, skull, and
pelvic fragments were accidental and mixed with the fill
dirt or purposely placed is impossible to ascertain. If an
earlier grave was disturbed when this one was dug, then
a few bones located between the skull and pelvis
probably would have been present in the fill dirt. Also,
the close grouping of the skull and pelvic fragment tend
to point to a placement, rather than to accident.
E, Deer mandible inside Vessel 1 near base;
F, Conch columella bead found in dirt stuck to skull after
removal from grave.
Remarks:
The effigy vessel, Fig. 29, is a unique form at the Carpenter Site
and in other Titus Focus sites as well. The vessel is hollow within
the head region; the wall thickness is no greater there than in the
bowl proper. Two suspension holes are on opposite sides of the
opening. Engraving consists of a single line around the opening,
three horizontally oriented, crosshatched diamonds on each side,
and hook elements similar to that of Wilder Engraved on the upper
surface of the tail.
The only similar vessel to this, known to the author, is pictured
in the Handbook of Texas Archeology (Subm, et el. 1954: 279). The
vessel described seems to represent a frog. Similarities between
the two vessels are the hollow head, two nodes which may
represent eyes, crosshatching of design elements (though the
elements are different), suspension holes similarly placed, and over
all similarity of form. The vessel pictured in the Handbook has the
tail missing; but from the break, it can be determined that it also
had a very broad tail. The Handbook vessel was found in Red
River County and was described as belonging to either the
Texarkana or McCurtain Focus.
Vessel 14 probably represents a human head in very abstract
form. The nose has nostrils clearly indicated. A small engraved
line in the expected position probably represents the mouth. No
eyes are apparent other than the two nodes.
Because of the similarity of the vessels, it is probable that Vessel
14 is a trade piece from McCurtain or Texarkana Focus people.
Grave 29, probably female.

F, Vessel 10 fragment was filled to the rim with the local

Remarks:
This grave was dug into the clay an average depth of about 18
inches. Because of the clay floor, most vessels were badly crushed.
The burned area beneath the upper body probably was the result

The cache at position "A" was beside the grave, not in the fill.
This may have been an additional offering or may have had no

The grave floor was slanted downward approximately parallel
to the surface. The head was the lowest skeletal part. Vessels 3, 4,
and 5 were at higher elevations than the skeleton. This might mean
they were placed in the grave after filling had started. Or, it could
have represented their placement on a shelf in the side of the
grave which collapsed inward as settling occurred.

This grave was against a sand-clay layer but into it slightly at
the foot of the grave. Four teeth from the skull were spread over
six inches, This probably resulted from a normal disintegration
and collapsing of the facial structure. The most unusual feature of
Grave 33 is the stemmed vessel, Vessel 9, which will be discussed

Remarks:
The grave floor was in the clay one or two inches. An extremely
unusual feature of this grave was the position of the two Talco
points at the skull, One is resting at about the position of the right
eye, and the other appears to be protruding, point first, from the
left side of the skull. On the side of the cranium opposite the
protruding point is a hole which could have been caused by the
penetration of an arrow. However, since the bone had disintegrated at both point locations, there is no absolute evidence that
this actually occurred.
The two points are at a higher elevation than the skull. Both
were pointing downward at an angle, as was the point near the
left knee. The over all impression was that after the body was
placed in the grave, arrows were shot at or near it. If such were
the case, the two points would probably have been shot after the

than the body.

Remarks:
This grave was unusual because of the depression in the grave
floor in which the legs and three vessels were located. This might
have resulted when those digging the grave decided they had gone
too deep, so did not dig as deeply on the other end. On the other
hand, there might have been some unknown significance to the
arrangement.
The wooden ear ornaments are extremely unusual, No other
wooden artifacts were found in any of the Carpenter Site graves.
And, this is the only occurrence of artifacts of this type in the
Titus Focus so far as the author knows.

Remarks:
Several vessels in this grave are different in style and
decorative technique from most others at the site. For example,
compound Vessels 1, 2, and 10 are not turned as radically at the
shoulder as most other vessels of this type. The design on Vessel 1
features crosshatching and ladder-like elements in semicircular
form, which are similar to Avery Engraved. The triangular motif
on Vessels 2 and 10 are similar in concept to others at the site.
This may simply represent one potter’s slight deviation from the
norm.
Vessels 2 and 11 were higher than the grave floor. These vessels
may have been on a platform or shelf at the end of the grave.
However, no positive variation in the soil composition was
determined. The alternative, of course, would he that these were
placed in the grave after filling had started.
The only skeletal remains were teeth fragments.

Remarks:

except for a slight trace at the ankle position. The grave was
completely in sand.

THE GRAVE DIRECTIONS
All burials at this site in which skeletal material was found
indicated that the person was buried in an extended supine
position, usually with arms parallel to the sides. Sometimes the
elbows were bent, or the leg bones were somewhat askew. In all
cases the head was to the east, and the feet pointed westerly.
An inspection of the burial drawings will show this arrangement.
It occurred to the excavators that as the graves in this site
were all with feet pointing westward, but not exactly so, that
perhaps the position of the sun at sunset was the guide used in
fixing direction. To explore this possibility the direction at which
the sun sets at this site (33° N latitude) during the year was
calculated. The results of this calculation show that on the first
day of summer the sun would set at approximately 281/3° north
of due west and that on the first day of winter it would set at
281A° south of due west. At the fall and spring equinox the sun

5O

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

would set due west. The variation of direction with time at
which it sets, between these dates, will be that of a sine curve.
This variation with the time of year is shown in Fig. 13. Also
shown on this chart are the mean first and last calendar dates
of freezing and subfreezing weather in this area of Texas. The
numbered circles in this figure represent the number assigned to
particular graves and are located on the angle scale at the angle
the particular burial points.
Inspection of this figure shows that most burial directions
are at angles which are south of due west. If it is assumed
correctly that the burials were in fact made with feet toward the
setting sun, then this would indicate that 80% of the burials
occurred between September 21 and March 21, the autumnal
and spring equinoxes. Therefore, it should be possible to arrive
at a good guess as to what month of the year the persons may
have died.
As an example, Burial 6. shown in Fig. 13, has a direction of
15° south of west. If a line is drawn horizontally until it intersects the curve it would intersect twice, which would indicate
the individual may have died in either October or February. It is
readily apparent that there is no way of knowing which of these
two months is the correct one. However, it is probable that more
died in February than in October. Reasons for this would be
depletion of the stored food supply, the miserable weather (note
the temperature scales on the figure}, and more difficulty in
hunting and food gathering. October, on the other hand, usually
provides excellent weather with a large quantity of forest
products and a mean temperature of 66° F. In general, it is a
time of harvest and well-being. Usually, the fall weather from
mid-September to some time in November is mild. The bad,
uncomfortable, wet, cold period extends into March. Though
there is usually snow or sleet several times during the course of
a winter, snow would be a relatively small problem as the
average snow cover is only eight days. Recent weather conditions in this area are summarized by Blood (1960).
Fig. 14 shows in bar chart form the grave directions at the
Carpenter Site compared with those of the Johns Site, another

various angular increments as indicated, i.e. 0°-10% inclusive,
for example. The time periods when the sun sets at or between
the indicated angles is also show. The height of the bar indicates

the percent of graves which were oriented at or between the
ir~dicated angles.
Inspection of the figure shows the similarity of the grave
directions between the two sites. This similarity would be expected if the people died at the same time of year and the
position of the sun was the determining factor in grave alignment.
The east-west orientation of the Carpenter Site graves is not
unique in the Titus Focus. In fact this should be regarded as a
major diagnostic trait of the Titus Focus in northeast Texas.
All graves (from all northeast Texas Titus Focus cemeteries
listed in this report for which the grave directions are recorded)
were generally east-west oriented with head to the east and feet
to the west. However, no records concerning the grave direction
are available for Rumsey, Chasteen, Starrett, Keith (except for
one which was with feet to west) Keeling, and Ellison Lake.
In several of the sites excavated during the 1930’s, the
burial direction was noted as due east, north east, or south
east--a general direction rather than an exact one.
In only two sites, the A.P. Williams and the Taylor
cemeteries, were more graves oriented with feet north of west
than south of west.
Titus Related Sites, Toledo Bend Reservoir Area

The Bison "B" (Woodall 1969) and Salt Lick Sites (McClurkan et al. 1966) located in the Toledo Bend Reservoir yielded
both extended and flexed burials. The grave direction of the
extended burials was predominately with feet to northeast and
north, not westerly as in northeast Texas. The relation of these
sites to Titus Focus will be discussed in more detail in later
sections of this paper.
Allen and Frankston Foci

The east-west grave orientation is also probably a trait of
the Allen Focus (historic) and Frankston Focus (prehistoric focus
from which Alien derived).
Written records of burial customs of the Hasinai are
available from reports of the Spanish missionaries (Griffith 1954:
94-96). The Hasinai, who are identified archeologically as the
Allen Focus (Suhm, et al. 1954: 218-221) were located ap-

proximately 70 to 80 miles south of the northeast Texas Titus
Focus area.
Espinosa who entered the Hasinai country in 1715 was a
major chronicler. Espinosa (Swanton 1942: 204) had this to say
about burials and beliefs concerning the soul:
These Indians understand well and confess a belief in the immortality of the soul. This is evidenced by the burials and funeral
honors they pay as follows. They prepare the dead body for burial.
after first bathing it, by clothing it in the best clothes they have or in
fresh deer skins. With great lamentations, they keep it for several
hours in the home. They provide great quantities of pinole, corn and
other eatables. If it be a man, they collect his bows and arrows, his
knife, and the other things needed in life and. if it be a woman, all
her domestic utensils, canisters, grinding instruments, and earthenvessels, because they say the dead will have need of them where
they are going. When asked where the souls of those who die go. they
answered, that. as soon as the souls leave the body they travel
towards the west and from there they rise once more into the air and

54

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

go close to the presence of the great captain whom they call coddi
eyo. From thence they go to wait in a house located towards the
south called the House of Death,

In a letter dated August 15, 1691, to the Viceroy of Mexico,
Casanas, the first missionary to the Hasinai, provided much information about these people. Concerning the mortuary customs,
Casanas (Swanton 1942: 207) says:
For this function, there are two Indians who serve as priests. They
say their duties are to talk to God and that He speaks to them. These
two Indians order a coffin for the dead man. Their order is promptly
obeyed. When the coffin is finished, the two Indians put into it some
tobacco and some of the herb they call ocaxio, and also a bow and
arrows. All these things they move about over the coffin. They keep
talking in a low voice as if they were praying. Their mode of speaking is
so strenuous that they perspire even though it be cold. During this
ceremony, the two wear skins. The ceremonies around the coffin being
finished, the Indians go to the place of interment which is always near
the house. There they talk again to themselves; but the grave is not
opened until, with an axe, they have made a stroke at the place where
the head of the dead man is to rest and another where the feet are to lie.
While the grave is being dug, the two return to the house and give
directions for placing the dead man in the coffin.

Though Casafias did not record the direction of the grave
with respect to the compass or the reason for its particular
placement, it is clear that its orientation was a matter of importance to those directing the affair.
Swanton (1942: 210) states:
When I visited the Caddo in 1912, (in Oklahoma) I was given to
understand that they buried their dead at full length, feet to the
west, so that the bodies faced west, the way the soul goes. This may
have been an error but not certainly so, as the custom of laying
bodies head to the west came in with Christianity, and in aboriginal
times the sout was supposed to travel west, not east...

Although the writings of Espinosa and Casanas date from the
late 1600’s and early 1700’s and concern the people of the present
Allen Focus, the Hasinai, there is every reason to believe the same
burial practices were in effect with the people of the area
(Frankston Focus) for a considerable period prior to the historic.
The archeological evidence indicates the same burial practices
also belonged to the people characterized as Titus Focus as well.

The ability to place a grave in a particular direction, such as
toward the sun at sunset with any prevision, would be hampered
by various conditions. Cloudy or overcast skies on some fall or
winter days would have forced them to estimate the direction of the
sun. Additional problems would, of course, be the location of the
cemetery with respect to forests and hills that might obscure the
actual location of the sun at its setting. In addition, an error of six
inches in the placement of one end of a six foot grave with respect
to the other end would result in a 5 o error in direction.
Whether or not a grave was oriented to a certain degree of
precision such as 5° or 10° in our measurement system was surely
of little importance to the Indians. The ritual would be the important thing.

Other Caddoan Burial Practices
The Sanders Site

The oldest nearby cultural group in which the east-west grave
orientation predominated is that at the Sanders Site, the type site
of Sanders Focus.
Krieger (1946: 175), in describing the burials states:
The 21 graves were in two groups, one scattered over the highest
part of "mound 1" and the other along the eastern end of the eminence
where it levels out along the terrace edge. There were no distinctions in
placement or content between the two groups. They contained a total of
60 individuals. Twelve graves contained a single individual; the other
nine contained 48 with from three to eight persons each. Without exception the body was extended at full length, usually on the back but at
times on the side or twisted to one side.

Concerning the grave orientation, Krieger states:
Grave pits were all rectangular. One skeleton lay with head to the
west, the direction of another was uncertain, and the remaining 58 lay
with head due east or within about 15 degrees of east; i.e. within the
range of seasonal variation in the point of sunrise.

It may be noted that this is also within the variation of the
point of sunset.

Angelina Focus

The Angelina Focus, defined by Jelks (1965), which was
centered in the McGee Bend Reservoir in Southeast Texas, contained burials in four sites attributed to this focus. In these sites
were eleven burials--six were flexed in various compass orientations, and five were extended and supine. Of the latter, two
burials were with the head to the north, two with head to the south,
and one with head southeast. The east-west orientation did not
play a part with these people.
Belcher Focus

At the Belcher Site (Webb 1959) the two burial pits assigned
by Webb to the Haley Focus were oriented west-southwest to
east-northeast with the heads west-southwest. The skeletons
were extended and supine.
The remaining burials, which were assigned to the Belcher
Focus occupation, included one bundle burial and a disturbed
burial with pelvic region and legs remaining, (Burial 1) apparently extended and supine with feet pointing almost due west.
There were two additional disturbed burials, one with head
south. Also included were two infant burials for which direction
could not be determined and an infant burial with head to the
southeast. There were 11 graves with the skeletons all extended
and supine, oriented with heads between 5° and 21° east of
south. A group of three graves was located with heads between
15° and 23° west of south. One grave was oriented with head
39° east of south and one with head about 25° east of north.
One burial which contained seven skeletons was oriented southsoutheast to north-northwest. Webb notes that this is the only
burial at the site in which the burials were carelessly or
irregularly placed.
In this pit. however, one body was prone, another on the side, a third
lying transversely across the pit, and a fourth with the head directed
northwest, although most had the heads toward the southeast end of
the pit.

In other sites with components now assigned to Belcher
Focus--Foster Place, Friday Place,
and the McClure
Mound--Moore (1912) noted that individuals were placed with

head to south except for three at Foster Place which were with
heads to north, northwest, and northeast.
Except for the single disturbed burial at the Belcher Mound,
no other burials were oriented with feet westerly as in the Titus
Focus.
Texarkana Focus

Graves from cemeteries attributed to the Texarkana Focus do
not conform with the east-west orientation of Titus.
At the Paul Mitchell cemetery where the direction of 52 graves
was determined, 47, or 90%, were oriented with feet between true
north and 36° W of true north. An average direction for the 47 is
221/2 ° or exactly north-northwest. Three graves were oriented with
feet to the northwest, one with feet toward west, and one with feet
about 5° or 10° east of north. The direction of 5 burials was not
determined.
At the E. H. Moores plantation, where the direction of seven of
eight burials could be determined, four were oriented with feet approximately northwest, one with feet toward the south, one with
feet to the east, and one with feet to the west.
Two different burial plots were excavated near the Hatchell
Mound. In Plot I where the directions of seven graves were
determined, three were with feet between 9° and 34° north of
west, one with feet toward north-northeast, one with feet 9 o west
of south, and two oriented 11 ° west of north, one of which had feet
to the north and the other with feet to the south.
Plot II yielded six burials with notes on the direction of three.
All three were with feet toward the north.
Spiro Site
Bell and Baerreis (1951) in commenting on the burials in the
Craig Mound of the Spiro Focus stdte:
The Craig mound produced a variety of burials, single burials,
extended, flexed and semi-flexed burials; bundle burials and
cremations. Group burials are probably the most common and may
contain from two to thirty individuals. Grave goods were found with a
large number of the burials although not all graves contained artifacts.
Some burials were especially rich in grave goods while others produced
relatively litle, if any, associated material.

58

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Brown (1966) in his description of the Craig Mound burials and
their contents has divided the burials into 16 different classes.
Although an occasional skeleton was oriented with head to east
and feet westerly, an east-west grave orientation was no trait of
importance at the Craig Mound.
Haley Site
A map prepared by Moore (1912: 529) indicates that at the
Haley Mound, type-site of the Haley Focus, seven skeletons were
oriented generally northwest-southeast with heads to the southeast. One skeleton was north-south with head to the north and
one northeast-southwest with head to the northeast.

GahaganMound
At Gahagan the skeletons were parallel to the walls of the
rectangular pits in which they were placed. All were extended
and on their backs. In Pit 1 the heads were to the northwest and
northeast; in Pit 2, northwest, southwest, southeast; in Pit 3 all
were north-northwest. These arrangements are noted by Moore
(1912: 513) for Pit 1 anal by Webb and Dodd (1939) for Pits 2 and
3.

George C. Davis Site
Mound C at the Davis site (type site of Alto Focus) was
partially excavated by Story from 1968-1970 (Story 1972).
Eleven pit burials were excavated during this period. Other
grave pits were located but were not excavated.
The grave pits were arranged in a sequence of Stages from
I to VI by Story. Stage I was represented by a single pit containing eight individuals. This pit, over which the mound was
built, originated at the ground surface. The following stages
were related to various stages of the mound construction which
occurred over the following centuries.
In grave pits of Stages I through IV, sufficient skeletal
remains were found to determine that the individuals had been
placed in a supine position, and in all cases with head to the
north and feet to the south. Soil acidity had caused the loss of all
skeletal material from the graves of Stages V and VI.

TUCK CARPENTER SITE

McCurtain Focus
Burials from McCurtain Focus sites appear mainly to have
east-west orientations like Titus Focus graves. Oklahoma sites of
this focus partially follow this trend.
Reporting on the E. Johnson Site, Wyckoff (1967) listed seven
burials which he attributed to the McCurtain Focus. Six graves
were east-west oriented, and one was northeast-southwest.
Enough skeletal material remained in four graves to determine
the skull position. In all four cases, it was to the east.
Reporting on the Sam Kaufman site in Texas, Harris (1953)
described eleven burials. Of these burials, four were east-west
oriented with head to east. Three were northeast-southwest
oriented with head to the northeast. Three were with head to the
north. One of these burials contained 28 blue glass beads. In the
remaining burial, a direction could not be determined. Perhaps
by historic times in this site, the east-west orientation was not
rigorously adhered to.
Skinner et al. (1969: 26) reported on additional excavations
at the Kaufman site which were conducted by salvage crews
from Southern Methodist University. During the excavations, 23
burials were found. Orientation was consistently east-west with
head to east. Skeletons were extended on their backs in individual graves except for one multiple burial containing four
individuals and a large shaft burial containing eleven individuals.
At the Eleventh Caddo Conference in March, 1968, Wyckoff
listed various sites which he equated with an early phase of the
McCurtain Focus and which he has grouped as the Mountain
Fork Complex. These sites are: Biggham Creek, Lamas Branch, E.
Johnson, Woods Mound Group, Bill Hughes, and Beaver.
Concerning burials at these sites he noted
single individuals, extended and supine with heads to east, north
east, or southeast. Association usually pottery, from 1 to 5 vessels
usually clustered around head and shoulders.

In summary, the east-west grave orientation of the Titus Focus
with head to east and feet to west also seems to be a trait of the
Frankston and McCurtain foci which were contemporaneous, of
the historic Allen Focus, and of the Sanders Focus which preceded
it in time. Contemporaneous foci which did not exhibit this trait

were: Texarkana, Belcher, and Angelina. Three Gibson Aspect foci

SEX IDENTIFICATIONS FOR BURIALS AT
THE CARPENTER SITE
The skeletal remains from the Carpenter Site graves were
analyzed as to sex by Duncan F. Wilson (who at the time of the
analysis was a student assistant in the Department of Anthropology at The University of Texas at Austin). Two separate
analyses were made by Wilson. The first was in December,
1967, and the second was in February, 1968. The second
analysis by Wilson was made without reference to the results of
the first.
The results of the two analyses are shown in the first two
columns of Fig. 16. The two analyses agree very closely, even for
the cases where the sex was questionable. The next column is
the author’s opinion as to the sex of the individual. It is based on
the two analyses and on the grave contents. Where the third
column differs from the first two, the author has weighed the
grave contents against the uncertainty of the skeletal analyses
and decided the sex on this basis.

Additional columns in this figure list arrow point types,
tools, ornaments, ceramics, and other items and traits. If an item
or trait is associated with a grave, a black dot was placed in the
appropriate square. The four shaded columns indicate traits or
artifacts that seemed to be almost completely associated with
only one sex. The shaded columns show that deer mandibles and
potters’ clay were associated with the female burials. Pipes and
evidence of fire were associated with male burials. Celts were
associated with both sexes, but mainly with the male at a ratio
of 5 to 2. Paint was more frequent in male graves by a ratio of
10 to 6, whereas the presence of mussel shell was more frequent
in female graves with a ratio of 8 to 3.
Arrow points were in both male and female graves.
However the quantity in the female graves was generally much
smaller than in those of males.
The two graves of young children and that of a juvenile
contained few offerings other than pottery vessels.
The late component graves, which are identified with an
asterisk, are emphasized because of the presence of Talco arrow
points and the pendant triangle motif on bowls.

62

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Late component graves, i.e, those that contain carinated bowls with
pendant triangle rim decoration and usually contain Talco points.

THE ARTIFACTS
Arrow Points

Of the 44 graves, 31, or 70%, contained one or more arrow
points. It is possible that some of the remaining graves may have
contained one or two which were missed. Fig. 16 itemizes the
number and type found in each grave. There were four distinct
point classifications in the graves. Stemmed points were Bassett
and Perdiz, and triangular points were Maud and Talco. Some
stemmed points had stems which seemed a little too long to be
classified as Bassett and a little too short to be Perdiz. Also,
some triangular points had basal concavities which were not
quite deep enough to fit the Maud type, but too deep to be
classified as Talco. Nevertheless, all were placed in one of the four
categories on a best-judgement basis.
An example of point types from a single grave is pictured in
Fig. 17. The letters under each group of points indicate the
location in the grave where they were found. Croup D includes
two Maud and two Perdiz points. Croup E is solely Perdiz points.
Croup F is classified as Bassett, though this is a case where the
stems seem a little long for Bassett. Croup C and Point H are
Maud.
Fig. 18 shows typical triangular points from several graves.
Points A through F in this figure are Talco points. Those shown
indicate the size range at the Carpenter Site. Point D is representative of the size of most Talco points found.
Points G through M are all from Grave 19. These points are
classified as Talco but have a different form in the base region.
They are identified by a straight or convex region in the basal
concavity, flanked by ear-like protuberances. This modification
of the basic Talco point has been noted as a minor type at three
other Titus Focus sites.
Points N through R are Maud points from several different
graves. Point S is gray flint and is an unidentified type. This was
the only point of this material and style in all the graves.
Fig. 19 shows short stemmed points which are classed as
Bassett. These are from various graves which are indicated in
the figure caption.
Fig. 20 illustrates points classed as Perdiz. These are also
from various graves.

64

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

There are no known flint outcrops in this portion of Texas.
As a consequence, the material utilized to manufacture a large
majority of the points at this site was a fine-grained quartzite
which was probably obtained locally. Nodules of quartzite,
which range in size from a few ounces to several pounds, erode
from the red clays of the area. It also occurs in the outwash of
ancient mountain ranges in Oklahoma, such as the Arbuckle
(Shafer 1973: 51). The colors of the local quartzite are various
shades of yellow-tan, gray, and pink-maroon.
In addition to the quartzite used for point manufacture,
various cherts were also employed. The cherts graded from
cream to brown in color with occasional shades of gray and red.
All Maud and Talco points were of the quartzite material.
Ninety percent of the Bassett points were of quartzite with ten
percent chert. The material of 56° of the Perdiz points was
chert, however, with the remaining 45% quartzite.
The use of chert (probably from stream pebbles) for many of
the Perdiz points and the virtual abandonment of chert as a
material for the Bassett and triangular point types seems to
indicate that at the Carpenter Site, the choice of material
changed with the change in point styles.
Quartzite was used in a large majority of the dart points
associated with the archaic period in this region of Texas.
A fragment of a single dart point the proximal end of an
Edgewood point was found in Grave 9. Since Grave 9 was a
child’s burial, the broken point may have been a toy or curiosity
belonging to him.
No other dart points were found in the graves or in the
grave fill. A single Gary point was found on the surface at the
southwestern extremity of the cemetery. A single Catahoula
arrow point, 21 mm long, was also found on the surface. This is
the only occurrence of this type point at the site.
Green Pigment
Green pigment was found in 12 graves. Usually it was
located in a very small pot or bowl, but sometimes it would be on
a fairly large potsherd used like a saucer. Occasionally, a few
small bits would be under a vessel or in the dirt as if sprinkled
or tossed into the burial. In some instances it would be in a
cache of items perhaps included in a perishable container. In
one instance a small cylindrical-shaped piece of green pigment

was found. Most examples of green pigment were usually in
small irregularly shaped lumps. The pigment did not have much
tendency to leach or dissipate into the surrounding sand but held
its original shape well.
No vessels were found with green pigment worked into the
engraved or incised lines of decorations. When wet, the green
pigment has the feel and consistency of wet clay. The color is
not a bright green, but an olive green.
A sample of material from a burial at the Keeling Site is
apparently the raw material used in the preparation of the green
pigment. This was identified by L. E. Garner, geologist with the
Bureau of Economic Geology, University of Texas at Austin, as
a glauconite sandy clay which is a complex silicate rich in iron.
Unweathered glanconite is green. Weathered glauconite is generally
reddish-brown because the iron has been altered to iron oxide.

When crushed, the sample from the Keeling Site formed a fine
powder, and when wet it yielded the same color and had the same
feel as the material from the Carpenter Site. The conclusion
concerning the green pigment found in the burials is that it is a
glauconitic sandy clay which had been crushed into a fine powder.
It is probable that the powder was then mixed with animal fat or
water by the Indians to give it the required body for easy application.

Red Pigment
Red pigment was in 10 graves. Like the green pigment it was
contained on sherds or in small vessels. However, unlike the green
pigment, the red pigment leached into the surrounding sand. Sometimes a reddish smear in the sand was the only indication of its
presence. On occasion, the location of a vessel containing red
pigment could be detected by the reddish color of the sand directly
above it even before the vessel itself was uncovered.
The red pigment is iron oxide and probably came from
scrapings from hematite. This particular region of east Texas
contains large quantities of iron ore, so wide varieties of hematite
or iron oxide rocks were readily available. However, the only
hematite found in the cemetery was in the cache of Grave 19.
Five graves contained both red and green pigment.

Ornamentation

Items of ornamentation were relatively scarce in the Carpenter burials.
The red, green and white pigment (kaolin) when suitably
mixed with water or grease probably served for painting on the
face and body.
Artifacts for ornamentation consisted of a single columnella
of a conch shell which was found in the neck region of the individual in Grave 27.
A rectangular mussel shell fragment with rounded corners
was in Grave 21. This could have been some type of inset but
cannot be positively identified as such.
Spool shaped ceramic ear plugs were in Graves 31 and 32.
A single, similarly shaped stone earspool with a copper plate on
one face was found in Grave 34. A major fragment of a soft
sandstone earspool was embedded in a lump of clay in Burial 38.
Two wooden disc-shaped objects were found on either side of the
skull in Grave 40. The one located on the left side of the skull
was nearly complete, and the other was just a fragment. (Fig. 21
shows these items as well as the ear plugs.) The larger piece is
contoured on its outward side like the cymbal-shaped copper
ornaments from the Coral Snake Mound (McClurkan, et al.,
1966).
On both objects a green powdery residue was present on
small irregularly shaped areas. A wet chemistry qualitative
analysis of this residue indicated it is probably a copper s~ilt.
The same test run on scrapings from the copper plate on the
stone earspool from Grave 34 gave the same result. This indicates that the wooden discs were once associated with a
copper sheath like the one on the stone earspool. Unfortunately,
the case is not that clear cut; in addition to the green areas,
certain areas have a reddish cast or appearance. Microscopic
examination shows a red pigment in the grains of the wood. One
explanation could be that the ornaments originally had a copper
cover that was removed. Then, red pigment could have been
smeared on the wood as a substitute. Whether this explanation
is valid or not, the main significance of the wooden ornament is
that it shows the cymbal shaped ornament persisted into Titus
Focus times from earlier cultures.
The ceramic earspool and the stone earspool with the

TUCK CARPENTER SITE

71

copper plate were all found against the skulls in positions that
definitely identified them as ear ornaments as opposed to lip or
nose ornaments. The wooden cymbal-shaped plate and fragment
were located at a lower level--more beside the jawbone of the
individual. This would indicate that they were suspended in
some manner.
The ceramic earspools are a known trait of the Titus Focus,
whereas the stone earspool with copper plate and the cymbalshaped wooden artifact have not been reported before.
Pipes

Fig. 22 pictures the pipes from the graves. Those identified
with letters "a" through "d" look as if a stem that extended past
the bowl folded up against the bowl while the clay was still
plastic. This pipe form was first pointed out by Moore (1912:
637) and has also been discussed by Hoffman (1967: 4).
Pipe "e" has a small keelqike protuberance which may
represent the vestigial remains of the stem as mentioned above.
Pipes "f", "g", and "h" have conical bowls. Pipe "h" has an
engraved ladder motif and small holes. Kaolin had been inserted
in these engraved areas.
Pipe "a" which was from a late component grave did not
differ in form from pipes "b" through "d" which belonged to
earlier component graves.
No uniform position for placing a pipe in the grave was
evident in this cemetery. The relation of the pipe to the skeleton
in Grave 1 is unknown, as the skeleton was completely absent.
However, it was probably on the right side of the body. In
Graves 23, 25, and 43, the pipes were in proximity to the skull
but at a higher level. In Graves 18, 24, and 26, the pipes were at
the same elevation as the skeleton. In Grave 18 it was beside the
right wrist, in Grave 24 it was probably near the left elbow, and
in Grave 26 it was near the left knee.
Pottery
The major Titus Focus pottery types have been defined as to
paste and vessel form by Suhm, et al. (1954). The vessels from
the Carpenter Site fall within their definitions
The average number of vessels per individual at the Carpenter cemetery was approximately 8.8. This average is neither

high nor low in relation to other Titus Focus cemeteries. At the
McKinney Site there was an average of 10.7 vessels for nine
graves. (There were two additional graves, but the exact number
of vessels for them was not available.) This represents the
highest average within the Titus Focus known to the author. At
the opposite end of the scale, there was an average of 4.4
vessels for 5 graves at the Atkinson Site.
Within the Carpenter cemetery, Grave 21, which was a
double burial, contained 17 vessels. Grave 35 contained only
three. These represented the extremes.
From an inspection of the grave drawings, it is apparent
that the carinated bowl was present in the greatest quantity.
These bowls rarely showed use as cooking vessels. Small vessels
of this type sometimes contained paint, but the larger ones give
no indication as to their actual use. Casanas, (Swanton 1942:
157) referring to the Hasanai, said that "the plates they use are
round earthen pans." Espinosa (ibid.) mentioned "earthen
vessels, some large and some small, in which to serve the old
and the young." From these brief descriptions and from a lack of
evidence to the contrary, it appears the carinated bowls may
have been used in this manner. Obviously, they could have been
used to hold most anything.
Large and small compound bowls were present in many
graves. Very small bowls sometimes contained paint, as did
small carinated bowls. Like the carinated bowls, these vessels
seldom showed use as cooking vessels, either. Occasionally, one
showed a trace of having been in a fire. Two large compound
vessels which were in Graves 27 and 29 contained a deer
mandible each. The large compound vessels would serve well for
storage of food, whether agricultural products such as corn or
beans, or that gathered from the forest.
The other major categories of vessels include the cooking
vessels, bottles, and jars. Effigy vessels were only occasionally
included, and rattle bowls were included in the grave offerings
even less frequently.
Figs. 12 and 23 picture selected Ripley Engraved carinated
bowl designs from the Carpenter Site and from other Titus Focus
sites. In Figure 12 vessels "a" through "c" are vessels which
exhibit the pendant triangle motif common to the nine late
component graves. This motif did not occur in the other 35
graves. Vessels "d" and "e" are decorated with the scroll motif.

TUCK CARPENTER SITE

75

This design was present in both the early and late component
graves. Vessels "f" and "g" were engraved with the horizontal
diamond motif. In addition, the diamonds on vessel "g" were
vertically bisected. Vessels "h", "k", and "m" feature the
triangular motif. Vessel "k" and "m" styles were most common
in the earlier component graves. Vessel "h", which has the small
engraved triangles appended to some of the diagonals, occurred
less frequently.
Fig. 23 pictures several carinated bowls from sites other
than Carpenter. Several of the motifs on these bowls were also
present at the Carpenter Site. Vessel "a" is a modification of the
scroll motif. In this variation the usual circles appear as
semicircles which alternately originate from the shoulder and
rim. The usual diagonal that connects the top of one circle to the
bottom of the next is more horizontal in this design. Vessel "c" is
also a special form of the scroll motif. The motif on vessel "b"
was not present at Carpenter but does appear in other Titus
Focus sites as well as in other Fulton Aspect foci. Vessel "e"
represents a combination of a scroll motif and inverted triangle
design. Vessels "d" and "k" are rectalinear designs that occur
in several sites. Vessel "i" from the Johns Site in unique. It
seems to portray stemmed arrow points as the filler under and
above the diagonal lines. Vessel "g" from the Rumsey Site is
Killough Pinched. Vessel "f" from the Harold Williams Site is a
spherical jar with the Wilder Engraved design. Vessel "m" is
one of several bottles from the Russell Site with this decorative
motif. A single identical bottle was in a grave of the Caldwell
Site and was probably a trade vessel from Russell. A slight
variation from this motif was on a vessel from the Starrett
collection.
Fig. 24 pictures several compound vessels. These vessels
"a" through "e" are all classified as Ripley Engraved. Vessels
"a", "b", and "e" exhibit scroll or modified scroll design motifs.
Vessels "c" and "d" have excised triangular areas with either
vertical or slanted lines between them. Small compound vessels
frequently have peaked rims. Several of these are shown in the
grave drawings. Vessel "f" of Fig. 24 is a very large vessel with
horizontal punctates below the lip and at the junction of body
and rim. Between these rows are roughly parallel, incised
slanted lines. The body is plain. No type-name has yet been given

76

vessels with this decorative motif. Vessel "g" is a large Bullard
Brushed cooking pot.
Fig. 25 pictures several Carpenter Site cooking vessel types.
Vessel "a" is La Rue Neck Banded, and "b" is Maydelle Incised.
Vessels "e" and "f" are Cass Appliques and "g", "h", and "k"
are Harleton Applique. Vessel "c" was unique at this site. The
body is covered with parallel rows of fingernail punctates, and
the rim is horizontally brushed. Vessel "d" is Bullard Brushed. It
is covered from the rim to near the base with vertical brushing,
while the rim is decorated with punctates. Vessels "c" and "d"
do not fit any defined type.
Most of the vessels pictured in Fig. 25 show a cleaner exterior near the base than higher on the vessel side. This appearance would be expected for vessels which were nestled in a bed
of coals. The more intense heat near the coals would burn away
the soot or grease while the cooler flame higher up would not.
In addition to the vessel types pictured (Bullard, Cass,
Harleton, Maydelle, and La Rue) many vessels with other combinations of decorations were present. There were many cooking
vessels with two to four rows of punctates around the rim. About
half of these vessels had the rim raised into four peaks. Most of
these vessels also had small nodes below each peak. Their
bodies were plain, had vertically incised lines, or were brushed.
Four vessels were decorated on the rim with geometric
punctate designs. On these vessels the bodies were plain, vertically incised, or brushed, too. Vessels with Maydelle incising on
the rim were also plain, vertically incised, or brushed on the
body.
Several cooking vessels had vertically incised or combed
lines on the rim with a plain, brushed, or vertically incised body.
Other combinations of rim and body decoration were present,
but are not described. These can be noted by the reader in the
grave drawings.
Cooking vessels at the Carpenter Site and in all Titus Focus
sites are decorated with appliques, nodes, brushing, punctating,
incising, and infrequently, combing. Engraving was not used on
vessels constructed for cooking. The rough exterior of cooking
vessels which resulted from brushing anv applique may have
facilitated handling of the vessels when they were hot or increased the surface area for heat absorption.

Fig. 26 pictures bottles and a spherical jar with Ripley
Engraved decorative motif. All vessels are from the Carpenter
early component graves. The bodies of vessels "a" and "b" are
formed into four points that give the bottle a square appearance
when viewed from above. These bottles are polished and nearly
black. Red pigment was worked into the engraved lines. Though
not identical in design, the workmanship of these vessels is so
similar that they might have been made by the same person.
Vessel "c" does not have a typical bottle design. However, it
does incorporate the ticked circle and one half the diamond
element of the bottles that have the classic, concentric circle and
diamond design. Vessels "d", "e", and "f" are all similar in
their designs, which have crosses inside the inner circles.
Vessels "e" and "f" have red pigment in the engraved lines.
Vessel "d" showed no pigment in the lines. Vessel "g" had slight
traces of white pigment, probably kaolin, in the engraving.
Fig. 27 shows additional bottles from the Carpenter graves.
Vessels "a" and "b" are undecorated, but "b" is covered with a
red slip. The design motif on vessels "c" through "h" is Wilder
Engraved. The Wilder Engraved bottles were in both the early
and late component graves, (8 out of 9 of the latter). Vessels "d",
"g", and "h" are from the late component. Vessel "c" is a
double bottle with a Ripley Engraved design on the square top
part and Wilder Engraved on the circular lower portion. Vessel
"f" is red slipped with the design cut through to the buff paste.
All other bottles have red pigment in the engraving, the vessels
shown are representative of the bottle shapes and sizes from the
Carpenter Site. However, vessel "h" is unique.
A study of bottle placement with respect to the skeleton in
the Carpenter graves has shown the following. Placement on the
right side of the body was favored over left side by a ratio of
two-to-one. Favorite specific locations in the order of descending
popularity were: right knee, 6 cases; right wrist or hip, 5; right
elbow, 4; between the feet, 4; right side of skull, 3; left side of
skull, 3; and left knee, 3. The remaining locations, represented
by only one or two cases, were: The ankles; midway on the left
tibia; midway on the right femur; midway on the right and left
radii; left elbow; the left shoulder; and midway on the right
humerus.

appear square in the plan view. Three graves contained vessels
of this type. Vessels "c", "d", and "e" are typical of the effigy
vessels from this site. All are small vessels with fiat tails
pointing outward from the bowl. The heads are on the opposite
side. In all cases the heads were abstract in form and no
identification with a particular animal, bird, or human head
could be made. Vessels of this type were in nine graves. Vessels
"f", "g", and "h" are rattle bowls. One node of vessel "f" came
loose after the vessel was removed from the grave. The node
contained several baked clay balls about the size of small peas.
Only three graves contained rattle bowls.
In Fig. 29, "a" through "f" picture probable trade vessels
which were in the Carpenter graves. Bottle "a" has an orangetan external coloration (not a slip) unlike all other bottles at the
site. The design consists of concentric semicircles and spur-like
elements. The drawing of Grave 18 shows this design in better
detail. These elements are common on Avery Engraved vessels of
the Texarkana and McCurain foci, and more often on bowls than
bottles. This bottle is probably a trade vessel from the north,
either from the Texarkana or McCurtain Focus.
Vessel "b" is classified as Avery Red (red slipped) and is
like those found in the pit and shaft burials at the Kaufman Site.
These graves belonged to the McCurtain component at that site.
The description of the artifacts from Grave 23 provides more
detailed information about this bottle type.
Vessel "c" from Grave 26 is Avery Engraved. It is covered
with a red slip and is engraved to expose the buff paste. No
pigment was used in the engraved lines. This is a trade vessel
from the Texarkana or McCurtain foci.
Vessel "d" is a Simms Engraved bowl from Grave 33, a late
component grave at the Carpenter Site. This vessel is also an
import from the Texarkana or McCurtain foci.
Vessel "e" is from Grave 37. This pot has several characteristics which point to a Poynor Engraved classification. Poynor
Engraved is a Frankston Focus type. The Frankston Focus area is
to the south of the Titus area. Further information concerning
this vessel is included in the description of the materials of
Grave 37.
Vessel "f" from Grave 27 is a large effigy which is completely different in form from those in the nine other graves that
contained effigy vessels. This vessel is described more fully in

Johns Engraved

Johns Engraved is a new pottery type proposed here. The
feature which differentiates it from other pottery types is the
design motif. This motif in its most easily identified form consists
of several bird heads. The engraved bird head is the only known
representation of a living creature (other than modeled effigies)
depicted on Titus Focus pottery. A variation of the motif employs
interlocking hooks, and a third design consists of a combination
of the two. These designs are shown in Figs. 30 and 31. The
vessels pictured are all lohns Engraved pots known at this time.
The definition for lohns Engraved is as follows:
PASTE-Temper: kaolin, bone, or none visible
Texture: compact, not crumbly
Color: shades of buff and gray, both on exterior and in core; fire
mottling
Surface finish: fairly smooth, both inside and out on the bowls and
just outside on the bottles
FORM-Wall thickness: 5-8 millimeters
Lip: rounded, rolled outward and smoothed, except on vessel "a",
Fig. 30, where it is rolled outward but not blended into the
body
Bases: flat to slightly convex
Vessel shapes: bottles, conical bowls, carinated bowls, and jars
DECORATION-Treatment: engraving; white kaolin may be inserted in the
engraved lines
Designs: bird head elements with hooked beak; lines which outline
beak may not close (Fig. 30, "d" and Fig. 31, "c"); These
elements may be either upright, suspended, or horizontally oriented as in Fig. 30, "b". A hook-like element as in
Fig. 31, "d" and "e". Bird .head may be used in conjunction with hook-like element Fig. 31, "b" and "c".
CULTURAL AFFILIATION-A Titus Focus type. So far recognized only in the Carpenter, Johns,
and Horton sites in Camp County and the Caldwell Site in Titus
County.

Bone and Shell
Deer ulnae appear to have been placed in the graves as
complete pieces. They are not shortened from wear as would be
expected if used as flaking tools. Ulnae were in three graves.
Deer mandibles were included as offerings in 10 graves. It has
been postulated by various authors that the mandibles may have
been used as corn shelling tools or as sickles. Mandibles were
found in large compound bowls in Graves 27 and 29 and one in a
large cooking vessel in Grave 45. If these vessels had contained
corn still on the cob when placed in the graves, presence of the
mandible would support the proposition that it was used as a
shelling tool. A deer mandible sickle is pictured in Swanton (1942:
Pl. 16). This was collected from the Caddo in Oklahoma in historic
times. The mandible very likely was used for both purposes.
A nearly rectangular piece of mussel shell from Grave 21 was
found at the neck region of the north skeleton of this double burial
and may have been mounted as an ornament. A columnella bead
from a conch was recovered in Grave 27. Both the mussel shell and
conch shell items were previously discussed under Ornamentation.

Stone Artifacts
Fig. 32 illustrates various stone artifacts from the Carpenter
graves. Items "a" through "g" are petaloid celts. All are pecked
and ground and show considerable battering on the butt end. The
bit is finely ground on all except "g". Celt "g" has a very dull bit,
apparently from use. The bit of celt "f" had been broken and then
reground resulting in the asymmetrical shape. A diagonal hinge
fracture which was probably a result of the break is visible in the
picture. The material of the celts, probably Ouachita sandstone, is
not locally available.
Item "h" is a quartzite stream pebble from Grave 10. It is
polished on one surface and shows some use as a hammer stone on
another side. Item "i", an abraiding stone of ferruginous sandstone, was associated with a deer ulna in Grave 45. Item "k" is a
roughly noded, natural ferruginous sandstone rock with two flat
breaks where protuberances had apparently been knocked off.
This rock had been placed between the teeth of the individual of
Grave 13. Item "m" from Grave 43 is either a utilized biface fragment or a small gouge. The edges and the bit show wear from use.
The material of this item is a tan, fine grained quartzite.

THE RELATION OF THE CARPENTER SITE TO OTHER
TITUS FOCUS SITES
A proposed temporal position of the Carpenter Site components with respect to other Titus Focus sites is indicated in
Fig. 33. In arranging the sites in this sequence, several factors
were considered. First, the assumption was made that some sites
were probably contemporary with others, some earlier in time,
and others later. In relating one site to another, pottery was
compared by classification, selected vessel shape, bottle type
and shape, selected carinated bowl decorative motif, and
selected design elements. Arrow point types were also used in
the analysis. These characteristics are all listed in Fig. 33.
The pottery types are grouped by the foci with which they
are primarily associated. Generally, at a given site, the presence
of pottery types other than those which are major Titus Focus
types, would indicate trade or contact between foci.
To establish which pottery types or vessel forms in Titus
Focus were the most recent, Titus Focus vessels were compared
with vessels from four historic and one proto-historic site. These
sites are the top five in Fig. 33. The top four are sites which
contained some artifacts of European manufacture in the graves.
The fifth, the Hunt Site, contained no European artifacts, only
those of Indian manufacture which were nearly identical to
those from the Clements Site. These two sites are discussed by
Suhm, et al. (1954: 225).
The Slade and Brown Sites (Webb, et al., 1969: 8) are
located in southern Harrison County and the Clements and Hunt
sites in Cass County. These sites are all near the Titus Focus
area in Northeast Texas. They are not part of the Titus Focus
but are Indian cemeteries of a later period. No historic cemetery
site or sites which contained artifacts of European manufacture
have been reported within the Titus Focus area proper.
The earliest known sites which can be included in the Titus
Focus are those of the Whelan Complex. These sites are near the
bottom of the list in Fig. 33. In the two bottom positions are the
Adkins #1 and W.O. Reed sites. These are Fulton Aspect
cemetery sites which are located in the Titus Focus area (Fig. 2)
but most likely precede or are contemporary with the Whelan
Complex. They do not exhibit enough Titus Focus characteristics
to be placed in the Focus.

92

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

In addition to establishing early and late pottery types to aid
in determining the relative temporal position of the Titus Focus
sites, a yardstick was needed to relate the arrow point types
from the sites. For example, some Titus Focus sites contained
only Talco points (triangular), some only stemmed points, and
some (like Carpenter) a mixture of point types. If one of these
styles (stemmed or triangular) is clearly older than the other in
the Titus Focus, and if it can be established what the relative
age is, then another means to place the sites in a temporal order
would be available.
To establish this relative age, percentages of arrow points
from graves, middens and other features of other caddo sites
were calculated. Detailed data on these analyses and
calculations could not be presented here, but are on file with the
author and the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory,
Austin. Those sites and foci studied include both the Gibson and
Fulton Aspect periods. Fig. 15 shows the geographical location of
the various foci with respect to the Titus. The data for arrow
point analysis also includes materials from the Davis Site (Alto
Focus); see Newell and Krieger (1949) and Story (1972). Information for Mound A at Gahagan was supplied by Dr.
Clarence H. Webb.
The reader may be unfamiliar with several of the arrow
point types from the Craig Mound of the Spiro Focus. All of these
points are stemmed, or side or corner notched with the exception
of one Fresno point.
At the opposite end of the time scale, during Caddo V or
historic times, the triangular points were much in evidence. The
Turney point was present in the Allen Focus and the Fresno
point was by far the most popular form with the peoples who
composed the Norteho Focus.
It is apparent from the analyses that in the Caddoan area
the stemmed and notched points precede the triangular points in
time. With this as a guide, it is then logical to assume that the
Titus Focus sites where stemmed points are present and
triangular points absent are older than those where the
triangular point was the predominant type.
Thus, early and late arrow point styles have been established. The Whelan Complex and its pottery styles have been
established as the lower boundary (or earliest sites) and nearby
historic sites and their pottery as the upper boundary.

Therefore, the remaining task is to order the Titus Focus sites
within this framework.
To start site ordering, pottery types and vessel forms from
the historic sites were matched with similar types from Titus
Focus sites. In particular, Titus sites containing spool-necked
bottles and Taylor Engraved, Hodges Engraved, Simms Engraved,
and Clements Brushed pottery were placed at the top of the list.
This, then, established other similarities between these Titus
sites such as the Bailey Engraved bottle and the bottle with
extended base. The pendant triangle carinated bowl decorative
motif, the scroll motif, and the two motifs at the far right of the
"rim decorative style" section are other similarities. In addition,
the arrow points from the graves were nearly completely of the
Talco type except for the Bison "B" and Salt Lick sites which
will be discussed later.
It is the author’s belief that when an intricate design or
unique artifact form from one site appears as a minor type or
part of the assemblage of another, a close correlation in time between the two is implied. This is based on the assumption that
the design or artifact actually had to be seen before it could be
duplicated. Trade between groups of people would also account
for its spread. In either case, contemporaneity may be assumed.
Examples of this are: the four carinated bowl, decorative motifs
at the right of the panel; the bird head; the completely encircled
cross design elements; or the chalice vessel form.
In addition to working backward in time from the historic
pottery types, sites were correlated forward in time from the
Whelan Complex characteristics. Two main items used for
correlation were Pease Brushed Incised pottery and the earlier
arrow point types. This correlation then established the classic
round and square Ripley Engraved bottles, the triangular design
on carinated bowls, and Perdiz arrow points as continuing
characteristics.
With the early Johns and Carpenter site components, Bassett
and Maud points came into the picture with Perdiz. The Johns
site was divided into early and late components as was the
Carpenter Site. These components are noted on this chart (Fig.
33) as 1st and 2nd Johns or Carpenter.
The shaded strips are intended to emphasize the beginning
and end of various traits and the grouping of sites where these
traits were present (see Fig. 33).

TUCK CARPENTER SITE

95

In any comparison of this sort, it becomes apparent that
certain decorative styles, pottery types, or design elements
extend throughout the time span represented by these sites.
Some were limited in popularity, evolved somewhere along the
way, or were perhaps only regional in extent.
Examples of items other than pottery types that span most
of the Titus Focus time period are: large compound bowls;
bottles of Wilder Engraved; the scroll design on carinated bowls;
the encircled cross element (where the cross touches the circle};
the sun symbol element; and the "s" element.
The pendant triangle rim design on carinated bowls is an
example of a style which evolved and became more popular with
time. The encircled cross element where the cross does not
touch the circle is an example of a regional characteristic. The
sites where this element was present are on the western fringe
of the Titus area.
The Bison "B" and Salt Lick sites are reported by Woodall
(1969), and McClurkan, et al. (1966), respectively. These
sites were located in the Toledo Bend Reservoir area on
the Sabine River approximately 75-80 miles southeast of the
Northeast Texas Titus Focus area. Fig. 15 shows this location. In
the figure the encircled area is noted as Titus Related. In addition to these two sites that included graves, the Goode Site
(Woodall 1969} in the same reservoir area produced over 8000
sherds but no graves. Pottery types identified by Woodall included Ripley Engraved, Poynor Engraved, Hodges Engraved, and
Belcher Ridged. Three (possibly four) Perdiz points represented
the total number of arrow points. Among the Ripley Engraved
sherds from carinated bowls from the Goode Site are excellent
examples of the pendant triangle, scroll, and triangular motifs
common in the northeast Texas area.
Clearly, the Toledo Bend Reservoir sites are related to Titus,
even though there are many differences. In addition to differences in grave direction, (feet to the notheast to north in Toledo
Bend as opposed to westerly in northeast Texas), Toledo Bend
ceramics exhibit a much higher percentage of bone temper than
does the northeast Texas Titus Focus pottery (Woodall 1969: 11,
48). Still other differences include the cooking vessel types which
are more closely allied to Belcher Focus that to Titus. The Ripley
Engraved carinated bowls of the Bison "B" and Salt Lick sites
are consistently smaller in size than those in northeast Texas

96

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

although they incorporate several of the carinated bowl design
motifs. Both of these sites produced shallow burials with flexed
skeletons and numerous offerings. Flexed skeletons are a feature
held in common with several Angelina Focus sites (Jelks 1965).
The Wilder Engraved bottles of the Bison "B" site, small Taylor
Engraved bottles from the Salt Lick site, and one particular
Harleton Applique vessel from the Bison "B" Site are all indistinguishable from their counterparts in northeast Texas.
In placing these sites in the temporal sequence, the pottery
similarities were used and the arrow point types were ignored.
Justification for this is based on the belief that the arrow point
tradition in this area is akin to the Angelina and Belcher foci
where the point types were stemmed rather than to Titus where
a change to triangular occurred.
From inspection of Fig. 33, it may be noted that the Rumsey
Site is characterized by both Titus Focus and Gibson Aspect
pottery. In placing the site within the Titus Focus, only the Titus
Focus pottery types were considered. This site is represented
only with a collection of pottery, and no information rearding
the graves is available. Obviously certain graves at the Rumsey
Site represent an older time period than Titus.
In the site sequence it should be remembered that two
different types of sites are included. The cemeteries provided
complete vessels and arrow points in direct context. The Whelan
Complex sites did not contain graves except for the Harroun Site
where one was found. The artifacts, sherds and points, used in
the ordering of this complex’s sites were acquired from the
general site excavations. The Roberts Site, which included a
mound built over a burned structure, also produced Pease
Brushed Incised sherds. Both traits are found in the Whelan,
Harroun, and Dalton sites and characterize the Whelan Complex.
The artifacts from the Roberts Site were mostly surface
finds from a nearby midden area. They included triangular
arrow points and carinated bowl rims with pendant triangle
design. These indicate a later time period than the Whelan
Complex. The Roberts Site was placed in the sequence based on
these artifacts.
If the artifacts and the mound at the Roberts Site were
contemporary, this would imply that erecting mounds over
burned structures existed later in the Titus sequence than

TUCK CARPENTER SITE

97

originally thought. On the other hand, the artifacts, or at least
part of them, may represent a superposition of later artifacts
over those coeval with the mound. Additional excavation will be
needed to establish the real relation between mound and midden
at the Roberts Site.
At several Titus Focus sites, there were graves present
which differed in character from the norm. The Bison "B" and
Salt Lick sites contained shallow, flexed burials with few or no
grave offerings as well as the deeper graves with extended
skeletons. At the Salt Lick Site, it was postulated by the excavators (McClurkan, et al., 1966: 56) that these graves indicates a
"difference of social status: either a caste system within the
tribal unit or slavery."
At the Harold Williams Site, at least four shallow graves
contained extended skeletons and no grave offerings. The skeletons were oriented one each with head to the east and west and
two with head to the north. This is in contrast to the consistent
head to east and feet to west of the nearby (30-40 feet} Titus
Focus cemetery. As no artifacts were present in the shallow
graves, there was no way of determining whether they preceded,
were contemporary with, or followed the Titus Focus cemetery in
time.
At the Ford Site, shallow graves which contained no vessels
to three pottery vessels and/or crude stone work were at the
same location as the Titus Focus graves. One Titus grave had cut
through one of the shallow graves. These shallow graves were
described as Farrar type burials by the site excavator (Goldschmidt 1935}. The Farrar Site nearby {within a mile or so)
yielded similar graves. Apparently, these graves predated the
Titus Focus burials.
Also, the Rumsey Site included both Gibson Aspect and
Titus Focus vessels. Based on this fact, it may be inferred that
both Gibson Aspect and the later Titus Focus graves were
present. It is interesting to note that Indians of different time
periods chose identical locations for their graves.
A feature of the older sites in the arranged sequence concerns the infrequency of carinated bowls in the graves. The
single grave at the Harroun Site contained but two vessels, one a
bottle and one a compound bowl with peaked rim. At the A.P.
Williams Site, there was less than one carinated bowl per grave.
At the Chasteen Site, there was a total of only three carinated

98

TEXAS

ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

bowls in two graves. In both the Adkins #1 and W. O. Reed sites,
this form was represented by only a minor percent of the
vessels. The popularity of this vessel form as an offering increased as time passed.
DATING THE CARPENTER SITE
Two sources provide information for dating the Carpenter
Site late component graves. The first is a radiocarbon date of
A.D. 1590 +_ 60 years (Tx-666) which was provided by The University of Texas at Austin Radiocarbon Dating Laboratory. The date
was obtained from the three small charred logs of Grave 10.
The second source of information is based on inference and
concerns the "chalice"-like vessel of Indian manufacture of
Grave 33, Fig. 34. Fig. 34 shows two additional stemmed
vessels--one from the Johns Site and one from the Gandy Site.
The vessel from the Gandy Site was first pictured in an article
by A.T. Jackson (1938) entitled "Fire in East Texas Burial
Rites". The spoon-like artifact of pottery shown in the figure
came from the same grave at the Johns Site as the "chalice."
This is the only artifact of this type known by the author to be
associated with the Titus Focus.
A search in the published archeological literature concerning Texas and bordering states has failed to disclose vessels
with true stems like those of Fig. 34. Inquiries concerning similar
vessels in the collections of the Gilcrease Museum and the University of Arkansas have also failed to disclose duplicates. The
vessel from the Gandy Site is the only vessel of this type in the
collections of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory.
Stemmed vessels can be accounted for as either a spontaneous development within the Titus Focus or a duplication of
an existing form. The latter event is more likely since no other
vessel shapes appear to be unique to Titus Focus. As this vessel
form is apparently not a trait of contemporary or prior loci, the
possibility exists that the vessel or vessels which engendered the
idea were of European manufacture. It should be remembered,
however, that no Titus Focus sites have contained artifacts of
European manufacture.
After considering various possible contacts between the
Indians of this region and Europeans, the De Soto expedition led
by Moscoso into Texas appears the most likely contact. After

landing in Florida in 1539, the expedition wandered through the
present southeastern states. The group which entered Texas in
1542 consisted of approximately 350 Europeans (a decrease from
the 600 who started the expedition) and 500 or more Indian
slaves. Their entrada into Texas was an attempt by the surviving
members of the expedition to reach present day Mexico. After
penetrating deep into Texas, they gave up their plan to reach
"New Spain" by land and retraced their path to the Mississippi
River.
The stemmed vessel from the Carpenter Site has been called
a chalice because of its close resemblance to the chalice as used
in the Mass. However, it is unlikely the people of the Titus Focus
would see this object. Both Swanton (1939) and Castaneda (1936:
121) report that in a battle with the Indians in October, 1540, at
Mavilla (Mobile)
they lost all their clothes they brought with them, the pearls they intended
to send to Cuba, the bandages and appliances of their only surgeon, and,
worst of all, the chalices, the altar decorations, the priest’s robes, the wine,
and the wheat flour reserved for the service of the Mass and all their
powder.

Even if all the chalices of the Mass were lost, stemmed wineglasses, stemmed cups, or stemmed goblets were probably still in
the possession of individuals during their excursion into Texas and
it is assumed that these vessels were seen by the Indians. Also,
spoons belonging to the expedition members could have been seen
by the Indians.
Historians differ on the route followed by the De Soto expedition in Texas as well as in other states. Fig. 35 shows the
proposed routes in Texas as defined by Castaneda (1936) and
Swanton (1939). The Castaneda route actually passed through
present day Camp and Franklin counties where the Carpenter,
Johns, and Gaudy sites are located. Additional circumstantial evidence that the Castaneda route may be closer to the one actually
followed than the route proposed by Swanton is provided by a
major fragment of a chain mail gauntlet found near Dallas. It was
exhibited and discussed by W. W. Crook at the annual meeting of
the Texas Archeological Society in Fort Worth in 1957. Since 1957,
an additional artifact of European manufacture and several Indian
artifacts which could have been associated with this expedition
have been found in Dallas.

FIGURE 36. Relation of Radiocarbon Date, De Soto Expedition
Date, and Probable Date of the Carpenter Site Late Component
Graves.

If the expedition led by Moscoso (who became the leader after
De Soto’s death) did, in fact, pass through the region occuped by
the Titus Focus people, and if the idea for the stemmed vessels did
originate from vessels carried on this expedition, an additional
time marker is available for the Carpenter Site late component
graves.
Fig. 36 shows in graphical form the overlap of the radiocarbon
date with the time of the expedition and the probable time period of
the Carpenter Site late component graves. The earlier graves at
the site are represented by a shaded region on the chart.
As the later component graves at Carpenter did not overlap or
encroach on the earlier ones, the people who selected the locations
of the late component graves must have been aware of the earlier

TUCK CARPENTER SITE

graves¯ Some form of marker must have been present such as depressions in the ground or small mounds marking their locations.
Wooden markers or piles of brush may have been employed. No
grave markers of any sort were found at the Carpenter Site. Therefore, markings, if present, must have been with material that eventually deteriorated. One grave at the Johns Site had a post m01d
near the right shoulder region of the person interred¯ Whether this
represented a marker or part of a structure unrelated to the gr~ve
is unknown at this time.
/
The time period between the early and late componenfs at
the Carpenter Site had to be long enough for the popularity of
the pendant triangle rim design to reach full flower and fdr the
Talco arrow point to become the most popular type. Jusi how
long this time period would be in years is impossible to sa) with
any accuracy. Based on what few clues are available it is
estimated that the early graves preceded the late component
graves by no more than 50 years, and probably less.

CONCLUSIONS
The Carpenter Site
1. The Carpenter cemetery is attributed to peoples of th~ Titus
Focus.
/
2. The graves were placed during two different time/periods
with an unknown member of years separating these ~eriods.
3. The individuals had been placed in the graves in a supine
position with head to east and feet to west. The position of
the setting sun may have been the determining factor in
grave alignment.
4. If the "chalice"-like vessel of Crave 33 was engendered by
stemmed vessels of the De Soto expedil
- ..
ponent graves would probably date ~i~om near A.D. 1542. i~:((
5. Perdiz and Bassett arrow points we~e placed in the~-efffiiest ~\~
grav,
points coming later in time, and Talco )

last. The stemmed points were not abandoned bu~U
continued into the latest period.
6. Carinated bowls with a pendantifriangle decg~tiv’e motff’-~
were popular during the time pCrio~f~o~th~te component ~)
graves. This style had apparently not yet developed during’
the time period of the early graves.

7. Male and female graves both contained arrow points. Male
graves usually contained larger quantities however.
8. Wilder Engraved bottles continued as a popular type from
the early to the late component period.
9. Classic Ripley Engraved bottles were popular in the early
period but were not present in late component graves.
10. Deer mandibles and potters clay were almost exclusively
associated with female graves, pipes and evidence of fire
with male burials.
11. Graves containing two individuals were present among the
early component graves.
12. Ear ornaments, though not common, were present in male
graves more frequently than in female burials. More were in
the late component graves than in the earlier.
13. Copper was present in the form of a copper plate mounted
on one face of a sandstone earspool. Traces of copper were
present on fragments of wooden cymbal shaped ear or headdress pendants.
14. Trade vessels from the Texarkana and/or McCurtain foci
were present in several graves. A single vessel of Poynor
Engraved, or a replica thereof, indicates contact with Frankston Focus people.
15. Beamers of deer cannon bone, which have previously been
considered a Plains Indian trait, were present in one grave
in association with a gouge.
The Titus Focus
Conclusions concerning the Titus Focus are, for the Whelan
Complex, based primarily on the Harroun Site report (Jelks and
Tunnell 1959), the manuscript report on the Whelan Site (Davis
1958), and the summary of the Whelan Complex by Davis (1970).
For the cemeteries: field notes, artifacts, or published reports
concerning each site have been studied.
1. The time span of the Titus Focus encompassed at least part
of both the Caddo III and IV periods.
2. The earliest presently known sites which may be included in
the Titus Focus, or as directly ancestral to it, are those of
the Whelan Complex of the Caddo III period.

TUCK CARPENTER SITE

105

3. Principal overlap of radiocarbon dates for the Whelan
complex sites was between A.D. 1450 and 1550 and possibly
1650. Based on the probable date of the late component
graves at the Carpenter Site (1540’s), the author believes the
Whelan Complex sites could not be as late as A.D. 1550.
4. Whelan Complex and other early Titus Focus sites contained
sherds or vessels of Pease Brushed Incised pottery, a type
associated with the Bossier and Haley foci. This vessel type
disappeared as a recognizable type in later sites.
5. One or more of the Whelan Complex type sites contained
sherds of Titus Focus pottery types: Maydelle Incised, La
Rue Neck Banded, Bullard Brushed, Ripley Engraved, and
Taylor Engraved. Titus Focus vessel types not identified in
the Whelan Complex type sites which were present in later
sites were Wilder Engraved, Cass Applique, and Bailey
Engraved.
6. The trait of erecting mounds over burned structures, as in
the Whelan Complex, may have persisted into later Titus
Focus times; this has not yet been demonstrated by archeological evidence.
7. During the time span of the Titus Focus, arrow point types
changed. During the Whelan Complex period, types included
only stemmed forms: Alba, Bonham, Hayes, Perdiz, and a
bifurcate-stem type. Following these came Perdiz and Bassett
with occasional Maud points. Triangular point types, Maud
and Talco, then increased in popularity as Perdiz disappeared. In the last period, Bassett and Maud decreased in
popularity as Talco emerged as by far the predominant type.
8. Titus Focus burials in Northeast Texas were with the individual supine, head to east, and feet to west with most
graves oriented south of west and within the range of
seasonal variation in the point of sunset.
9. Graves usually contained only one person. At only two sites,
Ford and Carpenter, were graves present with other than
one person. Graves containing two individuals were present
at these sites; two graves at Carpenter and one at Ford.
10. The Titus Focus people left northeast Texas before goods of
European manufacture reached the area. Through native
trade, easily carried material such as iron knives and glass
beads could have been expected to reach the region by the
early 1600’s (Suhm, et al. 1954: 218).

II. The presence of Titus related people in the Toledo Bend
area is the first archeological evidence of a dispersal pattern of those from northeast Texas.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The property where t)3e site was located was owned by the late
Mrs. Tuck Carpenter and was administered by her niece, Mrs. Alice
Parker. During the time of the excavations, the land was leased to Mr.
Oren Reeves. Permission granted by these individuals to conduct these
excavations is gratefully acknowledged.
Several people allowed study of their collections. Among these are
Mr. Ralph Nicholas of Daingerfield, Mrs. Mavis German of Lone Star,
and Mrs. Roy Keeling of Upshur County.
The author is indebted to the following people for their help and
advice. Mr. T. W. (Tommy) Johns loaned many of his artifcts for study
and photographing and provided accurate and up-to-date information
on the Johns Site (41 CP 12). Dr. Clarence H. Webb of Shreveport,
Louisiana, provided unpublished information concerning the Belcher
and Gahagan Sites. Dr. Dee Arm Story suggested methods of data
presentation, provided information regarding various sites and made
the records and collections of the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory available for study. Dr. E. Mort Davis of The University of
Texas at Austin loaned out-of-print reports to the author. In addition,
through his good office, he arranged for the radiocarbon dating of the
sample from Grave 10 and for the sex determination, by Duncan
Wilson, of the skeletal material from the site. Dr. E. B. Jelks loaned a
copy of his doctoral dissertation, which provided the information on the
Sam Rayburn Reservoir area and the Angelina Focus. Norma Hoffrichter conducted both library and museum searches for me at
Southern Methodist University and at the University of Arkansas.
Mr. R, W. (Bob) Walsh, my colleague, was responsible for more
than his share of the approximately 125 tons of earth removed by
shovel and trowel during the excavations. Furthermore, he loaned his
artifacts for drawing and study and was responsible for much of the
photography and most of the preparation of the enlargements for the
pictures. Without his continuous help and support, this report would be
lacking.
I wish to thank my daughter Nancy who spent many hours during
her vacation, and after returning to school, editing and typing the
original manuscript.
Finally, I especially wish to thank my wife Gloria for her patience
during four years of pottery washing and reconstruction in the kitchen
and breakfast room and an additional five years of drawings and
drawing instruments, artifacts, strip charts, graphs, maps, reference
materials, and notes scattered about the house, Without her understanding, this report could never have been prepared.

Radiocarbon Chronology of Sites in
the Central Brazos VaUey
FRANK H. WATT

ABSTRACT
Two sites in the Central Brazes Valley of Texas, Horn Rock
Shelters nos. 1 and 2, provide a stratigraphic sequence of projectile
point types and associated materials that is supported by radiocarbon dates. The earliest dated type is the Brazos Fishtail point,
associated with crude scrapers, with uncorrected radiocarbon dates
about 8000 B.C. Plainview points are higher, with uncorrected dates
about 7000 B.C. The Brazos Fishtail and Plainview assemblages
represent the first well-dated Paleo-Indian components in this area.
There follows a gap in the sequence, Pedernales points being next
with corrected dates about 2000 B.C. Above them are Marcos points,
about 500 B.C., and finally Perdiz points about A.D. 1300.

INTRODUCTION
This paper reports radiocarbon dates from components
ranging in age from earlier than 8000 B.C. to about A.D. 1400 in the
Central Brazos river valley of Texas. It provides the first firm
chronological evidence for Paleo-Indian occupation of the valley.
The Central Brazos is that portion of the valley between the
junction of the Clear and Salt Forks near Graham, forming the main
stream of the Brazos, and the mouth of the Little River below Waco
(Fig. 1). The Little River carries also the discharge of the Leon
River, in whose valley Paleo-Indian materials have been dated
(Watt 1961). The Leon was the main stream of the Brazos in the
Pleistocene Epoch, until the Clear Fork pirated its headwaters and
the Leon became a tributary (Lewand 1969).

THE SITES
Most of the dates reported here are from two sites, Horn Rock
Shelters nos. i and 2, below Whitney Dam on the Brazos River. Two
of the dates are from the Aycock Shelter and the Clark Midden,
farther down the river. The stratigraphy of the sites is reviewed
briefly here, with reference to the radiocarbon dates presented in
a later section.
Horn Rock Shelter no. 1. This site is numbered 39B5-48 in the
author’s records and 41 BQ 47 in the files of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at the Balcones Research Center of The
University of Texas at Austin. It is a recess in a bluff overlooking
the Brazos, and is about 50 feet long and 20 feet deep. Excavations
beginning in 1960 by the author and associates have explored 8 ft.
of stratified fill but have not reached the floor of the shelter.
The top three feet of sediments in the shelter were sterile red
alluvial sands. They lay on a surface, the top of a midden deposit,

CENTRAL BRAZOS VALLEY

113

In the lower part of the red alluvial sands was a lens of
cemented red sandstone, adhering to the bottom of which were
several Plainview points. Date #11 belongs stratigraphically to
this level.
Under the red alluvial sands was a deposit up to five feet
thick (and in places more), consisting mostly of gray roof spalls.
Dividing this stratum into upper and lower parts was a layer of
calcified limestone two inches thick. Dates #14 through #17 were
from the upper part of the gray cave fill, in which occurred
artifacts of the "Crude Scraper Culture" (described above in
connection with Horn Shelter no. 1), Brazos Fishtail points, and a
double burial in a rock-covered pit. Brazos Fishtail points (Fig. 7),
a new form described here for the first time, have wide lanceolate blades and short expanding stems with small rounded
ears. The bases are concave, and flakes have been removed
upward from the base, producing a peculiar fluting, The range
of dimensions is: length, 35 to 70 mm.; maximum width, 26 to 34
ram.; width of base, 22 to 26 mm.; maximum thickness, 6 to 7
mm.
In the lower part of the gray cave fill were several lenses of
red sand, in one of which was a fragmentary Folsom point. In
another such lens near the bottom of the unit (see Fig. 8) were
charred bones, dart points of an unidentified fishtail form (Fig. 4,
b) different from the Brazos Fishtail, and a stone discoidal of the
same material, three inches in diameter.
At the bottom of the gray cave fill were the bones of a large
testudinate turtle, probably Geochelone or Gopherus, from which
Date #19 was determined (see Fig. 8).
Below the gray cave fill was a 6-inch layer of washed river
gravels containing animal bone fragments and a human tooth.
The gravels overlay four inches of heavy red clayey sand that
rested on the floor of the shelter.
In terms of projectile point sequence, we can see five dated
horizons in Horn Rock Shelter no. 2. From latest to earliest they
are: (1) Perdiz points in the upper red alluvial sands; (2) Marcos
points lower in the same sands; (3) Pedernales and Gary points
in the lower part of the same sands; (4) Plainview points in a
calcified red sand layer; (5) Brazos Fishtail points in the upper
part of the gray spall stratum. As will be seen, the radiocarbon
dates support this sequence. The points in the lower part of the
gray spall stratum are not dated, although the bone date from

on which the sample for Date #1 (see "The Dates," below) lay.
At a depth of approximately five feet the deposits were
uniform Archaic deposits. Dates #6 and #9 came from these
deposits.
A stratum of calcified sand, in which two Plainview points
were found, sloped southward from 50 to 90 inches below the
surface over a distance of 35 feet. It varied in thickness from six to
15 inches. Dates #12 and #13 apply to this stratum.
Below the Plainview stratum was the earliest occupational
stratum in the shelter, containing crude flake scrapers of blue-gray
chert with a greenish undertone and a grainy patina. The scrapers
varied in dimensions from about 4 x 6 cm. to 7.5 x 12.5 cm., the
maximum thickness being about 1.3 cm. The author has called this
scraper assemblage at Horn no. 1 the "Crude Scraper Culture"
(Watt n.d.). Date #18 came from this stratum.
Horn Rock Shelter no. 2. This is site 39B5-55 in the author’s
records and 41 BQ 46 in the files of the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory. Like the near-by Horn Rock Shelter no. 1, it
is a recess in a bluff overlooking the Brazos. It is about 150 feet
long and 25 feet deep, with a ceiling about 13 feet high. Originally it
contained more than 25 feet of sediments. It has been under investigation since 1960 by the author and his associates.
Some 90 inches of the highest sediments in the shelter had
been removed during the past century in connection with the use of
the shelter as a residence by an Anglo-American. At the back of the
shelter a yellow clay deposit survived.
More than 48 inches of red alluvial sands made up the next
lower unit. Lenses of gravel and cemented red sandstone occurred within this stratum. From near the top came Date #2, at a
level also containing Perdiz points. Stratigraphically lower,
under a large slab of roof fall, were Dates #4 and #5, associated
with Marcos points. Still deeper were Dates #7 and #8, associated with Gary and Pedernales points and bone fishhooks.

~............

In much of the shelter the division between Paleo-Indian anff~ ......................
Archaic deposits was not sharp, but in one place there was an
eroded remnant of Paleo-Indian deposits, from the surface of
which came Date #10, representing the beginning of the Archaic
occupation. There were no diagnostic materials in association. In
terms of projectile point styles, there appears to be no Early
Archaic occupation of the site.

the bottom of the stratum suggests they are not much older than
those in the upper part.
Aycock Shelter. This site, now destroyed, is 39D4-12 in the
author’s records and 41 BI 28 at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory. It was in the Leon River drainage north of
Belton, about 50 miles south of the Horn Rock Shelters. It contained more than 40 unstratified burials of varying complexity
and age, laid on ascending rock ledges and covered by earth.
The author excavated many burials at this site in 1935 as part
of the first project of the Central Texas Archeological Society
(Watt 1936). Date #20 is from this site.
Clark Midden. This is site 39B5-25 in the author’s records
and 41 ML 39 at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory.
It was a midden stratum (now destroyed) about 1 ft. thick, below
16 to 20 inches of sterile alluvial sand, on a river terrace fragment in the Brazos Valley above Waco, some 20 miles below the
Horn Rock Shelters. The author found large animal bones, Perdiz
points, Canton Incised and Sanders Engraved sherds, and a fragment of a bone beamer, in a rock-lined hearth that was the only
feature at the site (Watt 1965). Date #3 is from this site.

THE DATING LABORATORIES AND
THEIR PROCEDURES
There are several methods by which radiocarbon assays are
determined, the most common being by proportional counting of
carbon dioxide or methane gas and by liquid scintillation
counting of benzene. Once dates have been determined, the
standard form for reporting them is to give (1) the sample number with a prefix indicating the laboratory; (2) the age of the
sample in years before A.D. 1950 (this is the age B.P., i.e. Before
the Present, and is calculated using a half-life of 5568 years); (3)
a plus-or-minus figure representing one standard deviation (the
one-sigma error) derived from the counting statistics.
This way of reporting dates is followed by all laboratories in
publishing their dates in the international journal Radiocarbon.
However, at the time many of the Central Brazos Valley dates
were determined, a number of laboratories had not adopted this
procedure, so that the dates given the author were not all in this
form.

116

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Three laboratories made the radiocarbon determinations
that are reported in this paper: the Magnolia Petroleum Company laboratory, later called the Socony-Mobil Oil Company
Laboratory; the Shell Development Company laboratory; and the
laboratory of The University of Texas at Austin. Their
procedures for dating and reporting varied, and are reviewed
here.
The Magnolia Petroleum Company laboratory, which dated
by proportional counting of methane gas, changed its name from
Magnolia to Socony-Mobil in 1959 when the parent company
changed its name. The laboratory is no longer active. Magnolia
sample numbers have the prefix "FRL RC-"; Socony-Mobil
samples have the prefix "SM-". The laboratory reported its
dates to the author as years before the year of measurement. In
the case of the Magnolia dates the year of measurement was
1956; with the Socony-Mobil dates it was 1964. Otherwise the
dates were reported in the standard manner. They have not
been published by the laboratory (H. F. Nelson, Mobil Research
and Development Corporation, written communication to E.M.
Davis, University of Texas at Austin; Bray and Burke 1960: 97).
The Shell Development Company laboratory, which also is
no longer active, dated by proportional counting of carbon
dioxide gas. The laboratory never published dates and has not
used a prefix for its sample numbers; "Shell Devel." is used in
this paper. This laboratory, in planning work on the Central
Brazos Valley samples, considered the feasibility of three different counting times: 12, 24, and 48 hours. A 12-hour count was
dismissed as resulting in too large a standard deviation, whereas
a 48-hour count was rejected because, although it results in a
small deviation and is thus more precise, it is prohibitively
expensive. A 24-hour count was decided on as being satisfactory
from the viewpoint of both deviation and expense (E. L. Martin,
Shell Development Compar~y, personal communication). This is
the usual counting time in most laboratories. The Shell
laboratory measurements were made in 1967, and were reported
as years before 1945, using a half-life of 5760 years and with a
plus-or-minus of two standard deviations (D. R. Lewis, Shell
Development Company, written communication to E. M. Davis).
The University of Texas at Austin laboratory dates by liquid
scintillation counting of benzene. The prefix for its sample
numbers is "Tx-". The Central Brazos Valley samples dated by

was the turtle-bone sample of Date #19, which was dated in 1978
and received special treatment, as discussed later in connection
with that date. The laboratory plans to publish these dates in a

DATING ASSOCIATED SAMPLES OF SHELL
AND CARBONIZED MATERIAL
It is possible to speak of two kinds of association of radiocarbon samples. In the case of association in the broad sense,
different deposits in a site are associated in being parts of the
contents of that site; they have their individual characteristics,
and radiocarbon dates from different deposits in the site are
compared with that in mind. By contrast, association in the
specific sense refers to datable materials of different natures
that are intermingled within the same deposit, and that are
therefore demonstrably of the same age.
This second type of association was observed in four places
in Horn Shelter no. 2, the associated materials being snail shells
(Bulimulis} and carbonized material (woody charcoal and carbonized bone). Among the radiocarbon dates reported in this
paper are measurements on these four cases of specifically associated materials, in order to see how their dates migh compare.
These are Dates nos. 4-5, 7-8, 14-15, 18-17. To assure comparability in these cases, all the dating was done in one laboratory
(the laboratory of The University of Texas at Austin) and within
a relatively short time. In the field, the associated materials
were collected at the same time.
As will be seen, the snail shells always gave older dates
than the carbonized matter, although the differences are not
striking when the plus-or-minus is taken into account. The
greater age of the snail shell dates is due to the fact that in
building the calcium carbonate of their shells the snails incorporated some environmental lime, which because of its great
age has no radiocarbon left. Thus in the shell the contemporary
carbon, which is derived from the organic materials eaten by the
snail, has been diluted with the "dead" carbon from the lime in
the soil, and the shells give falsely old dates. This is a situation
which, in radiocarbon dating, must be checked anew for each
kind of mollusc and for each type of environment (Tamers 1970).
The snail shell dates also have smaller standard deviations
(the plus-or-minus) than the dates from carbonized material, but
this results from the sample size, not from the nature of the
material; the shell samples were larger than the carbonized
samples. In a radiocarbon date, the main determinants of the
"plus-or-minus" deviation are the age and size of the sample and

CENTRAL BRAZOS VALLEY

119

the length of the counting time. In these cases the ages of the
shell and carbonized samples were the same, since they were associated in the specific sense. The counting times in the
laboratory were the same. Only the sample sizes (and of course
the nature of the material in the samples} differed.

THE RADIOCARBON DATES
Data on the radiocarbon dates for Paleo-Indian and later
cultures in the Central Brazos River Valley are listed here in
order from most recent to oldest (except for the last date, #21,
which is a modern check sample}. The information includes the
site, sample number, material dated, date expressed in radiocarbon years B.P. (before 1950} and A.D.-B.C., the date corrected
by dendrochronology (where possible} according to Damon et al.
(1974} and rounded to the nearest five years, and a discussion of
the archeological context.

Carbonized wild onion seeds made up the sample (Fig. 2,a).
Sixty-five of the onions were found in a rounded mound of
charcoal and ashes resting on top of the midden deposit. They
were covered with an overburden of 36 inches of sterile red
river sands. No artifacts were associated. It may well be that a
meal was being prepared when flood backwaters came in and
covered the baking mound without disturbing it, but driving the
people away. This date applies to the last occupation of the
shelter, as the Brazos then built up the overlying 36-inch sterile
sands that sealed off the shelter from further use. After this,
only a narrow talus of red sand remained.

This sample came from red river sands lying mostly outside
the overhang of Horn Rock Shelter no. 2. Stratification was
clear. The sample came from the 58 to 60 inch level, and was associated with the earliest occurrence of Perdiz points at the site;
it thus dates the latest of the five dated projectile point horizons
in this shelter. This is the most recent date from the site.

large animal bones including a bone beamer, Perdiz points, and
Sanders Engraved and Canton Incised sherds (Watt 1965}. The
beamer is a trait that could represent Plains or Mississippian
contact. This was the first radiocarbon date determined from the
Central Brazos Valley and is the only date applying to a bone
beamer. The author has published it previously {Watt 1961: 3278; 1965: 103}.

fell from the roof. Such slabs occurred throughout the Archaic
deposits in this shelter (Fig. 4,a). Marcos points were in this part

This sample was made up of charcoal fragments scattered

surface, without associated artifacts. A burial was within 24
inches laterally, eight inches vertically, of the fill from which the
charcoal fragments were recovered. The skeleton, tightly flexed,
was oriented east by 5° south. It was lying on the left side facing
south, the hands crossed in front of the face and the heels
touching the pelvis. Ten large rock slabs covered parts of the
burial (Fig. 5,a), the largest of which, weighing some 70 pounds,
had crushed the lower part of the skull and all the bones of the
torso. The hands and legs were in articulation. Measurement
from hip to knee was 17.5 inches. There was an extreme arthritic condition present, especially in the lower lumbar region.
The teeth were more worn and deteriorated than the author has
seen in any other burial in Central Texas.

the Archaic deposits. These fishhooks (Fig. 6) are of an eastern
type; the same materials and processes of manufacture have
been seen at Russell Cave in Alabama (Griffin 1974: 57) and elsewhere. This is their westernmost occurrence.

This sample was made up of charcoal fragments picked
from fill overlying a burial. Within one foot of the skeletal
material were three Bulverde points, one Pedernales point, two
small scrapers, two partial fishhooks, one small anvil stone, one
hammerstone, and an unusual number of small flint flakes.
Despite these indicators of Archaic age, the blade of what appeared to be a finely chipped arrowpoint was in the abdominal
area of the skeleton. It was 3.2 cm. long and 1 cm. in maximum
width, with straight, finely serrated edges terminating in a
needle-sharp tip. Lacking the stem, it is much the same as a
Perdiz point, and suggests that the burial might be deeply intrusive. Still, there are no other evidences of intrusion, and the
radiocarbon date together with the other artifacts clearly indicate an Archaic age. There was no visible indication of a
burial pit, although charcoal fragments and mussel shells were
more common than usual in this area.
The burial was partly covered with boulders. The largest
boulder, weighing some 40 pounds, extended from over the left
shoulder to over the mid-thorax. A thin triangular 15-pound rock
lay across the lumber region. Four smaller rocks lay alongside
the body and between the legs.
The skeleton lay on its right side, head northwest, facing
southwest. The arms and legs were partially flexed, the forearms parallel to the vertebral column and the right hand tightly
clenched. Much of the spine and ribs were disarticulated and
crushed by the weight of the overlying rocks. Evidences of ar-

These burned animal and bird bone fragments (Fig. 2,c)
were associated with a rock hearth lying on the eroded surface
of a remnant of deposits of Paleo-Indian age. No artifacts were
in immediate association, but the context is post-Paleo-Indian
and represents the beginning of the Archaic occupation in the
shelter. Gary and Pedernales points, bone fishhooks, and bone
pieces from which fishhooks were cut, were in the overlying
Archaic deposits.
Earlier, the Brazos River had deposited several feet of sediments of Paleo-Indian, and probably earlier, age. These sediments were then eroded away until only a small fragment
remained, cemented to the wall. A period of quiet ensued, before
the Archaic deposits began to build up, and the dated material is
from this time. Midway in the shelter, nine feet from the front at
a depth of 108 inches, was a rock hearth around which were
scattered numerous small fragments of animal bones, mostly
charred. Immediately in front of the hearth was a mixture of
limestone fragments, ashes, and bone fragments, in a lens six
inches thick and three feet square. Within this lens were 1100
charred bone fragments, 187 uncharted bone fragments, 200
snail shells, 80 fish vertebrae, and 70 gar scales. There were no
associated artifacts. The dated bones were from this concentration.

These snail shells were in the same stratigraphic position as
two Plainview points; thus, this is the fourth dated projectile
point horizon in the site. The points were cemented to the bottom
of a calcified red sand stratum varying from one to three inches
thick, the depth varying from 126 to 132 inches. There were
fewer than six snail shells in direct association with the Plainview points, so that it was necessary to utilize shells in the same
stratigraphic situation, as close as possible to the points. Since it
was not everywhere possible to distinguish the Paleo-Indian from
the Archaic deposits, only the shells nearest the Plainview points
were taken. The date is 900 years later than the Plainview assemblage date from Horn Rock Shelter no. 1 (Date #12, below},
but the points are different in form, and the variability inherent
in snail shell dating (Tamers 1970} minimizes the significance of
the difference.

As in Horn Rock Shelter no. 2, the Plainview stratum in
Horn no. 1 is a red calcified sand; it has been described in the
section entitled "The Sites", earlier in this report. There were
many charcoal flecks in the fill associated with a Plainyiew point
at 82 inches depth in this sand, but they were too small and
fragile to survive washing after collection. Accordingly, snail
shells were taken from the back dirt that had been dug from the
top 4 inches of the stratum; the distinctive red calcified sand
adhering to the shells readily identified their provenience.

These specimens are from the upper part of the gray cavespall stratum, which contained Brazos Fishtail points (Fig. 7) and
scrapers of the "Crude Scraper Culture," as described earlier in
the section entitled "The Sites." This is the fifth and lowest
dated projectile point horizon in the site. The charcoal for Date
#14 was picked from the fill in Square 46 at depths from 150 to
160 inches; the snail shells of Date #15 came from the same
depth in Square 41.
Of particular interest in connection with these dates is a
double burial (Fig. 5,b) at 174 inches depth, at the bottom of the
stratum, resting on a thin layer of calcified limestone that
divided the upper from the lower gray cave spall strata. The
burial pit was 12 inches deep. This pit fill contained none of the
red sands of the Plainview stratum that overlay the 28 inches of
gray cave fill of the pit, and thus the pit must have originated in
the upper 16 inches of the gray fill, from which the materials
dated here were collected. The pit was covered with 19 limestone slabs of varying sizes.

at this level were scrapers of the "Crude Scraper Culture," as
described earlier. At Horn no. 2, these scrapers are associated
with Brazos Fishtail points and with Dates #14 through #17,
which agree with the present date. As noted in the site description, this is the oldest stratum at Horn no. 1, although at Horn

These bones of an extinct form of large turtle were at the
bottom of the gray cave spall stratum, resting on the surface of
the underlying washed river gravels. Thus, they were earlier
than the gray spall stratum, and were stratigraphically below
dates #14 through #17, which are much the same as this date.

132

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Judging from those dates and this one, the gray cave spall
stratum as a whole is around 10,000 years old.
Bones present special problems in radiocarbon dating, and
The University of Texas at Austin Radiocarbon Laboratory spent
extra time on these specimens (S. Valastro, Jr., L. S. Land, and
E. M. Davis, personal communication). The bones were inspected
by X-ray diffraction to insure that the chemical pre-treatment
was adequate and no contaminants (calcium carbonate in the
form of caliche) remained that might affect the dating. In addition, this inspection seemed to indicate that there had been no
recrystallization of the apatite fraction of the bone; recrystallization would make the date falsely young (however, apatite recrystallization is not well understood and is still being studied).
Mr. Valastro, who is in charge of technical operations at the
laboratory, prefers to date both the collagen and the apatite
fractions in bone, as checks on each other. In this sample, unfortunately, there was too little collagen (0.01 gin.) to date. The
apatite fraction also was small, but the date was obtained by
counting for three days. In addition a ’3C/’2C ratio was determined by mass spectrometry and a correction made for fractionation.
Dr. Ernest L. Lundelius, Jr., of the Laboratory of Vertebrate
Paleontology, Balcones Research Center, University of Texas at
Austin, identified the bones. He has been making a study of these
extinct large turtles, and he notes (personal communication) that
up to now the weight of evidence was that they became extinct
long before 10,000 years ago. This suggests that the bones were
actually considerably older than their radiocarbon age, a
possibility also suggested by their stratigraphic relationship to
dates #14 through #17. However, Dr. Lundelius also feels that
because of this date and other recent evidence, there must be a
reexamination of current ideas on the time of extinction of the
large tortoises in this region. In other words, if this date is
falsely young the error is not necessarily very great.
It is unfortunate that a larger sample, which would have
permitted more definitive dating, was not available at this level
in Horn Rock Shelter no. 2. Nevertheless, even as it stands this
date is significant in supporting the 10,000-year age of the gray
cave spall layer, and in presenting the possibility that large
turtles became extinct in this area more recently than has
previously been thought.

Charcoal

More than 10,000 years

This specimen was woody charcoal from burials excavated in
1935 at Aycock Shelter in the Leon River basin (Watt 1936; see
the description in "The Sites" section of this paper.) The date
has been published previously (Watt 1961: 327). The Magnolia
Laboratory reported that this specimen contained too little
carbon to give a reading, but this it appeared to be more than
10,000 years old. Based on this judgement and recent studies of
the Leon River Basin (Lewand 1969), the author suggests a minimum age of approximately 11,000 years. Evidently the site was
used as a burial ground for a very long time, as other burials in
the shelter were more recent, as Suhm (1960: 90) has also noted.

Modern snail shells (Bulimulis)

Ultra-modern

The author collected these live snails from fields in the
vicinity of Horn Rock Shelter no. 2 in the summer of 1974. The
snails were in a hot-weather inactive period and were on small
semi-leafless bushes, six to 18 inches above the ground, exposed
to sun and wind. The University of Texas at Austin laboratory
found that the radiocarbon content of the shells was higher than
the normal modern amount (~’~C = + 286.38_+ 3.6%o). This indicates that the carbon in the lime of the shells came mainly
from organic food (and ultimately from the atmosphere) and not
from environmental limestone, and reflects the fact that atomic
and hydrogen bomb explosions have increased the normal atmospheric ’4C/’2C ratio. This evidence strengthens the validity of
the snail shell dates from the archaeological components at Horn
Rock Shelter no. 2, although the dated charcoal-shell pairs indicate that the shell dates are probably a little oder than the
true ages, as already discussed.

SUMMARY
Horn Rock Shelters nos. 1 and 2 provide a stratigraphic
squence (Fig. 8) of projectile point styles and associated
materials as recent as Perdiz points and as old as the Folsom
point and Brazos Fishtail points deep in Horn Shelter no. 2. The
radiocarbon dates reported here verify this sequence.
The stratigraphically deepest date from the two shelters is
the turtle bone date from Horn Shelter no. 2, Date #19, approximately 8200 B.C. This date does not apply directly to any
projectile point type, being deeper than fishtail points that are
different from Brazos Fishtail points, and than a fragmentary
Folsom point. This date may be falsely young, since the specimen
was stratigraphically below Dates #14 through #17, which are of
approximately the same radiocarbon age.
The oldest dates that apply to artifacts are Dates #14
through #18, which are associated with Brazos Fishtail points
and the "Crude Scraper Culture." Two of these dates are on
charcoal and three on snail shells. The dates are too old for
dendrochronological correction. Assuming the charcoal dates to
be the more accurate, this context dates (in uncorrected radiocarbon years) about 7500-8000 B.C. The shell dates are a few
hundred years older than the charcoal dates; this is to be expected in view of what we know about dates on snail shells in
limestone environments. The shell dates, and their support by
the check-date run on modern snail shells from the vicinity of
Horn Shelter no. 2, reinforce the case for the antiquity of this
horizon. These dates refer to Paleo-Indian times in this area, and
for this reason the double burial in Horn Shelter no. 2 is of
particular interest since documented human skeletal remains of
this age are exceedingly rare in the Western Hemisphere. The
tentative date of more than 10,000 years ago from burials in the
Aycock Shelter may mean that some of those burials also date
from Paleo-Indian times, although field evidence indicated that
most of the burials in the site were later.
More recent in the Horn Shelters are Plainview points, associated in both sites with a layer of red calcified sand. The uncorrected dates (again, these dates are too old to be within the
range of correction) are nearly as old as those for the Brazos
Fishtail points--7500 B.C. on snail shells and mussel shells in
Horn Shelter no. 1 (Dates #12 and #13} and 6500 B.C. on snail
shells in Horn no. 2 (Date #11}.

CENTRAL BRAZOS VALLEY

There is a gap in the sequence between the Plainview
horizon and the next projectile point horizon above, indicated by
three pieces of evidence: the absence of Early Archaic points in
the sequence, a considerable gap in the radiocarbon dates, and
the erosion seen in the vicinity of Date #10, about 5100 B.C. (uncorrected), which rests on an eroded surface.
The next higher dated point horizon is characterized by
Pedernales points, and the dates (#7, #8, #9) are roughly from
1800 to 2500 B.C. These are dendrochronologically corrected
dates.
Above this are Marcos points, in Horn no. 2, with corrected
dates about 500 B.C. (Dates #4 and #5}.
Last and most recent of the dated point associations are the
Perdiz points in Horn no. 2, about A.D. 1300 (corrected; Date #2),
agreeing with the date for Perdiz points in the Clark midden
(Date #3).
The radiocarbon chronology presented here agrees with
previously published chronologies from other sites in Central
Texas (e.g., Sorrow et al. 1967: 142}. Thus, we have established
in the Central Brazos Valley a dated sequence of projectile point
styles extending from Paleo-Indian times to the final stage of
local prehistory.

Archeological Investigations at
Scorpion Cave (41 ME 7)
Medina County, Texas
LYNN HIGHLEY, CAROL GRAVES, CAROL LAND
AND GEORGE JUDSON

ABSTRACT
During the early summer of 1971, archeological investigations
were conducted at the Scorpion Cave site in northeastern Medina
County, Texas. The cave is located above the western floodplain of
the Medina River in the lower level of 80-foot bluffs. Large amounts
of occupational debris were recovered from cave deposits, indicating
that the cave was occupied throughout the Archaic period and into
Late Prehistoric times. Historic materials were also present in the
cave. Studies of faunal remains from the site are provided.

INTRODUCTION
In June and July of 1971, excavations were carried out at the
Scorpion Cave site (41 ME 7), which is located on the Medina River
about .5 mile downstream from the Medina Lake Dam (Fig. 1.).
Excavations at the site were carried out by a group of amateur
archeologists, including co-authors Carol Benson Land and George
Judson. The group worked to extensively excavate archeological
deposits within the cave; they also investigated the area outside
the cave mouth, but no occupational evidence was present.
Participants in the excavations at Scorpion Cave included coauthors Land and Judson, assisted by Perry Haass, the late Maxine
Benson and Ruth Judson. Carol Land kept a diary of the proceedings, including excavation notes and maps. Site photographs were
taken by Pete Farmer.

Co-authors Graves and Highley were not present during the
excavation. Therefore, the discussion of excavation procedures, as
well as many portions of the remainder of the paper, is based upon
excavators’ notes supplemented by input from George Judson.
The authors would like to acknowledge the advice and
criticism of Thomas R. Hester. His help was invaluable and greatly
appreciated. We would also like to thank Thomas C. Kelly for
assistance with artifact photography and identification; Anne A.
Fox for historic artifact identification and suggestions on various
aspects of the paper; Richard McCeehee for information on the
geological composition of various artifacts; Sam Nesmith for identification of cartridge cases; and John S. Graves, Jr. for assistance
with site maps and photographs. We would also like to acknowledge those who participated in the 1971 excavations upon which
this report is based.

ARCHEOLOGICALBACKGROUND
Less than 30 prehistoric sites have been recorded in Medina
County. Patterson (1975) has studied the blade technology at
quarry site 41 ME 3, and has recorded sites 41 ME 9-17, all in
northern Medina County (Hester and Kelly 1976). In 1976, the
Center for Archaeological Research, The University of Texas at
San Antonio, excavated four sites (41 ME 18-21) near Natalia,
which is located in southeast Medina County (ibid). In 1975, the
Texas Historical Commission carried out historic site excavations
at the Landmark Inn in Castroville (see Hester 1975a). Little else is
known about the archaeology of Medina County. Suhm (1960)
should be consulted for a general overview of the archeology of the
central Texas region.
Four major chronological periods can be discerned in central
and south central Texas prehistory. The Paleo-Indian period (ca.
9200-6000 B.C.) is represented primarily by random finds of dart
points such as Clovis, Folsom, Plainview, and Golondrina (see
Sollberger and Hester 1972; Hester 1971). Five Folsom points were
found in the backdirt left by looters at the Kincaid site in nearby
Uvalde County (Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks 1954; Sellards 1952;
Wormington 1957). A Plainview point was found eroding from a
bluff upstream from Scorpion Cave (George Judson and Harvey
Smith, Jr., personal communication). Several Plainview points were
recovered during 1977 excavations at the St. Mary’s Hall site

{Hester 1978; see also Hester 1975b and Cantu, Lauderdale and
Stoner 1976).
The Archaic period (ca. 6000 B.C.-A.D. 500/1000) is represented by numerous sites containing a great variety of dart
points, bifaces and unifaces, and by the appearance of grinding
stones. Burned rock middens are also characteristic of this time
span. The current state of the Texas Archaic has been reviewed
in a group of papers edited by Hester [1976). For information on
internal divisions of the Archaic, Johnson, Suhm, and Tunnell
(1962) should be consulted. Weir (1976) has synthesized recent
data on the Central Texas Archaic and has proposed an alternative chronological sequence. Many of the projectile points from
Scorpion Cave date to the Archaic period. Near the cave are
several burned rock middens.

The Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 500/1000-historic contact)
is characterized by the appearance of arrow points and pottery.
Most of the projectile points from Scorpion Cave date to this
period. No pottery was recovered, but the presence of clay
nodules was noted; field records do not indicate whether or not
these were baked.
The Historic period begins with the arrival of the
Europeans. Sites dating from this period include missions,
ranches, and structures built by the early settlers. Other than
Spanish mission sites in which Indian quarters are found, very
few sites representing historic Indian groups have been recorded
(Hester 1975b).
An ethnographic summary of central Texas Indian groups
has been prepared by Newcomb (1973). The

culture

of the

Payaya, a Coahuilteco-speaking group of the south central Texas
area, has been described by Campbell (1975). Included in this
paper is information about the protohistoric lifeway of Payaya
tribes along the Medina River, south of Scorpion Cave.
Ethnohistoric accounts researched by Campbell refer to groups
camping on the Medina River, near the present boundary between Medina and Bexar Counties. Pecan groves along the
Medina River and the abundance of game, especially bison,
seemed to account for Payaya encampments in this area.

THE SETTING
The site is situated 150 yards west of the present channel of
the Medina River. The cave mouth faces east, with an old river
channel situated halfway between the cave and the present river
channel. The site is within the Medina Canyon, which is about
116 miles in length, extending from Bandera County southeast
into Bexar County (Fig. 2, A).
The cave mouth sits about 20 feet above the present river
level, with bluffs rising approximately 80 feet above the cave
(Fig. 2, B). On the opposite bank of the river are gravel terraces
and a lower river bluff.
The floodplain is characterized by a heavy vegetation cover.
Trees are represented by many large elm, pecan, poplar, and
live oak in the floodplain, with cypress and willow along the
river. Also present are cedar, laurel, buckeye, walnut, persimmon, and hackberry. Plants include guajillo, agarita, yucca,
kinikinik, numerous grape vines, and assorted weeds and
flowers. There are also a variety of native grasses.
The cave is located in the northeast section of Medina
County. The northern portion of the county is hilly and broken
along the Balcones Escarpment. The site is on the southwestern
edge of the Edwards Plateau, a rugged area of Comanchean
Cretaceous limestone dissected by numerous rivers and stream
beds of the area. The remainder of Medina County is rolling,
partly brush-covered, with some fertile valleys. The site is also
within the southern portion of the Balconian Biotic Province
(Blair 1950: 112-115). The climate of the Balconian is semiarid
and mesothermal, with rainfall decreasing from east to west.
Average annual precipitation in Medina County varies from 28
to 30 inches (Carr 1967: 4). Mean temperature range is 42 to 96
degrees, with altitude varying from 600-1900 feet (Texas
Almanac 1976-1977: 333).
The Medina River rises in northwestern Bandera County,
flowing southeast to the San Antonio River, and having a length
of 116 miles. It is a springfed stream (ibid: 117). According to
Blair (1950), "The floodplains of the streams are occupied by a
mesic forest of large live oaks, elms, hackberries and pecans.
Along the Medina River, in the southeastern part of the
province, large cypress trees (Taxodium distichum) fringe the

144

stream course." This description is characteristic of the Scorpion Cave environment.

THE CAVE
The mouth of Scorpion Cave faces east, toward the Medina
River, which flows generally north to south. The floodplain
slopes upward from the river to the cave mouth, which is located
some 150 yards west of the river and approximately 20 feet
above present water level. However, the old river channel is only

75 yards east of the cave.
The mouth of the cave measures 19 feet at maximum (Fig. 3,
A). The cave interior consists of a roughly circular area extending 17 feet into the bluff; the maximum height of this room is
approximately 6 feet. A shelf of about 1.5 feet in height extends
along the south wall of the room. From this outermost room, a
passageway of 7 feet maximum width runs 20 feet at a 30
degree angle to the opening (Fig. 3, B). The shelf continues along
the south side of this passage, with another shelf along the
opposite wall. At the end of the passage, a second passage 6 feet
in width extends for another 19.5 feet at a 90° angle from the
first. Then, a third passage, of 4 feet maximum width, continues
for 17 feet at a 30° angle from the second. The cave ends at this
point. Between the second and third passages is a larger area, 7
feet wide and 6 feet high; a chimney (with a slight updraft) found
in the ceiling of this area extends upward into the bluff above.
(See Fig. 4 for diagram of cave interior.)

EXCAVATION PROCEDURES
Excavations were carried out in the outermost circular area
of the cave and in the first passageway (see Fig. 4), as well as
outside the cave mouth. The basic excavation strategy was
"vertically-oriented". Units were laid out in four-foot squares
wherever feasible; contours of the cave necessitated differentlyshaped units in some areas. Excavations were carried out in sixinch arbitrary levels. All excavated materials were passed
through 1¼,, mesh and were bagged according to unit and level.
Large amounts of charcoal, chert debris, bone, snail and mussel
shell were saved along with all artifacts.

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Many large rocks in front of the cave mouth were removed
to facilitate excavations. Portions of the deposit in units located
across the mouth were derived from spalling of the cave ceiling;
consistency was that of a fine powder and it was gray in color.
Toward the front of these units the deposits were comprised of a
dark humus soil and burned rock. Medium-sized land snails
prevalent in the cave probably represent a food source for
prehistoric inhabitants.
As excavations proceeded, large rock spalls from the cave
ceiling were uncovered in the units. A red clay gravel was
reached in some areas at the lower levels. Several hearths were
uncovered in the outermost circular room at depths of approximately 36 inches; associated artifacts found nearby may be
the result of knapping sessions around a fire, with heattreatment of raw materials a part of the knapping process.

DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTIFACTS
The excavations at Scorpion Cave resulted in the recovery
of 682 prehistoric artifacts. The following broad categories were
established through the analysis of the specimens: Chipped Stone
Artifacts (including Projectile Points, Other Bifaces and
Unifaces), Painted Artifacts, Ground and Pecked Stone Artifacts,
Bone Artifacts and Shell Artifacts. The various classes of artifacts in each of these categories will be described in the
following section. Projectile points were generally sorted according to the typology of Suhm, Krieger and Jelks (1954). All
measurements are in millimeters with incomplete measurements
in parentheses. Dimensions are indicated by the following abbreviations: L: length; MW: maximum width; MT: maximum
thickness; SL: stem length; SW: stem width; and NW: neck width.
WT: weight, is in grams, and is given for complete specimens
only. Vertical provenience data are provided in Table 3. Terminology used in the projectile point descriptions is defined by
the sketch in Figure 5.

& 8). The predominant point type at

Scorpion Cave, these points are characterized by deep corner notches, a broad
concave base, and a stem as wide or wider than the shoulders. The triangular
blades are straight or slightly concave; many are serrated. Edwards points were
first described by ]. B. Sollberger (1967). He believes that the Edwards point was
the first arrow point form in the Edwards Plateau region and was patterned after
dart point forms, such

as

Frio, Ensor, Fairland, Martindale, Pedernales, and

Uvalde. A discussion incorporating new data on the type followed a few years
later (Hester 1970). In this paper and a subsequent site report (Hester 1971),
Edwards points recovered at the La ]ita site in northeastern Uvalde County were
described. The 1977 UTSA Archaeological Field Course recovered a number of
Edwards points at the St. Mary’s Hall site, 41 BX 229 (Hester 1978), and they
were also found during an extensive survey of the Camp Bullis area in northern
Bexar County (Gersfle, Kelly and Assad 1978). Radiocarbon data for Edwards
points have been obtained from two sites. A date of A.D. 1054 was assigned to a
stratum containing Edwards points at a site on Camp Bullis (ibid); dates of A,D.
960 and A.D. 930 come from the La ]ita site (Hester 1971). The Edwards type
represents 75%

of the arrow point total recovered from Scorpion Cave. Table 1

presents the measurements for the Edwards points from Scorpion Cave; weight is
included for complete specimens only.

FRESNO (5 specimens; Fig. 6, b-d). Two specimens are basal fragments; the
remainder are substantially complete. Bases range from slight convexity to slight
concavity. The triangular points are very thin, well-made specimens. L: (18-29);
MW: 15-21; MT: 3-4; WT: .7-1.2.
PERDIZ (5 specimens; Fig. 6, e-h). All of the specimens are fragmentary. Two
are worked unifacially except for bifacial flaking on the stems. Two have serrated
edges. L: (19-36.5); MW: 11.5-18.5; MT: 3-4; SL: 10-12; NW: 6.5-7.
SCALLORN (16 specimens; Fig. 6, i-v). Eight of these are essentially complete.
Bodies vary from broad to slender with edges slightly concave to slightly convex.
Stems are expanding, with bases varying from slight convexity to concavity. Body
edges of several specimens are finely serrated. Workmanship is generally good.
Measurements of essentialy complete specimens are: L: 23-27; MW: 13-31; MT:
2.5-5; SL: 4-6; SW: 10-17; NW: 6-11; WT: .7-2.2.
UNFINISHED (2 specimens; Fig. 9, a-b). One specimen appears complete but
probably represents an unfinished point since only one side has been notched. L:
45; MW: 16; MT: 4.5; SL: 6; SW: 7.5; NW: 10. The other specimen is the basal
fragment of a preform made on a flake. The preform has been side-notched; one
lateral edge has been bifacially trimmed, the other edge has been trimmed
unifacially. L: (27); MW: 18.5; MT: 3.5; SL: 7; SW: 12; NW: 9.
FRAGMENTS (116 specimens). Thirteen partial basal fragments are probably
broken Edwards points. Another basal fragment is probably a broken Scallorn

point. Eleven other arrow point fragments could not be classified. Sixty-eight
distal fragments and 23 medial fragments were also recovered. Most of these
arrow point fragments were in the upper three levels. Not illustrated.

DART POINTS
A total of 71 dart points was found; types included Bulverde, Castroville,
Early Triangular, Ensor, Frio, Kinney, Langtry, Marcos, Marshall, Martindale,
Montell, Nolan, Palmillas, Pedernales, Travis and Wells, as well as several
specimens that do not fit within existing taxonomy. Unfinished dart points and
dart point fragments are also described.
BULVERDE (1 specimen; Fig. 10, a). This incomplete specimen has only a
partial body, probably broken in manufacture, which is slightly convex. The stem
is contracting with a slightly convex base. L: (44); MW: 35; MT: 7; SL: 19; SW: 14;

EARLY TRIANGULAR (1 specimen; Fig. 10, f). This triangular point has been
alternately beveled along the right lateral edge. Similar points were found and
given this tentative label at the La Jita site (Hester 1971). L: 33.5; MW: (28); MT:
5; WT: 4.8.
ENSOR (19 specimens; Fig. 11). This type has been divided into six varieties
based on work by Johnson, Suhm, and Tunnell (1962) and Hester (1971).
Variety 1 (3 specimens; Fig. 11, a-c). Two specimens are complete; one is a

SCORPION CAVE ARCHEOLOGY

basal fragment. Of the complete specimens, one is very well made and the other is
unfinished. All three have side notches and straight or slightly convex bases. L:
(33.5)-38.5; MW: 19.5-26; MT: 5-9.5; SL: 8-15; SW: 19-24; NW: 13-21; WT: 2.8-8.8.
(Johnson’s Variety 1; Tunnell’s Variety A; Hester’s Variety 4).
Variety 2 (1 specimen; Fig. 11, d). This point resembles Variety 1 but the body
is alternately beveled. The point has side notches; the base is straight to convex.
L: 47.5; MW: 30; MT: 7; SL: 13.5; SW: 27.5; NW: 24; WT: 10.4. (Tunnell’s Variety

Variety 4 (8 specimens; Fig. 11, f-j). The bodies are triangular and have
straight or slightly convex edges. The points are side-notched. Bases are as wide
or slightly wider than the shoulders and have convex basal edges. Three of the
specimens are barbed. Two points are complete; six are fragmentary. Two fragments are badly burned and potlidded. One specimen is finely serrated along the
edges. L: (19)-54; MW: (21)-34.5; MT: (4.5)-8; SL: 8.5-11.5; SW: (19.5)-28.5; NW:
(14.5)-22; WT: 6-6.8. (TunnelFs Variety E).
Variety 5 (3 specimens; Fig. 11, k-m). These points resemble Frio points, but
their bases were straight before the removal of a central U-shaped notch ("EnsorFrio’). Bodies are triangular with straight or slightly convex edges. One specimen
has slight barbs. The stem is as wide, or slightly wider, than the shoulders. The
side notches are broad. L: (38)-43; MW: 26-29.5; MT: 5-7; SL: 9.5-12.5; SW: (26.5)28.5; NW: 17.5-18.5; WT: 6.8. (Tunnell’s Variety C).
Variety 6 (3 specimens; Fig. 11, n-o). These specimens are similar to Variety
5. They also have a central U-shaped notch, but the bases were not straight
before being notched. The specimens are fragmentary, but two have slight barbs.
The stems are wider than the shoulders. One point is burned and potlidded. L:
(44)-45.5; MW: (29.5)-33; MT: 5.5-8; SL: 9.5-12.5; SW: (24)-32; NW: 18.5-19,0; WT:
9.4. (TunnelFs Variety B).
FRIO (7 specimens; Fig. 10, c-e). Point tips are absent on three specimens;
another two are the basal halves. Bodies are triangular and fairly straight, with
shoulders average to strong, some with barbs. All bases are very concave, with

deep concave base. L: (43); MW: 32; MT: (7.5).
LANGTRY (1 specimen; Fig. 10, h). The potlidded basal fragment is strongly
barbed. The basal edge is slightly concave. L: (36.5); MW: (37.5); MT: (5); SL: 16;
SW: 11.5; NW: 13.5
MARCOS (2 specimens; Fig. 10, i-j). These incomplete specimens have
triangular bodies, one very broad, with straight edges. The stems are strongly
expanding with a straight base on the broader specimen, a slightly concave base
on the other. L: (36-37); MW: 30-35; MT: 7; SL: 8-9; SW: 13-26.5.
MARSHALL (2 specimens; Fig. 10, k-l). One specimen has no tip; the other

MARTINDALE (2 specimens; Fig. 10~ m). One specimen represents only the
basal end and is very small. The second is absent the tip and one edge of the
body. Both have expanding stems with a typical "fishtail" base, L: (12-32); MW:
(18-27); MT: 5-7; SL: 11; SW: 17.5-21; NW: 13-16.
MONTELL (5 specimens; Fig. 10, n-o). All are basal fragments. One specimen
is badly burned and potlidded; one shows patination. The bodies on the three
more complete specimens have straight or concave edges. They are cornernotched and the stems have a V-shaped notch in the center of the base. All three
are barbed. One point appears unfinished. L: (28.5-56); MW: (28-42); MT: 5.5-7.5;
SL: (9.5)-14.5; SW: (18)-28; NW: (18.5)-27.5.

patinated specimen exhibits crude workmanship. L: 49; MW: 22; MT: 8.5; SL: 21;
SW: 18.5; WT: 9.4.
PALMILLAS (1 specimen; Fig. 12, a). This complete specimen has a narrow
triangular body with slightly convex edges. The stem is expanding with a straight
base. Body edges are serrated; workmanship is good. L: 42; MW: 17; MT: 5; SL:
6.5; NW: 11; WT: 2.9.
PEDERNALES (13 specimens; Fig. 12, b-j). The specimens are morphologically
diverse. Only six are complete; several appear to be unfinished and were probably broken in manufacture. Bodies vary from triangular to leaf-shaped, with
straight or convex edges. Barbs are present on three of the points. Stems are 1/41/3 of total length. Variation from slight to deep concavity is present on the bases.
Workmanship varies from very good to crude, the latter possibly reflecting the
incomplete manufacturing stage of these points. Basal thinning frequently consists
of a single channel flake removed from the center of the base on both faces of the
stem. L: (36)-104; MW: 27-42.5; MT: 6-9; SL: 12-27; SW: 16-27; NW: 15-25; WT:
8.3-21.6.
TRAVIS (1 specimen; Fig. 12, k). This specimen has a triangular body with
slight rounded shoulders. The base is slightly convex. L: (52); MW: 25; MT: 7; SL:
12; SW: 14; NW: 16.
WELLS (1 specimen; Fig. 12, 1). This complete specimen has a slender
triangular body, small shoulders, and a long stem with rounded base. It is heavily
patinated. L: 61; MW: 21; MT: 8; SL: 24; SW: 15.5.

UNCLASSIFIED DART POINTS
The following dart points do not fit into any currentlydefined type.
GROUP 1 (1 specimen; Fig. 13, a). This point cannot be placed within the
existing taxonomy. The lateral edges are alternately beveled, resulting in a very
sharp point. The specimen has a convex base and broad corner notches. L: 57;
MW: 25; MT: 7; SL: 14; SW: 21; NW: 15; WT: 6.8.
GROUP 2 (2 specimens). This group consists of the stems of two dart points.
They have concave bases, but are not identifiable. They are too fragmentary for
measurement.

UNFINISHED DART POINTS
These eight points were abandoned at different stages in the
manufacturing process. They are divided into six groups.
GROUP 1 (1 specimen, not illustrated). This specimen has corner notches. The
body has pronounced convex edges. One side has traces of cortex on it. L: (35.5);
MW: 31.5; MT: 15.5; SL: 9.5.; SW: 18; NW: 18; WT: 9.7.

body flares out to a concave base; there is no stem. L: (51.5); MW: 34.5; MT: 8.5.
GROUP 3 (1 specimen, not illustrated). One fragmentary specimen consists
mainly of a base. One lateral edge has a side notch. The base is convex. L: (30);
MW: 35.5; MT: 8; SL: (1.5); SW: 50.3; NW: 29.
GROUP 4 (1 specimen, not illustrated). This fragmentary specimen is absent
the distal tip and part of the stem. It has a slight side notch on the intact side. The
base is concave; the lateral edges of the body are slightly convex. L: (45.5); MW:
(32.5); MT: 6; SL: (12); SW: (19.5); NW: (22).
GROUP 5 (1 specimen, not illustrated). This basal fragment has convex edges
and a long contracting stem with a concave base. L: (38.5); MW: 26.5; MT: 7.6;
SL: 16; SW: 16; NW: 18.
GROUP 6 (2 specimens; Fig. 13, c-d). These specimens have broad side
notches and the body has straight to slightly convex lateral edges. One has a
slightly convex basal edge; the other has a concave basal edge, with the tops of
the stem broken off. It is patinated and has a beveled stem. L: (54.5-57); MW: 3132; MT: 10-10.5; SL: 13.5-(14); SW: (20-23); NW: 19-19.5; WT: 15.4-17.0.

DART POINT OR LARGE BIFACE FRAGMENTS
The majority of these (84 specimens; not illustrated) seem to
be dart point fragments. There are 27 distal fragments, 26
medial fragments, and 31 miscellaneous fragments that are too
burned or broken to identify. Several medial fragments have part
of a shoulder remaining. Several of the fragments are patinated.

DART POINT PREFORMS
This

category

includes

134 bifacially

chipped

artifacts,

excluding projectile points, which are probably projectile point
preforms. Of this number, only 36 are substantially complete
specimens. On several of these cortex remains on one face
which may have been impossible for the knapper to remove,
resulting in their discard. A few of the basal fragments were
complete enough to sort into groups 1-8 with the complete
specimens, but most basal, medial, and distal sections were too
fragmentary to divide morphologically. Eleven groups are
described below.
GROUP 1 (2 specimens; Fig. 14, a, b). Narrow lanceolate outlines; the face of
one specimen has a thick lateral ridge with parallel flaking to either side of this
ridge. Fair workmanship. Straight to slightly convex bases. L: 65-69; MW: 21-24;
MT: 10-11.
GROUP 2 (3 specimens; Fig. 14, c, d). Ovate with convex bases. One is made
on a flake, with cortex covering the lower half of one face. L: 50-70; MW: 36.5-56;
MT: 12-13.
GROUP 3 (8 specimens; Fig. 14, e, f). Asymmetrical but generally ovate

SCORPION CAVE ARCHEOLOGY

165

outline and convex bases. Crude; two are badly scarred and poflidded. L: 40-64;
MW: 30.5-49; MT: 6-10.
GROUP 4 (11 specimens; Fig. 14, g, h). Triangular with straight to convex
bases. Thick and crude with some cortex remaining on most. Distal tip absent on
four specimens. L: 50-84; MW: 33-53; MT: 12-22.
GROUP 5 (7 specimens; Fig. 14, i, j). Triangular with straight edges and
slightly convex bases. Two are basal fragments; two are badly potlidded. One
specimen narrows sharply at the proximal end. Fair workmanship. L: 50-69; MW:
27.5-43; MT: 7-11.
GROUP 6 (12 specimens; Fig. 14, k, 1}. Triangular with convex bases and
edges. Two have missing tips; another three are basal fragments. Fair workmanship. L: 47-81; MW: 32-46; MT: 7-11.
GROUP 7 {6 specimens; Fig. 15, a, b). Small triangular outline; bases straight
to convex; crude workmanship. L: 41.5-53; MW: 27-30; MT: 7-10.
GROUP 8 (3 specimens; Fig. 15, c). Residual category. Very crude. One has
mostly cortex on one face and is rectangular with perforator-like tip. Others are
roughly triangular; one has cortex at the distal end; the other is badly poflidded.
The remaining three groups are bifacially worked artifacts too fragmentary
to classify more definitively.
GROUP 9 (22 specimens). Basal fragments. Several specimens are thinned
and exhibit fair workmanship. Others are crude and still have cortex remaining
on one or both faces. One specimen was made on a biface thinning flake. Several
specimens are poflidded; some are patinated. Not illustrated.
GROUP 10 {18 specimens). Medial fragments. Broken at various stages of
manufacture. Most of the medial sections are small. Not illustrated.
GROUP 11 (42 specimens). Distal fragments. Wide range in size, workmanship and stage of manufacture. Some with cortex, patination, and/or potlidding.
Not illustrated.

TRIANGULAR

BIFACES

(2

specimens;

Fig.

e-f).

Both

are

triangular in outline with moderately concave bases. Body edges are serrated;
workmanship is fair to good. These bifaces, from levels 2 and 3, were probably
utilized as knives. L: (79-110); MW: 31-41; MT: 6-10.
LARGE THINNED BIFACE (1 specimen; Fig. 13, g). This large but relatively
thin specimen was apparently broken during manufacture. Both halves were found
in Unit 1, the distal end in level 1 and the proximal end in level 2. Workmanship is good. L (combined halves): 121; MW: 60; MT: 12.
PERFORATOR (1 specimeni Fig. 13, h). This specimen has a rounded ovate
base with a long shaft. The tip is absent. L: 66; MW: 44; MT: 11; L (of shaft): 35.
BEVELED KNIFE (I specimen; Fig. 13, i). This medial fragment is alternately
beveled

along the

right

lateral

edges.

This

type of knife

dates to the

Late

Prehistoric (Hester and Parker 1970). A complete specimen was found on the
natural shelf in the cave but was not available for analysis. L: (36.5); MW: (23.5);
MT: (6).
CHOPPER [1 specimen; Fig.16, d). Several broad flakes have been removed
bifacially from one end of the cobble, forming a convex edge. The proximal end is
covered with cortex. L: 90; MW: 83.5; MT: 42.

CRUDE BIFACES. These differ from those artifacts in the preform category in
that the former represent crude percussion as opposed to controlled percussion
and some pressure flaking on the latter. Seven groups of thick, percussion-chipped
bifaces are described below.
GROUP 1 (6 specimens; Fig. 15, d). Ovate outlines. Thick, crude. Large flake
scars. Cortex on one or both faces. L: 63-85; MW: 46-70; MT: 18-38.
GROUP 2 (7 specimens; Fig. 5, e-f). Ovate outlines. Thick, crude. Large flake
scars. Cortex on one or both faces. L: 63-85; MW: 46-70; MT: 18-38.
GROUP 3 (2 specimens; Fig. 15, g). Small, ovate. Cortex on one face. L: 53-54;
MW: 34-44; MT: 14-16.
GROUP 4 (2 specimens; Fig. 15, h). Thinner; ovate outline. Cortex on one or
both faces. One is fire-fractured. L: 69-73; MW: 52-60; MT: 11-14.
GROUP 5 (1 specimen; Fig. !5, i). Very large ovate biface. No cortex
remaining. L: 96; MW: 81; MT: 21.
GROUP 6 (1 specimen; Fig. 15, j). Asymmetrical. Made on a flake. Cortex
remaining on each end. L: 51; MW: 46; MT: 13.
GROUP 7 (4 specimens). Fragmentary. Crude, some fire-fractured. Not illustrated.
CORES AND CORE FRAGMENTS (12 specimens). All have had flakes
removed bifacially. All but two have cortex remaining. On one of these, blade-like
flakes have been removed. Most of these specimens are natural platform cores. L:
55-81; MT: 23-40.

UNIFACES
RETOUCHED BLADES (5 specimens). By definition, a blade is a long, narrow
flake, the length being at least twice the width. One or more lateral ridges occur
on the dorsal surface. These five specimens show a series of patterned flake scars
along one or both edges. Two of the blades show only slight modification. One
blade has been retouched bifacially along one edge and unifacially on the other
edge. This blade is sharply pointed and twisted. Two blades are retouched
unifacially along both lateral edges. Use-wear analysis of blades from the central
and southern coast has shown that retouched blades were most often used as
cutting tools or knives, rather than as scrapers (Hester and Shafer 1975). L: 510.5; MW: 1-5; MT: .5-1.
UTILIZED BLADES (4 specimens). The edges of these blades have been
slightly modified by use-wear.
RETOUCHED FLAKES (29 specimens). These flakes have been finely
retouched along one or several edges. They have been divided into the following
categories.
FORM 1 (1 specimen). This secondary flake has been alternately retouched
along the lateral edges. L: 7; MW: 4; MT: 1.5.
FORM 2 (2 specimens). These two secondary flakes have been trimmed along
the lateral edges producing a pointed flake. L: 7-7.5; MW: 5-7.5; MT: 2-2.5.
FORM 3 [7 specimens). These have been retouched along most of the flake
perimeter. Three interior flakes have been trimmed unifacially; the four secondary flakes have been trimmed bifacially. L: 4.5-9.5; MW: 2-5; MT: .5-2.
FORM 4 (6 specimens). These flakes have been trimmed unifacially along
both lateral edges. Three of the flakes are interior; three are secondary. L: 5-10.5;
MW: 3-6.5; MT: 1-2.

MT: 8-16.

PAINTED ARTIFACTS
PAINTED PEBBLES (3 specimens; Fig. 17, a-c}. These pebbles show evidence
of black linear decoration. One oblong pebble has several intersecting black lines
painted on it; the design is very dim (L: 57; MW: 33; MT: 10}. A second oblong
specimen has three black parallel lines running lengthwise down the center of one
face {L: 53; MW: 32; MT: 19}. A third light brown oblong pebble has two black
parallel lines running the width of one face, slightly off-center; there are also
patches of red paint on this face (L: 63; MW: 35; MT: 20}. The occurrence of
painted pebbles in central Texas is very rare. A painted pebble was recovered
from Classen Rockshelter, 41 BX 23 (Fox and Fox, unpublished manuscript on file
at the Center for Archaeological Research, The University of Texas at San Antonio}. This specimen had black paint on one end; a design was not distinguishable. At the Goodrich Site, a waterworn limestone slab had red parallel lines
painted on both faces (Suhm 1960}. Hester {1977} recently reported a painted
pebble with red linear decorations from Zavala County in south Texas.
STAINED STONES {3 specmens; Fig. 17, d}. One oblong specimen, as well as
an ovate and a broken specimen, has reddish colorations on one or both faces.
They were probably used to grind hematite. A conglomeration of a reddish
material identified by Dr. Richard V. McGehee as hematite was also found in the
deposits. This material is not native to the immediate area. (oblong specimen, L:
83; MW: 40; MT: 18; ovate specimen, L: 75; MW: 69; MT: 13).

GROUND AND PECKED STONE ARTIFACTS
PITTED STONES (3 specimens; Fig. 17, e). All three specimens are limestone
and have a circular pitted area centrally located on both faces. Two stones are
ovate, while the larger stone is rectangular. Similar artifacts have been described
by Skinner (1971) and Word (1971). L: 85-138; MW: 68-91; MT: 43-60.5.
HAMMERSTONES (2 specimens). The smaller chert hammerstone evidences
battering on both ends. The larger hammerstone, made of limestone, shows
battering on only one side. L: 67-97; MW: 45-82.5; MT: 40-66. Not illustrated.
MANOS (2 specimens). Both are fragmentary and are made of limestone. The
larger mano is ovate with wear facets on only one face. The other is fragmentary
but appears to have been ovate in outline. It has wear facets on both faces. L:
35.5-79.5; MW: 75-80.5; MT: 38.5-48.5. Not illustrated.

BONE ARTIFACTS
BONE AWLS (8 specimens; Fig. 18, a-f). Four awls have been manufactured
from the split bones of a deer. Similar awls have been recovered from Baker Cave
and Red Mill Shelter (Word 1971). Word states that they do not need to be altered
to be useful as a tool. Three of the specimens show no alteration; one has been
sharply pointed (L: 44-54). Four broken awl tips were also recovered. Two are
burned; all evidence polishing. The top of one appears to be fire-hardened. L: 2056; MW: 5.5-12; MT: 2.5-4.5
DEER ULNA FLAKING TOOL (1 specimen; Fig. 18, g). The distal end has
been broken off. Well-defined scratches are visible along the sides of the
specimen, apparently used as a flaking tool. L: 77; MW: 30; MT: 13.5.
BONE BEADS (4 specimens; Fig. 18, h-i). One polished bone bead, made from
the radius-ulna of a hawk-sized bird, is incised. Three grooves are cut around the
bone and are filled with asphaltum. A fourth groove was started (L: 35; MW: 5.5).
A similar polished bone bead was also recovered. It is not incised and was made
from the radius of a vulture (L: 35; MW: 7.5). Two smaller, thicker beads were
made from the bones of a raccoon-sized animal. These beads are not as highly
polished; one is rodent-gnawed (L: 11.5-14; MW: 11-12.5). Two other bone
specimens might represent beads but are in such poor condition that identification
is not possible.
POLISHED BONE FRAGMENTS (9 specimens). All fragments show a high
degree of polishing. Several are burned.

SHELL ARTIFACTS
NOTCHED SHELL (1 specimen; Fig. 18, j]. This Rabdotus land snail has a
rectangular slit cut in it. Clark (1969) reviews many of the archeological sites in
Texas that have yielded shell ornaments. Most recorded examples are of snails
that were strung as beads, and this modified land snail might have been utilized
in that manner (L of snail: 22.5; L of notch: 10.5).

FLAKE ANALYSIS
The total amount of flakes that came out of the excavations
conducted at Scorpion Cave was not available for analysis. From
the flakes that were studied, it appears that the final stages of
biface reduction were carried out within the cave. The majority
of flakes are interior; comparatively, very few primary or
secondary flakes were present. Many of the flakes can be
classified as bifacial thinning flakes. Only 12 cores were found
in the cave; 135 preforms and 23 crude bifaces were recovered.
Units 13, 14, 15, 17 and 19 (see Fig. 4) contained large numbers
of flakes.
Many blades were also recovered from the deposits. Blades
are representative of a specialized flint&napping technique that
produces a long, narrow flake, which even unmodified has an
excellent cutting edge. The length of a blade is at least twice the
width and exhibits one or more lateral ridges on the dorsal face.
Retouched blades and arrow points made on blades were
analyzed and described earlier in the text. According to Green
and Hester (1973) blades are characteristic of the Late
Prehistoric period. Patterson (1973, 1976) has carried out extensive studies of blade technology in Texas.

HISTORIC ARTIFACTS
The Historic period is represented by a wide variety of
artifacts. Specimens of pottery, glass, metal, leather, and plastic
were recovered from Scorpion Cave. None of these can be attributed to a historic Indian occupation of the cave. Other than
several majolica fragments, the earliest items are Americanmanufactured and can be dated to the late 19th and early 20th
centuries. Other specimens date up to the present time.
Presumably the historic items were randomly carried into the
cave by campers, hunters or other transients. Due to the
relatively small number of specimens it is doubtful that they
represent any sort of long-term historic utilization of the cave. A
State Historical Commission marker at the site of the Medina
Dam indicates that 16 Mormon families under the leadership of
Lyman Wright settled there in 1854; the site was abandoned in
1858 due to Indian depredation. Present-day owners do not know
of any other settlements or structural remains in the immediate

area that date to the late 1800s and early 1900s which might
explain the presence of the older specimens.
Other caves and rockshelters in central Texas have also
contained historic artifacts as well as a prehistoric assemblage.
Kincaid Rockshelter in Uvalde County (Glen Evans, personal communication}, Oblate Rockshelter in Comal County (Johnson, Suhm
and Tunnell 1962}, and Classen Rockshelter in Bexar County
(unpublished manuscript on file at the Center for Archaeological
Research, The University of Texas at San Antonio) contained
historic metal and glass artifacts overlying prehistoric occupational debris.
The specimens from Scorpion Cave were scattered throughout the upper levels of most excavated units. The majority of
these items extended from the outermost units of the cave to
Units 19 and 20 (see Fig. 4); fewer specimens were found in the
rear passageway.
The following is a general discussion of the historic
specimens from Scorpion Cave:
CERAMICS
MAJOLICA (Fig. 19, a, b). Four fragments of European majolica probably date
to the late 19th century (Anne Fox, personal communication). The three body
sherds and one rim sherd have a green and yellow floral design on an off-white
background. There is a green band along the exterior rim.
MEYER’S POTTERY (Fig. 19, f). Twenty-eight fragments of Meyer’s pottery,
probably from the same vessel, date to the late 1800s and early 1900s (Anne Fox,
personal communication}. Founded in 1887, the Meyer Kiln was located in
Atascosa near San Antonio. It continued in operation until 1937. Meyer’s pottery
is distinguished by a red slip which results in mottled golds, browns, and greens
(Schuetz 1969}.
CRUCIBLE {Fig. 19, g). This fired clay fragment probably represents the lining
of a still (Anne Fox, personal communication}. The owners of the property report
that they have located the remains of a still near the cave.
MARBLE. This fired clay specimen was found in the rear of the cave.

GLASS
BOTTLE GLASS. 189 fragments of aqua, clear, amber, and green bottle glass
were found scattered throughout the upper levels of the cave deposits.
"GEBHARDT EAGLE" was imprinted on one of the clear bottle glass fragments.
GLASS STOPPER. One clear bottle glass stopper was recovered.

METAL
CARTRIDGE CASES (Fig. 19, d, e). Two of the cartridge cases found in
Scorpion Cave were manufactured in the latter half of the 19th century. One is a

Spencer rim-fire cartridge case which was manufactured during the Civil War
and into the early 1870s. This type cartridge case was the standard cavalry
carbine issued by the United States government after the Civil War. The other
cartridge case is tentatively identified as a .50-.55 Springfield carbine, dated to
ca. 1870 (Sam Nesmith, personal communication}. Both of these specimens were
found in Unit 7, level 3 (see Fig. 4). Other specimens include .22 caliber, .30
caliber, .32 caliber, .38 caliber, and Colt .45 caliber cartridge cases.
BRIDLE FOR A GUN LOCK (Fig. 19, c). This specimen was found in Unit 7,
level 3 along with the aforementioned Spencer and Springfield cartridge cases
and can probably be attributed to the same time period (Sam Nesmith, personal
communication}.
NAILS. Sixteen square nails and 16 round nails were found in the deposits.
The presence of the square nails is puzzling since there are no known early structures in the immediate area.
MISCELLANEOUS METAL ITEMS. Other metal specimens include a square
nut, a fishing weight, bottle caps, wire fragments, staples, and several unidentifiable metal fragments.

MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS
A triangular leather fragment with a series of holes along one side is probably part of a shoe or boot. Five plastic buttons and one cork were also recovered.

COMMENTS ON THE MOLLUSCAN REMAINS
The following is a description of molluscan remains recovered from Scorpion Cave.
RIVER MUSSEL. Several small fragments of unidentified species were found
in the excavations, as well as two almost complete shells. No modification was
noted on any of the specimens.
LAND SNAILS. Large quantities of land snails were recovered. According to
the field notes, they were found in almost every unit. Information providing exact
quantities and provenience was not available. Identification of the species and
information on habitat are based on Allen and Cheatum (1961: 291-361).

FAMILY RABDOTUS
Rabdotus sp.
Comments: Present in large quantities at Scorpion Cave, these snails are
commonly found in semi-arid south central, southwest, and west Texas. They
probably represent a food source utilized by the prehistoric occupants of the cave
(Allen and Cheatum 1961; Hester 1971). As described earlier in the text, one shell
had been modified.

FAMILY OLIACINIDAE
Euglandina texasiana
Comments: Only four of these snails were found. Their habitat is wellprotected areas with the presence of abundant moisture.

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

178

FAMILY HELICINIDAE
Helicina sp.
Comments: These snails occurred in small quantities, Their habitat is open
wooded areas and unprotected fields, Because of their small size, they obviously
do not represent a food source.

FAMILY POLYGYRIDAE
Polygyra texasiana
Comments: Very few of these snails were recovered. They occur in both
woodlands and open fields. They do not represent a food source.

DISCUSSION

Very few mussel shell fragments were found in the materials available for analysis from Scorpion Cave. Perhaps they
were not collected by the excavators. With the close proximity of
the Medina River, it would be expected that this food source
might have been heavily exploited.
It is generally assumed that the Rabdotus species was
collected as a food item. Clark (1969, 1973) has reviewed the
data published by many archeologists in Texas and the general
opinion is that the snails were part of the aboriginal diet. Ethnohistoric accounts tend to support this assumption (T. N. Campbell, personal communication to T.R. Hester) and analysis of
human coprolites fron archeological sites is providing new
data. Bryant and Williams-Dean (1975: 107) have found the
shells of land snails in human coprolites from rockshelter sites in
Texas.
Land snails recovered from the St. Mary’s Hall site (41 BX
229) were analyzed by Guntharp (1978, unpublished manuscript,
on file at the Center for Archaeological Research, the University
of Texas at San Antonio). To determine a possible correlation between the presence of land snails and human occupation, a
study was made of distribution, density, and size of the Rabdotus
species for a selected sample from the site. The data suggests
that the Rabdotus were of such large size and found in such
large concentrations that natural distribution seems improbable.
Immature snails were noticeably absent from the site. Guntharp
concludes that the Rabdotus species had been seasonally
gathered by the prehistoric occupants of the site.
Studies have also shown that certain snails may be attracted to midden debris. Some species of land snails are often

SCORPION CAVE ARCHEOLOGY

179

found today around debris where there is abundant moisture;
Rabdotus species have been found to accumulate near dryer
deposits of organic material (Clark 1969). However, present
research seems to support the assumption that large concentrations of land snails are directly related to the gathering activities
of prehistoric peoples.
FAUNAL ANALYSIS
The faunal remains from Scorpion Cave were numerous and
widely varied. A total of 8718 bone fragments was submitted to
Billy Davidson for analysis; 285 fragments (3%) were identified
according to species and genus. The faunal remains were
analyzed according to unit and level; this data is on file at the
Center for Archaeological Research, The University of Texas at
San Antonio. The following is a taxonomically arranged list of

Several armadillo fragments were among the faunal
remains, but according to Billy Davidson the preservation of the
bone indicates the animals have only recently died and this
species should not be included in the faunal list. A recent invader from Mexico, the armadillo did not occur in south central
Texas prior to the 1900s.
The faunal remains suggest that the prehistoric inhabitants
of Scorpion Cave relied on hunting wild game and small mammals and supplemented their diet with avifauna, reptiles, and
riverine resources. According to Newcomb (1973) prehistoric
hunters and gatherers in this area of Texas overlooked very few
animals as a potential food source. Many hypotheses could be
offered regarding aboriginal hunting activities as suggested by
the faunal remains. However, many of the bone fragments might
represent recent intrusions. The majority of fragments occur in
levels 1 and 2. A great quantity of bone found in the rear of the
cave might indicate the presence of a carnivore lair. Most of
these fragments are of large mammals and turtles, snakes, and

SCORPION CAVE ARCHEOLOGY

181

turkey. A large concentration of bone was also found in the first
three levels of the units near the mouth of the cave.
Whitetail deer and cottontail rabbit were the most
numerous of the identified species. Fragments were found in
almost every excavated unit. Deer remains extended as deep as
level 8 in Unit 3 (see Fig. 4) but were mainly concentrated in
levels 1 through 3 of most units. Cottontail rabbit was encountered as deep as level 5 in Unit 20, but was concentrated in
levels 1 and 2 of most units.
Pack rat remains were also numerous. Though found in most
units, a great number of pack rat remains were found towards
the rear of the cave. The field notes do not mention the presence
of pack rat nests; however, the great quantity of fragmented
bone in the rear of the cave might conceivably be attributable to
pack rat activities.
The bovid remains could not be specifically identified as
either cow or bison, but several specimens found in the lower
levels are undoubtedly bison. According to ethnographic accounts, bison-hunting was common in this area of central Texas
(Dillehay 1974; Campbell 1975).
The occurrence of black bear is notable. According to Davis
(1974) the species was once widespread throughout the state.
However, the only other reported occurrences in the south Texas
faunal record are at the Kirchmeyer site in Nueces County
(Hester 1975c) and at Mission San Bernardo near Guerrero,
Coahuila, Mexico (Davidson and Valdez 1976). According to
Olsen (1971} bears were occasionally killed for purposes other
than food since they were competitors for both food and shelter,
especially caves.
The smaller mammals found in the deposits probably
represent food items. However, the occurrence of bat probably
indicates a recent intrusion. Caves and rockshelters are used as
roosting sites, and according to Olsen (1971), there is no
evidence that bats were ever used as a food item in this hemisphere. Because of burrowing activities, the presence of pocket
gopher in lower levels probably represents natural intrusions.
Four species of turtle, three of which are aquatic, were
identified and are considered part of the aboriginal diet. Turtle
remains were found in almost all units. Other riverine resources
include freshwater drum and yellow catfish.
Birds, especially turkey, were apparently an abundant and

182

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

preferred source of food. Turkey fragments were found in most
areas of the cave and occurred as deep as level 7 in Unit 2. The
presence of two migratory water fowl, Canada goose and greenwing teal, suggests seasonal occupation of the cave. According
to Baird (1974), Pettingill (1970), and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission (personal communication), these birds usually
occur in the southern regions of the United States from November to April. Only two fragments were identified as Canada
goose and one of these was found in association with domestic
goat and pig. This might indicate a more recent occurrence of
the fowl.
The variety of fauna suggests that the prehistoric
inhabitants of Scorpion Cave exploited a wide variety of animals
available as food. Wild game and smaller mammals, as well as
birds, reptiles, and fish were apparently abundant in the area.
The large quantity of fragmented bone might be due to the
aboriginal practice of eating bone marrow. The abundance of
such a great variety of animals, coupled with the available
vegetal resources, would have made Scorpion Cave and the
surrounding area a favored camping site for prehistoric hunters
and gatherers.

OTHER SITES
The Medina River is an area from which no previous archeological work has been published. However, it appears to be
an area that was extensively occupied for many thousands of
years. Approximately 300 yards to the north of the cave at 41
ME 8, a portion of the bank bordering the river has been washed
out during periods of heavy flooding, exposing burned rock to a
depth of approximately three feet in the upper portion of the
bank. From the lower portion of this burned rock, a Plainyiew
point was recovered (Harvey Smith, Jr., personal communication}. Below the Medina Dam is the original channel to the east,
with a creek merging from the west. Between the confluence of
these bodies of water is a strip of land from which large numbers of artifacts of Archaic and Late Prehistoric age have been
obtained, lust below the dam, Perry Haass (personal communication} reports a site at which an obsidian point has been found.
To the south of the cave, along the base of the cliff, are
several overhangs of various sizes, but no archeological
materials have been found in these areas. About 300 yards south

SCORPION CAVE ARCHEOLOGY

183

of the site is another burned rock midden from which many
Archaic and Late Prehistoric materials have been obtained,
among these a corner-tang knife. Many crude bifaces were also
recovered. Artifacts from this midden as well as many from a
five-mile stretch of the Medina River floodplain are among those
found on the surface over a period of several years by George
and Ruth Judson.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
During June and July of 1971 archeological investigations
were conducted at Scorpion Cave in northwestern Medina
County, Texas. Prehistoric occupations from the Pre-Archaic
through the Late Prehistoric periods are represented by extensive cultural remains. Historic materials were also recovered.
Suhm (1960) has been used as the main reference to incorporate
Scorpion Cave into the known archeology of central Texas and
should be consulted for further information on other cave and
rockshelter sites.
The determination of occupational sequences at Scorpion
Cave was necessarily based on temporally diagnostic artifacts
(i.e., arrow and dart points) which could be related via crossdating to similar artifacts at other central Texas sites. A careful
record of artifact provenience kept by the excavators revealed
that archeological deposits within the cave were heavily mixed
(see Table 3). This does not seem untenable given the powdery
composition of the cave deposits which could have been easily
displaced by successive groups of inhabitants.
The Pre-Archaic is represented by two Martindale points.
Early Archaic specimens include Bulverde, Early Triangular,
Nolan, Travis and Wells points. Castroville, Langtry, Marcos,
Marshall, and Pedernales points are representative of the Middle
Archaic, with Pedernales apparently continuing into the Late
Archaic at Scorpion Cave (cf. Hester 1971). Occupational
evidence of the Late Archaic is dominated by Ensor points (30%
of recovered dart points); Frio, Kinney, Montell, and Palmillas
points are also representative of the Late Archaic.
The Late Prehistoric periods is dominated by the presence
of 88 Edwards points (75% of recovered arrow points). They
represent the earliest arrow point form found in central Texas,
and this is one of the largest collections of Edwards points yet
documented. Radiocarbon dates from the La Jita site in north-

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

184

western Uvalde County (Hester 1971) indicate that this type
appeared between A.D. 900 and 1000 in the southwestern Edwards Plateau region. A radiocarbon date of A.D. 1054 was
obtained from excavations in the Camp Bullis area near San
Antonio (Gerstle, Kelly, and Assad 1978). Other arrow points
include those of the Cuney, Fresno, Perdiz, and Scallorn
varieties. Provenience of arrow point specimens (see Table 3)
shows Edwards as the only arrow point type present below level
4. However, the majority of the specimens were in levels 1 and
2, as were several Early Archaic specimens.
The beveled knife fragment and bone artifacts also date to
the Late Prehistoric period. No pottery was recovered. However,
26 nodules of clay were recovered from level 3 of Unit 36 (see
Fig. 4). Ranging in size from 1A" to 11A" in diameter, most of the
nodules were of fine yellow clay; others were of red clay which
was slightly coarser and harder. Since the nodules are fairly
uniform in size and occur in an isolated part of the cave, they
probably do not represent a natural occurrence.
Historic specimens include ceramic, glass, metal, leather,
and plastic items. Several date to the late 18th and early 19th
centuries; others date up to the present time. These items were
probably left behind by hunters or campers and do not represent
a long-term historic utilization of the cave.
Based on the percentage of projectile points, the Late
Prehistoric, with representative arrow points comprising 62% of
the total, would appear to be the heaviest occupational period at
Scorpion Cave. However, if preforms are taken into consideration, dart point preforms representative of the Archaic
period comprise 77% of the preform total (see Table 2). Since
the preforms are not temporally diagnostic and provenience of
all specimens is mixed, the occupational periods represented by
them cannot be assigned more definitely than as "Archaic". A
reasonable assumption based on consideration of both diagnostic
points and preforms would be that the cave provided intermittent shelter to numerous inhabitants from the Middle
Archaic through the Late Prehistoric periods.

Lithic debris representative of the initial stages of artifact
manufacturing is not well represented at Scorpion Cave. Only 12
cores and 23 crude bifaces were recovered from the cave; primary
and secondary flakes were infrequent. Interior flakes, many classifiable as bifacial thinning flakes, comprised the greatest quantity
of lithic debris. Horizontally, recovery of several thousand flakes
and flake fragments from Units 13, 14, 15, 17 and 19 (see Fig. 4) is
indicative of an area where final flint&napping stages and/or point
resharpening were carried out. Quarry sites such as the one
recorded by Patterson (1975} in northern Medina County were
probably utilized by the cave’s inhabitants for early phases of core
reduction and initial phases of biface manufacture.
Of 134 dart point preforms recovered during excavation, 82 of
these (61%) were proximal, medial, and distal fragments. Within
the arrow point preform category, 75% are basal fragments.
Apparently the cave’s inhabitants were attempting, at times unsuccessfully, the latter stages of biface reduction within the cave.
Only two hammerstones were recovered from cave deposits; one
broken deer ulna flaking tool was also recovered.
Of special interest are the painted pebbles and stained stones.
The pebbles all have black linear decoration; one specimen also
has red patches on one face. These specimens are very rare for
this part of Texas, although a painted pebble with red linear
decoration has been reported from Zavala County (Hester 1977).
The stained stones, possibly used for grinding pigment, have
reddish colorations. A hematite concretion, not native to the immediate area, may be the color source.
Charcoal and burned limestone were found scattered throughout the deposits. According to the field notes, Units 9-12 (see Fig. 4)
contained hearths. One hearth contained a large concentration of
Rabdotus snails. At 36 inches in Units 2 and 4 a large hearth was
exposed and was surrounded by tools and chert debitage, probably
an indication of heat treatment of raw materials as part of the
knapping procedure.
Faunal remains, along with the analysis of cultural remains,
indicate that the prehistoric inhabitants of Scorpion Cave were
seasonal hunters and gatherers who utilized a wide variety of
resources found in the local environment. Whitetail deer and cottontail rabbit were most numerous in the faunal materials; a
variety of smaller mammals were also apparently utilized as
food items. The presence of bison and black bear is significant.

186

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

According to Campbell (1975), bison-hunting was common along
the Medina River. Black bear has been recorded at only two
other sites in south Texas. Turtle and turkey were a preferred
food source. Seasonality is suggested by the occurrence of
Canada goose and green-wing teal, present in the area only
during winter migrations. Riverine resources were exploited as
indicated by the presence of several species of fish and mussel
shell fragments. Found throughout the deposits were great
quantities of land snails. Mostly of the Rabdotus species, they
represent a significant food source.
Plant remains have not been preserved, but a great variety
of edible plants are available in the wooded area surrounding
the site. The recovery of several manos and pitted stones certainly suggests the processing of vegetal materials. Newcomb
(1973) provides a general description of the subsistence and
material culture of the aboriginal inhabitants of this area. He
reports that the grinding process was used for almost every
edible item, including dried fish, agave, peyote, and prickly pear.
Though most creatures were considerd as a possible food
source, plants were the mainstay of their diet (ibid). Campbell
(1975) has reviewed ethnohistoric accounts of the Payaya Indians who inhabited this region of south central Texas. A very
important part of their gathering activities was the harvesting of
pecans in autumn. The Payaya reportedly were able to remove
the nut shell without breaking the nut meats (ibid). Perhaps this
was the function of the pitted stones found within the cave. They
have been described as "nutting" stones at other archeological
sites (Johnson, Suhm, and Tunnell 1962).
The occurrence of bone beads and tools provides further
insights into the culture of the prehistoric inhabitants of Scorpion Cave. The incised bone bead, its grooves filled with
asphaltum, is probably indicative of trade with coastal peoples.
At the Floyd Morris site in Cameron County, several bone beads
with traces of asphaltum were recovered (Collins, Hester and
Weir 1969).
Comparison of Scorpion Cave to similar sites is difficult
because so little professional archeology has thus far been done
in the southwestern Edwards Plateau. Both rockshelters and
burned rock middens are frequently reported by area residents
and ranchers, but detailed information is unavailable. The
following is a review of several recorded sites in central Texas

SCORPION CAVE ARCHEOLOGY

whose artifact assemblages are comparable to specimens from
Scorpion Cave.
La ]ita, a terrace site with several burned rock middens is
located on the Sabinal River in northwestern Uvalde County (approximately 35 miles west of Scorpion Cave). It is an important
comparative source for the Edwards Plateau area (Hester 1971).
Cultural remains at La Jita are attributable to Archaic and Late
Prehistoric occupation. The Middle Archaic is dominated by the
presence of numerous Pedernales points. Nineteen Edwards
points were recovered. Bone-tempered potsherds were also
present.
Classen Rockshelter in northern Bexar County has an artifact assemblage similar to that of Scorpion Cave (Fox and Fox,
unpublished manuscript, Center for Archaeological Research,
The University of Texas at San Antonio). Located on Cibolo
Creek, the rockshelter contained ceramic, metal, and glass artifacts overlying prehistoric assemblages. The prehistoric
cultural remains include Castroville, Ensor, Darl, Langtry,
Montell, Pedernales, and Shumla points. A possible Edwards
point was also recovered. Other artifacts include a deer ulna
awl and a painted limestone pebble. The pebble was painted on
one end; the design motif could not be determined.
Timmeron Rockshelter in Hays County was excavated in
1975 by the Southern Texas Archaeological Association (manuscript in progress). Several dart point types were recovered, but
the Late Prehistoric components, with Edwards, Scallorn, and
Perdiz arrow points, were most numerous. Several burned rock
middens were located in the immediate vicinity of the rockshelter.
The Wolf Site in Blanco County consists of a rockshelter and
a nearby burned rock midden [Highley and Lengefeld 1977).
Several ring middens have also been recorded just west of the
site (Carolyn Spock, personal communication). Preliminary
testing at the rockshelter, located on the Pedernales River, has
resulted in the recovery of several Perdiz points, many flakes
and blades, and one bone tool. Several ovate unifacial scrapers
were surface-collected near the rockshelter; these specimens can
be attributed to the Late Prehistoric period (Green and Hester
1973).
Salvage archeological efforts prior to construction of
Canyon Reservoir in Comal County (Johnson, Suhm and Tunnell

188

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

1962) revealed three important sites, a burned rock midden site,
a terrace site, and a rockshelter. Oblate Rockshelter contained
remains of the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods, with Ensor,
Frio, Marcos, Perdiz, and Scallorn points present in large
numbers.
As with most caves and rockshelters, the Late Prehistoric
cultural assemblage at Scorpion Cave is more prolific than the
Archaic components. A gradual increase in occupational debris
begins in the Middle Archaic period. The presence of a nearby
burned rock midden also seems to be characteristic of most cave
and rockshelter sites. Burned rock middens are attributable to
the Archaic period. Their occurrence near a natural shelter
suggests multi-component utilization of the general area surrounding the site. The Late Prehistoric, represented by a greater
number of diagnostic artifacts, might indicate longer periods of
occupation of natural shelters and/or utilization by larger groups
of peoples. Further research is needed to incorporate the data
from central Texas rockshelters and determine their relevance
in overall settlement patterns of prehistoric hunters and
gatherers.

A Survey and Assessment of the Archeologlcal
Resources of Fort Hood, Texas
GEORGE B. THOMAS

ABSTRACT
The results of six years of amateur archeological survey on the
Fort Hood military reservation are discussed in detail. Acting under
an archeological survey permit authorized by the Department of the
Interior for two of those six years, the Fort Hood Archeological
Society successfully surveyed portions of the 217,000 acres (339
square miles) of the installation. While survey method -- or lack of
method -- and collection practices certainly biased the sample, it
was felt that tentative settlement patterns could be determined by
correlating chronologically diagnostic artifacts with topographic
variables. Discernible patterns appear similar to those elsewhere in
central Texas. We await future work, using adequate sampling techniques, to test the results and tentative conclusions of this able
amateur survey.

INTRODUCTION
The Fort Hood Archeological Society (FHAS) conducted a site
distribution survey on the Fort Hood Military Reservation (Fig. 1,a)
from December, 1971 until the late months of 1977. For two years
of that period, August 27, 1974 to August 26, 1976, the FHAS
operated under Department of the Interior Survey Permit No. 74TX-053. Fort Hood land is subject to numerous U. S. Army regulations governing the treatment and preservation of "archeological
resources," (PL #209, June 8, 1906; PL #93-291, May 24, 1974; AR
200-1; AR 405-80), as well as to Executive Order (EO) 11593 -Federal legislation requiring the survey and assessment of archeological and historic resources on Federal lands by July 1, 1973. In
spite of the evident impracticability of the Executive Order, prevailing legal opinion seems to indicate that it is still in effect, and

196

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

that EO 11593 forms part of the basis for the Post Archeologist
position, currently under the Master Planning Department of the
Fort Hood Directorate of Facilities Engineering.
This report will concentrate upon the results of the FHAS
survey until shortly after the termination of Permit No. 74-TX-053.
It will also consider the results of a tentative settlement pattern
study on the basis of surface evidence and projectile point chronologies, to be compared with regional syntheses published by others
(Shafer 1971; and Weir 1976). Finally, we will discuss special problems inherent in archeology on military land.
Of the approximately 217,000 acres (339 square miles) of Fort
Hood land, investigators from 1971 to 1973 limited themselves
mostly to the easily accessible North Nolan Creek and Owl Creek
drainages. Later investigators extended the survey, most notably
to the Cowhouse Creek drainage, as Society members decided to
broaden the scope of areas and ecozones considered.
Further limitations to the survey were imposed by the Impact
Area, an area of approximately 56,000 acres (87 square miles),
which is usually inaccessible for reasons which are selfexplanatory. The remaining 160,000 acres (approximately 250
square miles) are open post area during most of the year. Antiquities preservation is the subject of little to no enforcement on
post, having proven "impossible" in the absence of survey.
In spite of these problems, survey has been scheduled
judiciously by non-professionals, working when military occupations permit, and motivated by professional goals. Fort Hood Archeological Society members, who at one time had four individuals
among them with academic backgrounds in archeology, managed
to gain sponsorship of the Recreation Services Library as a Private
Organization. By late 1977, the FHAS still existed on paper, and
the newly-hired post archeologist was hopeful of rejuvenating the
organization.

ENVIRONMENT
Geology
Fort Hood is located in portions of Bell and Coryell Counties,
central Texas, in a region traversed by the Balcones Escarpment
and Balcones Fault. The fault zone is part of a major geologic
feature extending from the Red River valley, through Dallas,
Waco, Austin, San Antonio, and curving westward across the

Rio Grande into Coahuila. In the Fort Hood region, the Balcones
Fault System is indistinct, having been described as a 7-mile
wide graben zone passing through the town of Belton, the Bell
County seat. Small, discontinuous faults in this zone line up "en
echelon" (Adkins and Arick 1930: 74), just below the Edwards
Plateau, the southernmost region of the southern Plains.
Throughout the fault region is the Balcones tableland, or
Lampasas Cut Plain, a dissected plain from which rise fossiliferous limestone hills. These limestone caprock hills are flattopped remnants of the Edwards formation of the Cretaceous
Fredericksburg group (Sellards, Adkins and Plummet 1958: 332340; and ]elks 1962: 1). Resistant Fredericksburg limestone is
underlain by softer Comanche Peak limestone, causing undermining, steep slopes, and rockshelters. Predominant geological composition of the eroded terraces and floodplains is Walnut clay
(Adkins and Arick 1930: 29). The tableland yields farther southeast to the Blackland Prairie, a region of dark, fertile soil, rolling
southeastward to the Gulf coastal plain.
While Fort Hood land lies entirely within the Cut Plain
region, the southern portion of the post is more extensively
eroded, with fewer flat-topped hills (Edwards outliers) (Adkins
and Arick 1930: 29), and with rounded, rolling, broad alluvial
land among them, resembling prairie. This relatively flat terrain
is of generally higher elevation than the valleys of the dissected
hilly region to the north, and the occasional flat-topped hills to
the south are correspondingly higher than the limestone plateaus
to the north.
Fort Hood is situated within the Brazos River drainage between the Leon and Lampasas Rivers. Drainage in both regions
is dendritic, tending to be more angular in the north than in the
south. The urbanized, main "cafltonment area" of Fort Hood is
located in the southern region, immediately south of the southernmost Cretaceous hills. Creeks and rivers trend from westnorthwest to east-southeast. Major drainages of the dissected
hill and plateau region are the Leon River, forming a portion of
the north boundary of Fort Hood; Owl Creek, which was the
location of most FHAS survey before 1974; and Cowhouse Creek,
the large, central drainage, having steep sides and wide floodplains. Stampede Creek flows southward into Cowhouse Creek
through a broad, rolling valley.
In the southern portion of Fort Hood, Clear Creek flows

FORT HOOD ARCHEOLOGY

199

northward as part of the Table Rock Creek/House Creek/Cottonwood Creek drainage pattern flowing northward into Cowhouse
Creek. Other streams in the southern region include North Nolan
Creek, again flowing west-northwest to east-southeast; and Reese
Creek, which flows southward toward the Lampasas River.
Other major tributaries of Cowhouse and Owl Creeks, and of the
Leon River, are located in the Impact Area.
Climate
Fort Hood receives an annual rainfall of 33.4 inches, with
most of it concentrated during the months of September and
May. July is the month with least rainfall. The area is near the
boundary of two climatic zones: the semi-arid steppe climate to
the west, and the warm, temperate, rainy climate with hot
summers to the east. The average temperature is 68.1°F, with a
range of 94°F to 38°F as the mean summer-winter temperatures.
The frequency of frontal conditions means that abrupt changes
in weather conditions are frequent (U. S. Army 1971).
Fauna
White tail deer, bison, mountain lion, bobcat, wolf, coyote,
cottontail and jackrabbits, skunk, opossum, raccoon, fox,
rodents, turkey, dove, owl, hawk, fish, mollusks, snails, and
various species of snake, turtle, and lizard were among the
animal resources available to prehistoric inhabitants of the Fort
Hood region. Armadillo and ringtail cat are recent faunal additions derived from Mexico. All of these except bison are
present in modern times.
Flora

Vegetation on Fort Hood consists of the familiar combination
of central Texas grassland, shrubs, and trees. Upland trees
include live oak, Spanish oak, post oak, and juniper ("cedar"),
while pecan, willow, sycamore, bur oak, and cottonwood trees
occur in the lowlands. The growth of juniper Ouniperus
mexicana) has increased since early historic times. Rounding out
the flora are grasses and various plant species associated with
grassland, dense stands of brush, and vines. Trees tend to
cluster densely along the stream beds and on steep bluff slopes
of the limestone hills. Trees also cluster in linear patterns following historic fence lines (which appear prominently on orthopicto

maps and aerial photographs). "Roots, pecans, walnuts, acorns,
mesquite beans, plums, prickly pear fruit [Opuntia engeimannii],
mulberries, grapes, and other edible vegetal foods are found in
abundance in central Texas, and it is likely that many of them
were eaten" (Jelks 1962: 93).

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND OF FORT HOOD
AND VICINITY
Archeological surveys in the region have included the
studies at Belton (Miller and Jelks 1952; and Shafer, Suhm and
Scurlock 1964) and Stillhouse Hollow Reservoirs (Sorrow, Shafer
and Ross 1967). Among other regional archeological work, notable publications have concerned the Youngsport Site on the
Lampasas River, Bell County (Shafer 1963); the Finis Frost Site,
on Richland Springs Creek, San Saba County (Green and Hester
1973); the Kyle Site, Hill County (Jelks 1962); the Loeve-Fox site,
Williamson County (Prewitt 1974); and a survey of the Leon River
(Shafer 1971; Watt 1936: 5-27).
Most Fort Hood sites are typical of the Central Texas Archaic; rock and sh~l middens are numerous, with large limestone-derived sedimentary flint (chert) sources utilized extensively. Scrapers (if we can accept this functionally descriptive
label) are apparently most numerous on the surface of most
sites, with flake knives, choppers, engraving tools and burins,
drills, and an occasional gouge also occurring. Cores, some of
them quite large, can sometimes include biface chopper-like
implements. Bifaces are abundant at some sites, they range from
blanks or preforms, through finely-shaped knives or scrapers, to
projectile points. As the projectile point illustrations indicate
(Figs. 2-12), the surface-collected specimens are usually in a
fragmentary state.
Equally prominent in the Central Texas Archaic sites of Fort
Hood are implements probably related to plant food collecting
and processing. Milling stones, whole and fragmentary, have
been located in all microenvironmental or terrain contexts.
The sites themselves range from small-area surface scatters
or burned rock middens, to large flake and biface scatters
covering one, two, or more square kilometers. Some large site
complexes extend for as many as three or four km2 on or near
the flat limestone hilltops, and may be associated with flint
sources.

METHODOLOGY OF SURVEY
The informal nature of Fort Hood Archeological Society
membership meant that survey and laboratory analysis did not
take place regularly, or follow a consistent research design.
Usually working on weekends, field crews drove to one or more
selected areas, where they engaged in walking, non-random site
location survey. It could be said that a "drainage corridor" technique was used. From one to approximately 10 individuals
participated. U.S. Department of Defense maps were plentiful,
including maps discarded by various military units to which
Society members belonged, and others that were provided by the
post engineers. These military maps were of excellent quality,
and were available in 1:25,000; 1:50,000; 1:75,000; and smaler
scales. Orthopicto maps, which combine an aerial photographic
mosaic background with standard mapping symbols, were available at 1:25,000. These maps enabled extremely accurate
plotting of site locations.
Artifact, shell, bone, and burned rock samples were
collected from virtually all Fort Hood sites. Most of these were
uncontrolled "grab" samples, and were justified on two grounds:
(1} Time limited FHAS members to rapid site location activities,
while members felt the need to famliarize themselves with the
nature of artifacts, their sorting, cataloguing, and storage; (2)
extensive looting on the post convinced members that collections,
if only partially controlled, kept some of the artifact inventory
away from those of less than professional bent. Controlled
collection would have been possible under current conditions of
full-time, professional supervision. Under the conditions imposed
on Society members in previous years, however, a "nocollection" policy might have been more desirable and, in spite
of the looting, such policy would have enabled more accuracy in
future controlled sampling.
With no coherent teaching organization, no accreditation,
and no obvious avenue for FHAS members to add to their own
credentials, later, more scientific phases of the survey project
left many individuals lost and disinterested. A "90% labwork/lO% fieldwork" policy served to make the lab a quiet and
peaceful place to work, but there was little assistance. Fieldwork also took its toll on membership, as we left the idle streams
of the drainage corridors, plunged into the thick underbrush, and

202

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

climbed to the bluff-tops and plateaus in 110°F weather.
To facilitate site differentiation, and to create a problem
formulation and hypothesis testing framework, we divided Fort
Hood land into seven terrain zones (Fig. l,b). These appear to
correspond with "microenvironments" or biological ecozones:
Narrow Terrace
Bluff-Top
Floodplain
Bluff-Slope and Draw
Prairie
Rockshelter
Broad Terrace
We also divided Fort Hood into drainage zones, taking into
account creek size in order to include smaller creeks within larger
watersheds or creek systems. Thus Bull Run Creek, Stampede
Creek, Cottonwood Creek, and Two Year Old Creek are part of the
Cowhouse Creek system, Preacher’s Creek is part of the Owl Creek
system, and Henson Creek and Shoal Creek are part of the Leon
River system. Some of these smaller drainages are treated separately, however, for finer differentiation.
Earlier surveyors, relying solely upon the drainage zones technique, limited the survey to corridors which followed creek valleys
and immediately adjacent bluffs. Later survey results have come
from semi-systematic, problem-oriented efforts, while most recent
survey has begun to extend to all terrain contexts. Standard
sampling techniques may show site distribution concentrated in or
near the valley areas, where ecozonal boundaries, flint sources,
creeks and springs could be exploited. No systematic study has
confirmed this. A more comprehensive, full-time survey project is
needed, perhaps beginning with the hypothetical assumption that
no sites have been located. Fortunately, the recently-hired post
archeologist has also proposed this strategy (Briuer 1977: personal
communication). This strategy should provide the most reliable test
of the results presented here.
For present purposes, we can assume that the Fort Hood
Archeological Survey site distribution results are reasonably
accurate, given the personnel and part-time conditions under
which the survey was made. The following terrain summaries are
presented as an overview of the archeological setting as conceived
at present.

Bluff-Top: These sites line the bluff-tops of the Cretaceous hills, sometimes
extending in massive, multi-occupational surface scatters from the bluff edges to the

FORT HOOD ARCHEOLOGY

2O3

opposite side of a plateau. Bluff-top sites may have been seasonal occupation sites,
hunting camps, stone chipping stations (or combinations of these} and are characterized by light to dense surface scatters, very likely without notable depth. Usually
eroding from highly deflated soil cover, burned rock middens may be numerous
here. Vegetation cover can be grasses, with vegetation usually associated with grassland; along with upland trees. Inhabitants of bluff-top sites may have utilized bluff
slopes and rockshelters extensively.

Bluff Slope and Draw: These sites are often closely associated with bluff-top
sites and rockshelters. As the terrain type suggests, there may be much erosional
wash here, with many artifacts secondarily deposited from rockshelters or from
on top of the escarpment. However, the frequent incidence of burned rock middens eroding from bluff slopes, and washing down steep draws, lends substance
to this terrain type as a primary site location. Artifacts may be concentrated in
light to dense scatters. Test excavations in 1972 at 41 BL 138, the observation of
fresh pot-holes dug by collectors on Fort Hood, and WPA work reported by Collins
(1972} at the Devil’s Hollow Site, all took place in bluff slope areas. Vegetation is
these zones is likely to consist of heavy tree cover, with upland varieties predominating.

Rockshelter: These sites, as noted above, will be closely associated with blufftop, and bluff slope and draw sites in many cases. Many Leon River rockshelters
contained post-Archaic burials (Shafer 1971: 3}; however these had almost all
been vandalized at the time of the survey. Whether Fort Hood rockshelters
contain burials of the Austin and Toyah Foci remains to be seen. Rockshelters
may have provided shelter, as indicated by minor midden activity observable in
front of some. Often springs are conveniently located. Because rockshelters are
geologically associated with bluff-top edges and bluff-slopes, vegetation will be of
the same configuration as in bluff-slope areas without rockshelters.

Broad Terrace: These sites are on wide, rolling terraces, situated above floodplains. They contain moderate to dense lithic surface scatters, and are usually
sites of intensive or extensive occupation. Most of these sites have been plowed,
and are old agricultural fields with historic fence lines marked by straight lines of
trees. One natural profile cut into a terrace site indicates shallow cultural deposition. The great extent of horizontal distribution at such sites, however, suggests
the possibility of controlled surface studies of intra-site activity variability. A grid
system was established at 41 CV 73 with this in mind; but few controlled sampling
collections were attempted. Burned rock middens can be discerned on broad
terraces, scattered by plowing. Vegetation here is usually grassland, with lowland
trees growing in clumps, or along historic fence lines.
Narrow Terrace: These sites are geologically similar to broad terrace sites;
however, they occur in restricted areas between bluffs and floodplains. Usually
there is little or no evidenc.e of historic plowing, and burned rock midden activity
here can be undisturbed. Narrow terraces may or may not be culturally distinct
from broad terraces, but the arbitrary distinction may be useful. Burned rock

204

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

middens may be most dense here, under alluvial overburden from the nearby
slopes. These areas are also most susceptible to looting, probably because of the
proximity of bluff slope trees, dirt roads, and the furtive nature of looting activities. Concealment and evasion opportunities are close-by.
Floodplain: These sites may also be washouts from bluff slopes; however,
there are indisputable sites in this terrain type. Floodplain sites may be characterized by burned rock middens, sometimes disturbed by historic plowing. Artifacts
often indicate occupational activity. Vegetation on the floodplains is usually grassland, with clumps of lowland trees. Dense stands of lowland trees often line the
stream banks.
Prairie: These sites are located in the Edwards Outlier areas, south and
southeast of the main land area of Fort Hood. The rolling to flat terrain suggests
transition to the Blackland Prairie farther to the southeast. Archeological sites
here are often near stream confluences. Prairie sites may utilize relatively high
ground, and may be similar to terrace sites except for their smaller size, and the
absence of plowing in rocky, marly soil. While most of the old Edwards formation
has eroded away here, the soil is extremely rocky, with many Cretaceous fossils
among the breccia. Sites in the prairie region may also cluster on or near the
slopes of the isolated Cretaceous hills, especially if streams are conveniently
located. Although little survey has taken place in this southern portion of Fort
Hood, we may conjecture that site distribution and settlement pattern may be
affected by the different arrangement and fewer varieties of biotic zones for subsistence exploitation by hunting-collecting societies.

As of early 1977, 81 prehistoric sites on Fort Hood were
registered with the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory,
Austin. Five additional registration numbers, not included here,
represent four historic sites and one off-post site (41 CV 51)
improperly investigated in 1973, on the private land of one FHAS
member. Site 41 BL 155 and 156 are considered together, having
been found upon later survey to be one massive surface scatter,
as described earlier in our section on bluff-top sites. To these 87
sites we may add 18 additional sites not yet registered. Nine of
these were located as a result of the joint survey efforts of the
North Texas State University crew, and individuals from the
FHAS. The North Texas State University Institute of Applied
Sciences was contracted by the City of Copperas Cove to assess
the archeological resources along the proposed route of a wastewater pipeline (McCormick and Filson 1976). As of early 1977 a
total of 105 archeological and historic sites was on record at the
Fort Hood Archeological Society.
Notable sites include 41 BL 146, 41 BL 154/160 and 41 CV
73. BL 146 is a petroglyph locus on the northern edge of a low

FORT HOOD ARCHEOLOGY

205

bluff, at the head of a draw. A flowing spring rises at the draw
head, just below the petroglyph outcrop. The site is surrounded
by a massive scatter of burned-rock middens and lithics, ineluding an unusually ample representation of projectile points.
Investigators have been unable to discern limits, other than
natural ones, to the site, which extends southward to the opposite edge of the plateau, and northward across the floodplain
to the creek. The petroglyphs include intriguing figures of historical, post-European-contact origin, including the letters "AD."
Others are of uncertain significance.
BL 154/160 is a complex of middens and lithic scatters occupying a relatively limited area, yet occupying four of the possible six terrain types or ecozones. A burned rock midden is surrounded by lithic scatter on the bluff-top; two rockshelters are
just under the escarpment, with lithic and shell midden material
eroding down the slope and the associated draw. A spring at the
base of the slope is in close proximity to burned rock middens
and lithic scatter on the floodplain.
CV 73 is a broad terrace site located on both sides of an
Owl Creek tributary stream which cuts deeply into the terrace.
The surface has been extensively plowed and deflated, and currently carries a heavy load of off-road military traffic. The distinctive features of this site are its broad expanse and dense
lithic deposition, inviting easy gridding and on-site control.
Gridding and controlled collection were attempted here in 1975
and 1976, until extensive military traffic obliterated artillery
firing point #131, which we were using for a bench-mark-like
reference point. (FP 131 was replaced by late 1977, apparently
at the same spot, although we have not been able to check it for
accuracy). The north base line, extending 250m. from FP 131,
was laid out in a 338° 30’ direction, ending at a deep natural
soil profile cut by the tributary. Observation of these profiles
show the site to have shallow cultural depth at these locations;
however, testing could determine areas of little or no plowing,
and if significant stratigraphy is present.
TENTATIVE SETTLEMENT PATTERN ANALYSIS
Of the 81 sites included in this analysis, 41 produced
chronologically diagnostic artifacts (projectile points), and are
included in the following settlement pattern analysis. Nineteen of

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

206

the 31 Bell County sites are included; with 22 of the 50 Coryell
County sites. It remains to be seen whether the remaining 40
non-diagnostic sites can be tested to discern chronological patterning by tool type frequencies and lithic manufacture
variability in the collected samples. Chronology is not the only
interest. Predominant flake size, lithic material, the presence
and frequency of utilized and debitage flakes, cores, blanks, and
bifacial tools should indicate industrial activity patterning in
Archaic society. It is doubtful that either of these can be discerned from the FHAS collections. 41 CV 73 is the only site at
which controlled surface sampling has been attempted, and we
were unable to complete it.
What could be tested were the hypotheses generated about
chronological settlement changes, using the projectile pointproducing sites only. With such a small sample, and relying on
surface data for the most part (data from 41 BL 138 must be
considered uncontrolled excavational), one must keep in mind
the tentative nature of the settlement pattern study.

located in November, 1977, was from the rockshelter site 41 BL 181. While it
would be productive to include ceramics in any future analysis, none have been
included here.

Chronological Considerations
Of the various chronological schemes applicable to central
Texas, and presented in Fig. 18 (Suhm and Jelks 1962; Shafer
1963; Willey 1966; 329-337, Sorrow, Sharer and Ross 1967;
Johnson 1967; 23-24; and Weir 1976), Weir’s five-phase system
for the Archaic lends itself most readily to projectile point
chronological analysis. Morphological distinctions can be
discerned: stemmed (Clear Fork); basal notching (Round Rock};
broad points with corner notching {San Marcos}; and side
notched (Twin Sisters). Weir’s early phase (San Geronimo) is
tentatively represented by one Gower point from uncontrolled excavational context (Fig. 6,f}; while one possible "Early Barbed"
stem base (Fig. 7,k) was not included in the San Geronimo phase
for the settlement pattern study. Two additional Gower variants
are worthy of mention (Fig. l l,g,h); although they are from an
off-post site, and were not included in the analysis.
Weir’s sytem was constructed with the assumption that
phases overlap. This is likely to be an accurate reflectin of
stylistic and typological change in cultural processes. All
cultures arrive at stylistic modes, but are never static: rather
they are in a state of continual transition. Perhaps significantly,
Weir {1976 makes no mention of the Transitional Archaic (ca.
500 B.C.-ca. A.D. 1800). The use of the term "transitional" implies that transition is something new and unusual, rather than

the normal situation. Other researchers have found no evidence
of overlap (Prewitt 1974; and personal communication 1977).
Be that as it may, the Fort Hood data grouped easily into
artificially-conceived "components," each of which clustered
into what might be called "chronological modes," for the sake of
tentative analysis. Site distribution maps (on file, Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, Austin) indicate the probable settlement pattern changes through time; while in Figs. 19 and 20,
projectile point-producing sites are represented by schematic
battleship curves. Both Bell and Coryell County sites are
arranged chronologically by mean site date, weighted according
to the number of chronological indicators (points) in each chronological mode component. Longer battleship curves indicate more
chronological mode components -- hence, according to surface
evidence, longer site use. A glance at the battleship curve for
site 41 BL 138 may indicate the effects of excavational data
upon a surface sample from numerous sites. The overall impression from these initial charts, however, indicates the possibility
of nonrandom changes in settlement patterning through time.
Terrain types, as represented in Fig. 1,b, add another
dimension to the analysis. The question was, how much of this
nonrandom settlement patterning change was according to
terrain, and how could this be correlated with other central
Texas archeological data and conclusions in the form of functional hypotheses? When terrain type and chronology were
correlated, we could produce settlement frequency graphs (Figs.
21, 22).
To arrive at the interpretations in Fig. 21, the mean date
was determined for each site as in Fig. 19 and 20. Chronological
mode components with more projectile points represented, were
weighted more than those with fewer points, thus giving us mean
site dates which may be more accurate. Sites were then segregated according to primary terrain type or microenvironment,
and the percentages of dated sites at each terrain type determined. These results were more striking than those represented
in Fig. 22.
To arrive at the interpretations in Fig. 22, sites were
ignored, and all projectile points totalled in each artificiallydetermined chronological mode component. These totals were
then segregated as in Fig. 21, according to terrain type. The
advantage of this second procedure was in its representation of

FORT HOOD ARCHEOLOGY

227

the separate chronological mode components, and the multiple
terrain types represented at many of the larger sites. Results,
while not as striking, may have been more specifically accurate.
The advantage of the first procedure (Fig. 21} may be in its
reflection of possible general tendencies in settlement patterning. As we can see from the graphs, and for the figures
presented in Fig. 23, Neo-American (post-Archaic) manifestations
are not well-represented from Fort Hood surface data. Two
Scallorn points (Austin Phase] and two Perdiz points (Toyah
Phase], from three separate sites, round out the diagnostic lithic
inventory; while the few known ceramics (one represented in Fig.
17) complete the total Neo-American sample. While most of these
data were being processed, there was no choice but to concentrate upon the Archaic.
Hypotheses
Because of the preliminary nature of any survey, hypotheses
must derive from preliminary observations and from the local
archeological literature. Thus we might state two hypotheses. (1}
Rockshelters came into use starting in the late Archaic (Shafer
1971: 2}; and (2) bison hunting increased during the same period
(Weir 1976). A third hypothesis, which we shall discuss first,
derives from preliminary observation, supported by implications
in Bryant (1969) that the water-table was higher, and the central
Texas climate was wetter before the late Middle Archaic {Weir’s
San Marcos Phase] ca. 1,000 B.C. (Shafer 1971: 2). During the
earlier phases, then, rockshelters would be too wet for habitation, and floodplain areas would be swampland. This would
channel habitation to the bluff-tops, terraces, and prairie highlands. Preliminary observations of a portion of the broad Cowhouse Creek floodplain showed the area to lack sites, while sites
(41 CV 57, 79, 80, 81 82, 83, 95, 96, and 97) line the bluff-tops in
the immediate vicinity.
Later observations of the same floodplain at a stream confluence ca. 3 km to the northwest, cast the first doubts upon the
"absence from floodplains" hypothesis (41 CV 88 and 89). Finally
we can see from both Figures 21 and 22, that there was never
any such absence. The general trend was no significant change
in percentage of floodplain habitation from early Middle Archaic
(Clear Fork Phase] times to the end of the Archaic.

228

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Checking the first two hypotheses against the data, we find
that they can be tentatively confirmed. Both interpretations show
rockshelter occupation to be either central or late in the Archaic
sequence. Fig. 22, based upon individual chronological modes,
places rockshelter occupation in Weir’s San Marcos and Twin
Sisters Phases, clearly supporting Hypothesis 1. Bluff-top occupation appears to have undergone significant changes according to both Figs. 21 and 22. In both graphs rockshelter occupation is represented as coinciding with the later of the two
upsurges of bluff-top occupation; with bluff-slope and draw occupation showing the most significant increase in Fig. 21, during
the Twin Sisters Phase, Late Archaic. Correspondingly, broad
terrace occupation shows a brief burst in the Round Rock Phase,
Middle Archaic, during one of the lulls in bluff-top occupation. It
would seem also that there was positive population movement
toward the bluff-tops, rather than movement away from lowland
swamps. Superimposing a proposed schedule of bison absence
from the southern Plains upon Figs. 21 and 22 (Dillehay 1974),
we are able to further correlate Fort Hood data with that from
elsewhere in central Texas. If we may connect bluff-top, rockshelter, and bluff-slope occupation with bison hunting, we may
confirm Hypothesis 2: tentative Fort Hood evidence would
support conclusions that bison hunting increased during the Late
Archaic, until the bison population declined.
While this correlation may be tenuous, it enables us to
define further problems: will excavation or more systematic site
sampling confirm or deny a correlation between population use
of the high ground and bison hunting on Fort Hood? The
presence of high-ground flint sources does not account for
population flunctuation.

FUTURE PROBLEMS
As archeological investigations continue on Fort Hood, we
might expect further progression away from the original "babesin-the-woods," favorite spot techniques of the early FHAS.
Before the much-delayed institution of an archeologist’s position
at Fort Hood, I was formulating program stages characterized by
increased problem orientation, and culminating in selected excavation only in the later stages. Post archeologist F.L. Briuer has
commenced upon a uniquely flexible program, in which inter-

disciplinary archeology and salvage "mitigation" are wellbalanced. Briuer’s interest in botanical and zoological aspects of
human behavior, along with an eagerness to try innovative
sampling techniques, should be a major contribution toward
solving basic problems of regional archeology.
The prevailing practice in earlier years of collecting large,
uncontrolled samples, has caused minor disruption of artifact
patterning on the surface at a time when controlled surface
sampling methods are coming more and more into style (Davis
1975: 39-53; and Dancey 1976). This in addition to the extensive
vandalism in the more accessible areas of Fort Hood, may
present obstacles to both surface and sub-surface sampling.
Chronological data could become more completely representative following stratigraphic testing. Excavation projects
might assist in refinement of local Archaic chronologies. At Evoe
Terrace (41 BL 104), two Angostura points are evidence of
terminal Paleo-Indian occupation in the local vicinity (ca. 6,0007,000 B.C.); while 17 Perdiz, 7 Cliffton, and 10 Sca!lorn points are
evidence that Neo-American components (A.D. 500-1500) are
present (Sorrow, Shafer and Ross 1967: 123-135, and 142).
Other efforts might be directed toward an assessment of the
Fort Hood lands for archeological burial populations. Watt
(1936: 5-27) and Shafer (1971: 3) cite rockshelters in the bluffs
along the Leon River as late prehistoric burial grounds. This
pattern continues’ along the Leon and other sub-drainages, to the
Brazos River bluffs. Open burial sites on the terraces and floodplains are generally placed in the late periods of incipient village
agriculture, with the westward spread of marginal Caddoan
influences (Shafer 1971: 3). Little evidence is available on burial
populations from Archaic or earlier stages in the Fort Hood
region. Comprehensive inventories of skeletal remains in central
Texas are presented by Prewitt (1974: 51-67).
Definitive studies oLburial populations are well-represented
in the literature, notably from the North American Southwest
(Longacre 1975: 71-74). Here again, however, extensive looting in
the Fort Hood area prevented extensive studies of rockshelter
burial populations (Shafer 1971: 3). It is reasonable to expect,
however, that most open-site burials -- if any -- on Fort Hood
would be intact, and available for sampling, such as at the
Frisch Auf! site (41 FY 42) (Hester and Collins 1969).

FORT HOOD ARCHEOLOGY

235

Dwelling, or discrete occupational/activity areas, might
become evident by means of controlled surface sampling, but is
more likely to appear through excavation. Shafer (1971: 3) notes
evidence of wattle and daub structural material in association
with round ceramic, shell and bone concentrations at a site on a
narrow terrace of Elm Creek near Troy. These hint of late
prehistoric (Caddoan-like) dwellings; however no evidence of
thatching or other roof structure has been located. Archaic
dwellings pose a problem. In the absence of evidence, one may
resort to shaky ethnographic analogy to assist with hypothesisformulation, even though ethnographic connection between the
Archaic and the Neo-American is unknown. Newcomb (1961:
140} offers "the bisonhide tepee" of the Tonkawas, "small,
squat, and crude, never the tall, imposing, and beautiful lodges
typical of northern Plains tribes." Coahuiltecans placed "reed
mats and hides over bent saplings to form low, circular huts"
(Newcomb 1961: 43). Ethnographic descriptions from little or no
data leave us primarily with conjecture, and with the knowledge
that "more work needs to be done."

ARCHEOLOGY ON MILITARY LANDS
Attempts are becoming more frequent to do archeological
research on military lands. Field school and club-like activities,
some of them attaining professional or near-professional standards, are known from West Point, New York; and Fort Belvoir,
Virginia. Other posts, like Fort Sill, Oklahoma, have extensive
archeological and historical programs and museum systems.
Army and Air Force personnel on their way to Fort Irwin, California for a field exercise in 1976, were briefed on preservation
of archeological fragile patterning in the Mojave Desert. There is
an Army publication detailing some of the procedures for archeological and historical preservation programs on military
lands (U.S. Army 1975}. Finally, both Fort Bliss and Fort Hood
hired archeologists in 1977.
What should be most notable to those interested in research
potentials on military lands is the restricted or semi-restricted
nature of most such areas. Fort Hood itself is officially regarded
as "unrestricted," except in the impact area, where danger to
life and limb should be obvious; and except in certain restricted
security areas. During some military maneuvers, selected areas

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

236

of Fort Hood are off-limits to "non-combatant" individuals. Areas
of post usually open to the general public are closed to all nonhunters on holidays and weekends, during a short winter hunting
season, except between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.
Security and impact areas may thus be the only areas
relatively untouched by looters and vandals: the 57,000 acres (87
square miles) of Fort Hood’s impact area have remained almost
untouched by the present survey. If this area has remained free
of vandalism as well, it could provide the opportunity for conventional or innovative controlled sampling, and perhaps modified
versions of what Davis (1975) calls "exposed archaeology,"
coordinating with Fort Hood Range Control to undertake survey
in areas which are periodically cleared and made safe for entry.
Davis, working in the Mojave Desert, California, has taken
advantage of a segment of the China Lake Naval Gunnery Range,
no longer in use, and thus an area which long remained practically inaccessible. This area provides relatively undisturbed
archeological surface patterns for Davis’ project. Decades of
Naval bombardment of selected target areas has produced
negligible damage when compared with damage by collectors.
Good coverage by aerial remote sensing is usually available
on military posts. On Fort Hood, aerial photographs processed by
a military intelligence detachment were available for this report.
A map of 41 CV 73 was traced directly from one frame of negative transparency, taken at an altitude of 4,000 feet. If aerial
imagery does not prove useful in individual site location, it can
be used for mapping, augmenting the 1:25,000 scale Department
of Defense Orthopicto maps already available.
Another advantage to archeology on military lands is homogeneity of ownership: it is all Federal land, and one need only
clear research with Federal authorities. A disadvantage on
military lands, however, is the delay inherent in operating
through two echelons of Federal authority, and two separate
legal systems.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
As of early 1977, the archeological survey of Fort Hood
located 105 sites, both registered and unregistered according to
the TARL system, and mostly within the boundaries of the

FORT HOOD ARCHEOLOGY

237

military reservation. Using surface data, it was possible to run a
tentative settlement pattern analysis, which tends to confirm the
results of investigations in other areas in central Texas. While
the immediate purpose of the survey -- to locate, describe,
register, and publish preliminary survey results -- was
achieved, Fort Hood investigators also tentatively confirmed
central Texas Archaic patterns of late period rockshelter occupation and increased bison resource exploitation. It is hoped that
future, more extensive research on Fort Hood will enable intensified dialogue among central Texas archeologists.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
A latecomer to the Fort Hood Archeological Society (FHAS), I must extend
gratitude to many former Society members whom I have not met. James Rodgers,
at this writing pursuing graduate studies in archeology at Arizona State University, cropped up most prominently within the early half of the FHAS site survey
folders. His perseverence in early administrative as wellas research efforts is to
be admired. Much gratitude goes to Les Dix, Camille Avery, and Sid Lyons, plus
other individuals too numerous to mention.
Of the individuals with whom I was fortunate to associate, James Shirah, Les
Herring, and James Baskin stand out as Society members capable of the most
Herculean efforts. Baskin returned to Tennessee following his departure from the
Army, and later moved to Florida. In both places he became deeply involved with
amateur archeological societies, while pursuing the field academically. While at
Fort Hood, Jim assisted with (41 CV 73) and initiated (41 CV 87) much field investigation. In his own reports, and when helping to put together some of the
prolific writings of Jim Shirah, he produced excellent scientific illustrations.
Without the labors of Les Herring, the FHAS correspondence and source files
would now be in chaos.
With contagious enthusiasm, Craig McKee carried the Society through a
trying period of membership turnover until late 1975. Following Craig’s departure,
several individuals helped to develop this paper: Michelle Pemberton and John
Tyler assisted with the photography, while Barbara Taylor drafted most of the illustrations. In the field, Rudy Purificato showed enthusiastic interest, while Pat
Tucker and Mark Rittenaur embarked on site-location surveys of their own.
"Outsiders" who provided the most encouragement have been Olin McCormick, Institute of Applied Sciences, North Texas State University, Denton; and
Bob Burleson, former President of the Texas Archeological Society.
Dr. Frederick L. Briuer, who assumed the position of Post Archeologist in
October, 1977, expressed much gratitude for our shaky start in the archeology of
Fort Hood. I especially thank him for his much-needed intellectual stimulation in
the last month and a half of my sojourn in the Army.
I apologize to those many former, and few current members of FHAS I failed
to mention.

An Archeologlcal Survey in
the South Concho River Area,
West Central Texas
DARRELL CREEL

ABSTRACT
A small area along the South Concho River in west central
Texas was surveyed in an effort to correlate different archeological
remains with microenvironmental zones. The recovered data suggest
a subsistence-settlement pattern in which occupation and most of the
food procurement occurred in the riparian zone. Exploitation of the
flatlands or outwash plains probably was restricted to procurement
of animal foods, while the most apparent use of upland areas was
procurement of lithic raw materials

INTRODUCTION
West Central Texas is rich in cultural remains, though poorly
understood archeologically. In an effort to learn more about prehistoric resource use in the region, a small area along the South
Concho River (Tom Green County) was systematically surveyed by
the author for archeological sites on several occasions in 1975 and
1976. To protect these sites, all locational references herein are
nonspecific; persons should contact the author for more detailed
information.
Prior to this study, it was known that the study area contained
abundant archeological remains, including most notably, burned
rock middens. The area was also known to have been essentially a
prairie until perhaps 75-100 years ago when widespread expansion of mesquite, juniper, and oak began (Figs. 1-3). This naturally

242

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

raised the question of what resource(s) had been exploited that
resulted in the large accumulations of burned rock and other
cultural debris. None of the plants whose processing produced the
burned rock middens of west and southwest Texas presently occur
in the region (Greer 1965: Shafer 1970). Were the oaks and pecan
now found near the streams present in prehistoric times and were
these the resources that were utilized? These questions led to
further speculation concerning the overall nature of prehistoric
resource use, and this speculation in turn led to the investigation
reported here. With the abovementioned questions as stimuli, a
general objective was set forth for the study.
The objective of the investigation was to determine the relationships between the distribution of resources and the
distribution of the various types of archeological remains. As a
primary objective, this aim is founded on the concept that "... the
determination of resource use tends to precede and condition the
site placements and demographic arrangements of a huntergatherer group" (Jochim 1976: 12). Assuming that all archeological
remains are those of hunting and gathering populations, the focus
of the investigation can be directed toward the general resource
exploitation patterns characteristic of aboriginal populations in
the area.
This objective required a standard survey of the archeological
remains to determine the number of sites present and the nature of
their content. From the survey, preliminary concepts of site type,
size, condition, and, whenever possible, age were to be developed
as necessary antecedants to further investigation. These kinds of
information certainly must be gathered as a broad data base
before specific questions can be answered or hypotheses t~sted.
Perhaps appropriately mentioned at this early point is the
particularly flexible nature of the investigation, in as much as it
has influenced the appraisal of the archeological remains. The
relative lack of time restraints on the survey is the most significant
aspect of the flexibility, for it made possible at least two visits to
nearly every site, each during a different time of the year. In many
cases, the overall appearance of sites changed considerably from
one visit to the next and often influenced the determination of site
structure and content. Not only were the archeological remains
seen in differing conditions, but their environmental situations
were observed as they varied with seasonal change. As will be
explained later, these observations on environmental changes

frequently provided important bits of data for understanding the
differential availability of certain resources. Repeated visits to any
research area during all seasons of the year appear to be essential
for adequate investigation into environmental relationships; the
investigator in effect gains a greater appreciation of the subtle
peculiarities of his research area.

RESEARCH DESIGN
A research design that would fulfill the previously mentioned objective, had to be based on two assumptions. Foremost,
is the already noted assumption that the population(s), whose
relationships with the environment are the subject of the investigation, were hunters and gatherers. The second assumption, as
implied, is that patterned relationships between the environment
and culture as an adaptive system do in fact exist and are
amenable to observation and analysis.

CONCHO RIVER ARCHEOLOGY

245

Assumption I
All available evidence indicates that the prehistoric and
historic aboriginal groups who inhabited the region surrounding
the research area were hunters and gatherers (Suhm 1960: 73;
Shafer 1971: 131; Weir 1976). The archeological remains investigated in west central Texas clearly are similar to those of
adjacent regions where the peoples were hunters and gatherers
(Shafer 1969: 95; Green 1961: 194-196). Similarly, groups known
to have been in the area during historic times--Jumano, Lipan
Apache, Comanche, and perhaps the Tonkawa--were also
hunting and gathering peoples, although some of the Lipan
Apache occasionally gardened (Newcomb 1961: 113).
Assumption II
According to Struever (1968: 136), a population’s articulation with its environment through patterned relationships occurs
within two milieus, one biophysical, the other social. Archeological investigation generally is restricted to evidence from the
biophysical realm. In this respect,
The most accessible and direct relationship between a culture and its
environment is expressed in its technological and economic adaptations, and those cultural forms most closely related with these
pursuits (Fitzhugh 1972: 7).

Expressions of these relationships are most evident in a population’s subsistence-settlement pattern.
Subsistence can be defined as the extraction of biological
energy from the environment and in hunting-gathering societies is
basically determined by technology and resource potential. Given
that a population’s environment contains sufficient exploitable
resources, extraction of biological energy at predetermined levels
requires an adequate technology. Thus, a population must not only
possess the techniques for procuring energy, it must also be capable of processing the energy into a consumable form.
With an adequate technology, extraction of energy (in contrast with production) is largely dependent on resource potential,
which is itself a function of distribution in both time and space.
Energy harvest at predefined levels is necessarily adapted to
temporal and geographical variation in potential; therefore,
evidence of this adaptation in terms of procurement, processing,

246

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

and consumption should be reflected in the patterned remains of
the archeological record. Similar extractive activities can be
expected to produce patterned remains indicative of those activities. Essentially then, a correlation must exist between the
archeological remains and the patterned structure of the biophysical environment as influenced to a varying extent by the social
environment. This configuration is observable as a population’s
subsistence-settlement pattern, with the different settlement types
exhibiting different material remains.

RESEARCH STRATEGY
Predicated on the objective of this investigation and the two
assumptions discussed above, the research strategy and the
presentation in this report logically involve four phases.
I. A brief review of general patterns in hunter-gatherer subsistence-settlement systems is presented. The focus is on
those patterned relationships between populations and
their environment that lend themselves to archeological
investigation.
II. With the background data and expectations derived from
the first phase of research, the strategy shifts to actual
investigation of the study area. Phase II, then, is the investigation of the biophysical environment of both the research
area and the surrounding region. Intensive analysis of the
survey area must necessarily be complemented by a more
general regional analysis since the ecosystem of which it is
part is certainly not delimited by the arbitrary survey
boundaries. Investigation includes past and present environments, as well as the nature of their differences.
III. Phase III is the archeological investigation and analysis of
the recovered data. Consideration is given the nature of the
data, including the sites, features, artifacts, and other
remains. From the analysis, hopefully, qualitative and
quantitative differences among site types can be demonstrated.
IV. The final phase synthesizes the information gathered
during the preceding phases and essentially is an attempt
at correlation of the environmental and archeological data
in terms of resource exploitation. In addition, Phase IV, as
an overall synthesis, will be a measure of this investiga-

CONCHO RIVER ARCHEOLOGY

tion’s contribution toward an understanding of prehistoric
resource utilization systems in Texas and adjoining areas.

HUNTER-GATHERER SUBSISTENCE AND SETTLEMENT
Making the assumption that the archeological remains in the
reserach area are those of hunting and gathering peoples,
certain generalizations on subsistence-settlement patterns of
such populations must be borne in mind in an investigation of
resource utilization. Several such regularities have been ethnographically observed in many hunting-gathering societies and are
generally assumed to apply as well to societies known only
through archeological remains. Recognizing, of course, that the
arbitrarily delineated research area cannot be expected to
correspond to any prehistoric group’s concept of "its territory,"
the focus of this review is necessarily directed away from
comments on territoriality and toward characteristics of group
composition, subsistence, and settlement.
Typical of all known hunting and gathering societies is a
social unit composed of those individuals, generally related, who
interact with one another on a day-to-day basis (Murdock 1949:
79}. Known by several names, in this report, such a group is
termed a band. It is the basic exploitation unit whose flexibility
in composition allows for variable response to environmental
conditions, both social and biophysical.
... the fluid organization of recent hunters has certain adaptive
advantages, including the adjustment of group size to resources, the
leveling out of demographic variance, and the resolution of conflict
by fission (Lee and DeVore 1968: 8).

When resources permit, two or more bands frequently congregate
to take advantage of the surplus as well as the opportunity for
social interaction. Coahuiltecan bands, for example, came together
for "tuna fests" in areas where prickly pear (Opuntia sp.) fruit was
especially abundant (Hodge 1907).
Another social unit characteristic of hunting and gathering
peoples is that known as the "dialectal tribe"; it is the largest
group having face-to-face contact at some point in the yearly
round. "In short, the dialectal tribe can be defined as a collection
of interacting groups.., sharing a linguistic dialect and forming a

248

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

territory-specific cultural and genetic unit" (Nunley 1973:25).
When studying the archeological record of hunter-gatherers
for information about social organization, one should keep in mind
certain concepts set forth by Jochim (1976). He found five objectives that guide decisions about population aggregation:
1. Provision of food for the population.
2. Resource procurement in the predetermined proportions at low cost.
3. Resource procurement in the predetermined proportions with high
security.
4. Insurance of reproductive viability.
5. Provision of social interaction {Jochim 1976: 70).

The first three, perhaps, lend themselves most directly to observation and interpretation in archeological research, for they
are often discernible from intra- and extrasite evidence. Intrasite
evidence can consist of faunal and floral remains as well as artifacts. Extrasite evidence is derived from environmental studies,
both qualitative and quantitative, and can be most useful in
studying resource procurement at low cost and with high security.
Inferences may then be possible about potential and probable
group size.
Jochim has proposed that two major goals guide resource use
decisions among hunter-gatherer groups:
1. The attainment of a secure level of food and manufacturing needs.
2. The maintenance of energy expenditure within a predefined range,
determined partly by the need for population aggregation (1976: 19).

Certainly, cultural definition of what constitutes a "secure level"
and the acceptable range of energy expenditure must be conditioned by resource availability or potential. Fortunately, availability can be studied in modern environments and frequently can
be estimated to varying degrees for paleoenvironments. Resources
commonly considered include water, food, fuel, and raw materials
for manufacture of tools and other needed or desired items.
Although procurement of food at a secure level is clearly a
primary concern, the desire and perhaps nutritional necessity
for variety in the diet is also a strong influence.
Whenever two or more kinds of natural foods are available, one
would predict that the population exploiting them would emphasize
the more reliable source. We would also expect, however, that the

CONCHO RIVER ARCHEOLOGY

249

people would not neglect the alternative means of subsistence (Lee
1968: 41).

In this respect, gathering generally functions as the economic
backbone of hunting and gathering societies, even though it may be
considered by them to supply supplementary foods and is avoided
when possible (Nunley 1973: 23-240. Conversely, while hunting
and/or fishing may provide only a fraction of the diet, they tend to
be held more important.
The more secure a resource, the greater is its attraction for
settlement. Typically, settlements are located nearer denser and
less mobile resources. Food, fuel, water, view, and provision for
shelter appear to determine immediate location of camp sites.
Again following ]ochim (1976: 50),
The primary goals which operate in settlement placement among
hunter-gatherers, then, may be summarized as follows:
1. Proximity of economic resources
2. Shelter and protection from the elements.
3. View for observation of game and strangers.

With the seasonal and geographic variation in resource availability characteristic of most areas, occupation of a particular location
usually can be expected to coincide with the availability of the economically important resources. Degree of permanency of a settlement is partly a function of this restricted availability; thus,
hunter-gatherer groups typically change location in order to take
advantage of the variation.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS
An ecologically oriented archeological investigation must of
necessity include analysis of the structure of the biophysical environment and should consider both temporal and spatial variation
not only of the study area itself but of the surrounding region as
well. For this project, environmental data were gathered in two
ways: field investigation and literature research. Only through a
combination of the two was it possible to prepare a data set for
correlation with the archeological findings.
The actual field investigation was carried out by the author
while surveying for archeological remains. The data gathered are

250

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

primarily spatial in nature although important information on
seasonal change was also obtained. Significantly, the numerous
trips to the research area during all seasons of the year are felt to
have provided a more nearly complete assessment of the present
environment.
The data gleaned from the literature supplement that from the
field investigation and represent the major present source of information on the paleoenvironment. As a result of having to rely
primarily on tentative paleoenvironmental reconstructions of
somewhat distant regions, the temporal data are necessarily
generalized. It should be noted however, that the research area is
centrally located among three regions whose environmental
histories are better known though based in part on relatively
limited data, and therefore, generalizations derived from them are
considered reasonably applicable.
The following discussion of the environment will begin with
consideration of the analytical unit used in describing the ecological history of the research area and surrounding regions. With the
least known environments first, the discussion proceeds from the
end of the most recent glacial period to the better known present,
attention being focused on resource potential (insofar as the data
permit).
Because of its arbitrary boundaries and small size, the
research area in all probability does not correspond as a whole to
any aboriginally conceived cultural-spatial unit such as a band
territory. Therfore, in this study, the only spatial unit employed,
the microenvironment, is defined primarily, but not solely, on
ecological terms. The working definition used herein is taken from
Fitzhugh (1972: 138):
A minimal ecological unit of the environment usually with a distinct
faunal and floral signature. When defined in terms of culture it may
be a small portion of a local environment. Cultural adaptations are
generally geared to exploit the microenvironment including its varied
resources, rather than individual resource areas since in the microenvironment there are several resources available.

Given the gradient nature of the environment, it is clearly
recognized that actual boundaries separating microenvironments
are often difficult to delineate, if in fact they do exist as such;
characteristically, microenvironments interdigitate with one
another in a transitional zone known as an "ecotone" (Odum 1959:

CONCHO RIVER ARCHEOLOGY

251

278). Thus, the boundaries shown in Fig. 4 are approximate only
and in general reflect solely the linear extent of ecotones.
ECOLOGICAL HISTORY
Before describing in detail the recognized research area
microenvironments, it is necessary to consider the proposed development since 10,000 B.P. of the regional environment. As noted
previously, no study has yet been made of the paleoenvironment of
the research area itself, yet hypothesized reconstructions are
available for the LLano Estacado (north and northwest), the Lower
Pecos region (south and southwest), and the eastern part of central
Texas (southeast). These reconstructions are based on pollen
records from both archeological and non-archeological sties and
have synthesized the bulk of the available data.
Widespread climatic and vegetational transition in all three
regions is implied for the time following the end of the last glacial
(Bryant 1969: 145; Oldfield and Schoenwetter 1975: 167-168;
Bryant and Shafer 1977). Mesophytic parklands predominated
over the whole area before the shift toward savanna-like
vegetation. On the Llano Estacado, the pollen record for the Yellow
House Interval from 10,000-9000 B.P. suggests a gradual decrease
in pine frequency; that is, herb and scrub communities were
replacing the pinyon pine parkland, probably through declining
effective moisture. Pinyon was still common in the San Jon Subpluvial, 9000-7000 B.P., with no really drastic shift in vegetation
zones; "... mixed prairie communities are indicated over most of
the LLano between scattered stands of pinyon parkland in the most
favorable area" (Oldfield and Schoenwetter 1975: 168). As a
whole, the trend was generally toward a less mesic environment.
A similar progression is suggested by the pollen evidence for
the same time periods in both central Texas and the Lower Pecos
region. Bryant (1969: 118, 120) proposes that in the Lower Pecos,
the predominantly pinyon parklands of 10,000-7000 B.P. remained
relatively stable, though the climate was tending toward increasing aridity and the vegetation toward savanna-like conditions. Similarly, the mixed deciduous parklands of central Texas
were gradually being replaced by savanna vegetations of grasses,
oak, and hickory (Bryant 1969: 130).
Apparently inhabiting during this time both central and west
Texsa, as well as the Llano Estacado, were now-extinct species of

252

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

bison; this is implied by the presence of their bones in several
archeological sites dated between 12,000 and 8000-7000 B.P.
(Dillehay 1974: 181-182).
The trend toward less mesic conditions continues from 70004500 B.P. in all three regions. On the Llano Estacado, the vegetation had by about 7000 B.P. already approximated that of the
present as indicated by the pollen record; Oldfield and Schoenwetter (1975: 169) suggest that the region was an essentially
treeless prairie. With minor differences, a similar situation is
thought to have prevailed in central Texas. According to Bryant
(1969: 130-131), grasses increase, while the percentage of arboreal
vegetation is, with the exception of oak, generally low. Significantly, Bryant further proposes that, in at least one locality (South
Soefje Bog), a relatively high availability of water may have supported a restricted oak-ash-hickory parkland.
In the Lower Pecos region, the period from 7000-4500 B.P. is
characterized by erosional contacts in the alluvial sediments.
Analysis of pollen from pre- and post-erosional deposits indicates
a general trend toward less mesic conditions, with mesquite,
acacia, and agave first appearing in the pollen record in the
post-erosional deposits (Bryant 1969: 119-120). This observed or
suggested trend toward a less mesic environment in the Lower
Pecos, as well as central Texas and the Llano Estacado, may
perhaps partially explain the general absence of bison remains
in archeological sites in these regions (Dillehay 1974: 185). It is
at least arguable that the bison inhabiting the woodlands and
parklands of the Southern Plains prior to about 7000 B.P.
became extinct possibly as a result of their inability to adapt to
the changing environment.
The bones of modern bison occur widely in components from
about 4500 to 1500 B.P., but are not found from 1500 to 700-800
B.P. (Dillehay 1974: 182, 184). Their presence after 700-800 B.P.
is noted both by the occurrence of bone in archeological sites
and later by firsthand observation; they were documented as far
south as the Texas coastal plain by Cabeza de Vaca in 1533
(Hodge 1907: 68). The bison inhabiting these regions was clearly
a creature adapted to a prairie environment.
Such prairie conditions are clearly indicated by the pollen
record from about 4500 B.P. until the present in both the Llano
Estacado and the Lower Pecos region, less clearly in central
Texas (Oldfield and Schoenwetter 1975: 169; Bryant 1969: 145-

CONCHO RIVER ARCHEOLOGY

253

146). The general trend toward less mesic environments was
interrupted by a short period of more mesic conditions around
2500 B.P., but all regions are considered to have remained
essentially prairies and/or savannas composed primarily of oaks,
hickories, and grasses.
An incomplete survey of the literature suggests that since
perhaps as early as 4500 B.P., the faunal composition of these
regions--mammals at least--was remarkably similar to that
reported in historic times (Davis 1974}. This similarity is, as a
result of the inherent biases of the data, observable on a
qualitative basis only. More specifically, faunal lists from central
Texas archeological sites reveal that modern deer, bison, and
smaller mammals, reptiles, birds, mussels, and snails have all
been present during this period (Tunnell 1962; Sorrow et el.
1967). Likewise, the data from the Lower Pecos region indicate a
relatively unchanged species configuration in the last 7000-8000
years (Ruben 1968; Raun and Eck 1967; Word and Douglas 1970;
Prewitt 1970; Ken Lord, personal communication 1977). In
general, much the same can be said for the Llano Estacado
(Johnson 1976).
Summarizing then, the pollen records from the Llano
Estacado, the Lower Pecos region, and central Texas indicate a
general trend toward increased aridity after 10,000 B.P. By
about 7000 B.P., the vegetation was approximating that existent
100-200 years ago; as will be discussed subsequently, changes
since then appear to be more of degree than of kind. Because of
its intimate systemic relationships with the vegetation, the fauna
predictably appear to have concurrently developed a configuration similar to that of 100-200 years ago. Given, (1) the relatively
minor overall differences in physiography between these three
regions, (2) their rather similar ecological histories, and (3) the
gradient nature of environmental conditions, it seems reasonable
to infer that the centrally located research area experienced an
environmental evolution generally paralleling that of adjacent
regions. Therefore, it is suggested that the microenvironmental
structure of west central Texas since about 7000-8000 B.P. probably did not differ appreciably from that observable a century or
two ago, or, with certain modifications, that observable at the
present time.

254

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

The Modern Environment
In addition to providing general information on the region,
this section deals primarily with the microenvironmental configuration in the research area over the past 200-300 years. To a
large extent, the microenvironments defined in this study are
detectable in descriptions written before changes were brought
about by Anglo-American land-use practices; observed differences are discussed more fully below.

Climate
Climatically, the region is classified as semi-arid, that is,
predominantly warm and dry (Wiedenfeld and Flores 1976: 55).
Precipitation, mainly in the form of rainshowers and thunderstorms, averages about 18-19 inches per year, most of it from
April through October (Mount et al. 1967: 12); documented
variation in annual total ranges from 7.41 to 40.40 inches. The
average number of days between the last freeze of the spring
and the first in the fall is 232, the mean dates being March 24
and November 13, respectively. Freezes have, however, occurred
as late as April 18 and as early as October 16 (Wiedenfeld and
Flores 1976: 55).
Physiography
The regional context of the research area has been
described in several ways. Fenneman (1931) places the region in
the Edwards Plateau Section of the Great Plains Province; in
southern Tom Green County, it is characterized by rolling hills
formed by erosion of the once-flat plateau surface. Elevation
differences between the river bottoms and the hilltops often are
as much as 100-125 meters. Along some stretches of the streams,
steep bluffs are common and occasionally contain small rockshelters.
Biota
In terms of now present flora and fauna, Blair (1950) includes the research area in the Balconian Biotic Province. It is
characterized by an intermixture of plants and animals from
adjacent provinces, though, as a whole, the biotic composition is
rather distinctive. In similarly broad terms, Thomas (1975)
considers the locality to be part of the Edwards Plateau
Vegetational Area, which is largely grassland or open savanna.
More specifically, Eckhardt (1975) has defined for southern Tom

CONCHO RIVER ARCHEOLOGY

255

Green County two contrasting vegetation types: juniper and oak
savannas and stream riparian. While the species list has
remained the same, the change in relative abundance of several
plants and animals over the past century has appreciably
altered the environmental appearance. Of particular concern
are certain species known through ethnographic documentation
to have been economically important to aboriginal groups
inhabiting the area. Thus, it seems appropriate at this point to
use early observations of the region as a beginning of the
description of that microenvironmental configuration proposed to
be characteristic of the past 7000-8000 years.
Historical Descriptions of the Region
If the route proposed by Williams (1962; see also Coimor
1969) is accepted, then Mendoza in 1684 travelled south from
about present San Angelo to the headwaters of the Llano River,
possibly up the South Concho itself. Mendoza noted several times
the lush vegetation along the streams, particularly the pecans;
he also mentioned the abundance of bison, fish, "wild hens,"
mussels, and good pasturage (Bolton 1908: 336-337). Similarly, in
1808, the Spaniard Amangual described sparsely wooded
uplands and plains, with woods (pecans and others) along the
streams (Haggard 1939: 9-12).
About 40 years later, John Russell Bartlett passed near the
research area. The streams were said to contain an abundance
of fish, with large oak and pecan trees growing along the banks
(Bartlett 1854). Looking in the general direction of the research
area, he noted, "To the south were hills within a few miles, quite
barren in appearance" (Bartlett 1854: 73-74). The prairies,
described as deficient in wood except for oaks and mesquites
kept few and small by frequent grassfires, were inhabited by
large numbers of prairie dogs, as well as "jackass-rabbits."
One of the more explicit accounts is that of Lloyd (1887),
whose descriptions were introductory to his bird list. He noted
that the hills were not timbered though they often were covered
with "shin-oak," and that the head draws of the creeks were full
of cedar groves. In addition, he wrote that:
The creeks are well timbered with pecan, elm, hackberry, a species
of walnut, and willow, etc., and have well defined bottoms of an
average width of about fifty yards, but frequently are half a mile
wide, densely grown with scrub mesquite, small groves of hackberry,
wild china, and other small trees, overrun with poison iw], and laden
with parasitic mistletoe (Lloyd 1887: 182).

256

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Thus, a synthesis of these early descriptions suggests a
general configuration of three microenvironments in the region:
the hills, the more nearly level flatlands, and the riparian zone.
All three are presently recognizable in the research area, though
certainly somewhat changed. Most noticeable is the tremendous
increase in brushy plants, cedar and mesquite in particular, and,
to a lesser extent perhaps, the live oak. A hypothesized
elimination of bison, priarie dogs, and possibly antelope is based
on faunal remains from archeological sites. Thus, to varying
degrees, the horizontal distribution of the microenvironments
illustrated in Fig. 4, while considered to be a relatively accurate
representation of that existent 100 years ago, is only that recognized during this research.
The Research Area
As noted, the three microenvironments observable on a
regional basis are present within the research area (Fig. 4). For
convenience, the riprian, flatland, and upland microenvironments are designated I, II, and III respectively. In approximate
terms, of the 20.0 square kilometer study area, the riparian zone
occupies 23% (4.7 kin2), the flatlands 43% (8.7 kin2), and the
uplands 34% (6.3 km~). This coverage results from the fact that
the survey more or less transected the South Concho valley and
adjacent uplands. It is important to note here, though, that the
microenvironmental configuration of the research area, viewed
in. terms of proportional size, is not necessarily representative of
the surrounding region, however delineated.
I. Riparian Microenvironment. As implied by the name, this
zone encompasses the streams and their alluvial floodplains. In
general, the extent is defined by interrelated physical characteristics and is reflected--in some areas, less clearly than
others--by the presence or absence of certain plants and
animals. The most important factor is the greater amount of
moisture, either in the form of surface water or available soil
moisture.
The floodplain deposits of Quaternary alluvium are classed
in the Rio-concho-Spur association of deep, nearly level,
calcareous soils with high available water capacity (Wiedenfeld
and Flores 1976: 38, 18). Where not cultivated, these fertile
soils with their greater moisture availability support a vegetation
dominated, in appearance at least, by huge live oaks (Quercus
virginianus var. fusiformis), bur oaks (Quercus macrocarpa),

CONCHO RIVER ARCHEOLOGY

257

and pecan (Carya illinoensis) (see Figure 1). Also common are
hackberry (Celtis sp.), persimmon (Diospyros texana), mesquite
(Prosopsis glandulosa), and numerous other edible or useful
plants. In many places, almost impenetrable thickets of trees,
shrubs, and green briar (Smilax bona-nox) occur, making survey
somewhat difficult. Along the intermittent streams, this dense
vegetation begins to thin until, generally restricted to a narrow
strip along the stream banks, it too becomes intermittent.
In the riparian microenvironment, floral resources are
particularly abundant, especially in terms of fuel and edible
plants. Fruits, berries, and forbs occur widely but are perhaps
overshadowed by the tremendous amounts of acorns and pecans.
Some of the berries and forbs are available in the spring; yet, as
a rule, the vegetal foods are most abundant in late summer and
fall. This is most notably true of the acorns and pecans, though
there is a great deal of variation in annual yield resulting from
the interplay of species differences, insect damage, precipitation,
temperature, and wind. A particular bur oak, for example, may
bear acorns every other year but often it bears only once in
four, five, or more years. Thus, in a certain year in any one
area, these resources might be scarce, when other years they
might be unusually bountiful.
The fauna of the riparian microenvironment (determined by
personal observation and by faunal remains) is readily separable
into two groups: those species spending most or all of their time
in the water and the terrestrial species which generally restrict
themselves to the floodplain. Included in the former group are
the fishes, turtles, mussels, muskrat, and numerous species of
waterfowl. In the second group are deer, turkey, squirrels,
cottontail rabbits, skunks, raccoons, and a variety of other small
animals; occasionally, animals such as bison which generally
occupied the other microenvironments probably came to this
zone to get water.
Flint is available in certain parts of this zone but is not
abundant in any one place. In and along the streams, good
quality cobbles of varying sizes occasionally occur; other sources
generally are at the periphery of this zone and may extend into
adjoining microenvironments. Much the same can be said of the
distribution of limestone, although it certainly is more common
than flint in all areas.

II. Flatlands Microenvironment. Generally speaking, this
microewAronment is defined by the extent of the Angelo association of deep, nearly level, calcareous soils on outwash plains
(Wiedenfeld and Flores 1976: 3). In present appearance, it is distinguishable mainly by its relatively heavy grass cover and in
certain areas by an abundance of mesquite (Figure 2). Prickly
pear (Opuntia sp.) and small "mottes" of live oak also occasionally occur, but like the mesquite, were probably not as
widespread 100-200 years ago.
The fauna, as well, appears to have changed in the last century. While not visually observed, the past presence of badger,
prairie dog, bison, and possibly antelope is suggested by the
occurrence of their bones in archeological sites (TG 40 and TG
41). Assuming that these animals did inhabit the survey area,
they most likely were to be found in the flatlands and/or the
uplands. The prairie dog, at least, probably was restricted to the
flatlands because it could not burrow in the uplands nor would it
live in the riparian zone where the vegetation limits visibility. This
requirement of visibility probably made the prairie dog an agent
in maintaining the integrity of the flatlands microenvironment.
Prior to its extermination and modern land-use practices, the
prairie dog, fire, and bison all contributed to a check on the
growth and spread of brush plants such as mesquite and live oak
(Maxwell n.d.; Davis 1974; Smith 1967). They, in effect, maintained the prairie conditions.
As a microenvironment then, the flatlands are differentiated
from the riparian by the drier soils, their resultant prairie flora,
and fauna. Lithic resources are less abundant and tend to be
localized in light concentrations on low rises.
III. Upland Microenvironment. In some ways, the uplands
resemble the flatlands, though their respective resource arrays
provide the nonphysiographic criteria for separating them. The
rolling limestone hills typically have a very rocky surface and
are in the Tarrant-Ector association of very shallow, well
drained, calcareous soils (Wiedenfeld and Flores 1976: 3).
Throughout the uplands at a certain elevation is a continuous
outcropping of flint of varying quality in both ledge and nodule
form; this and other outcroppings contain large amounts of
eroded flint.
Like the flatlands, the upland flora is dominated by grasses,
although trees and shrubs are common (Figure 3). In some parts,

260

cedar (luniprus pinchotii) has over the last 100-200 years expanded considerably from the steeper slopes. Live oak, mesquite,
hackberry, and prickly pear also are widespread now but probably were less so in the past; persimmon and beargrass (Nolina
texana) are less abundant and tend to be more localized. While
found throughout this microenvironment, persimmon is especially
common on the steeper slopes. Beargrass, today, is almost
completely restricted to the hills in the eastern portion of the
survey area.
Animals observed by the author to be presently inhabiting
the uplands include the whitetail deer, turkey, cottontail rabbit,
jackrabbit, rock squirrel, and various other small mammals,
reptiles, and birds. When present in the region, bison probably
were frequent on the more gentle slopes as well as in the
flatlands; the same may also be true of the antelope.
The previously mentioned historical descriptions of the area
indicate that the uplands, in general, were predominantly grassland with restricted growths of woody plants. This condition
appears to be a function of several factors including physical
conditions, herbivore control, and fire.
In terms of resource potential, then, the three research area
microenvironments appears to differ qualitatively and quantitatively, especially as they are hypothetically reconstructed
(see Table I). Each offers a unique set of resources. The riparian
zone is the only one where surface water is available. It also has
by far the greatest amount of plant foods, particularly the easily
procurable and storable acorns and pecans, though they are
generally only seasonally available. The vegetation, in addition,
provides a large fuel supply as well as protection from the
elements. Its faunal resources as a whole probably offer a yearround contribution to human diet. In one respect, the riparian
zone is relatively deficient; that is, it has no large, concentrated
sources of good quality lithic (flint) raw material.
Generally speaking, this scarcity of flint raw material is also
characteristic of the flatlands. This microenvironment is,
however, mostly lacking in plant foods that are procurable in
large amounts with low cost. On the other hand, the hypothesized fauna could provide significant amounts of meat and
nonfood materials such as bone and hides, depending though on
temporal availability.

With the exception of the prairie dog, the uplands likely
shared many of the animal populations (for example, bison and
perhaps antelope) found in the adjacent flatlands. In contrast, they
offer, in localized situations, relatively substantial sources of

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

262

easily gathered plant foods (acorns and persimmons), as well as
manufacturing raw materials (the leaves of beargrass for use in
construction of baskets). The uplands, moreover, contain what the
other microenvironments lack: extensive and heavy concentrations
of readily usable flint.
Thus, it is apparent that economic resources are differentially
available in the research area; their distribution probably strongly
influenced subsistence-settlement patterns. Movement between
microenvironments is easy and the resources of each are readily
accessible from the others.

ARCHEOLOGICAL DATA
Survey Methodology

As previously noted, the survey area comprises approximately 20 square kilometers in the drainage of the South
Concho River. No special significance is attached to this size; it
merely represents the area that had been covered when the
decision was made to terminate the field work. The boundaries,
however, are almost exclusively delimited by private property
lines, with the exceptions being determined primarily by the
extent of survey coverage at the cut-off date. Although these
limits are indeed rather arbitrary, they are not considered to
have restrictively biased the data.
In terms of logistics, the primary objective of the survey was
to completely cover a large block of land that reflected the environmental variation of the vicinity. Through such a 100%
coverage procedure, it was expected that a representative
sample of site types from the region would be observed. Total
coverage was accomplished with a maximum of consistency by
the author personally walking over the entire area. This survey,
being basically documentary, was to be supplemented by subsequent controlled surface collections. It was felt that such a
procedure should produce data that would allow for projections
over a much larger region. In actual fact though, circumstances
of site discovery suggest that as yet undetected archeological
remains may lie buried in the alluvium of the riparian microenvironment; this, however, is not felt to affect significantly the
overall results of the project.
Procedure in the field consisted of systematically covering

CONCHO RIVER ARCHEOLOGY

263

the area in order to locate and assess any archeological
remains. When evidence was discovered, its surface extent was
determined; as a rule, a site designation was given only to
locations subjectively perceived as exhibiting an aggregation of
artifacts or other evidence of human activity. To explain further,
it is important to note that large areas, particularly along the
streams, contain cultural debris throughout, but with certain
spots having a higher frequency. While these spots received site
designations, the more or less isolated artifacts are not
represented in the inventory, though their distribution has been
noted. Because of factors such as heavy ground vegetation or
thick mantles of fallen leaves, the observed frequencies are in
many instances perhaps more apparent than real; therefore,
partly in order to compensate for these limitations, nearly every
site was visited at least twice during different seasons of the
year. The uplands in the eastern portion of the survey area
presented a somewhat different problem. They are "belted" by a
continuous flint outcropping which exhibits abundant evidence of
aborigina! use; in these cases, drainages were employed as
arbitrary site boundaries.
Designated sites were numbered according to the University
of Texas system: 41, for Texas; TG, for Tom Green County; and a
number for that specific site. When a site was found, it was
thoroughly and carefully examined to define its extent and
content, at least so far as could be determined from surface
evidence. Sketch maps were made for most sites. However, all
were plotted on USGS 7.5 minute topographical maps in such a
manner as to reflect their horizontal extent. Notes taken at each
site included information on features, numbers and kinds of
artifacts, site size, environment, condition, and other factors
affecting assessment.
Consistent with the plans of possible controlled collection,
the practice was merely to observe the archeological remains at
each site, thereby preserving the integrity of provenience and
context. In some cases where part of a site had been disturbed
and/or displaced material was clearly in danger of damage or
loss, collections of artifacts were made. This is most notably true
of 41 TG 41, where erosion is causing material to slip down the
steep stream bank. In a very few instances, individual artifacts
were taken from apparently undisturbed contexts.
Appropriately mentioned here are the first four sites in

264

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Table II; these had been known to the author for several years
prior to the survey. Uncontrolled collections of varying size had
been made from each, three (41 TG 38, 39, and 41) by surface
collection and the other (41 TG 40) by excavation. These early
collections from 41 TG 38 and 41 TG 39 consist almost entirely
of projectile points, while that from 41 TG 41 contains all bone
and lithics observed in the eroded context described above.
Of special concern is 41 TG 40, a small cave containing dry
fill. The front part, approximately 4 x 2 meters, was essentially
completely excavated, with all of the fill put through a 1/~-inch
mesh screen. All flint, nearly all of the faunal remains, and
certain other material were saved. Since all flint from within the
excavated portion was collected, the lithic assemblage as a
whole has some utility for comparative purposes. The value of
the recovered faunal remains, as well as of the observed and
noted botanical remains, lies in making one acutely aware of the
interpretive limitations of data from open sites, especially those
known only from their surface manifestations.
Table II presents an inventory of sites located during the
survey with brief descriptions of each and with comments on
factors that are felt to have affected assessment of the archeological remains. In addition, the microenvironmental location and
a descriptive site type are noted for each site; these site types
are defined in the final part of this section.
In the brief description of each site, the amount and
diversity of observed and/or collected cultural material is noted.
An assemblage described as "diverse" is one observed to
contain a variety of artifacts of different kinds, i.e. projectile
points, bifaces, unifaces, cores, flakes, etc.; one of medium
diversity, on the other hand, contains only a few kinds, while an
assemblage of little diversity contains only one or two kinds.
These distinctions certainly are subjective, yet in many cases,
this is perhaps partly a function of conditions, such as heavy
ground cover, which limited assessment.
These data on the observed assemblages are presented in
qualitative terms in Table IV; it should be made explicit,
however, that the categories represent a condensed version of
the more detailed classification that was employed only for the
collected artifacts (see Tables V, VI, and VII). In other words,
the categories in Table IV are those which, as a general rule,
were used in the field notes. Of primary concern are the

groupings of bifaces and unifaces. In general, "thin bifaces" in
Table IV correspond to the Group I bifaces and the "thick
bifaces" to Groups II and III. The group of "side scrapers and
other unifaces" merely includes all unifaces that are not end
scrapers (the end scraper group is the same in both versions).
Similarly, all observed utilized flakes are grouped together in
Table IV, while those that were collected are put into two
separate categories. These additional data biases further make
the assemblage diversity designations in Table II subjective.

ARCHEOLOGICAL REMAINS
The Features
Several kinds of features were observed during the course
of the survey: hearths, burned rock middens, burned rock accumulations, bedrock mortar holes, pictographs, and a pile of
boulders with a central pit. In addition, the landowners report
the excavation and removal of bones and antler artifacts from a
burial situated on the top of the hill at 41 TG 46.
HEARTHS. Hearths consisted of small, typically circular
concentra{ions of burned limestone rocks, generally no more
than a meter or two in diameter. Cultural material was rather
common around some hearths, especially if a burned rock
midden or accumulation was associated, while at others,
material was quite infrequent. At several sites, small numbers of
these burned rocks are distributed in such a way as to suggest
that they are scattered remnants of once intact hearths.
BURNED ROCK MIDDENS. These are generally circular,
mounded accumulations of burned limestone rocks, ranging in
diameter from 5 or 6 meters to as much as 10. Only the midden
at 41 TG 87 was observed as having a central depression; the
remainder do not exhibit such a characteristic, though it is
certainly possible that some may in fact possess one. This group
includes Type 1 and Type 2 burned rock middens as described
by Weir (1976: 34-40). When ground cover conditions were
favorable, an abundant and diverse assemblage of cultural
material was typically observed in, on, and surrounding these
features. However, at least one midden was almost devoid of
associated debris.
BURNED ROCK ACCUMULATIONS. This is somewhat of a
catchall group and includes those accumulations whose con-

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

274

ditions at the time of the survey prevented more specific descriptions, including unmounded surface concentrations of burned
rock, Weir’s Type 4 burned rock midden (1976: 40). Perhaps as a
function of the buried nature of some remains and/or heavy
ground cover, associated material was observed to vary considerably in both abundance and diversity.
BEDROCK MORTAR HOLES. These occur singly and in
groups of as many as six, but were not commonly observed in
the survey area. Diameter ranges from about 10 to 20 centimeters, and maximum depths were noted to as much as 20 or 30
centimeters.
PICTOGRAPHS. Red monochrome pictographs are present
on the cave walls at 41 TG 40. Most are linear designs and are
rather faded; however, the one handprint is in good condition.
MISCELLANEOUS. Centrally located on the flat top of a high
hill (41 TG 88), is a 30-40 centimeter high, 4 meter diameter pile
of small, unburned limestone boulders with a pit in the center;
its cultural affinity and function are unknown.

The Artifacts: Chipped Stone
In this group are all objects of chipped stone as well as the
byproduct material resulting from their manufacture; with the
exception of six quart items, all are of flint material. Unless
otherwise noted, the projectile point classification generally
follows that in the Handbook of Texas Archeology: Type Descriptions (Suhm and Jelks: 1962), as well as utilizing subsequent
individual type descriptions. The other artifacts are classified
into broad categories used by Sorrow et el. (1967) and Shafer
(1967, 1969, 1971). It should be emphasized that the following descriptions are based on collected artifacts as well as those
observed but not collected. Provenience of collected specimens is
presented in Tables V, VI, and VII.
Arrow Points
Washita (1 specimen, Fig. 5, d). The single specimen has shallow side notches
and concave base.
Perdiz (3 specimens, Fig. 5 a-c). Small specimens with contracting stems. Two
specimens are strongly barbed.
Unclassified I (1 specimen, Fig. 5, e). The single specimen is triangular with a
very slightly concave base. Blade edges are slightly recurred.
Unclassified II (1 specimen, Fig. 5, f). This unstemmed specimen has essen-

CONCHO RIVER ARCHEOLOGY

275

tially parallel edges for about two-thirds of the blade; the edges converge rather
abruptly on the distal one-third. Base concave.
Fragments (2 specimens). One bifacia!!y flaked distal fragment and one
strongly barbed point with the stem broken off.

Dart Points
Angostura (1 specimen, Fig. 5, g). One basal fragment with straight to slightly
concave edges; base also concave. Edges not ground.
Bulverde (17 specimens; Fig. 5, h-l). Two subgroups are recognized: I. (8
specimens, Fig. 5, h-j). Stem edges parallel; base straight. Shoulders squared,
blades triangular. II. (9 specimens, Fig. 5, k, 1). Similar to others except for slightly
concave base.
Castroville (7 specimens, Fig. 5, m-n). Triangular blade with strong to weak
barbs. Expanding stem, edges straight, base straight to slightly convex.
Conejo (Johnson 1964: 37; specimens, Fig. 6, a, b). All specimens fragmentary, but characterized by a short, broad, straight to slightly expanding stem with
a concave base. Shoulders prominent.
Ensor (3 specimens, Fig. 6, c, d). Basically triangular points with side notches,
bases straight or convex.
Fairland (2 specimens, Fig. 6, e, f}. These points have long shallow side
notches and strongly flaring stems with concave bases.
Frio (15 specimens, Fig. 6, g-j). Corner-notched stems, with notched base.
Have either prominent shoulders or strong barbs.
Martindale (2 specimens, Fig. 6, k, 1). These two specimens are distinguished
by an expanding stem with the double-convex "fishtail" base. One has strong
barbs; the other is too fragmentary to determine further characteristics.
Monte!! (4 specimens, Fig. 6, m, n). Characterized by an expanding stem with
a V-notched bifurcated base; complete specimens are barbed. One specimen has
been reworked, possibly into an awl (Fig. 6, m). Another is an unfinished specimen
{Fig. 6, n).
Nolan (4 specimens, Fig. 7, a-c). This group includes specimens with beveled
stem edges. One is beveled along both edges on one face (Fig. 7, c); the others are
bifacially beveled. One is made of quartz, the others of flint.
Pedernales (3 specimens, Fig. 7, d). All are fragmentary specimens having
straight stems with indented bases. Slightly barbed. The blades on two are rather
broad.
Plainview (1 specimen, Fig. 7, e). A single fragmentary specimen with a
concave base. At least one of the basal edges is ground. This artifact was an isolated find near 41 TG 86.
Val Verde (Ross 1965: 37; 2 specimens, Fig. 7, f, g). Both specimens have
slightly concave blade edges and prominent shoulders. Stem is expanding, base
slightly concave.
Williams (1 specimen, Fig. 7, h). The single specimen has prominent barbs
and an expanding, somewhat bulbous stem with a convex base.
Miscellaneous A (1 specimen, Fig. 7, i). This group of fragmentary dart points
is characterized by a contracting stem with bases straight or slightly convex.
Shoulders are weak to prominent. Similar to Langtry points.
Miscellaneous B (3 specimens, Fig. 7, j, k). These specimens have expanding

276

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

stems with slightly concave bases. Have prominent shoulders or may be barbed.
Miscellaneous C (3 specimens, Fig. 7, 1). This group has straight stems with
rounded bases; shoulders are prominent.
Miscellaneous D (2 specimens, Fig. 8, a). These fragmentary points have
expanding stems with slightly convex bases. On the more nearly complete
specimen, barbs appear to have been rather strong. Those are in many respects
similar to Marcos points, but are so fragmentary that they could not confidently
be so classified.
Miscellaneous E (2 specimens, Fig. 8, b). These very fragmentary specimens
have straight stems with very slightly concave bases. Barbed.
Miscellaneous F (2 specimens, Fig. 8, c). Short, broad points with very short
but wide stems. Stem edges parallel, base straight. Prominent shoulders.
Miscellaneous G (1 specimen, Fig. 8, d). The single specimen is basically
triangular with two basal notches which create strong barbs and a very short
rounded stem.
Miscellaneous H (1 specimen, Fig. 8, e). The single specimen is short with
prominent shoulders and an expanding stem with a straight base.
Miscellaneous I (1 specimen, Fig. 8, f). The single specimen has weak
shoulders with a contracting stem; the base is notched similar to a Montell point.
Miscellaneous I (1 specimen, Fig. 8, g). These long slender specimens have
almost non-existent shoulders and a weakly defined stem with a rounded base.
Miscellaneous K (1 specimen, 8, h). This specimen is basically lanceolate in
form with a deeply indented base. It is not fluted, though two narrow longitudinal
flakes have been removed to thin the base.
Dart point fragments. Fifty-five specimens are so fragmentary that they are
unidentifiable.
Remarks: Taking into consideration the typological limitations resulting from
the surface provenience, it appears that, on a qualitative basis only, the projectile
points suggest occasional occupation of the survey area from about 9000-10000
B.P. to historic times. This is suggested by the chronological positions of similar
types in both central Texas and the Lower Pecos region.

Bifaces
As distinguished from the projectile points, the artifacts in
this broad grouping are those bifacially chipped artifacts
without stems. Three categories are recognized:
Group I (16): These bifaces have been thinned presumably by soft hammer
retouch and, in the majority of cases, they exhibit pressure retouch along the
edges. Three subgroups are recognized.
IA (11 specimens, Fig. 9, a, b). These well-made specimens typically have
triangular shapes with straight to convex bases.
IB (4 specimens, Fig. 9, c). This group is distinguished by alternate beveling of
the edges, giving them a twisted appearance. Also known as 4-edged beveled
knives.
IC (1 specimen, Fig. 9, d). The single specimen is significantly smaller than
any other Group I bifaces and may be a finished or unfinished projectile point.
The base is rounded, edges convex.

Group I Fragments (48 specimens). These specimens are grouped together as
a result of their having the general Group I technological characteristics; that is,
they have been thinned by presumed soft hammer flaking and often exhibit
pressure retouch.
Group II (17 specimens, Fig. 9, f-h). These bifaces generally are more or less
triangular and are relatively thick; many show some flake scars presumably indicating soft hammer percussion. None exhibits pressure retouch.
Group III (42 specimens, Figs 9, e and 10, g, h). The specimens in this group
are rather heterogeneous in form and in extent of reduction, though all flaking is
restricted to hard hammer percussion. In addition, these bifaces, are, as a rule,
rather thick and have sinuous edges. Many of these appear to be failures in the
biface reduction process (Shafer and Baxter 1975: 50). One specimen (Fig. 9, e) is
of quartz.
Groups II-III Fragments (169 specimens). This group contains those fragments
possessing the flaking attributes and thickness characteristic of Groups II and III.

Unifaces
This broad category contains all those unifacially chipped
artifacts, with the exception of uniface retouch flakes which are
described in the section on burin spells.
End scrapers (Fig. I0, a-c). On these artifacts, the chipped edge is the dorsal
surface on the end of the flake opposite the bulb of percussion; this edge typically
is steeply beveled and convex. In cross-section, these are plano-convex. Cortex
may or may not be present on the dorsal surface.
Side scrapers (Fig. I0, d-f). Chipping on these specimens is on one or both
edges lateral to the axis of flake removal and is also on the dorsal flake surface.
The straight to convex edges generally are not steeply beveled. Cortex may or
may not be present.
Concave Edge Unifaces (Fig. 11, a, b). These specimens have one or more
concave edges formed by removal of a few flakes; the edges, furthermore, are
characteristically rather steep.
Miscellaneous Unifaces. These unifacially flaked artifacts do not fall within
the range of variation of any of the other groups. One specimen (Fig. 11, c) has a
serrated edge.

Utilized Flakes
Group I (33 specimens, Fig. 11, d, e). This group contains those flakes having
one or more edges very lightly pressure retouched, almost always unifacially.
Group II (34 specimens, Fig. II, f, g). These specimens exhibit nicking or
nibbling along one or more edges; none has retouched edges. Edge modification on
these artifacts appears to result from use only.

Drill
The single specimen (Fig. I0, i) has an unmodified flake base with a bifacially
flaked bit. It is possible that one of the Montell dart points (Fig. 6, m) is a drill
refashioned from a projectile point.

Burin-faceted Bifaces
This group of eight specimens (Fig. 11, n, o} contains biface fragments that
exhibit one or more burin facets.

Burin Spalls
Group I (3 specimens, Fig. 11, j, k}. These spa[Is originated from bifacially
flaked artifacts.
Group II (3 specimens, Fig. 11, h, i}. These spalls originated from unifacially
flaked artifacts.
Group III (25 specimens, Fig. 11, l, m}. These are spalls showing no evidence
of originating from previously retouched artifacts.

Hammerstone
A single specimen is here designated a hammerstone. It is a thick bifacially
flaked artifact, probably an exhausted core, which exhibits battering on the two
ends.

Ground Stone
Manos (2 specimens, Fig. 12, e). These two specimens are circular to oval
sandstone cobbles, shaped by pecking, with one well defined grinding facet.

Ceramics
The seven undecorated potsherds (Fig. 12, a-c) collected from 41 TG 38
represent all that are presently known from the research area. The paste of each
contains much crushed bone, some of which is burned. Exterior surfaces are all
buff colored and range from smoothed to rough; interior surfaces range from buff
to gray color and are all rough. The cores of some are gray. At least two vessels
are represented, both apparently built by the coil technique.

Bone Artifact
A single bone artifact fragment (Fig. 12, d) was recovered from 41 TG 40. It
is a greatly modified long bone fragment, flattened and highly polished. Overall
form could not be determined.

Lithic Manufacturing Debris
The categories used in this analysis are essentially those of
Shafer (1969: 3-5}. Within the following seven categories are
materials representing the waste debris from lithic reduction as
well as natural, unmodified flint.
Cores (175 specimens}. These are nodules or cobbles of ledge flint from which
flakes have been removed, presumably with the intent of using these flakes as

tools, either unmodified or modified. No effort has been made to separate further
the cores into subgroups.
Hard Hammer Flakes. These flakes typically possess a rather prominent bulb
of percussion and are relatively thick, particularly at the bulbar end. The striking
platform usually is large and fiat, and may or may not be faceted. Three subgroups are recognized:

1. (57 specimens). Initial cortex flakes are those whose dorsal surface is
covered by cortex.
2. (365 specimens). Secondary cortex flakes are those with some cortex on
the dorsal surface.
3. (538 specimens). Interior flakes are those with no cortex on the dorsal
surface, though they as well as initial secondary cortex flakes may have cortex on
the striking platforms. All ledge flint hard hammer flakes are in this group.
Soft Hammer Flakes (441 specimens). In this category are those flakes usually
possessing a diffuse bulb of percussion and a lip on the ventral surface at a right
angle to the axis of flake removal. Striking platforms are usually faceted and are
bifacially prepared, though in some cases, the platform appears almost
nonexistent. Generally, these flakes are thin and may be arched.
Miscellaneous Flakes (239 specimens). These could not confidently be
categorized as either hard hammer or soft hammer flakes.
Chips (2655 specimens). These are fragments possessing neither a striking
platform nor a bulb of percussion.
Naturally Fractured Specimens (850 specimens). These specimens show no
evidence of having been produced by human flaking activity, presumably having
been created by natural processes such as frost action. At some sites, this group
constitutes the greatest amount of observed and collected material.

Faunal Remains
Table III presents the taxa and minimum number of individuals of each for the faunal remains from 41 TG 40. All are
well preserved as a result of having been in the dry cave
deposits.

quantitative differences between assemblages from kinds of sites
perceived to be "different," controlled surface collections were
made at five selected loctions at three sites: 41 TG 38, 41 TG 46,
and 41 TG 86. These collections were made only when additional
personnel and equipment were available, and as a result, they
vary considerably in extent of coverage. Unfortunately, these
limited collections have not sampled all of the combinations of

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

288

site types and microenvironments; in fact, only three are
represented. Ideally, at least one each of the possible combinations should have been sampled.

41 TG 46
Site 41 TG 46 was the first site where controlled surface
collections were made. Two separate areas within the upland site,
designated A and B, were selected for the collections. Area A
includes a small burned rock midden and adjacent area, for a total
of 700 square meters; recovery was from 28 contiguous 5 by 5
meter squares. Area B consists of 16 contiguous 5 by 5 meter
squares (400 square meters) adjacent to but not including a small
burned rock accumulation. Together, these collections represent
approximately 0.7°/~ of the estimated 15 hectare site area. In both
these areas, ground vegetation was quite sparse and thus, visibility

was not impaired. For these and the other three subsequent
collections, an effort was made to pick up even the smallest objects, many of which are less than i centimeter in maximum
dimensions.

41 TG 86
Like 41 TG 46, site 41 TG 86 is an upland site located in an
area of natural flint sources. Here, too, separate, but in this case
rather small controlled collections were made at two locations in
an effort to recover a useful sample of both modified and unmodified lithic material. Both collections concentrated on the outcropping of flint in places where plant cover was minimal, and
thus, these restrictions in addition to those of time and personnel
resulted in the small area coverage. Unlike the procedure at 41
TG 46, collection at 41 TG 86 was made in 1 by 1 meter grid
squares because it was felt that use of 5 by 5 meter squares
might impair the possibility of detecting horizontal clusters of
cultural materials. The first collection was the smaller of the
two, comprising 7 square meters, the second, 16 square meters.
Although these represent considerably less than a 1% sample, it
is felt that they generally reflect the nature of the site’s remains.
41 TG 38
The collection at 41 TG 38, a riparian zone site, also was
small, totaling 52 contiguous 1 by 1 meter squares which encompassed part of a burned rock accumulation and adjacent
area. With the total site area conservatively estimated at 3
hectares, this collection constitutes less than a 1% sample.
Table VI presents the occurrence and density, expressed as
number per square meter, of material from the 5 controlled
collections, as well as occurrence only for the uncontrolled
collections from 41 TG 40 and 41 TG 41. In terms of presence/absence and density of the artifact categories previously
described, several differences among the sites are noted.
Initially, both collections from 41 TG 86 stand out in their
general lack of artifacts, though Area A did contain a few
unifacially modified tools. However, as can be seen in Table IV,
thick bifaces are present in other areas of the site. Significant
also are the relatively high numbers and/or densities of cores,
hard hammer flakes, and unmodified flint, in contrast to the complete absence of soft hammer flakes (see Table VI).

Strictly in terms of presence/absence of artifact categories
and features, the other four sites generally appear quite similar,
but when frequencies are compared, differences are readily
apparent. These differences, though, may be more a function of
sampling biases than of real variation. For example, in Table VI,
the densities for collections 41 TG 38, 41 TG 46A, and 41 TG 46B
indicate that most categories of cultural debris were relatively
more common in 41 TG 38. If, however, sample sizes are made
more nearly equal by determining densities for various sets of 2
continguous 5 by 5 meter squares in both Areas of 41 TG 46,
then these differences disappear or, in some cases, are amplified. Even when comparisons were made between sets of
squares which included or were near the burned rock midden in
Area A and the accumulation in Area B, differences between
these collections and that from 41 TG 38 were not consistently
demonstrable. Thus, for these total samples, density, when
expressed as the number per square meter, is not necessarily a
reliable measure of differences between sites. It appears then,
that, given the data base, the most valid way to compare the
archeological remains from various sites is presence/absence.

Because of the lack of chronological indicators from 81% (39)
of the sites and the fact that all but one of the collections are
surface samples, the possibility of temporal differences overall
cannot be considered with any degree of confidence.

DESCRIPTIVE SITE TYPES
From the data summarized in Tables II, IV-Vl, six descriptive
site types have been recognized: burned rock accumulation and/or

midden, lithic scatter with burned, rock, lithic scatter, lithic
resource site, lithic resource site with burned rock accumulation
and/or midden, and rockshelter. These are discussed below.
Burned Rock Accumulation and/or Midden (15 sites). These sites are distinguished primarily by one or more sizeable accumulations of burned limestone rock
with surrounding cultural debris. Because conditions of site assessment often
limited the determination of morphological type, all of the middens and other accumulations are here grouped together. Characteristically, but not always, assemblages are quite diverse and include, in the better known cases, projectile points,
projectile point bases, thin bifaces (Group I), end scrapers, a variety of other
unifacial artifacts, grinding implements or features, burin spells (including uniface
retouch flakes), cores, soft hammer flakes, hard hammer flakes, and chips. Mussel
shell was observed in low frequency at nearly every one of these sites, bone at far
fewer.
Lithic Scatter with Burned Rock (11 sites). These sites generally are poorly
known, with no systematically recovered artifacts from any. For all but one site,
data are’restricted to observation, the exception being 41 TG 39 where collections
made years before the survey emphasized projectile points and bifaces. As implied in the name, these sites all contained small amounts of burned limestone,
either in recognizable hearths or merely scattered about. Though the most consistently observed artifacts were thin bifaces (Group I), side scrapers, cores and
chipping debris, these and other cultural materials were generally observed in the
field to be considerably less frequent at these sites than at Burned Rock Accumulation and/or Midden sites. Perhaps as a result of having been more extensively
investigated, site 41 TG 39 stands out in containing a rather diverse assemblage,
quite similar to those of Burned Rock Accumulation and/or Midden sites. Also
somewhat aberrant is site 41 TG 88, which has the circular feature of unburned
limestone boulders and in which no unifacial artifacts were noted.
Lithic Scatter (7 sites). Like Lithic Scatters with Burned Rock, these sites are
incompletely known, none having been systematically sampled. They are distinguished from the other site types by having: (1) no recognizable burned rock; (2) no
natural sources of flint; (3] infrequently occurring material; and (4) little diversity
in assemblages. While chipping debris was observed at all Lithic Scatters,
unifacial artifacts of one kind or another were noted at five, bifaces at two. More
specifically, these sites, unlike Lithic Scatters with Burned Rock, generally were
not observed to contain thin bifaces (Group I).
Lithic Procurement Site (12 sites]. Based on data from both observation and
controlled collections, these sites are characterized by the presence of naturally
occurring flint and relatively large numbers of cores and hard hammer flakes.
Primary chipping debris was noted at every site, thick bifaces (Groups II and III)
and unifaces at most. In contrast, there was an observed complete absence of soft
hammer flakes and scarcity of thin bifaces (Group I). Overall, the most commonly
occurring artifacts show little diversity and typically seem related to procurement

294

of lithic raw material and to primary reduction to thick bifaces and perhaps
occasionally to various types of unifaces and thin bifaces.
Lithic Procurement -- Burned Rock Accumulation and/or Midden (2 sites).
Although these sites have the same basic characteristics as Lithic Procurement
sites, they contain much more diverse assemblages as well as burned rock accumulations and middens. As previously described, large controlled collections were
made at 41 TG 46, and include projectile points, Group I, II, and III bifaces, all
types of unifaces, utilized flakes, and all types of chipping debris. Mortar holes
and mussel shells were also present.
Rockshelter (2 sites). Both of these sites are small; the larger, 41 TG 40,
having an area of approximately 20 square meters. 41 TG 63 is apparently undisturbed and thus essentially unknown. The assemblage recovered by excavation
at 41 TG 40 is quite diverse and includes projectile points, Group I, II, and III
bifaces, all types of unifaces, utilized flakes, chipping debris, a bone artifact, and
faunal remains. Acorns. pecans, and prickly pear fruits also occurred in the dry
deposits associated with the cultural material.

INTERPRETATIONS
One of the basic assumptions on which this study is based is
that hunter-gatherer populations articulate with their environment through patterned relationships and that these relationships can be studied and analyzed. More particularly, since
similar subsistence activities can be expected in like environmental situations, one may predict a correlation between the
patterned distribution of specific resources and the patterned
distribution of specific archeological remains. It appears reasonable, therefore, to infer that important clues to site function may
be found in the environmental context in which a specific site
occurs. If proximity to economic resources is a primary goal
operating in settlement placement, then investigation of resource
potential should provide evidence complementing that from
within a site. From these two sets of data, it should be possible
to determine what attracted people to a particular place and
possibly even during which season(s) of the year. The archeological remains should reveal which activities, in terms of
resource procurement, processing, and consumption, took place in
or near the site, and perhaps how extensive these activities were.
From the research reported here, there is a body of data on
the distribution of archeological remains and a body of data on
the distribution of certain naturally occurring resources which
must be analyzed for patterned correlations. From the data
presented in Fig. 4, Table VIII was drawn up to present the

It is important to note again that temporal control is, for all
practical purposes, non-existent, and that as a result, the following
analysis does not consider possible long-term change in resource
use patterns.
Site Types

Looking first at the Burned Rock Accumulation and/or Midden
sites, we see that they occur exclusively in the Riparian microenvironment. Lithic Scatters with Burned Rock .mostly occur within the
Riparian or in zones transitional between it and the other two
microenvironments (73°/’o or 8 of 11), though they also occur in the

CONCHO RIVER ARCHEOLOGY

299

Flatlands (9% or 1 of 11) and the Uplands (18% or 2 of 11).
Similarly, Lithic Scatters are found in all three of the microenvironments, not showing a restricted patterned distribution. The distribution of Lithic Procurement sites, on the other hand,
corresponds not to microenvironments, but to the occurrence of the
raw material sources; most are, however, in the Uplands along the
extensive flint outcrops. In two instances where these sources are
extensive and are in upland areas immediately adjacent to the
Riparian zone, combination Lithic Procurement -- Burned Rock Accumulation and/or Midden sites occur. Finally, the two Rockshelters are located in the limestone bluffs of the Riparian-Upland
transition.
On closer examination of the data, it is apparent that the
distribution of burned rock accumulations and middens covaries
with the Riparian microenvironment or immediately adjacent
areas. More specifically, however, these features are at the
present time always in close association with stands of oak
and/or pecan trees, and also with water sources of presently
varying permanence. Although definitive paleoenvironmental
data are lacking, the reconstructions mentioned earlier suggest
that this relationship is more than a recent fortuitous development. As has been proposed by Weir (1976: 125}, I submit that
these burned rock features are associated with the exploitation
of mast crops, and that this association is supported by the data
from this study.
According to Jochim [1976}, proximity of economic resources
is a primary goal in hunter-gatherer settlement placement, settlements usually being located nearer the denser and less mobile of
these resources. This results from the desire to attain a secure
level of food and manufacturing needs by means of energy expenditure within a predefined range. The acorn and pecan
resources certainly are among the densest and least mobile of
those observed in the research area, and it is with them that the
burned rock accumulations and middens are inferred to be associated. Furthermore, procurement and processing of these
particular resources would require relatively little effort if the
activities required were carried out near the sources. Thus, I
argue that these features are connected with the exploitation of
acorns and/or pecans, probably with processing.
Energy expenditure in this exploitation could be minimized
by living near the resources, but this is probable only if other

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

300

needed or desired resources, wherever located, are also exploitable by means of a predefined amount of effort. Water and
fuel, as well as a variety of other food and nonfood resources,
are available in the Riparian or in neighboring microenvironments. Therefore, if acorns and/or pecans were primary
resources, groups exploiting them could remain in the area of
their occurrence for periods corresponding to natural availability and storability (as determined by size of surplus, if any).
One could expect, then, that a buildup of archeological remains
would result from extensive occupation of a particular locus
and, moreover, that this assemblage of remains is likely to be a
diverse one reflecting a variety of activities.
If for some reason
nature, material might
perhaps somewhat less
Burned Rock in or near

occupation was of a more temporary
be expected to be less frequent and
diverse. Thus, the Lithic Scatters with
the Riparian microenvironment possibly

reflect less intensive exploitation of these acorn and/or pecan
resources or perhaps others of differing availability.
Regarding the Lithic Procurement Sites, these occur only
where the raw material is available, with most of these sites
conforming to outcrop areas in the Uplands. As implied in the
name, the primary activitiy presumably was procurement of flint
raw material and preliminary reduction to desired forms. At
some of these sites the presence of unifaces and thin bifaces
may indicate tool finishing, though debitage presumed to reflect
finishing (small hard hammer flakes and soft hammer flakes) was
not recovered or observed. In short, then, these are activityspecific sites with no evidence of anything other than brief,
intermittent visits.
At the present time, I see no pattern in the locations of
Lithic Scatters; but since these are some of the least known
sites, it may well be that they have not been appropriately
grouped. In any event, the range of archeological remains at
these sites suggests that only a relatively few, presently undetermined, activities took place.
Study Area
According to Fitzhugh (1972: 138):
Cultural adaptations are generally greared to exploit the microenvironment including its varied resources, rather than individual

CONCHO RIVER ARCHEOLOGY

301

resource areas since in the microenvironment there are several
resources available.

With this concept as a basis, I offer the following interpretations of
the archeological data from the research area, presented in terms
of procurement, processing, and consumption of resources.
The most extensive occupation of the research area as
determinable from the archeological data is suggested to have
coincided with the seasonal (fall) availability of the acorn and
pecan crops, while other occupation, if any, was limited by the
comparative lack of abundant, easily procurable subsistence
resources.
As revealed in Table I, various economically important
resources are differentially available in the three microenvironments. Assuming that these resources are unequally valued and
that priority is normally given to resources required to sustain
life (water and food), we recall that the more secure a resource
in terms of its density and mobility, the greater is its attraction
for settlement. In general, then, the Riparian microenvironment
is the only one where such a resource situation occurs; and thus,
I suggest that at least during the fall, hunter-gatherer groups
occupied this zone primarily to procure, process, and consume
the acorn and pecan crops. I also propose that the duration of
this occupation could have been extended for two, three, or
perhaps several months since these foods can be stored for long
periods of time. Extensive processing of these and probably other
foods likely resulted in the formation of burned rock middens
and accumulations.
While gathering of acorns and pecans is presumed to have
been a major food procurement activity in Zone I, the presence
of mussel shell at most sites containing burned rock features,
and the presence of bone and projectile points in the better
known sites reveals that hunting and gathering of animal foods
also contributed to the diet. The presence of bison bone at 41 TG
41 and the array of faunal remains from 41 TG 40 clearly indicate that hunters based in the Riparian microenvironment
exploited animals populations within this zone and outside of it.
The large proportion of soft hammer flakes suggests that the
tools used in processing plant and animal foods as well as other
resources were generally manufactured at occupation sites in or

302

near the Riparian microenvironment from material obtained at
various Lithic Procurement sites. Short procurement trips probably were made from these occupation sites.
As noted above, I propose that occupation was in general
restricted to the Riparian microenvironment where the most
important and secure food sources, as well as water, fuel, and
protection from the elements were all available. In terms of
resource use, activities in Zone I included processing and
consumption of plant and animal foods that were procured in all
three microenvironments, and manufacture of needed or desired
lithic and non-lithic implements. Evidence for this variety of
activities, can be found in the specific types of remains and their
overall diversity.
The nature of the available resources and the relative
scarcity of archeological remains in the Flatlands microenvironment (4 of 49 sites) suggest that activity here was generally
restricted to procurement primarily of animal resources and
secondarily of flint and perhaps plant resources. This is confirmed somewhat by the presence of Flatland faunal remains,
particularly the priarie dog, in presumed Riparian occupation
sites.
Resource exploitation in the Uplands is most evident in the
procurement and preliminary processing of flint raw material.
Significant, though, are the localized present associations of extensive stands of oaks and burned rock middens and accumulations adjacent to the Riparian microenvironment. In these areas,
the archeological remains imply the occurrence of the same
array of exploitation activities that took place in similar
Riparian occupation sites.
The number and distribution of occupation sites in or adjacent to the Riparian microenvironment suggest that the exploitation model proposed by Prewitt (1976: 73-74) for the central
San Gabriel River valley applies quite well to the South Concho
research area in Tom Green County. Specifically, Prewitt
predicts (1) that temporary depletion of resources at one site to a
point where further energy expenditure would exceed
predefined limits prompted movement to another site, and (2)
that this has over long periods of time resulted in numerous sites
reflecting repeated use. This, I suggest, is one explanation for
the pattern observable in the study area.
Thus, we have occupation sites, where processing and

CONCHO RIVER ARCHEOLOGY

303

consumption of food and non-food resources took place, present
in or very near the zone (the Riparian microenvironment) where
the most important of these resources naturally occur in great
abundance. Exploitation of those not so important resources
which occur outside this area would have required brief procurement trips from the occupation sites.

CONCLUSIONS
Two general conclusions are derived from this study. First, I
believe that in spite of the data limitations, this study has
demonstrated the interpretive potential of correlating types of
archeological remains with the distribution of certain economically important resources. Thus, this procedure brings to bear
another line of evidence in hunter-gatherer subsistence-settlement studies. Depending on the quantity and quality of the data,
however, its results probably will vary from convincing explanation of patterns to mere speculation.
This variable relationship between the primary data and
interpretations brings me to the second general conclusion. I
believe that the data reported here simply are not sufficient for
convincingly demonstrating the proposed patterns of resource
use. Moreover, the temporal data probably present in the
research area have not been adquately sampled, nor for that
matter have subsistence remains. Nonetheless, this study has
provided a very useful base for subsequent work both in the
research area and in other regions, and has done so in such a
way that the bulk of the primary data retains its context for
future analysis.

Use of Phosphate Analysis
for
Determining Land Use Patterns*
DONALD R. LEWIS

ABSTRACT
Recent research by R. C. Eidt has indicated that both spot tests
and fractionation analysis for phosphate can be useful in identifying
areas of land use by man and the probable nature of the land use.
Phosphorus in the soil is primarily orthophosphate whether it results
from animal or vegetable tissue or bone, teeth, animal waste or
mineral sources. The relative ease of extractibility of phosphate can
be used to determine the probable types of sources and thus provide
information on land use. Additional research in this field can be
expected to enhance the value of this information for the archaeologist and to more clearly define thee limits of applicability.

INTRODUCTION
Recently R. C. Eidt (1977) has published results of phosphate analyses
which show consistent patterns in the kinds and amounts of phosphates in
the soil corresponding to past or recent uses made of the soil by man. This
paper discusses the basis for these results and the factors which may
influence the validity of the interpretations.
Soil chemists and geochemists have known for many years that phosphorus in the most common form as phosphate does not leach out or move
about in the soil (Arrhenius 1931; Smith, Posner and Quirk 1977). They
also learned that there was no simple relation between the total amount of
phosphorus in the soi! as determined by chemical analysis and the ability
of particular plants to obtain the phosphorus needed for growth from that

Texas Archaeological Association in San Antonio.

soil (Sauchelli 1965). The approach which was taken was to determine the
amounts of phosphate which could be extracted from the soil using a
series of conditions ranging from the mildest in which the soil is leached
with water at a controlled pH, through the most severe in which the soil
minerals are destroyed by acid (Eidt 1977; Khin and Leeper 1960}. These
various classes of soil extracts, when analyzed for phosphates, give a
much more useful index of the phosphorus available for plant growth -although the problem is not yet completely solved because of the enormous
variations in the abilities of different plant species to extract phosphorus
from the soil.
From an examination of the factors which affect the amounts of phosphate in the various classes of availability it became evident that the use
which man had made of the soil was an important factor. Mans’ activities
may increase the phosphate content of the soil in areas where his occupation caused the accumulation of organic wastes as in a midden. Cultivation of plants may produce a strong reduction in the phosphate concentration in comparison with the uncultivated areas. Man may increase the
phosphate content by deliberate fertilizing of the soil for planting. He may
decrease it by mechanically removing the surface layer for construction
materials. Combinations of these processes and similar activities of man
generate phosphate extractability distributions which are characteristic
of the land use.
The bones, tissues, and wastes from undomesticated animals will
also contribute to the phosphate distribution in the soil. However, the
concentrations, patterns and the magnitude of the effects usually will
make it possible to recognize the influence of man.

BASIC PHOSPHATE CHEMISTRY
The element phosphorus never occurs free in nature. Most of the
phosphorus in the crust of the earth occurs as a member of the apatite
mineral group (McKelvey 1973). Apatite is calcium phosphate, but
commonly includes fuoride, chloride, or hydroxide as in the very
abundant mineral fluorapatite. In sediments the combination mineral
carbonate-fluorapatite, known as francolite, is common. The two
chemical factors which make phosphate determination useful to archaeology are its universality in living matter and its usually rapid
conversion to an immobilized form when it reaches the soil. The mineral
content of bones and teeth and other hard tissues of warm blooded
animals is primarily fluorapatite or hydroxyapatite. In all of these
minerals phosphorus occurs chemically in the orthophosphate radical.
Organic phosphates from soft tissue of animals or plants usually are
converted to orthophosphates in the soil very rapidly (Emsley and Hall
1976; Pierrou 1976).

PHOSPHATE ANALYSIS

311

In alkaline or calcareous softs (high pH} clacium phosphates are
rapidly formed when phosphates are added from any source. These
compounds are very insoluble and prevent the phosphate from
migrating. In acid soils (low pH} the phosphates are captured by ferric
iron or by aluminum to form very insoluble compounds which again tie
down the phosphate and prevent it from migrating.
In swamps and areas subjected to prolonged flooding the chemical
environment is reducing, the ferric iron is changed to ferrous iron and
the phosphate moves from the solid soil material into the water and can
be transported from its original location {Patrick and Khalid 1974).

TESTS FOR PHOSPHATE
The Spot Test
By far the most convenient test for phosphate is a simple spot test
(Eidt 1973; Woods 1975). This test is ordinarily carried out by placing a
small sample (approximately 50 milligrams) of soil on a piece of filter
paper (phosphate-free). The phosphate is extracted from the soil by
using hydrochloric acid and the reaction with ammonium molybdate in
the extracting solution forms phosphomolybdic acid. This compound is
then reduced by using ascorbic acid and forms "heteropoly blue", a
deep blue color whose presence probably indicates the presence of
phosphate, and whose intensity depends on the amount of phosphate
present (Boltz and Mellon 1947). The details of a typical procedure (Eidt
1973; Woods 1975) are shown in Table 1.
The spot test for phosphate has strong recommendations based on
its simplicity and the fact that it can be done in the field. This convenience is offset by a numl~er of serious limitations. These factors are
summarized in Table 2. Despite these limitations the spot test is a very
convenient and useful method for surveying an area for horizontal and
vertical patterns in phosphate. These surveys can provide the basis for
selecting samples for a more quantitative examination.

The Fractionation Procedure
The most successful procedure for extracting the soil phosphate
into fractions which can reflect land use of anthrosols has been
published by Eidt (1977}. The basic sequence of this procedure is
outlined in Table 3. In essence the process consists of starting with an
accurately known amount of soil which is subjected to a sequence of
extractions ranging from a gentle wash to a hot strong acid treatment
which will liberate any phosphate in the soil sample. These extracts are
classified in three categories depending on the ease of extracting the

phosphate from the soil. The most easily removed is labile phosphate,
the intermediate is called bound phosphate, and the strong acid extract
is classified as mineral phosphate.
Both the total amount of phosphate and the distribution among
these three groups are diagnostic of man’s use of the soil. A summary of
this type of information as reported by Eidt {1977) is given in Table 4.
This information potentially provides a powerful tool for archaeologists.
Among the areas of direct applicability are the following:
1. Determination of the nature of land use.
2. Estimation of population density.
3. Determination of changes of land use with time.
4. Determination of occupational chronology.
There is, of course, a price to be paid for the rich increase in the
detailed information content of the data. That price is the increased
complexity and demands of the procedures for obtaining the data. The
general characteristics of the phosphate fractionation analysis are
summarized in Table 5. Many of the characteristics of this analysis are

the opposite of those of the simple spot test. Fractionation analysis is
slow, tedious and demands considerable operator skill and training to
yield consistent, reliable results. Moreover, special equipment is
required to prepare the soil, separate the fractions and make quantitative determination of the phosphate content of each fraction. A
tabulation of commercial equipment which would be reasonably
adequate to perform these determinations is given in Table 6. The
prices shown are taken from the 1977 edition of the Fisher Scientific
Company general laboratory catalog.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Recognition of the factors which lead to immobilizing phosphates in
the soil has provided an incisive tool for studying the temporal and
spacial impact of man on his environment, and some additional details
of the nature of his utilization of his resources. Implicit in these data
are both climatological and cultural information. Moreover, it is important to recognize that the power of this approach is just beginning to
be realized. Improvements in fractionation procedures and analytical
techniques can also be expected to broaden the usefulness of the
method.
Phosphate tests of anthrosols can provide information about man’s
occupation and usage of the soil. Although highly qualitative and
subjective, the spot tests for phosphate in the field provide a useful,

rapid and convenient means for identifying areas which may indicate
man’s influence on the environment. More detailed and quantitative
studies which require careful separation of phosphates into operational
fractions labile, bound, or mineral provide unique information on
whether or not the phosphate distribution is the result of man’s activities. Moreover, the nature of man’s activities throughout the time
and area associated with the soil phosphate patterns can be generally
identified. Additional work to extend the technique offers the potential
of providing much detailed information about the environment in which
man lived and the manner in which he influenced his surroundings.

A Lithic Tool Cache in
the Texas Panhandle
LEONARD M.

SLESICK

ABSTRACT
This paper reports the finding of an undisturbed cache of lithic
tools and flakes at a site on Pedrosa Creek in Potter County, Texas.
The cache contained a total of 51 chipped stone items representing a
variety of tools made of several different kinds of lithic material. The
cache may date to the time of the Antelope Creek Focus, and gives
significant information as to the implements and materials in the
possession of one individual.

INTRODUCTION
The cache was found at a site recorded as A-1107 in the files of the
Panhandle Plains Historical Museum and West Texas State University at
Canyon, Texas. The site is on the Frying Pan Ranch of the Bush Estate in
Western Potter County. It is situated on Pedrosa Creek, which runs northward into Tecovas Creek, which in turn runs northeastward into the
Canadian River.
Site A-1107 lies at the base of a sharp east-west escarpment of the
Ogallala formation which forms the northern edge of the Llano Estacado
and the southern edge of the Canadian River breaks. Springs in the
general area form near the base of the escarpment. The top of the caprock
is approximately 1,160 meters AMSL with the springs forming about 1,100
to 1,130 meters AMSL. Signs of occupation are found on both sides of
Pedrosa Creek near a spring which is active today. These indications
extend 1,000 meters downstream {north} and 500 meters east to west from
the spring. Although very little of the site is found upstream (south} from
the spring, the cache was located upstream.

DESCRIPTION OF THE SITE
The site contains numerous darkened midden areas with burnt rock
and broken burned rocks. Flint, other lithic debris, and bone are
widespread in washes. One potsherd of Borger Cordmarked (Suhm and

]elks 1962) was found in a midden, indicating connections with the Antelope Creek Focus. Obsidian flakes have been found on the site; the
nearest probable sources of this material are to the west in New Mexico.
Three mortar holes are located on the highest knoll forming the west bank
of Pedrosa Creek, and two others are found east of the creek about 30
meters from the present channel. Small corner-notched, side-notched, and
triangular arrow points have been found on the site, with the greatest
concentration near the mortar holes to the west. A fall with a large pool
forms on the creek near this spot. Archaic dart points have been reported
from this site, and a Paleo-lndian (Agate Basin) point has been found in the
creekbed not far away.

INVESTIGATION OF THE CACHE
Large flint flakes and some bone fragments were found on the surface
10-15 meters south of the cache. The lithic cache was discovered when a
portion of a large thick biface (Artifact #I) was exposed by erosion. After
the biface was uncovered with a trowel, and two additional pieces were
removed, it was surmised that the find was a cache. The remaining pieces
were removed in layers. The first two layers were neatly arranged, but the
third was more random with overlapping (Fig. 1), the fourth layer may
have been more than a single tier, with considerable overlapping of the
pieces. Layers.5 and 6 were mainly utilized flakes, with the position of
pieces very random and the order of removal uncertain. The pieces were
laid horizontally throughout, with the well worked tools near the top. The
area of the cache was approximately the size of the biface and the depth
was about I0 cm (Fig. 2). Two small bone fragments were in the cache but
were so badly deteriorated that they could not be identified. No points
were found in the cache. After all the pieces were removed, the soil was
screened for approximately one meter around the cache area, and Artifact #14 was found in the loose soil taken from the cache. The soil in the
cache was indistinguishable from the surrounding sterile soil. Darkened
soil about 30 cm to the north of the cache was also screened but was
sterile.

DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTIFACTS
The 51 lithic artifacts found in the cache are described individually
in Table i and pictured in Figs. 3-6. Table 1 indicates the type, size, and
material of each specimen and includes remarks on some of the items.
When noted, right and left edges are as seen when looking at the flake
with the proximal end at the bottom.
Of the 51 pieces in the cache, 21 are classifiable as well-worked
tools, 5 as retouched flakes, 22 as utilized flakes, and 3 as unmodified
flakes. The 21 specimens regarded as well worked tools include I large
thick biface (#I), 1 beveled knife (#5), 1 drill (#6), 2 scrapers (#2 and 7),

2 side scrapers (#8 and 9), 6 end scrapers (#3,4,11,14,16, and 17), and 8
knives (#10,12,13,15,18-20, and 43). Artifact numbers correlate with
specimens as illustrated in Figs. 3-6. The knives are unusual being
extremely straight along one edge with little or no work on remaining
edges. These are made on very thin flakes. The five pieces listed as
retouched flakes (#22,24,26,32, and 36) show some minor flaking. The 22
items shown as utilized flakes (#21,27,31,33,35,37-42, and 44-51) show
some signs of wear damage from use, but no work beyond striking from
the core. Many of these still retain the striking platform. The remaining
3 pieces (#23,25, and 34) show no sign of either work or use.
Certain of the pieces are remarkably similar. These include 2
scrapers (#2 and 7), which are large, thin triangle unifaces; the 2 side
scrapers (#8 and 9), which are small flakes with one well-worked edge;
2 of the end scrapers (#3 and 4) which are large unifaces; 2 of the end
scrapers (#11 and 14) which are small square unifaces; 2 of the end
scrapers (#16 and 17) which are small rectangular unifaces; 3 of the
knives (#10,12, and 13) which are thin flakes with one edge well-worked
in a very straight line, and with squared corners; 2 of the knives (#15
and 19) which are thin flakes with one well-worked edge and a rounded
corner; and 2 of the knives (#20 and 43) which are small square
unifaces with fine work on one edge.
With regard to material, the vast majority (43) of the pieces are
Alibates agate, 3 are Tecovas jasper (#4,5, and 25), 2 are Edwards flint
(#9 and 14), 1 is Potter chert (#8), 1 is Dakota quartzite (#20), and 1 is
Tecovas quartzite (#3). Fourteen pieces of the Alibates agate are very
distinctive (#10,19,21,22,26,27,29,30,36,38,41,46,48, and 50) and more
than likely came from the same core. Pieces 21 and 50 can be fitted
together as struck from this core. The 3 pieces of Tecovas jasper are
similar enough to be from a single core. It is also noteworthy that the
specimens of material other than Alibates agate are all classifiable as
well-worked tools, except for the one piece of Tecovas jasper (#25).
Also, on the five retouched flakes, all work is on the right edge of the
inner face, or the left edge of the outer face.
The Alibates agate which makes up the bulk of the material in the
cache is a local material quarried approximately 65 kilometers to the
northeast on the Canadian River near Fritch, Texas (Southwest Regional
Office, National Park Service 1975). The nearest known source of the
Tecovas materials is an outcrop on Sierrita de la Cruz Creek a few
miles to the north, but the material also occurs in the Canadian River
breaks north of Amarillo, and along the eastern caprock escarpment
from the Palo Duro Canyon southward. Edwards flint occurs along the
southern part of the escarpment and southward into the Edwards
Plateau. Potter chert comes from Pliocene and Pleistocene gravel
deposits at many places in the Texas Panhandle. Dakota quartzite

outcrops along the southern rim of the Canadian River breaks to the
west in New Mexico.

CONCLUSIONS
The lithic cache was found in a buried, neatly stacked, undisturbed
condition. The cache should therefore show the variety of materials and
the range of tools in the possession of a single person at a particular
time. Although consisting largely of flakes with only slight modification
by or for the use in cutting or scraping processes, the cache also includes an interesting variety of more extensively shaped unifaces and
bifaces for chopping, cutting, scraping, and perforating. And despite the
owner’s obvious preference for Alibates agate, an interesting range of
other materials, both local and remote, is present. Work on the finished
tools in general is excellent quality; most of the remainder of the flakes
show some signs of use or minor trimming for sharpening an edge.
Dating of the cache is difficult without point types as reference.
The wide variety of points found on the site (from Paleo-Indian through
Archaic to Neo-American) is of no assistance. However, the beveled
knife (Artifact #5) is characteristic of artifacts found in assemblages
attributable to the Antelope Creek Focus (Hughes 1962} along the
Canadian River in this part of the Texas Panhandle. Approximate
dating of this cultural unit is 1200-1450 A.D. If the beveled knife can be
used as an indicator, the cache would be about 500 to 700 years old.

the preparation of this paper.

The Re-examination of Pedro De Castaneda’s
Bone Bed by Geological Investigations
EDWIN L. KISER
ABSTRACT
This paper describes the bone bed mentioned by Pedro de
Castaneda in 1541 and compares it to the Silver Lake Bison Site in
Hockley County, Texas.
The Silver Lake site is described in some detail. Concluding the
paper is a brief examination of different historians’ proposed routes
which Coronado’s army traveled on their return from Quivira.

The journey of the Coronado expedition across the American
Southwest has always been an intriguing study for the student of
American history or anthropology. Scholars have toiled many years trying
to define precise routes which the Conquistadors traveled to and from
Quivira. Regardless of historians’ quibbling, Coronado and his army were
the first to record descriptions of the Llano Estacado, or Staked Plains.
Among their descriptions was the first palaeontological site report,
and perhaps also first anthropological site report recorded in the
American Southwest. This description was given by Pedro de Castaneda in
1541 after the Army had split from Coronado on their return trip from
Quivira. Castaneda’s description follows:
Another thing was a heap of cowbones, a crossbow shot long, or a very
little less, almost twice a man’s height in places, and some 18 feet or
more wide, which was found on the edge of a salt lake in the southern
part, and this in a region where there are no people who could have
made it. The only explanation of this which could be suggested was that
the waves which the north winds must make in the lake had piled up the
bones of the cattle which had died in the lake, when the old and weak
ones, who went into the water were unable to get out. The noticeable

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

332

thing is the number of cattle that would be necessary to make such a
pile of bones (Winship 1896: 140).
Castaneda definitely described the southern plains area in this
exerpt, and specifically mentioned an area in which salt lakes are present.
Castaneda also mentioned in his narrative that they traveled by way of
both salt and fresh water lakes. This area visited by Castaneda appears to
fit the description of lakes within the Portales valley drainage system
(Holden 1944: 14).
The Portales valley drainage system extends from near Portales, New
Mexico, to west of Lubbock, Texas. Drainage is from the northwest dipping towards the southeast. Salt lakes are found extending from northern
Bailey and Lamb Counties to the southern edge of the Llano Estacado.
Castaneda’s bone bed should be within the northern area of the salt
lakes as stated. Thorough geological investigations by Evans and Meade
(1945) indicated vertebrate palaeontological localities within this northern
salt lake area; however, only one was described as a bison bone bed
situated along the southern edge of a salt lake.
This particular vertebrate palaeontological locality described by
Evans and Meade is Locality Number 10. It is a bison bone bed 55 yards
southeast of Silver Lake. Silver Lake is in the extreme northwestern
corner of Hockley County, Texas and extends into adjacent Cochran
County (Fig. 1).

Locality Number 10 has been assigned the name the "Silver Lake
Bison Site." Several anthropological sites are located nearby and a
Spanish sword with inscriptions dating 1724 has been found east of the
lake (Demel 1976). Silver Lake was also used as a natural landmark by
Mexican guides for the U. S. military during the 1874-1875 Red River War.
As indicated, the lake area has an intriguing, complex story of historical
significance.
The Silver Lakes Bison Site was originally recorded on November 8,
1954, by Jack T. Hughes of West Texas State University. Hughes and Glen
Evans examined several fossil sites in the area. The November field notes
were used as a guide for a February 22, 1976, re-examination of the site.
Arrangements were made prior to the February field trip for
permission to investigate the site located on the McCutchin Ranch. The
February observations indicated Silver Lake was .7 mile in length by 1/~
to 1/a mile in width, or north-south direction. Diameter of the lake had
previously been reported as .7 mile (Reeves 1966: 282). The lake’s
measurements have varied which is to be expected of playa lakes.
Silver Lake is fed by underground springs from both the east and
west side (Hogue 1976). A high content of salt in the lake deprives the
lakeshore of much vegetation; however, a few cacti and yucca are
present in the sandy soil surrounding the lake.
Silver Lake (Fig. 2) was formed out of a series of lakes which were
filled during the Late Wisconsin glaciation. Presently minor land
modifications are taking place in the form of wind action that results in
the formation of sand dunes.
Soil deposits are of two distinguishable types: the Tahoka Clay, and
recent dune sand. The Tahoka Clay is bluish gray in color and is the
oldest deposit definitely recognized in Silver Lake (Frye and Leonard
1957: 8). Extinct vertebrate animal faunas are associated within some
of the Tahoka Clay deposits. These fossils are representatives of the
Late Pleistocene. Unconformably overlying the Tahoka Clay is the recent
sand material. Prevailing southwest and winter north winds present a
major erosional problem at the site. The result is a mixture of the
bluish-gray clay with reddish brown sand.
The Silver Lake Bison Site (Fig. 3) is situated in the Tahoka Clay at
a depth of 6 to 8 inches (Bass and Kiser 1976: 5). Bison bone also rests
on top of the Tahoka Clay intermixed with caliche, and recent dune soil.
The bison site underlies 6 to 8 feet of overburden and covers an
area of 35 yards east-west by 32 yards north-south. The bison bone is
piled, giving the appearance and mixture of a bone bed. The number of
individual bison present is estimated at two dozen. The bone is in good
shape and is mineralized. A few samples of the bone were taken to
Killgore Research Center in Canyon, Texas, for comparative studies.
The Silver Lake Bison Bone samples proved to be much larger in

comparison to bison from known Archaic bison sites of the Texas
Panhandle. After comparative studies and identification were made the
Silver Lake samples were placed in the Panhandle-Plains Historical
Museum and assigned the site number of P-61.
Some of the bison gives the appearance of being broken prior to
deposition {Wendorf and Hester 1975: 32). Located near the bison bone
is evidence of burned caliche, previously reported by Wendorf and
Hester (1975). Artifacts had previously been found by Adolph A. Witte
near the bison site and Folsom points have been found along the lake’s
eastern dune ridge (Demel 1976}. These findings enhance the probability
of an Early Man site at Silver Lake.
The Silver Lake Bison Site, previously discussed, and Castaneda’s
bone bed in all reality may be the same site. The Silver Lake Bison Site
was the only bone bed described by Evans and Meade located on the
south side of a salt lake. The assumption of the Silver Lake Bison Site
being Castaneda’s cannot be made on these comparisons alone. Other
comparisons can be made as follows: Castaneda described his bone bed
as being a crossbow shot long, or a very little less (Winship 1896: 140).
James Hansen, former Director of the Panhandle-Plains Historical
Museum, described the length of a crossbow shot as being about 200
yards (Hansen 1976). Bison bones were found on the February field trip
eroding out of the terrace edge 180 yards west of the main bison bone
concentration. These samples were also mineralized and of the same
comparable size as those at the main site concentration. Palaeontological testing indicated that the majority of the bones had already
eroded (Wendorf and Hester 1975: 32); Castaneda described his bone
bed as being almost twice a man’s height in places and some 18 feet or
more wide (Winship 1896: 140). Height of the Silver Lake Bison Site was
recorded as being over 8 feet, and the site extends north of the terrace
edge 15 yards; Castaneda remarked on the number of cattle that would
be necessary to make such a pile of bones (Winship 1896: 140).
These comparisons are all intriguing, but the most interesting still
remains that Evans and Meade only found one bone bed on the south
side of a salt lake. Several historians have considered the Silver Lake as
one of the possibilities as being within the return route of Coronado’s
army (Fig. 4). Four historians have properly placed their routes within
the salt lake area; however, Holden and Donoghue’s routes are along
the extreme northern area of the salt lakes in northern Bailey and
Lamb Counties. Winship and Wedel placed their proposed routes
further south, nearer Silver Lake, and away from the very marginal
salt, fresh water area.
Definite proof of the Silver Lake Bison Site being Castaneda’s bone
bed does not exist, nor will it ever be definitely proven. But as indicated
in this paper, the Silver Lake Bison Site is the most likely candidate for

RE-EXAMINATION OF BONE BED

being the first palaeontological and archaeological site to be recorded in
the American Southwest.

Two Clay Figurines from the Central
Coas[al Region of Texas
CHARLES K.

CHANDLER

ABSTRACT
Descriptive data are provided for two clay figurines from the
central coastal area of Texas. One specimen appears to be linked to
the Late Prehistoric Rockport Complex, while the cultural attribution
of the other is uncertain.

Two fired clay figurines from the central coastal area of Texas are
described. One is from San Patricio County and one is from Live Oak
County (see Fig. 1).
The first of these two figurines was discovered in 1969 by the late
D. R. Espy on the surface of an open campsite along Chiltipin Creek, San
Patricio County, Texas. The site, 41 SP 77, is one of several sites recorded
along Chiltipin Creek by the author and D. R. Espy. All of these sites are
located immediately adjacent to the existing stream channel and most are
subject to occasional flooding. Site 41 SP 77 was discovered and recorded
after severe flooding removed approximately 10 inches of topsoil. The clay
figurine was found a few weeks later after subsequent flooding.
Most of the sites along Chiltipin Creek had large amounts of lithic
debitage and artifacts, but pottery was comparatively scarce. Materials
recovered from 41 SP 77 include Perdiz and Scallorn arrow points, cornernotched expanding stem dart points, side-notched rectangular stem dart
points that most closely resemble the Darl type, triangular stemless forms
of both straight base and rounded base types, several forms of bifaces,
four different styles of drills (bi-pointed, large rounded base, reworked
Plainview dart point, and alternately beveled point on a flake), cores,
metate fragments, flake blades, flake scrapers, hammerstones, and 25
small potsherds. Of the 25 sherds, nine are about the same color as the

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

342

figurine with similar amounts of sand in the paste; but, these nine sherds
have bone temper. The remaining sherds have a fine sandy appearance
with occasional bone temper. One is asphalt-coated on the interior and
two are partially asphalt-coated on the exterior. Surface and core colors
range from light gray through dark brown to black. The reddish to buff
sherds and the figurine have coarser sand grains than the gray to black
sherds. This difference in grain size is visible only under magnification.

The figurine does not appear to have had a head but does have abbreviated legs, one of which is partially missing and also has horizontally
cut indentations across the torso near the upper portions of the legs. These
appear intended to delineate the limit of the legs. There is also a cut
surface from these indentations downward to the lower limits of the legs.
These cuts were made by a sharp tool (possibly a flint flake) prior to firing.
A navel is formed on the frontal surface of the figurine. There is a slight
indentation at the top that tends to define the shoulders. There has been
some surface erosion of the figurine, but there are eight closely spaced,
vertical zigzag lines on the back and seven on the front. Five of these on the
front are on the right side. Some of these lines are barely visible and can
best be determined with magnification.
This figurine appears to be locally made. The paste is almost
identical to Rockport pottery and surface color is like much of the
reported Rockport wares (Suhm and Jelks 1962). The zigzag incised lines
are very similar to the squiggly asphalt lines found on Rockport Black on
Gray wares. It is well-fired.
The specimen is unlike the figurines reported from the !ower Pecos
area to the west. Those are unfired, and do not have appendages (legs);
see Sharer (1975 a,b) and Shafer and Speck (1974).
My original intent was to document only the San Patricio County
figurine found by Espy, but in my search for comparative information I
discovered that Jim Warren had found a clay figurine in Live Oak
County that had not been documented. This fired clay artifact (see Figs.
4-6) was found (on the surface and without other directly associated
artifacts) in the general area of site 41 LK 67 overlooking the Frio River
near Three Rivers. It appears to be anthropomorphic, but only the torso
survives. It shows evidence of having had a head, arms and legs but
these appendages are missing. It is shaped by hand. Following are data

Clay figurines are almost unknown in southern Texas. The only
previous report reflecting their occurrence was by George C. Martin
(1929} who reported specimens from a site on Copano Bay:
"Two small curious objects of reddish baked clay. These could have
been of no particular use and were probably fetishes or ceremonial.
The clay composing these were baked to unusual hardness. The objects
themselves were of irregular shape, and about two-thirds of the surface
of each was coated over with a thick layer of asphalt. A third specimen
of exactly similar materials found on the banks of Inferno Creek, Baffin
Bay, Kleberg County. The three specimens appear to have been made at
one time, all by one person. The clay of all three baked to a peculiar
shade never found in pot sherds along the coast."

These three objects were reportedly donated to the Witte Museum
(San Antonio) but could not be located for comparative studies.
Fired clay figurines do occur elsewhere in Texas (e.g., Skinner 1978)
but are very scarce. Newell and Krieger (1949) report one torso fragment
from the George C. Davis site. This object is described in detail by Fritz
(1975). From this description it appears to be similar in size and surface
color to the Live Oak County figurine.
Hollow and solid body figurines of Mesoamerican origin have been
noted in central and south Texas. I have looked at illustrations of these (cf.
Krieger 1953) and none of them resemble the two artifacts described here.
The two figurines documented in this note are an insufficient sample
for any far reaching conclusions regarding their cultural implications.
However, they do add to our growing knowledge of the cultural inventories
of the prehistoric people of this area of Texas.

Additional Notes on the Fishing Technology
of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico
DAVID A.

PHILLIPS, JR.

ABSTRACT
Notched net-sinkers, described by Eaton (1976) for the Gulf Coast
of Yucatan, are also found on that peninsula’s eastern coast.
Preliminary results of an analysis of net-sinkers from the island of
Cozumel, Mexico, are discussed.

INTRODUCTION
In the 1976 Bulletin, a paper by Jack D. Eaton reported on a survey of
the north coast of Yucatan, Mexico. Eaton found over 200 notched sherds
and stones at eight coastal sites, and he concluded that they were net- and
line-sinkers used in fishing.
Such net-sinkers are common in Mesoamerica. Eaton (1976: 234-236)
notes a number of locations, including the Yucatecan east coast, where
they have been found. However, one place not mentioned by him has
yielded what is probably the largest single collection of notched sherds
and stones from the Maya area. This is the island of Cozumel (Fig. 1),
where excavations in 1972 and 1973 turned up over 1000 such items.
There, they were tentatively termed mariposas -- Spanish for "butterflies" -- in order to avoid the automatic functional implications of a
term like "net-sinker." They have been described only briefly so far
(Connor 1975: 131-133)but are now being analyzed as part of the Cozumel
Project’s artifact collections. It is already possible to add some comments
to Eaton’s report, based on findings from the 1973 season.

DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIMENS
1. Materials and manufacture. Eaton found more notched stones

(168) than notched sherds (58) on his survey of the north coast. The stone
and sherd sinkers also came from separate sites. On Cozumel, however,
the situation is different: of 1068 notched items from the 1973 field season,
1027 were of pottery, 23 of coral, 16 of limestone, and two of shell The
various materials are found mixed at any given site.
Analysis suggests that manufacture of notched artifacts on Cozumel
is the same as that described for the northern coast. Sherds, in particular,
were worked into shape by breaking and grinding the edges, and then the
notches were cut into the endswith a sharp blade (Eaton 1976: 234). With
softer varieties of pottery, however, cutting the sherd to shape was also
done. Four notched artifacts made of Fine Orange Ware from Cozumel still
show clear cut-marks along their edges.
Notched clay pellets (Fig. 2,h), not found by Eaton, occur rarely (7
times) in the Cozumel collections. The notch was incised into the pellet
before firing, while the clay was still wet. Such specimens are smaller and
lighter than those of pottery, coral, stone, or shell.
Sizes and weights reported by Eaton for the north coast (1976: 234)
conform to those for Cozumel. Eaton’s notched sherds ranged in weight
from 5 to 51 grams; those from the island range from 1 to 36 grams with a
mean of 6.6 grams.
2. Wear patterns. On some slipped-ware notched sherds, the slip has
worn off the convex surface of the sherd except in the zone between the

two notches, creating a "stripe" (Fig. 2,d, e, f). This seems to be the result
of gradual abrasion, not deliberate removal of slip. Only a small
proportion of the notched sherds (33 out of 1027) show this trait, but many
of the others were unslipped to begin with or were very weathered when
found. The "striping" trait is found on Tuluum Red Ware (20 out of 295),
Mayapan Red Ware (9 out of 123), and Puuc Slate Ware (3 out of 28).
"Striping" on these notched sherds is also known from the site of Tuluum
(Alfredo Barrera, personal communication).
The obvious interpretation of such "stripes" is that at some time
there was a cord tied around the artifact, through the notches; this cord
protected the slip beneath it as the rest of the surface of the object
gradually was being abraded. These notched artifacts have been interpreted as weft-weights for weaving (Kent and Nelson 1976), or as
door-hangings (Brunelle 1974; see Clavigero in Pollock and others 1962:
184). But neither of these functions would expose the artifacts to the
kind of regular, gradual wear suggested by "striping." Use as weights
in nets or on lines, however, would produce just this kind of wear
pattern.

3. Temporal and spatial distribution. Dating of excavation units on
Cozumel awaits completion of pottery analysis, but the wares on which
mariposas were made give an indication of their time range. Of the 272
mariposas on diagnostic sherds, 4 are from the Formative or Early
Periods, 38 are from the Florescent, and 230 from the Decadent or
Contact Periods (3 are on European wares). The increase through time
probably reflects population trends rather than more intensive use in
later periods, although other interpretations are possible.
It might be expected that these notched artifacts, as net-sinkers,
would be concentrated on the coast of Cozumel (the island is 14 kin, or
8.5 mi. wide). Actually, they are just as common at interior sites. This
suggests that fishing was a general activity practiced by a wide
segment of the population. Of course, there could have been specialists
located on the coast, and who fished, for example, out at sea. But they
probably did so in addition to farmers from interior sites, who spent an
occasional day wading in the shallows with a casting net made at home.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
Analysis of notched artifacts from Cozumel supports Eaton’s interpretation of notched potsherds and similar items as fishing weights.
Notching on such sherds is invariably functional for suspension; and a
heretofore undescribed phenomenon labelled "striping," apparently a
use-wear pattern, suggests the kind of rough-and-tumble treatment that
fishing weights would undergo. The weight range of Cozumel mariposas
is concordant with the range of lead weights used by modern-day
Yucatecan coastal fishermen (Eaton 1976: 239).
The Cozumel fishing weights, incidentally,

show

an

amazing

variability in terms of size, shape, and finish. This variability is difficult
to explain and appears not to correlate with temporal shifts. Perhaps
the ancient Cozumeleans did not really care what the artifacts looked
like, so long as they performed their assigned function.

These two publications, part of a series of three reports dealing with
test excavations at Palmetto Bend Reservoir, cover historic site work and
architectural documentation in 1974 within the reservoir area. The work
was done primarily at and in relation to the old townsite of Texana,
although several other historic sites are dealt with briefly. Principal Investigator for the project was David Dibble and series editor was Suzanne
Carter.
"Texana: Excavations at a Nineteenth Century Inland Coastal Town"
is a report of archeological testing done at the townsite in June, 1974, by
members of the Texas Archeological Survey staff. The report is divided
into a number of sections.
The first section, appropriately entitled "The Nineteenth Century
Coastal Scene," consists of a brief survey of the history of the area from
the time of LaSalle through Reconstruction. Hampered at first by some
needlessly erudite language and the evident omission of one line of type
which obscures the meaning at one point, the statement recovers admirably by the second page and the remainder of the section is thoroughly
and adequately done. I would argue with the consistent misspelling of
Felix Huston’s name, but this is undoubtedly an editorial oversight rather

356

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

than the author’s error. The inclusion of an eyewitness account of Civil
War times in Texana enlivens and enhances the historical account.
The next section, "Texana: Establishment to Abandonment," tells the
history of the town from several points of view which complement each
other and present a comprehensive picture of the settlement. First,
establishment and layout of the town is described and discussed by
Jackson. I do not share her conclusion that the town plan "reflects its
Mexican dependence" (p. 5). The evidence that it was first conceived in
1834, that Spanish measurements were used and that it was laid out in an
orderly manner is not sufficient in itself to prove any particular
relationship to the Laws of the Indies. Most town plans of this period in
Texas could be said to share these same specifications. Actually the plan
more closely resembles those of early towns in Virginia (Reps 1971: 120,
128), probably reflecting the Anglo-American background of its founders.
The legal background, by Kerry Grombacher, consists of a wellwritten account of the acquisition of the land and the growth and final
collapse of the town as seen through the county records. Notes are handled with a table of numbered deed references, an idea which we all might
profitably borrow in this sort of report. A short collection of contemporary
accounts rounds out this section. Surely more passing travellers must have
described a town in existence for over 50 years.
The following section concerns the excavations. A number of factors
have combined to make archeological investigation of the townsite difficult
and comparatively unproductive. Apparently many of the structures in the
town were removed to other locations when the site was abandoned (p.
19). Later much of the area was extensively bulldozed in a brush-removal
operation, a large gully made inroads into the site, and then much of the
area was root plowed and cultivated. In addition, a quantity of top soil had
been moved, creating a dam for a rice farming experiment. The only
features visible at the present time are a number of cisterns which show
up as depressions.
Because of these problems, extensive use was made of a backhoe
and a road maintainer in trenching and blading selected areas which
were determined to be those where concentration of population
probably occurred. In one of these areas a brick chimney footing and
foundations were located and controlled excavations revealed the
outlines of two structures. These were subsequently identified as a
dwelling and detached kitchen built in the mid-19th century. A
magnetometer survey of part of the site located no other subsurface
structures. The fact that the building for which the foundations were
located is one which was still on the site in the early 20th century (p.
45) undoubtedly accounts for its partial preservation.
It is unfortunate that there was not more careful coordination
between the site map and the excavation drawings. As it is, one must

BOOK

REVIEWS

357

study the descriptions and photographs and locate the excavation units
on the site map by deduction and intuition. It is also hard to understand
why the superposition of the townsite map over the site map has been
done in such a way as to put half of the cisterns in the streets. Possibly
this discrepancy is due to the use of 2.78 feet to equal one vara. According to Taylor (1955:

71-72) the equivalent agreed upon in 1837

between the Mexican government and holders of Mexican bonds was
833 mm or 2.75 feet. In the width of a 60-foot street, this would mean a
difference of two feet.

illsutrations are excellent. I have a few arguments with terms used to
describe the ceramics, such as the use of the term "Gaudy Dutch" for
hand painted pearlwares (p. 50) and "Stamped" for sponged or spattered pearlwares (p. 51). However, the descriptions and illustrations are
sufficiently clear to indicate the author’s intent. While the descriptions
of glass tableware and miscellaneous glass are quite clear, one might
wish that these had been illustrated for purposes of comparison with
those from other sites.
The last section of the main body of the report, entitled "Epilog,"
might be more accurately called

"Summary and

Conclusions." Un-

fortunately there appears here, as in so many of our reports, the wistful
prsumption that should additional structural remains be revealed in the
course of reservoir construction, "the proper agencies would be contacted so that features can be examined and recorded." (p. I01). I
suppose we should never give up hope that this will be done.
Of the four appendices to this report, two are deserving of special
attention for the important information they contain. Catherine Yates in
Appendix I does an interesting job of recording and discussing three
cemeteries near Texana. The background information on burial practices is useful and her sketches are more detailed and readable than
photographs would have been.
In Appendix IV Georganna Greer has done her usual thorough job
of research and careful description of the Abraham Babcock Pottery
Manufactory. Of particular interest is the news that lead glazed pottery
was being made in this area of south Texas around 1860. Sherds of the
Babcock lead glazed wares are sufficiently like those from wares imported from Mexico during the previous century to cause confusion for
us all. The possibility that some of the 19th century wares which we
have previously attributed to Mexico might have originated in Texas
bears further investigation. We hope that Dr. Greer will continue to
search out and report these elusive south Texas potters. Unfortunately,

would have been helpful to include the Babcock site on the map in
Figure 1.
J. Barto Arnold reports in Appendix III that a magnetometer survey
shows that two anomalies recorded at the Babcock site could be the
location of the kiln. Certainly more work should be done to determine if
there is anything remaining at this site.
Appendix II is a brief report on work done at three other historic
sites in the reservoir. In each case it was decided that natural or
human interference had caused sufficient destruction to make further
investigation pointless.
This report is attractive in appearance, with good maps and
illustrations. The authors have made the best of unfortunate site conditions. I wonder if more time spent in detailed site reconstruction
before going into the field and testing closer to the edge of the old river
channel might have found some of the wharf area. However, it seems
likely that very little remains.
Given the stated intent of the project (p. ix) "to amplify the total
framework within which investigations at historic sites in the reservoir
would be evaluated" (whatever that means}, I hope the minimal amount
of structural information recovered at these sites will not discourage
further historic site work in the reservoir.
In the preface to "Architecture of Texana", Crosby explains that
the initial intent of the study was to identify and document the six
buildings known to have been moved from Texana seven miles north to
Edna in the 1880’s, when the town was abandoned. When it was
discovered that none of these buildings was constructed before 1875,
the scope of the project was expanded to include other structures in the
surrounding area, in other parts of East Texas and along the coast in
order to more accurately describe all types of buildings which would
have existed at Texana during its 52-year history.
The
methodology of the study included
measuring
and
photographing of the structures and structural details, archival
research and personal interviews in order to record as much as
possible about the history of each building. Extensive use was made of
early accounts, diaries and newspaper advertisements in compiling
information on building materials available at various time periods.
Part I, entitled "Architecture of the First Twenty Nine Years {18311859)," consists of a compilation of information on frontier architecture,
with emphasis on east Texas and the Austin colony. Also included are
several eyewitness descriptions of early buildings in and around
Texana. Sections on available materials, building design and building
practices are full of information which will be of particular interest to
the archaeologist working with structures of this period. The section on
commercial buildings is regrettably brief. Unfortunately little attention
has been paid to this type of construction by authors of books about

359

BOOK REVIEWS

early Texas architecture. A study on these buildings similar to
Alexander’s (1966) work on early Texas homes would be a useful
contribution to the literature.
Part II, entitled "Architecture of the Last Twenty Three Years
(1860-1883)" entails primarily a detailed description of the history and
construction of twelve buildings located in the vicinity of Texana. Ten
houses, including the six moved from Texana to Edna, a church and a
store comprise the group. Each building is well recorded in photographs
and sketches, and both historical and structural documentation are
impressively thorough. While the first impulse is to read one or two and
skip the rest as redundant, one soon discovers that each structure is
unique and that bits and pieces of valuable building information and
hints on dating old structures are included in each descriptive section.
The concluding chapter entitled "Trends," consists of 27 pages of
information vital to the historical archaeololgist. Included are details on
everything from reasons for choice of building locations and orientations, to the choice of paint colors. Crosby discusses in some detail the
evolution of floor plans and building profiles. Useful sections are included on materials, structural systems and architectural details.
The first appendix is a portion of the daybook of John A.
Brackenridge of Texana, kept between 1854 and 1856. Included are
plans for a number of houses, along with detailed lists of building
materials required for their construction. Three other appendices
contain tabulated comparisons of windows, paint colors and types of
milled lumber used in the houses described in Part II.
The format of the publication is well-organized, with few
typographical errors. The illustrations are sharp and readable and the
sketches of framing details should be most helpful for those of us not
familiar with architectural terms.
This impressive piece of work should be required reading for
anyone doing historic site archaeology in Texas. Not only is the detailed
structural information valuable, but instruction is gained in how to fully
document a historic structure and which details are important to record
for future reference.

Hop Hill: Culture and Climatic Change in Central Texas. Center
for Archaeological Research, The University of Texas at San
Antonio, Special Report, No. 5. x + 295 pp., 99 illus. Out of print.
Hop Hill is a prehistoric site located in Lyndon B. Johnson State
Historic Park near Stonewall, Texas. Fieldwork which lead to this
monograph was conducted in the summer, 1976 as a field course in archeology at The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) and was
compiled with the assistance of a laboratory analysis class at UTSA. The
study was directed by Joel Gunn and is an example of the interest and
energy which canbe fostered in an enthusiastic and aware environment.
The monograph presents the results of a wide range of multidisciplinary
research activities which were focused upon Hop Hill.
As an integrative mechanism Gunn conceives of the research as a
sphere intersected by a plane. The plane is the ground surface which is
enveloped by the ecosphere in its atmospheric and geospheric aspects.
Hop Hill is situated in the center of the plane and the sphere and is conceived as the location where a body of data has been preserved {encoded)
and which can be extracted using a specific suite of excavation techniques
{decoder). After acknowledging belief in the value of attempting to solve
explicit problems, the report shifts to describing the various aspects of the
ecospher~ rather than thoroughly developing specific site problems.
A great deal of descriptive information is presented about various
aspects of the natural environment. In fact this reviewer conceives of
these sections as an almanac or encyclopedia of basic data and almost a
manual which could be used to show beginning researchers many of
factors they should be aware of when beginning archeological and
ethnographic studies. Researchers in the Texas "hill country" should
avail themselves of this monograph for the basic information it contains.
After a cursory description of four physiographic zones across which
the site is spread and the five stratigraphic strata at the site, the writers
describe the excavation phases: "Roadbed", "Midden" and "Village".
The only real description of the "village" is that it was 1 x 1 m unit that
coincided with an area of possible Paleo-Indian occupation. No explanation is offered as to the presence of a "village". Later on these terms
are dropped and intrasite patterning is discussed without explaining the
transition from one set of terms to another. Possibly these were field
designations which were not caught in editing.

BOOK REVIEWS

A very stimulating section by David Brown and Clint Davis discusses
the role of erosion in site exposure and in evaluating the impact of erosion
upon archeological sites. This chapter presents a methodology which is
useful at Hop Hill but could be used by other researchers who recognize
the importance of quantifying erosional processes. One interesting
comment of this and a later artifact collection chapter is the recognition
that a methodology should serve the archeologist and not vice-versa. In
this case the authors recognize that transit readings on the tops of all nails
used in the experiment would have made it more precise but was not
justifiable in terms of its value to the experiment. A similar justification is
made with regard time and effort expenditure for individual artifact
plotting. Consequently the "surface surveyor" method devised by Phil
Bandy of Texas Tech University is recommended because it was shown
that this technique was more effective than a transit.
Lithic technology is a basic concern of the study. Models of core
flaking and face flaking (bifacial and unifacial) are presented and considerable effort is spent presenting lithic terminology. Many of these facts
have become common in Texas archeology but with the aid of J. B. Sollberger a new concept is presented and developed. Sollberger made a
biface and broke its manufacture down into critical technological steps.
The debris from this process was quantified by step and is used as a
standard against which debris from various parts of the site was compared. Using this "Sollberger distribution" it was possible to show that
there are spatially and functionally separable activity areas within the
site.
In a short four-page chapter W. Max Witkind describes a carefully
conducted experiment in stone boiling, a form of aboriginal cooking
technology. The experiment demonstrated that reheated boiling stones
have less ability to retain heat than unfired pieces. It is suggested that this
may explain the large number of stones in burned rock middens but that
further experimentation will be necessary to show the differences between heated stones which were used for boiling and those heated and
used for other activities. This working experiment could be conducted by
researchers in the Texas hill country and would not require a university
facility to carry out.
The monograph is so extensive that much more could be written about
it. It is an ambitious study which shows the value of multidisciplinary
research but suffers somewhat from overenthusiasm. Nevertheless it
contains a wealth of information and should stimulate future research in
Central Texas. Texas Parks and Wildlife should be thanked for having the
study done and UTSA thanked for developing an innovative archeological
program.

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL ~SO~CIETY

A Predictive Assessment of Cultural Resources in Hidalgo and
Willacy Counties, Texas. by Robert J. Mallouf, Barbara J. Baskin,
and Kay L. Killen. Texas Historical Commission, Office of the State
Archeologist, Archeological Survey Report, No. 23, Austin, 1977.
xv + 308 pp., 73 illus., II tables. $8.00.
This volume is the ultimate in a tradition of arche01ogical survey
investigations by the State Archeologist’s Office funded by various
government agencies complying" with antiquities legislation. It was
prepared in response to a request by the Corps of Engineers for a
predictive assessment of archeological and historical resources in an area
of 3,900 square kilometers in Willacy and Hidalgo counties. To this end,
Mallouf and his associates developed their own research strategy, its
primary purpose being to make a "statistically valid sample field
reconnaissance in the proximity of the proposed single-purpose floodwater channels ... of the magnitude required to provide a predictive
model for the numbers, types, and significance of archeological and
historical resources (Corps of Engineers, quoted in Mallouf, et el.: 89)..."
Also in answer to government specifications, the authors compiled information from "available publications and any unpublished materials
related to past work in the project area which, when combined in summary with survey data, shall provide the basis for the report (Corps of
Engineers, quoted in Mallouf, et el.: 89)."
A wealth of data concerning geology, climate, flora, fauna, and landmodification of the study area are presented by Mallouf and Baskin in the
first of three extensive background sections of the report. The second of
these, Killen’s "Ethnohistory", synthesizes the history of 16th-2Oth century
population of the project area and explains the significance of salt in
historic trade. Baskin’s "Archeological Background" offers a well
researched critical review of archeological work in "far southern Texas".
Next is Mallouf’s explanation of the "Strategy of Investigation".
Patterned after a methodology proposed for the California desert (Weide
1973), project objectives were designed to satisfy government needs,
rather than to further basic archeological research. Determining the
sampling strategy, Mallouf argues against the use of probability sampling,
and chooses his own "judgement sampling which employs certain attributes of probability methodology (p. 93)." He proceeds to explain why
the sampling strategy was executed using large quadrats, as opposed to
narrow transects, and that these quadrats were placed "on the basis of
judicious, non-statistical selection" (p. 96). Among other factors, incessant
rainfall and reluctance of some landowners to permit property access
influenced the placement of 12 quadrat sample areas.
A section entitled "Sampling Divisions" presents a detailed
description of seven environmental zones, followed by environmental
descriptions, presurvey predictions, and survey results for each of the

BOOK REVIEWS

363

twelve quadrats used to sample six of the seven environmental zones.
Next comes a "Prehistoric Overview" with a lengthy description of
2,368 specimens of prehistoric cultural material, followed by a detailed
interpretation of this material, and culminating in a number of hypotheses
concerning aboriginal lifeways. Much less verbiage is found in the
description and discussion of historic material culture and a listing of
significant historic markers, National Register sites, and cemetery sites in
the project area.
In the next section, Mallouf and Baskin make their "Site Projections
for the Project and Sample Universes." For prehistoric sites, field data
and statistical data, calculations of site densities, projections of site
conditions, and projections of site and zone significance are organized by
environmental zone. A much less rigorous approach to historic site
projections is given.
Finally, recommendations for further pre-construction and construction investigations are made for each environmental zone. A detailed
description and discussion of a large private collection of material culture
forms an appendix. A short glossary of selected technical jargon and an
extensive bibliography conclude the report.
In the style of previous publications by the Office of the State
Archeologist, the graphics in this volume are excellent. Indeed, without
them the organization of the text might be more difficult to follow. Had
the verbal elaboration of data presentation been condensed into tables,
charts, and appendices, the continuity of the contents would have been
more apparent.
The report offers at least five contributions to the archeology of
"far southern Texas": (I) a thorough and delightful critical review of
previous research which reflects the increasingly competitive nature of
contract archeology; (2) a good ethnohistory; (3) a rigorous argument for
"judgement sampling" as opposed to probability sampling"; (4) basic
archeological reconnaissance data for 49 prehistoric and historic sites;
and (5) some intuition about prehistoric subsistence-settlement pattern.
All in all, the contents of the report accomplish its primary purpose
-- to deal mainly with the practical application of contract archeology
by delineating areas with a high probability of "reduced archeological
sensitivity" where construction would result in minimal costs for
mitigation (p. 89). Although the statistical validity of the sampling done
has ~et to be determined, the large quantity of background data
presented and the manipulation of field data are complicated enough to
intimidate the critical reveiwer, suggesting that the investigators’
projections are accurate enough for prehistoric sites. In this way,
Mallouf, Baskin, and Killen have succeeded in making a predictive
assessment of the cultural resources of Hidalgo and Willacy counties,
Texas.

However, the authors base their prehistoric site projections upon
the idea that various environmental variables are reliable predictors for
prehistoric site locations. Even though they concede that historic
European and American subsistence-settlement patterns may not be
predicted as reliably with strictly environmental variables (p. 241), they
sampled historic cultura! resources by quadrats selected using environmental predictors.
The reviewer is more concerned about the effects of the practical
(as opposed to academic) nature of the research design upon the
meaning of "archeological significance". For example, it is suggested in
the archeological background section that interpretation based on
surface evidence is much less credible than that based upon controlled
excavation (pp. 64, 81, 86-87). Yet, projections and interpretations made
in this report are based upon a very limited sample of surface evidence.
Perhaps such concepts as "archeological significance" and "archeological reality (p. 87)" should be afforded more introspective
consideration by archeologists competing for projects with predetermined research designs.

1977. 73 pp., 23 illus. $6.00.
Poverty Point is one of the more perplexing archeological sites in
prehistoric North America. The site is located along Bayou Maqon in
West Carroll Parish, northeastern Louisiana and consists of an
enigmatic structure of six concentric ridges arranged in a series and
forming a giant partial octagon opening to the east. Immediately west of

BOOK REVIEWS

365

the center series of ridges is Mound A, a massive structure measuring
seven meters high and approximately 73 by 91 meters at the base. The
smaller, conical Mound B lies north of Mound A. The nearby and apparently associated Motley Mound is 2.3 km north of the village center
while the Lower Jackson Group is almost equadistant south of the
center.
The Poverty Point culture, the nucleus of which is clearly the
Poverty Point site, was born out of a Southeastern U.S. Archaic complex
and was followed by a succession of ceramic assemblages such as
Tchefuncte, Marksville, Troyville, Coles Creek and Plaquemine. Components

of Poverty Point

are

found mostly on

natural

levees

and

terraces bordering major rivers that drain the lower Mississippi River
alluvial valley and central Gulf Coast. The area of the Poverty Point
culture incorporates the oak and hickory-dominated uplands with the
river valley ecological habitats, marshes, brackish water lakes and
saltwater resource zones.
The temporal span of Poverty Point culture is from about 1200 to
200 B.C. based on radiocarbon, thermoluminescence and the crossdating of artifact styles. The general lack of preservation of organic
materials, however, leave little tangible evidence for assessing the subsistence

mode

of

the

Poverty

Point

adaptation.

There

is

general

speculation that the economic pattern lacked agriculture although this
interpretation is based largely on negative data. The settlements range
markedly in size and Webb feels that these can be ranked into regional
centers such as Jaketown; each regional center in turn is thought to
have had a network of supporting satellite settlements and the Terral
Lewis Site is considered an example of such a village.
The diagnostic elements of the Poverty Point sites lie not in their
distribution or settlement location, use of mounds or site layout, but
rather in a diagnostic set of artifacts which convincingly demonstr.ates
the

participation

in

an

interaction

network.

The

artifacts

most

diagnostic of Poverty Point culture include the Poverty Point baked clay
objects which are hand molded into a variety of shapes; six shapes are
especially diagnostic. The function served by these objects is interpreted by Webb to be in the realm of food processing. A small amount
of pottery occurs at some Poverty Point sites including a fiber-tempered
ware along with sherds either tempered with clay-grit or exhibiting no
visible tempering agent. Solid clay figurines are occasionally found and
Webb suggests their presence implies some contact with Mesoamerica.
Steatite and sandstone vessels occur at the better-investigated Poverty
Point sites but these never appear to be common at any one site. Other
items in the stone technology include the interesting core-blade microflint industry,

hematite and magnetite plummets and an impressive

lapidary craft that yielded cylindrical and zoomorphic-shaped stone
beads.

366

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Webb presents an excellent synthesis of what is known of the
settlement patterns and distribution system of the Poverty Point culture.
He provides descriptions of representative sites and of the diagnostic
artifact assemblage. The 23 illustrations of sites and artifacts are
highly informative and serve as an impressive indicator of the sociopolitical complexity of the Poverty Point cultural system and influence.
Webb’s discussion on the societal implications of the intrasite
artifact patterning at the Poverty Point site and on the intersite
distribution of certain artifact sets is perhaps the weakest part of the
overall contribution. These interpretations would be regarded as highly
subjective at best. Largly influenced by his colleague Jon Gibson, Webb
believes that the answer to the enigma of Poverty Point’s position in a
seemingly Archaic milieu lies in the evidence of a widespread
population and in a social organization structured in a series of centers
consisting of regional chiefdoms. Assuming that social organization can
be delineated by the distribution of "artifact fossils" Webb interpreted
the distributional patterns of certain artifact classes as indicating
hierarchical ranking and matrilocal residence at the Poverty Point Site.
The intrasite patterning of the artifact classes indicates some
intrasite variability at the Poverty Point site. The interpretation that
these are indicative of matrilocal residence and male or female activity
areas is, however, suspect to this reviewer. The site may have been
utilized for 1000 years and it would be very difficult to explain a
constant pattern of usage for all parts of the site over 50 or more
generations. In other words, one would expect differential use of
portions of the site through time. Over 18,000 artifacts were sorted "in
an attempt to show differences by presumed gender or social class
usage in various parts of the site" (p. 54). These groups include objects
thought to indicate women’s everyday activities, a lamellar microflint
cores, blades and blade tools presumed to have a special function and
masculine hunting and fowling objects, among others. These groups are
meaningless since the function of any of the artifacts in the groups is
not satisfactorily demonstrated, and the cultural information to
ascertain the gender of the task in the Poverty Point culture is simply
not available. It is a general rule in tracing the evolution of human
society from egalitarian hunting and gathering cultures through the
continuum of agricultural technololgy that divisions of labor become
progressively more complex and variable as a higher level of social
integration is reached. The level of social integration implied by the size
and structure of the Poverty Point site would not indicate a simplified
egalitarian division of labor. To assume that only women cooked or used
"culinary objects" is without foundation and that a rare steatite vessel
would constitute a "culinary object" is equally doubtful. Furthermore,
the function of the artifacts in the entire class of "masculine hunting
and fowling objects" (plummets and stemmed bifaces) is only presumed

367

BOOK REVIEWS

and far from demonstrated; in a zone of poor stone resources, one
cannot assume that all stemmed bifaces were indicative of hunting.
There is no doubt that Poverty Point site served as the hub of a farreaching and complex interaction network. However, to assume that
each site was contemporaneous with all others and fits into a static
model of a settlement network is extending the data beyond reasonable
limits.

A workable settlement model must incorporate

a

dimension

allowing for change in the system. Based on the data Webb provides,
this

reviewer’s

interpretation

is

that

the

Poverty

Point

culture

represents an example of an interregional interaction network. The
location of the components suggest to me that the contemporaneous
sites were probably linked by a

network of riverine routes which

provided the means for transporting bulk resources for exchange. The
system could have operated effectively with

symbiotic relationship be-

tween dialectic tribes occupying contiguous resource areas. Such an
interaction sphere would easily explain the hint of a regional uniqueness yet allow for interregional exchange and artifact similarity. Until
the Poverty Point components are better dated and the functional range
of the diagnostic artifacts (and indeed all artifact classes) are determined,

statements

on societal organization

of political and kinship

nature best be placed under the heading of presumption or speculation.
To this reviewer, Poverty Point has not been satisfactorily explained. Its
eventual explanation will undoubtedly serve as a significant key to
understanding the cultural processes which gave rise to the AdenaHopewell and Mississippian cultural developments and in gauging the
kinds

and

eminated

nature
from

the

of

the

influences

Mesoamerican

in

the

Formative

Southeastern U.S.
and

systems.
Aside from these interpretive disagreements, Webb has brought
together in this monograph many years of research and thought involving the Poverty Point site. He has made an excellent contribution to
the prehistory of the Eastern United States. This monograph will stand
as an invaluable reference for the Poverty Point culture. It is highly
recommended for any researcher who is interested in the Formative
development in the Eastern United States and in a most intriguing
adaptation to the lower Mississippi Valley.

A Guide to Basic Archaeological Field Procedures. By K.R.
Fladmark. Department of Archaeology, Simon Fraser University,
Publication No. 4.1978. 189 pp. + 102 illus. $8.00.
This spiral-bound volume is, I think, a very useful technical manual. It
was specifically designed for use by Canadian archeologists, and so there
are certain parts (e.g., discussion of Canadian site designation systems)
that are not applicable in the United States. However, it presents a host of
basic step-by-step, "how-to-do-things" procedures for a variety of field
tasks, including site survey, mapping, field photography, and excavation.
Some readers will find the chapters on equipment handling and field living
quite interesting. Knowing how to operate (and repair) water pumps,
power winches, and the like are often essential in field work, as are the
considerations that go into the selection of a field camp, setting up a field
kitchen, navigating in the wilderness, and fending off the bears and wood
ticks. To demonstrate the emphasis on practicality found in this manual,
there is even a section on the protocol to be used in dealing with visitors
who show up unannounced at your site. Illustrations are numerous and
generally illuminating, although sometimes crudely drawn. There is a 16page glossary that will be of most use to beginning students or persons new
to avocational archeology. Appendices contain site survey form data
relevant to Canadian archeololgy, but there is also a table of random
numbers and a table of natural sines and cosines.
In general, this is primarily a guide to the practical aspects of field
work, or as the author states: "... a simple reference hand-book, intended
to be of particular use for relatively low-budget projects in isolated or
wilderness areas." I think it goes quite a bit beyond the "simple reference
hand-book" level, and that it contains much of value for both professional
and avocational archeologists. Fladmark notes that "... specialized
facets of archaeological inquiry ... are covered more fully in other
sources such as Hester, Heizer and Graham 1975." As co-author of this
latter volume, I would rather immodestly suggest that both books could be
usefully employed as basic references in field research.
