MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
On December 12 and 13, 2012, DMG Four Corners Research, Inc., conducted archaeological
investigations at the Breckenridge Wastewater Treatment Plant for proposed construction of a final
clarifier and chlorine contact structure. This action was in accordance with a permit issued by the
Texas Historical Commission (Texas Antiquities Permit No. 6382). Four backhoe trenches were
excavated: three in the proposed final clarifier location, and one in the proposed chlorine contact
structure location. The three backhoe trenches in the final clarifier location revealed the presence of
a highly disturbed context due to recent landfill activities by the City of Breckenridge. Datable
artifacts from all three trenches places the landfill activity to the 1970s and 1980s. The trench at the
location of the proposed chlorine contact structure revealed undisturbed soil deposits indicative of
a floodplain. No cultural remains were revealed in this trench. It is recommended that archaeological
clearance be granted so that this project can move forward.

1.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Breckenridge is the county seat of Stephens County (Figure 1.1). The project area is located on the
north edge of Breckenridge, as depicted on the Breckenridge, Tex. (1958) 7.5-minute USGS
topographic map (Figure 1.2).
The City of Breckenridge has received funding from the Texas Water Development Board Clean
Water State Revolving Fund to construct improvements to their Wastewater Treatment Plant
(WWTP). The proposed construction would consist of adding a final clarifier and a chlorine contact
structure. In a Technical Memorandum prepared by Enprotec/Hibbs and Todd, it was recommended
that a limited archaeological survey be performed. This was based on the recommendation by the
Texas Water Development Board (TWDB), who noted that a 1992 archaeological survey had located
a prehistoric site east of the WWTP. In that recommendation, the TWDB suggested that backhoe
trenching be part of the archaeological scope of work. In order to complete its State of Texas cultural
resources assessment obligations, the city hired DMG Four Corners Research, Inc., to undertake
cultural resources investigations at the proposed locations (Figure 1.3).
2.0.ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
2.1 Geological Setting
Much of Stephens County is framed by the Cisco Group of rock formation from the Pennsylvania
System (Myers 1965). This group is dominated by shale but also contains some limestone, sandstone
and conglomerate. The Cisco Group consists of two broad geologic formations, an underlying
Graham Formation, which is about 525 feet thick. At its northern extremity in Stephens County it
consists of approximately 53 percent shale, 35 percent sandstone and conglomerate, and 12 percent
limestone. The overlying strata is the Thrifty Formation, which is approximately 90 feet thick. At
its northern portion, which includes the project area, the Thrifty Formation consists of approximately
25 percent sandstone, 45 percent shale, and 30 percent limestone (Myers 1965:13,27). Limestone
outcrops of the Thrifty Formation occur along drainages south of the City of Breckenridge. Clay
deposits, some of which are suitable for ceramic production, occur in the upper portion of the Thrifty
Formation (Myers 1965:44).
2.2 Climate
The climate in north-central Texas, in general, and Stephens County in particular, is characterized
by hot summers and cool winters. Temperature extremes can occur, as summer temperatures often
range into the 100s, whereas in the winter “blue northers” can bring in occasional snow and extreme
drops in temperatures well below freezing. In winter, the average temperature is 46 degrees F., with
the average daily minimum being 32 degrees F. The lowest temperature on record occurred at
Breckenridge on January 12, 1973, when the temperature fell to -6 degrees F. In summer the average
temperature is 84 degrees F, with daily maximums into the mid-90s. The highest temperature on
record occurred at Breckenridge on June 29, 1980 (one of the hottest summers on record), when the

thermometer hit 111 degrees F (Cyprian 1994:2). Total annual precipitation averages about 26
inches, with approximately 60 percent of this (16 inches) coming during the growing season from
April through September. Rainfall shortages can occur, as about two years out of ten the rainfall is
less than 11 inches. Most of the rainfall comes in the form of thunderstorms. The one-day record for
rainfall accumulation was 15.7 inches at Breckenridge on October 13, 1981 (Cyprian 1994:2).
2.3 Vegetation and Fauna
The project area is located within the Osage Plains section of the Central Lowland physiographic
province. This area is characterized as rolling prairie. Topographic elevations range from 800 to
1450 feet above mean sea level (Brazos River Authority n.d.:2.). Vegetation is predominantly
grassland, except along the riparian habitats and lowlands of the Upper Brazos watershed, where
stands of mesquite, oak, red cedar and bois d'arc were described in historical accounts (McMinn
1986). Records of the vegetation post oak and blackjack oak on the uplands; cedar, live oak, pecan,
walnut, elm, hackberry, cottonwood and willow along the streams; and mesquite in the glades
(Brazos River Authority n.d.). Aboriginal grasses included bluestem (Andropogon sp.), grama
(Bouteloua sp.), wild rye (Elymus sp.), western wheatgrass (Agropyron smithii), switchgrass
(Panicum virgatum), and yellow Indian grass (Sorghastrum nutans) (Brazos River Authority n.d.:10;
Gould 1994).
Important large-game species include white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and, prehistorically,
bison (Bison bison). Important fur-bearing mammals include coyote (Canis latrans), bobcat (Lynx
rufus), red fox (Vulpes fulva), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus
floridanus), California jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), black-tailed prairie dog (Cyonmys
ludovicianus ), eastern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans), and raccoon (Procyon lotor) (Davis 1978;
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, electronic document accessed 12/17/12).
Migratory fowl include wood duck (Axis sponsa), mallard (Anas platyrhunchos), northern pintail (A.
acuta), northern shoveler (A. clypeata), gadwall (A. strepera), American wigeon (A. americana),
canvasback (Aythya valisineria), redhead (A. americana), ring-necked duck (A. collaris), lesser
scaup (A. affinis), bufflehead (Bucephala albeola), common merganser (Mergus merganser), and
ruddy duck (Oxyura jamaicensis). Other important bird species include Scaled quail (Callipepla
squamata), bobwhites (Colinus virginianus), and Rio Grande turkeys (Meleagris gallapavo) (Texas
Parks and Wildlife Department, electronic document accessed 12/17/12).
2.4 Soils in the Project Area
Soils within the project footprint are classified as the Gageby Series (Figure 2.1). These soils consist
of deep, well-drained and moderately permeable soils on level and gently sloping floodplains
(Cyprian 1994:68). Forming in loaming alluvium, these soils are fine-loaming, mixed thermic
Cumulic Haplustolls (Cyprian 1994: 68); in other words, these soils tend to form in floodplains and
alluvial fans where fresh sediments have accumulated slowly and are well integrated into the matrix.
These soils tend to be found within grasslands or widely spaced trees.

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND
3.1 Introduction
The project area falls within the north-central Texas archaeological region (Pertulla 1995).
Archaeological investigations in the region have documented the presence of prehistoric and historic
human populations spanning several thousands of years. A brief summary follows.
3.2 Paleoindian (11,500– 8500 B.P.)
The Paleoindian period, usually considered to be a continental-wide cultural tradition, is thought to
have begun about 11,500 years ago, but evidence for early occupations in Texas is sparse. The
Paleoindian period in Texas is thought to have occurred before about 8,000 B.P. (Lynott 1981;
Ritchie-Parker 2013). This period is characterized by small, mobile populations primarily engaged
in hunting of now-extinct megafauna such as mammoth, mastadon and bison. In north-central Texas,
evidence for the earliest occupation of Native Americans as seen primarily in surface exposures
indicates occupation by mobile, low-density populations consisting of small bands of aggregated
families. These nomadic groups most likely practiced a generalized hunting-and-gathering
subsistence economy (Prikryl 1990). Examples of Paleoindian occupation come from sites such as
the Aubrey Clovis site (a very well-stratified site) at Lake Ray Roberts (Ferring 2001), the Carr site
(Byers 2007), the Field Ranch site in the upper Elm Fork drainage (Jensen 1968), the Lewisville site
(Crook and Harris 1952), and sites around the Lake Lewisville area (Prikryl 1990).
3.3. Archaic Period (8500–1250 B.P.)
The shift from the Paleoindian period to the Archaic period is generally characterized by populations
who were becoming more stable and less mobile, with heavier reliance on hunting of smaller animals
rather than big game. An increase in plant food use, gathering and processing, as well as the use of
stone ovens occurred during this time. A wider variety of stone tools is seen, evidenced by stemmed
or notched projectile points, and ground-stone tools indicative of wild plant food processing in
association with features such as hearths, ovens and middens (Collins 1995; Ritchie-Parker 2013).
The Archiac period is generally divided into three subtraditions; the Early Archaic (8,500–6,000
B.P.), the Middle Archaic (6,000–3,500 B.P .), and the Late Archaic (3,500–1,250 B.P.).
During the Early Archaic, it is believed that these early people continued a nomadic lifeway with no
evidence of territorial boundaries (Prikryl 1990). The population density remained low, with an
economy based on bison hunting, but people began to exploit the bottomlands (Lynott 1981;
Ritchie-Parker 2013). Point types attributed to the Early Archaic stage are surface finds of early
split-stemmed projectile points and Angostura projectile points (Prikryl 1990).
Middle Archaic people continued their nomadic lifestyles, but a shift in population locations
occurred due to intensive exploitation of bottomland resources and an increasing density of sites on
river terraces. This may be the earliest indication of regionalization in the area (Lynott 1981;
Ritchie-Parker 2013). The Middle Archaic roughly correlates with the formerly utilized Carrollton
7

focus of the Trinity aspect, which was defined by Crook and Harris (1952) based on a syntheses of
research from the Elm Fork and the main Trinity River. The Carrollton focus is characterized by
large triangular-bladed dart points with parallel-sided and square-based stems, Waco sinkers,
chipped stone Carrollton ax, some late Paleoindian projectile point types, and the use of nonlocal
flint (Lynott 1981; Peter and McGregor 1988). Artifacts attributed to the Middle Archaic consist of
Carrollton, Morrill, Wells and Trinity projectile points, and Clear Fork gouges (Ferring and Yates
1997, 1998).
The Late Archaic began to see population growth due to seasonal aggregation of groups during more
intensive exploitation of local and bottomland resources. Societies remained egalitarian with small
family groups (Lynott 1981). The Late Archaic correlates with the formerly used Elam focus of the
Trinity aspect (Crook and Harris 1952), and is characterized by decrease in large dart points, increase
in smaller dart points, appearance of stemmed and notched projectile points, and an increased usage
of local quartzite (Lynott 1981). Diagnostic points common to this period include Dallas, Edgewood,
Ellis, Elam, Gary, Godley, Trinity, and Yarbrough. Evidence of Late Archaic occupation is seen at
sites such as Lake Lewisville (Ferring and Yates 1998), Lake Ray Roberts (Ferring and Yates 1997),
Mountain Creek (Peter and McGregor 1988) and River Legacy (Ferring 1994; Ritchie-Parker 2013).
3.4 Late Prehistoric (1250–250 B.P.)
The Late Prehistoric ushered in the beginning of semi-sedentism as well as early evidence for
nonegalitarian society in the region, adoption of bow and arrow, and use of ceramics, cemeteries,
houses and horticulture (Lynott 1981; Ritchie-Parker 2013). Several subdivisons of the Late
Prehistoric have been proposed, based on the temporal distinctions of projectile points and
subsistence practices. In general, these subdivisions see early period Scallorn arrowpoints that grade
into late Alba and Bonhman varieties followed by late Harrell, Washita and Perdiz points.
Subsistence changes included a shift to increased bison hunting during the late phase of the Late
Prehistoric around A.D. 1300–1400 (Lynott 1981; Peter and McGregor 1988; Prikryl 1990). Overall,
in north-central Texas, the Late Prehistoric is geographically isomorphic with the Henrietta phase.
The type site for the Henrietta phase is the Harrell Site, located near the junction of the Salt Fork and
Clear Fork of the Brazos River, in southern Young County. The Late Prehistoric component appears
to represent a southern extension of the Plains Village tradition, in which side-notched arrow points
and bison scapula hoes are diagnostic (Texas Beyond History, electronic document accessed
12/24/12).
3.5 Historic Period (250 B.P.–present)
Prior to major dislocations as a result of intertribal conflicts and conflicts with Euroamericans, the
north-central Texas area was hunting territory for a number of groups, including the Wichita to the
north, Hasinai to the east, Tonkawas and Wacos to the south and the Comanche to the west. During
the late 1830s and early 1840s, remnant groups of Caddos, Wacos and Kichai lived together for a
time along Village Creek, in present-day Tarrant County. It was here in May of 1841 that the villages
of these groups were attacked by General Edward H. Tarrant, commanding the Republic of Texas
militia (Claeys-Shamiri 1989; Ritchie-Parker 2013). In 1854, these tribes were relocated to the
8

Brazos Reserve near Fort Belknap, which had been founded in 1851 in present Young County. The
fort was one of many built to protect the Texas frontier from the Red River south to the Rio Grande.
The presence of the fort resulted in the settlement of the area and establishment of counties, towns
and roads (Texas State Historical Association, electronic document accessed 12/24/12).
In 1854, the town of Picketville was founded. When Stephens County was founded, the name was
changed to Breckenridge and the town became the county seat. Primarily a farming and ranching
community, Breckenridge had 500 inhabitants by 1884, and sported a number of general stores,
religious sects, a school district and a bank. In 1917, oil was discovered in nearby Ranger, part of
the Breckenridge Pool. Drilling in Breckenridge started in 1918 and by 1920, the boom was on as
thousands of workers and speculators poured into the town. In 1920, the population was about 1,500,
but within a year it had exploded to about 30,000. At one time during this boom, there were over 200
wells within the city limits. A railroad soon followed; but after three years the boom was over and
the exodus was on. Although Breckenridge hung on for a few years as an oil distribution center, by
1930 the population had fallen to 7,569. The Great Depression brought the population down to
5,826, which is about its current population size. Today Breckenridge is still a center for
petroleum-related industries and is a retail center for the county (Texas State Historical Association,
electronic document accessed 12/24/12). With Possum Kingdom Lake and Hubbard Creek Reservoir
close by, Breckenridge has seen some economic benefit from the tourism industry.
3.6. Previously Recorded Sites
3.6.1 Historical Markers–Picketville
One of Stephens County's first white settlements, Picketville was founded before the Civil War
(1861–1865) on Gonzales Creek. It is located about one mile north of Breckenridge, and about half
a mile north of the project area. Without military defense during the war, local families gathered here
for protection against hostile Indian attacks.
Differences exist as to how Picketville got its name. According to the Texas State Historical
Association (electronic document accessed 12/24/12), it was named after rancher Bill Pickett.
However, according to the Historical Marker identifying the location of Picketville, the name
probably came from picket construction, in which tree limbs were placed on end and chinked with
mud. Picketville served as the county seat until Breckenridge was settled in 1876. Then the town
began to decline, leaving only a cemetery.
3.6.2 Archaeological Sites
There are only two archaeological sites within approximately 1 kilometer of the project area. Site
41SE307 was recorded in 2009. It is a lithic procurement site located about 1 kilometer north of the
project area.

9

According to the TARL site files, Site 41SE290, a prehistoric site recorded in 1992, is located
approximately 150 meters east of the project area. The site consists of a lithic scatter of flaking
debris and burned rocks. The site has been impacted by plowing and collecting.
4.0 FIELD METHODS
Prior to conducting field investigations, a site records search of TARL's site files was conducted
electronically. Field investigations were conducted on Wednesday, December 12 and Thursday,
December 13, 2012. Field crew consisted of David Greenwald, Jeffery Hanson and Justin
Greenwald. The field plan was to excavate three backhoe trenches approximately 15 meters long in
the proposed location of the final clarifier, just to the south of the WWTP southern fence line. In an
effort to capture the geostratigraphy, the plan was to excavate two trenches oriented north-south, and
one trench oriented east -west. One additional backhoe trench was to be placed within the footprint
of the chlorine contact structure. When in the field, the crew was informed that a portion of the
Breckenridge landfill was somewhere to the south of the WWTP southern fence line and near the
projected location of the final clarifier.
Three backhoe trenches within the area of the proposed final clarifier were excavated at a distance
of approximately 15 meters long, down to a depth of two meters. Two of these trenches were placed
in a north-south direction, and the third was placed in an east-west direction. A fourth backhoe
trench was placed in an east-west direction within the area of the proposed chlorine contact structure.
These trenches and other nearby features were mapped with a Trimble Geo XT, along with existing
utility lines, fences, and other features on the landscape (Figure 4.1).
5.0 RESULTS
5.1 Backhoe Trenches 1, 2 and 3.
The supposition that a portion of the Breckenridge landfill was near the proposed location of the
final clarifier was verified when the excavation of Backhoe Trench (BHT) 1 began. Evidence of
recent trash deposition was encountered throughout the trench from top to bottom, for its entire
length. Datable trash from Backhoe Trench 1 included a portion of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram,
dated “January 1, 1980.” There was also a major league baseball box score from a newspaper that
contained the name “Nettles.” This referred to Craig Nettles, who played in the majors from 1967
to 1988. A Bordens “Lite Line Low Fat Cottage Cheese” container lid was recovered, which
probably dates to sometime after low fat foods were introduced in the 1970s. A “Dr. Pepper”
aluminum can with a pull tab opening and crimped lid was also recovered. These artifacts place the
date of this portion of the landfill during the 1970s and 1980s.
Similar trash debris was encountered in BHTs 2 and 3. BHT 2 was excavated north-south, and was
15 meters long and 2 meters deep. Trash was encountered throughout the trench. Datable items
included a “Budweiser” aluminum beer can with a pull tab opening and crimped lid. Trench 3, which
was oriented east-west, was excavated to approximately 15 meters long and 2 meters deep. It also
contained recent trash throughout.
10

Datable trash included a green glass soda bottle with a “1979" date stamp, a newspaper ad for the
“Ford Pinto,” a “Frito Cheddar Cheese” wrapper with a 1977 copyright, and a portion of a “Virginia
Slims” cigarette wrapper. The results of these three backhoe trenches indicated that this area was
completely disturbed with recent landfill activity.
5.2 Backhoe Trench 4.
Backhoe Trench 4 was placed east of the existing chlorine contact structure, in the location of the
proposed new chlorine contact structure. The east-west trench exposed intact, natural stratigraphy,
which provides the only intact stratigraphy column produced by the current investigations. Ground
surface at this location was 355.5 meters (1166 feet) above mean sea level, evidenced by a nearly
level surface that may represent a pasture or field that has not been under cultivation for
approximately 50 years or longer. This location is on the geologic and active floodplain of Gonzales
Creek, which is immediately west (ca. 100 meters) of the present-day creek channel. The stratigraphy
as exposed in BHT 4 is highly indicative of water-laid deposits through overbank, low-velocity flood
events. BHT 4 was excavated to a safe depth of 160 cm below the present ground surface. Five strata
were identified in horizontal exposure. As mapped by the Soil Survey staff (Cyprian 1994:68),
sediments found at this location have been assigned to the Gageby Series, Gageby clay loam
(occasionally flooded). The stratigraphy found within BHT 4 is similar to that described by Cyprian
(1994:68), yet differs in some elements as described below (Figure 4.2).
Stratum I is represented by a humic zone composed of dark brown (nearly black: 10YR2/1 moist)
clay loam; grass roots are present throughout this stratum, decreasing in density with depth. This
stratum may represent a disturbed “plow zone,” possessing a thick, blocky structure. Sediments are
hard and friable. Unlike most plow zones in similar soils, a clear, smooth boundary was not apparent;
rather, the base (located at approximately 20 cm below the present ground surface) was defined by
the fine texture of the sediments (as opposed to Stratum II). The finer composition of this stratum
is representative of water-laid deposits occurring from slow-to-moderately slow moving water
(similar to standing water). Its organic composition reflects a moist environment that supports the
growth of annual plants that have developed the humic character of the soil.
Stratum II possesses a similar dark brown color (7.5YR3/2) and is a clay loam with pea-sized (and
smaller) pebbles throughout. Stratum II extends from approximately 20 cm to 52 cm below the
present ground surface. Structure is blocky, with some horizontal bedding, a result of alluvial
deposition episodes resulting from overbank events (as opposed to standing water). The horizontal
bedding and coarser (pebble) texture differs from Stratum I, although formation processes appear
to be similar, reflecting materials deposited by slow-moving water within a moist environment.
Stratum II reflects a rich humic character. Collectively, Strata I and II represent a thick A horizon.
Stratum III is a coarse, sandy clay, with pebbles up to pea-size present; some pebbles up to a half
inch in diameter express considerable smoothing from being waterworn, suggesting they have been
redeposited from ancient alluvial deposits upstream. Sediments are a light brown (dark reddish
brown: 5YR3/3) to brown clay loam, blocky and of a granular structure. Calcium carbonate
concretions are present, but probably represent redeposited materials as opposed to carbonates that

have developed in situ. The boundary between Stratum II and Stratum III is a clear, smooth break;
beginning at approximately 52 cm below the present ground surface, Stratum III extends to a depth
of approximately 75 cm, where it is easily separated from Stratum IV by a smooth, clear boundary.
Stratum III represents a B horizon; because of the presence of calcium carbonate, it should probably

13

be classified as a Bw, represented by weak amounts of carbonates, although their presence may
arguably be a result of redeposited materials on a floodplain setting rather than in situ development.
Stratum IV is a dark yellowish brown (10YR4/6) clay loam, of homogenous color, texture, and
structure from its designated top to its interface with Stratum V. Clearly, calcium carbonate nodules
are developing in situ beginning 75 cm below the present ground surface, lending to the lighter color
of this stratum from that of Stratum III. Texturally, Stratum IV is similar to Stratum III and is
probably a continuation of that stratum, but a true Bw. It is blocky, hard and friable. Stratum IV
extends to about 120 cm below the present ground surface, where a gradual boundary is discernible
with Stratum V below.
Stratum V is a light brown (7.5YR4/4) silty clay loam with a homogenous texture and color
throughout; the bottom was not reached in the backhoe trench. Bedded deposits are not represented.
This stratum is massive in structure, cemented by calcium carbonates. Its fine texture similarly
suggests deposition as a result of slow-moving water from which sediments dropped from
suspension in a nonturbid condition. Such deposits are consistent with redeposited materials from
eroded channel walls and canyon edges, where sediments of greater age may have served as source
materials intermixed with sediments that originated from deposits that possessed higher organic
content. The materials are thoroughly mixed. The absence of bedding suggests that the mixing of
these two material sources occurred elsewhere and were well mixed prior to being deposited on the
floodplain of Gonzales Creek.
The depositional environment in which these soils have accumulated–on the active floodplain of
Gonzales Creek–is an unlikely location in which to encounter in situ cultural deposits, other than
perhaps remains associated with expedient and ephemeral activities (a single event or of a very short
duration). Rather, the adjacent terrace of Gonzales Creek, located beyond the project area, would
have provided a more suitable location in which purposeful activities associated with meeting daily
subsistence needs, as established temporary or base camps, or a location in which procurement and
processing activities could be efficiently conducted. Economic resources are available on the first
terrace above the floodplain in the form of cacti and succulents, wood resources, and stone, a
commodity lacking on the floodplain but readily available on the eroded landscape of the first
terrace. Frequent flood events may have scoured the vegetation from the floodplain, leaving grasses
and tree-bearing legumes and nuts that could be easily harvested but would have resulted in few
discernible indications of human use. Therefore, it is unlikely that the area of the chlorine contact
structure possesses deposits associated with prehistoric or historic native activities that reflect
purposeful, recognizable behavior.
6.0 RECOMMENDATIONS
The archaeological investigations conducted by DMG Four Corners Research, Inc., demonstrate that
no significant cultural resources are present within the proposed locations of the final clarifier and
chlorine contact structure at the Breckenridge Wastewater Treatment Plant. Therefore, we
recommend that archaeological clearance be granted so that this project can move forward.
