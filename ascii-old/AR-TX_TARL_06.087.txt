-Abstract
During the Summer and Fall of 1983, the Texas Archeological
Survey, The University of Texas at Austin, conducted excavations at
two sites to be affected by the Lower Colorado River Authority's
surface m1n1ng at Powell Bend in Bastrop County. Under Permit No.
350 issued to the LCRA by the Texas Antiquities Committee, extensive
excavations were carried out on sites 41BP191 (the Shoppa Site) and
41BP192. Excavations of 41BP192 centered on an intact burned rock
feature uncovered during testing.
N.o additional intact cultural
features were discovered; however, amounts of burned rock shatter
indicate the site had been inhabited repeatedly during prehistoric
times. Two time diagnostic dart points, Nolan and Marshall, suggest
occupation of this site from Early Middle Archaic through Late Middle
Archaic times. An experimental hearth, a fire built directly on a
pavement of cobbles, produced burned rock shatter and burned cobbles
with characteristics similar to the prehistoric examples.
the Shoppa Site
incorporated
Excavations at 41BP191
mechanical trenching and hand excavated units with large area scraping
using the front end blade of a backhoe. Hand excavated units centered
on a burned rock feature uncovered during testing. The mechanical
scrapes were used to open l·arge areas, uncovering additional burned
rock features.
A total of twenty-five features were exposed and
mapped. A typology of cultural features is derived from morphological
variations observed among the features.
Two radiocarbon dates and three reliable thermoluminescence dates
indicate a Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric occupation of the site.
Temporally diagnostic projectile points recovered from the Shoppa Site
range from Early Archaic to Late Prehistoric styles.
Rates of
deposition calculated from the radiocarbon and thermoluminescence
dates suggest the intact cultural materials are younger than 3000
years BP. A pre-3000 year BP erosional episode in the Powell Bend
area uplands is proposed to explain tha lack of Middle and Early
Archaic intact cultural remains.
Lignite was used as fuel in two of the hearths uncovered at the
Shoppa Site. A suggested age of 1700 BP for one of these features is
derived from the rate of deposition calculated from a nearby
radiocarbon-dated feature.
The lithic technologies of bifacial
reduction
and
flake
production are identified from the debitage, cores and tools on the
site. The recovered artifacts suggest hunting and lithic reduction
were not primary activities at 41BP191. The features and tools are
more indicative of plant procurement and processing.

INTRODUCTION
Sites 41BP191 (Shoppa) and 41BP192 are located within the
boundaries of the Powell Bend Lignite Mining Prospect under lease to
the Lower Colorado River Authority (Fig. 1). As a prerequisite for
an application to mine lignite, cultural resource investigations were
designed to comply with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966
and
its
implementing
regulations, 36CFR800, and the National
Environmental Policy Act as implemented
by
the
Environmental
Protection Agency. Cultural resource investigation of the Powell Bend
Prospect began with a literature and records search to determine the
cultural resource potential of the Bastrop County area. In late 1981
and extending into 1982 an intensive pedestrian survey was conducted
to locate and record prehistoric and historic sites within the
Prospect. Thirty prehistoric and twenty-two historic sites were
located (Kenmotsu 1982).
Four of the prehistoric sites, including
41BP191 and 41BP192, and one historic site were recommended for
further evaluation by means of subsurface testing. The testing phase
was conducted in the spring of 1982 (Bement, in Kenmotsu ·1982;
Robinson 1983). As a result of the testing program, sites 41BP191 and
41BP192 were recommended for Phase IV mitigation by
extensive
excavation.
These sites were deemed significant based upon the
possibility of buried intact cultural materials which could supply
data
concerning
the
prehistoric exploitation
of the upland
environment.
Under the authority of the Texas Natural Resource Code, Title 9,
Chapter 191, the Antiquities Committee issued permit number 350 to the
Lower Colorado River Authority to conduct Phase IV archeological
investigations at the Powell Bend Prospect. Sites 41BP191 and 41BP192
were determined eligible for nomination to the National Register of
Historic Places in the summer of 1983.
A research design was
presented to the State Historical Preservation Officer and the
Environmental Protection Agency for approval. The research design was
accepted and preparation for field work began.
Background of the Phase IV Studies
The Shoppa Site (41BP191) and 41BP192 are located in the Powell
Bend
Lignite Mining
Prospect in Bastrop County, Texas.
The
environmental background has been fully presented in Kenmotsu (1982).
Only the characteristics of the environment which are pertinent to the
evaluation of 41BP191 and 41BP192 will be summarized here. This area
is
situated
in
the Gulf Coastal Plain (Fenneman 1938) and,
specifically, in the upland region of the Colorado River Basin.
The
terrain is characterized by rolling hills dissected by drainages and

small streams which eventually drain into the Colorado River.
Ground
water is part of the Carrizo-Wilcox aquifer and is incorporated in the
recharge of this system.
The surface geology is the upper division of the lignite-bearing
Wilcox Group. Gravels associated with Uvalde Gravels (Byrd 1971) cap
many of the divides and have been redeposited on the hill slopes and
in the drainage bottoms.
Soils in the Prospect, and specifically those on 41BP191 and
41BP192, are the sandy loams and sa·ndy clays of the Axtell-Tabor
series (Soil Conservation Service 1979).
These soils support the
oak-hickory flora characteristic of the Texas Biotic Province (Blair
1950).
The archeological background of this region has been produced by
the investigations at Camp Swift Military Reservation (Skelton and
Freeman 1979), the Federal Youth Center (Fawcett 1975), the Fayette to
Lytton Springs Transmission Corridor (Brown and Kenmotsu 198D) and the
Fayette Power Project (Skelton 1977). These systematic proJects and
the chronological frameworks compiled by Weir (1976) and Prewitt
(1981) are the foundation for the investigations of the Shoppa Site
and
41BP192.
A more
detailed history of the archeological
investigations in Bastrop County is provided in Kenmotsu (1982).
RESEARCH DESIGN
The testing program at sites 41BP191 and 418P192 revealed that
each contained at least one intact burned rock hearth/oven. The
evidence for intact cultural materials in upland settings held by both
sites provided the impetus for further excavations. Three hypotheses
were constructed to guide the excavation process and the collection of
data.
Hypothesis I
Lithic procurement and reduction as a primary activity at
the site can be demonstrated by the presence of debitage
characteristic of each stage of lithic reduction from tested
cobble to finished tool.
Hypothesis II
Food preparation at the site will be indicated by specific
tool forms and residues characteristic of each task from
procurement to consumption.
Hypothesis III
The patterning of cultural materials will reflect the
activities performed during a specific occupation within a
discrete time period.

INTRODUCTION

Along with the three hypotheses, a set of questions
and
corresponding methods of excavation designed to accumulate data to
answer the questions were developed. These questions include:
1) Are these additional intact cultural materials of synchronic or
diachronic relationship to the already observed feature?
Method: Controlled horizontal and vertical excavation using a set
grid and defined vertical levels.
2) Are these

4) What temporal assignment can be made to the feature?

the feature and collect time diagnostic artifacts in direct
association with the feature.
The orientation of the excavation was toward the burned rock
features uncovered during the testing phase. Previous research in the
Bastrop-Fayette area concentrated on defining lithic technologies.
The Powell Bend excavations projected a study of these upland sites in
terms of a domestic camp situation with the burned rock features
providing a focal point.

41BP192
INTRODUCTION
41BP192 occupies a unique
position
physiographically
and
archeologically.
First recorded by Kenmotsu (1982) during the 1981
survey of the Powell Bend Lignite Prospect, the site's physiographic
location was defined as valley margin because of its intermediate
positioning between an upland divide and a drainage channel.
The
slopes are forested with numerous oak species, junipers, hickories and
mesquite. Vines and short grasses comprise the current understory.
Geologically, this area is part of the Calvert Bluff Formation which
contains sandstones and sands. On the surface of many of the uplands
are deposits of chert and quartzite cobbles known as Uvalde gravels.
These gravels were a primary factor influencing the aboriginal use of
this area. Soils in this area are sandy loams overlying sandy clays.
The surface hydrology in the vicinity of 41BP192 was described by
Kenmotsu (1982:7) who ranked the drainages in their ascending order
from the Colorado River. The Colorado River is thus a first order
stream, Big Sandy Creek is of the second order and the small header
The
stream near 41BP192 is classed as a fourth order stream.
importance of hydrology to this site is its proximity to the header
drainage, only 50 meters to the east. Prewitt (1974:73) argues that
the proximity factor is biased when more than one "unequally valued
resource" is involved. Thus, the choice of site location will favor
proximity to the most valued resource rather than the general
distribution of a number of resources. At 41BP192, the availability
of lithic raw materials provided by the Uvalde gravels was considered
the valued resource at the end of the survey. The nearest currently
exposed gravels are 30 meters east of the site area.
The proximity of the known resources, water and lithic raw
material, combined with the possible presence of an intact burned rock
feature exposed in a shallow rill, prompted the recommendation to test
this site.
Testing of 41BP192, in the spring of 1982 (Bement, in
Kenmotsu 1982), uncovered a fairly intact, flat circular burned rock
hearth/oven.
It was also determined that the site was very shallow
and much of its cultural material, with the exception of the
hearth/oven, had been disturbed by rodent activity. The site's upper
slope boundary was relocated downslope from the perimeter originally
estimated by the surveyors, reducing the area to 2000 square meters.
On the basis of the fairly intact hearth/oven, the site was
recommended for excavation as a mitigative process. The rationale for
this recommendation was that the presence of one intact cultural
feature signals the possibility of other intact cultural materials.
The presence of the intact feature made the site eligible for the
National Register of Historic Places, opening the way for mitigative
procedures through excavation.

TECHNIQUES AND PROCEDURES
Under the authority granted by Antiquities Permit Number 350
issued to the Lower Colorado River Authority by the Texas Antiquities
Committee, excavations at 41BP192 commenced on June 2, 1983.
The
supervising archeologist, Leland C. Bement, directed a very competent
The
crew composed of Deborah Smith, David Robinson and Jeff Turpin.
Principal Investigator and project director was Solveig A. Turpin.
Three days were expended in backhoe testing, followed by a total of 49
1/2 work days spent in manual excavation.
The field season at 41BP192 began with the clearing of trees and
a brush pile along the south and east edges of the site to facilitate
the placement of backhoe trenches around the periphery (Fig.
2).
Before any subsurface was exposed, a metric grid was laid across the
site area (Fig. 3). To tie the current excavation to the testing
stage, the north-south orientation of the test pits was adopted as the
grid orientation. A point 8 meters directly west of the NW corner
stake of Test Pit 1 formed the intersection of the North and the East
base lines. This point was assigned the arbitrary designation of NSOO
ESOO. A datum was established at the grid coordinates N509/E500. All
elevations were taken with a transit positioned over this point.
Excavation began with the placement of five backhoe trenches
around the periphery of the site. The dirt removed from the trenches
was not screened. A watchful eye was kept for any cultural materials
that might be displayed. These trenches were used to confirm the site
boundary and to expose the culture-bearing strata.
As was found
during the testing phase, all cultural material was contained in the
sandy loam A horizon of the Axtell soils.
The trenches served to
define the extent and depth of the Axtell A horizon which deepens
towards the southeast across the site to a maximum depth of 70
centimeters in Trench A. Trench D was the sole exception, exposing a
much sandier soil type consisting of sandy loams in the A and 8
horizons and a very brittle hard packed sand in the C horizon (Fig.
4).

Hand dug 2 by 2 meter units opened the greatest areal extent of
the site.
Dirt was removed from the units with shovels and trowels
and transported by wheelbarrow to the 1/4 inch hardware cloth screens.
The first unit excavated in each section was dug in arbitrary 10
centimeter levels, maintaining a level surface measured from the
highest corner of the pit (usually the NW corner). Each level was
screened and bagged separately and a General Record form filled out
after each level had been removed. After the excavation of the first
unit in each section was completed, it became apparent that cultural
material was dispersed throughout the sandy A horizon. The absence of
discernible vertical stratigraphy justified further excavation in 20
centimeter levels.
Any loss of exactitude in vertical stratigraphy
was compensated for by commensurate increase in horizontal area
exposed.
Therefore, the subsequent pits were excavated in arbitrary
20 centimeter levels until the red sandy clay of the 8 horizon was
reached. All but two units were 2 by 2 meters in size; two were 1 by

2 meters. A total of six such units were excavated in Area A, two
units in Area B and the two 1 by 2 meter units in the zone between
areas A and B.
The culture-bearing A horizon averaged 30 centimeters deep.
No
vertical stratigraphy could be discerned in any of the pits. Mixing
of layers was evident as cultural material was located anywhere from
surface to the contact with the sandy clay B horizon. The agents of
this m1x1ng included gophers, still
active
today,
and
root
disturbance.
Recent bulldozer clearing was obvious and previous
clearing with at least some use of fire was attested to by burned tree
roots and charcoal rich areas. In one unit, a large clay pedestal had
been lifted from the B horizon, probably the result of a bulldozer
pulling a tree root ball to the surface.

POWELL BEND

THE EXCAVATIONS
For ease of reporting, the site has been divided into two
sections:
A and B (Fig. 3). Section A refers to those units placed
around and near the hearth/oven. Section B holds the units situated
at the western end of Trench B.
The excavation was originally
Area A only.

Of
Area A.

Area A
The hearth/oven was first noted exposed in a small erosional rill
during survey of the Powell Bend Prospect. Testing revealed the
feature had been disturbed by that erosional incident (see Fig.
14,
Bement in Kenmotsu 1982:14). In order to avoid the rill, which runs
to the west of the feature, the units to the north, south and east of
the hearth/oven were chosen for excavation and designated Area A.
The twenty four square meters excavated in Area A were
concentrated in the area around the hearth/oven in an attempt to
define features and activities
associated with
the
feature.
Excavation unit N500/E506 uncovered numerous ferruginous sandstone
slabs. These slabs appear to be a natural outcrop of the sandstone
comprising the cap and many substrata of the Calvert Bluff formation.
The sandstone was of various colors including red, orange, yellow,
purple, black and tan.
It could not be determined if any of the
sandstone had been burned. A similar outcropping of sandstone in the
eastern part of the site prompted the excavation of Area B.
Artifact recovery in Area A was very light.
A total of 218
lithic artifacts were recovered, accounting for 59% of the total
lithics from the site.
A comparison of number of artifacts to
excavated square meter can be expressed as a ratio of 9:1 (nine
artifacts for every square meter). This artifact density does not
include burned rocks. The artifact inventory from Area A is comprised
primarily of debitage.
Exceptions are five utilized flakes, one
biface fragment and one dart point (see Artifact Descriptions).
Burned rock recovered from Area A consisted primarily of shatter,
pot lids and medium sized chunks.
In addition to the circular
hearth/oven, one concentration of burned cobbles was located one meter
due north of that feature (Fig. 5). This concentration of three
burned chert cobbles, one burned quartzite cobble and five sandstone
slab fragments appears to be a hearth/oven remnant.
The heat
fracturing of one of the chert cobbles supports an in situ burning and
the intact positioning of this hearth remnant. Due to the absence of
cultural stratigraphy at the site, it is impossible to relate the
hearth remnant to the intact hearth/oven other than to suggest that
the remnant was left when the hearth/oven was constructed, possibly

borrowing rocks from one to use in the other. The dispersal of used
hearth/ovens and subsequent construction of others is evidenced by the
burned rock fragments found scattered across the site with what might
be a midden accumulation in Area B.
Area B
Area B was defined by backhoe Trench B which turned up four
sandstone slabs and a small amount of burned rock. Two 2 by 2 meter
excavation units were placed at the west end of Trench B.
These two
units contained numerous sandstone slabs, slab fragments, burned
chert, burned quartzite, flakes and cores.
The slabs and slab
fragments were lying at various angles from horizontal to vertical and
ranged from singular to piled in appearance. No patterned alignment
or orientation of the rocks was apparent. Burned rock and flakes were
intermingled with the slabs but the variegated color of the sandstone
masked any evidence for their contact with direct heat.
This area of the site has been hand cleared of all trees and
vines, in contrast to the bulldozer clearing of Area A. Hand clearing
of Area B was expected to reduce the disturbance to the A horizon and
increase
the possibility of finding intact cultural materials.
However, due to the processes of bioturbation and root disturbance, no
definable intact features were uncovered.
Area B has a higher artifact per square meter density than Area
A.
Overall, this 25% of the excavation units produced 40% of the
lithic artifacts. These artifacts consist totally of cores, debitage
and three utilized flakes.
The density of burned rock fragments,
disregarding the hearth/oven, is comparable to that of Area A.
The high density of debitage and the disrupted appearance of the
natural sandstone might be indicative of a midden area. However, the
clearing methods previous to the bulldozing for the soil probe near
Area A could be responsible for the Area B accumulation and
appearance. The presence of an occasional uprooted tree in the
thickest portion of recent re-vegetation indicates that bulldozing was
one of the means employed previously for land clearing.
James Gould
(personal communication) confirmed that clearing of this area had been
done in the 1950s by bulldozing and burning.
No artifacts or cultural constructs tie Area A to Area B.
The
only association that can be made is their physical proximity. A
distance of fourteen meters separates the two areas. Two 1 by 2 meter
units were placed between these two areas in an effort to define the
relationship of the different parts of the site.
The zone between A and B has undergone mixing and displacement of
its cultural components. The two units placed in this area produced
artifact densities similar to Area A. Horizontally lying ferruginous
sandstone slabs were uncovered in these units. A low burned rock per
one meter square ratio was found. Area A's ratio is 1:270 grams, Area

41BP192

15

B's is 1:306 grams while the intermediate area has a density of only
1:95 grams. No intact cultural features were uncovered.
A large
bifacial core/chopper was found lying at a slant; evidence for the
disturbed nature of the culture bearing horizon. Of note in this area
of low burned rock density is the occurrence of eight utilized flakes
- equal to the total number of utilized flakes recovered from Areas A
and B.
LITHIC TECHNOLOGY
The culturally modified lithic material from 41BP192 includes
debitage, utilized flakes, bifaces and projectile points. All lithics
recovered from the site were of local material, possibly coming from
as close as 30 meters - the Uvalde gravel deposit to the east of the
site.
Debitage accounts for the greatest number of specimens recovered
from the excavation.
The debitage has been divided into five
categories with the intent that lithic technology and the stages of
that technology present at the site could be defined. The five
categories are: 1) primary flake - presence of 100% cortex on the
dorsal surface;
2) secondary flake - less than 100% cortex yet not
the total absence of cortex; 3) tertiary flake - the total lack of

first stage cobble reduction (see Artifact Descriptions).
Primary cobble reduction is further evidenced by a high number of
large secondary flakes mirroring the characteristics of the flakes
defined by the scars on the cores
(see
Core
Descriptions).
Approximately 60% (n=12) of the secondary flakes are large, core
reduction flakes. One bifacial core, indicative of the bifacial
reduction technology characteristic of Archaic times, was found at
41BP192.
No other technologies are indicated in the

analysis.
Tertiary flakes are the most common flake type found on the site
(69%).
The majority of these are thinning flakes (94%), some are
pressure flakes (6%). This indicates either that the final stages of
tool manufacture (pres~ure flaking) were not conducted at the site, or
that retrieval techniques did not recover the small pressure flakes.
The former is thought to be the most likely as numerous small thinning
flakes of comparable size to pressure flakes were recovered in the
screens.
However, sample size limitations might also account for the
paucity of pressure flakes.

Other technological indicators include presence or absence of
annealing and hard hammer versus soft hammer flake removal ratios.
Both of these analyses are most reliable when a large sample is
available. The materials recovered from 41BP192 can only be viewed in
the terms of these analyses by determining a presence/absence of
either technology.
Hard hammer versus soft hammer differentiates between knapping
using a rock (hard hammer) or an antler billet or wood mallet (soft
hammer). Characteristics produced by both processes were found among
the debitage recovered from 418P192.
Had only debitage characteristic of hard hammer knapping been
found, then the site's lithic use would have been limited to the
procurement of suitable materials with only the initial stages of
cobble/core reduction being accomplished at the site. On the other
hand, had only characteristics of soft hammer reduction been found,
then it could be assumed that initial or primary reduction of lithic
materials had been conducted prior to the transportation of materials
to the site, and that secondary reduction was being done there.
Annealing is the process by which raw lithic material is made
easier to flake by heating the material for a long time at high
temperatures. Both projectile points found at the site appear to be
made of chert that had been heat treated. None of the core fragments
appeared to have been annealed. Sample size of debitage was too small
to reliably determine the extent of heat treatment.
In conclusion, the lithic material
at
418P192
is
that
characteristically produced by Archaic technology. Tool production at
this site is predominantly initial through secondary reduction of raw

41BP192

17

materials.
The paucity of pressure flakes suggests that final
reduction of the tools was not carried out here.
The low overall
yield of debitage from the excavation units suggests that lithic
procurement/reduction was not the primary activity at the site.
Subsistence Procurement/Processing
No faunal or floral remains were uncovered at 41BP192. The only
subsistence task indicators are two projectile points, one biface,
sixteen utilized flakes and one burned rock feature.
The projectile
points are the only evidence of true procurement of subsistence
materials, in this case animal foodstuffs. Both specimens are dart
points and appear to be completed, as opposed to representing a stage
in reduction manufacture. Thus, each specimen is believed to have
functioned as a hafted projectile component.
The biface fragment is not a portion of a projectile point but of
a cutting or scraping implement.
It is too small to suggest the
tool's form or manner of utilization and does not exhibit any use wear
on its small segment of cutting edge.
The sixteen utilized flakes comprise the largest tool class on
the site.
These specimens have been utilized in such a manner as to
create a unifacially beveled edge. This edge pattern is the result of
scraping as opposed to cutting which forms attrition on both surfaces
of an edge. Unfortunately, the dynamics which create the attrition on
the flake's edge also work against the retention of a use wear pattern
identifying the substance processed.
The utilized
flakes
are
considered processing implements.
The burned rock feature is related to a heating or cooking task.
There is no evidence to suggest that the feature is a result of
annealing lithic materials. Its apparent intactness points to use in
a manner corresponding to the configuration of the stones. The
cobbles would serve as a means to keep food materials from direct
contact with coals, if the stones were placed on a bed of coals. The
heat retention of the cobbles could serve to roast thin pieces of meat
or plant parts, seeds, or nuts. The same effect could be obtained by
building the fire directly on the stones and scraping the coals off
before laying out the food to be cooked.

Another possibility is that such a feature

could be a result of heating too many stones, with these being the
left over cobbles, or that the processing was planned but never
performed at this locale. In any event, the burned rock feature is
viewed as representing a stage in food preparation/processing.

ARTIFACT DESCRIPTIONS
Bifacial Core/Chopper (1 specimen)
This specimen is classified as a bifacial core.
It has the
characteristics of the removal of flakes from around its edge in a
bifacial manner. Approximately two-thirds of the edge of this cobble
has been bifacially flaked.
The remaining one-third retains the
cortex, as do both surfaces. Because of the presence of a cortex
covered edge opposed to a bifacial edge, this specimen might be termed
a chopper. A slight battering located along the edge might be
evidence for such a classification, or it could result from platform
preparation.
The core/chopper is made of light brown to gray chert with white
speckles.
This material is commonly found among the cobbles to the
east and west of the site.

EXPERIMENTAL HEARTHS
On July 19th and 20th, David G. Robinson and Leland C.
Bement
conducted experiments concerning the function of large, flat, circular
hearths found at two sites in the Powell Bend Prospect.
The
experiments were designed 1) to test the rock boiling capabilities of
local cobbles; 2) to describe the shatter produced by direct heating
of the cobbles in the fire and dousing the heated stones in water and
3) to determine the effect of fire on the sandy loam around the open
hearth for comparison with the buried hearth.
Hearth Number 1
Hearth Number 1 consisted of fifteen cobbles arranged to form a
circular flat pavement of rock. A pyrometer sensor was laid under the
rocks. A layer of sandy loam, 5 centimeters deep, was then placed on
top of the rocks. The fire was constructed on the sand and maintained
on this surface for an hour and a half, then allowed to burn down to
coals.
At this time the pyrometer registered 125 degrees Fahrenheit.
The coals were allowed to burn in the open air for one hour, then were

reading had been at 150 degrees Fahrenheit for about 30 minutes.
The
experiment was then left overnight and revisited 19 hours after the
coals had been buried.
Vertical cuts were made with a trowel starting at the west edge
of the rock arrangement. The cobbles were left in place and a clean
profile was exposed at the centerline of the hearth (Fig.
6a).
The
profile reveals the effect of fire and coals on the underlying sandy
loam. The sand was scorched and formed a hardened floor that was dry
and friable.
In some areas the sand was reddened. The scorched,
hardened zone continued down to one centimeter above the cobbles.
A
thin layer above the cobbles remained relatively unaffected by the
heat. The cobbles were not visibly altered.
None exhibited pot
lidding _or cracking. Although nearly 22 hours had elapsed since the
fire was ignited, the sand and cobbles under the fire were still
warmer than the surrounding soil.
Hearth Number 2
Thirty-three cobbles, 24 chert, 8 quartzite, and 1 tabular
sandstone, were arranged on a flat sandy loam surface, creating a
circular pavement of stone (Fig.
6b).
A fire was constructed
directly on the hearth stones and burned for thirty minutes. After 25
minutes, a couple of the cobbles began potlidding.
The majority of
the fire was removed from the hearth after 30 minutes to allow easy
access to the heated cobbles for the water boiling experiment.
A five gallon plastic bucket was filled with two gallons of
water.
Cobbles were placed in the water until the water boiled. The
water began boiling after twelve rocks had been submerged.

continuous long-term boil was reached after fifteen rocks had been
used.
At this point, the water temperature was
220 degrees
Fahrenheit.
The boiling would slacken after three minutes at which
time an additional rock would be added and continue the boil for two
to three minutes. Cooled rocks were removed so that after the boiling
point was reached a maximum of ten rocks were in the bucket at one
time.
This process was continued until all thirty-three cobbles had
been used. A continuous boil at 215-220 degrees Fahrenheit was
maintained for 21 minutes. Twenty minutes after boiling ceased, the
water temperature was 160 degrees Fahrenheit.
Nineteen of the thirty-three cobbles (58%) fractured from direct
contact with the fire. The material lost (in the form of potlids and
chunks) weighed 840 grams. This is equivalent to 15,465 calories
which is enough to maintain a boil for approximately 5 minutes.
Additional cobble material was lost during the placement of heated
stones into the water. A total of 160 grams, 130 grams of chert and
30 grams of quartzite, were lost. Although the rock fragments would
still conduct the heat from the rock to the water with little energy
loss, the cobble would be a less likely candidate for reuse.
The
exfoliated lithic material appears to be the result of fracturing due
to the temperature change in the fire or after coming into contact
with the water.
Differential fracturing by material occurred in Test Hearth 2.
The majority of the fire-fractured material was chert (96%), 4% was
quartzite.
The chert
is

and
exfoliated to all shapes and sizes. The quartzite exfoliation is
covered by cortex on the dorsal surface and is concave on the ventral
side.

the chert.

coarse-grained chert.
Two quartzite cobbles are also in this group.
These rocks show no adverse effects from the fire and could probably
be reused a second time.
Two concerns of this experiment were to assess the effect of
water on heated rocks and to test the efficiency of this method of
boiling water. Another important observation was the effect of fire
on the surface beneath the hearth stones. After the fire had been
scraped off the stones and the cobbles removed, the sandy surface was
still damp and could not be differentiated from the surrounding area.
The cobbles absorbed the heat from the fire and protected the ground
surface. None of the scorching, hardening or color change observed in
Test Hearth 1 was evident.
A fourth purpose of Test Hearth 2 was to see if the shatter
obtained when the hot rocks were immersed in the boiling water could
be distinguished from the shatter obtained from directly placing the
fire on the cobbles. The experiment first showed that heated cobbles

41BP192

23

did not explode when placed in water and that, in fact, very little
lithic material was lost. In conclusion, it is not possible to detect
the activity of rock boiling by analyzing the burned rock shatter from
a site.
The form of Experimental Hearth 2, where a fire was placed
directly on a circular pavement of cobbles, closely resembles the
features of 41BP192 and some of the features of 41BP191.
The test
hearth stones were discolored, some stones were fractured and the
surface under the stones was not affected. The excavated hearths from
41BP191
and
41BP192 had the same characteristics, fracturing,
discoloration and unaffected underlying surface.
The Hearth 2 experiment provided a way to derive the number of
hearths represented in the cultural material by the weight of burned
rock shatter collected. Hearth 2 weighed 18.58 kilograms.
Total
shatter from the experiment is 1 kilogram (840 grams fire shatter, 160
grams water shatter). The water shatter is included as it is probably
caused by the fire and not by contact with the water. From this, a
relationship by 1 kilogram shatter to one hearth weighing 18.58
kilograms can be determined, or lkg shatter/18.58kg cobbles.
The shatter recovered from 41BP192 weighs 9.32 kilograms.
This
could represent 9.32 hearths if each hearth weighed 18.58 kilograms.
Feature 1 weighs approximately 32.6 kilograms. Thus, 1.75 kilograms
of shatter should have resulted from this size hearth. The 9.32
kilograms of shatter found at the site would represent approximately
5.3 hearths of Feature 1 size. The forces which disturbed the hearths
at 41BP192 could also have induced subsequent fracturing of the
cobbles.
Thus, the ratio of lkg shatter/18.58kg cobbles should be
viewed as a maximum. A minimum can be calculated if the total amount
of burned rock (shatter and cobbles together) found on a site are
divided by the average total weight of all features found on that
site. A minimum could not be determined for 41BP192 because the large
burned cobbles were not collected and weighed.
SUMMARY, 41BP192
Factors Influencing Site Location
Two factors influencing the placement of 41BP192 are:
1.
2.

proximity to water
proximity to gravel source

Neither factor has priority in site selection. A third factor, the
abundance of acorns or other foodstuffs, is felt to be a relative
constant for the general mining area and, although this might be the
reason the aborigines were in the area, it does not dictate the
placement of the site.

24

POWELL BEND

Site 41BP192 is situated 50 meters north of an intermittent
drainage.
The drainage is incised approximately ten feet into sand
and sandy clays. The bottom of the drainage is covered with chert and
quartzite cobbles originating from the Uvalde gravel deposit on the
surface at the head of the drainage. The drainage curves to the east
approximately 100 meters from the site. Here it is joined by another
This adjoining
small intermittent drainage from the northwest.
waterway is 200 meters north of the site.
Between the site and the confluent drainages to the east is a
deposit of Uvalde gravels. This deposit creates a slight rise in the
landscape before sloping down to the drainages. The gravels cover an
area approximately 20 by 15 meters in size. Some of the cobbles were
prehistorically tested; large primary and secondary flakes and an
occasional
burned cobble
are
present.
This gravel deposit,
approximately 30 meters from the site, probably supplied the cobbles
used at site 41BP192. The next closest known gravel deposit is 150
meters west of the site on the upland c~est.
The site is located on the most level area around the gravels and
the
drainage.
The gravel deposit has probably stabilized the
underlying sands and established a catchment or detainment for
colluvial materials from the west. The cultural materials are located
on this flat area.
Site Interpretation
Excavation exposed one intact hearth/oven surrounded by a high
density of burned rock shatter (Area A) and a second area with a high
density of burned rock shatter (Area B), separated from Area A by a
low density zone. The site contains few tools - 16 utilized flakes, 1
biface fragment and 2 dart points. A Marshall type dart point was
found on the surface near Trench D, suggesting an occupation of the
area during Late Archaic times. An Early Archaic Nolan dart point was
found in the upper level of test pit N502/E510, 2 meters north of the
hearth/oven. Neither time diagnostic can be directly associated with
feature
as
the absence of discrete strata renders such
the
associations unsupportable.
Functionally, Area A was apparently a locus of cooking and food
preparation, as suggested by the hearth/oven. Area B might represent
an activity locale similar to that of Area A, where the feature(s) was
overlooked or is no longer intact.
However, the high density of
debitage in Area B alternatively suggests a chipping station or
midden.
The hearth/oven represents an activity related to cooking or
heating but which resource was exploited can only be hypothesized.
Hester (1973) and Weir (1976) suggest the connection between burned
rock middens and acorn processing. Although 41BP192 does not possess
a true burned rock midden, the site is located in an area that has
supported acorn-producing oak trees for the past 15,000 years (Bryant

41BP192

25

1969:81).
One step in processing acorns is boiling them in water.
Since
the Archaic inhabitants of 41BP192 had no ceramic pots that could be
set in the fire, rock boiling is one alternative.
If this is the
case, Feature 1 could be a hearth built to provide stones for boiling
water. The two experimental hearths (see p. 20 ) were constructed in
an attempt to duplicate the archeological features and to test whether
the submersion of hot cobbles into water produced morphologically
distinc.t shatter that could be discerned from the shatter caused by
direct heating. Hearth 1 consisted of a flat pavement of cobbles
buried under 5 centimeters of sandy loam with a fire built on top of
the sandy loam. Hearth 2 was a flat circular pavement of cobbles laid
on the surface with a fire built directly on the cobbles. Hearth 1
did not exhibit the discoloration or fracturing of cobbles displayed
by the archeological examples, but rather maintained the original
coloration with no signs of heat fracturing.
Hearth 2 cobbles
fractured due to the direct application of heat, and discoloration of
the cortex was noted. The cobbles from Hearth 2 were used in water
boiling.
Fracturing of the cobbles subsequent to immersion in water
was rare. The shatter that was produced did not vary morphologically
from that produced in the fire;
these. rocks may have actually
fractured in the fire and not spalled until submerged in water.
It became very apparent after the first units were excavated that
large portions of the site are extensively mixed. The agents include
root action, rodent activities (in particular the gopher), natural
erosion such as slope wash and mechanical alteration due to land
clearing. Evidence of this disturbance is seen in the excavation
units
where

vertically
rather than
horizontally. A large upturned area of clay in N498/W508 is probably
the result of a bulldozed tree. Fresh and still used gopher tunnels
criss-crossed the majority of Area A. The hearth/oven was exposed by
incipient gullying. Although the damaging effects of these forces on
cultural integrity is apparent, some of these same forces provided for
the preservation (intactness) of the cultural feature. A large root
crossed over the southern half of the hearth/oven, protecting it from
additional gullying and rodent activity. The hearth itself could not
be penetrated by the gophers due to the size and compactness of the
cobbles. The hearth's location - 5 centimeters above the sandy clay discouraged the gophers from tunneling under the feature as they
prefer the sandy loam to the clay.

nor, in particular, around the feature. A temporal framework could
not be constructed for the feature;
only two time diagnostic
projectile points were located at the site and they represent time
periods separated by 1400 years.
41BP192 represents sporadic, short-term occupation by a small
number of individuals, perhaps at widely separate intervals in time.
In terms of site types described in various hunter and gatherer
settlement models, 41BP192 is a satellite camp, used in seasonal
rounds, or a way station, a temporary camp whose use is motivated more
by expediency than any strong attractive resources.
41BP192 is
exceptional among the many such upland localities in that the
occupational residue survived relatively intact.

41BP191, The Shoppa Site

INTRODUCTION
Site 41BP191, the Shoppa Site (Fig. 7), was recorded during the
intensive survey of the proposed Powell Bend Lignite permit boundary
(Kenmotsu 1982). The site was deemed worthy of Phase III testing on
the basis of its size, upland location, and the amount and diversity
of cultural material on its surface.
Bement (in Kenmotsu 1982)
conducted the testing program at 41BP191 and three other sites
reported in the Prospect.
During this testing program an intact
circular rock pavement hearth/oven was uncovered at 41BP191. The
soils in the area are sandy loams and the recovery of intact cultural
features in such a matrix seemed unlikely.
The presence of the
feature and the large amount of lithic material on the site prompted
the submission of 41BP191 for determination of eligibility to the
National Register of Historic Places. During the summer of 1983 such
a determination was made and preparations were begun for Phase IV
excavation of the site.
RESEARCH DESIGN
After the 1982 testing season, it was apparent that the Shoppa
Site had the potential to supply insight into the use of upland areas
by aboriginal populations.
The hearth/oven uncovered in testing
indicated that other cultural materials might be found in the sandy
deposits and that activities other than lithic procurement and
reduction may have taken place at the site. The possibility of
stratigraphic integrity gave rise to questions about intra-site
patterning and organization. A chronological framework was needed as
a backdrop for all the other possibilities.
To address questions concerning intra-site patterning, it was
necessary to open large, contiguous horizontal areas.
Defining
multiple components in a site demands that controlled vertical
excavations be conducted, and all time diagnostic materials be
accurately provenienced. Specific questions addressed at 41BP191 are
presented in hypotheses form in the Research Design section (pp. 4-5)
of this report.

TECHNIQUES AND PROCEDURES
Excavations began on August 8, 1983. A crew of six worked for
six weeks, then a three week extension was granted because of the
numerous intact features uncovered and the large areal extent of the
site. Excavations terminated on October 7, 1983. The site as defined
covered approximately 31,400 square meters; 13,000 square meters were
eliminated from excavation due to deflation, gullying, sinkholes and
disturbances. Approximately 11.3% of the site, 2,076 square meters of
the potential 18,400, was excavated to culturally sterile clay.
Implementation of part of the research design
excavating a
large, contiguous area - necessitated the use of mechanical equipment.
A backhoe was employed to trench the deepest deposits on the site.
The front end bucket on the backhoe was used to expose cultural
materials by removing the sandy soils in thin laminae.
The backhoe
and crew were supplied by the LCRA.
A grid with 2 meter intervals was projected across the entire
site from a base point of N500/W500 near the site center along the
creek bank.
Hand excavated units were designated by the grid
coordinates for the southeast corner.
Scrapes were sequentially
numbered across the site. Due to the large size of the site, six
major excavation areas were assigned alphabetic designators (A-F)
(Fig. 8).
A large area was hand excavated in 2 by 2 meter units around the
hearth/oven
exposed
in
the testing phase to recover exactly
provenienced data. All fill from the hand excavated units and 20%
from the backhoe scrapes were screened through 1/4 inch mesh hardware
cloth.
A running daily journal was kept. All hand units were described
and recorded on the University of Texas General Record Form. Each
level was documented on its own form and black and white photographs
were taken of each level as it was completed. The site was mapped
using a transit and stadia to show the positions of the scrapes, units
and trenches both horizontally and vertically. All notes and forms
are curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, The
University of Texas at Austin.
THE EXCAVATION
The site has been divided into areas A through F for the purposes
of description and intra-site comparisons.
The divisions are a
product of the archeologist's perception of the preserved cultural
material and site condition.

Area A
Area A is centered around Feature 1, the hearth/oven located
during the testing phase (Fig. 9). This area has the largest number
of hand excavated units. A total of 18 2 by 2 meter units were placed
in a checkerboard arrangement around Feature 1 to recover cultural
material useful in defining activities performed at this locale.
Exact proveniences were recorded for in situ materials; floor plans
were drawn for each level. Vertical increments of 20 centimeters were
used due to the lack of natural stratigraphic units. The pedestaling
of in situ materials and exact provenience proved to be of more use
than arbitrary level designations. All fill was screened through 1/4
inch hardware cloth. One additional feature (F-2) was located by hand
excavation.
In addition to the hand units, twelve machine scrapes were placed
Two additional features were located in this manner
in this area.
(F-21, 22). Twenty percent of the backdirt pile from each scrape was
passed through a 1/4 inch screen.
The culture bearing sandy loam in this area averaged a depth of
35 centimeters. The sandy clay below contained no cultural material.
The contact between these two layers is very marked and undulating
with no signs that it had been penetrated by rodents. The sandy loam
has abundant signs of rodent activity. Mixing of the cultural level
was very thorough with the exceptions of the rock pavement features
and the larger burned rocks. Numerous old rodent burrows could be
seen terminating when a rock feature was encountered. No burrows
penetrated Features 1 or 2. Similarly, the large burned cobbles did
not
seem to
be affected by the rodents.
The many burrows
circumventing large cobbles indicate that rodents detour around these
obstructions.
Feature 1 and Feature 2 are less than 2 meters apart, yet there
is no definable ancient surface that ties the two together. Feature 1
is one centimeter higher in elevation than Feature 2.
Figure 10
illustrates the contoured relationship of the in situ artifacts and
burned rock to the features.
The elevation for each specimen is
measured in meters above mean sea level (AMSL). The plot shows an
undulating distribution of materials in some areas and a more even to
level placement in others.
Although the relationship between any two artifacts in this sandy
soil cannot be proven, plotting Area A materials from the hand units
suggests that certain areas have materials on the same or similar
plane.
There is no apparent barrier that could account for the
accumulation of materials in this plane due to downward movement of
once discretely stratified artifacts.

Area B
11).
The
Area B is the westernmost portion of the site (Fig.
site was extended this far west by the present excavations. Three
backhoe trenches were excavated in this area to uncover any buried
cultural material and to plumb the depths of the sandy soil in search
of possible burials. The trenches revealed that cultural materials
continued to the west and that the sandy soil was up to 60 centimeters
deep. One burned rock feature was uncovered (F-3).
Following this initial probing, a series of scrapes using the
front end scoop of the backhoe were placed to the west and upslope of
Feature 3. A total of nine scrapes, averaging 2 by 5 meters in size,
uncovered one additional burned rock feature (F-4). Twenty percent of
the backdirt from each scrape was screened, producing a low density of
cultural
material
and
no diagnostic
artifacts.
One badly
fire-fractured dart point midsection was found on Feature 4.
At this point, 28 scrapes were opened in between and around the
known features. Nine more features were revealed, bringing the total
for Area B to eleven. Cultural material density remained very low.
One possible Granbury arrow point fragment (Fig. 20b) and one broad
bladed, corner notched dart point (Fig. 2li) are the only potentially
diagnostic
artifacts
recovered.
The arrow point is of Late
Prehistoric age and the dart point is reminiscent of Late Archaic
styles.
Compared to the rest of the site, Area 8 had the highest number
of burned rock features but no planned layout such as might be
expected in a contemporaneously occupied camp was apparent.
The
majority of the features tend to be independent of one another.
Computer plots were generated to compare the contoured clay
surface which underlies the culture bearing sands to the contour
surface defined by the features' location and elevation.
A three
dimensional representation of the clay surface is illustrated in
Figure 12. The feature-derived three dimensional representation is
illustrated in Figure 13. Interesting similarities between these two
graphs include a relatively flat area in the center and a raised knob
in the lower left central portion. The feature-derived "surface" has
relatively the same configuration as the underlying clay surface.
Many factors affect this comparison. First, sand deposition on
the clay surface would have to be generally the same across the area
under consideration. The colluvial deposition of the sand would vary
in amount relative to the slope of the underlying surface and the
velocity of sand movement. The time required for sand accretion to
significantly alter
the
previous
surface is also important.
Degradation factors, particularly those such as gullying, which affect
small or specific areas, also play a role in the surface configuration
through time.

The base line question here is: Does the surface defined by the
features resemble the clay surface enough to suggest that the former
is derived from the latter? If this premise is true, the features
would be relatively synchronic, dependent on the rate of surface
change. The period of synchronization would probably be in terms of
hundreds of years which is sufficient only to assign the features to a
cultural tradition; group size and the duration or continuity of
their use of the area remain unknown.
Area C
Area C is bounded on the north by Area A, on the east and west by
small gullies, and on the south by the major unnamed tributary (Fig.
9). Cultural materials were first recovered in this area during the
testing program of 1982 when a denticulated dart point was found in a
Two 1 by 1 meter test pits were

excavated during the testing program, revealing buried cultural
materials in the form of burned rock and debitage.
No backhoe
trenches were placed in this area during testing.
Intensive excavation of Area C began with the placement of an
L-shaped backhoe trench in the southern part. The trench is 1 meter
wide by 5 meter long on one leg and 4 meter long on the other.
The
subsurface components revealed in the trench consisted of a sandy loam
horizon 65 centimeters thick overlying a red-orange sandy clay.
All
cultural material was observed in the sandy loam. Following the
trenching, a series of scrapes were placed in the area north of the
trench.
Ten scrapes averaging 3 by 5 meters uncovered three features
(F-5, 6, 9). An additional 18 scrapes were excavated, bringing the
total to 28. Two more features were uncovered (F-18, 20).
Two of the features are pits (F-5, 19);
one is a continuous
pavement (F-6), one a scatter (F-18) and one a dispersed accumulation
over a pit (F-20). The section on feature descriptions presents the
attributes of each and its classification.
Feature 20 is one of the most informative at the site.
It and
Feature 5 (also from Area C) gave added insight to the aboriginal
exploitation of the environment. The fuel used in both of these
features is lignite (Ho 1984), which is available in the cut bank of
the drainage. The lignite in Feature 20 made it possible to define a
pit under the burned rock accumulation, rarely an opportunity in the
sandy upland context. It appears that lignite is not as susceptible
to the leaching forces which totally obliterate charcoal features.
Area C produced seven dart points, one Clear Fork gouge and a
triangular biface (see Artifact Descriptions). Debitage and utilized
flake densities are high relative to areas A, B, D and E.

Area D
Area D, comprising the north central portion of the site (Fig.
14), has been · severely affected by land clearing, erosion , and
slumpage of the old historic mine shafts which honeycomb
the
subsurface. In large expanses of the area, sheet wash has removed the
sandy loam . Cultural material lies in this deflated context, atop the
clay.
The northern part of Area D has retained up to 20 centimeters
of sandy loam; here the cultural material is very scarce.
Intensive
excavation was limited to those portions which retained some sandy
loam. Initially, ten scrapes were placed to define the northern site
boundary and to acquire material for comparison with the rest of the
site. One feature was identified during this process (F-23).
Two
additional scrapes were placed in suspected high density areas. One
of these led to the discovery of the two largest features on the site,
F-24 and F-25.
Features 24 and 25 are large, continuous pavement, burned rock
concentrations.
Figure 15 illustrates the proximity of these two
features - only 1 meter separates the two.

size. Both are predominantly composed of fire-fractured chert cobbles
stacked two rocks high. Excavations around these features produced
little cultural material.
Area E
Area E is located directly south of Area D and is bounded on the
south by the unnamed tributary (Fig. 14). This area was trenched
during the testing program. This trenching revealed deep sands, down
to 1.25 meters below the surface. Five backhoe scrapes were placed in
this area during the intensive excavations but almost no cultural
material was noted.
The positioning of these scrapes was such that
the configuration of the zone with deep sands was defined.
A rather
abrupt drop, which is interpreted as the bank of an old drainage
channel, was noted. This channel once curved into the site 30 meters
from the present tributary bank.
The general lack of cultural material in the deep sands suggests
that the old drainage bank was not filled with sand at the time(s) the
site was occupied. It seems highly doubtful that aboriginal groups
would camp in the active drainage of such a tributary. The origin of
the sand which filled the channel is unknown. Some sand undoubtedly
was washed from the bank directly upslope. However, if this occurred
after the site was occupied, cultural material should have been
redeposited as well. Low velocity/energy downslope washing might be
able to sort and transport only sand-sized particles, leaving behind
the larger cultural material.
As the channel migrated to a new
location, sand transported from farther up the drainage would be
deposited in the old channel scars.
Area F
Area Fis the easternmost segment of the site. It is bordered on
the south by the unnamed tributary and on the east by a major gully to
the tributary (Fig. 16). This area is part of the site as originally
described by Kenmotsu (1982). Cultural material was exposed on the
surface and in the tributary cutbank.
Extensive trenching was
conducted during the testing program and a high density of cultural
material was noted at that time. Intensive excavation began with the
placement of two scrapes which uncovered two possible features. Six
additional scrapes and three 2 by 2 meter hand-excavated units
confirmed one of these features (F-7), and uncovered a second feature
(F-8).

Charcoal concentrations defined a pit outline
under
both
features.
Additional features lacking charcoal are suspected but due
to the abundance of mixed burned rock, no specific concentrations or
patterns could be defined. Area F has the highest artifact density on
the site.
Artifacts include arrow points, dart points, biface
fragments and ground stone accompanied by large amounts of debitage.

of these materials.)
The largest number of Late Prehistoric artifacts came from this
area. Arrow points include two Alba, two Scallorn bases, one possible
Perdiz, one Granbury and one Clif"tan. A drill also came from this
area.
These materials are mixed with Archaic age artifacts such as
Marshall, Montell, Lange and Travis dart points.
The very disturbed and mixed nature of the cultural materials
prompted the adoption of an excavation plan centered on the collection
of data needed for intra-site comparison and temporal identification
rather than broad areal exposure attempting to associate artifacts and
features. Only one feature, Feature 7, held sufficient charcoal for a
radiocarbon assay.
This sample (TX-4953) dated to 1690 + 80 BP. No
faunal material was observed, and the only floral material was the
charcoal.
THE FEATURES
A total of twenty-five features were defined at 41BP191. All are
hearths or rock ovens.
Table 2 presents the various attributes of
each feature and its morphological classification. The three lithic
materials used are chert, quartzite and ferruginous mudstone. The
chert and quartzite cobbles are available from the Uvalde Gravel
deposits located on and upslope from the site. Redeposited cobbles
are also present in the bottom of the creek. The ferruginous mudstone
is readily obtainable from the creek banks where it has been exposed
by the downcutting of the drainage channel.
Feature 1
This feature was uncovered during the testing phase (Bement, in
Kenmotsu 1982).
It is a large, flat, continuous pavement of burned
rock approximately 1.5 meters in diameter. The hearth is 2 to 3 rocks
thick
and appears to rest on a flat surface approximately 5
centimeters above the clay. No charcoal was found in or around this
feature.
Feature 2
This feature is located in Area A approximately 1.8 meters west
of Feature 1. It is comprised of large cobbles concentrated in a 1 by
0.8 meter rectangle. The rocks are not piled on top of each other.
Very little heat fracturing is seen on the cobbles in this feature.
No charcoal or diagnostic artifacts were found in or around this
accumulation.

Feature 3
This feature was located during the excavation of a backhoe
trench in Area B. Its eastern quarter was destroyed by the trench.
The feature is a slightly dispersed circular arrangement of burned
cobbles stacked 1 to 2 rocks deep. Overall, it is 1 meter in diameter
and appears to lie on a flat surface 5 centimeters above the clay. No
charcoal or diagnostic artifacts were in or around this feature.
Feature 4
This feature is located in Area B. It is a dispersed arrangement
of burned cobbles encompassing an area 1 by 1.1 meter. An unusual
channel bisects the western quarter of the feature. This channel cuts
slightly into the clay and has a broad, curved bottom approximately 15
centimeters wide and visible for 2.2 meters.
Burned rock from the
feature was transported upslope leading to the conclusion that the

midsection of a long, narrow dart point was found in this feature. No
charcoal was uncovered.
Feature 5
This feature is a pit 0.4 meters in diameter and 14 centimeters
deep, located in Area C. Blackened earth marked the pit which extends
8 centimeters into the clay. The bottom is discolored and hardened
from the heat.
Small chunks of what looked like charcoal were
collected for 14C dating. This sample turned out to be lignite.
A
few burned rock chunks were around the mouth and inside the pit. The
distal half of a Pedernales type dart point was found nearby.
The
base
of this projectile was located in a scrape in Area C,
approximately 25 meters north.
Feature 6
This feature is an oblong shaped, flat, continuous pavement
hearth 1.6 meters long by 1.1 meter wide, in Area C. It is comprised
of small burned rock chunks piled two rocks deep.
The distal
two-thirds of a triangular dart point was found on the feature. A
large chunk of charcoal was collected from between two rocks near the
center of the hearth. This feature appears to lie on a flat surface 5
centimeters above the clay.
Feature 7
This feature, located in Area F, is a pit approximately .6 meters
in diameter and 14 centimeters deep.
The pit was filled with
charcoal, charcoal stained earth and small fire-fractured rocks.
The
pit extends three centimeters into the clay. The mouth of the pit was

noted

Feature 8
This feature is located in Area F approximately 3.5 meters north
of Feature 7.
It is a pit .7 meters in diameter and 10 centimeters
deep. The pit extends into the wall of the excavation unit so only
the southern half was exposed and profiled. A few large burned rocks
were noted in the pit fill, along with charcoal and charcoal stained
earth. The pit does not extend into the clay.
Feature 9
This feature is located in Area B. It is a dispersed hearth 1
meter in diameter.
The feature appears to lie on a flat surface,
approximately 6 centimeters above the clay.
The rock concentration
has a void or vacant area in its center. The absence of burned rock
fn this area suggests the presence of a pit.
No outline could be
detected. No charcoal was present in or around this feature.
Feature 10
This feature is 2 meters south of Feature 9 in Area B. It is a
dispersed hearth with a central base spot suggestive of a pit mouth.
However, ~o pit outline could be identified. No charcoal was found in
or around this feature. The rock concentration is .8 by .5 meters and
rests on a nearly flat surface 8 centimeters above the clay.
Feature 11
This feature is in Area B approximately 2 meters southeast of
Feature 10.
Many of the burned rocks comprising this feature were
removed during scraping with the backhoe.
The remaining cobbles
outline a dispersed hearth 1.1 meters in diameter and about 17
centimeters above the clay. There is no evidence of a pit and no
charcoal was found in or around the feature.
Feature 12
This feature is 4 meters east of Feature 11 in Area B.
Burned
rock is concentrated in a circular, lightly dispersed pavement 1 meter
in diameter. The stones are one rock thick and are on a relatively
flat 11 surface 11 16 centimeters above the clay. The center portion of
the hearth is marked by numerous gopher tunnels.
No charcoal was
found in or around this feature.

41BP19-1

Feature 13
This feature is located in Area B approximately 8 meters west of
Feature 11.
A circular concentration of burned rock, .8 meters in
diameter and one rock thick, lies approximately 5 centimeters above
the clay. The center of the feature dips, giving the hearth a slight
basin shape. No pit outline could be discerned, although the dipping
of the center cobbles suggests one may once have underlain the burned
rock. No charcoal or tools were found in or around this feature.
Feature 14
This feature is located in Area B approximately 8 meters south of
Feature 11. It is a small concentration of burned rock. The cobbles
form a circular, dispersed pavement with a diameter of .55 meters.
The pavement is one rock thick. The cobbles lie on a flat surface
approximately 15 centimeters above the clay.
This feature is the
smallest in the "dispersed rock" category.
No charcoal or pit
indications could be found in or around the rock concentration.
Feature 15
This feature is located 12 meters southeast of Feature 14. It is
a very dispersed accumulation of burned rock cobbles, approximately 1
meter in diameter.
The cobbles do not lend themselves to any
definable configuration.
This feature has been heavily disturbed by
bioturbation and backhoe
excavation.
The
burned
rock
lies
approximately 15 centimeters above the clay.
No charcoal or pit
features were observed in or around this feature.
Feature 16
This feature, measuring 2.5 by 1.7 meters, is located 10 meters
east of Feature 14 in Area B. It is a dispersed accumulation of
burned cobbles with a roughly elongated configuration, lying on a
surface 11 centimeters above the clay.
No charcoal or pit is
associated with this feature. The feature was uncovered by backhoe
scraping.
Although
no direct association with other cultural
materials could be shown, a dart point fragment was recovered by the
screening of the scrape back dirt.
Feature 17
This feature is located in Area B approximately 4 meters east of
Feature 14.
It consists of a large, oblongr lightly dispersed
concentration of angular burned rocks bordering the north edge of a
pit. The pit is oblong, 1.17 by .8 meters, with a flat bottom. It is
a minimum of 8 centimeters deep. The surface of the pit was removed
by the backhoe, but is thought to correspond to the level of the

48

POWELL BEND

burned rock. The pit.was identified by the presence of dark stained
sandy soil, with a distinct boundary in the surrounding sandy loam.
The sides are vertical, adjoining the bottom at nearly 90 degree
angles.
Pit depth is postulated to be 10 centimeters. The burned
rock is 2.1 meters long and 1.1 meter wide. The cobbles are two deep.
Some rocks were displaced by the backhoe;
the majority of the
concentration, however, extended into the scrape wall. No charcoal or
diagnostic materials were found.
Feature 18
This feature is located in Area C.
It is
a dispersed
accumulation of burned rock 2 by 1.9 meters. The feature is badly
disturbed with burned rock fragments varying in distance above clay
from 3 to 25 centimeters.
The larger cobbles, thought to be most
resilient to disturbance, are located at 19 centimeters above the
clay.
Most of this disturbance can be readily attributed to rodent
burrowing.
This feature does not have the vertical integrity or the
horizontal configuration shown by most of the features. It is defined
on the basis of density of burned rock as compared to the surrounding
areas which have less burned rock and very few large cobbles. No
charcoal or diagnostic materials were found in or around this feature.
Feature 19
This feature is located in Area C approximately 16 meters
northwest of Feature 18. It is a pit with a few burned rock fragments
and unburned rocks located in the pit fill. The pit is .9 meters in
diameter and a minimum of 15 centimeters deep. The top of the pit was
removed by the backhoe. No burned rock concentration is associated
with this feature. The pit fill is slightly darker in color than the
surrounding sandy loam.
No charcoal flecks or ash
could
be
identified.
The pit walls are vertical and join the flat bottom at
approximately 90 degree angles. The pit bottom is approximately 10
centimeters above the clay.
Feature 20
This feature is located in Area C approximately 2 meters
northeast of Feature 5. It consists of a dispersed accumulation of
burned rock 1.46 by 1.4 meters encircling the mouth of a pit .5 meters
in diameter and 18 centimeters deep. The majority of the burned rock
is located along the south and east edges of the pit. The south edge
has a high concentration of ferruginous sandstone fragments. The
burned rock lies on a flat surface approximately 5 centimeters above
the clay.
The pit extends 8 centimeters into the clay. The pit was
filled with dark stained sandy soil with lumps of lignite. The walls
slope gently to a rounded bottom, and are easily identified due to the

41BP191

49

dark staining of the fill. The bottom and the pit walls in the clay
show heat discoloration and the clay is hard and friable. A utilized
flake was recovered from the edge of the feature.
A dart point
fragment similar to the Bulverde type was uncovered to the north of
the feature, but no direct association could be determined.
Feature 21
This feature is located in Area A approximately 25 meters
northeast of Feature 1.
It is a dispersed accumulation of burned
rock, circular in configuration, with a tail of burned rock extending
.75 meters to the north.
The main concentration is 1 meter in
diameter. The rocks lie on a relatively flat surface 25 centimeters
above the clay. No charcoal or diagnostic artifacts were found.
Feature 22
This feature is located 3 meters east of Feature 21.
It is a
badly dispersed accumulation of burned rock, with no apparent
horizontal cohesiveness. Vertically, however, the cobbles tend to lie
on a flat surface 25 centimeters above the clay. This feature is very
close to the surface and has probably been disturbed by land clearing
along with the ever-present bioturbation.
No charcoal, pit, or
artifacts were found in association with this feature.
Feature 23
This feature is located in Area 0.
It is a burned rock
concentration 2 meters in diameter. The cobbles form two clusters
with many dispersed cobbles between and around the clusters. There is
no definite horizontal configuration. The cobbles are on a surface
that slants from north to south. The burned rocks at the north edge
are 15 centimeters above the clay and at the south edge are 5
centimeters above the clay. No charcoal or pit was uncovered.
Feature 24
This feature is located in Area D approximately 16 meters north
of Feature 23. It is a large, circular, continuous pavement of burned
rocks. The concentration is 2.7 meters in diameter and one to two
rocks thick. The feature lies on a plane approximately 14 centimeters
above the clay. A small erosional channel transects the feature in a
northeast to southwest direction.
The channel is approximately 20
centimeters wide and did not cut through the feature. However, it did
deposit fine grained sand, clay and pebbles on the burned rock
surface. An iron ring and a few pieces of glass were also deposited
in this channel. Thus the channel can be attributed to the historic
era. A large biface was lying on the feature and a biface tip was
uncovered on the edge of the erosion channel.
No charcoal or

50

POWELL BEND

associated pit was uncovered.
Feature 25
This feature is located in Area D, 1 meter southwest of Feature
24.
It is an oblong-shaped continuous pavement concentration of
burned rock. The pavement is 4 by 3.1 meters and two rocks thick.
Two areas of main concentration are divided by an area of slightly
dispersed burned rock one cobble thick.
The western edge of the
concentration has been disturbed by a substantial gully 50 centimeters
deep. The gully has just begun cutting into the feature, strewing
some of the cobbles downslope. A biface fragment was found on the
feature. No charcoal or diagnostic artifacts were uncovered.
Burned Rock
Aside from the burned cobbles compr1s1ng the features, a scatter
of burned cobbles and shatter was found in all areas of the site. The
highest density occurred in Area F with 583.2g/exc.sq.m.
These
figures are based solely on the burned rock shatter collected during
screening and do not include cobbles. The burned rock shatter was
collected and weighed without the larger cobbles to compare shatter
from the site with the amount produced by the experimental hearths.
A total of 95.87 kilograms of burned rock shatter was collected.
The average feature weight is 40.46 kilograms and the shatter
recovered from the experimental hearth is 1 kilogram.· The shatter
from an average size hearth would be twice that of the experimental
hearth, which weighed only 18 kilograms. The burned rock from the
site is sufficient to create either two features, or be the shatter
from 48 hearths. Most of the burned rock is chert;
very little
quartzite and almost no mudstone are contained in the sample.
The significance of the amount of burned rock can be stated in
two forms. First, the presence of burned rock and shatter distributed
across the site indicates that feature construction,
use
and
destruction has occurred over time in all areas of the site - with the
exception of Area E. Second, that the presence of intact features in
the same area as dense burned rock scatter represents the sequential
use of the area and that cobbles used in later features could have
been
acquired
from earlier hearths, thus contributing to the
scattering of hearth remains.
One of the purposes of the experimental hearth was to produce a
method by which the number of features could be calculated from the
quantity of burned rock shatter.
The amount produced by
the
experimental hearth is presented as the base quantity. Since the
weight of the experimental hearth is half that of the average feature
on 41BP191, the weight of the shatter from the experimental hearth is
doubled. From this, the weight of shatter from an average size
feature of 40 kilograms is 2 kilograms. The total weight of burned

41BP191

51

shatter from 41BP191 is 95.78 kilograms.
The number of features
represented by 95.78 kilograms is derived by dividing 95.78 kilograms,
by 2 kilograms (the amount of shatter from one average hearth).
This
process predicts that 48 medium size hearths are represented in the
burned rock shatter recovered during excavations. The total site area
presented in this calculation is only 505 square meters of the total
36,400 square meters covered by the site (505 is the total number of
screened excavated square meters). If the ratio of 48 features per
505 square meters is projected across the site, the possible feature
total numbers unrealistically in the thousands.
A minimum number can be calculated if the burned shatter is
viewed as the result of a hearth completely destroyed. Thus, the
95.78 kilograms total of burned shatter for 505 square meters is
divided by 40 kilograms (the average hearth weight) and a ratio of
2.39 hearths per 505 square meters is obtained. This ratio projected
across the site predicts a total of 172 features on the site through
time. This total is viewed as a minimum. Somewhere between 172 and
3459 hearths are represented by the burned rock on 41BP191, a range of
little utility in reconstructing the use-history of the site.
Feature Classifications
The twenty-five features identified at the Shoppa site have been
divided into five types based on their morphology: 1) continuous
pavement, 2) dispersed, 3) dense scatter, 4) pit, and 5) dispersed
with pit. Each of the five types is described below.
TYPE I - Continuous Pavement - Features 1, 6, 24, 25.
These features are a continuous pavement of burned rock, one to
three rocks thick. The shape ranges from oval to round. In profile
these features appear to be constructed on a flat surface.
Pits are
not evident.
This category accounts for the largest features on the
site, with an average diameter of 2.3 meters (Fig. 17a,b).
TYPE II - Dispersed - Features 2,3,9,10,11,12,13,14,21
This category is comprised of features that are accumulations of
burned rock. The,accumulations vary in cohesiveness from well formed
and roughly circular to irregular and dispersed. No pits were found
around or under the features; however, the shape of a few suggests
the presence of a pit. Feature 10 is a good example of this where the
burned rock encircles a small barren area, forming a doughnut-shaped
feature. Cross sectioning and profiling did not expose any pit-like
structure.
The more dispersed accumulations probably represent
destroyed or dismantled features (Fig. 17c,d).

TYPE III - Dense Scatter - Features 4, 15, 16, 18, 22, 23
These dense burned rock scatters lack consistent horizontal
configuration and vary in degrees of vertical integrity. For the most
part, the large cobbles in the features lie on a relatively constant
plane while the smaller burned fragments have been displaced upward
and downward in the sandy loam matrix.
The agents of displacement
include
land clearing, bioturbation and, in particular, gopher
tunneling. These features may be dispersed hearth materials or
general refuse accumulated on a living surface (Fig. 17e,f).
TYPE IV - Pit - Features 5, 7, 8, 19
These features are little more than circular pits, averaging 60
centimeters in diameter and 25 centimeters in depth (Fig. 18a,b).
Little burned rock is associated with this feature type and is limited
to small heat fractured chunks found in the pit fill.
TYPE V - Dispersed with Pit - Features 17, 20
Two features are burned rock accumulations encircling a pit (Fig.
18c,d). Feature 20, the better example, is 1.4 meters in diameter. A
pit, 0.5 meters in diameter and 18 centimeters deep, is located in the
center of the rock accumulation (Fig. 19). The burned rock encircled
the "mouth" of the pit.
The classification of these features is purely morphological.
The forces which altered these materials cannot be fully identified,
nor their effects known. Function can only be inferred from the
Similarly, relationships between features
morphological categories.
on the Shoppa site cannot be determined by morphological means, but
only suggested.
The large, flat, continuous pavement hearths of Type I are
morphologically distinct. The structural attributes of this category
do not overlap with attributes of other categories.
The other four
classes have at least one structural attribute in common with another
category. From this a broad, systematic relationship between the four
types can be proposed.
The hearth construction begins with the excavation of a small pit
(Type IV) approximately 50 centimeters in diameter and 25 centimeters
deep. A fire is built in the pit and allowed to burn down to a
desired level.
Then, whatever material is to be cooked is placed on
the coals and a layer of cobbles is arranged over the top of the pit.
When the appropriate time has elapsed, the rocks are removed from the
mouth of the pit, the foodstuff removed, and the hearth abandoned

constructed it or another group coming onto the site.

construction would be the same but instead of collecting fresh
cobbles, the rocks from the abandoned feature are used.

removed, the abandoned hearth is only a pit with a few rocks or rock
pieces around or in it (Type IV). The stones of the second hearth,
when abandoned, may be reused or left undisturbed.
However many times the cycle of reuse or hearth building is
conducted, eventually the site is abandoned long enough for cultural
remains to be buried by natural colluvial action. From the instant of
abandonment, each hearth is affected by physical and chemical forces
which serve either to preserve or destroy it in part or whole.
The various morphological types of features on 41BP191 are
probably a function of the preservation process.
The dispersed
hearths, in particular the doughnut-shaped ones, probably represent
abandoned hearths which once encircled the mouth of a pit. The pit,
however, is no longer detectable due to the leaching of the charcoal
into the sandy soil and the subsurface repositioning of the sands by
gopher activity.
Those features with definable pits, such as F-7 and F-8, probably
reflect the most recent use of the site. Feature 5 is a pit with few
associated rocks. Its stones may have been scavenged for use on
another hearth.
The pit outline was maintained by the lignite which
was used as fuel instead of wood. The lignite was not obliterated by
leaching as charcoal would have been. The presence of a feature with
cobbles surrounding the mouth of a definable pit was fortuitous.
Feature 20 is one such example. Again, the pit was detectable because
lignite was used as a fuel. The cobbles surrounding the mouth of the
pit were not disturbed by later use of the site. Unfortunately, fine
screening and flotation of pit fill recovered no floral or faunal
remains which could identify the presumable foodstuffs.
The large, flat, continuous pavement features do not readily
conform to this construction and use, suggesting a totally different
function. The large amount of burned rock comprising these features
is suggestive of midden buildup. If a large amount of cooking was
conducted in a short period of time in a particular area, the constant
reuse of a hearth day after day could result in the discarding of
broken and unsuitable cobbles. The relationship of Features 1 and 2
might represent a continuously used feature or features in which the
cobbles used to cover the pit were sorted into reusable (F-2) and
unusable (F-1) categories.
The pit would be cleaned out and reused
and, unless lignite was burned, the abandoned pit would not be
discernible when the charcoal leached.
Feature Typology
The classification of the twenty-five features is based on the
morphological characteristics of compactness of cluster and the
presence or absence of a pit. The types are derived from variations
of these two factors as they were observed in the field. Cluster
(Dixon and Brown 1977) and discriminant analyses (Nie and others 1975)
were applied to a list of variables in an attempt to verify the

57

41BP191

original classification by statistical
features on the basis of other criteria.

means

or

to

the

Table 2 presents the attributes by which each feature was
measured.
Six cluster analyses and three discriminant analyses were
performed. The highest correlation between the field typology and a
computer grouping was attained by a three step discriminant analysis.
The computer grouped 69.9% of the features in accord with the field
classification on the basis of feature weight, feature size and the
number -0f mudstones. The field classification group with the highest
correlation with statistical groupings is Type I. The members of Type
I consistently grouped during discriminant analysis. Similarly, Type
IV members remained together during discriminant analysis.
The members of the other types (II, III, and V) are shuffled
between the classes with various degrees of correlation depending on
the variable under consideration. One striking oddity throughout this
process is Feature 13.
Feature 13 is placed in the Type II
classification by the field analysis.
Five of the six cluster
analyses place Feature 13 in either the last amalgamation or in the
last three amalgamations. The three discriminant analyses place this
feature in Type IV or Type V. Only in the cluster analysis, where
density is the sole variable, is Feature 13 grouped with another
feature from Type II.
Based on the cluster and discriminant analyses, the major
criteria for grouping the features are size, weight and density. The
ratios of the different lithic classes in each feature are not
significant. The statistical divisions represented in the cluster and
discriminant analyses do not consider the absence or presence of a pit
significant.
It is at this point that the field typology diverges
from the statistical typologies. The field typology relies heavily on
the presence or absence of a pit to further refine it above that of
pure statistical groupings.
The statistical inquiries have been
useful
in
defining
the
attributes
which support the field
classification and in highlighting the gross nonconformities to that
system.

Expedient tools are pieces of debitage, probably selected from
the scatter on the ground, used without modification or shaping. The
wear or fracturing along the edge of such tools is the result of use
and not of preparation. When the task was finished, or the flake was
no longer useful, it was once again discarded.
Thus the utilized
flakes were used for a particular task for a short period of time.
Due to its brief use, it is unlikely that specific use wear
characteristics will have been developed on the tool's edge. Only the
grossest determination of tool use was possible by the microscopic
analysis of the utilized flakes from 41BP191 - a scraping or cutting
motion.

120
100%

72

POWELL BEND

A scraping motion leaves a unifacial fracturing pattern on one
surface of the flake.
A face or bevelled edge on one surface is
produced by this motion. Cutting, on the other hand, applies force
more evenly on both surfaces of a flake edge, causing chipping on both
the ventral and dorsal surfaces. Use wear fracture patterns indicated
that 63.3% of the utilized flakes were used in a scraping manner,
17.5% in a cutting fashion and 19.2% were indeterminate.
Hig~ magnification microscopic analysis failed to detect any wear
patterns indicating the material on which the tools were used. The
short term use of these tools and the high rate of edge material
fracturing
inhibited
the
development of polish or striations
characteristic of use on certain materials.

Gross flake size measurements were taken for all the utilized
flakes to see if there was any preference for large or small flakes.
The criteria for flake size was the same used in the debitage.
Large
secondary flakes had to be over 5 centimeters in any dimension and
large tertiary flakes had to be over 3.8 centimeters in any dimension.
All large flakes were combined as were all small flakes and chips.
The results are as shown in Table 3. Large flakes comprise 23.3% of
the total utilized flakes and small flakes are 76.7%. This does not
suggest any preference for large flakes and may be interpreted as the
converse, a preference for small flakes.
The total number of large flakes and the percentage of those
large flakes which are utilized compared to the same information on
small flakes changes the perspective. Large flakes comprise 7.9% of
the debitage.
Of this 7.9%, 18.8% are utilized.
Small flakes
comprise 92.1% of the debitage and only 1.7% of that are utilized.
Therefore, it seems that there was a preference for the larger flakes.
However, the intentional production of large flakes for use as
expedient tools does not seem likely.

SITE INTERPRETATION, 41BP191
The overall site picture is one of heavily concentrated cultural
material near the eastern boundary (Area F) and a lesser density of
cultural materials across the rest of the site.
Five factors have
been chosen for the basis of intra-site comparisons. These are:
1. Features per excavated square meter
2. Tools per excavated square meter
3. · Utilized flakes per excavated square meter
4. Cores per excavated square meter
5. Flakes per excavated square meter
Figure 27 presents these factors in bar graph form for each of the six
site areas.
Before all five factors could be plotted on the same graph, the
ratios of both features and flakes had to be decimally altered. For
the actual features per excavated square meter, the graphed amount
should be multiplied by 0.1.
Thus for Area A, the feature per
excavated square meter is 0.012 rather than 0.12. The correct ratio
for flakes can be determined by multiplying the graph representation
by 100. Flakes in Area A are actually 23 per excavated square meter.
In comparing the graphs of the six areas, it ·is readily apparent that
Area Eis practically devoid of cultural material whereas that·of Area

in the case of the feature factor. For this factor, 100% of hand
units, 100% of scrapes and 100% of trenches were used, since features

The first factor is the ratio of features to excavated square
Ranked from highest density to lowest, the areas are: Area
meters.
B, D, A, F, C and E. With the exclusion of Area E, the feature
density across the site varies little.
The category of tools shows a marked difference across the site.
Ranked from highest density to lowest, the areas are: F, C, A, D, B,
E. Area F has almost twice the tool density of all the other areas
combined.
This supremacy is also illustrated in the density of
utilized flakes. Here again Area F has almost twice the density of
all the other areas combined.
Cores are more prevalent in Area C followed by F, A, D, Band E.
Flakes put Area F back at the top of the list followed by C, A, D, B
and E. Flakes comprise the total cultural material class from Area E.
As expected, flakes are the most numerous, and thus the densest,
material across the site. The relationship of cores to flakes varies,
with a strikingly low density of cores in Area F. Meaningful analysis
of these relationships, however, is precluded by the site condition
and the inability of the soil type to maintain definable depositional
strata, which make it impossible to establish associations between
artifact assemblages in any given area. This is perhaps the greatest
limitation of 41BP191 for contributing to the specific questions of
lithic technology (Hypothesis I) and the identification of specific
use loci (Hypothesis III).
For those materials which have time
diagnostic attributes (projectile points) or capabilities (hearths,
i.e. radiocarbon or thermoluminescence), comparisons within a general
However, even for these materials,
time frame can be presented.
specific associations and intra-site relationships cannot be defined
with any amount of certainty.
The most general statements drawn from
the
analysis
of
non-diagnostic materials have, at their core, the problem of lumping
materials from different time-periods, and creating a technology or
association that has no foundation in the real world. Therefore, the
analysis of lithic material, primarily debitage, is
by
basic
classification into broad, descriptive categories.
Hypothesis I of the research design states:
Lithic procurement and reduction as a primary activity at
41BP191 can be demonstrated by the presence of debitage
characteristic of each stage of lithic reduction from tested
cobble to finished tool.
In a very general sense, flakes representative of all stages of
lithic reduction are present, and are distributed across the sit~ with
the exception of Area E. Area E, however, is not considered part of
the inhabited area of the site (see Area E description). The presence

41BP191

83

of primary flakes indicates that initial cobble testing and reduction
were taking place. Then, flake size decreases to very small tertiary
flakes, indicative of final tool shaping and resharpening. Within the
collected flakes is evidence of three flaking techniques; hard hammer
percussion, soft hammer percussion and pressure flaking.
As these
categories are only meaningful in a presence/absence form, no attempt
was made to quantify each type.
In general, the cores at 41BP191 represent two major lithic
technologies:
bifacial reduction and flake production. Bifacial
reduction begins with a cobble and, by the removal of flakes from both
surfaces of an edge, reduces the cobble to a desired tool form. The
flakes are a residue of the process and any usage of the flakes
usually in the form of expedient tools - is considered a by-product.
Core types I, II, V and VII represent different stages or points along
a continuum from tested cobble to complete decorticate biface. Core
types III and VI represent a lithic technology designed for the
production of flakes. The flakes are then transformed into tools and
the core is discarded.
Table 4 provides the breakdown of core types by site area.
All
areas are dominated by the bifacial core technology. The flake
production technology is best represented in Area 0.
Again, such
comparisons have little meaning without a temporal framework.
Finished tool forms characteristic of both lithic technologies
are present at 41BP191.
The categories of thick bifaces, thin
bifaces, dart points and gouges extend the continuum developed by the
bifacial cores to the final tool forms. The arrow points and unifaces
complete the sequence for the flake production technology.
All the
lithic materials associated with these two technologies are locally
available chert types.
In general, without regard to temporal distinctions, the lithic
materials recovered from 418Pl91 support Hypothesis I. Supportive
materials include the analyzed debitage, the cores and tool forms.
Not only is the general procurement and reduction sequence represented
but also the specific sequences for the bifacial reduction technology
and the flake production technology.
The categories of utilized flakes and total tools are included in
the bar graphs to illustrate their relationships across the site.
These two categories are most meaningful in the discussion of
Hypothesis II, which states:
Activities related to food preparation will be exhibited by
the presence of specific tool forms and residues related to
each particular task from procurement to consumption.
The total tools bar graph represents the density of all complete
and fragmented bifaces and unifaces excluding utilized flakes. Table
6 presents the general classes of tools by the area of the site.

Considering the size of the excavation (2076 square meters),
conventional
tools representing any category of procurement or
processing are sparse. The addition of tool fragments does not alter
this perception.
The comparatively high number of projectile points
is misleading because within this category is represented a history of
site use from Early Archaic to Late Prehistoric times.
The highest frequency of tools is in the utilized flake category.
Although the identity of the material or materials processed by these
tools cannot be determined, the overwhelmingly high number of these
tools is significant.
Again, the lack of time controls renders
anything but the most broad generalizations concerning this tool type
unsupportive.
Utilized flakes are viewed as a processing tool, used
on either plant or animal material. It can not be determined whether
the flakes were used in preparing food for consumption or in preparing
tools - straightening shafts or removing bark, for example - for the
procurement of food. In comparisons across the site, utilized flake
densities are always higher than conventional tool densities.
Thus,
no particular section of the site is exempt from the processing of
materials with utilized flakes.
Hypothesis II can neither be supported or disproved on the basis
of cultural material recovered from 41BP191. The lack of floral and
faunal material combined with a very small tool inventory precludes
any consideration of the Hypothesis.
Hypothesis III is perhaps the most important premise to be tested
at 41BP191:
The patterning of cultural materials will reflect the
activities performed during a specific occupation within a
discrete time period.
The focal point of this problem is the features.
Area B has the
highest density of features in the site. A higher percent of Area B
was excavated and thus a greater number of features were uncovered. A
corollary to this is that more actual cultural bearing strata were
screened than in any other area of the site.
With the single
exception of the unoccupied Area E, Area B yielded the highest density
of features and the lowest density of tools, utilized flakes, cores
and flakes.
In fact, the most prevalent artifacts are cores, and
these are predominantly cores related to the bifacial reduction
technology.

86

POWELL BEND

In the initial stages of site analysis, it was thought that the
high number of utilized flakes found across the site were used to
prepare food and that these should cluster around the features, viewed
as the final step in food preparation - cooking. This premise does
not hold true for Area B. The features seem to be isolated from all
other activities, with the possible exception of tool production.
The broad area excavation of Area A was designed to supply data
concerning the identification of activities performed around a hearth
(Feature 1). This attempt was thwarted by the inability to directly
associate materials to the feature and the lack of temporally discrete
strata. One grouping of tools (four biface fragments and one dart
point) occurred five meters southwest of the feature. At seven meters
to the southwest of the feature, two more dart points were uncovered.
This would seem to suggest a definable grouping of tools in one
section and the feature in another. However, the three dart points
represent different time periods. They include a Marshall-like, Late
Middle Archaic, a Travis type, Early Middle Archaic, and a Tortugas
Baird type, Early Archaic.
One pattern which tends to hold true across the site is the
absence of cultural materials in the immediate vicinity of the
features. This is true even of the two very large flat continuous
pavement hearths of Area D. The areas around Feature 7 in Area F and
Feature 6 in Area C are exceptions but the presence of cultural
materials in this sphere can be attributed to the high density of
artifacts from various time periods.
Chronology of the Shoppa Site
A generalized chronology of the Shoppa Site can be derived from
fossil index markers and thermoluminescence, and radiocarbon dating.
Fossil index markers for Central Texas are defined projectile point
types.
These types are assigned to a specific time range based on
their stratigraphic association with radiocarbon dated materials.
Then when similar artifacts are uncovered at another site, the
specimens are classified according to the 11 typed 11 projectiles, and, in
so doing, assume the temporal distinction assigned to that type. The
Central Texas Region has perhaps the best defined projectile point
temporal
classification
in Texas.
This classification is the
Figure
framework used for the analysis of the Shoppa Site materials.
28 presents the projectile point types identified, the number of each
type and its age.
The oldest projectile point type recovered from Shoppa is the
Baird dart point. It represents a time period from 5000 to 4600 years
before present (BP).
Following this, the Shoppa Site yielded
projectile points similar to those Central Texas types characteristic
of phases up to and including the Twin Sisters, which
ended
approximately 1400 years ago (Prewitt 1981:75). The following phase
(Driftwood) is not represented at the site.
However, the last two
phases (Austin and Toyah) are present. The Toyah Phase ended 250

Two radiocarbon dates were obtained from two separate features.
Feature 6, located in Area C, is a Type I hearth. A single chunk of
charcoal was located on the surface of the feature between two large
cobbles.
This sample was small and thus has a large sigma. The
uncorrected date is 900 + 220 years BP. Feature 7 is a Type IV hearth
located in Area F.
The sample was a large amount of charcoal
collected from the pit interior. This sample dates to 1690 ! 80 years
BP (Table 7).

*This is a linear relationship based on the range of water content
over the period of age in question.

In addition to projectile points and radiocarbon dating, the
Shoppa Site hearthstones were submitted for thermoluminescence dating.
Chert, quartzite and mudstone samples were collected from each feature
with the exception of pits where cobbles were not present. The
quartzite samples were submitted as they seemed ~he most likely to
produce a date (Stipp 1983). One quartzite cobble from Feature 11 was
processed and rendered an unacceptable date of 27,000 years BP (Alpha
888).
A mudstone sample was processed (Alpha 913) and yielded a date
range from 1660 ! 160 to 1860 !180 years BP. The range is based on
the water saturation of the sample and the possible water content
through time. The two extremes have a linear relationship and, if the
moisture content was known for this region through time, a more exact
date could be postulated.
The success of the mudstone in yielding a date led to the
submission of three additional mudstone samples. Of the three, one
(Alpha 928) obtained a confident date, one (Alpha 927) a less
confident date and one (Alpha 929) an unreliable date, once again
corresponding closely to 26,000 years BP.
Table 7 lists the date
ranges and the features dated by thermoluminescence.
- By combining the results of the three dating processes, a fairly
continuous use of the site for the past 5000 years is presented. One
of the more striking characteristics is the clustering of the

89

41BP191

radiometric and thermoluminescent ages in the latter half of this
occupation. Logically, the latest occupational features would remain
more intact. The quantity of burned rock shatter can be explained by
post-depositional destruction of features constructed during the
earlier occupation.
Rates of Deposition/Aggradation
The question of the relationship of the features to post
depositional processes led to the calculation of rates of deposition
based on the depth of sediments accumulated above the dated features.
By this reconstructing of a past living surface, the age of nearby
features could be broadly estimated by reversing the equation.
Four of the five dated features supplied the stratigraphic
information from which rates of deposition/aggradation could be
computed. Feature 7 is omitted from the following calculations
because the surface of the pit was removed by the backhoe scrape.
Table 8 presents this information for Features 6, 9, 11, and 13.
All
but Feature 6 are located in Area B.

The rates of deposition are figured for each of the four features
by dividing the distance below the surface of each feature by the
number of years before present (BP) acquired from radiocarbon or
thermoluminescence dating. A range of rates were calculated for each
feature based on the mean date acquired by radiocarbon and a m1n1mum
and maximum based on the one sigma value attached to the date. For
thermoluminescence samples the maximum, minimum and mean were figured
by the overall range defined by the dating process based on the
content of water in the sample.
The results of this calculation
show a mean
rate
of
deposition/aggradation
of 0.029 centimeters per year.
In this
calculation, years before present are used to concur with the method
of reporting the radiocarbon and thermoluminescence dates.
The
deposition rate by year BP will differ slightly from calendric years.
Three of the four features contributing to the calculation of
rates of deposition are in Area Band thus the rates are most reliable
for that area. The depositional rates for other areas of the site

90

POWELL BEND

might be similar but known disturbances include extensive historic use
of Areas 0 and F. The present deflated condition of Area 0 precludes
the projection of deposition rate beyond this area. The calculation
of a relative chronology for Area B materials is possible from the
known rates of deposition defined by Features 9, 11 and 13.
Figure 29 presents the estimated time period for each of the
features in Area B based on the rate of deposition. Each time
designation is given as a range with the upper boundary calculated
from the greatest deposition rate of 0.033 centimeters, the mid-point
by the mean deposition rate of 0.029 centimeters, and the lowest
boundary by the lowest deposition rate of .026 centimeters.
The features tend to cluster into two time periods. Features 14,
15 and 17 group into a time span from 1265 BP to 1654 BP. This group
corresponds to the upper time period defined by thermoluminescence of
Features 9 and 13. Features 10, 12 and 16 overlap in a time span from
818 to 1259 years BP. This range includes the thermoluminescence span
defined by Feature 11 as 830 BP to 1010 BP. Features 3 and 4 are not
included in the above two groupings. Feature 3 overlaps both groups
and Feature 4 is much later than either group.
The time ranges based on deposition rate were also figured on
Features 1, 2, 21 and 22 of Area A and Feature 20 of Area C (Fig.
30). As previously noted, the projection of the rates of deposition
from Area B across the rest of the site can only approximate a time
span. The actual deposition rates may be different for these areas.
Features 1 and 2 correlate with the time span of Feature 4 and thus
represent the latest hearths on the site.
Features 21 and 22
correspond to the ranges of Features 10, 12 and 16. Feature 20
relates to the dates from Features 9 and 13, becoming one of the
earliest datable hearths on the site.
Based on the rates of deposition derived from Features 6, 9, 11
and 13 the time span of the other features were calculated. The
results can be grouped into three temporal ranges.
Group I falls
within the time span of the Twin Sisters Phase of the Central Texas
chronology as defined by Prewitt (1981:75). Included are Features 7,
9, 13, 14, 15, 17 and 20. Group II is included in the Austin Phase of
Prewitt 1 s chronology. This group clusters in the early part of this
phase. Included are Features 6, 10, 11, 12, 16, 21 and 22. Group III
is also included in the Austin Phase but represents the later half.
Included in this group are Features l, 2 and 4.
Those dated features all fall into time periods no older than
2250 years BP. The projectile points represent time periods as old as
5000 years BP. From this it seems that the intact features on the
site are the remains of the later part of the site's use. The immense
scatter of burned rock across the site may be the remains of features
from the earlier habitations.

The obtained dates all correspond to time diagnostic projectile
points if the site is considered as a whole. If taken by individual
area (A - F) only Area B has a projectile that matches a hearth dated
by thermoluminescence.
Due to the limited availability of datable
materials, the site will be considered as a whole.
If the deposition rates as determined from the one radiocarbon
date and the three thermoluminescence dates are accurate, then an
explanation for the lack of intact cultural materials (hearths)
previous to 2500 years BP can be postulated. The maximum depth of
sandy A horizon soil in Area B is 77 centimeters. Given the range of
rates of deposition from 0.026 cm/yr to 0.033 cm/yr, this amount of
sand would have accumulated over the past 2962 years maximum or 2333
years m1n1mum.
If depositional rates were constant during the last
2962 years, then accumulation began on the surface of the clay 3000
years ago.
Such a state could only result from a degradating environment
which stripped or reduced the sandy A horizon, consequently deflating
the cultural materials deposited earlier than 3000 years BP. With the
resumption of deposition post-3000 years BP, the older, deflated
materials would be mixed and redeposited downslope. The shift in the
stream channel, as evidenced in Area C, may coincide with the period
of deflation. The old channel scars in the creek bottom are currently
1 meter higher than the present channel. This, too, could be the
result of increased stream velocity due to denuding of the watershed's
slopes during an episode of intense erosion.
This possible pre-3000 BP erosion episode is currently only
suggested.
No evidence of such a widespread erosional event shows in
the pollen record from bogs in nearby Lee County (Bryant, personal
communication), implying either a local effect or one of such short
duration that it did not significantly affect the regional pollen
record. However, such an event provides a logical explanation for the
disruption of the early materials at 41BP191.
This hypothetical
erosion should be a topic explored in any additional archeological
excavations in the Camp Swift Military Reservation or possibly in the
planned investigations at Cummins Creek.
The Aboriginal Use of Lignite
The investigations at the Shoppa site have brought additional
insight into the knowledge prehistoric peoples possessed of their
environment. Two features (F-5 and F-20) located in Area C contained
lignite, a fuel known to be used by the Indians of Texas at only one
other site, the Lewisville Site in Denton County.
During the excavation of Area C, these two features were
identified partially on the basis of a dark black/brown stain
outlining a pit structure. Samples of the stained sandy soil and
small chunks of the black substance were collected as charcoal samples
for radiocarbon assay. Flotation of the stained soils readily raised

41BP191

93

susp1c1on that the black material was not organic. The sample was
slightly moist and when placed in water sank immediately to the
bottom. Charcoal of similar wetness (as that from Feature 7) remained
buoyant. A sample of the black chunks from Feature 20 were submitted
to the Mineral Studies Laboratory of the Bureau of Economic Geology,
The University of Texas at Austin.
Analysis of this sample showed 13.3% moisture, 25.7% volatile
matter, 30.6% fixed carbon and 30.9% ash. The high volatile matter
and ash content fall within the range typical of lignite (Ho 1984).
Further corroboration of this came from the radiocarbon Laboratory at
The University of Texas at Austin.
During processing, the samples
were immersed in hydrochloric acid to dissolve impurities. The sample
turned the usually clear HCl bath into a brown, mudlike suspension.
No assay was performed.
Lignite as a fuel source has been identified at the Lewisville
Site, 41DN72, in North Central Texas (Burton, personal communication
1984). Features at this site were associated with a Paleoindian
occupation and a controversy arose when assay of samples from these
features dated to radiocarbon age 40,000 years.
The samples, first
thought to be charcoal, have recently been identified as lignite.
Since 41BP191 is located in an area known to contain lignite, as
evidenced by mining in the early 1900's and the present plans for
surface mining, it is not surprising that it would have been exposed
in the deeply entrenched drainages near the site. More significant is
that at some time during the occupation of 41BP191, a prehistoric
group either knew or discovered that this dark brown substance could
be used as fue 1.
Two hypotheses can be generated:
I.

A Native American group had previous knowledge of the
fuel
capacity of
the
lignite, and, when they
encountered exposed lignite, collected it for use in
the hearth.

II.

The Native Americans had no previous knowledge of
lignite as a fuel but when the dark brown clumps were
discovered, they were deemed burnable based on its
woodlike characteristics.

The first hypothesis can be tested through the survey and
excavation of sites located within identified lignite bearing areas.
Figure 30 illustrates some of the major lignite and bituminous bearing
regions in Texas. If other sites contain features bearing lignite as
a fuel, then the possible widespread knowledge of this use could be
shown. If, on the other hand, no additional sites with lignite fueled
hearths are uncovered, then the lignite at the Shoppa and Lewisville
sites resull from isolated experiments. At present, however, the use
of lignite in two hearths at the Shoppa site adds yet another insight
into the Native American's utilization of the natural resources of the

SUMMARY
Six relatively standard archeological techniques, three adopted
for field excavations and three for the analysis phase, demonstrated
their merit in the excavations of 41BP191 and 41BP192.
First,
mechanical stripping of sediments to expose features was highly
efficient and can be conducted with few adverse effects.
Far more
area could be opened, revealing the intra-site patterning, than could
have been accomplished by hand excavation. Secondly, the recording of
exact horizontal and vertical provenience, regardless of the arbitrary
levels used in excavation, was extremely useful in evaluating factors
affecting the current condition of the site. This was particularly
effective at 41BP191. Here the sandy soils did not maintain an
identifiable stratigraphic record but the burned rock features were
relatively unaffected by post-depositional disturbances and apparently
successfully withstood some erosional strain. Accurate locational
data permitted a projection of past living surfaces and
site
patterning. A third approach, the contour mapping of both the current
ground surface and the basal clay, was essential to the later
calculation of rates of aggradation and degradation. Analytical
techniques included the radiocarbon assay of charcoal from two
features, an opportunity rarely afforded in these sandy soils.
Thermoluminescence dating of hearth stones was successful in three out
five samples.
The age ranges provided by radiometric and
of
luminescent assay provided the basis for a calculation of rates of
deposition.
Once a hypothetical living surface could be projected,
features on that surface could be presumed roughly contemporaneous.
The three analytical techniques were directed toward the establishment
of a cultural chronology for the site's occupation.
Without this
chronological framework, the interpretation of artifact and feature
function would have little meaning at such a multi-component site.
The excavations at the Shoppa Site transported 2076 square meters
of culture bearing soils, of which SOS square meters were screened.
Twenty-five features were defined and investigated. All features are
related to cooking/heating activities, but morphological variations
have been used to construct a feature typology.
At present, these
various types have no functional implications other than their obvious
use in cooking or heating.
Type I is characterized by a large, circular continuous pavement
of burned cobbles lying on a flat surface. Type II features are
circular flat clusters of burned cobbles with a void in the center,
suggesting the mouth of a pit.
The pit, however, could not be
identified. Type III is similar to Type II except that the clusters
are loosely compacted to dispersed, with no pit mouth indicated. Type
IV features are pits with little or no burned rock in or around them.
The burned rock is usually small, fractured chunks. The pits are
shallow with straight sides and flat bottoms.
Type V hearths are
circular clusters of burned cobbles with an associated pit. The

96

POWELL BEND

Shoppa Site is the first upland site in this area to supply evidence
for the use of a pit in conjunction with a cluster of cobbles. The
evidence for this pit/cobble cluster association comes from two
features; F-17 and F-20.
Feature 20 provided additional insights into the aboriginal
exploitation of the Powell Bend Prospect area when the material
contained in the pit was identified as lignite rather than charcoal.
Lignite was subsequently found in Feature 5 - a pit two meters south
of Feature 20.
Two distinct lithic technologies are represented in the debitage
recovered from the site.
Bifacial reduction is the major lithic
technology. Cores and flakes represent all stages of this technology
from cobble testing to finished biface. The second lithic technology
is geared to the production of flakes.
Debitage representative of
this process is also strewn across the entire site. Again, all stages
of tool manufacture using this technique, from cobble preparation to
tools made on flakes including arrow points, were uncovered.
Tools representing the processing of foodstuffs were identified.
Included are utilized flakes and gouges used in plant material
collection and processing. Amano and metate indicate the grinding of
nuts or seeds.
Animal procurement and processing activities are
sparsely represented by dart and arrow points and two unifaces. Their
relationships with each other or with other materials cannot be
demonstrated due to the lack of definable living surfaces. Similarly,
specific activity areas were rendered illusive by vertical and
horizontal displacement of materials through the action of rodents and
other forms of bioturbation.
The large number of hearths and their random placement suggests
that the Shoppa Site was a desirable living area for small groups or
family units periodically throughout the past 5000 years.
If the
repeated use is based on seasonal hunting or harvesting, this
scheduling could not be determined from the excavated materials.
The
presence of oak and hickory trees for the past fifteen thousand years
has been shown by pollen tests of nearby peat bogs (Bryant 1969), but
no direct evidence implies that acorns or hickory nuts were being
processed at the site.
The chronology of the Shoppa site is based on three techniques;
radiocarbon dating, thermoluminescence, and projectile point typology.
Two radiocarbon dates were obtained from charcoal recovered from two
hearths. One dated to 1690 + 80 BP and the other to 900 + 220 BP. In
addition, three thermoluminescent samples were dated, -providing a
range of hearth use from 1890 + 350 to 920 + 90 BP. Time diagnostic
projectile points included eight-arrow points-of Late Prehistoric age
and nineteen dart points representing the range from Early to Late
Archaic periods.

The vertical provenience and dates obtained by radiocarbon assay
and thermoluminescence for four features provided the data necessary
for calculating rates of deposition. These rates range from 0.033
cm/yr to 0.026 cm/yr with a mean of 0.029 cm/yr. Using these three
rates and reversing the calculation, approximate ages were obtained
for undated features.
The features tend to cluster in three time
spans. The earliest is of Late Archaic age followed by early and late
components of the Late Prehistoric.
The current soil depth of the western part of the site represents
a maximum time interval of 3000 years accumulating at a rate of 0.025
cm/yr. This, combined with the features grouping in Late Archaic
times
or younger, suggests that the older cultural materials
represented by Middle and Early Archaic dart point types, have been
displaced.
One hypothesis which explains the absence of intact
pre-3000 year material is the occurence of a period of heavy,
destructive erosion before 3000 years ago. Additional evidence for
such an event is the change in stream channel location defined in Area
E deposition and more visibly in the jump of the channel observed
downstream in the drainage bottom. The erosion may be limited to the
local area rather than of regional extent. Although no evidence for
regional degradation has been produced in paleo-environmental studies
carried out in the immediate vicinity of Powell Bend, this period may
be one marked by aridity followed by increased moisture (Gunn
1983:64-65). However, at present any such incident must be considered
as localized, produced by an areally restricted event such as brush
fire which temporarily denuded the site area. Additional studies
planned in Bastrop, Fayette and adjacent counties should consider
testing this proposed erosional model.

REGIONAL COMPARISONS
41BP191 and 41BP192 do not stand alone as site types in the
uplands of the Colorado River Basin. North of Powell Bend, on the
Camp Swift Military Reservation, five sites with burned rock features
were identified (Skelton and Freeman 1979:15).
These are sites
41BP100, 41BP111, 41BP105, 41BP118 and 41BP121.
The only time
diagnostic projectile points uncovered were a Montell point from
41BP121 and a Marshall point from 41BP118.
All but 41BP105 were
tested.
The burned rock features were not completely excavated so
there is no data pertaining to hearth configuration or composition.
The Camp Swift Project never progressed to the mitigation phase.
Also in Bastrop County, site 41BP176 was recorded (Kenmotsu and
Freeman 1980:24) and tested in 1980 (Brown and Kenmotsu 1980:6-22). A
burned rock feature was partially uncovered at a depth of 130
centimeters below the surface. A maximum width of 62 centimeters was
exposed; the length of the f·eature could not be determined as the
hearth continued into the wall of the excavation unit. No diagnostic
materials were recovered in the unit at this level.
A Fresno arrow
point was uncovered in another test unit 30 centimeters below the
surface. A black and white photograph of the exposed portion of the
feature illustrates a roughly circular accumulation of cobbles similar
to Type II features at the Shoppa site.
Intensively excavated sites comparable to the Shoppa site were
reported by Skelton (1977) who conducted excavations at the Fayette
Power Project in Fayette County, approximately 30 miles southeast of
the Powell Bend Prospect.
Six prehistoric sites, all located in
upland areas near Cedar Creek,
were
subjected
to
intensive
excavations.
Two· of these sites, 41FY67 and 41FY78 (Baca Site)
resemble the Shoppa Site and 41BP192.
Both sites contained intact
burned rock features.
At the Baca Site, seven burned rock "hearths" and four 11 sha11 ow
pits" were identified during the excavations. The burned rock hearths
are characterized by a cluster of burned rock lying on a flat surface.
The configurations are roughly circular and the clusters range from
loosely compacted to compact.
The lithology of the features is
dominated by chert cobbles; however, quartzite and sandstone are also
present.
Hearth diameters range from
30 centimeters
to
60
centimeters.
The four "shallow pits" are tharacterized by an oval to
oblong shape ranging from 35 centimeters to 55 centimeters in diameter
and 8 to 11 centimeters in depth. Fire fractured rock is found in and
scattered around these features.

100

POWELL BEND

The burned rock hearths are similar to Type II features and the
shallow pits are comparable to Type IV features at the Shoppa site. A
wide variety of projectile points were recovered from the Baca site.
These include Granbury, Scallorn, Perdiz, Darl, Ensor, Fairland,
Gower, Castroville, Pedernales, Marshall, Williams, Yarbrough and
Angostura.
Each category is represented by a small number of
specimens, another trait similar to the Shoppa Site.
The excavations at 41FY67 exposed three burned rock clusters of
sufficient compactness to be classified as hearths. Two features
actually contain two concentrations of burned rock each.
Time
diagnostic projectile points found on 41FY67 include one each of
Scallorn,
Ensor,
Marshall,
Pedernales,
Bulverde,
and
one
unidentifiablelanceolate.
Skelton interprets these two sites as the result of reuse of a
campsite by a small group whose main activity was the procurement and
reduction of lithic materials. Additional activities include hunting
as indicated by the high occurrence of broken projectile points and foraging activities. The burned rock features are viewed as
heating/cooking structures and possibly related to the annealing
process in which lithic materials are structurally altered by heating
(Skelton 1977:82).
Skelton also attributes importance to hunting of the uplands.
Certainly
41FY74
the
Cedar Bridge Site
represents the
establishment of a camp by the successful kill of a bison (Skelton
1977:54). Intra-site analysis revealed that specific task areas could
be defined. The tasks involved meat and hide processing/butchering,
lithic reduction, and cooking.
A total of twenty-eight projectile
points, all arrow points, were recovered. The one hearth identified
is described as:
Chert materials were arranged in a compact circular pattern
with a mean diameter of 57.5 centimeters and a depth of 9
centimeters. A sha1low basin was evident in a sandy matrix,
near the center of the hearth. (Skelton 1977:43).
The description is very similar to that of Feature 13 from the Shoppa
site.
Unfortunately, Feature 13 lacked the faunal material necessary
to extend the similarities.
Tool kits could not be identified within the bounds of the
various occupational features at the Cedar Bridge Site, nor could
specific function of various tool forms be determined. Of particular
interest
is
the
occurrence
of
over
250 retouched flakes.
Unfortunately, these were distributed across the entire site.
The
high number of utilized or retouched flakes is seen on all of these
upland sites. Utilized flakes are often the _best represented tool
class on these sites. The Baca site, 41FY67, 41BP192 and the Shoppa
site contained 1038, 69, 16 and 120 utilized flakes respectively.

REGIONAL COMPARISONS

101

From the excavation of 41BP191 and 418Pl92 and comparisons with
other regional studies, a generalized pattern of upland exploitation
emerges.
Specialized site types
include
quarries
or
lithic
procurement and reduction centers, lithic scatters and isolated finds
of projectile points which may represent hunting losses (Skelton
1979:28, Kenmotsu 1982:18).
Open campsites are multi-functional,
perhaps conveniently situated to exploit a specific resource but these
locations were also the site of day-to-day maintenance activities such
as food
processing,
cooking,
tool
manufacture
and
repair.
Characteristically, this site type is comprised of discrete habitation
features indicative of recurrent, short-term use by small groups. The
sites are located along drainages which currently provide meager
sources of water. Although springs have not been identified in this
area during modern times, it seems probable that water was more
plentiful and permanent at various times in prehistory. The seemingly
endless
supply of lithic material undoubtedly drew aboriginal
populations into the uplands but the ubiquitous distribution of high
quality flint suggests other factors influenced the selection of more
generalized camp sites such as 41BP191.
Sociocultural explanations for the recurrent use of such location
over 5000 years
can
be
eliminated.
No habit, tradition,
territoriality, familiarity with the terrain or other cultural
preference can be expected to persist beyond the living or group
memory of the individuals in a given society.
The attraction must
ultimately have been a product of a more permanent environmental
condition. Factors motivating consistent return to these localities
may have been as simple as the sand mantle which allowed easy hearth
construction. The constant burrowing of rodents in this sandy matrix
may have reduced the reproductive capacity of vegetation, maintaining
a large, level clearing along the banks of the creek where nut-bearing
hardwoods grew in abundance. Such optimal camping conditions can be
found throughout the uplands along the minor drainages. Sites similar
to 41BP191 and 41BP192 line the creek banks; 41BP220, which lies
across the drainway from 41BP191, may have at one time been a mirror
image of the Shoppa site.
Localized or variable preservation has
reduced the information content of the majority of these sites.
Within the framework of the overall settlement pattern, 41BP192
can be considered a temporary way station, used sporadically but
expediently during ~ seasonal exploitation round.
41BP191 was a
preferred camp ground, used more often and for a longer duration.
Short term resource exploitation could be carried out from this
encampment, the materials returned to the site and modified. The camp
then becomes the focal point in the upland seasonal round.
