Abstract
In October of 2012, prior to the construction of a proposed 4,000-linear-foot wastewater
line in Cedar Park, Texas, archeologists from aci consulting conducted a pedestrian survey
and shovel testing of the 50-foot easement (4.6 acres) in accordance with Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA) and Texas Historical Commission (THC) guidelines. Shovel testing
was not conducted in a portion of the proposed wastewater line that had previously been
subject to a cultural resources survey. Subsurface testing was also limited to areas with the
potential for buried deposits and/or low surface visibility. This work was conducted in
compliance with Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26.20[2]) under Permit 6354. Ann
M. Scott served as Principal Investigator and Robin Benson Barnes served as Project
Archeologist. Records from this investigation will be curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory.
Evidence was found that previously recorded prehistoric site 41WM145 extends into the
proposed project easement. However, the portion of the site within the easement does not
contribute to its eligibility for listing as State Archeological Landmark (SAL) or inclusion
on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) as no intact deposits were discovered.
Beyond the observed surface manifestation of site 41WM145, no intact prehistoric or
historic deposits were discovered within the proposed wastewater line easement. Based on
the results of this survey, no further archeological work is recommended.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
The City of Cedar Park is proposing to construct the Spanish Oak Creek wastewater line
in order to provide sewer service for future development. The proposed wastewater line
would be an 18-inch gravity wastewater line installed through an open trench, with the
exception of the RM 1431 crossing, which would be a 200 linear foot bore/encase. This
cultural resources survey evaluates a 4,000-foot long by 50-foot wide pipeline easement
(20-foot permanent easement, with 30-foot temporary construction easement, 4.6 acres),
which is the defined Area of Potential Effect (APE) (Figure 1).
The proposed alignment would begin approximately 600 feet north of RM 1431 where it
would connect with an existing facility. This section of the proposed alignment would be
open trenched almost directly south to RM 1431 in an existing utility easement adjacent
to a previously installed wastewater line, at which point the proposed pipeline would be
bored underneath RM 1431 for a distance of 200 linear feet. Just south of RM 1431, the
proposed alignment would again be opened trenched and would turn to the east along RM
1431 for approximately 250 feet. The proposed alignment would then parallel Spanish
Oak Creek in a generally southwesterly direction, crossing the creek twice in the middle
third of the portion of the proposed alignment south of RM 1431.
This investigation consists of an intensive archeological survey of the proposed Spanish
Oak Creek wastewater line pursuant to the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26.20[2])
under Permit 6354. The overall investigation includes pedestrian survey, shovel testing,
photography, a site revisit, basic archival research and National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP) and State Archeological Landmark (SAL) eligibility assessment, data
analysis, and report preparation in accordance with Texas Historical Commission (THC)
and Council of Texas Archaeologists (CTA) standards and Section 106 compliance for
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as necessary. The total number of shovel tests
excavated (n=7) was less than the thirteen shovel test minimum recommended for a
project of this length due exclusion of a previously surveyed section of the project as well
as the exclusion of areas with high surface visibility and a lack of Holocene deposition.

2.0 BACKGROUND INFORMATION
2.1 Environmental Setting
The project area is located in central Texas in the south end of the Lampasas Cut Plain.
The Lampasas Cut Plain is characterized by rolling hills bisected by the Brazos River and
its tributaries to form broad, shallow valleys. In this region, the hills provide
approximately 30 meters of relief along the creeks. Karst features including sinks, caves,
and rock shelters are present but not common (Collins and Mear 1998).
Hydrologically, Spanish Oak Creek flows into Brushy Creek east of the project area.
Brushy Creek flows east/northeast eventually reaching the Brazos River (Collins and
Mear 1998).
The Blackland Prairie lies just to the east of the project area on the eastern side of the
Balcones Escarpment, a fault zone with hills to the west and north and low relief to the
east and south. The Blackland Prairie supports prairie vegetation along with small woods
often found along low gradient streams. The Edwards Plateau is located just to the south
of the project area. This region differs from the Lampasas Cut Plain in that the stream cut
valleys are more deeply incised. Springs, karstic sinks, caves, and rock shelters are
characteristic of the region.
Prehistoric and historic peoples living in the region would have had access to resources of
the Blackland Prairie and Edwards Plateau in addition to Lampasas Cut Plain resources.
The diversity of biotic resources found in this ecotonal region would have been very
high. In addition, there is access to reliable water sources.
2.2 Soils
Soils in this area are classified as Denton-Eckrant-Doss Association, an association
composed of moderately deep, shallow and very shallow, calcareous, clayey, cobbly and
stony soils formed from indurated fractured limestone or limy earth (SCS 1983). Three
soil units occur in the proposed alignment (Figure 2):
Denton silty clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes (DnB) â This soil is found in narrow
drainageways, as well as in shallow valleys. The surface layer is dark brown silt clay
roughly 33 inches thick. The following layer is very pale brown silty clay loam that
extends to a depth of approximately 36 inches with underlying fractured limestone. The
available water capacity is medium and the permeability is slow due to the shallow depth
of the limestone. This soil is well drained.
Eckrant cobbly clay, 1 to 8 percent slopes (EaD) â This soil is generally found in
irregular shapes on undulating uplands. The surface consists of around 13 inches of a
3

dark grayish brown cobbly layer. The underlying material consists of coarsely fractured
indurated limestone. The soil is moderately permeable as long as it does not dry to the
point of cracking. It is well drained, and the available water capacity is very low.
Fairlie clay, 1 to 2 percent slopes (FaB) â This sloping soil is found along broad flats, as
well as drainageways. Most areas are long and narrow, ranging from 15 to 100 acres or
more in size. The surface layer is dark grayish-brown clay about 21 inches thick. The
following layer, to 46 inches, is gray clay in the upper layer and dark grayish brown in
the lower layer. The soil is moderately permeable, as long as it does not dry out to the
point of cracking. It is well drained, and the available water capacity is very low.
2.3 Geology
The proposed alignment lies within the Comanche Peak Formation (Kc). The Comanche
Peak Formation is exposed in the drainage basins. The Comanche Peak is composed of
fine-grained, fossiliferous, medium hard, nodular limestone (Collins and Mear 1998:11).

centered on the live-oak savanna, while a shift in emphasis toward xerophytes may have
occurred during xeric intervals.
The Late Prehistoric saw the migration of several new linguistic groups, primarily from
the Great Plains, into the region. The introduction of ceramics into the archeological
record takes place in the region during this time as well. The movement of Europeans
inland from the coast and north from Mexico ended the prehistoric era.
3.2 Historic Background
Historic exploration and settlement of the Williamson County area began in the late
seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries when Spanish explorers traveled through the
region searching for better routes to the missions in East Texas. Captain Alonso De LeÃ³n
followed the Camino Real from San Antonio to Bastrop several times during the 1680s,
and, at least once, he traveled on the Camino de Arriba, which crossed Brushy Creek and
the San Gabriel River. In 1716, Louis Juchereau de St. Denis, a French explorer, and
Captain Domingo Ramon, a Spanish explorer, led an expedition through the area and
camped on the banks of Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River. They named them
Arroyo do las BendÃ­tas Ãnimas and Rio de San Xavier, respectively. In 1721, the
Marques de Aguayo led a large group of soldiers, livestock, and provisions through
present-day Williamson County to replenish supplies at the eastern missions. In the mideighteenth century, the San Xavier missions were established along the San Gabriel
River, just east of the Williamson/Milam County line. By 1753, drought and disease
made the missions uninhabitable, and Spanish influence in the area declined (Odintz
2002).
Anglo-American influence in the area began with a series of land grants from the
Mexican government in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries. In 1835,
continual attacks by local Indians prompted Captain John J. Tumlinson and his company
of Texas Rangers to construct a fort and Indian lookout near the headwaters of Brushy
Creek, in southwestern Williamson County. Tumlinson Fort, as it was called, was
abandoned in 1836 when General Santa Ana invaded Texas (Odintz 2002).
Following the defeat of General Santa Ana at the Battle of San Jacinto, several veterans
of the battle settled in Williamson County. In 1838, Dr. Thomas Kenney and his family
built a fort on Brushy Creek, in what is now eastern Williamson County. Kenneyâs Fort
became the first civilian settlement in Williamson County. However, Indian attacks were
a frequent problem, and numerous settlers, including Kenney, were killed by Indians. By
1846, the Indian threat had waned and settlement in the region increased. In 1848, the
Texas legislature established Williamson County, naming it after Robert Williamson, a
Milam County Judge and state senator.

By 1850, the county had a population of 1,379 whites and 155 slaves. Most of the
population was located in the eastern part of the county on Brushy Creek and the San
Gabriel (Odintz 2002), but a few families were living in the western half. During the
1850s and 1860s, towns, lumber mills, and tanneries sprang up around the county.
Although urbanization and industrialization increased somewhat, the bulk of the county
remained rural and agricultural. The majority of the families lived on subsistence farms in
log houses and raised corn. During the 1850s and early 1860s, the slave population
increased and the agricultural patterns within the county became more diverse. Wheat
and corn were the predominant crops in the Blackland prairies, and cattle and sheep
ranching was widespread throughout the county. Cotton was introduced in the 1850s, but
it was not a significant cash crop.
The economy of Williamson County slumped during the Civil War but picked up again in
the 1870s with the growth of the cattle and sheep industry and the expansion of cotton
farming. The cattle industry was sustained by the Chisholm trail, which was established
in 1864 and passed close to Round Rock. Many cattle drives passed through or originated
in Williamson County. The 1870s and 1880s were also marked by the arrival of railroads
to Williamson County (Odintz 2002).
By the early twentieth century, cotton farming had surpassed the cattle industry in
importance. With the dramatic growth in cotton farming, a shift in farm tenancy
developed. As late as 1880, 77 percent of the farms were still worked by owners. By
1890, 43 percent of the farms were worked by owners, and by 1930, only 29 percent of
the farms were worked by owners. The tenancy rates continued to drop during the Great
Depression (Odintz 2002).
The cotton industry suffered economically during the 1920s from the effects of soil
depletion, falling prices brought on by overproduction, and the boll weevil infestation.
The Great Depression of the 1930s worsened the economic situation and encouraged
farmers to shift away from cotton to livestock. Cotton production was reduced by nearly
half, while sorghum and wheat became important crops. Along with cattle and sheep,
poultry farming intensified (Odintz 2002).
Significant population and economic changes occurred in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.
The construction and expansion of roads throughout the undeveloped areas of
Williamson County meant urban populations now had easier access to the Hill Country
and vice versa. The consolidation of rural schools also meant children could now attend
schools outside of their rural communities. For example, during the 1910s and 1920s,
Rock House School was one of the largest schools in Williamson County. In 1903, the
school boasted a population of 96 students and 2 teachers. The school was consolidated
with Liberty Hill School in 1947, and by the 1990s, Rock House had become a dispersed
agricultural community.

northeast. At this time, a flood control reservoir was located on the site. The site has not
been assessed in terms of NRHP or SAL eligibility.
A site form on file at TARL indicates that two test trenches and a grid of twenty-five 10Â­
by-10 foot trenches separated by three-foot berms was set up on the site. Notes on file at
Southwestern University indicate that the two test trenches were abandoned due to lack
of artifacts. The grid of trenches and berms was set up around a test trench that had the
highest density of artifacts. The site sketch map indicates that ten of the twenty-five
trenches were excavated. While the units are referred to as trenches, no reference to the
use of mechanical excavating equipment was made. The depth of fill was recorded as
about 5 feet of dark earth underlain by dark brown and then light brown. The light brown
is referred to as bedrock although it may mean that the light brown sediment was sterile.
Materials collected include points, scrapers, gravers, burins, burin spalls, knives, rubbing
stones, bone, snails, charcoal, and a few fossils.
A few pages of additional notes regarding the Lansford Site (41WM145) were found in
the collections at Southwestern University (Steelman n.d.). The three pages of notes did
not provide much information not also found on the site form on file at TARL. One
detail of importance is that a radiocarbon sample from the site was dated to 2235 +/radiocarbon years before present (300 B.C.) indicating Late Archaic occupation. In
addition, it was noted that the site was originally located on a mound covered with scrub
and grass in between Spanish Oak Creek and a plowed field.
Site 41WM233 was recorded in the ROW by TxDOT in 1973, but was not presented in a
report detailing the recommendations on any assessments. While it has not been subject
to a recent survey, records on file at TARL indicate that site 41WM233 was subject to
testing shortly after its recording in 1973. No intact buried cultural deposits were
identified from that testing. Site records and maps indicate that most, if not all, of the site
was destroyed by the construction of RM 1431 and the nearby bridge. Site 41WM233 can
be considered not eligible for NRHP or SAL inclusion due to the evidence in the TARL
records indicating a lack of intact deposits and the likely destruction of the site from the
construction of the roadway.
Site 41WM653 is a lithic scatter/lithic procurement site recorded in 1984 (Coffman et al.
1985). The site lacks any intact deposits and was considered not eligible for NRHP or
SAL inclusion. Site 41WM701, also a burned rock midden, was recorded and partially
excavated by archeologists at the University of Texas at Austin who excavated a burial
by request of a private landowner. NRHP or SAL eligibility status is unknown for
41WM701. Site 41WM945, a prehistoric and historic artifact scatter, was investigated
during a cultural resources project prior to the construction of the Cottonwood Creek
wastewater pipeline and found to be not eligible for NRHP or SAL inclusion (Feit and
Karbula 1999). In 2007, Site 41WM1182 was recorded as a surface lithic scatter without
10

intact subsurface deposits and recommended as not eligible for inclusion in NRHP or
SAL listing (Iruegas and Iruegas 2007).
Cultural resource projects conducted within one kilometer of the proposed project area
include the aforementioned Cottonwood Creek wastewater pipeline (Feit and Karbula
1999), development at Parmer Lane/Ronald Reagan Blvd. and RM 1431 (Iruegas and
Iregas 2007), the Ideal Basic Tract (Coffman et al. 1985), and the TxDOT pedestrian
survey conducted prior to the construction of RM 1431. Additional cultural resources
surveys were conducted by PBS&J in 2001 on a Leander Independent School District
(ISD) tract and along the Parmer Lane Extension (Hickman 1993). An elementary school
and stadium have been constructed on the Leander ISD property. The reports from
projects conducted within one kilometer of the proposed alignment and cited in Table 2
are listed in the 8.0 References Cited section.

5.0 METHODOLOGY
Following a review of current archeological sites data and historical research, a 100%
pedestrian survey of the wastewater alignment was conducted to locate any archeological
or historical sites that may be adversely affected by construction of the wastewater line.
Survey methods complied with THC/CTA survey standards for the overall project area.
A pedestrian survey of the APE was conducted to locate any archeological or historical
sites that may be adversely affected by construction. The subject area was walked in
parallel transects spaced sufficiently to adequately cover the 50-foot wide APE.
Recording methods included a daily log, photography, the use of task specific forms for
recording shovel tests and photographs, the completion of revisit site form, and the use of
a handheld GPS. No artifacts were collected.
Sub-surface testing was limited to shovel testing due to the shallow depth of deposits.
Shovel tests were excavated in settings with potential for buried cultural horizons or less
than 30 percent ground surface visibility. The shovel tests were at least 30 centimeters
(cm) in diameter and were excavated to the bottom of Holocene deposits. The shovel test
levels were no thicker than 20 cm, and the excavated sediments were screened through
Â¼-inch hardware cloth or troweled through and sorted by hand depending upon the clay
and moisture content. The total number of shovel tests excavated (n=7) compared to the
recommended 13 shovel tests for a project of this length was influenced by the exclusion
of a previously surveyed portion of the APE as well as areas with high visibility and lack
of potential for buried deposits.
Evidence of one previously recorded prehistoric site, 41WM145, was encountered and
recorded. A revisit site form and revised site boundaries will be submitted to the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory. The portion of the site within the APE was
evaluated for inclusion on the NRHP and eligibility for listing as a SAL.

13

6.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION
In summary, evidence of the previously recorded prehistoric site 41WM145 was
encountered within the APE. Seven shovel tests were placed in the 4,000-foot long
corridor in areas with poor surface visibility or potential for buried deposits (Figure 4,
Table 3). No shovel tests were dug in the section of the APE north of RM 1431 that
overlaps with the previously surveyed APE for the Cottonwood wastewater line (Feit and
Karbula 1999). Three of the seven shovel tests were located within the APE along the
margins of previously recorded site 41WM145. Fewer shovel tests were dug in the
western portion of the APE due to high surface visibility and lack of Holocene
deposition. During the pedestrian survey, one isolated find, a group of four historic
ceramic sherds was found.
The section of the APE north of RM 1431 was subject to pedestrian survey only (Figure
5). No shovel tests were dug because this section of the APE was subject to a cultural
resources survey conducted prior to the construction of the Cottonwood wastewater line
(Feit and Karbula 1999) (see Figure 4). The current project APE consists of a paved
driveway and shallow sediment with little possibility of intact buried deposits. No
artifacts or cultural features were observed in this portion of the APE.

14

Figure 5. Section of APE north of RM 1431 facing north

The remainder of the APE was subject to pedestrian survey and shovel testing.
Continuing from the north to south, the section of the APE just to the south of RM 1431
that parallels the RM 1431 right-of-way has been disturbed by road construction. The
portion of the APE that continues to the south of RM 1431 appears to have been
disturbed by fence and berm construction as well as vehicular traffic. Some modern trash
was noted. One shovel test (ST 4) was dug in a less disturbed wooded area. Sediments
were shallow and no cultural materials were discovered.
The area where soils maps indicate the sediments are deepest (see Figure 2) is along the
west side of Spanish Oak Creek north of where the APE crosses Spanish Oak Creek and
south of ST 4. The proposed APE runs in between Spanish Oak Creek and the
boundaries of the previously recorded site, 41WM145. The current landowners noted
that they regularly find prehistoric artifacts on the property.

18

As noted in 4.0 Literature Review, site 41WM145 was excavated by Southwestern
University between 1968 and 1970. In summary, two test trenches plus 1000 square feet
of excavations were conducted. Materials collected include points, scrapers, gravers,
burins, burin spalls, knives, rubbing stones, bone, snails, and charcoal. Records indicate
that prior to excavation, the site was located on a mound covered with grass and brush in
between Spanish Oak Creek and a plowed field. A Late Archaic radiocarbon date of
2235 +/- radiocarbon years before present (300 BC) was listed in papers on file at
Southwestern University. Site records are limited to three pages of handwritten notes
from the collections of the Southwestern University library (Steelman n.d.) and a site
form including a map of excavation units on file at TARL. No more extensive report of
excavations was discovered.
Site records on file at TARL indicate that the site boundary closest to the APE was
approximately 300 feet from Spanish Oak Creek, which matches the distance from the
creek mapped on the Sites Atlas. The current landownerâs home and out buildings are
now located approximately 70 feet from the previously recorded southern boundary of
the site. The proposed wastewater line is located approximately 100 feet from the creek
at the closest point. The portion of the APE closest to the previously recorded boundary
of site 41WM145 has been recently plowed and planted with oats. The landowner
indicated that it has been regularly plowed.
Artifacts including lithics and burned rock are scattered on the surface in parts of the
APE adjacent to site 41WM145 and are most visible in the plowed field (Figure 6).
Three shovel tests were dug in this section of the APE. No artifacts were found in ST 5
and ST 6 (See Figure 4). Older sediments with a reddish cast were encountered at
approximately 50 cmbs in ST 5 below darker sediments. Steelman noted on the site form
that the black sediments containing the burned rock midden were 5 feet (150 cm) deep
indicating that sediments similar to those found in the Steelman excavation units
containing cultural deposits do not extend as far as ST 5. Shovel Test 6 was excavated
within the portion of the APE nearest the southwest edge of the recorded boundaries of
site 41WM145. Even at the surface, the sediments were brown, rather than the black
sediments of the burned rock midden, indicating that the buried deposits of site
41WM145 do not extend to the APE in this direction. No artifacts were discovered in the
shovel test and the sediments throughout were browner with a reddish cast. Patinated
chert was also found below the surface indicating some level of disturbance. One artifact
was found in the top 10 cm of ST 7 (Figure 7), which was placed in the area of highest
artifact concentration within the APE in the portion closest to the recorded boundary of
site 41WM145 in between ST 5 and ST 6 (see Figure 4). As noted on the site form on
file at TARL, the upper 40 cm of deposition were black clay. The brownish sediments
indicating the base of the cultural deposits as excavated by Steelman were found between
40 and 45 cmbs. Because only one artifact was found within the plow zone, it appears
that buried cultural deposits associated with site 41WM145 do not extend into the APE.
19

Figure 6. Section of APE along plowed field adjacent to previously recorded site 41WM145

While surface artifacts and artifacts within the plow zone from site 41WM145 were
found to extend into the proposed project APE, shovel tests indicated that no intact
deposits extend into the APE. It is recommended that the site boundaries be extended to
encompass the surface scatter (see Figure 4). However, the portion of site 41WM145
within the APE does not contribute to the eligibility of site 41WM145 for listing as a
SAL or inclusion on the NRHP.

20

Figure 7. Shovel Test 7 located on the edge of the plowed field

Moving further along the proposed alignment to the south and west, one shovel test (ST
3, Figure 8; see Figure 4) was excavated in the portion of the APE east of Spanish Oak
Creek. This area of the APE showed evidence of recent flooding including downed brush
and trees as well as trash and plant debris suspended in the understory. The alternating
bands of sediment containing sand or carbonates found in ST 3 indicate that this was
likely a high energy depositional environment in the past as well. ST 3 was negative for
cultural material. The cut banks of Spanish Oak Creek were also examined in order to
verify the relatively shallow sediment depth.

21

Figure 8. Shovel Test 3 located in underbrush on east side of Spanish Oak Creek

Two shovel tests were excavated on the southwestern end of the proposed wastewater
line in the thicker sediments west of Spanish Oak Creek. No cultural materials were
observed in either shovel test. Loam and dark gray clay terminating at older gravels were
found in both shovel tests (see Table 3). In addition, four historic ceramic sherds, which
all cross mend, were noted as an isolated find on the surface in an area of shallow
deposition between ST 1 and ST 2. The sherds represent the remains of a brown transfer
print with a fern pattern that likely came from a drinking vessel such as a teacup. The
remains were diagnostically insufficient to type and date the sherds.

22

7.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
In advance of the construction of a proposed wastewater line in Cedar Park, Texas,
archeologists from aci consulting conducted a pedestrian survey and shovel testing in
accordance with CTA and THC guidelines along a 4,000- foot-long by 50-foot wide (4.6
acres) proposed wastewater line. This work was conducted in compliance with Texas
Administrative Code (13 TAC 26.20[2]) under Permit 6354. Evidence was found that
previously recorded site 41WM145 extends into the project APE. However, the portion
of the site within the APE does not contribute to its eligibility for listing as a SAL or
inclusion on the NRHP as no intact deposits were discovered. Beyond the extension of
site 41WM145 in the APE, no intact prehistoric or historic deposits were discovered.
Based on the results of this archeological survey, no further archeological work is
recommended. It must be noted that no level of survey intensity can be guaranteed to
locate all cultural features within a project area. Therefore, should previously-unrecorded
cultural resources including human remains be discovered during the course of
construction for this project, the City of City Park will contact the Texas Historical
Commission of the inadvertent discoveries.
