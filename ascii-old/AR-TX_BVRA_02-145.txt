ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of 1.48 miles of waste water line and 0.6 mile of water
line in north-central Leon County, Texas was conducted by Brazos Valley Research
Associates (BVRA) on December 15, 2004 for the City of Buffalo, Texas under Antiquities
Permit 3625. Much of the route of Area A traverses the flood plains of minor streams and
low-lying areas, localities not viewed by BVRA as likely settings for significant prehistoric
sites. A shallow mantle of sand over clay and clay at the surface were the major soil types
in the areas examined. No evidence of prehistoric activity was found in exposed areas or
through shovel testing. One historic site (41LN439) was found to be in the project area.
This is a house in very poor condition that appears to be greater than 50 years old. It is
not eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places or for designation as a
State Archeological Landmark. Therefore, it is recommended that the City of Buffalo be
allowed to proceed with construction as planned. This linear project consists of 9.3 total
acres.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Buffalo is applying for funds from the United States Department of
Agriculture, Rural Utilities Services to improve it’s water distribution and waste water
collection system by adding new water distribution lines, an elevated tank, new gravity
waste water collection lines, and replacing old lines as well as eliminating some waste
water lift stations within the city limits of this community (Figure 1). The majority of new
construction will take place adjacent to existing water lines and within various road rightsof-way. The temporary easement for these areas is 50 feet with the permanent easement
being 30 feet wide. Topographic coverage of the project area is provided by the USGS
7.5’ map Buffalo (Figure 2).
Two segments constitute the current project area. These are a proposed new
waste water supply line (Area A) and a water line (Area B). The length of Area A is 1.48
miles. This line will be placed in a trench 36 inches wide and between 5 and 8 feet deep.
Area B will be 0.6 mile in length and will be placed in a trench 36 inches wide and between
5 and 8 feet deep. The Texas Community Development Program will provide funding for
Area B at a later date. This area was examined as part of this project at the request of
KSA Engineers
Leon County is in a part of Southeast Texas known to contain significant prehistoric
and historic archaeological sites. A small portion of the area proposed for construction
appears to be in an undisturbed setting that has not been examined by a professional
archaeologist in the past. This segment of the line is viewed by the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) to be a high probability area for containing significant archaeological
sites, and an archaeological survey was requested in a letter from William A. Martin of the
THC to Lanny S. Buck of KSA Engineers dated November 30, 2004. In order to comply
with this requirement, the City of Buffalo retained BVRA to perform this service.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The following general discussion of Leon County is taken from the soil survey for
Leon County (Neitsch et al. 1989) and the 1984-1985 Texas Almanac (Kingston and
Harris 1983). Leon County is situated in the eastern part of Central Texas and consists of
690,861 acres or 1079 square miles including areas under water. It has an irregular
shape and is about 28 miles long by 40 miles wide. Elevation in the county varies
between 630 feet above sea level in the west-central part of the county to about 140 feet in
the southeast area. Overall, the topography is characterized as undulating to gently rolling
and generally sloping to the southeast. The county is drained by numerous creeks and
streams that flow into the Trinity and Navasota rivers which form the east and west
boundaries of the county, respectively. Annual rainfall varies from 39 to 46 inches. The
January minimum temperature is 38° and the July maximum temperature is 95°. These
climatic conditions create a growing season of 270 days.
Leon County is located in the West Gulf Coastal Plain, Texas Claypan Area, and
Texas Blackland Prairie Major Land Resource Areas. The soils in the county formed
under timber, post oak savannah, and prairie vegetation. Those formed under timber or
post oak savannah are light-colored fine sandy loam to fine sand while soils that formed
under grass consist of dark colored fine sandy loam to clay. Six soil types are present
within the boundaries of the project area (Figure 3). These are Cuthbert fine sandy loam
(CuE), Hatliff fine sandy loam, frequently flooded (Ha), Kirvin fine sandy loam (KrB),
Nugent loamy fine sand, occasionally flooded (Nu), Tenaha – Cuthbert complex (TcE),
and Wolfpen loamy fine sand (WoC). General information regarding these soils is
presented in Table 1 below.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to a recently published planning document for the Eastern Planning
Region of Texas (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.1.2), Leon County is situated
within the Prairie-Savanna archeological study region. Although 438 sites have been
recorded at TARL prior to this survey, the site density in the county is low in terms of sites
per square mile. Figure 1.1.3 in the planning document indicates that Leon County had
only 0.001 - 0.1 sites per square mile in 1993. This includes it within those counties with
the lowest site density in the state. In 1985, according to a statistical overview prepared
by the THC (Biesaart et al. 1985:83), Leon County contained 115 recorded sites. It is
beyond the scope of this report to discuss in detail the archaeological background of Leon
County, especially when several recent in-depth studies are available. Therefore, the
following discussion is taken from the planning document for the Eastern Planning Region
prepared by the THC and several of the more recent contract reports (see below). The
interested reader is advised to consult these monographs for additional information.
William E. Moore (1994) presents a detailed discussion of previous work in Leon County in
a contract report for a local water line project.
The first major archaeological project in Leon County was the Lake Limestone
study (formerly Upper Navasota Reservoir). The lake is located in Leon, Limestone, and
Robertson counties with the majority of the project area in Limestone County. The Texas
Archeological Survey conducted this work in 1974 under contract with the Brazos River
Authority (Prewitt 1974; Prewitt and Dibble 1974). Only areas of high site probability such
as floodplains and valley margins along the Navasota River and its major tributaries were
surveyed. Fifty-two prehistoric sites were recorded within the reservoir area. Of this
number, 37 were found to be situated on the crests or slopes of eroded valley margins.
Fifteen historical localities were noted but not recorded as sites.
Following the Lake Limestone project, the next major study in Leon County was
conducted at Jewett Mine where work was performed from 1980 to 1991 and is still
ongoing. The majority of sites in the county are on Jewett Mine property and most of our
current knowledge of the prehistoric and early historic sites of the area has been obtained
from these studies. Archaeological firms who have worked at the mine include Espey,
Huston & Associates, Inc., Geo-Marine, Inc., Prewitt and Associates, Inc., and the
Archeological Research Laboratory at Texas A&M University. Sites found at Jewett Mine
were mainly found in transitional zones of the major creeks with the average horizontal
distance to water being 131 meters. One site was found in the bottomland zone on a low
knoll in the floodplain of Birch Creek (Voellinger and Freeman 1980:4-15).
Diagnostic artifacts recovered during this survey indicate a prehistoric occupation,
which spanned the early, middle, and late Archaic and the Neo-American stages.
Additionally, they are viewed as an indication of the area's culturally peripheral location
providing evidence of culture contact with areas to the north, east, and west.

A scarcity of sites in areas of shallow soils was noted by this and previous surveys.
Soil probes on the terraces and upland breaks along the lower expanses of Mine Creek,
for example, repeatedly indicated less than 20 cm of soils over a clay base. In these areas
sites were absent. Beginning with the first deep sand hill upstream, however, an
abundance of prehistoric sites was found (Freeman and Voellinger 1982:2-62). One
suggestion for the preference of deep sandy soils is the possibility that certain plants that
prefer these deep soils were desired and exploited by prehistoric populations. Prewitt and
Grombacher (1974:7) found a scarcity of sites along the major tributaries. They attribute
this to the possibility that desirable or needed resources were more readily available along
the main stem valley than along the tributaries.
Freeman and Voellinger (1982:2-63) suggest that sites located on higher terraces
and upland margins are smaller in areal extent and contain less material cultural remains
than those along the major creeks. The latter should represent habitation sites with artifact
assemblages reflecting the area's major occupations. Features such as hearths, storage
pits, and structural remains might be found in sites along the major creeks while the
smaller sites at higher elevations should contain activity specific tool assemblages.
The vast amount of work in Leon County, particularly Jewett Mine and Lake
Limestone, has resulted in the recording of over 400 sites in the region when adjacent
counties are included. In Leon County alone, the total number of recorded sites prior to
this study was 385. In addition to the numerous surveys, testing has been conducted at
56 prehistoric sites with data recovery performed at 14 sites. Despite problems with the
archaeological record of the region such as low site visibility and interpretability based on
survey data, poor preservation of organic remains, a scarcity of sites with clear
stratigraphy, and the prevalence of bioturbation and other disturbance factors, much has
been learned about the prehistory of the area. Fields et al. (1991) integrated data from the
eight excavated sites at Jewett Mine and three excavated sites at Lake Limestone to
compile the most recent synthetic effort for this area. This study resulted in the isolation of
35 cultural components or analytical units. All but two of these units represent occupations
during the late Archaic, Woodland, or Late Prehistoric periods (Fields et al. 1992). The
interested reader is referred to these documents for more information regarding the
prehistoric and historic development of Leon County and vicinity.

METHODS
Background Check
Prior to entering the field, the site records at TARL on the campus of The University
of Texas at Austin were checked for the presence of previously recorded archaeological
sites in the project area and vicinity. In addition, a thorough review of the existing literature
for Leon County was conducted.
Field Survey
A 100% Pedestrian Survey of the 2.08 mile project area was conducted on
December 15, 2004. All eroded and otherwise exposed areas within the right-of-way were
examined for surface indications of prehistoric and historic sites. Shovel testing was
conducted in an attempt to identify the presence of buried sites and identify the soils
present. Each test was recorded on a shovel test log (Appendix I) and discussed in the
project notes. Shovel test locations are depicted on the project area map (Figure 2). The
excavated matrix was screened using 1/4-inch hardware cloth when possible. In some
areas, however, heavy clays made normal screening impossible. The matrix from these
tests was examined by manually breaking apart the clay. In all, 27 shovel tests were
excavated. The historic site in Area B (41LN439) was photographed and assigned a field
number. Its location is printed on the USGS map (Figure 2). Later, a site form was
submitted to TARL. The Project Archaeologist documented the project with a digital
camera, hand-held GPS, and field notes. Interviews with local residents were also
conducted in regards to the historic house in Area B.
Area A
This 1.48-mile segment of proposed waste water line will be funded by RUS, and it
is located west of the City of Buffalo (Figure 4). Wastewater will pass through 8-inch pipe
and 15-inch pipe along this route. The line originates at a point on State Highway 164 just
east of the bridge over Cane Branch, a small tributary of Buffalo Creek. The route follows
the floodplain of this minor stream in a southerly direction and parallels the edge of the
floodplain and the bottom of the toe slope of the 1st terrace. Part of the area was in
pasture, and part was in bottomland woods. Shovel testing was conducted where
possible. These tests were usually terminated due to water in the test unit or the
occurrence of clay, or both. The adjacent creek bank was visually inspected for the
presence of cultural materials. In all, 19 shovel tests were excavated in this area.

Area B
This 0.6-mile segment of proposed water line will receive funding by the Texas
Community Development Program at a later date. It is located south of the City of Buffalo
(Figure 5). Water will pass through 6-inch pipe along this route. This ara begins northeast
at a private driveway, crosses a paved road, and enters the Kain property now owned by
Larry Lynch of Buffalo. It is east of the Missouri Pacific Railroad line and south of State
Highway 75. The route is north and west of an unnamed tributary of Bliss Creek. Much of
the route follows an old-field road, which offered excellent surface visibility. The area was
in pasture and woods. Soils were mainly orange clay exposed on the surface. Shovel
testing was conducted in those areas where a shallow mantle of sand over the clay was
present. In all, eight tests were excavated. A standing structure and cistern (41LN439)
was found to be within the path of the proposed water line. It was photographed, and the
grounds were searched for artifacts and associated features. The location of this site is
depicted on the USGS 7.5’ topographic map Buffalo (Appendix II).

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Archival Research
The site records at TARL indicated an absence of recorded archaeological sites
within the path of the water and sewer lines as currently proposed. Numerous prehistoric
sites were found to be in the general area, all located in close proximity to major creeks
and rivers. No sites are plotted in flood plains of minor streams and low-lying or marshy
areas below the toe slopes of upland ridges. A standing structure is depicted on the
USGS 7/5’ topographic quadrangle Buffalo dated 1978 (revised 1982)
Field Survey
Much of the project area was in pasture and woods. Overall, the soils were very
wet, and standing water in shovel tests was a common problem. The two lines were
thoroughly shovel tested (n=27). These tests revealed a very shallow sandy mantle over
clay in much of the area and clay or clay loam at the surface in the rest of the area. The
depth of the tests varied from 10 cm to 30 cm, with one test dug to 40 cm before
encountering water.
No prehistoric archaeological sites were found to exist within Area A or Area B.
Since much of the project area lies within the flood plains of minor streams and very little
sandy soil exists anywhere in the project area, the two segments surveyed are very low
probability areas for significant archaeological sites. In this part of Southeast Texas,
prehistoric sites are usually found in one of three settings: (1) upland settings overlooking
major streams and rivers, (2) T-1 terraces adjacent to major streams and rivers, and (3)
buried in floodplains of major streams and rivers.
One standing structure (41LN439) was observed in Area B (Figure 2). It is a
house that is oriented along a northeast-southwest line. The front of the house is the
northeast elevation (Figure 6). It is a one-story, rectangular gabled roof structure with a
shed addition in the rear (Figure 7). The exterior walls are covered with vertical boards.
Although no evidence of battons was present, they may have been there at one time. At
the time of this survey, the exterior walls were partially covered with an asphalt shingle
siding, and tin had been nailed over this siding on the northwest elevation. The walls of
the shed addition were either missing, or this part of the house may have been enclosed
with screen wire instead of wood. The foundation is pier and beam, and the concrete piers
are cast in a flat top pyramid shape. The front elevation has two openings for doors and
two openings for windows. No evidence of a fireplace or chimney was observed.

A three-foot diameter cistern or well casing is located to the northeast of the house
(Figure 8) that is in very poor condition and is in danger of collapse. Many of the boards
on the exterior are missing, and the interior is also in poor condition (see Figure 9). Based
on the material types used in the construction of this house, this structure probably dates
to the 1940s or 1950s. Interviews with local residents revealed that the property is known
as the Old Kain Place, but it is not known if Mr. Kain ever resided there. Larry Lynch of
Buffalo who purchased it last year owns this site. He has not seen the house.
Although site 41LN439 probably meets the age criterion for listing on the National
Register of Historic Places or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark, it is not
eligible because the method of construction is not unique, it does not represent a
significant architectural type, and it is in poor condition.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No archaeological sites were found in Area A. Therefore, it is recommended that
the City of Buffalo be allowed to proceed with construction as planned in this area without
any further consultation with the THC. One historic site (41LN439) was found in Area B.
This site is not significant. Therefore, it is recommended that the City of Buffalo be allowed
to proceed with construction as planned in this area without any further consultation with
the THC. This project was conducted following the Minimum Survey Standards defined by
the Archeology Division of the THC.
