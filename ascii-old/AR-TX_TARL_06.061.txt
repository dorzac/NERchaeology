ABSTRACT
Reported herein are the resuLts of intensive excavations at
three prehistoric aboriginaL sites and testing of tweLve sites,
aLL Located aLong a bLuff overLooking the Brazos River fLood
pLain in Austin County, Texas. Sponsored by Houston Lighting &
Power Company, the project was intended to mitigate Losses to
the archeoLogicaL record resulting from construction of the
Allens Creek NucLear Generating Station.
AnaLysis of materials from three intensiveLy excavated
sites - 41 AU 36, 41 AU 37, and 41 AU 38 - produced a record of
human activity in the area spanning a time period from 2600
B.C. (MiddLe Archaic) to A.D. 1530 (Late Prehistoric). Through­
out this period, prehistoric peopLes Lived by hunting and
gathering food resources avaiLabLe in nearby river, fLood
pLain, and prairie environments. Their activities centered
around sites situated aLong the immediate edge of the bluff,
which were repeatedLy inhabited through succeeding periods in
the cuLturaL sequence.
The Ernest Witte site (41 AU 36) contained materiaLs
evidencing use of the site as both a habitation and a cemetery
during different periods in its history. HabitationaL remains
representing MiddLe Archaic (pre-B600 B.C.), TransitionaL
Archaic or earLy Late Prehistoric (A.D. 550 - A.D. 950), and
Late Prehistoric (post - A.D. 800) occupations were recovered.
An estimated 238 human burials, stratified into four distinct
layers, Were recovered from the site. AnaLysis of cemetery
popuLations, buriaL practices, and grave incLusions suggest a
popuLation increase during the Late Archaic (650 B.C. to A.D.
500) accompanied by participation in an import-export system
ultimateLy Linking people of Texas' centraL region and northern
coastaL pLain with contemporary groups of the southeastern
United States. ArtifactuaL remains originating from at Least as
far away as centraL Arkansas were recovered from the cemetery
which deveLoped during this time period. Five individuaLs in
the Late Archaic buriaL group died of dart point wounds. This
evidence, coupLed with three other instances of vioLent death,
is used to suggest that confLiot was on a region-wide increase
sometime during the period. TransitionaL Archaic and Late
Prehistoric buriaLs found in the site indicate that material
exchanges between LocaL popuLations and cuLturaL groups of the
southeastern U.S. decLined significantLy or aLtogether.
Based on the findings at 41 AU 36, a modeL showing peripheral
partioipation of oentral Texas Archaic peoples in the Woodland
interaction system of the eastern United States is offered.
After A.D. 200, a retraction of the area involved in the import­
export system northeastward away from central Texas is also
postulated.
iii

Primarily a habitation site~ but also aontaining human
the Leonard K site (41 AU J?) revealed a stratified
deposit with horizons representing the Middle Arahaia~ Late
Arahaia~ and Late Prehistoria periods.
The limited number of
burials found in the site generally follow the trends desaribed
for the Ernest Witte site above. A aeramia 8equenae~ developed
from two distinat Late Prehistoria aomponents with the site
(the earlier dated at A.D. 920 and the later at A.D. 1480)~
bears a strong resemblanae to the Galveston Bay sequenae~ a
finding suggesting that Late Prehistoria peoples at Allens
Creek had strong ties with aoastal groups.
The Little Bethlehem site (41 AU J8) aontained a shallow~
unstratified deposit yielding a wealth, of Late Prehistoria
habitational debris and some inferential data aonaerning Late
Prehistoria burial praatiaes.
Dated at A.D. l480~ the sites
yielded aeramias~ faunal remains and ahipped stone diagnostias
more typiaal of aoastal than inland groups of the same period.

PREFACE
In anticipation of the construction of the Allens Creek
Nuclear Generating Station, Houston Lighting and Power Company
sponsored the full extent of archeological investigations in the
Allens Creek area. from the inception of the preliminary surveys
to the excavations reported herein. At the end of each phase
of the investigations, reports were submitted to HL&P, fulfilling
the terms of the agreements between them and the Texas Archeo­
logical Survey. The issuance of this special publication was
made possible through the continued support by HL&P in order that
the results of the excavation of this remarka51esfte could be
more fully disseminated. The Texas Archeological Survey grate­
fully acknowledges this support.

INTRODUCTION
In 1972, under the sponsorship of the Houston Lighting and
Power Company, the Texas Archeological Salvage Proj~ct (now the
Texas Archeological Survey) conducted a reconnaissance at the
site of the company's proposed Allens Creek Nuclear Generating
Station (ACNGS). The ACNGS statton site is located in Austin
County, immediately north of the small town of Wallis» Texas.
Houston lies approximately seventy kilometers to the east-north­
east. The facility will be constructed along a bluff overlooking
the flood plain of the Brazos River. The bluffline~ a horseshoe­
shaped meander scar cut by the Brazos~ and the flood plain below
will be modified to serve as the banks and floor of a cooling
lake for the nuclear plant.
The 1972 survey resulted in the location of thirty-two pre­
historic aboriginal sites (Fig. 1); one additional site, 41 AU
43, was reported subsequent to the survey by John Herbert of
Houston (Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, County Site
Files). Fifteen of these sites were recommended for " ... test
excavation$ in order to precisely define the characteristics of
the sites" (Dillehay and others 1972).
The investigations reported herein began in 1974 with the
following goals: 1) to carry out subsurface testing operations
at each of the fifteen recommended sites; and 2) to conduct
extensive excavations at a limited number of sites thought to
best represent the prehistoric cultural sequence in the area.
To this end, a period of over a month was spent excavating test
pits and proftle trenches at the fifteen sites. At the conclu­
sion of this testing program~ enough evaluative data had been
generated to allow an assessment of the relative potentials for
each site. Based on this information, twelve of the fifteen
sites were eliminated from further consideration. (See Appendix
V for information on these sites.)
Four criteria were used to decide which sites tested
warranted fu~ther work: 1) the amount of disturbance that the
site had been subjected to subsequent to aboriginal occupation;
2) the horizontal and vertica~ dimensions of the site; 3) the
productivity of the deposits at the site in terms of cultural
residues (faunal remains, 1ithics, and ceramics); and 4) whether
more than one period of cultural activity was represented in the
deposits at the site. This approach was necessitated by the
length of time allotted for field work and the lack of any sub­
stantial body of information concerning the cultural prehistory
of the area. Using these criteria, sites 41 AU 36, 41 AU 37, and
41 AU 38 were selected as the localities offering the greatest
potential for definition of the full spectrum of cultural pre­
history at Allens Creek.

ALLENS CREEK

The task of archeological data retrieval at Allens Creek
was originally scheduled to be accomplished within a four month
period. However, the discovery of an extraordinary cemetery at
41 AU 36 resulted in an additional three months of excavation,
bringing the duration of field work to a total of seven months.
The intensive excavation segment of the program began at 41 AU 38
on September 26, 1974 and continued for approximately one month.
The following month, excavations took place at 41 AU 37. In­
vestigations at 41 AU 36 began on December 3, 1974 and continued
at irregular intervals until August 28, 1975, for a combined
total of four months.

ALLENS CREEK

THE REGIONAL SEQUENCE OF ABORIGINAL CULTURE
Until recently, extensive archeological investigation in
Austin and immediately surrounding counties has been very
limited. In this archeologically "undefined" region, (Suhm,
Krieger and Jelks 1954), the background necessary to view the
archeological findings at Allens Creek must depend on a summary
of the archeology in peripheral, but better known, areas.
As a means of facilitating this review, four developmental
periods - Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and
Historic - will be utilized as major divisions of the aboriginal
cultural sequence. This classificatory system is adapted
from, and generally correlates with, the system used in An
Intpoductopy Handbook of Tereas Apcheotogy (Suhm, Krieger, and
Jelks 1954) and in the more recent reports concerning the archeo­
logy of the Texas coast and adjacent regions. The divisions
are based primarily on distinctive artifact assemblages;
information on sUbsistence habits and relative and absolute
dating are equally important, but less frequently available,
criteria. As each of these periods is discussed below, sites
typical of the period, or of subdivisions within the period,
will be presented along with pertinent information on diagnostic
artifact assemblages and chronological position. The following
review is not intended as a definitive survey and by no means
incorporates all of the available data concerning each of the
periods.
Paleoindian Period
On the coastal plain of Texas, Paleoindian activity is
evidenced almost entirely by scattered finds of projectile point
types such as ctovis, Ptainview, Scottsbluff, and Angostupa.
At Allens Creek possible Paleoindian activity is evidenced by
several Angostupa points reported in a landowner's collection
from 41 AU 18 (Dillehay and others 1972).
The relatively common occurrence df projectile points
attributed to the Paleoindian Period is a reasonable indication
that people were inhabiting the Texas coastal plain at an
early date. Beyond this evidence for their presence, there has
been little or no data recovered concerning the Paleoindian
subsistence base. Further, the chronological position of these
manifestations, either relative or abs01ute, has not been
established. The archeological investigation at Allens Creek
produced no data altering this current level of knowledge.

THE REGIONAL SEQUENCE

5

Archaic Period
Three subdivisions of Archaic culture have been defined
along the stretch of the Texas coastal plain falling between
the Nueces and Red rivers. A fourth unit, the Morhiss Focus,
has been informally proposed.
ARANSAS FOCUS
The Aransas Focus, as presently conceptualized, includes
a group of shell middens confined to a narrow belt of land
adjacent to Corpus Christi, Aransas, and Copano bays along
the south-central Texas coast. The type assemblage for the
focus was recovered from the Johnson Site by a W.P.A. crew.
T.N. Campbell (1947) reported the investigation and defined
the focus. The geographic range of this focus was subsequently
extended to include the Kent-Crane site, sites on islands in
the Laguna Madre, and the Live Oak Point site (Campbell 1952,
1956, 1958).
The material culture of the Aransas Focus includes numerous
artifacts manufactured from marine shells; a variety of dart
point types; ground stone, including abraders, milling slabs,
and manos; bone artifacts such as tubular beads, incised
lIawlsll, and IIpin-like" objects; asphaltum; and twined basketry
and matting evidenced by impressions preserved in asphalt
(Suhm, Krieger and Jelks 1954:129).
The shell artifacts are by far the most important diagnostic
materials of the focus. Utilizing mainly the shell of the
lightning whelk (Busyaon aontpapium), artifacts such as hammers,
adzes, gouges, awls, net weights, scrapers, pendants, and
beads were produced (Campbell 1960:153}.
Dart p01nt types most common to the Aransas Focus are
Ensop, Mapaos, Lange, Kent" and Tpavie. Less common are Toptug'ae,
Matamopos, Catan, Abasolo, and Palmillas. Rarely occurring are
Castpoville, Desmuke, Bulvepde, Ellie, Faipland, Kinney, Nolan,

and Mophiss (Suhm, Krieger and Jelks 1954). Strictly on the
basis of typology, this projectile assemblage shares many common
forms with the Edwards Plateau Aspect in central Texas and a
lesser number with the Falcon Focus of southwest Texas. Exactly
what these shared types signify has not yet been determined.
It is probably significant to note, however, that chert of the
size and quality necessary for production of most of the Aransas
Focus chipped stone artifacts is not locally available. From
this it is inferred that trips inland, or trade with other
groups, were necessary to procure either raw materials or finished
artifacts (Suhm, Krieger and Jelks 1954:125).
Subsistence data available for the Aransas Focus indicates
a heavy reliance on marine shellfish with bison, dee.r, s'mall
mammals, fish,and plant foods exploited to a lesser extent.

6

ALLENS CREEK

The absolute dates of this focus have not been definitely
established. Radiocarbon assays of shell and charcoal samples
collected from the Archaic component of the Ingleside Cove site
yielded dates indicating occupation between A.D. 1100 and 1200.
If correct, these dates are quite important for
they are much later--by almost 1000 years--than
Cl~ dates from materials that are called late
Archaic in central and west Texas. The Ingleside
Cove site raised the intriguing possibility
that there was a sizable cultural lag on the
central Texas Gulf coast (Story 1968: 42).
Based solely on cross-correlation of projectile point types,
Campbell (1960) speculates that the focus may have had its
inception as early as 2500 to 1500 B.C. and that an end date of
A.D. 1000 would be acceptable.
In a recent reassessment of the cultural sequence along the
Texas coast between Baffin Bay and the Brazos River, Corbin
(1974: 31) states that, "although originally . . . limited to
the area between Corpus Christi Bay and Guadalupe Bay . . . ,"
the Aransas Focus has now come to be applied to nearly all
Archaic materials between Baffin Bay and the Colorado River."
Co mm e nt ; n g 0 n Cam pbellI s (1 9 4 7) inc 1 u s ion 0 f the Ken t ­
Crane site in the Aransas Focus, Corbin (1974: 31-37) calls
attention to significant variations in the artifact assemblages
recovered from zones defined within the Kent-Crane midden.
Corbin believes that there were, in reality, two or more dis­
tinct Archaic components represented in the deposits at Kent­
Crane. The materials actually representing the Aransas Focus
as defined by Campbell were in Zone 2, the uppermost deposit
containing Archaic remains. In Zones la and lb, the basal
deposits, there was a
II

. . . projectile point assemblage of
Palmilla8~ and MatamoP08~ along with
a high percentage of shell tools (gouges and
adzes) and incised decorated bone work.

Bulvepde~

Corbin (1974) recommends either: 1) restricting the extent
of the Aransas Focus to the type locality (Johnson site) "and
those other sites containing the predominant projectile point
assemblage of En8oP~ Catan~ Dapl-Paipland~ and MatamoP08
or 2) expanding the manifestation into an Aransas complex
designating the Archaic cultural adaptation to the coastal
environment of the area.

EDWARDS PLATEAU ASPECT
Elements of an Archaic complex known as the Edwards Plateau
Aspect are found north of the Aransas Focus area. As defined by
Suhms Krieger, and Jelks (1954)s this aspect represents cultural
remains occurring over a vast area of central Texas.
It extends westward to include Tom Green
and Edwards Counties s northward to a line
extending from Jones to Kaufman Countiess
in the east to the middle Trinity Rivers and
on the south to the coastal and southwest areas
(Suhm s Krieger and Jelks 1954: 99).
The surviving material culture of the Edwards Plateau
Aspect is dominated by chipped stone artifactss the inventory
including a wide range of tool types. Other classes of artifacts
include ground stone, polished stones bone, antlers and some
shell. Rather than list all of the constituents of this
assemblage, only a few classes considered particularly important
in demonstrating a connection between this aspect and complexes
to the south and east will be mentioned.
Dart point types common to the Edwards Plateau Aspect are:
Pedernates, Notan, Montett, Frio, Fairland, Castrovitle, Bulverde,
Lange, Marcos, Marshall, Martindale, Travis, and Uvalde. Dart
and Ensor are two types which appear late in the sequence. The

corner-tang knife is relatively common to the aspect and is
an especially diagnostic type. Ground stone artifacts include
manos and milling stones. Pendants and boatstones s commonly
manufactured out of limestone but sometimes of slate or metamor­
phic rocks r~present the polished stone category. Artifacts
of bone occur infrequently, probably largely a result of sites
containing soils not conducive to preservation. Rarely,
ornamental marine shell artifacts are recovered. Culturally
modified pieces of ocher and graphite occur and may have been
utilized for pigment (Suhm, Krieger and Jelks 1954: 110).
Subsistence base data indicate ~ reliance-Dn hunting arid
gathering. Deer, and to a lesser extent bison, were important
game though small mammals and fish were also taken. The common
occurrence of manos and metates implies utilization of vegetal
products.
Relative and absolute chronologies are well-established for
the Edwards Plateau Aspect in central Texas, less so south and
east on the coastal plain. A recent summary is provided by
Prewitt (1974). In this interpretation, the Archaic is divided
into Early. Middle, Late s and Terminal periods spanning a 5900
year time range. Within this range, the periods and corres­
ponding diagnostic projectile points are:

ALLENS CREEK

8

Early Archaic (Bell~ Travis~ Nolan~ Bulverde)
4650 B.C. to 2050 B.C.
Middle Archaic (Pedernales) 2050 B.C. to 450 B.C.
Late Archaic (CastrovilZe~ Maraos~ Marshall
MonteZl) 450 B.C. to A.D. 250
Terminal Archaic (Darl~ Fairland~ Ensor)
A.D. 250 to A.D. 750
.
Weir (1976) has suggested that the conventional divisions
or periods within the Archaic of Central Texas are not sensitive
enough to reflect culturally significant breaks in the archeo­
logical record. In a reevaluation of available data, he presents
in place of the Edwards Plateau Aspect, the Central Texas
Archaic consisting of five phases spanning a 7300 year interval.
The artifact assemblages attributed to each of the phases are
important to the present study. Certain artifact forms, con­
sidered to be particularly diagnostic as time indicators or
evidence of interregional exchange, are placed in more discrete
units of time within the Central Texas Archaic. The five phases
(Weir 1976: 14) and their approximate temporal spans (after
Prewitt n.d.) are:
San Geronimo
Clear Fork
Round Rock
San Marcos
Twin Sisters

5100 B. C. - 3050 B. C.
2050 B. C.
3050 B.C.
2050 B. C. - 650 B. C.
650 B. C. - A.D. 250
A.D. 250 - A.D. 700

-

Artifacts pertinent to later discussions in this report include
the PedernaZes projectile point of the Round Rock Phase, and
boatstones, corner-tang knives, and Ensor and Fairland projectile
points of the Twin Sisters Phase. Assignments of artifacts
to these phases are suggested by Weir (1976) •. ~
The southern and eastern limits of the Edwards Plateau
Aspect are rather nebulously defined, reflecting the limited
amount of archeological investigation in the area. Excavations
producing material used to define the aspect took place primarily
in the Texas hi~l country, either along, or west of, the
Balcones Escarpment.
Evidence regarding the eastern extent of the Edwards Plateau
Aspect is limited. Wheat's (1953) investigation of the Addicks
Dam Basin in Harris County produced some projectile points
common to the aspect but these types represent only a very small
percentage of the total projectile point collection. Immediately
north of Harris County, excavation of sites in the San Jacinto
River Basin (Shafer 1968) in Montgomery County produced vir­
tually no projectile point types relating the Archaic components
of that area to the Edwards Plateau Aspect. Recent excavations
near LaGrange in Fayette County (Skelton 1977) yielded signi­
ficantly higher percentages of artifacts, both projectile points
and other forms, demonstrating an increasing morphological
affiliation to the west as the core area of the aspect is
approached.

MORHISS FOCUS
T~e Morhiss site is located on the coastal plain in the
region intervening bet~een the core areas or the Aransas Focus
and the Edwards Plateau Aspect", Situated on an isolated 450
foot-long terrace remnant along the Guadalupe River in Victoria
County, this outstanding sIte was exca~ated during the years
li38 to 1940 by a W.P.A. crew under the field supervision of
N.A. Duffen. A detailed report of the investigation has never
been published, but a substantial collection of field notes
(Ouffen 1938-1940) and the artifacts recovered are housed in the
collections and archives of the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory. A summary and brief evaluation of findings at the
site were presented by Campbell (l962}.
Serving both as a habitation and a cemetery, the Morhiss
site yielded large amounts of midden residue and some 250
~uman burials.
The burials were found in four positions: bundled,
flexed, semi-flexed, and extended. Bundle burials occurred in
the highest levels with flexed, semi-flexed, and extended burials
stratified in respective order below, Commonly associated with
the bundle burials were "keel-backed scrapers"; less often,
perforated Marginella shell beads and "well-flaked flint knives"
were found. Among the associations with extended and semiflexed burials were marine shell pendants, Marginella or Oliva
s~ell beads, red ocher, and bone artifacts (Ouffen 1940).
The midden resulting from occupational activity at the site
contained many intact hearths and a wide array of artifacts.
Numerous chert cobbles, cores, preforms, quartzite hammerstones,
and deer ulna "flakers" indicate that chert knapping was an
important activity at the site. Indeed, the sheer bulk of chert
in all forms suggests that a substantial source must have been
located somewhere in the vicinity. Morhiss may well be an
example of the type of site that supplied lithic artifacts to
the chert-poor areas of the coast, suc~ as components of the
Aransas Focus.
Other important diagnostic artifacts recovered from the
Morhiss site midden include seven corner-tang knives (Ouffen
1939); BU8ycon shell artifacts including celts, gouges, and whole
shells; asphaltum; a bannerstone fragment; and numerous pro­
jectile points and gouge- and scraper-like chert tools in many
ways similar to the tradition expressed in the lithic assemblage
of the Edwards Plateau Aspect.
The projectile point types recognized by Campbell (1962)
in the Morhiss collection include, commonly, Morhiss, Lerma,
and Tortugas; less commonly, Refugio, Kinney, Pandora, Nolan,
Travis, and Darl; and rarely, Abasolo, Catan, Matamoros, Kent,
PalmiZlas, Marcos, Lange, Uvalde, BuZverde, Pedernales, and
Ensor. Of these, the Morbiss point is of foremost importance as
its regional distribution aids in definition of the geographic
extent of the focus (Calhoun 1965a).

ALLENS CREEK

10

Kelley (1955) apparently conceives of the Archaic materials
from the Morhiss site as typifying a more widespread tradition
which he refers to as the Morhiss Focus. Though the focus has
never been formally defined, it has been recognized as a
tenable construct by later researchers in the area (Calhoun
1965a, Fox and others 1974, Fox and Hester 1976).
Calhoun, in discussing the geographic distribution of sites
containing materials characteristic of the Morhiss Focus, states
ttta t they
. . . stretch from San Antonio Bay on the ~
coast at the delta of the Guadalupe Rtyer~. ~p
the Guadalupe to somewhere between Cuero and
Gonzales, and up the San Antonio River to
about Goliad. A few sites, of course, are
found along the main tributary streams of
those two rivers, and it may have reached
over to the lower Lavaca and Navidad Rivers . . .
(Calhoun 1965a: 4).
A major problem in consideration of the Morhiss Focus is
that it has never been clearly delineated. Furthermore,
the chrono10gic position of the focus is uncertain in both
relative and absolute terms. Of the collection from the Morhiss
site, Campbell (1962) states that "the range of dart point styles
suggests that the entire Archaic sequence may be represented".
The Morhiss assemblage in all probability spans a much greater
period of time than is proposed for the Morhiss Focus.
LA HARPE ASPECT
Archaic manifestations on the coastal plain northeast of
Austin County have been placed in the La Harpe Aspect, defined
by Johnson (1962) on the basis of data recovered in excavations
at the Yarbrough and Miller sites in northeastern Texas.
On the western frontier of the eastern wood­
lands, in a belt reaching from the vicinity
of Houston, Texas, into east-central Oklahoma,
the following uniformities in prehistoric
culture charige during the Archaic can be
recognized. (1) At the beginning or early part
of the Archaic stage there was a marked
numerical prevalence of expanding stem dart
points over those of other stemming traditions.
(2) This was followed by a growth in the
popularity of contracting stem dart points
(represented principally by the Gary type),
which development slightly preceeded (3)
the appearance of pottery vessels of various
plain and often crude wares (Johnson 1962: 168).

THE REGIONAL SEQUENCE

11

The southern boundary of the La Harpe Aspect was drawn near
Houston as a result of Wheat's (1953) controlled excavations at
the Doering, Kobs, and Grisbee sites at Addicks Dam. The
Archaic components at these sites produced expanding stem pro­
jectile forms in the early levels giving way to contracting
stem Gary points and pottery in later levels. A similar situa­
tion was reported for sites in the San Jacinto River Basin of
Montgomery County (Shafer 1968) though. significantly, the
expanding stem forms were absent.
As a result of excavations at the McGee Bend Reservoir 1n
east Texas, Jelks (1965) defined the Brookeland Focus which
. . . would seem to fit into the La Harpe
Aspect rather comfortably, although there is
some question as to whether or not the shift
from expanding stem to contracting stem dart
points that Johnson considers characteristic
of the aspect actually took place in McGee
Bend (Jelks 1965: 267).
Johnson (1962: 269) lists flexed burials, pitted manos,
expanding stem dart points (early phase), contracting stem dart
points (later phase), plain ceramics (terminal La Harpe Aspect),
and various polished and ground stone artifacts as being lithe
most salient material traits of the aspect". He adds, however.
that certain other forms representing the aspect have much more
limited distributions. Thus the Fourche Maline Focus of
Oklahoma, included by Johnson in the La Harpe Aspect, has an
artifact assemblage including polished stone celts, stone
gorgets, boatstones, double-bitted chipped stone axes, shell
gorgets, bone atlat1 hooks, and corner-tanged knives (Bell and
Baerreis 1951).
Relatively limited subsistence data for components of the
La Harpe Aspect suggest a heavy reliance on deer with a lesser
emphasis on bison", small mammals, tortoises, and shellfish.
Manos and milling slabs indicate some processing of vegetal
materials.
The absolute time span for the La Harpe Aspect has not been
adequately established. Story (1976: 53) cites a date of
130! 60 B.C. (TX-1961) from the Lawson site in Cooper
Reservoir as " • . • apparently the only radiometric determination
on Archaic materials in east Texas".
Late Prehistoric Period
In this report, the appearance of projectile points indi­
cating the use of the bow and arrow is used to mark the
transition from Archaic to Late Prehistoric. It should be noted,
however, that there is some question as to whether or not appear­
ance of the bow and arrow actually signals a notable departure
from previous subsistence habits and lifestyle (Corbin 1974: 91).

12

A.GLENS CREEK

In central Texas, arrow points appear in archeological
deposits during the period A.D. 650 to A.D. 750 (Prewitt 1976).
Along the coast, there is more variation in the dates for the
Archaic to Late Prehistoric transition. Story (1968) reported
an Archaic component from the Ingleside Cove site in San
Patricio County as dating about A.D. 1200. late Prehistoric
remains recovered from the same site presumably date younger
than this A.D. 1200 age. In the Galveston Bay area, the time
of initial appearance of arrow points has not yet been satisfac­
torily established. Suggested dates for inception range from
A.D. 500 (Aten 1971) to A.D. 900 (Corbin 1974).
In central Texas, late Prehistoric remains are gen~rally
designated as belonging to the Central Texas Aspect (Suhm,
Krieger and Jelks 1954) which has been divided into two foci ­
Austin and Toyah - on the basis of stratigraphic relationships
revealed at the Blum Rockshelter (Jelks 1953), the Smith Rock­
shelter (Suhm 1957), and the Kyle Site (Jelks 1962).
AUSTIN FOCUS
The Austin Focus, dating from A.D. 650 to A.D. 1350
(Prewitt 1976), is represented by an artifact assemblage in­
cluding Saallorn and Granbury arrow points; Darl~ Ensor
Yarbrough, and Wells dart points; Friday and Cleburne knives;
serrated flakes; side scrapers; spall scrapers; crude bifacial
implements; and gravers. Bone artifacts include spatulate deer
ulna implements and bone awls. Among miscellaneous artifact
forms attributed to the focus are hammerstones, manos. grinding
slabs, hematite pigment, smoothed antler tines, and perforated
mussel shell s (Je1 ks 1962: 85-89.).
TOYAH FOCUS
The later Toyah Focus, A.D. 1300 to A.D. 1800 (Prewitt 1976),
is represented by the following chipped stone artifacts: Perdiz
and Cliffton arrow pOints; four-edged, bevel-bladed knives and
double-pointed knives; small drills often with proximal ends un­
finished and bearing the striking platform of the flake from
which the drill was made; side scrapers. spall scrapers, and
snub-nosed end scrapers; crude bifacial implements; and gravers.
Bone artifacts include bison bone scrapers and rectangular
spatulate objects. Pottery found in Toyah Focus components
includes Leon Plain, a bone-tempered ware suggested to be an
indigenous product, and trade wares attributed to the Gibson and
Fulton Aspects of east Texas and the Galveston Bay Focus of
coastal Texas (Jelks 1962: 85-89).
Subsistence data available indicate that the people of the
Austin and Toyah foci relied on hunting, fishing, and gathering
as the mainstays of their 11ve1ihood,with agriculture possibly

THE REGIONAL SEQUENCE

13

providing some additional food. Deer, bison, bear, antelope,
rabbit, squirrel, beaver, opossum, skunk, fox, wolf, and bobcat
are species represented in faunal collections from Central Texas
Aspect sites. Some or all of these were undoubtedly killed for
food (Jelks 1962: 93). For the Toyah Focus, bison has been shown
to be of particular importance as an animal food resource
(Hester and Parker 1970, Dillehay 1974, Skelton 1977).
Remains of fish, turtles, and mussels demonstrate exploitation
of aquatic resources. A variety of products from wild plants ­
roots, nuts, beans, and seeds - were also available and very
1ikel.y utilized (Jelks 1962: 93).
Though it has been conclusively demonstrated that the Austin
Focus generally dates earlier than the Toyah Focus in central
Texas, there is still a problem regarding a demonstrated temporal
and stratigraphic overlap of the latest remains attributable to
the Austin Focus and the earliest Toyah Focus remains. A widely
held interpretation (Jelks 1962) is that the overlap reflects
people of t~e Austin Focus gradually adopting the economic
strategy and concomitant artifact assemblage of the Toyah Focus.
Greer l1976) has rejuvenated a previously considered, but
generally discounted, interpretation in suggesting that the two
artifact assemblages represent ethnically distinct cultural
groups. In this scheme, Austin Focus peoples were gradually
forced out of central Texas by the inexorable, sometimes hostile
encroachment of Toyah Focus people.
GALVESTON BAY FOCUS
Closer to the coast in an easterly direction from Al1ens
Creek, Late Prehistoric manifestations were assigned to the
Galveston Bay Focus by Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks (1954). Chipped
stone artifacts characteristic of the focus include ScaZZorn~
Perdiz~ Alba~ Cliffton~ and Fresno arrow points; side, end, and
flake scrapers; leaf-shaped knives with alternately beveled
edges; small expanding-base drills; and gravers. Other
artifacts found in Galveston Bay components are bone awls and
flaking tools, sandstone abraders, milling stones, manos, shell
pendants, and ocher. Ceramics were initially lumped into a
single type, Goose Creek~ characterized by sandy paste. Later
recognized were San Jacinto (Aten 1967), a grog-tempered ware,
and bone-tempered pottery sometimes referred to as Leon Plain
or Orcoquisaa Plain (Ambler 1970).
More recently, the Late Prehistoric record for the
Galveston Bay region has been further elaborated and refined on
the basis of data generated during archeological investigations
at Cedar Bayou (Ambler 1967), the Jamison site (Aten 1967),
sites in the Wallisville Reservoir (Shafer 1966; Ambler 1970,
1973; Gilmore 1974; Dillehay 1975}, and at the Dow-Cleaver site
(Aten 1971}. Out of these studies has come an increasing aware­

ALLENS CREEK

14

ness that the Late Prehistoric record for the region is much
'more complex than was originally suspected. Aten and Bo11ich
(1969) have produced a ceramic chronology for the Sabine Lake
and Galveston Bay areas representing the first attempt at a
relative ordering of Late Prehistoric manifestations on a
regional basis. Their findings tentatively demonstrate a
" . . . barrier resulting in substantial cultural lag . . . "
between Sabine Lake and Galveston Bay (Aten and Bo11ich 1969:
256) as indicated by the abundance of grog-tempered pottery in
the Sabine Lake sequence which does not appear until much later
in the Galveston Bay sequence. The Sabine Lake ceramic chron­
ology is also correlated with the Lower Mississippi Valley
sequence.
ROCKPORT FOCUS
Southeast along the coast from Allens Creek, beginning in
the area adjacent to Matagorda Bay and extending southward to
the Nueces River, are Late Prehistoric remains assigned to the
Rockport Focus (Suhm, Krieger and Jelks 1954). The artifact
assemblage characterizing this focus differs only slightly from
the Galveston Bay assemblage. The major distinguishing element
of the assemblage is an asphaltum-coated pottery known as Rock­
port ware.
It is the distribution of Rockport pottery through
the region that defines the boundaries of the focus. Also dis­
tinguishing the Rockport Focus from the Galveston Bay Focus are
Matamoros and Catan dart pOints and a greater number and variety
of marine shell artifacts.
Late Prehistoric remains recovered at A11ens Creek show
strong similarities to assemblages from Galveston Bay. The
location of the A11ens Creek study area at a significant dis­
tance inland provides the opportunity for useful comparison and
contrast with coastal manifestations.
Historic Period
As defined by Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks (1954: 20), the
Historic Stage
. . . is used to embrace all remains
associated with objects of European or
modern American origin, such as metal, glass,
porcelain, etc.
indicating direct or indirect contact between the Indian and the
European.
This, however, was seldom the first such
contact, for many of the earlier explorers

THE REGIONAL SEQUENCE

15

passed through certain areas, meeting and
conversing with the Indians, obtaining food
and travel directions from them, claiming
the area in the name of their king, and so
on, but leaving practically nothing among
them that can Be recovered by archeologists
(Suhm, Krieger and Jelks 1954: 21).
.
The first documented encounter of Texas Indians with
Europeans was in 1528 when a Spanish force was snipwrecked on
the Texas coast~ Among four survivors of this original group of
300 was Alvar Nu~ez Cabeza de Vaca; the narrative of his exper­
iences, entitled La ReZaaion (Covey 1961), provides the earliest
written account of Indian life in Texas.
Over the 350 year period subsequent to de Vaca's initial
contact, other European explorers, Spanish missionaries, and
early Anglo settlers recorded bits and pieces of information
concerning the territorial range and culture of Indians
encountered along the l.ittoral and interior regions of Texas.
Utilizing data collected from these various sources, ethno­
historic investigators such as Gatschet (1891), Schaedel (1949),
Sjoberg (1953)~ and Newcomb (1961) have produced comprehensive
cultural studies of aboriginal groups inhabiting central and
coastal Texas from the early 1500's up to the mid-1800's.
The ethnohistor1es contain information concerning terri­
torial ranges, types of shelter,tool assemblages, social
organization, language. and religion, and have provided
excellent frameworks within which to consider the archeological
remains recovered from Late Prehistoric and Historic aboriginal
sites. Excavations at Presidio San Augustine de Ahumada
(Tunnell and Ambler 1967) and the San Xavier Missions (Gilmore
1969}, both known locations of historic aboriginal activity,
provide excellent examples of the application of ethnohistoric
data to archeological context. Results of archeological inves­
tigations have in turn been used to elaborate the ethnohistoric
record which, though extensive, is nevertheless' incomplete.
There are no records of Indian groups inhabiting the
immediate vicinity of the Allens Creek study area, but the
region generally surrounding is known to have been within the
historic ranges of the Tonkawa, th& Karankawa, and possibly the
Atakapa. Aside from artifacts of European origin, the material
remains of these Historic groups are virtually identical to
assemblages characterizing Late Prehistoric cultures of the coast
and interior.
Suhm (1957) and Jelks (1962) have suggested that the pre­
histofic complex known as the Toyah Fo~us was represented in
the Historic Stage by the Tonkawa Indians. Likewise, the
historic Karankawas have been linked to prehistoric remains of
the Rockport Focus (Campbell 1958). The prehistoric Galveston
Bay Focus assemblage has not been definitely connected with

16

JtLLENS CREEK

either the Atakapa or the Karankawa groups known to have
inhabited the area during historic times, but such a connection
1s probable.
Though none of the archeological materials recovered at
Allens Creek definitely correlate with historic aboriginal
activity. the possibility that some of the remains do
represent historic occupations cannot be comp1etely ruled out.

THE NATURAL SETTING

17

THE CONTEMPORARY .NATURAL SETTI.NG
Geol~gy

Geologic processes affecting t~e setting at Allens Creek
may be traced hack to the beginning of the Pleistocene ice age.
From one million years B.P. to 18,000 years B.P., four major
glacial advances and retreats toot place. During periods of ad­
vance, the sea level dropped as huge amounts of water were
trapped in glaciers accumulating on the continents. Lower sea
levels resulted in increased g~adients; Texas rivers became
entrenched and broad, cutting deep valleys. As the glaciers
retreated, sea levels rose, gradients decreased, and the rivers
began depositing tremendous amounts of suspended mud and sand,
transported from the inland regions of Texas, into their coastal
valleys and embayments (Bernard and LeBlanc 1965).
Over thousands of years during these depositional cycles,
the meandering rivers built point bars of sand and gravel and
flood plains of mud and silt w~ich gradually coalesced into
broad, low deltaic plains. In Texas, the earliest of these
Pleistocene plains is known as the Willis Formation. In suc~
ceeding glacial and interglacial stages, cycles of valley cutting
and alluviation resulted in the deposition of three additional
geologic formations known, from oldest to youngest, as the
Lissie, Montgomery, and Beaumont. These overlapping formations,
along with Holocene deposits, comprise a series of seaward­
inclined surfaces which parallel the present coastline, forming
the coastal plain of Texas.
The present-day configuration of landforms at Allens Creek
has been influenced largely by events taking place during the
last 60,000 years. A final glacial advance, the Late Wisconsin,
began roughly 60,000 years B.P. Sea levels along the Texas
coast dropped an estimated 450 feet below their present elevation
(Fisher and others 1972), and the Brazos River cut a valley
through the Pleistocene Beaumont and Montgomery formations into
underlying Tertiary deposits l • At about 18,000 B.P., the Late
Wisconsin glaciers began retreating. The sea level gradually
rose and, by 4,500 B.P., had achieved its present day level.
Minor fluctuations, never greater than 15 feet in magnitude,
have occurred during the subsequent 4,500 year period (Bernard
and others 1970). As the sea level rose, gradients decreased and
the Brazos valley began filling with Holocene deposits, a pro­
cess which coatinues today.

1
In the immediate area of the ACNGS site, the early pletsto­
cene Lissie and Willis formations were removed entirely during
previous erosional stages (Fig. 2).

18

ALLENS CREEK

Physiography, Soils, and General Vegetation
The basic landform expressions resulting from the past
million years of geologic activity at A11ens Creek include a
portion of the coastal plain (prairie), a pronounced meander
scar (b1uff1ine), a large area of flood plain, the Brazos River,
and Al1ens Creek (see Fig. 3).
THE PRAIRIE
Prairie lands extending out from the north, south, and west
sides of the project area are a part of the relatively feature­
less Texas coastal plain consisting of the eroded surfaces of
the Pleistocene alluvial formations discussed above. Westward
from the edge of the Brazos River valley, these formations out­
crop in successively older bands which roughly parallel the
course of the valley. The otherwise-unbroken surface of the
flat to gently-rolling plain is dissected by well-entrenched
creeks and their tributaries.
Soil developments on the prairie include clay and clay
loam of the Lake Charles-Bernard association on the north and
south sides of the meander scar,and sandy loam and clay loam of
the KatY-Edna association on the west side. The clays and clay
loams in both of these soil groups contain a high percentage of
montmorillonite and are subject to high shrink~swel1 rates. As
a result, cracks up to four inches wide and five feet deep can
develop (Gustavson 1975: 14).
Contraction and expansion of these soils
bring about a slow churning of the whole
so11 mass to the depth of the fissures.
Thus the so11 is gradually overturned to
some depth and is said to 'plow itself' or
to be 'self-mu1ching' or 'self-swallowing'
(Dames and Moore 1975: 2.2-27) ..
The effect of this natural churning on archeological resources
is a factor to be considered, particularly in later discussions
of site 41 AU 38.
Early historic travelers characterized the climax vege­
tation of the prairie as a vast expanse of tall grass broken by
occasional motts of trees. The A11ens Creek area is on the Gulf
Prairie just south of the interface between the Gulf Prairie
and Post Oak Savannah vegetational areas. On this prairie,
sandy soils support an oak-hickory forest which included post
oaks (Quercus steZZata), blackjack oaks (Quercus mariZandiaa) ,
and hickory (Carya sp.) (Gould 1969). Clay soils originally
supported tall grasses including the dominant species little
b1uestem (Sahizaahyrium scoparium) and Indiangrass (Sorghastrum

avenaaeum). Except for widely scattered hay meadows, the tall
grass prairie has been converted to farmland and short grass
pasturage (Dames and Moore 1975: 1.1-1).

THE BLUFFLINE
The major topographic feature in the Allens Creek project
area is a roughly U-shaped bluffline trending southwest from the
present course of the Brazos (Figs. 1 and 2). Offering from
eight to eighteen meters of relief, the bluff marks the abrupt
transition from the flat prairie to the flood plain. The dis­
tance to the Brazos varies from one-quarter kilometer to six
kilometers, depending upon the particular location along the
bluff.
.
The bluff is characterized as
. . . a large meander scar on a recent flood
plain of the Brazos River between the river and
the Beaumont surface (Dames and Moore 1974).
As the formation of the bluff was taking place, the river cut
completely through the Pleistocene Beaumont and Montgomery
formations down into the Pliocene Goliad Formation. The void
created as these formations were eroded away was later filled to
the present flood plain elevation by Holocene deposits. This
Holocene fill has covered all exposures of the Goliad and most
of the Montgomery. Contemporary surface expressions of the
bluff are composed almost exclusively of Holocene alluvium and
Beaumont clay.
At num~rous points along the bluff in the project area,
minor drainage gullies channel runoff water from the prairie
uplands to the flood plain and river below. Where these
erosional features intersect the bluff/flood plain contact,
. . . accumulations of slopewash debris
(colluvium) resulting from erosion of the
Beaumont and Recent alluvial formations.
(Dames and Moore 1974)
have developed. These outwash deposits partially fill the
drainages through which they are funneled and then spread out
in delta-like fans on the flood plain below. Association of
prehistoric cultural remains with deposits in these gullies is
common in the area. Correlation of these remains to the gradual
accumulation of colluvial deposits is amply demonstrated by the
findings at sites 41 AU 36 and 41 AU 37.
The drainage gullies are believed to have developed as the
Brazos swung into the huge meander that cut the bluff into the
western side of the valley. A contemporary example of active
gully formation is seen just downstream from the project area

22

ALLENS CREEK

where the river cuts into the upland pralrle. Where the cutting
edges of the river meanders hit the valley wall, large, deep
gullies are developing as water draining off the prairie seeks
its base level, the Brazos River, down an extremely steep, short
gradient. The project area gullies are thought to be products
of the same processes. As the Brazos gradually moved away from
the bluff and the elevation of the flood plain increased, the
gradient from prairie to river decreased and the gullies began
to fill with colluvium.
Bounded by farmland and pasture, the bluffline is seen in
aerial photographs as a narrow, wooded strip separating the
prairie from the flood plain. Though some sections of the bluff
have been cleared, most remain covered with trees and understory
because the slope is steep enough to prevent practical use of
the land. Allens Creek and ~ther lesser drainages .breaking
through the bluff are also wooded, the vegetation often follow­
ing the drainages for a good distance back up onto the prairie.
Trees common to these areas are water oak (Queraus nigra),
cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia), and Texas sugarberry (Celtis
laevigata); a less common species is pecan (Carya illinoensis).
Typical shrubs and understory include yaupon (Ile~ vomitoria),

(Urtica ahamaedryoides), bedstraw (Galium aparine) , and Cherokee
sedge (Care~ aherokeensis) (Dames and Moore 1975).
THE FLOOD PLAIN
The Brazos River flood plain constitutes by far the great­
est portion of the project area. It is important to note that
the configuration of the flood plain is constantly changing as a
result of natural processes and has been significantly altered
by man during historic times. The Brazos River is now in a
depositional cycle and is filling its valley with sediments. In
an unaltered river/flood plain system, meandering and flooding
of the river would result in the creation of natural levees,
back-swamps, marshes, and abandoned channels forming sloughs and
oxbow lakes. At the same time, depositi~n of sediment loads on
the plain during flood stages would gradually raise the
elevation of the plain.
Now, however, dams regulating the flow of water down the
Brazos River have greatly diminished the frequency and intensity
of floods. This, combined with changes wrought by grazing
domestic animals, brush clearance, land levelling, draining of
swamps and marshes, and agriculture, has substantially altered
the flood plain to the extent that it no longer fully resembles
the prehistoric plain.
Soils on the flood plain include Ships clay to silty clay
loam and the Roebuck clays. The Ships series, found over most
of the bottomland, is level, deep, fine-textured, and slowly
permeable. The Roebuck series, which has a high clay content

THE NATURAL SETTING

and is almost impermeable, is restricted to filled-in oxbows.
Low, swampy areas are characteristic of the Roebuck (Dames and
Moore 1975: 2.2-61).
Though there is little specific descriptive information
concerning climax vegetational patterns in the lower Brazos
flood plain, there are many brief references to the appearance
of the river valleys crossed in the Texas coastal region by
early European explorers {Inglis 1964}. In these descriptions,
the valleys are generally characterized as being "well timbered";
pecan, oak, and elm were often mentioned as the major consti­
tuents of the forests. Frequent references were made to the
abrupt transition from dense woodland in the valleys to open
grasslands on the prairies above.
A considerable area of the flood plain at the ACNGS site
has been cleared of brush and trees for agricultural purposes.
Several large tracts of riparian woodland do remain, however,
and provide a good illustration of how the undisturbed flood
plain might once have looked. A very common tree in these areas
is the cedar elm; lesser numbers of sugarberry and water oak
also occur. Groves of pecan trees are found in several places
and single trees are scattered randomly about the plain. Black
snakeroot (SaniauZa aanadensis) , scarlet pimpernel (AnagaZZis
arvensis), water smartweed (Pepsiaapia punatata) , sedges (Care~
aherokeensis), and groundsel (Seneaio imparipinnatus) are
elements comprising the understory (Dames and Moore 1975).
THE RIVER
The Brazos River rises in eastern New Mexico, flows south­
eastward through Texas, and empties into the Gulf ~f Mexico near
Freeport. Once a very dynamic and powerful river, the Brazos
has gradually been tamed through construction of dams on her
channel and larger tributaries. Prior to the construction of
these dams, the velocity and volume of flow down the river, com­
bined with lower regional gradients, resulted in a river subject
to major channel movements. A glimpse at topographic maps
covering the river valley as it passes through Austin County
readily shows remnant channel scars of this past meander
activity along either side of the present-day channel. Though
still actively cutting, the Brazos today is not nearly as
capable of affecting drastic changes as it onc~ was.
The Brazos was diverted to its present course approximately
1,000 years ago, at a point several miles upstream from Sealy,
Texas. For a period of about 3,000 years prior to this diver­
sion, the river ran along the eastern side of the valley
(Bernard and others 1970: 8); Bessies Creek and numerous oxbow
lakes are remnants of the older channel. During Middle and Late
Archaic times, the main channel would thus have been twelve or
more kilometers away from aboriginal sites situated in the pro­
ject area on the western rim of the valley.

ALLENS CREEK

24

As a prime source of water, a variety of food items, and
raw materials for production of stone tools, the rtver un­
doubtedly had great influence on the lives of prehistoric
inhabitants. There are no springs in the immediate area; the
river, oxbow lakes, sloughs, and Allens Creek must have at one
time or another served as sources of water for the prehistoric
inhabitant. It is difficult to speculate on the dependability
of these various sources. Allens Creek is now an intermittent
stream, though deep holes in its channel do hold water even
when the creek is not flowing. Depending upon rainfall within
its drainage, the uncontrolled Brazos was subject to major
fluctuations but probably held water even during periods of
drought. Oxbow lakes and sloughs along the abandoned courses
of the Brazos form microenvironments teeming with aquatic,
avian, and terrestrial species, many of which the archeological
record indicates were important to the survival of the
'
aborigines. Periodic flooding of the Brazos replenishes the
aquatic populations in these lakes, making them the sourc~ of a
relatively dependable food supply.
.
Today, extensive gravel bars at almost every bend in the
river provide a ready source of good quality chert suitable for
production of chipped stone artifacts, and quartzites for use
as hammerstones and grinding implements; lithic collections
from the aboriginal sites in the area suggest that the same
resources were available during prehistoric times.
THE CREEK
Allens Creek is an intermittent stream originating north­
west of the project site, near Sealy, Texas. The creek drains
an area of apprOXimately seventy square miles. Becoming deeply
incised as it approaches the bluff, Allens Creek normally con­
tains water but doesn't flow at low levels. During periods of
heavy rain, the creek may run bank-full for several days, its
volume gradually decreasing as flood waters are drained off.
Little has been reported of the age and geologic developM
ment of this creek. However, six aboriginal sites located along
the banks indicate that it was a well-developed feature at the
time of Late Prehistoric activity in the area.
Two soil groups are found along the creek. In the upper
reaches, Och10cknwee loamy fine sand occurs. Deep and coarse,
the Ochlocknwee is representative of soils found in the Post Oak
Savannah. Iuka fine sandy loam occurs along the lower segments
of the creek before it drops down to the flood plain. The
floral community described for the bluffline also characterizes
this zone.
Numerous aquatic species, including large fish, turtles,
and mussels, thrive in the deeper pools of water along the creek.
Assuming that the same situation existed at the time of
aboriginal occupation, the creek wo~ld have been a valuable
source of food.

THE NATURAL SETTING

25

Situation of Archeological Sites Relative to
Physiographic Features
With the exception of six localities on the banks of A11ens
Creek, all of the aboriginal sites discovered during the 1972
survey of the project area were situated on the edge of the
bluff overlooking the flood plain. No sites were found on the
flood plain nor on the narrow strips of stream-bisected upland
prairie between the bluff and State Highway 36.
Though one may intuit the existence of aboriginal remains
on the flood plain, efforts directed at proving such an
hypothesis were quickly reduced to the realm of speculation.
The continuous accretion of sediments over large areas of the
plain would effectively mask any aboriginal deposits. Except
for the banks of the Brazos River, there are no d.ep exposures
of the valley fill. Being outside of the project area, the
Brazos channel was never systematically examined for archeo­
logical sites either during the initial surveyor during the
excavation program.
On the upland prairie, farmers infrequently report scatter­
ed finds of artifacts in cultivated fields. Though there are
probably sites on the prairie, it is expected that the site
density would be drastically lower than for landforms such as
the bluff, and along the creek.
Thus, the sites dealt with during investigations at the
ACNGS all lie along the bluff or on the banks of A11ens Creek,
and constitute the known universe of archeological remains in
the vicinity. Six sites are along A11ens Creek. Of the remain­
ing twenty-six, eleven are in KatY-Edna and Lake Charles·
Bernard so11s on the immediate edge of steeply banked sections
of the bluff. Fifteen are related in various ways to sand­
filled erosional gullies cutting throu~h the bluff where th.
transition from flood plain to prairie is more gradual.
Though time-diagnostic artifacts were not collected from
all of the sites, there seems to be a correspondence of
Archaic-age remains with the erosional gu11ey localities while
the Late Prehistoric remains are found in both the erosional
gu11ey and steep bank contexts. There is as yet no explanation
for this settlement pattern.
Climate
The A11ens Creek study area is located in a climatic region
characterized by mild, relatively dry ~inters and hot, rainy
summers. Prevailing winds during the spring, summer, and fall
are from the south and southeast. With the onset of winter,
wind directions become more variable and are subject to abrupt
shifts reflecting the approach and passage of periodic cold
fro·nts or "northers". The northers often bring sharp, short­
term drops in otherwise mild winter temperatures.

26

ALLENS CREEK

Rainfall is heaviest during tne months of May and September,
when moisture-laden southerly wi~ds blowing in from the Gulf
of Mexico collide with cool, dry air from the north to form
convective thunderstor~s. In late August and September, hurri­
canes blowing in from the gulf produce abnormally high, some­
times catastrophic rainfalls In loc.liz~d areas along the
coastal plain. During the winter, lesser amounts of precipi­
tation result from the passage of "wet" northers characterized
by light rain, drizzle. and, rarely, snow or sleet (Carr 1967).

Fauna
The Allens Creek study area is located in the Texan Biotic
Province (Blair 1950), slightly east of the boundary between the
Texan and Austroriparian provinces. The alluvial soils of the
Brazos and other major drainages " ..• support a mesic forest ... "
providing an avenue " ... for westward dispersal of forest-inhabit­
ing, Austroriparian species of animals into .... the Texan province"
(Blair 1950:101). Interfingered with the mesic forests are
grassland prairies supporting a biotic community more character­
istic of the grassland provinces to the west. As a result, the
Texan province has no endemic vertebrate species, but shares
species common to the Austroriparian province on the east and the
Balconian and Kansan provinces to the west. Blair lists the
occurrence of forty-nine mammals, thirty-nine snakes, five uro­
deles, and eighteen anurans for the Texan biotic province.
In Appendix IV are lists of vertebrate and invertebrate
species identified from faunal remains recovered during the
arcneological investigation.

THE ERNEST WITTE SITE
41 AU 36

Introduction

.­

The Ernest Witte Site is located midway between the pralrle
and flood plain along a gradually sloping section of a bluff
(Fig. 4). The site is bounded on the north by a 265 meter-long
drainage gully and on the southeast by a gully dammed to form a
stock pond. To the south and west of the site, the slope rises
gently to meet the relatively flat pra~rie separating Allens
Creek from the flood plain. West and southwest of the site tbe
distance to Allens Creek varies from 650 to~800 m.; the Brazos
River is 4.2 km. to the east.
Channels from the gully to the north and the stock pond to
the southeast converge below the bluff and, following heavy
rains, their combined flow is discharged onto the flood plain.
The channels of these gullies are lined with large trees and
dense underbrush. The outwash deposits accumulating below the
bluff, as well as the headward and lateral erosion of the gullies,
combine to decrease the gradient of the slope in the area
surrounding 41 AU 36. Here, the average 14 meter increase in
elevation from flood plain to prairie occurs over distances as
great as 250 meters, in sharp contrast to the abrupt rises of
the same magnitude over distances of 30 meters or less common
along much of the bluffllne.
Near the intersection of the two gullies at the base of the
bluff is a small, badly-eroded site, 41 AU 39 (Fig. 4). Arti­
facts recovered from this site included SoaZZopn arrow points,
potsherds, lithic debitage, and some faunal remains. Due to its
poor condition, the site was not recommended for additional
investigation. It is important to note the proximity of 41 AU 39
to 41 AU 3~ as evidence of a possible relationship between the
two was revealed during excavation.
The area containing cultural remains at 41 AU 36 appeared
as a very subtle "mound ll or IIhillock u , but topographic mapping
revealed that the "mound ll was actually the lower portion of a
gently sloping ridge formed by erosion along the gullies flanking
the site {see Fig. 5). When work first began in December, 1974,
a fri nge of dead "goat weeds (Cpoton) roughl y outl i ned the
hillock. It was apparently the contrast created by these weeds
surrounding the barren site area that created the impression of
a umoundu, Much later, it was realized that the goat weed out­
line very nearly approximated the horizontal limits of the.site.
Beyond the goat weed to the southwest, clumps of long-stemmed
grasses interspersed with hUisache bushes predominated. To the
north, goat weeds and short grass gave way to the mustang grape
vines, briers, oaks, and cedar elms clogging the channel of the
northern drainage. The site itself was covered with short grass.
II

30

ALLENS CREEK

In the spring and early summer months, the site was covered with
a profusion of wildflowers - bluebonnets, brown-eyed susans, and
Indian paintbrush.
The ground at the site was pocked with "cut ant" hills,
gopher mounds, and armadillo burrows. A shallow depression near
the center of the site marked a hole into which Leonard
Kolodziejczyk, the former landowner, had once"thrown a dead cow.
The Ernest Witte Site was first reported to the Texas
Archeological Survey by a crew of geologists taking soil cores
for Dames and Moore, the consulting firm in charge of producing
an environmental impact statement for the ACNGS (Dillehay and
others 1972). During investigations subsequent to completion of
the 1972 archeological field r~connaissance, the geologists found
human skeletal material in cores taken from a "s~ndy mounded
area" at the bluff's edge. The remains came from a depth of six
or eight feet with no cultural debris visible at the surface.
"Additional information on the location and archeological
potential of 41 AU 36 was provided by a local resident, Ernest
Witte. Over 40 years ago, Ernest and his brother employed the
services of a dowser to locate some gold that had supposedly
been buried along the bluff by a long-deceased uncle. Passing
over the slope beneath which lay hundreds of aboriginal skeletons,
the dowser's divining rods suddenly went down. The witch con­
cluded that the gold was buried beneath that spot. The brothers
fell to digging a hole that eventually went down 14 feet before
they gave up hope. They didn't find any gold but did cut through
at least five human skeletons which, on the basis of the artifacts
found amidst the bones, they determined to be Indians. Forty
years later, Ernest stt11 remembered precisely the location of
this singularly unproductive "gold mine".
It was known that the site of 41 AU 36 would undergo drastic
modification, as it was in close proximity to the area where the
nuclear reactors for the power plant would be constructed.
Initially, engineers predicted that construction-related
activities would destroy half of the site. This forecast was
later revised to include the entire site.
Systematic investigation of the site was begun when a back­
hoe trench was excavated near the center of the gentle ridge
beneath which the burials w~re supposed to lie. The bucket
began ~tinging up human skeletal material roughly two and one­
half meters below the ground surface. As a descent was about to
be made to examine the expos~d profile, the walls of the trench
slumped, a problem which was to plague investigators during all
subsequent excavations at the site. As far as could be determined
before the trench collapsed, the deposit overlying the skeletal
material was sterile of cultural remains.
The impending project deadline, the apparently sterile two­
meters-thick layer of overburden covering the burials, and the
treacherous tendency of the excavation walls to slump whenever
depths of one and a half meters or greater were reached, were
the three factors taken into consideration as an approach to the
excavation of 41 AU 36 was being for~ulated.
"

32

ALLENS CREEK

It was decided that the most expeditious and least dangerous
method would be to use a large earth-moving machine to remove up
to two meters of overburden from a sizeable area of the site.
This technique would serve the purpose of getting excavators down
to the burial zone quickly without having to worry about the
cave-in dangers posed by high, unstable excavation walls.
On November 26, 1974, a plane table topographic map of the
site and surrounding environs was drawn (Fig. 6). Early in
December, Houston Lighting and Power provided a bulldozer with
a 12-foot blade for use in removing the overburden. A rectangle
20 meters wide (north-south) and 35 meters long (east-west) was
staked out over the central area of the site (see Fig. 7) and
the bulldozer began work. The excavation of this bulldozer
trench initiated the first of the four phases of investigation
that took place at the Ernest Witte Site.
From December 3, 1974 to August 28, 1975, a crew varying in
size from eight to fifteen persons spent a total of 91 work days
excavating the site and collecting the information presented
in this report. Figure 7 shows the excavation areas opened
during each of the four periods of investigation. Areas labeled
"A" and "S" in the figure were excavated almost entirely with
hand tools. It was during these phases of investigation that
the magnitude and potential of the site came to be recognized.
As a result of the initial findings, the site was placed on
the National Register of Historic Places and became subject to
federal regulations governing treatment of such a locality. An
attempt was made to determine the exact extent to which construc­
tion activites would damage the yet-undisturbed portions of the
site. It was hoped that a sizeable area could be indefinitely
preserved beneath the foundations of the nuclear facility.
Assessing the original construction plans, it was deter­
mined that only the southwestern half of the site would be
affected by proposed modifications. Reacting to this prediction,
the rather incongruous excavation areas designated by the letter
"e" in Figure 7 were opened. The northeastern wall of the large,
L-shaped excavation paralleled the line demarcating the half of
the site to be preserved from the half to be destroyed.
Shortly after conclusion of the thi~d phase of investigation.
changes in the design of the nuclear reactor facility indicated
that the entire site area would be displaced once construction
got under way; these design alterations precipated a fourth and
final phase of investigation. Excavations which took place
during the last visit to the site are indicated by the letter
"0" in Figure 7.
During much of the time spent at the Ernest Witte Site, the
approach to the archeology was not dictated entirely by research
needs but more by the exigencies of Federal licensing requirements
and construction schedules. Of necessity, a compromise had to
be struck between an ideal archeological recovery program and
the critical economic importance of commencing as scheduled with
construction of the power plant.
.

Early in the investigation of 41 AU 36, the stratified
deposit of human burials was recognized as potentially the most
significant form of data contained in the site. Considering the
period of time alloted for excavation and the certainty that
what was not recovered would be destroyed, it was decided that
efforts would be most fruitfully expended in recovering as many
of the burials as possible. Operating on this premise during
the final two phases of investigation, the bulldozer, front-end
loader, and backhoe were used extensively to facilitate removal
of overburden from the burials.
With burial recovery as a primary oDjective, the methods
employed were remarkably successful. Few burials were damaged
by the machinery and many more were recovered than would have
been using more conventional recovery techniques. It should be
noted, however, that the technique did unquestionably exclude
certain other forms of data, principally that derived from
midden debris, that might have been recovered had other circum­
stances prevai1ed.
Technical Procedure
A grid system for horizontal control at 41 AU 36 was estab­
lished by placing a stake in the central area of the bulldozer
trench. This stake was designated NIOO WI00 (meters) so that a
zero point for the grid fell far to the south and east of the
site. The entire site thus lay within one quadrant to the north­
west of the primary datum, and grid coordinates increased to the
north and west according to distance from this datum. A survey
transit was then centered over this stake and set on magnetic
north.2 An east-west baseline was set 90 degrees off magnetic
north. Further subdivisions were made using a combination of
transit and measuring tape triangulation. Basic excavation
units were 2 meters square with the grid coordinates on the
southeast stake used to identify the unit.
A datum for vertical controls was placed at a convenient
location on the site surface as the topographic map was being
drawn; this datum was assigned an elevation of 100 meters. The
theoretical primary vertical datum (zero elevation) was thus far
below the site. All vertical measurements were taken relative
to the 100-meter elevation. A true elevation of 41.004 meters
(134.53 feet) above mean sea level was later calculated for the
secondary datum by a Houston Lighting and Power Company survey
team.
A daily journal was kept in which a summary of each day's
2Magnetic declination from true north in this area was
8.5 degrees in 1960.

activities, as well as significant observations made during the
course of excavation, were recorded. The journal notes were
augmented by Polaroid snapshots of especially interesting
features and burials; the photographic scale, shown in most of
the field photos, always points to magnetic north and is approxi­
mately 34 cm. in length. Information concerning all photographs
was r e cor d e din a ph 0 tog rap h i c j 0 urn a 1. For fe a t u res e nco u n t e r ­
ed as excavation proceeded, descriptions were written out,
photographs taken, and a measured sketch drawn. In units where
controlled excavations were conducted, information concerning
each level was recorded on U.T. Austin General Record Forms.
Artifacts were placed in paper bags labeled with all available
provenience information, date of collection, and the names of
individuals who made the collection.
Screening of excavated matrix took place only during the
first two phases of excavation. This material was screened
through 1/4-inch mesh hardware cloth. The following eleven
units were taken down in arbitrary levels of 10 cm. with most or
all of the matrix being screened:

With the exception of Nl04 Wl06 (1 x 2 m.) all of these units
were 2 meters square. In addition, varying amounts of matrix
from four 2 x 2 meter units - N88 W94, NlOO W86, Nl02 W86,
and Nl02 W96 - were washed through flyscreen to recover a sample
of snails and small vertebrate remains •. In areas other than these
fifteen units, there was no screening of excavated matrix unless
warranted by extraordinary circumstances.
In the areas where matrix was not screened, artifacts en­
countered during shovel and machine excavation were collected
when noticed. All available provenience information was re­
corded for the artifacts found in this manner, but these data are
generally inferior to similar information recorded for artifacts
recovered in controlled excavation units and found in direct
as~ociation with burials.
For all burials recovered from the site, the methods of ex­
posure, documentation, and collection were the same. Where there
was no interference from surrounding or underlying burials, the
general outline of a skeletal mass was determined by careful
trowelling. The ground containing the skeleton was then isol~ted
on a pedestal from 5 to 15 cm. in height.
Working outward from the central regions, the skeletons were
exposed using trowels, bamboo splints, dental picks and brushes.
Loose bones, usually teeth and phalanges, were placed in plastic
vials and kept with the burial. When unusual coloration or in­
clusions such as ocher or biotite schist granules were noted

in the burial matrix, a sample was bagged and labeled as coming
from that particular burial.
During the first two periods of excavation, the matrix
surrounding the burials was screened through ~-inch mesh
hardware cloth. Artifacts and human skeletal fragments re­
covered from the screen were placed in bags labeled with the
number of the burial from which the matrix was taken. During
the last two phases of excavation, time did not allow screening
of matlrx except under unusual circumstances.
After a burial was completely exposed, the surrounding
area was cleaned for documentation. Both color and black and
white photographs were taken. A measured sketch with a scale
of either 1 cm. '" 10 cm. or 1 in. '" 10 cm. was drawn. Finally
a standardized burial record form adapted from Sprague's "A
Suggested Terminology and Classification for Burial Description"
(1968) was completed.
The skeletons were not treated wi.th any type of preservative
prior to removal. Each body element, such as left hand, right
femur, and so on, was carefully removed and securely wrapped in
tissue paper . . Each element was then placed in a paper bag
labeled with the site number, burial number, and element desig­
nation. All elements for a given skeleton were placed in a
pasteboard box labeled with the site and burial number. During
the first two phases of work at the site, skull and pelvis parts
were removed in a block of matrix and wrapped with tissue paper.
This proved to be a destructive practice as the bones were
fragmented further by drying and subsequent shrinkage and cracking
of the matrix. In later phases of work, these elements were
removed without the matrix.
Burial numbers were assigned to both articulated skeletons
and disarticulated bone masses. Bone masses occurred frequently,
especially where there had been intrusion of more recent burials
into older interments. Several particularly complex bone beds
were arbitrarily divided, with each division receiving its own
burial number, to facilitate documentation and collection.
At two locations within the site, the south wall of N95
W90 and east wall of NI02 W88, soil and pollen samples were
collected at 10 cm. intervals in continuous columns. Care was
taken to collect samples from directly above and below visible
stratigraphic breaks so that no samples would represent a mix­
ture of soils from two zones. Samples were double-bagged, first
in plastic and then in paper. Provenience was noted on all
collection bags and the sample column locations were recorded
on profile drawings. Fifty-poynd bulk matrix samples were also
collected from each of the zones discerned within the site.
Twenty-six short backhoe trenches were excavated in and
around the site to aid in the definition of stratigraphy and ;
site extent. The locations of these trenches were mapped and
profile sketches of many of the trench walls drawn. Measured
profile sketches of the walls in many of the excavation units
were also drawn when information essential to understanding the
stratigraphy in the site was revealed.

Figure 7.
This figure shows where excavations took place during
the four phases of investigation. Units and areas lettered
"A" were excavated during the first phase, those lettered
"B" during the second phase, and so on. The numbers be­
neath each letter indicate which of the Burial Groups I
through 4 would have been encountered, assuming that burials
of a particular group were actually located in the area.
The fact that the numBers of all four groups are listed under
any given letter does not necessarily imply that burials of
all groups were found, only that tne unit or area was exca·
vated down through zones which could potentially contain the
burials. For instance, the letter PC" with a "4" beneath
it signifies that the area was excavated during the third
phase of investigation and that the excavation only went
deep enough to ascertain presence or absence of Group 4
burials.
The dashed lines indicate the limits of the original
bulldozer trench. The two parallel dashed lines within the
larger dashed rectangle represent a strip in which the bull­
dozer went deeper than the floor level of the original
trench. It was during excavations of this deep trench that
Burials 5, 6, 8, and 9 were destroyed and Burials 7, 12, and
13 badly disturbed. The stippled rectangles represent back­
hoe trenches, some of which were used in composing the strat­
igraphic profile transects shown in Figure 9. Diagonal
lines on the left (west) side of the page indicate an area
where machine scraping without controlled recovery took
place. The purpose of excavation in this area was to estab­
lish the westernmost extent of burial group features.
One additional note that should be made in regards to the
2 x 2 meter unit NI00 W98 (shown immediately above and to
the right of the NIOO WIOO coordinate) for which investi­
gation of Burial Groups 3 and 4 is indicated. On the final
day of the fourth phase of investigation, the unit was ex­
cavated down into Zone 3B. Human skeletal remains repre­
sentinq at least five individuals were exposed and photo­
qraphed but not removed due to time restrictions. These
burials are not shown on the plan map for Burial Group 2
lFiq. 11), nor is the area containinq the burials included
in the delineation of the maximum concentration of Group 2
burials shown in Fiqure 8. After beinq photoqraphed, the
burials were covered with a thick layer of sand.

the archives and collections at The Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory, Balcones Research Center, Austin. Human skeletal
remains recovered at 41 AU 36 and 41 AU 37 were placed in the
collection at the Physical Anthropology laboratory, Balcones
Research Center, The University of Texas at Austin.
Character of the Deposits
During the course of excavations at 41 AU 36, the 2.5 meter
thick deposit containing the site was divided into five zones
based on visually distinguishable changes in matrix coloration
and texture. Numbered consecutively from the bottom of the site
to the top, Zone 1 was the lowest and Zone 5 the highest (Fig. 9).
Zones 1 and 2 contained no cultural remains. Zones 3 through 5
contained residues evidencing a minimum of five episodes of
cultural activity.
.
PHYSICAL STRATIFICATION
Zone 1. This zone represents the surface of the Montgomery
formation, a 75 to 100-foot thick Pleistocene sand deposit. Con­
sisting of a fine, reddish-yellow (7.5YR6/6) to white sand, Zone
I contained subrounded gravel, angular sandstone fragments,
calcium carbonate, and reddish-brown clay balls as minor con­
stituents. Gravels ranged from a very common 5 mm. to an infre­
quent 5 cm. in diamete~. Smooth, angular, poorly cemented
sandstone fragments reached lengths of up to 20 em. Carbonate
concretions were pea-sized and either rounded or granular.
Rarely occurring were reddish-brow~ clay balls with diameters of
approximately 5 cm; these contained small gravels as inclusions.

BuLimuLuB and PoLygyl"a s.hell s w.ere common i.n the zone. A few
small fragment& of fossilized bon~ w.ere noted and some rodent
or ins.ect disturb.ance was evidenced.

Zone 2. A mottled red to ·reddish-brown and orange sandy
clay containing much carbonate, Zone 2 had all of the character­
istics of an in situ soil development. Grading from stiff~
blocky clay to sandy clay~ depending upon location within the
site, Zone 2 formed a thin (40 cm.], continuous layer over Zone
1. Large, crumbly masses of carbonate were common to this zone
in almost all areas of the site. Pea-sized gravels and snail
shells were observed in the deposit, though not so frequently
as in Zone 1.
Zone 3. This zone consisted of a brown (7.5YR4/4] homo­
geneous sand deposit approximately 120 cm. thick in most areas
of the site. The color and texture of the Zone 3 deposit were
remarkably constant in both its vertical and horizontal extent.
Noncultural materials included in this deposit were numerous
BuLimuLus snail shells and a light scattering of small, polished
gravels and carbonate pebbles. Numerous gopher burrows and ant
runs, both filled and active, evidenced the intense activity of
these creatures throughout the zone. The colony of "cut ants
inhabiting the site apparently sought the lower reaches of Zone
3 as the level best suited for carving out comparatively immense
caverns (50 x 20 x 20 cm.) in which they stored mulched vegetal
material referred to in the vernacular as "ant cackll. The tire­
less activities of these ants resulted in considerable distur­
bance of cultural remains in the zone.
lt

Zone 4. Very similar to Zone 3 in composition, Zone 4 was
dark brown (7.5YR3/2) in color. Maximum thickness was 140 cm.,
though this dimension varied significantly across the site.
Polished gravel, carbonate pebbles, and Bulimulus shells were
present as inclusions. Gopher and ant disturbance was evident,
though not as noticeably as in Zone 3.
Zone 5. This reddish-brown (5YR4/3) homogeneous sand had a
texture similar to Zones 3 and 4 below~ differing mainly in
coloration. Average thickness of the deposit was approximately
60 cm. There were fewer non-cultural inclusions in this zone,
snail shell fragments and carbonate pebbles being the only
materials observed. There seemed to be less rodent and insect
activity than in underlying zones. In the upper levels of the
zone were numerous rootlets supporting the plant life on the
surface of the site.

ALLENS CREEK

Structural Integration Of The Zones
Zones 2 through 5 developed, or were deposited, in a large
depression on the surface of Zone 1. The north wall of this
~epression was steeply banked while the remaining perimeter had
more gradually sloping sides. The origin of the depression is
obscure. Its shape and orientation relative to the present
gulley features flanking the site suggest that it may be a drain­
age system which existed on an older, now buried, surface of
the bluff. The fact that there is no apparent outlet to the de­
pression is evidence contrary to the above speculation. It would
not, however, be unreasonable to attribute the absence of an
outlet to hlockage by alluvial processes at a time when the
Brazos River had a greater rate of flow and occupied a course
following the trend of the bluffline more closely (Dr. A.J. Scott,
personal communication).
Zone 2 subsequently developed as a thin, more-or-less con­
tinuous layer over the depression in Zone 1. The stiff, blocky
clay and carbonate masses characterizing the zone, as well as
its tendency to closely reflect the to~ography of Zone 1, suggest
that Zone 2 was an in 8it~ soil development. The presence of
this zone indicates that the depreSSion was an exposed and stable
feature for a long period of time. A topographic contour map of
the surface of Zone 2 is shown in Figure 8.
The cultural remains indicate that the introduction of the
first Zone 3 deposits to the depression was a very gradual
filling-in of the depression by colluvial materials presumably
transported from higher areas to the south and west of the site.
Zone 3 was thickest in the area below the north wall of the de­
pression and wedged out very abruptly against this wall (Fig. 9).
In all other directions from this centrally deep deposit, Zone 3
gradually rose and thinned out. Nearing the ground surface to
the west and south, the zone became indistinguishable along a
"hingeline" apparently marking the rim of the depression.
Deposition of Zones 4 and 5 occurred in much the same way as
did Zone 3. These deposits completely filled the depression
along the north wall and spilled over into the areas beyond.
The configuration of the site was probably post-depositionally
altered by lateral erOsion into the drainage gullies flanking
the site. This would account for Zone 5 being an isolated cap
rather than a continuous member extending back south and west
toward postulated sources of parent materials as do Zones 3 and
4 (Fig. 9).
CULTURAL STRATIGRAPHY
The earliest cultural remains encountered at the site rested
on the surface of Zone 2. Hearths, lithic artifacts, and faunal
remains constituted the evidence for human activity.
Occurring near the bottom of Zone 3, and often resting on
the surface of Zone 2, were a number of human burials collectively

THE ERNEST WITTE

SITE~

41 AU 36

45

designated as Burial Group 1.3
Due to the homogeneous color and texture of the sand in Zone
3, no burial pit outlines were discernable. It was thus im­
possible to determine the surface from which the burials were
placed. Near the top of Zone 3 was a second layer of human
burials designated Burial Group 2. As with Group 1, no burial
pit outlines were visible. Lithic artifacts and faunal remains
were recovered from the fill around the burials and from the
matrix separating the twn hurial groups. The presence of these
materials indicates that activities, beyond burial of the dead,
took place concurrent with the deposition of Burial Groups 1
and 2.
Assignment of hearths, human burials, and grave goods to
the three distinct cultural episodes evidenced at the surface of
Zone 2 and in Zone 3 was accomplished without much difficulty.
Division of remains other than the above, such as chipped stone
artifacts, lithic debitage, and faunal remains, into collections
unquestionably representing each cultural episode was virtually
impossible for the following reasons: 1) the surfaces from which
the burial groups were interred could not be determined, 2) the
original stratigraphic context of much of the material was un­
doubtedly destroyed by aboriginal excavation of numerous burial
pits and attendant churning of depOSits, and 3) rodent and
insect disturbance was intense. Given these conditions, assump­
tion of episode affiliation for an artifact at the surface of
Zone 2 or Zone 3, not directly associated with a diagnostic
feature, was a risk not considered worth taking.
In view of these circumstances, Zone 3 was arbitrarily
divided into two units at a point approximately midway between
Burial Groups 1 and 2. In most areas of the site, this resulted
in units of roughly equal thickness. Burial Group 1 and the
remains found on the surface of Zone 2 were co~bined in a lower
unit called Zone 3A. The Zone 2 surface remains were included
because they were covered by Zone 3 but did not occur below the
surface of Zone 2. The upper unit containing Burial Group 2
became Zone 3B. In subsequent analysis and description of
artifacts and other remains recovered from Zone 3, a position in
either the upper or lower half of the zone is given for vertical
provenience. The gross nature of these divisions should be kept
in mind.

3In this study, a "burial group" is defined simply as the
aggregate of human burials occurring within the same stratigraphic
unit or subunit at 41 AU 36. The term "group" is not meant to
imp1 y any t h i n g, abo u t the soc i a lor gani z a t ion ( s) 0 f th eli v i ng
populations responsible for interment of the numerous burials
found at the site. The term is used intentionally as a means
for avoiding any such connotations. Based on stratigraphic
pro x i mit y, s i m11 a r art i fa c t u ali nc 1 us ion s, and bur i alp r act ice s ,
burials within each group are felt to represent distinct chrono­
logical stages within the cultural sequence, but do not necessarily
represent a single family, a band, or similar aggregation.

ALLENS CREEK

Above Zone 3 was a 40 cm. thick layer containing midden
refuse and human burials. As a subunit of Zone 4, this layer
was designated Zone 4'. The human skeletons became Burial Group
3. In some areas of the site Zon~ 4' composed a visually dis­
tinct dark layer within Zone 4. In other areas the layer was
evidenced only by an increased amount of midden refuse near the
bottom of Zone 4.
From the top of Zone 4' through the remainder of Zone 4 and
Zone 5 only a very light occurrence of cultural remains was noted.
Over large areas of the site this deposit was scraped away as
the bulldozer trench was excavated during the first phase of work
at the site. A very small sample of these remains was collected.
During the latter phases of excavation, probing of Zone 5
deposits at the south end ~f the site resulted in the discovery
of a tight, isolated cluster of buri~ls referred to as Burial
Group 4.
While the cultural stratigraphy was reasonably distinct
through most of the site, the pecu1iar relationship of gradua11y
accumulating colluvium and cultural residues to the surrounding
Zone 1-2 depression created a situation in which cultural re­
mains of the same age could occur in different stratigraphic
zones. For a cultural activity surface at any level through
Zone 3, for instance, there would also be exposures of Zone 2
comprising the sides. rim, and outlying area of the depression
not yet covered by colluvium. A hearth resting on Zone 2, and
covered by Zone 4. could theoretically correlate with any of four
cultural episodes.
Hearths (Features 9 and 10) and nine human burials were
located in these areas marginal to the deep, well-stratified
deposits. Assignment to a specific cultural episode was some­
times very difficult. In these cases, factors such as distinc­
tive artifacts, burial characteristics, and, for hearths, material
composition, were considered in making final episode assignments.
Features 9 and 10 were remnants of the earliest occupation but
were so positioned as to leave room for doubt.
The relationship of cultural episodes to physical strati­
fication at 41 AU 35 is summarized in Table 1.

ALLENS CREEK

As a prelude to more lengthy discussions, the following
information is presented to briefly characterize the nature of
the cultural remains found in each stratigraphic zone.
Zone lA. The cultural remains in this zone are attributed
to activities during the Middle Archaic. Radiocarbon assays on
bone samples yielded median dates of 2610 B.C. and 1530 B.C.
(Table 21. Unquestionably related to the zone were four hearths,
Features 4, 6, 7, and 8; Features 9 and 10 may have been re­
lated. The zone contained Burial Group 1 which consisted of
sixty-one human burials with grave goods including worked bone
artifacts and a Pedernalee projectile point. Also recovered were
various other expanding- and parallel-stemmed dart points.
Zone 3B. Recovered from this zone were cultural remains
characteristic of the Late Archaic (Central Texas) or Woodland
leastern United States). Radiocarbon assays on bone samples
yielded median ages of 520 B.C. and A.D. 360 (Table 2). One
hearth, Feature 2, was the single occupational feature unquestion­
ably related to the zone, though Features 9 and 10 might also
relate. The zone contained 145 human burials (Burial Group 2),
with grave goods including marine shell ornaments, worked bone
artifacts. deer skulls and antlers, boatstones, corner-tang
knives, a ground stone gorget, ocher, and biotite schist. Five
individuals in the group apparently died as a result of wounds
inflicted by projectile points of the Fairland and Kent types.
Other dart points recovered include Palmillas, Yarbrough, and
oth~r e~panding-_and parallel-stemmed forms ..
Zone 4'. Termed Transitional Archaic, or early Late Pre­
historic, the cultural remains in Zone 4' consisted of Occu­
pational Features 1, 3, 5, 11, and 12; Burial Group 3 containing
ten human burials (one with seven associated Godley points);
relatively numerous sandy paste potsherds; and contracting- and
parallel-stemmed projectile pOints including the Gary type.
Remains in the zone are tentatively dated between A.D. 550 and
A.D. 950 on the basis of the Godley points found with one burial.
Zone 5. Cultural remains in this zone were deSignated as
Late Prehistoric based on stratigraphic position, the presence
of sandy paste potsherds, and the human burial practices ex­
hibited. Burial Group 4, consisting of thirteen human burials
and a few potsherds, was encountered" in this zone.
All of the zones yielded varying amounts of lithic debitage
and faunal remains.
Absolute and Relative Dating of Cultural Deposits
The Radiocarbon Laboratory of The University of Texas at
Austin assayed the apatite fraction of bone samples taken from
four of the burials recovered at 41 AU 36. It was necessary to

1

49

THE ERNEST WITTE SITE, 41 AU 36

use bone for dating purposes, as little or no carbon was re­
covered from any of the hearths found at the site.
The sample~ were taken from Group 1 Burials 127 and 155 in
Zone 3A, and Group 2 Burials 14 and 89 in Zone 3B~ following
examination of the remains by Drs. Rramblett and Malina.
Femurs and humeri were selected due to the dense, relatively non­
porous quality of these elements. Financial limitations
prevented assays on samples from Burial Groups 3 and 4. The
radiocarbon assays obtained were:

The dates obtained for the Group 1 burials are pronouncedly
earlier than the time span represented by the PedernaZes type
in the central Texas chronology. The PedernaZes point
associated with Group 1 Burial 86 would, according to the
central Te.xas chronology, suggest a time span from 1350 B.C. to
650 B.C. (Prewitt 1979). The Pedernales type may indeed date
earlier in the Allens Creek region than in central Texas. A
more likely possibility, however, is that the assays on the
Group 1 burials are inaccurate. As will be discussed below, the
bones of Group 1 bu~ials were heavily encrusted with carbonate,
which may have affected the accuracy of assays on the bones.
Of the two assays on bones from Group 2 burials, TX-2452
yielded a median date of A.D. 360, which falls comfortably with­
in the time span of the Twin Sisters I phase (A.D. 200 to A.D.
500) in the central Texas chronology. In this 300 year span.
Ensor and Fairland dart points are the principle chipped stone
diagnostics (Prewitt 1979). Ensor and FairZand points found
amidst the Group 2 burials suggest that at least some portion of
Group 2 was deposited during ~he A.D. 200 to A.D. 500 time
period; TX-24S2 certainly supports this temporal assignment.
The other Group 2 assay, TX-2451, yielded a much earl ier median
date of 52Q B.C. No chipped stone diagnostics were recovered
with the Group 2 burials which correlated with the central
Texas chronology at the earlier time level suggested by TX-245l.
There is no good reason to doubt the accuracy of this date, but

the available time-diagnostic chipped stone artifacts found with
Group 2 burials strongly suggest that TX-2452 (median A.D. 360)
is more representative of the group. The significance of these
dates is discussed more extensively in the concluding sections
of this report.
The time spans separating the median dates within each
burial group - 1,080 years between the Group 1 dates and 880
years between the Group 2 dates - were not expected. If the
dates are reliable, each burial layer was utilized over a very
long period of time. One line of evidence possibly supporting
the suggestion of long term usage is the number of disturbed
burials encountered, especially in Burial Group 2.
Only relative dating is possible for the earliest remains
at the site, those features and artifacts found on the surface
of Zone 2 (Cultural Zone 3A). All that can be said is that
these materials were deposited an unknown number of years
prior to interment of the Group 1 burials, for which the
earliest date available is 2610 B.C.
For Burial Group 3 and the midden refuse in Zone 4', the
GodZey points associated with Burial 154 were the only poten­
tially reliable time-diagnostic artifacts recovered. GodZey
points from the Austin Focus component at the Kyle site are
dated between A.D. 550 and A.D. 950 (Jelks 1962). Taking into
consideration the A.D. 360 date for Group 2 Burial 89 in under­
lying Zone 3B, a similar time range (A.D. 550 - A.D. 950) might
be suggested for the Zone 4 remains.
No reliable diagnostic artifacts were recovered from Burial
Group 4 or Zone 5 at 41 AU 36. The Group 4 remains are
assuredly Late Prehistoric and, judging from the shallow inter­
ment depth, were probably deposited late in the sequence.
Human Burials
Two hundred twenty_seven burial numbers were assigned to
articulated human skeletons and amorphous groups of human bone
unearthed during the four phases of excavation at 41 AU 36.
Subsequent synthesis of burial plans revealed that six of the
burials had been given two numbers. The actual burial count was
thus 221. Later, through careful examination of burial draw­
ings and application of sex and age data, the minimum number of
individuals represented was estimated (by this author) to be
238.
It is important to note a difference of ninety-nine
individuals between the author's estimate (238) and the physical
anthropologists' estimate (337 - see Appendix I) of the total
number of individuals recovered at 41 AU 36. The Appendix I
estimate (337) was reached by tabulating the number of
individuals represented by skeletal elements in each burial
feature. This method did not take into account the agencies of
post-depositional disturbance making it possible for a single
skeleton to become scattered among more than one burial feature.

54

ALLENS CREEK

The physical anthropologists considered each burial feature
as a discrete unit of analysis having no relationship to
surrounding features. Thus, a burial feature containing one
complete human skeleton plus an extra calcaneus would be
tabulated as two individuals. The skeleton from which the spare
calcaneus was~rived, recovered in another burial feature, was
also tabulated as an individual. Two features contributed three
individuals to the total population count when, in reality, only
two individuals existed. This procedure was uniformly applied
throughout the analysis.
The author's estimate of 238 individuals was derived
primarily through integration of scaled burial drawings into
composite plans of each burial group; figures 10, 11, and 12 are
simplified versions of these highly detailed plans. Using the
plan maps for each burial group, it was, in many cases, possible
to "see" how certain individuals had become scattered among two
or more burial features. To the extent possible, scattered
elements were "put back together" into a single individual for
calculation of the total population. In cases of extreme mix­
ture of skeletal elements from two or more individuals, the
sex and age data produced by the physical anthropologists was
applied, in conjunction with plan drawings, to match up elements
according to age, sex, and proximity.
The two different methods of counting individuals resulted
in the following group by group counts;

The dental arches, discussed by the physical anthro­
pologists in Appendix I, yield information relevant to the
question of population at 41 AU 36. Excluding forty-five
individuals less than 10 years of age, 185 individuals, plus the
forty-five under 10 years old, total 230 individuals, only eight
less than the author's estimate of 238. If the population
estimate of 337 individuals is to be accepted, it must be
assumed that the dental arches of 107 individuals were not
recovered, a possibility the author considers to be extremely
remote.
The physical anthropologists' group by group count of
individuals based on dental arcades, exclusive of forty-five
individuals under 10 years of age, was as follows:

As a result of the ninety-nine-individua1 difference
between population estimates by the author and the physical
anthropologists, the following situations should be noted: 1)
the calculations in the text and tables of Appendix I relating
to the skeletal population from 41 AU 36 are based on a total
population of 337 individuals and, 2) for all calculations,
descriptions, and discussions in the main text of this report,
Appendix II and Appendix III, a base population of 238
individuals is used. The divergence of counts results in sub­
stantially different interpretations from Appendix I to
Appendices II and III.
As previously mentioned, the burials were stratified into
four distinct levels. The lowest was designated Burial Group 1
and the highest Burial Group 4. Typical vertical relationships
of these groups are shown in Figure 13. The horizontal extent
of the burial groups relative to one another and to the basal
zone depression is illustrated in Figure 8. Plans of each
burial group are shown in Figures 10, 11, and 12. Two hundred­
six of the burials are illustrated in these figures. The
fifteen burials not shown include nine for which burial group
could not be determined and six completely destroyed during
machine excavation.
It should be emphasized that the burial plans (Figs. 10, 11,
and 12) are simplified and stylized, and should not be con­
sidered as literal representations of the actual situation in
each burial group. The maps are intended only to provide a
quick visual impression of the cemetery. In serious consid­
erations of the burials the data tables, lists, and notes in
Appendix II should be consulted. The "potholes" shown in
Figures 10, 11, and 12A represent Ernest Witte's excavations.
In comparing the boundaries of Burial Groups 1 and 2 to
the distribution of such burials actually recovered, it will be
noted that burials recorded on the plans do not extend as far
to the west as the group boundaries are drawn. As is indicated
in Figure 7, the area on the western edge of the site was
machine-scraped; during this operation, burials possessing
traits characteristic of Group 2 were partially unearthed.
Time limitations did not permit recovery of these few burials,
but their locations were recorded for use in delimiting the
burial area. This boundary is believed to be reasonably
accurate. The estimated western extent of Burial Group 1 is
shown with a dashed line. This boundary was not substantiated
during machine-scraping operations in that area; rather, it
was drawn by projection from the northern and southern bounda­
ries of the burial group, both of which were accurately estab­
lished. Boundaries for Groups 3 and 4 are known to be
reasonably accurate.

extent of each burial group were as follows:

The fact that only half of the areas containing Group 1 and 2
burials was investigated is deceptive because the burials were
not evenly distributed across the site. For each of these
groups the densest concentrations of burials occurred within the
areas investigated. In the southern and western areas, where
the groups were not extensively sampled, the burial density was
much lower.
It is conservatively estimated that twenty-three burials
remained in the site upon conclusion of the investigation. The
estimates for Groups 1 and 2 were derived by determining the
area of the unexplored portion of the sfte known to contain such
burials and then counting the number of burials found in an
adjacent explored area of equal size containing what is presumed
to have been a similar density of burials. The estimated
eighteen burials for Group 2 include five burials known to
exist in Unit N100 W98 (see preface to Figs. 6, 7, and 8). The
areas predicted to contain the unrecovered burials are shown as
"Unexcavated" in Figures 10 and 11. There may be additional
Group 3 burials in the site but they would probably account for
only one or two additional individuals at the most. It is
reason~ble certain that all Group 4 burials were recovered.
Burial Group 1 contained fifty burials representing an
estimated sixty-one individuals. The bones were hard but badly
fragmented as a result of pressures exerted by overlying de­
posits. Many of the bones in this group were coated with
carbonate, a condition attributed to the fact that the Group 1
burials normally rested on the surface of Zone 2 which had a
high carbonate content. Rodent and insect disturbances were
intensive at this level and disrupted the skeletal remains
considerably (see Appendix II - Index of Post-Depositional
Burial Disturbances).
_
In many instances it was obvious that the Zone 2 surface
was a stopping point in the prehistoric excavation of Group 1
burial pits. This observation is based not on the attitude of
the burial pit outlines, for there were none discernible, but
on the manner in which skeletal remains reflected the topography
of the Zone 2 surface. It was not unusual to find a Group 1

60

ALLENS CREEK

burial for which the difference in elevation from head to feet,
or vice versa, was 30 cm. The difference usually reflected very
accurately the slope of Zone 2 under the burial or a localized
low spot in the zone. The difficulty of digging in the stiff
clay and carbonate characteristic of Zone 2 is one possible
explanation for the fact that the Group 1 burials were never
found in or below Zone 2.
The majority of the Group 1 burials were simple inhumations,
the bodies laid out in an extended position (Fig. 14). For
most burials, heads were to the southeast and feet to the north­
west. There was one flexed burial and one cremated burial in
the group. There was evidence of intrusion of younger burials
into older within the group, but the incidence was much lower
than in Group 2.
Grave inclusions were found with seven individuals in
Burial Group 1. Included among these were a PedernaZes
projectile point and specimens representing Pointed Bone
Artifact Forms 1, 6, and 9 (Fig. l4).
Burial Group 2 consisted of 141 burials representing an
estimated 145 individuals. Condition of the bones was generally
good, though a scattering of individuals were very poorly
preserved. The bones were not encrusted with carbonate and had
not been as badly crushed as those in Group 1. No burial pit
outlines were discerned.
Many of the burials in Group 2 were simple inhumations,
the bodies laid out in an extended position (Figs. 15 and 16).
In general, heads were to the northeast and feet to the south­
west. There were a small number in flexed and semi-flexed
positions, three cremations, and two bundle byrials (Fig. 17).
Intrusion of younger burials into older within Group 2 was
not unusual. The intrusions resulted in confusing masses of
disarticulated bone in some areas over which the group was
distributed.
Artifacts were associated with seventy-five of the individ­
uals in Group 2. For seventy of these, the artifacts were
intentional grave inclusions: marine shell ornaments, projectile
points, corner-tang knives, boatstones, a ground stone gorget,
an abrader, red jasper pebbles, ocher, biotite schist, and an
array of bone artifacts (see Figs. 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, and 21).
Projectile points (Fairland~ Kent~ and Miscellaneous Forms 4 and
10) embedded in skeletal elements of five individuals very
probably resulted in their deaths.
Nine burials, containing ten individuals, represented Burial
Group 3. Bone condition was comparable to the Group 2 remains.
There was less disturbance from rodent and insect activity than
in underlying burial groups. Body positions were predominately
semi-flexed, with the heads of most individuals oriented to
the north-northwest, and feet to the south-southeast (Fig. 22).
Seven Godley projectile points aSSOCiated with one individual
were the only artifacts found with the group (Fig. 220).

62

ALLENS CREEK

Burial Group 4 contained twelve burials, representing
thirteen individuals. arranged in a tight cluster at the south
end of the site. Bone condition for this group varied dras­
tically from very good to very poor. Rodent disturbance
disrupted the bones of several individuals. All individuals
were in flexed or semi-flexed positions (Fig. 23); heads were
generally oriented to the southeast with the lower parts of
the bodies to the northwest. There were no associated artifacts.
An additional nine burials could not be assigned to any of
the four burial groups due to their occurrence in stratigraph­
ically ill-defined areas of the site. None possessed attributes
unquestionably diagnostic of a specific group. These burials
are not shown in any of the burial plans. Specific information
concerning each of the burials recovered at 41 AU 36 is present­
ed in Appendix II and statistically analyzed in Appendix III.

Occupational Features
In addition to the human burial groups, twelve occupational
features were encountered during the excavations at 41 AU 36 ­
eight possible hearths. two concentrations of mussel shell, a
stack of deer bones, and a canine burial. Horizontal prove­
nience at the approximate center of each feature is given in
parentheses following designation of the excavation unit in
which the feature was encountered. Weights and percentage
relationships of materials used in construction of some of the
hearths are shown in Figure 43.
Feature 1. This circular concentration of mussel shells
had a diameter of approximately 20 cm. The shell valves were
stacked one atop the other with the concave (interior) surfaces
facing down. The species represented by the twenty-five valves
recovered were: AmbZema pZiaata perpZiaata, five valves;
LampsiZis anodontoides, sixteen valves; and LampsiZis
berZandieri, four valves. The concentration was located in Zone
41 of Unit N96 W98 (center point: N97.50 W99.25) at an elevation
of 98.07 m. above datum. The feature was not photographed.
Feature 2. Thought to represent a hearth. this cluster of
sixteen burned calcium carbonate and sandstone fragments was
located in Zone 3B of Unit N100 W90 (center point: N100.35
W90.30) at an average elevation of 97.75 m. above datum. The
stones varied in length from 4 to 10 cm. The roughly circular
area containing the hearthstones had a diameter of 65 cm. In
cross-sectioning the area containing the hearth, it was determin­
ed that the feature had little depth. On the west side of the
hearth was a stack of mussel shells (species undetermined), and
small burned bone fragments were scattered throughout the
concentration. There was no charcoal recovered from this
feature. Twenty centimeters below the hearth were the knees of
Group 2 Burial 14 (Fig. 24A).
Feature 3. This unusual feature consisted of a stack of
seven deer bones, five metatarsals and two metacarpals. The
distal ends of all specimens exhibit jagged. spiralling breaks.
The bones were first encountered in Zone 41 of Unit N102 W90
tcenter pOint: N103.45 W9l .85} at an elevation of 97.85 m. above
datum; at this level, three metatarsals and one metacarpal were
stacked parallel to one another with a northwest to southeast
orientation. These bones were all about 15 cm. in length.
After recording and removing this first stack, a second stack
of three deer bones, two metatarsals and one metacarpal, was
encountered immediately below at an elevation of 97.76 m. above
datum. The orientation of this group was northeast to southwest.
Lengths ranged from 7 to 11 cm. One component of this feature
is illustrated in Figure 25A.

72

ALLEN8 CREEK

Feature 4. This circular cluster of sixteen burned sand­
stone fragments and calcium carbonate concretions was exposed on
the surface of Zone 2 in Unit N100 W90 (center point: N100 70
W90.12) at an elevation of 96.55 m. above datum (Fig. 25B). The
concentration was approximately 24 cm. in diameter. The stones
comprising the feature varied in length from 2 to 8 cm. and were
arranged in a single layer; no charcoal was observed in or
around this cluster. There did not appear to be any directly
associated faunal remains or lithic debris.
Feature 5. Mussel shells were the principal constituents
of this feature, a portion of which was exposed in Zone 41 of
Unit Nl13 Wl14 (center point: Nl14.00 W115.50) at an average
elevation of 98.05 m. above datum (Fig. 24B). The feature was
first observed as a thin lens of shell in the west wall of
Backhoe Trench 11. Actual dimensions of the area containing the
feature were not determined, but it is believed to have been
somewhat larger than the exposed 1 x 2 m. area. Two similar
lenses, both in Zone 4', were seen in the walls of Backhoe
Trenches 4 and 14; Feature 5 is typical of these concentrations.
On the basis of twenty-five reasonably intact valves, the shells
in the feature were identified as common pond mussel, Ligumia
subpostpata.
Though highly fragmented and decomposed upon
exposure, it was apparent that the shells were whole at the time
of deposition. Some of the fragments showed signs of having
been burned. A hafted end scraper (see Fig. 248), three flint
flakes, nodules of burned clay and sand, a deer phalange,
several gar scales, two unidentified bone fragments, and some
small river pebbles were scattered through the shell concen­
tration. Relatively complete shells were removed and carefully
packaged for use in species identification and seasonality
studies. The remaining fragmentary shell material was collect­
ed for radiocarbon assay.
Feature 6. located on the surface of Zone 2 in Unit N100
W96 (center point: N100.50 W95.00) at an average elevation of
96.90 m. above datum, this scattered hearth consisted of a
single layer of over forty burned sandstone fragments and
calcium carbonate concretions varying in length and/or dia­
meter from 5 to 20 cm. (Fig. 25C). The area containing the
feature measured 1.5 x 1.5 m. Interspersed among the stones
were 5+ mussel shell fragments; the species represented by these
fragments could not be determined. There was no charcoal found
in the hearth area. Feature 6 is one of the earliest indica­
tions of cultural activity at 41 AU 36. It was overlain by
Group 1 Burials 149 and 150, indicating deposition prior to
interment of the skeletons.
.
Feature 7. This accumulation of calcium carbonate con­
cretions was found on the surface of Zone 2 1n Unit N90 W84
(center point: N90.50 W84.65) at an average elevation of 97.50
m. above datum (Fig. 24C and 250). This hearth is composed of

THE ERNEST WITTE SITE, 41 AU 36

73

a single layer of approximately seventy burned calcium
carbonate concretions, and covers approximately 1 square meter.
Burned bone fragments, flint flakes, mussel shell fragments, a
dart point fragment (Unclassifiable, Specimen 7), and a sand­
stone abrader (Abrader, Specimen 3) were scattered throughout
the area surrounding the hearth. Group 1 Burial 227 lay 2 m.
to the southwest. No charcoal was found in the feature.
Feature 8. Very similar to Feature 7, this hearth consists
of a Single layer of sixty to seventy burned calcium carbonate
concretions. The feature was located on the surface of Zone 2
i.n Unit N90 W90 (center point: N90.60 W9l.05) at an average
elevation of 96.72 m. above datum; it covers an area of roughly
1 square met~r. A pile of highly fragmented mussel shell
measuring 20 x 50 cm. lay 30 cm. to the northeast of the hearth.
The species of the shells could not be determined. Two pro­
jectile points (EnsoY', Specimen l; Miscellaneous Form 6,
SpeCimen 3) were found in the area immediately surrounding the
feature. No charcoal was observed.
Feature 9. located on the surface of Zone 2 in Unit NllO
W88 (center point: Nll1.10 W89.10) at an average elevation of
97.17 m. above datum, this hearth consists of a single layer of
twenty-five to thirty burned calcium carbonate concretions. The
feature was confined to a 70 x 80 cm. area. No faunal remains,
artifacts, or charcoal were found in or associated with the
feature. Burial 218 was encountered immediately above this
hearth; the hearthstones protruded into the chest area of the
skeleton.
Feature 10. Consisting of a single layer of twenty-five
burned clay nodules and sandstone fragments, this hearth was
located in Unit N100 W84 (center point: N10l.35 W85.25) at an
average elevation of 96.87 above datum. The stones were con­
fined to a 50 x 50 cm. area. The stratigraphic context may
have been Zone 4'. but a positive assignment was impossible as
the feature was located in an area where Zones 3A and 38 were
pinching out against the edge of the depression expressed in
Zones 1 and 2. Scattered around this hearth were numerous
mussel shell fragments (species unidentifiable), deer bone, bone
fragments, and two projectile point bases (PedernaZes,
Specimen 2; Unclassffiahle, Specimen 7). No charcoal was
present in the feature.
feature 11. The articulated remains of a dog were recover­
ed from Zone 4' in Unit N100 W92 (center point: N99.80 W92.60).
The average elevation of the skeleton was 98.02 m. above datum.
The dog wa sap par e n t 1Y bur i. edin a pit ex c a vat e d fro m Z0 ne 4'
down into Zone 3B. Near the bottom, this elongate, irregularly­
shaped pit had dimensions of 50 x 75 cm. The dark browri pit
fill containing much midden refuse stood in sharp contrast to

74

ALLENS CREEK

the light brown sand of Zone 3B. Group 2 burials were encounter­
ed less than 20 cm. below the dog. See Figure 25E for illustra­
tion and Appendix V for a more detailed discussion of the
feature.
Feature 12. Feature 12, apparently the remains of a
scattered hearth, was located in Zone 4' of Unit N76 Wl12
(center point: N77.70 Wl13.80) at an average elevation of 98.32
m. above datum. Consisting of an oval-shaped burned area with
dimensions of 50 x 70 cm. this disrupted hearth contained
scattered burned clay and calcium nodules, burned bone fragments
including deer, fish, and turtle, mussel shell, snail shell, and
flint flakes. Flecks of charcoal were scattered throughout the
area. Feature 12 was thus the only one of eight such hearths at
41 AU 36 in which charcoal was observed. Though as much of
this material as possible was collected, the sample later
proved too small for radiocarbon assay.
t

Distribution of Occupational Features
Seven of the occupational features were located at various
depths in approximately 100 square meters of area encompassing
the heaviest concentrations of Group 1 and Group 2 burials (see
Figs. 8, 10, and 11). Features 4, 6, 7, and 8, all hearths,
apparently predated all groups of burials. Feature 2, also
believed to be a hearth, was contemporary with Burial Group 2.
Features 1 (mussel shell concentration), 3 (deer bone stack),
and 11 (dog burial) all occurred in Zone 4' above Burial Groups
1 and 2. It is perhaps significant that only one such
occupational feature in the area was definitely attributable
to the cultural episodes resulting in the deposition of the two
oldest burial groups.
Features 7 through 10 were located in areas immediately
peripheral to the heavy concentrations of Group 1 and Group 2
burials. All four of these hearths rested on the surface of
Zone 2, on the walls and rims of the depression. As previously
discussed, Features 9 and 10 were difficult to correlate with
specific cultural episodes. The fact that these features were
composed entirely of calcium carbonate concretions suggests that
they belong to the occupational period preceding Burial Group 1
(see discussion of ~Lithic Residues"). However, affiliation
with either the Group 1 or Group 2 burials could be argued.
Features 7 and 8 were south of the burial are~ spaced about six
meters apart. Feature 9 was north of the burials and Feature 10
slightly to the east.
Features 5 tmussel shell concentration) and 12 (scattered
hearth) were on the extreme west side of the site, Feature 5 at
the north end and Feature 12 at the south. Both were in Zone 4'.

Oi scuss i.on
THE EARLIEST OCCUPANTS
The Ernest Witte site was initially utilized as a
habitation site; evidence for t~is consists of hearths, food
refuse in the form of shell and bone, lithic tools, and
debitage. This earliest occupation took place within and about
an irregularly-shaped basin or depression at the edge of a
bluff. The surface at that time was composed primarily of stiff
clay and chunks of calcium carbonate interspersed with lesser
amounts of sandstone and clayey sand.
The northeast wall of the basin was relatively steep,
rising more than 3 meters in height over a distance of about 10
meters. The basin's other walls rose less steeply at grades of
about 2 meters over a 20-meter distance. A well-protected
pocket, within which the early habitationa1 activity took place,
was thus afforded. Beyond this one obvious physical attribute,
it is not known what additional factors, if any, prompted
selection of the site as a campground; other possible consid­
erations include the site's location between prairie and flood
plain environments, situation on high ground not subject to
flooding, and location at a break in the bluffline where passage
back and forth from prairie to flood plain was easier than along
steeper segments of the bluff.
Four hearths (Features 4, 6, 7, 8) constituted the primary
evidence for early cultural activity at the site; all four were
composed predominately of calcium carbonate chunks, probably
collected from the floor of the basin. The hearth stones were
placed in single-layer, circular clusters varying in diameter
from 24 cm. (F-4) to 1.0 m. (F-7, F-8) to 1.5 m. (F-6). The
rocks in these features showed the signs of thermal alteration,
fracturing and color change, but no charcoal was found.
Features 7 and 8 were at a slightly higher elevation on the
southern slope of the basin. The distribution of these features
suggests that the focus of activity during the early occupation
was in the deepest part of the depression or basin underlying
the site.
Attempts at isolating an assemblage of lithic and faunal
remains attributable to the earliest occupants were frustrated
by the fact that pits excavated for interment of the later Group
1 burials reached down to the early "living surface on Zone 2.
The burial intrusions created a situation in which materials re­
presenting the two distinct periods of activity could very
easily have become mixed. The problem was compounded by the
total absence of pit outlines which might have been used to
distinguish churned ground from relatively undisturbed depostts.
Given these circumstances, t~e lithic and faunal remains found
in cultural Zone 3A are presented as a single collection, with
the stipulation that they may represent elther. or both, of the
ll

THE ERNEST WITTE

SITE~

77

cultural episodes represented in the zone. The only definite
exceptions t~at can be made pertain to the artifacts found in
direct association with certain of the Group 1 burials; these
unquestionably correlate with the later Zone 3A activity which
resulted in deposition of the burials.
The single projectile point definitely assignable to one of
the two cultural episodes evidenced in Zone 3A was the
Pedernalesdart point (Specimen 1) found on the chest of Group 1
Burial 86 (Fig. 14B). Other dart points found in 3A include
another Pedernales (stem only); one Maroos; one Lange; eight
points from five Miscellaneous Form categories having parallel
to very slightly contracting stems and straight to slightly
rounded bases; and two fragmentary, unc1assifiable points. Also
recovered were two bifaces (Specimens 6 and 7), one possible
knife and a preform; sixteen chert cores; chert debitage; a
hammerstone; a sandstone abrader; and a grinding slab fragment.
As shown in Appendix IV, the bones of fifteen vertebrate
species, nine terrestrial and six aquatic. and shells of six
invertebrate species (mussels) were recovered from Zone 3A. The
bone and shell are presumably remnants of food items consumed by
people at th.e site. Unusual species evidenced in the Zone 3A
faunal assembla~e include the alligator (Alligator mississipiensis)
and the beaver CCastor canadensis). A particular season of
occupation is not obviously suggested by any of the faunal
remains collected, though it is worthy of note that no migratory
waterfowl. such as geese or ducks~are evidenced in the collection.
DEVELOPMENT OF THE SITE AS A BURIAL GROUND
It is significant t~ note that no human burials were
interred at the site during the occupation of the surface of
Zone 2. It may be inferred from this that the early people
disposed of their dead at locations other than in their campsite.
Subsequent to the first habitationa1 activity, colluvial
deposits began filling the basin. Derived primarily from the
uplands, most of the sand was introduced from the west and south­
west. The sand began to accumulate in a pocket as its downhill
progress was blocked by the steep northeastern wall. Concurrent
with this gradual sand build-up was the deposition of four
distinct levels of human burials spanning an estimated period of
5,000 years.
.
Why four groups of people so distinct from one another in
time and cult~re would select exactly the same location for use
as a burial ground is the key to a full understanding of the
Ernest Witte Site. It is submitted, however, that the present
level of understanding, relative to the aboriginal populations
in question, does not permit adequate defense of any presently
conceivable explanation for the phenomenon. Thus, reasons
advanced for th~ repeated selection of the site as a cemetery

78

ALLENS CREEK

must necessarily be conjectural. It. is in this vein that the
following discussion is presented.
More than any other single factor, the sand gradually
accumulating in the basin at 41 AU 36 is believed to have at­
tracted humans to the location for the purpose of burying their
dead. This contention is supported by 1) the absence of burials
prior to deposition of sand in the basin, 2) appearance of
burials after a certain amount of sand had accumulated, 3) cor­
respondence of burial activity in the early stages (Groups 1
and 2) to the areas of maximal sand deposition, and 4) expansion
of burial activity in later stages (Groups 3 and 4) over greater
areas relative to the influx and spread of sand as the basin
filled through time. Further, it is suggested that choice of
t~e site by each group was an independently reached decision
based on very practical requirements such as soft ground serving
to lessen the effort required in digging graves, proximity to
the region occupied at the time a burial place was needed, and
the site1s situation on high ground not subject to flooding.
Site 41 AU 36 met these requirements.
An alternative to the above proposal is that knowledge of
the site's function was a time-enduring cultural tradition
shared in common by all people who used it for such purposes.
Considering the age differences between the groups, as indicated
by radiocarbon assays and time-diagnostic artifacts, and the
substantial differences in behavior, suggested by contrasting
burial practices, it does not seem as if the groups had much at
all in common except for sharing the same burial ground. If
indeed the. groups were sharing in one tradition, that being com­
mon knowledge of the site as a cemetery, it seems as if their
mortal remains would reflect a greater conformity in treatment
than is shown in the burials of Groups 1 through 4.
Deposition of Burial Groups 1-4
Interment of the Group 1 burials apparently began only after
sand fill in the basin had reached depths estimated to range
from 40 cm. on the south and southwestern flanks to 90 cm. in
the deep space beneath the northern wall. Radiocarbon dates
indicate that the group represents at least 1,080 years of
burial activity. However, the estimate is based on only two
assays and there is no guarantee that the samples were taken from
the first and last burials made in the group. Further assays
would likely expand the period of time represented by Group 1.
Between Burial Group 1 and Burial Group 2 was a layer of
comparatively sterile sand that is significant for two reasons.
First, it contained no occupational features or dense accumu­
lation of midden debris, evidence suggesting that the people who
left the Group 1 burials used the site primarily for a cemetery
and not as a habitation. Secondly, whether through absence of
populations from the region or use of other sites for burial

THE ERNEST WITTE SITE, 41 AU 36

79

purposes, the sterile layer denotes passage of a length of time
during which no burials were interred at the site. The radio­
carbon dates from Groups 1 and 2 indicate that this intervening
layer represents approximately 1,000 years of time. However,
the reservation concerning radiocarbon ages expressed above also
applies to this estimate. The number of years represented by
the break between the two groups could be considerably less or
greater than a thousand years.
The period during which Burial Group 2 was deposited began
after influx of an increment of sand perhaps roughly equal in
volume to the deposit predating interment of the Group 1 burials.
Again, two radiocarbon assays indicate that the group developed
over a 900-year span. As illustrated in Figure 8, the area of
both dense clustering and maximum extent of burials in Group 2
increases over Group 1. The number of burials in the group also
increases dramatically. It is not known if this increased
number of burials reflects a larger population, longer stays in
the area, a greater length of time during which accumulation took
place, or merely heavier utilization due to the increased area
of sand available at the site for burial purposes.
The Zone 3 deposits, containing Burial Groups 1 and 2, also
yielded chert debitage, faunal remains, and a single hearth
(Feature No.2) occurring slightly above Group 2 Burials 14, 16,
and 18 (Fig. 24A). The lithic artifacts and faunal remains
recovered from Zone 3A, which includes Burial Group 1, were
listed in the preceding discussion of the site's early occupants.
As previously stated, the intrusive relationship of Group 1
burials into the remains of the earlier oc~upants. precluded a
reliable separation of lithic artifacts and faunal remains into
discrete collections representing each activity period.
Aside from specimens associated with burials, Zone 3B
yielded a hearth (Feature 2) and the following lithic artifacts:
dart points of the Ensor, Fair~and, Gary, PalmiZZas, Yarbrough,
Ponahartrain (?), and Travis types; ten dart points belonging to
seven Miscellaneous Form categories; two unclassifiable dart
points; three bifaces; ten chert cores; chert debitage; an
abrader; two grinding slab fragments; and a chert cobble. Also
recovered from 38 (see Appendix IV) were the bones of twelve
vertebrate species, eight terrestrial and four aquatic, and
shells of six invertebrate species (mussels).
The paucity of chipped stone artifacts, chipping debitage,
animal bones, and hearths in Zone 3 deposits suggests that only
light habitational activities were conducted concurrent with the
i~terment of individuals in Burial Groups 1 and 2.
Zone 3 re­
mains, which consisted overwhelmingly of human skeletal remains
and associated grave goods, contrasted sharply with the habita­
tional refuse encountered in Zone 2 and Zone 4'; the surface of
Zone 2 contained several hearths and Zone 4', which was darkly
stained, contained much midden debris, several occupational
features and only a few human burials. Ignoring the occupational
features, burials, and burial-related artifacts, the collection

80

ALLENS CREEK

of materials recovered from Zones 3A and 3B does not differ
radically from the Zone 4' collection. Though there must have
been some kind of habitational activity concurrent with deposi­
tion of Zone 3, it does not seem to have been of the same nature
or intensity as the occupation on the surface of Zone 2 and in
Zone 4'.
Burial Groups 2 and 3 were stratigraphically separated but
not as distinctly as Groups 1 and 2. Apparently, the accumu­
lation of sand was not as great, or the time interval as large,
between periods of burial activity. A good example of the
relative vertical positioning is provided by the average ele­
vations of three burials, one from each burial group, super­
imposed over one another in the area of dense clustering. Group
1 Burial 143 was at an elevation of 96.62 meters, Group 2 Burial
117 was 83 cm. above (97.45 meters), and Group 3 Burial 154 was
34 cm. above Burial 117 (97.79 meters). These general relation­
ships can be seen in Figure 13.
Unlike Groups 1 and 2, the Group 3 burials were unquestion­
ably interred at a time when the site was being inhabited (see
discussion of Zone 4' occupation below). Group 3 burials were
characteristically encountered tn the dark soil of Zone 4 or 4'
and were usually surrounded by much midden debris. No radio­
carbon dates were obtained for the burial group,so no estimate
of duration of burial activity is possible. The total number of
individuals represented is much lower than in Groups 1
and 2. In terms of distribution, it is important to note that
the Group 3 burials were located not only above the main concen­
trations of burials in Groups 1 and 2 but also farther to the
west and north than the maximum extent of earlier groups (Fig. 8).
With the passage of time, additional sand had accumulated and per­
mitted burial in areas where such activity was previously
impossible or undesirable.
Sand continued to pour into the basin after the activity
period represented by Burial Group 3 and the midden in Zone 4.
Through the remainder of Zone 4 and on up into Zone 5, very
little cultural material was deposited. As Zone 5 became fully
developed, the site probably took on an appearance similar to
its modern-day configuration.
Located at the southern end of the site wtthin 40 em. of
the contemporary ground surface was a tight circular cluster of
burials desIgnated Group 4 (Figs. 8 and 12B}. Thou~h no ab­
solute date has been aSSigned to the group, it was unquestionably
the most recent evidence for aboriginal activity at the site.
The author's opinion that these burials were interred during the
period A.D. 1000 to A.D. 1500 is based on the burials· shallow
depth, and on the body positions of the individuals. The
location of the Group 4 burials within the site is Significant
for two reasons. First, the burials are situated in a portion of
the site where Group 1 and Group 2 burials werentt placed,
probably because the sand wasn't deep enough or was absent during
the period they represent. Secondly, with virtually the entire
site covered with sand and available for burial purposes, the

THE ERNEST WITTE. SITE, 41 AU 36

81

burials were all placed together in a comparatively small area.
There is the distinct impression of a formally defined cemetery
limiting the distribution of burials to a restricted area when
much larger spaces could have been used if desired.
As far as could be determined, there was little or no habi­
tational activity concurrent with placement of Burial Group 4.
Small numbers of chert flakes and potsherds were recovered from
the matrix around the skeletons but the quantities didn1t suggest
any major occupation. Located a short distance downhill from
41 AU 36, the small, badly-eroded site designated as 41 AU 39
(Fig. 4) yielded potsherds and S~aZZopn points suggesting that
it was a Late Prehistoric campsite. Based only on its proximity
and apparent age, it is cited as the closest of a number of
possible habitations for the group who buried the individuals
in Group 4.
THE ZONE 41 OCCUPATION
At elevations of 30 to 50 cm. above the Group 2 burials, a
40 cm.-thick midden layer designated as Zone 41 was encountered
over all areas of the site. The midden was visually distinguish­
able as a dark, organic-rich deposit in the areas roughly
indicated by the distribution of Group 3 burials shown in Figures
8 and 12a. Over remaining areas of the site, Zone 41 was not
visible as a sub-unit of physical Zone 4, but there was always a
notable increase in midden debris at approximately the same level
through the zone marking the surface{s?) of activity. Mapping
of the zone across the site indicated that a shallow depression
still existed at the time the earliest Zone 4 deposits were being
laid down.
The Zone 41 midden suffered more damage from machine exca­
vation than did any other component at the site. Presence of
the deposit was not detected in the early exploratory stages,
an oversight which resulted in parts of the midden being scraped
away as the initial bulldozer trench was excavated. Removal of
some portions of this sub-unit created a problem in defining its
areal configuration.
Occupational features and hUman burials attributed to the
Zone 41 cultural episode were heavily relied upon to delimit the
area of occupation. Most of the Group 3 burials (Fig. l2A) and
three of five occupational features found in the zone were con­
centrated in the area where Zone 41 was visible. This staining,
presumably the result of a higher organic content, and a greater
density of features, both occupational and burial, suggest that
activity during the episode was most intense in an area roughly
corresponding to the densest concentrations of underlying Group
1 and Group 2 burials and to the location of maximal sand depo­
sition within the site. Outward from this proposed central
activity area, concentrations of mussel shell to the southwest,
northwest, and east, and a scattered hearth to the southwest,
expanded the known area of activity during the Zone 41

82

ALLENS CREEK

occupation to the limits of the site (Fig. 6).
Occupational features encountered in Zone 4' included mussel
shell concentrations, a stack of deer bones, a dog burial, and a
scattered hearth. Features 1 and 5 consisted principally of
mussel shells. Also noted, but not designated features, were
lenses of mussel shell observed in the walls of Backhoe Trenches
4 and 14.
.
Several concentrations of mussel shell and the comparatively
large number of valves found in each concentration suggest that
freshwater mussel was an important food resource to the Zone 4'
occupants. It is also interesting to note that the shell concen­
trations all occur in areas peripheral to the postulated central
activity area of the Zone 4' occupation.
Only a conjectural explanation can be given for the stack
of deer bones designated Feature 3. The fact that all were long
bones exhibiting similar jagged points resulting from spiral
breaks suggests that bone tools were being manufactured. Another
possibility is that the bones were broken for marrow extraction,
though the breakage is not as extensive as would be expected if
this were the case.
The dog burial, Feature 11, indicates that the people
responsible for the Zone 4' deposits possessed either tamed or
domesticated canines. Judging from the effort expended in
digging a burial pit, and the careful arrangement of the body,
it seems probable that the animal was a favored pet. A survey
of literature concerning other aboriginal dog burials found in
the region indicates that the burial is not unexpected for the
time period involved. Published data concerning other such
burials in Texas is at a level permitting little in the way of
comparisons (Appendi.x Y-) • . •
­
The single hearth, Feature 12, definitely attributed to the
Zone 41 occupation, was unlike hearths resulting from earlier
activities at the site. This feature consisted more of a burned
area than a definite concentration of hearth stones and other
remains. The total weight of the burned clay, sandstone, and
calcium carbonate collected in the Feature 12 area was less than
1 kilogram. Burned clay accounted for half the weight. Other
hearths at the site yielded anywhere from 2 to 9 kilograms of
stone, usually patterned in a circular cluster. Feature 12 is
significant for two reasons. First, it was the only such feature
found in Zone 4 1 • As intense as the activity apparently was,
it is surprising that more hearths were not encountered.
Secondly, it did not seem to be formally structured as were the
other hearths (Feature 12 did not have a distinct form), possibly
reflecting decreased availability of materials for hearth con­
struction or a change in the way the hearth was being used.
Artifacts attributed to the Zone 4' occupation include dart
points of the Kinney~ GodZey~ and Gapy types and five other .
points placed in three Miscellaneous Form categories: one scraper,
one biface, seven chert cores, chert debitage, two grinding
slab fragments, a perforated rock, two ham~erstones, two chert

cobbles, and twenty-five sandy paste potsherds. The GodZey dart
points and perforated rock were associated with Group 3 Burial
154 as grave inclusions. Zone 41 also yielded the bones of
fifteen vertebrate species, eight terrestrial and seven aquatic,
and six of invertebrate species (mussels).
COMPARISON OF THE BURIAL GROUPS
Some very obvious and some relatively subtle changes which
took place in composition and treatment of the burial populations
from Group 1 up through Group 4 provide a basis for comparison
of the respective cultures through time. Statistical analysis
of burial data, aimed at demonstrating the differences between
the burial groups, is reported 1n Appendix III. Burial orien­
tation, body arrangement, and limb positioning were found to be
the major variables among the four burial groups. Each of these
discriminating factors, as well as additional information not
considered in the statistical analysis, is discussed below. Ex­
panded versions of the data used in this summary discussion are
presented in Appendices II and III.
Burial Orientation
An immediately obvious change that took place in burial
practice through time was in the headward orientation of the
skeleton. Individuals 1n Burial Group 1 were commonly positioned
with the head to the southeast. Of thirty-one Group 1 individuals
for whom data were available, twenty-six (83.9%) had headward
orientations falling to the east-southeast and south-southeast
(91°-180 0 ) . The greatest number, nineteen (61.31), were oriented
to the south-southeast (136°-180°). Only three individuals de­
parted radically from the predominant orientation.
The predominant headward orientation of individuals in
Burial Group 2 shifted to the northeast. Of eighty-eight burials
for which data were available, seventy-eight (88.7%) had head­
ward orientations from north-northwest (316 Q -3600) to east­
northeast (91°-135°). The greatest number, forty (45.5%), were
oriented to the north-northeast (1 0 -45°). Ten iridividu~ls
deviated radically from the predominant orientation.
In Burial Group 3, seven (77.8%) of nine individuals for
whom data were available were oriented from west-northwest to
north-northwest (271°-345°). The greatest number, five (55.6%),
were oriented to the north-northwest (31£°-360°). Two indi-·
viduals (22.2%) were oriented to the south-southeast and
south-southwest.
Six (85.7%) of seven individuals in Burial Group 4 were
oriented to the east-southeast and south-southeast (91°-180 0 ).
Of these six, five (71.4%) were in the east-southeast arc of
91 0 -135°. One individual (14.3%) was oriented to the north­
northeast (1°-45 Q ) .

84

ALLENS CREEK

The shift in predominant orientation from southeast in Group
1 to northeast in Group 2 was an outstanding distinction between
the two groups. In considering explanations for the shift,
placement based on solar alignment at first seemed the most
likely possibility. Assuming that bodies in each group were
placed with heads directed to the rising sun, the difference in
predominant orientation might be the result of different
seasons of activity at the site. If interred during the winter
season, the Group 1 burials would have been positioned with the
headward alignments in a southeasterly direction, where the sun
rises at that time of year. Likewise, the predominant Group 2
burial orientation towards the northeast might reflect a summer
activity period, at which time the sun rises in a more north­
easterly direction.
The direct utility of the above hypothesis was quickly dis­
counted after a consultation with Dr. William Jefferys, Department
of Astronomy, U.T. Austin. With information concerning solar
solstices for the Allens Creek latitude provided by Dr. Jefferys,
it was found that, almost exclusively, the headward orientations
of Group 1 burials fell south of the sun's winter solstice
(23.5 Q north of true east). There is also no readily apparent
correlation of predominate orientations within Groups 1 and 2 to
the nodes of the moon's orbi~ which have maximum ranges of 28.7 0
north and south of true east.
Failing to demonstrate any kind of direct relationship be­
tween headward orientation and solar or lunar alignments, it is
not known what factors were controlling directional position of
burials in Groups 1 and 2. The important thing to note is that
the predominant orientation did change from Group 1 to Group 2.
For the small number of burials radically departing from the
preferred orientations in Burial Groups 1 and 2, it was found
that such individuals were male in Group 1 and mostly female in
Group 2. The situation suggests differential burial treatment
based on at least one variable, that of sex. No additional
characteristics exclusive to these non-conforming burials were
perceived. In contrasting Burial Groups 1 and 2, it is important
to note that males in Group 1 and females in Group 2 were a­
typical with regard to this particular consideration.
In comparing headward orientations between Groups 2 and 3,
an important ob~ervation is that five of twelve Group 2 burials
oriented in the 335 0 to 360 0 range clearly intrude, and by in­
ference postdate, other Group 2 burials oriented in the preferred
northeasterly direction. Relative to all other factors, such
as artifacts, body position, age, and sex, these intrusive burials
are not recognizably different from burials falling within the
heavily preferred orientation arcs. This evidence suggests that
the preferred orientation changed during the later stages of
burial activity in Group 2. Perhaps significantly, the majority
of burials in Group 3 show orientations similar to the twelve
north-northwesterly oriented Group 2 individuals.
A more intensive and detailed discussion of orientation and
related variables is presented in Appendix III.

Cremations, Bundle Burials, and Other Disarticulated Remains
One cremation (Burial 158) occurred in Burial Group 1 and
three (Burials 54, 95, 196) in Burial Group 2 (see Fig. 17A).
The Group 1 cremation represents 1.6 percent of the known Group
1 population; the three Group 2 cremations represent about 2.1
percent of the known Group 2 population.
The degree of bone reduction due to burning varied among
the four cremations. Burials 54 and 196 evidenced the most ad­
vanced states of reduction; the bones were burned so completely
that few anatomical elements were recognizable. Burials 95 and
158 were less completely consumed. In these two cases. some long
bones and skull fragments were easily recognized.
A fifth individual. Group 1 Burial 215, had a perfectly
articulated skeleton deposited in an extended position. The skull
and upper torso of the skeleton were charred black as if the body
had been partially burned. Exactly when the burning occurred
was not determined. but there was no hearth or evidence of
burning over the skeleton to suggest that the charring took place
subsequent to interment. No conclusions are drawn as to the
significance of this unique occurrence.
The importance of cremations to early historic aboriginal
groups on the Texas coast is discussed by Dillehay (1975: 191)
. and Aten (Aten and others 1976: 93). In both cases, Cabeza de
Vaca's account of cremation of a shaman is cited. Based on de
Vaca's eyewitness account. the infrequent occurrence of cremations
relative to other forms of disposal, and the energy expenditure
required to cremate a burial, it has been suggested that the
practice was reserved for individuals holding a very special
position in the society.
No attempt will be made to speculate on the role or status
of cremated individuals recovered from Burial Groups 1 and 2, but

86

ALLENS CREEK

it is important to note how small a percentage of the known
population they represent. It is also important to consider how
much additional effort was required to cremate a burial, as
opposed to simply burying the fleshed body in the ground. Though
no grave inclusions were placed with the cremations, the energy
expenditure required to burn the bodies is, in itself, a factor
distinguishing these individuals from all others at the site.
Two other individuals, distinguished by virtue of the energy
expended in preparing them for interment, were Group 2 Burials
65 and 93, representing about 1.4 percent of the known Group 2
population. Both bundle burials, the flesh of these individuals
was apparently removed and the bones disarticulated prior to
interment. A number of artifacts were placed amidst the bones
of Burial 93; one tubular shell bead was possibly associated with
Burial 65. It is interesting to note that, unlike the four
cremations, there were grave goods associated with the bundle
burials. Whether def1eshing of the bodies took p1a~e at the
site of interment or at some other locality could not be deter­
mined from available evidence.
.
Other than cremations and bundle burials, there were no
instances of disarticulation not in some way attributable to the
agencies of post-depositional burial disturbance listed in
Appendix II. As far as could be determined, there were no in­
clusions of isolated human skeletal elements along with articu­
lated skeletons to suggest "trophyism" or ceremonial offering
of human remains.
General Arrangement
The overall manner in which the bodies were arranged in
the grave changed from mostly extended in Groups 1 and 2 to ex­
clusively semi-flexed and flexed in Groups 3 and 4. Of the
twenty-nine Group 1 burials for which arrangement could be
determined, twenty-five (41% of the 61 Group 1 burials) were
extended, two (3%) were semi-flexed, one (2%) was flexed, and
one (2%) was a cremation. Group 2 demonstrated the widest variety
of arrangements with 42% (of 145) extended, 12% semi-flexed,
0.5% flexed, 1.4% bundled, and 2.1% cremated. In Group 3, six
burials (60% of 10) were semi-flexed and one (10%) was flexed.
Flexed burials predominated in Group 4 with eight (62% of 13)
flexed and three (23%) semi-flexed. For many of the burials,
especially in Groups 1 and 2, general arrangement is listed as
"Mass" meaning that the bones were jumbled and in no recognizable
order. These disarticulated masses are attributed to the
various agencies of post-de~ositional disturbance listed in
Appendix II and provide a good indication of the amount of
disturbance to which each burial group was subjected.

Deposition
The manner in which the burial was deposited. that is
whether the body was laid on its back. face. or side. was a
variable segregating Groups 1 and 2 from Groups 3 and 4. Most
individuals in Groups 1 and 2 were deposited on their backs. a
small number were placed face down or on their sides. A statis­
tically significant pattern revealed among individuals interred
face down in Groups 1 and 2 was that, with the exception of one
male in each group, all were female.
Reflecting semi-flexed and flexed body arrangements, high
percentages of Group 3 and Group 4 individuals were laid on
their sides. Deposition on the right side was more common in
both groups. but sample size was so small that this slight
preference had no perceptible significance.
Limb Positioning
Positioning of arms and legs relative to the trunk of the
body showed some variation from group to group. Arms extended
beside the body occurred only in Groups 1 and 2, that arm
position being the most common for both groups. Arms across the
pelvis or hands to pelvis occurred in all groups and on a per­
centage-wise basis was roughly equal among the four. Groups I,
2, and 3 had small numbers of burials with arms folded on the
chest; Group 4 had none. The practice of placing a hand to the
face was evidenced in six cases in Group 2 and one in Group 3.
The most common position for legs in Groups 1 and 2 was
extended, one alongside the other; there were no extended leg
positions in Groups 3 and 4. Unique to Burial Group 2 was the
practice of crossing the legs at the ankles. Fifteen individuals
were positioned in this fashion. The legs of all individuals
in Groups 3 and 4 were flexed or semi-flexed. Flexing of the
legs did occur in Groups 1 and 2, but in very small numbers only.
Beyond the generally obvious difference between extended
legs in Groups 1 and 2 and flexed legs in Groups 3 and 4, the oc­
currence of extended legs crossed at the ankles and hand to face
positions in Group 2 are cited as the most distinctive limb
positions evidenced among the four groups. These positions are
particularly important in that they constitute one of the few
major variables distinguishing Group 1 from Group 2.
Grave Inclusions
Artifacts were intentionally placed in the graves of seven
individuals in Burial Group 1 (121}, sev.entl individuals in Group
2 (48%), and one individual in Group 3 (101). There were no
grave inclusions found with individuals in Burial Group 4. Five
individuals in Group 2 had projectile points embedded in their
skeletons, but these were not considered intentional inclusions.

88

ALLENS CREEK

Associated with the Group 1 burials were a PedernaZes
projectile point and three types of pointed bone artifacts. The
dart point was with a young adult female. The bone artifacts
were with two males, young- and middle-aged adults, and two
females, a young adult and an old adult. Position of the arti­
facts relative to skeletons w~s not suggestive of function.
Group 2 burials contained the greatest number and variety
of artifact inclusions of the four burial groups found at the
site. Associated with Group 2 individuals were dart points,
marine shell ornaments, corner-tang knives, boatstones, a ground
stone gorget, a graphite schist abrader, red jasper pebbles,
ocher, biotite schist. various bone artifacts, and deer skulls
and antlers. Of the seventy Group 2 individuals having artifacts,
twenty-six were males (371), twenty-six were females {37S), and
eighteen were of undetermined sex (261). Further breakdowns
according to age and sex are presented in Appendices II and III.
Two burials in Group 2, Burial 31 (Fig. 18) and Burial 111
(Fig. 20), were outstanding due to the quantity, quality, and
uniqueness of associated grave inclusions. Both were probably
females, Burial 31a young adult and Burial 111 an adult of
undetermined age. They are considered "high status" individuals
though such an observation is admittedly based on very subjective
criteria and entirely open to cultural biases and misconceptions
on the part of the analyst.
The analysis reported in Appendix III indicates that there
is no statistically meaningful distribution of artifacts between
age and sex classes in Burial Group 2. The artifacts generally
crosscut age and sex categories. One major exception is in the
case of bone artifacts which occur only with adult individuals,
never with adolescents, children, or infants.
Certain other artifact inclusions occur singularly in Group
2 and are thus automatically restricted to particular age and sex
categories. This group of artifacts, and the sex and age of
individuals with which they were associated, are as follows:

Graphite Schist Abrader

The significance of the occurrence of these artifacts with indi­

Positioning of grave inclusions relative to the skeletons in
Burial Group 2 was in some cases highly suggestive of artifact
function. With but few exceptions, the marine shell artifacts
were found in the neck and chest areas of the skeletons, indi­
cating that pendants and beads were suspended from the neck (Figs.
15A, 16C, and 20).

Other contextual relationships were not as directly sugges­
tive of function. Pointed bone artifacts, occurring only with
adults, were often in bundle-like stacks beside the skeleton or
scattered about the chest area (Figs. 15C; 16E; and 19}.A
graphite schist abrader found atop one stack of pointed bone
artifacts (Fig. 39) suggests that the abrader was used in shaping
or polishing bone.
.
Raw materials constituting some of the artifacts found in
association with Group 2 burials at 41 AU 36 came from sources
far distant from the Allens Creek vicinity. At least t~ree
different source areas are represented. The chert for large
corner-tang knives, graphite schist for abraders, and biotite
schist fo~ burial ritual came from the Llano Uplift and Balcones
Escarpment regions, 250 kilometers to the northwest in central
Texas. A coastal marine environment, along the Florida coast,
but possibly the Gulf shore of Texas (see discussion following
shell artifact descriptions), yielded shell for ornaments,
asphaltum for adhesive purposes, and stingray spines of unknown
function. Other materials transported over considerable dis­
tances to Allens Creek were the igneous and metamorphic rocks
from which boatstones and a ground stone gorget were made; these
materials came to Allens Creek from the Ouachita Mountains near
present-day Little Rock, Arkansas, a distance of about 650 kilo­
meters.
Most of the obviously imported artifacts are assumed to
have been manufactured in the areas from which the raw materials
were derived. This assumption is based principally on the much
higher frequency of such artifacts tn their respective raw
material source areas and, secondarily, on the absence of
manufacturing residues at the Allens Creek sites. Imported
artifacts are discussed to a greater extent in following
descriptive and summary sections.
Five burials in Group 2 provide very explicit evidence of
conflict among people living at the time the interments took
place. Projectile points were embedded in various skeletal ele­
ments of these burials and were almost certainly responsible for
the death of those individuals. Of further significance, three
different projectile point forms are represented in the five
cases. Fairland or Fairland-like (Misc. Form 10) dart paints
(Fig. 15B) were found with Burtals 96, 99a, and 116; Burial 164
contained three points classified as Miscellaneous Form 4 (Fig,
21) and another, Burial 177, had two points of the Kent type.
Although their regional distributions are not well-defined, Fair­
land points occur most commonly in central Texas. Kent points,
referred to as the most common dart point type of the Aransas
Focus (CampBell 1960), are primarily a coastal form (Suhm and
Jelks 1962). A conjectural interpretation based on this differ~
ence in projectile point types is that the five people were not
killed by the same enemy.
.
Burials 96 99a and 116 were within the main concentration
of Group 2 buri~ls while Burial 164 was outside the conceritrat~on
to the south, and Burial 177 outside to the north. Whether thlS

90

ALLENS CREEK

distribution was intentional or merely coincidental is not known,
but the pattern of distribution does appear unusual enough to
warrant comment.
In Burial Group 3, only Burial 154 (adult male) contained
inclusions. These consisted of seven Godley projectile points
scattered about the chest area of the skeleton (Fig. 22C,D}.
Burial Group 4 contained no grave inclusions.
Multiple Burials
In a number of instances in Burial Groups 1 and 2, there is
evidence that two or more individuals were interred simultaneously
in single grave pits or possibly in converging pits. Skeletons
were found exhibiting bone-on-bone contact, with no evidence that
either skeleton had been disturbed, a condition suggesting side
by side alignments; burials with adult-child-infant-fetus asso­
ciations were also uncovered. Out of twenty-three cases where
multiple burial is suspected, seventeen involved primarily adults
but also some children, and six involved association of adults
with children, infants, and fetuses. Except for one group of
four individuals, all were pairs. The individuals believed to
represent multiple interments are listed below, paired with one
another as they were found in the site. Age and sex information

In Burial Group 1, four out of five pairs involve adults;
three out of the four are male/female pairs and there was one
possible mother/child pair. In Burial Group 2, ten of seventeen
pairs involve adults; four of the ten are male/female pairs and
there were three possible mother/child pairs. In at least two
cases in Group 2, death during childbirth or shortly thereafter
might be inferred. Among adult pairs, the male/female corres­
pondence in Group 1 may suggest burial of husband and wife. In
Group 2, this male/female trend is not nearly as strong; there
are more pairs of the same sex than of the opposite sexes.
It should be noted that all of these pairs may not actually
be simultaneous interments. It is possible that later graves
could have been dug down to previously-interred skeletons without
disturbing the bones. A new burial laid carefully on top of
in situ bones would make it appear that a multiple, simultaneous
burial occurred when actually it did not. When considering the
Significance of sex pairings, it must be remembered that there is
a certain margin of error in gender determinations.
The one group of four burials, 92a (bundle burial), 93, 172,
and 173~ deserve special note in that the individuals are strung
out in a crooked line with the head of each burial touching the
feet of the next. It appears as if one long trench was dug and
all four bodies laid down in a line (Fig. 11).

Post-Depositional Disturbance
The index of disturbances to ~hich burials in the four groups
were subjected (see Appendix II) indicates that Group 2 had the
most undisturbed burials (501) and Group 3 (381) the least.
Group 3 was most heavily affected by machinery excavation with
501 of the burials disturbed. Disturbance resulting from intru­
sion of later aboriginal burials was heaviest in Group 2 where
26% of the individuals were affected. Intrusion disturbed 12% of
the Group 1 burials. No intrusions were recorded in Groups 3 and
4. Burials in Groups land 4 were heavily damaged by insect and
rodent activity. the percentage of disturbance running 35% ~nd
38%, respectively. Vandalism and wall slumps were only minor
causes of disruption in all groups.

THE LEONARD K SITE, 41 AU 37

93

THE LEONARD K SITE
41 AU 37
Introduction
The Leonard K Site~ located along the bluff 500 meters north­
west of 41 AU 36, is also situated in a drainage gully environ­
ment. The gully was dammed to form a stock pond immediately
upstream from the site~ but this construction appears to have
had no detrimental effect on the cultural remains. The channel
of the drainage cuts down from the southwest and divides the
site into unequal portions; the main area of occupation (Area A)
is on the southeast slope and the smaller area (Area B) on the
northwest slope (Figs. 4 and 27).
Open except for thin wooded strips along the immediate edge
of the bluff and in the channel of the drainage~ the main site
area was covered with short grasses and goatweeds. A dirt road
enters the site from the southeast, cuts down into the drainage
below the site, and dead-ends on the flood plain. The shortest
distance from 41 AU 37 to Allens Creek is 800 meters and to the
Brazos River, 4.5 kilometers.
As at 41 AU 36, the slope from the prairie to the flood
plain is much more gradual around the drainage than in those un­
dissected areas where the flat prairie comes to the edge of the
bluff and creates a sharp dropoff to the flood plain. The com­
bination of lateral and headward erosion along the drainage and
deposition of the colluvial fan at the channel mouth forms a ramp
such that transition from prairie to flood plain takes place
over a 250-meter distance, as compared to 30 meters or less in
zones of abrupt prairie/flood plain contact (Fig. 26).
Named for Leonard Kolodziejczyk, discoverer of the site and
son of the former landowner, 41 AU 37 was found when the 1972
surveyors saw artifacts and skeletal remains eroding out of the
sandy face of the bluff in an area where Kolodziejczyk had re­
moved sand for use in structural foundations on his farm. In
years subsequent to excavation of the sand, he noted skeletal
remains eroding from the walls of the pit and collected numerous
projectile points, a boatstone, and shell artifacts, as they
washed out of the site.
Initial testing in September, 1974, yielded evidence of
three distinct periods of cultural activity. The site was
selected for more intensive excavation due to its clearly stra­
tified deposit and relatively undisturbed condition. Further
investigations took place through the month of November, 1974.
Controlled excavations were conducted on the southwest portion
oft he sit e (A rea A) a s the ext ens ion 0 nth e nor t hwe s t sid e. (A rea
B) was, regrettably, not discovered until very late in the
period allotted for work at the ~ite. The backhoe trench in Area
B revealed a human burial and an intact hearth.

94

ALLENS CREEK

Technical Procedure
As at 41 AU 36, the horizontal grid at 41 AU 37 was estab­
lished by placing a stake in the center of the known occupation
area, and, using a survey transit, laying north-south (magnetic)
and east-west baselines. The coordinates N100 W100 (meters) were
assigned to the central stake. The zero point (primary datum)
for the grid system fell to the south and east of the site. Grid
coordinates thus increased to the north and west according to
distance from the primary datum. Further subdivisions were made
~s1ng a combination of transit and measuring tape tr,angu1ation.
The basic excavation units were 1 by 2 meters (2 meters north­
south), with the grid coordinates of the southeast stake used
to identify the unit.
A nail driven inti the trunk of a tree soutfieast of thi ex­
cavation area served as the datum for vertical controls; the
datum was arbitrarily assigned an elevation of 100 meters: The
primary datum (zero elevation) was thus far below the site. All
vertical measurements were taken relative to the 100-meter
secondary datum. A true elevation of 40.907 meters (134.21 feet)
above mean sea level was later calculated for the secondary
datum. A plane table contour map of the site and surrounding
area was drawn using the secondary datum.
Field notes included a daily journal, feature records, and
level reports. In the daily journal, a summary of each day's
progress, significant observations, and comments were recorded.
Methods of exposing, recording, and removing occupational
features and human burials were the same as at 41 AU 36. In
controlled excavation units, a U.T. Austin General Record Form
was filled out for each 10 cm. level excavated. Information
concerning all photographs was recorded in a photographic
journal. Artifacts were placed in paper bags labeled with all
available provenience information, date of collection, and names
of individuals making collection.
Soil and pollen samples were taken from continuous columns
in the south wall of Unit NI02 W91 and from the east wall of
Backhoe Trench 3 (Fig. 28). Care was taken to collect samples
from directly above and below visible stratigraphic breaks so
that no samples would represent a mixture of so11s from two zones.
Samples were double-bagged, first in plastic, then in paper.
Provenience was noted on all collection bags.
Six backhoe trenches were excavated in and around the site
to aid in the definition of stratigraphy and site extent (Fig.
27). Measured profile sketches of one wall of each trench were
drawn for Trenches 3, 4, and 5.
Upon completion of excavations at 41 AU 37, and prior to
backfilling, a distinctive white sand containing chunks of blue­
gray clay was placed to a depth of 20 cm. on the floors of all
excavation units. The sand is intended to serve as a marker
should the site be re-opened by archeologists some time in the
future. All excavation units and backhoe trenches were then
backfilled to stabilize the site.

96

ALLENS CREEK

As a further aid to relocating the site and existing exca­
vation units, the following construction grid coordinates were
calculated for archeological. grid pins NI00 W100 and N102 W90:
Archeological Grid

21 + 72.53 S
14 + 56.21 E
21 + 61.79 S
14 + 73.88 E

In addition, two permanent. brass benchmarks set in concrete
were placed on the periphery of the site by Houston Lighting &
Power surveyors (Fig. 27). Construction grid coordinates for
these markers are:
.
Permanent Marker 1:

22 + 80.60 S
14 + 99.79 E

Permanent Marker 2:

22 + 43.32 S
13 + 26.82 E

These measurements are on permanent file in the survey records of
Houston Lighting & Power Company.
Of the fifteen units excavated at 41 AU 37, ten had dimen­
sions of 1 by 2 meters, and five measured 1 meter square,' All
matrix was screened through ~-inch mesh hardware cloth. The
unit initially opened at the site was a 1 x 2 meter test pit
later given the grid coordinates N102 W92-93. The unit was split
by the W93 grid line due to poor placement of the arbitrarily
located NIbO WI00 stake from which the baselines were laid. The
unit was oriented on a north-south axis with the aid of a Brunton
compass. This orientation was 4 degrees east of magnetic north
as indicated by the survey transit used to set the grid. These
two factors account for the skewed appearance of the unit in the
plan view of excavations (Fig. 27).
From test pit Unit NI02 W92-9~ units were opened to the east
and west. Expansion continued in these directions for two
reasons; first, it was necessary to increase the size of the
excavation area to facilitate exposure of two human burials en­
countered in the test pit; and second, an east-west cross section
through part of the site was desired. Units NI02 WiO and NI02
W97 served these functions, as well as providing a collection of
faunal remains and artifacts screened from the excavated fill.
The south walls of these units, together with the east face of
Backhoe Trench 3, provide the profiles shown in Figure 28.
The 1 x 1 m. unitNI01W96 was opened in order to complete
the exposure of Burial 7, first encountered in NI02 W96. Unit
N98 WI02 was opened following the discovery of a burial at the
west end of Backhoe Trench 1. Units N98 WIDl and NI00 WI02 were

placed to accommodate exposure of occupational features and
huria1s revealed in N98 WI02. Outlying units NI06 WI03 and
N112 W95-96 were staked out for t~e purpose of recovering burials
which became visible as they eroded from the face of the bluff.
Excavation in NI02 W92-93 was done in arbitrary 10 cm.
levels. It was quickly realized that the deposit in the site was
distinctly stratified into at least three zones. At first this
was of little concern as the zones were apparently flat-lying
and the arbitrary levels resulted in minimal admixture of
collections from each zone. However, with the simultaneous
commencement of excavations in Units NI02 W90 and NI02 W91, the
inclination and thickness of the zones were found to change
drastically to the east of NI02 W92-93. The zones rose and
wedged out to the east while t~ickening and dipping to the north.
It then became apparent that excavation in arbitrary levels would
not produce satisfactory results. Thus, for the block of units
from NI02 W90 to NI02 W93, the attempt was made to dig by
visually distinguishable soil zones as nearly as possible,
dividing the thicker deposits into 10 cm. levels which reflected
the true inclination of each zone.
In Units NI02 W94 to NI02 W97, zones were excavated as
single entities with no attempt to divide them into the finer 10
cm. levels. However, deposits excavated in the area of Unit
N98 WIOl evidenced no definite stratigraphy and excavations were
necessarily done in arbitrary 10 cm. levels.
Deposits pre-dating cultural activity were reached only in
Units NI02 W91, NI02 W93, NI02 W97, and N98 WI02.
PERCENT OF SITE INVESTIGATED
The total surface area of Area A was estimated to be 681
square meters. Of this, 24 square meters (3.52%) were systemat­
ically excavated and 40 square meters (5.87%) were investigated
through a combination of controlled excavation and backhoe
trenching.
The exact extent of the Area B occupation was undetermined
as it was not discovered until late in the time period allotted
for work at the site. However, a backhoe trench of approximately
1 x 12 meters was dug in this area.
Character of the Deposits
Seven distinct zones were isolated within the deposits
containing the site. Numbered consecutively from the surface to
the basal deposit, Zone 1 was at the top and Zone 7 at the bottom
(Fig. 18).
With certain notable exceptions, the depositional sequence
and character of zones at 41 AU 37 w~re very similar to those
found at 41 AU 36. A major difference between the two is that
there was no tlosed structural depression to trap deposits at

THE LEONARD K

SITE~

41 AU 37

99

41 AU 37. The deposits were more simply draped into a drainage
channel through the bluff» spilling down to form a delta-like
fan on the flood plain. In addition, the massive accumulation of
carbonates seen in Zone 2 at 41 AU 36 was not encountered at 41
AU 37.
A third distinction between the two deposits was that, to
a point, clay content increased proportionally with depth at
41 AU 37, whereas at 41 AU 36 a texturally homogeneous sand con­
stituted most of the deposit. This situation is probably ex­
plained by slightly different parent sources from which the
colluviums making up the site were derived. Abrupt facies changes
from sand to clay are not uncommon in the alluvial Montgomery
and Beaumont Formations.
PHYSICAL STRATIFICATION
Zone 7. Corresponding to Zone 1 at 41 AU 36, this basal
sand represents the surface of the Montgomery Formation. The
expression of the formation at 41 AU 37 differs from 41 AU 36
(see page 40) in that there were somewhat more angular sandstone
fragments observed. Minute laminated structures, indicative of
water deposition, were noted in Zone 7 profiles at 41 AU 37 but
not in Zone 1 at 41 AU 36.
Zone 6. This 60 cm.-thick layer of very dark grayish brown
(10YR3/2) sandy clay was exposed only in the south wall of Unit
NI02 W91. The zone was divided into subzones 6A and 6B. The
6B element was about 15 cm. thick and marked the transition from
Zone 7 to Zone 6. It was the same color as 6A but contained
larger amounts of sand, sandstone fragments, and small calcium
carbonate nodules. Zone 6A was approximately 45 cm. thick and
composed of very dense. stiff clay. Zone 6 is believed to be
eroded and redeposited material from the Beaumont clay out­
cropping on the immediate edge of the drainage containing the
site.
Zone 5. A 25 to 35 cm.-thick layer of dark brown (7.5YR3/2)
to very dark brown (10YR2/2) sandy clay, this zone was encountered
in all areas of the site. Non-cultural inclusions observed
included small amounts of snail shell; tiny, well-rounded river
pebbles; and calcium carbonate nodules. There was evidence of
rodent activity in the zone although it was not as intensive as
in overlying zones.
Zone 4. This 15 to 30 cm.-thick layer of dark brown
(7.5YR3/2) clayey sand was irregularly distributed across the
site. It differs from Zones 5 and 3 only in color and content.
Texture and non-cultural inclusions are the same. The zone
serves as a sterile, lighter-colored marker between Zones 5 and
3, both of which contained cultural remains.

3B and the upper 35 cm. Subzone 3A (Fig. 28). Zone 3 contained
less clay than underlying zones. Rod~nt dist~rbances were
common.
Zone 2. Zone 2 ranged in thickness from 15 to 30 cm. The
soil wasa dark. brown (lOYR3/3, J.5YR4/4) sand. Like Zone 4,
Zone 2 was not texturally different from z6nes above and below
but was lighter in color and contained no cultural remains. The
zone was sterile and served as a boundary between Zones 3 and 1.
Zone 1. Zone 1 varied in depth from 65 cm. on the east side
of the site to 15 cm. at its intersection with the south end of
Backhoe Trench 3. The matrix was a dark brown (J.5YR3/2, lOYR3/3)
fine loamy sand. Rodent disturbance was heavy. From the ground
surface to a depth of 15 cm., an insipient A horizon soil
development was observed. There were numerous plant rootlets
throughout the zone.
Structural Integration of the Zones
Zones 1 through 6 were laid down in a gully eroded into the
Montgomery and Beaumont Formations. Before the gully breached
the bluff and began to erode headward, it is assumed that a
massive unit of Montgomery was overlain by a relatively thin
layer of Beaumont to treate a sharp, steep bluff face. As the
gully gradually eroded back into these deposits, it first cut
throu~h the Beaumont and then into the Montgomery.
Thus, more
and more of the Montgomery was exposed while the Beaumont was
continuously expressed as a narrow surface exposure around the
rim of the drainage. The Montgomery surface down in the drainage
was Zone 7.
.
Migration of the river away from the bluff, and a1luviation
of the flood plain, resulted in a decreased gradient. Runoff
water coming down the drainages lost velocity and active erosion
gave way to colluvial depos"ttion. The first material to wash
into the gully apparently was detritus from the exposed face of
the Beaumont.· Designated Zone 6, this deposit was more-or-less
restricted to the areas just below the lip of the gully walls.
In excavations it was found only along the southeast edge of the
site. Subzone 6B, which sits atop the Zone 7 sand, was charac­
terized by sandstone and calcium carbonate nodules in a sandy
clay matrix. This deposit has sand and sandstone like Zone 7,
and the color and carbonate content of Zone-6A~ probably repre­
senting a mixture of the two zones as one was washed in over the
other. Subzone 6A with its dense, stiff red clay was much more
like the Beaumont.
Accumulation of deposits from Zone 5 up to Zone 1 was a

102

ALLENS CREEK

gradual, steady process as indicated by the cultural remains
found in three of the zones. The earlier zones dip down into
the drainage at steeper angles than do later zones, the grade
progressively lessening as the channel filled in. The zones
tend to be thinnest as they wedge up against the sides of the
gully and to thicken downslope toward the flood plain. As the
zones approach the bed of the gully, they become increasingly
difficult to differentiate, due perhaps to the greater possibility
of mixture and disturbance in the channel than on the sides.
These five zones' were distinguished from one another on
the bases of clay content, color, and presence or absence of
cultural remains. There was a decrease in clay content from
Zone 5, a sandy cl~y, up to Zone 1, a loamy sand. Zones 4 and 2
were light in color, the other three were darker. Zones 5, 3,
and 1 contained cultural remains; Zones 4 and 2 did not. It is
believed that the zonation observed in the deposit above Zone 6
at 41 AU 37 was more a product of human activity than any other
factor.
CULTURAL STRATIGRAPHY
The earliest cultural remains encountered at 41 AU 37 rested
on the surface of Zone 6. Hearths, lithic artifacts, and faunal
remains evidenced an activity surface at this level. Also pro­
truding down into Zone 6, but placed there from higher levels in
Zone 5, were two burial pits containing three human skeletons.
Occurring in Zone 5 were hearths, human burials, lithic
artifacts, arid faunal remains. Relative elevations of intact
features suggested more than one activity surface within and on
top of Zone 5, but the homogeneity of the deposit precluded a
division of remains into assemblages belonging to the different
surfaces.
'
Though small amounts of lithic debttage and animal bone were
recovered, Zone 4 was considered to be essentially sterile of
cultural remains. The few materials collected probably worked
down from Zone 3. Zone 4 served as a distinct separation between
Zo n e s 5 and 3.
In Zone 3, a hearth, a human burial, lithic artifacts,
ceramics, and faunal remains were recovered. The dark color of
Zone 3, sharply contrasted to Zones 4 and 2, is attributed to the
high content of carbon and other organic remains scattered
through the deposit. Charcoal flecks were especially numerous.
Lithic artifacts, ceramics, and faunal remains were re­
covered from Zone 1. There were no intact features or human
burials unearthed. As in Zone 3, the organic content imparted
a dark color to the zone. Charcoal flecks were common throughout
the fill.
Zones 5 and 6. Cultural remains in these zones are attri­
buted to activities during the Middle and Late Archaic per~ods.
Grave, goods associated with a burial, the pit for which was

apparently excavated from the surface of Zone 5, are identical to
artifacts found with Group 2 burials at 41 AU 36 (median ages
520 B.C. and A.D. 360). Remains included ~earths, Features 1
through 4, Human Burials 2, 5, and 6, and dart points including
specimens of the Ensor~Travis~ .and Wells types.
Zones 3 and 4. A median date of A.D. 920, resulting from
radiocarhon assays of a charcoal sample, scallorn arrow points~
and sandy paste Goose Creek pot~herds, suggests an early Late
Prehistoric affiliation for cultural remains in this pair of
zones. Also encountered was a hearth, Feature 5, and Human
Burial 7.
Zones 1 and 2. Scallorn and Perdiz arrow points. sandy
paste Goose Creek and grog-tempered San Jacinto potsherds,
and a median radiocarbon date of A.D. 1480 indicate a Late Pre­
historic affiliation for cultural remains in these zones.
Varying amounts of lithic debitage and faunal remains were
recovered from all of the zones.
Absolute and Relative Dating of Cultural Deposits
Carbon samples were collected from Zones 1 and 3 at 41 AU
37. Assays run on these samples by the Radiocarbon Laboratory
of The University of Texas yielded the following dates:

Considering stratigraphic context and associated time
diagnostic artifacts, Sample TX-2125 falls within a completely
acceptable range. Scallorn arrow points commonly date between
A.D. 850 and A.D. 1300 in the central Texas region (Prewitt

paste Goose Creek ceramics in the zone is considered to be of
chronological significance, relative to overlying Zone 1 which
contain~d both sandy paste and grog-tempered wares.
The date of A.D. 1480 (TX-2126) for Zone 1 would seem to
he too late for the two ScaZlorn points, if the central Texas
chronology is followed, but is within reasonable limits hased on
radiocarbon dates from other coastal sites yielding ScaZlorn

104

ALLENS CREEK

points lAten 1971}. The appearance of grog-tempered San
Jaainto ceramics in almost equal proportion to sandy paste
Goose Cxoeek ceramics is considered significant in relating the

chronological position of the Zon~ 1 assemblage to similar
manifestations in the Galveston" Bay area.
.
There were no Zone 5 radiocarbon assays run, primari)~ be­
cause no carbon was detected in any of the hearths from that
zone. A shell pendant and incised bone artifacts, directly
associated with Burial 2, rather conclusively correlate with
Burial Group 2 at 41 AU 36 for which median radiocarbon dates of
520 B.C. and A.D. 360 were obtained. Cultural materials de­
posited in Zone 5 prior to interment of Burial 2, which was
apparently excavated from a surface at the Zone 4-Zone 5 contact,
are presumably older than the above range, but by an unknown
number of years.
Human Burials
Nine human burials were encountered during excavations at
41 AU 37. Five of these were completely exposed, recorded in
detail, and removed (Figs. 29, 30). Burials 1 and 4 were not
recovered, as they extended into units that could not be ex­
cavated due to time restrictions. Two burials, one in the south
wall of Backhoe Trench 4 and the other in Backhoe ~rench 6,
were observed but not exposed; no numbers were assigned to
these burials. The burial encountered in Backhoe Trench 4 was
in Zone 5. Stratigraphic context for the burial in Backhoe
Trench 6 was not determined. Of the five burials exposed and
removed, Burials 2, 3, 5, and 6 were in Zone 5; Burial 7 was in
Zone 3. Burials 1 and 4, ~hich were not removed, were in Zone 5.
With the exception of Burial 2, all skeletal material was
in good condition. The bone in Burial 2 was badly fragmented
and decomposed, perhaps because of the stiff clay surrounding the
burial. The other burials were in sandier matrix; their bones
were somewhat fragmented, but firm and easily exposed. The skull
and upper torso of Burial 3 were washed away as the skeleton
began to erod~ out of the bluff face prior to the investigation.
Burials 5 and 6, interred simultaneously in the same pit, were
badly disturbed by rodent activity.
Burial pit outlines were discerned around Burials 2, 5, and
6. The roughly circular pit containing Burial 2 was apparently
excavated down through Zone 5, into Z~ne 6, from the Zone 4­
Zone 5 contact. The depth of the pit was approximately 40 cm.
and the diameter 90 to 100 cm. It was dug from a surface sloping
from south to north so that the south rim of the hole was higher
than the north rim. The pit was defined by "feel!! rather than
visible indications. The fill in the pit was much softer and
more easily excavated than the surrounding matrix. The unique
position of the Burial 2 skeleton may have been dictated more
by the shape of the pit than customary burial practice. It must

106

ALLENS CREEK

have been very difficult, given the hard, compact nature of
Zone 5, to dig a hole big enough to contain even a flexed burial.
The other burials, interred in sandier deposits, were all
semi-flexed or extended.
T~e pit containing Burials 5 and 6 was 180 cm. long, approx­
imately 80 cm. wide, and had a maximum depth of 75 cm. Unlike
the Burial 3 pit, a distinct outline was visible to mark the
perimeter of this grave. The pit was dug from an indistinguish­
able surface within Zone 5. A hearth~ Feature 2, constructed
sometime subsequent to placement of the burials, was encountered
at the east end of the pit~ 30 to 50 cm. above the skulls.
Grave inclusions were found with Burial 2 only. Associations
consisted of a marine shell pendant similar to the Form 7 pen­
dants from 41 AU 36, a pOinted Bone artifact similar to Form 10
from 41 AU 36, and a socketed Bone projectile point (Fig. 3D).
Specific information and general notes concerning the five
recorded burials from 41 AU 37 are presented following the 41
AU 36 burial data in Appendix II.
.
Occupational Features
Five hearths were uncovered during excavations at 41 AU 37.
Weights and percentage relationships of materials used in con­
struction of some of the features are shown in Fig. 43.
Feature 1. Feature 1 (Fig. 3Il, a cluster of burned sand­
stone fragments and calcium carbonate concretions, was located
in Zone 5 of Unit N98 WI02 (center point: N98.86 WI02.74);
average elevation of the hearth was 96.20 meters above datum.
Rocks in the hearth varied from 5 to 10 cm. in length. Ten of
the rocks were closely grouped in an area 20 by 30 cm.; three
others were found 5 to· 15 cm. south of the main group spaced
about 15 cm. apart. All rested on the same surface so that the
feature had little depth. A filled rodent den was an obvious
disturbance on the southwest edge of the main rock concentration.
Bones of deer and fish, a turtle carapace, and mussel shells were
found in and around the feature. A contracting stem dart pOint
(Miscellaneous Form 3) was found near, and on the same level as,
the hearth. Flecks of charcoal were observed in the fill but in
such small quantities that no collection was attempted.
Feature 2. A hearth (Fig. 31) composed of over 60 stones, '
Feature 2 was partially exposed in Zone 5 of Unit N98 W 101
(center point: N98.55 W101.20) at an average elevation of 96.04
meters above datum. The feature extended into Unit N98 W1DO
for an unknown, but probably short, distance. Time restrictions
prohibited exposure of this portion of the feature. Rocks,
ranging in diameter from 4 to 12 cm. and stacked up to three deep
in some parts, were confined to an area of approximately 50 by 80
cm. The north side of the cluster was about 34 cm. higher than
the south side giving the hearth an inclined or tilted attitude
in cross-section. Whether this configuration was an intentional
construct or a result of post-depositional alteration was not

108

ALLENS CREEK

determined. Bones of deer and turtle, as well as mussel shell,
were scattered 1n and around the feature. These remains seemed
to be most numerous on the north side. Charcoal flecks were
present in quantities too small to warrant collection. The
skulls of Burials 5 and 6 rested 30 to 50 cm. below the southern
half of the feature.
Feature 3. Consisting of a single layer of nine sandstone
fragments, this rock cluster lFiS' 31) was found at the Zone 5 ­
Zone 6 contact in Unit NI02 ~91 lcenter point: NI02.94 W91.46).
The average elevation was 96.04 meters above datum. Rocks 4 to
10 cm. in length formed a roughly circular concentration covering
an area 50 by 60 cm. One animal bone and some mussel shell frag­
ments were found amidst the stones. A collection of carbon from
1n and around the feature wasn't sUbstantial enough for radio­
carbon assay. The feet of Burial 4 were exposed 60 cm. north
of the feature at about the same elevation.
Feature 4. Feature 4 was located on the surface of Zone 6
in Unit NI02 W92-93 (center point: NI04.10 W93.00) at an average
elevation of 95.70 meters above datum. The feature consisted of
a charcoal-stained area paralleling the north wall of the unit
for 70 cm. and extending out from the wall approximately 25 cm.
The feature extended into the unexcavated portion of Unit NI04
W93 for an undetermined distance. Within the stained area was a
cluster of six rocks and several bone and mussel shell fragments.
About 50 cm. south of the stained area was a mussel shell concen­
tration confined to a 10 sq. cm. area. Association of this
mussel shell with the main features is not altogether certain.
The feature apparently predates interment of Burial 2. Only a
small amount of carbon was collected.
Feature 5. Feature 5, (Fig. 31), a single-layer cluster of
twenty-four rocks. was located in Zone 3 of Unit NI01 W96
(center point: NI01.27 W96.33) at an average elevation of 96.75
meters above datum. Small pieces of burned clay, calcium carbo­
nate and sandstone were con~entrated in an area 40 by 45 cm.
Deer and turtle bones and a potsherd were found in and around the
feature. A small amount of charcoal was recovered from the fill
around the hearth. The legs of Burial 7 lay some 30 cm. below.
Discussion
As the sites are in some ways very similar, the findings at
the Leonard K site may best be viewed as they relate to certain
of the stratigraphic relationships and cultural episodes eviaenced
at the Ernest Witte site. The physical development of the sites
and corresponding sequences of human activity are much the same,
but there are certain notable exceptions.
In terms of depositional history, the major difference be-,.
tween 41 AU 36 and 41 AU 37 is that there was no pre-cultural
basal zone depression at 41 AU 37 as there was at 41 AU 36.
Otherwise, accumulation of deposits seems to have followed an

ALLENS CREEK

110

identical pattern. The stratigraphic zones and attendant cultural
remains correlate as follows:

Late Prehistoric Period

Stratigraphic units bearing cultural remains were not nearly
as thick at 41 AU 37 as they were at 41 AU 36. This condition
is attributed principally to differences in the structural con­
figuration of land surfaces existing prior to initial human
activity at each site. Stated simply~ there was a closed depres­
sion at 41 AU 36~ permitting more deposition to take place,
whereas at 41 AU 37~ the open-ended gully allowed colluvium to
wash down to the flood plain with less substantial build~up
taking place at the scene of cultural activity .
. Zone 5 at 41 AU 37, corresponding to Zone 3 at 41 AU 36,
bore cultural remains representing at least three distinct
episodes of Middle and Late Archaic Period activity. As with Zone
3 at 41 AU 36, it was virtually impossible to divide most of
the Zone 5 cultural material into discrete assemblages repre­
senting each activity period, primarily because of the thinness
of the unit. As Zone 5 accumulated,deposition was not heavy
enough to result in perceptible stratification of cultural
remains. Though Zone 3 at 41 AU 36 was thick enough to show
stratigraphy, the severe disturbances caused by interment of
numerous burials destroyed much original context. Nevertheless,
occupational features, and Burial Groups land 2 with associated
grave inclusions, provided evidenc~ of three very distinct
activity periods occurring as t~e zone developed. Likewise, at
41 AU 37 three such distinct activity periods can be recognized
in Zone 5 based on occtipational and burial features.
Four occupational features, all of them apparently hearths,
were found in Zone 5. Three of the features consisted of single
layer, circular concentrations of burned sandstone and calcium

THE LEONARD K

SITE~

111

carnonate concretions. The fourth, Feature 2, was larger and
contained much more rock than the rest. Feature 2 may have been
a rock-lined, hasin-shaped hearth. There remains, however, some
question as to wh~ther the hearth's shape was an intentional
construct or merely the result of post-depositional disturbance
by insects or rodents. Charcoal flecks were noted in the fill
around all four features, but in such small quantities that no
radiocarbon assays were attempted.
Two of the four hearths found in Zone 5 rested on the sur­
face of Zone 6; Zone 6 corresponded to Zone 2 at 41 AU 36. This
evidence suggests an occupation at 41 AU 37 contemporary with
the early occupation at 41 AU 36. The other two features were
completely within Zone 5, their stratigraphic position sug­
gesting deposition during later stages in the development of the
zone. These hearths were built an indeterminate period of time
after those found on the surface of Zone 6 and prior to at least
one of the burials discussed below.
Of four human burials recovered from Zone 5, only Burial 2
could definitely be related to a burial group at 41 AU 36.
Based on distinctive marine shell and worked bone artifacts,
this burial unquestionably represents the same time period as
does Burial Group 2 at 41 AU 36. The pit containing Burial 2
was placed from the Zone 4 - Zone 5 contact. Reemphasizing the
thinness of Zone 5, the shallow pit containing this burial cut
through Zone 5, protruding down slightly into Zone 6.
Three other burials found in Zone 5 (Burials 3, 5, and 6)
could not be related to specific periods represented by cultural
materials and features found in the zone. These burials lacked
distinct pit outlines and had no telltale grave inclusions in
association. Affiliation with the Archaic Period is probable ..
Based on body position, orientation, and artifacts collected-bY
leonard Kolodziejczyk, these three burials are most like the
Group 2 burials at 41 AU 36. However, Burials 5 and 6 are not
completely uncharacteristic of Burial Group 1 (Middle Archaic)
at 41 AU 36.
Dart points recovered from Zone 5 include one specimen each
of the Ensor~ Travis and Wells types, and four Miscellaneous
Form points having broad, parallel to slightly contracting stems
in common. Of all seven points from the zone, only one, the
Ensor, has an expanding stem. All others have parallel or
slightly contracting stems. The dart points from Zone 5 at 41
AU 37 are well within the range of point forms recovered from
Zone 3 at 41 AU 36. Also re~overed from Zone 5 were two chert
bifaces, six chert cores, and chipping debitage.
As shown in Appendix IV, the bones of twenty vertebrate
species, nine terrestrial and eleven aquatics and shells of six
invertebrate species (mussels) were recovered from Zone 5. The
Zone 5 faunal assemblage does not readily suggest a season of
the year during which the cultural activity took place. Anatomical
parts represented indicate that whole animals were being brought
to the site.

112

ALLENS CREEK

Above Zone 5, the thin. sterile deposit designated Zone 4
denotes passage of a period of time during which there was no
cultural activity on the site. The small number of artifacts
and other cultural debris recovered from Zona 4 are believed to
have originated from overlying activity surfaces.
In comparing stratigraphic ~nd cultural sequences at 41 AU
36 to 41 AU 37, Zone 4 at 41 AU 37 constitutes a significant
break not expressed in the deposits at 41 AU 36. At 41 AU 36
the Late Archaic remains in the upper Zone 3 are immediately over­
lain by deposits in Zone 4' termed Transitional Archaic or early
Late Prehistoric. At 41 AU 37, no such Terminal/Transistiona1
Archaic component exists. Instead, the Archaic components in
Zone 5 are capped by sterile Zone 4 and the next succeeding com­
ponent, constituting Zone 3~ is assigned to the early years of
the Late Prehistor1c Period.
Zone 3 contained one occupational feature (Feature 5) and
one human burial. The hearth was a small. single layer rock
cluster having a diameter of 40 to 45 cm. Only a small number of
charcoal flecks were collected from the feature.
Burial 7 is assumed to have been interred during depositon
of Zone 3 as it was completely contained within the zone and no
pit outline could be seen extending up into higher levels. The
burial was placed in a flexed pOSition with the head to the
north-northwest and lower body to the south-southeast. No grave
furnishings were included in the burial. However. a number of
unusual ceramic sherds (Sandy Paste Group 3) were recovered from
a restricted area in the fill around and above the burial. A
direct relationship between the sherds and the underlying burial
was suspected, but could not be unequivocab1y demonstrated.
The single arrowpoint recovered from Zone 3 was a ScaZZorn
(Fig. 41). Other chipped stone included two bifaces, six cores.
and a number of flakes and chips. Three worked bone artifacts
and twenty-eight potsherds were also recovered. Twenty-five of
the sherds had sandy paste and were classified as Goose Creek;
three were grog-tempered and classified as San Jacinto. This
artifact assemblage, especially the ratio of Goose Creek to San
Jacinto sherds. is very similar to collections representing early
Late Prehistoric activity in the Galveston Bay region (Aten and
Bollich 1969).
The bones of twenty-one vertebrate species were recognized
in the collection of faunal remains from Zone 3. Of these
twenty-one species. eleven were terrestrial and ten were aquatic.
Seven invertebrate species. all mussels, were also recovered.
A noteworthy find among the Zone 3 faunal remains was an antelope
tooth, one of the easternmost finds for the species in archeo­
logical deposits (Davidson 1975). The vertebrate remains do not
readily suggest a particular season of occupation on the site
during deposition of Zone 3. A listing of anatomical parts rep­
resented in th~ Zone 3 faunal collection suggests transport of
whole animals to the site for con~umption ..
As with Zone 5, Zone 3 was in turn capped by a thin, sterile

THE LEONARD K

SITE~

deposit designated Zone 2. Much lighter in color than Zone 3 and
Zone 1, Zone 2 contained only a ve~y small amount of cultural
material. What little cultural debris was recovered from Zone 2
. is believed to have worked dowh from Zone 1.
Excavation in Zone 1, the ~ppermost stratigraphic unit on
the site, yielded no occupational features or human burials.
Arrowpoints recovered from Zone 1 included three Scallorns, one
Perdiz~ and one elillton.
Also recovered were one biface, three
chert cores, and chert debitage. Fifty-four potsherds were re­
covered; thirty were sandy p~ste Goose Creek ware and twenty­
four were grog-tempered San Jacinto ware. This assemblage, es­
pecially as regards the ratio of Goose Creek to San Jacinto
sherds, is much like assemblages representing the latter years
of the Late Prehistoric Peri6d around Galveston Bay (Aten and
Bol1ich 1969). A notable exception is the absence of bone­
tempered pottery, often found with Perdiz points in Late Pre­
historic assemblages in the region. Sample bias may account for
this absence.
.
.
The bones of seventeen vertebrate species, eleven terrestrial
and six aquatic, were recovered from Zone 1. Also collected were
shells r~pre~enting two freshwater muss~l species. Remains of a
pintail duck (Anas aoutal suggest occupation during late fall,
winter, or early spring. The other vertebrate species could :,
have been captured during any season of the year given the rela­
tively mild climate in the region. An element by element break­
down of anatomical parts indicates that whole animals were
brought to the site for consumption.

THE LITTLE BETHLEHEM SITE, 41 AU 38

115

THE LITTLE BETHLEHEM SITE
41 AU 38

Introduction
The Little Bethlehem Site is located northwest along the
bluff. 900 meters from the Ernest Witte site and 400 meters from
the Leonard K site. The site was named after the Little Bethle­
hem Church, a picturesque late nineteenth century wood structure
located on the flood plain about six kilometers to the east.
Trending from northwest to southeast, the site has a length of
at least 130 meters and a width of 30 to 50 meters. Each end is
bounded by a drainage gully or notch, the one to the southeast
being small while the other is very large. The shortest distance
from the site to Allens Creek is 700 meters and to the Brazos
River 5 kilometers.
41 AU 38 occurs in a setting substantially different from
those described for 41 AU 36 and 41 AU 37. Though verging on a
large erosional notbh in the bluffline, the greatest part of the
Little Bethlehem site rests on a gradual slope leading down into
the drainage rather than within the drainage proper as do the
other two sites. At the southeast end, the transition from
prairie to flood plain is abrupt and relatively precipitous.
Going downhill to the northwest, erosion and deposition in and
around the drainage notch have served to lessen the gradient of
the bluff so that the slope is more gradual.
Most of the site is open and covered with short grass.
Thick stands of trees, primarily oak and elm, grow in the drainage
gullies and in a narrow strip along the upper edge and face of
the bluff. To the southwest is a large, isolated b~ush .ott in
which chinaberry trees and wild rose vines predominate (Fig. 32).
A barbed wire fence running southwest and northeast across the
site's northwest end marks the boundary between the cleared
Kolodziejczyk land and the heavily wooded Krampitz property.
Near the fence west of the site are the remains of a disassembled
wooden barn. The former landowner, Conrad Kolodziejczyk, and
his son Leonard reported that the land containing the site was
under cultivation when the family purchased the property. A strip
of ground paralleling the fence line was bulldozed to permit
passage of vehicles between the prairie and flood plain.
The site was noticed by the surveyors in 1972 because num­
erous lithic and ceramic artifacts and faunal remains were eroding
out of a dark clay layer on the prairie at the top of the bluff.
Remains were scattered all the way down the bluff face but were
most numerous near the upper edge. Leonard Ko10dziejczyk noted
that the top edge of the bluff had receded from 1 to 2 meters back
into the prairie during the ye~rs he lived in the area. As this
erosion was taking place, he collected many projectile points,
some potsherds, and several shell artifacts as they washed out of

116

ALLENS CREEK

the bluff. He said that the shell artifacts appeared to have
been associated with human burials.
In September Ii74, thr~e test pits were excavated at the
site. The tests revealed a shallow deposit rich in lithics,
ceramics and faunal remains. The quantity and condition of
ani mal b.Q n e s r e coyer e d was e s pe c fa 1 1y ex cit i n g . The dec i s ion to
conduct a more thorough investigation at the site was based on
the high productivity of cultu~al remains and relatively undis­
turbed nature of the deposits.
Technical Procedure
A grid for horizontal controls was established at 41 AU 38
by arbitrarily placing a stake in the east central area of the
site. The grid coordinates MIOa WIOO (meters) were assigned to
this stake. Using a survey transit centered over NIOO WI00
point, north-south (magnetic) and east-west base lines were
staked out. Grid coordinates increased to the north and west
according to distance from an imaginary primary datum located to
the south and east of the site. Further subdivisions were made
using a combination of transit and measuring tape triangulation.
Basic excavation units were one by two meters in size, with the
grid coordinates on the southeast stake used to identify the
unit.
A railroad spike, driven into the trunk of a large elm tree
located just over the edge of the bluff slightly northwest of
the main site area, became the datum for vertical controls; this
datum was assi9ned an arbitrary elevation of 100 meters. The
primary datum Czero elevation} was thus far below the site. All
vertical measurem~nts were taken relative to the 100 meter
secondary datum. Using this datum, a plane table contour map of
the site was drawn (F~g. 33).
Field notes taken at 41 AU 38 included a daily Journal,
feature records, and level reports. Methods of recording, ex­
posing, and removing occupational features were the same as
those used at 41 AU 36. In controlled excavation units, a U.T.
Austin General Record Form was filled out for each 10 cm. level
excavated.
Photographic information taken at the site was recorded in
a journal. Artifacts were bagged and labeled with appropriate
provenience information, date of collection and names of indi­
viduals making the collection.
Controlled excavations at 41 AU 38 took place in fifteen
units; fourteen of these measured 1 by 2 meters and one had
dimensions 1 meter square (Fig. 33). As the deposit containing
the site w~s not visibly stratified, units were excavated in
arbitrary 10 cm. levels, determined by measuring down from a
level line attached at the ground surface of the southeast stake
in each unit. Ground surface elevation at each of these stakes
relative to th_e secondary datumOO'Q meters) was determined

118

ALLENS CREEK

using the survey transit and stadia rod. All matrix was
screened through ~-inch mesh hardwa~e cloth.
Soil and pollen samples were taken from continuous columns
in the walls of six excavation units and one backhoe trench. As
there w~re no visible stratigraphic breaks in the deposits,
samples were taken at 10 cm. intervals from the base of the
deposit up to the surface. Samples were collected in paper bags
labeled with horizontal and vertical provenience data. Samples
were taken from the following units and trench:

Exact sample locations were recorded in profile drawings for
each unit and the trench.
Four backhoe trenches were excavated to aid in defining
site extent. Measured profile sketches of walls in Trench~s 1
and 2 were drawn.
Upon conclusion of investigations all excavation units and
backhoe trenches were backfilled. Brass benchmarks set in
concrete replaced archeological grid stakes NI00 WIOO and N120
W148 and the following construction grid coordinates were calcu­
lated by Houston Lighting &,~Power Company surveyors:

PERCENT OF SITE INVESTIGATED
The total surface area of the site was estimated to be
2400 square meters. Of this area 9 29 square meters (1.25%) were
investigated through controlled excavation and 49 square meters
(2.04%) through controlled excavation and backhoe trenching.
Character of the Deposits
Cultural remains evidencing 41 AU 38 were, for the most
part, contained in the thin surficial layer of Lake Charles clay
which overlays the Beaumont Formation. There was, however, a
portion of the site in which deposits were very different in
composition and structural configuration from the Lake Charles
and Beaumont. This deposit was not investigated thoroughly

enough to determine the presence or absence of zonation, either
physically- or culturally-induced.
PHYSICAL STRATIFICATION
Over most areas of the site, cultural remains were recovered
from a 40 cm.-thick layer of Lake Charles clay. Other than a
plow zone, there were no visible divisions within the deposit.
Described in the field notes as a clay or a clay loam, the color
of the Lake Charles ranged from dark brown (7.5Y3/2) to very'dark
gray {5YR3/l, 10YR3/l} to black (5YR2.5/l). The clay could be
hard and crumbly or soft and very sticky, depending on moisture
content. Rarely was the moisture content at just the right
level to permit easy passage of the matrix through the screen.
Grass roots were numerous from the ground surface to a depth
of 10 cm. At 15 to 20 cm. deep, an indistinct textural division
was usually observed. The soil above this break was relatively
fine and homogeneous while the soil below was of a coarse, blocky
consistency. The upper unit is thought to be a plow zone re­
flecting past cultivation of the field containing the site.
The Beaumont Formation, a dark reddish brown (5YR3/2) clay,
was usually encountered at a depth of 40 cm. and was considered
the base of excavations. In some areas of the site, a 5 cm.­
thick layer of pea-sized calcium carbonate nodules was noted at,
or just below, the surface of the Beaumont. Scattered snail
shells and carbonate pebbles were natural inclusions noted
throughout the profiles.
The Lake Charles clay was encountered 1n fourteen of the
fifteen units excavated at 41 AU 38. During the final days of
investigation, Unit N136 W143 was excavated near the presumed
northwestern extent of intact deposits. Unlike other units
placed in the site, the depths of which never exceeded 50 cm.,
N136 W143 went down 70 cm. into a sandy loam deposit. Backhoe
Trenches 3 and 4 were then excavated to reveal more about the
unusual deep sand observed in the unit. An indistinct transition
from clay at the east end of Trench 4 to sandier soil at the west
end was noted. Though the situation was recorded, a more
thorough investigation was not made.
Because 41 AU 38 was the first site to be intensively exca­
vated at Allens Creek, the relationship of cultural remains to
colluvial deposits in the drainage gullies was not understood at
the time of excavation. With experience subsequently gained at
41 AU 36 and 41 AU 37, it became clear that N136 W143 caught the
leading edge of colluvial deposits draping down into the drainage.
In retrospect, it seems likely that further, probing at the
northwest end of the site would have revealed older and deeper
deposits containing cultural remains. Though the landowner
reported finding artifacts in t~ls area, most notably a number
of Arch~ic dart points, it was not explored because a dirt road­
way had been, graded through t~ drainage dow~ to the flood plain.

It was wrongly assumed that the dep~sit in the drainage was as
s.h.allow. as' that at higher elevations to th,e southe.as't in the
main site area. Had this ~een the ca~e, the hulldozing would
have severely disturbed the remains.
It is now known that depositsaccu~ulating in the drainages
can he considerably deeper than the 4Q cm. typical of the Lake
Charles and that it is not uncom~on for them to contain pre­
historic cultural remains. If 41 AU 38 did extend further down
into the drainage than was originally thought, the hulldozer
pro~ably disturbed only the upper deposits leaving more deeply
buried material intact. This pot~ntia11y signif1cant additional
dimension to 41 AU 38 was ex~lor~d only peripherally.

out of the Reaumont, the Lake Charles follows the surface of' the
parent formation exactly. As the Beaumont slopes downhill from
southeast to northwest, so does the Lake Charles. Both are
abruptly truncated at the edge of the bluff.
In the area of Unit N136 W143 and Backhoe Trenches 3 and 4,
the Lake Charles and Beaumont grade quickly into the sandy de­
posits characteristic of the northwest end of the site. The
transition undoubtedly marks a leading edge of the erosional
gully and the sandy colluvial deposits which have accumulated
therein. Though details on the character and structure of this
particular colluvial fill were not investigated, there 1s no
reason to believe that the depositional situation varies greatly
from those documented at 41 AU 36 and 41 AU 37. The fill
sequence outlined for the drainage at 41 AU 37 would likely
apply to 41 AU 38.
CULTURAL STRATIGRAPHY
Cultural remains were found throughout the Lake Charles
from ground surface to a depth of 40 to 50 cm. The density of
material was somewhat greater at depths of 10 to 30 cm. below
surface. Whether or riot the increased amount of material at 10
to 30 cm. represents a surface or surfaces upon which aboriginal
activity took place was never satisfactorily determined. .
In view of modern agricultural activities on the site and
the "self-mulching" tendency of the vertic Lake Charles clay,
little emphasis is placed on vertical distribution of artifacts

single, undifferentiated deposit .. Artifacts recovered during
excavations at 41 AU 38 included Perdiz, SaaZZorn,and DarZ
projectile points and sandy paste, ~rog-, bone/grog~. and bone­
tempered ceramics. Five occupational features, including a
small refuse pit, mussel shell concentrations, and clusters of
burned clay and sandstone, were isolated. The above artifacts

cultural remains over much of t~e site were deposited as a result
of Late Prehistoric occupationCs).
Of the four dart points collected (two Ensors, a Lange, and
a Miscellaneous Form), two were recovered from N136 W143; the
single excavation unit topping the sandy colluvial deposit in
the drainage. One dart point was found in excavations at the
southeast end of the site and one was collected on the surface.
What is again suggested is that an Archaic component to 41 AU 38
was located in the colluvial deposits of the drainage.
Remains of the Late Prehistoric occupation and the suspected
Archaic component seem to have overlapped one another only at
t~e northwest end of the site.
With\the exception of a single
dart point, no obvious Archaic-age materials were recovered in
areas of the site contained in the Lake Charles clay, Late
Prehistoric materials were found in both the Lake Charles and
the colluvium filling the drainage.
Absolute and Relative Dating of Cultural Deposits
A carbon sample collected from the area of Features 4 and
5 was submitted to the Radiocarbon Laboratory, The University of
Texas at Austin, for radiocarbon assay. Sample TX-2065 yielded
an uncorrected B.P. date of 450±70. A corrected B.P. date of
470±80, or A.D. 1480±80, was calculated. Given the time­
diagnostiC artifact forms recovered from the site, this date is
completely acceptable.
.
.'
Four dart points found at 41 AU 38 suggest an Archaic com­
ponent at the site, the existence of which was not conclusively
demonstrated. The Ensor forms are probably Late Archaic in age
while the Lange form could represent either a Middle or Late
Archaic age.
Occupational Features
Five,occupational features were isolated, including a small
ref use pit, con c e n t rat ton S 0 f mu sse 1 s he 11, and c lu s t e r s 0 f

ALLENS CREEK

Feature 1. Feature 1, a heavy concentration of midden
was located in Unit NI02 W99 (center point: NIQ2.S8
W99.86) at an average elevation of I02.4Q meters above datum.
Animal b.ones (deer, gar, fish, snake, rabbit, turtle, frog,
and salamander), snail sh.el1, mussel shell. charcoal, flint
flakes, and b.urned clay nodules were found in a roughly circular
area, the matrix of which was much darker thari the surrounding
soil. There was a notable absence of potsherds in and around
the stained area which seems to represent a small refuse or
cooking pi,t.
The feature had a maximum north-south dimension of 45 cm.
Along an east-west line it measures 35 cm., with the western edge
apparently extending into the adjoining unit, NI02 WIOO.
Having a thickness of approximately 20 cm., the concentration was
first noticed at a depth of 30 cm. from ground surface and
bottomed out at 50 cm. No diagnostic artifacts were found within
the feature but Darl" Saallorn" and Perdiz projectile points I,'
were recovered in close proximity. Charcoal was collected but
the sample was not large enough for radiocarbon assay. Exca­
vation in Unit NI02 WIOO failed to reveal a suspected extension
of the feature into that area.
Features 2 and 3. Features 2 and 3 were parts of an exten­
sive refuse accumulation, the principal constituent of which was
shell from the common pond mussel, Ligumia subrostrata. The
units containing the two features were intentionally located to
facilitate exposure of mussel shell lenses observed eroding from
the bluff face. The lenses were at the same vertical level but
s epa rat e d hy a h.o r i z 0 ntal dis tan ceo f a p pro x i mat ely two and 0 ne ­
half meters. Subsequent excavation yielded evidence that the
two lenses were both part of a more extensive single accumulation.
Unfortunately. time restrictions prohibited delineation of the
complete feature area. However, Features 2 and 3 are believed
to provide a good characterization of the phenomenon.
Feature 2. Feature 2 (Fig. 34) was exposed in Unit N106
W91. Remains were scattered over the entire floor of the unit
but were most densely concentrated in the southern half. Major
elements included a group of eight burned sandstones (center
point: NI06.28 W91.41) and three heavy concentrations of mussel
shell (center points! NI06.41 W91.64; NI06.59 W91.72; NI06.75
W91.16). The sandstone fragments were from 4 to 10 cm. in
length and covered an area of 30 square cm. Thickness of the
shell concentrations averaged 5 cm. The surface upon which the
materials rested was 40 to 50 cm. below ground surface, or 102.12
to 102.22 meters above datum. Portions of the shell concentra­
tions extended into Units NI06 W90 and NI06 W92. Burned frag­
ments of deer. raccoon, turtle, snake, gar, and fish bones were
found throughout the feature. All mussel shell was badly decom­
posed thou~h it was apparently whole upon deposition. Some of
the s he 1 1 was bur ned . A1 so s cat t e, red a c ross t he unit a t f eat ur e
level were small burned clay nodules, sandstone fragments, a
very few flint flakes, a ch~rt cobble, and som~ flecks of char­
coai. No time diagnostic artifacts were fou~d. A large amount
de~ris,

of the mussel shell was collected for p-ossib1e radiocarbon
dating and/or seasonality determination.
Feature 3. Feature 3 was exposed in the northern half of
Unit N108 W94 at an average depth of 53 cm. below ground surface,
or 102.13 meters above datum . .The principal elements of the
feature were two 1 a r 9 e pi 1e s of mussel shell . One (center point:
N109.55 W94.22) measured 90 cm. north-south arid .50 cm. eastwest with the eastern edge extending into Unit N109 W93. The
other (center point: NllO.02 W94.60) measured 50 cm. north-south
and 60 cm. east-west. Its northern e~ge was truncated by the
bluff face. Thickness of the shell lenses ranged from 5 to 10
cm. The mussel shells were badly decomposed as in Feature 2.
Scattered in and around the shell were burned bones (deer, fish),
small pieces of burned clay and rock, and some very small
charcoal flecks. A large sample of mussel shell was collected
for possible radiocarbon dating and/or seasonality determination.
A portion of the feature is illustrated in Figure 34.
Features 4 and 5. Features 4 and 5 were adjacent concentra­
tions of burned clay nodules surrounded by high densities of
bone fragments, chert debitage, potsherds, and charcoal. Both
features were found in Unit Nl14 Wl16, with elements of Feature
4 scattered throughout the southern half and Feature 5 concen­
trated in the east central part of the northern half. The
relationship between the two features was not satisfactorily
defined. Feature 4 may have been either a scattered hearth or
an area of activity ancillary to Feature 5.
Feature 4. Feature 4 was strewn across the southern half
of Unit Nl14 Wl16. The principal constituents, nineteen
burned clay nodules, were loosely clustered in a 20 by 85 cm.
east-west band across the unit (center point: Nl14.74 Wl16.46).
Remains occurred at depths of from 22 to 27 em. below ground
surface or 101.96 to 101.91 meters above datum. Scattered in and
around the clay nodules were numerous chert flakes, bone frag­
ments (deer, cat(?), turtle, snake, gar, fish) and a few pot­
sherds. Charcoal was relatively abundant. Combined with carbon
from Feature 5, this charcoal yielded the radiocarbon date
A.D. 1480 ! 80 (TX-2065).
Feature 5. Feature 5 was a compact, single layer cluster
of approximately 30 burned clay nodules covering an area of
40 square centimeters. This feature was encountered at the
same level as Feature 4, with an average elevation of 101.94
meters above datum and a center point lrication of Nl15.54
W116.12. Numerous bone fragments (deer, rabbit, turtle, gar,
fish), chert flakes, several potsherds, and charcoal were found
in and around the feature. A chert drill or perforator (Fig.
42) was found in the cluster of burned clay nodules. A portion
of the feature is illustrated in Figure 34.

Discussion
The bulk of evidence recovered during the investigation at
41 AU 38 demonstrates an intensive cultural occupation on the
site during the Late Prehistoric Period. As has been previously
mentioned, there is reason to believe that certain unexplored
areas within the site contained residues representing earlier
cultural occupations. It is emphasized, however, that the
existence of the earlier component(s) is a matter of speculation
not well-substantiated by tangible evidence. For all practical
purposes, only the data actually recovered from the site may
be used in analyzing and interpreting the 10ca1ity's cultural
history. These data overwhelmingly suggest Late Prehistoric
activities.
As mentioned in earlier remarks concerning area physiography,
there seems to be a tendency for Late Prehistoric sites in the
project area to be elongate in configuration and to occur both
in drainage gully and steep bluff settings. The first important
point to be made about the late Prehistoric remafns found at
41 AU 38 is that they were distributed over a comparatively
large area which is much longer than it is wide. In Figure 4,
a useful comparison of site configurations may be made. Note
tbat sites 41 AU 36 and 41 AU 37, both containing major Archaic
components, tend to be small and circular in outline whereas
41 AU 38, predominately a late Prehistoric site, is long, narrow,
and covers a relatively large surface area. This difference in
site configuration is reflected generally throughout the entire
project area. It should again be stressed that the dichotomy
between Archaic and late Prehistoric site configurations is not
absolute. Sites 41 AU 36 and 41 AU 37 both contain Late Pre­
historic components within their circular limits.
The artifactua1 remains recovered from the 40 cm.-thick
deposit at 41 AU 38, especially the arrow points and pottery,
indicate a high degree of similarity to the Galveston Bay Focus,
the core area of which lies eastward of A11ens Creek. As will
be more thoroughly discussed in a later section on Ceramic
Artifacts, the ratio of bone-tempered, grog-tempered, and sandy
paste sherds recovered at 41 AU 38 is the same as for sites
near Galveston Bay with components representing the latter years
of the Late Prehistoric Period.
Comparing the findings at 41 AU 38 to more westerly
manifestations· of the Late Prehistoric, the artifact assemblage
has traits common to both the Austin and Toyah Foci of central
Texas. However, results of the 41 AU 38 investigation do little
to clarify the problem of whether or not the total assemblage
was generated by a single group of people or by successive
occupations of different groups of people having distinct tool
kits.
The type of excavation employed at the site made it
impossible to stratigraphically separate certain artifacts;

THE LITTLE BETHLEHEM SITE, 41 AU 38

127

SaaZZorn points and Goose Creek/San Jacinto ware, characteristic
of the Austin Focus, could not be vertically distinguished from
later Toyah Focus artifacts, Perdig points and Leon PZain
ceramics. In retrospect, it is believed that excavating 5 cm.
thick levels in contiguous one meter squares would have
permitted a more conclusive statement on the relationship
among the various diagnostic artifact groups.
The collection of lithic artifacts and manufacturing debris
from 41 AU 38, representing a presumably "pure" Late Prehistoric
assemblage, demonstrates some noteworthy differences when
compared to the predominately Archaic assemblages from 41 AU36
and 41 AU 37.
First, in the categories finished artifacts, bifaces, cores,
and debitage, there was a muc~ heavier recovery, relative to
area of site investigated, at 41 AU 38 than at either of the
other two sites. There were twenty-one projectile points
assignable to previously established typological categories,
twenty-four whole or fragmentary bifaces, twenty-seven chert
cores, and much debitage. It seems that the manufacture of
lithic implements was much more intensive at 41 AU 38 than at
41 AU 36 or 41 AU 37.
At 41 AU 38, as well as 41 AU 36 and 41 AU 37, two types of
cores predominated. One was the large flake removed from a
cobble which, in turn, served as a core for removal of addition­
al flakes (Type 3). The other {Type 4} was the cobble fragment
from which flakes were bidirectionally removed through use of
both natural and prepared platforms.
Subjective, unquantified observations on chert cores and
debitage collected from the Little Bethlehem site indicate
differences from the lithic assemblages at the Ernest Witte and
Leonard K sites. In general, the cores from the former are
smaller. Furthermore, roughly cylindrical or polyhedral cores
with prepared platforms and no cortex (Type 5) were recovered
from this site alone. This type of core is widely recognized as
an element of Late Prehistoric lithic assemblages (Skelton 1977).
In the debitage collection, a number of the flakes and
chips had a waxy sheen often attributed to heat treatment or
annealing of the chert prior to knapping (Skelton 1977). On
a percentage-wise basis, flake size at 41 AU 38 was smaller and
flake blades were much more common than at the other two sites.
The five marine gastropod columellae recovered by Leonard
Ko10dziejczyk as they eroded out of the retreating bluff (Fig.
42) are said to have been associated with human burials. All
were found in close proximity to one another along the bluff
face. It is not known how many individual skeletons were
represented. The existence of the shell columellae, apparently
grave goods, and the fact that the burials were placed at the
site of occupation, are two important bits of information to be
gleaned from Ko10dziejczyk's observations.

128

ALLENS CREEK

Comparing the marine shell artifacts from 41 AU 38 with
those from 41 AU 36 and 41 AU 37, it is interesting to note that
the form of ornament found at 41 AU 38 does not occur in the
extensive collection of Late Archaic-age marine shell ornaments
from the other two sites. Assuming that the 41 AU 38 marine
shells were related to the Late Prehistoric occupation on the
site, a valuable and potentially time-diagnostic contrast
between the forms of Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric ornaments
is provided.
The bones of five fish species, two amphibians~ three
reptiles, three birds, and eight mammals, as well as the shells
of four freshwater mussel species, were recovered in the exca­
vations at 41 AU 38. An element by element breakdown of the
bones of each vertebrate species indicates that whole animals
were being brought to the sit~ for consumption; the deer, for
instance, is represented by head, torso, and leg elements. The
bones of a blue goose and a duck suggest occupation during the
late fall-winter-early spring season. The other vertebrate
species could have been captured during any season of the year
given the relatively mild climate in the region. Horse bones
recovered from the site are probably the remains of a buried
farm animal.

lithic Artifacts
For descriptive purposes, the lithic collections from the
Allens Creek sites are divided into categories: chipped stone,
ground stone, miscellaneous lithics, and lithic residues.
The chipped stone category includes dart points, arrow points,
corner-tang knives, drills, a stemmed scraper, bifaces, cores,
and chipping debitage. Boatstones, a gorget, abraders, grinding
stnnes, and grinding slab fragments are discussed under the
heading of ground stone artifacts. Miscellaneous lithic
artifacts include a group of red jasper pebbles, a perforated
rock, ocher, graphitic biotite schist, hammerstones, and
unmodified chert and quartzite cobbles. Burned clay nodules,
sandstone fragments, and calcium carbonate concretions
comprise the lithic residue category.
CHIPPED STONE
For many of the specimens discussed under this heading, the
following information is provided:
1) Specimen identification number - the number of the
specimen within the type or descriptive category,
followed by the artifact catalog lot number in
parenthesis.
2) Horizontal provenience - the unit from which the specimen
was recovered. At 41 AU 37 and 41 AU 38 the dimensions
of the excavated units were 1 x 2 meters; at 41 AU 38
the units were 2 x 2 meters in size.
3) Vertical provenience - the zone, excavation level, or
burial from which the artifact was recovered. In each
case the applicable provenience designation preceeds
the number of the unit - Z = Zone, l = level, and B=
Burial.
4) Dimensions of the artifact - the maximum length, maximum
width, maximum thickness, stem length from shoulders to
base, and maximum and minimum stem widths are all given
in centimeters; the weight of the artifact, in grams,
is also presented.
5) Color - the Munsell Soil Color Chart (1975) designation
for the color of the dry material.
6) Illustration - the figure in which the artifact is
illustrated.

are represented by specimens from 41 AU 36 {1-l3}. four by
specimens from 41 AU 37 (1-4), and one by a specimen from 41 AU

edges. The shoulders are pronounced. but narrow and at right
angles to the stem and blade edges. The stem is parallel to
slightly contracted with a concave base. Specimen 2 consists of
a stem and base only.
Comments - Specimen 1 is believed to have been a grave
inclusion with Group 1 Burial 86. The point was found in
the chest area of the skeleton, but not in a position suggesting
that the projectile was the cause of death.

Form - The blade outlines are crudely triangular. The
blade edges are convex; how~ver, one edge is markedly more
convex than the other giving the artifacts an asymmetrical
shape. Shoulders are weakly developed. The stem is parallel
to slightly expanding, and the bases are convex.
Comments - Both of these specimens were directly associated
with Group 2 Burial 177 and undoubtedly were the cause of the
individual's death. One point was e.mbedded in the spine and
the other lay between the scapula and clavicle. Both specimens
are roughly flaked.

Form - Blade outlines are triangular. Blade edges vary
from convex to concave, and shoulders are very prominent, but
not barbed. Stems vary from slightly expanded to parallel,
although Specimen 5 has a contracting stem. Bases of the
specimens are convex.
Comment - The stems of all specimens a~e thinned to an
almost abnormal degree. Specimen 5 has traces of a black sub­
stance, possibly asphaltum, on the stem. The cortex retained
as striking platforms at the bases of two specimens indicates
that they were made on flakes removed from a 'lCeathered cobllle.
All seven artifacts were found associated with Group 3 Burial
154, apparently as grave inclusions. There was no evidence that
these projectiles, which w~re scattered throughout the chest
area of the skeleton,' were embedded.

Reference - The GodLey type was defined by Jelks (1962)
based on his work at the Kyle Site. The type is affiliated
with the Austin Focus which dates from A.D. 550 to A.D. 950 at
the Kyle Site. See also Figure 22.

Form - The blades are triangular with straight to slightly
convex edges. Six specimens have moderately pronounced shoulders;
two have short barbs. The stems expand, usually to equal the
width at the shoulders. Bases are relatively straight.
Comment - Specimen 2 has a slightly beveled blade. Specimen
5 was a grave inclusion found with Group 2 Burial 217. Cortex
surviving at the base of Specimen 6 indicates that the point
was made on a flake coming from a weathered cobble. Specimen
7 was found in the pelvic region of Group 2 Burial 15. Though
the possibility is suggested, there was no conclusive evidence
that the point had entered the body by violent means.

Form - The blades are triangular with straight to slightly
convex e1ges. Shoulders are narrow, the stems flare strongly,
and the bases are concave.
Comment - Specimens 1 and 2 were found in Group 2 Burials
96 and 99, respectively. In both skeletons, the projectile
points were in contexts indicating that they were the cause
of death (Fig. l5b). Evidence indicates that the two bodies
were buried simultaneously. Though Specimens 3 and 6 were not
found embedded in Done, as were Specimens 1 and 2, they were
in very close proximity to Group 2 burials. It is suggested
that these projectiles may have been the cause of death in these
tndtviduals.

Form - The blade outline is leaf-shaped, and the blade
edges are recurved. The distal end of the projectile is more
rounded than pointed, and the shoulders are prominent. The
stem is parallel and the base is straight. A striking platform
is seen at the base, probably the platform of the flake from
which the point was manufactured.
Reference - The specimen resembles McClurkan's (1968)

Form - The blades are triangular with edges which are
straight to slightly concave. Shoulders are weak. Stems are
parallel to slightly contracting and bases are convex.
Comment - Specimens 2 and 4 have traces of a black substance,
possibly asphaltum, on their stems. Form 6 points differ from
Form 5 in that the stems are generally longer, thinner, and more
finely worked. Form 6 differs from the Gapy type in that the
stem does not contract as much and is somewhat thinner and better
worked.

Form - The blade outline could not be determined; however,
one blade edge is convex. The shoulder is barbed and the stem
expands strongly. The base is straight.
Comment - The distal end of this specimen has been flaked
to a blunt, rounded shape. The specimen was apparently impact­
fractured and one longitudinal half of the artifact lost. The
bluntness suggests a function other than that of projectile
point.

ARTIFACTS

Form - The blade is triangular with convex, serrated edges.
Shoulders are prominent and lightly barbed, the stem expands,
and the hase is incomplete. .
Comment - The specimen bears a strong resemblance to' the
Fairland type but, because the hasa1 portion of the stem is
missing. a definite assignment to an established type category
could not be made. This projectile was lodged in the spine of
Group 2 Burial 116 and was probably the cause of death.

Form - The blade is long.and triangular with straight edges.
The shoulders are weak, the stem edges are parallel, and the
base is convex.
Comment - This artifact may be a discarded dart point pre­
form. It is unusually thick and the edges are battered;
whether this resulted from attempts at thinning or through use
is unknown. The distal end of the piece has been flaked to
give it a gouge-like appearance and it shows possible use marks.
Arrow Points From 41 AU 37
At 41 AU 37, three Saallorn points and one Perdiz point
were recovered, as well as stems for Clillton and Saallorn
points and two distal arrow point fragments.

Form - Lacking the tip, one barb, and the basal portion of
the stem, there remains little of this projectile to describe.
The small overall size and long, narrow contracting stem suggest
that the point is Pepdiz.

Two corner-tang knives, both associated with Group 2
Burial 31 as grave inclusions, were recovered at 41 AU 36.
Specimen 1 is manufactured out of a high-quality gray chert with
very dark gray patches. This long, curved blade was masterfully
thinned by the removal of flakes, with dimensions up to 1 cm.
by 3 cm., from the margins of both faces of the artifact. The
length and flatness of the artifact suggest that, rather than
being made on a huge flake, a large chert slab was reduced to
form a blank for the finished knife. On Doth faces, thirty­
five to forty flake scars are present along each edge and con­
verge down the medial long axis of the blade, in some cases
so perfectly that the impression of one thinning flake running
the whole width of the specimen is given. Tiny retouch flakes
have been removed along all edges. Around the corner opposite
the tang, and for a length of 2.4 cm. along the blade edge
toward the distal tip, the blade edge has been ground.
Specimen 2 is manufactured out of a high-quality black
chert. The blade edge thinning and retouch techniques used on
this knife were essentially the same as for Specimen 1. This
blade is wider than Specimen 1 and was apparently more difficult

154

ALLENS CREEK

to thin, there being some areas in the central part of the
artifact that are noticeably thicker. Two large patches of
limestone cortex which were not removed during initial shaping
of the artifact are present on one face of the proximal end.
Visible on the surface of these patches are striations probably
resulting from attempts at scratching or abrading away as much
of this cortex as possible. No area of edge grinding could
be discerned on this specimen.
The color, quality, and size of these two knives suggest
that the probable source of the cherts, if not the blades them­
selves, was the region falling roughly within a triangle formed
by the Texas towns of Austin, Brownwood, and Waco. In this
general region, chert occurs in nodule and slab forms of a size
substantial enough to'be worked into such objects as the large
corner-tangs.
The color and quality of the cherts in the knives are also
much in keeping with the chert resources available in this
area. The gray to very dark gray chert in Specimen 1 is indis­
tinguishable from cherts found in the limestone quarries near
Georgetown. The particularly fine quality and color of this
chert is believed to be unique to the Georgetown vicintiy. The
black chert in Specimen 2 is more characteristic of the cherts
in the Temple-Waco area. It is emphasized that these observations
are strictly subjective; no one has yet attempted to systemat­
ically describe the characteristics of the myriad chert re­
sources found in Texas.
In a monograph entitled "The Corner-Tang Flint Artifacts of
Texas," Patterson (1936) plots by county the distribution of
526 corner-tang specimens reported to him by collectors and
archeologists. For seven counties - Bell, Milam, Comanche,
Bastrop, Williamson, Coryell, and Travis - reports of twenty
or more corner-tang knives were received. Of these seven, Bell
had sixty-one reports, Milam and Comanche, forty or more,
Bastrop, Williamson, and Coryell, thirty or more, and Travis
had twenty.
In his discussion, Patterson notes that the distributional
patterns derived from his p10ttings could be skewed by
differential intensity of collecting activities from county to
county and by the willingness of collectors to report their
finds to him:
The writer has taken . . . these factors into
consideration and believes that the data, though
limited, are yet sufficient to give an accurate
picture of the general range of the corner-tang
pieces in Texas . . . • The first 254 records
when plotted showed that they had been reported
from 62 counties. Later, after many efforts
were made to extend the range and 272 additional
records had been secured, only eight new counties

ARTIFACTS

155

were added (representing only 15 specimens)
. . . . Finally, it must be kept in mind that
we are dealing with the distribution of an
artifact that is by no means common, even in
the region where it is most numerous.
A year after publication of this article, Patterson (1937b)
puhlished "Supplementary Notes on the Corner-Tang Artifact"
in which an additional eighty-two specimens were recorded for
Texas as well as 117 specimens from thirteen other states.
Among these were Wyoming with thirty-three reports, Nebraska
with eighteen, and Missouri with nine. Corner-tangs were also
reported from thirteen additional counties in Texas. In
conclusion to this work, Patterson stated,
The greatest concentration of these artifacts
lies in central Texas, where the group of
sixty-three counties gave a total of 582
records. This is over ninety-five percent of
all records for the State, and about eighty
percent of all records for the fourteen states.
This means, in all probability, that central
Texas represents their place of origin, and
constitutes the main center from which they
became dispersed over central United States.
Accepting the validity of Patterson's' findings and given
t h.e color, qua 1 i t y, and s i z e c ha rae t e r is tic s 0 f the c her t use d
in their manufacture, it may be reasonably assumed that the
corner-tang knives recovered at 41 AU 36 were produced in the
central Texas region, prohaBly along the Balcones Escarpment
between Austin and Waco.
Other corner-tang knives recovered during controlled
excavations include seven specimens from the Morhiss Site
(Ouffen 1939), one specimen from the Britton Site (Story and
Shafer 1966), and four specimens from the McCann Site (Preston
and Shiner 1969). The Britton specimen was found in a zone
beneath a hearth from which two radiocarbon dates, 130 B.C.
(TX-200) and 380 B.C. (TX-201), were obtained. The context of
the corner-tang specimen relative to the hearth suggests a
somewhat older age for the knife.

Specimen 1 - Subtriangular with slightly convex blade
edges and a concave base, this biface may have functioned as
a gouge-like instrument. The concave base of the artifact is
steeply beveled with light retouch showing along the leading
edge of the bevel.
Specimen 2 - This is a slender distal biface fragment with
a blunt, unfinished tip.
Specimen 3 - The specimen is a biface in an early stage of
reduction. Made on a small chert cobble, the artifact may
have been discarded after attempts at thinning the piece
failed. A knob of cortex remains at one end. Segments of the
edge are battered but there are no oBvious signs of usage,
Specimen 4 ~ The distal fragment of a well-flaked dart
point or knife, this piece may have been broken during attempts
at thinning the basal portion. The blade outline is triangular.
Specimen 5 - Long, narrow, and well-flaked, this biface
lacks the distal tip. Although thinned at the base, the piece
is abnormally thick in the midsection. The blade edges are
convex, expanding slightly in the medial section and then
tapering abruptly to what must have been a short, blunt point.
Specimen 6 - The speCimen was found in the pit containing
Burials 5 and 6; howev~r, direct association with the burials
is questionable. Specimen 6 consists of a circular piece of
chert that is biconvex in cross-section. Eighty percent of
one surface is covered by cortex. The other surface was flaked
from the edges into the center of the artifact, resulting
in its convex appearance.

Bifaces From 41 AU 38
Twenty-four chert bifaces, both complete and fragmentary,
were recovered at 41 AU 38. Most, if not all, of these specimens
are believed to 5e preforms or blanks intended for manufacture
into dart or arrow points. Detailed information is provided
for complete specimens while only provenience data are given
for the fragmentary specimens.

Specimen 1 - A thin, subtriangu1ar piece consisting
essentially of a flake that has been laterally retouched on both
faces. A striking platform is visible at the narrow end.
Specimen 2 - Roughly oval in shape, this biface is made on
a flake which apparently could not be successfully thinned. The
striking platform is retained at one end. Edges are battered
but not obviously utilized.
Specimen 3 - Triangular in outline, this piece is excep­
tionally thin. One blade edge is concave, the other convex.
The base is straight. Signs of utilization are not readily
apparent on the edges.
Specimen 4 - Having a sub-oval outline, the specimen is
made on a flake, the striking platform of which is still
visible at one end. The ed~es show no utilization.
Specimen 5 - Triangular with straight blade edges and base,
Specimen 5 might almost be classified as a finished projectile
point. The blade edges are lightly serrated and show no signs
of us.e.
Specimen 6 - The specimen is sub-oval in outline with con­
vex blade edges. One face is half covered by cortex. A natural
cortex striking platform is seen at one end.

Cores
The following information is provided for chert cores
recovered from 41 AU 36, 41 AU 37 and 41 AU 38:
1) specimen identification number - the number of the
specimen within the descriptive category, followed by
the artifact catalog number in parenthesis;
2) horizontal provenience - the unit from which the specimen
was recovered;
3} vertical provenience ... the zone '(Z) or level (L) from
which the artifact was recovered;
4} dimensions of the artifacts - the maximum length and
maximum width, in centimeters, and the weight, in
grams, of the artifacts;
5} color - the Munsell Soil Color Chart (1975) designation

for the color of the dry materials; and
6} type

~

a number designating the type of core represented:

1 - A core retaining cobble appearance even though
two or more flakes have been removed. Flakes
w.re struck from natural platforms and 75% to
90% of the cortex remains.
2 - Fragment of a split cobble with approximately 50%
of cortex remaining, from which only one or two
flakes have been removed, Flakes were removpd
using natural platforms,
3 - A flake removed from a cobble which, in turn.
serves as a core for additional flakes and has
o - 50% of the cortex remaining. Flakes were re­
moved using natural platforms.
4 - Cobble fragment retaining approximately 50%
cortex from which flakes have been bi-directionally
removed utilizing both natural and prepared plat­
forms.
5 - Roughly cylindrical core retaining little or no
cortex and having prepared platforms.
6 - Biconical cor~ without corte~ from which flakes
have ~een hi-directionally removed.

Chipping Debitage
Chert flakes and chips recovered from each unit were
tabulated by unit, 1evel, and zone in three flake categories ..
primary, secondary, and interior - and one chip category
(Shafer 1969). After being counted in appropriate flake and
chip categories, modified pieces were separated, counted, and
the total recorded for each zone (41 AU 36 and 41 AU 37) or unit
(41 AU 38).
.
For the purposes of this study, a'modified p'iece is
defined as a flake or chip showing signs of alteration, most
commonly in the form of tiny flake scars along one or more edges
of the piece. Much less numerous were pieces evidencing polish
or sheen al'ong the edges. In designating these pieces as
"modified", it is assumed that the alterations observed are the
result of the pieces' having been used by the aborigines in some
functional capacity. This may well not be the case for all of
the specimens. A distinction between use-modified pieces and
pieces altered by other, non-cultural processes 1s beyond the
scope of the present study. P~nding a more intensive analysis of
the collections, conclusions based on the modified flake and
chip data recorded bel.ow sh.ould be qualified and tentiiltive.

ARTIFACTS

41 AU 36
Of the 1,608 flakes and chips recovered, 1,220 came from
the fourteen excavation units from which the excavated matrix
was screened, 210 had recorded provenience but came from areas
other than the fourteen units (usually encountered while exposing
a burial and recorded as being in questionable association with
the burial), and 178 were recovered without provenience informa­
tion. The 178 pieces with no provenience were immediately
eliminated from further consideration. Also excluded were the
210 flakes and chips with proveniences other than the fourteen
units as their singular occurrence rendered them useless for
the purposes of this particular study.

As a means for comparing chipped stone artifact
collections on an inter-zone and fntersite basis, zonal totals
(41 AU 36 and 41 AU 37) and site totals (41 AU 38) were
calculated for flakes and chips. Added to these were the
cobbles, cores, hammerstones, and oifaces, here meant to include
projectile points as well as other biface forms, recovered
from each zone or the site as a whole. Grand totals for
artifacts from all categories for each zone or site were
found and percentage figures representing the categories
relative to the total number of artifacts calculated as
follows (Fig. 37):

Attention should be called to factors which could possibly
lessen the analytic and comparative potential of this data.
At all sites, the area excavated relative to the total site
area was small (see IIPercent of Site Investigated p. 118).
Their placement dictated by other requirements, excavation units
were not located on the sites with the intention of obtaining
representative or random samples of debftage. At the stratified
sites, 41 AU 36 and 41 AU 37, all zones were not investigated
to the same extent, meaning that larger samples were obtained
from some. Finally, a factor very critical at 41 AU 38 and to
a lesser extent at 41 AU 36, excavation units were not, for the
most part, contiguous.
An assumption implicit in this analysis is that the co11ect­
tions made from the various zones and sites are representative
of the whole universe of such materials contained in each zone
or site. Given the inconsistent sampling techniques employed,
it is entirely possible that the collections do not adequately
reflect the true composition of the total debitage accumulation.
These thoughts should be kept in mind in considering the
reliability of the data presented above and the conclusions
reached below.
As suggested by Skinner (1971), this presentation of data
is intended to demonstrate the lithic "tool making stages
being carried out at the sites during the various periods of
occupation. According to Skinner, ratios of primary and
secondary flakes to interior flakes and chips may indicate if
" . . . all tool making stages were present at all sites or if
particular stages tended to be·iso1~ted bysites U (Sktnrier 1971:
ll

ll

1 59) .

The manufacture of artifacts from stone
resources involves a sequence of acts or
techniques beginning with acquisition of
raw material and proceeding through a
series of manufacturing steps to the
finished item . . . (Shafer 1973: 43).

Within this sequence, the expectation is that there will ~e
more primary and secondary flakes at sites where the lithic
reduction process began with the decortification of chert
cobbles than at sites where the process commenced at some
intermediate stage between unmodified chert cobble and finished
artifact. At these sites, fewer primary and secondary flakes
and more interior flakes and chips would be expected. It is
of course possible for the whole sequence to be represented
at one site.
In the tables above, percentages of primary and secondary
flakes are low, running between 4 and 5 percent. The secondary
flakes. slightly exceed 5 percent only in the upper zones at
41 AU 37. Interior flakes and chips predominate at all sites,
normally comprising 40 to 50 percent of the collections. At
41 AU 37, there is a noticeably higher percentage of interior
flakes and a lower percentage of chips.
In a similar study of collections from six sites in Fayette
County to the west of Allens Creek, Skelton (1977) arrived at
the following average percentages for a composite of the debi­
tage collections: primary flakes 2 percent; secondary flakes,
7 percent; interior flakes 39 percent; and chips, 52 percent.
To Skelton, the low percentages of primary and secondary flakes
suggested that initial decortification of chert cobbles was
taking place somewhere away from the sites, probably at the
source of the materials.
To the extent that the data may be considered reliable, a
similar situation is suggested for the A11ens Creek sites. The
closest sources of usable chert in the area include occasional
surface exposures of gravel on the Brazos flood platn and the
gravel bars along the Brazos River where chert cobbles of a
relatively large size are common and readily accessible at low
water. Bernard and LeBlanc (1965) believe that these have
eroded out of the Pliocene Goliad Formation and the Pleistocene
Willis Formation. Cherts in the Goliad " . . . were derived
largely from the Cretaceous rocks west of Austin . . . " while
" . . . the composition of the Willis gravels indicates that they
were derived from sources farther removed from the Gulf Coast."
The size, color, and quality of cherts used in producing the
chipped stone artifacts found at 41 AU 37,41 AU 37, and 41 AU
38 are, with notable exceptions, identical to those of cherts
presently found at these sources.
The problem with gathering these cherts is the difficulty,
even for the expert, in discerning chert from quartzites and
other less desirable materials. Without first removing the
cortex, it is almost impossible to distinguish one material
from another.
.
Once found, it is further important to assess the quality
and workability of the chert tn the particular cobble selected.
Cherts with undesirable fracture planes, fossils, and crystalline
inclusions are not uncommon from these sources. However, the

ARTIFACTS

173

cores and debitage recovered from the sites suggest that cherts
free of these imperfections were being selected for tool manufa~­
ture by the aborigines.
A third factor to consider is distance of the chert sources
from the three sites. Presently located within 4.5 km. of the
sites, the Brazos River could have, at a given time in the
past, been anywhere from directly below the sites to a distance
of 15 or more kilometers away on the eastern side of the valley.
Assuming that the river and its gravel bars were at the great­
est possible distance from the sites, the effort required to
transport the chert from source to site might be considerable.
In light of these consideration~ and recalling the precent­
age relationships of primary/secondary flakes to interior
flakes and chips, it does not seem unreasonable to suggest that
much of the decortification, and perhaps some further reduction,
were taking place at the source of the materials, that is,
somewhere removed from the sites themselves.

GROUND STONE
Eighteen ground stone artifacts, including seven boatstones,
one gorget, four abraders, a grinding stone, and five grinding
slab fragments, were found at 41 AU 36; the boatstone, gorget
and one abrader were associated with Group 2 burials. Also
recovered was a boatstone from 41 AU 37 and a grinding stone
from 41 AU 38.
For the eight specimens discussed below, the following
information has been given:
1) specimen identification number - the number of the
specimen within the descriptive category followed by
the artifact catalog lot number in parenthesis;
2) horizontal provenience - the unit from which the speci­
men was recovered;
3) vertical provenience - the zone from which the artifact
was recovered or the burial with which it was
associated;
4} dimensions of the artifacts - the maximum length,
maximum width, height from the apex of the exterior
surface to the lip of the side wall, and the depth of
concavity, all in centimeters, and the weight of the
artifact in grams;
5} illustration - the figure in which the artifact is
illustrated;
6} remarks - a discussion of material used in manufacture,

Remarks - For all specimens, the basic shape is rectangular
in plan view and plano-convex in longitudinal cross section.
Except for Specimen 1, the side walls of all specimens are
perpendicular to the exterior face. The ends of all specimens
are rounded.
Specimen 1 - The specimen is comprised of a lightly
metamorphosed sand and shale or siltstone. The surface of
the material appears as contorted, interfingered bands of white
and gray. The probable source is the Ouachita Mountain region
of Arkansas. Running the length of the artifact, along the
contact of the side walls with the external face, are a series
of 3 mm.-long nicks perpendicular to the long axis of the
stone. They are spaced 3 mm. apart and there are approximately
thirty-four nicks on each side. One corner was broken away,
apparently prior to interment. Associated with Burial 217, this
boatstone was on the right side of the skeleton between the
lower arm and pelvis.
Specimen 2 - The specimen is a lamprophyre, or porphyritic
igneous rock having a gray groundmass containing numerous shiny,
black euhedral phenocrysts and a lesser number of circular white
crystals. The probable source is the Ouachita Mountain region
near Little Rock, Arkansas. The side walls, though perpen­
dicular to the exterior face, contract from the ends to the
middle making the width 4 mm. narrower at the apex than at
the ends. Associated with Burial 13, the original position of
this artifact relative to the skeleton was distrubed by machine
excavation.

175

ARTIFACTS

Specimen 3 - The specimen is made of nepheline syenite, an
igneous material compos~d of a granular aggregate alkalic
feldspar, nepheline, and an alkalic ferromagnesian constituent
(American Geological Institute 1962). The matrix of the rock is
a light gray speckled with black and brown. The probable source
is the Ouachita Mountain region. This specimen tapers from a
width of 4 cm. at one end to 3.8 cm. at the other. The specimen
was found in an area disturbed by Ernest Witte's pothole; it
could not be definitely assigned to a burial.
Specimen 4 - The artifact is an igneous rock having mineral
constituents similar to Specimens 2 and 3, but with a much
finer crystalline structure. The probable source for the
material is the Ouachita Mountain region. The matrix of this
rock is black with spots and veins of a white mineral. This
specimen was associated with Burial 89; it lay on the right
hand side of the skeleton above the pelvis between the lower
a rm and s pin e .
Specimen 5 - This specimen is made of a glauconitic
sandstone having a brown matrix with green inclusions. The
closest regional sources of this material are in east and
central Texas. The exterior face is more rounded than angular.
The specimen was found on the left side atop the pelvis of
Burial 190.
Specimen 6 - The artifact is made of a dusky red (10YR3/2),
fine-grained, iron-rich quartzite. Due to the widespread
occurrence of this type of rock, no specific source area can be
given. This specimen tapers from a width of 3.7 cm. at one
end to 3.4 cm. at the other. This stone was found with Specimen
7 off the left upper arm of Burial 23 (Fig. 16B).
Specimen 7 - The material is a yellowish red (5YR4/6)
fine-grained quartzite for which no specific sour<e area can
be given. This specimen is shorter and wider than all other
specimens and was found with Specimen 6 off the left upper arm
of Burial 23 (Fig. 16B).

One boatstone was surface collected at 41 AU 37 by Leonard
Ko10dziejczyk as it eroded from the bluff face on the north
side of the site. Shorter than all specimens recovered at

176

ALLENS CREEK

41 AU 36, this boatstone is made of a marbled very pale brown
(10YR7/4) and brownish yellow (lOYR6/6] quartzite. The specimen
tapers slightly from one end to the other and the side walls
contract slightly making the width at the exterior apex narrower
than at the ends.
Distribution and Sources of Boatstones
In a bulletin entitled "Boat-shaped Artifacts of the Gulf
Southwest States," J.T. Patterson (1937a) plotted by county
and parish the distribution of 528 boatstones reported to him
by artifact collectors and archeologists in the four-state area
of Texas, Louisiana. Arkansas. and Oklahoma. Also reported
were the dimensions and material used in the manufacture of
each specimen.
The distribution map synthesized by Patterson demonstrates
that an overwhelming number of the 528 boatstones used in the
study were found in a 14-county area of west central and south­
west Arkansas. Specimens recorded for these counties totaled
329. Significantly, these counties cover the Ouachita Moun­
tains, the likely source of the igneous and metamorphic materials
used in the manufacture of four of the boatstones from 41 AU
36. The materials most common to the Arkansas representatives
were chert. clay ironstone, sandstone, diabase. sanidine
porphyry, syenites. and trachyte.
In Texas, most of Patterson's eighty-six recordings fell
1n the central and northeast counties of the state. Two
specimens occurred outside this general area, one in Taylor
County and the other in Aransas County. Patterson noted that
no boatstones had been reported for south or west Texas and that
only one, the Aransas County specimen, had been found along
the coast.
Limestone (thirty-two specimens) and sandstone (seventeen
specimens) were the two most common materials represented in
the Texas collection. Twenty-nine of the limestone specimens
were found in central Texas where limestone is a plentiful,
readily available resource. In the other three states combined,
there were only six limestone specimens repor.ted. The impres­
sion rendered is that boatstones were being manufactured in
Texas out of locally available materials. The glauconitic
sandstone and quartzites in Specimens 5, 6, and 7 from 41 AU
36 could very easily have had their origin in Texas. The shell
columella atlatl weight described in the "Shell Artifacts"
section is also an indication that boatstones, or objects
intended for use in the same manner as boatstones, were being
produced out of locally available material.
Patterson concludes his report by stating that:
If numbers are significant, then southwest
Arkansas must represent the center from which

ALLENS CREEK

178

the boatstone culture spread out in the
various directions, especially toward the
southwest. This suggestion is supported by
the shape of that portion of the distributional
area which lies in Texas, and is further
strengthened oy the absence of all boatstones
(except for a few trade specimens) in south
and west Texas. The boatstone culture clearly
entered Texas from the northeast.
Limitations resulting from differential rates of collecting
and reporting from one region to another are inherent in a study
such as Patterson's. However, in the forty years of investiga­
tion subsequent to that puo1tcation, archeologists' and' collect­
ors have recovered little information which significantly
alters the general trends observed by Patterson in 1937.
There still have been no boatstones reported from south and west
Texas. Only three new reports have been made for the coast,
two in Ft. Bend County, 41 FB 2 and 41 FB 13, and, in Austin
County, the specimens from 41 AU 36 and 41 AU 37. As a side­
note, three bannerstone fragments have been found in Victoria
(41 VT 1), Austin (41 AU 1). and Harris (41 HR 84) counties.
In Texas, boatstones for which reasonable contextual
information is recorded have been recovered from the Fall Cree~
sites (Jackson and Woolsey 1938), the Albert George site
(Walley 1955). and the Jonas Short site (Jelks 1965). At the
Fall' Creek sites (41 LL 4) in Llano County, two boats tones
were recovered from a burned rock midden. Little can be said
about their chronological placement except that they are
probably Archaic. One of these specimens was manufactured out
of Ellenburger limestone. At the Albert George Site (41 FB
13) in Ft. Bend County. a boatstone virtually identical in
form and material to Specimen 2 from 41 AU 36 was found
associated with a group of four burials. This boatstone, as
well as associated bone and shell artifacts, indicates that this
component of 41 FB 13 is contemporary with Burial Group 2 at
41 AU 36. In northeast Texas, excavations at the Jonas Short
site (41 SA 101) yielded two boatstones, both of an igneous
material probably coming from the Ouachita Mountains. On the
basis of copper reel gorgets, boatstones, and distinctive
burial practices recorded at the site, Jelks (1965) suggested
an Adena or early Hopewell affiliation.
Gorget
One ground stone gorget manufactured out of nepheline
syenite, a material identical to that used in Boatstone
Specimen 3, was found between the femurs of Group 2 Burial 171A.
Shaped like a diamond with rounded corners, the specimen has
maximum dimensions as follows: length - 19.3 cm.; width -'

ARTIFACTS

179

8.1 cm.; and thickness - 0.8 cm. Width at each end is
approximately 3.3 cm. Two biconical perforations are situated
down the medial long axis of the gorget. Relative to the
medial short axis, the perforations are off-center, one being
1.2 cm. from the centerline and the other 3.6 cm. from the
centerlin~.
This specimen is illustrated in Figure 40.
Abraders
Four abraders, one of graphite schist and three of sand­
stone, came from Zones 3A and 3B at 41 AU 36. All four are
illustrated in Figure 39. Dimensions and descriptions for each
specimen are as follows:
Specimen 1 - This artifact is manufactured out a dark gray
to black graphite schist, a material probably obtained in the
llano Uplift region of central Texas. Subcircular and slightly
elongate, this specimen is 10.3 cm. long, 7.1 cm. wide, and 1.5
cm. thick. Grit in this abrader is a silt. (smaller than 74
microns), on the Wentworth (1922) size scale. On one surface,
two long (6 cm.), V-shaped channels are worn into the rock.
Numerous short, hairline striations parallel these channels.
On the other surface is a U-shaped depression covering roughly
one-third of the face of the artifact; this area is also cover­
ed with scratches. Specimen 1 was found atop a bundle of
worked bone artifacts associated with Group 2 Burial 124
(Fig. 39). This context suggests that the abrader was used
to smooth and/or sharpen bone artifacts of the type found
underneath. The abrasive qualities of graphite schists are
attributed to the fine quartz grains contained in the schist
matrix. Though such a fine, soft abrasive would not be prac­
tical for rough shaping of artifacts, it does seem ideally
suited for finishing and polishing.
Specimen 2 - The specimen is an angular sandstone frag­
ment having a length of 13 cm., a width of 10.5 cm., and a
thickness of 2 cm. The grit is sized 74 to 500 microns, very
fine to coarse on the Wentworth size scale. Both faces of
this specimen are smoothed over their entire surfaces. One
surface is flat while the other is slightly humped. Provenience
of this artifact is unknown.
Specimen 3 - This artifact is a subrectangular sandstone
fragment having a length of 13.3 cm., width of 7.7 cm., and
thickness of 2.3 cm. Grit is sized 74 microns, very fine on
the Wentworth size scale. The entire surface of one face has
been ground smooth; the other face has an area of 7.5 cm. by
4 cm. showing grooving. The artifact was found in the Feature
7 area of Zone 3A.
Specimen 4 - This specimen is a circular sandstone
with a diameter of 7.6 cm. and a thickness of 1.8 cm. The
grit in this abrader is graded fine, 149 microns, on the

ALL ENS CREEK

180

Wentworth size scale. In profile, this abrader is discus­
shaped, being thicker in the middle than at the edges. Both
faces are convex and completely smooth. The specimen was found
in close proximity to Group 2 Burial 3 but direct association
with the burial was not absolutely indicated. The artifact was
recovered from Zone 38, N102 W102.
Grinding Stones
A probable grinding stone consisting of a subcircular piece
of sandstone with a maximum diameter of 11.4 cm. was recovered
during machine excavation at 41 AU 36. The original provenience
of the artifact is unknown. One face of the object is relatively
flat and gritty while the other. the presumed working surface,
is concave and smooth. The grit in this grinder is graded very
fine to coarse (75 to 500 microns} on the Wentworth size scale.
The specimen is illustrated in Figure 39.
A fragment of quartzite grinding stone was found on ground
surface at the foot of the bluff below 41 AU 38. The subrec­
tangular fragment is ground smooth on two faces. A battered
area at one end of the object suggests that it may have been
used as a hammerstone. Maximum dimensions for the artifact are
9.4 x 6.4 x 4.4 cm. The artifact is illustrated in Figure 42.
Grinding Slab Fragments - 41 AU 36
By virtue of their smoothed faces and distinctive curvature,
five angular rock fragments, three of sandstone and two of
limestone, are believed to be pieces of grinding slabs, The
following information for the specimens is provided below:
l} specimen identification number - the number of the
specimen followed by the artifact catalog number in
parenthesis.
2) horizontal provenience - the unit from which the speci­
men was recovered.
3) vertical provenience - the zone from which the specimen
was recovered.
4) dimensions of the artifacts - the maximum length and
maximum width of the artifacts, in centimeters,

MISCELLANEOUS LITHIC ARTIFACTS
Red Jasper Pebbles
Four stream-rolled, red (10R4/8) jasper pebbles (Fig. 40)
were found beneath the skull of Group 2 Burial 93, a bundle
burial at 41 AU 36. Diameters on the pebbles range from 2.8
cm. to 3.6 cm. The pebbles were clustered within a 36 sq. cm.
area beneath the skull. The rock type is not indicative of a
specific source area.
Subcircular Perforated Rock
This small, perforated rock (fig. 40) was associated with
Group 3 Burial 154 at 41 AU 36, It has an overall diameter of
2.5 cm. and a perforation diameter of 0.9 cm, The material is
a red (2.5YR5/8) sandstone. The irregular shape of the hole
through the object suggests that it may have been a natural
formation. The artifact was located in the nasal area of the
sku 11 .
Ocher
Ocher, or iron hematite, was associated with the following
19 Group 2 burials at 41 AU 36: 3, 11, 18. 19, 31, 9.8a. 99a,
111,112,126,156,166,173,188,190,195,198, and 203. In
all of these cases, the ocher was in powdered or finely
granulated form. It was normally found in the head and chest
area, rarely in the pelvis and leg area. ,One large chunk of
an ironstone concretion having a natural outer coating of red
ocher was found in Zone 3A with no definite association to a
burial. This chunk shows numerous scratches and gouges, perhaps
resulting from attempts at scraping away the ocher. See Figure
40 for an illustration. Ocher samples were collected from
Burials 3,166,195, and 203.

ALLENS CREEK

184

A hematite (red ocher) pebble having a diameter of 1.6 cm.
was recovered from Levell of Unit N100 W105, at 41 AU 38.
Graphitic Biotite Schist
Coarsely granulated graphitic biotite schist was found
scattered over the chest areas of Group 2 Burials 111 and 112
at 41 AU 36. The biotite content of this lead-gray rock gives
it a sparkling appearance. The closest regional source of this
material is the Llano Uplift of central Texas. A sample is
illustrated in Figure 20.
Hammerstones
Four elliptical quartzite artifacts exhibiting end batter­
ing, indicative of use as hammers, were recovered at 41 AU 36
(Fig. 40). The color, dimensions, and provenience are given
for each.

Lithic Residues
Included under this heading are burned clay nodules,
sandstone fragments, and calcium carbonate concretions recovered
either as matrix constituents during screening operations
or as elements of hearths. Some of this material might be
considered artifactual to the extent that it was utilized by
aborigines in the construction of hearths or, as in the case of
burned clay, was an indirect result of human activity, Much of
the sandstone and carbonate is not believed to be artifactual
but simply a natural accumulation.
In Figure 43, the actual kilogram weights of each kind of
material are presented as well as the percentage relationships
of the materials to one another. For sites 41 AU 36 and 41 AU
37 there are two graphs, one giving weights and percentages, by
zone, for materials recovered in the screens and the other
dealing with those materials used in hearth construction. For
41 AU 38 a single graph is used to present all lithic residue
data for the site.
In general, the graphs demonstrate an increase in burned
clay from earliest to latest deposits with a corresponding
decrease in the occurrence of sandstone and calcium carbonate.
At 41 AU 36 the inverse relationship of the burned clay to sand­
stone and calcium carbonate is attributed to the gradual
covering of Zones 1 and 2 by san~ deposited in the depression
containing the site. It is believed that angular sandstones,
a component of the Montgomery Formation (Zone 1), and calcium
carbonate of the weathered Montgomery surface (Zone 2) were more
readily available for aboriginal utilization, and for natural
incorporation into accumulating fill, during the earlier periods
of activity at 41 AU 36 than during the later periods.
More calcium carbonate was recovered at 41 AU 36 than at
the other sites. It is believed that the unique depression
containing the site acted as a catchment basin where higher-than­
normal amounts of water accumulated. Water drainage into the
depression, coupled with exposure of the surface over a long
period of time, created an environment ideally suited to the
formation of carbonates.
A possible explanation for the increase in the percentage
of burned clay through time is that construction of hearths,
containing less sandstone and calcium carbonate on top of sand
containing higher ratios of clay and silt, would result in the
unintentional production of fired or burned clay beneath and
around the hearths. The validity of this explanation is support­
ed by the constitution of the various hearth features found in
the site. Hearths occurring in Zone 3A, Features 7 and 8 for
example, were composed totally of calcium carbonate. In contrast,
Feature 12 in Zone 4' consisted of 50 percent burned clay and
smaller percentages of sandstone and calcium carbonate.
At 41 AU 37, a similar situation is evidenced except that
there is less calcium carbonate and more sandstone in the

earlier deposits. The depositional sequence at this site was
much the same as at 41 AU 36, with the important exception that
the surface of the Montgomery Formation had no readily discern­
ible calcium carbonate crust as characterized by Zone 2 at 41 AU
36; the absence of this crust probably explains the lower per­
centage of carbonate. Hearths at 41 AU 37 again show greater use
of sandstone and carbonate during the early periods (Features 1,
2, and 3) with less sandstone and carbonate and more burned clay
in the later periods (Feature 5).
In a setting much different from 41 AU 36 and 41 AU 37,
41 AU 38 yielded high percentages of burned clay and sandstone
and very little calcium carbonate. With the site resting on the
surface of the Beaumont Formation, the high percentage of burned
clay probably resulted from the unintentional firing of clays
around hearths. Sandstone, comprising over 40 percent of the
total, was probably imported to the site from nearby exposures
of the Montgomery as at 41 AU 37. As far as could be determined,
there were no sandstones occurring naturally on the site or
along the bluff face below the site. The small amount of calcium
carbonate recovered was undoubtedly a natural accumulation at
the site. Calcium carbonate horizons composed of pea-sized
nodules, the same as recovered in the excavations, were seen in
the walls of trenches cutting down into the unaltered Beaumont
clays beneath the soil cap containing the site.
Shell Artifacts
A majority of the shell artifacts recovered from sites at
Allens Creek were manufactured out of portions of a large,
marine gastropod known as the lightning, or lefthanded, whelk.
Under the widely accepted species designation Busyaon aontrarium,
the lightning whelk occurs commonly along the coasts of Texas,
Alabama, and Florida in the Gulf of Mexico and along the eastern
seaboard from Florida to South Carolina. Hollister (1958) has
perceived distinct sub-groups within this species and recommends
the formation of two new species, Busyaon (Sinistrofulgur)
sinistrum and Busyaon (Sinistrofulgur) pulleyi.
In distinguish­
ing the two species, Hollister cites differences in spire
construction as being the major criteria. According to Hollister,
B. sinist~um is found along the eastern seaboard from Hatteras
to Florida and on the Gulf coast of Florida as far west as
Mobile Bay. B. puZleyi occurs along the northern Mexican and
Texas coasts eastward to Breton Sound, louisiana. These suggest­
ed changes are under consideration and await general acceptance
(Andrews 1971).
In this report, B. aont~arium will be used to refer to the
species out of which many of the shell artifacts were made,
Though complete enough to recognize as B. aont~a~ium~ none of
the shell artifacts recovered retain enough of their original

character to be recognized as either of the tentative new
species. Hollist~r's work is cited chiefly as an aid to future
investigators. Where relatively intact specimens of the lightning
whelk are found in archeological context, especially at inland
sites far removed from coastal areas, the differentiation between
the two species might help to determine the marine source of the
shell, whether it be Texas or Florida and the east coast.
The lightning whelk ranges in length from 10 to 45 cm.
The large, stout shell is subpyriform in shape and is
sinistrally twisted. The aperture is large. The spire is low
and there are well-developed spines on the shoulder. The height
of the spire is normally about one-fifth the height of the shell.
while the width at the shoulder is one-half the height. When
young, the shell's color is pale fawn to light yellowish gray
with long axial wavy brown streaks. The adult shell loses its
color, becoming gray or chalky white (Andrews 1971). B.
contrarium's habitat includes offshore, intertidal, and bay areas.
It is easily caught when found in shallow bay waters. The flesh
is edible (Magalhaes 1948).
B. contrarium is one of only two sinistrally coiled gastro­
pods found in U.S. coastal waters. The other is B. perversum
which has a pronounced spiral bulge across the back of the body
whorl. B. contrarium., in contrast, has a smooth, tapering spiral.
Pendants in six of the categories discussed later in this section
are, by virtue of their sinistral twists and smooth body whorls,
thought to be made from B. aontrarium.
Many of the columella beads from 41 AU 36 retain vestiges of
the natural spiralling groove characteristic of the unaltered
gastropod columella. Holding the long axis of one of these
beads vertically, the natural groove is seen to spiral from
lower right to upper left, indicating that the columella used
in production of the bead is from a sinistral gastropod (Calhoun
1965b). Though the sh~ll utilized could be either B. perversum
or B. contrarium., it is felt that B. contrarium is a more likely
possibility as so many of the pendants are made from this
species and because it occurs so commonly along portions of the
Texas coast.
The common rice olive, OLiveLLa deaLbata., was the second
most common species used in the manufacture of shell artifacts
recovered at 41 AU 36. It is a small shell, the length range
being from 6 to 9 mm. The rice olive is found from North
Carolina to both sides of Florida. the West Indies, and Texas.
Color is variable but is usually glossy white or cream. The
habitat for O. deaLbata is in sandy inlet areas. During the
winter, these shells will sometimes wash up by the thousands
on the outer beaches (Andrews 1971). Idel'ltification of the olive
shells in the 41 AU 36 collection was not difficult as most of
the shells were complete except for the removal of a small
part of the apex.
Five specimens represent four other marine shell species
found at the A11ens Creek sites. Two artifacts were made out

of the eastern oyster. Crassostrea virg~n~:a. A dull gray shell
from 5 to 15 cm. in length, the oyster inhabits brackish bays and
estuaries. C. virginica is found from the Gulf of St. Lawrence
to the Gulf of Mexico and the West Indies. Single specimens of
the spiny pen shell, Atrina seminuda> the common Atlantic
marginella, Prunuum (leptegouana) apicina> and the lettered
alive. Oliva sayana> were also found. The spiny pen shell can
reach a length of 25 cm. and is colored a translucent, grayish-tan
sometimes mottled with purple. The shell inhabits offshore
waters and inlet-influenced bays. It is a fairly common
shell found along the eastern seaboard of the United States, in
Brazil, and in Texas. The common Atlantic marginella reaches
a length of 12 mm. and is polished cream, yellowish. or grayish
tan in color. It lives in shallow. grassy, inlet-influenced
areas. Though ranging from North Carolina to Florida. the Gulf
states, and the West Indies. the marginella is an uncommon shell.
In Texas, it is only found from Port Aransas south and is
rarely reported al ive (Andrews 1971). The 1ettered 01 ive reaches
a length of 2 to 2~ inches and has an elongated oval shape. The
living shell has a polished cream-colored background with
numerous brownish zigzag markings. The shell occurs commonly in
inlets and offshore from North Carolina to Florida and the Gulf
states (Andrews 1971).
Though fragments of several freshwater mussel shells showed
signs of intentional modification, identification as to species
of shell utilized was possible in only one case. One artifact
is believed to be made out of the shell of the giant washboard
mussel, Megalonaias gigantea. This large. heavy bivalve 1s
common in the midwestern U.S .• parts of Canada, and as far south
as northern Mexico. M. gigantea typically occurs in large
streams having deep water and quiet places with muddy bottoms
(Murray and Leonard 1962).
SHELL ARTIFACTS - 41 AU 36
A total of 442 shell artifacts representing six speCies,
five marine and one freshwater, were recovered at 41 AU 36.
With only a few exceptions, most of the shell artifacts collect­
ed were directly associated with Group 2 burials. Scattered,
singular occurrences of tubular shell beads, small pendants,
and pendant fragments in the levels directly above and below the
Group 2 burials, were probably a result of post-depositional
movement attributable to disturbances by rodents, intrusive
burials, and modern. non-archeological excavations. There was no
obvious association of any of these shell artifacts with either
Group 1 or Group 3 burials.
With three notable exceptions, the shell artifacts recovered
at 41 AU 36 are believed to have served as ornaments. The
ornamental function of many of the specimens was inferred from

ALLENE CREEK

the archeological context. Most of the shells were found in
the upper torso or neck area of the skeletons with perforations
positioned to suggest suspension from the neck. In some cases,
beads still retained an alignment suggesting that they had b~en
strung on a cord around the neck. A columella atlatl weight,
an unmodified oyster shell, and a notched mussel shell were
artifacts serving in utilitarian and/or unknown function
classes.
Artifacts in the ornament class include pendants and beads.
For descriptive purposes the pendants have been subdivided into
fifteen forms and the beads into eight forms on the basis of
overall shape, position of perforations, and species of shell
used in manufacture.
In the following section, data pertaining to form categories
and individual specimens are presented. Unless otherwise
indicated, measurements given in the text and tables are in
centimeters.
Pendants
For the specimens described in this category, the following
information has been provided:
(1) Specimen ID Number - the number of the specimen within
the descriptive category followed by the artifact

specimen was recovered.
(3) Vertical Provenience - the zone or burial from which the
artifact was recovered.
(4) Dimensions - the maximum length; maximum width; maximum
thickness, and perforation diameter, of the specimen
in cms.
(5) Illustration - the figure in which the artifact is
illustrated.

asterisk (*).
Form 1 - 26 Specimens
Fashioned out of the body and penultimate whorls of B.
the shape of this pendant is largely a reflection of
the natural lines of the shell from which the piece is manufac­
tured. Each pendant incorporates a portion of a whelk shell

contrarium~

196

ALLENS CREEK

bounded on the long axis by the anterior canal at one end and
the penultimate whorl suture or body suture at the other end.
The edges of the pendant are demarcated by the outer lip of the
shell and a line roughly paralleling the shell's axis across
the body whorl from posterior canal to penultimate whorl
suture. The resulting form is an elongate, subrectangu1ar to
subtriangular piece of shell exhibiting a gently twisting,
sinistral curvature. On the specimens where the penultimate
whorl section has been incorporated, an abrupt upturn is fo~med
at the posterior end of the shell (Fig. 44).
Modifications on this basic form include abrasion and
perforation. On the exterior surface of the shell, the spines
between the body and penultimate whorls are completely oblit­
erated leaving a smoothed area showing marks of abrasion. The
growth lines, though abraded smooth, still show very clearly
on most specimens. The edges and ends of the pendant are blunted
and ground smooth with the penultimate whorl slightly rounded
and the anterior surface tapered and smoothed. Along the axis
edge near the center of the shell there are normally two, but
sometimes one or three, conical or biconica1 perforations; the
archeological context suggests that these perforations served
to suspend the pendant very snugly around the neck of the
wearer with the interior surface of the shell facing out
(Figs. 15, 160, 20). On some specimens, these holes are glossed
and reshaped, possibly by the action of the pendant moving back
and forth on the suspension cord. In addition, each specimen
has two or three perforations variously spaced down the center
of the long axis of the shell. Two of the pendants have single
holes on the edge opposite the suspension holes. The function
of these holes could not be deduced from the archeological
context of the specimens. It is speculated, however, that
their purpose was either to secure the pendant to underlying
clothing or to hold some form of additional decoration.
Two specimens were broken and subsequently repaired prior
to their inclusion with burials. Opposing sets of mend holes
are drilled at intervals along the edges of the break. On one
specimen, small dots of a black substance believed to be
asphaltum are seen at two points on the faces of the break in
the shell.

Form 2 - 6 Specimens
Form 2 pendants are made from the same portion of the
whelk shell as are Form 1 pendants except that the penultimate
whorl section is not included. Other differences include posi­
tion and number of perforations, overall shape, and finishing.
These pendants have only two conical or biconical perforations
placed on the center line of tHe long axis in the midsection
area of the shell. The most distinctive characteristic of the
pendant form is that the posterior end of the shell is ground
to a chevron-like point. As there is no penultimate whorl
section on these pendants, the posterior end does not make the
abrupt upturn seen in the Form 1 specimens. Form 2 pendants

ALLENS CREEK

198

thus appear somewhat flatter than Form 1. While more care is
taken to blunt and smooth the edges, there is little or no
smoothing of the growth lines on the exterior of the shell.
This is in sharp contrast to the Form 1 pendants, the growth
lines on which are smootned almost to obliteration. With one
exception, the pendants were found in the neck area of the
skeletons with which they were associated. No inferences could
be made about the exact method of suspension of this form.

From the body whorl of B. aontrarium, Form 5 pendants are
narrow. subrectangular shell pieces with both edge and long
axial perforations. All four specimens have two biconica1
perforations on the center line of the long axis in the mid­

Form 6 - 1 Specimen
This pear-shaped pendant is fashioned out of the body
whorl of a large B. aontrarium shell in a manner similar to
the Form 1 pendants except that there is greater width and less
length utilized and the penultimate whorl section is absent.
There are two biconical perforations at the apex (anterior
end) of the shell. Edges are blunted and smoothed by abrasion
and exterior growth lines are smoothed.

Form 7 - 2 Specimens
The two Form 7 pendants are subtriangular pieces made from
the body whorl of B. aontrarium. They are similar in shape to
Form 1 pendants except that the penultimate whorl section is
not included. Form 7 pendants are distinguished by the single
biconical perforation at the apex (anterior end) of the shell
and by parallel rows of small conical depressions drilled
into the interior surface of the shell. Edges and ends are
bblunted and smoothed by abrasion. The growth lines on the
exteriors of these shells h~ye been almost obliterated by
abrasive smoothing.
The conical depressions in the surface of Specimen 1 form
an inverted "T" when the shell is viewed with the apex up.
The Til is composed of four sets of dotted lines, two sets
running across the posterior edge (bottom} of the pendant and
the other two sets perpendicular to the first and following the
long axis up the center, roughly half the length of the shell.
A black substance, possibly asphaltum, is seen in most of the
depressions on this specimen.
Specimen 2 has a set of conical depressions running down the
longitudinal middle of the pendant, interrupted at the center
of the shell by a 1 em. diameter hole. The two lines, as well
as the individual dots, are more widely spaced than those on
Specimen 1. A black substances is seen in six of the depressions~
The posterior edge (bottom) of this pendant 1s badly eroded.

This group of pendants is made out of the body whorl of

characteristics to make a definite species identification. All
are subcircular with diameters from 6.0 to 7.4 ems. Four of
the specimens have a single biconical perforation through the

in the middle of the shell and one along the edge. Another has
two perforations spaced 1 cm. apart at the edge of the shell,

Specimens

As with Form 8, these pendants are made out of the body
and penultimate whorls of large shells, probaoly B. contpapium~
but do not retain enough of the characteristic& necessary to make
a positive identification. All are very irregularly shaped,
ranging from subcircular to subrangular. The greatest dimension
of any of the shells does not exceed 4.5 cm. All are more or
less centrally perforated with biconical holes. Edges are
abraded to various degrees of smoothness.

Form 10 - 6 Specimens
Rectangular to triangular in outline, these pendants are
probably fashioned out of the body whorl of B. aontpapium~
though a positive identification as to species is impossible.
All specimens are biconically perforated at one end with edges
and flat surfaces abraded smooth. Four of the specimens, all
associated with the same burial, expand slightly at the end
opposite the perforation; this end is ground to a chevronshaped point. The remaining two specimens are roughly triangular
and have straight or rounded ends.

Untyped Pendant Fragments - 5 Specimens
These five specimens are believed to be fragments of
pendants but are not complete enough to definitely assign to
any of the above forms. All are made from the body whorls of
large shells. probably B. contpapium. Specimen 1 is similar in
general outline to Forms 3 and 4; it has a single perforation
near the center of the midsection. Specimen 2 is a sUbrectangu­
1ar fragment with two biconica1 perforations, one at each end.
Specimen 3 has a design of conical depressions similar to the
two specimens in Form 7. All that survives, however, is a sub­
circular fragment giving little impression of the original
shape. Specimen 4 is a long sliver with no perforations or
decorations.

Beads
Form 1 - 220 Specimens
Form
beads are made out of shell columella sections
ranging in length from 1.4 to 5.5 crn. with the majority being
from 2.4 to 3.3 cm. The exterior surface is ground and smoothed
into a roughly tubular shape. In most cases abrasion is inten­
sive enough to obliterate the natural columella groove seen in
an unmodified columella. Maximum outside diameters range from
0.7 to 1.6 cm. with the majority being from 0.9. to 1.2 cm.
These beads are biconically perforated from end to end. maximum
diameter of the perforations ranges from 0.3 toO.6 cm.
Sixty-six of 220 Form 1 beads are recognizable as columellae
from sinistral gastropod species, probably B. contpapium.
Provenience: B-3l, 76; B-3, 32; B-11, 21; B-l11, 19;
B-124, 26; B-217, 15; B-172, 2; Scattered with no burial
association, 28.
.
Illustrations: Figures 18, 20, and 48.
Form 2 - 37 Specimens
Form 2 beads differ from Form 1 beads in arrangement of
perforations and in average maximum length. Length of this
type ranges from 1,9 to 5.1 cm. with most being from 3.1 to
4.2 cm. Maximum outside diameters range from 0.9 to 1,6 with
the majority being from 1.1 to 1,3 cm. four conical perfora­
tions, resulting in two angled holes, are the most distinctive
feature of this type. Conical perforations from 1/4 to 1/3
the length of the bead are made from each end of the columella;
these are met by two perforations drilled in at angles from the
longitudinal midsection of the bead. Maximum diameter of
perforations ranges from 0.3 to 0.6 cm. Thirteen of the thirty­

seven Form 2 beads are recognizable as columellae of sinistral
gastropod species, probably B. aontrarium.

Illustrations: Figures 18, 20, and 48.
Form 3 - 1 Specimen
The single Form 3 bead is distinguished from the Form 1
. beads only by the arrangement of its perforations. This bead
is 4 cm. long and has an exterior diameter of 1.2 cm. It 1s
biconica11y perforated from end to end and has a third conical
perforation drilled from the exterior longitudinal midsection
to intersect the perforation running the length of the bead.
Maximum perforation diameter is 0.5 cm. This specimen is made
from the columella of a sinistral gastropod form, probably
B. aontrarium.

Provenience: B-31.
Illustrations: Figure 48.
Comment: Combinations of bead Forms 1, 2, and 3 formed eight
bead sets associated with six burials. With seven of the sets,
there were from 15 to 30 Form 1 beads and three to five Form 2
beads. One set had no Form 2 beads and one set contained the
single Form 3 bead. The generally larger size, unique design,
and occurrence proportional to Form 1 beads indicate that the
Form 2 beads were intentionally manufactured to serve a specific
purpose in each bead set. The purpose, however, could not be
inferred from the archeological context.
Form 4 - 1 Specimen
The one Form 4 specimen is a bicon1cal1y perforated, tubular
columella bead much like the Form 1 beads. It is 2.6 cm. long
and has an outside diameter of 0,8 cm, The bead is distinguished
from others by two geometric design panels engraved on the
exterior surface of the bead. One side of the specimen has a
diamond pattern running the length of the bead; the other half
has a feather-like design. Maximum perforation diameter is
0.5 cm.
Provenience: B-65.
Illustrations: Figure 48.
Form 5 - 12 Specimens
Form 5 beads are manufactured out of sinistral gastropod
columellae. These beads are generally longer than beads in
Types 1 through 4, being from 4.8 to 8,0 cm. in length. Maximum
exterior diameters range from 1.0 to 1.3 cm. Ground less than
Forms 1 through 4, the Form 5 beads still retain tne natural
spiralling columella groove and thus appear to be twisted.

Discussion 6f Bead Sets
The eight St'ts of beads made up by Forms 1, 2, and 3 varied
markedly in over 11 appearance when compared with one another.
The ninety speci ens associated with Burial 31 are generally
longer and have 1arger outside diameters than beads in the other
five sets lFig. 8}. The thirty-six specimens found with
Burial 3 are dis inguished by their relatively uniform lengths
and diameters, a well as their exceptionally smooth finish.

ALLENS CREEK

212

The twenty-four beads from Burial 11 are smaller in diameter,
have thinner walls, and appear more fragile and delicate than
the rest. The beads in sets from Burials 111 (Fig. 20), 124
and 217 show more variation in length and diameter, thus giving
the sets a slightly rough appearance as compared to the others.
Shell Artifacts - Utilitarian and Unknown Functions
Columella Atlatl Weight
This artifact consists of a section of shell columella 11
cm. long and 2.8 cm. wide. The columella comes from a
sinistrally twisted shell, probably B. aontrarium. In profi1 e
view, it is plano-convex with one surface ground flat and the
other ground to a slight hump. A shallow 6 cm. depression
running the length of the specimen is ground into the flat
surface. The ends of tnis depression slope up gradually to
within 2.5 cm. of either end of the columella. Greatest depth
of the depression from the plane of the flat surface is 0.3 cm.
On the convex surface, the natural rounding of the columella is
muted by a 1.3 cm. wide area of grinding running centrally the
length of the object. Some vestiges of the natural columella
groove remain, giving the artifact a slightly twisted appearance.
The approximate weight is 72 grams.
Provenience: Found in a disturbed area of Zone 3S. There
is no definite association with a burial, though it is believed
to have been a Group 2 grave inclusion.
Illustrations: Figure 38.

"V"-Notched Mussel Shell
A shell fragment of the giant washboard mussel ,YegaZonaiaa
is the raw material used in the manufacture of this
artifact. Portions of the outer lip and main body of the shell
valve are all that remain. A V-shaped notch cuts down into the
body of the shell from the area where the hinge and umbo would
have been. The "V" is approximately 3 cm. deep and is a
maximum of 2.2 cm. wide. The edges of the notch are rounded and
smoothed by abrasion. Overall length of the specimen is q.l cm.
and maximum width is 6.7 cm.

SHELL ARTIFACTS - 41 AU 37
Two fragments of a shell pendant (Fig. 30) were found
associated with Burial 2 at 41 AU 37. Similar to shell pendant
Form 7 from 41 AU 36, the specimen is roughly triangular in shape.
There is one biconical perforation at the apex of the triangle
and another centered down the long axis of the shell at 2.5 cm.
from the broad end. Both perforations have a maximum diameter
of 0.6 cm. Though the two fragments did not mend well, an
overall length of 11.3 cm. is estimated. Maximum width is 6,5
cm. It is assumed that the pendant was manufactured out of the
shell of the lightning whelk, B. contrarium, but positive
identification is not possible due to its fragmented condition.
The artifact was found in the upper chest area of the skeleton.
In addition to the single shell artifact recovered during
controlled excavations, an additional four shell ornaments were
surface-collected at the site by Leonard Ko10dziejczyk. With
one exception, these artifacts are identical to specimens
recovered at 41 AU 36. Shell Pendant Forms 3, 5, and 9 from
41 AU 36 are represented. The fourth specimen, manufactured
out of a lettered olive shell, is unique to 41 AU 37. Metric
attributes are given below for each of these shells.
Specimen 1 - This Form 3 pendant was unavailable for
measurement or illustration.
Specimen 2 - Similar to Form 5 from 41 AU 36, this specimen
(Fig. 41) was 8.0 cm. long, 3.2 cm. wide, and 0,3 cm. thick.
Diameter of perforations was from 0.3 to 0.4 cm.
Specimen 3 - A Form 9 pendant (Fig. 41}, this specimen was
5.7 cm. long, 3.6 cm. wide, and 0.4 cm. thick. Perforation
diameter was 0.7 cm.
Specimen 4 - This ornament (Fig. 41) was manufactured out
of a lettered olive shell (Oliva sayana) by grinding away the
apex to form a hole suitable for suspension. The shell is
otherwise unmodified. The length of t~e specimen is 4.6 cm.;
diameter, 2.0 cm; and perforation diameter, 0.4 cm.
SHELL ARTIFACTS - 41 AU 38
Though only one worked shell artifact was recovered during
controlled excavations at 41 AU 38, the son of the former land­
owner, Leonard Ko10dziejczyk, collected at least five large
columella artifacts as they eroded out of the face of the bluff
over a period of years. Leonard reports that these objects
were found in a restricted area along the bluff face and were
apparently associated with human burials.
The artifact recovered during excavations came from Level
2 of Unit N108 W124. It is 3.5 cm. long, 0.9 cm. wide, and
0.6 em. thick. The edges and ends are smooth and rounded.

214

ALLENS CREEK

Though too small for positive identification, the fragment may
have come from the spire section of a marine gastropod shell.
The specimen is illustrated in Figure 41.
The artifacts collected by Ko10dziejczyk (Fig. 41) were
manufactured out of the co11ume11ae of large specimens of the
marine gastropod Busycon contpapium. After removal of the body
whorl and spire sections from around these columellae, they
were smoothed and rounded by abrasion, though not nearly enough
to obliterate their natural twisting character. Biconical
perforations were then placed at each end. The three complete
specimens ranged from 15.0 cm. to 16.8 cm. in length and from
2.0 cm. t02.1 cm. in diameter. Perforation diameters ranged
from 0.3 cm. to 0.5 cm. One of two broken specimens had a
length of 7.7 cm. and a diameter of 1.9 cm.
NOTES ON MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES, REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION,
AND POSSIBLE SOURCE AREAS OF ARCHAIC-AGE MARINE SHELL
ARTIFACTS
There is no evidence indicating that marine shell artifacts
were manufactured at known aboriginal sites in the general
vicinity of A1lens Creek. All of the shells recovered at 41
AU 36,41 AU 37. and 41 AU 38 are apparently in finished form,
and there i~ no debris incidental to production of the artifacts.
On the basis of this negative evidence, production at other
localities is inferred.
One of the few knowri Texas localities that does have the
residues indicative of marine shell artifact production is
the Kent-Crane site, a shell midden located on Live Oak Point
north of Corpus Christi, Texas (Campbell 1952). This midden
is principally Archaic in age though there is evidence of a light
Late Prehistoric component.
The majority of the artifacts recovered from the Archaic
levels are fragments of large sinistral gastropod shells, in
stages of modification ranging from rough preform to finished
artifact. Though most of the finished artifacts are scrapers,
adzes, and gouges, there are two specimens that bear a strong
resemblance to certain of the shell ornaments found at 41 AU 36
and 41 AU 37. The collection also includes some twenty limestone
and sandstone abraders and many side-notched, corner-notched,
and straight stemmed bifaces.
The Kent-Crane shell artifact assemblage is of particular
relevance to the present study in that every stage in the
.
manufacture of the finished shell artifacts found at the site is
represented. In manufacturing the two po~sfble ornaments
found at Kent-Crane, the following production sequence would
probably be utilized. Beginning with the whole shell, the body
and penultimate whorl sections are broken away from the columella
a¥, spire by percussion, possibly using the columella and spire

215

ARTIFACTS

of another shell as a hammer. The sections of the body and/or
penultimate whorls are battered around the edges into a rough
preform of the finished artifact. Using a coarse limestone or
sandstone abrader, the edges and faces of the shell are ground
and smoothed into the final form. Biconical perforations are
made using a hafted bifacial chert drill and the artifact is
completed. Similar processes are described by Campbell (1952),
Story (1968), and Eaton (1974).
There are no reported sites of Archaic age in Texas that
might be considered production localities for shell columella
beads. In northern Mexico and southern Texas, however, a highly
refined shell industry of probably Late Prehistoric age is
evidenced in the A.E. Anderson Collection (Anderson 1932)
housed at Ba1cones Research Center. In this collection, the
manufacturing stages in the production of tubular columella
beads are remarkably well illustrated. Though disparate ages
and an Archaic sample biased towards finished artifacts rule out
direct comparison, steps in the making of tubular columella
beads are presented as being possible analogues to steps in
the production of beads found at 41 AU 36.
The stages in the manufacture of tubular shell beads, as
demonstrated by specimens in the Anderson Collection, are as
follows. Taking the whole shell, the body whorl and spire
are removed leaving nothing but the columella. The columella
is segmented into blanks of the desired bead length by abra~ins
a U-shaped notch around' the circumference of the columella where
the break is desired. This circular notch does not cut all the
way through the columella but only far enough to allow the
bead blank to be snapped off, probably by a sharp blow aimed at
the notch. The blank is then shaped and smoothed by abrasion
to the final form. The bead is biconically perforated to
complete the artifact.
An apparent tool kit associated with Burial 2 at the Caplen
Site (Campbell 1957: 452) provides ~dditional insight into bead­
making technique and suggests that bead manufacture was a female
activity. Included among the artifacts were two small flat
stones, fourteen chipped stone drills, two ~mall prismatic
flint flakes, two small flint dart points, six tubular shell
columella beads, and three undrilled shell columella segments
thought to be bead blanks. Campbell (1957: 459) describes most
of the drills as being rhomboidal or thickly lenticular in
cross section, from 18 to 40 mm. in length, 4 to 7 mm. in width,
4 to 5 mm. in thickness, and having slender, lozenge-like
outlines. He notes that the diameters of the drills are about
the same size as the perforations through the beads and that
the distal ends of ten specimens are worn and
feel smooth
to the touch."
Utilizing county records on file at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory, the data concerning the aboriginal sites
in eighty coastal and central Texas counties was reviewed in an
It • • •

216

ALLENS CREEK

attempt to determine the dist~ibution-of Archaic-age~maririe­
shell artifacts, particularly those manufactured out of large
gastropod shells in the region surrounding the Allens Creek
study area. This file search revealed that forty-one sites in
the region evidence such artifacts. In most cases, age
determination was based on the apparent association of the shells
with dart points diagnostic of the Texas Archaic.
It is interesting to note that tne majority of marine shell
artifacts found in Archaic context at the coastal sites are
utilitarian items such as scrapers, gouges, and adzes. Artifacts
thought to have an ornamental function comprise only a small
percentage of the total shell assemblage. On the other hand.
the Archaic sites in Austin and Fort Bend counties and in
central Texas yielded the ornamental shell work only.
The locations of the sites and the counties included in
the study are shown in Figure 49. The plotting of sites on a
map demonstrates a significant clustering in the vicinity of
Corpus Christi. and Copano and Lavaca bays along the south
central Texas coast. The Kent-Crane site, mentioned previously
as a shell artifact production center, is among those located
in the area. Of the hundreds of sites recorded at the northern
end of the Texas coast in the three counties surrounding
Galveston Bay, Chambers, Harris, and Galveston, only one site
evidenced a marine shell artifact is association with Archaic
remains. Given the relatively great amount of intensive
archeological survey and excavation that has gone on in these
counties, it is worthy to note that so few Archaic-age shell
artifacts have been found.
The question then arose as to whether this clustering of
sites was a culturally dictated phenomenon or merely a reflec­
tion of the differential availability of marine shell as a raw
material resource.
A search for literature concerned with the modern
distribution of B. aontrarium along the Texas coast was
fruitless. No such study has been done. In an attempt to better
document the distribution, habitat, and size tendencies of
the shell, knowledgeable marine scientists. including T.E.
Pulley of the Houston Museum of Natural Science, J.S. Holland of
the University of Texas at Austin Marine Science Institute,
H.W. Harry of Texas A&M University, and J.W. Tunnell of Texas
A&I University at Corpus Christi, and shell collectors Carl
Young of Corpus Christi, and Helmer Ode of Houston, were
contacted for information.
It was th~ consensus among these experts that the
occurrence of B. aontrarium in bays along the coast is regulated
primarily by water salinity. The organism prefers a normal
salinity environment and cannot tolerate brackish or hyper­
saline waters. A comparison of the average salinities of the
Texas bays reveals that, in general, the Galveston and Matagorda
bay complexes are brackish; Corpus Christi, Copano, Lavaca and

ARTIFACTS

217

related bays are of normal salinity; and the Laguna Madre along
the south coast is hypersaline. It is emphasized that this
generalization does not preclude the existence of localized
areas having normal salinity in bays that tend to be brackish
or hypersaline.
Though it is true that B. aontrarium is found living in
the ~ ocean all along the Texas coast, that shells of the
species do occasionally wash up on the shore, and that it is
found anywhere in the bay systems where the water maintains
a constant normal salinity, it is only in the bays north of
the Laguna Madre and south of Matagorda Bay, where normal
salinity is more the rule than the exception, that the species
would be expected to commonly occur. Given that these partic­
ular bays offer the kind of environment attractive to B.
aontrarium, it is not surprising that Carl Young (1976), a shell
collector from Corpus Christi, made the following report:
The lightning whelk is {or was} quite
abundant in Corpus Christi, Copano and
Lavaca bays. Perhaps unfortunately for your
research, it is a species which occurs in
both bays and the open Gulf, though it is
much easier collected in the bays than along
the open beaches. As late as the early 1960's
huge colonies could be observed in Corpus
Christi Bay. However, to the south of
Corpus Christi the species seems to be much
less prevalent, occurring primarily in the
Gulf.
Conversely, Dr. H.W. Harry (1976) of Texas A&M states that
"In Galveston Bay it would be very unusual to find live Busycon."
A comparison of the modern distribution of B. aontrarium
to the locations of Archaic sites containing artifacts
manufactured out of whelk shell indicates that the sites occur
most frequently adjacent to waters where the species is today
most abundant and most easily accessible.
The preponderance of shell artifacts occurring at sites
along the south central coast initially suggests that the area
might have been the primary source of many of the shell artifacts
showing up at Archaic sites throughout the region. However,
the fact that most of the Archaic-age marine shell artifacts
now known from sites near the shell source are utilitarian in
nature provides strong evidence to the contrary. Ornamental
marine shellwork of the type found at Allens Creek, and else­
where in central and eastern Texas, finds little or no expression
in Nueces, San Patricio, and Calhoun counties (Mokry, 1976).
This evidence suggests that the ornamental shell artifacts found
in Archaic context in central and eastern Texas probably orig­
inated, or at least were manufactured, somewhere other than the
Texas Gulf coast.

Recorded Occurrence of Probable
Archaic- age Marine Shell Artifacts
In an 80 County Region of Texas

Information obtained from TARL County Site Files

SLR176

220

ALLENS CREEK

The coastal sites, Kent-Crane in particular, are neverthe­
less important in that they demonstrate: 1) the availability
of large specimens of B. aontrarium along the Texas coast during
Archaic times, 2) that the shells were being collected and
utilized by Archaic people, and 3) that these people had shell
artifacts of the type found at Al1ens Creek. The two or three
possible ornamental shell artifacts found at the Kent-Crane
site may indicate that there were attempts made at replicating
the imported shell ornaments out of locally available materials,
as was done with boatstones.
Assuming that the All~ns Creek marine shell ornaments
did not originate along the Texas coast, the problem of their
source becomes a conjectural matter. As previously stated,
the lightning whelk is also common along the eastern seaboard
from South Carolina to Florida and on the Gulf coasts of
Florida and Alabama. The Allens Creek artifacts could theo­
retically have originated from any of the regions along these
stretches of coast.
Elsewhere in the eastern United States, the occurrence
of marine shell artifacts, far removed from coastal localities,
in Archaic, Woodland, and Mississippian contexts, has been
amply documented. As 1n the present study, the origin of the
marine shells used in making these artifacts has not been
satisfactorily determined.
Strongly evidenced in the states of Ohio, Indiana, and
Michigan, and to a lesser extent in Wisconsin, Illinois, northern
Alabama, and Ontario, the Glacial Kame Culture is best known
for cemetery sites yielding burials with red ocher associated
with large whelk shell ornaments known as "sandal-sole gorgets"
(Cunningham 1948). Differing only slightly in general form and
placement of perforations, the sandal-sole gorgets bear a strong
resemblance to the Form 1 specimens recovered at 41 AU 36. Dr.
James B. Griffin (1975) places the Glacial Kame Culture in the
Late Archaic Period of 1500 to 1000 B.C. Regarding the origin
of the shells, Dr. Griffin believes the Gulf coast of Florida
to be a likely possibility; he bases his opinion on the pre­
valence of the lightning whelk along the Florida coast,
especially south of Tampa, and on the trade networks that fed
raw materials, including marine shell, from Florida, Alabama,
and Mississippi into the northern centers of Hopewell culture.
His belief is that the later Hopewell trade routes followed
networks that began developing during the Archaic. If this
interpretation is correct, the material for the sandal-sole
gorgets, if not the gorgets themselves, very probably did come
from Florida or Alabama.
Winters (1968) discusses the occurrence of marine shell
artifacts at sites of the Late Archaic Indian Knoll Culture in
the eastern United States. In considering the source of the
marine shell showing up in the Indian Knoll Culture sites,
he states:

ARTIFACTS

221

It is not possible to pinpoint the locus
from which the shells derived, although if they
were being obtained from a single source, central
Florida would have to have been the area, Busycon
pepvepsum being obtainable within that limited
range. But even granting that each species was
obtained from its nearest possible source. none
of the species could have come from locations
closer than 600 miles by the most direct overland
route, and some would have had to have been
derived from sources as far away as 750 miles.
Actual transportation routes, whether by land or
water, or both, must have been much longer.
(Winters 1968: 215-216)
Winters dates the Indian Knoll Culture at 2500 to 2000 B.C.
Of interest in the present study, he notes,
. . . with the exception of atlatl weights
there was no diversion of imported marine
shell for the manufacture of utilitarian
artifacts, quite unlike sites of the Florida
area adjacent to the sources of much of the
marine shell (Winters 1968: 182-3).
It will be recalled that the single utilitarian shell artifact
out of the many found at 41 AU 36 was an atlatl weight. On the
other hand, at the Kent-Crane site, the shell artifact inventory
was overwhelmingly weighted toward utilitarian objects.
In concluding his article, Winters (1968: 21~) emphasizes
. . . that there is good evidence that the
vast trade network that links the various
regional traditions of the Hopewellian
Interaction Sphere . . . has its roots in
the simpler exchange systems of late
Archaic cultures such as Indian Knoll . .
In the recently published comprehensive study of engraved
marine shell artifacts from Spiro, Phillips and Brown (1978)
have carefully considered the origin of the shells from which
the artifacts were manufactured. Though the marine shell
objects from Spiro date considerably younger than the deposits
yielding most of the marine shells at Allens Creek, it is never­
theless informative to study the conclusions reached concerning
their origin. It is first stated that the ", •• marine shell
comes in part from the eastern Florida waters (and possibly
northeast Mexican shores)" (Phillips and Brown 1978: 19).
Later, when speaking of Mt. Royal, a site on the St. Johns River
in northeastern Florida, it is said:

222

ALLENS CREEK

Of far greater interest from our point of view
is that conditions at "to Royal suggest that the
site may have been a center of dispersal in the
marine shell trade.
The consensus of optnfon seems to be that the marine shell
found in midwestern and eastern prehistoric sites originated
in Florida and that it was a valuable. widely-traded material.
As it does not appear that the Archaic-age marine shell orna­
ments found in central Texas originated along th~ Texas coast,
the possibility that the people represented by the remains at
A1lens Creek shared in the same interaction system as supplied
marine shell and other materials to the Archaic groups of the
midwest and eastern U,S, should be taken into serious consid­
eration. The unquestionable origin in Arkansas of boatstone
and gorget materials found at A11ens Creek evidence the existence
of an interaction network that could also have brought marine
shell into Texas from the southeast.
That the marine shell ornaments found in Burial Group 2
at 41 AU 36 were apparently not manufactured in Texas does not
rule out entirely the possibility that unmodified whelk shells
from the south central Texas coast were being fed into the
import-export system for transport to inland manufacturing
centers. No such centers are presently known. rt may be
difficult to recognize a manufacturing site archeo10g1cally
because many, if not all, of the. shell pieces were made into one
form of artifact or another. Given the probable value of the
shell, there would be little or no telltale waste material left
laying around to provide evidence of a factory.
Bone Artifacts
BONE ARTIFACTS - 41 AU 36
A total of 676 bone artifacts were recovered from 41 AU 36;
oft his tot a 1, n i net y - f I v e we r e c om p1 e tea rtf fa c t san d 581 we r e
fragments. Most of these bone artifacts were either directly
associated with, or collected from, the fill around individuals
in Burial Group 2 of Zone 3B . . The distinctive Form 1 and form
9 artifacts were directly associated with four individuals
in Burial Group 1. Zone 3A. A very small number of the.se arti­
facts came from Zones 4 and 5.

Bones of five vertebrate genera are recognized in the
collection. A majority of the specimens are manUfactured out
of bones of the white-tailed deer, Odoaoileu8 vipginianus. An
ulna. metapodials, antler, and many metatarsals are represented.
The wild turkey, MeLeagpi8 gallopavo~ and bobcat, Lyn~pufu8, .
are represented by tibiotarsus and ulna Dones, respectively.

Form - This group of artifacts is manufactured out of
long, rounded bone splinters perhaps best described as being
pencil-shaped. They have tapered, rounded distal ends and
tapered, flattened proximal ends. One specimen is bi-pointed.
Remarks - All specimens were directly associated with
individuals in Burial Group l, Zone 3A. Specimen 5, which is
bi-pointed, has traces of a black substance. possibly asphaltum,
visible down half its length along one side. Though species of
the vertebrate represented by the artifacts cannot be definitely
identified, the length and thickness of the specimens suggest
a bison-sized animal. Specimens associated with Burial 45 lay
lengthwise along the left arm. Those with Burial 155 were
scattered throughout the chest area and on both sides of the
pelvis. The specimen with Burial 169 was found near the skull.

ARTIFACTS

227

Form - Form 2 artifacts are manufactured out of deer
metatarsals split longitudinally down the natural vascular
groove of the bone. One complete metatarsal could thus produce
two artifacts of this type. Tfie edges formed as a result of
splitting the metatarsal are rounded and smoothed by abrasion.
In cross section, all specimens are concave-convex. Some become
plano-convex near the distal end. The distal ends are shaped
to a flat, rounded point; fifteen of the tips are slightly
upturned. At the proximal end, the articular surface of the
metatarsal is preserved on six specimens and abraded completely
away on the remainder. Striations resulting from shaping
and smoothing are evident over all surfaces of the better.
preserved specimens.
Remarks - All of these specimens were either directly
associated with individuals in Burial Group 2 or were recovered
from the fill around these burials in Zone 38. There is no
sheen or other obvious evidence of usage on any of the specimens.
Specimen 2 has nicks spaced 2 mm. apart running down both edges.
Specimens 13 and 17, and two of the distal fragments, have
incised geometric line patterns on their exterior faces.
Specimens 15, 16, and 17, all associated with Burial 217, have
proximal ends with a distinctive concave shape. Locations of
burial-associated specimens relative to skeletons were: B-14,
along right arm, in chest area, on top and left side of pelvis;
B-69, along lower leg; B-89, chest area; B-93, skull area
(bundle burial, long axis of bone artifacts parallel to bones

knee area; B-170, on top of right radius and ulna; 8-188, chest
area; B-217, neck area to right of the skull. Specimens
virtually identical to these have been reported from the Albert
George Site in Austin County (Walley 1955), at the Fall Creek
Sites in Llano County (Jackson and Woolsey 1938), at various

at least 7 Form 3 artifacts, some
decorated, removed in matrix block,
too deteriorated for measurement.

Form - Similar in general configuration to Form 2, Form 3
specimens are also manufactured out of longitudinally split
deer metatarsals. The edges formed as a result of splitting the
metatarsal are rounded and smoothed 5y abrasion. The articular
surface is preserved at the proximal end of ten of the specimens

230

ALLENS CREEK

and is obliterated by abrasion on the remainder. The proximal
end is perforated in the center just below the articular surface.
The distal ends are shaped to a flat, relatively sharp point.
This point and the single perforation at the proximal end are
the two features that distinguish Form 3 from Form 2.
Striations resulting from shaping and smoothing are evident over
all surfaces of the better-preserved specimens.
Remarks - Most of these specimens were directly associated
with individuals in Burial Group 2 of Zone 38. Specimens 4-8
have incised geometric line patterns on their exterior surfaces.
Locations of burial-associated specimens relative to skeletons
were: 8-100, left side of pelvis under radius and ulna; B-111,
upper chest area; B-124, alongside left lower arm; 8~135, 1;
B-188, chest area; B-104, on left side above pelvis under ribs,
Very similar specimens are reported from the Albert George Site
in Austin County (Walley 1955).

Form - These artifacts are manufactured out of round,
hollow bird bones. Specimen 3 retains an articular surface at
the proximal end and is identified as being the tibiotarsus of
a turkey. Specimens 1 and 2 are very similar to No.3 and,
though exact identification is impossible, are thought to be
turkey also. A sharp point is formed at the distal end of
Specimens 2 and 3. Specimen 1 lacks a distal end and Specimen
2 lacks the proximal end.
Remarks - These three specimens were directly associated
with skeletons in Burial Group 2, Zone 3B. Specimen 1 has
incised lines near the break at the proximal end. The positions
of artifacts relative to skeletons were: 8-100, alongside left
radius and ulna; B-135, ?; B-188, chest area.

Form - This bi-pointed bone artifact is probably manufac­
tured out of a split deer metatarsal though extensive modifica­
tion prohibits a definite identification. This specimen is
similar in shape to the Form 3 objects except that both ends
are worked to a flat, relatively sharp point.
Remarks - The exterior surface of this artifact has ten
bands of intricately incised lines placed perpendicular to the
long axis of the piece (see Fig. 51). It was directly
associated with Group 2 Burial 217 and was located in the neck
area to the right of the skull.

Form - The Form 6 bone artifacts are manufactured out of
thin, slender bone splinters. The splinters retained no
features which would positively identify the species of animal
represented. However, the fragility and shape of some,
especially Specimens 1 through 5, suggest that the leg bones
of small birds were used. Specimens 6 and 7, which are bigger,
thicker, and heavier, may be deer metatarsals. The splinters
are perforated at the proximal end and have a sharp, narrow
point at the distal end. Striations resulting from abrasive
shaping and smoothing are visible on the better-preserved
specimens.
Remarks - Most of the Form 6 pieces were directly associated
with individuals in Burial Group 2, Zone 3B. Specimens 1-5 are
the best representatives of the group; specimens 6 and 7 are
longer, thicker, and heavier than the majority. Form 6 artifacts
are smaller, thinner, and have a wider variation in shape than
the Form 3 representatives. Locations of burial-associated
specimens relative to skeletons were; B-89, chest area; B-92a,
alongside right humerus; B-111, upper chest; B-172, on right
radius and ulna; B-206, near feet.

Form - Specimens in this group are manufactured out of
long. slender Done splinters. probably taken from deer
matatarsals. Specimens 1 and 2 are bi-pointed while Specimens
3 through 5 are blunt at one end, retaining some vestiges of
the articular surface of the original bone. Form 7 Specimens
are more round than flat and have strong. round. sharp points.
Remarks - Specimen 4 may have had a perforation at the
proximal (blunt) end. Specimen 5 has the sharpest point of any
of the bone artifacts recovered at 41 AU 36. Positions of
artifacts relative to skeletons were: B-89. chest area; B-100,
in a pile alongside right humerus; B-ll1, upper chest; B-117.
near left arm.
Form 8 - 4 Specimens
This group of at least four pointed ulna artifacts (Fig. 51)
was found associated with Group 2 Burial 172. All of the
objects were found in a stack alongside the left shoulder of
the skeleton. The ulna used in the manufacture of the Form 8

ALLENS CREEK

specimens are from the bobcat, Lynx rUfU8j at least two
individuals, probably adult males, are represented by the
artifacts. Only approximate measurements are possible as the
specimens were too deteriorated for reconstruction and had to
be stabilized in a matrix block: Length, 16.5 cm.; width, 1.7 cm.;
thickness, O.B cm.

Form - The single Form 9 specimen is formed out of a long,
narrow bone, probably from a large bird. The artifact was
formed by cutting halfway through the bone at a point some 4.5
cm. from the proximal end. The bone was then split from this
cut down to the distal end. The edges of the split were then
rounded and smoothed and a point made at the distal end.
Remarks - This specimen was associated with Group 1 Burial
150. The position of the artifact relative to the skeleton
is unknown.

metapodial bones. SpeCimens 1 and 2 are portions of longitud­
inally-split bones while Specimens 3 and 4 are split from a
point 2 to 3 cm. from the proximal end down to the distal end.
All have relatively sharp points.
Remarks - These specimens were not associated with burials.

An additional 470 bone artifact fragments are given in the table
below. Most are believed to be pieces of the 11 groups of
Pointed Bone artifacts, principally Forms 2 and 3. Thus,
separate totals for medial, proximal, and distal portions are
given. Proximal and distal fragment totals for the table came
to 40. This is thought to be the approximate number of complete
specimens that would be represented had they survived intact.

ARTIFACTS

Rectangular and Triangular Bone Pieces
This artifact group consists of twelve specimens divided
into four form categories on the oasis of overall shape. All
specimens are believed to be manufactured out of split and shaped
deer metatarsals though modifications are so extensive that a
positive species identification is impossible. All were found
among the Group 2 burials in Zone 3B.

Form - Form 1 specimens are short, rectangular, and flat
to slightly convex pieces of bone. The ends are straight to
slightly rounded. From the midline down to one end on the
exterior surfaces of Specimens 1, 2, 3, and 5, the bone has
been worked down slightly to give the end a blunt, upturned
appearance. On Specimen 4, a chisel-like end was rendered.
Remarks - On four of the specimens, the upturned half of
the artifact seems to have some sheen. Specimen 3 has traces
of a black substance, possibly asphaltum, adhering to both faces
of the flat half. The flat end of Specimen 4 bisects a perfora­
tion leaving a semicircular indentation at the end. SpeCimen 5
has an incised geometric pattern over the upturned half; this
design is partially obliterated as if the incising took place
prior to the shaping which formed the upturn. The bisected
perforation on Specimen 4 and the faint incising on Specimen 5
possibly indicate that sections out of such artifacts, as are
seen in Types 2 and 3 of the Pointed Bone category above, were
used to produce these objects. Specimen 3 was found off the
left ribs of Burial 99. Exact proveniences for the remaining
specimens are unknown.

Form - Form 4 specimans are subtriangu1ar, flat bone pieces
having rounded ends and corners.
Remarks - Specimen 1 shows traces of a black substance,
possibly asphaltum, over both faces. This specimen also has some
incised lines on the exterior surface (Fig. 50). Specimen 3
was found by the pelvis on the right hand side of Burial 217.
Tubular Bone Beads (Lot 421)
A total of ten tubular bone beads, eight associated with
Group 2 Burial 208 and two from Zone 3B of N95 W100, were
recovered. The specimens associated with Burial 208 apparently
formed a bracel et on the 1eft 'wri st. Lengths range from 1.4
to 2.9 cm. and diameters from 0.4 to 0.6 cm. The beads are
illustrated in Figure 51.

Tubular Slotted Bone (Lot 253)
A tubular, slotted bone artifact (Fig. 51) with a length
of 4.7 cm. and an outside diameter of 2.0 cm. was recovered
from Zone 3A of N100 W96. The inside diameter of the tube is
1.3 cm. A slot with a length of 2.4 cm. and a width of 0.2 cm.
is cut longitudinally into one face of the artifact. The slot
terminates at approximately 1.2 cm. from each end of the tube.

ANTLER - 41 AU 36
Modified Antler
A fragment of burned, modified deer antler was recovered
from Zone 3B of N102 W86. The length of the specimen is 5.3
cm. and the diameter is 1.5 cm. Striations running the length
of the antler are visible on the smooth surfaces. The ends
are blunted, though perhaps not intentionally.
Unmodified Antler as a Grave Inclusion
Fragments' of unmodified deer antler, as well as numerous
petrosa1s, auditory (meatus) bullae and some skull fragments,
were found amidst the remains of Group 2 burials 38, 89, 96,
97, 98, 99, 100, and 111. Although no complete articulated
specimens were discovered, the impression received from zone 3B
is that deer skulls, either complete or fragmented, were placed
along with the burials.

STINGRAY SPINES (LOT 64)
Two unmodified barbed dorsal spines (Fig. 51) from the
stingray, Da8yati8~ were associated with Group 2, Burial 22.
The barbs were located approximately 10 cm. off the right
shoulder of the skeleton. One specimen is complete with a
total length of 6.7 cm. and a maximum width of 0~7 cm. The
other specimen consists of a medial fragment only.

FOSSILIZED, CHALKY BONE (LOT 379)
Twenty round, pea-sized grains of fossilized bone, having
a very soft, chalky consistency, were found in association with
Group 2 Burial 134. The grayish-white substance composing the
material rubs off very easily and streaks white. Recovered
from the chest area of the skeleton, the material seems to have
been placed on the body in much the same way as were ocher
and biotite schist granules.

SHARK TEETH (LOTS 43 and 44)
Two shark teeth were recovered from Zone 4' in Unit N102
W90 at 41 AU 36. Both are about 1 cm. in length. Neither
specimen shows evidence of use as a tool or ornament. The
presence of the teeth at the site is probably the result Of
human transport from the Gulf Coast, although the possibility
.that a shark made its way up the Brazos River as far as Allens
Creek cannot be discounted entirely.
BONE ARTIFACTS - 41 AU 37

Eight modified bone artifacts were recovered. The specimen
identification number, horizon provenience, vertical provenience,
length, width, and thickness, in centimeters, as well as a
brief description of each artifact, is presented below.

Specimen 1 - This specimen consists of three fragments of
flat, porous bone. The largest fragment has a length of 1.4
cm. One flat surface of each fragment is thinly coated with a
black substance which might be asphaltum.
Specimen 2 - This is the distal section of a slender
artifact, the tip of which is worked to a relatively sharp,
rounded point. Short striations angling from perpendicular to
45 degrees off of the long axis are probably rodent gnawings."
Specimen 3 - This specimen is the tip of a deer antler which
was apparently snapped off by incising a groove around the
circumference of the antler. The incision did not cut all the
way through but only far enough to allow breakage. The tip of
the antler shows no sheen or striations which would indicate
usage.

242

ALLENS CREEK

Specimen 4 - In the same category as Pointed Bone Form
10 from 41 AU 36, this artifact is manufactured out of a deer
metapodial. The object was sharpened by diagonally splitting
the metapodial from a point 5.3 cm. below the proximal (articular)
end for a length of 5 cm. down to the distal tip. The tip
was additionally shaped by abrasion and smoothing. Patches of
sheen are visible over the whole artifact but cover more
surface and are shinier within 4 cm. of the tip. A natural
vascular groove runs the length of the specimen down the side
opposite the diagonal split. This object lay outside, and
garallel to, the left humerus in Burial 2. Aten and others
(1976) refer to similar artifacts as "socketed bone pOints."
Specimens 5 and 6 - These two artifacts were manufactured
out of longitudinally-split deer metatarsals and are identical
to specimens in Pointed Bone Form 3 from 41 AU 36. Plano­
convex in cross-section, the specimens are perforated at the
proximal end and brought to a flat point at the distal end.
Both are decorated on the convex face with incised geometric
designs. The fragments comprising these specimens were recovered
from the abdominal area of Burial 2.
Specimen 7 - This artifact consists of a rectangular piece
of beaver tooth (Castor canadensis). In longitudinal profile,
the piece is plano-convex. The ends are lightly rounded. The
convex face retains a reddish-orange color l2.5YR5/8}.
Striations running both parallel and perpendicular to the
longitudinal axis are visible atone end on the convex surface
and over the entire concave face. Aboriginal modification is
inferred as ft does not seem possible that the living animal
could have produced such wear patterns on the tooth.
Specimen 8 - This rounded, bf-pointed bone splinter is
tapered to a slender, sharp tip at one end and a short, blunt
tip at the other end. Striations possibly resulting from
abrasive shaping or usage run perpendicular to the long axis
within 2.7 cm. of the blunt end. The sharp end evidences some
sheen.
BONE ARTIFACTS - 41 AU 38
Five pieces of modified bone were recovered. Three of these
are short. pointed objects. One is a flat, triangular fragment.
half of which is coated with a black substance. The fifth
artifact is a spiral-fractured bone fragment, one edge of which
has been smoothed.

Specimen 1 - Manufactured out of a long bone fragment of
an unidentified species, this artifact tapers from a maximum
width of 1.3 cm. at the proximal end to a sharp, round point
at the distal end. There are no use striations visible.
Specimen 2 - A spiral-fractured fragment from the long
bone of a deer-sized animal. The edge of one spiral fracture
has been smoothed from the sharp end of the fracture back up to
the mid section of the fragment. No use striations are visible.
Specimen 3 - A flat, triangular bone fragment, one face of
which is coated with a shiny black substance, possibly asphaltum.
Specimen 4 - A flat, triangular bone piece with a width
of 1.1 cm. at the proximal end which tapers down to a sharp
point. The surfaces and edges are very smooth. Striations
are clearly visible running the length of the object on one
surface and the length and width on the other surface.
Specimen 5 - Manufactured out of a catfish spine, this
artifact tapers from a width of 0.8 cm. at the proximal end
down to a sharp point at the distal end, Striations visible
on the object suggest that it was used in a rotary fashion.
A glossy finish over most of the surface may also be the result
of use.
BURIAL CONTEXT OF BONE ARTIFACTS
The most outstanding contextual relationship of bone
artifacts to burials was the occurrence of pointed bone specimens
in bundle-like stacks on, or beside, the skeletons at 41 AU 36.
Over forty complete specimens and numerous fragments representing
Pointed Bone Forms 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 were found in stacks beside
Group 1 Burial 45 and Group 2 Burials 92a. 100, 104, 124, 170,
172. and 188 (Figs. 14, 15c, and 16c), The stacks were position­
ed outside the right arm (j2a, 100, and 170), outside the left
arm (124), off the left shoulder (172), on the left side
beneath the ribs (104}, and on the upper chest (188). Pointed

244 .

ALLENS CREEK

bone forms also occurred in the chest areas of Burials 14 and
89 (Fig. 19) and near the necks of Burials 111 and 217 (Fig. 20).
Most of the remaining specimens were generally scattered
about the torso areas of the burials. Through processes of
decomposition~ breakage from overburden pressure, and dis­
turbance by insects and rodents, original context was in many
cases destroyed. All bone artifacts found around the legs of
burials were probably not in their original position, but were
post-depositionally transported by various agencies of distur­
ba nc e.
All bone artifacts recovered from Burial Group 2 were
associated with adult individuals. There were no bone artifacts
with individuals 20 years of age and younger. Among the adults
with bone artifacts, there seemed to be no meaningful clustering
according to age or sex.
Ceramic Artifacts
Ceramic vessel fragments from seven sites at A11ens Creek
were analyzed collectively and divided into the following
fourteen groups: one group of bone/grog-tempered sherds; one
group of grog-tempered sherds; three groups of bone-tempered
sherds; and nine groups of sandy paste sherds. Included in the
analysis were 715 sherds from sites 41 AU 8, 41 AU 14, 41 AU 21,
41 AU 31, 41 AU 36, 41 AU 37, and 41 AU 38; an additional 372
grog-tempered and sandy paste sherds from 41 AU 38 were excluded
from the study as their small size precluded recognition of
all characteristics necessary for assignment of a specific
group. Bone temper being such a distinctive agent, it was
possible to recognize even the smallest representatives of the
bone-tempered and bone/grog-tempered groups found at 41 AU 38.
The groups of bone-tempered and bone/grog-tempered sherds
described be10~ were readily distinguishable from one another.
their color and the size of bone fragments in the paste being
a bv i a u sly d iff ere nt . For the san d y pas t e she r d.s, all of whi c h
probably represent the Goose Creek type, paste characteristics
and non-plastic inclusions vary little from group to group.
Groupings are thus based primarily on visual distinctions in
finish and color of surfaces and cores. Using such criteria.
it is possible that some of the differences perceived by the
analyst may not denote distinct "kinds" of pottery but are
merely the result of slightly variable firing techniques or
post-manufacture usage. In lieu of the more rigorous forms of
analysis necessary to establish refined ceramic types. the
following groups are presented and described as accurately as
possible.

ARTIFACTS

245

BONE AND GROG-TEMPERED GROUP - 71 Specimens
Pas te
The clay paste contains some silt-sized sand (less than
74 microns) with a small percentage of very fine (74 micron)
quartz grains.
Non-Plastic Inclusions
The clay has a high content of blue-black to gray to white,
coarse, angular bone fragments up to 0.6 cm. in length and a
lesser amount of angular grog (fragments of fired clay) temper­
ing.
Color
Interior and exterior surface colors vary within the same
range from shades of reddish yellow (5YR6/6, 7.5YR6/6) to very
pale brown (10YR7/4). Core colors range from dark gray (10
YR4/l) to brown (lOYR5/3).
Surface Finish
Surfaces are smoothed or floated. Bone fragments and grog
are visible on the surfaces but do not protrude from, or roughen,
the finish.
Wall Thickness
A large majority of these sherds have a thickness of from
0.5 to 0.6 cm. Small percentages are in the 0.4 to 0.45 cm. and
0.6 to 0.65 cm. ranges.
Vessel Shape
Lips on rim sherds are squ~red. No further observations
were possible due to the small size of the sherds.
Decoration
On two sherds, three and five parallel lines spaced
approximately 0.3 cm. apart are incised on the exterior surface
(.Fig. 52) running parallel to the rim.
Comments
Thickness, decoration, and surface color make this group
similar to Sandy Paste Group 6, below. The presence of bone and
grog in this group is the chief difference.

ALLENS CREEK

BONE-TEMPERED GROUP 1 - 37 Specimens - 41 AU 38
Paste
The clay paste is moderately sandy. Sand grains are
mainly silt-size (less than 74 microns) with some very fine
(74 microns) quartz grains.
Non-Plastic Inclusions
A light to moderate amount of ftnely crushed blue-black
to gray to white bone is present as an inclusion. This bone
temper differs from the Bone/Grog Tempered Group in that the
bone particles are smaller and constitute a lesser percentage
of the whole sherd.
Color
Exterior surface colors range from light brown (7.5YR6/4)
to light brownish gray (10YR6/2) to very dark gray (lOYR3/l).
Interior surfaces are uniformly dark gray (lOYR4/l) to very dark
gray (10YR3/l).
Surface Finish
Surfaces are generally smooth but have a gritty feel impart­
ed by the sand in. the paste.
Wall Thickness
About half of this group of sherds falls between a,s and 0,6
cm. in thickness. The remaining sherds are split equally
between the 0.4 to 0.45 cm. and 0.65 to 0.7 cm. ranges.
Vessel Shape
Shape could not be determined due to the small size of the
sherds.
Decoration
On two rim sherds, two inctsed lines spaced 0,6 cm. apart
parallel the rim. The first line is 0,9 cm. down from the lip
on one specimen and 0,5 cm. down on the other (J'ig. 52}.

Color
Both interior and exterior .surfaces range from gray (5YR
5/1) to very dark gray (7.5YR3/0). Cores are very dark gray
to black (lOYR2/1). The dark surface colors of these sherds
are the major distinguishing characteristics. All other bone
tempered groups are lighter in color.
Surface Finish
Surfaces are very smooth on most, to burnished on two,
specimens. Only rarely are bone particles visible on the sur­
faces.
Wall Thickness
The range in thickness is from 0.5 cm. to 1,0 cm. with more
than half from 0.5 to 0.6 cm.
Vessel Shape
Shape was undetermined due to the small number and size
of sherds.

GROG-TEMPERED GROUP - 186 Specimens
Paste
T~e c1a¥ paste has a high content of fine sand grains
(149 mIcrons).

Non-Plastic Inclusions
A low percentage of angular grog fragments of a color almost
indistinguishable from the core colors were present as inclusions.
Color
Exterior surfaces have a gray, ashy appearance which is
the major distinguishing characteristic of the group. Colors
on the exterior range from very dark gray (10YR3/1} to light
~ray (10YR7/l).
The majority of interior surfaces are black
tlOYR2/l) though some specimens are in the same range of grays
as the exteriors. Cores are gray and black with the gray
comprising about one third the thickness from the exterior
surface down into the core.

ALLENS CREEK

Surface Finish
Surfaces are smooth but slightly gritty. On some specimens,
almost imperceptible parallel ridges, more easily felt than seen,
would indicate that coiling was the method used in making the
vessels represented by these sherds. A small percentage of
these sherds exhibit rough striations, possibly a result of
smoothing.
Wall Thickness
Roughly half of the sherds in this group have a thickness
of between 0.7 and 0.75 cm, The remainder fall between the 0,5
to 0.65 cm. and 0.8 to 0.95 cm. ranges, with twice as many
specimens in the former range as the latter.
Vessel Shape
Rim lips are rounded with the exterior wall essentially
perpendicular to the lip; interior surfaces begin angling in
to meet the 1ip at about 1.0 cm, below the rim.
Decoration
One large rim sherd exhibits nicks spaced 0.4 cm. apart
along the rim.

Surface Finisn
Surfaces are very smooth, floated, and may possibly have
a slip over the exterior. Finish is similar to Sandy Paste
Groups 1 and 7.
Wall Thickness
Thickness ranges from 0.6 to 0.8 cm. with only four sherds
being greater than 0.6 cm.
Vessel Shape
Two rim sherds are included in the group. On one, the lip
is squared with the exterior wall perpendicular to the rim while
the interior wall angles in to meet the lip. On the second,
both walls angle in slightly to meet a rounded lip. General
configuration of tne vesse1(s) could not be determined due to
the small size of the sherds.
Decorations
No specimens were decorated.
Comments
Most of the Group 3 snerds were recovered from the Zone
3A fill immediately above Burial 7 at 41 AU 37. The small
area from which the sherds were recovered led to speculation
that the sherds represent a single vessel. Attempts at recon­
struction met with very limited success. A direct relationship
between the sherds and the underlying burial was thought
possible but could not be demonstrated.

DISCUSSION
The earliest typological ordering of aboriginal ceramics
for the region east of the Allens Creek study area was formally
suggested by Suhm~ Krieger~ and Jelks in 1954. Based primarily
on collections from sites surrounding Galveston Bay, the name
Goose Creek was given to sherds having sandy paste as a common
trait. Color, thickness, finish, and size of sand grains in
the paste were highly variable within the group. The subtypes
Goose Creek Plain and Goose Creek Incised were recognized
primarily by the presence or absence of distinctive incised
geometric decorations.
As a result of investigations at sites on Cedar Bayou in
the Galveston Bay area (Ambler 1967} and at the Jamison Site
(Aten 1967), three additional sherd types - Goose Creek Red­
Filmed, San Jacinto Plain, and San Jacinto Incised - were
suggested for consideration (Aten 1967: 9). Goose Creek Red­
Filmed, a third sub-type of Goose Creek, was described as having
II fin ely
pow dere d red min era 1 p i 9men t II (A ten 1 9.67: 1 1 lap p1 i e d
to interior and exterior surfaces of both plain and incised
vessels. The San Jacinto types contained fired clay fragments
(grog) as a seemingly intentional aplastic inclusion.
Also recognized in the are~ but as yet not clearly c1as­
sified~ are groups of bone-tempered sherds varying considerably
in general appearance and content. Bone-tempered sherds are
reported from Presidio San Agustin de Ahumada (Tunnell and
Ambler 1967), Cedar Bayou (Ambler 1967}, the Jamison Site
(A ten 1967 ), the Dow - C1 e a v e r Sit e LA ten 1 971 }, and a t sit e s
in the Wallisville Reservoir area (AmBler 1970, Gilmore 1974,
Oil1ehay 1975l.
The type designation routinely applied to bone-tempered
sherds, having light but widespread distribution over central,
southern and coastal regions, is Leon Plain (Suhm, Krieger,
and Jelks 19541. Ambler (1970) has tentatively suggested
Orcoquisac Plain as a type name for the bone-tempered sherds
found in the Wallisville Reservoir area.

262

ALLENS CREEK

Aten (1971: 30) is of the oplnlon that no new typological
constructs should be suggested for bone-tempered ceramics,
"Until some thorough review of the Leon Plain specimens can be
undertaken." He also notes that
. . . the extremely late appearance of these
ceramics at the mouth of the Brazos and the
much greater abundance farther inland as well
as their principal distribution in the region
of the Brazos and Colorado rivers may indicate
an association of the bone-tempered ceramics
with the Tonkawa and their general southward
movement . • • " (Aten 1971; 30).
The best published discussion of the chronological signif­
icance of the above-mentioned sherd groups is provided by Aten
and Bollich {1969}. Though their treatise deals specifically
with the Sabine Lake and Galveston Bay areas, the conclusiDns
reached undoubtedly have more far-reaching implications. In
general, this ceramic chronology demonstrates the predominance of
sandy paste plain ware over grog-tempered plain ware during early
stages, giving way to exactly the reverse situation during
later stages. Bone-tempered ware appears only in the historic
stage of the sequence.
Aten and Bollich note significant differences in the
chronologies derived from ceramics in the Sabine Lake and
Galveston Bay areas. In the Sabine Lake area, both sandy paste
and grog-tempered sherds occur in pre-arrow point contexts.
Around Galveston Bay, sandy paste sherds are evidenced prior
to introduction of the arrow pOint, but grog-tempered sherds
do not appear until shortly after the appearance of the arrow
point.
In the Allens Creek sherd assemblage, only the Sandy Paste
Group 1 sherds. found in Zone 4~ at 41 AU 36, are from a pre­
arrow point context. The zone yielding these sherds is tenta­
tively dated between A.D. 550 and A.D. 950. Though in some
ways different from later ~herd groups termed Goose Creek.
Sandy Paste Group 1 has characteristics well within the
descriptive limits of the type,
All additional sherds were recovered from zones yielding
Saallorn and Perdiz arrow points. The collections from sites
41 AU 31, 41 AU 37. and 41 AU 38 are considered to be of partic­
ular significance. Zones 1 and 3 at 41 AU 37 yielded sandy
paste (Goose Creek) and grog-tempered (San Jaainto} sherds.
In Zone 3, with a median radiocarbon date of A.D. 920, there
were twenty-five sandy paste sherds and three grog-tempered
sherds. Zone 1, yielding a median radiocarbon date of A.D.
1480, contained twenty-eight sandy paste sherds and twenty-four
grog-tempered sherds. There were no bone-tempered sherds re­
covered. Time diagnostic projectile points included one
Saallorn from Zone 3, and two Saallorn and one Perdiz from Zone 1,

ARTIFACTS

263

At 41 AU 31, eighteen bone-tempered, one grog-tempered,
and twenty-seven sandy paste sherds were recovered along with
two Perdiz points. The collection from 41 AU 38 includes
sixty-six bone/grog tempered, thirty-seven bone-tempered, 126
grog-tempered, and 280 sandy paste sherds; also recovered were
eleven SaaLLorn and five Perdiz points. Carbon from a hearth
yielded a radiocarbon date of A.D. 1480. What is apparently
indicated by the stratigraphic context of the sherd groups
is that sandy paste ware (Goose Creek) was in use during the
early Late Prehistoric as represented by the remains in Zone
3 at 41 AU 37 while grog-, bone/grog-, and bone-tempered
wares came into use later (around A.D. 1500) but by no means
supplanted Goose Creek.
The remains from 41 AU 31 hint at a correlation between
Perdiz points and bone/grog- and bone-tempered sherds.
Again at 41 AU 38 Perdiz points, bone/grog tempered sherds,
and bone-tempered sherds occur together but are not strati­
graphically distinct from the SaaLLorn points, Goose Creek
ware, and San Jaainto ware a.1so found at the site. A
conclusive demonstration of any temporal separation between
SaaLLorn and Perdiz assemblages is again frustrated. Though
Perdiz points were found with bone- and bone/grog-tempered
sherds at 41 AU 31, the sample came from only two test pits at
the site making it entirely possible that a sample bias
exists. The otherwise pure relationship between SaaLLorn
points, San Jaainto sherds, and Goose Creek sherds in Zone
1 at 41 AU 37 is marred by the occurrence of the single
Perdiz point. It is significant to note that no bone-tempered
sherds were recovered along with the Perdiz point at 41 AU 37.
The bone/grog-tempered sherds found at 41 AU 31 and 41
AU 38 have no known correlates in the region. Until further
research is done tn the area, it remains to be seen whether
the group is merely a localized variant or represents a cul­
turally significant combination of ceramic manufacturing
techniques.
Ordered chronologically, the A11ens Creek sherd assemblage
is in reasonable agreement with the chronology suggested for
Galveston Bay by Aten and Bollich (1969). Pre-arrow point
and early arrow point horizons at Allens Creek yielded only
sandy paste pottery termed Goose Creek. In later arrow point
horizons, grog-tempered San Jaainto snerds appeared in numbers
almost equalling Goose Creek. Also appearing late, and
possibly only with Perdiz points, were the bone/grog- and
bone-tempered sherd groups.

Fired Clay Object
A small, flat piece of fired clay (1.2 x 2.0 cm.) was
recovered at 41 AU 36. Over one face parallel striations
were spaced about 1 mm. apart. The pattern suggests that the
clay may have been pressed into wood or grass before it was
fired Clot 319).
Histori~

Artifacts

A square nail, a fragment of clear bottle glass. a sherd of
hand-painted polychrome ceramic; and a 12-gauge shotgun shell
seat were recovered at 41 AU 36 in excavation areas on the south
end of the site. Ernest Witte recalled that "an old shack"
had once stood in the general vicinity. These artifacts may
have been introduced to the site at the time the shack was
occupied.
Historic artifacts recovered at 41 AU 37 included a safety
pin, a lead-capped roofing nail, and a twisted piece of wire.
It is not known what events resulted in deposition of these items
at the site.
The single historic artifact recovered at site 41 AU 3B
was a .22 calibre rimfire shell casing.
Unanalyzed Materials
The following materials were collected during the archeo­
logical investigation at Allens Creek but were not subjected to
analysis due to limitations imposed by time and finances. All
materials are retained in the permanent collection at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory, Balcones Research Center,
Austin.
SOIL SAMPLES
5011 samples were collected at sites 41 AU 36, 41 AU 37,
and 41 AU 3B. Two sets of samples were collected at 41 AU 36,
one from the south wall of Unit N9S W90 and the other from the
east wall of Unit NI02 WBB. The thirty-four samples from the
N9S W90 column included all zones in the site while the samples
from the NI02 W88 column included only Zones 1 through 3 and the
lower portion of Zone 4. At 41 AU 37, two columns were taken;
one from the south wall of Unit NI02 191 (20 samples) and the
other from the east wall of Backhoe Trench 3 (16 samples).
At 41 AU 3B, soil samples were taken from Units NI00 WI0S,
N114 W116, N120 W148, N124 W124, and N136 W143.
LAND SNAILS
Land snail shells collected at 41 AU 36, 41 au 37, ~nd
41 AU 38 were not analyzed due to tne highly selective manner

265

in whtc~ shells were collected. Large, unbroken shells (mostly
BuZimuZus and PoZygiral were saved, but not in a consistent
fashion, throug~out the investigation. The snail assemblage
was t~us very biased and not at all representative of the whole
class of materials contained in each site.
FINE SCREEN CONCENTRATE
The matrix excavated from Units N88 W94, NI00 W86, N1Q2
W86, and N102 W96 at 41 AU 36 was water~screened through fly­
screen yielding a collection rich in snails, small vertebrate
remains, chert knapping deoitage, river pebbles, and other
debris. In unit N88 W94, only porttons of Zone 5 were sampled.
In the other three units, Zones 3A, 3B, and 4~ were completely
excavated and all matrix fine screened. The fine screen
materials were not analyzed due to the great amount of time
and effort required to separate the concentrate into discrete
classes for analytical purposes.
Discarded Materials
The following materials collected during the archeological
investigation at Allens Creek were discarded at the conclusion
of laboratory analysis.
POLLEN SAMPLES
All pollen sampl~s collected at sites 41 AU 36, 41 AU 37,
and 41 AU 38 were discarded.
Presence-or-absence testing of
selected samples from the three sites by palynologist Dr.
Vaughn Bryant, Anthropological Research Laboratories, Texas
A&M University, indicated that pollen content was too low to
warrant further analysis. Soil samples collected at the three
sites duplicate the pollen samples and will be retained in the
permanent collection.
LITHIC RESIDUES
General collections of calcium carbonate, burned clay, and
sandstone made at sites 41 AU 36, 41 AU 37, and 41 AU 38 were
discarded after each type of material was weighed. Materials
used in construction of hearth features and as artifacts are
retained in the permanent collection,
RIVER PEBBLES
All river pebbles collected at 41 AU 36, 41 AU 3], and
41 AU 38, exclusive of specimens termed artifacts, were dis­
carded. No analysis of any kind was attempted due to the
highly irregular method of sampling used in collecting the
pebbles.

MATRIX SAMPLES

Fifty-pound bulk matrix samples collected at 41 AU 36 were
discarded because there were no specific plans for future
analysis and because facilities availahle for permanent storage
of such large~ heavy samples were limited.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

. 267

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The Paleoindian and Early Archaic Periods
Subsurface testing and large-scale excavations at aboriginal
sites in the Allens Creek project area yielded materials
evidencing human activity from the Middle Archaic up through
the Late Prehistoric periods. No remains of cultural activity
during the Paleoindian or Early Archaic periods were recognized
in debris collections from the excavated sites. Fragments of
a few Angostura and lanceolate-type dart points observed in
a landowner's surface collection made at one site, 41 AU 18,
constitute the sole evidence of local human activity during the
Paleoindian or Early Archaic periods.
Middle Archaic remains contained in deposits at 41 Au 36
and 41 Au 37 rested on, or slightly above, indurated, carbonate­
encrusted surfaces (erosional contacts?) below which no additional
cultural remains were encountered. The occurrence of Middle
Archaic materials above such an erosional surface at Allens
Creek is a circumstance reminiscent of findings made by re­
searchers in the Trans-Pecos region of Texas and along the
Texas coastal plain. The situation seems to typify a regionally
more wide spread phenomenon believed to be a significant
indicator of paleoclimatic conditions along the coastal plain.
In the Trans-Pecos region, interdisciplinary efforts on
the part of archeologists, palynologists, and geologists (Bryant
1966, Dibble 1967, Bryant and Shafer 1977, Patton 1977) have
resulted in the following general outline of regional climatic
conditions spanning a period from 9,000 years ago up to the
present.
Bryant's pollen studies (1966, 1969) established the basic
framework of a mesic interval from 7000 B.C. to 4000 B.C. giving
way to xeric conditions gradually intensifying from 4000 BC up
to the present. Two important interludes were discerned. The
first was a period of severe erosion at about 3000 B.C. to 2500
B.C. The second was a brief mesic interval occurring from about
1000 B.C. to 200 B.C. (~round 550 B.C., after Bryant 1966).
The work of Dibble (1967) and Patton (197]) elaborated
knowledge of the erosional cycle, the time of its occurrence
being established more exactly at 2550 B.C. to 1250 B.C. In
soil monoliths collected by Dibble from Arenosa Shelter, Patton
found evidence of twenty-two major floods on the Pecos River
from 6500 B.C. up to the present. Of the twenty-two floods,
ten occurred in the 1300 year perfod from 2550 B.C. to 1250 B.C,
The brief mesic interval between 1000 B.C. and 200 B.C.
was recognized by Bryant l1966} on the basis of increased
amounts of grass and pine pollen. This was in keeping with
Hafsten's (1961) findings on the Llano Estacado, where increases
in grass and pine pollen were noted for the same time period,

268

ALLENS CREEK

This would suggest that the mesic interlude was a widespread
phenomenon, not restricted to the Trans-Pecos region.
By their very nature, archeological sites along the Texas
coastal plain have not yielded the wealth of paleoenvironmental
data that has come from the protected shelters of Trans-Pecos
Texas. Pollen is generally not preserved in conjunction with
prehistoric cultural remains and there are no known locations
where remains of a full cultural sequence from Paleoindian to
Late Prehistoric occur in stratified context. Faunal remains
are differentially preserved and most often represent Late Archaic
and Late Prehistoric activities only. It is thus difficult to
directly correlate the environment of the Trans-Pecos with
that of the coastal plain at any given time in prehistory.
There are, however, indirect lines of evidence suggesting that
paleo-climatic conditions were similar, in a very generalized
way, from one region to another.
Along one coastal plain segment of the Guadalupe River
valley in DeWitt and Gonzales counties, Fox and others (1974:
213-214) have noted "the apparent absence of Paleo-Indian,
Early Archaic, and Middle Archaic artifacts at modern flood
plain sites . . . ". The absence of such materials, they suggest,
may be the result of subsistence habits coupled with changes
in the alluvial processes of the Guadalupe and its tributaries.
Attention is called to the fact that Paleoindian, Early Archaic
and Middle Archaic remains occur in buried calcareous soils
on the fossil flood plain and that many of the chipped stone
diagnostics representing these periods are patinated. Debris
representing these periods was also found on sandstone terraces
and fossil flood plain terraces.
It is conjectured (Fox and others 1974: 213) that the
remains of Paleoindian, and Early Archaic activities on the
modern flood plain of the Guadalupe River valley were washed
away, scattered, or deeply buried in silt during the period of
erosion and flooding evidenced in the Trans-Pecos from 2550 B.C.
to 1250 B.C. (Patton 1977). Evidence of the early occupations
may have been further eroded or silted over during the brief
mesic interlude from 1000 B.C. to 200 B.C. (Bryant 1966). The
assumption implicit in these speculations is that the environ­
mental changes recognized through time in the Trans-Pecos are
also applicable to the Texas coastal plain.
Following a similar vein, Shafer (1968: 79) has noted an
absence of Early Archaic remains in the lower reaches of the San
Jacinto River valley in Montgomery County. Based on information
obtained from local artifact collectors, he found that Early
Archaic chipped stone diagnostics were occurring on the higher,
older terrace remnants aBove his project area. It was concluded
that sites down in the lower reaches of the valley were occupted
only as early as the Mtddle Archaic.
The general aBsence of Paleolndian and Early Archaic remains
from the Allens Creek project area is thus in keeping with
findings made in other major river valleys along the Texas

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

coastal plain. The findings by no means preclude the possibility
of Paleoindian activity in the region, but merely emphasize
the fact that remains of such activities would not be expected
in this part of the river valley.
The single exception, site 41 AU 18 yielding the Angostura
and lanceolate dart point types, is atypical in other respects
as well. Eroding out of the bluff face and recovered in a
cultivated field at the base of the bluff were numerous cobbles,
many of them chert, in a variety of sizes. The amount of
chipped stone debitage observed on the site suggests that much
quarry activity took place there. The cobbles and gravels indi­
cate an unusual geologic situation and may mark an older terrace
remnant, where cultural activities predating the bluffline
occupations took place.
Relying on the evidence from 41 AU 18 to demonstrate that
pre-Middle Archaic peoples were indeed active in the area, it
must be concluded that certain factors have elsewhere precluded
the discovery of their remains by archeologists. Among the
possibilities that should be considered are: 1) Sampling Bias ­
The pre-Middle Archaic populations were probably smaller than
later groups and the duration of their activities ;n the region
may have been shorter. They would have left fewer sites than
later peoples. making it highly unusual to encounter their re­
mains at any location. 2) For a variety of reasons. the pre­
Middle Archaic people may have practiced a settlement pattern
different from the Middle Archaic inhabitants of 41 AU 36 and
41 AU 37. Their sites may be in the area, but at different
locations altogether. 3) Pre-Middle Archaic remains may have
been largely obliterated or obscured by processes of erosion
and deposition in the Brazos valley during the past 6000 years.
Relative to this problem, the carbonate encrusted basal zones.
at 41 AU 36 and 41 AU 37 are considered very significant indi­
cators of an erosional sequence predating the Middle Archaic in
the lower Brazos River Valley.
The Middle Archaic
The remains collected from Middle Archaic components at
41 AU 36 and 41 AU 37 provide valuable insight into occupational
and burial practices of the period. The projectile point assem­
blage representing Middle Archaic activities is similar to
assemblages from the La Harpe Aspect of eastern Texas. The
projectiles are crudely flaked. weak-shouldered. and have parallel
to slightly contracting stems; most are within the morphological
range designated Gary by past researchers. The specimens from
Allens Creek demonstrate enough distinguishing variation within
the group to suggest that the Gary dart point type is too in­
clusive and should be more rigourously defined, For this reason,
most were placed in Miscellaneous Form groupings. Six other

270

ALLlSNS CREEK

dart pOints representing the PedepnaZes~ Mapeos~ Lange~ Tpavis~
WeZZs~ and Ensop types were also found in Middle Archaic
deposits at the two sites.
Radiocarbon assay of bone samples from two Group 1 burials
at 41 AU 36 have provided the only absolute dates now available
for Middle Archaic remains at A1lens Creek. The two dates ­
2610 B.C. and 1530 B.C. - provide a range of time during which
the Group 1 burials were interred. Early habitational remains
stratigraphically underlying the burials at 41 AU 36 predate
the Group 1 burial activity, but by an unknown number of years.
Based on comparison with the central Texas chronology the
projectile point assemblage, representing both habitattonal
and burial episodes, contains no forms suggesting any activity
earlier than the Middle Archaic.
The initial Middle Archaic habitational activities at
the two sites were centered within the deeper recesses of the
basin at 41 AU 36 and the erosional gully at 41 AU 37. Why
these low-lying spots along the bluff were selected for habita­
tion is unknown. The recesses may have provided some slight
protection from the elements or they may have been selected
simply because it was easier to pass back and forth between the
prairie and flood plain where the gullies had cut through the
bluff. Throughout the Middle and Late Archaic periods, the
gullies seem to have been important centers of activity and
must be considered major stopovers in the overall settlement
system.
In the Middle Archaic deposits at both sites, initial early
habitational activities were followed by burial activity,
Apparently, no interments were made until sandy fill began to
accumulate at each location. The sand seems to have been an
important prerequisite for the burial activity to begin, and
it provided the impetus for change in primary site function
from habitation to burial ground.
In the Middle Archaic deposit at 41 AU 36, there was a very
clear-cut distinction in the occurrence of hearths and burials.
All Middle Archaic hearths were found on the surface of Zone 2,
Burials occurred in close association with the hearths but were
surely interred from activity surfaces overlying the early
occupation on the Zone 2 surface. Midden debris found around
and above the Group 1 burials suggests that some type of habi­
tational activity continued during the period of time over
which the burials were interred. There were, how~ver, no hearths
laid down concurrently with the burials. Stratigraphic relation­
ships of hearths to burials at 41 AU 37 suggest that, although
habitation definitely preceded interment, habitation may have
continued along with the burial activity. Hearths were found
at levels from which the Middle Archaic burials may have been
interred.
The Group 1 burials at 41 AU 36 provide much new data on
regional burial customs during the Middle Archaic. Most often,

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

271

Group 1 burials were simple inhumations, the skeletons arranged
in an extended position on their backs with arms along the
sides. The bodies were oriented with the heads to the east­
southeast and south-southeast. There was one cremation in the
group, and small percentages of the burials were in semiflexed
( 3 %) a.n d f 1 e xed () %) bod y po sit ion s . 0 f t hr ee i nd i v i d ua 1 s
radically departing from the preferred headward orientation arcs,
all were males. Grave inclusions were found with seven (12%)
of the individuals in the group. The objects did not obviously
indicate status or occupation and were found with both males
and females.
The La t e .A r c ha i c
The Late Archaic at Allens Creek is best represented by the
Group 2 burials at 41 AU 36 and by similar manifestations at
41 AU 37. A comparitively small amount of cultural material
not directly associated with the burials was also recovered.
Whether this material was debris incidental to the numerous
interments, or the result of actual habitation concurrent with
burial activity, was a problem never adequately resolved.
The Late Archaic projectile point assemblage from the
two sites includes dart points with parallel, contracting, and
expanding stems. The parallel and contracting stem dart points
showed some differences when compared with similar forms in the
earlier Middle Archaic assemblage; they are longer, the shoulders
stronger, and the flaking finer. Projectile points falling
into previously established typological categories included the
following types: Ensor, Fairland, Gary, PalmiZZas, Yarbrough,
Ponahartrain, Travis, and Kent.
Accompanying Burial 2 at 41
AU 37 was a socketed bone projectile point. Similar specimens,
which are also assumed to be late Archaic, occurred in Zones
3A and 3B at 41 AU 36.
Two radiocarbon dates on Late Archaic material at Allens
Creek were obtained through assay of bone samples from Group 2
burials at 41 AU 36. The bone 'samples yielded corrected median
dates of 520 B.C. and A.D. 360. None of the hearths resulting
from Late Archaic activities at 41 AU 36 and 41 AU 37 retained
charcoal in sufficient quantities to permit radiocarbon assay.
At 41 AU 36, it is estimated that anywhere from 1 to 1.5
meters of fill had accumulated in the deeper reaches of the
basin by the time the Group 2 burial activity began. Accordingly,
the basin was a shallower and less pronounced feature than it
had been during the Middle Archaic. The deposit separating
Burial Groups 1 and 2 at 41 AU 36 is significant it that so
little habitationa1 evidence in the way of hearths and midden
debris was found. A period of light habitational and/or rapid
deposition is indicated.

272

ALLENS CREEK

At 41 AU 37, the influx of sand between Middle and Late
Archaic occupations began filling the drainage gully, making it
a still obvious but less distinct feature. As the stratigra­
phic units at 41 AU 37 were not as thick as those at 41 AU 36,
there was no opportunity to clarify the significance of the
stratigraphic break between Burial Groups 1 and 2 observed at
41 AU ~6.
.
The relationship between habitational and burial activity
during the Late Archaic is obscure at both sites. The scarcity
of hearths in stratigraphic association with burials would
suggest that little or no habitational activity took place con­
current with burial activity. Midden debris recovered around
and above the burials would suggest otherwise. However. compared
to the very distinct habitational surfaces or zones representing
the early occupation and the Zone 4· occupation at 41 AU 36,
the intervening deposit did not contain enough features or oc­
cupational residues to be-characterized as habitational.
Burial Group 2 at 41 AU 36, representing a Late Archaic
cemetery population of 145 individuals. and Burial 2 at 41 AU 37
provide much useful data concerning burial practices of the
period and, indirectly. of the import-export systems in which
the population participated.
Most of the Late Archaic burials were simple inhumations
(~6.5%), the majority (42%) being in extended positions lqying
on their backs. Semi-flexed body positions were the next most
common (121), followed by flexed burials (a.51), Three cremations
(2.11) and two bundle burials (1.4%) evidence compound burial
treatment or disarticulation and/or burning of the bodies prior
to interment. One distinctive feature of body deposition in
Burial Group 2 at 41 AU 36 was the placement of a small number
of burials face down in their graves. With the exception of
one male, all individuals interred face down were female, The
most common arm and leg pOSitions were extended parallel to the
torso (arms) and extended side by side (legs). There were six
instances of hands being placed to the face, and fifteen indi­
viduals had their legs crossed at the ankles. These two unusual
body arrangements were not expressed in Burial Group 1 and con­
stitute a major distinction.
The predominate orientation of Group 2 burials was with
heads to the east-northeast and north-northeast C~8.11}. Of
these, forty (45.511 were oriented to the north-northeast.
Twelve of the Group 2 burials oriented in the 335 degree to 360
degree arc clearly intrude into other Group 2 burials oriented
in the preferred north easterly arcs. From this it is inferred
that the orientation swung more to the north during the latter
period of interment activity within Group 2, Often individuals
radically departing from the predominate orientation arcs,
nine were female. In Group 1, a few male burials were oriented
in directions radically departing from the norm. No definitive
explanation can be offered for the shift in preferred orientation

from southeast in Burial Group 1 to northeast in Burial Group
2.

Grave inclusions were placed with seventy (48%) of the
Group 2 individuals at 41 AU 36 and also with Burial 2 at 41
AU 37, The grave goods included marine shell ornaments, worked
bone objects, boatstones, corner-tang knives, a ground stone
gorget', ocher, biotite schist, deer skulls and antlers, projectile
points, a graphite schist abrader, and red jasper pebbles.
These artifacts were placed in the graves of both males-and
females of all ages. The single recognizably meaningful pattern
of grave inclusions relative to age or sex was the restriction
of worked bone objects to individuals over twenty years of age.
Five individuals in Burial Group 1 apparently died as a result
of wounds inflicted by projectile points. Faipland and Kent
dart points and three untyped expanding stem dart points were
embedded in the bones of these five individuals.
The following major differences are noted between Burial
Groups 1 and 2 at 41 AU 36:
1. the predominant headward orientation changes from
southeast in Group 1 to northeast in Group 2
2. the arrangement of bodies with a hand to the face or
with legs crossed at the ankles occurs only in Group 2
3. the number and variety of grave inclusions increased
greatly in Group 2
4. the burial population more than doubles from Group 1
up to Group 2.
The Transitional Archaic or Early Late Prehistoric Period
Represented in clear-cut stratigraphic context relative to
a Late Archaic component, habitational and burial remains of a
Transitional Archaic or early Late Prehistoric component were
found only at 41 AU 36, Contained in Zone 4 (subunit Zone 4'},
these remains constitute a bridge in the cultural/chronological
sequence between Late Archaic components found at Both 41 AU 36
and 41 AU 37 and an early Late Prehistoric component isolated
at 41 AU 37, This component at 41 AU 36 is somewhat uncomfor­
tably termed a Transitional Archaic manifestation. Based on
sandy paste sherds and small Gapy dart points recovered from
Zone 4, an early Late Prehistoric expression could be argued.
Zone 4; 30 to 50 cm. aBove the Group 2 burials in Zone 38
at 41 AU 36, yielded small Gapy dart points, Godley pOints, and
a Kinney biface. This projectile point assemblage is quite
distinctive when compared to assemblages representing earlier
and later components, The Gapy points are much smaller than the
contracting stem projectiles recovered in Zones 3A and 3B, and
fall within the upper size range for arrow points. The Godley

274

ALLENS CREEK

points, all associated with Burial 154 as grave inclusions,
are not matched oy other specimens at 41 AU 36 or elsewhere in
the project area.
The use of ceramics is evidenced in Zone 4' by the occurrence
of 25 sandy paste sherds which, though having the same general
characteristics as other sandy paste sherds recoverd at Allens
Creek, were nevertheless a distinct group unto themselves.
Unfortunately, no radiocarbon assays are available to pro­
vide absolute dates for activities represented by the remains
found in Zone 4. Based on stratigraphic position and presence
of the GodZey points with Burial 154, a time range of A.D. 550
to A.D. 950 is tentatively suggested.
In sharp contrast to the deposits containing Burial Groups
1 and 2 at 41 AU 36, Zone 4 yielded relatively great amounts of
midden debris - animal bone, debitage, burned clay, and mussel
shell. Al so found in the zone were five features - two mussel
shell heaps, a deer bone cache, a dog carefully buried in a
circular pit, and a scattered hearth evidenced by burned clay
and stained earth. Primary usage of the site as a habitation
is unquestionably demonstrated.
Nine human burials were interred in the lower reaches of
the Zone 4' deposit. All of these burials were simple inhumations,
the bodies placed in semi-flexed positions in the graves.
Reflecting these semi-flexed body arrangements, most of the
Group 3 .burials lay on their sides. Deposition on the right
side was slightly more common. Arms across the pelvis, hands
to the pelvis, and placement of a hand to fue face were all
evidenced in the group. Legs were semi-flexed. Seven of the
nine individuals were oriented from west-northwest to north­
northwest (271-345 degrees). The greatest number, ftve, were
oriented to the north-northwest (316-360 degrees). Two indi­
viduals were oriented to the south-southeast and south-southwest.
Only Burial 154, an adult male, contained grave inclusions 1n
Group 3; these consisted of seven Godley points scattered about
the chest area.
.
The Late Prehistoric
The Late Prehistoric was represented at all three of
the intensively excavated sites at Allens Creek. At 41 AU 36,
the Late Prehistoric component is comprised of Burial Group 4
and a very" light scatter of midden debris. Two stratigraphically
distinct components representing the period were isolated at
41 AU 37. A comparison of cultural materials recovered from
each of these two components provides some significant inSights
into changes occurring in the late Prehistoric from A.D. 900 to
A.D. 1400. The unstratified deposit at 41 AU 38 also yielded
a rich collection of late Prehistoric materials.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

275

Components of the Late Prehistoric Period yielded
Perdiz~ and DarZ (41 AU 38 only) arrow points.
Only SaaZZorn points occurred in the earlier of the two com­
ponents at 41 AU 37. The later component contained both
ScaZZorn and Perdiz. saaZZorn~ Perdiz~ and DarZ points were
all found at 41 AU 38.
Pottery fragments were recovered from late Prehistoric
contexts at all three of the sites. Four sandy paste sherds
came from 41 AU 36. Site 41 AU 37 contained th{rty-one grog­
tempered sherds and fifty-seven sandy paste sherds. The fol­
lowing general group of sherds were recovered at 41 AU 38:
1) 66 bone/grog tempered, 2) 37 bone tempered, 3) 126 grog
tempered, and 4) 280 sandy paste sherds representing six dif­
ferent groups. The appearance of sandy paste (Goose Creek?)
sherds in pre-arrow point Zone 4t at 41 AU 36, and the ratio of
sandy paste Goose Creek sherds to grog-tempered San Jacinto
sherds in the two late Prehistoric components at 41 AU 37, demon­
strate a strong similarity to the ceramic chronology proposed
for the Galveston Bay area by Aten and Bollich (1969). The
bone/grog-tempered and bone-tempered sherd groups appear late
at 41 AU 37 and 41 AU 38, possibly only with Perdiz points.
Bone/grog-tempered sherds found at 41 AU 31 and 41 AU 38 are
perhaps of considerable technological significance and have not
been previously reported in the region.
late Prehistoric deposits yielded three radiocarbon dates,
two from 41 AU 37 and one from 41 AU 38, Charcoal from Zone 3
at 41 AU 37. from which ScaZZorn arrow points and Goose Creek
sherds were recovered, yielded a corrected assay of A.D. 920 +
70. Zone 1 at 41 AU 37 produced charcoal which yielded a cor~
rected assay of A.D. 1480 + 80. SaiZZorn and Perdiz points and
roughly equal numbers of Goose Creek and San Jacinto sherds were
also recovered from Zone 1. At 41 AU 38, a carbon sample from
Features 4 and 5 yielded a corrected assay of A.D. 1480 + 80.
These three radiocarbon dates provide the known range of-time
during which late Prehistoric activities occurred at Allens
Creek.
Habitational features found in late Prehistoric context
included a small, single layer cluster of stones at 41 AU 37 and,
at 41 AU 38, a small refuse pit, two mussel shell/midden debris
accumulations, and two small rock clusters. All of these
features are considered to be the remnants of food preparation
and consumption activities. Excavation of deposits surrounding
these features was too restricted horizontally to permit definI­
tion of any patterned activities which may have occurred adjacent
to each.
Burial practices during the late Prehistoric at Allens
Creek are evidenced by Burial Group 4 at 41 AU 36. by a single
burial in Zone 3 at 41 AU 37, and indirectly, by observations
made as leonard Kolodztejczyk watched an unknown number of
burials gradually erode from the bluff face at 41 AU 38. The
ScaZZorn~

276

ALLENS CREEK

thirteen individuals in Burial Group 4 were all simple inhuma­
tions, the bodies arranged in flexed and semi-flexed positions.
The skeletons rested on both their right and left sides, deposi­
tion on the right side being slightly more common. Hands were
placed to the face or pelvis. Legs were in flexed and semi­
flexed positions. Six of seven individuals in Group 4 were
oriented to the east-southeast and south-southeast. Of these
six, five were in the east-southeast arc. One individual was
oriented to the north-northeast. There were no grave inclusions
found with the Late Prehistoric burials at 41 AU 36.
Burial 7 at 41 AU 37 occurred in Zone 3, which contained
the earlier of the two Late Prehistoric components at the site.
Placed in a flexed position with the head oriented to the north­
northwest, Burial 7 was a simple inhumation. The body was laid
in the grave on its back. One hand was placed to the face and
the other extended parallel to the torso. The legs were flexed
and collapsed left. The burial contained no intentional arti­
factual inclusions.
At 41 AU 38, no human burials were encountered in controlled
excavations, but Leonard Kolodziejczyk was able to provide
certain details concerning burials he saw eroding from the bluff
face over a period of years. The skeletons were shallowly
buried and seemed to have been in flexed positions. In apparent
association with one or more of the burials were the shell
columella artifacts shown in Figure 42. These shell objects
were stylistically much different from the shell artifacts found
in Late Archaic context at 41 AU 36 and 41 AU 37,
Food Resources and Seasonality
The faunal remains recovered during excavations suggest
that, beginning with the initial Middle Archaic occupations at
41 AU 36 and 41 AU 37, and continuing on through to the Late
Prehistoric as evidenced at 41 AU 37 and 41 AU 38. primary sub­
sistence efforts were directed at exploitation of food resources
within the Brazos River valley. The upland prairie was hunted
for antelope and jackra5bit. but apparently not as intensively
as the flood plain. Fragments of grinding slabs recovered from
Zones 3A, 3B, and 4t at 41 AU 36 indicate that plant food
processing, perhaps seed grinding. was practiced in the area
. during the Middle and Late Archaic. A mano found on the bluff
slope below 41 AU 38 may also indicate plant food processing,
but cultural period affiliation and true function of the object
are in doubt due to post-depositional disturbance and battering
suggesting use as a hammerstone.
Thirty-three fish. bird, and mammal species were identified
in the collection of faunal remains recovered from the three
sites; of these, seven species are represented by only one indi­
vidual and thus occur stngly within certain components. Alli­
gator, beaver, and skunk were found only in Zone 3A at 41 AU 36.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

277

Ground squirrel and pintail duck remains were also recovered
from 41 AU 36, in Zones 3B and 4 respectively. At 41 AU 37,
hawk remains came from Zones 5 and 6 and an antelope tooth was
found in Zones 3 and 4. A bobcat is represented in the 41 AU
38 collection. Horse bones found at 41 AU 38 are believed to be
of modern origin.
The remaining twenty-six vertebrate species were distributed
more-or-1ess equally among all components. Gar, frogs, snakes,
and pond and land turtles occurred in exceptionally great
numbers both in Zones 3-4 and 5-6 at 41 AU 37. Duck and goose
remains were found in Archaic and Late Prehistoric contexts,
though not in great numbers. With the single exception of ante­
lope, the remaining thirty-two species of vertebrates evidenced
in the archeological collection are represented by living animals
found today in the A11ens Creek region. Analysis of skeletal
elements suggests that whole animals were being brought to the
sites for consumption.
Invertebrate species found in the sites included freshwater
mussels and crayfish. Eleven mussel species are represented in
the collection. Both mussel and crayfish remains occur in
Archaic and Late Prehistoric context at A11ens Creek, though not
necessarily in every component.
The faunal remains from the A11ens Creek sites were not ex­
amined for purposes of determining season of aboriginal occupa­
tion at each site. The presence of migratory waterfowl remains
suggest fall, winter, and early spring activities, but certainly
do not rule out spring and summer occupations. Careful analysis
of deer teeth, fish otoliths, and mussel shells recovered from
cultural deposits at A11ens Creek m~y someday provide additional
seasonality information.
Local Prehistoric Settlement Pattern
The land area encompassed 5y the A11ens Creek Nuclear Gen­
erating Station constitutes an arbitrarily defined unit within
which the project's archeological research was, with limited
exceptions, strictly confined. Survey of the acreage in the
project has resulted in the location of thirty-three prehistoric
aboriginal sites; of these, six were found along the banks of
A11ens Creek. The remaining twenty-seven sites occurred at
frequent intervals along the bluff overlooking the Brazos flood
plain. There were no sites found on the flood plain, a mass
of land constituting by far the largest portion of the project
area. Thus, three major landform features and their respective
microenvironments are represented in this consideration of
settlement patterns. The study is, of necessity, limited mainly
to the project area as there has been so little additional
archeological survey and excavation work done nearby. Exceptions
to this situation include a survey of the upper reaches of

278

ALLENS CREEK

Allens Creek by the Center for Archaeological Research (Bass
1974), weekend survey of an adjoining segment of the bluff
southeastward from the project area, and one site, 41 FB 3,
recorded by Wayne Neyland on Pool Hill in 1949 (TARL County
Site Files).
As discussed earlier in this section, there were no
Paleoindian or Early Archaic components defined at Allens Creek.
Absence of remains representing the periods is attributed to
one or more of the following: smaller populations; shorter
stays in the area; different settlement patterns; and/or geo­
logic processes tending to destroy or obscure the sites.
Middle and Late Archaic sites are found in the area and
seem always to occur in the erosional gullies cutting through
the bluff. In outline, the sites are circular to oval, ranging
in diameter from 25 to 50 meters. The sites served both as
habitations and as cemeteries, though burial activity was appar­
ently keyed to the buildup of sandy colluvium in the gullies.
Easy passage from flood plain to prairie, proximity to varied
food resources, and sandy, well-drained soil are reasons sug­
gested as influencing the selection of habitation sites. The
combination of soft sand, high, flood-free ground, and proximity
to habitation sites are factors which may possibly have in­
fluenced the placement of cemeteries.
Whether habitation and burial activity took place simul­
taneously at the Archaic sites was a problem never adequately
resolved. The final impression to be offered is that the
midden debris does not suggest full-scale habitation concurrent
with deposition of the Archaic burials. The Archaic populations
responsible for the burials found at Allens Creek, especially
at 41 AU 36, must have inhabited other locations as the
cemeteries developed.
Late Prehistoric sites occur both in the erosional gullies
and along steep-faced sections of the bluff. In the gullies,
they range from circular to oval with diameters of 25 to 50
meters. Along the bluff tops, Late Prehistoric sites are elon­
qate, with dimensions up to 300 meters in lenqth and 50 meters
in width. Primary site usage was for habitation purposes,
though human burials were interred at the same locations. Late
Prehistoric Burial Group 4 at 41 AU 36 was apparently a
formalized cemetery, there being no strong indications of con­
current habitational activities. The reasons for site selection
in the Late Prehistoric are the same as those suggested for the
Archaic components. No explanation is advanced for the increased
size of the Late Prehistoric sites over Archaic site extent.
Settlement along Allens Creek above the bluff is believed
to have taken place during the Late Prehistoric, though time­
diagnostiC artifacts were not collected from all of the sites.
Differential rates of exposure may also be a factor, in that more
deeply buried Archaic remains are not exposed as often as the
shallower Late Prehistoric materials.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

279

No prehistoric sites were found anywhere on the flood
plain, though there must certainly have been extensive activities
taking place there. The cultural remains may be so deeply
buried in alluvium or so scant as to render them imperceptible.
The limited additional survey work done outside of the
project area tends to reinforce the pattern recognized within
the nuclear plant boundaries. The Center for Archaeological
Research surveyed ditch segments totaling a linear distance of
33 miles in the headwaters of Allens Creek north of the project
area. All of the drainages surveyed cut across the upland
prairies as tributaries to the main channel of Allens Creek and
as lesser drainages cutting down through the bluff in more
direct routes to the Brazos. No sites were found along these
drainages. Weekend surveys by the author extended coverage
of the bluff from a point approximately 1.7 kID. downstream from
41 AU 31 southward to the Austin-Fort Bend county line. Eight
additional prehistoric sites were recorded during the course of
this work. In 1949, Wayne Neyland recorded site 41 FB 3 at a
location roughly 13 km. east of the project area on the opposite
side of the Brazos valley. Situated on the southern end of a
prominent Pleistocene terrace called Pool Hill. 41 FB 3 is in
an erosional gully. Significantly, Neyland reported a human
burial with a marine shell pendant identical to grave inclusions
found with Group 2 burials at 41 AU 36.
The available evidence indicates that sites along the
immediate edge of the bluff overlooking the Brazos flood plain
served as the primary loci for intensive and repeated aboriginal
occupations from the Middle Archaic up through the Late Pre­
historic periods in the cultural sequence. The absence of
definable sites on the prairie and flood plain may be a result
of sampling error or problems of differential exposure, but most
likely reflects the true importance of the bluff sites as the
main centers of babitation in the local prehistoric settlement
system.
General Inferences and Observations
The data recovered from the prehistoric sites at Allens
Creek permit a very generalized characterization of aboriginal
lifeways over an estimated time span of four to five thousand
years in the lower Brazos River valley. The sites contain
evidence demonstrating repeated human visitations from Middle
Archaic up through Late Prehistoric times, or, in terms of
absolute dates, from roughly 3000 B.C. to A.D. 1500. It is
assumed that usage of the sites through this entire period was
seasonal in nature, that they were never occupied on a year­
round basis. Consistent selection through time of the same camp
sites along the immediate edge of the bluff overlooking the
Brazos valley suggests that these locations met critical living

280

ALLENS CREEK

requirements not specific to any temporal or cultural period.
The habitational residues found in the sites, limited
primarily to chipped stone tools, waste products resulting
from chipped stone tool manufacture, and food remains of bone
and shell, permit only very limited direct inferences concerning
everyday habits and activities of the prehistoric residents.
Animal bone and shell recovered from the various components
indicate that a basic hunting and gathering sUbsistence orien­
tation did not change dramatically through time. The people were
apparently taking advantage of animal food products from the
prairie, flood plain, creek, and river. It is assumed that
trees and plants served as important sources of nut, seed, and
fiber foods but their utilization 1s evidenced only indirectly
by grinding slabs and manos found on the sites. Where exploi­
tation of animal foods seems to have varied little through
time, vegetal food use may have fluctuated greatly depending
upon a number of factors. However, the data necessary to
directly ~emonstrate the changes 1n plant food utilization and
availability were not found in the sites. Limited analysis of
the food residues permits no clear-cut statement as to what
season or seasons of the year the sites were inhabited. Further
carefuly study of the faunal materials might be productive in
this respect.
Chipped stone tools and manufacturing residues consisted
almost exclusively of chert. Most of the chert was apparently
obtained locally, probably from the extensive gravel bars found
nearby in the channel of the Brazos River. Judging from the
size and quality of chert cobbles now found in the river, almost
all of the chipped stone tools found in the sites could have
been manufactured from these locally available materials. The
finished tools, mostly dart and arrow points, were probably used
for hunting, though some may have served for cutting or scraping.
There were remarkably few scrapers and bifaces, other than
projectile pOints, recovered from the sites. A number of chert
flakes and chips believed to have been altered through use as
cutting and scraping tools were recognized in the collections.
No microscopic wear pattern analysis was done on these flakes
nor on any of the chipped stone tools. It is therefore not
possible to comment on the specific uses, nor materials, to or
upon which these tools may have been applied. A basic core-flake
reduction technology seems to have been practiced during the
Archaic as evidenced by striking platforms preserved on the
bases of many of the dart points. Both core-flake and core­
blade reduction techniques were applied in the Late Prehistoric.
The appearance of polyhedral cores, blades, and blade arrow­
point preforms in Late Prehistoric context provide evidence
of the core-blade industry. Some of the finished tools and
debitage recovered from Late Prehistoric context have a "waxy
sheen" which suggests that the chert had been heat treated.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

281

No evidence of shelter structures was found on any of the
sites. No confident statement may be made as to whether or not
the Allens Creek people had any kind of shelter from the elements.
although it is assumed that they did. A number of hearths found
in the sites were surrounded by food remains, debitage s and
chipped stone tools; nowever s excavations were not extensive
enough to reveal patterned activities around any of these features.
The hearths consisted of single-layer accumulations of rock
having no recognizaBle subsurface structures that is, there was
no evidence of cooking pits beneath the hearth stones. Analysis
of rocks used in hearth construction indicates that carbonate
concretions and sandstone obtained from locations along the
bluff were the major components. Carbonate concretions were
more common in Middle Archaic context with use declining in
later times. This disappearance of carbonate concretions in
hearths is attributed to the gradual covering by colluvial
deposits of surfaces yielding the concretions.
The sequence of change in projectile points, excluding
those associated with burials in Middle- s Late-, and Transitional
Archaic contexts at 41 AU 36 and 41 AU 37, is compatible with
the sequence for the La Harpe Aspect as defined by Johnson
(1962: 268). Those characteristics of Johnson's sequence which
are pertinent to the Allens Creek material indicate
. . . a growth in the popularity of contracting stem
dart pOints . . . which development slightly pre­
ceeded . . . the appearance of pottery vessels of
various plain and often crude wares.
Comparison of Burial Groups 1 & 2 at 41 AU 36
The three variables of number of individuals, orientation,
and grave in~lusions provide a means for contrasting the Middle
and Late Archaic cemeteries represented by Burial Groups 1 and
2 at 41 AU 36. Discussion of these variables will serve as a
point of departure in considering the significance of the findings
at A11ens Creek in a much broader interregional perspective.
Along with orientation and grave inclusions, the dramatic
increase in number of individuals from Group 1 up to Group 2
constitutes a very obvious difference Between the two cemeteries.
The total estimated count of individuals for Burial Group 1
was sixty-one, versus an estimated 145 individuals for Burial
Group 2. As. determined from available radiocarbon assays, it
appears that both cemeteries were in use for the same length of
time - roughly 1000 years. Assuming that all other factors,
such as duration of encampment, general health, climate, level
of inter-group hostilities, and consistent cemetery usage, were
equal, and fully realizing that they may not have been. it is
suggested that an increase in the living Archaic population
accounted for the increase in Group 2 burials.

282

ALLEN8 CREEK

The shift in predominate body orientations from head to
the southeast and feet to the northwest in Group 1 to head
northeast and feet southwest in Group 2 is another readily
apparent and remarkable distinction between t~e two groups
(see Fig. 53). This c~ange in general orientation is statis­
tically signfficant (see Appendix III); however, the reason
for this change in body orientation could not be determined.
It was originally hypothesized that the predominant
headward orientation in each group was dictated by the position
of the rising sun or moon at the time of interment. Were this
the case, the shift in orientation from Group 1 to Group 2
could be explained very simply as coinciding with the season of
the year when the burial took place. Accordfngly, most of the
Group 1 burials would have been interred during the winter,
when the sun and moon rise in a more southeasterly direction.
Likewise, the Group 2 burials, mostly interred during the summer,
would be oriented in a northeasterly direction where the sun
and moon rise at that time of the year.
Unfortunately, precise astronomical calculations of the
sun's summer and winter solstices and the moonts nodes for the
Allens Creek vicinity do not bear out this hypothesis. The
headward orientations of Group 1 burials fall 'south of the sun's
winter solstice and moon's node and, predictably, the headward
orientations of Group 2 burials fall generally north of the
sun's summer solstice and moon's node. Though not supported by
the astronomical facts, this hypothesis may yet prove to
have some merit.
The idea for this explanation of the orientation shift
developed as the burials were being exposed in the field. The
excavations began in December and ended in August of the following
year. The full range of seasons was thus experienced as the
site was worked. At sunrise on a summer day, it was possible
to sight down the length of an in situ Group 2 burial and see
that it was more-or-less aligned with the rising sun. In winter,
the same was true with the Group 1 burials. Without benefit of
precise surveying equipment, or perhaps through optical illusion
caused by haze and viewing angle, the people may have oriented
their dead as nearly as possible to the rising sun without
being as accurate as is required by modern techniques in astro­
nomy.
If this explanation for the orientation shift is ruled un­
acceptable, then there seems to be no other plausible interpre­
tation readily at hand. The idea is one that could be futher
tested through seasonality studies at some later date. After
this lengthy and inconclusive discussion, it is important to
again emphasize that the predominate orientation did change
substantially from one group to the other. It is-aTso apparent
that the predominate orientation in each group was dictated by
an overriding influence which must certainly have been a matter
of cultural preference.

Two other matters relating to orientation are worthy of
further mention. In both groups, there were small numbers of
individuals radically departing from the predominant orientation
arcs. In Group 1, the aberrant individuals were all males. In
Group 2, all but one were females. Here again, a reason or
explanation for these shifts in body orientation cannot be given,
but it is important to note and emphasize these anomalies both
within and between the groups.
The second matter relating to orientation involves twelve
Group 2 individuals interred with their heads to the north and
northwest. Five of these individuals intrude, and by inference
post-date, burials oriented in the predominant northeastern
arc. It appears that the preferred orientation was shifting
toward a more northerly directton during the latter stages of
burial activity in Group 2. Significantly, these northerly
orientations are much more in keeping with the Transitional
Archaic Group 3 burials than with the majority of Group 2
burials. These particular Group 2 burials will be mentioned
again in this discussion.
The third, and perhaps most important, distinction between
Burial Groups 1 and 2 involves the quantity, quality, and variety
of grave furnishings included with certain burials in each group.
The first general observation is that only seven individuals
(12%) in the Group 1 population were buried with grave goods:
these inclusions consisted of two types of artifacts, a Pede~­
naZes dart point and pencil-shaped pointed bone objects. In
Burial Group 2 seventy individuals (48%) were buried with grave
goods. The assemblage from Group 2 contains hundreds of speci­
mens representing eleven general types of artifacts. The
dramatic increase in the number of grave furnishings from Group
1 to Group 2 is very significant. Also important are the raw
materials, many of which are not locally available, used in the
manufacture of the Group 2 grave inclusions. Why there was a
sudden increase in the number and variety of grave inclusions
from the Middle Archaic to the late Archaic, and how artifacts
of distant origin were concentrated at 41 AU 36, are two
questions worthy of more lengthy consideration.
Though not involving grave furnishings per se, the five
individuals in Burial Group 2 with dart points embedded in
various elements of their skeletal anatomy should again be men­
tioned because they were unique to the late Archaic component.
No such incidences of violent death were recorded in the other
three burial groups. Dart points embedded in human skeletons
have been reported from the Mather Farm site (41 WM 71 in Wil­
liamson County, the Archery Range site (41 TV 1281 in Travis
County, and the Rodd Field site (41 NU 29} in Nueces County
lTARl County Site Filesl. The projectile point types represented
in t~ese situations include DarZ~ Ensor~ and Marcos-Ensor
speCimens, indicating that the "shooting incidents" occurred
sometime during the late Archaic. These three cases, along with

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

285

five from Group 2 at 41 AU 36, make a total of eight individuals,
all apparently from the Late Archaic period, who died of pro~
jectile point wounds. There are no known instances of conflict­
related deaths during earlier Archaic times. Though the data
are limited, the findings permit at least the tentative sug~
gestion that hostilities were on a region-wide increase during
the Late Archaic.
Caldwell's Concept of "Primary Forest EfftclencyP
The impression gained from the predominance of grave inc­
lusions in Burial Group 2 was that the availability of imported
material goods and inspiration to bury them with the dead were
conditions of the Late Archaic existence in the Allens Creek
region. This impression was reinforced by the greatly reduced
quantities and varieties of grave inclusions in Middle Archaic
and Transitional Archaic contexts at 41 AU 36.
The concentration of boatstones, a ground stone gorget,
corner-tang knives, biotite schist, graphite, and marine shell
ornaments all relatively far removed from the sources of raw
materials used in their manufacture, at 41 AU 36, provides very
tangible evidence of a flow of materials over a large territory
during the Late Archaic. These materials, coupled with the
absence of recognizable imported artifacts with Group 1 burials,
suggest that the Late Archaic peoples at Allens Creek were
sharing in a material import/export system ultimately linking
them with Woodland populations ~f the southeastern U.S.
In the classic treatise entitled Trend and Tradition in
the Prehistory of the Eastern United States~ Joseph Caldwell IS
concept of "primary forest efficiency", a widely accepted
organizational principle used to characterize changes in the
Archaic lifeways of the eastern United States, provides a
functional framework within which to vtew the Allens Creek
findings, and similar Archaic manifestations over much of coastal
and central Texas.
Quoting Jesse D. Jennings l19681
Caldwell explains that in the Eastern woodlands • . . the
peoples of the Archaic Stage learned to exploit a wider
and wider spectrum of resources with ever-increasing
skill until by 2000 B.C. there was a dense population
enjoying an optimum adjustment to a generous environment •
• . . at the beginning of the Archaic, there was local
diversity of crude stone tools, but the tool kit was
small. As centuries passed, the kinds of species taken
increased continuously and there was a multiplication
of specialized tools of every sort; technologic skill
also increased. By 2000 B.C, there was much uniformity
of growth and a coalescing tn adjustment by local
peoples . . .

286

ALLENS CREEK

Caldwell leaves us with the notion of scattered
groups "growing up together" and slowly influencing
each other, becoming more and more inter-connected
in what he calls the "Archaic Diffusion Sphere".
The population density of the continent was
probably at the highest point possible under
the Archaic lifeway of 2000 B.C~ There was easy
communication and there was the greatest potential
for cultural innovation yet to occur in the New
World.
What Archaic efficiency implies, then, is a
technology utilizing many raw materials not evident
In early cultures, in a series of inventions
or innovations.
In a test of Caldwell ts hypotfiesis using pal eoethnobotanical
remains from the Archaic horizons at the Koster site In Illinois,
Asch, Ford and Asch (J972) find evidence of "first-line" plant
food utilization as early as 5000 B.C, First-line foods are
defined as "those food resources which are most easily col­
lected in large quantity and which are most nutritionally
complete. 1I (Ibid; 27) Contrary to Caldwell ts hypothesis,
use of first-line plant foods from 5000 B.C, to 3000 B,C. at
Koster acted to the exclusion of a broader range of available
plant foods (primary forest efficiency!, these others being more
difficult to gather and process and not as nutritional. There
was no gradual addition of new foods to the diet during this
time span. Commenting on Caldwell ~s bel fef that primary forest
efficiency was achieved by 2000 B.C., Asch and others (Ibid: 261
suggest that "ft may be necessary to move the date for maximum
util ization of wild foods to a later time".
According to the same authors, evidence for Caldwell's
primary forest efficiency is found in Middle Woodland context
at Macoupfn, a site near Koster. In discussing the trend to­
ward utilization of a broader range of plant foods by Woodland
people, increase in population and "environmental deterioration"
are two possibilities advanced as explanations for the Woodland
shift to primary forest efficiency. Of these two, population
increase is given the most attention:
. . . if Woodland populations were larger, they
would have required more food, and thus they might
have been forced to·col.lect.a greater raAge of
plant foods . • .
With larger populations, procurement territories
for villages might become more limited so that,
where previously an area was visited only once
eyery two or three years, now a smaller area would
be harvested every year. Under these circumstances,

tne effects of an adverse fluctuation in the supply
of a first~line food could not be counteracted by
enlarging the collecting territory. Unless alter­
native food sources were tapped~ subsistence security
would decrease among Woodland people.
Our interpretative framework leads to the suggestion
that population stress may have been greater for the
Middle Woodland inhabitants at Macoupin even though
a larger population was supported on a wider re­
source base (Asch~ Ford and Asch 1972: 29).
Criticisms directed at Caldwell's model of primary forest
efficiency based on findings at the Koster and Macoupin sites
are summarized as follows:
1) Archaic people between 5000 B.C. and 2000 B.C. knew of
full range of plant foods available to tnem, but didn't
exploit this full spectrum because they were able to
exist comfortaBly on a narrow range of first-line foods.
It was a matter of practicality rather than ignorance
that led them to rely on this diet of first-line foods.
2) Archaic people between 5000 S,C. and 2000 B.C. probably
had as much or more leisure time as did later "forest
efficient" people. Having leisure time cannot by it­
self account for a proliferation of material goods.
3} It was a matter of necessity rather than choice and
knowledge that led Middle Woodland people to exploit
the broader range of plant foods and become "forest
efficient" in Caldwell ~s sense of the term. It is
population dynamics rather than accumulated knowledge
that playa critical role in the evolution of sub­
sistence systems,
Asch, Ford and Asch (Ibid; 30) conclude by suggesting that
Caldwell·s model be altered to account for regulation of human
populations below the carrying capacity of the environment and
for changes in the size of prehistoric populations.
One of Caldwell"s basic premises finding support in the
Koster and Macoupin botanical studies, though not for the same
reasons, is that there was apparently a population increase
during the Late Archaic and Woodland Periods. An array of
artifacts evidencing an influx of new and exotic raw materials,
increased technological capabilities, and many innovative,
specialized tool forms appeared concurrent with this population
growth. Tne increased population resulted in development of
a cultural environment where, as Jennings (1968: 129-130} said:
"There was easy communication and there was the greatest

288

ALLENS CREEK

potential for cultural innovation yet to occur in the New
World,1I In light of Caldwell IS model, the contrast in ceme­
tery population and material cul ture from Burial Group 1 to
Burial Group 2 at 41 AU 36 is completely within expectations
for cultures influenced by traditions and circumstances similar
to those of the eastern United States,
The belief that cultural groups in central Texas shared in
the Archaic and Woodland traditions of the eastern United
States is certainly not new. In 1959, J. Charles Kelley wrote:
Close relationships are visible between the
c e nt r a 1 Te xa s Arc ha icc u1 t u res and 0 the r sly i n9
east and northeast of the area,
. . . Wi tho u t any do u bt at all , the Ba 1cones
phase represents a southern and western
variant of an Arcbaic continuum. The principal
variations from the eastern Archaic notable in
this Texas pbase are the gradual loss of
polished stone from east to west, and the lack
of shell mounds in Balcones phase components.
The general way of life, site characteristics,
artifact roster, and basic ecological adaptation
seem remarkably similar throughout both eastern
Archaic and the Balcones phase, The general
temporal horizon is identical, but the Ba1cones
phase Archaic survives much later than the eastern
Archaic (Kelley 1959; 286-7}.
Perhaps the strongest evidence for relatio nships betw een
the Archaic people of central Texas and people in regions to
the northeast is boatstones and other polished stone artifacts
derived from the Ouachita Mountains in Arkansas. The specimens
recovered at 41 AU 36 are good examples, and Patterson (1937a)
has documented a number of others occurring throughout central
and eastern Texas. There are also at least three records of
bannerstones found at sites on the Texas coastal platn.
Speaking strictly in terms of absolute numbers of such
artifacts now recorded, it is significant to note that many
more boatstones than bannerstones have been found in Texas.
As far as can be determined, the Ouachita-derived boat­
stones and gorgets found in central Texas all occur in Late
Arc ha icc 0 nt ext. Ac cor din g to Dr. C1are nc eWe bb (l 9.7 5 L
boatstones began to replace bannerstones in the lower ~ississippi

region. Judging from the small number of oannerstones found in

Valley, along with an absence of recognizable eastern artifacts
in grave furnishings of Middle Archaic Burial Group 1, it would
appear that long-distance importation of materials was most
intense during the Late Archaic (500 B,C. to A.D, 400) as
represented by Burial Group 2 at 41 AU 36.
Burial Group 2: Interregional Comparisons
of Time and Taxonomy
At this point it is appropriate to view Burial Group 2 at
41 AU 36 relative to contemporary cultures in central Texas, in
east Texas and in the lower Mississippi River valley. It will
also be necessary to clearly define meanings of the taxonomic
labels "Archaic" and "Woodland" as they are applied to the
cultures discussad in this study. In placing the Group 2
burials properly in the matrix of time, the concern will be
with determining who it was, either in central Texas or in the
lower Mississippi valley. that the Al1ens Creek people may have
been involved with in obtaining the imported materials deposit­
ed with their dead at 41 AU 36. The terms "Archaic" and
"Woodland must be defined as they relate to the various
cultures involved because the terms create an artificial
. disjunction which tends to mask the real and very important
contemporaneity of the groups in question.
The three radiocarbon assays available for the Group 2
burials are presented as time ranges calculated by adding and
subtracting the standard deviation of each assay from the
median date (Fig. 54}. Thus far in the discussion, oldest and
youngest median dates have been used in defining the time span
represented by the Group 2 burials. It is important to note the
considerable variation possible through use of combinations of
oldest and youngest dates when standard deviations are taken
into consideration. Time ranges are also provided for central
Texas, Coral Snake Mound, and the lower Mississippi valley.
Sources of dates and ranges used in the figure follow the
illustration,
Westward into central Texas, the corrected assays for
Burial Group 2 indicate a correspondence in time with the Late
Archaic. The time period represented by the Late Archaic in
central Texas runs from 650 B.C. to about A.D. 750. The
chronological position, the hunting and gathering subsistence
orientation, and the absence of pottery and the bow and arrow
from the material culture are the major bases for designating
the cultures of this period as "Late Archaic". On the basis
of sensitive time-diagnostic artifacts (mainly dart points),
the Late Archaic of central Texas has been divided into IIphases"
attuned primarily to chronologic setting and, to a lesser ex­
tent, the geographic distribution of artifact assemblages
characteristic of each "phase". The phase designations ­
San Marcos and Twin Sisters - were suggested by Weir (1976).
ll

290

ALLENS CREEK

The time spans represented by the phases have been refined by
Prewitt (1976, n.d., and 1979). Other than the similar time
spans, there were Ensor and FairZand dart points, diagnostic of
Twin Sisters I, and corner-tang knives, tentatively of San
Marcos II vintage, found with the Group 2 burials at 41 AU 36.
Although the Ensor-FairZand diagnostics found in Burial Group
2 might seem to suggest a stronger correspondence with the
Twin Sisters I period, it is suggested that these chipped
stone diagnostics appeared on the site near the end of the time
period during which the Group 2 burials were deposited.
Of the three radiocarbon assays available for Group 2, one
(TX-2452) falls comfortably into the time range of Twin Sisters
I. However, the other two dates correlate equally well with
time ranges for San Marcos I and' II. Assay on bones from
Burial 14 (TX-2451) yielded the earliest date for the burial
group. Associated with the burial were three large marine
shell pendants suggesting that the Allens Creek people were
obtaining import items at this early time as well as later. It
would appear that central Texas people may have been partic­
ipating in a far-ranging import-export system perhaps as early
as 650 B.C.
Northeastward from Allens Creek along the Sabine River,
the Coral Snake Mound in Sabine Parish, Louisiana has yield~d
radiocarbon assays and diagnostic artifacts indicating a
IIWoodland" affiliation for the people who constructed the mound
and buried their dead within (McClurkan, Field and Woodall 1966).
The three radiocarbon assays available for Coral Snake Mound
provide a time range corresponding to the latter half of the
period during which the Group 2 burials were deposited at 41 AU
36. Grave inclusions and caches found in the Coral Snake
Mound included such artifacts as copper earspools, large stemmed
bifaces, boatstones, a carved quartz figurine, and MarksviZZe
Stamped pottery. The artifactual materials found at Coral
Snake strongly indicate participation in the Hopewell inter­
action. Made of a syenite probably derived from the Ouachita
Mountains of Arkansas, one of the boatstones found at Coral
Snake is very similar in shape and material to a boatstone
specimen recovered at 41 AU 36, The time period represented,
the copper and ground stone artifacts, the presence of pottery,
and the mound structure itself are the characteristics permit­
ting aSSignment of Coral Snake to the Woodland period.
Time ranges for the Poverty Point, Tchefuncte, and Marks­
ville cultures of the lower Mississippi River valley, are also
presented in Figure 54. Dating of these cultures is tenuous
due to poor preservation of organic materials suitable for
radiocarbon assay. The time ranges given for each culture in
the figure represent a distillation of opinions expressed by
various authori·tfes. By comparison to this lower Mississippi
valley sequence, development of the Group 2 cemetery apparently

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

291

commenced during the waning years of the Poverty Point culture,
termed "Archaic" (Jennings 1968: 213), and continued during the
"Woodland" Tchefuncte and Marksville periods.
Throughout this study, Burial Group 2 at 41 AU 36 has been
referred to as a "late Archaic" manifestation. This designation
has been used because of the group's position. in time relative
to the central Texas chronology, the absence of artificial
burial mounds in the immediate region, and the lack of ceramics
and the bow and arrow in the culture's material inventory.
However. it must be emphasized that Burial Group 2 is un­
questionably coeval with Woodland cultures in northeast Texas
and louisiana. In particular, the time range defined by the
dates for Coral Snake Mound and Marksville are important, for
it is in sites occurring during this time period that very
strong evidence of participation in the Hopewell interaction
is found. Marksville is described as a local expression of
Hopewell and certainly Coral Snake fits in the same general
pattern.
In stating that the Group 2 burials are Late Archaic, the
intention is not to preclude. through adherence to a rigid
chronologie or developmental framework, the possibility of
coexistent Late Archaic and Woodland cultures. The designation
signifies that the cultural groups represented by the burials
lived by hunting and gathering, lacked pottery and the bow and
arrow, and didn't bury their dead in artificial mounds.
Conversely, the Woodland cultures of northeast Texas and
Louisiana had pottery and constructed mounds. but otnerwise
existed at about the same time and in the same way, that is,
by hunting and gathering, as did their Late Archaic contem­
poraries at A11ens Creek and in central Texas. In the dis­
cussion to follow, it will be important to remember that the
import/export activity in which the Late Archaic Allens Creek
people participated probably involved Woodland people of north­

directly in the mainstream of systems through which materials

The Late Archaic and Woodland Import-Export Sphere
The words "import" and "export" are used cautiously in
lieu of any more appropriate terms to define the mechanism of
transport resulting in the movement of goods over such long
distances. "Importation" is defined as the act of bringing or
carrying in goods from an outside source. especially for the
purpose of trade. Conversely, "exportation" is the act of
sending or carrying goods away from a source area or redis­
tribution center, especially for the purpose of trade (adapted
from the Amepiaan Hepitage Diationapy 1976). These terms are

used instead of "exchange" or lIinteraction" because they are
most appropriate in describing movements of objects and, at the
same time, do not necessarily connote relationships between
people which may be implied by the situation, but which cannot
be conclusively demonstrated by the available facts. Artifact
lIimportation is undeniably demonstrated at Allens Creek by the
grave furnishings found in Burial Group 2. The raw materials
used in the manufacture of these artifacts were somehow
transported from source areas a considerable distance from 41
AU 36.
Although artifact importation is clearly evidenced by the
artifactual remains in Burial Group 2~ lIexportation" is not.
Two very important assumptions, both possibly spurious, are made
when the mechanism of artifact transport is defined as involving
both import and export. The first assumption is that the
Allens Creek people were not traveling to raw material source
areas for the purpose of obtaining the rock and shell used in the
manufacture of the grave goods found at 41 AU 36. It is fur­
ther assumed that the people at Allens Creek were sending out
something in return for the goods that were coming in. Cer­
tainly implicit in this discussion is the idea that an exchange
system was In operation whereby the Allens Creek people main­
tained relationships with neighboring groups to the east and
west, and that the interfacing groups passed materials back
and forth to one another.
In suggesting "import-export" over "exchange" or lIinter­
action" as a general reference to the mechanism of material
transport~ the important point to be made is that there is as
yet no way to document the number of times a particular
material changed hands, if at all, in being transported from
point of origin to point of recovery. Before such mechanisms
can be demonstrated, much additional data must be collected
concerning absolute date and season of occupation at sites
yielding the distinctive artifact forms known to have been
circulated throughout the different regions. Until such data
become available, it is essentially unrewarding to speculate
on the nature of direct contacts between people resulting in
the movement of goods, and, by inference, of the ideas, customs
and habits which constitute the more human aspects of the
cultural exchange.
Though the basic mechanisms of Archaic and Woodland
period import-export systems cannot yet be usefully defined,
it remains productive to study the regional distriButions of
imported items for what they may tell of the involved systems in
a more general sense. Two monographs written 5y J.T. Patterson
(1936, 1937a) have served as invaluable aids 1'n' studying the
regional distributions of boatstones and corner-tang knives. In
these publications, Patterson plots the distributions of boat­
stones and corner-tang knives reported to him by archeologists
and collectors from Texas and neighboring states.
ll

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

295

Patterson found that the greatest number of boatstones
occurred in the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas, near present­
day little Rock, where materials such as ironstone, graywacke,
metamorphosed sandstones, slate, syenite, and trachyte - all
commonly used in boatstone manufacture - were readily available.
Sites with boatstone manufacturing residues are recorded in
the area.
A seven county area of central Texas, bounded roughly by
Austin, Brownwood, and Waco, is the inferred manufacturing area
for corner-tang knives. In that region, high quality chert,
occurring in cobble and tabular forms of large size, is readily
available. Though there are no definitely recognized manu­
facturing sites, the sheer number of corner-tangs found in the
seven counties is considered to be strong enough evidence to
define the production area.
In the present study, plotting the distribution of
Archaic-age marine shell artifacts over an 80 county region of
Texas at first suggested that a manufacturing area was centered
around three bays near the south central coastal city of Corpus
Christi, Texas (Fig. 49). However, the predominance of utili­
tarian artifacts and the absence of ornamental shellwork,
similar to that found at A1lens Creek and elsewhere in central
Texas, lead to the tentative conclusion that the Corpus Christi
area was not the primary manufacturing center. Based on this
conclusion, it is suggested that the A11ens Creek shell orna­
ments originated on the coast of Alabama or Florida. However,
there are presently no clearly identified shell ornament manufac­
turing sites in either of these states.
These distributional studies provide information concerning
three very important aspects in the consideration of mechanisms
of artifact import and export. A reasonably complete dis­
tributional study will demonstrate, through characteristic
patterning of artifacts oyer the territory, a manufacturing
center, an a~ea of availability, and a directional trend of
distribution. The manufacturing area is basically identified
by the occurrence of great numbers of the artifact within a
restricted geographic region. In defining the manufacturing
center, the raw material resource base and the presence of sites
containing manufacturing residues are also critical requisites.
The area of availaoi1ity is the whole territory over which the
artifact was distributed. Directional trend of distribution may
be inferred in situations where the shape of the region over
which the artifact type is distributed assumes a more-or-less
linear configuration, especially from the manufacturing center
to the farthest reaches of the area of availability.
Using these assumptions in conjunction with Pattersonts
studies of the corner-tang and boatstone, and with the marine
shell distribution presented herein. two manufacturtng centers
may be defined, distributional trends suggested, and lmport­

export system geography demonstrated as the region over which the
areas of availability coalesce (Fig. 55). It is suggested that
the are a wher e all t hr e e 0 f the art i fa c t -t Ypes' we rea vail a b1 e
was the southwesternmost extension of an import-export sphere
which linked peoples scattered over much of the continent's
eastern half (Fig. 56). This area should indicate with a fair
accuracy the territory where import and export activities were
taking place among Late Archaic and Woodland peoples. The import­
export usphere" is defined as the range or domain within which
the peoples involved in the import-export system existed, acted,
or had influence (adapted from Amepiaan Hepitage Diationapy 1976).
Throughout this sphere in Texas, Late Archaic assemblages
similar to the materials found with Group 2 burials at 41 AU 36
are known to occur (Appendix II). Records of five other
similar sites within a 50 km. radius of Al1ens Creek are
believed to indicate an interface among areas of availability
where goods from the various manufacturing centers were more
readily obtained than elsewhere.
Secondary manufacture~ that is~ replication of an artifact
type at a location other than the presumed major manufacturing
center~ is a factor tending to cloud the issues in the study
of an import-export system. This practice is most obvious
with boatstones found in central Texas sites~ the majority of
which are manufactured from limestones and sandstones occurring
in the immediate area. The few ornamental marine shell artifacts
found in Archaic components of sites near Corpus Christi on
the south central Texas coast might also be explained as pro­
ducts of secondary manufacture. However~ unlike the geographi­
cally-diagnostic rocks used in boatstones, shell objects would
require sophisticated trace element analysis to distinguish
between local products and imported items. The same is true
of corner-tang knives. Though the cherts of central Texas are
relatively distinctive, the characteristics have been defined
only informally and very subjectively. It would be interesting
to obtain some of the specimens reported to Patterson (1936,
1937b) from states north and northeast of Texas for comparison
with specimens known to have originated in central Texas.
Although the idea has not been carefully explored in this
research, it appears that the exotic, imported objects are most
often present as grave furnishings. The locally produced
objects are more often found in camp and midden deposits. The
tentative inference is that the imported items were intended
for ceremonial or ritual use, while locally manufactured
artifacts served utilitarian functions.
It is interesting to speculate on what items the central
Texas Archaic groups may have been feeding into the system in
exchange for goods imported from the northeast; this again
assumes that some sort of exchange must have been involved in
order for the people to acquire the import items. Turning to

the assemblage of Late Archaic grave inclusions from 41 AU 36,
the corner-tang knives, biotite schist, and graphite are objects
and materials of probable central Texas origin which may have
been introduced into the system. The corner-tang knife is
considered especially significant in this respect as Patterson's
distributional studies suggest that it was manufactured within
a well-defined production area of central Texas and distributed
widely in all directions, including areas to the north and east.
Burial Groups 3 and 4 at 41 AU 36
Burial Groups 3 and 4 at 41 AU 36 were very different from
Groups 1 and 2 in a number of respects. In terms of cemetery
populations, there were a total of only twenty-threeiindividuals,
ten in Group 3 and thirteen in Group 4, compared to a total of
206 individuals in Groups 1 and 2. Here again, the great
decrease in the number of individuals may be the result of
several different factors, either singly or in combination, such
as the size of the living population, the seasonal duration of
activities in the area serviced by the cemetery, and the overall
duration of cemetery use, Unlike Groups 1 and 2, the Group 3
burials were unquestionably interred at a time when the site
was being used as a habitation. Light midden debris in the
matrix around the Group 4 burials suggests that there may have
been habitation concurrent with burial deposition, but the
situation was not clearly demonstrated either way. It should be
noted that recovery efforts in the Zone 5 deposits containing
the Group 4 burials were directed almost exclusively at
burial collection. The midden debris recovered from Zone 5
was collected incidental to exposure of the burials. Also, much
of the Zone 5 deposit was bulldozed away to facilitate more
rapid and safe excavation of the underlying burials. The zone
was thus very minimally sampled for midden debris.
Other major factors distinguishing Groups 3 and 4 from
Groups 1 and 2 were the exclusively semif1exed and flexed
burial positions, the essential absence of grave furnishings,
and the headward orientations of the individuals. Although
very small percentages of semiflexed and flexed burials did
occur in Groups 1 and 2, they were much more the exception than
the rule. In Groups 3 and 4, all of the burials for which body
position could be determined were semiflexed and flexed. Of
the twenty-three individuals in Groups 3 and 4, only one
individual in Group 3 had grave inclusions, these consisting
of some GodZey projectile points scattered about the chest
area. Where 12% of the burials in Group 1 and 48% in Group 2

The majority of Group 3 burials had headward orientations to

the north-northwest. Most important, these northerly-oriented
burials mirror the orientations of twelve individuals in Group
2 assumed to have been interred late in the Group 2 burial
sequence. It appears that at least one of the burial practices
evidenced in Group 3, a north-northwesterly headward orien­
tation, had its beginnings in the final stages of the Late
Archaic burial episode. This trend is equally important to
the interpretation of Doth burial groups. In Group 2, the twelve
northeasterly-oriented burials were atypical of the majority
of northeasterly-oriented burials. In other respects - Body
positioning, deposition, and grave inclusions - these burials
were not remarkably different from the majority of individuals
in Group 2.
Retraction of the Eastern Import-Export Sphere; A Model
Viewed from the perspective of developmental periods in
the Archaic and Woodland of the eastern United States as
described by Caldwell(J958), the Middle and Late Archaic Burial
groups at 41 AU 36 are completely within expectations for a
regional expression of contemporary eastern cultures. With
Burial Groups 3 and 4, the Transitional Archaic and Late Pre­
historic cemetery components found at the site, exactly the
opposite is true, These burials are well within the range of
expectations for the cultural periods they represent in central
Texas, but depart rather strikingly from expectations for
contemporary burial manifestations occurring in northeast
Texas and elsewhere in the eastern United States.
The contrast between Groups 1 and 2 and Gro'ups 3 and.4 is
reflected more generally throughout coastal and central Texas,
northeastward from the Nueces River to the Brazos and Trinity
Rivers. During the Late Archaic, there is artifactual evidence
suggesting that partiCipation in the eastern import-export
network spread as far west in Texas as Kerr ahd San Saba counties.
However, components representing later periods in the cultural
sequence across much of this same region yield little or no
evidence to suggest continued partiCipation in import-export
activities with groups from regions to the northeast.
Burial Group 3, found in Transitional Archaic Zone 4· at
41 AU 36, contained no grave furnishings suggesting participa­
tion in import-export activities with cultural groups to the
northeast. Other than early sandy paste pottery, which is
probably of local manufacture, Transitional Archaic components
at sites south and west from the Trinity River are not now known
to yield artifacts recognizable as imports from regions to the
east and north. The people inhabiting these sites apparently
subsisted through hunting and gathering.
Likewise with Burial Group 4, the Late Prehistoric
cemetery at 41 AU 36, there were no artifacts suggesting

participation in an import-export system linking the living
population with regions to the northeast. Late Prehistoric
components at sites elsewhere in central Texas and along the
coastal plain also do not contain materials readily suggesting
such import-export activities. East and north from the middle
Neches River valley, in sharp contrast to central Texas,
Caddoan sites occupied in Late Prehistoric times (A.D. 800 ­
1300) show evidence of extensive import-export activities as
indicated by artifacts of pol ished stone, marine shell, copper,
and chert. While the Caddo Indians began devoting considerable
energy to farming, the nomadic peoples of central Texas and
the coastal plain continued their hunting and gathering
existence.
Based upon the distribution of ground stone, marine shell,
copper, and ceramic artifacts, and upon subsistence patterns, it
appears that participation in import-export relationships with
the eastern culture areas was drastically reduced or perhaps
terminated during the Transitional Archaic and Late Prehistoric
of central Texas and the central coastal plain. East of the
Trinity River in Texas, Transitional Archaic and Late Pre­
historic peoples maintained contacts with eastern groups, the
tangible evidence of the contact being found in the burial
mounds and subsistence remains of Caddoan cultures occurring
throughout northeastern Texas and in adjoining states.
The stratified burial groups at 41 AU 36, in concert wittt
data from other cemeteries and with artifact distribution
studies in central and northeastern Texas, are thus interpreted
as evidence of a retraction of ttte eastern import-export
sphere in Texas from maximal extent during the Late Archaic
to minimal extent during the Late Prehistoric. The area
included in this discussion is bounded on the south by the
Nueces River, on the east by the Gul f of Mexico, ,on' the west by
a line from the Nueces River in Edwards County nortttward to the
Red River, and on the north by the Red River lFig. 56}. A
hypothetical model for retraction of the eastern import-export
sphere is outlined as follows:
l} During the Middle Archaic, basically isolated groups
subsisted through hunting and gathering pursuits
adapted to the particular localized environments
wherein they operated. Though there were striking
similarities between the limited array of artifacts
from region to region, most objects seem to have been
manufactured from locally available resources.
2} Expanding Late Archaic and Woodland populations in
Texas and throughout the eastern United States
(brought on by efficient use and abundant supplies of
plant and animal foods) resulted in greatly improved
systems of communication and transport. A wide variety

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

303

of artifacts and raw materials were circulated across
half the continent, connecting such divergent points
as the Florida Gulf coast and the Ouacnita Mountains
with the western reaches of the import-export sphere
in central Texas. The late Archaic and Woodland
groups across the eastern half of Texas both received
from, and contributed td, th~ syst~m.3) Sometime in the period between 50 B.C. and A.D. 200
along the western periphery of the import-export
sphere in Texas, pressures were exerted on local
populations which triggered the gradual out inexorable
retraction of the sphere northeastward across central
Texas and the coastal plain to eventually reach the
much reduced area of east Texas where participation
continued on into late Prebistoric (Caddoan) times.
The retreating westerly margin of the sphere reached
the Allens Creek area between A.D. 200 and A.D. 400,
its passage marked by a shift in burial orientation,
and by the interment of at least five individuals who
died violently.
4) Unlike the Transitional Archaic and late Prehistoric
hunters and gatherers in central Texas, the people
of northeastern Texas continued to be strongly in­
fluenced by cultures to the north and east. Accordingly,
there appear in Caddoan contexts of northeast Texas the
man-made mounds, wide variety of exotic artifacts, and
agricultural practices common to cultures over much of
the eastern United States during that time period.
With but few technical innovations such as pottery and
the bow and arrow, the people of central Texas and the
coastal plain continued to practice the localized
hunting and gathering subsistence techniques so
adequately developed during the Archaic. They were
influenced only in a very peripheral way by the effects
of eastern import-export activities as expressed in
the Caddoan culture of northeast Texas.
The model presented above is supported by a considerable
body of information, but certainly there are other facts which
do not support the hypothesis. The remainder of this discussion
will be devoted to a consideration of these various lines
of evidence, both pro and con.
In suggesting that the Middle Archaic groups of Texas were
not participating in import-export activities with cultural
groups to the northeast, great reliance is placed on the
findings in Burial Group 1 at i 41 AU 36 and in an Atchafc
cemetery, 41 lK 28, recently excavated in live Oak County,
southern Texas. In 1975, Burial Group 1 at 41 AU 36 constituted
the first definitely established Middle Archaic cemetery known

304-

ALLENS CREEK

in Texas. In 1977 and 1978, however, a Texas Hignway Department
crew under the direction of Charles Johnson found that 41 LK 28
also contained an extensive Middle to Late Archaic-age cemetery.
Individuals in Burial Group 1 at 41 AU 36, which dated
between 2610 B.C. and 1530 B.C., were buried with bone tools
and a PedernaZes point. Individuals in the cemetery at 41 LK 28
were buried with a number of different artifacts including
CastroviZZe~ Lang~ Bulverde-like, and PedernaZee dart points,
hammerstones, six kinds of minerals in raw, unmodified form,
marine shell (five different species), shark teeth, pOinted bone
awls, deer antler mallets, tine flakers, tubular stone pipes
(cloud blowers), grinding slabs, and manos. Although no radio­
carbon assays are yet available, the cemetery is tentatively
dated at 800 + 300 (Johnson 1979). Significantly, all of the
grave goods ii these two cemeteries were apparently manufactured
from locally available raw materials. There were no materials
in either cemetery which were obviously imported from regions
far removed from the site locations. It is interesting to note
that even though there is a much greater variety and quantity
of artifacts at 41 ~K 28 than 1n Group 1 at 41 AU 36, the
inventory still does not match the grave good assemblage found
in Late Archaic Burial Group 2 at 41 AU 36. Because the sites
are separated by 800 or more years and a considerable geographic
distance (ca. 230 km.), it is suggested that the 41 LK 28
cemetery was in use during a time span several hundred years too
early, or was perhaps located too far south, to evidence partici­
pation in the eastern import-export sphere. Nevertheless, the
41 LK 28 cemetery sbows a progression towards the increasingly
complex material culture of the Archaic as described by
Ca 1d we 11 (I 958 ) .
The Middle Archaic cemeteries at 41 LK 28 and 41 AU 36 are
considered to be the best evidence against any widespread par­
ticipation 1n the eastern import-export sphere prior to the Late
Archaic. Assuming that they were in use in Texas prior to 1500
B.C., as in the lower Mississippi Valley region, the three
bannerstones found along the Texas coastal plain offer scanty
evidence supporting the possibility of limited eastern import­
export activities during the Middle Archaic. Certain rectangular
ground stone gorgets found in central Texas sites may also repre­
sent Middle Archaic imports; they are remarkably similar, both
in morphology and material, to gorgets reported from Poverty
Point in Louisiana. Unfortunately, because knowledge of such
specimens in central Texas has come from surface collections and
non-archeological excavations, there is no control over the
relative or absolute chronological occurrence of such specimens.
Caldwell {1958} suggests that expanding populations brought
on increased interaction and a proliferation of material goods
during the Late Archaic of the eastern United States. Asch, Ford
ahd Asch.(1972) agfeed with Caldwell that there was ~ population
increase, but attributed the increase to factors other than

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

305

more efficient use of food resources. At 41 AU 36, the cemetery
population more than doubled from Group 1 to Group 2, suggesting
a dramatic increase in the living Late Archaic population.
Weir's (1976) proposed population increase in central Texas
during his Round Rock Phase (2250 B.C. to 650 B.C.) is based on
the dense concentration of sites representing the phase through­
out the region. These speculations concerning a population in­
crease are admittedly based on very tenuous lines of evidence.
A number of assumptions are made when burial counts and site
densities are used to infer such increases. In critical consid­
erations of the model, the inferred population increase during
the Late Archaic could certainly be called into question. What­
ever the underlying reasons were, it seems clear that there was
increased movement of artifactual material during the Late Archaic
in Texas, as evidenced by the wider range of raw materials and
the greater variety of artifact forms showing up at sites across
the eastern half of the state.
The clear-cut temporal relationship of boatstones, corner­
tang knives, distinctive marine shell ornaments, and worked bone
objects to one another is strongly evidenced by the grave inclu­
sions found with the Group 2 burials at 41 AU 36. In the past,
all of these materials have been reported from various sites in
central Texas and on the coastal plain, but sound contextual
data and chronological placement were generally not available.
At 41 AU 36, all of these materials were concentrated together
into a single Late Archaic component dated between 650 B.C. and
A.D. 450 (based on earliest and latest standard deviations).
Knowing that these materials occur contemporaneously in Late
Archaic context, it is possible to use Pattersonts studies of
boatstone and corner-tang knife distributions, the marine shell
distribution study in tOis report, as well as the occurrence of
similar materials with burials in central Texas and along the
northern coastal plain, to demonstrate the extent and intensity
of participation in the eastern import-export sphere during
the Late Archaic.
Patterson's t1937al distribution study records boatstones
occurring as far southwest as Guadalupe, Comal, and Kerr counties
in Texas. Of seventy-five boatstones reported for Texas, forty­
nine were made of limestone and sandstone. Many, if not all,
of these specimens were undoubtedly made locally rather than
imported from some other region. At least thirteen of the
specimens recorded by Patterson in Texas probably came from
sources in the Ouachita Mountains. Of these, one was found in
Comal County (elaeolite-syenite) and another in Williamson
County (andesite). Comal and Williamson counties are both along
the western margin of the import-export sphere as defined in
this report. Though many of the boatstones found in central
Texas are local products, it is very significant that at least
a few specimens from the Ouachita Mountains occur along the
southwestern margin of the area over which the influence of the
eastern import-export sphere is postulated. The occurrence of

306

ALLENS CREEK

these specimens is felt to demonstrate unquestionably the parti­
cipation of central Texas peoples in a system ultimately linking
them with Archaic and Woodland groups much farther to the north
and east.
Relative to the findings at 41 AU 36, Pattersonts (1936,
1937b) study of corner-tang knife distributions is most useful
in demonstrating that the knives found with the Group 2 burials
probably originated west of Allens Creek in central Texas. More
important, however, the study shows the artifact form to be
widely distributed outside the state of Texas. The corner-tang
is suggested as one of the items fed into the import-export net­
work by central Texas groups. The assumption that all of the
corner-tang knives found in other states originated in central
Texas mayor may not be true. The cherts used in manufacture
of the corner-tangs have not been studied objectively in an
attempt to determine source areas. It is thus not possible to
pin all corner-tangs down to one manufacturing center such as
central Texas and the association of corner-tangs with boatstones
and marine shell 'ornaments at 41 AU 36 are the major, albeit in­
direct, lines of evidence suggesting that corner-tangs were
manufactured in central Texas and exchanged for materials
originating to the east and north.
Marine shell ornaments in Archaic context are distributed
across the eastern half of Texas in much the same way as are
boatstones. The major exceptions are the shell artifacts found
at sites around three bays along the south central Texas coast.
Because most of these shell artifacts are utilitarian rather
than ornamental objects, it has been concluded that the Texas
coast was probably not the origin of the shell ornaments found
in Late Archaic components at Allens Creek and elsewhere in t~e
state. Other than the Texas coast, the next mo~t likely source
of the shell would be the Gulf coast of Florida. The evidence
now available suggests that the Florida coast was indeed the
source of shell artifacts circulating through the import-export
system, both during Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric (Caddoan)
times. It is nevertheless disturbing to know that the south
central Texas coast offered such a ready supply of large whelk
shells and that a limited number of marine shell ornaments
showed up in Middle Archaic context at site 41 LK 28 (discussed
above) and in Late Archaic context at the Kent-Crane site near
Copano Bay. Though it is not now indicated, future research
may prove that the marine shell was coming from the Texas coast.
If so, marine shell found in Archaic contexts such as at Al1ens
Creek would not be the important indicator of long range import­
export activites that it is now considered to be.
Retraction of the area oyer which eastern imports were
distributed in Texas is strongly indicated by the geographic
distribution and temporal occurrence of materials such as ground
stone, copper, and marine shell, all kriown to have been circulated
through the import-export system. The differences between the
southwesterly extents of Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

307

Caddoan components ~earfng artifactual evidence of fmport.export
participation make it strikingy clear that the retraction took
place. On the strictly hypothetical suggestion that retraction
of the import-export sphere began as a result of population
pressure, only very nebulous lines of evidence may be offered
in support. The FairLand and Ensor points, violent deaths, and
orientation shift recorded in Zone 3B and Burial Group 2 at
41 AU 36 will be the strands of evidence woven into an admittedly
flimsy argument in favor of this population pressure hypothesis.
In Burial Group 2 at 41 AU 36, five of twelve burials
oriented in a northerly direction intruded into burials oriented
in the more prevalent northeasterly direction. Two of the five
people who unquestionably died as a result of projectile point
wounds were ~riented in more northerly directions and are
assumed to have been interred during the closing stages of
activity in Burial Group 2. These two individuals, Burials 96
and 99, were shot with FairZand points.
West of A1lens Creek in central Texas, FairLand points,
along with the DarZ and Ensor types, are generally believed to
date slightly 1ater-{A.D. 200 - A.D. 500 than the CastrovilZe~
MarshaZZ~ MonteZZ~ and Marcos types(650 B.C. to A.D. 200), the
dart point assemblage most commonly associated with the corner­
tang knife,
Quoting from Corbin (1974: 37) in his reassessment of the
Aransas Focus:
"Aransas Focus ll should denote only the type site
(Johnson) and those other sites containing the
predominant projectile point assemblage of Ensor~
Catan~ DarZ-FairZand~ and Matamoros. . . •
The
Aransas Focus was preceded by another cultural
complex which is represented by Zones la and lb
of Kent-Crane and other sites • . • which contain the
projectile point assemblage of BuZverde~ PaZmiZZa8~
and Matamoros, along with a high percentage of
shell tools (gouges and adzes) and incised
decorated bone work.
In the above statement, great significanc~ is ascribed to Corb1n·s
belief that Ensor and DarZ-FairZand projectile points post-date
deposits yielding marine shell artifacts and incised bone work,
two artifact classes strongly represented in Late Archaic Burial
Group 2.
The inference intended is that most, if not all, of the
violent deaths evidenced in Burial Group 2 at 41 AU 36 occurred
in the closing stages of that episode of burial activity. The
temporal occurrence of FairZand points - thought to post-date
corner-tang knives in central Texas and deposits bearing shell
tools and incised bone on the southern coast - supports his
contention.
However, the other three violent deaths in Group 2 do not

308

ALLEN8 CREEK

directly support the hypothesis. Body orientation and projectile
point types to not demonstrate the late interment of these three
burials as conclusively as did the FaipZand points with the first
two burials. Until radiocarbon assays prove or disprove the
claim, it, shall be contended, based on admittedly tenuous lines
of evidence, that all of the violent deaths o~curred during the
latter half of the Group 2 burial episode and that they offer
stark evidence of the pressures being exerted on the Late Archaic
inhabitants of Al1ens Creek by hostile groups from surrounding
territories.
Whether because of a gradually hotter, drier climate,
encroaching bands of bison hunters from the southern plains, or
some combination of both, it is hypothesized that Late Archaic
peoples east of the Ba1cones Escarpment come into conflict with
their western neighbors and were absorbed, exterminated, or
pushed out of the region by hunting/gathering groups who re­
quired greater territorial ranges in attempting to make their
living. It may also be that pressure on the Allens Creek people
from the west caused them, through displacement, to come into
conflict with peoples inhahiting areas to the east and south of
Allens Creek. The projectile point types involved in the violent
deaths permit this kind of speculation. This idea poses some
very complex, interrelated problems concerning climatic change,
population fluctuations, and carrying capacity not to be con­
sidered in this study. Weir l1976} has touched on these problems
in discussing the central Texas Archaic, but there is still much
fruitful ground for study.
An alternative hypothesis is that the flow of material"s
through the import-export system was disrupted by events taking
place iOn northeast Texas, the lower Mississippi valley, and
perhaps even further east. The 300 to 400-yearinterval in
mound building activities between construction of such early
mounds as Coral Snake (Jensen 1968), Jonas Short (Jelks 1965),
Westerman (Dee Ann Story, personal communication), Bellevue
(Fulton and Webb 1953), and Shane (Hoffman 1970) and later
Caddoan mounds is such a widespread phenomenon that the frontier
settlement pressures postulated above may have been only a mar­
ginal symptom of more pervasive changes taking place in the
southeastern area of the continent (Story 1980). It is, however,
considered very significant that the postulated retraction of
the eastern import-export system from central Texas occurred at
about the same time that the early phase of mound building ended
in northeast Texas. The latest acceptable radiocarbon date for
the Marksville period activities at Coral Snake is about A.D.
400 (see Fig. 54). It was not unit1 about A.D. 800 that con­
struction of the Caddoan mounds began in northeast Texqs. Cur­
tailment of import-export activities apparently co~responds to
this same interval from A.D. 400 to A.D. 800.
Placement of the eastern limit of import-export sphere
retraction at the Trinity River (Fig. 55) may be ill-considered

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

309

in view of the distribution of later Caddoan pottery and the
geographic location of the Chupek site near Waco. The heartland
of the Caddoan culture throughout its history was the area from
the middle and upper Trinity and Neches river systems eastward
to the Red River and thence northward through the Red River
drainage to the southern margin of the Ouachita Mountains.
River drainage to the southern' m'argin of the Ouachita Mountains.
It is throughout this region that tbere is strong evidence of
Caddoan participation in the eastern import-export network.
Contrary to the model, a number of Caddoan pottery types have
been found in central Texas, far to the west of the major Caddoan
centers. The occurrence of these ceramics in central Texas
belies the notion that hostile hunters and gatherers prevented
interaction of peoples in central Texas with regions to the
east after the Late Archaic and Woodland periods. Significantly,
however, it is only pottery that shows up in Late Prehistoric
context and not the more exotic imported ground stone, marine
shell, and copper which might be expected if full-fledged parti­
cipation in the eastern import-export system were underway. It
may be that the Caddoan and central Texas groups were involved
in an exchange of locally produced goods, such as pottery and
chipped stone tools, that didn't involve the eastern network
per se.
Along the same lines, the Chupek site near Waco, Texas, on
the Brazos River is the westernmost outpost of Caddoan culture in
Texas. Except for this site, Caddoan settlement was generally
east of the Trinity River. Again, if the belief is that groups
influenced by eastern culture were retreating in the face of
hostile encroachment from the west, how and why did this Caddoan
settlement survive along the western frontier?
Though the model presented above is not t~tal1y satisfactory,
its general outline is felt to Be valid. Ultimately, partici­
pation in the eastern import-export system seems to be linked to
the forces which dictated the change from the universal, locally­
adapted hunting and gathering economy of the Archaic to the
sharply contrasting lifestyles of the hunter/gatherers of central
Texas and the farmers of northeast Texas.

SKELETAL AND DENTAL MATERIALS FROM THE ERNEST WITTE (41 AU 36)
AND LEONARD K t41 A~ 37} SITES
Robert M. MaZina and CZaud A. BrambZett

INTRODUCTION
T~e skeletal materials from the Ernest Witte (41 AU 36) and
Leonard K (41 AU 371 sites are in a generally poor state of
preservation. Most skeletal elements are fragmentary and few
hones (exce~t for metatarsals, metacarpals and phalanges) are
complete. Cranial materials are terribly fragmented. Dental
materials are in a reasonably good state of preservation, but
quite commonly not intact.
Prior to determining age and sex for individuals represented
in the skeletal population, the number of individuals in each
arc~eo10gica1 feature l had to be determined.
In many cases, a
single individual was represented, but in others, several were
represented. Degree of completeness among the latter, of course,
varied, and in many features an additional individualts) was
represented by a single bonets).
Evaluations of sex and of age at the time of death were
based upon criteria presented bj Krogman (1962) and Brothwel1
(1972), as well as upon the authors' own experiences. Se~ and
age determinations depend, of course, upon t~e relative
completeness of t~e skeleton. Sex determination was based, in
order of priorlty,on innominate (e.g.~ sciatic notch), cranial
(e.g., architecture, supra-orbital ridges, mastoid processes,
etc.), and long bone (e.g., robusticity, femoral head diameter,
etc.) charact~ristics .. Sexing of SUb-adults (under 20 years of
age) is difficult prior to puberty, unless pelvic elements are
available (see Krogman 1962). When prese,nt, pubic symphyses were
used to age adult skeletons. More often~ however, we had to
rely on cranial suture closure and dental attrition (see below).
Infants, children and teen-agers, i .e.,sub-adults, were aged by
degree of dental development and epiphyseal union.
Evaluation of dental materials was limited to individuals 10
years of age and older. Single isolated teeth were recorded but
not tabulated, whereas dental arcades of loose teeth were re­
constructed and included 1n the analysis. Tooth-by-tooth
records of caries and abscesses were noted and then combined to

single scores to reduce the complexity of summary tables. The
reported score is the number of individuals in this study sample
who exhibited caries or abscesses.
Dental attrition was scored on a scale modified from
Brothwell (1972) and comparable to Smith (1972) (although plus
and minus categories were not used):

All teeth present in each feature were scored. The analysis,
however, is limited to values for maxillary left Ml, M2, and M3.
Individuals missing o~e or more of these teeth had a score
substituted from the other side, or from the mandible (with
preference given to the left side). If an appropriate tooth
was not represented, no score (a missing value) was computed.
Mean values reported in the summary tables represent an average
nonmissing value for that tooth.
Tooth loss was recorded where sockets exhibited bone
alterations indicating loss before death. Post mortem loss was
treated as missing values.
Demographic Characteristics: Age and Sex Distribution
Two obvious and important questions that must be treated in
any cemetery ~eport are how many persons, and what age-sex
categories, are represented? An easy answer to the first
question is acquired by the archeologist in the field. At the
Ernest Witte site 215 (221 less 6 completely destroyed during
machinery excavation) features and at the Leonard K site six
features are designated burials. In addition, a number of
features from the Ernest Witte site could not be definitely
assigned as to group. Some features, however., represnt more
than one individual. For example, a feature which contains two
left calcanea can safely be tabulated as two individuals.
Sometimes the duplication is less conspicuous; nevertheless,
recognition of both old and young. large and small, or male and
female materials may alert the osteologist that multiple

APPENDIX I

327

individuals are present. In this report, the number, age, and
sex designations are the minimum required to account for the
observed materials for each feature. One could extend the
simple application of this logic to arrive at a minimum number
of persons for the site. In this example, it wo~ld be the
number of left calcanea reported for the entire site. Such a
figure is not usually desirable, since, like the archeologist's
features, it does not represent most of the available evidence.
It would provide, however, a minimum age-sex description not
available from the archeologist's burial count.
The nature of the site greatly affects interpretation of
skeletal and dental materials. The archeologist's burial count
would be a good estimate in mass burials where all members are
simultaneously interred. It is also a good measure in cemeteries
with systematic burial plots that insure that each new addition
is placed in undisturbed soil. However, in the present sites,
younger burial pits and animal burrows crosscut older pits.
Absence of soil contrasts to identify pit outlines contributes
to the difficulty of recognizing proveniences of disarticulated
and mixed materials. In practical terms this means that a
feature-by-feature or burial-by-burial tabulation over-represents
those individuals whose disarticulated bones are associated with
several younger burials. The "overcount" is a reflection of the
degree of site disturbance. Since the features are confined to
a small area, and since both vertical and horizontal mixing
could occur, the ·logistics of matching an extra left calcaneous
with one of many burials lacking left calcanea is problematical.
A total of 345 individuals is estimated in all the avail­
able skeletal and dental materials from the Ernest Witte and
Leonard K sites. This is probably an overestimate, as a number
of individuals are represented by a single bone or by only
several skeletal elements. These elements, in turn, can
possibly represent the same individual, whose remains have been
distributed through several features in the sites.
The number of individuals in each group at the Ernest Witte
site and in the Leonard K site, and the age and sex distribution
in each group and site are shown in Table 1. Groups 1 and 2 of
the Ernest Witte site include 84.3% of all individuals
represented, 19.7% in the former and 64.6% in the latter.
Groups 3 and 4 of the Ernest Witte site, the uncertain burials
in the Ernest Witte site, and the Leonard K site account for
only 15.7% of the total number of individuals represented in
the skeletal population.
Age at the time of death ranges from infancy (under one
year of age} to adults 9reater than 50 years (Table I-l}.
Distribution of adults{> 20 years} and sub-adults «20 years)
within each group are sh~w~ in Table 1-2. Comparative data for
other skeletal populations and modern groups are also included
in the table. It should be noted at the outset that the number
of individuals represented in each group at the Ernest Witte
site and in the Leonard K site is very small, except for

ALLENS CREEK

328

Groups 1 and 2, in the Ernest Witte site. In general, and with
the exception of Group 3, sub-adults have a relatively small
representation in both sites. This may be due especially to
the greater chance of disintegration of infant and early
childhood skeletons (0-5 years of age) in the course of time.
More detailed consi4erations of age-specific distributions in
Groups 1 and 2 will be considered later in the report.

The range of ages at the time of death for individuals at
the Ernest Witte and Leonard K sites suggests that interment was
not an age-specific practice. Since practically all ages are
represented (with the possible exception of infants and young
children in the small sample of Group 4 of the Ernest Witte
site}, it can perhaps be inferred that age at the time of death
was evidently not always a determining factor governing inter­
ment in the cemetery.

Distribution of adults by sex within each group and site,
and comparative sex ratios for other Amerindian adult skeletal
populations are shown in Table 1-3. Analysis of the data by
sex is limited to adults since. as indicated earlier, determin­
ation of sex of prepubertal skeletal materj11 is problematica)
(see also Krogman 1962). Groups 1, 2 and 4 of the Ernest Witte
site and the Leonard K site have an excess of males. Sampling
variation in the sma11 samples of Groups 3 and 4 and in the
Leonard K site must be carefully noted. The relative incidence
of males (about 46.5%) and females (about 53.5%) in Groups 1
and 2 of the EMnest Witte site are contrary to sex ratios
commonly reported for most other Amerindian skeletal (Table 3)
and other skeletal populations (Weiss 1972). Weiss (1972),
however, suggests that there is a systematic bias (about 12%
in favor of males) in the sexing of adult skeletal materials.
This conclusion is based on a large series of sexed adult
~keletal populations and a series of live adult preindustrial
populations. Whether such a bias is present in the adult
skeletal population of the Ernest Witte and Leonard K sites is
not known. The co-authors independently determined the sex of
most individuals represented in the present series of skeletal
materials, and only conferred in cases'difficult to determine.

330

Results were pooled for the analysis. Nevertheless, the sex
ratios of adults 1n Groups 1 and 2 Of the Ernest Witte site
(about 46.5% male) are reasonably close to those observed in
live pre-industiral populations, for whom Weiss (1972) reports
an unweighted average sex ratio of 48.8% males over 31 live
populations. The unweighted average sex ratio for eight live
Amerindian populations, estimated from Weiss'data, is 48%
males, w.ith a range of 41% to 55%.

Since males, generally experience, greater morbidity and
mortality rates than females in most modern populations, the
data for Groups 1 and 2 of the Ernest Witte site were further
analyzed relative to sex ratios for specific age groups (Table
4). The lower ratio of males 1n Group 2 for the younger age
groups would imply that females experienced greater mortality at
these ages. At the oldest age, the ratio increases slightly for
Group 2 males. Note th..at the sex ratio for adults for whom age
could not be determined is tntermediat~ between 20 - 30 years

and> 30 years age groups. It should also be noted that at all
ages~(except for the small sample in the 20 - 30 years category
in Group 1} fewer males are represented in the Ernest Witte
site skeletal population. This might be related to higher
infant and early childhood mortality rates for males, but data
for skeletal remains of young individuals do not permit an
evaluation of this possibility. Nevertheless, males under five
years of age generally have higher mortality rates than females
1n modern populations. especially in developing countries
(Jell; ffe 1966).

d Adapted from Weiss (1972)

Although the relative sex ratios for Group 2 of the Ernest
Witte site are not directly comparable to all Amerindian
skeletal data shown in Table 4, they are generally consistent
with the Indian Knoll and Early Texas Indian data showing an
increase in the percentage of males with increasing age. Both
the Indian Knoll and Early Texas data have, however., a consis­
tently greater percentage of males in the oldest categories.
Weiss (1972) reported an unwetghted average of 52.6% males
for younger adults (approximately 15 • 30 years) and an un­
weighted average of 59.7% males for older adults (over 30 years)
in 16 skeletal populations. When corrected for an estimated 12%

332

ALLENS CREEK

bias favoring males in adult skeletal popuiations, Weiss'
(1972) estimate of age-specific sex ratios is reduced to 47%
males under 30 years of age and 52% males over 30 years of age.
In contrast, the unweighted average sex ratios of younger and
older adults in 22 living preindustrial populations are SOX
males in the former and 49.1% males in the latter (Weiss 1972).
Six Amerindian populations included among the 22 live pop­
ulations have an unweighted average sex ratio of 47.5% males
for y~unger adults and 48.2% males for older adults. Thus, th£
sex ratio data for living preindustrial populations are not
consistent with that for skeletal populations, although the
ratios for the skeletal populations of Groups 1 and 2 of the
Ernest Witte site appear to approach the live Amerindian
populations somewhat more ~10se1y.
Death ratios in infancy (0 - 1 year) and early childhood
(1 - 4 years) are generally viewed as indicators of the health
and nutritional status of a community (Jel1iffe 1966). The
application of this generalization to skeletal populations is
complicated by the greater chance of disintegration of especially
infant skeletons in the course of time due to detrimental soil
conditions. With this limitation in perspective, early child­
hood data are shown in Table 5 for Groups 1 and 2 of the Ernest
Witte site compared to data for Early Texas Indians and Indian
Knoll. As a percentage of the total population, figures for
chi1d~en 0 - 4 years of age for all Amerindian skeletal
populations are considerably lower than those observed in live
populations of rural Mexico and Guatemala, which is about 48%
(Malina and Himes 1977). One can inquire, therefore, whether
younger individuals were buried away from the usual interment
area or perhaps selectively eliminated due to soil conditions
of the burial environment.

The dental sample presents a more conservative estimate of
the site demog~aphy. Only 190 individuals 10 years of age and
older are dentally represented in the Ernest Kitte and leonard K
sites-CTab1e 6}. The in aitu mandible and maxilla represent
smaller targets to excavation, and as such are less altered by
burial practices. The numerical divergence between the site
demography based only on dental arches (190) and on skeletal
and/or dental elements (2g9) may provide a useful measure of
site disturbance and mixing of other skeletal elements, although
tnis idea is somewhat 1 im-ited. Fifty-two of the 215 features
recogniz~d by the archeol~gtst at the Ernest Witte site had bone
materials present, but no dental structures (jaws or teeth). It
is interesting to note tftat tnts more conservative dental
estimate of Individuals results In no changes whatsoever 1n the
adult sex ratio estimates from those samp1es which are large
enough to be meaningful CTable 7; see also TaDle 3). This lack
of difference between the two approaches implies that the
agencies of over-representation (burial practices that disturb
context, archeological error, identification error} are either
(1) random with respect to the sex of the specimens, or (2)
subject to the same sampling and identification biases with
"respect to sex of the specimen. The latter is the more comfor­
tahle deduction. It should be noted that sex identification of
dentition was not made separately from the other skeletal
e 1 em e nt s, but wa s ass i 9ned aft era . sur v ey 0 fall mat e ria 1 s t hat

The number of features reported by the archeologist should
be a reasonable count of undisturbed or partially disturbed
individuals. This estimate is more reliable if we exclude forty­

analysts we also omitted individuals fro~ the leonard K site. A
comparison of the estimated number of individuals ov~r 10 years
of age in the Ernest Witte lite by various approaches is shown
in Table 8. There is good agreement between the dental estimate
t185) and the archeologist's tally (215) of features. There is
still an error of over-representation (9.3%) where the maxilla
of an individual may be separated from its mandible. If the
archeologist's feature count is a realistic tabulation, then at
least 26.4% of the individuals are represented in two or more
features. The overcount is recognizable in only 9.3% of the
features when tabulated by dental arcades only.

Two processes contribute to the divergence of counts. The
first is differential preservation. For whatever reason, some
individuals are represented by only a few skeletal and/or dental
elements. Several of tnes.e individuals may be present in a
"feature" such as a cremation. The state of preservation of
tne materials at this site is very poor, with most feataures
containing only fragmentary remains. The ~econd process is site
disturbance, where several individuals are partially mixed. Both
processes are important at this site. Bone counts are inherent

able through preservation, excavation, and identification.
Long Bone Lengths and Stature Estimates
As indicated at the outset, the skeletal materials for the
Ernest Witte and Leonard K sties were highly fragmented and in
a poor state of preservation so that lengths could be measured
for only a relatively small number of individuals (Table 9).
Sixteen individuals are represented among the 26 long bones
suitable for measurement. Long bone lengths for the ten males
fall well within the range for Texas Indians in general as well
as for the smaller coastal series of Texas Indians reported by
Doran (1974). The bone lengths for the six females appear some­
what shorter than the averages reported by Doran (1974), but are
within the range of variation observed in Texas Indians. Al­
though numbers are small, there does not appear to be any
appreciable size difference between the different levels of the
Ernest Witte site anu the Leonard K site.

The utility of stature reconstruction frQm10ng bone lengths
for earlier human populations is questionable, in light of (I) the
complexity of genetic and environmental factors capable of 1n­
f1uencing the growth of a long bone' and other skeletal elements
contri6uttng to stature, and (2) population differences 1n bodily
proportions (see Huber 1968). Nevertheless, stature estimates
provide an approximate estimate of body size and are commonly
reported in analyses of .ske1eta1 populations. Table 10 presents
the stature estimates for individuals in the Ernest Witte site.
The estimates are derived from the table of expected maximum
statures reported by Genoves (1967) for Mesoamericans. When
several long bones for a single individual were present, an
average of the expected maximum statures was used. Comparative
data for the Texas Indians (Doran 1974) are also included in
Table 10. Numbers are too small to permit comparisons between
groups and sites, although the est1mated statures for the six
males in Group 2 of the Ernest Witte site are greater than the

four males represented. Statures for the four Group 2 females
are greater that the estimated stature for the single Group 1
female, though shorter than that for the female unidentified as
to group in the Ernest Witte site.
The average stature for the ten males is 167.9 cm. with a
range from 163.3 to 175.5 cm. This distribution overlaps that
for other Texas Indians, but the mean is slightly greater than
the estimates reported by Doran (1974). The average stature
for six females is 153.5 cm., which is shorter than the estimate
reported hy Doran for other Te~as Indians. Estimated statures
for only two of the six females represented in the Ernest Witte
site exceed those reported by Doran for the Texas Indian females.
It is not clear why the small sample of females is shorter
than other Texas Indian females. while the small sam~le of males
is taller than other Texas Indian males. Sample variation is
probably the significant factor, as girls are generally less
susceptible to growth-stunting influences than boys (Tanner 1962).
Thus, for equivalent levels of malnutrition, for example, females
are generally less growth-stunted than males.
Skeletal Pathology
Pathologies are limited indicators of the health status of
skeletal populations since only those conditions affecting the
skeleton are apparent. Further, some skeletal pathologies, e.g.,
arthritic lipping, represent to some extent the concomitants of
normal aging processes.
Th~ distributions of skeletal-pathologies in the differeftt
groups at the Ernest Witte site and in the Leonard K site jpe
shown in Table 11. Across all groups and both sites, 114
individuals (33%) showed some evidence of skeletal pathology.
Six of the.eight individuals in the Leonard K site had evidence
of skeletal pathologies, while only one of fourteen individuals
in Group 4 of the Ernest Witte site had skeletal pathology. Most
pathologies are concentrated in Groups 1 and 2 of the Ernest
Witte site (88%), which also have the greatest number of indiTABLE 1·11.

viduals represented (see Table I-l1)~ On a relative basis, 23.51
of the individuals in Group 1 and 35.4% of those in Group 2 had
some evidence of skeletal pathology.
With the exception of three individuals in Group 2 of the
Ernest Witte site, all pathologies were limited to adults. Hence,
the relative incidence of pathologies in adults is shown in
Table 1-12 with comparative data for other Amerindian skeletal
populations. Group 3 of the Ernest Witte site and the Leonard K
site both have a high incidence of adult pathologies in very
small samples. The relative incidence of pathologies in Groups
land 2 are quite comparable to data for other Texas Indian
skeletal populations.
Three types of skeletal pathologies were most prevalent in
the materials from the Ernest Witte and leonard K sites: (1)
arthritic lipping of vertebrae and joint surfaces of long bones
(Fig. 1-1); (2) ulcerous lesions, especially on the shafts of
long bones (Fig. 1-2); and (3) cortical thickening or periosteal
swelling of long bone shafts (Fig. 1-3). The first condition
may represent, to some extent, the concomitants of normal aging,
as well as "wear and tear" effects on the skeleton. The other
two pathologies represent infectious conditions. In addition to
the above, several fractures and exostoses were evident in the
skeletal materials.
Only Group 2 of the Ernest Witte site had a sufficient
number of individuals for an aga-. sex- and pathology-specific
analysis. Such an analysis is reported subsequently, after a
brief consideration of pathologies in the other groups at the
Ernest Witte site and in the Leonard K site.

There were nine inst~nces of arthritic involvement in the
vertebrae, six instances in the upper extremity (especially the
elbow joint) and three instances in the lower extremity (the·
ankle). Three of the 14 individuals had multiple arthritic
involvement in the vertebrae, upper extremities and/or lower
extremities'.
(2) Ernest Witte, Group 3: Five (all male) of the six adult
pathologies involved arthritic changes rather evenly distributed
among the vertebrae and the upper and lower extremities. Two
males (both in the 20-40 years age category) with evidence of
arthritic changes also had evidence of' fractures of the upper
extremity. The sixth pathology was an upper extremity fracture
in a female (20-40 years age category).
(3) Ernest Witte, Gr~up4: . The single pathology (one among
12 adults) in this group involved ulcerous lesions of the upper
and lower extremities in an adult male over 40 years of age.
(4) Ernest Witte, Group Uncertain: Four of the six patho­
logies involved arthritic ~hanges. One individual (female, 20­
40 years age category) had evidence of a fracture, while another
(female, age uncertain) had evidence of ulcerous lesions of the
humerus.
(5) Leonard K site: Six of seven adults (five males, one
unidentified as to sex) in the site had skeletal pathologies.
Four of the six had arthritic involvement, while two of those
with arthritic changes and the remaining two without arthritic
involvement had extensive ulcerous lesions of both the upper and
lower extremities. In one individual the skull was also in­
volved. The pathological coritext of this small site may possibly
suggest a special burial area for infectious disease victims.

The distribution of skel~tal pathologies in Group 2 of the

(6.1%) sub-adults had evidence of pathology. This low incidence
of pathology in sub-adults is in accord with other skeletal
populat10ri data. Aten and others (1976) found no pathologies
1n nine sub-adults at the Harris County Boys School Site, and
Roney (1959) reported no patbological findings among 117 sub­

adults from a California Indian site. Goldstein (1957) observed
only two post-cranial skeletal pathologies among 33 (6.6%) Texas
Indian skeletons under 18 years of age. By contrast, 13 of 73
CI7.8%} sub-adults in Goldstein's Texas Indian series had
evidence of cranial osteoporosis (15.1%) and cranial inflam­
matory lesions (2.7%). The three post-cranial pathologies
observed in Group 2 of the Ernest Witte site occurred in juveniles
10 to 20 years of age (sex undetermined), and included an upper
extremity and skull fracture, ulcerous lesions of the lower
extremity, and periosteal swelling of the lower extremity.
Among 174 adults represented in Group 2 of the Ernest Witte
site, 76 l43.7%} showed evidence of skeletal pathology. This
percentage compares favorably to that observed .in the smaller
Harris County Boys School adult population (30.4%} reported by
Aten and others (1976) and the larger adult Texas Indian
population (39.7% post-cranial; 3d.5% cranial) reported by
Goldstein (1957).
Relative age- and sex-specific distribution of pathologies
in adults of Group 2 in the Erne~t Witte site are shown in Table
14. Patholo~ies were more common in older individuals (over 40
years of age), while the relative incidence in adults for whom
age could not be determined was essentially the same as in
younger adults (20-40 years). Within the you~ger and older adult
cat~gories, females showed a greater incidenc~ of skeletal
pathologies, while males predominate among pathologies in adults
for whom age could not be determined.

individuals (Table I-IS). The degree of arthritic involvement
(i.e., mild, moderate, severe), however, was variable. Of those
with arthritic changes, 44 (75.9%) showed arthritic involvement
only. The remaining 14 individuals had arthritic involvement
in conjunction with other pathological changes, most commonly
ulcerous lesions of the long bones, cortical thickening or perio­
steal swelling of the long bones, and exostoses. The 58 indi­
viduals with arthritic changes showed 78 arthritic involvements:

33 in the upper extremity {most commonly the elbow joint}, 26 in
the lower extremity (most commonly the ankle), and 19 in the

age from younger adults (16 or 27.6%) to older adults (27 or
46.6%1. Arthritic changes were also evident in 15 (25.9%) adults
for whom an age could not be assigned. , The younger adults ac­
counted for 19 (24.4%) of the 78 arthritic inv01vements, while
the older adults accounted for 42 (53.8%) of the arthritic in­

occurred in individuals for whom an age could not be assigned.
Among all adults, males accounted for 50% of the individuals
with arthritic ~hanges, while females accounted for 43.1%. Four
adults (6.9%) with arthritic changes were unidentified as to sex.
Males also accounted for a greater percentage of the observed
arthritic involvement (51.3%) than females (42.3%). The sex
difference in arthritic involvement was more apparent in the
vertebrae and the lower extremity than in the upper extremity.
It should be noted that the prevalence of osteoarthritis in
living Amerindians is high compared to the general United States
population, and among Indians its prevalence is greater in males
{74%} than in females (58%). The prevalence of osteoarthritis
in the general United States population is 37% in males and
females (Goldstein 1969).
Ulcerous lesions are evident in 12 individuals in Group 2
of the Ernest Witte site (Table 1-161. Of these, five individuals
had ulcerous lesions only, and seven had l~sions in conjunction
with arthritic changes and/or other pathological conditions.
One individual had ulcerous lesions in association with an
unusually thickened skull. 'The ulcerous lesions occurred most
commonly in the lower extremity (7 of 13 observed invo1vements1,
f 0 11 0wed by the u p per ext rem i t Y C4 i nvol v em e n t s tan d sku 1 1 (2
involvements). The lesions also occurred in twice as many
adult females (8) as males (4), and most commonly in the older
adult category (7; 2 males,S females}.
Cortical thickening and/or periosteal swelling occurred in
14 individuals represented in Group 2 of the Ernest Witte site
CTab1e I-17}. Eight of the 14 adults showed only cortical
thickening, while five showed it'in association with arthritic
changes and one in association with a fracture. Ten of the 14
observed cortical thickening involvements were evident in the
lower extremity. The prevalence of cortical thickening was
evenly distributed between tne sexes, but was more evident in
younger adults {6 of I4}.
In addition to the three major categories of skeletal
pathology described above, several others occurred. Six adults
(two males, four fema1esl had exostoses, primarily on the lower
extremity. All individuals with exostoses also had arthritic
involvement. There were two fractures, both in males of un­
determined age. One involved the upper extremity and th~ other

346

ALLENS CREEK

the lower extremity. One individual (age and sex undeterminedl
had evidence of osteomyelitis, and a female (age undetermined)
had ext~nsive erosion of the pubic symphysis in association
with marked lipping.
.
.
The 76 aduits with skeletal pathologies in Group 2 of the
Ernest Witte site include 60 (83.3%) with singe pathological
changes (44 with arthritic lipping only,S with ulcerous lesions
only, 8 with cortical thickening only, and one each with a
fracture, osteomyelitis, and erosion of th pubic symphysis).
The remaining 1& individuals had multiple pathological involve­
ment, most commonly arthritic changes in association with
another condition.
It is difficult to offer.acomparative perspective for
specific patho10~ies in skeletal populitions as there is consid­
erable variation in the classification of such pathologies.
In summary, the health of the population represented in the
Ernest Witte and leonard K sites, as reflected in skeletal
pathologies, is generally good. Across both sites, 114 of 345
individuals represented (33%) showed evidence of some skeletal
pathology. Thus, 67% of the individuals showed no sign of
pathology or abnormality. Note, however, some pathological
conditions may not have been recognized by the authors in the
course of ana1~zing the highly fragmented materials.
Evidence for disease in the skeleton occurred most often in
the post-cranial skeleton. The most commonly observed pathology
involved arthritic changes, which ranged from mild to severe
lipping. The functional significance of such pathological in­
volvement should be constd~red, as many mild or moderate forms
were probably not disabling. The same can be said for cases of
cortical thickening and/or periosteal swelling.
Similar ulcerous lesions o-f the long bones occ·urred in a
number of individuals (all except one were adults) in both the
Ernest Witte and leonard K sites. The cause and significance of
such inflammatory lesions, a few of which penetrated the marrow
cavity, are not known.
Dental Attrition and Pathology
The age and sex distribution of dental attrition and path­
ology in the Ernest Witte and leonard K sites are shown in Table
1-18. little difference is apparent between Group 1 and 2 in
the Ernest Witte site. The most important feature in the
dentation is tooth wear. As the wear progresses into the tooth,
the exposed pulp surface hardens to dentine (Blumberg and others
1971). In older adults, Ml is worn to the neck or root of the
tooth (attrition score 5 or 6). Attrition rates for M2 and M3
are progressively less due to the age of eruption and position
in the dental arcade (attrition score 3 to 5). This rate of

-

APPENDIX I

347

tooth wear Is characteristic of man~ Amerfnidan samples (Bram­
blett 1968; Molnar 1971). There Is further very little sex
difference in rate of wear.
The rapid rate of dental attrition affects the other
features of dental pathology. It accounts for the rate of tooth
loss: almost 391 of individua1~ 20 years of age and older have
lost one or more teeth before death. Dental attrition also
contributes to frequent abscesses, which are present in 371 of
the adults. Abscesses frequently occur in association with pulp
exposure by attrition CGreene et al., 1967), and abscesses are
often detectable after the tooth remnant is lost and alveolar
healing has begun. These processes are progressive with age, '
but seem consistent for both sexes and all groups and both sites.
Caries are less important. They are not age correlated and
only about one-fifth (22%) of the adults exhibit them. This
is a high rate of caries since extremely abrasive diets pre­
sumably wear away the fissures where caries begin (St. ~o¥me and
Kor1tzer 1976).
.
Dental pathologies provide very limited kinds of information
about prehistoric diets. For example, Angel (1976) found that
tooth wear and abscesses decreased, cavities and tooth loss
increas~d, and periodontal disease remained about the same be­
tween colonial and modern times in the United States. The
present sample has a rate of wear found only with extremely
abrasive diets. The rate of caries is high enough to suggest
substantial use of carbohydrates. However, one must remember
that variants In the chemical constituents of the enamel that
reflect soil minerals or solutes in drinking water could contri­
bute both to wear and caries (St. Hoyme and Koritzer 1976).

COMPILATION OF BURIAL DATA
Grant D. Hatt

The following tables and lists present in summary form all
of the data available for burials recovered at 41 AU 36 and
41 AU 37.
In the tables of general burial data, the following
information is given:
Burial Number - a sequential number from 1 to 227 assigned to
each burial as it was exposed at the site, followed by as many
as four letters (A-D) indicating the number of individuals
represented by the burial, if greater than one;
Group - the number of the burial group to which the burial
belongs or a question mark (1) if burial group affiliation could
not be determined;
Age - the age of the individual utilizing the abbreviations OA
(old adult - 50 + years), MA (middle adult - 35-50 years), VA
(young adult - 20-35 years), AD (adult - age undetermined). A
(adolescent - 12-20 years), C (child - 1-12 years), I (infant ­
up to one year), F (fetal-neonatal), and question mark (1 ­
age undetermined);
Sex - the sex of the individual utilizing the abbreviations M
(male), F (female), and question mark (? - undetermined);
Orientation (after Aten and others 1976) - a degree reading on
the direction in which the skull lies as determined by placing
the correctly oriented skeleton at the center of an imaginary
360 0 circle (with magnetic north being 0°) and projecting a line
between the center of the pelvis and the skull/spine juncture to
the circumference of the circle (magnetic declination from
true north in the area was 8~0 east of north as of 1960);
Average Elevation - an average of the highest and lowest ele­
vations on the burial in meters above the primary vertical
datum;
Grid Coordinates - north and west grid coordinates calculated
for points at the skull/spine juncture (neck) and bottom center
of the pelvis for articulated skeletons or, in the case of
disarticulated masses, bundle burials, and cremations, two
points on the edge of the bone group at the greatest possible
distance from one another without regard to orientation;

356

ALLENS CREEK

Form of Disposal - either simple inhumation (51), meaning
burial of the f1eshed~ articulated body below ground, or
compound (C). meaning disarticulation and/or cremation prior to
burial below ground;
General Arrangement - overall position of the remains, extended
(E), semi-flexed (5), and flexed (F) for articulated simple
inhumations, bundle (B) and cremation (C) for compound forms of
disposal, and mass (M) for amorphous bone groups;
Deposition - for articulated skeletons only, whether the body
was placed in the grave on its back (B), face (F). left side (l),
or right side (R);
Skull Position - for articulated skeletons only, whether th~
skull lay on its back {Bl, face (F), left side (l), or right
side (R);
Direction looking - for articulated skeletons having skulls
positioned on either the left or the right side only. a degree
reading on the direction in which the skull is "looking" as
determined by placing the skull of the correctly
oriented
skeleton at the center of an imaginary 360 0 circle (with
magnetic north being 0°) and projecting a line between the area
of the lambda angle of the pariental bone and the center of
the eye orbitals to the circumference of the circle;
Right Arm Position - the arrangement of the arm such as ex­
tended parallel to torso (EPT), across pelvis (AP), folded on
chest (FC), or hand to face (HF), and, additionally. collapsed
left (Cl) or collapsed right (CR), usually to describe flexed
burials resting on their sides with one limb superimposed over
the other;
left Arm Position - same as for right arm;
Right leg Position - the arrangement of the leg such as ex­
tended alongside the opposite leg (ES), extended with ankle
crossing the opposite ankle (EC), flexed (F), or semi-flexed (5),
and, additionally, collapsed left (Cl) or collapsed right (CR),
usually to describe flexed burials resting on their sides with
one limb superimposed over the other;
left leg Position - same as for

~ight

leg.

Many of the categories used in the following tables were
adapted from Sprague's "A Sug~ested Terminology and Classifica­
tion for Burial Description" (1968) and elaborated by Aten and
others 1976. Sex and age data were drawn from the laboratory
record sheets produced by Malina and Bramblett during their
analysis of the skeletal remains (Appendix I).

The following brief notes on certain of the burials
recovered at 41 AU 36 include items of information which
could not be conveniently summarized in the preceeding data
tables.

B-2b: Represented by only two bones, this fetal individual was
not recognized by the archeologists as it was being removed with
B-2a. Though B-2a is identified as a male in his late 20's, the
occurrence of the fetus along with the 2a remains would suggest
that the individual may ins~ead have been a pregnant female.
B-4: This deposit of bone is believed to represent skeletal
elements of individuals disinterred and subsequently reburied
by the discoverer of the site, Ernest Witte.
B-5: Destroyed during bulldozer excavation. Horizontal and
vertical provenience recorded but no skeletal remains were
collected.
B-6: Destroyed during bulldozer excavation. Horizontal and
vertical provenience recorded but no skeletal remains were
collected.
B-7: Skeleton from pelvis to skull destroyed during bulldozer
excavation. Legs were severely deformed by periostial swelling.
Position of leg bones immediately above B-10 suggests that the
two individuals were buried simultaneously.
8-8: Burial represents a set of legs destroyed during bull­
dozer excavation and not collected. B-109 was later aSSigned
to the upper body, the skeletal elements of which were collected.
B-9: Destroyed during bulldozer eKcavation. Horizontal and
vertical provenience recorded but no skeletal remains were
collected.
B-l1: Lower body disturbed during bulldozer excavation and not
collected.
B-12: Burial represented by skull only. Post-cranial elements
destroyed during bulldozer excavation and not collected.
B-13: Represented by skull, rib, and arm bone fragments only.
Other elements were destroyed during bulldozer excavation and
were not collected. Found in association were a boatstone, a
shell pendant, and some incised bone artifacts. Area was so
badly disrupted that precise relationships between artifacts and
skeleton could not be determined.

B-14: Lower halves of tibiae and fibulae and feet disrupted
during bulldozer excavation. These elements were not collected.
B-15: Intrudes B-19(?) and 8-24.

Interred simultaneously with B-18.

B-16b: The juvenile bones constituting this individual (frag­
ments of humerus and femur) were not recognized by the archeo­
logists as they were removed along with B-16a. These bones may
actually represent B-23 which was intruded by interment of
B-16a and B-18.
8-17: Represents skull of B-24. separated from rest of skeleton
by intrusion of B-15.
8-18: Intrudes B-23. Several freshwater mussel shells noticed
along right lower arm. Association with burial is questionable.
6-19: Elements representing B-23 or B-30 were collected along
with 8-19.
'
B-20: Condition poor. Right half of upper body and all of
lower body completely decomposed. Interred simultaneously with
B- 21 .
B-21: Condition poor. Burial represented by a skull and frag­
ments of arm. leg, and foot bones only. Remaining elements
apparently decomposed.
B-22: Intruded feet of B-35.
a restrictively small grave.

Burial was apparently placed in

B-24: Intruded by B-15 and B-22 (skull) and possibly B-37
and B-38 (feet).
B-26: Post-dates B-35. Collected along with B-26 were elements
representing B-29 or B-121 and B-35.
B-27:

Post-dates B-37 and B-38.

B-28a: Left hand, portions of ri~ht shoulder, and skull were
removed during excavation of Backhoe Trench 2, but were collect­
ed.
B-28b: The remains of this juvenile were not recognized as
constituting an additional individual as B-28a was collected
in the field. Along with female 28a. may constitute a mother­
child burial.

8-32: Skull, several vertebra~~ scapula, and humerus fragment
were only elements of skeleton collected. Remainder was
destroyed during bulldozer' excavation.
8-33:

Intruded by 8-22 and 8-188.

8-34: Intrudes 8-40. Skeleton was inclined with the feet
about 40 cm. higher than t~e skull. Mussel shell ornament
(unique for site) found under skull.
8-36a: Lower body destroyed during bulldozer excavation and not
collected.
8-36b: The long bone shafts of this juvenile may go with B-126
to form one individual. The area containing B-36b and B-126
was badly disturbed during machinery excavation.
B-37:

Buried with, or possibly prior

to~

B-38.

8-38: Some elements representing B-27 and B-37 were collected
along with 8-38.
8-40:

Intruded by B-34 and possibly B-4l.

B43b: This burial is represented by a group of long bones found
near B-43a. An individual highly disturbed by insect/rodent
activity is apparently represented.

B-50b: Burial is represented only by an extra tibia collected
along with B-50a. Rather than an additional individual, the
tibia might belong to B-42, 8-51, or 8-59.
8-54: Of four cremations at site, this was the most completely
burned example. Few bf the bone fragments wer~ greater than

complete individual. Apparently interred simultaneously with
B-172~ B-173~ and possibly B-93 (bundle).
The feet of B-92
protruded into B-93. The feet of B-172 touched the skull of
B-92. The feet of 8-173 touched the skull of 8-172 (see Fig.
11 ) .

B-95: Though a cremation~ burning did not result in complete
fragmentation of skeletal elements as in 8-54. Skull fragments,
femurs, and some vertebrae were still recognizable, but not in
articulated position.
8-96: Apparently interred simultaneously with B-98. Seems to
have intruded 8-97 and 8-99 represented by skulls found in the

B-97: Female skeletal elements collected with B-97 belong to
B-98 or B-99.
B-98b: Remains of this individual were not recognized as they
were collected along with B-98a by the archeologists. The
presence of two individuals in the burial was determined by the
physical anthropologists during laboratory examination. This
individual was also intruded by 8-128.
B-99b: Remains of this female were intruded by B-99a. 80th
were collected together. Only B-99a was recognized in the
field.

Intrudes B-171b, both collected together.

B-172: See 8-92 discussion. B-172 is underlain by B-202
which seems to be an older interment. Off the left side of
B-172 were the remains of infant B-181, possibly belonging
with B-172. An unnumbered skull was found above the right
elbow of 8-172. It probably represents a burial intruded by
interment of 6-172. Juvenile bones represent B-1811

Missing elements probably scattered by insect activity,
8-215: In a manner unlike any other skeleton recovered from
the site, the well-articulated bones of this individual were
blackened, as if burned. The blackening was most intense on
the frontal portions of the skull, vertebrae, left radius and
ulna, ribs, pelvis, and right hand. Colored to a lesser extent
were the femurs, back of skull t left scapula, ribs, right radius
and ulna. left clavicle, right and left tibias, and right
fibula. The bones of the feet showed no color alteration.
There were no indications of a hearth or other burned area in
close proximity to the skeleton. Though it is suspected that
the color alterations seen on the skeleton were fire-induced.
the cause was not definitely established.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF BURIAL DATA
SoZveig Turpin

Introduction
The statistical analysis of the burial data from the
Ernest Witte Site had two objectives. Descriptive statistics
were computed to concisely summarize the data and present it
in numerical terms. Inferential statistics were employed to
look for meaningful relationships between the selected attri­
butes that could contribute to an interpretation and under­
standing of the cultural processes that influences these
relationships.
Depending on the goal of the particular analysis being
performed, the population was variously considered to be: (1)
all burials in the cemetery, (2) all burials within one group,
or (3) all burials exhibiting a selected variable such as the
presence of artifacts. The cases were the individual burials.
Information from burial data tables (Appendix II) was recorded
in three ways: .grid coordinates and average elevation were
linear; body arrangement, sex and form of disposal were in
presence-absence form; and the stratigraphic 1 evel, age,
orientation and direction looking were both nominal and scaled
i nth e sen set hat dis c ret e cat ego r i e s we'r e ass i g ned a n umer i cal
value that corresponded to a linear segment of the data. For
example, orientaSion and direction looking were divided into
eight arcs of 45 , and age was divided into eight classes from
old adult to fetal. Presence-absence of artifact categories
was selected for artifact coding to avoid weighting the data in
favor of strings of shell beads or multiple fragments of mis­
cellaneous bone. While this manner of coding is inherently
reversible - that is, gives absence a v~lue it may not have ­
and gives equal weight to all attributes regardless of value,
the presence of the artifact category was considered to be the
most meaningful. Artifacts were coded into variables as shown
in the lists of artifact associations (Appendix II). The
transformational capability of the computer was used to convert
variables to comparative classes - that is, nominal to presence­
absence - or to sum and recode the variables when deemed
appropriate to the statistical procedure being employed.
Descriptive Statistics
Frequencies were calculated to assess the distribution of
variables within the population as a whole. Variables were
reviewed in the light of their distribution and were either

398

ALLENS CREEK

eliminated due to scarcity or summed into more comprehensive
variables; for instance, "shell pendants, forms 1 through 14"
were summed into a composite variable, "shell pendant."
Cases (individual burials) were eliminated from further
computations if the proportion of missing data was too high.
These were in fact the burials where only the north and west
coordinates were available. The data was not expected to, nor
did it, reveal a normal distribution.
Contingency table analysis (Nie and others 1975) was
used to produce tables of the various compositional parts of
the populations such as age/sex ratios. The reader should
view these attribute distributions as percentages of the rep­
resented cases rather than as frequencies. Because of the
differences in numbers of cases per stratigraphic level and
the differential missing data, percentages give a more com­
parative value than absolute numbers afford. The chi-square
statistic produced by contingency table analysis is also
presented.
Nonparametric correlati~n coefficients (Nie and others
1975) using Kendall·s tau as a measure of association were com­
puted between age categories, sex, and types of artifacts.
Pearson·s R coefficients were calculated as an input matrix
for factor analysis. The artifacts showing significant
relationships (p.>.05) were then entered into contingency table
analysis. The chi-square statistic showed no statistically
meaningful association of artifacts with age and sex classes.
Inferential Statistics
Discriminant function ~nalysis (Nie and others 1975) was
selected as the means to isolate the significant differences
between stratigraphic levels. The level was the a priori
group required by discriminant analysis. Artifacts were not
included as variables because their concentration in Group 2
was known and the focus of the analysis was to distinguish
cultural influence on interment practices. An increase in
Rao·s V was selected as the variable entry criterion to maximize
the separation Of the groups.
The homogeneity between Groups 1 and 2 is evident in the
plot of discriminant scores in Figure III-I. Groups·3 aDd 4 were
distinct, showing only a slight overlap with ~roup 2. The
discriminating variables that effected this division were body
position and flexing of limbs, as is apparent in the maps in
Figures 12A and 12B. The variable of orientation also figures
prominently as a high discriminating power.
The classification feature of discriminant function, with
prior probabilities based on size, was used to assign the
burials whose stratigraphic associations were uncertain. Of
the nine unclassified burials from this site with sufficient
data, Burial 139 was assigned to Group 1, Burials 6, 7, 72, 145,
193, 218 and 223 were assigned to Group 2, and Burial 107 to
Group 3.

APPENDIX III

399

Groups 3 and 4 were eliminated from further analysis
because of small sample size. A second step-wise discriminant
function, again using Rao's V as a measure of separation, was
applied only to those burials definitely assigned to Group 1
or Group 2 (Fig. 111-1). The discriminating variables that con­
tributed most strongly to the resultant separation were direction
looking, body position, limb arrangement and orientation. These
variables were then tested by contingency table analysis. The
distribution of limb arrangements indicates the practice of
placing a hand to the face and of crossing the ankles occurs
only in Group 2 (Tables 9 and 10). There is no correlation
between the two variables themselves. Positioning of the body
face down occurs in both groups but is predominantly a female
attribute with only one male burial in each group exhibiting
this variable (Table 7).
Further examination of the discriminating variable
direction looking showed this in reality to be a fUnction of
orientation with contributing influence from head position.
Obviously, the orientation of the body limits the possible
direction looking to two arcs depending on the position of
the head. Right-turned faces have higher frequency in both
groups but a chi-square test of head position within each
group showed no statistically significant preference for left
or right (Table 8). Head position is not noticeably affected
by orientation within the level (Tables 12C and 13C).
The most striking difference between the groups is in
orientation of the bodies. The shift in directional positioning
is graphically illustrated in Figures 10 and 11. Comparisons
of sex ratios within the orientation arcs, while not statis­
tically significant, show a slight tend~ncy for female burials
to vary from the primary group orientation in Group 2, while
in Group 1 it is the male burials that vary in orientation
(Tables 12A and 13A).
A general index of the .similarity in burial practices
between these groups is to be found in the computer c1assifi­
.cation of group membership. Twelve out of 58 or 20.7% of the
individual burials in Group 1 were classed as more typical of
Group 2; and 48 out of 144 or 33.3% of .Group 2 were computed
to be statistically more similar to Group 1.
The analysis level was reduced once more to attempt to
discriminate between the orientation arcs within each level.
In Group 1 the only burials oriented outside the main quadrants
(primary group orientation) are male. The two female burials
(66 and 155) shown in segments 2 (45 0 to 90 0 ) and 5 (180 0 to
234 0 ) are in actuality within 30 of the primary east-to-south
quadrant. The three male burials (151, 205, and 221) are
oriented far differently from the normal directional preference
for this level, although they lie within the main concentration
of burials.
Group 2 reverses this sttuation. Eight of the ten burials
oriented outside the main directional preference are sexed as
female and one burial (26) is that of a child whose sex is
undetermined. These unusally oriented burials contained

400

ALLENS CREEK

intentional grave goods in 40% of the cases. One female had
apparently died after being wounded with projectile points.
A closer examination of th~ face-down burials shows that
five out of six in Group 1 are female and all are oriented
within the preferred arcs for that level (Table 12B). In
the second group, seven females and one male are interred
face down. Six of these eight are within the preferred orien­
tation for Group 2; the other two face-down females were in
the peripheral arc of 90 0 to 136 0 (Table 13B). One of these
burials (208) has grave offerings; the other (177) is the
previously mentioned female who apparently died from projectile
point wounds. In fact, four of the eight face-down burials in
Group 2 were accompanied by artifacts.
The assumption that orientation arcs define a priori
intralevel groups that exhibit discrete patterns is invalidated
by the classification option. In Group 1 77.4% of the cases
were correctly classified within their arcs of orientation
while in Group 2 only 47.7% were estimated to be within their
proper orientation. This may be in part due to a tentatively
suggested shift in orientation through time within the level.
The burials that are oriented within the arc 3350 to 360 0
(Burials 3, 15, 34, 41, 75, 80, 90, 96 and 195) often appear
to be intrusive into earleir burials and/or to be on the
periphery of the main concentration of bodies. The larger
sample in Group 2 also allows more room for variation within
the group.
In summary, the discriminant analysis isolated Groups 3
and 4 primarily through the variables of body arrangement.
Exceptions to the general homogeneity between Groups 1 and 2 are
the discriminating variables of orientation and limb positioning.
The shift in orientation from east and south to north and east;
the placing of a hand to the face; the crossing of the ankles;
the greater variety in combinations of these variables; the
tentative indications of a more rigid attention to the orienta­
tion of male bodies; added to the evidence for violent death
and the increase in grave offerings not included in this dis­
criminant analysis provide a framework for a cultural interpre­
tation of this variability.
.
A cluster analysis of cases (Dixon: 1975 BMDP2M) was
performed to isolate clusters of burials within the burial
groups that could conform to smaller SOCial groupings. Burials
that clustered in statistical space did not reflect any corres­
ponding pattern in geographical space.
The factor analysis mentioned in the section on descriptive
statistics was considered to be unsatisfactory because of the
large number of factors extracted. Because generation of
correlation coefficients by nonparametric statistical procedures
resulted in so many more significant associations than those
produced by Pearson's R, it is possible that the factoring
technique could be improved by entering a matrix based on non­
parametric coefficients.
This statistical analysis has provided the basis for a
diachronic perspective of the burial practices in this one

might yield a great deal more information about the increased
complexity of Group 2. A spatial analysis including pathologies
might clarify the problem of smaller social aggregates within
the groups. All data and computations produced in this analysis

IDENTIFICATION OF FAUNAL REMAINS
Kenneth J. Lopd

Vertebrate and invertebrate remains were identified with
the aid of comparative collections housed at the Texas Archeo­
logical Research Laboratory and the Vertebrate Paleontology
Laboratory, Balcones Research Center, The University of Texas at
Austin. Assistance rendered by Dr. Ernest L. Lunde1ius of the
Vertebrate Paleontology laboratory is gratefully acknowledged.
The species recognized are presented in tabular form below
by site and stratigraphic zone (Table IV-I). The number in each
column represents the minimum number of individuals evidenced
by the combined remains of each particular species from a zone.
For 41 AU 36, this count does not include deer skull and antler
parts found in direct association with Group 2 burials. Also
excluded from the count are species represented by the worked
bone artifacts recovered from 41 AU 36, 41 AU 37, and 41 AU 38.
Following tWe species list is an element by element breakdown
of anatomical parts representing each species (Table IV-2).

Feature 11, a canine skeleton recovered from a pit in Zone
4' at 41 AU 36, was essentially complete though many of the
skeletal elements were badly fragmented. The right femur,
right ulna, tibiae, radii, r~ght maxillas and r~ght mandible
were reasonably intact and provided useful osteometric data.
Unfortunately, the skull was so badly crushed and decomposed
that no measurements could be taken.
Articles by Haag (1948) and Parmalee and others (1972) were
consulted to determine the metric attributes considered most
pertinent or necessary in the comparison of canine skeletons.
Following outlines prescri~ed by these authorities, the following
measurements were taken:
Right Femur
Length - 156 mm.
Diameter of head - 18.25 mm.
Transverse diameter of head - 17.75 mm.
Right Ulna
Length - 166 mm.
Tibiae
Length
Left - 153 mm.
Right - 147 mm.

P3-M2 - 44.5 mm.
Carnassial - 19 mm.

Alveolus PI-H2 - 62 mm.
P3-"M3 - 55 mm.
MI-M3 - 37 mm.

PI-M3 - 69 mm.
Carnassial - 21.5 mm.
P1- P3 - 25. 5 mm.
PI-Ml - 55.5 mm.
Alveolar length of P4 - 18.5 mm.
Crown length of P4 - 19.75 mm.
Maximum width P4 - 11 mm.
Maximum width Ml - 9 mm.
Width of mandible at P4 - 11mm.
Width of mandible at Ml- 10.5 mm.
Depth of jaw from alveolus of Ml to ventral region
22 mm.
Special treatment, such as coverage with rack slabs or
placement in a definable pit, complete articulation of the
skeleton, tight flexure, and neat placement are cited in the
literature as evidence suggesting intentional burial of the dog.
Such remains are in this ~ay contrasted to canine bones inciden­
tally deposited in a site as habitational refuse to which no
special attention has been accorded. Based on its articulation
and neat placement in a distinct pit, Feature 11 very likely
rep res e nt san i nten t ion a 1 dog b.u ria 1 .
References to six other canine burials from sites in Texas
have been found in the literature. Though there is contextual
information in varying degrees of thoroughness for all of these
dogs, there have as ~et been no osteometric data published.
Localities yielding dog burials include the Miller Site (John­
son 1962}, the Gossett Bottoms Site (Story 1965), the Shetland
Site (Cochran 1974), the Deshazo Site (Henderson 1976), and
sites in Travis and Williamson counties (Weir 1976).
The Miller Site dog was oriented north-south with the head
to the north looking west. The skeleton was on its right side
with hind legs and forelegs flexed. Excavators could not
definitely establish the cultural affiliation of the dog,
whether aboriginal or recent Anglo-American (Johnson 1962: 241).
At the Gossett Bottoms Site, Story (1965: 175) describes the
dog burial as oriented east-west with the head to the east
looking north. The skeleton was tightly flexed. The burial may
have resulted from a Wylie Focus occupation at the site, but
this could not be definitely established. Dog burials from the
Shetland Site in Bell County and from sites in Travis and
Williamson counties were all found in shallow pits covered with
rock slabs. The Travis County dog was placed in a burned rock
midden. Weir (1976: 47) suggests that the Williamson County dog
dates to the San Marcos Phase (850 B.C. - 150 A.D.) of the
Central Texas Archaic while the Bell and Travis county individuals
belong in the Twin Sisters Phase (50 B.C. - 1250 A.D.). The
Feature 11 skeleton from 41 AU 36 was oriented northwest­
southeast with the head to the northwest looking west. The body
rested on its right side with hind legs flexed and forelegs
strai~ht (see Fig. 25E}.

RESULTS OF SITE TESTING
Grant D. HaLL

Introduction
As a result of the initial findings presented in Research
Report No. 16 (Dillehay and others 1972), fifteen sites within

the plant and reservoir areas were recommended for "intensive
archeological survey" involving more definitive assessment of
sites, primarily through the excavation of test pits. The
purpose of such a study was to determine which sites among
those originally recommended for further investigation were
worthy of intensive investigation, that is, mitigation of impact
through recovery of a representative sample of the resources
to be affected.
Of the seven months spent conducting intensive survey and
excavation in the ACNGS area, five weeks were devoted to test
excavations at the fifteen recommended sites. During this
period, it was determined that twelve of the fifteen sites did
not, for the various reasons mentioned below, warrant further
investigation. The following summaries briefly present the
findings and conclusions resulting from the testing operations
at the twelve sites in the proposed ACNGS area which were ex­
cluded from further investigation.
