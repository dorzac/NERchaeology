An Annotated Index to the Fh’st Ten Volumes
of the Bulletin of the
Central Texas Archeological Society
WilKam E. Moore and Michael R. Bradle

ABSTRACT
The Central Texas Archeological Society was organized in 1934 and is
the second oldest archeological society in Texas. The Society has made
notable contributions to Texas archeology and has published 10 volumes of
Central Texas Archeologist: Bulletin of the Central Texas Archeological Society. This index provides researchers with annotations for all entries in the
10 volumes, listed under several headings.

INTRODUCTION
The Central Texas Archeological Society was organized on February 17,
1934 in Waco, Texas, with W. R Meroney as president. The first Bulletin, edited
by Frank Watt, was published in January 1935. The Society consisted of avocational archeologists who were determined in their desire to learn about Texas archeology. At that time very little was known about the prehistory of the State.
The Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society (later renamed Texas Archeological Society) had been in existence only six years. There were very few
professional archeo!ogists in Texas at that time, and most of their work was conducted in the 1930s under auspices of WPA (the work program of the Roosevelt
administration) and in the 1940s as part of the River Basin Surveys of the
Smithsonian Institution.
Over the years, several members of the Central Texas Archeological Society
have achieved recognition in the archeological community. Frank Watt, who
served as editor and president during many of his years with the Society, received
the George McJunkin Award of Honor from the Instituto Interamericano and was
awarded the title Master Archeologist by the Guild of American Prehistorians.
Contributors to the Society’s journal, the Bulletin of the Central Texas Archeological Society (BCTAS), include A. T. Jackson, Forrest Kirkland, J. E. Pearce,
Harry J. Shafer, Dee Ann Story, and Frank H. Watt.
The focus of the Society has been primarily on McClennan and surrounding
counties, although articles concerning other states and other countries have ap-

peared in the BCTAS. Information disseminated through the BCTAS has provided important insights into such archeological problems as the distribution and
function of Waco Sinkers and the use of rock-shelters as mortuary sites in Central Texas.
The year 1986 marks 50 years since the first BCTAS was published by the
Central Texas Archeological Society, which is still active and has members
throughout Texas. We hope this index will be a useful reference for researchers
interested in the archeology of Central Texas and an introduction to the Central
Texas Archeological Society. Complete sets of the BCTAS are on file in the Archeological Research Laboratory, Texas A&M University and in the private collection of Albert J. Redder, of Waco, Texas.
The main part of the index is the "Authors" section, which is arranged alphabetically and carries the complete citations, followed by the counties, states,
and countries the article concerns. Where counties are not mentioned in the text,
they are named in cases where they could be ascertained from the locations of
sites mentioned or where they were supplied by Albert Redder or others familiar
with the area. In order to provide references to as many counties as possible, all
counties mentioned in the articles are named.
The articles in the 10 volumes are also listed by areas and by subjects. A key
to these listings follows.

BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE
William E. Moore received his M.A. in anthropology from Texas A&M University in
1980. Since that time he has worked for Heartfield, Price, and Greene, Inc., in Monroe
Louisiana; Intermountain Research in Silver City, Nevada; and the Nevada State Museum
in Carson City, Nevada. Moore is now employed with the Archeological Research Laboratory, Texas A&M University. His major interests are archival research, editing, and report
preparation and his areas of specialization are Southeast Texas and Central Texas. Recent
publications include a report of the 1976 Texas Archeological Society Field School (Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society, Volume 53) and a bibliography of historical archeology in Texas (with Roger Moore) to be published by the Center for Archaeological Research, The University of Texas at San Antonio.
Michael R. Bradle is an undergraduate student in anthropology at Texas A&M University. He recently participated in a survey of Fort Hood, Texas conducted by the Archeological Research Laboratory, Texas A&M University and has worked with Frederick
Briuer and George Thomas, Fort Hood archeologists, in a monitoring project for Fort
Hood sites. His major areas of interest are documentation of vandalism of archeological
sites and relations between the archeological community and the public. Bradle is president of the Pecan Valley Archaeological Society in Lampasas, Texas.
