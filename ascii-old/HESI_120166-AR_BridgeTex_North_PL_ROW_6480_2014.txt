ABSTRACT

Between March and July 2013, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon)
conducted a cultural resources survey of 390 US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)
jurisdictional areas along BridgeTex Pipeline Company, LLC’s (BridgeTex) proposed BridgeTex
North pipeline right-of-way (ROW) in Scurry, Fisher, Nolan, Taylor, Callahan, Brown,
Comanche, Hamilton, Coryell, McLennan, Bell, Falls, Milam, Robertson, Brazos, Grimes,
Montgomery, and Harris counties, Texas. Although the vast majority of the proposed ROW will
be located on private property and will be constructed with private funds, construction within 227
USACE jurisdictional areas traversed by the proposed ROW will require the usage of
Nationwide Permits (NWP) issued by the USACE. As NWPs are federal permits, the portions of
the undertaking within the 227 USACE jurisdictional areas where they are required also fall
under the regulations of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966,
as amended. The remaining 163 USACE jurisdictional areas will be spanned via horizontal
directional drills (HDD) and will not require the usage of any federal permits. In addition, a short
segment of the proposed ROW extends across the Alfred Hughes Prison property in Coryell
County, Texas. As this property is owned by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ),
a political subdivision of the state, this short segment of the proposed ROW on the prison
property falls under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT).
At the request of Zephyr Environmental Corporation (Zephyr), Horizon conducted the
cultural resources survey of the 390 USACE jurisdictional areas along the proposed ROW and
the portion of the proposed ROW on the Alfred Hughes Prison property on behalf of BridgeTex
in compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA and the ACT. The purpose of the cultural
resources survey was to: (1) determine if any archeological sites were located within the
USACE jurisdictional areas along the proposed ROW and, if any existed, to determine if the
undertaking had the potential to have any adverse impacts on archeological sites listed on or
considered eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP); and (2) to
determine if any archeological sites were located within the portion of the proposed ROW on the
Alfred Hughes Prison property and, if any existed, to determine if the undertaking had the
potential to have any adverse impacts on archeological sites considered eligible for formal
designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). Horizon utilized Texas Antiquities
Committee (TAC) permit no. 6840, issued by the Texas Historical Commission (THC), to assess
the portion of the proposed ROW on the Alfred Hughes Prison property.

Abstract

The cultural resources survey of the 227 USACE jurisdictional areas along the proposed
BridgeTex North ROW that will require the usage of a NWP resulted in the documentation of
11 archeological sites, including 8 new sites and the reassessment of 3 previously recorded
sites. It also resulted in the documentation of 21 USACE jurisdictional areas where mechanical
trenching is recommended in order to adequately assess locations containing deep alluvial soils
where the potential for deeply buried cultural deposits exists.
Of the 11 assessed archeological sites within the 227 USACE jurisdictional areas where
the usage of a NWP will be necessary for construction, it is Horizon’s opinion that 7 sites
(41CA26, 41CV1666, 41FS52, 41HM62, 41MM133, 41NL311, and 41TA314) contain cultural
deposits that are considered to be non-contributing elements to the overall NRHP eligibility
status of the respective sites containing them. On these 7 sites, it is Horizon’s recommendation
that no additional investigations are warranted.
It is Horizon’s opinion that the remaining 4 assessed archeological sites (41BZ172,
41CV275, 41CV1665, and 41RT572) within the 227 USACE jurisdictional areas where the
usage of a NWP will be necessary for construction have an undetermined NRHP eligibility
status. Horizon recommends that these 4 sites be completely avoided and protected during
pipeline construction efforts. If avoidance and protection is not feasible, then Horizon
recommends NRHP eligibility testing efforts on each to formally determine their NRHP eligibility
status. In the case of 41BZ172 and 41CV1665, BridgeTex has shifted the ROW away from
each of these sites to avoid any impacts to them. Additionally, BridgeTex intends to avoid
impacts to site 41CV275 by installing the pipeline below this site via an HDD. The remaining
site, 41RT572, is located on the east bank of the Brazos River. Although this location will be
spanned with an HDD, the Brazos River is a Section 10 waterway that will require the usage of
a NWP regardless of the HDD. As such, Horizon recommends mechanical trenching efforts
within the HDD bore entry/exit location on the east side of the Brazos River to determine if any
deeply buried cultural deposits are present within the floodplain setting.
A fourth previously recorded site, 41GM5, is located just to the southeast of the currently
proposed ROW, on the opposite side of several existing pipeline ROWs and an existing
transmission line ROW. Site 41GM5, previously documented as a historic-era farmstead
associated with the Stephen F. Austin colony, currently has an undetermined NRHP eligibility
status. The survey of the portion of the proposed ROW in the vicinity of this site produced
entirely negative results, revealing that site 41GM5 does not extend into the currently proposed
ROW. As such, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the proposed BridgeTex North
pipeline will pose no adverse effects to 41GM5 and that no additional investigations are
warranted within the proposed ROW at this location.
A total of 21 USACE jurisdictional areas within the 227 USACE jurisdictional areas along
the proposed BridgeTex North ROW that will require the usage of a NWP were found to contain
the potential for deeply buried cultural deposits beyond the reach of conventional shovel testing
methods. Horizon recommends mechanical trenching efforts at these 21 locations to determine
whether deeply buried and stratified cultural deposits are present and, if so, to assess the
NRHP eligibility status of any encountered deposits.

Finally, a total of 12 of the 227 USACE jurisdictional areas requiring the usage of a NWP
were located on properties where landowners are currently denying access. As these locations
have yet to be assessed for the presence/absence of any cultural resources that may be eligible
for inclusion on the NRHP, Horizon recommends survey efforts at these 12 locations.
The cultural resources survey of the 163 USACE jurisdictional areas along the proposed
BridgeTex North ROW where the pipeline will be installed via HDD and will not require the
usage of any federal permitting actions resulted in the documentation of 17 new archeological
sites and the reassessment of 1 previously recorded archeological site. Of these 18 sites,
12 sites (41BR587, 41BR588, 41FS121, 41GM460, 41GM461, 41MQ307, 41MQ308, 41RT17,
41RT573, 41RT574, 41RT575, and 41TA315) have cultural deposits within the proposed ROW
that have an undetermined NRHP eligibility status, and 6 sites (41BR589, 41FS122, 41FS123,
41FS124, 41TA312, and 41TA313) have deposits within the proposed ROW that are considered
to be non-contributing elements to the overall NRHP eligibility status of the respective sites
containing them. Although pipeline construction activities across these 18 sites are not
regulated by Section 106 of the NHPA, Horizon recommends placing the HDD bore entry/exit
locations outside of the mapped boundaries of all 12 sites with an undetermined NRHP eligibility
status to ensure the protection of the cultural deposits contained within them.

Company, LLC’s Proposed BridgeTex North Pipeline ROW

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey of 390 US
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) jurisdictional areas along BridgeTex Pipeline Company,
LLC’s (BridgeTex) proposed BridgeTex North pipeline right-of-way (ROW). BridgeTex is
proposing to construct this 20-inch-diameter pipeline to transport crude oil from the Permian
Basin to the Houston area for refinement.
Measuring approximately 408.0 miles
(656.6 kilometers [km]) in length, the proposed ROW begins north of Colorado City, Texas, and
navigates east-southeastwards, terminating at the Magellan East Houston Terminal in Houston,
Texas (Figure 1-1). Along its length, the proposed ROW extends through Scurry, Fisher, Nolan,
Taylor, Callahan, Brown, Comanche, Hamilton, Coryell, McLennan, Bell, Falls, Milam,
Robertson, Brazos, Grimes, Montgomery, and Harris counties, Texas. Although the vast
majority of the proposed ROW will be located on private property and will be constructed with
private funds, its construction within 227 of the USACE jurisdictional areas traversed by the
proposed ROW will require the usage of Nationwide Permits (NWPs) issued by the USACE. As
NWPs are federal permits, the portions of the undertaking within these 227 USACE jurisdictional
areas also fall under the regulations of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA) of 1966, as amended. The remaining 163 USACE jurisdictional areas will be spanned
via horizontal directional drills (HDD) and will not require the usage of any federal permits. In
addition, a short segment of the proposed ROW extends across the Alfred Hughes Prison
property in Coryell County, Texas. As this property is owned by the Texas Department of
Criminal Justice (TDCJ), a political subdivision of the state, this short segment of the proposed
ROW on the prison property falls under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT).
In total, the proposed BridgeTex North ROW measures approximately 408.0 miles
(656.6 km) in length and extends from Colorado City, Texas, to Houston, Texas. It has been
broken down into 4 segments that are described as follows.
Segment 1 measures
approximately 131.0 miles (210.8 km) in length and extends through Scurry, Fisher, Nolan,
Taylor, Callahan, and Brown counties, while Segment 2 measures approximately 102.0 miles
(164.2 km) in length and extends through Comanche, Hamilton, Coryell, and McLennan
counties (Figures 1-2 and 1-3). Segment 3 measures approximately 77.0 miles (123.9 km) in
length and extends through Bell, Falls, Milam, Robertson, and Brazos counties, while
Segment 4 measures approximately 98.0 miles (157.7 km) in length and extends through
Grimes, Montgomery, and Harris counties (Figures 1-4 and 1-5).

The permanent ROW will measure 50.0 feet (15.2 meters [m]) wide (2472.7 acres),
while the temporary workspace of up to 45.0 feet (13.7 m) will yield a construction corridor up to
95.0 feet (29.0 m) in width. Additional temporary workspace to allow for boring or horizontal
directional drilling will expand the construction corridor up to 150.0 feet (45.7 m) in certain nonjurisdictional areas. Along the length of the proposed ROW, biologists under the direction of
Zephyr Environmental Corporation (Zephyr) identified a total of 390 USACE jurisdictional areas.
These USACE jurisdictional areas, consisting of “waters of the US” and wetland areas,
comprise approximately 78,000.0 feet (23,774.4 m) of the overall ROW length (approximately
170.1 acres). For purposes of discussion, the USACE jurisdictional areas consist of each
wetland or waterway crossed by the proposed ROW as well as the associated uplands within
100.0 feet (30.5 m) of each. Of the 390 USACE jurisdictional areas delineated along the
proposed ROW, a total of 227 will require the usage of NWPs. Pipeline construction efforts
across the remaining 163 USACE jurisdictional areas will be via horizontal directional drills
(HDD) that do not require any federal permitting actions.
At the request of Zephyr, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted the
cultural resources survey of the 390 USACE jurisdictional areas along the proposed ROW and
the portion of the proposed ROW across the Alfred Hughes Prison property on behalf of
BridgeTex in compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA and the ACT. The purpose of the
cultural resources survey was to: (1) determine if any archeological sites were located within
the USACE jurisdictional areas along the proposed ROW and, if any existed, to determine if the
undertaking had the potential to have any adverse impacts on archeological sites listed on or
considered eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP); and (2) to
determine if any archeological sites were located within the portion of the proposed ROW
across the Alfred Hughes Prison property and, if any existed, to determine if the undertaking
had the potential to have any adverse impacts on archeological sites considered eligible for
formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). Horizon utilized Texas Antiquities
Committee (TAC) permit no. 6840, issued by the Texas Historical Commission (THC), to assess
the portion of the proposed ROW across the Alfred Hughes Prison property.
The 163 USACE jurisdictional areas along the proposed ROW that will be spanned via
HDD are not addressed in the regulatory portions of this document, as the HDD spans serve to
avoid any potential impacts to the USACE jurisdictional areas and do not require the usage of a
NWP. The only exception to this exclusion is the HDD of the Brazos River. Because it is
considered to be a Section 10 waterway, pipeline construction efforts at this location will require
the usage of a NWP despite the fact that the pipeline will be installed via a HDD beneath it.
It should be noted that, while numerous previously unidentified archeological sites were
encountered during the initial survey efforts within the USACE jurisdictional areas, the
subsequent determination of the HDD locations along the proposed ROW removed the need for
the utilization of NWPs at many locations (with the exception of the HDD of the Brazos River).
As a result, the previously unidentified archeological sites within the HDD locations where the
usage of a federal permit is not necessary are not afforded protection under Section 106 of the
NHPA. However, these sites are discussed in a separate, non-regulatory chapter of this

HJN 120166 AR

Chapter 1.0: Introduction

document in order to document their location and aid in their avoidance, if necessary, during the
HDD activities.
The cultural resources investigations consisted of archival research, an intensive
pedestrian survey of the USACE jurisdictional areas delineated along the proposed ROW, and
the production of a report suitable for review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO)
in accordance with the THC’s Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the
Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports.
Russell Brownlow (Horizon’s cultural resources director) served as the project’s principal
investigator, while Briana Smith, Michael Mudd, Jared Wiersema (Horizon staff archeologists);
and Michael Placher, Trevor Seekamp, Luke Hugman, Chris Lamon, and Jesse Dalton
(archeological field technicians) conducted the field investigations.
Horizon conducted the cultural resources survey of the USACE jurisdictional areas along
the proposed ROW between the months of March and July 2013. The Texas State Minimum
Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for
linear projects measuring 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width. As the length of the 390 USACE
jurisdictional areas along the entire length of the proposed ROW total approximately 78,000.0
feet (23,774.4 m) in combined length, a total of 238 shovel tests would have been necessary
within the USACE jurisdictional areas in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded
the TSMASS by excavating a total of 1,653 shovel tests within all 390 of the USACE
jurisdictional areas along the overall length of the proposed ROW. This includes shovel testing
efforts within the 227 USACE jurisdictional areas where the usage of a NWP will be necessary
and the 163 USACE jurisdictional areas that will be spanned via a HDD and do not require the
usage of any federal permitting.
This report presents the results of this cultural resources survey of the USACE
jurisdictional areas delineated along the length of the proposed ROW where a NWP will be
necessary for pipeline construction. Following this introductory chapter, Chapters 2.0 and 3.0
present the environmental and cultural backgrounds, respectively, for areas traversed by the
proposed ROW. Chapter 4.0 describes the general methodology utilized for the various aspects
of the investigation, and Chapter 5.0 presents the results of archival research conducted for the
project. Chapters 6.0 through 9.0 present the results of the cultural resources survey within the
227 USACE jurisdictional areas where a NWP will be utilized for construction broken down by
the respective segments in which they are located. Chapters 10.0 through 13.0 provide a
discussion of sites recorded in the 163 USACE jurisdictional areas where HDDs negate the
need for the utilization of NWPs (i.e., outside of federal agency jurisdiction), also broken down
by the respective segments in which they are located. Chapter 14.0 presents a summary of the
findings and management recommendations for the regulatory portions of the project, and
Chapter 15.0 lists the references cited in the report. Following the main body of the report is a
series of 4 addenda, designated as Chapters 16.0 to 19.0, that present the results of
supplemental survey and backhoe trenching efforts conducted in Segments 1 to 4 of the
proposed ROW, respectively, following the publication and agency review of Chapters 1.0 to
15.0. Appendix A summarizes the shovel test data.

GENERAL PROJECT DESCRIPTION

BridgeTex is proposing to construct a 20-inch-diameter pipeline to transport crude oil
from the Permian Basin to the Houston area for refinement. Measuring approximately 408.0
miles (656.6 km) in length, the proposed ROW begins north of Colorado City, Texas, and
navigates east-southeastwards, terminating at the Magellan East Houston Terminal in Houston,
Texas (see Figure 1-1). The overall length of the approximately 408.0-mile (656.6-km-) long
ROW has been divided into 4 segments that are described as follows:
Segment 1 of the proposed ROW measures approximately 131.0 miles (210.8 km) in
length and extends through Scurry, Fisher, Nolan, Taylor, Callahan, and Brown counties (see
Figure 1-2).
Segment 2 of the proposed ROW measures approximately 102.0 miles (164.2 km) in
length and extends through Comanche, Hamilton, Coryell, and McLennan counties (see Figure
1-3).
Segment 3 of the proposed ROW measures approximately 77.0 miles (123.9 km) in
length and extends through Bell, Falls, Milam, Robertson, and Brazos counties (see Figure 1-4).
Segment 4 of the proposed ROW measures approximately 98.0 miles (157.7 km) in
length and extends through Grimes, Montgomery, and Harris counties (see Figure 1-5).

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND NATURAL VEGETATION

The proposed BridgeTex North pipeline ROW traverses 2 broad physiographic regions
in northwest, central, and coastal Texas, including the North-Central Plains and the Gulf Coastal
Plains. The North-Central Plains (or Interior Lowlands) physiographic region is located along
the southeastern edge of the Great Plains physiographic province (Carr 1967:2-3; Fenneman
1938:100-103). The North-Central Plains are characterized by an erosional surface that
developed on upper Paleozoic formations. Meandering rivers traverse stretches of local prairie
where shale bedrock prevails. Hills and rolling plains predominate in areas of harder bedrock.
Local areas of hard sandstone and limestone cap steep slopes that become severely dissected
near rivers. Lengthy dip slopes of strongly fractured limestone display extensive rectangular

patterns. Western rocks and soils are oxidized in red or gray colors where gypsum
predominates, and eastern rocks and soils weather to tan and buff tones. The North-Central
Plains physiographic region is characterized by riparian deciduous forests of sugarberry and
evergreen shrublands of Harvard shin oak, oneseed juniper, redberry juniper, and sandsage
(Diamond et al. 1987). Deciduous shrublands of Mohr’s shin oak, medium-tall grasslands of
little bluestem and sideoats grama, and marshes of saltgrass also are part of the plant
community. Live oak-Ashe juniper parks grade gradually westward into mesquite lotebush
brush across the region.
Within the North-Central Plains, the proposed BridgeTex ROW traverses 2 vegetational
regions, including the Central Rolling Plains and the Cross Timbers and Prairies. Specifically,
Segment 1 of the proposed ROW crosses the Central Rolling Plains and a small portion of the
Cross Timbers and Prairies, while Segment 2 of the proposed ROW lies solely within the Cross
Timbers and Prairies vegetational region.
The Rolling Plains vegetational region is situated between the High Plains and the Cross
Timbers and Prairies. Elevation ranges from 1640.00 to 2950.0 feet (500.0 to 900.0 m) above
mean sea level (amsl). Soils of the uplands are pale brown to reddish-brown to dark-grayish
brown, neutral to calcareous sandy loams, clay loams, and clays. Saline soils are common, as
are shallow and stony soils with pockets of deep sand. Bottomlands have only minor areas of
reddish-brown, loamy to clayey, calcareous alluvial soils. The Rolling Plains can be described
as a midgrass prairie with scattered mesquite trees or grasslands with numerous junipers and
oaks. Important grasses include sideoats grama, little bluestem, Texas wintergrass, and
common curly mesquite. On sandy soils, species such as sand bluestem and switch grass
were also important, along with sand sagebrush. Many of the deeper, more fertile soils of the
Rolling Plains have been converted to row crops, but the majority of the area consists of native
sod that has a long history of overgrazing by domestic livestock. Native grasses, such as hairy
grama, three-awns, and sand dropseed, have replaced climax native grasses, and woody
species such as mesquite, lotebush, and red-berry juniper have increased in importance
(Diamond 2012).
The Cross Timbers and Prairies (or Oak Woods and Prairies) vegetational region is a
divided region situated between the Central Rolling Plains and the Blackland Prairie.
Specifically, within the Oak Woods and Prairies region, portions of the proposed ROW traverse
the Grand Prairie and Western Cross Timbers subregions. The Grand Prairie consists of wide
lowlands, which resemble the landscape of the Blackland Prairie, and limestone mesa uplands.
Vegetation in this subregion consists of a mixed-grass prairie dominated by little bluestem and
containing isolated live oak mottes, junipers, and mesquite savannas (Hayward et al. 1996).
The Western Cross Timbers comprises a narrow, irregularly bounded wooded region
encompassing a portion of Segment 1 and all of Segment 2. Topographically, the Western
Cross Timbers is characterized by rough features, in contrast to the smooth outlines of the lands
both to the east and to the west. The natural vegetation of the area consists of woodlands
predominantly made up of dwarfed post oaks. Short grasses occur over much of the area in
localities where the woodland growth is sparse. Some of the areas underlain by deep sands
support a growth of tall grasses.

Company, LLC’s Proposed BridgeTex North Pipeline ROW

The Gulf Coastal Plan is situated to the south and east of the North-Central Plains (or
Interior Lowlands) physiographic region and along the southeastern edge of the Great Plains
physiographic province (Carr 1967:2-3; Fenneman 1938:100-103). The Gulf Coastal Plain
physiographic region is characterized as:
an area where the temperate southeastern woodlands gradually give way to the
grasslands of the plains. It is a land of mixed forests, pine barrens, open savannas, tall
grass prairies, and littoral marshes. Much of the terrain is gently rolling but mountains
(the Ouachitas) and coastal flats are to be found in the northern and southern margins of
the region, respectively. A number of perennial rivers and streams cross the area,
ending in the deltas and bays along the…Gulf of Mexico (Story and Guy 1990:2).

The Gulf of Mexico represents a structural basin formed by lithosphere deformation.
The Gulf Coastal Plain, which extends as far north as the Ouachita uplift in southern Oklahoma
and westward to the Balcones Escarpment, consists of seaward-dipping bodies of sedimentary
rock, most of which are of terrigenous clastic origin, that reflect the gradual infilling of the basin
from its margins (Abbott 2001). In Texas, the Gulf Coastal Plain rises from sea level at the Gulf
shore to an average elevation of 500.0 feet (152.0 m) amsl in the central and northeastern
areas. The highest elevations occur around Del Rio in Val Verde County, where it rises to
approximately 1000.0 feet (305.0 m) amsl (Swanson 1995:23-24). The topography in northwest
and central Texas is gently rolling to hilly in the northern and central areas, becoming flatter
toward the Gulf.
Within the Gulf Coastal Plains, the proposed ROW traverses 4 vegetational areas,
including the Blackland Prairie, the Gulf Prairies, the Post Oak Savanna (or Oak Woodlands)
and the Piney Woods (Diamond et al. 1987). Specifically, Segment 3 traverses the Blackland
Prairie and the Post Oak Savanna vegetational regions, while Segment 4 traverses all 4 of the
vegetational regions within the Gulf Coastal Plains.
The Blackland Prairie is a low, rolling land that extends in a narrow band just east and
southeast of the Balcones fault zone from the Red River Valley in northeastern Texas south and
southwest to the southern edge of the Edwards Plateau. This is an area of low relief and poor
drainage where water often ponds after rainstorms. Streams flow at very gentle gradients.
Elevations on the Blackland Prairie within the project area range from 394.0 to 705.0 feet
(120.0 to 215.0 m) amsl. Deep, calcareous, clayey soil formed in soft bedrock supports
predominantly prairie vegetation broken by small woods and forests. Rock of any kind is scarce
on the Blackland Prairie, and the only chert sources are gravels in the beds of streams that
drain exposures of Edwards limestone to the west. Most of the main belt within the Blackland
Prairie has been converted to agricultural fields. The Blackland Prairie vegetation region
consists of tall grasslands composed primarily of little bluestem and Indiangrass with riparian
deciduous forests of sugarberry and elm (Diamond et al. 1987).
The Pineywoods region is composed of 2 distinct forest communities—mixed pinehardwood forest and longleaf pine forest. The soils of the region are generally acidic and mostly
pale to dark gray sand or sandy loam. Elevations range from 200.0 to 500.0 feet (61.0 to
152.0 m) amsl. The mixed pine-hardwood forest is characterized by medium-tall to tall

broadleaf deciduous hardwoods, including a wide variety of oak, elm, hickory, maple,
sweetgum, and other mesic species. In some cases, the presence of pine represents a
subclimax vegetation association. Longleaf, shortleaf, and loblolly pines, as well as a variety of
hardwoods such as oak, hickory, beech, birch, gum, and magnolia, as well as tupelo and bald
cypress in swampy floodplain areas, are constituents of this vegetation region. The longleaf
pine forest is most common in the southern part of Northeast Texas, extending south to the
coastal prairies of Southeast Texas. Shortleaf pine is found primarily in the northern part of the
pine region, covering approximately 30,000 square miles extending from the Red River in the
north to the edge of the longleaf range in the south-central part of the region. Within both
Pineywoods vegetation communities, bottomland forests and wetlands are common. These
communities are dominated by hardwood and swamp forests, marsh and bog vegetation, herbs,
shrubs, and other plants that tolerate extended periods of stream overflow. Common trees in
these habitats are sweetgum, black tupelo, elm, green ash, bald cypress, water oak, overcup
oak, cottonwood, black willow, and American hornbeam (Diamond et al. 1987:212). Herbs,
shrubs, ferns, cane, wax myrtle, sassafras, holly, yaupon, cane, and buttonbush occur along the
margins of marshes, bogs, and channel lakes and sloughs.
The Post Oak Savanna and Pineywoods support medium-tall to tall broadleaf deciduous
forests, and shortleaf loblolly pines occur in the Pineywoods on upland fine sandy loam soils
with adequate moisture. Small areas of tall-grass prairie may occur in both communities (cf.
Jordan 1981). The Post Oak Savanna is a narrow, southwest-to-northeast-trending woodland
belt composed primarily of post oak, blackjack oak, hickory, pecan, and ash that marks a natural
transition zone, or ecotone, between the more xeric Blackland Prairie to the west and the more
mesic Pineywoods to the east (Kuchler 1964).
The Gulf Prairies vegetational region comprises much of the Texas coast. This region, a
nearly level, slowly drained plain, is dissected by streams and rivers flowing into the Gulf of
Mexico. Elevations within this region are typically less than 150.0 feet (45.7 m) amsl. Rainfall
amounts are fairly distributed through the region ranging from 20.0 to 50.0 inches (50.8 to 127.0
cm) per year. Soils are acidic sands and sandy loams, with clays occurring primarily in the river
bottoms (TPWD 2013.) Native vegetation consists of tallgrass prairies and live oak woodlands;
however, the oak scrub has become much more extensive throughout the years at the expense
of the grassland. Much of the area has been invaded by trees and brush such as mesquite,
prickly pear, oaks, and acacias (TPWD 2013).

HYDROLOGY

Hydrologically, the proposed BridgeTex North ROW is situated within the Brazos,
Colorado, and San Jacinto river basins. Segment 1 traverses both the Brazos and Colorado
River basins, Segments 2 and 3 lie solely within the Brazos River basin, and Segment 4 is
situated within the San Jacinto River basin. The proposed ROW within Segment 1 is drained by
several waterways, including Bullwagon Creek, Elm Creek, Hog Creek, Holloway Creek, Little
Elm Creek, Little Sulpher Creek, Live Oak Creek, Mulberry Creek, Paint Creek, and Sweetwater
Creek. Major waterways within Segment 2 include Coryell Creek, Eagle Creek, Jimmys Creek,
Leon River, Rabbit Creek, the South Leon River, and Walnut Creek. The proposed ROW within

Segment 3 is drained by Allcorn Creek, the Little Brazos River, Live Oak Creek, the Navasota
River, Peters Slough, Pin Oak Creek, Pond Creek, and Sandy Creek. Segment 4 is drained by
several waterways that include Caney Creek, Cow Branch, Cypress Creek, Greens Bayou,
Hunting Bayou, Lake Creek, and Spring Creek.

2.4

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

The proposed BridgeTex pipeline ROW traverses 18 counties in north-central and
northwest-central and coastal Texas. Geologically, the project area traverses a deep-seated
fracture zone that represents the site of past orogenic events and that separates the stable
continental interior to the west from the subsiding basin of the Gulf of Mexico to the east and
southeast (Hayward 1988a, 1988b). The early geologic history of the area is evidenced in the
substrate to the south of the project area. Tectonic events during the Precambrian
metamorphosed sediments deposited along the margin of the continent into gneiss and schist,
which were later penetrated by intrusive granitic rocks. Marine transgression during the early
Paleozoic followed, and sandy sediments were deposited along the edge of the sea. Farther to
the east and southeast, limestones and dolomites were deposited in the deeper open waters.
Continued transgression covered the earlier rock units with extensive dolomites, limestones,
sandstones, and shales, which now form the tilted flanks of the Llano Uplift. Toward the end of
the Paleozoic (Pennsylvanian), the Ouachita Mountains rose along the margin of the continent
because of tectonic events related to formation of the supercontinent Pangaea. The rise of the
Ouachita Mountains along this zone in the Paleozoic caused deposition of clastic sediments and
carbonates on a broad shelf along the margin of the Permian Basin located southwest of the
project area. These sediments formed the Pennsylvanian and Permian rock units of the
western and northwestern parts of the study area. These sandstone, mudstone, and limestone
units dip and become progressively younger toward the basin (Fields et al. 2005).
As the Gulf of Mexico formed during the later Cretaceous period, clastic sediments and
carbonates were deposited over the worn-down Ouachita Mountains and later Paleozoic rocks
as well as along the broad marginal shelf of the Gulf of Mexico. The Lower Cretaceous
sandstones, mudstones, limestones, and marls found throughout parts of the project area
represent cycles of marine transgression and regression throughout this period. By Upper
Cretaceous times, infilling of the Gulf basin and shoreline progradation predominated, as
evidenced by Upper Cretaceous sandstones and mudstones throughout the eastern parts of the
project area. Marine regression and shoreline progradation continued during the Tertiary and
Quaternary and are represented by various sandstone and mudstone units present east and
southeast of the project area. Also at this time, during the Miocene, another tectonic event
along the fracture zone uplifted the Edwards Plateau (Fields et al. 2005).
Geomorphologically, the proposed BridgeTex pipeline ROW traverses numerous soil
associations within 18 counties across the entire length of the proposed ROW. Rather than
detail this extensive list of mapped soils for the entire proposed ROW here, soil data relevant to
individual USACE jurisdictional area/crossings will be presented in Chapters 6.0 to 13.0.

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995).
Bryant and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central
Texas from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.) through the Late Glacial
period (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.) to the Post-Glacial period (10,000 B.P. to present). Evidence
from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas was
considerably cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region was
more heavily forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and Holloway
1985). The Late Glacial period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow
warming and/or drying trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands
were gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985).
During the Post-Glacial period, the east-central Texas environment appears to have been more
stable. The deciduous forests had long since been replaced by prairies and post oak savannas.
The drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial period continued into the
mid-Holocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic
conditions lasting from roughly 6000 to 5000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and Holloway
(1985) indicate that modern environmental conditions in east-central Texas were probably
achieved by 1,500 years ago.
The proposed ROW is located within the south-central climatic division. The modern
climate is typically dry to subhumid with long, hot summers and short, mild winters. The climate
is influenced primarily by tropical Maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is modified
by polar air masses. Tropical Maritime air masses predominate throughout spring, summer,
and fall. Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental climate
characterized by considerable variations in temperature.
On average throughout the past century, precipitation and temperature in Texas
manifest regional clines with mean annual precipitation totals declining fairly regularly from east
to west and mean annual temperature declining equally evenly from northwest to southeast
(Larkin and Bomar 1983). In north-central Texas, climate has fluctuated from subtropical humid
to subtropical subhumid. Average annual precipitation totals 76.0 centimeters (cm) (30.0 inches
[in]) (Carr 1967). During this time, however, drier periods lasting from 3 to 7 years may be
followed by abnormally wet years. Two annual precipitation peaks, which typically occur in April
to May and September to October, are associated with frontal storms that form when
southward-moving cool air masses collide with warm, moist air masses moving inland from the
Gulf of Mexico (Bomar 1983; Carr 1967). The topographic discontinuity along the Balcones
Escarpment to the south and east lies directly in the path of the Gulf storm trace and increases
the lift in convective storms to produce extreme amounts of rainfall (Baker 1975). Lower rainfall
amounts are characteristic of winter and late summer. In winter, frontal storms pass so
frequently that there is little time for moisture to increase, and prevailing upper-level winds from
west to east often dominate over meridional flow, meaning that much of the available moisture

14

120166_arch_survey_report

A Cultural Resources Assessment of the USACE Jurisdictional Areas along BridgeTex Pipeline
Company, LLC’s Proposed BridgeTex North Pipeline ROW

is derived from the Pacific rather than from the Gulf of Mexico. In summer, cool fronts rarely
penetrate into the region, and rainfall occurs primarily as localized, thermal convective storms.
Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995).
While the paleoclimatic history of the coastal region remains unclear, Bryant and Holloway
(1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central Texas that includes
3 separate climatic periods—the Wisconsin Full Glacial Period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.), the Late
Glacial Period (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.), and the Post-Glacial Period (10,000 B.P. to present).
Evidence from the Wisconsin Full Glacial Period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas
was considerably cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region
was more heavily forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and
Holloway 1985). The Late Glacial Period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a
slow warming and/or drying trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous
woodlands were gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway
1985). During the Post-Glacial Period, the east-central Texas environment appears to have
been more stable. The deciduous forests had long since been replaced by prairies and post
oak savannas. The drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial Period continued
into the mid-Holocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration to more
mesic conditions lasting from roughly 6000 to 5000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and
Holloway (1985) indicate that modern environmental conditions in east-central Texas were
probably achieved by 1,500 years ago.
The modern climate of the upper Texas coast, including the region surrounding Houston,
is classified as subtropical humid (Abbott 2001; Larkin and Bomar 1983), forming a transitional
zone between the humid southeastern US and the semiarid to arid west. The climate reflects
the influences of latitude, low elevation, and proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, which combine with
the urban heat island formed by the tremendous concentration of asphalt and concrete to give
the Houston area a notorious modern climate that is oppressively warm and moist throughout
much of the year. As a result of proximity to the Gulf and the abundance of surface water,
humidity in the early morning can approach 100% even on cloudless summer days, and it often
exceeds 50% even on the warmest afternoons. Largely as a consequence of the relatively high
humidity characteristic of the region, temperature patterns exhibit a moderate annual range and
a modest diurnal range that increases slightly with distance from the coast. Average monthly
high temperature ranges from a low of 17 to 19°Celcius (°C) (59 to 63°Fahrenheit [°F]) in
January to a high of 38 to 40°C (89 to 96°F) in August. Average monthly lows range from 4 to
9°C (38 to 47°F) in January to 25 to 29°C (72 to 79°F) in July and August. Annually, average
low temperatures range from 15 to 21°C (56 to 65°F), and average high temperatures range
from 27 to 29°C (75 to 79°F) (Abbott 2001; Larkin and Bomar 1983).
The Houston region experiences 2 precipitation peaks throughout the year (Abbott
2001). The first occurs in the late spring (i.e., May to June) due to the passage of infrequent
cold fronts that spawn chains of powerful frontal thunderstorms. The second occurs in the late
summer to early autumn (i.e., August to September) due to the incidence of tropical storms and
hurricanes from the Atlantic and, occasionally, Pacific oceans. In contrast, winter and early

spring are relatively dry, and high summer rainfall is dominated by convectional thunderstorms
that are relatively brief and localized, albeit frequently intense. Average annual precipitation
varies from a low of approximately 100 centimeters (cm) (40.0 inches [in]) to a high of more than
132.0 cm (52.0 in). Average monthly precipitation varies from less than 5.0 to 8.0 cm (2.0 to
3.0 in) in March to more than 19.0 cm (7.5 in) occurring locally on the coast during September.
Almost all of the measurable precipitation falls as rain—snowfall is extremely rare, occurring in
measurable amounts in only 1 in 10 years.

2.6

FAUNA

The project area is located along the approximate boundary between the southeastern
portion of the Kansan biotic province and the southwestern portion of the Texan biotic province,
and the northern boundary of the Balconian province is located a few counties to the south
(Blair 1950). This is an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and
Carolinian provinces and the grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces
(Dice 1943). Some species reach the limits of their ecological range within the Texan province.
The boundary, characterized as “approximate,” between Blair’s (1950) Texan and Kansan
provinces passes through western Palo Pinto County west of the project area. Rainfall in the
region is barely in excess of water need, and the region is classified by Thornwaite (1948) as a
C2 (moist subhumid) climate with a moisture surplus index of from 0 to 20%.
The fauna associated with this region are represented by a mixture of species from the
Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, Kansan, Balconian, and Texan biotic provinces. At
least 49 species of mammals occur in the Texan province, including Virginia opossum
(Didelphis virginiana), eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus), fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), desert
pocket gopher (Geomys breviceps), fulvous harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens),
white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), eastern
cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), striped skunk (Mephitis
mephitis), white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), black-tailed jackrabbit (Sylvilagus
californicus), ground squirrel (Citellus tridecemlineatus), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
virginiana), hispid pocket mouse (Perognathus hispidus), deer mouse (Peromyscus
maniculatus), black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), pygmy mouse (Baiomys taylori), ninebanded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), and jaguar (Felis onca). Both species of Terrapene
known from the Austroriparian province—eastern box turtle (T. Carolina) and desert box turtle
(T. ornata)—occur in the Texan.
Sixteen species of lizards, including 7 grassland and 9 forest species, are also found,
including green anole (Anolis carolinensis), eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulates),
common ground skink (Leiolopisma laterale), glass snake (Ophiosaurus ventralis [grassland
species]), collared lizard (Crotaphytus collaris), Texas spiny lizard (Sceloporus olivaceous),
Texas horned lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum), and Great Plains skink (Eumeces obsoletus
[forest species]). Only 5 species of urodele fauna are known from this area, including smallmouthed salamander (Ambystoma texanum), tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum), and
eastern lesser siren (Siren intermedia), and the Texan province acts as a barrier to urodele
distribution between the endemic Balconian province fauna to the west and the Austroriparian

16

fauna to the east. Anuran fauna is composed primarily of Austroriparian or otherwise widely
distributed species, including eastern spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus holbrookii), Gulf Coast toad
(Bufo valliceps), Woodhouse’s toad (Bufo woodhousii), southern cricket frog (Acris gryllus),
southern chorus frog (Pseudacris nigrita), gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor), green treefrog (Hyla
cinerea), North American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana), northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens),
and narrow-mouthed toad (Microhyla carolinensis). Additional anuran species that fail to cross
from the Texan into the Austroriparian province include pacific tree frog (Pseudacris clarkia),
Strecker’s chorus frog (Pseudacris streckeri), and striped whipsnake (Microhyla olivacea).
Other reptile and amphibian species common to this biotic zone include 6-lined racerunner
(Aspidoscelis sexlineata), rat snake (Ptyas mucosus), eastern hognose snake (Heterodon
platirhinos), rough green snake (Opheodrys aestivus), copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix),
western diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox), Blanchard’s cricket frog (Acris crepitans),
diamondback water snake (Nerodia rhombifer rhombifer), and Houston toad (Bufo
houstonensis).
Common bird species include northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), eastern
meadowlark (Sturnella magna), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), killdeer (Charadrius
vociferus), field sparrow (Spizella pusilla), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), turkey vulture
(Cathartes aura), belted kingfisher (Ceyrle alcyon), and mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos).
Small herds of bison and antelope were common during the late prehistoric and early
historic periods, but these species are no longer native to this region (Jurney et al. 1989:13-14).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The overall length of the proposed ROW spans 3 different defined archeological/cultural
regions. From west to east, these are the North-Central Texas, Central Texas, and the
Southeast Texas regions. Segment 1 of the proposed ROW extends through the eastern
portion of North-Central Texas region in Scurry, Fisher, Nolan, Taylor, and Callahan counties,
and into the Central Texas Region in Brown County. Segment 2 includes primarily the Central
Texas region along its course through Comanche, Hamilton, Coryell, and Bell counties. Within
Segment 3, the proposed ROW extends through the Central Texas region in Bell and Milam
counties, and enters into the Southeast Texas region in Brazos County. Finally, Segment 4 of
the proposed ROW is wholly contained within the Southeast Texas region along its course
through Grimes, Montgomery, and Harris counties.
The general temporal framework for most prehistoric archeological sites in Texas is
based on the seriation of projectile point types originally established by Suhm et al. (1954) and
later revised by Suhm and Jelks (1962), Prewitt (1981, 1985), and Turner and Hester (1985).
This temporal framework, consisting of a tripartite system based on technological changes in
diagnostic artifacts that occurred as a result of indigenous adaptation to changing environments
and subsistence strategies, is broken down into 3 main periods: the PaleoIndian (pre-8500 BP),
the Archaic (8500 to 1250 BP), and the Late Prehistoric (1250 to 250 BP). The Archaic period
is further subdivided into the Early Archaic (8500 to 6000 BP), the Middle Archaic (6000 BP to
3500 BP), and the Late Archaic (3500 to 1250 BP). While these general temporal periods are
common to each of the 4 archeological/cultural regions traversed by the proposed ROW,
cultural adaptations and subsistence strategies, as well as accepted dates for each temporal
period, vary between each region. With this in mind, the general prehistoric temporal framework
is broken down below, and details relevant to each region are summarized within each of the
temporal periods.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 12,000 BP. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for

HJN 120166 AR

19

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists presently discount claims of much earlier human occupation
during the Pleistocene glacial period (but see Butzer 1988).
North-Central Texas Region
By approximately 11,000 years ago, PaleoIndian populations were present in northcentral Texas. The PaleoIndian occupation of the Upper Trinity River basin is known primarily
through diagnostic projectile points from surface collections or stratigraphically mixed contexts.
The Field Ranch Site (Jensen 1968) along the upper Elm Fork is a primary example of typical
site contexts. Clovis and Plainview points are commonly found along both Denton and Clear
creeks in the Cross Timbers region. The Lewisville Lake Site (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958,
1961) is the best known PaleoIndian site in the region. While the original radiocarbon dates
(circa [ca.] 37,000 BP) contributed to the significance of the site, more recent work (Stanford
1981) has resolved the controversy concerning the date of occupation. It appears that the
presence of naturally occurring lignite as either a fuel in the hearths excavated at the site or an
inadvertent inclusion contaminated the radiocarbon samples. Consequently, the usually
accepted date of 10,000 to 8000 BP for Clovis period occupations is probably a reasonable
estimate for the first human occupation of north-central Texas. Our knowledge of the
subsistence and settlement strategies used by these early occupants is extremely limited.
However, recent excavations at the Aubrey Site (Ferring 1989), a well-preserved Clovis period
site in Denton County, indicate that subsistence efforts did not focus on big game animals
alone; rather, the entire range of prairie and forest species was exploited. Whether this pattern
of a more generalized foraging subsistence system is characteristic of Clovis adaptations in the
Eastern Woodlands, and the focus on now-extinct big game species is more characteristic of a
Plains adaptation, remains to be documented.
While some PaleoIndian sites are known within this region, few have been adequately
examined (Preston 1972, 1974). The Lewisville Lake Site (Crook and Harris 1957; Stanford
1981, 1982), the Murphy Site (Texas Archeological Research Laboratory [TARL] archives), and
the Quince Site (Perttula 1994) are the only sites that have been examined in any detail. The
examination by Story (1990:176-210) of the distribution of finds of PaleoIndian projectile points
has revealed some interesting spatial and chronological trends. Clovis points cluster along the
Red River, within the Upper Trinity River drainage, and in southeastern Texas. Folsom points,
which are probably indicative of a Plains adaptation, are not well represented; rather, Dalton or
Dalton-like points are well represented in the Ouachita Mountains of western Oklahoma and
eastern Arkansas and on the adjacent Gulf Coastal Plain. Story (1990:196) postulates that this
concentration may reflect ecological or territorial factors between 10,500 and 9500 BP. San
Patrice points, which occur within the same time span, are represented but are few in number.
Central Texas Region
The PaleoIndian period is believed to be the earliest cultural occupation in the Central
Texas region. This stage is characterized typologically by the occurrence of distinctive
lanceolate projectile points and highly mobile settlement and exploitation patterns. These
populations probably practiced a foraging (i.e., hunting and gathering) type of subsistence

20

120166_arch_survey_report

A Cultural Resources Assessment of the USACE Jurisdictional Areas along BridgeTex Pipeline
Company, LLC’s Proposed BridgeTex North Pipeline ROW

(Prewitt 1981; Weir 1976), although the best-known sites exhibit a focus on the exploitation of
large mammals, including Mammuthus sp. and Bison antiquus. Investigations at sites such as
the Kincaid Rockshelter, Wilson-Leonard, and Gault have shown that, during the early part of
the Paleo-Indian, the Clovis stage, subsistence included large herbivores (e.g., mammoth,
bison, and horse) as well as smaller animals such as water turtles, badgers, and raccoons. A
multitude of plants are presumed to have also been an important part of the aboriginal diet.
However, during the later part of the Paleo-Indian period, the Folsom and Plainview stages,
subsistence seems to have depended more heavily on the specialized hunting of big game,
particularly bison. This presumption is based on the fact that only camps, stone-working
locations, and kill sites, mostly in or near grassland habitats, have been documented (Collins
1995:382). This change was most likely attributable to the climate, which had become warmer
and drier than the previous Clovis stage.
Southeast Texas Region
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Southeast Texas is
represented by the PaleoIndian period (12,000 to 7000 BP) (Patterson 1995). This stage
coincided with ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that
witnessed the extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing
various periods within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often
fluted, lanceolate projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred endscrapers, gravers, and bone foreshafts.
PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized into egalitarian bands
consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic subsistence and settlement
pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence patterns in Southeast Texas
are known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence focused on the
exploitation of small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the PaleoIndian period. There is
little evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as has been documented
elsewhere in North America; rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern appears to have been
practiced during all prehistoric time periods.
In Southeast Texas, the PaleoIndian stage is divided into 2 periods based on
recognizable differences in projectile point styles (Patterson 1995). These include the Early
PaleoIndian period (12,000 to 10,000 BP), which is recognized based on large, fluted projectile
points (i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late PaleoIndian
period (10,000 to 7000 BP), which is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview,
Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD
North-Central Texas Region

With the end of the Ice Age, the prehistoric residents of north-central Texas began to
develop into localized populations of efficient hunter-gatherers, exploiting localized resource
bases. This period, and the subsistence pattern that characterizes it, has come to be known as

HJN 120166 AR

21

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

the Archaic. The Archaic represents a long period of time that is characterized by only gradual
and minor changes in subsistence patterns, lithic technology, and projectile point styles. It was
apparently a period of strong cultural stability. Archaic populations are usually characterized as
generalized hunter-gatherers with more limited geographic ranges than preceding PaleoIndian
peoples. There is presently no evidence for the development of local cultigens during the
Archaic period in Texas; this is, however, not the case for the Ozark Highlands and other parts
of the eastern United States.
Although Archaic period components have been observed on many sites in the region
(Perttula and Nathan 1989), our knowledge of the Archaic period in the Upper Trinity River
basin has been severely hindered by the lack of data from single-component or stratified sites.
Important exceptions to this situation include the Packard, Bell, Gregory E. Johnson, Beaver,
Lamas Branch, Hill, McKensie, and Mahaffey sites in Oklahoma; the Tankersley Creek, Jake
Martin, and Yarbrough sites in Texas; and the Stark and Old Martin Place sites in Arkansas.
Recent investigations along the West Fork of the Trinity River (Peter and McGregor 1988; Yates
and Ferring 1986) indicate that primary contexts for Early and Middle Archaic sites are found
deeply buried within floodplain alluvium. Artifacts from these periods occur on terrace surfaces,
but they are frequently mixed with later materials. In fact, the initial treatment of the Archaic
period (Crook and Harris 1952, 1954), which defined the Carrollton and Elam foci, was based
upon materials recovered from such terrace contexts. Consequently, these time-space
constructs are no longer recognized as acceptable for north-central Texas (Peter and McGregor
1988; Prikryl 1987; Yates and Ferring 1986).
Recent investigations at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) and at Lake Ray
Roberts (Baird et al. 1982; Bousman and Verrett 1973; Ferring and Yates 1997; Prikryl and
Yates 1987; Skinner and Baird 1979; Yates and Ferring 1986) indicate that the Late Archaic
period is characterized by assemblages left by small bands of foraging hunters and gatherers
who occupied a locality for a limited period of time on a seasonal basis. Deer and numerous
small mammals were the primary food resources. Large pits, known as Willey Focus pits,
appear in the archeological record during the Late Archaic period. The function of these pits is
not entirely clear, although excavation of one such feature at the Sister Grove Creek site in the
East Fork of the Trinity River basin (Lynott 1975) revealed the presence of 13 features within
the pit fill, including 2 burials (one human and one dog), hearths, and small refuse pits. Based
on these excavations, it was hypothesized that the Sister Grove Creek pit could be interpreted
as the remains of a structure in which the entire community participated in ritual feasting. The
documentation of large pits associated with Late Archaic period sites in the Richland/Chambers
Creek drainage (Bruseth and Martin 1987) further suggests that important sociopolitical
changes may have been occurring during this time period. Unfortunately, the significance of
these pits remains an enigma despite their excellent documentation.
Central Texas Region
The Archaic period, which covers 2/3 of Central Texas prehistory (Collins 1995), is
divided into 3 subperiods: Early (8000 to 5000 BP), Middle (5000 to 3000 BP), and Late (3000
to 1200 BP) (Hester 1986). The beginning of the Archaic period in Texas represents a similar

transition found world-wide at approximately the same time, the most noted indicators being the
extinction of Pleistocene megafauna and climatic changes. In Texas, there was a gradual
decrease in moisture and humidity reflecting the intensification of warming and drying trends
first noted during the Clovis-Folsom transition. An often-quoted response to these climatic
changes was a greater and more varied use of local resources; in actuality, this was already the
case in most places. Plant-processing implements such as manos and metates and earth
ovens become more evident in the archeological record, while the hunting of game continued.
Although still nomadic, people of the Archaic period restricted their travel to smaller areas than
did the PaleoIndian groups.
The Early Archaic, the least understood period, is distinguished by the switch from
PaleoIndian lanceolate-shaped points to notched-and-stemmed points. Overall, the Early
Archaic patterns in Texas are fairly similar throughout the state. Hester (1989) observed that,
prior to 5000 BP, the late Holocene hunters and foragers were essentially indistinguishable in
terms of subsistence strategies across Region 3, which includes the Central Texas Plateau
Prairie, South Texas Plains, and Lower Pecos Canyon lands. After that date, regionally
distinctive projectile points emerge. Hughes (1991) also noted similarities when he wrote that
the Early Archaic typological developments on the Texas High Plains resembled developments
in Central and Southwestern Texas as well as in other bordering regions.
Although settlement patterns for the Early Archaic are little known, it is assumed that the
population density was low and organized into small bands practicing a mobile, generalized
subsistence and settlement pattern. The wide distribution of artifacts suggests that mobility was
high and territories relatively undefined. McKinney (1981), among others, has noted that the
distribution of Early Archaic sites was apparently concentrated along the Balcones Escarpment.
This phenomenon may possibly reflect the greater availability of water resources along this
feature during an arid climatic interval (Hester 1989).
Sites containing Early Archaic components are open campsites such as Loeve, WilsonLeonard, Richard Beene, Sleeper, Landslide, Granberg II, Jetta Court, and Hall’s Cave. Lithic
materials found within these components include grinding implements, hammerstones, projectile
points, a variety of unifacial and bifacial chipped stone instruments, and Clear Fork and
Guadalupe bifaces. The Clear Fork tools, although indicative primarily of the Early Archaic,
actually appeared in the Late Paleo-Indian period and, in some regions, lingered into Late
Archaic and Late Prehistoric times (Hughes 1991).
The Middle Archaic is marked by an increased number of sites, which may reflect an
expanding population, the development of regionally distinct cultural patterns, and changes in
settlement, technology, social systems, and territorial boundaries (Black and McGraw 1985:38).
Hester (1986) suggests that, during this period, the inhabitants of the Balcones Escarpment
region developed specialized adaptations to the hunting and gathering of abundant regional
resources, particularly acorns and white-tailed deer.
Site types include open campsites located near streams or tributaries, lithic workshops in
upland areas, and special-activity sites such as hunting camps or food-processing stations
(Black and McGraw 1985). Large burned rock features (hearths and rock ovens) of the early

HJN 120166 AR

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

part of the Middle Archaic gave way in the later Middle Archaic to burned rock middens (Collins
1995).
These latter features have been interpreted as representing several different
subsistence practices. For example, Hester (1986) proposed that they represent intensive
utilization of acorns, while Johnson and Goode (1994:26) suggested that they were more
frequently being used to cook xerophytes such as sotol. This latter explanation has been
supported by a number of recent investigations where evidence of preserved camas bulbs have
been recovered within oven and midden contexts (Brownlow 2003, 2004a, 2004b; Bush 2004;
Dering 1999, 2002; Mauldin et al. 2003; Ricklis and Collins 1994). Middle Archaic projectile
points include Nolan, Travis, Langtry, and Pedernales (Black 1989), the latter of which is
considered by Hester (1986) to be diagnostic of this time period in the Balcones Escarpment
region.
The Late Archaic is represented by a continuation, and possibly intensification, of the
subsistence patterns seen in the Middle Archaic (Hester 1986; Collins 1995). The use of
burned rock midden sites continued throughout the Middle Archaic, peaking during the latter
part of this period (Collins 1995). Large cemetery sites are first noted during the Late Archaic
and may reflect the establishment of territories and subsistence schedules (Black 1989:30;
Black and McGraw 1985; Story 1985:49). Hester (1986) suggests that the development of
wide-ranging trade contacts also may have occurred around this time. Characteristic projectile
points include triangular types such as Lange, Montell, Castroville, and Marcos, along with
smaller, expanding-stem points such as Ensor, Frio, Darl, and Fairland.
Although Hester (1986) places the Late Archaic between 3000 and 1400 BP, a later
carving of the Archaic period by Johnson and Goode (1994) attempts to push back the initiation
point of the Late Archaic to around 4300 BP. This more recent division is based on what is
seen as a strong continuity between the material culture and subsistence practices of groups
utilizing the Pedernales point style and those utilizing the later Montell point style. Primarily,
Johnson and Goode (1994) point to similarities in the blade shape of these 2 styles, as well as
similar large, billet-thinned knives utilized during the times of these point styles. They also note
the continuance of Pedernales period plant baking within existing burned rock middens by later
groups utilizing Montell points. In fact, they view this continuity as evidence of a distinct culture
or “folk” on the eastern Edwards Plateau.
In addition to attempting to push back the initiation date of the Late Archaic period,
Johnson and Goode (1994) have also attempted to further divide the Late Archaic period into 2
subperiods (Late Archaic I and Late Archaic II) based on the material cultures as well as climatic
conditions. Their Late Archaic I subperiod coincides with the Dry Edwards Interval when xeric
conditions persisted between 4300 and 2600 BP. Diagnostic projectile points of this subperiod
include the Bulverde, Pedernales, Marshall, Montell, and Castroville styles. The Lange style
may also correspond to this subperiod based on the recovery of Lange specimens in
association with both Montell and Castroville specimens at 41WM815 and dated between 2800
to 2400 BP (Brownlow 2003). Johnson and Goode (1994:34) note that burned rock middens on
the Edwards Plateau during the Late Archaic I subperiod are more frequent than in any other
period. The increase in burned rock middens during this subperiod is undoubtedly a result of
the xeric climatic conditions that effectively expanded the ranges of certain geophytes such as

24

120166_arch_survey_report

A Cultural Resources Assessment of the USACE Jurisdictional Areas along BridgeTex Pipeline
Company, LLC’s Proposed BridgeTex North Pipeline ROW

sotol and yucca: foodstuffs that require extended baking periods (in stone-lined ovens) in order
to break down their starches into edible simple sugars. The xeric conditions likely resulted in
the spread of grasslands on the plateau, which would have in turn attracted herds of buffalo.
Plentiful geophytic plants, as well as the presence of buffalo herds, may account for an increase
in human populations in the region as well (Weir 1976; Prewitt 1985).
Johnson and Goode’s (1994) Late Archaic II subperiod spans the time period between
2600 and 1400 BP. They equate this subperiod to more mesic climatic conditions that resulted
in the active aggradation of floodplains at many localities. The Marcos, Ensor, Frio, and Darl
dart point styles are viewed as indicators of this subperiod. Observing a break in the broad
blade stylistic tradition suggested for the Pedernales and Montell styles, Johnson and Goode
(1994:37) suggest that similarities in the Marcos style dart points to styles on the Southern
Plains may indicate an influx of new occupants from the Southern Plains or perhaps a borrowing
of projectile making techniques from this region. In addition to a perceived influx of new people
or technologies, Johnson and Goode (1994) also suggest some degree of social intercourse
with groups from the eastern US. This is evidenced by the recovery of materials such as whelk
shells and atlatl weights of exotic stone from burials dating to this time period. Although not
conclusive, Johnson and Goode (1994:37) suggest that these materials may indicate a
spreading of Eastern religious cult ideas into the region. While it cannot be conclusively stated
that groups on the Edwards Plateau subscribed to the beliefs and practices of the Eastern
religions, the evidence does suggest that groups on the plateau participated in extensive trading
with Eastern groups, primarily contributing large, thin corner-tanged knives made from local
Edwards chert.
Southeast Texas Region
The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend signaled the beginning of the Archaic stage
(7000 to 1900 BP) (Patterson 1995). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant
reorientation of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less
pronounced in Southeast Texas.
Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and
corresponding decrease in the big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a
diversified resource base composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Southeast Texas,
however, this hunting and gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The
appearance of a more diversified tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone
assemblage, and a general decrease in the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural
stage. Material culture shows greater diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in
the application of groundstone technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
In Southeast Texas, the Early Archaic period (7000 to 5000 BP) is marked by the presence of
Bell, Carrollton, Morrill, Trinity, Wells, and miscellaneous Early Stemmed projectile points. The
Bell point is the only type in this period that is closely associated with the Southern Plains.
Many of the latter point types continue into the Middle Archaic period (5000 to 3500 BP) and
several new types appear, including Bulverde, Lange, Pedernales, Williams, Travis, and

HJN 120166 AR

25

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

probably the Gary-Kent series. The Late Archaic period (3500 to 1900 BP) is characterized by
Gary, Kent, Darl, Yarbrough, Ensor, Ellis, Fairland, Palmillas, and Marcos points.
In the western part of inland Southeast Texas, a Late Archaic mortuary tradition
developed in the lower Brazos and Colorado river valleys and in the intervening area (Hall 1981;
Patterson 1995). Organized burial practices actually started during the Middle Archaic period
but reached full development in the Late Archaic with the use of exotic grave goods such as
boatstones and bannerstones (probably used as atlatl weights), stone gorgets, corner-tang
knives, stingray spines, shark teeth, and marine shell beads and pendants. Other burial
practices included the systematic orientation of burial direction, body position, use of red ochre,
and use of locally made grave goods, such as longbone implements and bone pins. Most
burials are found in extended supine position, though some extended prone and bundle burials
are also known. Burial direction is usually consistent within single sites but varies from site to
site. Patterson et al. (1993) report that at least 11 sites are associated with this mortuary
tradition in Austin, Fort Bend, and Wharton counties.
While the advent of ceramics and the bow and arrow is generally viewed as the end of
the Archaic Period and the initiation of the Late Prehistoric Period throughout the majority of
Texas, evidence of the use of ceramics/pottery is actually present in the Southeast Texas
Region toward the end of the Archaic Period, prior to the introduction of the bow and arrow.
The presence of ceramics alongside Archaic Period tool kits defines the Early Ceramic Period
(1900 to 1400 BP) in Southeast Texas between the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods.
The use of pottery did not start uniformly throughout Southeast Texas. Pottery
manufacture appears to have diffused into this region from adjacent regions, primarily from the
east along the coastal margin. Aten (1983:297) argues that pottery was being manufactured on
the coastal margin of the Texas-Louisiana border by about 2100 BP, in the Galveston Bay area
by about 1900 BP, in the western part of the coastal margin by about 1700 BP, and in the
Conroe-Livingston inland area by about 1500 BP. The practice of pottery manufacture appears
to have progressed first along the coastal margin and then moved inland (Patterson 1995).
Southeastern Texas ceramic chronologies are best known in the Galveston Bay area, where
Aten (1983) established a detailed chronological sequence.
The earliest ceramic periods in the Galveston Bay and neighboring Sabine Lake areas
appear to be approximately contemporaneous with the earliest ceramic periods of the lower
Mississippi Valley (Aten 1984). Early assemblages contain substantial quantities of Tchefuncte
ceramics. In the Sabine Lake region, grog-tempered varieties of Baytown Plain and Marksville
Stamped are common, while grog-tempered ceramics do not occur in the Galveston Bay area
80 miles (129.0 km) to the west until several hundred years later. With the principal exception
of a few Tchefuncte ceramic types, other southern Louisiana ceramics are not found on the Gulf
coast west of the Sabine Lake area.
Goose Creek sandy-paste pottery was used throughout Southeast Texas and somewhat
farther north in the Early Ceramic, Late Prehistoric, and the early part of the Historic periods
(Aten 1984; Patterson 1995; Perttula et al. 1995). The Goose Creek series is the primary utility
ware throughout the prehistoric sequence in Southeast Texas, though it gives way to Baytown

Plain for about 200 years during the transition between the Late Prehistoric and Historic periods
before once again becoming predominant into the Historic period (Aten 1984). A minor variety,
Goose Creek Stamped, occurs only in the Early Ceramic period (Aten 1983). Three other minor
pottery types—Tchefuncte (Plain and Stamped), Mandeville, and O’Neal Plain variety Conway
(Aten 1983)—were used only during the Early Ceramic period. The Mandeville and Tchefuncte
types are characterized by contorted paste and poor coil wedging. Mandeville has sandy paste
(like Goose Creek), while Tchefuncte paste has relatively little sand. Given their technological
similarities, Mandeville and Tchefuncte may represent different clay sources rather than distinct
pottery types (Patterson 1995). The bone-tempered pottery that characterizes ceramic
assemblages elsewhere in Texas is not common in Southeast Texas.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD
North-Central Texas Region

The beginning of the Late Prehistoric period in the Upper Trinity River basin is marked
by the appearance of arrow points. The initial date of 1300 BP for this period is based upon
dated contexts to the west in the Brazos River drainage. Lynott (1977) suggests that the Late
Prehistoric period may be divided into early and late phases. The early phase is characterized
by sand- and grog-tempered ceramics, Scallorn and Alba arrow points, and a continuation of the
foraging subsistence system of the Late Archaic period. The late phase reflects a Southern
Plains influence with the appearance of Nocona Plain ceramics of the Henrietta Focus, various
unstemmed triangular projectile points (e.g., Fresno, Harrell, Washita), and the Perdiz point.
Evidence of horticulture and the procurement of bison also appears in sites of this period (Harris
and Harris 1970; Morris and Morris 1970).
Recent investigations of the Cobb-Pool Site at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor
1988) have resulted in a reformulation of the Late Prehistoric period. The Cobb-Pool Site
yielded house structures, roasting pits, Alba points, grog-tempered ceramics, and charred corn
cupules. Radiocarbon dates from several features indicate that the site was occupied during
the late 12th or early 13th century. Present evidence suggests that the site does not represent
an intrusive Caddoan occupation; consequently, a significant adaptive change appears to have
occurred during a middle phase of the Late Prehistoric period. It is also likely that ceramics
were not introduced into the region before this time. Whether the Cobb-Pool Site merely
represents a local anomaly or reflects a regional adaptive change remains to be documented.
Central Texas Region
The Late Prehistoric period in Central Texas is separated from the preceding Archaic by
the introduction of the bow and arrow and ceramics. Two phases are recognized within this
period: the Austin (ca. 1400 to 800 BP) and Toyah (ca. 800 to 400 BP) phases. The Austin
phase is characterized by the transition from the use of the atlatl and dart to that of the bow and
arrow and arrow points, particularly the expanding-stemmed Scallorn type. This phase is also
distinguished by a decline in population and changes in settlement practices, in which there was
a shift from open to protected (rockshelter) sites (Black 1989:32; Collins 1995:385). In spite of
these changes, most archeologists agree that Late Archaic subsistence practices and

HJN 120166 AR

27

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

settlement patterns appear to have continued during the Austin phase (Black 1989; Collins
1995; Prewitt 1974).
The Toyah phase is characterized by relatively rapid changes in technology, notably
pottery (both local and imported from the Caddo area); large, thin bifaces; Perdiz (contractingstem) arrow points; and prismatic blades (Black 1989; Collins 1995). Limited horticulture may
also have begun during this time. The Toyah tool kit was associated with the hunting of bison,
deer, and antelope, and, although nearly all sites dating to this phase have yielded bison bones,
deer was the most significant faunal resource during this time (Black 1989:32). Evidence for
agriculture is seen in the occasional corn cob found at sites such as the Timmeron Rockshelter
in Hays County. Of course, the corn could also be attributed to the same trade network that
was bringing in the Caddoan pottery.
Southeast Texas Region
The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (1400 to 500 BP) (Patterson 1995) in Southeast
Texas is defined by the appearance of the bow and arrow. Elsewhere in Texas, pottery also
appears during the latter part of the Late Prehistoric period, but, as already discussed, ceramics
appear earlier in Southeast Texas. Along the coastal margin of Southeast Texas, use of the
atlatl (i.e., spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric
period, though they continued to be used in the inland subregion along with the bow and arrow
through the Late Prehistoric period (Ensor and Carlson 1991; Keller and Weir 1979; Patterson
1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In fact, Patterson (1995:254) proposes that use of the bow and
arrow started in Southeast Texas as early as the end of the Middle Archaic period, using
unifacial arrow points that consisted of marginally retouched flakes. In contrast, Prewitt (1981)
argues for a generalized date of adoption of the bow-and-arrow hunting system at about the
same time (ca. 1400 BP) in Central and Southeast Texas. In Southeast Texas, unifacial arrow
points appear to be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. Bifacial arrow point
types include Alba, Catahoula, Perdiz, and Scallorn.
Grog- (i.e., crushed-sherd-) tempered pottery was used in the Late Prehistoric and
Protohistoric periods in Southeast Texas. The grog-tempered varieties include San Jacinto
Plain and Baytown Plain variety Phoenix Lake. San Jacinto pottery contains a relatively small
proportion of small-sized temper, while Baytown Plain has larger amounts of sherd pieces that
are often visible on vessel surfaces. As previously mentioned, sandy-paste Goose Creek
pottery remained in use throughout the Late Prehistoric period. Rockport Plain and Asphalt
Coated pottery from the Central Texas Coast (Ricklis 1995) are found at a few sites in
Southeast Texas during the Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric periods.

3.4

PROTOHISTORIC PERIOD
North-Central Texas Region

Historical documentation and archeological evidence are very sparse for the
Protohistoric period in the Upper Trinity River basin. Tonkawa, Wichita, Caddo, and Comanche
all are likely to have traversed the area; however, the locations of their sites and detailed

28

120166_arch_survey_report

A Cultural Resources Assessment of the USACE Jurisdictional Areas along BridgeTex Pipeline
Company, LLC’s Proposed BridgeTex North Pipeline ROW

ethnohistoric data are almost nonexistent. Although European trade items (Sollberger 1953)
appear on a limited number of sites, no protohistoric site has been thoroughly investigated, and
characterizations of Native American adaptations during this time period are conjectural at best.
A lack of documentary evidence, together with a lack of interest among ethnologists and
archeologists, has contributed to this situation.
By the 18th century, immigrant Plains Indian groups had moved into and beyond northcentral Texas, and their documentation by traders and explorers marks the start of the
Protohistoric period. Documentary sources suggest that the Apache, Caddo, Comanche,
Delaware, Kickapoo, Kitsai, Tonkawa, Wichita, and Yojaune traversed the region at various
times during the period (Campbell 1988; Newcomb 1961; Newcomb and Campbell 1982);
however, archeological sites that can be associated definitely with historic groups are few. The
Wichita are known to have moved into Texas from Oklahoma and Kansas in the early 1700s.
Sites attributable to the Wichita have been identified at the edges of north-central Texas.
Among these is the Stansbury site in Hill County, now inundated by Lake Whitney (Stephenson
1970). Excavations at the site produced burials, house structures, storage pits, and a variety of
aboriginal artifacts, along with European ceramics, glass beads, metal arrow points, and flintlock
musket parts. A cluster of Wichita sites also occurs to the north along the Red River in
Montague County. These sites occur on both the Oklahoma and Texas sides of the river.
Woodall (1967) excavated one of these sites, named the Upper Tucker site, which produced
artifacts and features similar to those discovered at the Stansbury site. Wichita sites both on
the Brazos and Red rivers were situated atop high terraces that overlook the rivers.
Southeast Texas Region
For the most part, Protohistoric and early Historic Indian sites in Southeast Texas have
not been articulated with the ethnographic record (Story 1990:258). Similarly, reconciling the
ethnographic record to prehistoric Indian groups in this region is problematic. Late Prehistoric
and Historic population movements further complicate this issue.
Aten (1983) has
reconstructed the territories of native groups present in this region in the early 18th century,
including the Akokisa, Atakapa, Bidai, Coco (possibly Karankawa), and Tonkawa. The
presence of the Tonkawa in Southeast Texas may be due to their rapid expansion from Central
Texas in the 17th and 18th centuries (Newcomb 1993:27). The Karankawa Indians are thought
to have occupied the coastal margin of this region as far east as Galveston Island and the
corresponding mainland (Aten 1983). Judging by the scarcity of Rockport pottery on sites east
of the San Bernard River, the ethnic association of the Karankawa Indians with the Coco tribe
may be in doubt.
Protohistoric and Historic Indian sites may not be systematically recognized as such
because few aboriginal artifact types changed from the Late Prehistoric to the Historic periods
(Patterson 1995). Only a few non-European artifact types are useful in identifying Historic
Indian sites, including Bulbar Stemmed and Guerrero arrow points and possibly Fresno and
Cuney points after 500 BP (Hudgins 1986). Historic period Indian sites are usually identified by
the presence of glass and metal artifacts, gunflints, and European types of pottery.

3.5

HISTORIC PERIOD
North-Central Texas Region

The first European to visit north-central Texas may have been Luis de Moscoso del
Alvorado. Leading Hernando de Soto’s men after de Soto’s death at the Mississippi River in
1541, de Moscoso may have crossed the Trinity River along its upper reaches (Reese et al.
1986:154), perhaps passing through the Pilot Point area (Lebo 1990:61). During the early
1730s, French traders operating out of New Orleans began entering East Texas. They
“procured buffalo and deer skins,” exchanged firearms and a variety of European trade goods
with Native American groups, stole from the Spanish, and also “captured Apache women and
children, horses, [and] mules” (Richner and Bagot 1978:77). An active trade system was soon
established.
Central Texas Region
The Historic period in Central Texas, which began with the arrival of Europeans into the
region, can be divided into 3 subperiods: early, middle, and late. Only a brief overview of the
period is given here. For a more detailed essay, see Newcomb 1993:1-63.
The first documented arrival of Europeans into Central Texas dates to the early 18th
Century (Newcomb 1993). Their influence, however, preceded their arrival. In the late 17th
Century, natives from northern Mexico and southern Texas began migrating into Central Texas.
This was done in part to escape forced occupation and labor in the Spanish mines, and on
Spanish ranches. During the same time, horses stolen from the Spanish had become an
integral part of the Apache way of life. These mounted, nomadic bison hunters of the High
Plains enjoyed a tremendous advantage over their pedestrian enemies. They terrorized native
groups to the east and southeast of their High Plains homeland, forcing many to flee, some into
Central Texas (Newcomb 1993:2). Thus, the first Europeans into the region encountered native
groups fragmented by the growth of the Spanish missions, the raids of the Apache, and the
diseases that swept before the physical presence of Europeans. When these aboriginal groups
found they had nowhere else to go for protection from the forced labor or to get protection from
some of the more hostile and aggressive groups, they often turned toward the protection the
missions had to offer as a last resort. The accounts the missionaries documented of the Native
American groups they encountered and attempted to convert, do not provide direct analogs to
prehistoric lifeway patterns, but rather represent a time of drastic cultural change (Collins 1995).
A few indigenous cultural patterns may have prevailed through time. Along with large, diffuse
encampments composed of peoples with mixed ethnic affiliations, small band-sized residential
camps, both dating to this particular period, are found in Central Texas (Collins 1995:386).
These latter sites may represent indigenous groups.
The middle Historic subperiod began about 1730 and ended about 1800 as the mission
system was failing (Hester 1989; Collins 1995:386). Historic documents of this period make
reference to remnants of native groups living in the missions, primarily in Bexar County (Collins
1995). Toward the end of this subperiod, the Comanche began to move into Northwestern
Texas from the high plains. Records of their presence in Central Texas at this time tend to be

30

120166_arch_survey_report

A Cultural Resources Assessment of the USACE Jurisdictional Areas along BridgeTex Pipeline
Company, LLC’s Proposed BridgeTex North Pipeline ROW

highly biased since they are provided mostly from the hostile perspective of Anglo settlers
(Collins 1995).
The late Historic subperiod is composed of small numbers of mission Indians, “far flung
nomadic native groups (primarily the Comanche),” and an archeological record of the European
presence (Collins 1995:387). The earliest known historical Native American occupants in
Williamson County were the Tonkawa. The Tonkawa were considered friendly toward the early
settlers of Williamson County. The Tonkawa, the Cherokee, and the Comanche, however, were
decimated by European disease and removed from Texas by 1850. Settlement of the county
increased with communities developing along Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River.
Southeast Texas Region
The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when
Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Álvar Núñez
Cabeza de Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near
Galveston Bay; however, European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until
after 1700. The first half of the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission
system, as well as the first effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native
culture and social systems. This process is clearly discernable at the Mitchell Ridge site, where
the burial data suggest population declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994), as well as
increased participation on the part of the Native American population in the fur trade. By the
time heavy settlement of Texas began in the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous
Indian population was greatly diminished. The Alabama/Coushatta Indians who currently reside
in Southeast Texas are migrants who were displaced from the east in the late 18th to early
19th centuries (Newcomb 1961).

4.0 METHODOLOGY

4.1

INITIAL USACE JURISDICTIONAL AREA DETERMINATION DATA

Under the direction of Zephyr, biologists employed by both Zephyr and Atkins Global
(Atkins) were responsible for the identification of all USACE jurisdictional areas along the length
of the proposed ROW. These areas included wetlands, ponds, and all waters of the US
traversed by the proposed ROW where impacts would require the usage of a NWP during the
construction of the proposed pipeline. The field biologists utilized a naming system that
included a general wetland or crossing identifier (e.g., WET=wetland, CRK=creek, POND=pond,
etc.), a general biological team identifier (e.g., X, Y, Z), and a sequential number identifier of
each USACE jurisdictional area delineated within each county traversed by the proposed ROW.
For example, the first creek encountered within a county by team X would have been labeled
CRK X1.
Subsequent to the USACE jurisdictional determination field efforts, the field data was
compiled into shape files and spreadsheets at Zephyr’s corporate office. Zephyr then provided
Horizon with the compiled shape files and spreadsheets for use during the cultural resources
investigations at each identified USACE jurisdictional area. In all, the biological field team
identified a total of 390 USACE jurisdictional areas along the length of the proposed ROW to be
assessed by Horizon archeologists.

4.2

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Prior to any of the cultural resources field efforts, Horizon conducted archival research
along the entire length of the proposed BridgeTex North pipeline ROW to aid in the initial routing
of the proposed ROW and to allow for any necessary reroutes to avoid any significant or
potentially significant previously recorded archeological sites and all documented cemeteries.
This research, which encompassed the centerline of the proposed ROW as well as a 1.0-mile
(1.6-km) buffer surrounding it, included a review of the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
(Atlas) online database, the National Park Service’s (NPS) NRHP Google Earth map layer, and
a visual inspection of all US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle
maps traversed by the proposed ROW.
Shape files for all previously recorded archeological sites within the 1.0-mile (1.6-km)
review buffer were acquired from the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), while

HJN 120166 AR

33

Chapter 4.0: Methodology

shape files for all documented cemeteries within the review buffer were downloaded from the
THC’s Atlas database. If cemeteries were visually identified within the review buffer during the
review of the USGS topographic quadrangle maps traversed by the proposed ROW, but no
shape files for them existed on the THC’s Atlas database, Horizon GIS personnel created the
necessary shape files. Once the review of the entire ROW was completed, Horizon GIS
personnel then compiled all previously recorded site and cemetery shape files into an overall
project shape file that was then provided to Zephyr for use during project planning.
Although Horizon’s investigations along the proposed BridgeTex North pipeline ROW
focused on USACE jurisdictional areas where the usage of a NWP would be necessary for
construction (i.e., water courses and their immediate associated uplands), the USACE
requested that BridgeTex also take into consideration all previously recorded archeological sites
that might be present within the limits of the proposed ROW outside of the USACE’s jurisdiction
and find ways to avoid or minimize impacts to any listed on the NRHP or with the potential to
qualify for listing on the NRHP. This included previously recorded archeological sites
documented as being eligible or potentially eligible for listing on the NRHP as well as any sites
with a currently undetermined NRHP eligibility status.
Additionally, regardless of any federal agency jurisdiction, the THC requires a
construction buffer of 75.0 feet (22.9 m) around visible cemetery boundaries to ensure the
protection of any unmarked graves that could potentially be present outside of the marked,
present-day cemetery boundaries.
With the USACE and THC requirements in mind, the results of the archival research for
the entire length of the proposed ROW are presented in Chapter 5.0. For clarity and the ease of
identifying any previously documented cultural resources that could be impacted within the
USACE jurisdictional areas along the proposed ROW, the results of the archival research
specific to each USACE jurisdictional area are presented in the results chapter for each of the
proposed ROW segments (Chapters 6.0 through 9.0).

4.3

INTENSIVE PEDESTRIAN SURVEY

Between the months of March and July 2013, Horizon archeologists (typically in 2- to 3person crews) completed the intensive pedestrian survey of the 390 USACE jurisdictional areas
along the proposed ROW that had been previously delineated by biologists under the direction
of Zephyr. For purposes of discussion, the USACE jurisdictional areas consist of each wetland
or waterway crossed by the proposed ROW as well as the associated uplands within 100.0 feet
(30.5 m) of each side (200.0 feet [61.0 m] total). The intensive pedestrian survey efforts
consisted of visual surface inspection coupled with the excavation of subsurface shovel tests.
All shovel tests measured approximately 12.0 inches (30.5 centimeters [cm]) in diameter, and
were excavated to a maximum depth of 3.3 feet (1.0 m) or to sterile pre-Holocene clay,
whichever was encountered first. The TSMASS require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile
for linear projects measuring 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width. As the length of the 390 USACE
jurisdictional areas along the entire length of the proposed ROW total approximately 78,000.0
feet (23,774.4 m) in combined length, a total of 238 shovel tests would have been necessary
within the USACE jurisdictional areas in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded

34

A Cultural Resources Assessment of the USACE Jurisdictional Areas along BridgeTex Pipeline
Company, LLC’s Proposed BridgeTex North Pipeline ROW

the TSMASS by excavating a total of 1,653 shovel tests within the USACE jurisdictional areas
along the overall length of the proposed ROW. In general, the field crews conducted a
minimum 2 shovel tests on opposing sides of each USACE jurisdictional area, resulting in a
minimum of 4 shovel tests total at each. A breakdown of the USACE jurisdictional areas lengths
and number of excavated shovel tests is broken down by ROW segment in Table 4-1. All
excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.0-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or
were trowel-sorted if the dense clay soils prohibited successful screening.

Field notes for each assessed USACE jurisdictional were maintained on terrain,
vegetation, soils, land forms, existing disturbances, shovel tests, cultural material observed (if
any), etc. This was made possible by the utilization of standardized USACE crossing forms that
were completed during the field assessment of each USACE jurisdictional area. These forms
included the relevant crossing identifying information (county, segment, crossing name,
coordinates, and parcel), a description of the location (soils, disturbances, general
observations), the required number of shovel tests, the actual number of excavated shovel
tests, shovel test numbers, photo descriptions and numbers, and a summary of any
documented cultural resources at the location. The forms also included a spot to denote if deep
alluvial soils were present at the location and if additional mechanical trenching efforts would be
necessary. In addition to the USACE crossing forms, standardized shovel test forms were
completed for every excavated shovel test. If any new archeological sites were recorded,
standard site forms were completed and filed at TARL for permanent housing. Similarly, if any

HJN 120166 AR

35

Chapter 4.0: Methodology

previously recorded archeological sites were assessed, updated site forms were completed and
filed at TARL.
A selective collection strategy was utilized during the survey efforts wherein only
diagnostic cultural materials were to be collected for eventual curation at an approved facility or
for return to the appropriate landowner. Non-diagnostic artifacts were to be tabulated and
assessed in the field and placed back where they were found. Digital photographs with a photo
log were completed as appropriate. The locations of all shovel tests were recorded via
handheld global positioning system (GPS) units utilizing the Universal Transverse Mercator
(UTM) coordinate system and the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83) map datum. Shovel
test data are presented in Appendix A. Additionally, the number of shovel tests excavated
within each specific USACE jurisdictional area is presented in association with that USACE
jurisdictional area within the results sections later in this report. Due to the extensive number of
excavated shovel tests, only shovel test locations associated with the discovery and
assessment of archeological sites are presented in figures later in the results sections of this
document.

4.4

MECHANICAL TRENCHING

Within areas of deep alluvium where the potential exists for buried cultural deposits at
depths greater than those accessible via traditional shovel testing methods (i.e., greater than
3.3 feet [1.0 m]), the THC requires deeper subsurface investigations, such as mechanical
trenching, in order to prospect for deeply buried cultural deposits. While Horizon’s field efforts
included the documentation of areas containing alluvial deposits and a determination of the
potential for deeply buried cultural deposits at each USACE jurisdictional area assessed during
the survey-level field efforts, Horizon has yet to be released to conduct any recommended
backhoe trenching efforts for the undertaking.
However, Horizon’s backhoe trenching
recommendations for each assessed USACE jurisdictional area are presented in the results
chapter for each of the proposed ROW segments (Chapters 6.0 through 9.0).

AGENCY REQUIREMENTS AND GENERAL METHODS

Although Horizon’s investigations along the proposed BridgeTex North pipeline ROW
focused on USACE jurisdictional areas where the usage of a NWP would be necessary for
construction (i.e., water courses and their immediate associated uplands), the USACE
requested that BridgeTex also take into consideration all previously recorded archeological sites
that might be present within the limits of the proposed ROW outside of the USACE’s jurisdiction
and find ways to avoid or minimize impacts to any listed on the NRHP or with the potential to
qualify for listing on the NRHP. This included previously recorded archeological sites
documented as being eligible or potentially eligible for listing on the NRHP, as well as any sites
with a currently undetermined NRHP eligibility status.
Additionally, regardless of any federal agency jurisdiction, the THC requires a
construction buffer of 75.0 feet (22.9 m) around visible cemetery boundaries to ensure the
protection of any unmarked graves that could potentially be present outside of the marked,
present-day cemetery boundaries.
With the USACE and THC requirements in mind, Horizon initially conducted archival
research along the entire length of the proposed BridgeTex North pipeline ROW to aid in the
initial routing of the proposed ROW and to allow for any necessary reroutes to avoid any
significant or potentially significant previously recorded archeological sites and all documented
cemeteries. This research, which encompassed the centerline of the proposed ROW as well as
a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) buffer surrounding it, included a review of the THC’s Texas Archeological
Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database (THC 2013), the National Park Service’s (NPS) NRHP
Google Earth map layer (NPS 2013), and a visual inspection of all USGS 7.5-minute
topographic quadrangle maps traversed by the proposed ROW.

5.2

RESULTS

The results of this overall ROW review are summarized relevant to each segment/county
in Tables 5-1 through 5-18 below. Additionally, any previously recorded archeological sites or
cemeteries within 1.0 miles (1.6 km) of any of the 390 delineated USACE jurisdictional areas
are included in the results sections for each ROW segment presented later in this document.

SUMMARY
Previously Recorded Archeological Sites

As can be seen in the tables presented above, a total of 7 previously recorded
archeological sites are located on or adjacent to the proposed ROW within the various
segments. Each of these sites is discussed below with respect to the pipeline segment in which
it is located. Other than the 7 noted archeological sites, no other previously recorded

48

120166_arch_survey_report

A Cultural Resources Assessment of the USACE Jurisdictional Areas along BridgeTex Pipeline
Company, LLC’s Proposed BridgeTex North Pipeline ROW

archeological sites are located within 50.0 feet (15.2 m) of the proposed ROW centerline. As
the overall width of the proposed ROW, inclusive of extra work spaces, will measure no more
than 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width (50.0 feet [15.2 m] either side of the proposed centerline), the
undertaking has no potential to affect any previously recorded archeological sites located more
than 50.0 feet (15.2 m) away from the proposed centerline.

Segment 1
A total of 3 sites, or portions of them, are located on the centerline of Segment 1 of the
proposed ROW. The first of these, site 41FS52, has no site form available on the Atlas
database, so its site type and NRHP eligibility status are currently unknown (Figure 5-1; see
also Table 5-2). It was Horizon’s opinion that this site should be assessed prior to construction
or that the ROW be rerouted to the south to avoid any impacts to the site.
The second site on the Segment 1 ROW is 41NL209 (Figure 5-2; see also Table 5-3).
This site was documented as a surficial prehistoric lithic scatter that represents an upland lithic
procurement area. Based on the lack of buried deposits, this site was determined to be
ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP. As it is not considered to be a significant archeological
site, it was Horizon’s opinion that no avoidance measures or additional investigations were
necessary at this location relative to the current pipeline project.
The third site within the Segment 1 ROW is 41TA248 (Figure 5-3; see also Table 5-4). It
was documented as an upland prehistoric campsite within a plowed cotton field. Based on the
lack of buried deposits and temporally diagnostic materials, this site was determined to be
ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP. As it is not considered to be a significant archeological
site, it was again Horizon’s opinion that no avoidance measures or additional investigations
were necessary at this location relative to the current pipeline project.

Segment 2
Only 1 previously recorded archeological site is located on the centerline of Segment 2
of the proposed ROW. This site, 41CV275, was minimally documented as an extensive
prehistoric campsite located on the southwest bank and terrace of the Leon River within the
small town of Ater, Texas (Figure 5-4, see also Table 5-9). As can be seen in Figure 5-4, the
proposed ROW extends across the extreme southeastern corner of this site. Although it was
minimally documented, the recorder recommended test excavations on this site. Because its
NRHP eligibility status is considered to be undetermined, it was Horizon’s opinion that this site
should be assessed prior to construction or that the ROW be rerouted to the south to avoid any
impacts to the site.

Segment 3
Two previously recorded archeological sites are located on or immediately adjacent to
the centerline within Segment 3 of the proposed ROW. The first, 41MM133, was originally
recorded in 1978 as a light prehistoric lithic scatter on a large sandy knoll west of the Brazos
River (Figure 5-5; see also Table 5-13). While lithic debitage and burned rock fragments were
noted on the site, little else was noted on the site form for this site other than locational data.

However, the site recorder did indicate that no further work was recommended on the site. With
this in mind, it was assumed to be ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP. This site is located near
a proposed HDD bore entry/exit pit associated with the current undertaking on the west side of
the Brazos River. Although it was assumed to be ineligible based on the original recorder’s
information, deposits associated with this site were anticipated in the vicinity of the noted HDD
bore entry/exit location.
The second site, 41RT17, was documented as a prehistoric campsite situated on
3 separate knolls on the east bank the Little Brazos River (Figure 5-6; see also Table 5-14).
Survey-level efforts on this site documented chert flaking debris, burned and unburned bone,
mussel shell, a projectile point tip, and 1 possible ceramic sherd. The original recorders of this
site recommended additional testing investigations on this site to assess the buried soil horizons
and to determine if midden deposits were present. As these investigations have yet to be
conducted, the NRHP eligibility status of this site is considered to be undetermined. This site is
located within a delineated USACE jurisdictional area (CRK C1_WEST) and was targeted for
assessment during the current survey-level efforts.

Segment 4
One previously recorded archeological site is located immediately adjacent to the
centerline within Segment 4 of the proposed ROW. This site, 41GM5, was originally recorded
as the remains of a historic farmstead, syrup press, community school, and slave quarters
associated with the original Stephen F. Austin colony (Figure 5-7; see also Table 5-16). The
structures associated with this site are located a considerable distance to the southwest of the
currently proposed centerline, and another existing ROW (Texas Express) is located between
the structures and currently proposed ROW. A reevaluation of the portion of this site within the
existing Texas Express ROW in 2012, inclusive of metal-detecting efforts, found no cultural
deposits associated with this site in the Texas Express ROW, suggesting a decreased potential
for any cultural deposits within the current proposed ROW located to the northeast. Regardless,
it was Horizon’s opinion that the portion of the ROW near this site should be assessed prior to
construction or that the ROW be rerouted to the northeast to avoid any impacts to the site.
Cemeteries
As previously noted, the THC requires a construction buffer of 75.0 feet (22.9 m) around
visible cemetery boundaries to ensure the protection of any unmarked graves that could
potentially be present outside of the marked, present-day cemetery boundaries. Of all the
cemeteries noted within 1.0 miles (1.6 km) of the proposed ROW centerline, only 1 was located
within 75.0 feet (22.9 m) of the proposed centerline. During the early phases of the proposed
ROW alignment, the Bickham Cemetery (BZ-C0245) was located approximately 40.0 feet (12.2
m) northeast of the proposed Segment 3 centerline in Brazos County, Texas (Figure 5-8; see
also Table 5-15). Horizon recommended that the proposed ROW centerline be shifted an
additional 35.0 feet (10.7 m) to the southwest in order to maintain the requisite 75.0 feet (22.9
m) construction buffer away from the visible cemetery boundaries. BridgeTex complied with
these recommendations and actually shifted the proposed ROW 100.0 feet (30.5 m) southwest
of the visible cemetery boundaries.

6.0 RESULTS – SEGMENT 1

6.1

GENERAL FINDINGS

Segment 1 of the proposed BridgeTex North ROW measures approximately 131.0 miles
(210.8 km) in length and extends through Scurry, Fisher, Nolan, Taylor, Callahan, and Brown
counties, Texas (see Figures 1-1 and 1-2). Within Segment 1, biologists under the direction of
Zephyr identified a total of 45 USACE jurisdictional areas where a NWP will be necessary for
the construction of the proposed pipeline. These 45 USACE jurisdictional areas have a
combined overall length of 9000.0 feet (2743.2.4 m). The TSMASS require a minimum of
16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width. As the length
of the 45 USACE jurisdictional areas within Segment 1 of the proposed ROW total
approximately 9000.0 feet (2743.2.4 m) in combined length, a total of 27 shovel tests would
have been necessary within the USACE jurisdictional areas in order to comply with the
TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 195 shovel tests within the
USACE jurisdictional areas within Segment 1 of the proposed ROW.
Due to the high number of assessed USACE jurisdictional areas along the length of
Segment 1, it would be impractical, as well as redundant, to discuss the results of the cultural
resources survey of every single location, especially when the survey produced negative results
at the majority of them. Therefore, to aid in an expeditious review of the results by permitting
agencies, the results for each assessed USACE jurisdictional area where a NWP permit will be
necessary for pipeline construction are summarized in tabular format in Table 6-1. This table
presents: (1) the name and type of each assessed USACE jurisdictional area; (2) previously
documented cultural resources within 0.5 miles (0.8 km) of each location; (3) the number of
shovel tests excavated at each location; (4) a brief description and NRHP eligibility
determination of assessed archeological sites at each location, if any; (5) a brief description of
the soils at each location and a notation regarding the potential for deeply buried cultural
deposits; and finally (6) Horizon’s recommendations pertaining to the need for avoidance
measures or additional investigations, including backhoe trenching efforts.
While the presentation of the results in tabular format will aid in the presentation of the
negative data, it is not sufficient for a thorough presentation of the positive results. With this in
mind, all newly recorded archeological sites are thoroughly discussed in Section 6.2 of this
chapter, and any previously recorded archeological sites that were assessed are discussed in
Section 6.3. Recommendations for mechanical trenching efforts are summarized in Section 6.4.

6.2

NEWLY RECORDED ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES

The cultural resources survey of the 45 USACE jurisdictional areas within Segment 1 of
the proposed BridgeTex North pipeline ROW where a NWP will be necessary for construction
resulted in the documentation of 3 newly recorded archeological sites (41CA26, 41NL311, and
41TA314). These sites are discussed separately below.
6.2.1

Site 41CA26

General Description
Site 41CA26 represents the remains of a low-density aboriginal lithic scatter located
1.5 miles (2.4 km) to the south of the intersection of County Road (CR) 475 and Farm-to-Market
Road (FM) 2287 near Cross Plains in Callahan County, Texas. The site is situated to the south
of a pond fed by an unnamed tributary to West Prong Burnt Branch (USACE jurisdictional area
POND W16) at an elevation of 1750.0 feet (533.5 m) amsl (Figures 6-1 and 6-2). An existing
pipeline ROW is located immediately south of the site (see Figure 6-2). The vegetation in the
surrounding area consists of cacti, yucca, and short wild grasses with scattered patches of Ashe
juniper and mesquite trees (Figure 6-3). As documented during the current survey, site 41CA26
measures 1115.2 feet (340.0 m) in length by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width within the proposed
ROW. The site boundaries were documented only within the proposed ROW.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41CA26 consist entirely of aboriginal lithic
specimens. The observed lithic assemblage includes approximately 20 primary, secondary, and
tertiary flakes; 5 biface fragments; 10 core fragments; and 1 possible scraper (Figures 6-4). All
of the materials observed on 41CA26 were manufactured from light gray to grayish-brown,
medium-grained chert. Aside from the observed lithic specimens, no temporally diagnostic
formal tools, preserved floral or faunal remains, or thermally altered rocks were noted on the
site.
Cultural Features
No cultural features were observed on the modern ground surface on the site, and no
evidence of subsurface cultural features was noted within any of the 6 shovel tests excavated
on the site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of cultural materials on the modern ground surface, site
41CA26 measures approximately 1115.2 feet (340.0 m) northwest to southeast along the length
of the proposed ROW by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) northeast to southwest. Site boundaries were
documented only within the proposed ROW, and undocumented portions of the site may extend
to the northeast and southwest beyond the documented site boundaries.

A Cultural Resources Assessment of the USACE Jurisdictional Areas along BridgeTex Pipeline
Company, LLC’s Proposed BridgeTex North Pipeline ROW

A total of 6 shovel tests excavated on site 41CA26 revealed 2.0 to 11.8 inches (5.0 to
30.0 cm) of brown and dark, yellowish-brown silty clay loam deposits overlying dark, yellowishbrown clay. No cultural materials were observed in subsurface contexts.
Summary
Site 41CA26 is a low-density aboriginal lithic scatter situated to the south of a pond fed
by an unnamed tributary of West Prong Burnt Branch. A total of 6 shovel tests were excavated
on site 41CA26. No subsurface cultural materials were observed in any of the 6 shovel tests
excavated on the site. Additionally, no evidence of any cultural features, temporally diagnostic
stone tools, or preserved floral or faunal remains was encountered during survey on the site.
The site boundaries were delineated only within the proposed ROW, and the cultural materials
on site 41CA26 may extend northeast and southwest of the boundaries of the proposed ROW.
As the full extent of site 41CA26 was not delineated, its NRHP eligibility status is considered to
be undetermined. However, the deposits within the proposed ROW consist of only a lowdensity scatter of lithic specimens. Based upon the lack of temporally diagnostic stone tools,
any preserved floral or faunal remains, or stratified, buried cultural deposits, it is Horizon’s
opinion that the portion of site 41CA26 within the proposed ROW is considered to be a noncontributing element to the site’s overall NRHP eligibility status. No additional investigations are
recommended within the portion of the site within the proposed ROW.
6.2.2

Site 41NL311

General Description
Site 41NL311 represents the remains of a high-density aboriginal lithic scatter located
2.0 miles (3.2 km) to the northwest of the intersection of Interstate Highway (IH) 20 and Stink
Creek Road near Trent in Nolan County, Texas. The site is situated along the edge of a
prominent landform approximately 264.0 feet (80.0 m) to the southeast of an unnamed tributary
feeder to Sweetwater Creek (USACE jurisdictional crossing CRK X28) at an elevation of
1950.0 feet (594.5 m) amsl (Figures 6-5 and 6-6). An existing pipeline ROW is located
immediately south of the site (see Figure 6-6). The vegetation in the surrounding area consists
of cacti, yucca, and short wild grasses with scattered mesquite trees (Figure 6-7). As
documented during the current survey, site 41NL311 measures 1262.8 feet (385.0 m) in length
by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width within the proposed ROW. The site boundaries were
documented only within the proposed ROW.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41NL311 consist entirely of aboriginal lithic
specimens. The observed lithic assemblage includes approximately 30 to 40 chert cores,
10 biface fragments; 10 unifacially worked chert tool fragments (possible scrapers); more than
100 primary, secondary, and tertiary flakes; and 1 possible hammerstone (Figures 6-8 to 6-10).
All of the lithic materials observed on 41NL311 were manufactured from light gray to grayishbrown, medium-grained chert. Aside from the observed lithic specimens, no temporally
diagnostic formal tools, preserved floral or faunal remains, or thermally altered rocks were noted
on the site.

Cultural Features
No cultural features were observed on the modern ground surface of the site, and no
evidence of subsurface cultural features was noted within any of the 11 shovel tests excavated
on the site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of cultural materials on the modern ground surface, site
41NL311 measures approximately 1262.8 feet (385.0 m) northwest to southeast along the
length of the proposed ROW by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) northeast to southwest. Site boundaries
were documented only within the proposed ROW, and undocumented portions of the site may
extend to the northeast and southwest beyond the documented site boundaries.
A total of 11 shovel tests excavated on site 41NL311 revealed 1.2 to 11.8 inches (3.0 to
30.0 cm) of reddish-brown sandy clay loam deposits overlying gravelly, dark reddish-brown clay.
No cultural materials were observed in subsurface contexts.
Summary
Site 41NL311 is a high-density aboriginal lithic scatter situated along the edge of a
prominent landform to the southeast of an unnamed tributary feeder of Sweetwater Creek. A
total of 11 shovel tests were excavated on site 41NL311. No subsurface cultural materials were
observed in any of the 11 shovel tests excavated on the site. Additionally, no evidence of any
cultural features, temporally diagnostic stone tools, or preserved floral or faunal remains was

proposed ROW, and the cultural materials on site 41NL311 may extend northeast and
southwest of the boundaries of the proposed ROW. As the full extent of site 41NL311 was not
delineated, its NRHP eligibility status is considered to be undetermined. However, the deposits
within the proposed ROW consist of only a high-density surface scatter of lithic specimens.
Based upon the lack of temporally diagnostic stone tools, any preserved floral or faunal
remains, or stratified, buried cultural deposits, it is Horizon’s opinion that the portion of site
41NL311 within the proposed ROW is considered to be a non-contributing element to the site’s
overall NRHP eligibility status. No additional investigations are recommended within the portion
of the site within the proposed ROW.
6.2.3

Site 41TA314

General Description
Site 41TA314 represents the remains of a low-density aboriginal lithic scatter located
0.6 miles (1.0 km) to the northeast of the intersection of CR 306 and FM Road 1235 near Merkel
in Taylor County, Texas. The site is situated on the western bank of Bull Wagon Creek (USACE
jurisdictional crossing CRK X53) at an elevation of 1863.0 feet (568.0 m) amsl (see Figures 6-11
and 6-12). An existing pipeline ROW is located immediately south of the site (see Figure 6-12).
The vegetation in the surrounding area consists of cacti, yucca, and short, wild grasses with

specimens. The observed lithic assemblage includes approximately 1 secondary, 2 tertiary, and
2 retouched flakes (Figure 6-14). All of the materials observed on 41TA314 were manufactured
from light gray to dark, grayish-brown, medium- to fine-grained chert. Aside from the observed
lithic specimens, no temporally diagnostic formal tools, preserved floral or faunal remains, or
thermally altered rocks were noted on the site.
Cultural Features
No cultural features were observed on the modern ground surface of the site, and no
evidence of subsurface cultural features was noted within any of the 6 shovel tests excavated
on the site.

A total of 6 shovel tests excavated on site 41TA314 revealed 5.9 to 11.8 inches (15.0 to
30.0 cm) of brown to grayish-brown sandy clay loam deposits overlying dark grayish-brown clay
with high concentrations of calcite inclusions. No cultural materials were observed in
subsurface contexts.
Summary
Site 41TA314 is a low-density aboriginal lithic scatter situated just to the west of Bull
Wagon Creek. A total of 6 shovel tests were excavated on site 41TA314. No subsurface
cultural materials were observed in any of the 6 shovel tests excavated on the site. Additionally,
no evidence of any temporally diagnostic stone tools, cultural features, or preserved floral or
faunal remains was encountered during survey on the site. The site boundaries were
delineated only within the proposed ROW, and the cultural materials on site 41TA314 may
extend northeast and southwest of the boundaries of the proposed ROW. As the full extent of
site 41TA314 was not delineated, its NRHP eligibility status is considered to be undetermined.
However, the deposits within the proposed ROW consist of only a low-density surface scatter of
lithic specimens. Based upon the lack of temporally diagnostic stone tools, any preserved floral
or faunal remains, or stratified, buried cultural deposits, it is Horizon’s opinion that the portion of

site 41TA314 within the proposed ROW is considered to be a non-contributing element to the
site’s overall NRHP eligibility status. No additional investigations are recommended within the
portion of site 41TA314 located within the proposed ROW.

6.3

PREVIOUSLY RECORDED ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES

In addition to assessing the USACE jurisdictional areas along the proposed BridgeTex
North pipeline ROW, the USACE requested that BridgeTex also take into consideration all
previously recorded archeological sites that might be present within the limits of the proposed
ROW outside of the USACE’s jurisdiction and find ways to avoid or minimize impacts to any
listed on the NRHP or with the potential to qualify for listing on the NRHP. This included
previously recorded archeological sites documented as being eligible or potentially eligible for
listing on the NRHP, as well as any sites with a currently undetermined NRHP eligibility status.
Archival research conducted prior to the field efforts revealed the presence of
1 previously recorded archeological site within or in immediate proximity to the proposed ROW
in Segment 1, outside of the USACE jurisdictional areas. This site, 41FS52, had no site form
associated with it on the THC’s Atlas database. As such, the site type and its NRHP eligibility
status were unknown prior to the field efforts. Because of this, the Horizon field crews
reassessed this site, and the results of the reassessment are presented below.
6.3.1

Site 41FS52

General Description
Site 41FS52 is a previously recorded archeological site whose extreme southern
boundary is located within the proposed BridgeTex North ROW, but outside of any USACE
jurisdictional areas that were delineated for the undertaking (Figure 6-15). The only records for
this site on the THC’s Atlas database consist of a map plotting and TARL key site card that
contains only locational data and the name of the site recorder. No site form with a formal site
description was available to determine the type and NRHP eligibility status of this site. All that
was currently known about the site was that it was recorded by Foy Steadman at some point in
the past.
Because little information was available for site 41FS52, Horizon archeologists visited
the location on 2 July 2013 in order to determine its nature and significance. The field crew
found the site to consist of a low-density prehistoric lithic scatter within an active agricultural
field (Figure 6-16). It is situated within a generally flat upland area adjacent to what was once a
small tributary of Sweetwater Creek before routine plowing modified the area (Figure 6-17).
Cultural materials consisted of only sparse amounts of lithic reduction debris on the plowed
surface of the site. A total of 8 shovel tests were excavated along the proposed ROW where it
crosses the mapped boundaries of the site, and all 8 produced negative results.
Observed Cultural Materials
Observed cultural materials within the portion of site 41FS52 crossed by the proposed
ROW consist of 1 chert core, 2 secondary chert flakes, 1 tertiary chert flake, and 1 edge-

Figure 6-17. Photograph of site 41FS52 facing southeast
modified flake (Figure 6-18). No formal stone tools or preserved floral/faunal remains were
encountered during the assessment of the site. One small rodent bone was encountered within
a shovel test. However, it was considered to be naturally occurring and not part of the cultural
deposits on the site.
As previously noted, only the extreme southern tip of site 41FS52 extends into the
currently proposed ROW, and the majority of the site is located to the north of the proposed
ROW. While the field crew did not assess the portion of the site outside of the proposed ROW,
they did examine an elevated rock outcrop on the northern extent of the mapped boundaries of
the site that likely represents a source of lithic raw materials that attracted the aboriginal
inhabitants to this location.
Cultural Features
No evidence of cultural features was noted on the plowed surface of this site or within
any of the 8 shovel tests excavated along the proposed ROW across this site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
As currently mapped on the Atlas database, site 41FS52 measures approximately
428.0 feet (130.0 m) north to south by 328.1 feet (100.0 m) east to west. Horizon’s current
investigations assessed only the extreme southern tip of the site and found no additional
deposits to suggest a revision of the boundaries.

The vertical extent of site 41FS52 is confined to plowed surface contexts within the limits
of the proposed ROW. While surface contexts are anticipated across the rest of the site, areas
outside of the current ROW were not assessed.
Summary
Site 41FS52 is a previously recorded archeological site that had no available information
aside from locational data on the THC’s Atlas database. Horizon’s assessment of the site found
it to consist of a low-density prehistoric lithic scatter situated within an agricultural field. This
upland location lacks alluvial deposits, and the repeated plowing of the area has served to
heavily disturb all of the surficial deposits at this location. As Horizon’s investigations were
limited to only the portion within the currently proposed ROW, the entirety of the site was not
evaluated and its overall NRHP eligibility status remains undetermined. However, based on the
presence of only sparse and surficial cultural deposits, it is Horizon’s opinion that the portion of
41FS52 within the currently proposed ROW is considered to be a non-contributing element to
the overall NRHP eligibility status of the site and that no additional investigations are warranted
at this location.

AREAS REQUIRING MECHANICAL TRENCHING

Within areas of deep alluvium where the potential exists for buried cultural deposits at
depths greater than those accessible via traditional shovel testing methods (i.e., greater than

HJN 120166 AR

83

Chapter 6.0: Results – Segment 1

3.3 feet [1.0 m]), the THC requires deeper subsurface investigations, such as mechanical
trenching, in order to prospect for deeply buried cultural deposits. Horizon’s field efforts
included the documentation of areas containing alluvial deposits and a determination of the
potential for deeply buried cultural deposits at each USACE jurisdictional area assessed during
the survey-level field efforts. In all, a total of 2 USACE jurisdictional areas requiring the usage
of a NWP were identified in Segment 1 where the potential exists for deeply buried cultural
deposits and mechanical trenching is recommended. These crossings are noted in Table 6-1.
At this time, Horizon has yet to be released to conduct any recommended backhoe trenching
efforts for the undertaking. Once these trenching efforts are complete, the results will be
presented as an addendum to this document.

7.0 RESULTS – SEGMENT 2

7.1

GENERAL FINDINGS

Segment 2 of the proposed BridgeTex North ROW measures approximately 102.0 miles
(164.2 km) in length and extends through Comanche, Hamilton, Coryell, and McLennan
counties, Texas (see Figures 1-1 and 1-3). Within Segment 2, biologists under the direction of
Zephyr identified a total of 52 USACE jurisdictional areas where a NWP will be necessary for
the construction of the proposed pipeline. These 52 USACE jurisdictional areas have a
combined overall length of 10,400.0 feet (3169.9 m). In addition, a short segment of the
proposed ROW, measuring approximately 4224.0 feet (1287.5 m) in length, extends across the
Alfred Hughes Prison property in Coryell County, Texas, within Segment 2. The TSMASS
require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring 100.0 feet (30.5 m)
in width. As the length of the 52 USACE jurisdictional areas and the segment of the proposed
ROW across the Alfred Hughes Prison property within Segment 2 total approximately
14,624.0 feet (4457.4 m) in combined length, a total of 45 shovel tests would have been
necessary within the USACE jurisdictional areas and across the prison property in order to
comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 235 shovel
tests within the USACE jurisdictional areas and across the prison property within Segment 2 of
the proposed ROW.
Due to the high number of assessed USACE jurisdictional areas along the length of
Segment 2, it would be impractical, as well as redundant, to discuss the results of the cultural
resources survey of every single location, especially when the survey produced negative results
at the majority of them. Therefore, to aid in an expeditious review of the results by permitting
agencies, the results for each assessed USACE jurisdictional area where a NWP permit will be
necessary for pipeline construction are summarized in tabular format in Table 7-1. This table
presents: (1) the name and type of each assessed USACE jurisdictional area; (2) previously
documented cultural resources within 0.5 miles (0.8 km) of each location; (3) the number of
shovel tests excavated at each location; (4) a brief description and NRHP eligibility
determination of newly discovered archeological sites at each location, if any; (5) a brief
description of the soils at each location and a notation regarding the potential for deeply buried
cultural deposits; and, finally, (6) Horizon’s recommendations for avoidance measures or
additional investigations, including backhoe trenching efforts. The results of the cultural
resources survey across the Alfred Hughes Prison property are presented in Section 7.2

While the presentation of the results in tabular format will aid in the presentation of the
negative data, it is not sufficient for a thorough presentation of the positive results. With this in
mind, all newly recorded archeological sites are thoroughly discussed in Section 7.3 of this
chapter, and any previously recorded archeological sites that were assessed are discussed in
Section 7.4. Recommendations for mechanical trenching efforts are summarized in Section 7.5.

7.2

ALFRED HUGHES PRISON PROPERTY RESULTS

Approximately 0.8 miles (1.3 km) of the proposed ROW extends across the Alfred
Hughes Prison property in Coryell County, Texas. As this parcel is owned and managed by the
TDCJ, Horizon surveyed the entire length of the proposed ROW across this parcel under TAC
permit no. 6480 on 14 March 2013. The TSMASS require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per
mile for linear projects measuring 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width. As such, a minimum of
13 shovel tests were necessary within this portion of the proposed ROW across publicly owned
land in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon met the TSMASS within the proposed ROW
across this parcel by excavating 13 shovel tests along the length of the proposed ROW (Figure
7-1).
The cultural resources survey of the proposed ROW across the Alfred Hughes Prison
property resulted in entirely negative findings. No cultural materials were observed on the
surface of the proposed ROW, nor were any cultural materials observed from the 13 shovel
tests excavated along its length. All soils along the proposed ROW consisted of shallow cobbly
clay that precluded the potential for any deeply buried cultural deposits, and all 13 excavated
shovel tests revealed only 10.0 to 20 cm (3.9 to 7.9 inches) of rocky clay soil overlying
limestone bedrock. Based on the negative survey results and the presence of near-surface
bedrock, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the proposed ROW across the Alfred
Hughes Prison property will have no adverse impacts to any cultural resources and that no
additional cultural resources investigation are warranted on the property.

7.3

NEWLY RECORDED ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES

The cultural resources survey of the 52 USACE jurisdictional areas within Segment 2 of
the proposed BridgeTex North pipeline ROW resulted in the documentation of 3 newly recorded
archeological sites (41CV1665, 41CV1666, and 41HM62). These sites are discussed
separately below.
7.3.1

Site 41CV1665
General Description

Site 41CV1665 was documented as a small cemetery housing the purported graves of
Mr. Lemuel Murrell, an early settler in Coryell County, and 2 of his slaves. These graves are
contained within a small chain-link enclosure that is situated under a large elm tree
approximately 1.4 miles (2.2 km) northwest of Ater, Texas, on the southwest side of Anne Way
Road (CR 107) (Figures 7-2 and 7-3). When originally planned, the proposed BridgeTex North
alignment extended north of an artificial pond (USACE jurisdictional area POND X10) that

had been created on an unnamed tributary of the Leon River. When BridgeTex approached the
current landowner about purchasing an easement at this location, the landowner informed
BridgeTex that the ROW would encompass the location of the noted graves and requested that
the proposed ROW be shifted to the south of the pond in order to avoid all impacts to the small
grave plot as well as the surrounding area that was once the homestead of Mr. Murrell. Horizon
archeologists assessed the location to confirm the presence of the graves and to assess the
location south of the pond to ensure the protection of any unmarked graves or significant
cultural deposits at this location. BridgeTex complied with the landowner’s request and has
since shifted the proposed ROW south of POND X10. However, because Murrell was a
prominent figure in the early settlement of Coryell County, the site was documented in order to
provide a record of its location within the THC’s Atlas database.
Accompanied by 34 slaves, Lemuel Murrell (born 4 August 1820) and his wife Mary
(Baity) Murrell (born 8 October 1834) set out from Missouri in covered wagons in 1846. Several
weeks later, they arrived in Coryell County and homesteaded several sections of land near the
Leon River near the town now known as Ater, Texas. Lemuel and Mary built a log cabin with
3 fireplaces for themselves, and he and his slaves also built several log cabins for the slaves
and their families. Lemuel was purported to be a cattleman, farmer, surveyor, and merchant,
and he opened a general store in the area and stocked it with supplies gathered by his men on
ox-drawn wagons from Houston and Galveston. He also specialized his slaves in various skills
and tasks to make the settlement a self-sufficient community. Being civic-minded, Murrell gave
land for the first school in Ater, Texas, and his slaves built a small log school house on the
property (Murrell School) (www.findagrave.com 2013).
Being a prominent business man with large herds of cattle and more slaves than anyone
in Coryell County, Murrell was reputed to have accrued a vast fortune of hidden gold. On the
evening of 9 June 1865, Murrell left his house to go to the spring near his trading post. In his
absence, a group of masked men approached his house demanding money as well as the
location of the hidden gold. During the exchange, they threatened to throw the Murrell’s
youngest child, Ora, into the fire unless their demands were met. Mary Murrell paid the men
$100, and one account indicates that she told them where the gold was hidden. Another
account indicates that the robbers awaited Lemuel’s return so that he would tell them the
location of the gold. Regardless, upon his eventual return that evening, the band of robbers
shot Lemuel in the back and killed him. Lemuel Murrell is then reported to have been laid to
rest on the property, and that 2 of his favorite slaves were eventually buried next to him
(www.findagrave.com 2013). However, Carol Vaughan, Murrell’s great-great-granddaughter,
suggests that the 2 accompanying graves may be the parents of Mary Murrell (William and
Eleanor Baity) as the burial locations of these 2 individuals are currently unknown. Mary Murrell
and 4 of her children are buried in the Ater Cemetery, several miles southeast of the property.
It is rumored that the “Murrell Treasure” lured treasure hunters to the property for many
years after Lemuel’s death and that Mary and her children would routinely be awoken by the
sound of people digging on their land. In some cases, the holes were reported to be big enough
to hold a horse (www.findagrave.com 2013). Carol Vaughan notes that gold was eventually

found beneath Murrell’s house in mason jars and that Lemuel’s son-in-law eventually lost most
of it gambling.
Cultural Features
At the time of the assessment of the location in 2013, the Horizon archeologist found the
location to consist of a small, 16.4-by-16.4-foot (5.0-by-5.0-m) area enclosed by a chain-link
fence (Figure 7-4). One row of flat stones, presumably marking the graves, was visible within
the fenced areas (Figure 7-5). These stones were not typical headstones and contained no
markings on them. Additionally, several smaller angular stones were noted around the
perimeter of the fence. The landowner’s cousin informed the field crew that the area was once
encircled by a low stone wall in his youth, and that the chain-link fence had been added later.
While there were no engraved headstones with the names of the deceased, there was no
reason to doubt that the location represented the resting place of Lemuel Murrell.
Other than the fenced enclosure, the only other feature on the property consists of a
modern house that is currently occupied by the present landowner. The landowner’s cousin
noted that the Murrell’s house, trading post, blacksmith shop, and slave quarters were actually
located on the opposite side of CR 107 to the northeast of the graves and not in immediate
proximity to them. Mary Murrell also purportedly built a second house after the death of Lemuel.
This second house, built in the late 1800s, was located just to the east of the grave enclosure
and can be seen on the 1956 and 1995 USGS 7.5-minute Jonesboro, Texas, topographic
quadrangle maps (see Figure 7-2). This house fell into disrepair and was demolished roughly
40 years ago by the current landowner’s sister-in-law.
Finally, although not observed, the landowner's cousin, who lived on the property as a
youth, indicated having seen slave grave markers along the creek to the east of the fenced
enclosure and along the north side of the pond to the west of the fenced enclosure. Although
the field inspection found no evidence of graves at these locations, they are noted on Figure 7-3
in the event that future construction projects encroach on the property.
Observed Cultural Materials
Although the current investigations on site 41CV1665 were focused on the assessment
of the location of Murrell’s grave, the field crew did notice a scatter of both prehistoric lithic
debris and historic-era debris in the area between the fenced enclosure and the modern house
on the property (Figure 7-6). The landowner indicated that she had found several stone tools on
the property and showed several to the field crew (Figure 7-7). All of the tools appeared to be
bifaces in various stages of reduction, and no temporally diagnostic implements were noted. As
for the historic-era debris, the landowner noted that the debris scatter was associated with the
demolition of the second house built on the property by Mary Murrell in the late 1800s. The
area containing all the observed materials has been plowed and planted in coastal hay in the
past, suggesting that the observed materials have been scattered over the property.

Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
At this time, only the location of the graves on the property and a portion of the observed
prehistoric and historic-era scatter have been defined on the site. This area measures
approximately 295.2 by 295.0 feet (90.0 by 90.0 m). However, as previously noted, the
Murrell’s original house, blacksmith shop, trading post, and slave quarters were located on the
opposite side of CR 107 to the northeast of the fenced enclosure, and the second house
constructed by Mary Murrell after the death of her husband was located to the east of the
fenced enclosure. As the proposed pipeline ROW has been rerouted south of this location, the
full extent of site 41CV1665 has yet to be fully delineated.
As for the vertical extent of the site, the observed prehistoric and historic-era scatter was
observed only in surface contexts across the routinely plowed surface outside of the fenced
enclosure. A total of 8 shovel tests excavated on opposing sides of a tributary of the Leon River
at this location produced no evidence of subsurface cultural deposits. However, as the full
horizontal extent of the site has yet to be delineated, it remains undetermined whether buried
cultural deposits are present within the unassessed portions of the site.
Summary
Site 41CV1665 was primarily documented as a small cemetery that is purported to
contain the graves of Lemuel Murrell and 2 of his favorite slaves. However, based on the
information provided about the area by the current landowner and descendents of Murrell, the
graves constitute only a small portion of the overall Murrell homestead that included an original
log house, a blacksmith shop, a trading post, slave quarters, a secondary house built by Mary
Murrell after the death of her husband, and possibly several unmarked slave graves.
Additionally, the presence of stone tools on the property also suggests that the location was
utilized hundreds to thousands of years prior to the Murrell’s settling of the location in 1846.
Given the prominence of Lemuel Murrell to history and settlement of the area, the overall site
may be eligible for inclusion on the NRHP. However, because the full extent of the site has yet
to be evaluated, its NRHP eligibility status is currently considered to be undetermined.
As noted earlier, BridgeTex originally intended to place the proposed ROW north of
USACE jurisdictional area POND X10, immediately adjacent to the fenced enclosure containing
the graves and through the middle of the overall site. At the request of the landowner,
BridgeTex has realigned the proposed ROW at this location to the south of POND X10 and
south of another existing pipeline ROW at this location in order to completely avoid site
41CV1665. As site CR-12 is no longer within the limits of the proposed BridgeTex North ROW,
BridgeTex has effectively avoided any adverse impacts to this site.
7.3.2

Site 41CV1666
General Description

Site 41CV1666 represents the remains of a low-density aboriginal lithic scatter located
0.6 miles (1.0 km) to the northwest of the intersection of Anne Way and CR 107 near Levita in
Coryell County, Texas. The site is situated adjacent to the western bank of an unnamed

HJN 120166 AR

Chapter 7.0: Results – Segment 2

tributary feeder of the Leon River (USACE jurisdictional crossing CRK X14) at an elevation of
845.0 feet (166.2 m) amsl (Figures 7-8 and 7-9). An existing pipeline ROW is located
immediately south of the site (see Figure 7-9). The vegetation in the surrounding area consists
of Ashe juniper and oak trees, greenbrier, and short grasses (Figure 7-10). As documented
during the current survey, site 41CV1666 measures 262.4 feet (80.0 m) in length by 100.0 feet
(30.5 m) in width within the proposed ROW. The site boundaries were documented only within
the proposed ROW.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41CV1666 consist entirely of aboriginal lithic
specimens. The observed lithic assemblage includes approximately 20 primary, secondary, and
tertiary flakes and cores (Figure 7-11). All of the materials observed on 41CV1666 were
manufactured from tan to grayish-brown, medium-grained chert. Aside from the observed lithic
specimens, no temporally diagnostic formal tools, preserved floral or faunal remains, or
thermally altered rocks were noted on the site.
Cultural Features
No cultural features were observed on the modern ground surface of the site, and no
evidence of subsurface cultural features was noted within any of the 8 shovel tests excavated
on the site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of cultural materials on the modern ground surface, site
41CV1666 measures approximately 262.4 feet (80.0 m) northwest to southeast along the length
of the proposed ROW by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) northeast to southwest. Site boundaries were
documented only within the proposed ROW, and undocumented portions of the site may extend
to the northeast and southwest beyond the documented site boundaries.
A total of 8 shovel tests excavated on site 41CV1666 revealed 2.0 to 11.8 inches (5.0 to
30.0 cm) of brown and dark, reddish-brown sandy loam deposits overlying gravelly, reddishbrown and dark brown clay. No cultural materials were observed in subsurface contexts.
Summary
Site 41CV1666 is a low-density, aboriginal lithic scatter situated adjacent to the western
bank of an unnamed tributary feeder of the Leon River. A total of 8 shovel tests were excavated
on site 41CV1666. No subsurface cultural materials were observed in any of the 8 shovel tests
excavated on the site. Additionally, no evidence of any cultural features or preserved floral or
faunal remains was encountered during survey on the site. The site boundaries were
delineated only within the proposed ROW, and the cultural materials on site 41CV1666 may
extend northeast and southwest of the boundaries of the proposed ROW. As the full extent of
site 41CV1666 was not delineated, its NRHP eligibility status is considered to be undetermined.
However, the deposits within the proposed ROW consist of only a low-density scatter of lithic

specimens. Based upon the lack of temporally diagnostic stone tools, any preserved floral or
faunal remains, or stratified, buried cultural deposits, it is Horizon’s opinion that the portion of
site 41CV1666 within the proposed ROW is considered to be a non-contributing element to the
site’s overall NRHP eligibility status. No additional investigations are recommended within the
portion of the site within the proposed ROW.
7.3.3

Site 41HM62
General Description

Site 41HM62 represents the remains of a historic-era trash scatter located 4.1 miles
(6.6 km) to the south of the intersection of SH 36 and SH 281 near Hamilton in Hamilton
County, Texas. The site is situated on a gentle slope approximately 590.0 feet (180.0 m) to the
west of a wetland feature (USACE jurisdictional area WET X-5) at an elevation of 1240.0 feet
(378.0 ft) amsl (Figures 7-12 and 7-13). An existing pipeline ROW is located immediately south
of the site (see Figure 7-13). The vegetation in the surrounding area consists mainly of short
annual grasses with scattered mesquite and oak trees (Figure 7-14). As documented during the
current survey, site 41HM62 measures 180.4 feet (55.0 m) in length by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in
width within the proposed ROW. The site boundaries were documented only within the
proposed ROW.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41HM62 consist primarily of historic-era bottles and
glass shards, including 6 complete bottles and approximately 50 blue, brown, clear, and opaque
white shards (Figures 7-15 to 7-17). Additional artifacts from the site include small quantities of
brick, concrete, and metal debris and whiteware sherds. The opaque white glass shards
observed on site 41HM62 provide a tentative date range from the 1890s to the mid-20th century
(Lindsey 2013). Additionally, one of the brown glass shards observed on site 41H62 had a
maker’s mark consisting of an “I” inside an oval superimposed on an elongated diamond (also
called the “diamond IO” mark) embossed on the bottle base (Figure 7-15). This mark is
representative of the Owens-Illinois Glass Company, dating the bottles from approximately 1929
to the mid-20th century (Lockhart 2004).
Cultural Features
No cultural features were observed on the modern ground surface on the site, and no
evidence of subsurface cultural features was noted within any of the 6 shovel tests excavated
on the site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of cultural materials on the modern ground surface, site
41HM62 measures approximately 180.4 feet (55.0 m) northwest to southeast along the length of
the proposed ROW by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) northeast to southwest. Site boundaries were
documented only within the proposed ROW, and undocumented portions of the site may extend
to the northeast and southwest beyond the documented site boundaries.

A total of 6 shovel tests excavated on site 41HM62 revealed up to 3.9 to 11.8 inches
(10.0 to 30.0 cm) of very dark, grayish-brown to black clay loam deposits overlying very dark,
grayish-brown and black clay.
Cultural materials were observed in the upper 7.9 inches
(20.0 cm) of sediments in 1 of the 6 shovel tests excavated on the site; however, cultural
materials are predominantly restricted to the modern ground surface.
Chain of Title Research
A chain of ownership for the parcel on which site 41HM62 is located was not available at
the time of reporting. However, site 41HM62 consists only of a low-density scatter of historicera trash with no remnants of any identifiable structures present at the site. Given the lack of
any standing structures and the lack of integrity of archeological deposits on site 41HM62, it is
unlikely that an association could be made between any historically significant persons or
associated historical events that might be identified by the chain of ownership for the parcel on
which the site is located.
Summary
Site 41HM62 represents the remains of a surficial historic-era trash scatter situated on a
gentle slope to the west of an unnamed tributary of Little Cowhouse Creek. A total of 6 shovel
tests were excavated on site 41HM62. Cultural materials were observed in the upper 7.9 inches
(20.0.0 cm) of sediments in 1 of the 6 shovel tests excavated on the site; however, cultural
materials are predominantly restricted to the modern ground surface. As site boundaries were
delineated only within the proposed ROW, site 41HM62 may extend northeast and southwest of
the boundaries of the proposed ROW. As the full extent of site 41HM62 was not delineated, its
NRHP eligibility status is considered to be undetermined. However, it is Horizon’s opinion that
the portion of site 41HM62 located within the proposed ROW does not contribute to the site’s
NRHP eligibility status under Criteria A, B, or C. The character of the artifact scatter observed
on the site suggests that the site may represent a historic-era trash dump, and the presence of
glass shards with Owens Illinois maker’s marks among the debris suggests the site may to the
early to mid-20th century. However, the lack of integrity of the site, the lack of standing
structures, and the lack of cultural features limit the archeological research value of the site.
Therefore, it is Horizon’s opinion that the portion of site 41HM62 within the proposed ROW does
not contribute to the site’s NRHP eligibility status under Criterion D. Thus, Horizon recommends
that the documented portion of site 41HM62 located within the proposed ROW is a
noncontributing element to the overall NRHP status of the site and that no additional
investigations on this site are warranted in connection with the proposed undertaking.

7.4

PREVIOUSLY RECORDED ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES

In addition to assessing the USACE jurisdictional areas along the proposed BridgeTex
North pipeline ROW, the USACE requested that BridgeTex also take into consideration all
previously recorded archeological sites that might be present within the limits of the proposed
ROW outside of the USACE’s jurisdiction and find ways to avoid or minimize impacts to any
listed on the NRHP or with the potential to qualify for listing on the NRHP. This included

HJN 120166 AR

109

Chapter 7.0: Results – Segment 2

previously recorded archeological sites documented as being eligible or potentially eligible for
listing on the NRHP, as well as any sites with a currently undetermined NRHP eligibility status.
Archival research conducted prior to the field efforts revealed the presence of
1 previously recorded archeological site within or in immediate proximity to the proposed ROW
in Segment 2, outside of the USACE jurisdictional areas. This site, 41CV275, was documented
as a prehistoric campsite with an undetermined NRHP eligibility status. Because of its
undetermined NRHP eligibility status, the Horizon field crews reassessed this site, and the
results of the reassessment are presented below.
7.4.1

Site 41CV275
General Description

Site 41CV275 is a previously recorded archeological site that was minimally recorded in
1982 by Daymond Crawford. It was noted as being on the southwest bank and terrace of the
Leon River at the small town of Ater, Texas. The site form notes that flint flakes and burned
rock were observed on the site, but no subsurface investigations appear to have been
conducted. This extensive site, measuring 1000.0 by 500.0 feet (304.8 by 152.4 m), is
described as containing an open terrace prehistoric component and a historic component
referred to as the town of Ater. Aside from this information, the site form only includes a
recommendation for testing excavations on the site. As such, its NRHP eligibility status was
considered to be undetermined. While not mentioned on the site form, the site also
encompasses the Ater Cemetery.
The Handbook of Texas Online contains the following entry for the town of Ater, Texas:
Ater is on the south bank of the Leon River nine miles northwest of Gatesville and one
mile north of Farm Road 2412 in northwestern Coryell County. The site was settled in
the early 1870s by families from Pontotoc County, Mississippi. The community, first
named Sardis after a church at the settlers' former home, was renamed for Joe Ater,
owner of the general store and postmaster from 1899 until 1907; in the latter year the
office was discontinued and the mail rerouted through Jonesboro. The Stephenville
North and South Texas Railway built through the area within a mile of Ater in 1911, but
the company went bankrupt in the mid-1930s. The school at Ater was consolidated with
the Jonesboro district in 1939. In the mid-1940s Ater was marked on county highway
maps as having a church, a business, and a few scattered houses, and the population
was reported as twenty-five. The population remained at twenty-five through 2000 (Scott
2013).

The currently proposed alignment of the BridgeTex North ROW extends across the
extreme southeastern edge of the mapped boundaries of site 41CV275 (Figure 7-18). Although
this location contains no USACE jurisdictional areas, it is one of the locations containing a
previously recorded archeological site with an undetermined NRHP eligibility status that the
USACE requested to be reviewed for the undertaking. At present, an existing pipeline ROW
extends across the same portion of the site, and the currently proposed ROW will be just to the
north of this existing ROW. The proposed ROW is also mapped across the locations of

2 structures that are visible on the USGS 7.5-minute Ater, Texas, topographic quadrangle map
at the northeast corner of CR 107 and CR 174 (see Figure 7-18). Both are no longer visible at
the same locations on Google Earth, indicating that they have been removed at some point in
the past. One of these appears to have been a church, while the other was a house or other
occupied structure.
Horizon’s investigations consisted of the excavation of 16 shovel tests within the
proposed ROW across site 41CV275 and the area containing the 2 structures that were visible
on the USGS Ater, Texas, quadrangle map (Figures 7-19 through Figure 7-22). These shovel
tests produced primarily prehistoric materials within the mapped boundaries of the site and also
resulted in the extension of these boundaries slightly to the east where additional prehistoric
materials were observed in areas outside of the site’s originally mapped boundaries (see also
Figures 7-18 and 7-19). In addition, the investigations in the vicinity of the 2 aforementioned
structures produced historic-era debris left over from these 2 former structures, as well as a few
prehistoric specimens, and resulted in the extension of the site’s southern boundaries to
encompass these deposits (see Figures 7-18 and 7-19).
While both noted structures are no longer present at their mapped locations on the
USGS Ater, Texas, topographic quadrangle map, the assessment of the smaller structure’s
location revealed a historical marker that was erected for the Murrell School in 2010 (Figure 723). This marker notes that the Murrell Schoolhouse is one of the few standing rural schools in
Coryell County. It is assumed that this refers to the new Murrell Schoolhouse that was built in
1909-1910 and expanded in 1920 (noted on the marker) since no structure is currently standing
at the location of the marker. Alternately, the schoolhouse may have been removed from the
location within the last few years after the monument was erected in 2010. It is interesting to
note that the original log schoolhouse was built by Lemuel Murrell, whose gravesite and
homestead was recorded as site 41CV1665 during the current survey efforts just a few miles
northwest of this location.
Observed Cultural Materials
Within the eastern portion of site 41CV275, intensive surface inspection revealed the
presence of copious amounts of lithic debitage, burned rock, and chert cores eroding from the
surface of the site, especially where the site begins to slope towards the Leon River. The field
crew also noted the presence of 2 possible metate fragments and 1 unifacially flaked stone tool
on the site’s surface. Shovel testing efforts in this area produced chert debitage between
0.0 and 3.3 feet (0.0 and 1.0 m) below surface, as well as a utilized chert flake and
1 mano/hammerstone (Figure 7-24).
Within the portions of the site containing the 2 former structures, intensive surface
inspection revealed considerable amounts of historic-era debris consisting of window glass,
bricks, cut limestone, porcelain, whiteware, stoneware, and amethyst glass (Figures 7-25 and 726). Several chert flakes were also observed on the surface at this location. Shovel testing
efforts in this area produced a square nail, window glass, amethyst glass, and a small washer
from depths between 0.0 and 7.9 inches (0.0 to 20 cm) below surface (see Figures 7-25 and 726).

Cultural Features
Within the eastern portion of site 41CV275, no cultural features were noted on the
surface of the site or within the excavated shovel tests. However, the presence of burned rocks
on the surface and within shovel tests indicates that there exists a high potential for
undiscovered cultural features within the site’s deposits.
Within the portion of the site in the vicinity of the former structures, the only possible
feature observed, other than the aforementioned historical marker, consisted of several cut
limestone specimens that may reflect a portion of the foundation of one of the former structures
(Figure 7-27).
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
When originally recorded in 1982, the horizontal extent of site 41CV275 was estimated
to measure approximately 1000.0 by 500.0 feet (304.8 by 152.4 m). However, this
measurement appears to have been considerably off when measured with modern GIS abilities.
Utilizing the previously mapped boundaries, in conjunction with the slightly expanded
boundaries resulting from Horizon’s surface inspection and shovel testing efforts, site 41CV275
actually measures roughly 2624.9 feet (800.0 m) northwest to southeast by 1115.5 feet
(340.0 m) northeast to southwest.

A Cultural Resources Assessment of the USACE Jurisdictional Areas along BridgeTex Pipeline
Company, LLC’s Proposed BridgeTex North Pipeline ROW

Based on the shovel testing efforts and surface inspection, the vertical extent of the
cultural deposits on site 41CV275 within the currently proposed ROW is at least 3.3 feet (1.0 m)
deep, ranging from surface contexts down to 39.4 inches (100.0 cm) below surface.
Summary
Site 41CV275 is a previously recorded archeological site containing extensive prehistoric
deposits and historic-era deposits associated with the small town of Ater, Texas, including the
Ater Cemetery. Within the currently proposed ROW, Horizon’s investigations documented
prehistoric cultural deposits ranging in thickness to at least 3.3 feet (1.0 m) below surface.
Additionally, historic-era deposits presumably associated with a former church and the Murrell
Schoolhouse were also documented within an expanded portion of the site. While these
historic-era deposits are generally shallow, they are potentially associated with the first
schoolhouse built in Ater in 1870 by Lemuel Murrell.
When originally documented in 1982, testing recommendations were made for the site.
As such, its overall NRHP eligibility status was considered to be undetermined. As Horizon’s
investigations were limited to only the portions of the site within the currently proposed ROW,
the entire site was not assessed and its overall NRHP eligibility status remains undetermined.
However, based on the presence of deeply buried prehistoric cultural deposits and potentially
significant historic-era cultural deposits, it is Horizon’s opinion that the cultural deposits of
41CV275 within the currently proposed ROW are contributing elements to the site’s overall
NRHP eligibility status. Although the construction of the proposed ROW is outside of any
USACE jurisdictional areas and will not require the usage of any federal permits or compliance
with Section 106 of the NRHP, Horizon still recommends that the portion of site 41CV275 within
the currently proposed ROW be completely avoided and protected during pipeline construction
efforts at this location, namely via rerouting the proposed ROW to the south of this location. If
avoidance and protection are not feasible, then Horizon recommends NRHP eligibility testing
investigations (and possibly mitigation efforts) within the portion of the proposed ROW across
site 41CV275.
At this time, BridgeTex has indicated that it plans to completely avoid all impacts to site
41CV275 by installing the pipeline via an HDD beneath the site’s deposits. Should these HDD
plans change, it is Horizon’s additional opinion that the recommended reroute to the south of the
proposed ROW is the best option for avoiding any potential adverse impacts to the site’s
deposits. This is especially relevant in the event that any future pipeline maintenance is
required within the portion of the pipeline ROW in the vicinity of site 41CV275.

AREAS REQUIRING MECHANICAL TRENCHING

Within areas of deep alluvium where the potential exists for buried cultural deposits at
depths greater than those accessible via traditional shovel testing methods (i.e., greater than
3.3 feet [1.0 m]), the THC requires deeper subsurface investigations, such as mechanical
trenching, in order to prospect for deeply buried cultural deposits. Horizon’s field efforts
included the documentation of areas containing alluvial deposits and a determination of the
potential for deeply buried cultural deposits at each USACE jurisdictional area assessed during

HJN 120166 AR

119

Chapter 7.0: Results – Segment 2

the survey-level field efforts. In all, a total of 4 USACE jurisdictional areas requiring the usage
of a NWP were identified in Segment 2 where the potential exists for deeply buried cultural
deposits and mechanical trenching is recommended. These crossings are noted in Table 7-1.
At this time, Horizon has yet to be released to conduct any recommended backhoe trenching
efforts for the undertaking. Once these trenching efforts are complete, the results will be
presented as an addendum to this document.

7.6

AREAS REQUIRING SURVEY

During the course of the survey efforts of the USACE jurisdictional areas within
Segment 2, several of them were located on parcels where the landowner prohibited access
onto their property. As such, these locations were not assessed and still require a cultural
resources survey to determine the presence/absence of undocumented cultural deposits. In all,
a total of 3 USACE jurisdictional areas within Segment 2 of the proposed ROW still require a
survey. These crossings are noted in Table 7-1. At this time, Horizon has yet to be released to
conduct the necessary cultural resources surveys on these 3 crossings. Once these survey
efforts are complete, the results will be presented as an addendum to this document.

8.0 RESULTS – SEGMENT 3

8.1

GENERAL FINDINGS

Segment 3 of the proposed BridgeTex North ROW measures approximately 77.0 miles
(123.9 km) in length and extends through Bell, Falls, Milam, Robertson, and Brazos counties,
Texas (see Figures 1-1 and 1-4). Within Segment 3, biologists under the direction of Zephyr
identified a total of 80 USACE jurisdictional areas where a NWP will be necessary for the
construction of the proposed pipeline. These 80 USACE jurisdictional areas have a combined
overall length of 16,000.0 feet (4876.8 m). The TSMASS require a minimum of 16 shovel tests
per mile for linear projects measuring 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width. As the length of the USACE
jurisdictional areas within Segment 3 of the proposed ROW total approximately 16,000.0 feet
(4876.8 m) in combined length, a total of 49 shovel tests would have been necessary within the
USACE jurisdictional areas in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the
TSMASS by excavating a total of 262 shovel tests within the USACE jurisdictional areas within
Segment 3 of the proposed ROW.
Due to the high number of assessed USACE jurisdictional areas along the length of
Segment 3, it would be impractical, as well as redundant, to discuss the results of the cultural
resources survey of every single location, especially when the survey produced negative results
at the majority of them. Therefore, to aid in an expeditious review of the results by permitting
agencies, the results for each assessed USACE jurisdictional area where a NWP permit will be
necessary for pipeline construction are summarized in tabular format in Table 8-1. This table
presents: (1) the name and type of each assessed USACE jurisdictional area; (2) previously
documented cultural resources within 0.5 miles (0.8 km) of each location; (3) the number of
shovel tests excavated at each location; (4) a brief description and NRHP eligibility
determination of newly discovered archeological sites at each location, if any; (5) a brief
description of the soils at each location and a notation regarding the potential for deeply buried
cultural deposits; and finally (6) Horizon’s recommendations pertaining to the need for
avoidance measures or additional investigations, including backhoe trenching efforts.
While the presentation of the results in tabular format will aid in the presentation of the
negative data, it is not sufficient for a thorough presentation of the positive results. With this in
mind, all newly recorded archeological sites are thoroughly discussed in Section 8.2 of this
chapter, and any previously recorded archeological sites that were assessed are discussed in
Section 8.3. Recommendations for mechanical trenching efforts are summarized in Section 8.4.

Company, LLC’s Proposed BridgeTex North Pipeline ROW

8.2

NEWLY RECORDED ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES

The cultural resources survey of the 80 USACE jurisdictional areas within Segment 3 of
the proposed BridgeTex North pipeline ROW resulted in the documentation of 2 newly recorded
archeological sites (41BZ172 and 41RT572). These sites are discussed separately below.
8.2.1

Site 41BZ172
General Description

Site 41BZ172 represents the remains of a low-density, aboriginal lithic scatter located
1.7 miles (2.7 km) to the northeast of the intersection of Clear Lake Road and Wickson Lake
Road County near Bryan in Brazos County, Texas. The site is situated at the base of a
prominent landform adjacent to 2 jurisdictional wetland features (USACE jurisdictional area
WET F3) and approximately 984.0 feet (300.0 m) to the south of Alcorn Creek at an elevation of
240 feet (73.2 m) amsl (Figures 8-1 and 8-2). An existing pipeline ROW is located immediately
south of the site (see Figure 8-2). The vegetation in the surrounding area consists of short,
annual grasses and wildflowers with scattered elm, hackberry, and oak trees nearby (Figure 83). As documented during the current survey, site 41BZ172 measures 246.0 feet (75.0 m) in
length by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width within the proposed ROW. The site boundaries were
documented only within the then-proposed ROW.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41BZ172 consist of aboriginal lithic specimens and
preserved carbonized material. The observed lithic assemblage includes approximately
1 secondary and 22 tertiary flakes (Figure 8-4). All of the materials observed on 41BZ172 were
manufactured from white and light brown to grayish-brown, medium- to fine-grained chert.
Additionally, 2 fragments of carbonized organic material were observed on the site (Figure 8-5).
Aside from the observed lithic specimens, no temporally diagnostic formal tools, or thermally
altered rocks were noted on the site.
Cultural Features
No cultural features were observed on the modern ground surface on the site, and no
evidence of subsurface cultural features was noted within any of the 6 shovel tests excavated
on the site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of cultural materials on the modern ground surface and within
shovel tests, site 41BZ172 measures approximately 246.0 feet (75.0 m) northwest to southeast
along the length of the proposed ROW by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) northeast to southwest. Site
boundaries were documented only within the proposed ROW, and undocumented portions of
the site may extend to the northeast and southwest beyond the documented site boundaries.

Figure 8-5. Carbonized remains observed on site 41BZ172
A total of 6 shovel tests excavated on site 41BZ172 revealed up to 3.3 feet (1.0 m) of
brown sandy loam deposits. Cultural materials were observed in up to 3.3 feet (1.0 m) of
sediments in 4 of the 6 shovel tests excavated on the site. Cultural materials were not visible on
the modern ground surface of the site.
Summary
Site 41BZ172 is a low-density, aboriginal lithic scatter with preserved carbonized
remains situated adjacent to 2 wetland features. A total of 6 shovel tests were excavated on
site 41BZ172. No evidence of any cultural features or preserved faunal remains was
encountered during survey on the site. Cultural materials were observed in up to 3.3 feet
(1.0 m) of sediments in 4 of the 6 shovel tests excavated on the site. The site boundaries were
delineated only within the then-proposed ROW, and the cultural materials on site 41BZ172 may
extend northeast and southwest beyond the current documented boundaries. The deposits on
site 41BZ172 consist of a low-density scatter of lithic specimens and carbonized remains.
Additionally, the depth of soils on site 41BZ172 extend deeper than 3.3 feet (1.0 m), indicating
the potential for cultural deposits to be buried deeper than capable of being excavated within a
shovel test. As such, it remains to be determined if the cultural deposits on site 41BZ172 are
contributing elements to the site’s overall NRHP eligibility status.
Horizon therefore
recommends the avoidance and protection of the portion of site 41BZ172 until the full extent of
the vertical deposits can be assessed and a formal determination of its NRHP eligibility status is
made.

Chapter 8.0: Results – Segment 3

At this time, BridgeTex has rerouted the proposed ROW in this location. The site is
located approximately 246.0 feet (75.0 m) to the south beyond the boundaries of the current
proposed ROW alignment and would not be affected by the proposed undertaking. As such, no
additional investigations of this portion of site 41BZ172 are warranted at this time since the site
falls beyond the boundaries of BridgeTex’s current proposed ROW alignment.
8.2.2

Site 41RT572
General Description

Site 41RT572 represents the remains of a subsurface historic-era trash scatter located
4.7 miles (7.6 km) to the west of the intersection of Black Bridge Road and SH 6 near Calvert in
Robertson County, Texas. The site is situated adjacent to the eastern bank of the Brazos River
(USACE jurisdictional crossing CRK C1_East) at an elevation of 300.0 feet (91.5 m) amsl
(Figures 8-6 and 8-7). An existing pipeline ROW is located immediately to the south of the site
(see Figure 8-7). The vegetation in the surrounding area consists primarily of short annual
grasses with some scattered elm, hackberry, and oak trees (Figure 8-8). As documented during
the current survey, site 41RT572 measures 213.2 feet (65.0 m) in length by 100.0 feet (30.5 m)
in width within the proposed ROW. The site boundaries were documented only within the
proposed ROW.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41RT572 consist entirely of historic-era artifacts.
The observed artifact assemblage includes approximately 6 clear glass shards, 1 partial bottle
neck fragment, 4 brick and mortar fragments, 1 square nail, 1 stoneware sherd, 2 whiteware
sherds, and 3 unidentifiable metal fragments (Figure 8-9). The presence of the square nail
suggests that deposit may date to around the turn of the 20th century (GSNC 2002).
Cultural Features
No cultural features were observed on the modern ground surface of the site, and no
evidence of subsurface cultural features was noted within any of the 7 shovel tests excavated
on the site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of cultural materials within shovel tests, site 41RT572
measures approximately 213.2 feet (65.0 m) northwest to southeast along the length of the
proposed ROW by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) northeast to southwest. Site boundaries were
documented only within the proposed ROW, and undocumented portions of the site may extend
to the northeast and southwest beyond the documented site boundaries.
A total of 7 shovel tests excavated on site 41RT572 revealed up to 3.3 feet (1.0 m) of
pale brown and brown silty loam deposits. Cultural materials were observed in up to
17.7 inches (45.0 cm) of sediments in 3 of the 7 shovel tests excavated on the site. Cultural
materials were not present on the modern ground surface of the site.

Chapter 8.0: Results – Segment 3

Chain of Title Research
A chain of ownership for the parcel on which site 41RT572 is located was not available
at the time of reporting. However, site 41RT572 consists only of a low-density scatter of
historic-era trash with no remnants of any identifiable structures present at the site. Given the
lack of any standing structures and the lack of integrity of archeological deposits on site
41RT572, it is unlikely that an association could be made between any historically significant
persons or associated historical events that might be identified by the chain of ownership for the
parcel on which the site is located.
Summary
Site 41RT572 is a subsurface historic-era trash scatter situated adjacent to the eastern
bank of the Brazos River. A total of 7 shovel tests were excavated over site 41RT572. Cultural
materials were observed at depths to 17.7 inches (45.0 cm) in sediments in 3 of the 7 shovel
tests excavated on the site. As site boundaries were delineated only within the proposed ROW,
site 41RT572 may extend northeast and southwest of the boundaries of the proposed ROW. As
the full extent of site 41RT572 was not delineated, its NRHP eligibility status is considered to be
undetermined. However, it is Horizon’s opinion that the historic-era deposits of site 41RT572
located within the proposed ROW do not contribute to the site’s NRHP eligibility status under
Criteria A, B, or C. The character of the artifact scatter observed on the site suggests that the
site may represent a historic-era trash dump, and the presence of a square nail among the
debris suggests that the site dates to the turn of the 20th century. However, the lack of integrity
of the site, the lack of standing structures, and the lack of cultural features limit the archeological
research value of the site. Therefore, it is Horizon’s opinion that the historic-era deposits of site
41RT572 within the proposed ROW also do not contribute to the site’s NRHP eligibility status
under Criterion D. As such, it is Horizon’s recommendation that no additional investigations
within the historic-era deposits on this site are warranted in connection with the proposed
undertaking.
While the historic-era deposits on site 41RT572 within the proposed ROW are relatively
near-surface and are not considered contributing elements to the site’s overall NRHP eligibility
status, the site is located on an alluvial terrace on the east bank of the Brazos River where the
potential exists for deeply buried cultural deposits beyond the reach of typical shovel testing
efforts. At this time, BridgeTex is proposing to span the Brazos River via a HDD and any deeply
buried deposits associated with site 41RT572, if present, will likely be avoided by the HDD.
However, the Brazos River is a Section 10 waterway where the usage of a NWP will be
necessary for the HDD. Because of this, Horizon recommends mechanical trenching efforts at
the proposed HDD bore entry/exit location on the east side of the Brazos River to determine if
any deeply buried cultural deposits are present within alluvial sediments at this location.

8.3

PREVIOUSLY RECORDED ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES

In addition to assessing the USACE jurisdictional areas along the proposed BridgeTex
North pipeline ROW, the USACE requested that BridgeTex also take into consideration all
previously recorded archeological sites that might be present within the limits of the proposed

138

120166_arch_survey_report

A Cultural Resources Assessment of the USACE Jurisdictional Areas along BridgeTex Pipeline
Company, LLC’s Proposed BridgeTex North Pipeline ROW

ROW outside of the USACE’s jurisdiction and find ways to avoid or minimize impacts to any
listed on the NRHP or with the potential to qualify for listing on the NRHP. This included
previously recorded archeological sites documented as being eligible or potentially eligible for
listing on the NRHP, as well as any sites with a currently undetermined NRHP eligibility status.
Archival research conducted prior to the field efforts revealed the presence of
1 previously recorded archeological site within or in immediate proximity to the proposed ROW
in Segment 3 outside of the USACE jurisdictional areas. This site, 41MM133, was documented
as a prehistoric campsite that was considered to be ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP.
Although it was not considered to be significant when originally documented, this site is located
near a proposed HDD bore entry/exit location on the west side of the Brazos River. Because
the Brazos River is considered to be a Section 10 waterway where the use of a NWP will be
necessary for the HDD, the Horizon field crews reassessed this site and the results of the
reassessment are presented below.
8.3.1

Site 41MM133
General Description

Site 41MM133 is a previously recorded prehistoric lithic scatter on a large sandy knoll
just west of the Brazos River (USACE jurisdictional crossing W BORE-1; Figures 8-10 and 8-11;
see also Figure 8-6). Recorded in 1978 by Molly Godwin during a cultural resources survey of
the Phillips Coal Company’s Calvert Prospect, the site is described as consisting of lithic
debitage and burned rock fragments that were observed on the northwestern slope of a knoll
overlooking a large ravine that drains into the Brazos River. Godwin noted that the lithic scatter
was heaviest midway up the slope. Although the THC’s Atlas database contains only a point on
the map for the location of the site (see Figure 8-10), Godwin noted that the area of occupation
measured 656.2 by 656.2 feet (200.0 by 200.0 m). These dimensions suggested that the site
occupied roughly the northern half of the large knoll on which it is mapped. The NRHP eligibility
status of this site is not listed on its corresponding site form. However, Godwin recommended
no further investigations on the site, suggesting that she may have considered it to be ineligible
for listing on the NRHP.
BridgeTex is proposing to install the proposed pipeline beneath the Brazos River at this
location via an HDD. While an HDD would normally serve to avoid the use of any federal
permits, the Brazos River is a Section 10 waterway that will require the utilization of a NWP as
well as PCN with the USACE. As the HDD bore entry location is located on the eastern slope of
the landform containing site 41MM133, Horizon reassessed this portion of the site, to the extent
feasible, in compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA.
Horizon’s reassessment of this site was somewhat problematic due to the fact that a
strict landowner entry agreement allowed for a cultural resources assessment within only
25.0 feet (7.6 m) of the proposed centerline and the excavation of no more than 10 shovel tests
across the entire property. As such, a thorough assessment of the proposed ROW at this
location was not possible. However, since the Brazos River will be spanned via an HDD at this
location, Horizon focused the available shovel testing allotment on the HDD bore entry location

Chapter 8.0: Results – Segment 3

on this property as this is where the greatest potential for near-surface cultural deposits would
occur (see Figure 8-11).
Upon arriving at the proposed HDD bore entry location on the eastern side of site
41MM133, the Horizon crew found the landform to consist of a deforested area covered with
short grasses and forbs (Figure 8-12). Because the field crew could only excavate a maximum
of 10 shovel tests on the property and had to assess another nearby USACE jurisdictional area
within the same allotment, the field crew opted to excavate a total of 8 shovel tests within the
area of the HDD bore entry point. Of these, 6 produced cultural materials between depths of
0.0 and 19.7 inches (0.0 and 50.0 cm) below surface. All 8 of the excavated shovel tests also
encountered sterile red clay at depths between 9.8 and 19.2 inches (25.0 and 50.0 cm) below
surface, indicating the potential for only shallow cultural deposits on the elevated knoll.
Observed Cultural Materials
The 6 positive shovel tests excavated on site 41MM133 produced a total of 23 lithic
specimens that included mainly primary, secondary, and tertiary chert flakes (Figure 8-13). One
small chert core and 1 edge-modified flake were also part of the lithic assemblage. Aside from
the lithic specimens, no other cultural materials, such as burned rock, formal stone, tools,
ceramics, or preserved floral/faunal remains, were encountered within any of the excavated
shovel tests.
Cultural Features
No evidence of any cultural features was noted on the surface of the site, and no
materials indicative of subsurface features were noted within any of the 8 shovel tests
excavated on the site. However, Godwin noted the presence of burned rock on the
northwestern slope of the site when she originally recorded it in 1978. This suggests that some
usage of heated stones occurred on portions of the site at some point during prehistory.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
As previously noted, Godwin originally recorded site 41MM133 as measuring 656.2 by
656.2 feet (200.0 by 200.0 m). Horizon’s investigations within the HDD bore location were
wholly contained within this horizontal extent if it is mapped from the site centroid provided on
the Atlas database. As such, no additional data was acquired that would suggest a revision in
these boundaries.
In regard to the vertical extent of the site, Godwin only noted surface deposits of lithic
debitage and burned rock on the northwestern slope of the landform. Horizon’s shovel testing
efforts on the site revealed the presence of chert flaking debris between depths of 0.0 and
19.7 inches (0.0 and 50.0 cm) below surface and the presence of sterile red clay at depths
between 9.8 and 19.2 inches (25.0 and 50.0 cm). This suggests that the cultural deposits on
the site, at least within the assessed HDD bore location, measure no more than 19.2 inches
(50.0 cm) in thickness above sterile clay soils on the upland landform. This is supported by the
fact that the soil mapped across the landform is Travis loamy fine sand, 3 to 8% slopes, eroded,
which consists of 14.0 inches (35.6 cm) of fine sandy loam over red, sandy clay.

Chapter 8.0: Results – Segment 3

Summary
Site 41MM133 is a previously recorded aboriginal lithic scatter that likely represents an
upland encampment on an elevated knoll west of the Brazos River. When originally recorded in
1978, Godwin recommended no additional investigations on the site, suggesting that she
considered it to be ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP. Horizon’s current investigations within
the HDD bore pit location on the site found the site to contain lithic debitage deposits similar to
those noted by Godwin on the site, but no evidence of burned rock was noted. Additionally, no
formal stone tools, ceramics, or preserved floral/faunal remains were encountered on the site.
While it is likely that site 41MM133 is ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP based on the
presence of shallow cultural deposits consisting of only lithic debris, Horizon’s investigations on
site 41MM133 were limited to only the HDD bore pit location on the site, and the entire site was
not assessed. As such, without a formal NRHP eligibility status listed on the site form, the
NRHP eligibility status of site 41MM133 as a whole is considered to be undetermined.
However, based on the presence of only shallow, non-diagnostic cultural deposits, it is
Horizon’s opinion that the portion of site 41MM133 contained within the HDD bore pit location is
a non-contributing element to the overall NRHP eligibility status of the site. With this in mind, it
is Horizon’s further opinion that the utilization of the location for an HDD bore pit will pose no
adverse impacts to significant cultural resources and that no additional investigations are
warranted at this location.

8.4

AREAS REQUIRING MECHANICAL TRENCHING

Within areas of deep alluvium where the potential exists for buried cultural deposits at
depths greater than those accessible via traditional shovel testing methods (i.e., greater than
3.3 feet [1.0 m]), the THC requires deeper subsurface investigations, such as mechanical
trenching, in order to prospect for deeply buried cultural deposits. Horizon’s field efforts
included the documentation of areas containing alluvial deposits and a determination of the
potential for deeply buried cultural deposits at each USACE jurisdictional area assessed during
the survey-level field efforts. In all, a total of 11 USACE jurisdictional areas requiring the usage
of a NWP were identified in Segment 3 where the potential exists for deeply buried cultural
deposits and mechanical trenching is recommended. These crossings are noted in Table 8-1.
At this time, Horizon has yet to be released to conduct any recommended backhoe trenching
efforts for the undertaking. Once these trenching efforts are complete, the results will be
presented as an addendum to this document.

8.5

AREAS REQUIRING SURVEY

During the course of the survey efforts of the USACE jurisdictional areas within
Segment 3, several of them were located on parcels where the landowner prohibited access
onto their property and 1 is located at a location of a recently rerouted portion of the ROW. As
such, these locations were not assessed and still require a cultural resources survey to
determine the presence/absence of undocumented cultural deposits. In all, a total of 8 USACE
jurisdictional areas within Segment 3 of the proposed ROW still require a survey. These
crossings are noted in Table 8-1. At this time, Horizon has yet to be released to conduct the

144

120166_arch_survey_report

A Cultural Resources Assessment of the USACE Jurisdictional Areas along BridgeTex Pipeline
Company, LLC’s Proposed BridgeTex North Pipeline ROW

necessary cultural resources surveys on these 8 crossings. Once these survey efforts are
complete, the results will be presented as an addendum to this document.

9.0 RESULTS – SEGMENT 4

9.1

GENERAL FINDINGS

Segment 4 of the proposed BridgeTex South ROW measures approximately 98.0 miles
(157.7 km) in length and extends through Grimes, Montgomery, and Harris counties, Texas (see
Figures 1-1 and 1-5). Within Segment 4, biologists under the direction of Zephyr identified a
total of 50 USACE jurisdictional areas where a NWP will be necessary for the construction of
the proposed pipeline. These 50 USACE jurisdictional areas have a combined overall length of
10,000.0 feet (3048.0 m). The TSMASS require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear
projects measuring 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width. As the length of the 50 USACE jurisdictional
areas within Segment 4 of the proposed ROW total approximately 10,000.0 feet (3048.0 m) in
combined length, a total of 30 shovel tests would have been necessary within the USACE
jurisdictional areas in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by
excavating a total of 165 shovel tests within the USACE jurisdictional areas within Segment 4 of
the proposed ROW.
Due to the high number of assessed USACE jurisdictional areas along the length of
Segment 4, it would be impractical, as well as redundant, to discuss the results of the cultural
resources survey of every single location, especially when the survey produced negative results
at the majority of them. Therefore, to aid in an expeditious review of the results by permitting
agencies, the results for each assessed USACE jurisdictional area where a NWP permit will be
necessary for pipeline construction are summarized in tabular format in Table 9-1. This table
presents: (1) the name and type of each assessed USACE jurisdictional area; (2) previously
documented cultural resources within 0.5 miles (0.8 km) of each location; (3) the number of
shovel tests excavated at each location; (4) a brief description and NRHP eligibility
determination of newly discovered archeological sites at each location, if any; (5) a brief
description of the soils at each location and a notation regarding the potential for deeply buried
cultural deposits; and finally (6) Horizon’s recommendations pertaining to the need for
avoidance measures or additional investigations, including backhoe trenching efforts.
While the presentation of the results in tabular format will aid in the presentation of the
negative data, it is not sufficient for a thorough presentation of the positive results. With this in
mind, all newly recorded archeological sites are thoroughly discussed in Section 9.2 of this
chapter, and any previously recorded archeological sites that were assessed are discussed in
Section 9.3. Recommendations for mechanical trenching efforts are summarized in Section 9.4.

A Cultural Resources Assessment of the USACE Jurisdictional Areas along BridgeTex Pipeline
Company, LLC’s Proposed BridgeTex North Pipeline ROW

9.2

NEWLY RECORDED ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES

The cultural resources survey of the 50 USACE jurisdictional areas within Segment 4 of
the proposed BridgeTex North pipeline ROW where the usage of a NWP will be necessary
resulted in the documentation of no newly recorded archeological sites. This is likely due to the
fact that the majority of the major water courses traversed by the proposed ROW will be
spanned via HDDs or because sites were buried deeper than depths reached by typical shovel
testing efforts. Sites spanned by HDDs in Segment 4 are discussed in Chapter 13.0 of this
document, while areas requiring mechanical trenching are presented later in this chapter.

9.3

PREVIOUSLY RECORDED ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES

In addition to assessing the USACE jurisdictional areas along the proposed BridgeTex
North pipeline ROW, the USACE requested that BridgeTex also take into consideration all
previously recorded archeological sites that might be present within the limits of the proposed
ROW outside of the USACE’s jurisdiction and find ways to avoid or minimize impacts to any
listed on the NRHP or with the potential to qualify for listing on the NRHP. This included
previously recorded archeological sites documented as being eligible or potentially eligible for
listing on the NRHP, as well as any sites with a currently undetermined NRHP eligibility status.
Archival research conducted prior to the field efforts revealed the presence of
1 previously recorded archeological site within or in immediate proximity to the proposed ROW
in Segment 4, outside of the USACE jurisdictional areas. This site, 41GM5, was documented
as a historic-era farmstead with an undetermined NRHP eligibility status. Because of its
undetermined NRHP eligibility status, the Horizon field crews reassessed this site. The results
of the reassessment are presented below.
9.3.1

Site 41GM5
General Description

Site 41GM5 was originally documented in 1980 as the remains of a 19th-century
homestead associated with the Stephen F. Austin colony in Grimes County (Figure 9-1). It is
located on an upland ridge and side slope approximately 9005.9 feet (2745.0 m) east and
2657.5 feet (810.0 m) north of the intersection of FM 149 and FM 2562, approximately 4.0 miles
(6.4 km) southeast of Roans Prairie, Grimes County, Texas (see Figure 9-1). At the time of the
recordation, the site consisted of a well-preserved historic house that was being restored by the
landowner, who was a descendent of the original builder. Ruins of a syrup mill and the site of
slave quarters and a community school house were noted as once being part of this complex.
However, none of the buildings associated with these were standing in 1980. Based on the site
form, the remaining house was built with a central breezeway and had 4 chimneys. Of these,
only 2 were left and both were in a bad state of repair. Based on its association with the
Stephen F. Austin colony, the original recorders recommended the site as being eligible for
inclusion on the NRHP.

A Cultural Resources Assessment of the USACE Jurisdictional Areas along BridgeTex Pipeline
Company, LLC’s Proposed BridgeTex North Pipeline ROW

In 2012, SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) reassessed the northeastern
boundary of site 41GM5 during a cultural resources survey of the Texas Express Pipeline ROW.
This ROW, along with a large overhead transmission line, is located directly between site
41GM5 and the currently proposed BridgeTex North ROW. At that time, the SWCA
archeologists noted that the location of the former house structure was observed, but that it was
no longer standing as it had been in 1980. It is also not visible at the location of the site on
Google Earth. During the reassessment of the site, the SWCA archeologists excavated a total
of 13 shovel tests within the then-proposed Texas Express ROW along the northeastern side of
the site. All 13 produced negative results, although metal detecting efforts did confirm a late
19th- to early 20th-century occupation at this location. Based on the lack of structures or intact
cultural deposits within the Texas Express ROW, coupled with prior disturbances from pipeline
and transmission line construction, SWCA indicated that the portion of site 41GM5 within the
Texas Express ROW was a non-contributing element to the overall NRHP eligibility status of the
site.
In regard to the current BridgeTex North ROW, the northeastern boundary of site 41GM5
is mapped approximately 45.0 feet (13.7 m) southwest of the ROW centerline and immediately
southwest of USACE jurisdictional area POND W4 (see Figure 9-1). The field crew noted the
remains of the aforementioned house site approximately 262.8 feet (80.0 m) southwest, and
outside, of the currently proposed ROW (Figure 9-2). As can be seen in the photo, little of this
structure remains aside from a chimney. Within the limits of the proposed ROW to the northeast
of the mapped site boundaries, the field crew observed no materials or structural remains
associated with the site, and the excavation of 4 shovel tests within USACE jurisdictional area
POND W4 produced entirely negative results. The field crew noted the presence of 3 existing
pipelines and 1 transmission line between the currently proposed ROW and the edge of site
41GM5 (Figure 9-3).
Observed Cultural Materials
No cultural materials associated with site 41GM5 were observed within the limits of the
proposed ROW. The proposed ROW does not extend through the mapped boundaries of site
41GM5, but rather is located approximately 45.0 feet (13.7 m) to the northeast of the mapped
site boundaries. A prior SWCA survey of the Texas Express ROW, which is located between
the currently proposed ROW and the boundaries site 41GM5, also produced negative results.
Cultural Features
The only cultural features noted on the site were the remains of the house structure that
had been noted during the 1980 and 2012 assessments of the site. These remains are located
262.8 feet (80.0 m) southwest of the currently proposed ROW and will not be impacted by the
current undertaking.

Company, LLC’s Proposed BridgeTex North Pipeline ROW

Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
No evidence of site 41GM5 was documented within the proposed BridgeTex North
ROW. As such, the horizontal and vertical extents of this previously recorded site were not
revised.
Summary
Site 41GM5 was originally recorded in 1980 as a historic-era homestead associated with
the Stephen F. Austin Colony. At that time, the site retained considerably more integrity and
was recommended as being eligible for inclusion on the NRHP. Three decades later, a
reevaluation of the site by SWCA during a survey of the Texas Express pipeline ROW found
little remaining of the site aside from the chimneys associated with the once-present house.
SWCA’s survey found no intact cultural deposits associated with 41GM5 within the Texas
Express ROW, and resulted in a recommendation that the portion of the site within that ROW
was a non-contributing element to the overall NRHP eligibility status of the site.
Horizon’s current survey efforts revealed that 3 pipelines and 1 transmission line extend
along the northeastern boundary of site 41GM5 between the site and the currently proposed
BridgeTex North ROW. As currently mapped, the boundaries of site 41GM5 do not extend into
the limits of the proposed BridgeTex North ROW, and no cultural materials or deposits
suggesting otherwise were noted during the current survey efforts. With this in mind, it is
Horizon’s opinion that the proposed BridgeTex North ROW will pose no adverse effects to site
41GM5, and no additional cultural investigations are warranted at this location.

9.4

AREAS REQUIRING MECHANICAL TRENCHING

Within areas of deep alluvium where the potential exists for buried cultural deposits at
depths greater than those accessible via traditional shovel testing methods (i.e. greater than
3.3 feet [1.0 m]), the THC requires deeper subsurface investigations, such as mechanical
trenching, in order to prospect for deeply buried cultural deposits. Horizon’s field efforts
included the documentation of areas containing alluvial deposits and a determination of the
potential for deeply buried cultural deposits at each USACE jurisdictional area assessed during
the survey-level field efforts. In all, a total of 4 USACE jurisdictional areas requiring the usage
of a NWP were identified in Segment 4 where the potential exists for deeply buried cultural
deposits and mechanical trenching is recommended. These crossings are noted in Table 9-1.
At this time, Horizon has yet to be released to conduct any recommended backhoe trenching
efforts for the undertaking. Once these trenching efforts are complete, the results will be
presented as an addendum to this document.

9.5

AREAS REQUIRING SURVEY

During the course of the survey efforts of the USACE jurisdictional areas within
Segment 4, one of the crossings was located on a parcel where the landowner prohibited
access onto their property. As such, this location was not assessed and still requires a cultural
resources survey to determine the presence/absence of undocumented cultural deposits. This
crossing is noted in Table 9-1. At this time, Horizon has yet to be released to conduct the

HJN 120166 AR

necessary cultural resources surveys on this property. Once these survey efforts are complete,
the results will be presented as an addendum to this document.

10.1

GENERAL FINDINGS

Of the 65 overall USACE jurisdictional areas identified by biologists under the direction
of Zephyr within Segment 1 of the proposed BridgeTex South ROW, a total of 20 will be
spanned via HDDs. Because these HDDs serve to avoid impacts to waters of the US, no
federal permitting efforts are necessary for the pipeline construction efforts beneath these
20 USACE jurisdictional areas. In the absence of any federal actions, the HDD locations are
not regulated by Section 106 of the NHPA, as amended, and a cultural resources survey was
not necessary for any federal compliance. Despite the lack of federal regulation at these HDD
locations, Horizon archeological field crews still surveyed these 20 USACE jurisdictional areas
to determine the presence/absence of cultural resources at each location and allow for their
consideration in the event that pipeline construction plans were altered and the need for the
utilization of federal permitting ever becomes necessary. In all, a total of 119 shovel tests were
excavated within the 20 USACE jurisdictional areas within Segment 1 that will be spanned via
HDDs.
Table 10-1 summarizes all identified USACE jurisdictional areas within Segment 1 that
will be spanned via a HDD. This table also includes the total number of shovel tests excavated
at each location, any archeological sites identified, and recommendations for any necessary
actions at each location if construction efforts change from the installation of the pipeline via a
HDD. Any documented archeological sites within the HDD areas are discussed in Section 10.2.

10.2

ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES WITHIN HDD LOCATIONS

As can be seen in Table 10-1, the cultural resources survey of the 20 USACE
jurisdictional areas within Segment 1 that will be spanned by HDDs resulted in the
documentation of 10 newly recorded archeological sites (41BR587, 41BR588, 41BR589.
41FS121, 41FS122, 41FS123, 41FS124, 41TA312, 41TA313, and 41TA314). These sites are
discussed separately below.

A Cultural Resources Assessment of the USACE Jurisdictional Areas along BridgeTex Pipeline
Company, LLC’s Proposed BridgeTex North Pipeline ROW

10.2.1 Site 41BR587
General Description
Site 41BR587 represents the remains of a moderate-density aboriginal lithic scatter
located 0.9 miles (1.5 km) to the southeast of the intersection of CR 478 and CR 479 near May
in Brown County, Texas. The site is situated adjacent to the eastern bank of Hog Creek
(USACE jurisdictional crossings W86/W87/W88) at an elevation of 1750.0 feet (533.5 m) amsl
(Figures 10-1 and 10-2). An existing pipeline ROW is located immediately south of the site (see
Figure 10-2). The vegetation in the surrounding area consists of cacti, yucca, and short, wild
grasses with scattered patches of Ashe juniper and mesquite trees (Figure 10-3). As
documented during the current survey, site 41BR587 measures 1099.0 feet (335.0 m) in length
by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width within the proposed ROW. The site boundaries were
documented only within the proposed ROW.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41BR587 consist entirely of aboriginal lithic
specimens. The observed lithic assemblage includes approximately 50 primary, secondary, and
tertiary flakes and 3 biface fragments, 2 of which appear to have been utilized as scrapers
(Figures 10-4 and 10-5). All of the materials observed on 41BR587 were manufactured from
white and light gray to grayish-brown, medium- to fine-grained chert. Aside from the observed
lithic specimens, no temporally diagnostic formal tools, preserved floral or faunal remains, or
thermally altered rocks were noted on the site.
Cultural Features
No cultural features were observed on the modern ground surface of the site, and no
evidence of subsurface cultural features was noted within any of the 11 shovel tests excavated
on the site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of cultural materials on the modern ground surface and within
shovel tests, site 41BR587 measures approximately 1099.0 feet (335.0 m) northwest to
southeast along the length of the proposed ROW by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) northeast to southwest.
Site boundaries were documented only within the proposed ROW, and undocumented portions
of the site may extend to the northeast and southwest beyond the documented site boundaries.
A total of 11 shovel tests excavated on site 41BR587 revealed 3.9 to 39.3 inches
(10.0 to 100.0 cm) of dark, reddish-brown silty clay loam deposits overlying gravelly, reddishbrown clay. Cultural materials were observed in the upper 29.5 inches (75.0 cm) of sediments
in 4 of the 11 shovel tests excavated on the site as well as scattered across the modern ground
surface.

Summary
Site 41BR587 is a moderate-density aboriginal lithic scatter situated adjacent to the
eastern bank of Hog Creek. A total of 11 shovel tests were excavated on site 41BR587.
Cultural materials were observed in the upper 29.5 inches (75.0 cm) of sediments in 4 of the
11 shovel tests excavated on the site as well as scattered across the modern ground surface.
No evidence of any cultural features or preserved floral or faunal remains was encountered
during survey on the site. The site boundaries were delineated only within the proposed ROW,
and the cultural materials on site 41BR587 may extend northeast and southwest of the
boundaries of the proposed ROW. As the full extent of site 41BR587 was not delineated, its
NRHP eligibility status is considered to be undetermined. The deposits within the proposed
ROW consist of only a moderate-density scatter of lithic specimens. However, the depth of soils
on site 41BR587 extend deeper than 3.3 feet (1.0 m), indicating the potential for cultural
deposits to be buried deeper than capable of being excavated within a shovel test. As such, it
remains to be determined if the deposits contained within the proposed ROW are contributing
elements to the site’s overall NRHP eligibility status. Horizon therefore recommends the
avoidance and protection of the portion of site 41BR587 within the proposed ROW until the full
extent of the vertical deposits can be assessed and a formal determination of its NRHP eligibility
status is made. If avoidance and protection are not possible, Horizon recommends mechanical
trenching and/or NRHP eligibility testing on 41BR587 in order to assess the vertical extent and
significance of deposits on the site.

Chapter 10.0: HDD Locations – Segment 1

At this time, BridgeTex is proposing to span the Hog Creek via an HDD. As a result, the
construction of the proposed pipeline does not require the usage of any federal permits and is
thereby also not regulated by Section 106 of the NHPA. The length of the HDD will likely span
the limits of site 41BR587 and avoid any impacts to this site. Nonetheless, Horizon further
recommends that BridgeTex review the dimensions of site 41BR587 provided in Figures 10-1
and 10-2 and then align the proposed HDD bore entry/exit locations outside of the mapped
boundaries of the site in order to avoid any and all impacts to the potentially significant cultural
deposits on the site.
10.2.2 Site 41BR588
General Description
Site 41BR588 represents the remains of a low-density aboriginal lithic scatter located
0.6 miles (1.0 km) to the southwest of the intersection of Ranch Road (RR) 583 and CR 425
near May in Brown County, Texas. The site is situated adjacent to the eastern and western
banks of Lost Creek (USACE jurisdictional crossing CRK W92) at an elevation of 1540.0 feet
(469.5 m) amsl (Figures 10-6 and 10-7). An existing pipeline ROW is located immediately south
of the site (see Figure 10-7). The vegetation in the surrounding area consists of Ashe juniper,
cacti, mesquite, oaks, and short, wild grasses (Figure 10-8). As documented during the current
survey, site 41BR588 measures 590.0 feet (180.0 m) in length by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width
within the proposed ROW. The site boundaries were documented only within the proposed
ROW.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41BR588 consist entirely of aboriginal lithic
specimens. The observed lithic assemblage includes approximately 20 secondary and tertiary
flakes and 1 distal projectile point fragment (Figure 10-9). All of the materials observed on
41BR588 were manufactured from light gray to grayish-brown, medium-grained chert. Aside
from the observed lithic specimens, no temporally diagnostic formal tools, preserved floral or
faunal remains, or thermally altered rocks were noted on the site.
Cultural Features
No cultural features were observed on the modern ground surface on the site, and no
evidence of subsurface cultural features was noted within any of the 8 shovel tests excavated
on the site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of cultural materials on the ground surface and within shovel
tests, site 41BR588 measures approximately 590.0 feet (180.0 m) northwest to southeast along
the length of the proposed ROW by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) northeast to southwest. Site boundaries
were documented only within the proposed ROW, and undocumented portions of the site may
extend to the northeast and southwest beyond the documented site boundaries.

A total of 11 shovel tests excavated on site 41BR588 revealed 3.9 to 39.3 inches
(10.0 to 100.0 cm) of dark reddish-brown silty clay loam deposits overlying gravelly, reddishbrown clay. Cultural materials were observed in the upper 35.4 inches (90.0 cm) of sediments
in 4 of the 8 shovel tests excavated on the site as well as scattered across the modern ground
surface.
Summary
Site 41BR588 is a low-density aboriginal lithic scatter situated adjacent to the eastern
and western banks of Lost Creek. A total of 8 shovel tests were excavated on site 41BR588.
Cultural materials were observed in the upper 35.4 inches (90.0 cm) of sediments in 4 of the
8 shovel tests excavated on the site, as well as scattered across the modern ground surface.
No evidence of cultural features, temporally diagnostic stone tools, or preserved floral or faunal
remains was encountered during the survey on the site. The site boundaries were delineated
only within the proposed ROW, and the cultural materials on site 41BR588 may extend
northeast and southwest of the boundaries of the proposed ROW. As the full extent of site
41BR588 was not delineated, its NRHP eligibility status is considered to be undetermined. The
deposits within the proposed ROW consist of only a low-density scatter of lithic specimens.
However, the depth of soils in at least 1 shovel test excavated on site 41BR588 extends deeper
than 3.3 feet (1.0 m), indicating the potential for deeply buried cultural deposits beyond the
reach of a typical shovel test. As such, it remains to be determined if the deposits contained
within the proposed ROW are contributing elements to the site’s overall NRHP eligibility status.
Horizon therefore recommends the avoidance and protection of the portion of site 41BR588
within the proposed ROW until the full extent of the vertical deposits can be assessed and a
formal determination of its NRHP eligibility status is made. If avoidance and protection are not
possible, Horizon recommends mechanical trenching and/or NRHP eligibility testing on
41BR588 in order to assess the vertical extent and significance of deposits on the site.
At this time, BridgeTex is proposing to span Lost Creek via a HDD. As a result, the
construction of the proposed pipeline does not require the usage of any federal permits and is
thereby also not regulated by Section 106 of the NHPA. The length of the HDD will likely span
the limits of site 41BR588 and avoid any impacts to this site. Nonetheless, Horizon further
recommends that BridgeTex review the dimensions of site 41BR588 provided in Figures 10-6
and 10-7 and then align the proposed HDD bore entry/exit locations outside of the mapped
boundaries of the site in order to avoid any and all impacts to the potentially significant cultural
deposits on the site.
10.2.3 Site 41BR589
General Description
Site 41BR589 represents the remains of a low-density aboriginal lithic scatter located
3.1 miles (5.0 km) to the east of the intersection of FM 2940 and SH 279 near Cross Plains in
Brown County, Texas. The site is situated adjacent to the eastern bank of Paint Creek (USACE
jurisdictional crossing CRK W106) at an elevation of 1530.0 feet (466.5 m) amsl (Figures 10-10
and 10-11). An existing pipeline ROW is located just to the north of the site (see Figure 10-11).

The vegetation within the site boundaries has been heavily disturbed during clearing activities
by the landowner. However, the vegetation in the surrounding area consists of cacti, mesquite,
oaks, and short, wild grasses (Figure 10-12). As documented during the current survey, site
41BR589 measures 735.0 feet (224.0 m) in length by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width within the
proposed ROW. The site boundaries were documented only within the then-proposed ROW.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41BR589 consist entirely of aboriginal lithic
specimens. The observed lithic assemblage includes approximately 1 secondary flake,
9 tertiary flakes, and 1 biface fragment that may have been utilized as a scraper (Figures 10-13
and 10-14). All of the materials observed on 41BR589 were manufactured from light gray to
dark grayish-brown, medium- to fine-grained chert. Additionally, 3 burned rock fragments were
observed scattered on the ground surface of site 41BR589 (Figure 10-15). These burned rock
fragments do not appear to represent an intact feature. Aside from the observed lithic
specimens, no temporally diagnostic formal tools or preserved floral or faunal remains were
noted on the site.
Cultural Features
No cultural features were observed on the modern ground surface of the site, and no
evidence of subsurface cultural features was noted within any of the 6 shovel tests excavated
on the site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of cultural materials on the modern ground surface, site
41BR589 measures approximately 735.0 feet (224.0 m) northwest to southeast along the length
of the proposed ROW by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) northeast to southwest. Site boundaries were
documented only within the then-proposed ROW, and undocumented portions of the site may
extend to the northeast and southwest beyond the documented site boundaries.
A total of 6 shovel tests excavated on site 41BR589 revealed 3.9 to 19.7 inches
(10.0 to 50.0 cm) of reddish-brown fine sandy loam deposits overlying dark reddish-brown clay.
No cultural materials were observed in subsurface contexts.
Summary
Site 41BR589 is a low-density aboriginal lithic scatter situated adjacent to the eastern
bank of Paint Creek. A total of 6 shovel tests were excavated on site 41BR589. No subsurface
cultural materials were observed in any of the 6 shovel tests excavated on the site. Additionally,
no evidence of any intact cultural features or preserved floral or faunal remains was
encountered during the survey on the site. The site boundaries were delineated only within the
then-proposed ROW, and the cultural materials on site 41BR589 may extend northeast and
southwest beyond the current documented boundaries. However, the deposits within the thenproposed ROW consist of only a low-density scatter of lithic specimens. Based upon the lack of

cultural deposits, it is Horizon’s opinion that the portion of site 41BR589 within the thenproposed ROW is considered to be a non-contributing element to the site’s overall NRHP
eligibility status. Due to a reroute, site 41BR589 is now located 131.2 feet (40.0 m) to the south
beyond the boundaries of the current proposed BridgeTex ROW. No additional investigations of
this portion of site 41BR589 are warranted at this time since the site falls beyond the boundaries
of BridgeTex’s current proposed ROW alignment and will not be affected by the current
undertaking.
10.2.4 Site 41FS121
General Description
Site 41FS121 represents the remains of a low-density aboriginal lithic scatter located
0.6 miles (1.0 km) to the northwest of the intersection of CR 12 and CR 170 near Sweetwater in
Fisher County, Texas. The site is situated adjacent to the eastern bank of Sweetwater Creek
(USACE jurisdictional crossing XL15N) at an elevation of 1945.0 feet (593.0 m) amsl
(Figures 10-16 and 10-17). An existing pipeline ROW is located immediately south of the site
(see Figure 10-17). The vegetation in the surrounding area consists of cacti, yucca, and short,
wild grasses with scattered patches of Ashe juniper and mesquite trees (Figure 10-18). The
southeastern portion of site 41FS121 is situated within a plowed field. As documented during
the current survey, site 41FS121 measures 312.0 feet (95.0 m) in length by 100.0 feet (30.5 m)
in width within the proposed ROW. The site boundaries were documented only within the
proposed ROW.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41FS121 consist of aboriginal lithic specimens and
shell fragments.
The observed lithic assemblage includes approximately 10 primary,
secondary, and tertiary flakes as well as 2 freshwater mussel shell fragments (Figure 10-19).
All of the lithic materials observed on 41FS121 were manufactured from light gray to grayishbrown, medium-grained chert. Aside from the observed lithic specimens and shell fragments,
no temporally diagnostic formal tools, preserved floral remains, or thermally altered rocks were
noted on the site.
Cultural Features
No cultural features were observed on the modern ground surface of the site, and no
evidence of subsurface cultural features was noted within any of the 6 shovel tests excavated
on the site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of cultural materials on the modern ground surface and within
shovel tests, site 41FS121 measures approximately 312.0 feet (95.0 m) northwest to southeast
along the length of the proposed ROW by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) northeast to southwest. Site
boundaries were documented only within the proposed ROW, and undocumented portions of
the site may extend to the northeast and southwest beyond the documented site boundaries.

(35.0 to 60.0 cm) of reddish-brown silty loam deposits overlying compact reddish-brown silty
loam with high concentrations of calcite inclusions. Very compact alluvial soils were present on
site 41FS121, making it difficult to excavate shovel tests deeper than 26.3 inches (60.0 cm).
Cultural materials were observed in the upper 11.8 inches (30.0 cm) of sediments in 2 of the
6 shovel tests excavated on the site; however, cultural materials are predominantly restricted to
the modern ground surface.
Summary
Site 41FS121 is a low-density aboriginal lithic scatter situated adjacent to the eastern

The site boundaries were delineated only within the proposed ROW, and the cultural materials
on site 41FS121 may extend northeast and southwest of the boundaries of the proposed ROW.
As the full extent of site 41FS121 was not delineated, its NRHP eligibility status is considered to
be undetermined. The deposits within the proposed ROW consist of only a low-density scatter
of lithic specimens. However, compact, alluvial soils present on site 41FS121 precluded the
ability to excavate shovel tests into sterile subsoil. As such, it remains to be determined if
deeply buried deposits are present within the proposed ROW that could be considered
contributing elements to the site’s overall NRHP eligibility status.
Horizon therefore
recommends the avoidance and protection of the portion of site 41FS121 within the proposed
ROW until the full extent of the vertical deposits can be assessed and a formal determination of
its NRHP eligibility status is made. If avoidance and protection of the site are not possible,
Horizon recommends mechanical trenching on site 41FS121 in order to assess the vertical
extent and potential significance of deposits on the site.
At this time, BridgeTex is proposing to span Sweetwater Creek via an HDD. As a result,
the construction of the proposed pipeline does not require the usage of any federal permits and
is thereby also not regulated by Section 106 of the NHPA. The length of the HDD will likely
span the limits of site 41FS121 and avoid any impacts to this site. Nonetheless, Horizon further
recommends that BridgeTex review the dimensions of site 41FS121 provided in Figures 10-16
and 10-17 and then align the proposed HDD bore entry/exit locations outside of the mapped
boundaries of the site in order to avoid any and all impacts to the potentially significant cultural
deposits on the site.
10.2.5 Site 41FS122
General Description
Site 41FS122 represents the remains of a low-density aboriginal lithic scatter located
1.2 miles (1.9 km) to the southwest of the intersection of CR 121 and CR 136 near Sweetwater
in Fisher County, Texas. The site is situated adjacent to the eastern bank of a large tributary

feeder of Bluff Creek (USACE jurisdictional crossing CRK T4) at an elevation of 2040.0 feet
(622.0 m) amsl (Figures 10-20 and 10-21). An existing pipeline ROW is located immediately
south of the site (see Figure 10-21). The vegetation in the surrounding area consists of cacti,
yucca, and short, wild grasses with scattered patches of Ashe juniper and mesquite trees
(Figure 10-22). As documented during the current survey, site 41FS122 measures 328.0 feet
(100.0 m) in length by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width within the proposed ROW. The site
boundaries were documented only within the proposed ROW.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41FS122 consist entirely of aboriginal lithic
specimens. The observed lithic assemblage includes approximately 20 secondary and tertiary
flakes and 1 biface fragment (Figure 10-23). All of the materials observed on 41FS122 were
manufactured from light gray to grayish-brown, medium-grained chert. Aside from the observed
lithic specimens, no temporally diagnostic formal tools, preserved floral or faunal remains, or
thermally altered rocks were noted on the site.
Cultural Features
No cultural features were observed on the modern ground surface of the site, and no
evidence of subsurface cultural features was noted within any of the 6 shovel tests excavated
on the site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of cultural materials on the modern ground surface, site
41FS122 measures approximately 328.0 feet (100.0 m) northwest to southeast along the length
of the proposed ROW by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) northeast to southwest. Site boundaries were
documented only within the proposed ROW, and undocumented portions of the site may extend
to the northeast and southwest beyond the documented site boundaries.
A total of 6 shovel tests excavated on site 41FS122 revealed 5.9 to 39.3 inches
(15.0 to 100.0 cm) of reddish-brown silty clay loam (with some gypsum intermixed) deposits
overlying gravelly, red clay. Cultural materials were observed in the upper 9.8 inches (25.0 cm)
of sediments in 1 of the 6 shovel tests excavated on the site; however, cultural materials are
predominantly restricted to the modern ground surface.
Summary
Site 41FS122 is a low-density aboriginal lithic scatter situated adjacent to the eastern

portion of site 41FS122 within the proposed ROW is considered to be a noncontributing element
to the site’s overall NRHP eligibility status. No additional investigations are recommended
within the portion of the site within the proposed ROW.
At this time, BridgeTex is proposing to span the unnamed tributary to Bluff Creek via a
HDD. As a result, the construction of the proposed pipeline does not require the usage of any
federal permits and is thereby also not regulated by Section 106 of the NHPA. The length of the

Horizon further recommends that BridgeTex review the dimensions of site 41FS122 provided in
Figures 10-20 and 10-21 and then align the proposed HDD bore entry/exit locations outside of
the mapped boundaries of the site in order to avoid any and all impacts to cultural deposits on
the site.

10.2.10 Site 41TA315
General Description
Site 41TA315 represents the remains of an aboriginal open campsite located 1.3 miles
(2.1 km) to the northwest of the intersection of Buffalo Gap Road and FM 707 near Abilene in
Taylor County, Texas. The site is situated on the west bank of Elm Creek at an elevation of
1815.0 feet (533.3 m) amsl (Figures 10-38 and 10-39). An existing pipeline ROW is located
immediately south of the site (see Figure 10-39). The vegetation in the surrounding area
consists of cacti, yucca, and short, wild grasses with scattered patches of mesquite trees;
however little to no vegetation is present within the site boundaries (Figure 10-40). As
documented during the current survey, site 41TA315 measures 328.0 feet (100.0 m) in length
by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width within the proposed ROW. The site boundaries were
documented only within the proposed ROW.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41TA315 consist of aboriginal lithic specimens and
charcoal flecks. The observed lithic assemblage includes approximately 15 primary, secondary
and tertiary flakes (Figure 10-41). All of the materials observed on 41TA315 were manufactured
from light gray to grayish-brown, medium-grained chert. In addition to the observed lithic
specimens, a concentration of carbonized remains was observed at approximately 27.5 to
39.3 inches (70.0 to 100.0 cm) below ground surface in 1 of 6 shovel tests excavated on the site
(Figure 10-42). Aside from the lithic and carbonized remains observed on site 41TA315, no
temporally diagnostic formal tools, preserved faunal remains, or thermally altered rocks were
noted on the site.
Cultural Features
As noted above, a concentration of carbonized remains was observed within 1 of
6 shovel tests excavated on the site. Although, no thermally altered rocks or lithic specimens
were observed in association with this charcoal concentration, it is possible that the
concentration may represent the remnants of a hearth feature. No additional cultural features
were observed on the modern ground surface of site 41TA315, and no additional evidence of
subsurface cultural features was noted within any of the 6 shovel tests excavated on the site.

Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of cultural materials on the modern ground surface and in
shovel tests, site 41TA315 measures approximately 328.0 feet (100.0 m) northwest to southeast
along the length of the proposed ROW by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) northeast to southwest. Site
boundaries were documented only within the proposed ROW, and undocumented portions of
the site may extend to the northeast and southwest beyond the documented site boundaries.
A total of 6 shovel tests excavated on site 41TA315 revealed 17.8 to 39.3 inches
(35.0 to 100.0 cm) of reddish-brown and yellowish-red sandy clay loam deposits overlying dark,
reddish-brown clay. Cultural materials were observed in 15.8 to 39.3 inches (40.0 to 100.0 cm)
of sediments in 2 of the 6 shovel tests excavated on the site. Additionally, cultural materials
were also observed on the modern ground surface.
Summary
Site 41TA315 is an aboriginal open campsite situated just to the west of Elm Creek. A
total of 6 shovel tests were excavated on site 41TA315. Cultural materials were observed in
15.8 to 39.3 inches (40.0 to 100.0 cm) of sediments in 2 of the 6 shovel tests excavated on the
site. Cultural materials were also observed on the modern ground surface. A concentration of
carbonized remains that may represent the remnants of a hearth was observed in 1 of 6 shovel

tests excavated on the site. However, no evidence of temporally diagnostic stone tools,
thermally altered rocks, or preserved faunal remains was encountered during survey on the site.
The site boundaries were delineated only within the proposed ROW, and the cultural materials
on site 41TA315 may extend northeast and southwest of the boundaries of the proposed ROW.
As the full extent of site 41TA315 was not delineated, its NRHP eligibility status is considered to
be undetermined. The deposits within the proposed ROW consist of only a high-density scatter
of lithic specimens and carbonized remains. However, cultural deposits on site 41TA315 extend
up to 3.3 feet (1.0 m) indicating the potential for cultural deposits to be buried deeper than
capable of being excavated within a shovel test. Additionally, the carbonized remains suggest
that the potential exists for preserved floral and faunal remains to be present elsewhere on the
site. As such, it remains to be determined if the deposits contained within the proposed ROW
are contributing elements to the site’s overall NRHP eligibility status. Horizon therefore
recommends the avoidance and protection of the portion of site 41TA315 within the proposed
ROW until the full extent of the vertical deposits can be assessed and a formal determination of
its NRHP eligibility status is made. If avoidance and protection of the site are not possible,
Horizon recommends mechanical trenching on site 41TA315 in order to assess the vertical
extent and potential significance of deposits on the site.
At this time, BridgeTex is proposing to span Elm Creek via an HDD. As a result, the
construction of the proposed pipeline does not require the usage of any federal permits and is
thereby also not regulated by Section 106 of the NHPA. The length of the HDD will likely span
the limits of site 41TA315 and avoid any impacts to this site. Nonetheless, Horizon further
recommends that BridgeTex review the dimensions of site 41TA315 provided in Figures 10-38
and 10-39 and then align the proposed HDD bore entry/exit locations outside of the mapped
boundaries of the site in order to avoid any and all impacts to the potentially significant cultural
deposits on the site.

11.0 HDD LOCATIONS – SEGMENT 2

11.1

GENERAL FINDINGS

Of the 82 overall USACE jurisdictional areas identified by biologists under the direction
of Zephyr within Segment 2 of the proposed BridgeTex South ROW, a total of 30 will be
spanned via HDDs. Because these HDDs serve to avoid impacts to waters of the US, no
federal permitting efforts are necessary for the pipeline construction efforts beneath these
30 USACE jurisdictional areas. In the absence of any federal actions, the HDD locations are
not regulated by Section 106 of the NHPA, as amended, and a cultural resources survey was
not necessary for any federal compliance. Despite the lack of federal regulation at these HDD
locations, Horizon archeological field crews still surveyed these 30 USACE jurisdictional areas
to determine the presence/absence of cultural resources at each location and allow for their
consideration in the event that pipeline construction plans were altered and the need for the
utilization federal permitting ever became necessary. In all, a total of 116 shovel tests were
excavated within the 30 USACE jurisdictional areas within Segment 2 that will be spanned via
HDDs.
Table 11-1 below summarizes all identified USACE jurisdictional areas within Segment 2
that will be spanned via a HDD. This table also includes the total number of shovel tests
excavated at each location, any archeological sites identified, and recommendations for any
necessary actions at each location if construction efforts change from the installation of the
pipeline via a HDD. Any documented archeological sites within the HDD areas are discussed in
Section 11.2.

11.2

ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES WITHIN HDD LOCATIONS

As can be seen in Table 11-1, the cultural resources survey of the 30 USACE
jurisdictional areas within Segment 2 that will be spanned by HDDs resulted in the
documentation of no newly recorded archeological sites. All sites documented in Segment 2
have been previously discussed in Chapter 7.0. It should be noted that site 41CV275 is located
within Segment 2, outside of the USACE jurisdictional areas. While BridgeTex intends to install
the pipeline via an HDD at this location, the site was discussed in Chapter 7.0 within the section
pertaining to previously recorded archeological sites along the proposed ROW.

12.1

GENERAL FINDINGS

Of the 115 overall USACE jurisdictional areas identified by biologists under the direction
of Zephyr within Segment 3 of the proposed BridgeTex South ROW, a total of 35 will be
spanned via HDDs. Because these HDDs serve to avoid impacts to waters of the US, no
federal permitting efforts are necessary for the pipeline construction efforts beneath these
35 USACE jurisdictional areas. In the absence of any federal actions, the HDD locations are
not regulated by Section 106 of the NHPA, as amended, and a cultural resources survey was
not necessary for any federal compliance. Despite the lack of federal regulation at these HDD
locations, Horizon archeological field crews still surveyed these 35 USACE jurisdictional areas
to determine the presence/absence of cultural resources at each location and allow for their
consideration in the event that pipeline construction plans were altered and the need for the
utilization of federal permitting ever became necessary. In all, a total of 126 shovel tests were
excavated within the 35 USACE jurisdictional areas within Segment 3 that will be spanned via
HDDs.
Table 12-1 below summarizes all identified USACE jurisdictional areas within Segment 3
that will be spanned via a HDD. This table also includes the total number of shovel tests
excavated at each location, any archeological sites identified, and recommendations for any
necessary actions at each location if construction efforts change from the installation of the
pipeline via a HDD. Any documented archeological sites within the HDD areas are discussed in
Section 12.2.

12.2

ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES WITHIN HDD LOCATIONS

As can be seen in Table 12-1, the cultural resources survey of the 35 USACE
jurisdictional areas within Segment 3 that will be spanned by HDDs resulted in the
documentation of 4 newly recorded archeological sites (41RT17, 41RT573, 41RT574, and
41RT575). These sites are discussed separately below.

A Cultural Resources Assessment of the USACE Jurisdictional Areas along BridgeTex Pipeline
Company, LLC’s Proposed BridgeTex North Pipeline ROW

12.2.1 Site 41RT17
General Description
Site 41RT17 is a previously recorded prehistoric campsite located on the east side of the
Little Brazos River (USACE jurisdictional crossing CRK C1_WEST; Figure 12-1). Recorded in
1978 by Molly Godwin during a cultural resources survey of the Phillips Coal Company’s Calvert
Prospect, the site is described as consisting of a thin scatter of aboriginal lithic debris, bone, and
mussel shell on 3 separate knolls overlooking the Little Brazos River. In addition, a distal
projectile point tip and a possible ceramic sherd were also observed during the site’s
assessment. Godwin describes encountering orange clay at a depth of 19.7 inches (50.0 cm)
below surface in 1 shovel test, but notes that subsurface clay was not encountered in other
shovel tests excavated to depths of 27.6 inches (70.0 cm) below surface. Due to the potential
for deeply buried deposits, Godwin recommended additional investigations on the site to
determine if buried soil horizons and midden materials were present. While no NRHP eligibility
status is listed on the site form, it is currently considered to be undetermined based on Godwin’s
recommendation for additional work.
A Horizon archeological field crew attempted to reevaluate site 41RT17 on 9 April 2013.
As originally described, the field crew found the site to consist of elevated knolls on the east
side of the Little Brazos River (Figure 12-2; see Figure 12-1). Horizon’s reevaluation of 41RT17
was relatively minimal, consisting of entering the property containing the site and excavating a
total of 6 shovel tests along the length of the proposed pipeline ROW on the site before the
landowner arrived and required the field crew to vacate the property immediately. As such, the
portion of site 41RT17 within the currently proposed ROW was not entirely assessed. However,
the minimal investigations that did take place on the site resulted in the documentation of
cultural deposits extending to depths of at least 3.28 feet (1.0 m) below surface, as well as the
documentation of 1 engraved ceramic sherd.
Observed Cultural Materials
When site 41RT17 was originally recorded, Godwin described a thin scatter of lithic
debris on the knolls on which the site is located. During the current investigations, the Horizon
crew found the site to consist of open pasture covered with dense grasses that provided little
surface visibility (see Figure 12-3). As a result, no cultural materials were observed on the
surface of the site within the limits of the currently proposed ROW. However, shovel testing
efforts did produce a total of 14 chert flakes and 2 fragments of carbonized material between
11.8 and 31.5 inches (30.0 and 80.0 cm) below surface, and 8 chert flakes, 1 fragment of
carbonized material, and 1 engraved ceramic sherd between 31.5 and 39.4 inches (80.0 and
100.0 cm) below surface in 5 of the 6 excavated shovel tests on the site. As the landowner was
displeased to find the field crew on his property, all observed artifacts were replaced
immediately and were not available for further examination. However, the field crew
photographed the materials prior to leaving the site (Figures 12-4 and 12-5).

Godwin did note the presence of mussel shell and bone fragments on the site. While
Horizon did observe carbonized floral materials, no faunal specimens were observed during the
short visit to the site.
Cultural Features
No cultural features were observed on the surface of the site, and no burned rock
suggestive of subsurface baking features was encountered within any of the 6 shovel tests
excavated within the proposed ROW across the site. However, the presence of 3 fragments of
carbonized material during the shovel testing efforts suggests that the presence of subsurface
features is highly likely on the site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
When originally recorded, Godwin noted that the site measured 1312.3 feet (400.0 m)
northeast to southwest by 820.2 feet (250.0 m) northwest to southeast. As the Horizon crew
was required to vacate the property prior to completing the reassessment of the site, there is no
data to suggest a revision of its originally recorded boundaries.
Godwin’s original recording of the site only mentioned sandy loam soils over sterile clay,
though the site form does not list the depths of observed cultural materials other than surface
contexts on the northern and northeastern slopes of the knolls comprising the site. Horizon’s

HJN 120166 AR

221

Chapter 12.0: HDD Locations – Segment 3

shovel testing efforts on the site revealed the presence of chert flaking debris and carbonized
materials between depths of 11.8 and 39.4 inches (30.0 and 100.0 cm) below surface, and
aboriginal ceramics between depths of 31.5 and 39.4 inches (80.0 and 100.0 cm). Coupled with
Godwin’s observed surface materials, the current findings reflect at least 3.3 feet (1.0 m) of
cultural deposits on the site with the potential for even deeper cultural deposits in areas where
shovel testing failed to encounter subsurface clay.
Summary
Site 41RT17 is an extensive prehistoric encampment on the east side of the Little
Brazos River that was originally recorded in 1978 by Molly Godwin. Her investigations resulted
in the documentation of lithic debris, faunal remains, a projectile point fragment, and 1 possible
ceramic sherd, leading her to recommend additional investigations on the site to assess the
buried soil horizons and prospect for midden materials.
Although Horizon’s reevaluation of the site was terminated shortly after it began, the
findings did reveal the presence of at least 3.3 feet (1.0 m) of cultural deposits within the portion
of the site contained within the currently proposed ROW. Moreover, the investigations also
revealed the presence of datable carbonized materials and temporally diagnostic aboriginal
ceramics within the cultural deposits on the site. As the current investigations were limited to
only the portion of the site within the currently proposed ROW, the overall NRHP eligibility status
of site 41RT17 is still considered to be undetermined. However, based on the presence of deep
cultural deposits containing temporally diagnostic materials, it is Horizon’s opinion the portion of
site 41RT17 within the currently proposed ROW could constitute a contributing element to the
site’s NRHP eligibility status and warrants further assessment. Horizon recommends that site
41RT17 be completely avoided and protected during the construction of the proposed
BridgeTex North ROW. If avoidance and protection are not possible, Horizon recommends
NRHP eligibility testing on the site to formally assess its significance.
At this time, BridgeTex is proposing to span the Little Brazos River via an HDD. As a
result, the construction of the proposed pipeline does not require the usage of any federal
permits and is thereby also not regulated by Section 106 of the NHPA. The length of the HDD
will likely span the limits of site 41RT17 and avoid any impacts to this site. Nonetheless,
Horizon further recommends that BridgeTex review the dimensions of site 41RT17 provided in
Figures 12-1 and 12-2 and then align the proposed HDD bore entry/exit locations outside of the
mapped boundaries of the site in order to avoid any and all impacts to the potentially significant
cultural deposits on the site.
12.2.2 Site 41RT573
General Description
Site 41RT573 represents the remains of a moderate-density aboriginal lithic scatter
located 1.4 miles (1.5 km) to the west of the intersection of SH 6 and Red Hill Road near Calvert
in Robertson County, Texas. The site is situated adjacent to the eastern bank of Sandy Creek
(USACE jurisdictional crossing DESKTOP CRK) at an elevation of 290.0 feet (88.4 m) amsl

Company, LLC’s Proposed BridgeTex North Pipeline ROW

(Figures 12-6 and 12-7). An existing pipeline ROW is located to the south of the site
(see Figure 12-6). The vegetation in the surrounding area consists of bull nettle, cacti, green
brier, and short, annual grasses. Mature hackberry, elm, and oaks are located close to the
creek (Figure 12-8). As documented during the current survey, site 41RT573 measures
885.6 feet (270.0 m) in length by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width within the proposed ROW. The
site boundaries were documented only within the proposed ROW.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41RT573 consist entirely of aboriginal lithic
specimens. The observed lithic assemblage includes approximately 2 primary, 5 secondary,
and 55 tertiary flakes; 3 possible scrapers; and 1 serrated-edge tool (Figure 12-9). All of the
materials observed on 41RT573 were manufactured from tan and reddish-brown to grayishbrown, medium- to fine-grained chert. Aside from the observed lithic specimens, no temporally
diagnostic formal tools, preserved floral or faunal remains, or thermally altered rocks were noted
on the site.
Cultural Features
No cultural features were observed on the modern ground surface of the site, and no
evidence of subsurface cultural features was noted within any of the 11 shovel tests excavated
on the site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of cultural materials on the modern ground surface and within
shovel tests, site 41RT573 measures approximately 290.0 feet (88.4 m) northwest to southeast
along the length of the proposed ROW by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) northeast to southwest. Site
boundaries were documented only within the proposed ROW, and undocumented portions of
the site may extend to the northeast and southwest beyond the documented site boundaries.
A total of 11 shovel tests excavated on site 41RT573 revealed more than 3.3 feet
(1.0 m) of brown and dark grayish-brown sandy loam deposits. Cultural materials were
observed in up to 3.3 feet (1.0 m) of sediments in 6 of the 11 shovel tests excavated on the site.
No cultural materials were visible on the modern ground surface of the site.
Summary
Site 41RT573 is a moderate-density aboriginal lithic scatter situated adjacent to the
eastern bank of Sandy Creek. A total of 11 shovel tests were excavated over site 41RT573.
Cultural materials were observed in up to 3.3 feet (1.0 m) of sediments in 6 of the 11 shovel
tests excavated on the site. No evidence of any cultural features or preserved floral or faunal
remains was encountered during survey on the site. The site boundaries were delineated only
within the proposed ROW, and the cultural materials on site 41RT573 may extend northeast
and southwest of the boundaries of the proposed ROW. As the full extent of site 41RT573 was
not delineated, its NRHP eligibility status is considered to be undetermined. The deposits within
the proposed ROW consist of only a moderate-density scatter of lithic specimens. However,

cultural deposits on site 41RT573 extend up to 3.3 feet (1.0 m), indicating the potential for
cultural deposits to be buried deeper than capable of being excavated within a shovel test. As
such, it remains to be determined if the deposits contained within the proposed ROW are
contributing elements to the site’s overall NRHP eligibility status.
Horizon therefore
recommends the avoidance and protection of the portion of site 41RT573 within the proposed
ROW until the full extent of the vertical deposits can be assessed and a formal determination of
its NRHP eligibility status is made. If avoidance and protection of the site are not possible,
Horizon recommends mechanical trenching and/or NRHP eligibility testing on site 41RT573 in
order to assess the vertical extent and potential significance of deposits on the site.
At this time, BridgeTex is proposing to span the wetland feature and unnamed tributary
to Peters Slough via a HDD. As a result, the construction of the proposed pipeline does not
require the usage of any federal permits and is thereby also not regulated by Section 106 of the
NHPA. The length of the HDD will likely span the limits of site 41RT573 and avoid any impacts
to this site. Nonetheless, Horizon further recommends that BridgeTex review the dimensions of
site 41RT573 provided in Figures 12-6 and 12-7 and then align the proposed HDD bore
entry/exit locations outside of the mapped boundaries of the site in order to avoid any and all
impacts to the potentially significant cultural deposits on the site.
12.2.3 Site 41RT574
General Description
Site 41RT574 represents the remains of a low-density aboriginal lithic scatter located
1.9 miles (1.5 km) to the southwest of the intersection of SH 6 and Wildcat Road near Calvert in
Robertson County, Texas. The site is situated approximately 75.0 feet (22.8 m) to the
northwest of a wetland feature (USACE jurisdictional area WET C2-1) and unnamed tributary to
Peters Slough at an elevation of 300.0 feet (91.5 m) amsl (Figures 12-10 and 12-11). An
existing pipeline ROW is located to the south of the site (see Figure 12-10). The vegetation in
the surrounding area consists of short annual grasses with scattered oak trees (Figure 12-12).
As documented during the current survey, site 41RT574 measures 196.8 feet (60.0 m) in length
by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width within the proposed ROW. The site boundaries were
documented only within the proposed ROW.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41RT574 consist entirely of aboriginal lithic
specimens. The observed lithic assemblage includes approximately 8 tertiary flakes (Figure 1213). All of the materials observed on 41RT574 were manufactured from grayish-brown,
medium- to fine-grained chert. Aside from the observed lithic specimens, no temporally
diagnostic formal tools, preserved floral or faunal remains, or thermally altered rocks were noted
on the site.
Cultural Features
No cultural features were observed on the modern ground surface, and no evidence of
subsurface cultural features was noted within any of the 7 shovel tests excavated on the site.

Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of cultural materials on the modern ground surface and within
shovel tests, site 41RT574 measures approximately 196.8 feet (60.0 m) northwest to southeast
along the length of the proposed ROW by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) northeast to southwest. Site
boundaries were documented only within the proposed ROW, and undocumented portions of
the site may extend to the northeast and southwest beyond the documented site boundaries.
A total of 7 shovel tests excavated on site 41RT574 revealed up to 3.3 feet (1.0 m) of
brown and yellowish-brown sandy loam deposits. Cultural materials were observed in up to
3.3 feet (1.0 m) of sediments in 3 of the 7 shovel tests excavated on the site. Cultural materials
were not visible on the modern ground surface of the site.
Summary
Site 41RT574 is a low-density aboriginal lithic scatter situated to the northwest of a
wetland feature and unnamed tributary to Peters Slough. A total of 7 shovel tests were
excavated over site 41RT574. Cultural materials were observed in up to 3.3 feet (1.0 m) of
sediments in 3 of the 7 shovel tests excavated on the site. No evidence of any cultural features
or preserved floral or faunal remains was encountered during survey on the site. The site
boundaries were delineated only within the proposed ROW, and the cultural materials on site
41RT574 may extend northeast and southwest of the boundaries of the proposed ROW. As the
full extent of site 41RT574 was not delineated, its NRHP eligibility status is considered to be
undetermined. The deposits within the proposed ROW consist of only a low-density scatter of
lithic specimens. However, cultural deposits on site 41RT574 extend up to 3.3 feet (1.0 m)

12.2.4 Site 41RT575
General Description
Site 41RT575 represents the remains of a moderate-density aboriginal lithic scatter
located 2.7 miles (4.3 km) to the northeast of the intersection of SH 6 and Wheelock near
Hearne in Robertson County, Texas. The site is situated adjacent to the eastern bank of Little
Pin Oak Creek (USACE jurisdictional crossing CRK C16) at an elevation of 370.0 feet (112.8 m)
amsl (Figures 12-14 and 12-15). An existing pipeline ROW is located to the south of the site
(see Figure 12-14). The vegetation in the surrounding area consists primarily of short annual
grasses with scattered hackberry, pecan, and oak trees (Figure 12-16). As documented during
the current survey, site 41RT575 measures 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in length by 100.0 feet (30.5 m)
in width within the proposed ROW. The site boundaries were documented only within the
proposed ROW.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41RT575 consist entirely of aboriginal lithic
specimens. The observed lithic assemblage includes approximately 15 secondary and tertiary
flakes (Figures 12-17). All of the materials observed on 41RT575 were manufactured from
white and reddish-brown to grayish-brown, medium- grained chert. Aside from the observed
lithic specimens, no temporally diagnostic formal tools, preserved floral or faunal remains, or
thermally altered rocks were noted on the site.
Cultural Features
No cultural features were observed on the modern ground surface of the site, and no
evidence of subsurface cultural features was noted within any of the 12 shovel tests excavated
on the site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of cultural materials on the modern ground surface and within
shovel tests, site 41RT575 measures approximately 100.0 feet (30.5 m) northwest to southeast
along the length of the proposed ROW by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) northeast to southwest. Site
boundaries were documented only within the proposed ROW, and undocumented portions of
the site may extend to the northeast and southwest beyond the documented site boundaries.
A total of 12 shovel tests excavated on site 41RT575 revealed up to 39.3 inches
(100.0 cm) of brown sandy loam deposits. Cultural materials were observed in up to
39.3 inches (100.0 cm) of sediments in 6 of the 12 shovel tests excavated on the site; as well as
scattered along the modern ground surface.
Summary
Site 41RT575 is a moderate-density aboriginal lithic scatter situated adjacent to the
eastern bank of Little Pin Oak Creek. A total of 12 shovel tests were excavated on site

13.1

GENERAL FINDINGS

Of the 128 overall USACE jurisdictional areas identified by biologists under the direction
of Zephyr within Segment 4 of the proposed BridgeTex South ROW, a total of 78 will be
spanned via HDDs. Because these HDDs serve to avoid impacts to waters of the US, no
federal permitting efforts are necessary for the pipeline construction efforts beneath these
78 USACE jurisdictional areas. In the absence of any federal actions, the HDD locations are
not regulated by Section 106 of the NHPA, as amended, and a cultural resources survey was
not necessary for any federal compliance. Despite the lack of federal regulation at these HDD
locations, Horizon archeological field crews still surveyed these 78 USACE jurisdictional areas
to determine the presence/absence of cultural resources at each location and allow for their
consideration in the event that pipeline construction plans were altered and the need for the
utilization federal permitting ever became necessary. In all, a total of 259 shovel tests were
excavated within the 78 USACE jurisdictional areas within Segment 4 that will be spanned via
HDDs.
Table 13-1 below summarizes all identified USACE jurisdictional areas within Segment 4
that will be spanned via a HDD. This table also includes the total number of shovel tests
excavated at each location, any archeological sites identified, and recommendations for any
necessary actions at each location if construction efforts change from the installation of the
pipeline via a HDD. Any documented archeological sites within the HDD areas are discussed in
Section 13.2.

13.2

ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES WITHIN HDD LOCATIONS

As can be seen in Table 13-1, the cultural resources survey of the 78 USACE
jurisdictional areas within Segment 4 that will be spanned by HDDs resulted in the
documentation of 4 newly recorded archeological sites (41GM460, 41GM461, 41MQ307, and
41MQ308). These sites are discussed separately below.

A Cultural Resources Assessment of the USACE Jurisdictional Areas along BridgeTex Pipeline
Company, LLC’s Proposed BridgeTex North Pipeline ROW

13.2.1 Site 41GM460
General Description
Site 41GM460 represents the remains of a low-density aboriginal lithic scatter located
0.4 miles (0.6 km) to the northwest of the intersection of CR 178 and SH 90 near Singleton in
Grimes County, Texas. The site is situated within an existing transmission line ROW along the
northwestern bank of a tributary feeder of Cat Creek at an elevation of 1148.0 feet (350.0 m)
amsl (Figures 13-1 and 13-2). An existing pipeline ROW is located to the north of the site (see
Figure 13-2). The vegetation in the surrounding area consists primarily of short annual grasses,
weedy plants, and wildflowers with pine trees along the edges of the site (Figure 13-3). As
documented during the current survey, site 41GM460 measures 885.6 feet (270.0 m) in length
by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width within the proposed ROW. The site boundaries were
documented only within the proposed ROW.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41GM460 consist entirely of aboriginal lithic
specimens.
The observed lithic assemblage includes approximately 15 tertiary flakes
(Figure 13-4). All of the materials observed on 41GM460 were manufactured from white to
dark, reddish-brown, medium-grained chert. Aside from the observed lithic specimens, no
temporally diagnostic formal tools, preserved floral or faunal remains, or thermally altered rocks
were noted on the site.
Cultural Features
No cultural features were observed on the modern ground surface on the site, and no
evidence of subsurface cultural features was noted within any of the 8 shovel tests excavated
on the site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of cultural materials on the modern ground surface and within
shovel tests, site 41GM460 measures approximately 885.6 feet (270.0 m) northwest to
southeast along the length of the proposed ROW by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) northeast to southwest.
Site boundaries were documented only within the proposed ROW, and undocumented portions
of the site may extend to the northeast and southwest beyond the documented site boundaries.
A total of 7 shovel tests excavated on site 41GM460 revealed more than 3.3 feet (1.0 m)
of brown and pale brown sandy loam deposits. Cultural materials were observed in up to
3.3 feet (1.0 m) of sediments in 5 of the 8 shovel tests excavated on the site and along the
modern ground surface.
Summary
Site 41GM460 is a low-density aboriginal lithic scatter situated to the northwest of a
jurisdictional wetland feature and unnamed tributary of Peters Slough. A total of 7 shovel tests
were excavated over site 41GM460. Cultural materials were observed in sediments up to

3.3 feet (1.0 m) below surface in 3 of the 7 shovel tests excavated on the site. No evidence of
any cultural features or preserved floral or faunal remains was encountered during survey on
the site. The site boundaries were delineated only within the proposed ROW, and the cultural
materials on site 41GM460 may extend northeast and southwest of the boundaries of the
proposed ROW. As the full extent of site 41GM460 was not delineated, its NRHP eligibility
status is considered to be undetermined. The deposits within the proposed ROW consist of
only a low-density scatter of lithic specimens. However, cultural deposits on site 41GM460
extend at least to 3.3 feet (1.0 m), indicating the potential for cultural deposits to be buried
deeper than capable of being excavated within a shovel test. As such, it remains to be
determined if the deposits contained within the proposed ROW are contributing elements to the
site’s overall NRHP eligibility status. Horizon therefore recommends the avoidance and
protection of the portion of site 41GM460 within the proposed ROW until the full extent of the
vertical deposits can be assessed and a formal determination of its NRHP eligibility status is
made. If avoidance and protection of the site are not possible, Horizon recommends
mechanical trenching on site 41GM460 in order to assess the vertical extent and potential
significance of deposits on the site.
At this time, BridgeTex is proposing to span the tributary feeder of Cat Creek via an
HDD. As a result, the construction of the proposed pipeline does not require the usage of any
federal permits and is thereby also not regulated by Section 106 of the NHPA. The length of the
HDD will likely span the limits of site 41GM460 and avoid any impacts to this site. Nonetheless,
Horizon further recommends that BridgeTex review the dimensions of site 41GM460 provided in
Figures 13-1 and 13-2 and then align the proposed HDD bore entry/exit locations outside of the
mapped boundaries of the site in order to avoid any and all impacts to the potentially significant
cultural deposits on the site
13.2.2 Site 41GM461
General Description
Site 41GM461 represents the remains of a low-density aboriginal lithic scatter located
0.4 miles (0.6 km) to the southwest of the intersection of Main Street and SH 39 near Iola in
Grimes County, Texas. The site is situated adjacent to the southeastern bank of the Navasota
River (USACE jurisdictional crossing CRK Z3) at an elevation of 220.0 feet (67.0 m) amsl
(Figures 13-5 and 13-6). An existing pipeline ROW is located to the south of the site (see
Figure 13-6). The vegetation in the surrounding area consists of short annual grasses with
dense hackberry, oak, and yaupon trees (Figure 13-7). As documented during the current
survey, site 41GM461 measures 131.2 feet (40.0 m) in length by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width
within the proposed ROW. The site boundaries were documented only within the proposed
ROW.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41GM461 consist entirely of aboriginal lithic
specimens. The observed lithic assemblage includes approximately 3 tertiary flakes, 1 biface
fragment, and 1 possible hammerstone (Figures 13-8 and 13-9). All of the materials observed

from the observed lithic specimens, no temporally diagnostic formal tools, preserved floral or
faunal remains, or thermally altered rocks were noted on the site.
Cultural Features
No cultural features were observed on the modern ground surface of the site, and no
evidence of subsurface cultural features was noted within any of the 6 shovel tests excavated
on the site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of cultural materials on the modern ground surface and within
shovel tests, site 41GM461 measures approximately 131.2 feet (40.0 m) northwest to southeast
along the length of the proposed ROW by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) northeast to southwest. Site
boundaries were documented only within the proposed ROW, and undocumented portions of
the site may extend to the northeast and southwest beyond the documented site boundaries.
A total of 6 shovel tests excavated on site 41GM461 revealed more than 3.3 feet (1.0 m)
pale brown sandy loam deposits. Cultural materials were observed in up to 3.3 feet (1.0 m) of
sediments in 2 of the 6 shovel tests excavated on the site and on the modern ground surface.
Cultural materials were not visible on the modern ground surface of the site.

Summary
Site 41GM461 is a low-density aboriginal lithic scatter situated on the southeastern bank
of the Navasota River. A total of 6 shovel tests were excavated over site 41GM461. Cultural
materials were observed in sediments up to 3.3 feet (1.0 m) below surface in 2 of the 6 shovel
tests excavated on the site. No evidence of any cultural features or preserved floral or faunal
remains was encountered during survey on the site. The site boundaries were delineated only
within the proposed ROW, and the cultural materials on site 41GM461 may extend northeast
and southwest of the boundaries of the proposed ROW. As the full extent of site 41GM461 was
not delineated, its NRHP eligibility status is considered to be undetermined. The deposits within
the proposed ROW consist of only a low-density scatter of lithic specimens. However, cultural
deposits on site 41GM461 extend at least to 3.3 feet (1.0 m) indicating the potential for cultural
deposits to be buried deeper than capable of being excavated within a shovel test. As such, it
remains to be determined if the deposits contained within the proposed ROW are contributing
elements to the site’s overall NRHP eligibility status. Horizon therefore recommends the
avoidance and protection of the portion of site 41GM461 within the proposed ROW until the full
extent of the vertical deposits can be assessed and a formal determination of its NRHP eligibility
status is made. If avoidance and protection of the site are not possible, Horizon recommends
mechanical trenching on site 41GM461 in order to assess the vertical extent and potential
significance of deposits on the site.
At this time, BridgeTex is proposing to span the Navasota River via an HDD. As a
result, the construction of the proposed pipeline does not require the usage of any federal
permits and is thereby also not regulated by Section 106 of the NHPA. The length of the HDD
will likely span the limits of site 41GM461 and avoid any impacts to this site. Nonetheless,
Horizon further recommends that BridgeTex review the dimensions of site 41GM461 provided in
Figures 13-1 and 13-2 and then align the proposed HDD bore entry/exit locations outside of the
mapped boundaries of the site in order to avoid any and all impacts to the potentially significant
cultural deposits on the site
13.2.3 Site 41MQ307
General Description
Site 41MQ307 represents the remains of a low-density aboriginal lithic scatter located
2.4 miles (0.5 km) to the southeast of the intersection of FM 1486 and Jackson Road near
Dobin in Montgomery County, Texas. The site is situated adjacent to the northwestern bank of
an unnamed tributary of Lake Creek (USACE jurisdictional crossing CRK W28) at an elevation
of 165.0 feet (91.5 m) amsl (Figures 13-10 and 13-11). Site 41MQ307 is adjacent to an existing
transmission line corridor; therefore, the vegetation in the surrounding area consists of short
annual grasses and various weedy plants with scattered oak and pine trees observed in the
distance (Figure 13-12). As documented during the current survey, site 41MQ307 measures
426.4.0 feet (130.0 m) in length by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width within the proposed ROW. The
site boundaries were documented only within the proposed ROW.

Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41MQ307 consist of aboriginal lithic specimens and
preserved faunal remains. The observed lithic assemblage includes approximately 5 secondary
and 10 tertiary flakes (Figure 13-13). Additionally, a preserved mammal phalanx bone was also
observed on the site (Figure 13-14). All of the materials observed on 41MQ307 were
manufactured from tan to dark-brown, medium-grained chert. Aside from the observed lithic
specimens, no temporally diagnostic formal tools, preserved floral remains, or thermally altered
rocks were noted on the site.
Cultural Features
No cultural features were observed on the modern ground surface on the site, and no
evidence of subsurface cultural features was noted within any of the 9 shovel tests excavated
on the site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of cultural materials on the modern ground surface and within
shovel tests, site 41MQ307 measures approximately 426.4.0 feet (130.0 m) northwest to
southeast along the length of the proposed ROW by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) northeast to southwest.
Site boundaries were documented only within the proposed ROW, and undocumented portions
of the site may extend to the northeast and southwest beyond the documented site boundaries.

A total of 9 shovel tests excavated on site 41MQ307 revealed 13.8 to 35.4 inches
(35.0 to 90.0 cm) of brown sandy loam deposits overlying grayish-brown clay and gravels.
Cultural materials were observed in up to 23.6 inches (60.0 cm) of sediments in 6 of the
9 shovel tests excavated on the site. Cultural materials were not visible on the modern ground
surface of the site.
Summary
Site 41MQ307 is a low-density aboriginal lithic scatter situated to the northwest of an
unnamed tributary of Lake Creek. A total of 9 shovel tests were excavated on site 41MQ307.
Cultural materials were observed in up to 23.6 inches (60.0 cm) of sediments in 6 of the
9 shovel tests excavated on the site. No evidence of any cultural features or preserved floral
remains was encountered during survey on the site. The site boundaries were delineated only
within the proposed ROW, and the cultural materials on site 41MQ307 may extend northeast
and southwest of the boundaries of the proposed ROW. As the full extent of site 41MQ307 was
not delineated, its NRHP eligibility status is considered to be undetermined. The deposits within
the proposed ROW consist of a low-density scatter of lithic specimens and 1 preserved faunal
bone. However, soils on site 41MQ307 extend up to 35.4 inches (90.0 cm), indicating the
potential for cultural deposits to be deeply buried. As such, it remains to be determined if the
deposits contained within the proposed ROW are contributing elements to the site’s overall
NRHP eligibility status. Horizon therefore recommends the avoidance and protection of the
portion of site 41MQ307 within the proposed ROW until the full extent of the vertical deposits
can be assessed and a formal determination of its NRHP eligibility status is made. If avoidance
and protection of the site are not possible, Horizon recommends mechanical trenching on site
41MQ307 in order to assess the vertical extent and potential significance of deposits on the site.
At this time, BridgeTex is proposing to span the unnamed tributary to Lake Creek via a
HDD. As a result, the construction of the proposed pipeline does not require the usage of any
federal permits and is thereby also not regulated by Section 106 of the NHPA. The length of the
HDD will likely span the limits of site 41MQ307 and avoid any impacts to this site. Nonetheless,
Horizon further recommends that BridgeTex review the dimensions of site 41MQ307 provided in
Figures 13-10 and 13-11 and then align the proposed HDD bore entry/exit locations outside of
the mapped boundaries of the site in order to avoid any and all impacts to the potentially
significant cultural deposits on the site.
13.2.4 Site 41MQ308
General Description
Site 41MQ308 represents the remains of a low-density aboriginal lithic scatter located
0.3 miles (0.5 km) to the southeast of the intersection of Hardin Store Road and Neidigk Saw
Mill Road near Pleasant Forest in Montgomery County, Texas. The site is situated within an
existing transmission line ROW on opposing banks of Decker Branch (USACE jurisdictional
crossing CRK W36) at an elevation of 165.0 feet (91.5 m) amsl (Figures 13-15 and 13-16). The
vegetation in the surrounding area consists primarily of short annual grasses, weedy plants, and
wildflowers with stands of pine trees along the edges of the site (Figure 13-17). As documented

the proposed ROW.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41MQ308 consist entirely of aboriginal lithic
specimens. The observed lithic assemblage includes approximately 13 primary, secondary, and
tertiary flakes (Figure 13-18). All of the materials observed on 41MQ308 were manufactured
from light brown to reddish-brown, medium-grained chert and quartzite. Aside from the
observed lithic specimens, no temporally diagnostic formal tools, preserved floral or faunal
remains, or thermally altered rocks were noted on the site.

14.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

14.1

GENERAL SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

Between March and July 2013, Horizon conducted a cultural resources survey of
390 USACE jurisdictional areas along BridgeTex’s proposed BridgeTex North pipeline ROW.
BridgeTex is proposing to construct this 20-inch-diameter pipeline to transport crude oil from the
Permian Basin to the Houston area for refinement. Measuring approximately 408.0 miles
(656.6 km) in length, the proposed ROW begins north of Colorado City, Texas, and navigates
east-southeastwards, terminating at the Magellan East Houston Terminal in Houston, Texas.
Along its length, the proposed ROW extends through Scurry, Fisher, Nolan, Taylor, Callahan,
Brown, Comanche, Hamilton, Coryell, McLennan, Bell, Falls, Milam, Robertson, Brazos,
Grimes, Montgomery, and Harris counties, Texas. Although the vast majority of the proposed
ROW will be located on private property and will be constructed with private funds, its
construction within 227 USACE jurisdictional areas traversed by the proposed ROW will require
the usage of NWPs issued by the USACE. As NWPs are federal permits, the portions of the
undertaking within these 227 USACE jurisdictional areas also fall under the regulations of
Section 106 of the NHPA of 1966, as amended. The remaining 163 USACE jurisdictional areas
will be spanned via HDDs and will not require the usage of any federal permits. In addition, a
short segment of the proposed ROW extends across the Alfred Hughes Prison property in
Coryell County, Texas. As this property is owned by the TDCJ, a political subdivision of the
state, this short segment of the proposed ROW on the prison property also falls under the
regulations of the ACT.
In total, the proposed BridgeTex North ROW measures approximately 408.0 miles
(656.6 km) in length and extends from Colorado City, Texas, to Houston, Texas. It has been
broken down into 4 segments that are described as follows.
Segment 1 measures
approximately 131.0 miles (210.8 km) in length and extends through Scurry, Fisher, Nolan,
Taylor, Callahan, and Brown counties, while Segment 2 measures approximately 102.0 miles
(164.2 km) in length and extends through Comanche, Hamilton, Coryell, and McLennan
counties. Segment 3 measures approximately 77.0 miles (123.9 km) in length and extends
through Bell, Falls, Milam, Robertson, and Brazos counties, while Segment 4 measures
approximately 98.0 miles (157.7 km) in length and extends through Grimes, Montgomery, and
Harris counties.

Chapter 14.0: Summary and Recommendations

The permanent ROW will measure 50.0 feet (15.2 m) wide (2472.7 acres), while the
temporary workspace of up to 45.0 feet (13.7 m) will yield a construction corridor up to 95.0 feet
(29.0 m) in width. Additional temporary workspace to allow for boring or horizontal directional
drilling will expand the construction corridor up to 150.0 feet (45.7 m) in certain non-jurisdictional
areas. Along the length of the proposed ROW, biologists under the direction of Zephyr
identified a total of 390 USACE jurisdictional areas. These USACE jurisdictional areas,
consisting of “waters of the US” and wetland areas, comprise approximately 78,000.0 feet
(23,774.4 m) of the overall ROW length (approximately 170.1 acres). For purposes of
discussion, the USACE jurisdictional areas consist of each wetland or waterway crossed by the
proposed ROW as well as the associated uplands within 100.0 feet (30.5 m) of each. Of the
390 USACE jurisdictional areas delineated along the proposed ROW, a total of 227 will be open
cut during pipeline construction and will require the usage of NWPs. Pipeline construction
efforts across the remaining 163 USACE jurisdictional areas will be via HDDs that do not require
any federal permitting actions.
At the request of Zephyr, Horizon conducted the cultural resources survey of the
390 USACE jurisdictional areas along the proposed ROW and the portion of the proposed ROW
across the Alfred Hughes Prison property on behalf of BridgeTex in compliance with Section
106 of the NHPA and the ACT. The purpose of the cultural resources survey was to:
(1) determine if any archeological sites were located within the USACE jurisdictional areas
along the proposed ROW and, if any existed, to determine if the undertaking had the potential to
have any adverse impacts on archeological sites listed on or considered eligible for listing on
the NRHP; and (2) to determine if any archeological sites were located within the portion of the
proposed ROW across the Alfred Hughes Prison property and, if any existed, to determine if the
undertaking had the potential to have any adverse impacts on archeological sites considered
eligible for formal designation as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs). Horizon utilized TAC
permit no. 6840, issued by the THC, to assess the portion of the proposed ROW across the
Alfred Hughes Prison property.
The TSMASS require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects
measuring 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width. As the length of the 390 USACE jurisdictional areas
along the proposed ROW total approximately 78,000.0 feet (23,774.4 m) in combined length, a
total of 238 shovel tests would have been necessary within the USACE jurisdictional areas in
order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of
1653 shovel tests within the USACE jurisdictional areas along the overall length of the proposed
ROW. This includes shovel testing efforts within the 163 USACE jurisdictional areas that will be
spanned via an HDD and do not require the usage of any federal permitting.
The cultural resources survey of the 227 USACE jurisdictional areas along the proposed
BridgeTex North ROW that will be open cut and require the usage of a NWP resulted in the
documentation of 8 new archeological sites and the reassessment of 4 previously recorded
archeological sites. It also resulted in the documentation of 22 USACE jurisdictional areas
where mechanical trenching is recommended in order to adequately assess locations containing
deep alluvial soils where the potential for deeply buried cultural deposits exists.

A Cultural Resources Assessment of the USACE Jurisdictional Areas along BridgeTex Pipeline
Company, LLC’s Proposed BridgeTex North Pipeline ROW

A summary of the findings at each delineated USACE jurisdictional area requiring the
usage of a NWP is presented in respect to each of the 4 pipeline segments below. Horizon’s
recommendations for each, relevant to the jurisdiction of the USACE and Section 106 of the
NHPA, are also presented within the respective pipeline segment sections. With the exception
of the Brazos River HDD, the USACE jurisdictional areas that will be spanned via HDDs are not
discussed below as the HDDs at these locations do not require any federal permitting or
compliance. However, the findings at each HDD location have been presented in Chapters 10.0
through 13.0.

14.2

SEGMENT 1 - SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Segment 1 of the proposed ROW measures a total of 131.0 miles (210.8 km) in overall
length. Within Segment 1, Horizon assessed a total of 45 USACE jurisdictional areas, totaling
9000.0 feet (2743.2.4 m) in length, where the usage of a NWP will be necessary during pipeline
construction efforts. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 195 shovel tests
within these 45 USACE jurisdictional areas. The cultural resources survey efforts within the
USACE jurisdictional areas resulted in the assessment of 4 archeological sites and the
identification of 2 locations requiring mechanical trenching to prospect for deeply buried cultural
deposits that could be located beyond the reach of typical shovel testing efforts. For ease of
review, Horizon’s findings and recommendations for each USACE jurisdictional area within
Segment 1 where a NWP will be necessary for construction are presented in Table 14-1.

14.3

SEGMENT 2 - SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Segment 2 of the proposed ROW measures a total of 102.0 miles (164.2 km) in overall
length. Within Segment 2, Horizon assessed a total of 52 USACE jurisdictional areas, totaling
10,400.0 feet (3169.9 m) in length, where the usage of a NWP will be necessary during pipeline
construction efforts. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 222 shovel tests
within these 52 USACE jurisdictional areas. The cultural resources survey efforts within the
USACE jurisdictional areas resulted in the assessment of 4 archeological sites and the
identification of 4 locations requiring mechanical trenching to prospect for deeply buried cultural
deposits that could be located beyond the reach of typical shovel testing efforts. There are also
3 USACE jurisdictional areas located on properties where access was denied and a cultural
survey is still necessary. For ease of review, Horizon’s findings and recommendations for each
USACE jurisdictional area within Segment 2 where a NWP will be necessary for construction
are presented in tabular form in Table 14-2.
In addition to the 52 USACE jurisdictional areas within Segment 2, Horizon also
assessed an approximately 0.8-mile- (1.3-km-) long segment of proposed ROW that extends
across the Alfred Hughes Prison property. These investigations were conducted under TAC
permit no. 6480. The TSMASS require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects
measuring 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width. As such, a minimum of 13 shovel tests were necessary
within this portion of the proposed ROW across publicly owned land in order to comply with the
TSMASS. Horizon met the TSMASS within the proposed ROW across this parcel by excavating
13 shovel tests along the length of the proposed ROW on the prison property. These
investigations produced entirely negative results.

14.4 SEGMENT 3 - SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Segment 3 of the proposed ROW measures a total of 77.0 miles (123.9 km) in overall
length. Within Segment 3, Horizon assessed a total of 80 USACE jurisdictional areas, totaling
16,000.0 feet (4876.8 m) in length, where the usage of a NWP will be necessary during pipeline
construction efforts. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 262 shovel tests
within these 80 USACE jurisdictional areas. The cultural resources survey efforts within the
USACE jurisdictional areas resulted in the assessment of 3 archeological sites and the
identification of 11 locations requiring mechanical trenching to prospect for deeply buried
cultural deposits that could be located beyond the reach of typical shovel testing efforts. There
are also 7 USACE jurisdictional areas located on properties where access was denied and 1
rerouted location where a cultural survey is still necessary. For ease of review, Horizon’s
findings and recommendations for each USACE jurisdictional area within Segment 3 where a
NWP will be necessary for construction are presented in tabular form in Table 14-3.

SEGMENT 4 - SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Segment 4 of the proposed ROW measures a total of 98.0 miles (157.7 km) in overall
length. Within Segment 4, Horizon assessed a total of 50 USACE jurisdictional areas, totaling
10,000.0 feet (3048.0 m) in length, where the usage of a NWP will be necessary during pipeline
construction efforts. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 165 shovel tests
within these 50 USACE jurisdictional areas. The cultural resources survey efforts within the
USACE jurisdictional areas resulted in the documentation of 1 archeological site and the
identification of 4 locations requiring mechanical trenching to prospect for deeply buried cultural
deposits that could be located beyond the reach of typical shovel testing efforts. There is also 1
USACE jurisdictional area located on a property where access was denied and a cultural survey
is still necessary. For ease of review, Horizon’s findings and recommendations for each
USACE jurisdictional area within Segment 4 where a NWP will be necessary for construction
are presented in tabular form in Table 14-4.

RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING REROUTED PORTIONS OF THE PROPOSED ROW

Given the overall length of the proposed ROW, it is highly likely that portions will need to
be rerouted in order to avoid critical environmental features, to appease landowners, or for a
variety of other reasons. At this time, Horizon has not been informed of any rerouted portions of
the proposed ROW. Because reroutes will shift the proposed ROW into areas that were not
assessed by the current survey efforts reported herein, it is possible that such shifts could move
the proposed ROW onto undocumented cultural resources. With this in mind, Horizon
recommends that all USACE jurisdictional areas within any proposed reroutes of the ROW be
surveyed for cultural resources prior to any ground-disturbing impacts. The results of any
survey efforts within rerouted portions of the proposed ROW can then be submitted as addenda
to this document.

14.7 RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING UNANTICIPATED DISCOVERIES
Any and all human remains or unmarked graves along the proposed ROW are protected
by the Texas Health and Safety Code (Chapters 711-715), the Texas Administrative Code (13
TAC §§22.1-22.6), and the Texas Penal Code (Chapter 42). Additionally, any human remains
278

120166_arch_survey_report

A Cultural Resources Assessment of the USACE Jurisdictional Areas along BridgeTex Pipeline
Company, LLC’s Proposed BridgeTex North Pipeline ROW

or unmarked graves within areas under the jurisdiction of a federal agency, such as the USACE,
are also protected under the NHPA and the Native American Graves Protection and
Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). While the current cultural resources survey efforts along the
proposed ROW found no evidence of any human remains or burials within the assessed
USACE jurisdictional areas, this does not preclude the potential for them along the overall
length of the proposed 408.0 (656.6 km) ROW. As such, all field personnel associated with the
undertaking should be made aware of the unmarked burial regulations. Specifically, if any
human remains or grave offerings are encountered at any point during development,
maintenance, or ongoing use of the proposed ROW, even in previously surveyed locations, all
work at the location of the accidental discovery should cease immediately. Following the
cessation of activity, the THC and the USACE should be notified immediately and a qualified
archeologist should be contacted to assess the find.
Additionally, if any undocumented cultural resources, such as stone tools or pottery, are
encountered during pipeline construction efforts within the USACE jurisdictional areas, even in
previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the accidental discovery should cease
immediately. Following the cessation of activity, the THC and the USACE should be notified
immediately and a qualified archeologist should be contacted to assess the find.

16.0 ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATIONS—SEGMENT 1

16.1

SEGMENT 1 PROJECT BACKGROUND

Subsequent to the initial cultural resources survey of the USACE jurisdictional areas
within Segment 1 of the proposed BridgeTex North Pipeline ROW where access was available,
Horizon prepared a full report of the investigations and submitted it for agency review (see
Chapters 6.0 and 14.0 within the main body of this document). The THC concurred with
Horizon’s findings and recommendations pertaining to Segment 1 of the proposed BridgeTex
North Pipeline ROW in a letter dated 6 September 2013.
The initial cultural resources survey efforts within the USACE jurisdictional areas in
Segment 1 resulted in the identification of 2 locations where: (1) the pipeline would be installed
within an open-cut trench and would therefore require the usage of a NWP issued by the
USACE; and (2) mechanical trenching efforts were recommended prior to construction in order
to prospect for deeply buried cultural deposits beyond the reach of typical shovel testing efforts
(see Table 14-1). These 2 trenching locations are summarized in Table 16-1.

The original survey of the proposed ROW also resulted in the documentation of site
41BR589, an aboriginal lithic scatter on Paint Creek (CRK W106). The portion of site 41BR589
within the proposed ROW at this location was assessed as being a non-contributing element to
the overall NRHP eligibility status of the site and no further work was recommended at the
location. Subsequent to the recording of this site, the proposed ROW was shifted a short
distance to the northeast, and the construction method across Paint Creek (CRK W106) was

HJN 120166 AR

297

Addendum 1
Chapter 16.0: Additional Investigations—Segment 1

changed to a HDD. Because the use of the HDD would not require the utilization of any federal
permits or compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA, the new, rerouted location was not
assessed for cultural resources.
In early October 2013, Horizon was informed that the desired construction method
across Paint Creek (CRK W106) at the rerouted location had reverted back to an open-cut
trench. As the construction efforts at this location would now require the utilization of a NWP
and, as a result, compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA, Horizon was tasked with a cultural
resources assessment of the location. This assessment included a cultural resources survey of
the USACE jurisdictional crossing, followed by mechanical trenching efforts if deep alluvial soils
were found to be present (see Table 16-1).
Horizon completed the recommended additional investigations within Segment 1 during
the months of September and October 2013. The results of these additional investigations are
presented below. For consistency with the main body of this report, and to aid in an expeditious
review of the results by permitting agencies, the results for all additional investigations within the
assessed USACE jurisdictional areas where a NWP permit will be necessary for pipeline
construction are summarized in tabular format in Table 16-2. This table presents: (1) the name
and type of each assessed USACE jurisdictional area; (2) previously documented cultural
resources within 0.5 miles (0.8 km) of each location; (3) the number of shovel tests or backhoe
trenches excavated at each location; (4) a brief description and NRHP eligibility determination of
newly discovered archeological sites at each location, if any; (5) a brief description of the soils at
each location as they pertain to the potential for deeply buried cultural deposits; and finally (6)
Horizon’s recommendations pertaining to the need for avoidance measures or additional
investigations. The specifics pertaining to the investigations at each assessed USACE
jurisdictional area are presented below.

16.2

BACKHOE TRENCHING INVESTIGATIONS

The initial cultural resources survey efforts within the USACE jurisdictional areas in
Segment 1 resulted in the identification of 2 locations requiring mechanical trenching to prospect
for deeply buried cultural deposits beyond the reach of typical shovel testing efforts, as well as
the survey/trenching of a rerouted location (see Tables 16-1 and 16-2). These 3 USACE
jurisdictional areas (CRK W101, CRK W93, and CRK W106) have a combined overall length of
1000.0 feet (304.8 m). The TSMASS require a minimum of 16 shovel tests or backhoe trenches
per mile for linear projects measuring 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width. With this in mind, a total of 3
shovel tests or backhoe trenches would have been necessary within the 3 USACE jurisdictional
areas in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a
total of 18 backhoe trenches within the 3 USACE jurisdictional areas (see Table 16-2). The
results of the trenching efforts at each USACE jurisdictional area are discussed separately
below.

Site 41BR590 has deeply buried cultural deposits that
may contribute to the site’s overall NRHP eligibility
status. Horizon recommends that this crossing be
spanned via a HDD to avoid impacts to site 41BR590
(as well as PCN with the USACE). If the desired
construction method remains as an open-cut trench,
then Horizon recommends NRHP eligibility testing
efforts on the site followed by data recovery efforts if
the site is found to be eligible for inclusion on the
NRHP.

RESULTS

16.3.1 CRK W101
A Horizon archeological field crew excavated a total of 10 backhoe trenches within
USACE jurisdictional area CRK X101 (Little Sulphur Creek). This included trenches on
opposing sides of the creek channel at 3 separate locations that are crossed by the proposed
ROW (Figure 16-1). On average, the trenches measured 10.0 feet (3.0 m) in length by 2.0 feet
(0.6 m) in width. They were excavated to a depth of approximately 6.0 feet (1.8 m) or down to
sterile, pre-Holocene clay soils, whichever was encountered first. On average, the trenches at
this crossing were excavated to a depth of 6.6 feet (2.0 m). A photograph of a typical trench
profile at CRK X101 is presented in Figure 16-2, while a sketch of a typical trench profile is
presented in Figure 16-3.
The backhoe trenching efforts at USACE jurisdictional area CRK X3101 produced
entirely negative results. No cultural materials were observed on the surface at this location,
within any of the excavated matrices, or within the resulting trench profiles.
16.3.2 CRK W93
A Horizon archeological field crew excavated a total of 4 backhoe trenches within
USACE jurisdictional area CRK W93 (Red River Creek). This included 2 trenches on each side
of the creek channel (Figure 16-4). On average, the trenches measured 10.1 feet (3.1 m) in
length by 2.0 feet (0.6 m) in width. They were excavated a depth of 6.0 feet (1.8 m) or down to
sterile, pre-Holocene clay soils, whichever was encountered first. On average, the trenches at
this crossing were excavated to a depth of 5.2 feet (1.6 m). A photograph of a typical trench
profile at CRK W93 is presented in Figure 16-5, while a sketch of a typical trench profile is
presented in Figure 16-6.
The backhoe trenching efforts at USACE jurisdictional area CRK W93 produced entirely
negative results. No cultural materials were observed on the surface at this location, within any
of the excavated matrices, or within the resulting trench profiles.
16.3.3 CRK W106
A Horizon archeological field crew excavated a total of 4 backhoe trenches within a
rerouted portion of the proposed ROW across USACE jurisdictional area CRK W106 (Paint
Creek). This included 2 trenches on each side of the creek channel (Figure 16-7). On average,
the trenches measured 9.8 feet (3.0 m) in length by 2.0 feet (0.6 m) in width. They were
excavated a maximum depth of 5.9 feet (1.8 m) or down to sterile, pre-Holocene clay soils,
whichever was encountered first. On average, the trenches at this crossing were excavated to
a depth of ranging between 1.6 and 5.9 feet (0.5 and 1.8 m). A photograph of a typical trench
profile at CRK W106 is presented in Figure 16-8, while a sketch of a typical trench profile is
presented in Figure 16-9.

Addendum 1
Chapter 16.0: Additional Investigations—Segment 1

The backhoe trenching efforts at the rerouted portion of the proposed ROW across
USACE jurisdictional area CRK W106 resulted in: (1) the revision of the boundaries of site
41BR589 that were recorded by Horizon a short distance to the south during the initial survey of
the original alignment of the proposed ROW; and (2) the documentation of a new prehistoric site
(41BR590) on the opposing side of Paint Creek at the rerouted location of the proposed ROW
(Figures 16-10 and 16-11). Each of these sites is discussed separately below.
Site 41BR589

General Description
Site 41BR589 represents the remains of a low-density aboriginal lithic scatter located
3.1 miles (5.0 km) to the east of the intersection of FM 2940 and SH 279 near Cross Plains in
Brown County, Texas. The site is situated adjacent to the eastern bank of Paint Creek (USACE
jurisdictional crossing CRK W106) at an elevation of 1530.0 feet (466.5 m) amsl (see
Figures 16-10 and 16-11). An existing pipeline ROW bisects the site (see Figure 16-11). The
vegetation within the site boundaries has been heavily disturbed during clearing activities by the
landowner. However, the vegetation in the surrounding area consists of cacti, mesquite, oaks,
and short, wild grasses (Figure 16-12). As documented during the current survey, site 41BR589
measures 669.0 feet (204.0 m) in length by 285.0 feet (87.0 m) in width. The site boundaries
encompass the currently proposed ROW as well as portions to the south of the proposed ROW.
Site 41BR589 was originally recorded by Horizon during the initial phase of pedestrian
survey of the proposed BridgeTex pipeline ROW. As the result of a reroute of the thenproposed ROW, site 41BR589 was no longer located within the proposed ROW. Horizon
surveyed the new ROW alignment during trenching efforts and determined that the boundaries
of site 41BR589 extend into the current proposed ROW alignment. Based upon the United
States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) National Resources Conversations Service (NCRS)
web soil survey, Horizon determined that alluvial soils may be present along the western bank
of Paint Creek, resulting in the increased potential for deeply buried cultural deposits. Two
backhoe trenches (CRK W106-BT1 and CRK W106-BT4) were excavated on site 41BR589 to
assess the extent of vertical deposition and the potential for deeply buried cultural deposits on
the site.

Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41BR589 consist entirely of aboriginal lithic
specimens. The observed lithic assemblage includes approximately 10 secondary flakes,
30 tertiary flakes, 1 probable core, and 1 biface fragment (Figures 16-13 through 16-15). All of
the materials observed on 41BR589 were manufactured from light gray to dark grayish-brown,
medium- to fine-grained chert. Additionally, 3 burned rock fragments were observed scattered
on the ground surface of site 41BR589 (Figure 16-16). These burned rock fragments do not
appear to represent an intact feature. Other than the observed lithic specimens, no temporally
diagnostic formal tools or preserved floral or faunal remains were noted on the site.

Cultural Features
No cultural features were observed on the modern ground surface of the site, and no
evidence of any intact subsurface cultural features was noted within any of the 7 shovel tests or
2 backhoe trenches excavated on the site. However, the presence of the observed burned rock
specimens on the site attests to some level of food preparation via heated rocks during the
occupation of the site.

Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of cultural materials on the modern ground surface and in the
excavated backhoe trenches, site 41BR589 measures approximately 669.0 feet (204.0 m)
northwest to southeast along the length of the proposed ROW by 285.0 feet (87.0 m) northeast
to southwest. Site boundaries were documented within the current proposed ROW as well as
portions to the south located within a previous ROW alignment. Undocumented portions of the
site may extend to the northeast and southwest beyond the documented site boundaries.
A total of 7 shovel tests excavated on site 41BR589 revealed 3.9 to 19.7 inches
(10.0 to 50.0 cm) of reddish-brown fine sandy loam deposits overlying dark reddish-brown clay.
No cultural materials were observed in subsurface contexts within the excavated shovel tests.
As discussed in subsequent paragraphs, 2 backhoe trenches were excavated within the
proposed ROW along the east side of Paint Creek. Both trenches measured approximately

313

Addendum 1
Chapter 16.0: Additional Investigations—Segment 1

9.8 feet (3.0 m) in length, 2.0 feet (0.6 m) in width, and were excavated to a depth range of 19.7
inches (50.0 cm) below ground surface. The cultural zone observed in the 2 backhoe trenches
ranged between 0.0 and 13.7 inches (0.0 and 35.0 cm) below surface. Sterile, weathered
bedrock was observed in the level below the cultural zone. Photographs of the trenching efforts
are presented in Figures 16-17 and 16-18, and profile drawings of the 2 backhoe trenches are
presented in Figures 16-19 and 16-20.

Summary
Site 41BR589 is a low-density aboriginal lithic scatter situated adjacent to the eastern
bank of Paint Creek. A total of 7 shovel tests and 2 backhoe trenches were excavated over site
41BR589. Cultural materials were observed in the upper 15.7 inches (40.0 cm) of sediments in
1 of the 2 backhoe trenches excavated on the site. No evidence of any temporally diagnostic
artifacts, intact cultural features, or preserved floral or faunal remains was encountered during
the investigations on the site. The site boundaries were delineated only within the proposed
ROW, and the cultural materials on site 41BR589 may extend northeast and southwest beyond
the current documented boundaries. As the entirety of the site was not assessed, its overall
NRHP eligibility status remains undetermined. However, the cultural deposits on the site within
the limits of the proposed ROW consist of only a low-density scatter of lithic specimens. Based
on the lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts, preserved floral or faunal remains, or stratified,
buried cultural deposits, it is Horizon’s opinion that the portion of site 41BR589 within the
proposed ROW is considered to be a non-contributing element to the site’s overall NRHP
eligibility status. With this in mind, no additional investigations are recommended within the
portion of site 41BR589 within the limits of the currently proposed ROW.
Site 41BR590
General Description
Site 41BR590 represents the remains of a low-density aboriginal lithic scatter located
3.1 miles (5.0 km) to the east of the intersection of FM 2940 and SH 279 near Cross Plains in
Brown County, Texas. The site is situated adjacent to the western bank of Paint Creek (USACE
jurisdictional crossing CRK W106) at an elevation of 1530.0 feet (466.5 m) amsl (see
Figures 16-10 and 16-11). An existing pipeline ROW is located just to the southwest of the site
(see Figure 16-11). The vegetation within the site boundaries consists of cacti, mesquite, oaks,
and short, wild grasses (Figure 16-21). As documented during the current survey, site 41BR590
measures 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in length by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width within the proposed
ROW. The site boundaries were documented only within the proposed ROW.
During the initial phase of pedestrian survey, Horizon excavated 2 shovel tests on the
west bank of Paint Creek at the original location of the proposed ROW. These 2 shovel tests
produced negative results. However, based upon the USDA’s NCRS web soil survey and
shovel testing efforts, Horizon determined that alluvial soils were present along the western
bank of Paint Creek, resulting in the increased potential for deeply buried cultural deposits.

Site 41BR590 was recorded during backhoe trenching and subsequent shovel testing
efforts during the assessment of a rerouted portion of the proposed ROW across Paint Creek
(USACE jurisdictional crossing CRK W106). Horizon excavated 2 backhoe trenches (CRK
W106-BT2 and CRK W106-BT3) and 4 shovel tests on this site, west of Paint Creek, to assess
the extent of vertical and horizontal deposition and the potential for deeply buried cultural
deposits on the site.

Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41BR590 consist entirely of aboriginal lithic
specimens. The observed lithic assemblage includes 1 chert core and 1 tertiary flake that were
manufactured from light gray to dark grayish-brown, medium- to fine-grained chert (Figure 1622). Additionally, 3 burned sandstone fragments were observed between 19.7 and 23.6 inches
(50.0 and 60.0 cm) below ground surface in backhoe trench CRK W106-BT3 excavated on the
site (see Figure 16-22). These scattered, burned rock fragments did not appear to represent an
intact feature. Aside from the observed lithic specimens, no temporally diagnostic formal tools
or preserved floral or faunal remains were noted on the site.

Cultural Features
As noted above, 3 thermally altered rocks were observed in 1 of the backhoe trenches
excavated on site 41BR590. No carbonized remains or additional cultural materials were
observed in association with these burned rocks, and their scattered nature suggested that they
were not an intact feature. However, their presence on the site attests to some level of food
preparation via heated rocks during the occupation of the site, and the potential for deeply
buried intact cultural features elsewhere on the site cannot currently be ruled out.

Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of cultural materials in backhoe trench CRK W106-BT3, site
41BR590 measures approximately 100.0 feet (30.5 m) northwest to southeast along the length
of the proposed ROW by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) northeast to southwest. Site boundaries were
documented only within the then-proposed ROW, and undocumented portions of the site may
extend to the northeast and southwest beyond the documented site boundaries.
A total of 4 shovel tests were excavated in the vicinity of site 41BR590. The excavated
shovel tests revealed up to 19.7 inches (50.0 cm) of reddish-brown and strong brown fine sandy
loam deposits overlying dark reddish-brown sandy clay. No cultural materials were observed in
subsurface contexts within the excavated shovel tests.
As discussed in subsequent paragraphs, 2 backhoe trenches were excavated within the
proposed ROW along the west side of Paint Creek. Both trenches measured approximately
9.8 feet (3.0 m) in length, 2.0 feet (0.6 m) in width, and were excavated to a depth range of 5.2
to 5.9 feet (1.6 to 1.8 m). The cultural zone observed in backhoe trench CRK W106-BT2 ranges
from 11.8 to 35.4 inches (30.0 to 90.0 cm) below surface. Sterile, sandy loam was observed in
the level below the cultural zone. Distinct cultural zones were not clearly differentiated in
backhoe trench CRK W106-BT3. Photographs of the trenching efforts are presented in Figures
16-23 and 16-24, and profile drawings of the 2 backhoe trenches are presented in Figures 1625 and 16-26.

Summary
Site 41BR590 is a low-density aboriginal lithic scatter situated adjacent along the
western bank of Paint Creek. A total of 4 shovel tests and 2 backhoe trenches were excavated
to assess site the horizontal and vertical extent of deposits on 41BR590. No subsurface cultural
materials were observed in any of the 4 excavated shovel tests; however, cultural materials
were observed at depths of up to 35.4 inches (90 inches) below surface in 1 of the 2 excavated
backhoe trenches. No evidence of any temporally diagnostic artifacts, intact cultural features, or
preserved floral or faunal remains was encountered during the investigations on the site.
Although no evidence of preserved floral or faunal remains was encountered during the
investigations, the presence of thermally altered rocks observed in 1 backhoe trench excavated
on the site suggests that the potential exists for intact features to be present within unexcavated
portions of the site.
The site boundaries were delineated only within the proposed ROW, and the cultural
materials on site 41BR590 may extend northeast and southwest beyond the current
documented boundaries. As the full extent of site 41BR590 was not delineated, its NRHP
eligibility status is considered to be undetermined. However, based upon the vertical extent of
cultural deposits present within the portion of site 41BR590 that falls within the proposed ROW,
the potential exists for deeply buried cultural deposits within unexcavated portions of the site
within the proposed ROW. Additional testing of site 41BR590 within the proposed ROW could
identify additional dateable materials, further contributing to the overall research value of the
site. As such, it has yet to be determined if the deposits contained within the proposed ROW
are contributing elements to the site’s overall NRHP eligibility status. Horizon therefore
recommends the avoidance and protection of the portion of site 41BR590 within the proposed
ROW until the full extent of the cultural deposits can be further investigated to produce sufficient
information towards making a formal NRHP eligibility determination.
At this time, BridgeTex is proposing to span Paint Creek via a HDD. As a result, the
construction of the proposed pipeline does not require the usage of any federal permits and is
thereby not regulated by Section 106 of the NHPA. The length of the HDD will likely span the
buried component of site 41BR590, thus avoiding impacts to potentially significant cultural
deposits on the site.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Within Segment 1 of the proposed BridgeTex North Pipeline ROW, Horizon conducted
backhoe trenching efforts at 2 locations (CRK 101 and CRK 93) that were recommended for
further assessment following the original survey of the proposed ROW and at a rerouted
location of the proposed ROW across CRK W106. With a combined overall length of 1000.0
feet (304.8 m), a total of 3 backhoe trenches would have been necessary at these 3 locations in
order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 18
backhoe trenches within the 3 USACE jurisdictional areas (see Table 16-2).
The backhoe trenching efforts within the 3 USACE jurisdictional areas resulted in:
(1) negative results at USACE jurisdictional areas CRK 101 and CRK 93; (2) the revision of the

boundaries of site 41BR589 that was recorded by Horizon a short distance to the south during
the initial survey of proposed ROW across Paint Creek (USACE jurisdictional area CRK W106);
and (3) the documentation of a new archeological site (41BR590) on the opposing side of Paint
Creek at the rerouted location of the proposed ROW. For ease of review, Horizon’s findings
and recommendations for each USACE jurisdictional area within Segment 1 are presented in

17.0 ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATIONS—SEGMENT 2

17.1

SEGMENT 2 PROJECT BACKGROUND

Subsequent to the initial cultural resources survey of the USACE jurisdictional areas
within Segment 2 of the proposed BridgeTex North Pipeline ROW where access was available,
Horizon prepared a full report of the investigations and submitted it for agency review (see
Chapters 7.0 and 14.0 within the main body of this document). The THC concurred with
Horizon’s findings and recommendations pertaining to Segment 2 of the proposed BridgeTex
North Pipeline ROW in a letter dated 6 September 2013.
The initial cultural resources survey efforts within the USACE jurisdictional areas in
Segment 2 resulted in the identification of 5 USACE jurisdictional areas requiring mechanical
trenching to prospect for deeply buried cultural deposits beyond the reach of typical shovel
testing efforts. They also resulted in the identification of 4 USACE jurisdictional areas where
access was originally denied and a cultural resources survey was still potentially necessary for
compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA (see Table 14-2). These 5 USACE jurisdictional
areas requiring trenching efforts and 4 USACE jurisdictional areas requiring survey efforts are
summarized in Table 17-1.
Horizon completed the recommended additional investigations within Segment 2 at
various times during the latter half of 2013. The results of these additional investigations are
presented below. For consistency with the main body of this report, and to aid in an expeditious
review of the results by permitting agencies, the results for all additional investigations within the
assessed USACE jurisdictional areas where a NWP permit will be necessary for pipeline
construction are summarized in tabular format in Table 17-2. This table presents: (1) the name
and type of each assessed USACE jurisdictional area; (2) previously documented cultural
resources within 0.5 miles (0.8 km) of each location; (3) the number of shovel tests or backhoe
trenches excavated at each location; (4) a brief description and NRHP eligibility determination of
newly discovered archeological sites at each location, if any; (5) a brief description of the soils at
each location as they pertain to the potential for deeply buried cultural deposits; and finally (6)
Horizon’s recommendations pertaining to the need for avoidance measures or additional
investigations. The specifics pertaining to the investigations at each assessed USACE
jurisdictional area are presented below.

ADDITIONAL SURVEY EFFORTS

Within Segment 2 of the proposed BridgeTex North pipeline ROW, biologists under the
direction of Zephyr originally identified a total of 52 USACE jurisdictional areas where a NWP
will be necessary for the construction of the proposed pipeline. Of these, a total of 4 were not
accessible during the original survey efforts due to the lack of access to the property. These
include CRK U24 and POND X6 in Hamilton County, and CRK X17 and CRK CF-1 in Coryell
County (Figures 17-1 through 17-4). These 4 USACE jurisdictional areas have a combined
overall length of 800.0 feet (243.8 m). The TSMASS require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per
mile for linear projects measuring 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width. With this in mind, a total of 3
shovel tests would have been necessary within the 4 USACE jurisdictional areas in order to
comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 16 shovel
tests within the 4 remaining unsurveyed USACE jurisdictional areas within Segment 2 of the
proposed ROW (see Figures 17-1 through 17-4).
The cultural resources survey of the 4 remaining USACE jurisdictional areas in Segment
2 resulted in entirely negative findings. No cultural materials were observed on the surface of
these 4 USACE jurisdictional areas, and no cultural materials were observed in any of the 10
excavated shovel tests (see Table 17-2).

17.3

BACKHOE TRENCHING INVESTIGATIONS

The initial cultural resources survey efforts within the USACE jurisdictional areas in
Segment 2 resulted in the identification of 5 locations requiring mechanical trenching to prospect
for deeply buried cultural deposits beyond the reach of typical shovel testing efforts (see Tables
17-1 and 17-2). These 5 USACE jurisdictional areas (CRK K5, CRK L15, CRK X4, CRK H8,
and CRK H5) have a combined overall length of 1000.0 feet (304.8 m). The TSMASS require a

width. With this in mind, a total of 3 trenches would have been necessary within the 5 USACE
jurisdictional areas in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by
excavating a total of 18 backhoe trenches within the 5 USACE jurisdictional areas requiring
mechanical trenching within Segment 2 of the proposed ROW (see Table 17-2). The results of
the trenching efforts at each USACE jurisdictional area are discussed separately below.

RESULTS

17.4.1 CRK K5
A Horizon archeological field crew excavated a total of 4 backhoe trenches within
USACE jurisdictional area CRK K5 (Rabbit Creek). This included 2 trenches on each side of
the creek channel (Figure 17-5). On average, the trenches measured 10.1 feet (3.1 m) in length
by 2.0 feet (0.6 m) in width. They were to be excavated a depth of 6.0 feet (1.8 m) or down to
sterile, pre-Holocene clay soils, whichever was encountered first. On average, the trenches at
this crossing were excavated to a depth of 6.6 feet (2.0 m). A photograph of a typical trench
profile at CRK K5 is presented in Figure 17-6, while a sketch of a typical trench profile is
presented in Figure 17-7.
The backhoe trenching efforts at USACE jurisdictional area CRK K5 produced entirely
negative results. No cultural materials were observed on the surface at this location, within any
of the excavated matrices, or within the resulting trench profiles.
17.4.2 CRK L15
A Horizon archeological field crew excavated a total of 3 backhoe trenches within
USACE jurisdictional area CRK L15 (tributary of South Leon River). This included 2 trenches
on the northwest side of the tributary channel and 1 trench on the southeast side of the tributary
channel (Figure 17-8). On average, the trenches measured 9.8 feet (3.0 m) in length by 2.0 feet
(0.6 m) in width. They were excavated to a depth of 6.0 feet (1.8 m) or down to sterile, preHolocene clay soils, whichever was encountered first. On average, the trenches at this crossing
were excavated to a depth of 3.9 feet (1.2 m). A photograph of a typical trench profile at CRK
L15 is presented in Figure 17-9, while a sketch of a typical trench profile is presented in Figure
17-10.
The backhoe trenching efforts at USACE jurisdictional area CRK L15 resulted in the
documentation of a newly recorded prehistoric site, 41CJ111.
Site 41CJ111

General Description
Site 41CJ111 was documented as an extensive prehistoric occupation located 0.8 miles
(1.3 km) to the northeast of the intersection of County Road (CR) 248 and CR 252A near
Gustine in Comanche County, Texas. This extensive site extends along the length of the
proposed ROW across a prominent landform between the South Leon River and one of its

unnamed tributaries at an elevation of 1200.0 feet (365.9 m) amsl (Figures 17-11 and 17-12).
The vegetation on the site consists of cacti, mesquite trees, various weedy plants, yucca, and
short wild grasses with scattered Ashe juniper and oak trees near the river banks that border the
edges of an existing pipeline ROW that already traverses the site (Figure 17-13). As
documented during the current survey, site 41CJ111 measures 2361.6 feet (720.0 m) in length
by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width within the proposed ROW. The site boundaries were
documented only within the proposed ROW.
During the initial survey efforts along the proposed ROW, Horizon excavated 2 shovel
tests on each bank of this USACE jurisdictional crossing, both of which produced negative
results. Based upon the USDA NCRS web soil survey, Horizon determined that deep alluvial
soils were potentially present at this location, resulting in the increased potential for deeply
buried cultural deposits. Site 41CJ111 was actually recorded during the backhoe trenching and
subsequent shovel testing efforts within USACE jurisdictional area CRK L15. Horizon
excavated 2 backhoe trenches (CRK L15-BT1 and CRK L15-BT2) and 8 additional shovel tests
on site 41CJ111 to assess the horizontal and vertical extent of the site and the potential for
deeply buried cultural deposits.

Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41CJ111 consist entirely of aboriginal lithic
specimens. The observed lithic assemblage includes approximately 50 primary, secondary, and
tertiary flakes; 5 to 10 chert core fragments; and 2 biface fragments (Figure 17-14). A slender
point with beveled edges and an expanding stem reminiscent of the Darl point style was also
observed on the site (Turner and Hester 1999; see upper left in Figure 17-14). All of the
materials observed on 41CJ111 were manufactured from light gray to dark grayish-brown,
medium- to fine-grained chert. The presence of a possible Darl point on the surface of site
41CJ111 suggests a possible Transitional Archaic period (ca. 300 B.C to A.D 700) occupation
of the site. Additionally, a small concentration of thermally altered rocks (that may represent a
hearth feature) was observed on the modern ground surface of the site. A discussion of this
possible hearth feature is addressed in the following section. No preserved floral or faunal
remains were observed during shovel testing or backhoe trenching efforts on site 41CJ111.

Cultural Features
As noted above, a concentration of thermally altered rocks was observed on the modern
ground surface near the central portion of the site. The burned rock concentration had a circular
configuration measuring approximately 1.6 feet (0.5 m) in diameter. Several flakes were
scattered along the surface in the vicinity of the rock concentration. Although, no carbonized
remains were observed in association with this burned rock concentration and the concentration
appears highly disturbed, it is possible that the concentration may represent the remnants of a
scattered hearth feature. No additional cultural features were observed on the modern ground
surface on site 41CJ111, and no additional evidence of subsurface cultural features was noted
within any of the 10 shovel tests or 2 backhoe trenches excavated on the site.

Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of cultural materials in shovel tests and backhoe trenches and
along the modern ground surface, site 41CJ111 measures approximately 2361.6 feet (720.0 m)
northwest to southeast along the length of the proposed ROW by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) northeast
to southwest. Site boundaries were documented only within the proposed ROW, and
undocumented portions of the site may extend to the northeast and southwest beyond the
documented site boundaries.
A total of 10 shovel tests excavated on site 41CJ111 revealed 17.8 to 39.3 inches
(35.0 to 100.0 cm) of pale brown to dark yellowish-brown sandy loam deposits overlying very
dark brown gravelly clay. Cultural materials were observed between 11.8 and 23.6 inches
(30.0 and 60.0 cm) of sediments in 3 of the 10 shovel tests excavated on the site. Additionally,
cultural materials were also observed along the modern ground surface near the central portion
of the site.
As will be discussed in subsequent sections below, 2 backhoe trenches were excavated
within the proposed ROW along the west side of USACE jurisdictional crossing CRK L15-1.
Both trenches measured approximately 9.8 feet (3.0 m) in length, 2.0 feet (0.6 m) in width, and
were excavated to a maximum depth of 3.9 feet (1.1 m) below ground surface. The cultural
zone observed in the 2 backhoe trenches ranged between 0.0 and 35.4 inches (0.0 and 90.0
cm) below surface. Sterile, weathered bedrock was observed in the level below the cultural
zone. Distinct cultural zones were not clearly differentiated in either backhoe trench or within
the 3 positive shovel tests excavated on the site. Photographs of the trenching efforts are
presented in Figures 17-15 through 17-18, and profile drawings of the 2 backhoe trenches are
presented in Figures 17-19 and 17-20.

Summary
Site 41CJ111 is an aboriginal open campsite situated on an upland landform bounded
by the South Leon River and one of its unnamed tributaries. A total of 10 shovel tests and 2
backhoe trenches were excavated on site 41CJ111. Cultural materials were observed between
11.8 and 35.4 inches (30.0 and 90.0 cm) within the sediments in 3 of the 10 shovel tests and 2
backhoe trenches excavated on the site. Cultural materials, including a small concentration of
thermally altered rocks that may represent the remnants of a hearth, were also observed on the
modern ground surface near the central portion of the site. Additionally, a possible Darl point
was observed on the surface of the site, suggesting a possible Transitional Archaic component
on the site. The possible Darl point was observed in surface contexts on the site, and no clearly
differentiated cultural zones were observed in either backhoe trench or any of the excavated
shovel tests. Although no evidence of preserved floral or faunal remains was encountered
during the investigations, the burned rock feature observed on the modern ground surface
suggests that the potential exists for intact features present in unexcavated portions of the site.

Addendum 2
Chapter 17.0: Additional Investigations—Segment 2

The boundaries of site 41CJ111 were delineated only within the proposed ROW, and the
cultural materials on the site may extend northeast and southwest of the boundaries of the
proposed ROW. As the full extent of site 41CJ111 was not assessed, its NRHP eligibility status
is considered to be undetermined. However, based the presence of deeply buried cultural
deposits within the portion of site 41CJ111 within the proposed ROW, the potential exists for
intact cultural features and temporally diagnostic materials within unassessed portions of the
site within the proposed ROW. Additional testing of site 41CJ111 within the proposed ROW is
necessary to assess the overall research value of the site. As such, it has yet to be determined
if the deposits contained within the proposed ROW are contributing elements to the site’s overall
NRHP eligibility status. Horizon therefore recommends the avoidance and protection of the
portion of site 41CJ111 within the proposed ROW until the full extent of the cultural deposits can
be further investigated to produce sufficient information toward making a formal NRHP eligibility
determination.
At this time, BridgeTex is proposing to span both the South Leon River and its unnamed
tributary (USACE jurisdictional area CRK L15) via a HDD. As a result, the construction of the
proposed pipeline across these USACE jurisdictional areas does not require the usage of any
federal permits and is thereby also not regulated by Section 106 of the NHPA. The length of the
HDD will likely span the buried component of site 41CJ111, thus avoiding impacts to potentially
significant cultural deposits on the site.
17.4.3 CRK X4
A Horizon archeological field crew excavated a total of 4 backhoe trenches within
USACE jurisdictional area CRK X4 (Warren Creek). This included 2 trenches on each side of
the creek channel (Figure 17-21). On average, the trenches measured 10.1 feet (3.1 m) in
length by 2.0 feet (0.6 m) in width. They were excavated to a depth of 6.0 feet (1.8 m) or down
to sterile, pre-Holocene clay soils, whichever was encountered first. On average, the trenches
at this crossing were excavated to a depth of 3.6 feet (1.1 m). A photograph of a typical trench
profile at CRK X4 is presented in Figure 17-22, while a sketch of a typical trench profile is
presented in Figure 17-23.
The backhoe trenching efforts at USACE jurisdictional area CRK X4 produced entirely
negative results. No cultural materials were observed on the surface at this location, within any
of the excavated matrices, or within the resulting trench profiles.
17.4.4 CRK H8
A Horizon archeological field crew excavated a total of 3 backhoe trenches within
USACE jurisdictional area CRK H8 (Big Elm Creek). This included 2 trenches on the west side
of the creek channel and 1 on the east side (Figure 17-24). On average, the trenches
measured 9.8 feet (3.0 m) in length by 2.0 feet (0.6 m) in width. They were excavated to a
depth of 6.0 feet (1.8 m) or down to sterile, pre-Holocene clay soils, whichever was encountered
first. On average, the trenches at this crossing were excavated to a depth of 6.6 feet (1.4 m). A
photograph of a typical trench profile at CRK H5 is presented in Figure 17-25, while a sketch of
a typical trench profile is presented in Figure 17-26.

The backhoe trenching efforts at USACE jurisdictional area CRK H8 resulted in the
documentation of 2 newly recorded prehistoric sites, 41CV1667 and 41CV1668. Each of these
sites is discussed separately below.
Site 41CV1667

General Description
Site 41CV1667 represents the remains of a low-density aboriginal lithic scatter located
0.3 miles (0.5 km) to the north of the intersection of CR 267 and CR 268 near Oglesby in Coryell
County, Texas. The site is situated to the northwest of Clear Branch (USACE jurisdictional
crossing CRK H8) at an elevation of 750.0 feet (288.7 m) amsl (Figures 17-27 and 17-28). An
existing pipeline ROW is located immediately south of the site (see Figure 17-28). The
vegetation in the surrounding area consists of cacti, various weedy plants, and short wild
grasses with scattered Ashe juniper and oak trees closer to the creek (Figure 7-29). As
documented during the current survey, site 41CV1667 measures 150.0 feet (492.0 m) in length
by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width within the proposed ROW. The site boundaries were
documented only within the proposed ROW.
During the original survey of the proposed ROW, Horizon excavated 2 shovel tests on
either bank of Clear Branch, all of which produced negative results. However, based upon the
NCRS web soil survey and shovel testing efforts, Horizon determined that alluvial soils were
present along the banks of Clear Branch with an increased potential for deeply buried cultural
deposits. Site 41CV1667 was recorded during backhoe trenching and subsequent shovel
testing efforts during the additional assessment of USACE jurisdictional area CRK H8 (Clear
Branch). Horizon excavated 2 backhoe trenches and 8 additional shovel tests on site
41CV1667 to prospect for deeply buried cultural deposits and assess the horizontal and vertical
extents of the site.

Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41CV1667 consist entirely of aboriginal lithic
specimens. The observed lithic assemblage includes approximately 20 to 30 primary,
secondary and tertiary flakes; 5 chert core fragments; and 10 pieces of angular debris
(Figure 17-30). All of the materials observed on 41CV1667 were manufactured from light gray
to dark grayish-brown, medium- to fine-grained chert. Aside from the observed lithic specimens,
no temporally diagnostic formal tools, preserved floral or faunal remains, or thermally altered
rocks were noted on the site.

Cultural Features
No cultural features were observed on the modern ground surface on the site, and no
evidence of subsurface cultural features was noted within any of the 8 shovel tests or 2 backhoe
trenches excavated on the site.

Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of cultural materials in shovel tests, backhoe trenches, and on
the modern ground surface, site 41CV1667 measures approximately 150.0 feet (492.0 m)
northwest to southeast along the length of the proposed ROW by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) northeast
to southwest. Site boundaries were documented only within the proposed ROW, and
undocumented portions of the site may extend to the northeast and southwest beyond the
documented site boundaries.
A total of 8 shovel tests excavated on site 41CV1667 revealed up to 17.7 inches
(45.0 cm) of very dark brown clay loam and gravelly clay loam deposits overlying weathered
bedrock. Cultural materials were observed between 3.9 and 15.7 inches (10.0 and 40.0 cm) of
sediments in 2 of the 8 shovel tests excavated on the site. Additionally, cultural materials were
also observed along the modern ground surface near the western portion of the site.
In addition to shovel testing, 2 backhoe trenches were excavated within the proposed
ROW along the west side of Clear Branch. Both trenches measured approximately 9.8 feet
(3.0 m) in length, 2.0 feet (0.6 m) in width, and were excavated to a depth of 19.7 inches
(50.0 cm) below ground surface. The cultural zone observed in the 2 backhoe trenches ranges
from 3.9 to 13.7 inches (10.0 to 35.0 cm) below surface. Sterile, weathered bedrock was
observed in the level below the cultural zone. Photographs of the trenching efforts are
presented in Figures 17-31 to 17-34, and profile drawings of the 2 backhoe trenches are
presented in Figures 17-35 and 17-36.

Summary
Site 41CV1667 was documented a low-density aboriginal lithic scatter situated on the
northwest bank of Clear Branch. A total of 8 shovel tests and 2 backhoe trenches were
excavated on site 41CV1667, revealing the presence of subsurface lithic debris between
3.9 and 15.7 inches (10.0 and 40.0 cm) below surface. No evidence of any cultural features,
temporally diagnostic stone tools, or preserved floral or faunal remains was encountered during
the assessment of the site. The site boundaries were delineated only within the proposed
ROW, and the cultural materials on site 41CV1667 may extend northeast and southwest of the
boundaries of the proposed ROW. As the full extent of site 41CV1667 was not assessed, its
NRHP eligibility status is considered to be undetermined. However, the deposits within the
proposed ROW consist of only a low-density scatter of lithic specimens. Based upon the lack of
temporally diagnostic stone tools, any preserved floral or faunal remains, or stratified, buried
cultural deposits, it is Horizon’s opinion that the portion of site 41CV1667 within the proposed
ROW is considered to be a non-contributing element to the site’s overall NRHP eligibility status.
With this in mind, no additional investigations are recommended within the portion of the site
within the currently proposed ROW.

General Description
Site 41CV1668 represents the remains of a moderate-density aboriginal lithic scatter
located 0.3 miles (0.5 km) to the north of the intersection of CR 267 and CR 268 near Oglesby
in Coryell County, Texas. The site is situated to the southeast of Clear Branch (USACE
jurisdictional crossing CRK H8) at an elevation of 750.0 feet (288.7 m) amsl (see Figures 17-27
and 17-28). The vegetation in the surrounding area consists of cacti, various weedy plants, and
short, wild grasses with scattered Ashe juniper and oak trees closer to the creek (Figures 17-37
and 17-38). As documented during the current survey, site 41CV1668 measures 1064.0 feet
(325.0 m) in length by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width within the proposed ROW. The site
boundaries were documented only within the proposed ROW.

Addendum 2
Chapter 17.0: Additional Investigations—Segment 2

During the original survey of the proposed ROW, Horizon excavated 2 shovel tests on
the eastern bank of Clear Branch, both of which produced negative results. Based upon the
USDA NCRS web soil survey, Horizon determined that alluvial soils were potentially present
along the eastern bank of Clear Branch, thereby resulting in an increased potential for deeply
buried cultural deposits at this location. Site 41CV1668 was recorded during backhoe trenching
and subsequent shovel testing efforts during the assessment of USACE jurisdictional area CRK
H8 for buried cultural deposits. Horizon excavated 1 backhoe trench (CRK H8-BT3) and
6 additional shovel tests on site 41CV1668 to prospect for deeply buried cultural deposits and
assess the horizontal and vertical extents of the site.

Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41CV1668 consist entirely of aboriginal lithic
specimens. The observed lithic assemblage includes approximately 20 to 40 primary,
secondary, and tertiary flakes; 5 chert core fragments; 15 pieces of angular debris; and 1 biface
fragment that may represent a projectile point fragment (Figures 17-39 through 17-41). All of
the materials observed on 41CV1668 were manufactured from light gray to dark grayish-brown,
medium- to fine-grained chert. Several thermally altered rocks were observed scattered on the
surface of site 41CV1668. Aside from the observed lithic specimens, no temporally diagnostic
formal tools or preserved floral or faunal remains were noted on the site.

Cultural Features
While several thermally altered rocks were observed on the surface of site 41CV1668,
no evidence of any intact cultural features was observed on the modern ground surface on the
site or within any of the 8 shovel tests or 1 backhoe trench excavated on the site.

Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of cultural materials on the modern ground surface, as well as
in shovel tests and the backhoe trench, site 41CV1688 measures approximately 1064.0 feet
(325.0 m) northwest to southeast along the length of the proposed ROW by 100.0 feet (30.5 m)
northeast to southwest. Site boundaries were documented only within the proposed ROW, and
undocumented portions of the site may extend to the northeast and southwest beyond the
documented site boundaries.
A total of 8 shovel tests excavated on site 41CV1668 revealed up to 11.8 inches
(30.0 cm) of very dark brown clay loam and gravelly clay loam deposits overlying weathered
bedrock. Cultural materials were observed in 7.9 inches (20.0 cm) of sediments in 2 of the
8 shovel tests excavated on the site. Additionally, cultural materials were also observed on the
modern ground surface primarily in the eastern portion of the site.
In addition to shovel testing efforts, 1 backhoe trench was excavated within the proposed
ROW along the southeast side of Clear Branch. This trench measured approximately 9.8 feet
(3.0 m) in length, 2.0 feet (0.6 m) in width, and was excavated to a maximum depth of 4.9 feet
(1.5 m) below ground surface. Two distinct cultural zones appear to be present in the backhoe
trench excavated on site 41CV1668. The first cultural zone was observed between 13.8 and

the trenching efforts are presented in Figures 17-42 and 17-43, and a profile drawing of the
1 backhoe trench is presented in Figure 17-44.

Summary
Site 41CV1668 was documented as a moderate-density aboriginal lithic scatter situated
on the southeast bank of Clear Branch. A total of 8 shovel tests and 1 backhoe trench were
excavated on site 41CV1668. Cultural materials were observed at depths down to 4.9 feet
(1.5 m) below surface in 2 of the 8 shovel tests and 1 backhoe trench excavated on the site.
While only lithic debitage was encountered within the excavated backhoe trench, the presence
of thermally altered rock and an unidentified projectile point fragment on the surface of the site
suggest that the potential exists for undocumented cultural features and temporally diagnostic
materials on the site.
The site boundaries were delineated only within the proposed ROW, and the cultural
materials on site 41CV1668 may extend northeast and southwest of the boundaries of the
proposed ROW. As the full extent of site 41CV1668 was not delineated, its NRHP eligibility
status is considered to be undetermined. However, based on the presence of deeply buried
cultural deposits within the portion of site 41CV1668 that falls within the proposed ROW, the

potential exists for buried, in situ features, temporally diagnostic stone tools, and preserved
floral or faunal materials within unexcavated portions of the site within the proposed ROW.
Additional testing of site 41CV1668 within the proposed ROW is necessary to assess the overall
research value of the site. As such, it has yet to be determined if the deposits contained within
the proposed ROW are contributing elements to the site’s overall NRHP eligibility status.
Horizon therefore recommends the avoidance and protection of the portion of site 41CV1668
within the proposed ROW until the full extent of the cultural deposits can be further investigated
to produce sufficient information toward making a formal NRHP eligibility determination.
At this time, BridgeTex is proposing to span Clear Branch via a HDD. As a result, the
construction of the proposed pipeline does not require the usage of any federal permits and is
thereby also not regulated by Section 106 of the NHPA. The length of the HDD will likely span
the deeply buried component of site 41V1668, thereby avoiding impacts to potentially significant
cultural deposits on the site.
17.4.5 CRK H5
A Horizon archeological field crew excavated a total of 4 backhoe trenches within
USACE jurisdictional area CRK H5 (Big Elm Creek). This included 2 trenches on each side of
the creek channel (Figure 17-45). On average, the trenches measured 9.8 feet (3.0 m) in length
by 2.0 feet (0.6 m) in width. They were excavated to a depth of 6.0 feet (1.8 m) or down to
sterile, pre-Holocene clay soils, whichever was encountered first. On average, the trenches at
this crossing were excavated to a depth of 6.6 feet (1.4 m). A photograph of a typical trench

The backhoe trenching efforts at USACE jurisdictional area CRK H5 produced entirely
negative results. No cultural materials were observed on the surface at this location, within any
of the excavated matrices, or within the resulting trench profiles.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Within Segment 2 of the proposed BridgeTex North Pipeline ROW, Horizon conducted
survey efforts at 4 USACE jurisdictional areas where access was originally unavailable and
backhoe trenching efforts at 5 USACE jurisdictional areas that were recommended for further
assessment following the original survey of the proposed ROW (see Table 17-1). With a
combined overall length of 1800.0 feet (548.6 m), a total of 6 shovel tests and/or backhoe
trenches would have been necessary at these 9 locations in order to comply with the TSMASS.
Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 38 shovel tests and 18 backhoe
trenches within the 9 USACE jurisdictional areas (see Table 17-2).
The backhoe trenching efforts within the 9 USACE jurisdictional areas resulted in:
(1) negative results within USACE jurisdictional areas CRK K5, CRK X4, CRK U24, POND X6,
CRK X17, CRK CF-1, and CRK H5; (2) the documentation of a new archeological site
(41CJ111) at USACE jurisdictional area CRK L15; and (3) the documentation of 2 new
archeological sites (41CV1667 and 41CV1668) on opposing sides of USACE jurisdictional area
CRK H8. For ease of review, Horizon’s findings and recommendations for each USACE
jurisdictional area within Segment 2 are presented in Table 17-3.

18.1

SEGMENT 3 PROJECT BACKGROUND

Subsequent to the initial cultural resources survey of the USACE jurisdictional areas
within Segment 3 of the proposed BridgeTex North pipeline ROW where access was available,
Horizon prepared a full report of the investigations and submitted it for agency review (see
Chapters 8.0 and 14.0 within the main body of this document). The THC concurred with
Horizon’s findings and recommendations pertaining to Segment 3 of the proposed BridgeTex
North pipeline ROW in a letter dated 6 September 2013.
The initial cultural resources survey efforts within the USACE jurisdictional areas in
Segment 3 resulted in the identification of 14 USACE jurisdictional areas requiring mechanical
trenching to prospect for deeply buried cultural deposits beyond the reach of typical shovel
testing efforts. They also resulted in the identification of 8 USACE jurisdictional areas that were
not assessed during the initial survey efforts and where a cultural resources survey was still
potentially necessary for compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA (see Table 14-3). These 14
USACE jurisdictional areas requiring trenching efforts and 8 USACE jurisdictional areas
requiring survey efforts are summarized in Table 18-1.
With the exception of several USACE jurisdictional areas where construction methods
were revised to avoid federal permitting, Horizon completed the recommended additional
investigations within Segment 3 at various times during the latter half of 2013. The results of
these additional investigations are presented below. For consistency with the main body of this
report, and to aid in an expeditious review of the results by permitting agencies, the results of all
additional investigations within the assessed USACE jurisdictional areas where a NWP permit
will be necessary for pipeline construction are summarized in tabular format in Table 18-2. This
table presents: (1) the name and type of each assessed USACE jurisdictional area;
(2) previously documented cultural resources within 0.5 miles (0.8 km) of each location; (3) the
number of shovel tests or backhoe trenches excavated at each location; (4) a brief description
and NRHP eligibility determination of newly discovered archeological sites at each location, if
any; (5) a brief description of the soils at each location as they pertain to the potential for deeply
buried cultural deposits; and finally (6) Horizon’s recommendations pertaining to the need for
avoidance measures or additional investigations. The specifics pertaining to the investigations
at each assessed USACE jurisdictional area are presented below.

18.2

CROSSINGS WITH REVISED CONSTRUCTION METHODS

Following the completion of the original survey efforts, report production, and agency
consultation for the proposed ROW, BridgeTex revised their proposed construction methods at
7 USACE jurisdictional crossings within Segment 3. Specifically, original construction methods
at CRK U16, CRK G23, CRK G27, CRK G28, CRK G29, CRK F18 (west), and CRK F18 (east)
included the use of open-cut trenches for pipeline installation. As a result, impacts to these 7
USACE jurisdictional areas would require the use of NWPs, which would thereby require
compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA. Due to a variety of issues, including access/timing,
the presence of other environmental constraints (e.g., endangered species), and/or the
presence of documented cultural resources with undetermined NRHP eligibility statuses at
these 7 crossings, BridgeTex revised the proposed open-cut construction method to that of an
HDD at the 7 crossings. By doing so, construction efforts at these locations would avoid
impacts to the USACE jurisdictional areas, endangered species habitat, and/or documented
cultural resources. Moreover, they would also avoid the need for the utilization of NWPs issued
by the USACE at these locations, which in turn avoided the need to comply with the regulations
of Section 106 of the NHPA. Because of this, no additional trenching efforts were conducted at
these 7 USACE jurisdictional areas. The revised construction methods at these 7 crossings are
reflected in Table 18-2.
The revised construction methods serve to avoid any potential adverse effects to
documented and potentially undocumented cultural resources at these 7 crossings via HDDs.
However, should construction methods revert back to open-cut trenches and NWPs issued by
the USACE are necessary for construction, Horizon’s original recommendations for backhoe
trenching efforts at these 7 crossings remain in effect.

18.3

ADDITIONAL SURVEY EFFORTS

Within Segment 3 of the proposed BridgeTex North pipeline ROW, biologists under the
direction of Zephyr originally identified a total of 80 USACE jurisdictional areas where a NWP
will be necessary for the construction of the proposed pipeline. Of these, a total of 8 were not
assessed during initial survey efforts due to various reasons, such as the lack of access to the
properties. These include CRK B8, CRK B9_WEST, and CRK G2 in Milam County; WET U2
and U3 in Robertson County; and CRK U27, CRK Z4, and WET F3 in Brazos County (Figures
18-1 through 18-8). These 8 USACE jurisdictional areas have a combined overall length of
1600.0 feet (487.7 m). The TSMASS require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear
projects measuring 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width. With this in mind, a total of 4 to 5 shovel tests
would have been necessary within the 8 USACE jurisdictional areas in order to comply with the
TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 36 shovel tests within the
8 remaining unsurveyed USACE jurisdictional areas within Segment 3 of the proposed ROW
(see Figures 18-1 through 18-8). The cultural resources survey of the 8 remaining USACE
jurisdictional areas in Segment 3 resulted in entirely negative findings. No cultural materials
were observed on the surface of these 8 USACE jurisdictional areas, and no cultural materials
were observed in any of the 36 excavated shovel tests (see Table 18-2).

BACKHOE TRENCHING INVESTIGATIONS

Following the initial cultural resources survey efforts within the USACE jurisdictional
areas in Segment 3 and BridgeTex’s subsequent revisions to proposed construction methods,
Horizon identified a total of 7 USACE jurisdictional areas where mechanical trenching was
necessary to prospect for deeply buried cultural deposits beyond the reach of typical shovel
testing efforts (see Tables 18-1 and 18-2). These 7 USACE jurisdictional areas (CRK G6, CRK
G5, CRK C1_EAST, CRK C12, CRK11, CRK 10, and CRK 9) have a combined overall length of
1400.0 feet (426.7 m). The TSMASS require a minimum of 16 backhoe trenches per mile for
linear projects measuring 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width. With this in mind, a total of 4 to
5 trenches would have been necessary within the 7 USACE jurisdictional areas in order to
comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 14 backhoe
trenches within the 7 USACE jurisdictional areas requiring mechanical trenching within
Segment 3 of the proposed ROW (see Table 18-2). The results of the trenching efforts at each
USACE jurisdictional area are discussed separately below.

18.5

RESULTS

18.5.1 CRK G6 and CRK G5
A Horizon archeological field crew excavated a total of 4 backhoe trenches and 2 shovel
tests within USACE jurisdictional areas CRK G6 (tributary of Hog Creek) and CRK G5 (Pond
Creek). This included 2 trenches on the northwest side of CRK G6, 2 trenches between CRK
G6 and CRK G5, and 2 shovel tests southeast of CRK G5 (Figure 18-9). Shovel tests were
excavated on the southeast side of CRK G5 due to the lack of access for the backhoe and due
to the presence of only dense clay soils at the location. On average, the trenches within these
jurisdictional areas measured 6.9 feet (2.1 m) in length by 2.0 feet (0.6 m) in width. They were
to be excavated to a depth of 6.0 feet (1.8 m) or down to sterile, pre-Holocene clay soils,
whichever was encountered first. On average, the trenches at these crossings were excavated
to a depth of 2.9 feet (0.9 m). A photograph of a typical trench profile at this location is
presented in Figure 18-10, while a sketch of a typical trench profile is presented in Figure 18-11.
The backhoe trenching and shovel testing efforts at USACE jurisdictional area CRK G6
and CRK G5 produced entirely negative results. No cultural materials were observed on the
surface at these locations, within any of the excavated matrices, within the resulting trench
profiles, or within the excavated shovel tests.
18.5.2 CRK C1_EAST
USACE jurisdictional area CRK C1_EAST is the Brazos River. It is also the boundary
between Segments 2 and 3 of the proposed ROW. Although this USACE jurisdictional area will
be spanned via a HDD, the Brazos River is considered to be a Section 10 waterway. As a
result, construction efforts at this location will require the usage of a NWP. A Horizon
archeological field crew excavated a total of 2 backhoe trenches on the east side of USACE
jurisdictional area CRK C1_EAST. The 2 trenches were placed within the proposed HDD bore
entry/exit pad on the east side of this crossing (Figure 18-12). The west side of this crossing is

located in Segment 2 of the proposed ROW and was adequately assessed during the initial
survey efforts (see Chapters 7.0 and 14.0 in the main body of this document).
On average, the trenches excavated within the proposed HDD bore entry/exit pad at
CRK C1_EAST measured 10.8 feet (3.3 m) in length by 2.0 feet (0.6 m) in width. They were to
be excavated to a depth of 6.0 feet (1.8 m) or down to sterile, pre-Holocene clay soils,
whichever was encountered first. On average, the trenches at this crossing were excavated to
a depth of 7.2 feet (2.2 m). A photograph of a typical trench profile at CRK C1_EAST is
presented in Figure 18-13, while a sketch of a typical trench profile is presented in Figure 18-14.
The backhoe trenching efforts at USACE jurisdictional area CRK C1_EAST resulted in
entirely negative findings. No cultural materials were observed on the surface of this location,
within any of the excavated matrices, or within the resulting trench profiles.
As can be seen in Figure 18-12, site 41RT572 is located on the east bank of CRK
C1_EAST. This site consists of a shallow, subsurface, historic-era trash scatter that was
documented during the initial survey efforts along the proposed ROW at this crossing. As the
deposits appear to represent a turn-of-the-20th-century dump, the portion of the site within the
currently proposed ROW is considered to be a non-contributing element to the overall NRHP
eligibility status of the site. As such, no further investigations were recommended on this site
when it was originally documented. While site 41RT572 is not considered to be significant, the
proposed HDD at this location will effectively avoid any impacts to its deposits.
18.5.3

CRK C12, CRK C11, CRK C10, and CRK C9

CRK C12, CRK C11, CRK C10, and CRK C9 are 4 closely spaced channels of Mud
Creek and one of its unnamed tributaries (Figure 18-15). CRK C12 is the unnamed tributary
that may be relatively recent, as it does not show up on the 1962 USGS 7.5-minute Calvert,
Texas, topographic quadrangle map (see Figure 18-15). CRK C11 is the current channel of
Mud Creek, while CRK C10 and CRK C9 are small relict channels of Mud Creek situated due
southeast of the modern Mud Creek channel (see Figure 18-15). Due to the close proximity of
these 4 USACE jurisdictional areas, they are discussed together here.
A Horizon archeological field crew excavated a total of 8 backhoe trenches within
USACE jurisdictional areas CRK C12, CRK C11, CRK C10, and CRK C9. This included
2 trenches on the northwest side of CRK C12, 2 trenches between CRK C12 and CRK C11, and
4 trenches southeast of CRK C10 and C9 (see Figure 18-15). On average, the trenches within
these jurisdictional areas measured 9.2 feet (2.8 m) in length by 2.0 feet (0.6 m) in width. They
were to be excavated to a depth of 6.0 feet (1.8 m) or down to sterile, pre-Holocene clay soils,
whichever was encountered first. On average, the trenches at these crossings were excavated
to a depth of 4.9 feet (1.5 m). Photographs of typical trench profiles at these locations are
presented in Figures 18-16 and 18-17, while sketches of typical trench profiles are presented in
Figures 18-18 and 18-19.
The backhoe trenching efforts at USACE jurisdictional areas CRK C12, CRK C11, CRK
C10, and CRK C9 produced entirely negative results. No cultural materials were observed on

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Within Segment 3 of the proposed BridgeTex North pipeline ROW, Horizon conducted
survey efforts at 8 USACE jurisdictional areas where access was originally unavailable or where
reroutes to the original alignment had occurred, as well as backhoe trenching efforts at
7 USACE jurisdictional areas that were recommended for further assessment following the
original survey of the proposed ROW (see Table 18-1). With a combined overall length of
3000.0 feet (914.4 m), a total of 9 to 10 shovel tests and/or backhoe trenches would have been
necessary at these 15 locations in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the
TSMASS by excavating a total of 36 shovel tests and 14 backhoe trenches within the
15 USACE jurisdictional areas (see Table 18-2).
In addition to the 15 assessed USACE jurisdictional areas, Horizon had originally
recommended backhoe trenching efforts at an additional 7 USACE jurisdictional areas following
the original survey efforts (see Table 18-1). Subsequent to the publishing of these
recommendations in the original body of this report, BridgeTex altered the proposed
construction efforts at these 7 locations from open-cut trenches to HDDs due to a variety of
constraints. As a result, the HDD construction method no longer required the usage of NWPs
issued by the USACE. The lack of federal involvement also removed the necessity to comply
with Section 106 of the NHPA at these locations. As construction efforts at these 7 locations no
longer had an associated federal nexus, the additional recommended backhoe trenching efforts
were not conducted. However, the use of HDDs at these locations should minimize potential
adverse impacts to any undocumented cultural resources at these locations.
The survey and backhoe trenching efforts within the 15 assessed USACE jurisdictional
areas resulted in entirely negative results. No cultural deposits were observed on the surface of
these 15 USACE jurisdictional areas, and no subsurface cultural deposits were observed in any
of the 36 shovel tests and 14 backhoe trenches that were excavated at these locations. Sites
41RT572 and 41RT573 are located on the proposed ROW in the general vicinity of USACE
jurisdictional areas CRK C1_EAST and CRK U16. However, HDDs utilized at these locations
will serve to avoid impacts to both of these sites. For ease of overall review, Horizon’s findings
and recommendations for each USACE jurisdictional area within Segment 3 are presented in
Table 18-3.

19.1

SEGMENT 4 PROJECT BACKGROUND

Subsequent to the initial cultural resources survey of the USACE jurisdictional areas
within Segment 4 of the proposed BridgeTex North pipeline ROW where access was available,
Horizon prepared a full report of the investigations and submitted it for agency review (see
Chapters 9.0 and 14.0 within the main body of this document). The THC concurred with
Horizon’s findings and recommendations pertaining to Segment 4 of the proposed BridgeTex
North pipeline ROW in a letter dated 6 September 2013.
The initial cultural resources survey efforts within the USACE jurisdictional areas in
Segment 4 resulted in the identification of 4 USACE jurisdictional areas requiring mechanical
trenching to prospect for deeply buried cultural deposits beyond the reach of typical shovel
testing efforts. They also resulted in the identification of a property where access was originally
denied and a cultural survey was still potentially necessary for compliance with Section 106 of
the NHPA (see Table 14-4). These 4 USACE jurisdictional areas requiring trenching efforts and
1 USACE jurisdictional area requiring survey efforts are summarized in Table 19-1.

assessed USACE jurisdictional areas where a NWP permit will be necessary for pipeline
construction are summarized in tabular format in Table 19-2. This table presents (1) the name
and type of each assessed USACE jurisdictional area; (2) previously documented cultural
resources within 0.5 miles (0.8 km) of each location; (3) the number of shovel tests or backhoe
trenches excavated at each location; (4) a brief description and NRHP eligibility determination of
newly discovered archeological sites at each location, if any; (5) a brief description of the soils at
each location as they pertain to the potential for deeply buried cultural deposits; and finally (6)
Horizon’s recommendations pertaining to the need for avoidance measures or additional
investigations. The specifics pertaining to the investigations at each assessed USACE
jurisdictional area are presented below.

19.2

ADDITIONAL SURVEY EFFORTS

Within Segment 4 of the proposed BridgeTex North pipeline ROW, biologists under the
direction of Zephyr originally identified a total of 50 USACE jurisdictional areas where a NWP
will be necessary for the construction of the proposed pipeline. Of these, only 1 (CRK U25 in
Grimes County) was not accessible during the original survey efforts due to the lack of access
to the property. Once access was granted to the property, the biologists determined that a total
of 2 USACE jurisdictional areas were actually present on the property (CRK U25a and CRK
U25b; Figure 19-1). These 2 USACE jurisdictional areas have a combined overall length of
400.0 feet (121.9 m). The TSMASS require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear
projects measuring 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width. With this in mind, a total of 2 shovel tests
would have been necessary within the 2 USACE jurisdictional areas in order to comply with the
TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 10 shovel tests within the
2 remaining unsurveyed USACE jurisdictional areas within Segment 4 of the proposed ROW
(see Figure 19-1).
The cultural resources survey of the 2 remaining USACE jurisdictional areas in
Segment 4 resulted in entirely negative findings. No cultural materials were observed on the
surface of these 2 USACE jurisdictional areas, and no cultural materials were observed in any
of the 10 excavated shovel tests (see Table 19-2).

19.3

BACKHOE TRENCHING INVESTIGATIONS

The initial cultural resources survey efforts within the USACE jurisdictional areas in
Segment 4 resulted in the identification of 4 locations requiring mechanical trenching to prospect
for deeply buried cultural deposits beyond the reach of typical shovel testing efforts (see Tables
19-1 and 19-2). These 4 USACE jurisdictional areas (CRK X35, CRK W3, CRK W25, and CRK
W32) have a combined overall length of 800.0 feet (243.8 m). The TSMASS require a minimum
of 16 backhoe trenches per mile for linear projects measuring 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width. With
this in mind, a total of 3 trenches would have been necessary within the 4 USACE jurisdictional
areas in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a
total of 14 backhoe trenches within the 4 USACE jurisdictional areas requiring mechanical
trenching within Segment 4 of the proposed ROW (see Table 19-2). The results of the
trenching efforts at each USACE jurisdictional area are discussed separately below.

A Horizon archeological field crew excavated a total of 4 backhoe trenches within
USACE jurisdictional area CRK X35 (an unnamed tributary of the Navasota River). This
included 2 trenches on each side of the tributary (Figure 19-2). On average, the trenches
measured 9.2 feet (2.8 m) in length by 2.0 feet (0.6 m) in width. They were excavated down to
sterile, pre-Holocene clay soils that were encountered at approximately 1.6 feet (0.5 m) below
surface in each trench. A photograph of a typical trench profile at CRK X35 is presented in
Figure 19-3, while a sketch of a typical trench profile is presented in Figure 19-4.
The backhoe trenching efforts at USACE jurisdictional area CRK X35 produced entirely
negative results. No cultural materials were observed on the surface at this location, within any
of the excavated matrices, or within the resulting trench profiles. Moreover, no deep alluvial
soils were encountered at this location.
19.3.2 CRK W3
A Horizon archeological field crew excavated a total of 4 backhoe trenches within
USACE jurisdictional area CRK W3 (an unnamed tributary of Bull Creek). This included
2 trenches on each side of the tributary (Figure 19-5). On average, the trenches measured
11.5 feet (3.5 m) in length by 2.0 feet (0.6 m) in width. They were excavated down to sterile,
pre-Holocene clay soils that were encountered at approximately 1.6 feet (0.5 m) below surface
in each trench. A photograph of a typical trench profile at CRK W3 is presented in Figure 19-6,
while a sketch of a typical trench profile is presented in Figure 19-7.
The backhoe trenching efforts at USACE jurisdictional area CRK W3 produced entirely
negative results. No cultural materials were observed on the surface at this location, within any
of the excavated matrices, or within the resulting trench profiles. Moreover, no deep alluvial
soils were encountered at this location.
19.3.3 CRK W25
A Horizon archeological field crew excavated a total of 2 backhoe trenches within
USACE jurisdictional area CRK W25 (an unnamed tributary of Lake Creek). Both of the
trenches were excavated on the north side of the tributary (Figure 19-8). No trenches were
placed on the south side of the tributary due to the presence of dense clays at the surface
coupled with the absence of deep alluvial soils, as evidenced by the initial 2 backhoe trenches.
On average, the excavated trenches measured 11.5 feet (3.5 m) in length by 2.0 feet (0.6 m) in
width. They were excavated down to sterile, pre-Holocene clay soils that were encountered at
approximately 0.6 feet (0.2 m) below surface in each trench. A photograph of a typical trench
profile at CRK W25 is presented in Figure 19-9, while a sketch of a typical trench profile is
presented in Figure 19-10.
The backhoe trenching efforts at USACE jurisdictional area CRK W25 produced entirely
negative results. No cultural materials were observed on the surface at this location, within any
of the excavated matrices, or within the resulting trench profiles. Moreover, no deep alluvial
soils were encountered at this location.

19.3.4 CRK W32
A Horizon archeological field crew excavated a total of 4 backhoe trenches within
USACE jurisdictional area CRK W32 (Mill Creek). This included 2 trenches on each side of the
creek channel (Figure 19-11). On average, the trenches measured 9.5 feet (2.9 m) in length by
2.0 feet (0.6 m) in width. They were excavated down to approximately 6.6 feet (2.0 m) below
the depth of the impacts of the proposed pipeline trench. A photograph of a typical trench
profile at CRK W32 is presented in Figure 19-12, while a sketch of a typical trench profile is
presented in Figure 19-13.
The backhoe trenching efforts at USACE jurisdictional area CRK W32 produced entirely
negative results. No cultural materials were observed on the surface at this location, within any
of the excavated matrices, or within the resulting trench profiles.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on (1) the negative survey efforts on the 1 previously unsurveyed property in
Segment 4, and (2) the negative results of the backhoe trenching efforts in Segment 4, it is
Horizon’s opinion that the proposed Segment 4 pipeline construction efforts at these locations
(see Table 19-2) will pose no adverse effect to any significant cultural resources listed on or
considered eligible for listing on the NRHP. Horizon therefore recommends that BridgeTex be
allowed to proceed with the pipeline construction efforts at these locations relative to the
jurisdiction of the USACE and Section 106 of the NHPA.
