ABSTRACT
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) performed an archaeological survey
of an 80.75 acre detention facility in central Angelina County, Texas in June 2000 under
Texas Antiquities Committee permit number 2383. The project area was investigated
by shovel testing and probing. No archaeological sites were found within the
boundaries of the project area, and it is recommended that construction be allowed to
proceed as planned. Copies of the final report are on file at the Archeology Division,
Texas Historical Commission; Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL); the
City of Lufkin; and BVRA in Bryan, Texas.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Lufkin proposes to construct Hurricane Creek Detention Facility
Number 1 that will impound water in a natural basin fed by an unnamed tributary of
Hurricane Creek in central Angelina County, Texas (Figure 1). The 80.75 acre project
area is depicted on the topographic quadrangle, Lufkin (dated 1949 and photorevised in
1980) (Figure 2). It should be noted that this map is out of date as many current roads
and subdivisions are not depicted. Angelina County contains significant prehistoric and
historic sites. Therefore, an archaeological survey was recommended by the
Archeology Division, Texas Historical Commission. In order to comply with this request,
the City of Lufkin, through Klotz Associates, Inc., retained BVRA to conduct this service
which was performed under Texas Antiquities permit 2383. The duties of Principal
Investigator were performed by William E. Moore. The 80.75 acre project area is located
in an urban setting in the city limits of Lufkin. It is bounded on the north by Ford
Chappel Road and private land, on the south and east by private land, and on the west
by a subdivision. An unnamed tributary of Hurricane Creek bisects the main portion of
the project area.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The following general discussion of Angelina County was taken from the Soil
Survey of Angelina County (Dolezel (1988:1-4). Angelina County is located in the
central part of East Texas. The northern and southern parts of the county have a
dendritic drainage system with many large streams. Two rivers, Neches and Angelina,
drain the county. Elevation ranges from about 100 feet in the south near the Neches
River to about 460 feet in the northern part of the county. Angelina County is in the
East Texas Timberlands Land Resource Area and forest products are a major part of
the local economy. Soils in this area formed mainly under forest vegetation in a humid
environment, and most are light in color and low in natural fertility. Nearly level areas
are often wet, and moderately steep to steep areas tend to erode easily. Descriptions
of soils specific to the project area appear in the Results and Conclusions section of this
report. Angelina County has long, hot summers because of moist tropical air from the
Gulf of Mexico which persistently covers the area. Winters are cool and fairly short.
Rainfall is fairly heavy throughout the year, and prolonged droughts are rare. The total
annual precipitation is 41 inches. Of this, 21 inches (50%) usually falls in April through
September. In winter, the average temperature is 50 degrees Fahrenheit, and the
average daily minimum temperature is 39 degrees. In summer, the average
temperature is 82 degrees, and the average daily maximum temperature is 93 degrees.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to a recently published planning document for the Eastern Planning
Region of Texas (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.1.2), Angelina County is
situated within the Northeast Texas archeological study region. In 1985, according to a
statistical overview prepared by the Texas Historical Commission (Biesaart et al.
1985:107), Angelina County contained 52 recorded sites. The site files at TARL
revealed 172 recorded sites at the time of this survey. In 1985, 1 site in the county had
been excavated, 21 had been tested by hand, 1 had been tested by machine, 30 sites
had been dug by collectors, and 46 had been surface collected. Nine recorded
prehistoric sites in the county were listed as Archaic, and 41 sites were listed as Late
Prehistoric (Biesaart et al. 1985:108). Five sites contained burials.
In 1991, an evaluation was made of significant sites in the Northeast Texas
Archeological Region (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Table 2.1.1). At this time Angelina
County contained 121 recorded prehistoric sites; of this number 19 were listed as not
significant, 67 as unknown significance, 35 as probably significant, and 22 as
significant.
The archaeological significance of Angelina County is partially reflected in the
following statistics. In 1993, the county contained the second highest number of
important known hunter-gatherer sites in Northeast Texas (n=3) (Kenmotsu and Perttula
1993:Figure 2.3.3) and also contained at least 13 important Late Caddoan sites (n=13)
(Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 2.5.2). Unfortunately, there are major forces that
continue to threaten the integrity of archaeological sites in Angelina County. These
include population growth (City of Lufkin and surrounding area), highway construction,
surface lignite mining, Sam Rayburn Reservoir (formerly McGee Bend), and the
lumbering industry.
Although private contract archaeology firms have played a part, most of the
archaeological sites known to exist in Angelina County have been identified by surveys
associated with reservoir construction and in-house projects by National Forest
personnel. The earliest archaeological research in the area was performed in the late
1930s and early 1940s by researchers from The University of Texas at Austin. At that
time prehistoric cemeteries and mound sites were considered to be of primary
importance. From the late 1940s until the mid 1970s, most of the archaeological
research in East Texas was carried out in connection with reservoir construction. In
1948, for example, Robert L. Stephenson published the results of his work at the
proposed McGee Bend Reservoir in Angelina, Jasper, Nacogdoches, Sabine, and San
Augustine counties (Stephenson 1948a, 1948b). At the time this was the only
systematic professional major archaeological investigation in the county.

In the 1970s, Ross Fields (1979) presented an overview of the cultural resources
of the Davy Crockett, Sam Houston, Angelina, and Sabine National Forests of Texas.
This document provides a brief discussion of all sites in each forest; 23 sites in Angelina
County are mentioned. Another important document for this area is a cultural resource
overview of the National Forests in Texas by John Ippolito (1983). Of particular
relevance to this project is Ippolito's Figure 21 entitled "Drainage Systems & Probability
Zones, Angelina National Forest, Texas." Although no part of the project area is within
the Angelina National Forest, Ippolito's figure covers areas within 10 miles of the City of
Lufkin. He considers the Neches and Angelina rivers to be high probability areas with
several streams in the county listed as medium probability areas. According to Ippolito
(personal communication, July 15, 1999), there are several drainages in the county
such as Hurricane Creek and Biloxi Creek that should be considered to be medium to
high probability areas. Ephemeral streams such as those in the current project area are
viewed by Ippolito as low probability areas.
Most recently, four surveys of detention ponds have been performed in the
general area (Murin 1999; Moore 2000a, 2000b). Not one of these proposed detention
pond sites contained cultural materials.
It is beyond the scope of this report to discuss in detail the archaeological
background of Angelina County, especially when numerous contract reports are
available. The interested reader is referred to the statistical overview (Biesaart et al.
1985), the planning document published by the Texas Historical Commission
(Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993), and other reports cited above for more detailed
information regarding the archaeology of Angelina County.

FIELD METHODS
This investigation was performed by utilizing the 100% pedestrian survey
method. The entire 80.75 acres were walked by the survey crew at transect intervals of
30 meters or less. This investigation helped identify high and low probability areas
within the project area. A large area of approximately 25 acres that had been cleared
by the landowner prior to this survey was observed that contained less than 10%
ground cover. Surface visibility was excellent; therefore, this cleared area was not
shovel tested (Figure 3). Instead, the area was subjected to randomly placed shovel
probes which revealed a very shallow sandy mantle (less than 10 cm) overlying a red
clay. Another area of at least 15 acres was also examined by shovel probing. This
level, clayey bottomland also contained a very shallow sandy mantle over red clay. One
shovel test (ST 8) was dug in this area and revealed clay at 10 cm. The remaining
portion of the project area (uplands) was considered to be the best locality for finding a
prehistoric site. These uplands (approximately 40 acres), which were wooded, were
subjected to shovel testing. In all, 23 shovel tests were dug in the uplands (Figure 3).
All excavated matrix was screened using 1/4 inch hardware cloth and recorded on a
shovel test log (Appendix I). All shovel tests were excavated to clay and ranged in
depth from 10 to 50 cm. The number of shovel tests (n=23) dug in the high probability
area exceeds the number per acre required by the Archeological Survey Standards for
Texas as recommended by the Texas Historical Commission. Since clay was reached
through shovel testing, backhoe trenching was not necessary.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The site records at TARL yielded no previously recorded archaeological sites in
the project area. A review of the literature revealed that significant prehistoric and
historic sites are present in Angelina County. One previously recorded prehistoric site
(41AG21) is located on Cedar Creek near the confluence of this stream and Hurricane
Creek. This site, recorded by Gus Arnold of the University of Texas at Austin in 1939
during his informal survey of East Texas, is the closest recorded site to the current
project area. This prehistoric site is stated on the site form as about one acre in size on
the top of a sandy ridge (250 foot contour) that slopes into "bottom land and creeks to
the west and north." The age of this site is unknown; however, ceramics and projectile
points suggest a Late Prehistoric or Caddoan component.
The project area was found to be in an area composed primarily of one soil type;
Fuller-Urban Land Complex, 1 to 4 percent slopes (FuB). FuB soils are described in the
Soil Survey of Angelina County by Dolezel (1988:36-37). The complex of gently sloping
Fuller soil and Urban land is found on slightly concave to smooth uplands. It is about 50
percent Fuller soil, 35 percent Urban land, and 15 percent other soils. Typically, this
Fuller soil has a fine sandy loam surface layer about 23 inches thick. It is dark grayishbrown in the upper part and grayish-brown with strong brown mottles in the lower part.
The subsoil is clay loam to a depth of 42 inches. The subsoil has pockets of light gray
silty material throughout. Crawfish burrows are common throughout the surface and
subsoil layers. The underlying material is siltstone. Fuller soil is somewhat poorly
drained and very slowly permeable. This soil also has a high seasonal water table. The
urban land part of this complex is covered by streets, parking lots, and other structures
that obscure or alter the soils so that identification is not feasible.
The project area consists of a level, clayey bottomland (approximately 15 acres)
and uplands and slopes (approximately 65 acres). The creek, which bisects a portion of
the regional detention basin, consists of a wide, shallow valley with no defined creek
channel. This stream, as it appears today, suggests that it would not have been a
dependable source of water in prehistoric times. In fact, only a small portion of the
creek near the dam may have contained water following seasonal rains. Near the
proposed dam, a shallow creek channel was observed; inspection of the creek revealed
red clay in the bank. Although the project area is bisected by a tributary of Hurricane
Creek, it appears that this area was not considered a suitable location for prehistoric
occupation. This tributary may not have been a dependable source of water in the past,
and other areas along the main stream (Hurricane Creek) may have been selected
instead. Also, much of the project area was on a side slope instead of on top of the
landform. This may have been a factor in the absence of cultural materials. The lack of
deep sandy soils in the project area also point to a low probability area for prehistoric
sites. The 23 shovel tests averaged only 21.73 cm in depth.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the absence of archaeological sites in the project area, it is
recommended that construction be allowed to proceed. It is always possible that sites
are missed during any archaeological survey. Should evidence of a prehistoric or
historic site in the project area right-of-way be discovered during construction, all work
in this area should cease immediately until the Archeology Division, Texas Historical
Commission can evaluate the situation.
