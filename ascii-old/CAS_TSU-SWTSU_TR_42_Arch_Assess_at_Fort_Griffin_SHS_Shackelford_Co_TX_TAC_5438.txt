Abstract
Between November 17 and 19, 2009, the Center for Archaeological Studies (CAS) at Texas State
University-San Marcos conducted an intensive archaeological investigation of the proposed locations
of new interpretive signs and the proposed route for a buried power line at Fort Griffin State Historic
Site. Work was carried out by Jon C. Lohse, Jennifer Hatchett Kimbell, and Julian A. Sitters under
Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5438. Jon C. Lohse served as Principal Investigator and Jennifer
Kimbell served as Project Archaeologist.
The archaeologists excavated 19 shovel tests in the proposed locations of the new interpretive signs
and conducted pedestrian survey and excavated 21 shovel tests along the proposed power line route.
The proposed locations for the interpretive signs are mostly within the confines of site 41SF4, the fort
itself, but others will identify the civilian cemetery (41SF64), the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC)
camp established in 1938 (41SF73), and the late nineteenth century Jackson Homestead (41SF63). The
proposed power line route will run through portions of the fort site and the Jackson Homestead site.
Shovel tests encountered historic materials on the surface and within the first 20 centimeters below the
surface in numerous locations around the site. Most of these deposits appear to be peripheral scatters
– sheet middens – around the margins of known buildings and activity areas. Other remains may be
related to the CCC’s preservation and reconstruction work at the fort in the late 1930s. No deposits
indicating the locations of previously-unknown structures or occupation areas were encountered, and no
new archaeological sites were discovered during this cultural resources assessment. CAS recommends
the establishment of a program for monitoring the condition of the middens upon which some of the
interpretive signs are to be placed. No additional work is recommended with the installation of the
power line.

Introduction

During November 17-19, 2009, archaeologists
from CAS conducted shovel testing in the
proposed locations for the new interpretive signs
and performed a 100% pedestrian survey with
shovel testing along the proposed route of the
buried power line. In all, archaeologists excavated
40 shovel tests, including 19 in proposed sign
locations and 21 along the proposed power line
route, as well as surveying the entire 1156 m
length of the power line route. Previously recorded
archaeological sites 41SF4, 41SF63, 41SF64, and
41SF73 are within the area of potential effect
(APE) of the proposed improvements.

In November 2009, the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) contracted with the Center
for Archaeological Studies (CAS) at Texas State
University-San Marcos to conduct archaeological
investigations to determine the nature and extent
of archaeological remains that would be impacted
by planned developments to Fort Griffin State
Historic Site. The THC is planning improvements
to the site that required archaeological assessment.
Improvements include the installation of a number
of new interpretive signs, as well as the burial
underground of an overhead power line that runs
through portions of the site.

During the course of investigations, no new
archaeological sites or any previously-unknown
structures or activity areas of the fort were
discovered. The cultural remains were recovered
from the periphery of previously known fort
structures or previously known activity areas.
These items represent the thin layer of historic
materials that characterize the ground after
the abandonment of a historic site. These sheet
middens tend to be highest in artifact density
nearest a structure or activity area and decrease
in density with distance from this center point.

Fort Griffin is listed on the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) and has been designated
as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL). Fort
Griffin is currently operated and maintained by
the THC. As the THC is a political subdivision
of the State of Texas, the project is subject to
the provisions of the Texas Antiquities Code,
now subsumed in Title 13, Part II of the Texas
Administrative Code. This legislation defines
the necessary conditions for the recognition
and preservation of SALs and requires that
any political subdivision of the State of Texas,
defined as a local government entity created and
operating under the laws of this state, including
a city, county, school district, or special district
created under the Texas Constitution, Article III,
52 (b)(1) or (2), or Article XVI, 59 in 13 TAC
26.5 of the code, must identify potential SALs
through survey of public lands prior to actions
that could potentially damage those SALs. The
codes’ provisions are administered by the THC
Archeology Division. The proposed investigations
will determine whether the proposed undertaking
will affect archaeological historic properties (36
CFR 800.16(1)) or SALs (13 TAC 26.12).

Environmental Setting
Fort Griffin State Historic Site is located
on the northern edge of Shackelford County, in
the Rolling Plains region of Texas (Figure 1).
This area is part of the Southern Lower Plains
and is characterized by a flat rolling terrain with
prominent hills and buttes, narrow drainage
valleys in the uplands, and broader riverine
systems. The park is characterized by bluff
tops, steep slopes, terraces, and an active flood
plain. The park is drained by Mill Creek, a minor
tributary of the Clear Fork of the Brazos River,
which borders on its southeast edge. Government

Hill, a prominent feature of the park, is the
location of the old military post. U.S. Highway
271 bisects the park between Government Hill in
the northwest portion of the park and Mill Creek
on the southeast portion. Vegetation of the area is
characterized by mesquite, cacti, and grasslands
on the uplands and terraces, and a thin riparian
forest consisting of cottonwoods, elm, and willow
along the river margins. Small chinaberry and
scattered elms are located along Mill Creek.

layers. Caliche is common in well-drained
middle to lower horizons (Burkhalter 1999).
The main soil series mapping units present are
the Clairemont-Grandfield-Clearfork association
and the Leery-Pitzer-Wichita association
soils (Figure 2). The Clairemont-GrandfieldClearfork association soils are mainly found on
recent floodplain sediments. These soils include
Clairemont silt clay loam (Cm) and Clearfork
silty clay loam (Co). Clairemont series soils are
formed in calcareous, sitly alluvium and are well
drained and moderately permeable. Clearfork
series soils are typically well drained, slowly
permeable, and form in the flood plains of
major streams in calcareous, clayey and loamy
alluvial sediments. The upland and terrace areas

Soils within the park area are derived from
local bedrock material and are mostly clay and
silt based. Some of the upper soil layers are
deflated and some Quaternary-age loess (windblown deposits) is present within the surface

are mainly composed of Leeray-Pitzer-Wichita
association soils, consisting of Leeray clay (LeB)
and Wichita clay loam (WcB). Leeray series soils
are found in upland areas and are well drained,
slowly permeable, and form in calcareous clay.
Wichita soils are located on gentle slopes and
are well drained, moderately slowly permeable,
and form in calcareous alluvial materials. Minor
amounts of Frio silty clay (Fr), Hensley stony
clay loam (HeB), Lueders very gravelly clay
loam (LrC), Nukrum clay (NuB), Rowena clay
loam (RoB), and the Trock-Palopinto (TPC/TPG)
association can also be found within the park
(Lowther et al. 1990). Frio series soils (Fr) form in
the bottomlands of local streams and are typically
well drained, moderately slowly permeable, and
formed in loamy, clayey, calcareous alluvium.
Hensley soils (HeB) form mostly on limestone
and are well drained and moderately permeable.
The Lueders series (LrC) soils form on limestone
in upland settings and are well drained and
moderately permeable. Nukrum series soils (NuB)
are located in filled valleys in lowland areas and
are well drained, slowly permeable, and form in
calcareous, clayey sediments from interbedded
limestone and shale. The Rowena series
soils(RoB) are located on broad upland areas and
are well drained, moderately slowly permeable,
and form in calcareous, loamy, clayey outwash
material. Trock-Palopinto association soils (TPC/
TPG) comprise a minor soil association of deep
to shallow undulating upland soils. These soils
contain inherent gravel and flagstone throughout
their profile (Lowther et al. 1990). Varying
amounts of calcium carbonate nodules (caliche)
are present within these soils (Burkhalter 1999).

Cultural History Background
Fort Griffin lies within the West Central
Texas Archeological Region of Texas (Perttula
1995). The area is referred to locally as “Clear
Fork Country” and it is peripheral to the better
archaeologically studied area of the Southern
Plains Region. Six cultural historic periods are
recognized for the region: Paleoindian, Plains
Archaic, Plains Woodland, Plains Village,
Protohistoric, and Historic.

Paleoindian
The Paleoindian period begins prior to 8000
years ago (Anderson 1975), at which time the
region’s climate was cooler and wetter than it is at
present. This period is characterized by nomadic
groups following and hunting large mammals
such as mammoth and bison. Larger camps
are occasionally found that provide evidence
for more broad-spectrum adaptations and diet.
Archaeological sites of the period consist of kill
sites, open campsites, and isolated finds (Anderson
1975). Lanceolate points and finely made blade
tools are distinctive artifact characteristics of the
period (Hammatt 1970).

Plains Archaic
By about 8000 years ago, conditions gradually
shifted toward a warmer and drier climate, and
populations changed from nomadic to a more
specialized foraging way of life (Hammatt 1970).
The earlier hunting tradition continued but began
to focus increasingly on the exploitation of local
resources. A more specialized tool kit consisting of
gouges, burins, scrapers, retouched cutting tools,
scraper planes, choppers, and grinding stones
emerged. Dart points are varied, but stemmed
and notched varieties dominate (Etcheison et
al. 1978). Archaeological sites of the period are

and occupation sites on high terraces and hills
(Schaeffer 1996).

A.D. 1500. These groups roamed the southeastern
Plains following bison herds occupying small
temporary camps dependent upon localized
seasonally available resources.

Plains Woodlands

Little was written about the area until 1757
when a mission was established for the Apache
on the San Sabá River. The mission was attacked
by Wichita, Comanche, and Caddo raiders in 1758
and was finally abandoned the following year,
although the associated Presidio de San Sabá was
left in place until 1770. Wichita and Comanche
groups had established fortified villages along
the Red River during this time period. The West
Texas area was held as a common hunting area
by all of the Southern Plains cultural groups, but
the Comanche considered the Clear Fork region
to be part of their homeland (Kenmotsu et al.
1994:20-25). The Kiowa entered the Southern
Plains around 1800 followed by the Cheyenne
and Arapaho around 1840.

Around 2000 years ago the Archaic Woodland
period emerges. The period is characterized by
thick, conchoidal-based, cord-marked and Jornada
brownware ceramics as well as corner-notched
dart points. The period extends from about A.D.
200 to circa A.D. 800/1000. Archaeological
sites consist of semi-sedentary occupations with
possible horticultural manifestations. This period
is poorly represented and not well understood
within the region.

Plains Village
The Plains Village period begins around
A.D. 1000 and is characterized by settled villages
whose occupants participated in bison hunting
and horticulture. Large populations are suggested
by a number of settlements that measure in size
between five and ten or more acres. The Fort
Griffin area is considered to be peripheral to
the Plains Village cultural region and may have
functioned as a frontier or outlier during this time
period. Archaeological sites of this time period
consist of villages located on prominent terraces
with arable land next to reliable water sources.
Plains Village cultural groups disappeared
around the mid-fifteenth century. Warm, dry
climatic conditions may have upset the tenuous
horticulture balance, and the influx of outside
cultural groups may have disrupted occupation
patterns.

Historic
The Comanche appear in the region around
the beginning of the eighteenth century,
displacing their Apache predecessors. Within a
century the Comanche came to consider most
of the Southern Plains as their homeland, know
historically as Comancheria (Fehrenbach 1974).
The Comanche were mounted bison hunters who
lived in temporary and seasonal villages along
major waterways (Kenmotsu et al. 1994).
Following the annexation of Texas by the
United States in 1845, the rapidly-increasing
Anglo population displaced the Comanche and
other local Indian groups from their hunting
lands and homes. In 1849, the U.S. began building
a chain of military posts in Texas in order to
protect Anglo settlers from Indian aggression and
to maintain the border between the United States
and Mexico (Cruse 2008; Graham 1968). These
forts also provided protection for mail routes and

Protohistoric
The Protohistoric period begins with the 1541
Vasquez de Coronado expedition and continues
until the mid-eighteenth century. Records of the
Coronado expedition provide scant descriptions
of probable Plains Apache groups. The Plains
Apache appear in the Southern Plains around

The frontier forts of this period were not heavilyfortified complexes capable of withstanding direct
attacks. They were, rather, bases of supplies and
shelter from which excursions could be made.

launching point and supply post for U.S. Army
campaigns against local Indian groups.
During the period of time that Fort Griffin
was home to a portion of the U.S. Army, the town
of Fort Griffin, also known as “Griffin” or “the
Flats” grew up at the base of Government Hill.
The military presence protected settlers, and
the town provided the soldiers with places for
amusement and recreation. The town became a
hub for the equipping of buffalo hunts and cattle
drives and was notorious for its outlaws, saloons,
and prostitutes (Rister 1956).

During the Civil War, Texas surrendered its
forts to the Confederacy, and although many of
these posts were abandoned at this time, some
were kept in use for protection against Union
forces. When the Union had subdued most of
Texas, it occupied some of these frontier forts for a
brief period. By the time Reconstruction was well
under way, the Indian threat that had prompted
the establishment of the fortifications had largely
disappeared. As a result, many of the forts began
their long decline; some were used periodically
by various travelers or townspeople, but most
were simply abandoned (Graham 1968).

In 1881, the army officially abandoned Fort
Griffin. The town, dependent as it was on the fort
for protection and business, soon was eclipsed
by Albany which received both the county seat
of Shackelford County and the railroad. By the
early 1900s, the town of Fort Griffin had been
virtually abandoned (Rister 1956).

Fort Griffin
In July 1867, Lt. Col. S.D. Sturgis established
Camp Wilson on what is now known as Government
Hill, near the Clear Fork of the Brazos River. Four
companies of the Sixth Cavalry moved from Fort
Belknap to the new location when their previous
post was found to be unsuitable due to a lack of
fresh water. Camp Wilson became Fort Griffin
the following year according to a special order;
the new name honored Colonel Charles Griffin
of the Thirty-Fifth Cavalry, who had died in
1867 after commanding the Department of Texas
(Rister 1956).

Previous Investigations
Excluding the site of the fort itself, Fort
Griffin State Park contains 12 registered
archaeological sites, reflecting a number of
different investigations. Crouch (1990) recorded
and Ralph (1991) and Briscoe (1999) examined one
deeply-buried prehistoric site, 41SF21, at the far
eastern edge of the park. Fox (1976) investigated
a civilian cemetery probably dating to the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, site
41SF64, which Briscoe (1999) revisited. Briscoe
(1999) also recorded an additional 11 sites during
a survey of the entire park. Several of these sites
(41SF66, 41SF67, 41SF68, 41SF71) are buried
prehistoric deposits of unknown age or extent. Site
41SF69 contains a buried prehistoric component
as well as a possible nineteenth-century store.
Another multi-component site, 41SF70, includes

Fort Griffin, like many of the frontier forts,
consisted of a group of structures loosely clustered
around a parade ground. The first buildings on the
hill were of simple picket construction, although
some were later replaced with stone structures.
Many of the fort buildings were made only of
lumber or of lumber with a stone foundation and/
or chimney (Graham 1968). During the Red River
War in the early 1870s, Fort Griffin served as a
6

buried prehistoric deposits and a disturbed light
scatter of historic materials consistent with the
time period of the fort’s primary occupation.
A lithic procurement area was identified in the
southern end of the park and recorded as 41SF72.
Site 41SF63 is another multi-component site that
contains a prehistoric lithic procurement area
and a nineteenth-century two-story stone house
known as the Jackson Homestead. The site of the
CCC camp established in 1938 was recorded as
41SF73.

Griffin in June and July of 1971 in cooperation
with Texas Parks and Wildlife (Yates 1973).
During these investigations, archaeologists
excavated the remains of one building identified
as officer’s quarters and tested the four structures
that made up the hospital complex.
Anne A. Fox (1973) led investigations of the
fort by the Texas Archeological Salvage Project
(later known at the Texas Archeological Survey)
in February 1973, under the general direction
of David S. Dibble. This project’s primary goal
was to determine, with future restoration work in
mind, the potential for further excavations in the
area of the fort northwest of the parade ground.
Fox’s (1973) investigations included attempts to
locate and test (using land clearing and trenching)
six officer’s quarters, a barracks building, four
rows of enlisted men’s huts, four kitchen-mess
structures, a guardhouse, and a blacksmith shop.
The officer’s quarters, barracks, and enlisted
men’s huts proved to still contain relatively intact
deposits, while the locations of the kitchen-mess
structures, guardhouse, and blacksmith shop
were only tentatively identified.

Several archaeological studies have also
focused on the fort itself, which is registered as
41SF4. In 1938, the CCC set up a camp near Fort
Griffin from which they performed a number
of park improvements. The CCC conducted an
archaeological survey and limited excavations
between 1940 and 1941, led by Roland Beard
(Beard 1940). The CCC also worked to stabilize
some of the structural remains of the fort.
Unfortunately, the notes from this work were
never published, although they are on file with
Texas Parks and Wildlife.
In 1969, Dr. Dee Ann Story led a two-month
archaeological investigation of the fort by the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (Olds
1969). The primary motivation for this research
was a plan for architectural reconstruction
and restoration at the fort. The archaeologists
discovered the original locations of the parade
ground and the flagpole as well as four rows
of enlisted men’s huts and a row of officer’s
quarters, all near the parade ground. Another set
of officer’s quarters, the library, and two different
types of enlisted men’s huts were also located and
excavated. In addition, the standing remains of
the administration building and the Sutler’s store
were documented.

In March, April, and June of 1976, Anne Fox
(1976) revisited Fort Griffin with crews from
the Center for Archaeological Research of the
University of Texas at San Antonio; Thomas R.
Hester was the Principal Investigator. During
this 1976 work, crews relocated buildings and
pathways located in 1973 and marked them with
permanent metal stakes. They also examined
certain other areas in an effort to determine
whether pathways or structures were located in
those portions of the site.

The Texas Archeological Salvage Project, led
by David S. Dibble, conducted excavations at Fort

Methodology

Along the proposed route of the buried power
line, which the electric company had marked with
orange pin flags, pedestrian survey and shovel
testing were used to determine the presence and
nature of any surface or subsurface remains. In
all, 21 shovel tests were excavated along this
route, most of them spaced approximately 100
m apart and others located in areas near known
architectural features or where surface materials
indicated possibly buried features (Figure 4). All
shovel tests for both portions of the project were
30 cm in diameter and were excavated in 20-cm
levels to 30 cm in depth or to impenetrable rock.
All soil from these shovel tests was screened
through ¼-inch hardware cloth, and any artifacts
recovered from shovel tests were collected in bags
marked with the shovel test number and level. The
archaeologists noted results of each shovel test,
including depth, soil descriptions, and artifacts
exposed on a shovel test form. Each shovel test

Archaeologists from CAS conducted
shovel testing of the 19 proposed locations for
interpretive signs and conducted a pedestrian
survey and shovel testing of the proposed route of
the buried power line over three days in November
2009. Because the interpretive signs will impact
only very specific locations within the fort, a
pedestrian survey for this portion of the project
was not necessary. However, the archaeologists
carefully examined the ground surrounding
the proposed location for each sign and noted
any cultural material that was present on the
surface. Prior to the beginning of archaeological
investigations, a park employee had marked the
proposed location for each sign on the ground
with an orange spray-painted “X.” One shovel
test was placed in each marked location, for a
total of 19 shovel tests (Figure 3).

sign at the mess hall, Shovel Test 2, was located
less than one meter south of the reconstructed
mess hall structure (Figure 5). The ground surface
surrounding the mess hall is lightly littered with
small fragments of glass, metal, and ceramic. This
shovel test yielded a number of artifacts. Within
the upper 20 cm were a large fragment of metal
(Figure 6), six small metal fragments, three small
machine-headed cut nails, and one fragment of
heavily patinated glass. Between 20 and 35 cmbs
a larger machine-headed cut nail and the proximal
(head) end of a slotted flat-head wood screw
were recovered. The building materials found
in this shovel test are not temporally diagnostic.
Machine-headed cut nails have been in use since
about 1835, and the wood screw is most likely a
20th-century addition. These building materials
may relate to the reconstruction of the mess hall
rather than to the original mid-19th-century
structure. The small glass fragment displays
sufficient patination to suggest it may date
from the original fort occupation. The large and
small metal fragments are also not temporally
diagnostic. The shovel test was terminated at
approximately 35 cmbs due to the presence of
impenetrable rock.

Proposed Interpretive Sign Locations
The CAS crew excavated 19 shovel tests in
proposed locations for new interpretive signs in
several areas of the park (Appendix A). Fifteen
of those shovel tests were in direct association
with structures belonging to the fort itself. Of
the other four shovel tests, one was located at the
CCC camp, one at the cemetery, and two at the
residence near the campground. Each of these
shovel tests is discussed briefly below. See Figure
3 for shovel test locations.

Visitor’s Center
Shovel Test 1 was located east of the visitor’s
center, on an elevated mound of sediments that
was artificially raised up when the visitor’s center
was built. The shovel test was terminated at
approximately 40 cm below the surface (cmbs),
and the only material recovered was some broken
concrete that is not temporally diagnostic, found
in the upper 20 cm.

Mess Hall
The mess hall, like a number of other
structures at the fort, is surrounded by a cleared
area of land. The shovel test for the interpretive

First Sergeant’s Quarters
Shovel Test 3, near the First
Sergeant’s quarters, was located
immediately adjacent to the
existing interpretive sign for
this structure, approximately
three meters southeast of the
foundation and within the
cleared area surrounding the
feature. This shovel test yielded
no artifacts and was terminated
at 25 cmbs due to the presence of
stone that may be architectural
in nature.

this fragment is coated with a
white mineral residue and may
also be remains of window glass.
None of the artifacts recovered
in this shovel test are temporally
diagnostic, although the glass
and concrete could date to the
original occupation of the fort.

Parade Grounds
The proposed location of
the new interpretive sign for
the parade ground and flagpole
is very near the location of the
current sign, on the northwest
side of the parade ground near
the walking path. The proposed
sign location is on a maintained

and one slotted flat-head wood screw identical to
the one found near the mess hall. The shovel test
was terminated at approximately 35 cmbs.

Officer’s Quarters
Although there were a number of officers’
quarters at Fort Griffin during its primary
period of occupation, the chimney from one such
structure has been reconstructed and represents
how such chimneys, often built onto wooden
structures, would have appeared. The interpretive
sign for this location is to be placed slightly to the
east of the standing chimney. Shovel Test 7, the
shovel test for this sign, was dug to 30 cmbs, but
only the upper 20 cm yielded artifacts. One item
recovered from this test was a flat fragment of

Library

Shovel Test 5 was located about 20 cm south
of the cleared area surrounding the foundation,
on a maintained grassy area. Two very lightly
patinated clear glass fragments that may represent
window glass were found in the upper 20 cm of
this shovel test, along with some fragments of
concrete. Between 20 and 30 cmbs one small flat

The dorsal side of this fragment is completely
flat, while the ventral side is beveled on two
edges. The third edge appears to have been cut,
as though the artifact was once part of a longer
item, possibly the tip of a sword or bayonet
(Figure 7). One small fragment of clear flat
glass that may represent window or bottle glass
and one small fragment of clear, slightly curved
glass that may be from a bottle were found in
this shovel test; both of these fragments are only
slightly patinated. This shovel test also yielded
one complete and two fragmentary cut nails.
This part of the site appears considerably less
disturbed than other areas that have been heavily
reconstructed, either through CCC work or later
modifications to the fort. Additionally, no gravel
layer was observed in the shovel test, suggesting
that sediments here are relatively intact and free
of post-fort modifications. It is considered likely
that intact archaeological deposits associated

with the fort occupation are present elsewhere
near this structure remnant.

Sutler’s Store
The Sutler’s Store is located at the far northern
extent of the site area and is well-represented by
standing stone remains, much of which may be
original, but some of which has undoubtedly
been reconstructed (Figure 8). Shovel Test 8
yielded one very small, thin fragment of metal
and six fragments of glass, all from the upper 20
cm. Three glass fragments are either clear or very
pale aqua and are flat, thin, and slightly patinated;
they may be remains of window glass. The other
three fragments of glass are slightly patinated
amber bottle glass. Any of these artifacts may be
remains from the primary occupation of the fort,
or they may represent a later use. This shovel test
was terminated at 30 cmbs.

Administration Building

The standing stone remains
of the administration building
lie to the northeast of the
parade grounds. The proposed
sign location for this structure
is immediately adjacent to
the existing interpretive sign,
approximately one meter east
of the gravel footpath and on
an area of maintained grass.
Shovel Test 9 yielded two wire
nails, four fragments of what
were probably machine cut nails
(the heads are missing), and
one small flat fragment of clear,
probably window, glass. The only
possibly temporally diagnostic
artifacts from this shovel test are
two fragments of the end piece
of a probable hole-in-cap tin can.

The powder magazine lies
well to the south of the main fort
complex. This building lacks a

magazine, between the building
and the gravel footpath. Shovel

Bakery

Well

The reconstructed stone bakery is on the
southeastern side of the fort complex. The
proposed location for the interpretive sign is to
the southwest of the structure near the gravel
path. Although fragments of glass and a modern
razor blade were visible on the surface near the
bakery, the 30 cm deep shovel test, Shovel Test
11, yielded no artifacts.

The fort’s well is east of but near the visitor’s
center. The proposed location for the new
interpretive sign is immediately adjacent to the
existing sign, just off the gravel footpath. The
shovel test at this location, Shovel Test 14, yielded
only one small metal fragment from the upper 20
cm, and it was terminated at 30 cmbs.

Commanding Officer’s Quarters

Civilian Cemetery

The location of the commanding officer’s
quarters is southwest of the administration
building. All that is currently visible is a stone
foundation and the interpretive sign. The
proposed location of the new interpretive sign is
southwest of the structure and on the grassy area
surrounding the foundation. Glass, nails, and
metal fragments litter the ground surrounding
the foundation. Shovel Test 15 was excavated
in this area. The upper 20 cm of this shovel test
yielded three small flat metal fragments, one
pale aqua and three clear glass bottle fragments,
two complete machine-headed cut nails, and
two nail fragments, lacking the heads. One
moderately-patinated green bottle glass fragment
was recovered from between 20 and 30 cmbs, at
which point the shovel test was terminated.

This location is between Highway 283 and
what is now referred to as the “Residence” but
was originally the two-story Jackson Homestead,
site 41SF63 (Briscoe 1999). An interpretive sign
discussing the nearby civilian cemetery, site
41SF64 (Fox 1976), is to be located just outside a
fenced-in area. Shovel Test 18 was excavated here
to a depth of 38 cmbs, but yielded no artifacts.

Residence
A final interpretive sign is to replace the
sign currently marking the “Residence,” which is
located at the campground entrance, southeast of
the fort. Shovel Test 19 was excavated to 22 cmbs
and yielded no artifacts.

CCC Camp
The 1938-1941 camp area of
the CCC, site 41SF73, near Fort
Griffin is unmarked at present. It
lies almost due south of the Fort
Griffin visitor’s center and was
investigated by Briscoe (1999).
Shovel Test 16 was excavated
at the proposed location for the
interpretive sign to a depth of 30
cmbs but yielded no artifacts.

Cemetery
Another interpretive sign is
to be installed near the military
cemetery associated with Fort
Griffin. The cemetery is located
south of the fort itself. Shovel
Test 17 was placed near this
cemetery was terminated at 30
cmbs and yielded no artifacts.

Proposed Buried Power Line Route

Shovel Test 28

Of the 21 shovel tests excavated along the
proposed route of the buried power line, only
eight yielded any artifacts (see Figure 4 and
Appendix A). These shovel test units are briefly
described below:

Shovel Test 28 was located in a small clearing
in a stand of trees near the powder magazine. The
shovel test was slightly off the power line route in
an area that was scattered with historic artifacts.
The excavation of this test ended at 15 cmbs
when the excavations encountered impenetrable
rock. Other than the surface materials collected
for analysis, the shovel test yielded one white- or
gray-glazed stoneware sherd from the upper 5 cm.
Four large sherds of a white or gray stoneware
bottle were collected from the surface of this
shovel test and represent most of a Grosvenor 8
Glasgow beer bottle (Figure 10). These bottles
were manufactured in Scotland between 1869
and 1926, and this artifact undoubtedly dates to
the period of original fort occupation. Also from

Shovel Test 20
Shovel Test 20 was excavated to 44 cmbs and
yielded three slightly-patinated clear bottle glass
fragments, all from the surface.

Shovel Test 23
The location for Shovel Test 23 was chosen
due to a large number of metal fragments on
the surface, some of which were collected. The
shovel test was excavated to 35 cmbs and yielded
no subsurface artifacts. The
fragments of metal collected
from the surface are pieces of
metal cans. One fragment is a
nearly complete cap from a holein-top can (Figure 9). These cans
were produced between 1820 and
1930 (Sutton and Arkush 2002).
Other fragments represent the
cylindrical portions of cans with
the distinctive double side seam,
which was developed in 1888
(Sutton and Arkush 2002). These
can fragments were found on
slightly sloping terrain and may
not have been in their original
contexts.

Shovel Test 25
Shovel Test 25 was excavated
southeast of the fort bakery. This
shovel test reached 25 cmbs and
yielded one moderately-patinated
amber bottle glass fragment from
the upper 20 cm.

Shovel Test 34
The crew excavated Shovel
Test 34 east of Shovel Test 31 in
an attempt to determine whether
the materials found in Shovel
Test 31 represented part of an
intact deposit. The upper 20 cm
of Shovel Test 34 yielded two
machine-headed cut nails, two
fragments of green and three
fragments of clear slightlypatinated glass, and one small
fragment of heavily-patinated
opaque glass. Two of the clear
glass fragments may represent
window glass, while the other
glass fragments are probably
bottle glass. The clear bottle glass
fragment is slightly solarized.
The shovel test was terminated
at 21 cmbs due to impenetrable
rock.

Shovel Test 36
Shovel Test 36 is located on
a slight slope that leads south
off the plateau, almost directly
south of the fort well. A scatter
of historic materials prompted
the excavation of Shovel Test
36, but, as the shovel test yielded no subsurface
artifacts, these surface materials may be out
of their original contexts. This shovel test was
terminated at 18 cmbs due to impenetrable rock.
A sample of surface artifacts was collected:
two sherds of white-glazed earthenware, one
sherd of thick white or gray-glazed stoneware,
one thin flat metal fragment, two fragments of
highly-patinated green bottle glass, one fragment
of slightly-patinated amber bottle glass, one
fragment of slightly-patinated translucent pale
green glass, two fragments of slightly patinated
green bottle glass, one fragment of unpatinated

near the shovel test, an intact, slightly-patinated
amber glass bottle, likely dating from the earlyto mid-twentieth century was recovered.

Shovel Test 31
West of the powder magazine, Shovel Test
31 reached only 7 cmbs due to the presence of
impenetrable rock. Within those upper 7 cm
were found one machine-headed cut nail, one
flat metal fragment, one moderately-patinated
fragment of thick green bottle glass, and one very
heavily patinated small fragment of bottle glass
of indeterminate color (Figure 11).

are not in their original contexts
and represent items from various
locations at the fort; however,
any
temporally
diagnostic
materials could indicate the ages
of deposits elsewhere at the site.
The materials collected from this
location included one machineheaded cut nail, one fragment of
a probable hole-in-top can, one
fragment of translucent bottle
glass, one fragment of milk
glass, two fragments of solarized
clear bottle glass, and several
fragments of slightly-patinated
clear bottle glass, including a
bottle neck and lip (Figure 15).

window glass, and one fragment of solarized
clear bottle glass (Figure 12).

Historic Scatter 2 was a diffuse collection of
small fragments of historic material, primarily
glass. Historic Scatter 3 comprised a cluster of
relatively recent materials (mid- to late-twentieth
century) including barbed wire, a thin metal
sheet with an attached strap hinge, and other
unidentifiable metal fragments. No artifacts were
collected from these scatters.

Shovel Test 38
Shovel Test 38 was located south of the
visitor’s center and southwest of the road leading
into the park. This shovel test reached 30 cmbs
but yielded artifacts from only the upper 5 cm.
The excavations recovered one machine-headed
cut nail and two fragments of metal strap that
bear indications of rivet or fastener holes.

Historic Scatters

Conclusions and
Recommendations

During the course of pedestrian survey,
three scatters of historic artifacts were identified
(Figure 13). While isolated historic materials
were present across the site, these three areas
were characterized by a relatively high density
of historic materials. A sample of artifacts was
collected only from Historic Scatter 1, which
was located on a steep slope east of the powder
magazine (Figure 14). Because of the sloping
nature of the location and the lack of subsurface
remains in nearby Shovel Tests 23 and 24, it may

The site of historic Fort Griffin comprises the
remains of structures, each surrounded by a thin
layer or sheet midden of scattered historic materials.
Sheet middens contain artifact evidence from
CCC-era camp reconstruction in most cases, but
also intact remains from the original period of fort
construction and occupation in some instances.
The concentration of these historic artifacts is
highest near structural remains and diminishes
17

outwards with distance. Because the site is on a
hilltop and exposed to wind and rain, these sheet
middens constitute very delicate deposits; there
is very little to no soil deposition to protect the
materials. The large quantity of artifacts found
on the surface of slopes that are topographically
below the fort attest to the fragility of these
deposits, which are clearly being carried down
slope by gravity and rainwater. Improvements
proposed by the THC represent little threat to the
archaeology of the fort. CAS, however, contends
that some of the proposed improvements and

signage placements may impact these delicate
sheet midden deposits.
The current proposed locations of some of the
interpretive signs are exceedingly close to certain
structures, and are clearly within the concentration
of historic materials located adjacent to these
structures. While the installation of the signs will
result in no additional damage following the shovel
testing described in this report, CAS believes that
placing the markers in very close proximity to the
structures will have the effect of drawing park
visitors into these sheet midden areas, resulting
18

and program for monitoring the
condition of these middens over
time. If sufficient deterioration is
documented, it may be necessary
for the THC to regulate the traffic
in these areas, or to undertake
measures to offset the impact to
these deposits.

in some disturbance to archaeological materials
scattered on and near the surface. CAS therefore
recommends that the THC proceed with the
installation of these new interpretive signs, yet be
cognizant of the resulting impact from the foot
traffic in and around sheet midden deposits that
surround each of the park’s historic structures.
CAS recommends that the THC devise a schedule
19

In addition, shovel tests
and surface survey indicate
that one section of the proposed
buried power line route contains
archaeological deposits. While
it appears that these deposits
may have resulted from colluvial
down-slope wash, they do contain
artifact remains dating from the
period of initial fort occupation.
CAS concludes that this area
of the site has strong potential
to yield important information
about early periods of fort
construction and occupation,
albeit not from in-situ deposits.
However, because none of the
deposits here are intact and
those that are present are limited
to the surface, no additional
work is recommended here in
conjunction with the installation
of the underground power line.
