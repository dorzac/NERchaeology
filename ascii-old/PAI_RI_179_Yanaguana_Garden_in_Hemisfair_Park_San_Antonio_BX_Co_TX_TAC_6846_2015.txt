Chapter 1: introduction

This report describes archeological efforts done under six work orders
for the development of Yanaguana Garden at HemisFair Park in downtown San
Antonio, Texas. All of the projects were done by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (PAI),
for Adams Environmental, Inc. (AEI), and the City of San Antonio, Transportation
and Capital Improvements (CoSA-TCI), under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 6846
(issued April 14, 2014). As described below, the Yanaguana Garden project is the
first phase of a planned redevelopment of HemisFair Park for mixed-use purposes.
Planning for how to deal with cultural resources during this redevelopment began
in 2012 when PAI prepared two reports summarizing known archeological and
historical resources and providing recommendations for future work (Dase 2013;
Fields and McWilliams 2012). Almost all of the subsequent work reported here dealt
strictly with the permitted archeological investigations, with limited effort going
toward historical resources under a single work order.
Summary of Work Orders
The first work order (WO 34-2014-02-26; PAI 214006) commenced on
February 27, 2014, and consisted of two main tasks. One entailed obtaining an
antiquities permit for all archeological work to be done in connection with the
development of Yanaguana Garden, and the other involved updating and completing
the archeological file search, literature review, and data compilation done in 2012.
The latter task included all of HemisFair Park but provided the most detail on the
southwest corner where Yanaguana Garden would be; the result of that effort is
included as Appendix B to this report.
The second work order (WO 37-2014-04-24; PAI 214016) was issued on
April 28, 2014, and dealt solely with archeological trenching, and subsequent
monitoring, for construction of an emergency service drive and storm drain to be
built at the north edge of Yanaguana Garden in advance of park construction. The
third work order (WO 39-2014-07-24; PAI 214022), issued on July 25, 2014, also
was for an activity that preceded park construction; it consisted of archeological
monitoring of the removal of lead-contaminated sediments at two locations in the
west-central and northeast parts of the park.
The fourth work order (WO 43-2014-08-04; PAI 214028) was issued on
August 4, 2014, and had two tasks. One involved successful archeological trenching
to search for the remains of a known site within the Yanaguana Garden project
area, the Acequia Madre (or Alamo Acequia; 41BX8). The other consisted of

Archeological Investigations at Yanaguana Garden
providing a comprehensive assessment of the known and potential archeological
and historical resources that could be impacted by the Yanaguana Garden project
and recommendations for appropriate investigations to deal with those resources.
The fifth work order (WO 44-2014-08-18; PAI 214029) was issued on
August 18, 2014. Most of it involved providing an assessment of known and potential
archeological and historical resources that could be impacted by proposed street
and utilities improvements (the Internal Streets Project) along the north and east
edges of the project area; because these improvements will be outside Yanaguana
Garden proper and any archeological work done in connection with them will be
under a separate permit, they are not addressed in the body of this report; the result
of that study is included as Appendix C to this report, though. This work order also
included efforts to finalize the Yanaguana Garden-specific data compilation done
under the first work order (see Appendix B).
The sixth work order (WO 46-2014-10-06; PAI 214033) was issued on October
6, 2014. It involved archeological monitoring of construction activities at Yanaguana
Garden from their inception on October 13 through December 2014, when another
contractor assumed responsibility for monitoring under a different antiquities
permit. It also involved analysis and reporting of data generated by all six work
orders to create this report.
The first five work orders resulted in a compilation of archeological and other
data to aid in planning work at Yanaguana Garden, three preliminary reports on
archeological fieldwork, and one document reporting overall recommendations for
the project area, in addition to the antiquities permit application (Table 1). All of
these documents are synthesized in this report, along with the methods and results
of monitoring done under the sixth work order (for which a preliminary report was
not produced).

Chapter 1: Introduction
As noted, only one work order involved historical resources, and that consisted
of incorporating such resources into the Yanaguana Garden recommendations
document. That document noted that the following historical resources are
contributing components in a National Registerâeligible historic district in the
immediate vicinity of the Yanaguana Garden project area: Beethoven Hall; the O.K.
Bar; the Eager house and its associated carriage house and dependency; the AcostaHalff, Kampmann-Halff, Amaya, Smith, Solis, Pereida, Koehler, and Espinoza houses;
and the Celanese Fountain. Only the Celanese Fountain would be impacted directly
by the project, however, and additional research indicated that its National Register
status should be changed to a noncontributing resource to the district. Review of
1966 site plans, a 1974 map, aerial images from 1966, 1973, 1986, and 2004, and
photographs from 1968 and 2012 showed that the fountain was moved from its
original position closer to South Alamo Street near the north side of the presentday location of the O.K. Bar. By 1970, the fountain had been vandalized, according
to an August 27 article in the San Antonio Express. The base was broken, and the
original two-tier center piece had been demolished. In 2012, a modern three-tiered
center piece had been installed. The fountain was moved sometime between 1986
and 2004. As a result, it no longer retained integrity of location, design, materials,
workmanship, or feeling.
The HemisFair Park Master Plan
The 2012 file search, literature review, and data compilation covered a 104acre area specified for development in the HemisFair Park Master Plan (HemisFair
Park Area Redevelopment Corporation 2012). That included the full 96-acre extent
of HemisFair Park (bounded by South Alamo Street on the west, Market Street on
the north, South Bowie Street on the east, and East Cesar Chavez Boulevard on
the south (and thus encompassing the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center and
adjoining buildings), plus 8 acres south of East Cesar Chavez Boulevard (Figure 1).
As presented in the Master Plan, the primary components of the project would
be the following: (1) reestablishing a portion of the pre-1968 (i.e., pre-HemisFair
â68) street grid; (2) creation of approximately 33 acres of parks and open spaces;
(3) reconfiguring some of the current civic space; (4) new development for mixed civic,
commercial, and residential uses on about 35 acres; and (5) construction of parking
structures. Reestablishing the pre-1968 street grid would involve reconstructing
on the their original locations Goliad Street (or East Nueva Street, as of the end of
2014) from South Alamo to South Bowie Streets and the following perpendicular
streets from East Cesar Chavez Boulevard one-and-a-half to two-and-a-half blocks
northward to the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center: Water Street, Matagorda
Street, and Indianola Street. Several other streets to be added are not on the pre1968 grid, or are offset from it slightly: the northeast and northwest segments (total
length = 270 ft) of a drop-off loop at the northwest corner of the Goliad StreetâNorth
Water Street intersection (no previous street here); a 670-ft-long east-southeasttrending dogleg off the north end of Indianola Street (labeled North Street in the
Master Plan; no previous street here); a 940-ft-long street (labeled South Street in
the Master Plan) running southeastward from Indianola Street to the east edge

of the project area (partly aligns with pre-1968 South Street but is slightly more
east-west); a 910-ft-long street (labeled Montana Street in the Master Plan) running
two-and-a-half blocks northeastward from Goliad Street east of Indianola Street
(partly aligns with pre-1968 Newton Street but is slightly more north-south); and
a 520-ft-long street (labeled Newton Street in the Master Plan) running two blocks
northeastward from East Cesar Chavez Boulevard east of new Montana Street
(partly aligns with Santa Clara Street but is slightly more north-south).
Among the proposed parks and open spaces were the following: (1) an 11.6acre civic park and plaza where the western part of the convention center is today;
(2) a 6.7-acre park and plaza at the Tower of Americas and south to Goliad Street;
(3) a 1.8-acre promenade running west from the tower park and plaza; (4) a 1-acre
gateway transit park and plaza at the east-central edge of the project area; (5) a
0.8-acre childrenâs square and playground in the southwest corner of the project area
(now known as Yanaguana Garden); and (6) three 0.4â1.0-acre neighborhood parks,
two north of East Cesar Chavez Boulevard and one south of it. Reconfiguring current
civic space would focus on the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center. The western
part would be demolished for creation of a civic park and plaza, and the existing
center would be expanded to the east almost all the way to Interstate Highway 37
(this was well under way as of the end of December 2014).
The new development for mixed civic, commercial, and residential uses would
occur on about 35 acres, 30 acres north of East Cesar Chavez Boulevard (mostly
south of the convention center and Tower of the Americas) and 5 acres south of it.
To support the various improvements, five new parking structures were proposed.
Two would be large underground structures, one at the corner of South Alamo
and Market Streets and the other between Goliad Street and East Cesar Chavez
Boulevard from Matagorda Street west beneath Water Street. The other three
would be above-ground structures incorporated into new mixed-use developments
adjoining the existing and new convention center.
The Yanaguana Garden Development Plan
After the master plan was completed, a detailed plan was developed for
Yanaguana Garden (previously referred to as the Childrenâs Square and the
PlayEscape) in the southwest corner of the HemisFair project area, bounded on the
west by South Alamo Street, on the south by East Cesar Chavez Boulevard, on the
north by HemisFair Plaza Way (old Goliad Street and referred to as East Nueva
Street as of the end of 2014), and on the east by an existing parking lot and historic
houses adjacent to the original route of Water Street (Figure 2). This plan directed
all of the archeological investigations reported here.
Central to the proposed development will be a paved, pergola-covered
walkway that will run southwest-northeast between the East Cesar Chavez
Boulevard gateway into the park and Hemisfair Plaza Way (future East Nueva
Street). Paved plazas will be at both ends of the promenade, and at its center will
be a paved play square. These features will divide the project area into quadrants of
unequal size. Much of the southeast quadrant will be devoted to water and sand play

areas and adjacent lawns and planted areas; a small pump house will be associated
with the water play area. Most of the narrow northeast quadrant will be planted
areas or lawn flanking the reconstructed segment of the Acequia Madre, with an
area of playground equipment at its southwest corner. The northwest quadrant will
contain a new restroom facility and a remodeled restroom, an area for playground
equipment, play sculpture, a games porch with concrete play tables (chess, foosball,
and table tennis), and planted areas. The southwest quadrant will be mostly a
multipurpose play lawn adjacent to the South Alamo Street plaza gateway into the
park with some planted areas (called Garden Maze in Figure 2). The total horizontal
Area of Potential Effects (APE) will be 3.3 acres.

Chapter 2: Background Information on
Yanaguana Garden

Historical Background
The area of Yanaguana Garden, i.e., the southwest corner of HemisFair Park,
is sometimes referred to as the historic triangle because so many late-nineteenthcentury and early-twentieth-century buildings were preserved there, most in place
but a few moved in or reconstructed, when HemisFair â68 was built. These include
the following: the Acosta-Halff and Kampmann-Halff houses on the south side of
Goliad Street (now East Nueva Street) at the north edge of Yanaguana Garden
and the Amaya, Smith, Solis, and Kusch houses not far to the southeast along that
street; Schultze Store and the Sweeney-Tynan, Schultze, and Halff houses in this
same area on the north side of Goliad Street; the Espinoza and Koehler houses on
the west side of old Water Street at the southeast corner of Yanaguana Garden;
and O.K. Bar, the Pereida house, the Eager house and its associated dependency
and carriage house, and Beethoven Hall on South Alamo Street at the west edge
of Yanaguana Garden (Figure 3). These buildings reflect increased development of
this section of downtown San Antonio after the Civil War, with mostly residential
buildings and some commercial ones on the triangle of land bounded by South
Alamo, Goliad, and Water Streets; the buildings faced these streets, and their lots
backed up to the ditch known as the Acequia Madre.
The Acequia Madre is an important part of the early history of the area.
It supplied water for irrigating agricultural fields and for consumption by people
and livestock to the lower fields (labor de abajo) of Mission San Antonio de Valero,
starting in the 1720s and continuing until 1793, when the mission was secularized
(Fox and Cox 1990:1). The main north-south road connecting Mission Valero (the
Alamo) just north of the project area with Mission Concepcion to the south during
the Spanish colonial period followed todayâs South Alamo Street, and La Bahia
Road (the road to Presidio La Bahia near Goliad) ran southeast from South Alamo
Street following what later would become Goliad Street. Both roads are evident on
early maps of the area.
The area probably continued to be used for agricultural purposes after it was
subdivided for settlement in 1793, and it appears that it was occupied intensively
only after it was subdivided again in the latter decades of the 1800s. Historic maps
attesting to this increase in development include the 1873 and 1886 Augustus
Koch birdâs-eye views of San Antonio (Koch 1873, 1886) and Sanborn maps dating
to 1892, 1896, and 1912 (Sanborn Fire Insurance Company 1892, 1896, 1912). By
1912, all of the lots in the historic triangle had buildings on them, mostly dwellings

and nearby outbuildings but also a few commercial establishments and Beethoven
Hall (German singing-society concert hall) and associated bowling alley (Figure 4).
The Acequia Madre ditch also is evident on these late-nineteenth- and earlytwentieth-century maps, indicating that it endured even after its agricultural function
ceased. It continued to supply water and helped with drainage, but maintenance
difficulties, sanitation problems posed by standing water, and construction of new
city water works (1878) and sewer (1890s) systems eventually led to abandonment
of the ditch (Cox 2005:60, 67). In 1905, the city concluded that the Acequia Madre
should be filled (Cox 2005:69â70), although both map and archeological evidence
indicate that the section of it in the Yanaguana Garden project area remained open
for some time after this.
Over the first half of the twentieth century, the character of this part of
downtown San Antonio changed. Fewer houses were occupied by owners, and
properties became run down, making the area ripe for redevelopment and urban
renewal (Fox and Cox 1990:1). This led to choice of the site for HemisFair â68,
construction of which started in 1966.
Known Sites and Previous Archeological
Investigations
Prior to the work reported here, there were three recorded archeological
sites within the Yanaguana Garden project area: 41BX8 (Acequia Madre), 41BX982
(Heubaum house foundation), and 41BX588 (relocated historic carriage house behind
the Eager House). Seven other sites are immediately adjacent (Figure 5). Six of
these are historic houses: 41BX585 (Acosta-Halff house), 41BX586 (KampmannHalff house), 41BX587 (Eager house), 41BX591 (Pereida house), 41BX592 (Koehler
house), and 41BX593 (Espinoza house). And one, 41BX584, is historic Beethoven
Hall. Only 41BX8 and 41BX982 have been investigated archeologically. The other
eight sites were given trinomial designations based solely on the presence of extant
historic buildings.
Site 41BX8 was investigated first in 1966, when Schuetz (1970) exposed and
removed the fill from a 95-ft-long, partially preserved, rock-lined segment of the
Acequia Madre so that it could be integrated into one of the HemisFair â68 pavilions;
this was along the northeast edge of the project area (see Figure 5). This excavation
determined that the rock walls of the acequia, the tops of which were visible at the
surface in places, extended 5.2 ft below the ground surface and that the ditch was
6.3 ft wide. The limestone block walls were 10â14 inches thick, originally consisted
of five courses of stone set in dry sandy mortar, and sat on 0.6 ft of compacted mud,
which rested on caliche; the mud and caliche were interpreted as in situ natural
deposits (Schuetz 1970:4, 5). The rock walls reportedly were not part of the original
ditch construction, but were added in the mid-nineteenth century (Fox and Cox
1990:1). The bottom of the acequia was not lined with rocks. The ditch generally had
three zones of fill. Below âseveral feet of recent fill,â Zone 1 (0.6 ft thick) consisted
of âloose, black soil mixed with artifacts,â and Zone 2 (1 ft thick) was âcharacterized
by gravels, often containing corroded iron objects, and a concentration of turn-of-

the-century artifactsâ (Schuetz 1970:3â4). The excavations yielded a large collection
of ceramic, glass, metal, and other artifacts, almost all of which appeared to date
between the 1890s and 1930s. The only exceptions were 16 Spanish colonial artifacts,
which were found in both Zones 1 and 2 (Schuetz 1970:7â13). Schuetz (1970:7)
concluded that the âirrigation system was kept scrupulously clean during the Spanish
colonial period, and was filled only after the Acequia was closed in the early 1890s.â
In 1983â1984, Fox (1985) dug two trenches in a search for the Acequia Madre
south of the segment documented by Schuetz (see Figure 5). One trench was in the
proposed water play area at Yanaguana Garden. It identified the east rock wall of
the acequia at 2.7 ft below the surface beneath introduced fill and, about 6 ft to the
west, limestone rubble perhaps from the largely destroyed west wall at 3.2 ft. The
ditch contained introduced caliche fill above dark brown clay with artifacts dating
to the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries to a depth of at least 5 ft (Fox
1985:7, 10). The other trench was at the south edge of the Yanaguana Garden project
area near where the East Cesar Chavez Boulevard gateway will be; the acequia was
not positively identified there.
In 1989, Fox and Cox (1990) expanded on Foxâs earlier work by excavating six
trenches to look for the portion of the acequia south of the segment documented by
Schuetz (see Figure 5). All six trenches exposed the filled acequia beneath 1.0â2.5 ft
of introduced fill, with five of them containing the remains of the east wall of the
ditch at 1.1â2.6 ft and one having limestone rubble perhaps marking the location
of the west wall 6.5 ft from east wall (Fox and Cox 1990:4â10). One trench also
exposed two cedar posts probably representing an outbuilding outside the ditch
alignment. Artifacts recovered from the ditch fill all represented early-twentiethcentury household goods (Fox and Cox 1990:10). The five trenches closest to Schuetzâs
excavations were used, along with the results of the 1966 work, to reconstruct the
segment of the acequia that is there today. The other trench was southwest of there.
Site 41BX982, at the southeast corner of the project area, was identified
in 1992 during monitoring by I. Waynne Cox of the excavation of approximately
270 ft of utility trenches that ran along the south side of the Koehler (41BX592)
house and just west of the Koehler and Espinoza (41BX593) houses (see Figure 5). A
limestone foundation about 2 ft high was found at a depth of 1 ft, below introduced
fill, next to the southeast corner of the Koehler house, and apparently enough of
this foundation was exposed to determine that it related to a house that measured
36x28 ft, with porches adding another 6 ft to the front and back. Archival research
identified this as the 1859â1864 Heubaum house, which reportedly was demolished
in 1964. Details of the excavations and findings are scant, though, because they
were never fully written up, with sources on the work limited to the site form at
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory and a description and map reported
by Johnson and Cox (1995:10â11).
Other than the investigations at 41BX8 and 41BX982, only two archeological
studies had been done at Yanaguana Garden prior to the work reported here (see
Figure 5). One, in 1992, consisted of archeological monitoring by Cox of trench
excavation for the installation of buried utilities at three locations around the

Chapter 2: Background Information
Acosta-Halff and Kampmann-Halff houses (41BX585 and 41BX586) at the north
edge of the project area (Johnson and Cox 1995:10â11). In 2008, two trenches were
excavated near the north edge of the project area in connection with the placement
of a condensate line (Feit 2009). No intact archeological remains were found in
either investigation.
Disturbance Factors
At the outset of this project, it was recognized that most or all of Yanaguana
Garden had been disturbed to some extent by demolition and land leveling for
HemisFair â68, construction and subsequent removal of fair buildings, post-fair
construction and landscaping, and placement of a variety of buried utilities. This
was evident from the results of the archeological investigations described above,
which showed ubiquitous disturbance to a depth of 1 ft and common disturbance
to 2â3 ft. It also was documented by analysis during an early stage of the project
of the logs of 24 recent geotechnical boreholes placed throughout HemisFair Park.
Two of these, in the far eastern part of the area near Interstate Highway 37, had
extreme amounts of fill (10 and 13 ft), while 3 others, also in the eastern part, had
no fill. Fill in the other 19, 12 of which were within or near Yanaguana Garden,
ranged from 1.0 to 7.5 ft, averaging 2.7 ft.
The southwest corner of HemisFair Park did not suffer as much dramatic
disturbance from the 1968 fair as did other parts of the park, such as areas impacted
deeply by construction of water features and elevated ramps and large buildings
such as the Tower of the Americas, convention center and theater, Texas Pavilion
(now the Institute of Texan Cultures), U.S. Pavilion (now the JohnÂ H. Wood Federal
Courthouse and Adrian Spears Judicial Training Center), and Mexico Pavilion (now
the Mexican Cultural Institute). But all of the area was cleared and leveled, except
where historic buildings were left in place, and numerous temporary fair buildings
were constructed (Figures 6â8). All or parts of seven buildings, covering 45,110 ft2,
overlapped the project area. All of these were temporary buildings that probably
had concrete slab foundations at or near grade (see Figure 6), but land modification
for their erection, placement of utility lines to serve them, and their removal after
1968 certainly resulted in extensive disturbance.
The Yanaguana Garden construction plans showed numerous buried utilities
crisscrossing the area. These included water lines, storm drains, communications
lines, electrical lines, sewer lines, gas lines, and irrigation lines. As it turned out,
many of these were inaccurately mapped, and many additional unmapped lines were
found during archeological trenching and construction. Many of these lines were
shallow (1 ft or less) and thus were restricted to introduced fill, but others extended
deeply into in situ deposits beneath the fill. Other disturbances obvious prior to
the archeological work included construction of two parking lots (one between the
Eager and Pereida houses and the other behind Beethoven Hall), a large playground
feature, and various landscaping features such as tree wells, sidewalks, and curbs.

Overall Recommendations
The work done under the first four work orders for this contract allowed
four main conclusions to be drawn about the archeological record of the Yanaguana
Garden project area. First, almost all of the area was thoroughly disturbed to a depth
of 2â5 ft or more as a result of filling of the Acequia Madre in the early twentieth
century, demolition of buildings and land leveling in preparation for HemisFair
â68, construction and subsequent demolition of temporary buildings for HemisFair
â68, and landscape modifications made after removal of the temporary buildings.
Second, this pervasive disturbance removed most or all traces of human activities
performed on or near the original ground surface (including any remains relating
to Native American occupation), with the only intact remains being the lower parts
of historic features that extended well below that surface, such as the acequia ditch.
Third, the lower parts of segments of the acequia are preserved in places at depths
of 2â3 ft and more, but these segments are the stone-lined version that dates to
the mid-nineteenth century or later; none of the documented segments contained
intact deposits associated with use during the Spanish colonial era. Fourth, the vast
majority of the archeological remains present relate to use during the latter part

of the nineteenth century and the twentieth century; only a very small number of
earlier Spanish colonialâera artifacts, and no intact features, had been documented,
all in disturbed contexts.
These conclusions and review of the design plans led to two primary
recommendations for treatment of archeological resources during development of
Yanaguana Garden. First, where development would result in impacts extending
deeper than 2â3 ft along the route of the acequia, development of a plan to avoid
impacts or determine appropriate mitigation measures was recommended. Based on
the plans, it appeared that the activities most likely to cause such disturbance were
the following: (1) construction of the water play area, and in particular the splash
pad; (2) removal of three trees in and adjacent to the water play area; (3) removal
of an existing sanitary sewer line; (4) placement of two new sewer lines at depths
of ca. 12 ft; (5) possible lowering of an existing gas line; (6) construction of a new
emergency service drive that would cross the acequia alignment immediately south
of its reconstructed segment; and (7) placement of some of the steel pipes to support
the pergola above the south part of the promenade. Second, development of a plan
to perform archeological monitoring where construction activities would extend

Chapter 2: Background Information
to a depth of more than 2 ft in parts of the project area other than the location of
the acequia alignment was recommended to ensure that other intact deep features
would not be inadvertently destroyed. The specifics of that plan would depend on
the number, size, and spacing of deep impacts and their order in the construction
sequence. The plans were not specific about where such deep impacts could occur,
but likely places included the west-central part where new bathrooms would be
constructed, the part of the water play area outside the acequia corridor, the sand
play area, and the areas of three bioswales (one in the north part and two in the
south) that would serve as drains for water runoff.
Subsequent to presentation of these recommendations, CoSA-TCI, in
consultation with THC, determined that full-time archeological monitoring
of all demolition and construction at Yanaguana Garden was warranted. This
determination led to the sixth work order.

Chapter 3: Work Accomplished

The archeological file search, literature review, and data compilation began
during the 2012 planning project and continued under two subsequent work orders
that are part of the project reported here. These tasks had two primary objectives:
(1) to identify known and as-yet-undiscovered sites that could be, or that could have
once been, in the Yanaguana Garden project area; and (2) to assess the likelihood
that intact portions of such sites are still present, given the amount of disturbance
the area has seen. A variety of sources were consulted to accomplish this, with
the most important ones being the Texas Historical Commissionâs Archeological
Sites Atlas; reports on previous archeological investigations at HemisFair Park;
an 1835 map entitled âSan Antonio and Its Environsâ (Foster et al. 2006); the 1873
and 1886 Augustus Koch birdâs-eye views of San Antonio (Koch 1873, 1886); an
1883 map entitled âMorrison and Fourmyâs Revised Map of City of San Antonio
Texasâ (Gast 1883); an 1889 City of San Antonio map (Olsen 1889); Sanborn maps
dating to 1892, 1896, and 1912 (Sanborn Fire Insurance Company 1892, 1896,
1912); a 1939 aerial photograph (Tobin International, Ltd. 1939); the 1953 San
Antonio East USGS quadrangle; maps of pre-HemisFair buildings presented by
Dupont et al. (2011) in the UTSA Center for Cultural Sustainabilityâs inventory
of historic resources at HemisFair Park; maps showing the locations of HemisFair
â68 temporary buildings; photographs taken during construction of HemisFair â68
obtained from the University of North Texas Libraries, Portal to Texas History;
reports on recent geotechnical investigations at HemisFair Park; and the Yanaguana
Garden construction plans.
Fieldwork at Yanaguana Garden was conducted under four work orders,
starting on May 1 and ending on December 24, 2014. These are described below.
Work Order 37-2014-04-24
This first work order consisted of one day of archeological trenching by two
archeologists where a new storm drain was planned (May 1), followed by a half day
of monitoring by one archeologist of excavation for placement of an adjacent storm
drain junction box (June 11), at the location of a new emergency service drive. This
was at the far north edge of the project area, immediately north and west of the
Acosta-Halff house (41BX585; Figure 9). Archeological attention to the storm drain
component of this project was considered warranted because this was the only area
that would see deep disturbance.

Chapter 3: Work Accomplished
The single trench excavated before construction began was 12 m (39 ft) long
and typically was 1.5 m (5 ft) deep. No archeological features were observed. The
full length of the trench contained disturbed construction fill (rock and concrete
rubble, as well as finer-grained deposits) to depths of 0.6â1.5 m (2â5 ft) below the
surface. Beneath the construction fill in parts of the trench were in situ A and B soil
horizons on Cretaceous-age bedrock. A few historic-age artifacts (a transferware
ceramic sherd, a patinated bottle glass neck, and a horseshoe) were observed within
the disturbed fill, but they clearly did not represent in situ archeological deposits.
The storm drain junction box excavation that was monitored measured 6.2 m (20 ft)
northeast-southwest by 1.7â3.4 m (6â11 ft) northwest-southeast; it overlapped the
north end of the archeological trench and extended a short distance northeast of
it. It went to a depth of ca. 2.1 m (7 ft), encountering an existing storm drain at
1.2â1.8 m (4â6 ft). The walls of this excavation showed 0.5â0.9 m (1.5â3.0 ft) of
brown fine-grained and coarse rubble fill over in situ sediments. The lower part of
the fill zone in the southeast wall had numerous jumbled yellow bricks like those
used in the Acosta-Halff House just to the south, suggesting that debris from house
construction had been placed here. No other historic materials and no historic
features were observed.
Work Order 39-2014-07-24
Monitoring was done over two-and-a-half days (September 29â30 and
October 2) in connection with removal of contaminated soils in two areas (see
Figure 9). One (AOC-1) was a 65x10-ft area beneath the parking lot south of the
Eager House and Dependency (41BX587), and the other (AOC-2) was a 7x7-ft area
immediately east of the north end of the reconstructed segment of the Acequia
Madre (41BX8). Sediments were removed to depths of 2.5 ft in AOC-1 and 5 ft in
AOC-2. An archeologist observed excavation of these areas by a mini-excavator
and placement of the materials removed in the bucket of a skid-steer loader for
transport to a roll-off box.
The AOC-1 excavation encountered, in addition to numerous buried utility
lines, 1.0â1.5 ft of asphalt and gravelly construction base material across the full
area. Below this to 2.5 ft in the southern third of the AOC was construction debris
consisting of gravels, concrete chunks, rebar, and churned natural black clayey
sediments. The northern third contained mostly filled utility trenches with some
areas of churned natural black clay. In the middle third of the AOC, black clay
directly underlay the asphalt and gravelly parking lot base, but modern debris
within it, including large concrete chunks in the bottom of the excavation, indicated
that these natural sediments had been thoroughly disturbed, probably during land
leveling for construction of HemisFair â68 and later during removal of HemisFair
â68 temporary buildings and parking lot construction. Materials observed in the
excavation, in addition to abundant concrete and rebar, included lumber, displaced
wood posts, asphalt shingles, machine-made bricks, sewer pipe, ceramic tiles, glass,
metal, stove pipe flashing, angle iron, galvanized metal pipe, iron pipe, plastic, and
cloth fabric. A single diagnostic bottle was observed; it was a clear glass Sanfordâs
ink bottle manufactured in 1939.

24

Archeological Investigations at Yanaguana Garden
The AOC-2 excavation was 2.5â3.5 ft east of the north end of the reconstructed
Acequia Madre wall. The general stratigraphy consisted of the following: 0â8 inches,
landscape fill; 8â24/34 inches, gravelly fill with sandstone chunks, with the bottom
sloping down to the west toward the acequia; 24/34â36/48 inches, black clay with
limestone and gravel inclusions (churned natural sediment); 36/48â55 inches, black
clay without obvious limestone and gravel inclusions (in situ natural sediment?);
55â60+ inches, limestone bedrock. Hence, this area had 2â3 ft of fill over ca. 1 ft
of disturbed natural sediments. No archeological features were observed. Artifacts
noted included shaped limestone blocks (maybe from original acequia construction
and 1968 reconstruction), animal bones, a metal spike, other metal, glass (clear,
amber, green, and aquamarine), plastic, and concrete rubble. Some of the glass was
patinated and could date to the late-nineteenth or early-twentieth century but was
not otherwise distinctive. These materials were consistent with the kinds of remains
that Schuetz (1970) found in excavating the acequia nearby, which largely reflected
1890sâ1930s trash disposal.
Work Order 43-2014-08-04
Two archeologists performed archeological trenching in the south part of the
project area over two-and-a-half days (August 20â22) to determine if intact portions
of the Acequia Madre (41BX8) are present there. The area investigated extended
for a distance of about 60 m (200 ft), starting ca. 20 m (66 ft) southwest of the end
of the reconstructed segment of the acequia and ending just north of East Cesar
Chavez Boulevard (see Figure 9). The four trenches excavated were (PAI 1â4) 22,
48, 60, and 79 m (72, 157, 197, and 259 ft) southwest of the end of the reconstructed
segment of the acequia. They were 5.4â5.8 m (17.7â19.0 ft) long, 1.0â2.0 m (3â6 ft)
wide, and 1.8â2.5 m (5.9â8.2 ft) deep. All four were oriented northwest-southeast,
perpendicular to the route of the acequia.
Details on what was found are included below under Results of Archeological
Investigations; the paragraphs here present a summary. Two of the four trenches
(PAI-1 and PAI-4) found preserved segments of the rock wall that was built in the
mid 1800s to line the east wall of the acequia (Fox and Cox 1990:1). In both cases,
the top of what is left of the wall was 0.9â1.0 m (3.0â3.3 ft) below the modern
surface, with the overlying deposits consisting of disturbed fill. Hence, it appears
that the preserved segments are the basal portions of the original wall, with the
upper 0.9â1.0 m (3.0â3.3 ft) having been removed during land clearing, building
construction, and building demolition before, during, and after HemisFair â68. A third
trench (PAI-3) found what may be the very bottom of the acequia ditch but no intact
rock walls. Schuetzâs (1970) excavations to the north showed that the acequia was
1.9 m (6.2 ft) wide, but no traces of the west wall were found in the current project
area, which is consistent with the scant evidence for a west wall in the excavations
done in this area by Fox (1985) and Fox and Cox (1990). According to Fox and Cox
(1990:22), a 1915 map noting âno well defined ditch lineâ where the west wall would
have been suggests that it had been removed by that time.
Schuetzâs (1970) excavations showed that the acequia ditch extended 1.6 m
(5.2 ft) below the surface, and Trenches PAI-1 and PAI-4 encountered ditch fill

Chapter 3: Work Accomplished
extending to the same depth in those locations. Possible ditch fill extended deeper
(6.6 ft) in Trench PAI-3, suggesting more modern fill there than elsewhere. None of
the trenches found anything that could be related to the 1720sâmid-1800s version
of the acequia that existed before it was lined with rock walls, and it is possible
that most or all traces of that ditch were obliterated when the walls were built.
Likewise, no artifacts associated with early use of the feature were found; all
materials observed related to trash discard and intentional ditch filling in the latenineteenth and earlyâmid-twentieth centuries, or to more-recent accumulations of
debris relating to construction and demolition of HemisFair â68 buildings.
Work Order 46-2014-10-06
A single archeologist performed archeological construction monitoring on
46 work days, starting on October 13 and ending on December 24 (Table 2). The
archeologist was present whenever ground-disturbing activities occurred, and
frequently when no such activities were under way. Multiple contractors performed
the various jobs associated with removal of old improvements and preparation for
installation of new ones, employing various pieces of large equipment for demolition,
loading, hauling, excavating, and trenching. The archeologist remained nearby when
subsurface impacts occurred, taking photographs and notes to record the nature of
the subsurface deposits as they were revealed. In addition, whenever construction
crew members noticed potential archeological remains, they notified the archeologist,
who then examined and evaluated them.
Monitoring was done of various activities that resulted in both shallow and
deep subsurface impacts. Shallow impacts are defined as those that reached no
more than ca. 2 ft deep and typically were confined to the introduced caliche base
or construction fill that is common to nearly all of the project area. Deep subsurface
impacts are those that reached beyond 2 ft, usually extending through the layers of
introduced fill into in situ sediments and sometimes the underlying Austin Chalk
bedrock. The deepest impacts reached 13 ft below the ground surface. Many activities,
with both shallow and deep impacts, occurred multiple times throughout the course
of monitoring, with multiple disturbances often occurring on any given day.
Monitoring of Shallow Impacts
Shallow subsurface impacts were frequent and pervasive across the project
area (and hence their locations are not shown on Figure 9). Discussed here are some
of the more-common examples.
Playscape and Gazebo Demolition: The former playscape and gazebo were
demolished early in the project (Figure 10a). Much of the work occurred above
ground and required little monitoring; however, monitoring did occur when corner
posts and uprights were removed from the ground. Some of these posts extended
beyond 2 ft deep, but they were confined to introduced fill nonetheless.
Masonry Wall Demolition: Masonry walls enclosed multiple areas around
the park. Each of these walls had to be removed and was knocked over using a large

excavator (Figure 10b). The footings left behind were removed as well, resulting in
1â2 ft of fill being disturbed.
Brick Paver Removal: The many walkways throughout the park were built
of brick pavers. Pavers were laid in an interlocking pattern between concrete curbs.
Each brick measured 3 inches thick and sat upon a layer of leveling sand. These
impacts were very shallow, generally no deeper than 0.5 ft. Bricks were removed
using a small excavator and Bobcat.
Concrete Curb Removal: Hundreds of linear feet of concrete curbs snaked
throughout the park (see Figure 10b). Curbs typically reached ca. 1.5 ft deep and
were removed using the excavator. A narrow bucket with teeth was used to pull out
cut segments of curbs.

Chapter 3: Work Accomplished
Shrub Removal: Many small shrubs throughout the park had to be removed,
and this was accomplished using an excavator and backhoe. Many of the root systems
did not reach beyond 1 ft deep and were easily pulled out with the machine.
Pavement Removal: Using Bobcats, a backhoe, and an excavator, the parking
lot between the Eager and Pereida houses was peeled away (Figure 11a). The
pavement measured ca. 3â4 inches thick and sat on top of a layer of caliche base.
Restroom Building and Foundation Demolition: The former womenâs restroom
within the park was demolished using a large excavator. There were no subsurface
impacts as the building was destroyed, but the 2-ft-thick concrete foundation had
to be broken up with a jackhammer and removed by machine.
Site Grading: Site grading was accomplished by using a team of Bobcats to
cut away the upper few inches of introduced fill to bring the ground surface to its new
elevation (Figure 11b; Figure 12). Impacts from grading were typically less than 1 ft.
Irrigation Sleeve Trenching: Irrigation sleeves (PVC pipes 4â6 inches in
diameter) were laid in the ground to encase irrigation lines where they will pass
under roadways and sidewalks. These trenches were excavated using a Ditch Witch
trencher and went to depths of ca. 1.5 ft.
Monitoring of Deep Impacts
Deep subsurface impacts were less pervasive but often occurred on a larger
scale and removed hundreds of cubic yards of material. The primary deep impacts
are listed below, and the locations of the more-prominent ones are shown on Figure 9.
Tree Removal: Twenty-three trees were selected for removal within
Yanaguana Garden. They ranged in size from small crepe myrtles ca. 5 inches in
diameter up to a large pecan tree 34 inches in diameter. These trees were removed
by an excavator, which toppled the trees once the large branches were removed.
In most instances, impacts from removing a treeâs root ball reached between 3 and
6 ft deep and were 3â8 ft in diameter. In all cases, removing the root ball disturbed
the ground to the extent that no informative subsurface profiles could be observed
or recorded.
Light Pole Base Removal: Large light poles scattered throughout the park
were removed. The cast-iron poles were easily dismantled, leaving behind 1.5-ftdiameter concrete bases that reached 3â5 ft below the surface. These concrete
columns were removed using an excavator, sometimes leaving a perfectly circular
hole, except where additional excavation was needed to extract the base. In general,
the resulting holes did not provide informative subsurface profiles because they
were too small or too disturbed by machinery in the excavation process.
Utility Potholing: Potholing was conducted to try and find some of the many
unmarked buried utility lines throughout the project area. A vacuum truck and
attached high-pressure blower hose were used to excavate and remove sediments
to depths of 4â12 ft in a few areas. The holes were too small in diameter to allow
observing and recording subsurface profiles. On occasion when unmarked utilities

were identified, workers dug by hand or with a Bobcat to expose additional
segments of the utility line. These utilities were close to the surface, often in
introduced fill.
New Restroom Pad Excavation: A new restroom was to be built directly
over the site of the old, demolished restroom, thus limiting impacts to an area
that had already been disturbed. A large pit measuring 45x45 ft and 4 ft deep was
excavated so that it could be packed with caliche base and serve as the pad for the
new foundation (Figure 13). This pit was dug by an excavator and a team of Bobcats.
One unexpected feature encountered was a large concrete pier measuring at least
10â12 ft tall and 1â2 ft in diameter with a bell-shaped base measuring 2â7 ft across
(Figure 14). At least five other such large piers were unearthed during monitoring:
one just southeast of the new restroom, one at the manhole pit within the former
parking lot, and three during bore pit and sewer line excavation in the southern
portion of the project area. It is unclear what these massive concrete columns were
associated with, but they probably related to HemisFair â68 construction; four of
them were beneath or adjacent to temporary HemisFair â68 buildings.

Figure 13

Chapter 3: Work Accomplished

Figure 13. View to the northeast of Bobcats excavating 4-ft-deep new restroom pad.

Bioswale Pit Excavation: Three large bioswale pits were excavated, one in
the north part of the project area and two nearby in the south part (Figure 15a).
The north pit measured ca. 25 ft long by 10 ft wide, and the two south pits were
similar in size measuring ca. 25 ft long by 8â10 ft wide. Each pit was excavated to
a depth of 4â5 ft below the surface. A large excavator and team of Bobcats were
used to accomplish the task.
Sanitary Sewer Trench Excavation: The deepest and most extensive impacts
monitored occurred in connection with trenching for new sanitary sewer lines.
Approximately 575 linear feet of new sanitary sewer lines were planned for the
project. At the completion of our monitoring, about 25 percent of these trenches had
been dug. Trenches were excavated using a large excavator to set the pipes. Sewer
line trenches measured ca. 4 ft wide and 12â14 ft deep. One segment monitored
was partially within the old parking lot and south and east of the new restroom
building, while other segments were in the southern portion of the project area.
Accompanying the sewer line trenching was excavation of two manhole pits using
a large excavator. These manholes serve as access points along the sanitary sewer
system. Each pit measured ca. 8x8 ft and reached depths of 12â13 ft.

35

36

Archeological Investigations at Yanaguana Garden
Two segments of planned sanitary sewer lines in the southern portion of the
project area intersected the alignment of the Acequia Madre. Although trenching had
determined that most of the acequia in this area had been disturbed or destroyed,
CoSA decided that the lines should be bored beneath the alignment to ensure that
no remaining traces of the acequia would be impacted. This necessitated excavating
two large pits (12x25 ft and 8 ft deep) with a large excavator to accommodate a
Ditch Witch machine (Figure 15b). This machine then bored two 30-inch-diameter
holes so that 24-inch iron casings could be placed to house the 8-inch sewer pipes
(Figure 16; only one of these casings was installed during our monitoring). An 8x8-ft
welding pit was dug in one location so that the bored head could be retrieved and
to allow the casing to be welded in place.

Chapter 4: Results of Archeological
Investigations

Introduced fill is ubiquitous across the project area, and much of the
monitoring was for activities that impacted only this fill. Modern construction debris
and rubble, such as brick and concrete fragments and rebar, and modern trash in
the form of plastic cups, bags, and glass bottles were observed frequently in this fill.
On occasion, nonmodern artifacts were observed, but only where impacts reached
beneath the fill layers. These consisted of items like glass bottle fragments, ceramic
sherds, nails, animal bones, ceramic sewer pipe fragments, bricks, and rusted metal.
Except for a few rare instances (see 41BX8 and 41BX2068 below), these artifacts were
in disturbed contexts and likely represent a general trash scatter relating to latenineteenth- and early-to-mid-twentieth-century occupation of the area; undoubtedly,
these materials had been displaced by the multiple episodes of earthmoving before
and after HemisFair â68. The only substantive archeological results came from
trenching in search of the Acequia Madre (41BX8) and excavation of a nineteenthcentury trash pit (41BX2068) identified during monitoring.
Overall Stratigraphy
The deeper subsurface profiles traced the history of modification of this
corner of HemisFair Park. Table 3 summarizes the more-informative of these profiles,
including their locations, the stratigraphy observed (including depth of disturbance),
and archeological remains observed. Figure 9 shows the locations of these profiles.
As the background research revealed, the area has seen extensive, and in
some areas quite deep, disturbance. All 15 of the profiles listed in Table 3 contain
introduced fill in their upper parts, ranging in thickness from 1.0 to 5.9 ft and
averaging 2â4 ft. This fill varies from sediment and mulch used in landscaping, to
caliche and gravel base material, to construction debris (concrete, rebar, etc.) mixed
with dark clayey sediments (Figures 17 and 18). It contains many buried utility
lines. Common modern artifacts and occasional historic artifacts were observed in
this fill, with the latter always being out of context.
Below the fill in almost all of the profiles are natural clayey sediments
classified as Houston Black clay, which are upland soils that are dark gray to black
and calcareous, often reaching 3â4 ft deep (Taylor et al. 1991:18â19). In many profiles,
these sediments have been disturbed by numerous buried utilities and the addition
of construction debris. This undoubtedly reflects the many episodes of earthmoving
and landscape modification associated mostly with HemisFair â68 construction and
demolition. In some cases, disturbance is limited to the upper part of the profile,

but in others none of the remaining sediments are in situ. In some profiles, natural
Austin Chalk deposits, the parent material in which Houston Black clay forms, were
exposed at the bottom of the excavations. The only intact archeological remains
found during the project were intrusive into Houston Black clay or Austin Chalk
where they had not been disturbed by modern construction.
One important thing that Table 3 and the discussion above do not capture
is the fact that there are areas immediately adjacent to the project, namely the
environs of the various historic buildings that face onto South Alamo Street and the
former courses of Goliad and Water Streets, that have escaped extensive disturbance.
Although some minor leveling and filling may have been done when these houses
were built, the lands next to them are at grade with the natural late-nineteenthcentury ground surface (based on their positions relative to the buildings). Given

Figure 17. View to the north of the trench dug to remove contaminated soils beneath the parking lot between
the Eager and Pereida houses showing subsurface stratigraphy. Parking lot pavement rests on introduced gravel
base material (1.0â1.5 ft thick). Below that to 2.5 ft is natural Houston Black clay, which has been disturbed
through the addition of construction debris (note obvious concrete rubble and rebar in foreground floor of
trench). Conduits for electric lines protrude from the left trench wall in the foreground, and a PVC sewer line
and conduits for electric lines cross the far end of the trench.

the absence of topographic breaks between these areas and Yanaguana Garden, this
indicates that the fill that is so prevalent across the project area was not deposited
atop an unmodified natural surface (i.e., the historic houses are not in âbowlsâ
surrounded by higher areas of mounded fill). Instead, it appears that the project
area saw repeated episodes of truncation of the surface and reworking of existing
and introduced sediments to create a new surface that approximated the natural
late-nineteenth-century one.
How many times this occurred is uncertain, but three major episodes can
be projected. The first was when the Acequia Madre (principally the west wall) was
demolished, perhaps early in the twentieth century. The second was in the mid 1960s
when HemisFair â68 was built. And the third was at various times after 1968 when
the HemisFair â68 temporary buildings were demolished and removed and modern
improvements were put in place.

Figure 18. View to the southeast of intersecting sewer line bore pit and Bioswale Pit 3 showing subsurface
stratigraphy (rear of the Koehler house is visible behind the excavations). The larger sewer line bore pit was
a maximum of 8 ft deep; it transected the shallower (5 ft) Bioswale Pit 3, the remnant of which is visible on
the far side of the bore pit. At the left end of the bore pit, 1.5â2.0 ft of introduced fill (brown sediment above
gravelly base material) overlies natural Houston Black clay, which has been churned by placement of a sewer
line (manhole cover is visible just left of the pit at lath with orange flagging) and other buried utilities. Austin
Chalk bedrock was encountered at a depth of about 7 ft. Moving right toward Bioswale Pit 3 and in the far
wall of that excavation, mixed introduced fill thickens to 4.5â5.0 ft before thinning to 2.0â2.5 ft.

Site 41BX8, Acequia Madre
Four trenches were excavated to search for intact segments of the Acequia
Madre before construction began, and evidence for the acequia were found in two
or three of them. In the northeasternmost trench (PAI-1), a line of shaped limestone
blocks 0.5 ft thick that appeared to be the bottom of the east wall of the acequia
was found at a depth of 2.6â2.8 ft (Figure 19). Three stacked rocks that lined up
with the rocks in the trench bottom were visible in the south wall, starting at 3.0 ft
below the surface. There were no rocks indicating the west acequia wall. Obvious
introduced fill (brown clay loam above reddish yellow gravelly clay loam visible in
Figure 19) was present to a depth of about 2.3 ft east of the wall remnant, above
dark in situ sediment. Just west of the line of limestone blocks, clearly introduced
fill (including a thick zone of white caliche containing construction rubble visible

Chapter 4: Results of Archeological Investigations
on the left and right sides of Figure 19) was present to a depth of 4.3 ft. Below that
was 1.1 ft of dark clayey sediment with abundant artifacts (glass, ceramics, metal);
this sat on caliche bedrock at 5.4 ft and appeared to be dirt used to intentionally
fill the ditch in the early 1900s.
Figure19

Figure 19. View to the southeast of the west face of the acequia wall segment in Trench PAI-1. The rock to the
right of the meter-long photo scale and the two lower ones to the left of it are the intact vertical wall segment.
The upper rock on the left is displaced from the wall.

The second trench (PAI-2) exposed thick twentieth-century fill and did not
find any acequia walls. It was not recorded in detail because a broken water line
caused the trench to partially fill with water, but the stratigraphy consisted of
disturbed fill down to about 5.2 ft over the full length of the trench, with possible
caliche bedrock below that to at least 8.2 ft.
The third trench (PAI-3) had three horizontal layers of introduced modern
fill to a depth of 4.6 ft along its full length (Figure 20). Below that were two zones of
probable acequia ditch fill at 4.6â6.6 ft inset into in situ dark sediments on the east
side (at 4.6 ft) and what appeared to be caliche bedrock on the west side (at 5.2 ft).
The upper zone of ditch fill (4.6â5.2 ft) clearly was cultural, as it contained historic

trash such as metal and glass; it appeared as a lens about 6 ft long. The lower zone
lacked artifacts but looked like redeposited natural sediments; at its east edge at
the bottom of the trench were several limestone rocks that could be the remnant of
the east acequia wall, although they did not look like intact courses of rocks.
Figure 20

Figure 20. View to the northeast of the north wall of Trench PAI-3. The lower part of the meter-long photo
scale is in front of probable lower acequia ditch inset into in situ black clayey sediment to the right and caliche
bedrock to the left. The upper part of the photo scale is in front of the lowermost of three zones of introduced fill.

The fourth trench (PAI-4) exposed a segment of intact lower east wall of the
acequia (Figure 21). The wall was 1.3 ft thick, and the top of the intact segment
was 3.0â3.3 ft below the surface. The west face of the wall was not fully exposed,
but the southernmost rock that was exposed extended about 2 ft vertically. Probing
suggested that there are no more rocks beneath it, so what remains likely is the
lowermost course of rocks. The backhoe removed abundant limestone rubble probably
representing displaced pieces of the west wall and the upper east wall. This was
especially evident in the south wall of the trench, where rubble was common for
a distance of 4.9 ft west of the intact wall segment at depths of 1.0â4.3 ft. Two of
the more-intact rubble pieces were from large shaped blocks that were 1.6â2.0 ft
across. The north wall of the trench showed two horizontal zones of fill to a depth of
1.3â1.6 ft, a wedge of caliche fill above and flanking the acequia wall to a maximum
depth of about 3.3 ft, a zone of dark gray clayey fill to a depth of about 5.2 ft where
the acequia ditch likely was, and probable caliche bedrock below 5.2 ft. The dark gray

Chapter 4: Results of Archeological Investigations
clay contained rock rubble and scattered artifacts throughout, but it had a distinct
lens of historic trash (bricks, glass, wire, other metal, etc.) at depths of 3.3â3.6 ft for
a distance of ca. 3.6 ft just west of the intact wall segment. As in the other trenches,
the dark gray clayey sediments appeared to be mostly natural deposits that were
moved around when the west wall of the acequia was taken out and the area filled
and leveled (pre-HemisFair â68) and when the area was leveled again in association
with HemisFair â68.
Figure 21

Figure 21. View to the southeast of the west face of the acequia wall segment in Trench PAI-4. Only the rock
on the right is fully exposed. The lower portion of the rock on the left (middle of the trench) is obscured by ditch
fill. Introduced fill above the vertical rocks is obvious in both trench walls.

Historic and modern artifacts were observed in all four trenches. These
mostly consisted of nondiagnostic pieces of glass, metal (e.g., nails, rebar, possible
furniture hardware, and flat can fragments or sheet metal), whiteware, stoneware,
machine-made bricks, butchered animal bones, ceramic tiles, sewer pipes, and plastic.
The more-diagnostic items, found in Trenches PAI-1, PAI-2, and PAI-3, consisted of
the following: an annular-decorated ceramic sherd (probably dating ca. 1840â1900);
and eight bottles with hand-tooled finishes and mold seams obliterated over the
mouth and lip (predating 1903). The latter consist of a small cobalt blue glass bottle;
a green wine bottle neck and mouth; two brown beer bottle necks; a clear medicine

45

bottle neck and mouth; a large opaque bottle mouth similar to a large milk bottle; a
clear glass medicine bottle with an embossed label that reads âAlamo Drug Store, A.
Driess, San Antonio, Tex.â; and a very small clear glass bottle embossed with âAyerâs
Pills, Lowell, Mass.â, which likely dates to ca. 1853â1870.
During construction, two additional trenches (PAI-5 and PAI-6) were
excavated across the alignment of the acequia where two new storm sewer lines
would intersect it. Trench PAI-5 was 9 ft long, 2 ft wide, and 6 ft deep, and Trench
PAI-6 was 12 ft long, 3 ft wide, and 6 ft deep. No evidence of rock walls or the
acequia ditch was found, and few artifacts were observed in what was clearly
mixed twentieth-century fill. Materials included whiteware fragments, glass bottle
fragments, and a single corroded axe head, along with large pieces of concrete rubble,
rebar, and plastic, including a Bill Miller BBQ cup at 5 ft below the ground surface.
These trenches, between Trenches PAI-2 and PAI-3, supported the conclusion reached
during initial trenching that the acequia in this area had been heavily disturbed
or destroyed.
Site 41BX8 is a Registered Texas Historic Landmark that is listed in the
Historic American Engineering Record and that is shown as eligible for listing
in the National Register of Historic Places in the Texas Historical Commissionâs
Archeological Sites Database. The investigations reported here support this
eligibility assessment, as well as the conclusion that the site warrants designation
as a State Antiquities Landmark.
Site 41BX2068, Trash Pit
Investigation and Description
While trenching along a new sewer line route in the very southern portion
of the project area, a basin-shaped pit containing historic artifacts was encountered
and subsequently excavated; this feature was given the trinomial designation
41BX2068 (see Figure 9). Caliche base fill at this location was 2.5 ft thick, and the
feature was identified in the south wall of the trench at the contact between the fill
and the underlying in situ black clayey sediments (Figure 22). Numerous animal
bones and ceramic and glass sherds were observed in this profile, along with two
main ash lenses. Based on this profile, the pit appeared to be ca. 4.5 ft in diameter
and to extend ca. 2.9 ft below the contact between caliche fill and in situ sediments.
Its full original vertical extent is unknown, since the original ground surface had
been truncated, but it likely was no more than 5.4 ft given the thickness of the fill
above it.
A strategy for investigating this feature was developed in consultation with
CoSAâs City Archaeologist. It consisted of mechanically removing the introduced
fill above the feature in the south wall of the trench and manually excavating a
1x1-m unit in the west part of the feature below that. The unit was excavated to
a depth of 1.3 ft, at which point the western and southern pit margins became
obvious; below that, only the pit fill was excavated to a maximum depth of 2.6 ft.
The portion of the pit exposed in this excavation measured 3.0 ft north-south by
2.8 ft east-west. This left perhaps as much as 1.7 ft of unexcavated pit to the east,

judging from the original profile. Although the original profile indicated that the
pit contained multiple lenses of fill, the excavation was done as a single vertical
provenience rather than in levels; this was done because time for excavation was
limited and there were no obvious differences in the content of the fill lenses in the
pit profile. Another concession to the time shortage was that the clayey pit fill was
not screened; the fact that artifacts were very abundant and easily removable by
hand as the fill was troweled through also contributed to this decision.
Excavation of the 1x1-m unit, and its east wall profile showing the remaining
unexcavated part of the feature (Figure 23), confirmed that the pit contained layers
of household refuse, with several artifact layers capped by layers of wood ash and
charcoal perhaps from fireplace cleaning. Because the pit was full of broken everyday
household items such as glass food and drink bottles, ceramic drink bottles, ceramic
dinnerware, drinking glasses, and animal bones, it is clear that this is a domestic
refuse assemblage. Supporting this interpretation is the location of the pit along the
back of an old city lot just 12â15 ft east of the Alamo Acequia (see Archival Research
below). Trash was likely discarded some distance from the house (which faced onto
Water Street to the east) to prevent foul smells and keep scavenging animals at
bay. There is no way of knowing for certain if the pit was intentionally dug to serve
Figure
23 that it was, based on the absence of
as a trash receptacle, but a case is made
below
other better interpretations of the pitâs function.

charcoal-rich ashy fill are sandwiched between layers of artifact-rich dark clayey fill.

Chapter 4: Results of Archeological Investigations
Materials Recovered
Excavation of the pit feature resulted in a collection consisting of 1,369
artifacts. In describing these materials, the functional classification system used by
Boyd et al. (2015) is followed. It organizes artifacts based on their function and use
rather than their physical attributes. Artifact categories represented are kitchen/
household artifacts, clothing-related items, architectural artifacts, personal items,
activities-related artifacts, faunal remains, lithics, and unidentifiable artifacts.
Kitchen/Household artifacts
Food Storage and Preparation
The artifacts most representative of this category are the many stoneware
ginger beer bottles. Twenty-seven bottles can be identified using the bottle necks/
mouths as indicators of individual specimens. There are two types of bottles. One
is a Bristol-glazed stoneware with brown slip, and the other is a green, alkalineglazed stoneware. Twenty-two bottles are Bristol glazed, and two bottle types
are present: rounded shoulders with rounded body, and cylindrical body with an
abrupt break at the shoulders. Bristol is a smooth white glaze that originated
in Bristol, England, and became a popular treatment for stoneware during the
Victorian period as the publicâs interest in health and sanitation grew, with white
being a sign of cleanliness (Greer 1981:210). Prior to 1920, this glazing technique
was used in combination with a brown slip on the upper portions of vessels and
was purely decorative (Greer 1981:212). The 22 Bristol-glazed bottles display
this two-toned pattern. Only 1 bottle could be completely reconstructed, and it
measures 7.25 inches tall and 2.875 inches in diameter at the base (Figure 24a).
The approximate volume of this vessel is 20 fluid ounces. The manufacturer
marking of Powell Bristol is stamped on its side at the base. William Powell
invented the popular Bristol glaze in 1835, and his pottery manufactured ceramics
with the impressed mark of Powell Bristol until it was sold to Price, Sons & Co
in 1906 (Godden 1991:509). Therefore, this bottle dates between 1835 and 1906.
Another bottle contains a single âWâ marking on its side at the bottom, but the
manufacturer remains unknown. In addition to the 22 bottles, 59 Bristol-glazed
fragments were recovered.
The other five ginger beer bottles are green, alkaline-glazed stoneware. The
one that could be reconstructed bears the label âCopelandâs Celebrated Ginger Popâ
stamped into the surface (Figure 24b). It measures 7.5 inches tall and 3 inches
in diameter at the base and is slightly flared at the shoulders. The approximate
volume is 24â28 fluid ounces. Stamped label fragments on sherds not belonging
to this reconstructed bottle indicate that at least four other Copelandâs bottles are
represented. No information could be found regarding this product. In addition to
the 5 bottles, 22 fragments from Copelandâs bottles were recovered.
A single stoneware mineral water bottle was recovered. It could not be
reconstructed, nor does it have a makerâs mark. It consists of two fragments, the
base and the mouth.

Chapter 4: Results of Archeological Investigations
Another artifact in this category is a partially reconstructed clear glass
bottle base of Lea & Perrins Worcestershire sauce. The small glass stopper was also
recovered. Only the bottom half of the bottle remains, and the embossed letters of
Lea & Perrins are still visible. The stopper is also labeled the same. Both pieces
show heavy patina and no obvious markings that allow this bottle to be dated.
Food Service and Consumption
This category of household artifacts is dominated by whiteware sherds.
Several different varieties of dinnerware, as well as different makers, are represented
in the collection. At least 18 individual whiteware vessels were identified, consisting
of 6 saucers, 5 cups, 4 plates, 1 bowl, 1 plate/saucer, and 1 pitcher. Each of these
vessels was partially reconstructed. In addition to the vessels, 118 fragments of
whiteware were recovered.
Eight makersâ marks were observed on the examples of whiteware collected.
Of these, five are identifiable in terms of manufacturer, and three can be confidently
dated. A reconstructed bowl is marked âIronstone / J.Wedgwood / Chinaâ on the base
(Figure 25a); it was manufactured by John Wedge Wood between 1841 and 1860 (not
to be confused with the famed Josiah Wedgwood; Godden 1991:656, 687). A saucer
base bears the impressed mark of âJAMES EDWARDS / DALEHALLâ (Figure 25b);
it was manufactured by James Edwards & Son sometime between 1851 and 1882
(Godden 1991:230, 231). The last datable mark is that of Pinder, Bourne & Co., and
it is found on the base of a whiteware pitcher and the base of a saucer. The design is
printed and consists of an eagle with a shield and banner and labeled âIMPERIALâ
above the eagle and âWHITE GRANITEâ below it (Figure 25c). These ceramics were
manufactured between 1862 and 1882 (Godden 1991:495).
All four of the whiteware plates have marks from William Adams & Sons.
This printed design is an eagle with a shield clutching arrows, something very
American, and labeled âIMPERIALâ above the eagle and âFRENCH PORCELAINâ
below it (Figure 25d). A date of manufacture other than mid-nineteenth century
could not be found. Godden (1991:21) states that this mark may have different
variations and designs, with the name of the individual pattern also included.
Another mark from a single fragment of whiteware was that of W. Baker (Figure
25e). Since other defining attributes of the design are missing, it can only be dated
to the broad timeframe of 1839â1932 (Godden 1991:51).
One fragment of whiteware has the common British Royal Arms mark and
postdates 1837 (Figure 25f). The arms consisted of an oval shield with a lion on the
right and unicorn to the left. In 1837, the shield was divided into four quadrants
(Kovel and Kovel 1986:267). This sherd has no other attributes to allow it to be
dated more precisely. Two other whiteware sherds have nondiagnostic marks. A
plate or saucer fragment has the word âWarrantedâ stamped into the base (Figure
25g). Another sherd has raised letters that are too small to read (Figure 25h).
At least six other decorative ceramic styles and vessels were recovered. One
is a hand-painted teacup with no makerâs mark (Figure 26a). Other fragments are
also from teacups, one with a black stripe around the rim, and the other with a

brown stripe around the rim. A fragment of a teapot lid has thin red and blue lines
as well as a thicker black line around it (Figure 26b). A total of nine annular ware
fragments are present, primarily with light blue and black banding (Figure 26câe).
Annular wares generally date between 1840 and 1900 in the United States (Ramsay
1939:149). Lastly, the only transfer-printed ceramic is a teacup broken into five
pieces. The design is a blue or gray tree/vine pattern, with the word âFibreâ printed
across the bottom indicating the âFibreâ pattern (Figure 26f, g). No manufacturer
could be identified.
Five partially reconstructed clear glass tumblers are in the food service and
consumption category (Figure 26h). Fragments with at least one side intact measure
3â4 inches tall. All of the tumblers are similar in design and size, but they differ
slightly in thickness and weight. Ten fragments could not be attributed to any of
the five individual vessels.
Two iron knife fragments are in the food service and consumption category.
One is a partial blade fragment with a portion of the tang still attached. The tip of
the blade has been broken, and what remains is covered in rust. The other fragment
is the tang. It is also rusted, but two brass pins are present, and these would have
held the handle in place.
Furnishings
Home-furnishing artifacts consist of just a few items. Two are small, corroded,
and fragmentary iron items. One is a small diamond escutcheon, likely from a trunk,
dresser, or similar piece of furniture. The fragment measures 2.5 inches long and
1 inch wide. When complete, the whole piece would have measured ca. 4 inches. The
other rusted iron artifact is a segment of trunk strap, measuring 5 inches long and
1.25 inches wide. One small hole was observed where it was tacked to the trunk.
Another furnishing item is a heavy rusted fragment of a stove burner plate.
It is too rusted to obtain an accurate measurement. The only other furnishing item
is a single glass lamp chimney rim. Only the upper quarter inch is present.
Clothing-Related artifacts
Most of the few clothing items are buttons (Figure 27). The breakdown of the
10 buttons is as follows: 2 bone, 3 white metal, and 5 white Prosser. All buttons have
four holes and range in size from 18 to 30 line. The bone buttons are 24 and 30 line.
The white metal buttons, which are identical, are 30 line. The white Prosser buttons
are of two sizes: 18 line (n = 2) and 29 line (n = 3). The only other clothing items are
a single brass rivet, possibly from a boot/shoe or pants/overalls, and a leather boot
heel. The leather heel is small, indicating that it is from a childâs shoe/boot.
Architectural artifacts
Architectural artifacts consist of nails, wire, and hinges. A total of 47 nails
were recovered from the pit, with 46 being cut nails and only 1 being a wire nail.
Six wire fragments were recovered. The 2 hinges represent different styles, with one

being a fragment from a strap hinge and the other being a gate hinge. The overall
condition of these items is very poor, and they are heavily corroded with rust. Two
small twisted segments of copper wire were recovered, but it is unclear what they
belonged to.
Personal artifacts
Glass bottles related to alcohol and medicine dominate this category, and
the only accouterment recovered is a single folding pocketknife. The iron blades
have rusted into one piece, but the white metal handles and bolstered ends are
partially visible.
Four medicine bottles were identified. Two vessels are based on the presence
of two clear bottle mouths and necks with flat/patent finishes. One is very small,
and the finish is applied, while the other example is larger with a hand-tooled
finish. A green bottle base has embossed lettering on its sides indicating that it
held Udolpho Wolfeâs Aromatic Schnapps. An advertisement in the Evening Post of
Wellington, New Zealand, on June 21, 1877, indicates that this âmedical stimulantâ
was a âcurative of debility.â The fourth example is a brown square bottle base that
was partially reconstructed. Its shape suggests it was likely a panel medicine bottle.
The only markings embossed on a side read âKY.â

55

56

Archeological Investigations at Yanaguana Garden
Most of the glass bottles from the trash pit fill fall into the alcohol category,
based on color, general base shape, and mouth/neck finishes. Using the bases alone,
at least 19 individual alcohol bottles are in the assemblage. Bottle neck/mouth
finishes are used to better describe the types of bottles and the products they held.
It is possible that more are represented, but the many glass fragments make it
difficult to accurately determine if there are additional individual bottles.
Six green glass bottles have applied champagne-finish necks with a
small band of glass applied to the exterior of the neck. These likely held wine or
champagne. Five bottles have wine/brandy finish necks, 4 of which are dark green
and 1 of which is brown. Three of the dark green ones have applied finishes, while
the other green bottle and the brown one have hand-tooled finishes. The specific
products within these bottles are unknown, but alcohol is likely. Four examples of
ring/oil finish necks were found, with three being green and having applied finishes
and one clear one having a hand-tooled finish. Once again, specific contents are
unknown, but color and shape suggest alcohol. Two green double oil/mineral neck
finishes are represented. Each has an applied finish. Lastly, a very dark green
applied flat/patent finish is from a case gin bottle, and a green applied ring/oil
finish is from a liquor bottle.
Activities-Related artifacts
Toys
This category is represented by a single ceramic doll head (Figure 28a). It
appears to have been discarded when it broke at the neck. The head was that of a
small girl doll, hand painted with dark hair, but most of the paint has deteriorated.
Writing
Evidence for writing was found in the form of two writing slate fragments
and a partial glass ink bottle. The former are plain slate that was likely framed
with wood that has rotted away (Figure 28b). Both fragments appear to be corner
pieces, with the larger one measuring 6 inches long and 2.5â3.0 inches wide, and
the smaller fragment measuring 1 inch by 1.5 inches. The clear glass ink bottle
consists of the base measuring 2.375 inches in diameter with a small segment of
one side reconstructed. Sides of the bottle are faceted, with 10 total facets, but no
markings are present.
Sewing
A pair of iron scissors is the only sewing-related item (Figure 28c). One half
is complete and measures 4.5 inches long, and the other is missing the blade tip
and part of one finger/thumb hole; both are heavily corroded.
Horse Tack and Harness
The most striking artifact in this category is brass spur fragment (Figure
28d). Measuring just over 2 inches wide across the arms, the spur is small and

likely belonged to a child. Both of the terminals are broken from the arms, so it
is not possible to determine how this spur fastened. Only a portion of the rowel is
present. It is iron and much of it has rusted away.
A complete snaffle bit is heavily rusted such that the joint at the center of
the bit is fused solid (Figure 28e). The rings on either end are also rusted in place
and cannot be moved. Two rusted cinch rings were also found, one 2.25 inches in
diameter and the other 2.5 inches in diameter.
The only harness hardware consists of two small iron roller buckles encrusted
in a thick layer of rust. The smaller of the two buckles measures 1 inch across and
still has the tongue and roller, although they cannot move. All that remains of the
other buckle is the 1.5-inch frame.
Faunal Remains
Appendix A contains a description and analysis of the vertebrate faunal
remains recovered from the trash pit. The assemblage consists of 919 bones weighing
13.2 kg. Almost two-thirds (n = 581) are unidentified mammal bones. Most of the
remainder are cow or likely cow (n = 270), with domestic pig being next most common
(n = 31). Other identified animals represented by 1â3 bones each are domestic goat,
domestic sheep, horse or donkey, white-tailed deer, and turkey.
Lithics
Recovered from the various layers of feature fill were 20 chert and limestone
pebbles and cobbles ranging in size from 1 to 4 inches; many more were observed
and not collected. They clearly were introduced into the feature fill, since these
types of stones do not occur naturally in this setting. Some had been modified
by flaking and appeared to be prehistoric chipped stone tools, but they obviously
were in a context unassociated with Native American occupation. Many of the
rocks were burned, and it is surmised they were used as heating stones in the
fireplace of the house and discarded with ash and charcoal when the fireplace
was cleaned out.
Unidentifiable Artifacts
This category consists of items that are too fragmentary, corroded, or small
to be assigned to a specific artifact type. It includes 16 pieces of rusted iron that can
be identified as banding fragments but not the actual type of banding (i.e., barrel
banding, trunk straps, etc.). Other unidentifiable rusted iron items are 3 heavy
fragments and 21 small pieces.
There are 293 glass bottle fragments that cannot be attributed specifically to
alcohol, food, medicine, or other bottle types. By color, these consist of the following:
green (all shades), n = 230; clear/opaque, n = 55; amber/brown, n = 6; and aqua,
n = 2. Eleven of the green glass fragments contain embossed lettering, but the only
thing that can be read is âNew Yorkâ on a few fragments.

Chapter 4: Results of Archeological Investigations
Chronology and Associations
The ceramic artifacts, particularly the whiteware vessels with identifiable
makersâ marks on their bases, are most useful for determining the age of the feature.
As stated earlier, eight different makersâ marks are represented, five of which
could be identified in terms of manufacturer, and three of which could be dated to
when they were made: (1) John Wedge Wood (1841â1860); (2) James Edwards &
Son (1851â1882); and (3) Pinder, Bourne & Co. (1862â1882). The last one indicates
that the pit postdates 1862. Determining the last date of use is more difficult, since
people can use ceramic vessels for generations following their period of manufacture,
but the 1882 terminal date for two of the marks makes an estimate of 1880sâ1890s
seem reasonable.
The glass bottles recovered are consistent with the interpretation that
the feature dates to the latter part of the nineteenth century, since none display
characteristics of bottles made by an automatic bottling machine. Machine-made
bottles were first manufactured in 1903 and became increasingly common after
1905 (Lindsey 2015).
Other temporally sensitive artifacts support the idea that the pit dates to
the latter part of the nineteenth century, despite not being very diagnostic. The
Powell Bristol stoneware bottle must predate 1906. Annular ceramic wares were
manufactured earlier but are often found in 1840â1900 contexts. Following the
creation of the Prosser process in 1840 (Sprague 2002:111), Prosser buttons flooded
the market in the latter half of the nineteenth century, often replacing bone and
other materials. The predominance of cut nails also points to the latter part of the
nineteenth century, since wire nails were introduced in the 1890s and became the
preferred choice only after 1900 (Wells 1998:87), as does the Udolpho Wolfe schnapps
bottle with the 1877 newspaper advertisement.
Of course, the actual length of time the pit was used was much shorter than
the several decades between 1862 and the end of the nineteenth century. Multiple
episodes of dumping were evident in the pit profile, but it was not left open long
enough for natural processes to contribute to filling it. Further, artifact densities were
consistently high throughout the entire pit, and the various kinds of artifacts were
highly mixed. For example, two of the Copeland ginger beer bottles and one of the
Bristol-glazed ginger beer bottles were found at the top of the pit, and other examples
of these kinds of bottles were commonly recovered throughout the excavation of the
pit. Based on this evidence, it appears the pit may have been used for no more than
a few months, and certainly for no more than a few years.
The archival research presented below indicates that the feature most likely
relates to occupation by the Volpert family, or perhaps less likely, tenants. Minus time
away during the Civil War, Marcellus Volpert lived on the property from 1856 till at
or near his death in 1888. He married in 1869, but his wife died in 1879, after which
their four children attended school and lived elsewhere for at least part of the time.
Between 1888 and 1899, the property may have been occupied occasionally by a family
member, housed tenants, or been vacant at times. Between 1899 and 1944, when the
lot passed out of the hands of Volpert family members, only tenants lived there.

Archeological Investigations at Yanaguana Garden
Discussion
The 41BX2068 pit is interpreted as a trash pit based on its contents (i.e.,
household refuse) and its position at the back of the lot away from the house location.
To determine if similar kinds of features have been documented in the vicinity of
Yanaguana Garden, reports on archeological work done for the Henry B. Gonzales
Convention Center and the Alamodome nearby were reviewed. These investigations
documented numerous house sites and their related archeological features, many of
which were contemporary with 41BX2068 or slightly older or younger. Eight sites
provided archeological features for comparative purposes (Table 4).

The focus of this comparison was to assess whether the pit at 41BX2068
originally was dug to serve as something other than a trash receptacle, with the
most obvious competing interpretation being that it was a privy pit later reused for
refuse discard. No features substantially like the 41BX2068 pit were found in the
literature, but based on the sites listed in Table 4, the privy pit interpretation seems
highly unlikely. At those sites, all identified privies were deep (5â6 ft), often lined
vaults. Earlier privies were square earthen vaults, some of which were lined with
wooden crates, cedar posts, or cut limestone blocks for support. Later privy vaults
remained square but became very formal constructions lined with brick. Upon arrival
of the railroad to San Antonio in 1877, bricks became readily available, so this date
is often used as the earliest date for brick-lined privy vaults in this area (Wright
1997:43). The majority of the privies recorded during the Alamodome Project were
brick construction, therefore dating to 1877 or later.
Another characteristic common to privies in this area is that they were not
densely packed with artifacts. In all cases, privies did contain fragments of lost or

Chapter 4: Results of Archeological Investigations
discarded artifacts, but not in the amounts observed at 41BX2068. Several even
showed signs of being cleaned out on occasion.
The pit at 41BX2068 is distinctly different than the privy pits identified at
the other sites. It is roughly round, basin shaped, unlined, and densely packed with
artifacts. Additionally, no ânight soilsâ were observed. Hence, it seems most likely
that it was dug purposefully to hold trash.
Archival Research
The trash pit at 41BX2068 is in the backyard of a house at 541 Water Street
that belonged to the Volpert family from 1856 until 1944. When the neighborhood
was platted, probably in the 1850s, Thomas Jefferson Devine (1820â1890) owned the
land. He held a substantial amount of land in Bexar County by 1843 and continued
to acquire and sell local property throughout his lifetime (Bexar County, Ad Valorem
Tax Records; Bexar County, Deed Records). Born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Devine
launched his career in New York, moved to Tallahasse in 1835, and studied law in
Mississippi and Kentucky. He first practiced in La Grange, Texas, where he and
Helen Elder married in 1844. The couple moved to San Antonio that year. Devine
was appointed city attorney and elected district judge in 1851. After he sold the
property on Water Street, Devine served on the stateâs 1861 Secession Convention
as a member of the Committee of Public Safety, and was appointed judge of the
Confederate Western District of Texas. Having taken an oath of allegiance to Mexico
at the end of the Civil War, Devine was twice indicted for treason, but pardoned
(Find a Grave 2009; Russell 2015). Well before that, however, the city surveyor,
G. Freisleben, platted Devineâs San Antonio town lots (Bexar County, Deed Records).
On October 4, 1856, Devine sold Lot 5, Block 5 of City Block 890 to Marcellus
Volpert1 for $175 (Figure 29) (Bexar County, Deed Record O2:140). The 46.65-ft front of
the lot faced Water Street and extended northwesterlyâ169.8 ft on the southwest side
and 170.5 ft on the northeast sideâto the Alamo Ditch (City of San Antonio 1964:97).
Volpert (1835â1888) immigrated from the Hesse region of Germany, departing from
Bremen on November 1, 1852, and arriving in Galveston on January 1, 1853, aboard
the J. W. Buddecke (City of San Antonio 1888; Galveston Historical Foundation 1853;
U.S. Department of the Interior, Census Office 1870, 1880). From 1858 until 1862,
when he served as a private in Company B of the Texas Third Infantry, First Infantry,
Luckettâs Regiment, Volpertâs property was valued at $200 (Bexar County, Ad Valorem
Tax Records; National Archives and Records Administration n.d.). Seeking volunteers
at recruiting camps in Austin and San Antonio, Philip N. Luckett initially took 648 men
to protect the Rio Grande in October 1862. They marched to the Gulf Coast, arriving in
Galveston in July 1863. These troops were reassigned in April 1864 to the Red River
campaign front lines (Cutrer 2015). Volpert returned to San Antonio, where he worked
as a stonemason, and occupied his stone house at 541 Water Street (Bexar County, Ad
Valorem Tax Records).

Volpert and Cathryn Theis2 (1849â1879) married in February 1869. A native
of the Nausau region of Germany, she had traveled to San Antonio with her parents
in 1853. The family was farming in Bexar County in 1860, and she had three younger
siblings at the timeâFerdinand, Margarita, and Paulinaâall born in Texas (Bexar
County, Marriage Record E:201; City of San Antonio 1879; U.S. Department of the Interior,
Census Office 1860, 1870). In 1870, the Volperts had $800 in real estate and $200 in
personal wealth (U.S. Department of the Interior, Census Office 1870). The value of their
property grew slightly to $950 in 1873, remained static in 1874 and 1876, and swelled to
$1,500 by 1877 (Bexar County, Ad Valorem Tax Records). During the 1870s, the couple
had four children in quick succession: twin sons George M. (1871â1950) and Ferdinand
(1871â1882), daughter Pauline (1874â1953), and son Charles John (1877â1928) (City of
San Antonio 1882:48â49; Find a Grave 2008a, 2008b; San Antonio Express 1950; Texas
Department of Health, Bureau of Vital Statistics 1950, 1953). Cathryn Theis Volpert
died from heart disease on October 21, 1879, and was buried in the German Catholic
cemetery (City of San Antonio 1879:104â105). As a widower, Volpert continued to reside
in the 541 Water Street house, but the children attended Catholic schools and lived
away from home, at least part of the time, after their motherâs death (Bexar County, Ad
Valorem Tax Records; Morrison & Fourmy 1879; San Antonio Daily Light 1886:1; U.S.

Sometimes recorded as Tyce.

Chapter 4: Results of Archeological Investigations
Department of the Interior, Census Office 1880). In 1880, the two older boys lived on
College Street with several of their teachers, servants, and other students; it is unclear
where the two younger children lived that year (U.S. Department of the Interior, Census
Office 1880). At age 12, Ferdinand Volpert succumbed to septicemia on December 5, 1882,
and was buried in the German Catholic cemetery (City of San Antonio 1882:48â49).
In 1885, Volpert was living at 439 Water Street (Morrison & Fourmy 1885). Two years
later, his youngest son, Charles, resided with his maternal grandmother, Anna Maria
Bauldus Theis (1821â1901), the widow of George Theis (1816â1881) (Find a Grave 2008c;
Morrison & Fourmy 1888; U.S. Department of the Interior, Census Office 1860, 1880).
By that time, both his older siblings were on their own; a merchant and manufacturerâs
agent employed Pauline, and George was working as a baker (Morrison & Fourmy
1888). Volpertâs property retained its value in the 1880s, fluctuating between $1,200,
and $1,500 (Bexar County, Ad Valorem Tax Records). On June 29, 1888, an hour after
the onset of sunstroke, Volpert died at age 53, according to physician G. Graham Watts.
He was also buried in the German Catholic Cemetery (City of San Antonio 1888:83â84).
Despite having their uncle, Lucas John Sueltenfuss,3 serving as a court-assigned
guardian for the Volpert orphansâGeorge was 15, Pauline was 14, and Charles was
11 when their father diedâthe estate struggled with payment of taxes on the family
homestead. In July 1888 and May 1891, the Volpert orphans sought relief from payment
(San Antonio Daily Light 1888:4, 1891:16). Nevertheless, the property retained its value
in the 1890s, hovering at $1,200 and $1,250 (Bexar County, Ad Valorem Tax Records).
During this decade, the house may have been vacant, occasionally occupied by a family
member, or housed tenants, such as A. G. Cotera in 1891 and Horace Hammant Hugman,
a coachman for R. Winslow, in 1895 (Appler 1891, 1895). Meanwhile, siblings George and
Pauline Volpert worked and lived elsewhere in San Antonio. In 1891, he was a clerk for
C.Â H. Gemble; in 1892, he was a delivery boy for a company on Matagorda Street, and
she was a servant for and resided with Mrs. Sallie Hamilton (Appler 1891, 1893). By
1896, the house had been divided into a duplex, and a long porch extended the breadth
of the front southeast-facing faÃ§ade. A small building was directly behind the house, and
another was at the rear of the lot (Sanborn Fire Insurance Company 1896:28). In 1897,
both George Volpert, who worked at a brick company, and Fred Arlitt, a harness maker
for Frank and Company, occupied the house at 541 Water Street. That year, Charles
Volpert was a laborer and lived elsewhere (Appler 1898). The following year, Charles
Volpert and Emma M. (1879â1904) had married. The couple had moved to St. Louis by
1900 (U.S. Department of the Interior, Census Office 1900a). He lived out his life with
his family in the St. Louis area (U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census
1920a; U.S. Department of Commerce and Labor, Bureau of the Census 1910a). 4

Probate matters continued for the Volpert heirs in the 1890s. Horace
Hammant Hugman5 and Pauline Volpert married in Boerne on September 8, 1894
Sueltenfuss was an uncle to the children through his 1883 marriage to Theresa Theis, Cathryn
Theis Volpertâs youngest sister (Bexar County, Marriage Record H:179).
4
Emma M. Volpert died in 1904 as the result of a pregnancy (City of St. Louis, Health Department
1904). Charles Volpert married Wilhelmina âMinnieâ Susanna Eckterhoff (1883â1927) in 1904
(Bexar County, Marriage Record S:546; Find A Grave 2008b). In 1910 the couple lived in St. Louis
where he was a janitor for an office building (U.S. Department of Commerce and Labor, Bureau
of the Census 1910a). They both died in Illinois (Find a Grave 2008b).

Horrace Hammant Hugman, brother to Robert Charles Harold Hugman, was uncle to RobertÂ H.
Harvey Hugman, who designed the River Walk.

(Figure 30) (Bexar County, Marriage Record M:143). Consequently, the estate guardian
was discharged in 1895 (San Antonio Daily Light 1895a:5, 1895b:8). However, in March
1897, the three Volpert heirs and Hugman filed suit against Sueltenfuss, as guardian
for the minors, and two other men, for $3,000 held in bond (San Antonio Daily Light
1897a:5, 1897b:5, 1897c:18). Near the end of the decade, Charles, the youngest of the
Volpert heirs, sued his brother, sister, and brother-in-law to partition the land. H. B. Gray,
who held a deed of trust on the property to secure a $160 debt, was included in the suit.
The court granted the partition, and the two older brothers separately conveyed their
respective one-third interests to Horace Hammant Hugman between August 1898 and
October 1899 for $210; Pauline Volpert Hugman retained her one-third interest in the
property (Bexar County, Deed Records 166:271, 167:380, 174:124, 176:435; San Antonio
Daily Light 1898a:6, 1898b:6, 1899). The Hugmans occupied the property at 541 Water
Street in 1897 and 1898 but had moved to 112 Peach Street by 1899 (Appler 1898).

Horace Hammant Hugman (1867â1907) was born in Tottenham, Middlesex,
England. He immigrated to the United States through Baltimore in 1881 (British
Isles Census 1881; National Archives and Records Administration 1881; San Antonio
Light 1907:7). Horace and Pauline Volpert Hugman lived in the house they owned
Figure 30
at 112 Peach Street in San Antonio
in 1900 with two young children.
He was employed as a hostler at the
time (U.S. Department of the Interior,
Census Office 1900b). When Hugman
died in 1907, his widow inherited his
interest in 541 Water Street (San
Antonio Light 1907:7). In 1910, the
widow lived with her five childrenâ
George, William, Florence, Alice,
and Henryâon a farm she owned in
Kendall County (U.S. Department
of Commerce and Labor, Bureau
of the Census 1910b). In 1919, she
and William F. Cole (1867â1946)
married (Bexar County, Deed Record
2065:328; Find a Grave 2008d; U.S.
Department of Commerce, Bureau of
the Census 1920a). A second marriage
for both, their blended family lived
on the Lower Balcones Road, where
they owned a farm and ranch (U.S.
Department of Commerce, Bureau of
the Census 1920b). Ten years later,
the couple remained on the property,
but the children had moved on (U.S.
Department of Commerce, Bureau
of the Census 1930a). The Coles

divorced in 1935, and she returned
(Shaw Family Tree 2012).

Chapter 4: Results of Archeological Investigations
to her home at 112 Peach Street in San Antonio where she resided until her 1953
death (Bexar County, Deed Record 2065:328; John F. Worley Directory Company
1934â1935, 1948).
The oldest sibling, George Volpert and Dora Hagman (1880â1941), a native
of Switzerland, married in June 1900 (Bexar County, Marriage Record P:390; San
Antonio Daily Light 1900:4; Texas Department of Health, Bureau of Vital Statistics
1941). The couple divorced in 1907 (San Antonio Gazette 1907a:5, 1907b:1). Volpert,
a baker, and several other Volpert heirs had received a sum of money from the
sale of land in Bexar County in April 1907 (Bexar County, Deed Record 265:253).
He traveled to Lockhart a few weeks before June 12, but apparently disappeared.
Volpert was spotted in nearby Dale walking along the railroad with a bundle over
his arm and was last seen headed to Plum Creek with a fishing pole. A cryptic note,
with photographs of the couple and a wide black border, instructed his ex-wife to
take his property because she would never see him again. This message and its
presentation led to the assumption that Volpert was suicidal (San Antonio Gazette
1907a:5, 1907b:1). But he was back in San Antonio at his widowed sisterâs home at
112 Peach Street by February 1908, when he placed a newspaper advertisement
to take in orders for silverware, transparent pocketknives, and earthenware (San
Antonio Daily Light 1908:40). In 1920, Volpert was single and renting a farm on Ruby
Street in the Hot Wells area, south of downtown San Antonio (U.S. Department of
Commerce, Bureau of the Census 1920c). Ten years later, he was renting a farm on
the old Corpus Christi Road as a widower6 (U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau
of the Census 1930b). Volpert had moved to Boerne by 1938, where he was a baker
(San Antonio Express 1950:19). By 1940, he was single, no longer working, and renting
a property in Boerne (U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census 1940). He
had a surviving son, George Jr., 7 when he died in 1950 and was buried in the Boerne
Cemetery (Find a Grave 2008a; San Antonio Express 1950:19; Texas Department
of Health, Bureau of Vital Statistics 1950).
No members of the Volpert family occupied the dwelling at 541 Water Street
in the twentieth century. Various tenants of the duplex included Max W. Fues, a
clerk at Guenther Mills, in 1899 and 1900; Lamen W. Pytel and John E. Putnam,
both employed by Fire Company #3, in 1903 and 1904; N. B. Cozby, a printer, in 1905
and 1906; Alex Rossy, a cigar manufacturer, in 1907 and 1908; Emil, an upholsterer,
and Mary Arandt in 1908; George, a well driller, and Jennie Antwright in 1909;
August R., a butcher, and Agnes Townsend, Albert T. Townsend, a carpenter, and
Albert, a carpenter, and Darthulia Robinson, all in 1910; Marcellino, a tailor, and
Maria Medina from 1912 until 1918; Reyes C., a tailor, and Cleos Briones in 1913;
John Leos, a tailor, in 1913 and 1914; Guadalupe Garansway, who worked at the
Webster Company, in 1915; Gregory P. Garza, with Central Meat Market, John P.
Both the 1920 census and his death certificate denote George M. Volpert as a widower, but no
known record documents either a second marriage or the death of a spouse (Texas Department
of Health, Bureau of Vital Statistics 1950; U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census
1920c).
7
This is according to George M. Volpertâs obituary, but no known record documents the life of a
namesake. Volpert had a son, Alexander Murphy (1902â1968), with his first wife, and her second
husband had adopted the boy by 1910 (FamilySearch 1951; Find a Grave 2011; U.S. Department
of Commerce, Bureau of the Census 1930b; U.S. Department of Commerce and Labor, Bureau of
the Census 1910c).

Garza, a clerk at Halff Brothers, and Beatrice Uribe, a seamstress for a trunk
company, in 1916; and F. Martinez, who worked at the Cream Dairy Company, and
Mrs. Teresa Martinez in 1919 (Appler 1900 1902, 1904, 1906, 1908a, 1908b, 1909,
1910, 1912, 1913, 1914, 1915, 1916, 1917, 1918, 1919).
With so many tenant occupants, the house evolved in the early twentieth
century. By 1904, the building was noted as a single-family dwelling despite the
number of tenant occupants. The outbuilding closest to the house remained extant,
but the one near the rear of the lot was no longer present (Sanborn Fire Insurance
Company 1904:117). By 1912, two outbuildings were on the lot (Sanborn Fire
Insurance Company 1912:238). In 1915, Pauline Volpert Hugman paid the Beebe
Construction Company $194.70 for curb and pavement improvements to the lot
(Bexar County, Mechanics Lien 19:32). Street numbers changed after 1919, according
to annual city directories and decennial census records, and it is unclear which
pertained to the Volpert house. Even so, it is evident that the house was either
vacant or tenant occupied between 1920 and 1944.
On July 25, 1944, Pauline Volpert Hugman Cole sold the property to
Marcelino A. (1890â1978) and Maria (1890sâafter 1978) Apolinar (Bexar County,
Deed Record 2061:476; Find a Grave 2012; Texas Department of Health, Bureau
of Vital Statistics 1978). This marked the end of an era for the Volpert family, who
had continuously owned the land since 1856.
Assessment
It is recommended that 41BX2068 be considered not eligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places or designation as a State Antiquities Landmark.
The feature did yield some useful information about material culture, consumer
habits, and foodways in San Antonio during the latter half of the nineteenth century,
but having been almost completely excavated, the feature contains no additional
important information that would make it eligible for listing or designation.

Faunal Remains from
41BX2068

Appendix A: Analysis of Vertebrate Faunal Remains from 41Bx2068
Introduction
On behalf of Raba Kistner Environmental, Inc. (RKEI), the author conducted
systematic faunal analysis of a collection of remains recovered by Prewitt and
Associates, Inc., from 41BX2068. The faunal assemblage was received by RKEI in
April 2015 and was transferred to the author in early May 2015. The assemblage
consisted of a total of 919 bones, weighing 13,234.29 g. The faunal materials had been
washed, dried, and bagged in a single provenience representing the entire trash pit.
Methods
Taxonomy is not a static framework in biology. Research in the placement
(and thus the naming) of species in the taxonomic hierarchy is ongoing in many cases.
The authority used for taxonomic nomenclature for this report is the Integrated
Taxonomic Information System (ITIS), an international collaboration of taxonomists
available online (ITIS 2015).
Each bone was identified to the most specific taxon possible using several
reference texts (Balkwill and Cumba 1992; Cohen and Serjeantson 1996; Gilbert
1990; Gilbert et al. 1981; Hillson 1955; Olsen 1960, 1964, 1968). Identification was
conservative, e. g., bone that was cow-sized was not identified as cattle (Bos taurus)
unless it could be positively differentiated from bison (Bison bison) and horse (Equus
caballos). When identification to a taxonomic level was not certain, the bone was
assigned to the next highest taxonomic level. Thus, bone that was clearly bovid but
that could not be differentiated between cattle and bison was listed as Bovinae.
Bone that could only be identified to class, such as mammal or bird, was separated
by size when possible. Bones that had clearly been broken during excavation and
could be matched were counted as a single bone. When unsealed epiphyses were
present and could be mended to the diaphysis, they were counted as one bone.
All bone was weighed, and evidence of heat alteration (charred or calcined)
and cutting with saws was noted. For bone identifiable to at least the order taxonomic
level, additional data recovered included element and portion of element, side,
evidence of juvenile characteristics, and butcher marks. In addition, when feasible,
the thickness of the âcutâ was measured.
Data recovered from the analysis was entered into a spreadsheet. Bone was
bagged by taxa in 4-mil-thick polyethylene bags. Acid-free paper tags listing site
number and number of bags for each taxon, as well as count and weight for each
bag, were placed inside another bag to prevent contact with the faunal material.
Three measures of relative abundance were used to estimate the importance
of all species to the meat diet as represented by this collection: Number of Identified
Specimens (NISP), Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI), and bone weight. NISP
is the count of specimens identified to at least the genus taxonomic level. Its use
as a measure of relative abundance is problematic (Grayson 1984:20â24; Reitz and
Wing 1999:191â192). NISP cannot differentiate between fragments from a single
individual and fragments from many individuals. Reliance on NISP alone will distort
the estimate of relative abundance in favor of small animals (Grayson 1984) as

77

Archeological Investigations at Yanaguana Garden
well as animals with parts that are more readily identifiable in fragmentary form
(Lyman and OâBrien 1987).
Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI) is a derived measure commonly
used to get around some of the biases of NISP. MNI is the minimum number of
animals of each species or genera that must have been present to account for the
elements identified for that species. This is determined by dividing paired elements
(or portions of elements such as proximal or distal ends) into right and left side, and
then finding the most abundant such element (Lyman 1994:38â39). Estimated age of
the animals (at least immature vs. mature) is often considered in the analysis. MNI
can, if properly calculated, be a useful counterpoint to NISP. However, MNI also has
problems as a measure of relative abundance. Grayson (1984: 29â49) has pointed
out that MNI is extremely sensitive to the way in which the analyst aggregates the
data. MNI counts can be made to vary a great deal by changing how the analyst
groups the data, for instance, by unit/level, by complete unit, by natural level, by the
entire site, etc. (see Grayson 1984:34â49). The more inclusive the grouping, the more
the data are reduced. In this case, the entire collection is from a single provenience
and is estimated to have been deposited over a relatively short duration, thus the
MNI estimate avoids many of the problems described by Grayson (1984).
Bone weight can also, with caution, be used as a measure of relative
abundance. In general, larger bones carry more meat, but the relationship is not
linear (Reitz and Wing 1999:222â231), varies among different taxa, and varies
considerably from one part of the animal to another (e.g., lower legs of artiodactyls
are dense, heavy bones but carry relatively little meat compared to other bones of the
body). Using bone weight as an assessment of dietary importance also is limited by
the necessary assumption that all taphonomic factors that affect bone weight (such
as leaching, mineralization, or encrustation) have affected all bones in the collection
uniformly. In this collection, the bones were probably deposited within a relatively
short period and are in excellent condition, showing only slight weathering on a few
bones, with none showing any encrustation. Bone weight tends to emphasize the
importance of larger, heavier animals, and due to this, counterbalances the tendency
of NISP to emphasize smaller animals.
Each analytic method discussed above is subject to a number of biases
(Reitz and Wing 1999:200). Used together, however, NISP, MNI, and bone weight
can provide a better picture of the relative importance of each species to the diet
than any can provide when used alone.
Results
A total of 80 bones, 8.7 percent of the total collection, representing 7 taxa
were identified to at least the genus taxonomic level (Table A.1). Cattle (Bos taurus)
was the most common identified species, with 40 bones, and pig (Sus scrofa) the
next most common with 31 bones. All other identified genera were limited to 3 or
fewer bones.
Although bone that could not be differentiated between cow and bison is
listed as Bovinae in Table A.1, the fact that bison had been extirpated from the San

Antonio area by about 1840 (Weniger 1997:38) indicates that the Bovinae can be
grouped with Bos taurus with a reasonable degree of comfort. This brings the total
bovid count to 270 and increases the MNI to 8. It should be noted that the MNI for
pig is low probably because many of the identifiable pig bones, in particular the
metapodials and phalanges, are not readily separated into left and right sides.
Bone Condition
The bones in this collection are in unusually good condition, with only a
few showing slight weathering due to exposure, and none showing the chemical
weathering caused by microbial activity that is common in open sites in south
Texas. The deposition of the bones into a pit and the apparent rapid filling of the
feature protected them from weathering and differential preservation. The absence
of rodent chewing also indicates that the pit was filled fairly rapidly.
Evidence of Burning
Only 118 bones (12.8 percent) in this collection were charred. Of these, 11
had only limited areas of charring, suggesting they were charred during cooking,
possibly over an open fire. No bones in this collection were calcined. The more heavily

1

charred bones suggest that bones were occasionally tossed into a fire for disposal
and that the ashes of the fire were tossed into the trash pit.
Butcher Marks
Four types of butcher marks were noted during data collection: (1) cut, a
thin superficial cut from a knife (n = 7); (2) chop, a deep cut from a large knife or
hatchet (n = 110); (3) impact scar, evidence of small area blunt force impact (n = 48);
and (4) hand saw cut, with uneven striations and differing angles (n = 192). In
addition, although usually not considered a butcherâs mark per se, bullet holes
were noted (see below). Many bones had more than one type of mark. No bones had
the characteristic marks of a machine-powered saw. Machine saws were in use at
least by larger operations in California by the 1920s, but small rural butchers were
still using hacksaws to butcher meat (Gust 1983:344). While it is not known when
power equipment became the norm in butchering in San Antonio, the presence
of both hand-sawed and machine-sawed bones in a privy that was filled between
roughly 1905 and 1920 (Brown and DeÂ La O 1997:267) suggests that at least some
butchers in San Antonio were using power equipment within the first few decades
of the twentieth century.
Discussion
Intersite Comparisons
The richness of this collection is very limited, with only seven different
genera. All of the taxa identified to genus are domestic animals, with the possible
exception of turkey. All the taxa are commonly used food animals, with the exception
of horse or donkey. Comparison of this collection to those from two sites dating to
roughly the same period that were excavated prior to the building of the Alamodome
in San Antonio shows that the dump at 41BX2068 is very different (Table A.2).
The Webb site (41BX897) was first occupied in 1865, and various members
of the family continued to own the lot for the next hundred years (Meissner and
Hunziker 1997:301). The trash dump was large, although relatively shallow, and
was found to extend well into the lot to the south in one continuous unit. Historical
records and the analysis of artifacts from the trash dump suggested that the dump
was in use from the time the Webbs purchased the property until roughly the late
1880s (Tennis 1997:24). The lot to the south was sold in 1883, at which time a house
was built there, and presumably the Webbs could no longer use the southern part
of the dump. While the vast majority of the artifacts recovered were clearly mid to
late nineteenth century, there were a few that were likely early twentieth century,
including a few machine saw cut bones (Meissner and Hunziker 1997:323). The site
to the south of the Webbâs, the King/Klar site (41BX883) included a brick-lined privy
constructed about 1890 (Brown and DeÂ La O 1997:261). Since the privy was filled
with household trash after the house was attached to the new city sewage system
about 1905, the artifacts and bones from this privy represent the early twentieth
century.

Table A.2 compares various attributes of the three collections. Note that
41BX2068 has far fewer bones than the much larger trash dump at the Webb site
and the privy at the King/Klar site. Both the bones identified to genus and the
count of bones that can only be identified as mammal are proxy estimates of the
degree of fragmentation of the bones. All three collections are roughly similar in
these estimates and show that the bones were in relatively the same condition,
although the bones from the Webb dump were somewhat more fragmented, partially
as a result of the way the dump was excavated (Wright 1997:88). The percentage
of bones that had evidence of immaturity in the 41BX2068 collection was almost
twice that of other two.
As noted, the collection from 41BX2068 has an unusually small number of
identified genera. The difference among the three collections is largely in the wide
range of wild animals present in the Webb trash dump and the King/Klar privy,
especially in the latter, where there were large numbers of both jackrabbits (Lepus
californicus) and cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus sp.) as well as large numbers of
ducks, geese, and turkey (Meissner and Hunziker 1997:321, 326).
Table A.2 also shows categories of animals in the three collections. All bone
identified as bovid was grouped together, under the assumption that Bison (Bison
bison) had been extirpated from the area around San Antonio by the time all three
sites were inhabited (Weniger 1997:38). Goat and sheep bones were grouped because
they were grouped by Meissner and Hunziker (1997) if they could be differentiated
from deer but not from each other. The category âCommonly hunted animalsâ includes

81

82

Archeological Investigations at Yanaguana Garden
deer (Odocoileus virginianus) jackrabbit, cottontail rabbit, and javelina (Pecari
tajacu). The âBirdsâ category includes ducks (Anatinae), geese (Anserinae), and
turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo), all of which may or may not have been domesticated
at the time they were killed. All fish bones, whether identified to genus or not, was
included in âFishâ category.
In all three collections, bovids are most common, with pig the second most
abundant. The privy at the King/Klar site (41BX883) is the odd man out, with far
more hunted mammals and birds that may have been hunted than either of the other
collections. During the time that the privy was being filled, the property was owned
by a butcher (Brown and DeÂ La O 1997:263), and it is possible that he routinely
included hunted animals in his shop, although the large numbers of jackrabbits are
a puzzle since these animals produce notoriously tough meat (Weniger 1997:156).
Site 41BX2068 is unique in the near-absence of anything but domestic animals, with
only single deer and turkey bones. There were, however, no identified chickens in
the 41BX2068 collection and only one bird bone of about chicken size.
Looking at butcher marks is another way to compare the three sites. Table
A.2 shows the numbers and percentages of bones showing chop marks, hand saw
cuts, and machine saw cuts in the three collections. Note that many bones had more
than one type of butcher mark on them. As mentioned above, the machine saw cut
bones in the Webb collection probably postdate most of the rest of that collection.
Only 5.6 percent of the sawed bone in the Webb trash dump collection was machine
sawed, while 39.1 percent of the sawed bone in the King/Klar privy was machine
sawed. None of the bone at 41BX2068 was machine sawed.
Butchering at 41BX2068
The specifics of cutting up a carcass into appropriately sized pieces, at least
by professional butchers, has changed very little in America since the mid-nineteenth
century (Clonts 1983). The general sequence in processing cattle for consumption
begins with slaughtering and then gutting the animal and removing the hide, head,
and tail. The carcass is then split down the middle of the vertebral column, and each
half is then separated into fore and hind quarters. Each quarter is then cut into
smaller sections most commonly purchased by the consumer. Smaller artiodactyls
such as pigs, sheep, and goats are butchered in roughly the same way.
Most of the bovid bones in this collection were from recognizable meat cuts;
however, most were not cut into neat 1-inch-thick steaks and chops or 2-inch-thick
roasts. For instance, most of the lumbar vertebrae of bovids in this collection were
not cut into classic âT-boneâ steaks. Instead, the bone was split axially down the
center, usually by hand saw but occasionally by chopping, and then each half was
disarticulated at each end, leaving a âT-boneâ as much as 4 or 5 inches thick. While
there are cut marks on many of these bones suggesting that meat had been removed
from them, many had no such evidence.
Sirloin cuts (upper innominate) varied from 0.3 to 3.2 inches thick. The rump
cuts (lower innominate) were also cut into a wide range of thicknesses, although there

Appendix A: Analysis of Vertebrate Faunal Remains from 41Bx2068
was more regularity in these cuts, with most less than 0.8 inches thick. There were
only a few ribs with proximal or distal ends. Most were cut from medial sections.
For the most part, the femur and humerus were represented by the distal
ends. Usually, the radius and ulna were cut just below the proximal epiphysis
and just above the distal epiphysis, while the diaphysis was cut into lengths of
approximately 5.1 to 5.5 inches long. There were no proximal tibias in this collection,
but the diaphysis of the tibias was cut in a fashion similar to the radius, and there
were a few distal ends. The distal femur and tibia represent hindshank cuts while
the distal humerus and radius/ulna represent foreshank cuts. These are low-cost
cuts. Yet the ribs, lumbar vertebrae, and dorsal innominate represent the most
expensive cuts of meat available.
There were too few bones of goats and sheep to determine any sort of
butchering pattern. Pig bone was largely from either feet or heads. Only one pig
bone was saw cut. The rest that showed butcher marks were chopped.
In general, although the bovid bones indicate more or less standard
butchering practices up to a point, there is a great deal of variation in what can be
considered the end product. The standardized steaks, chops, and roasts so familiar
to us today were more or less the rule at the time the trash pit was being filled,
at least for professional butchers (Schulz and Gust 1983). This suggests that the
butcher who processed the meat at 41BX2068 was either not professional or was
butchering meat for a specific purpose that required non-standard, and for the most
part larger, cuts.
Bullet Holes
Five bones in this collection had bullet holes in them (Figure A.1). All were
bovid scapulas. This is an interesting finding. Generally speaking, it seems far more
efficient to slaughter a cow by shooting it in the head if you must shoot it, although
the professional method of slaughter at the time was an axe or hammer blow between
the eyes (Clemen 1923:125â126). Why, then, were as many as five cows shot in a
place that was clearly aiming at the heart? All but one of these bullet holes were
from large-caliber rounds, and it is possible that an accurate shot at the heart was
considered an acceptable method of slaughter. It was not, however, very professional.
The potential for complications if the bullet failed to hit the heart are obvious.
Another possibility was considered during examination of the bones at the
Webb trash dump (41BX897). Two bones were found that had large-caliber bullet
holes in them. One, like those in this collection, was a scapula. The other bullet
hole was in the transverse process of a lumbar vertebra, at an angle that made it
clear the shot was made from almost directly above the cow. Since the Webb site
was at the very edge of town in the early years of its habitation, it was considered
possible that these cattle were hunted rather than raised (Meissner and Hunziker
1997:329â333). Until the 1930s, Texas was an open-range state, with cattle ownership
determined by brands, marks, or tags. After the 1930s, many local jurisdictions
required stockowners to keep their animals inside fences, although there was no state
law requiring this (Dowell 2014). These days it is probably considered unneighborly

(to say the least) to claim or kill an unmarked cow that you have not purchased,
in the past cattle more than a year old with no brands, tags, or other indications
of ownership were considered available to whoever caught it (McCoy 1940:82). It
is possible, then, that at least some of the cattle bones found in the trash pit at
41BX2068 were from hunted animals.
In any case, the near-absence of head and lower foot bones shows that the
pit was not used to dispose of waste from the early phases of cattle butchery. The
presence of several head and foot bones of pigs shows that pigs might have been
slaughtered at the site, although it is possible that these bones, which are considered
waste on cows, were purchased in the form of pigs feet and hog jowls.
Conclusion
The bones found at 41BX2068 were probably deposited within a relatively
short time, as there was little evidence of the bones being weathered. The identified
bones are largely bovid, almost certainly all cattle (Bos taurus), with some pig and
very few other identified genera. The bovids were butchered in a way that was similar
to what had been common in America since at least the mid-nineteenth century,
but evidence of final cuts to create the steaks, chops, and roasts with which we are
familiar today, and that were commonly made by professional butchers during the

Appendix A: Analysis of Vertebrate Faunal Remains from 41Bx2068
latter part of the nineteenth century, was not often seen in this collection. While
not true of every bone, many showed evidence of haphazard cutting, with many
different thicknesses of cut. This suggests that the butcher was not a professional,
even though the general outline of common butcher practices were followed. The
near-absence of head and lower foot bones makes it clear that this was not where
slaughtered animals were initially processed.
