AN HISTORIC INDIAN CACHE IN CLAY
COUNTY
DELEVAN WORSHAM 0ZEE

In September 1949 my two brothers Will and John, and
I, were exploring an eroded badland area 6 miles west of
Henrietta and 1f2 mile north of Turkey Creek. Will observed
a concentration of glass and shell beads eroding from a spot
about 4 feet above the base of a 50-foot escarpment. There
were fragments of cloth and bits of animal pelt with brown
hair which suggested a buffalo robe or garment. A round
silver buckle was found, 2% inches in diameter, and nine
brass or copper buttons, badly corroded but perhaps round
in shape originally (Plate 42) . Cloth impressions indicate
that the buttons may once have been cloth-covered. There
was also one ounce of powdered cinnabar and some small
cinnabar ore fragments.

On subsequent visits we were able to collect additional
quantities of loose beads in the soil. The final tally was as
follows: six tubular shell beads made from conch-shell columnellae, about 4 inches long; 12 extra large blue glass
beads; 700 medium-size glass beads, blue, white, and variegated; 3,396 small round glass beads, mostly white, with
some blue and a few red; several faceted glass beads (Plate
42).
No bones of any sort were discovered. No stones were
near this particular spot. If our find was once a stonecovered grave, the stones had slumped far down the slope .

Objects from historic cache in Clay County. The silver buckle,
2112 inches in diameter, is in center. Nine brass or copper buttons
are dispersed as follows : three near left edge, three near right
edge, one at top center, and two adjacent to buckle. Six tubular
shell beads appear: four set diagonally inside the four corners,
and two horizontally at top. Twelve extra large blue glass beads
appear in lower center, while dark, faceted, beads are interspaced
b etween plain w hite ones on the same string.
