Report #310
May 2014
Texas Antiquities Permit #6708

Abstract
Klotz Associates of Houston, Texas contracted with Tierras Antiguas Archaeological
Investigations to conduct a cultural resources survey of 700 linear meters of road right-of-way
on the outskirts of the city of Boerne, in Kendall County, Texas. The total Area of Potential
Effect is 700 meters long x 45 meters wide, for a total of 7.78 acres. Texas Antiquities Permit
#6708 was issued in order to proceed with the archaeological investigations.
Tierras Antiguas conducted a thorough pedestrian survey and dug 17 shovel tests on May 23 and
25, 2014, resulting in the discovery of no evidence of either prehistoric or historic cultural
materials. In addition, no potentially historic structures were observed along the right-of-way.
As such, Tierras Antiguas recommends that construction of the Herff Road expansion project
should be allowed to proceed as currently designed. The project should be considered as having
“no effect” on any properties considered as eligible for nomination to the National Register of
Historic Places or inclusion in the State Archeological Landmarks Program, and as such, the
project should be allowed to proceed without further archaeological work. However, if any
cultural resources are encountered during construction, work should immediately be halted in
the vicinity until such finds are examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified
archaeological consultant, and by the Texas Historical Commission.
No artifacts were collected and curated during this project.

Introduction
Klotz Associates of
Houston, Texas is the
lead agency for the 700meter improvement and
expansion of Herff
Road on the edge of
Boerne, but within the
Kendall County
jurisdiction. As such,
Klotz is responsible for
ensuring
the
requirements for
cultural assessments
would be conducted in a
professional compliance
manner. At the request
of Klotz, Tierras
Archaeological
Investigations (TAAI)
conducted a cultural
resources survey of the
Project Area (PA) on
May 23 and 25, 2014.

Figure 1. Location of the Project Area and Kendall County.

The Kendall County
project (Figures 1-3)
was funded by a bond
package approved by
Kendall County citizens
in May 2011. Based
upon a Scope of Work
and Antiquities Permit
Application, the Texas
Historical Commission
issued Permit #6708,
authorizing the cultural
resources survey.
In addition to a surface
survey, Tierras
Antiguas excavated 17
shovel tests. The survey Figure 2. Location of the Project Area in south-central

Project Setting
Geology and Soils
The Project Area is located on Lower Cretaceous aged Edwards Limestone (Ked) (Figure 4).
Medium gray to grayish brown, fine to coarse-grained chert can be found in abundance in the
Edwards formation, formed over 66 million years ago, and ranging from 300 to 500 feet in
thickness (Barnes 1982; Judson and Kauffman 1990; Spearing 1991). Along the creeks are
Holocene-age fluvatile terrace deposits (Qt), commonly found along streams adjacent to the
Edwards Plateau. These are made up of sand, silt, and clay, with being limestone, dolomite, and
chert (Barnes 1982).
As shown in Figure 5, there are two different soil types within the Herff Road project area that
offer varying depths, sedimentation and deposition rates, and Oakalla silty clay loam represents
Menger Creek alluvium. As such, soil classifications and origins likewise imply the potential
for the preservation of intact cultural resources to exist. Table 1 lists the soils that are mapped
within the project area (Dittemore and Hensell1981; Websoil 2014).

of Herff Road,
Menger Creek is a first order tributary of Cibolo Creek. Menger Creek crosscuts through the
western portion of the PA, and is subject to flash flooding during locally heavy thunderstorms.
Following a recent rain, standing water was present over limestone bedrock during our
investigations in May 2014 (Figure 6).
Climate, Flora, Fauna, and Raw Materials
The project area lies within the Edwards Plateau physiographic region of Texas, and in an area
of southern Kendall County where the Native American groups who occupied it were
advantageously able to exploit an ecotone encompassing riverine, upland, and semi-arid adapted
plants and animals. The Edwards Plateau, with elevations reaching 2,250 ft above mean sea level
(amsl) in northern Gillespie County (Allison et al. 1975:76), is a hilly region, gradually sloping
5

to the southeast, and ending in the escarpment running across the middle of the sub-region
(Figure 7). The most common flora observed on the plateau include juniper (Juniperus ashei),
6

plateau live oak (Quercus fusiformis), Texas persimmon (Diospyros texana), honey mesquite
(Prosopis glandulosa), and agarita (Berberis trifoliata) (Blair 1950:112; Van Auken 1988:45;
Simpson 1988). Due to overgrazing by livestock and restricted range fires, much of the plateau
has been overtaken by juniper in modern times (Buechner 1944:703-704; Van Auken 1993:199210).
The Balcones Escarpment separates the Edwards Plateau from the lower blackland prairies to
the east. It is a fault zone, consisting of blocky limestone, chalk, shale, and marl. The escarpment
slopes to the southeast from about 700-1,000 feet above mean sea level (Taylor et al. 1991:119).
The most economically important floral species are riparian nut trees, including oak, walnut, and
pecan that thrive along the rivers and creeks (Van Auken 1988:55). The intertwined diversity
in biotic resources existing along the escarpment provides an ecotone in which humans could
exploit a wide variety of plants and animals from season to season (Collins 1995:366; 2004).
The presence of prehistoric cemeteries found in areas along the escarpment where seasonally
rich food resources such as nut-bearing species, particularly acorn and pecan trees, and prickly
pear tunas may not be just a coincidence (Hall 1995:633-647).
More specifically, the Herff Road project lies in the southern portion of the Edwards Plateau,
in central Texas’s “Hill Country,” so named for its rugged, stream-eroded topography. The
environmental zone can be classified as upland. The annual average rainfall is about 28 inches
(77 centimeters), with 194 growing-season days per year (Dittemore and Hensell 1981:64-65).

Cultural Context and Chronology
Introduction
The Project Area is
located within the
Central
Texas
archaeological region
(Figure 11), and as
such, prehistoric
cultural affinities most
common to the Central
Texas hill country
cultures are often
manifested
in
archaeological sites
along the upper Cibolo
Creek basin. The most
basic chronology of the
Central Texas regions
can be divided into
either: (1) prehistoric
cultural groups with no
specific tribal
affiliation, or; (2)
historically documented
groups with a
designated tribal or Figure 11. Map of Central Texas Archaeological Region (adapted
band name. Before from Black 1989).
Spanish soldiers and Catholic missionaries arrived in Texas, the cultural activities of the groups
of prehistoric Native Americans who inhabited the region can only be surmised from what we
can glean from the archaeological records at undisturbed, and well-documented sites. Historic
cultural groups are those observed firsthand by the Spanish soldiers and priests beginning in the
late 1500s. The Spanish then began recording their encounters by writing the names, numbers,
and living conditions of the many groups of Native Americans who lived in the region.
However, there is a significant transition era between the least archaeologically known
prehistoric cultural groups, and the historic Native Americans that the Spanish documented; the
transition era occurs in the 1500s when Spanish explorers and treasure seekers ventured through
Texas.
The Prehistoric Chronology
Based on research in Texas over the past 70+ years, beginning with professionals from the
University of Texas at Austin, archaeologists have been able to segregate the prehistoric period
in Central Texas into the Paleoindian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods (Figure 12).

Although other archaeologists have made significant foundational contributions to our current
understanding of how past cultures changed through time (e.g., Story 1985; Prewitt 1981), the
most current and widely recognized chronology for Central Texas are those offered by Michael
Collins (1995; 2004).
Paleoindian Period (11,500-8,800 years ago)
With minor differences observed in the archaeological record across the wide expanse of Central
Texas, this period spans the past years estimated at between ca. 11,500 and 8,800 years ago
(Collins 1995:381–383; 2004). Diagnostic artifacts include a unique, fluted, finely flaked, and
blade-shaped spear or dart point called “Clovis”, other stone tools chipped on both sides, and
unique prismatic blade-like flakes systematically knocked off from river cobbles. Archaeologists
have documented Clovis-age sites in Central and South Texas such as killsites, quarries, stone
tool caches, open campsites, ritual sites, and burials (Collins 1995:381–383; 2004). A Folsom
interval follows the Clovis. Folsom artifacts are fairly common in Central and South Texas;
however, no campsites or killsites have been found south of Bexar County (Hester
1995:434–435).
During this 2,700-year Paleoindian period around the project area, the Native Americans we
term as the Paleoindian culture were likely one of small bands of nomadic, big-game hunters
following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons, bison, camel, and
horse that are now extinct in North America (Black 1989). Nevertheless, when big game was
not available, we have archaeological evidence that the Paleoindian peoples supplemented their
diet by eating turtles, tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons (Collins 1995:381; 2004).
Archaic Period (8,000-1,200 years ago)
Primarily, by studying the differences in the stone tools, the diversities in campsites or other
types of sites, the locations of the sites, as well as many other measurable and analytical
observations such as ethnobotanical and faunal remains found at Central Texas archaeological
sites, archaeologists have been able to dissect about 6,000 years of our past into what we
commonly term the “Archaic”. Based on these same aforementioned affinities, the Archaic has
further been defined in terms of the Early Archaic, the Middle Archaic, and the Late Archaic.
Early Archaic (ca. 8,800-6,000 years ago)
The region was most probably occupied by small groups who moved almost constantly during
the Early Archaic period. Archaeologists have observed a distinctive change in projectile point
styles that are unique to this period; they include Early Corner Notched and Early Basal Notched
dart points. Although they were still very much hunters and gatherers, the large animals such as
mammoths that their Paleoindian ancestors had hunted were by this time extinct. To survive,
they capitalized on exploiting the other abundant food resources that Central Texas had to offer
Texas—such as deer, fish, rodents, prickly pear tunas, and various plant bulbs and tubers.
Archaeologists point to the increased numbers of ground stone, firecracked limestone used in
cooking ovens larger in size than normal campfires, and specialized stone processing tools as
evidence that Native Americans refocused their pursuit of foodstuffs (Weir 1976; McKinney
1981; Story 1985; Collins 1995; Hester 1995).

11

Middle Archaic (ca. 6,000-4,000 years ago?)
When this period actually began and ended is always debatable among archaeologists. Some
(e.g., Collins 1995; 2004) see a significant pattern in the archaeological record between 6,000
and 4,000 years ago, but others (e.g., Hester 1995) don’t think the same changes were prevalent
until much later in South Texas - about between 4,500 and 2,400 years ago. Nevertheless, the
climate began changing in Central Texas beginning around 6,000 years ago, and a continuum
of dry climate known as the Altithermal, is believed by some archaeologists to have caused the
Native Americans to gather in larger groups. They gathered in large groups to exploit plant foods
that were more dependable than larger game animals such as bison (Sollberger and Hester
1972:338; Weir 1976:125, 128; Story 1985:40). Archaeologists have found more sites that date
to this period, and in Summer seasons the groups apparently took advantage of the numerous
prickly pear tunas and pads that thrived in the environs of South-Central Texas, as well as deer
and rabbit (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13–15; Collins 1995:38; 20043).
Later, they apparently congregated along the many creeks and rivers in the area to gather the
abundant and nutritional nuts ripening in the Fall (Black 1989). On the Edwards Plateau, they
may have come together to gather acorns, and then built large cooking ovens to steam the tanic
acid out of them to make them edible (Weir 1976). The large cooking ovens were apparently
used over and over again. Whether they were repeatedly used within just a few years or over
several hundred years is still being debated, but the consensus seems to be that they were used
to cook not only deer, but also a great deal of tubers and other plants (Black et al. 1997; Mauldin
et al. 2003). These large cooking ovens which contain mounds of accumulated firecracked rocks
are called “burned rock middens” in the archaeological community, but are sometimes referred
to as “Indian mounds” by artifact collectors.
Late Archaic (4,000-1,200 years ago?)
As with the Middle Archaic period, differences in the traits of Native Americans inhabiting
Central Texas during the Late Archaic period may have occurred over several hundred years.
Whether it was a matter of cultural adaptation or an adaption to the environment is questionable.
In either case, the uniqueness seen in archaeological sites of the two regions imply that change
may have been slower in South Texas than in Central Texas.
Collins (1995; 2004) dates the final interval of the Archaic in Central Texas to approximately
4,000–1,200 years ago. The large cooking ovens which after repeated uses coalesced into burned
rock middens, intensified during the Late Archaic (Black et al. 1997; Mauldin et al. 2003). Some
researchers believe populations increased throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985), while
others feel populations remained the same or fell during this period (Black 1989:30). Although
the Native Americans of Central Texas still sought the abundant acorns, prickly pear, and
riverine plant foods such as nuts, the slightly cooler and moister climate allowed them to pursue
other food goods. Even though by about 1,500 years ago the gregarious, large herds of bison
no longer predominated the now-dwindling grasslands of Central Texas (Dillehay 1974), the
Native Americans still hunted and/or gathered deer and smaller animals such as rabbits, rodents,
fish, and turtles (Black 1989:30).

12

Although farther south, near Brownsville and Rockport, the Native Americans inhabiting those
areas began making pottery about 1,800 years ago, those groups farther to the north, around the
upper Cibolo Creek area, either elected not to make pottery vessels, lacked the skills, or because
of their generally highly nomadic lifestyle, simply elected not to use the easily breakable vessels
until 1,000± years later (Story 1985:45–47). In addition to the uniqueness of Central Texas’
hunter-gatherers not adapting to the use of pottery, archaeologists have also observed a
noticeable change in the styles/types of killing dart points used during the Late Archaic. Dart
points were manufactured to be used with the atlatyl, a spear-like shaft with a dart point attached
to it, and thrown or launched from over the shoulder. It would not be until perhaps 1,200 years
ago that the bow-and-arrow was adapted for use for hunting in the region. Late Archaic dart
points tend to be much smaller than Middle Archaic points, and the most common dart points
that are found within the area are what archaeologists call Ensor and Frio types (Turner and
Hester 1999:114,122).
As with most spectrums of scientific research, there is ongoing speculation amongst professional
archaeologists as to when, and what traits mark a transition between the Late Archaic, huntergatherer practices of Central Texans and the Late Prehistoric peoples who presumably began to
settle down into territorial groups claiming a part of the landscape as their own.
Transitional Archaic (2,300 - 1,300 years ago?)
A clear and abrupt transition of Native Americans adapting or developing the traits that
archaeologists define as being inclusive to the Late Archaic period, separate from the Late
Prehistoric period, around the project area is simply not distinct in the many sites that
archaeologists have been able to excavate and analyze. In effect, some of the same
characteristics that archaeologists see in Late Archaic artifacts and earlier Late Prehistoric
assemblages left behind are nearly identical - or at least transitional in technology and style.
Therefore, some archaeologists prefer to deem this transitional period as the “Terminal, or
Transitional Archaic”, spanning from approximately 1,200 to perhaps as long ago as 2,300 years
ago - depending on where in Central Texas the groups who left behind the now-present
archaeological sites were living (Weir 1976; Hester 1995). Nevertheless, the increased number
of burned rock midden sites that archaeologists have documented in Central Texas, and that date
to this time period, suggest that people returned time and again to the same sites to once again
take advantage of cooking and eating the abundant plants available during this time (e.g.,
Mauldin et al. 2003).
Late Prehistoric Period (ca. 1,250-300 Years Ago)
Although artifacts commonly associated with earlier Late Archaic occupations are also found
on some Late Prehistoric-in-age archaeological sites, archaeologists have documented a distinct
change in projectile point styles that Native Americans began manufacturing about 1,250 years
ago. These stone points suggest that Native Americans in the Central Texas region surrounding
the Herff Road project area adapted the bow-and-arrow as a weapon rather than the shoulderthrown atlatyl with a dart point attached. As such, the stone points devised for killing became
much smaller and streamlined. In layman terminology, the smaller, sleeker shafts arrow shafts
carried an “arrowhead”, instead of a dart point.

13

Archaeologists have found Edwards and Scallorn arrow points dating to the earliest 600+ years
of the period (e.g., Goode 1991:71). Concurrently, excavations by professional archaeologists
have provided evidence that Native Americans began using crude clay pottery vessels made
from local clays, as well as perhaps trading vessels from the South, Southeast Coastal, and
Northeast Texas regions. As with any successful venture, the making of pottery was refined so
that vessels were used more, and the technique of firing became perhaps an art (e.g., Story
1985:45-47; Black 1989:32; Hester 1995; Nickels 2000).
Archaeologists probably know more about the Native Americans who lived in Texas during this
time than any other time in prehistory (Hester 1995). They continued to build large cooking
ovens, or burned rock middens in which they roasted tubers, nuts, and some game animals (see
for example, Mauldin et al. 2003). During this same period, the inhabitants may have increased
their dependence upon bison (Steele and Assad-Hunter 1986:468). Huebner (1991) suggests that
the sudden return of bison to Central Texas resulted from a more xeric climate in the plains north
of Texas, and increased grassiness in the Cross-Timbers and Post Oak Savannah in north Central
Texas, forming a “bison corridor” into the South Texas Plain along the eastern edge of the
Edwards Plateau (Huebner 1991:354–355).
One theory is that perhaps there were not as many people occupying Central Texas and the area
around the Herff Road project area during the Late Prehistoric period (Black 1989:32). We do
know that they began occupying the limestone overhangs and rockshelters created by the many
creeks and rivers cutting into the Balcones Escarpment limestone cliffs. Examples of
rockshelters occupied by Native Americans along the escarpment include Scorpion Cave beside
the Medina River in Medina County (Highley et al. 1978), Classen Rockshelter along Cibolo
Creek in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967), and Timmeron Rockshelter in Hays
County (Harris 1985).
Historic Period
Primarily beginning slightly over 350 years ago, European explorers, entrepreneurs, Catholic
missionaries, and government officials encroached into what is today Central Texas in everincreasing numbers. This transitional end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic
period in both Central Texas is characterized by a continuum of written accounts of European
contact with the numerous indigenous, Native American groups encountered in the region. In
Central Texas, we can be ever grateful to the meticulous writings of the Spanish priests and
government officials for their recording of the names, numbers, and lifeways of the indigenous
groups. Dr. Thomas Hester (1995) is most often credited with recognizing this transitional
period between the Late Prehistoric and the Historic, and labels this largely unknown period as
the “Protohistoric.”
Traveling northward from present-day central Mexico in the 1500s and 1600s, the Spanish
encountered numerous small groups of Coahuiltecans (Campbell 1983; Campbell and Campbell
1985; Hester 1989; John 1975; Newcomb 1961; Swanton 1952). In later years, intrusive groups
such as the Tonkawa, Lipan Apache, and Comanche took over the lands roamed by the
Coahuiltecans (Ewers 1969; Hester 1989; Jones 1969; Kelley 1971; Newcomb 1961, 1993;
Sjoberg 1953a, 1953b).

14

For example, around A.D. 1700, many south Texas Indian groups were being pushed northward
by continual Spanish expansion. But by about 1750, the Apache, adapting to a more Southern
Plains-lifeway style of bison hunting, entered what is today’s Texas from the northwest. Their
incursion was especially rapid because they had acquired horses from the Spaniards (Campbell
and Campbell 1985:27). As if the indigenous groups were not effectively dispersed and
disrupted by the Apaches, the remnants of native American cohesion that previously existed in
Central Texas were even further disrupted by the nomadic, bison-hunting Comanche from the
High Plains of Texas (Campbell 1991:111).
Thus ensued over a century of turmoil for those numerous, but splintered Native American
groups who had established a semi-permanent foothold in Central Texas before the arrival of
the Apache and Comanche. They must have been heavily traumatized and significantly
demoralized over the constant conflicts resulting in death, and the mysterious diseases caused
by the forced continual mixing and remixing among ethnicities from around the regions and the
world (Bolton 1915; Campbell 1991:345; León et al. 1961). Supposedly, there were dozens if
not hundreds of language dialects that were spoken by the earlier inhabitants, but nearly all have
been lost (e.g. Johnson 1994; Johnson and Campbell 1992).
Amidst the turmoil, the Spanish Catholic missions became a refuge for many of the otherwise
dispersed bands and tribes within Texas. By the early 1700s, several missions had been
established, and reestablished within the Nacogdoches and San Antonio areas (Campbell and
Campbell 1985; Chipman 1992; de la Teja 1995; Habig 1968a, 1968b; Hard et al. 1995). Those
that entered the missions did so usually voluntarily, seeking refuge from more powerful, warring
bands or tribes. Others did so because they were starved for food that the protective missions
could offer in seasons of natural destitution. Regardless, the Spanish government saw the
Catholic religious zeal as a means of peaceful conquest in an otherwise untenable, unsettled, and
hostile environment. At the same time, each and every Native American who relied upon support
from the Spanish missions became less of a threat to eventual Spanish domination of the region,
and infiltration by France or other countries (Campbell 1975:2; 1991:346–347).
Although a treaty with the Apaches in 1749 brought peace for a while, Apaches continued to
range over the area between San Antonio and Laredo until the early 1800s, pushed southward
by the invading Comanche who had moved into the Hill Country of Central Texas (Campbell
and Campbell 1985:27; de la Teja 1995:100). In 1785, a peace treaty was agreed to in Santa Fe,
New Mexico between the Spanish Crown and the Comanches. Although the ceremony of this
treaty took place hundreds of miles to the west, its signing signaled the opening of a period of
peaceful coexistence in what is today Bexar County, in which Comanches brought hides, meat,
and tallow to San Antonio to trade for goods and services not available elsewhere, such as
blacksmithing and gun repair (Fehrenbach 1983:221-224; Poyo and Hinojosa 1991:125-126).
In 1821, after a hard-fought rebellion, Mexico gained its national sovereignty from Spain;
including the vast expanse that was to become the Republic of Texas. After only 15 years, the
combined Tejano and Euro-American compatriots rebelled against Mexican rule, and defeated

15

the Mexican army to declare an independent Republic of Texas in 1836. By the 1840s, the city
of San Antonio was well-established as the most progressive and most populated city in the
newly formed Republic.
Apaches continued to range over the area between San Antonio and Laredo until the early 1800s,
pushed southward by the invading Comanche who had moved into the Hill Country of central
Texas (Campbell and Campbell 1985:27). Weary of warfare with the Comanche, a few Apache
were beginning to seek asylum in the missions (McGraw and Hindes 1987:367; West 1904:50).
The newly formed government of Texas gave land grants that were large, consisting of around
5,000 acres for each property, and Spanish cattle ranching became prevalent south and southeast
of San Antonio (Jackson 1986), however the vast expanse west of San Antonio was not settled
until the late 1800s.
Upon winning its independence from Mexico in 1836, a struggling young Republic of Texas
continued the empresario (colonization) system as a means of bringing new families to settle and
develop the land. Earlier grants of huge tracts of land to empresarios such as Stephen F. Austin
Texas, Green DeWitt, Haden Edwards, Sterling Robertson, John McMullen, and others proved
successful in establishing communities in south and east Texas. Around 1840 settlers from
Germany and Alsace-Lorraine, and from other regions of the United States began to flood into
San Antonio and New Braunfels. Many of the Germans moved into the Hill Country to the
north, settling into communities such as Boerne, and raised sheep or cattle (Freeman 1994:5-9).
Under President Sam Houston’s second term in 1842, Henry Fisher, Burchard Miller, and Joseph
Baker petitioned the Republic of Texas for authorization to establish 1,000 families in an area
consisting of over 3 million acres of land between the Colorado and Llano Rivers. Permission
was granted to Fisher and Miller to begin recruiting 600 immigrant families who would be given
640 acres per family, provided they build a cabin and farm 15 acres of fenced land. However,
settlement in the area did not come easy. The objective of luring 600 families (later increased
to 6,000 by the Republic of Texas) could not be accomplished for two principal reasons: (1)
portions of the tract encompassed the hunting grounds of the Comanches who were not about
to relinquish their domain without a fight, and (2) the area was well west of the main San
Antonio – Mexico trade routes (Biesele 1987:76-110).
Following a chain of events that led to the Fisher-Miller Grant being acquired by the
Adelsverein (the Society for the Protection of German Immigrants in Texas), John O.
Muesebach as Commissioner-General of the organization sent a survey party to the San Saba
River area near Menard to investigate the possibilities of mineral wealth and tillable farmland
available within the western portion of the Grant. Well aware that he would be encroaching upon
Comanche territory, he met with a group of Comanche chiefs for three days in March 1847 and
negotiated a treaty of peaceful coexistence with them (King 1967:111-118). Speaking through
an interpreter, Muesebach’s treaty proposal to the Comanche chiefs (from Tiling 1913:100) was
as follows:

16

1. “My countrymen have the permission to go and travel where they please, and no
harm must be done to them, but you must protect them everywhere. On the other
hand, your people can come to our wigwams and cities without fear and can go
wherever they please and shall be protected.”
2. “You the chiefs, and your people will assist us and report to us, when bad men
and redfaces of other tribes steal our horses or intend other felonies, and we shall do
the same, when you are attacked.”
3. I am going to send men with the thing that steals the land (compasses), as the red
men call it, and will survey the whole country of the San Saba as far as the Concho
and other waters, so that we may know the boundaries where we can go and till the
soil. And if you are willing after consultation with your warriors, to make this treaty,

The following May the chiefs finalized the agreement by coming into Fredericksburg to sign the
treaty and collect the money promised them (King 1967:118). Thus, German immigration into
the lands west of San Antonio and Austin began in the 1830s and is fairly well documented. By
the 1840s new routes and trails were being established through the largely unsettled area, due
in part to the desire to reach the gold fields of California. “German immigrants established
Sisterdale in 1847, Tusculum (Boerne) in 1849. Currey’s Creek in 1850, and Comfort in 1854"
(Smryl 1996:1062). Leiding (1992) provides an account of 218 Germans attempting to settle in
all of Texas by 1836, but increasing to 30,000 by 1860.
The 670 square miles (428,800 acres) that comprise modern-day Kendall County (Dittemore and
Hensell:1) was cut out of Kerr and Blanco counties in 1862, and named in honor of George
Wilkins Kendall, a pioneer journalist and sheepman. In 1852 he began raising sheep along the
Nueces River, later moved his flock to near New Braunfels, and then to Post Oak Springs near
Boerne (Cutrer 1996).

Site Types That Could be Expected Along the Herff Road Right-of-Way
Prehistoric Open Campsites
Most numerous among the sites recorded in Kendall County are prehistoric open campsites
ranging in age from the Paleoindian period through the Historic period (see Figure 12). Some
of these represent a single campfire where a very small group of Native Americans may have
camped for one night. Others are very large, covering very extensive areas representing large
groups of people that stayed for long periods, perhaps seasonally, with ancestral groups
returning to these same campsites over a period of several thousands of years. Cultural remains
to be found at these large campsites include among other items, an abundance of fire-cracked
rocks representing multiple hearths, a wide variety of chipped stone tools and the lithic debris

17

that results from making them, ground and smoothed stones used to grind nuts and seeds, faunal
remains from terrestrial and aquatic animals consumed, bone tools, pottery sherds, and mussel
and snail shells. Open campsites occur in all types of environments, whether that be in a plush
riverine environment that offered a wide variety banquet of plant and animal foodstuffs, or in
the uplands away from flowing water sources. Seasonally, the upland grasses, shrubs, and cacti
offered a different food source that could be exploited such as various grass seeds, mesquite
beans, prickly pear pads and tunas, and agave hearts. In addition, at various times, bison were
known to graze on the northern South Texas Plains, and were highly sought after for use as food,
hides, and bone tools (Dillehay 1974).
Depending upon the integrity of these open campsites, archaeologists and the Texas Historical
Commission consider these as perhaps the most significant types of sites in regard to their ability
to contribute to our understanding of Central Texas prehistory. A few of the desired ingredients
that can indicate significance include cultural material that is buried beneath the surface in a
well-preserved, stratified, and relatively undisturbed context. Although these situations most
frequently occur within stratified terrace deposits adjacent to streams, they can also occur in
upland settings where the landscape has been generally stable through time. Other ingredients
that archaeologists look for in potentially significant campsites include good organic
preservation in the form of charcoal and/or charred plant remains, faunal preservation,
temporally diagnostic stone tools or ceramics, and intact features such as hearths.
Prehistoric Lithic Scatters or Procurement Sites
Lithic scatters are the next most common type of archaeological site that could be expected
along the Herff Road right-of-way. These sites simply represent the chipped stone debris and
broken tools that were left behind when Native Americans made new tools or re-sharpened their
old ones. The general absence of fire-cracked rocks and other cultural material normally found
at open campsites suggest that they did not camp there, or remain there for any extended period
of time ( However, small camp fires may have been used to heat-treat chert or quartzite cobbles
to make them more knappable). Yet, they were drawn to these isolated locales because of the
natural outcroppings or surface exposures of good quality raw material such as chert or quartzite
cobbles. Examples of chipped stone most commonly found at these sites include cobbles with
one or two flakes removed, called ‘tested cobbles’. That is, the Native Americans knew from
experience the quality of stone that could most easily be flaked and reduced for stone tool
production, so they ‘tested’ the cobble to judge whether it was usable or not. If the quality was
judged to be inferior, then the cobble was tossed aside. That is why the majority of tested
cobbles found on these sites are of poor quality, coarse-grained material. While the finished
stone tool products are carried away from these sites, what remains are those tools broken during
the manufacturing process, and the thousands of pieces of debitage in the form of flakes and
angular debris. Also unique to lithic scatters where large cobbles are present are snapped ‘quarry
blanks’. These are simply cobbles flakes on both sides, reducing the cobble into a transportable
‘blank’ that can be used to further reduce it and make finished stone tools from the flakes taken
off of it. The unbroken quarry blanks are usually not found on these sites because they have been
carried off, presumably to areas of south Texas where raw material is not readily available. The
snapped or broken quarry blanks are of little or no use, so they are discarded and left behind.

18

Lithic scatters range in age from the Paleoindian through the Historic periods and can be found
on any landscape setting where gravels or cobbles have been exposed. Notably, gravel outcrops
that were exposed to the surface a few hundred or thousand years ago could be deeply buried
today, and the opposite could also be true; it all depends on the terrain setting and the dynamics
of landscape evolution through time. Most lithic scatters in Kendall County have been
documented along upper stream terraces abutting the eroded upland slopes.
Prehistoric Quarries
Prehistoric quarries can also can range in age from the Paleoindian through Historic periods, but
differ from lithic scatters in that at those sites Native Americans exploited loose gravels, but at
times they specifically sought quarry sites where raw material such as cherts or quartzites were
not yet freed from their parent geologic formation, and they had to be ‘quarried’. These types
of sites are rare in south Texas for two reasons: 1) the geological exposures generally do not
present themselves, and 2) throughout Texas, even in central Texas, it is much easier to pick up
gravels from the surface than to try to mine them from hard rock. Quarried and chipped stone
remains likely to be found at these sites include large chunks of angular cherts or quartzites, as
well as parent material detritus, and flaking debris. Snapped quarry blanks can also be expected.
Because of the many limestone formations with chert inclusive gravels prehistoric quarries or
procurement sites in Central Texas are not infrequent.
Prehistoric Burned Rock Middens
Burned rock middens result from a series of multiple-use earth ovens that were constructed
much like modern-day roasting pits are dug into the earth for roasting a pig. With repetitive uses,
as the larger rocks that serve as heating elements in the earthen pit fracture and thus become less
effective as a thermal source, they are ‘pitched out’ around the edge of the pit. As the pit
becomes unusable, another is dug near by, and the procedure repeated. Over time, these multiple
pits and the ‘pitched out’ fire-cracked rocks coalesce together, obscuring each pit as
indiscernible. (For a full discussion of the formation of burned rock middens and their
documented presence in Texas, see Leach and Bousman 2001; Leach et al. 2001; Mauldin et al.
2003).
Prehistoric Burial and Cemetery Sites
Although not common, isolated prehistoric burials and cemeteries have been documented in
Central Texas. Individual and isolated burials have been found in association with open
campsites in both upland settings as well as in alluvial terraces along streams, within rock shelter
overhangs, and within limestone sinkholes.
Historic Sites
As discussed above in the Cultural Chronology section above, Spanish entradas with
government officials and Catholic priests began recording their encounters with local Native
American groups as early as the late 1500s. However, as yet there are no documents discovered
that would suggest a permanent historic presence within the Herff Road and Kendall County
areas until the mid-1800s (Smryl 1996:1062). The most common historic site types to be
encountered are related to ranching and farming endeavors, or small communities from the 19th

19

and 20th centuries. Site types most commonly include farmsteads or ranches with corrals,
cisterns, chimney and foundation remains from both main houses and outbuildings, related trash
dumps, an occasional family burial or cemetery, school houses, churches, community buildings,
and industry-related structures or construction projects. In general, the area has been historically
used predominantly as ranchland pasture, with no development other than associated ranching
activities such as windmills, stock tanks, corrals, and sparsely scattered outbuildings.

Previous Archaeological Work in the Area
As early as the 1930s, A.T. Jackson from The University of Texas at Austin began visiting
Kendall County archaeological sites, making maps, and compiling notes about the sites. It
wasn’t until many years later that a handful of sites were recorded in the 1960s. Site recordings
increased significantly beginning in the 1970s, due mostly to the establishment of the Center for
Archaeological Research (CAR) at the University of Texas at San Antonio in 1973. As the
Center’s first director, Dr. Tom Hester sought to foster a hand-in-hand relationship among
amateur collectors, landowners, and professional archaeologists. As such, he was instrumental
in establishing the Southern Texas Archaeological Association (STAA) in 1973, a dedicated
bunch of individuals who were (and still are) committed to documenting and preserving
archaeological sites throughout Central and South Texas. In more recent years, the Hill Country
Archaeological Association based in Kerrville has been active in the area.
While we will never know for sure how many archaeological sites have been destroyed, or how
many still remain in Kendall County, we do know that as of May 2014, professional and
avocational archaeologists have managed to document 219 sites. Of those, 100 are prehistoric
open campsites, and 68 are prehistoric lithic scatters or procurement sites. Burned rock middens
have been documented on 32 sites, and there are six rockshelters with intensive human
occupation remains. One of those shelters has nine steps carved into a rock face leading to it, and
another has carved petroglyphs. Notably, two prehistoric burial sites have been recorded in the
county. The first features burials in a limestone sinkhole, with a burned rock midden on the
surface above. The second has a series of above-ground rock cairn burials. The 16 historic sites
and components recorded thus far include mostly mid- to late 19th century stone farm and ranch
structures, but also a stone dam for a mill operation, trash scatters, a local cemetery, and a 20th
century railroad bed. There are also two State Archaeological landmarks documented within the
county. The first is the historic Kendall Courthouse and Jail in Boerne, and the second is the
Treue der Union Monument now located in the Corpus Christi Museum of Science and History
(Atlas 2014).
Archaeological Atlas Site Results
A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Atlas of Texas Archaeological sites (Atlas 2014)
indicated that although the proposed right-of-way had not been subjected to a formal cultural
resources survey, there are six archaeological sites in close proximity to the Herff Road project.
Their locations are shown in Figure 13, and they are briefly described in Table 2.

20

Of particular note, is the survey conducted by Tierras Antiguas of the initial alignment of Herff
Road as it was to cross Menger Creek some 300 meters to the southeast. During that 2011
survey, three backhoe trenches were excavated on the approaches to Menger Creek, resulting
in the discovery of no cultural materials (Nickels 2011).

Project Goals and Methods
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with limited shovel testing and backhoe trenching.
The topics addressed were site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The
prehistoric theoretical framework is structured around patterns of settlement, mobility,
subsistence, and social systems for the Central Texas region. The historic framework is
structured around the settlement along Cibolo Creek and the Central Texas Hill Country as
documented in the earliest written accounts by Spanish priests and government representatives,
through Mexican and Republic of Texas sovereignty, and into the Texas Statehood period.
The goals of the project were to:
1)
locate and record cultural locations and sites in the project area using a
systematic survey methodology;
2)
quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy; and,
3)
place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

Methods and Levels of Effort
In accordance with Texas Historical Commission (THC) and Council of Texas Archeologists
(CTA) Archaeology Survey Standards, a systematic and thorough pedestrian survey of the 700meter linear right-of-way was conducted. Surface visibility ranged from 30 to 100 percent along
the right-of-way. A total of 17 shovel tests were placed in a systematic pattern along the right-ofway (see Cover Photo and Figure 14). The results of shovel testing were fully documented on
Shovel Test forms, and are described in Appendix A. The shovel tests were dug in 20-centimeter
(cm) levels, and all sediments were screened through 1/4-inch wire mesh (Figure 15).

22

Particular attention was paid to both cutbank exposures of Menger Creek, as well as numerous
animal burrows and backdirt piles. Following our designed research plan, any artifacts recovered
from shovel tests or the surface were not to be collected, but were to be placed either in the
upper 10 cm of the backfilled shovel tests, or on the surface where they were observed and
documented.

Results of the Investigations
Surface Examination and Shovel Testing
Typically shallow, sandy clay and clay soils with fragmented limestone bedrock were
encountered in the upland, eastern portion of the ROW, while expected deeper silty loams were
present along the lower, southern portions of the ROW in closer proximity to Menger Creek.
Surface visibility ranged from approximately 50-percent in the eastern, upland portion of the
right-of-way (ROW) to about 30 percent on the cultivated terraces along Menger Creek. In the
immediate area on the slopes of Menger Creek fragmented limestone bedrock was prevalent (see
for example, Figure 18).
No evidence of prehistoric or historic cultural materials was observed either on the surface, or
within the 17 shovel tests (see Appendix A), numerous animal burrows and backdirt, or within
the cutbanks along Menger Creek.

Historic Archival Research
During our May 2014 investigations, we observed no evidence of historic cultural material
neither within the pipeline right-of-way, nor were there any potentially historic structures within
100 meters of the right-of-way, to include the TxDOT tie-in at Highway 87.
A search for historic aerial photographs and topographic maps reveals that the 700-meter Project
Area was apparently in an area that warranted little attention. However, a 1943 topographic map
discovered in the Perry Castañeda Library at the University of Texas (Maps 1943) indicates that
no historic structures were present along the proposed Herff Road right-of-way at that time
(Figure 19). In 1952 and 1963, aerial photographs (USGS Earth Explorer 2014a, b) once again
show no historic structures within or adjacent to the proposed right-of-way (Figures 20 and 21).
Finally, a 1964 topographic map (Figure 22) reveals no indication of historic structures (Maps
1964).
In sum, our on-the ground survey and archival research provided no indication that historic
structures existed within or adjacent either along the Herff Road right-of-way, or near the
TxDOT tie-in at Highway 87.

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A thorough pedestrian survey of the surface that offered up to >90% visibility within the 700meter Project Area was conducted, along with the excavation of 17 shovel tests. No evidence
of prehistoric or historic cultural materials was observed either on the surface, or within the 17
shovel tests, numerous animal burrows and backdirt, or within the cutbanks along Menger
Creek.
Accordingly, we recommend that construction of the Herff Road Project should be allowed to
proceed as currently designed. The project should be considered as having “no effect” on any
properties considered as eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or
inclusion in the State Archeological Landmarks Program, and as such, the project should be
allowed to proceed without further archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are
encountered during construction, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such
finds are examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological
consultant, and by the Texas Historical Commission.
