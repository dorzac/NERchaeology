Abstract
Personnel from Coastal Environments, Inc., (eEl) conducted a cultural resources survey
and preliminary sile assessment within six right-of-way (ROW) areas along a 12.2-mi (19.6km) stretch of SH 48 between Port Isabel and Brownsville in southern Cameron County, Texas.
Most of this part of the route is to be upgmdcd to a four-lane divided highway under CSJ No.
0220Â·07-DSI. The research was carried oul in late August and September 2004, under contract

to the Environmental Affairs Di vision of the Texas Department of Transportation (rxDOT).
Overall, the six ROW areas covered 129.5 ac (52.4 ha). Examination within each of the six
areas concentrated on existing portions of high ground, where previous research in the region
had indicated a propensity for site occurrence. This high ground mainly consisted of clay
dunes or lomas, but in one instance included the natural levee of a relict Rio Grande channel.
Three primary search techniques were employed: (I) careful visual sulface inspection; (2)
excavation of 55 Gradall trenches/profile cuts, coupled with screening of soi l from selected
strata indicative of buried A horizons or potential buried A horizons; and (3) excavation of 95
shovel tests or hand-dug profile cuts, and subsequent screening of the fill from each test or cuI.
Only a very small portion of one previous ly recorded archaeological site (41CF I59)
was found within the ROW of one of the survey areas. This si te had been known since 191 8,
when it was examined and collected by A. E. Anderson , but it was not officially recorded in the
state site files until the late 1990s when past widening of SH 4 8 cut into part of the natuml levee
upon which the site rests. Although an extensive portion of the site may remain intact beyond
the limits of the ROW, the widening project removed virtually all of the site within the ROW.
Only a very narrow strip of mixed earth and shell midden, measuring ca. I m wide by aoout 20
m long, exists today at the extreme northern edge of the ROW. Thus, although the si te area
outside the ROW will need to be assessed archacologically shou ld any future projects occur in
that area, the portion of the site remaining within the ROW is considered too limited in scope to
be worthy of additional research. Accordingly, that part of site 41CFl59 within the SH 48
ROW is not considered e ligible for inclusion in the National Regi ster of Hi storic Places.
The survey also recorded the remains of three new archaeological sites (4 1CF 189 to
191) situated just beyond the area of potential effects. Two of these site locations were
provided to the survey crew by a local avocational archaeologist, while the third was discovered
during the survey. Since all were located adjacent to the ROW, they were examined briefly to
make sure that none of their cu ltural remains extended into the project area. One site
(4ICF189) consists of three (possi bly four) discrete oyster deposits situated atop a portion of
one of the area's lomas, while the other two sites include scattered cultural material along the
edge of another loma (41CFI90) and a probable shell midden composed of half-naked pen
shells and oysters (41 CF191 ) located atop another part of the same loma. As these three s ites
are located beyond the limits of the current ROW, no material collections were obtained. None
will be affected by the proposed construction project.
Lastly, all photographs, notes, and culluml material obtained during the survey from site
41 CFI59 will be curated at the Center for Archaeological Research at The University of Texas
at San Antonio.

This report presents the results of a cult ural resources survey conducted in six different right-ofway (ROW) areas along a 12.2-mi (l9.6-km) stretch of Texas State Highway (SH) 48 in southern
Cameron County, Texas. The survey was conducted by Coasta l Environments, Inc., (CEI) under
contract with the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) (Contract No. 573XXSAOO8,
Work Authorization No. 573 12 SAOO8) and was performed as a means to identify any existing
cu ltural resources that might occur withi n the highway ROW and to assess the potential for these
resources to be included in the National Register of Hi storic Places. The area examined during
the project covered a lotal 129.5 ac (52.4 ha),
Fieldwork began on August 26. 2004, with a preliminary two-day visit to the project area . The
actual survey commenced on September I, 2004, and lasted until September 19, 2004. The
initial field crew cons isted of Richard A. Weinstein (principal Investigator) of CEl's Baton Rouge,
Louisiana, office; Bruce M. Albert (Sen ior Crew Chief) of Denton, Texas; Laurid Bro ugh ton
(Senior Archaeological Field Technician) of CEI's Corpus Chri sti, Texas. office; and James
Gillentine (Junior Archaeological Field Technician) of Dallas, Texas (Figure P-I ). Due to other
commitments, both Broughton and Gi llentine had to leave the project about midway through the
survey. Broughton was replaced by Pollyanna A. Held of CEI's Gu lfport, Mississippi. office.
In addition to the field crews, several Olher ind ivid ual s should be acknowledged for their help .
Mary Jo Galindo, of TxDOT's Environmental Affairs Division, oversaw the projcct for TxDOT
and served as liaison between TxDOT' s main office in Austin, Texas, and its district office in
Pharr. Texas. Dr. Galindo visited the project area during the two-day preliminary inspection of
the area and was instrumental in resolvin g many of the ROW questions that arose during the
course of the survey . Members of the Pharr Di strict also aided greatly in the project. Included
were Mark Iglesias, Environmental Coordinator, who visited the survey crew on several occasions
and answered questions concern ing the exact width of the ROW in certain areas; Ruben Ruiz,
Envi ronmental Specia list, who was on hand dail y during the first 10 days of the project to answer
many of the crew's questions and who prov ided copies of the highway project plans to CEI; Mike
Mendoza, Uti lity Coordinator of the San Benito Office, who offered information on buried gas
lines adjacent to the ROW in one of the survey areas; and Jose M. Hinojosa, Maintenance Section
Supervisor of the Brownsville Office, who provided the Gradall and operator for use during the
trenching part of the project. Lastly, Basi li o Aguilar, of the Brownsville Office, served as Gradall
ope rator for the project. Without the careful and dedicated work of Mr. Agui lar, the trenching
part of the projcct would not have been conducted in such an efficient and successful manner.
Several members of the Port of Brownsville were helpful during the course of the survey. Hector
J. Lopez, Director of Engineering Services. and Victor Martinez, Engineer, visited the survey crew
in the field at one of the survey locations a nd prov ided relevant copies of the 1932 plans of the
Brownsville Ship Channel showing the region prior to canal and highway construction.
Special mention should be made of Mike Kr.lywonski of Laguna Vista, Texas, who is the leading
avocational archaeologist in the Port IsabeUBrownsvi lle area. Mr. Krzywooski took time out of
his busy sc hedule to direct the survey crew to several sites located adjacent to the project area that
had oat yet been reported to the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL). He also
took the crew on a preliminary visit to the one known site that fell partly within the highway ROW
(site 41CF159) and provided valuable infonnation on the locale and its artifacts. Mr. Krzywonksi
also graciously agreed to allow part of his large collection of artifacts to be photographed for the
current study, and he helped identify several of the shellfish species collected during the course
of the survey. Without Mr. Krzywonski 's help, much useful information would not have been
included in the present report.
Wi ll iam (Skye) Wagner. a Ph .D. student at The University of Texas at Austin, who is study ing the
relationship between sites of the Brownsville Complex and the Huastecan area of Mexico. was
extremely helpful both before and after the fi eld work. Mr. Wagner directed the survey crew to

Mr. Kryzwonski and also provided preliminary information on site 41CF159 and artifacts from
this locale in the A. E. Anderson collection at TARL. Mr. Wagner later provided a detailed list of
the Anderson artifacts from 41CF159, and he subsequently took photographs of many of these
items for use in the current report.
Once the field investigations were completed, work on the report began. As can be seen in the
remainder of the study, most of the chapters were authored by Weinstein. Ms. Held analyzed the
shellfish remains collected during the project and provided tables listing the various species
encountered. She also compiled the site information needed to acquire official state site numbers
for new sites found during the survey and submitted site forms to TARL. Finally, Ms. Held
organized all of the GPS data and prepared many of the artifact photographs presented in the
report. Robert A. Ricklis, Director of CEl's Corpus Christi office, offered numerous suggestions
throughout the course of the project and helped author the background sections on the natural
setting and the archaeology of the region presented in Chapters 3 and 4, respectively. Curtis
Latiolais served as draftsman for the project and was responsible for most of the illustrations and
maps, while Cherie Schwab served as editor and report layout specialist. Beta Analytic, Inc., of
Miami, Florida, processed the radiocarbon sample obtained at site 41CF159.

This report presents the resuhs of a cuhuroll resources survey of six separate right-of-way (ROW)
areas. idenli fied as Survey Areas A. B, C. D. F,
and G. situated along a 12.2-mi-long (I 9.6-kmlong) stretch o f Stale Highway (S H) 4 8, located

landforms had been identified pri or to the su rvey
by archaeolog ists working at T xDOT. T hey consist of low. elongated, usually narrow hills that are
locally known as clay dunes or lomas. Such lo mas
often provided the only high ground in what otherwise was a very fl at landscape. Due to thi s. they
served as favored locaiions for aborig inal camps
and occupation areas (Anderson 1932; Prew iu
1974). Altho ug h already disturbed to some extent

As wil l be secn. the actual s urvey utilized three
primary search methods: (I) visual inspection of
the exposed ground surface in each area. (2) exca~
vation of trenches andlor profil e cuts into the lomas
in five of the six areas, and (3) systematic shovel
tests in two of the areas where trenches either were
not allowed or deemed unnecessary. These fie ld
invest igations also were coupled with a review of
artifact collections peni nem to sites along the SH

A seventh area, E, also was to be part of the survey. It
originally was defined when it was thought that new
ROW would be acquired adjacent to site 41 CF I 0 I. Subsequently, it was determined that no new ROW was beÂ·
ing acquired at this location and Area E was deleted from
the survey.

lettcr to that effect was submitted to the Te",as Historical
Commission (THC) for its concurrence (G.R.D. Price and
N. Kenm otsu to J. Brusclh, October 15. 1998, EnvironÂ·
mental Affairs Division. Texas Department ofTransparÂ·
lalion, Auslin). The THC agreed w ith the TxDOT recÂ·
ommendation.

discovery by local avocational archaeologists during th c
widening ofSH 48 in 1995 (see Figure 4--56 on page 73
of this report). Unfortunately, although local collectors
documented the site, no one notified the TxDOT archaeological staff until 1998. The su bsequent TxDOT survey
did not encounter any cultural materials al the location
(see Figure 4-57 on page 73 of this report for an indication of how the site was obscured after construction). Accordingly, no further work was deemed necessary and a

In 2004, the TxOOT archaeological staff re-evaluated the
current widening project (from the Shrimp Basin nonheast to SH 100) and, as noted. selected five arcas (survey
areas A, B, C, F, and G) for archacological survey based
on thc high potcntial for lomas to contain buried intact
cultural resources (based on infonnation from local collectors, and recent data acquired at nearby site 41 CF 136),
and because new ROW was being acquired adjacent to
site 41 C F8. The area around site 41CFI59 was included
in the survey and designated Survey Area D.

C hapter 2: Natural Setting
Richard A. We instei n and Robert A. Ricklis
The survey area crosses through part of the Rio
Grande Delta, specifically that part of the delta
that fonned duri ng Holocene times (post 12,000
years ago) (Figure 2-1). Topography is low and
nearly flat, with the significant exception of the
many clay dunes or lomas that are found along
shorelines of shallow lagoons and their assoc iated

sion by wave action reworked the deltaic lobes.
pushing them landward. Wave action and
longshore drift combined to deposit near-shore
sediments that formed south Padre Island, which
ultimately coalesced with northern Padre Island
to largely isolate lower Laguna Madre from the
open Gulf of Mexico.

wind-tidal flats (i.e., Bahia Grande, San Martin
Lake, and Laguna Madre). The surrounding level
terrain, generally around 5 ft (1.5 m) or less above
mean sea level (MSL) is part oflhe extensive sedimcnt deposit that comprises the Rio Grande Delta.
The many lomas are long, relatively narrow geologic features that are adjacent and paral lcl to the
lagoonal shorelines. Many rise some 15 to 30 fl
(4.610 9.1 m) above the su rrounding land surface.

Geologic Backgr ound
The survey area today is the result of physical processes that have operated in the region since the
end of the Pleistocene. During Ihe last glacial
maximum, ca. 20,000 years before present (BP),
global sea level was loo m or more be low its
present position, and the Gulf shore line was some
80 km east of its presenllocation. The Rio Grande
thus flowed in a broad valley eastward across the
now-submerged continental shelf (Brown et a!.
1980: 18). As sea level rose duri ng the Holocene
(after ca. 12,000 BP). the lower reaches of the Rio
Grande valley became inundated by tmnsgress ive
marine waters, ultimately formi ng a lo ng
embayment that extended some 45 km inland from
the present shoreline.
By the middle Holocene (ca. 7000 to 5000 BP),
the Rio Grande was depositing alluvial sed iments
and infilling the embayed valley. It eventually
created prograding delta lobes that, at their maximum ex tent, reached some 15 km east of the
present shoreli ne (Brown et al. 1980: 19). At least
three major delta lobes have been identified, with
one (apparently the youngest) centered along the
TexaslMexican border in the area of the present
project (B rown et a!. 1980:19-20). As sea level
reached its modem position by ca. 3,000 BP, ero-

Simultaneously, the increasing sediment load of
the Rio Gnl.Ode Delta and near-shore marine sed iments resulted in land subsidence and flooding of
low-lying mainland areas, such as the lagoonal flats
surrounding and including Bahia Grande. Lowenergy sedimentation within the flats resulted in
the accumulation of fine-grained clay and silt.
When coupled with cyclical periods of aridity plus
the area's frequently sustained southeasterly winds,
a portion of the clays and silts from these flats was
transported landward and gradually formed the
numerous lomas thaI presently demarcate lagoonal
shorelines (Price and Kornicker 1961 :245; Brown
et a!. 1980:21,23). This process has been ongoing for several thousand years, resulting in lomas
that can be anywhere from a few hundred to thousands of years in age .
Significantly, Holocene sea-level rise was probably not a smooth, gradual process but rather occurred in a stepwise pattern. with periods of relatively mpid rise alternating with times of relatively
stable sea level (e.g., Curray 1960; Frazier 1974;
Paine 1990; Anderson and Thomas 1991). Geoarchaeological data from the central and upper
Texas coasts suggests that periods of relatively
stable sea levelled to estuarine sed imentation,
the creation of broad vegetated shallows, and high
biotic productivity conducive to intensified human
occupation and exploitation of the shoreline environment (Ricklis 1995; Ricklis and Blum 1997).
Presently. there are insufficient data to detennine
if an analogous pattern operated over time on the
lower Texas coast and the Rio Grande Delta area,
partly due to a paucity of dated archaeological sites
and partly from a lack of systematic geomorphic
and geoarchaeological investigations in the delta
area.

Project Area Surface Geology

specifically, five of the six survey areas occur atop
clay dunes (lomas) that consist of Point Isabel clay
loam (Figures 2-3 to 2-6). This is a gent ly sloping
to sloping soi l that has slow permeabi lity and rapid
runoff that can causes severe erosion (Williams et
al. 1977:25-26). A Iypical soil profile exhibits an
upper A horizon about 35 cm thick , underlain by
B, Ab, and Bb horizons to a depth of ca. 1.7 m
(Williams et al. 1977:25). Old buried A horizons
occur within the lomas at varying depths and represent buried surface layers that once occurred alOp
the lomas (see Williams el al. 1977:Figure 4).

Figure 2-2 illustrates the surface geology of the
project area, as derived from the Environme ntal
Geology Map of Brown et al. (1980). As can be
seen. SH 48 cuts through (I) wind-tidal flats composed of sand and mud that are located adjacent to
Laguna Madre and Bahia Gnmde, (2) floodbasins
of overbank mud and silt situated to the east and
west of San Martin Lake. (3) clay dunes (lomas)
scattered throughout the area. (4) disrributary sands
and silts, including natural-levee and crevassesplay deposits, that occur at the eastern and western ends of the project area, and (5) mud-fined
abandoned channels that locally can support freshwater marsh, and found wi thin the distributary
channel at the western end of the project.

S urvey A rea D part ly contains site 41CF159.
which, as noted above, occurs atop the natural
levees of a relict course of the Rio Grande. Somewhat surprisingly, the soils map for the site area
(Figure 2-7) also identifies the soils of the natural
levee as Point Isabel clay loam, wi th the adjacent
lower areas and channel-fill deposits identified as
Sejita silty clay loam. However, to the northwest
of the site the same natural levee is identified as
Laredo si lty clay loam (saline), which would appear to make more sense given the geological situation. That soil occurs on old flood plains and
deltas and genemlly is located adjacent to old river
meanders (Williams et al. 1977:17).

Of particular interest to the current in vestigation
is the relict channel and its associated natuml-levee
deposits at the west end of the survey area. Site
41CFI59 is situated atop the natural levees on both
sides of the channel and part of the site was cut by
construction of SH 48. This unnamed former
course of the Rio Gmnde can be traced to the southeast from a point aboul8 mi ( 12.9 km) to the northwest of site 41 CF 159. There. the course is obscured by more recent channels and levee deposits associated with the Resaca del Rancho Viejo
course of the river (see Figure 2-2) . However. it
is c lear thai the course followed a southeasterly
direction from its point of origin, passing to the
east ofLoma Alta Lake, and then continued in the
same direction beyond the Brownsville Ship Channel. Although the age of this course is unknown,
it obv iously has to predate the meander belt formed
by the Resaca del Rancho Viejo course.

Climate
Cl imate of the area has been chamcterized as subtropical and semiarid (U.S. Department of Agriculture 1969: 14). The region has dry winters and
hot summers that are dominated by maritime tropical air masses from the Gulf of Mexico (Williams
et al. 1977:87). Average annual temperature is 74
degrees F, with extremes of 12 and 107 degrees F
having been recorded over the past 100 years. At
Harlingen,August has the highest average monthly
temperature of 96.7 degrees F, while January has
the lowest at 49.8 degrees F (Williams et al.
1977:Table 10). However, killing frosts are not
common and the average growing season is 330
days (U .S. Department of Agriculture 1969: 14).

Soils
The entire project area falls wit hin the SejitaLomalta-Barrada soil association (Williams et al.
1977:General Soil Map). This association consists of poorly drained and very poorly drained
"sali ne, loamy and clayey soils at or near sea level
and broad areas of barren clay that are inundated
by high tides and heavy mins. The nat topography is broken by numerous 'c lay dunes' at an elevation of to to 40 ft [3.0 to 12.2 ml above the
surrounding soils" (Williams et al. 1977:3). More

Annual precipitation at Brownsville is 26.8 inches
per year. with the greatest rainfall occurring in
September and the least in March (U.S. Department of Agriculture 1969:14) (Figure 2-8). Hurricanes can, on rare occasions, affect the area

recently, lahrsdoerfor and Leslie (1988) have subdivided the Tamaulipan Province into smaller biotic communities, of which the lorna/tidal flat community is the most applicable (Pharr District

Flora
The project area occurs entirely within the
Tamaulipan Biotic Province, a semiarid brushland,

lomas varies from dense thickets to nearly barren
ground depending on factors such as soil salinity
(which varies from low to very high) and grazing
pressure from cattle.

Fauna
The Matamoran District includes approximately
700 species of vertebrates, with over 350 species
of birds included in the assemblage (Jahrsdoerfor
and Leslie 1988; Pharr District 2004:3-2). Unique
species include the jaguarundi (Herpailurus
yaguarondi), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), jaguar
(Panthera onca), Coue's rice rat (Oryzomys
couesi), Mexican spiny pocket mouse (Liomys
irroratus), Gulf coast hog-nosed snake (Conepatus

... Vegetation on [the] flats is characterized by the
presence of species such as sea ox-eye daisy
(Borrichia Jrutescens), camphor daisy
(Machaerantrera phylocephala), gulf cordgrass
(Spartina spartinae), saltwort (Batis maritimia), and
glassworts (Salicornia sp.). Predominance of black
mangrove (Avicennia germinnans) characterizes
some of the wettest areas along the project route

While the above species are unique to the project
area today, it is likely that the prehistoric inhabitants of the area exploited a more diverse assortment of animals. Given the paucity of published

those with a significant amount of recovered faunal remains, it is not now possible to accurately

Chapter 3: Previous Archaeological Investigations
Richard A. Weinstein and Robert A. Ricklis
Overview
Generally, the archaeological knowledge afthe Rio
Grande Delta area is exceedingly limited. Due to
a dearth of sustained and systematic research in
the area, basic topics such as prehistoric cultural
chronology and patterns of human adaptatio n remain poorly defined. Key areas of investigation,
incl uding stratigraphic studies. intrasite patterning, zooarchaeological inferences of dietary and
subsistence-economic patterns, and the long-lenn
relationship between human adaptations and dynamically changing coastal and deltaic environmental zones, have yet to be carried out. Thus.
only very general assumptions about past aboriginallifeways can be reasonably made at thi s time.
One of the most obvious, however, is that the native peoples of the area subsisted without agriculture, instead relying on hunting, plant gathering
and, probably quite importantly, fishi ng (see Salinas 1990).
Archaeological sites in the general area are known
to cluster on natural levees along stream banks
(e.g., Campbell and Frizzell 1949; Collins et al.
1969, 1989; Mallouf and Zavaleta 1979) and oni
in lomas along the lagoonal shorelines and the
many tidal inlets crossing the mainland shoreline
(e.g., Prewitt 1974). The latter kind of site location is clearly typical of the majority of the locales
in the survey area, where numerous known sites,
mostly recorded by A. E. Anderson from 1908 to
ca. 1940, are situated atop lomas (Anderson 1932).
Despite the generally poor archaeological understanding, the Rio Grande Delta and surrounding
area has attracted some scholarly interest (albeit
much of it speculati ve) over the years. Since the
1930s, it has been suggested that the Texas coast
may have been a major avenue for the movement
of cultural influence from the complex soc ieties
of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica into the Southeast-

L

It also can be noted here that the current survey team
examined a sample of non-Huastecan sherds in a local

em United States (e.g., Mason 1935). Cited as
evidence for this were findings of Huastecan
(northeastern Mesoamerican) pottery vessels at
sites in the Rio Grande Delta, as well as occasional
pieces of Mexican obsidian and artifacts of jadeite
(Hester 1988, Day 1981). More recently, Hester
( 1980, 1994, 1995) and others have speculated on
a trade network between the native hunting-gathering -fishing populations of the Delta area and
lower Rio Grande valley and the intensively agricultural peoples of the Huastecan area (cf. Eckholm
1944; MacNeish 1958; Campbell 1960). Hester
( 1995:449) has suggested that the many marineshell ornaments found in surface collections from
the Rio Grande Delta may reflect intensive production and exchange for Huastecan pots, obsidian, and limited quantities of jadeite ornaments.
The only consistently used cultural-historical tenn
applied to prehistoric archaeology of the Texas
portion of the Delta area is that of the "Brownsville
Complex" (MacNeish 1947:1-15, 1958:186-193;
Hester 1969.1975.1980.1994.1995; Black 1989;
Bousman et al. 1990; Ricklis 1995; Ricklis and
Weinstein 2005). Very generally, the tenn designates an assemblage of artifacts that was surface
collected from area sites (mostly by A. E. Anderson) and, to a more limited degree, reported from
cemetery burials (e.g., Hester 1969, 1980). The
assemblage generally consists of a variety of marine-shell ornaments, tools manufactured from
whelks and other marine shells, bone beads and
other ornaments, diminutive chipped stone tools
(such as tiny scrapers and drills or perforators),
and small, thin triangular and subtriangular arrow
points. No indigenous ceramics are ascribed to
the Brownsville Complex. As mentioned, however, sherds and some whole vessels of Huastecan
pottery have been reported in limited quantities. !
Generall y the Brown sville Complex has been
thought to fall into the Late Prehistoric period (afterca. A.D. WOO or so) (Hester 1995:447), though

collection from site 41 CFl S9 (see Chapter 4). These will
be discussed in greater detail later.

recently acquired radiocarbon dates on certain
human burials from the lower Rio Grande valley
may establi sh a direct antecedent in the preceding
Archaic period (Tiffany Temeny. personal communication 2(03 ). Aside from the information
provided by exten sive surface col lection s and a
limited number of human buria ls. little is understood about the lifeways or adapti ve patterns of
the people who left behind the Brownsvi lle Complex material s.

unique for the Delta, as it was one of only a small
number of sites to produce a relatively largequanlilY of oyster shells (presumably from one or more
she ll middens present at the locale), a shellfi sh
spec ies not normally found in large numbers at
sites in the area. In addition, this fairly large site,
which covers most of Lorna del Mesquite (situated about 1.2 km east of the c urrenl project's Area
F), was thought to have been a manufacturing locus for shell ornaments (particularly shell discs).
It also had yie lded severa l glass arrow poi nts.
Thus. at least one of the components at the locale
can be dated to the protohi storic or hi storic period .

Earlier c ultures are even less well understood .
Sporad ic archaeological in vestigations, mostl y at
locales around the Rio Grande Delta (e.g. , Prewilt
1974; MaHouf et al. 1977; Collins et al. 1989;
Bousman et al. 1990; Eling et al. 1993), have produced evidence of human occupation during the
Archaic period. Stone tools and dart point forms
have been noted . A very limited number of radiocarbon dates has been reported from camp and
burial sites, and these place occupation of the area
as far back as at least ca. 3.500 BP (e.g., Collins et
al. 1989). Only very limited information on Archaic artifact assemblages and zooarchaeolog ical
data is available. though a generalized hunter-gathering, and. in places, fi shing, subsistence economy
appears to be indicated. Despite the limited data
gathered on early subsistence practices, the potential for using fi sh otoliths to determine the seasonality of fi shing and shoreline site occupation was
successfull y explored at the Horse Island site to
the north of the survey area (Eling et al. 1993).
This analytical technique, which has proven highly
useful farther north along the Texas coast (e.g.,
Rickli s 1996; Weinstein 2002: Wilson 2002). can
surely be well utilized in the Rio Grande Delta.

The second study is an article by Kumpe et al.
( 1998) on the presence of Rallgia Clllleata at sites
in the Delta, and the fact that Ii ving (or recently
deceased) Rangia can be fou nd in several of the
area's waterbodies today. Kumpe took exception
to a statement by Steele (1988:227) that Rallgi(l
had not been found at archaeological sites south
of Corpus Christi. To show otherwi se, he and hi s
co-authors wrote an article that documented sites
wi th Rallg i(l in the Delta. Nine sites in the vicinity of Bahia Grande and San Martin Lake were
di scussed and artifacts from each brieny noted
(Table 3-1). As can be seen. the most prolific locale was site 41CF 136. of which additional information wi ll be provided below.
Al so included in the article by Kumpe et al. (1998)
was a relativel y lengthy discussion of s ite
41 CF159, the site in Area D that the current survey was asked to in vestigate further (see Figure
I - I ). Obviously, more wi ll be said of this site in
the following chapter. including the find ings reported by Kumpe and his associates. Generally,
the locales discussed by Kumpe et al. (1998:2628) occurred atop many of the lomas in the region
or along the edges of some of the area's semi-permanent waterbodies . None, save 41CF159, was
very prolific , either in the number of Ra1lgia
present or the quantity of artifacts produced. and
they can be considered typical of the majority of
the reported sites in the region.

Sites in the Project Vicinity
Although numerous si tes have been reported from
the vic inity of the project area (figure 3-1), very
little site-related information has been publi shed.
As far as the authors arc aware, there are only three
studies that specifica lly discuss archaeological
sites from locales adjacent to the project area . The
first of these is the overv iew by Prewitt (1974),
based on his one-month survey of the Rio Grande
Delta region in 1970. Prewitt (1974:60) notes that
the Garcia Field site (41 CF8) was considered

The final report on si tes in the project area was
produced very recently (September 2004) and is

available only in draft fonn at this time (Rickli s
and Albert 2004). It concerns a survey of certain
areas within Bahia Grande that will be subjected
to a future channelization project intended to restore the bay to its pre-ship-channel state and allow water flow to resume between the bahia and
Laguna Madre. Two sites were examined during
the survey: 41CFI36 and 41CF138, both previous A. E. Anderson locales.

Remains of site 41CFI38 were found atop and
along the flanks of the southeastern end of Redhead Ridge, a long lorna that runs parallel to the
western shore of Bahia Grande (see Figure 3-1).
This location is approximately 0.6 km north-northwest of the point where SH 48 cuts through the
northeastern edge of Puerta de Trancas (part of the
present project's Area A). Only a very brief period of time was spent examining the site. as it
was not to be affected by the channelization
project. but Ricklis and Albert (2004:15) report
the discovery of small fired clay nodules, possibly representing the remains of erooed hearths, plus
numerous Rabdotus sp. snails. Nod iagnostic items
were recovered.

Cultural remains from site 41CFI36 were found
to stretch for ca. 500 m along the eroded eastern
edge of Bahia Grande. on the isthmus of land separating Bahia Grande from the small Laguna Madre
(see Figure 3-1). Inspection of the bank line revealed that cultural material was eroding out of a
buried A horizon exposed along the flank of a low
lorna that ran parallel to the bay shore. The A horizon was situaled at a depth of 1.2 m below the
surface of the loma and was marked by a we lldefined lens of Rabdotus sp. snails. In situ within
the lens was a chert flake. Located immediately
below the lens on the surface of the dry lakebed.
and undoubtedly having eroded from the lens. were
two chert Tortugas dart points. a sma ll c hert
uniface. six pieces of chert debitage, two pieces
of unmodified pumice. fragments of two flaked
sunray venus (Macrocalfista nimbo.sa) valves, a
possibly modified whelk (8usycon perversum)
fmgment. and 31 black drum (Pogollias cromis),
red drum (Sciaellops ocellaw). and spotted sea
trout (CYllosciollllebulosis) otoliths (R ick lis and
Albert 2004: 18-23). Given the est imated date
range of Tortugas points, plus the other items recovered from the site, Ricklis and Albert (2004:2224) suggested that the si te probably served as a
seasonal base camp fo r people who were capturing locally available fish. sometime between 6000
and 2000 BP. Considering the spec ies of fi sh represented by the otoliths. it also was suggested that
Bahia Grande must have been a "mari ne-influenced embayment" at the time of site occupation
(Rick li s and Albert 2004:22). The si te was considered potentially eligible for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places and testi ng
was recommended. If such testing occ urs, then
site 41CFI36 would become the first site in the
vicinity of the current project to be examined by
controlled excavations.

Research Issues
Given all of the above, it is probably safe to conclude that research topics in the Rio Grande Della
area that need investigation are quite fundamental. Thus. it is the potential for any given archaeological site to address these issues. and these issues, in tum, will largely form the basis for site
assessment and a determination of a site's potential eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. These basic issues are:

21

1.

Culture chronology. as evidenced by a definable sequence of archaeological material assembtages (I.e .. specific anifact types and
forms for discrcte time periods).

2.

Subsistcnce economic patterns and their continuity and change through time. as evidenced
by specific strategies of resource exploitation
and the linking of these strategies with naturally changing/evolving environmental resource mosaics.

3.

Settlement patterns. or how prehistoric peoples
used and moved to and from preferred locations in their environment. This issue encompasses questions of intensity of site occupation and specific resource zoncs according to
the relative abundance of key subsistence resources. the relative size of groups residing at
specific kinds of sites within specific environmental zones, and the duration and periodicity/seasonality of occupations.

4.

The origins and development ofthc Brownsville
Complex. and its possible relationship to
Mesoamerican cultures to the south.

Chapter 4: The Survey
Richard A. Weinstein and Pollyanna A. Held
As noted previously. the field investigations actually consisted of intensive surveys at six separate
areas along SH 48 (Figure 4- 1). Each area was
assigned a letter designation by personne l at
TxDOT and those designations are retained in the
current report. However, due to changes in pOlcntial impacts and the addition and de letion of some
of the areas (Areas F and G were added; Area E
was eli minated), the letter designatio ns do not occur in any sequential order along the highway.
Instead , Area C is located at the eastern end of the
overall SH 48 survey corridor, Area A is near the
middle, and Area D is situated at the western end.
Thus, to simplify the following presentation, the
various areas are described from east to west. regardless of their alphabetical order.

Area C
Area C Description
Area C consisted of a roughly 1,300-ft-Iong (396m-long) segment of SH 48 (from ca . Station
1625+00 to Station 1638+00) that previous ly had
cut through the eastern end of an unnamed. eastwest-trending lorna situated on the north side of
an intennittent tidal channel identified as Vadia
Ancha (Figure 4-2). The Vadia Ancha channel
once connected the tidal flats and marshes present
along the western edge of Laguna Madre (s ituated
to the east) to a smaller bay, also named Laguna
Madre (located to the west) (Figure 4-3).! Due to
construction of the Brownsville Ship Chan nel in
the 1930s, Vad ia Ancha today connects the small
Laguna Madre directly to the ship channel and then
to the larger Laguna Madre (see Figure 4-1).

way centerline. About 40 ft (12.2 m) of the laller
part of the ROW cons ists of the paved roadbed,
whi le an additional 40 to 50 ft (12.2 to 15.2 m)
includes the grass-covered shoulder of the highway and an adjacent drainage ditch the runs the
length of the ROW. Thus, only about 10 to 20 ft
(3 to 6 m) of extanl lorna occurs on either side of
the highway at the edges of the ROW. However,
even this portion of re maining lama is not entirely
undamaged, as it had been graded and shaped during prior highway construction, leaving only a few
fee t of undisturbed lorna at the top of the cut.
According to highway construction plans, the SH
48 roadbed at the base of the lorna on the Vadia
Ancha side has an elevation of sl ightly over 6 ft
( 1.8 m) MSL. while the highest part of the roadbed atop the lorna rises to an elevation of just over
16 f1 (4.9 m) MSL (Pharr District 2003:Sheet 3).
However, since the highway bisected the lorna,
these elevations can be viewed as minimum estimates . The 1934 quadrangle (see Figure 4-3)
shows the maximum height of the lorna at just
below 29 ft (8.8 m) MSL. while the modern quadrang le (Geological Survey 1983c) shows an elevation of ca. 26 ft (7.9 m) MSL. Thus. the lorna
profiles exposed along either side of the highway
cut are somewhere between 10 and 13 ft (3 and
4 m) high.

The ROW in Area C is 200 ft (61 m) wide. with
100 ft (30.5 m) located on either side of [he high-

Area C was of particular interest to the current investigators and TxDOT personnel, as an aboriginal burial reportedly had been d iscovered by local
avocational archaeologists on that part of the lorna
situated immediately to the east of the highway
ROW. Although not previously visited by any
professional archaeologist, and not assigned an
offic ial state site number. the burial location had
been reported to Elton Prewitt in the early 1970s
while Prew itt was conducting a survey of the re-

It is interesting to note that the 1934 Port Isabel,
Texas, quadrangle shows a road crossing the loma
along the same route as modern SH 48, proceedi ng
to the southwest across Vadia Aneha, and then turning south for a short distance before terminating (see
Figure 4-3). This early road does not appear to have

cut into the lorna, however, but simply climbed the
loma's north side and then descended its south side.
It was not until the road was improved to highway
status (sometime in the 1940s or early 1950s) that the
loma actually was bisected and the roadbed lowered
in order to lessen the highway grade.

main impetus for the work at Area C came from the eastern portion of the lorna, to the right of

gion on behalf of TARL (William Wagner, personal communication 2004). Because of that, the
burial location is marked on site maps currently
housed at TARL. However, Mike Krzywonski, a
knowledgeable avocational archaeologist in the
area today, had no recollection of a burial ever
having been found at the location. Instead, Mr.
Krzywonski noted that a burial had been discovered on a nearby lorna situated about 3,000 ft
(914 m) to the north. Given the results of the CEI
investigations (see below), it seems possible that
the two locations may have been confused with
one another and that there never was a burial found
near Area C.

curred within the existing ROW. Rather, the field
investigations would have to rely upon a careful
surface inspection coupled with trenches cut into
the side of the existing lorna at the very edge of
the ROW.
Accordingly, examination of Area C began with a
careful surface inspection of the exposed ground
within the ROW, including the sloping sides of
the cuts into the lorna proper. No artifacts or
obvious cultural material were noted. However,
a small cluster of oysters and other estuarine
shells was found on the surface at the eastern
edge of the drainage ditch on the east side of
the highway (Table 4-1; see Figure 4-4, below).
The shellfish species represented by the cluster
clearly did not originate at the location where
they were found, but had to have been brought to
the locale by some other means. Thus, the possibility of aboriginal transport to the area was considered reasonably high. Unfortunately, an examination of the upper part of the lorna situated above
the shell cluster failed to reveal any evidence
of like shells, either on the lorna surface proper
or eroding out of the side of the road cut into
the lorna.

Area C Survey and Results

The scope of work for Area C called for a combination of surface survey, trenching, and mechanical stripping of selected locations within the ROW.
Given the possibility of aboriginal burials at the
locale, the latter was considered an added step in
the effort to identify potential burial pits. Upon
initial examination of the area, however, it became
obvious that no mechanical scraping would be
possible, as practically no intact lorna surface oc25

Figure 4-3. Areas Band C as they appeared in /934. Note the
amount of water within Vadia Ancha prior to construction of the Brownsville Ship Channel. Also note that the
road crossing both areas did not cut into the existing
lomas, but instead climbed one side of each lama and
then descended the other side. (Modified from Geological Survey /93 4.)

Once the surface examination was completed,
trench excavation began. Given the nature of the
ROW at Area C, however, these trenches actually
served as a means to expose profiles along the
highway cut that had been dug through the lorna.
It was hoped that these proftIes would reveal darker
soil zones representative of old A horizons that had
formed during periods when the lorna was not
accreting or was accreting only at very slow rates.
Thus, theoretically, such A horizons should represent stable surfaces upon which aboriginal occupation could have occurred. By identifying and
then sampling these zones, it was hoped that evidence of cultural material might be discovered.

five located on the west side (Figures 4-4 through
4-9). They were excavated by a Gradall that had
been provided (along with its operator) by the Pharr
District of TxDOT. The profile trenches were
spaced 50 m apart on each side of the highway,
but staggered in relation to those on the other side
of the road, thus providing views into the lorna at
25-m intervals along the length of the highway cut.
To avoid duplication of numbers, and potential
confusion later in the project, trenches on the east
side of the highway were assigned odd numbers,
while those on the west side were given even numbers, along with the letter C (for Area C). Thus,
the six trenches on the east side were identified as
C-l, C-3, C-5, C-7, C-9, and C- ll. Those on the
west side included C-2, C-4, C-6, C-8, and C-lO.

Finally, after a profile had been phOlographed (and
sometimes drawn), then all dark soil strata were
identified and assigned specific strata numbers in
case any evidence of cultural activity appeared
during the subsequent screening process. A sample
of soil then was removed from each of these selected strata and screened through 1I4-inch wire

depending on the thickness of the stratum being sampled . In most instances, the soil was
re latively easy to screen, as it consisted of a
good proportion of silt. However, in a few
cases, the clay content of the strata required that
the soil be broken up by hand and/or trowel in
an effort to find cultural remains. Overall, aside
from a few land snail shells (mainly from Helecilill
sp. and Rllbdorus sp.), which undoubtedly represent the remains of natural gastropod populations
that once lived upon the old lorna surface, nothing
of note was seen.

C-7 A, was dug into the edge of the roadside ditch,
at the base of Trench C-7, in an effort to examine
deeply buried strata not revealed in the profi le (see
Figure 4-4). Trench C-7 was situated near the location where the marine and estuarine shells had
been found, and it was thought possible that the
shells had been brought up from deeper levels
within the lorna when the drainage ditch was dug.
It was hoped that Trench C-7 A might reveallhese
possible deeper deposits.

Area C Recommendations
Although a few marine and estuarine shells were
found on the ground surface adjacent to the roadside ditch. no other evidence of possible human
activity was discovered within the ROW of Area C.
Similarly, although numerous dark strata were
exposed by the various trenches, none of the
samples retrieved from these strata contained any
hint of cultural material. Accordingly, no intact,
significant archaeological materials will be adversely affected by the proposed widening of
SH 48 within the existing ROW in Area C. No
further archaeological work is recommended.

Once a trench was completed, a wall profi le was
cleared manually by shovel and/or trowel scraping. Usually, the cleared profile was si tuated at
either the eastern or western end of the profile
trench along the wall that cut into the lorna. This
provided the greatest vert ical exposure through the
landform. (Appendix A provides measurements
on the extent of the profiles recorded for each of

Area B

however, this stretch of new ROW occurred entirely atop the crest and north slope of the undisturbed part of the lorna. Thus, true trenches, rather
than profile cuts, were needed to search for evidence of buried cultural zones. As with Area C,
the roadbed in Area B has a basal elevation of about
6 ft (l.8 m) MSL and a height of slightly fewer
than 16 ft (4.9 m) MSL where it crosses over the
lorna (pharr District 2003:Sheet 3). Again, however, it is clear from both the 1934 quadrangle (see
Figure 4-3) and the modem quadrangle (Geological Survey 1983c) that the actual height of the lorna
in the area of new ROW is on the order of ca. 23 ft
(7 m) MSL.

Area B Description
This area was situated atop another unnamed lorna
that is oriented roughly north-south and located
immediately south of Vadia Ancha, ca. 1,000 ft
(305 m) southwest of Area C (see Figure 4-1).
Since there was no prior hint of burials or any other
cultural material associated with Area B, TxDOT
personnel requested that the current survey be confined to the east side of SH 48 where new ROW
will be acquired in order to lessen the curvature
within the existing highway. There would be no
need to examine the west side of the highway, as
at Area C.

Area B Survey and Results
The scope of work for Area B called for the excavation of trenches at 50-m intervals within
the area of new ROW. Again, this was to be
coupled with a careful surface inspection of the

Accordingly, the survey area extended for approximately 1,500ft (457 m)(from ca. Station 1605+00
to Station 1620+00), and was at most about 150 ft
(ca. 45 m) wide (Figure 4-11 ). Unlike Area C,

of another unnamed lorna (see Figure 4-1). As
with Area B, this survey segment only was to include the east side of the highway where new ROW
would be acquired. TxDOT personnel were concerned about this area, as it formed the final rise
in a string of three small rises (or lomas) that extended westward from the southern end of Lorna
del Mesquite, situated about 0.6 rni (1.0 km) to
the east. The latter lorna was known to be the main
location of one of the most prolific archaeological
sites in the region-Garcia Field (41CF8) (see
Prewitt 1974). It was reasoned that occupations
related to those found at Garcia Field might occur
atop the three small rises, including the lorna at
Area F. Furthermore, the Area F lorna, though
relatively small today, originally stretched southsouthwest for about 0.5 rill (0.8 km) (Figure 417). Construction of SH 48 greatly modified this
southern extension, resulting in a relatively low
and flat rise that forms the base of the modem high-

east of the new ROW.

Acquisition of new ROW will begin at Station
1526+45, which occurs almost directly atop the
highest part of the Area F lorna, and extend northward over the lorna and down its northern slope to
ca. Station 1536+00, a distance of about 1,000 ft
(305 m). Highway construction plans indicate that
the crest of the roadbed on the lorna reaches a
height of ca. 15 ft (4.6 m) MSL and that the base
of the roadbed within the surrounding mudflats is
at an elevation of ca. 6 ft (1.8 m) MSL (Pharr District 2003:Sheet 3). As with Area B, however, the
actual height of the lorna in the area of the new
ROW is somewhat higher than the adjacent roadbed. Both the 1934 quadrangle (see Figure 4-1 7)
and the modern quadrangle (Geological Survey

At the time of the survey, the eastern end of the
Area F lorna, plus the two small lomas located to
the east, were being removed as fill material for a
new Super Wal-Mart under construction in Port
Isabel. This resulted in the presence of a huge
rectangular-shaped borrow pit situated immediately to the east of the new ROW (Figure 4-18).
The western part of the Area F lorna, including
the new ROW, also was being used as a staging
area for the heavy equipment employed in removing the fill dirt from the adjacent borrow pit. A
conversation with the foreman of the borrowing
operation revealed that the remains of several possi ble hearths had been uncovered during pit excavation, but they, along with whatever artifacts

Channel can be seen in the distance to the left. Looking to the south-southeast. Date: 9/9/04.

Originally, five trench locations were laid out at
50-m intervals across the top and northern slope
of the Area F lorna. However, once it was learned
that excavation of the adjacent borrow pit had pos-

sibly uncovered aboriginal hearths, it was decided
to close up the trench spacing to 25 m in order to
more carefully examjne the area. Thus, a total of
10 trenches, labeled F-l to F- 10, was placed down
in Area F (Figure 4-19).2 As with Area B, these
were true trenches that extended down from the
lorna surface, and not simply profile cuts as at Area
C (Figures 4-20 to 4-23). All trenches were excavated, photographed, and sampled in the same
manner as described for Area B. Again, Appendices A and B provide information on the depth of
each trench, plus photographs of at least one wall

It should be noted that Trenches F- l through F-4 fall either wholly or partly outside the proposed new ROW.
This error occurred because the southern end of the new
ROW (where it leaves the existing ROW) was pin pointed
during the field work by measuring fro m one of the many
highway station numbers that are spray painted along the

SH 48 centerline. Although this seemed a logical endeavor at the time, some error must have occurred during the measuring process. Not until the field work had
been completed and digital versions of the ROW made
available, was it learned that portions of Trenches F-\
through F-4 actually fell outside the proposed new ROW.

perimeter of the borrow pit, plus an examination
of its exposed walls, showed no evidence of any

Save for the single piece of pumice from Trench

the 10 trenches dug in Area F, plus a careful inspection of the exposed ground surface within the ROW,
only one possible item related to cultural activity
was found. This was a lone piece of unmodified
pumice recovered from a depth of 55 cm, within
the upper part of Stratum G, in Trench F-lO (see
Figure 4-24). Nothing else, save a few land snails,
were found in association. Although a natural cause
for the presence of the pumice cannot be ruled out
entirely, it seems likely that the item was transported
to the lorna by past human activity. What that activity might have been, however, is unknown, as it
obviously left no other evidence behind.

immediately east of the small lorna island situated
ca. 1,200 ft (366 m) east of the Bahia Grande Bridge
(see Figure 1-1). However, since much of the area
passed over standing water and mud flats associated
with San Martin Lake and Bahia Grande, only portions of elevated ground were considered worthy of
detailed survey. These included two separate lomas
that were examined independently of each other using two different search methods.

(between ca. Stations 1388+00 and 1392+(0). For
all of Puerta de Trancas and most of the lorna island, the present highway ROW measures 400 ft
(122 m) across, with 200 ft (61 m) situated on either side of the centerline. As noted in Chapter 2,
both San Martin Lake and Bahia Grande are windtidal flats that are seasonally filled with water, depending on the amount of precipitation in the region and the effects of storm surges on water levels within the adjacent Brownsville Ship Channel.

The largest of the two lomas, known as Puerta de
Trancas, is an arcuate-shaped feature situated between the eastern end of San Martin Lake and the
southern end of Bahia Grande, ca. 3.4 mi (5.5 km)
southwest of Area F (see Figure 4-1). It runs for a
little over 1 mi (1.6 km) in a southwest-northeast
direction (between ca. Stations 1307+00 and
1355+00) and is bisected in two locations by SH
48. The smaller lorna is situated about 0.5 mi (0.8
km) northeast of the northeastern end of Puerta de
Trancas (ca. 2.9 mi [4.7 km] southwest of Area F)
and is represented by the remains of an unnamed
"lorna island" within the southern part of Bahia
Grande (see Figure 4-1 ). It too is bisected by SH
48, but only for a distance of about 400 ft (122111)

Highway construction plans show that the current
roadbed rises to a maximum elevation of a little over
16 ft (4.9 m) MSL where SH 48 traverses Puerta de
Trancas, while the roadbed in the surrounding
mudflats is at ca. 6 ft (1.8 m) MSL (Pharr District
2003: Sheet 2). As with all previous areas, however,
Puerta de Trancas was cut away during original highway construction. This cut was only 200 ft (61 m) in
width, thus leaving about 100 ft (30 m) of undamaged lorna on either side of the highway within the
ROW. Based on both the modem quadrangle map
of the area (Geological Survey 1983a), plus an
earlier 1936 quadrangle (Figure 4-25), it is clear

Figure 4-25. Area A as it appeared in 1936, showing both Puerta de Trancas and the isolated lorna island
within the southern part of Bahia Grande. (Modified from Geological Survey 1936a.)

that the lorna rises to a maximum height of a little
over 20 ft (6.1 m) MSL on either side of the highway cut. Therefore, much of the survey area included exposed profiles, about 4 ft (1.2 m) in
height, that had been created when highway construction cut through the lorna. Due to the 200-ftwide (61-m-wide) cut through the lorna, these profiles were not situated at the outer margins of the
400-ft-wide (122-m-wide) ROW, but, instead, occurred about midway out from the centerline (i.e.,
100 ft [30 m] from the centerline and 100 ft [30 m]
from the outer edge of the ROW).

Second, it was on the lorna island that minor evidence of aboriginal activity had been discovered
in the past. Local avocational archaeologist Mike
Krzywonski informed the CEI crew that he had
found a flaked sunray venus valve along the northeastern edge of the island (Figure 4-26). Given
that fact, both CEI and TxDOT personnel considered it highly likely that other indicators of aboriginal use of the island might be found. Since
the island was beyond the limits of the ocelotcrossing corridor, a detailed visual inspection of
the area could be supplemented by either shovel
tests or trenches (or both) within the ROW.

As noted above, the little "lorna island" at the
northeastern end of Area A also was cut into during construction of SH 48. However, unlike the
cut through Puerta de Trancas, this cut removed
most of the lorna for virtually the entire width of
the 400-ft-wide (I22-m-wide) ROW. Only to the
south of the road, beyond the edge of the ROW,
was any part of the former lorna still present at its
original height of ca. 20 ft (6.1 m) MSL. It was
also along the south edge of the ROW that the highway cut had produced an exposed cutbank into the
lorna that could be cleared and profiled.

Area A Survey and Results
Area A can be di vided into two distinct segments,
Puerta de Trancas and the so-called "lorna island,"
and each will be discussed separately.

Puerta de Trancas
Since trenches were not allowed in this portion of
Area A, Puerta de Trancas was examined by a com-

/'

Area A was noteworthy for two additional reasons.
First, the Puerta de Trancas lorna was to be set
aside as a place where ocelots could find safe passage across the highway. Through negotiations
with personnel at the Atascosa National Wildlife
Refuge, situated immediately to the north of the
highway ROW, TxDOT agreed that a "green"
bridge would be constructed over the highway at
the lorna's northeastern end, and that the surrounding lorna would be left in its natural state. 3 This
would allow ocelots to move between the Bahia
Grande area and points to the south of the highway without having to face the dangers of speeding traffic. Thus, TxDOT personnel would not allow trenching to occur anywhere along the Puerta
de Trancas part of Area A. Instead, that section
would have to be examined by visual inspection
and shovel testing.

Mike Krzywonski along the northeastern edge of the loma island in Area A.
(Shown actual size.)

Basically, a "green" bridge is a bridge that is covered in
natural vegetation, as opposed to pavement, planking, or
some other foundation. To lead the ocelots to the bridge,
several hundred feet of guiding fences also are to be con-

structed on both sides of SH 48. These fences will act as
a funnel and direct the ocelots towards the bridge, thereby
reducing the possibility that the animals would cross the
highway at road level.

bination of careful surface inspection and the exÂ·
cavation of 47 shovel tests/profiles (Figure 4-27).
The latter consisted either of traditional shovel
tests, dug from the ground surface downward , or
profi les cleared along the cut edges of the lorna in
those locations where highway construction had
left the roughly 4Â·ftÂ·high (1.2Â·m-high) exposures
noted earlier. TwentyÂ·six of the shovel tests/proÂ·
fi les were excavated on the northern side of the
highway (and assigned even-number designaÂ·
lions), while 21 were dug on the south side (and
given odd numbers). In most cases, the shovel
tests/profiles were spaced 50 m apart. However,
in a few instances. potential shovel test locations
were skipped, as the areas in question were very
low and wet, and obviously not conducive to air
original occupation."'

The visual inspection of the ROW at Puerta de
Trancas was almost as unrewardi ng as the results
of the shovel tests/profiles, Only one small scatter of oyster shells was seen near the northeastern
end of the loma, on the surface on the south side
of the highway (see Figure 4Â·27), However, the
shells were fou nd in a wheel rut along a small dirt
road leading south from SH 48, It is entirely likely
that the shells simply represent recent material
dumped into the rut. either in an attempt to fill the
depression or to provide added traction to vehicles
using the dirt road.

"Lorna Island"
The lorna island was examined by shovel tests,
trenches, and an intensive visual inspection (FigÂ·
ure 4~28). Initially, three shovel tests, spaced 30
m apart and identified as STs Island AÂ·l, Island
A-2, and Island AÂ·3, were dug along what was
thought to be the northern edge of the ROW.~ This
area is closest to the location where the flaked
sunray valve had been found by Krzywonski, The
tests were dug in the same manner as those at
Puerta de Trancas, although ST Island A-I was 100
cm deep, while the others were 80cm deep. InterÂ·
estingly, the Island AÂ·l shovel test produced several fragments of constricted macoma (Macoma
cOllSlricla), stout tagelus (Tagelus plebeius), and
common rangia (Rangia cUfieata) within the upper 20-cm level (Table 4_2).6 Remains of the first
two of these species also were scattered profusely
around the edges of the island, both atop the isÂ·
land above Bahia Grande and on the mudflats beÂ·
low the lorna, Thus, the valve fragments in the
shovel test almost certainly represent elements of
a natural population that lives within the bahia,
but occasionally is tossed atop the lorna due to high

In the case of the traditional shovel tests, all were
dug in 20Â·cmÂ·thick arbitrary levels, with the fi ll
from each level screened through 1I4Â·inch wire
mesh. Usually, the tests were dug to a depth of 60
cm, but in a few cases they went to -80 cm. The
profile cuts extended from the top of the lorna to
the base of the highway cut, usually about 4 ft (1.2
m), but occasionally a little more or slightly less
was cleared. These were sampled in the same
manner as the profile trenches discussed under
Area C; i.e., all dark soil zones were identified and
samples from these zones were pu lled for subseÂ·
quent screening.
No evidence of aboriginal activity was recovered
from any of the shovel tests/profiles dug at Puerta
de Trancas. Again, the only items to come from
the tests were several land snails (mostly Rabdotus
sp.), but these undoubtedly represent the remains
of a natural population.

4

Due [0 an error in the initial numbering of the shovel
test locations on the south side of the highway, the numbers 25, 27, 29, and 3 1 were not used during the survey. Rather, the shovel tests were nu mbered directly
from ST 23 to ST 33, with the standard 50 m separating them. Thus, although the numbers were skipped,
no actual test locations were omitted.

centerline of the road. It was not until the field work
was completed, and the highway plans plotted on the
quadrangle map of the area, that was it learned that
the 400-ft-wide ROW actually narrowed to 200 ft
about midway across the northern part of the loma
island.
6

~ At the time the three shovel tes ts were excavated, the

survey crew was under the impression that the ROW
across the entire loma island measured 400 ft across.
Thus, these tests were placed down 200 fl from the

Six of the trenches were excavated wi thi n the
ROW on the south side of SH 48. Three of these,
Island A-7 through Island A-9, were placed 30 m
apart and dug imo the remaining edge of the lama
at the southern limit of the ROW (see Figures 428 and 4-31). Thus, they actually served as profile cuts into the landform. The other three. Island
A-IO through Island A-12. were dug al 2S-m intervals from each other and about midway between
the edge of the ROWand the highway. They, like
the trenches on the north side of SH 48, were in an
area that had been sheared off during construction, and were designed to uncover possible buried soil horizons in the remaining lower part of
the lorna. They were dug as true trenches, not profile cuts. Again. not a shred of cultural evidence
was uncovered in any of these trenches.

winds and wave action. The Rangia fragment may
also represent the remains of a natural she llfi sh
population. as the area situated immediately to
north of the island was one of the key collecting
areas for Rallgia noted by Kumpe et al. (1998:Figure 2). There, articulated valves of dead clams
were found on the floor of the bay, apparently resting in situ si nce death (Kumpe et al. 1998:2S).
However, it also is possible that the Rangia fragment represents a piece of cultural debris left behind by the Indians who also discarded the flaked
sunray venus found by Kr.lywonski.

Visua l inspection of the area within the ROW also
failed to locate any cultural remains. This likely
is due to the fact that the upper part of the lorna
within the ROW was removed and the surface levÂ·
eled during highway construction. To remedy this
lack of cultural malerial. and to idemify additional
remains possibly associaled with the flaked sunray
venus reported by Krzywonski, a brief search was
conducled of the island lorna, both to the north
and south of the current ROW. This search produced a few intriguing finds. These will be discussed below according to their positions north or
south of SH 48.

Nine trenches were dug wi thin the ROW at the
lorna island (Figures 4-29 to 4-31). Three. idem ified as Trenches Island A-4, Island A-S, and Island A-6, were placed down on the north side of
SH 48. at 30-m intervals, between the highway
and the edge of the ROW. Although this area of
the ROW had been cut and leveled during highway construction, and the upper several feet of the
lorna had been sheared off, it was decided to excavate trenches in the hopes of finding buried A horizons that might contain evidence of aboriginal
occupation. These were true trenches dug downward from the surface; they were examined and
sampled in the same manner as all like trenches
discussed previously (also see Appendices A and

Examination of the loma island north of SH 48
consisted of a compete visual inspection of the
island's perimeter (Figure 4-33). This entai led
walking along the adjacent mudflats of Bahia
Grande and examining the exposed, relatively clear
bankline of the loma. Also searched was the dry
lakebed below the lorna in an effort to locate items
that might have eroded off the island. No items of
interest were seen eroding out of the sides of the
lorna, nor were any artifacts found on the lakebed
below the lorna. There were numerous fragments

(Cyrtopleura costata), and constricted macoma
(Macoma constricta) scattered along the lakebed
for virtuaUy the entire island perimeter (Table 4-3),
but all of these species almost certainly represent
natural populations currently living in the bahia.7
Only in one location, along the northeastern side
of the island, near where the flaked sunray had
been found, were the remains discovered of shellfish species that conceivably could have been col-

lected by prehistoric peoples. This location yielded
a few fragments of oyster (Crassostrea virginica)
and one valve of common rangia (Rangia cuneata).
Given that these species, plus the flaked sunray
venus and maybe the Rangia from ST Island A-I,
probably represent the remains of a minor aboriginal occupation (or usage) of the northeastern part of the lorna, a site form on the locale
was filled out and submitted to TARL. The area
then was assigned state site number 41CFI90.

Since several of these species live in bracki sh or moderately saline environments, it may be assumed that
they are present in the bahia due to higher-salinity
levels brought to the area by the Brownsville Ship
Channel and the ch annel's connection to Laguna
Madre . However, since the link between the ship

channel and Bahia Grande is through an ephemeral
channel located immediately south of the lorna island,
and since Bahia Grande also is subject to periods of
low water or even periods of no water, it is possible
that these species live for only short spurts of time in
the bay before they die off.

cluster (Figure 4-36), that the shells originally had
been located at a depth of ca. 40 cm. Such a depth
would place them just below the base of the uppennost A horizon on top of the lorna, and would
argue that the remains are likely prehistoric in age.
Unfortunately, no artifacts were fou nd with the
shells to confirm this probability. Nevertheless, a
site form was filled out and submitted to TARL
under the assumption that the shells likely represent the remains of aboriginal activity on the southern part of the lorna island. The shell cluster has
since received state site number41 CF191.

Although two areas of aboriginal activity (sites
41CF190 and 191) were identified on the lorna
isl and near the eastern end of Area A, neither fell
with in the boundaries of the current SH 48 ROW.
Only one area of oyster shells was fou nd within
the ROW along a dirt road leading south from
Puerta de Trancas, but it almost certai nl y represents a modem effort to fill in tire ruts on the road.
No other possible evidence of aboriginal occupation was found in any of the numerous shovel tests!
profi les dug in the Puerta de Trancas area or in the
shovel tests and trenches exca vated on the "lorna
island." Accordingly, no intact, significant archaeological materials will be adversely affected
by the proposed widening of SH 48 within the
existing ROW in Area A. No further archaeological work is recommended.

Material South of SH 48
A search of that part of the lama island south of
SH 48 also entai led a complete visual inspection of the island's perimeter, coupled with a
brief walk-over of cleared areas atop the lama
(Figure 4-34). Again, the same general species
noticed around the perimeter of the northern part
of the island were seen and, again, their presence can be explained by the natural populations living in the bay today. However, one
highly unique cluster of shells was discovered
erod ing out of the upper part the lorna along
the landform's southern edge. The cluster consisted of numerous large half-naked pen shells
(Atrilla semilluda) and a few oysters lyi ng flat
atop one another, and covering a fairl y restricted
area that measured ca. 2 m in diameter (Figure
4-35; Table 4-4). Because of the deflated nature of the lorna at the location of the shell s,
they were found at a depth of on ly about 10 cm_
However, it seemed likely, based on an exposed

Area G Description
This area included Lorna de las Yeguas, an eastwest oriented, V-shaped lorna located almost exactly I mi (1.6 km) southwest of the southwestern
end of Puerta de Trancas and just west and south
of two arms of San Martin Lake (see Figure 4-1).
Although the lorna itself is a little over 1.1 mi
(1 .8 km) in length, it is bisected at an angle by SH
48 so that only about 1,800 ft (549 m) of the lorna
(from ca. Station 1234+00 to Station 1252+00)
actually falls within Area G. Unlike Area A, the
ROW in Area G is 200 ft (61 m) wide, with 100 ft
(30 m) located on either side of the highway
centerl ine.

As with several of the lomas discussed previously,
Lorna de las Yequas was cut into during highway
construction and the area within the ROW reduced
in height. According to both the 1936 (Figure 437) and modern (Geological Survey 1983b) quadrangles, the highest points on the lorna have el-

evations of ca. 30 ft (9. 1 m) MSL. However, current highway plans indicate that the highest elevation of the modern roadbed is at ca. 20 ft (6.1 m)
MSL (Pharr District 2003:Sheet 1). Thus, when
the highway cut through the lorna it created fri nging cutbanks along the outer edges of the ROW

original activity might be present within or adjacent to the SH 48 ROW. As such, TxDOT personnel requested that the lorna be examined by visual
inspection, trenches, and shovel tests, if the latter
were deemed necessary.

Lorna de las Yeguas was selected for survey during the current project because it had previously
produced several aboriginal artifacts. Mike
Krzywonski reported the discovery of a flaked
Rangia valve (Figure 4-38, a) from the northern
edge of the northern arm of the lorna and an extremely small unifacial scraper (Figure 4-38, b)
from the eastern tip ofthe lorna's southern arm. It
was reasoned that other artifacts or signs of ab-

Area G Survey and Results
Initial inspection of the ROW across Lorna de las
Yeguas consisted of the excavation of 17 trenches
along the northern side of the highway at the outer
edge of the ROW (Figures 4-39 through 4-44). As
noted, these were actually profile trenches that cut
into the remaining, intact part of the lorna, thus
exposing profiles of the lorna in their northern end

Helecina sp.) were the only items of note in the
screened soil samples, but these easily can be dismissed as natural occurrences within the lorna's
old A horizons. Given the results of the 17 trenches
dug on the north side of SH 48, it was decided that
additional trenching on the south side would be
unnecessary. Instead, the survey party decided to
concentrate on a visual inspection of the ROWand
the northern arm of the lorna where the Rangia
scraper had been found. Inspection of the southern arm beyond the limits of the ROW was not
entertained, as the little uniface scraper clearly had
come from an area well removed from the highway ROW.

Material Within the ROW

Visual inspection of the ROW on the south side of
the highway failed to find any evidence of cultural material. However, two scatters of suspicious
shellfish remains were found within the ROW on
the north side of SH 48. Since the most obvious
shells in each scatter consisted of Mercenaria
compechensis, the scatters were identified as
Mercenaria #1 and Mercenaria #2 (see Figure 441). One was located near Trench G-13, while the
other was located near Trench G-16. The contents
of each were collected and are listed in Table 4-5.
Overall, these scatters are reminiscent of the marine and estuarine shells found on the surface of
Area C near Trench C-7 A. They are likely related
to aboriginal collecting activities, but it is uncertain how they came to their current locations. As
discussed above, the lorna within virtually the entire length of the ROW had been cut away and
reduced in height during highway construction.
Thus, these shell scatters must represent post-highway deposits. Perhaps they are items that had
eroded off the upper part of the still-intact lorna
immediately to the north of the ROW, but, if so,
then why were no similar shells found in any of
the adjacent trenches? Unfortunately, the upper
part of the lorna beyond the ROW was heavily
overgrown in the area of the two shell scatters,
and it could not be adequately searched during the
current survey. Since it was outside the ROW, no
further attempt was made to clear the area to enhance the search. Such an endeavor will have to
await future ROW expansion. For now it seems

walls. They were examined, photographed, and
sampled in the same fashion as all previously described profile trenches (Figures 4-45 and 4-46).
(Also see Appendices A and B for height measurements and photographs of the various cleared profiles related to Area G.)
The first three trenches (labeled G-l through G-3)
were spaced 30 m apart and positioned at the eastern end of Area G, along that part of the ROW that
fell about midway between the two arms of the
lorna (see Figures 4-39 and 4-40). It was theorized that potential artifacts associated with
Krzywonski's two scrapers would be most likely
to occur on this portion of the lorna, and that closespaced trenching was needed to best assess that
possibility. However, once these trenches were
excavated without any evidence of artifacts or
other aboriginal activities, then it was decided to
expand the distance between the remaining
trenches to 50 m. Accordingly, Trenches G-4
through G-17 were dug at 50-m intervals along
the northern edge of the ROW (see Figures 4-40
and 4-41).
Once again, no indication of cultural activity was
found in any of the trenches, either in the cleared
profiles or in the soil samples removed for screening. Scattered land snails (Rabdotus sp. and

amount of time to a walk-over of the area, with
particular attention paid to eroded and/or cleared
locations atop the lorna. This resulted in the discovery of three discrete shell deposits, identified
as Locations A through C on Figure 4-47, that are

search the ROW for a distance of 0.5 mi (0.8 km)
either side of the site to make certain that no additional cultural material was present. Before the results of these investigations are presented. however,
it seems a wise idea to briefly review previous information on the locale and to examine impacts
from the earlier widening project.

only likely intact culluml remains came from three
(possibly four)discrete oyster piles found scattered
across the northern arm of the lorna, all situated
outside the ROW. When coupled with the tiny
bifacial scraper found on the tip of the southern
lorna arm, it seems likely that the eastern part of
Lorna de las Yeguas was t he scene of several episodes of aboriginal activity. However. since none
of these remains occurs wi thin the current ROW,
it was nO[ possible to investigate their nature any
further during the present survey.

Description of Site 41CF159
S ite 41CFI59 is a rather extensive locale that
stretches for several thousand feet along both the
northern and sout hern natural levees of a relict
course of the Rio Grande (see Figure 2-2). Accord ing to site maps housed at TARL, the site area
on the northern levee extends for ca. 4,000 ft
(1,219 m). while that on the southern levee covers
a distance of about 4,500 ft (1,372 m). It is the
eastern end of the latter site area that falls within
the current ROW for SH 48.

Ovemll, no intact. significant archaeological materials will be adversely affected by the proposed
widening of SH 48 within the ex isting ROW of
Area G. No further archaeological work is recommended.
Area D
This was perhaps the most interesting of all areas investigated during the cunenl project. It actually lies
beyond the western limits of the proposed SH 48 widening project, but was included in the eEl survey in
an effort to gather more infonnation on a known site,
41CF159, situated partially within the existing ROW.
This site had been damaged during an earlier episode of highway widening. and TxOOT personnel requested that the CEl survey assess the remains of the
site still situated within the ROWand to carefully

The relict Rio Grande course associated with the
site is a prominent feature that is fairly well defined on the Environmental Geology Map prepared
by Brown et al. (1980) (Figure 4-52). It appears
to have emanated from an area now obscured by
the modem Rio Grande meander belt, ca. 8 mi
(12.9 km) to the northwest of site 41CF159. The
course then flowed in a southeasterly direction to
the east of Lorna Alta Lake and then on to the

defined natural levees rising to between 10 and
12 ft (3 and 3.7 m) MSL. Immediately to the southeast of the site location, the channel followed a
sinuous course among Lorna de la Madriguera and
Lorna del Cenisal, and contained within its natural levees several stretches of either open water or
marshy vegetation. These areas have since been
obliterated by construction of the ship channel, but
they undoubtedly would have been highly attractive locales for the local aboriginal population. In
fact, given the quantity of Rangia present at site

channel. Th ese would have been ideal areas for the collection ofRangia cuneata clams. (Modified from Geological Survey f 936a.)

natural levee. When Anderson's collections were
loaned to TARL following his death in the 1940s,
the site area on the northern levee was listed as
Anderson site 58.51, while that on the southern
levee was identified as Anderson sites 58.41 and
58.42. However, neither area was assigned an official state site number.

That portion of site 41CF159 situated on the northern natural levee initially was recorded by A. E.
Anderson in 1918 (William Wagner, personal communication 2004). A modest collection of artifacts was made at that time. Anderson again visited the area and made additional collections from
the northern levee in 1921 and 1934. It was not
until 1928 (and again in 1933) that Anderson visited and collected the site area on the southern

At the request of the senior author, the Anderson
collections from site 41 CF 159 were examined and
photographed by William (Skye) Wagner, a Ph.D.
student at The University of Texas at Austin who
currently is studying the relationship between sites
of the Brownsville Complex and those of the
Huastecan area of Mexico. Table 4-7 provides

plain aboriginal sherds.

A period of a little more than 60 years would elapse
before the site area was visited again. Mike
Krzywonski examined the locale in late 1995 when
SH 48 was undergoing initial widening and the
site was being impacted by construction activities. 8
Krzywonski then brought the site to the attention
of Don Kumpe, another avocational archaeologist
in the region, and the two men obtained several
surface collections from the locale.') Kumpe and
Krzywonski subsequently (in October 1996) submitted a state site fonn to TARL and 4lCF l 59 finally received official site status. Shortly thereafter, Krumpe, C. K. Chandler, and Richard
McReynolds included a discuss ion of the site in
their article on Cameron County locales that had
yielded evidence of the common rangia (Rallgia
cUlleara) (Kumpe et al. 1998).

During the course of the current survey, Mike
Krzywonski was kind enough to make his collection from the southern natural levee (his site 170.3)
avai lable for examination and photography. Accordingly, Figures 4-58 and 4-59 illustrate the
shell and lithic artifacts in the collection. Interesti ngly. the plain sherds noted by Kumpe et
al. also are part of the Krzywonski collection,
and these are shown in Figure 4-60. As can be
seen, the lithic items include two chert Cameron
arrow points. while the sherds are slipped. sandypaste specimens from the same vessel. The paste
of the sherds contains a few shell-l ike fragments
that appear to be natural inclusions and not intentional temper. II If the senior author had to
characterize the sherds according to known
types, he would say that they are reminiscent
of very sandy examples of Goose Creek Plain.
Although such a Goose Creek connection cannot
be ruled out entirely at this time. it is far more
likely that the sherds represent elements of a littleknown local ceramic tradition .

Photographs taken by Krzywonski in December
1995 show the site area during the early widening
stages of SH 48. Numerous Rallgia can be seen
eroding out of the edge of the natural levee where
it had been cut by the highway (Figure 4-56).10
That same area was photographed again a few
months later after the highway had been widened

the southern natural levee (the R standing for "road cut").
Ko ywonski designated this same road-cut area as his site
t70.3.

8 It was sometime between 1936 and t 955 that the site area
on the southern natural levee was bisected by construction of the road (i dentified as Highway 1792 on the 1955
Palmito Hill quadrangle) that eventually would become
SH48.
9

In much the same manner as Anderson, both Kr/.ywonski
and Kumpe assigned their own unique numbers 10 different collecting areas at the site. These included
Kumpe's L27 for the nonhero natural levee and L92 for
the southern natural levee. The latter was funher subdivided into L92R for the area where SH 48 had cut into

At the time the collection was examined, the e El crew
only had a small tOx hand lens with which to check the

inclusions. Thus. the identification of these items as shell,
though likely. is not definite.

the other on the southern natural levee. While the
northern part of the site had yielded the bulk of
the Anderson collections, it was the southern part,
along the edge of SH 48, that had produced most
of the items identified by Krzywonski and Kumpe,
including the large quantity of Rangia cuneata
shells. Artifacts from that area suggested occupation possibly ranging from the Late Archaic period (Matamoros dart points) into the Late Prehistoric period (Starr and Cameron arrow points), with
the main period of site use dating to the latter part
of the sequence. There also must have been a
protohistoric or historic occupation, given the
former presence of glass arrow points in the Anderson collection, but these now are missing and it is
uncertain upon which natural levee they were

As noted above, that part of site 4 1CF159 cut by
the highway, along with the ROW for 0.5 mi
(0.8 km) either side of the site, were to be investigated during the current survey. The original scope
of work called for a combination of shovel tests
and trenches to be utilized in this endeavor. However, upon an initial visit to the site it became clear
that very little of the southern natural levee actually remained intact within the ROW. The 1996
widening program had removed most of the low
rise marking the natural levee, leaving only a 1m-wide swath of intact levee in the ROW. Thus,
it was decided to abandon the trenching and to only
employ shovel tests during the investigations in
the area.

Overall, information previously collected by
Anderson, Krzywonski, and Kumpe suggested that
site 41CF159 contained two rather extensive areas of aboriginal occupation, one on the northern
natural levee of the relict Rio Grande channel and

Initially, the eEl survey crew excavated a series
of 38 shovel tests (identified as STs N- l through
N-39) along the north side of the highway, with
every test situated at the extreme edge of the
ROW.12 As requested, the tests began about 0.5 mi
(0.8 km) east-northeast of the site and moved along
the edge of the ROW in a west-southwesterly direction from there (Figure 4-61). The first 14
shovel tests were spaced at 50-m intervals from
each other, as they clearly were situated beyond
the limits of the southern natural levee rise. Once
the tests came within proximity of the rise, how-

ever, the spacing between tests was reduced and
STs N-1 6 through N -25 were dug 30 m apart. After
the series of tests had passed to the west-southwest of the natural levee, the distance between
them was increased again and STs N-26 through
N-39 were dug at intervals of 50 m. The final test
fell ca. 0.5 mi (0.8 km) to the west-southwest of
the site area, along a new section of SH 48 that
follows a straight line in that direction. This new
section does not appear on the most recent quadrangle map ofthe area (as that map still shows old
SH 48 heading off to the southwest towards the

and southwest of ST N -20 and GPS readings were
taken on the northeastern and southwestern limits
of the scattered Rangia strewn across the surface.
The latter readings indicate that the surface Rangia
extends for about 35 m along the edge ofthe ROW
(Figure 4-64). Two of the additional shovel tests,
identified as N-20 + lOE and N-20 + 20E were
positioned to the northeast of ST N-20, while one
test, identified as N-20 + lOW, was positioned 10
m to the southwest of ST N-20. Both tests located
to the northeast produced Rallgia fragments in the
upper 40 cm (although only the shells in ST N-lO
+ IDE were saved; see Table 4-8), whi le the test to
the southwest only yielded Rabdotus. Given these
results, it seems safe to conclude that. although
surface Rallgia are strung out for ca. 35 m along
the edge of the ROW, intact remains of the Rallgia
midden extend fo r only about 20 m (see Figure 464).

As noted for Area A, all shovel tests were excavated in 20-cm arbitrary levels, wi th the fi ll from
each level screened separately through 1I4-inch
wire mesh (Figures 4-62 and 4-63). Most tests
were excavated to a depth of either 60 or 80 cm,
although a few went as deep as 90 cm. Aside from
asphalt fragments, road gravel, and general roadside trash fou nd within the upper 20 cm of several
of the tests, none of the shovel tests situated to the
northeast of the site area produced any evidence
of cu ltura l activity. In fact. several of the tests
(particularly STs N-JO through N-13) clearly were
positioned within the old Rio Grande channel as
they encountered stiff. tenacious, channe l-fill
clays.
The first evidence of any potential aboriginal activity came from ST N-16, in which a fired clay
nodule was recovered from the 40-t0-60-cm level,
along with numerous fragme nts of Rabdotus sp.
(Table 4-8). Although the Rabdotus continued to
be present in the next three STs (N-1 7 through N19), it was not until ST N-20 that Rallgia were
found. Most, including all of the larger fragments,
came from the upper 40 cm, although small pieces
were present all the way to base of the test at -80
cm (see Table 4_8).1 3 Somewhat surprisingly, the
tests to the southwest of ST N-20 failed to produce any additional evidence of Rangia. Only
scattered Rabdotus were found in STs N-21
through N-23, while a few pieces of road-side trash
represented the only cultural material recovered
from STs N24 to N39. 14

Following excavation of the shovel tests on the
north side of SH 48, another series of STs were
dug along the edge of the ROW on the south side
of the highway. However, since it had become
quite clear from the northern set of STs that cultural remains related to site 41 CF159 only occurred
atop the low natural levee, it was decided to limit
the southern shovel tests to that landform. Since
there was a fairly pronounced cutbank present
along the edge of ROW on the south side of SH 48.
several of these STs actually consisted of cleared
profiles placed into the edge of the road cut. Overall, seven shovel tests/profiles (S-1 through S-7)
were excavated into the natural levee at the southern edge of the ROW (see Figures 4-61 and 4-64).
The tests began at the northeastern end of the levee
rise and extended to the southwest. IS They were
terminated when the last two tests (S-6 and S-7)
began to uncover foul -smelling deposits that made
some of the crew members nauseous. As these
tests were located next to an abandoned gasoline

In order to obtain a better understanding of the
extent of the site and its associated RclJlgia midden
within the ROW, several additional shovel tests
were excavated at lO-m intervals to the northeast

The exposed levee rise in this area actually was much
shorter in length than the corresponding rise on the north
side of SH 48. This was mainly due to the presence or
the western entrance to the AMFELS shipyard where the
area had been leveled to provide room ror a driveway
leading into the plant.

or chemical facility that appeared to have once contained large storage tanks, it was assumed that
possible toxic materials had leaked from the tanks
and entered the surrounding ground. Without
proper protective gear, it was decided to forgo any
further shovel tests. This probably does not detract greatly from the thoroughness of the investigations on the south side of SH 48, as the natural
levee only extended another 20 to 30 m beyond
ST S-7, and it is unlikely, given the results discussed below, that any significant cultural remains
are present in that area.

from a few pieces of road gravel, the only items of
note were several fragments of Rabdotus and
Helecina land snails. Not a single Rangia fragment was recovered in any of the tests. Based on
these results, it seems safe to conclude that intact
aboriginal remains related to site 41CF159 do not
occur within the ROW on the south side of SH 48.
As a complement to the shovel testing, exposed
areas within the ROW were inspected visually in
an effort to find artifacts or other evidence of aboriginal activity. This resulted in the discovery of
one sunray venus fragment at the edge of the roadside drainage ditch near ST S-3 and a few interesting items on the edge of the natural-levee rise
on the north side of the highway (Table 4-9). Of
particular note in the latter group was a flaked disc

In any event, all shovel tests/profiles were dug/
cleared to depths of either 60 or 80 cm, and the

Table 4- 10 provides the speci fic details of the "C

s.c. When calibrated to the most recent dendrochronological curve (Stuiver et al. 1998), this age
produced an intercept at Ca l 5300 BP (Cal 3350
B.C.), and a two--sigma range of between Cal 5470
and 4970 BP (Ca l 3520 to 3020 B.C). This is
somewhat older than expected, gi ven the quantity
of supposed Late Prehi storic artifacts recovered
from the site. Perhaps the dale is plagued by the
potential bane of many Rcmgia Clm eata samples,

As a supplement to the fi eld investigations noted
above. a sample of Ral/gia Clm eata val ves was
collected from the surface of the exposed Remgia

was hoped that the resulting date would provide
an age on the aboriginal occupation responsible
for gathering the clams. plus possibl y offer an estimate on the time when the relict Rio Grande channel SUPPOiled a brackish-water environment conducive to Rallgia growth, assuming that the clams

Six separate areas a long SH 48 were examined by variÂ·

activity was found within the ROW of AreasA, C, and

more 14C dates need to be obtained and more geomorphological investigations need to be conducted
in the area before any of the above can be confirmed
or rejected. However. this is a te ntative fi rst step in
what should prove to be a very rewarding process.

A rea D Recommendations

Several d iscrete shell deposits were fou nd o utside
the ROW on the surface of two of the lomas in
A reas A a nd G . These have been assigned state
s ite numbers 41CFI89 through 191. However.
s ince they are situated beyond the lim its of the
ROW, no funner archaeological investigations are
req uired at the present time.

The investigatio ns in Area 0 indicate that a very small
JX)ltio n of site 41 CF 159 still remains intact w ithin
the RO W on the nolth side of S H 48. Overall . this
segment of the locale stretches for about 35 m a long
the top of the site's southern natural levee. but, because of previous highway widening. it is only about
1 m (or less) in width. Thus. it is highly questionable as to whether a ny useful data could be acquired
by further work within so narrow an area. Perhaps a
few more alti facts might be located. or additiona l
subsiste nce remai ns recovered. but no large-scale
areas could be excavated. This would preclude the
retrieval of any mean ingful spatial data.
That being said, s ite information provided by M ike
Krzywonski (personal communication 2(04) suggests that the site area beyond the ROW may still
contain a sig nificant amount of intact cuitumJ remains. and, thus, be capable of yie lding a large
a mo unt of useful archaeological data. There fore,
a lthough no intact. significant archaeological materials are present within that segment of site4 1CF 159
situated w ithin the existing SH 48 ROW in area D.
and no fun..her archaeological work is recommended.
future construction projects requiring new ROW in
this area should not proceed without first conducting additional archaeological investigations.

The only defi nite evidence of intact aborigina l remains within the ROW came from the north side of
Area D. There. a very narrow strip of site 41CFI59
still is present at the extreme edge of the ROW. It is
marked by an obvious surface scatter of Early Archaic-age Rallgia shells (ca. 3520 to 3020 B.C.), plus
shells that are in situ within the upper 20 to 40 cm of
the natural levee upon which the site rests. UnfoltuÂ·
nately. s ince the w idth of this deposit measures only
1 m or less within the ROW, it is questionable as to
how much. if any. useful archaeological data could
be acquired from additional research in such a restricted area. Although a few artifacts might be
acquired by excavatio ns in the area, no meaningful
distribution patterns could be recognized and there is
viltually no chance of identifyi ng either the size or
shape of any aboriginal structures or possible activity
areas, should such even exist. However. additional
archaeological investigatio ns are recommended if
future conslruction projects require new ROW in this
area.

Additional confirmation of such an early date for this delta
system comes from Bruce M. Albert (personal communication 20(4) who compared pollen extracted from within
and beneath a relict Rio Grande channel at the Palo Alto
Battlefield. situated ca. 12 km northwest of site 41CF 159.
to a series of associated radiocarbon dates. One of the
dates. on organic remains from beneath the filled PaloAlto
channel. yielded an age of ca 5600 to 5310 BP (ca. 3650
to 3360 B.C.). while fill from the base of the channel itself
produced an age of ca. 3360 to 2950 BP (ca. 141 010

1000 B.C.). Thus. the PaloAltoehannel probably became
relict sometime shortly before the latter date. As mapped
by Brownet al. ( 1980:Environmental Geology Map). both
the Palo Alto channel and the channel leading to site
41CFI59 are pan of the same distributary system. having
emanated from virtually the same location north of Loma
Alta Lake. 1l1e ca. 2000-year discrepancy between the
dates on the Palo Alto channel and the Rangia from site
41CFI59 indicates thai the channel associated with the sile
is the earlier of the two.

Chapter 5: Conclusions
Richard A. Weinstein
Despite the fact that 55 trenches and 95 shovel
tests were excavated within the six ROW areas
selected by TxDOT for survey, only the shovel tests
in Area D uncovered evidence of prev iously recorded site 41CF159. Additionally, except for a
few sma ll surface scatters of marine/estuarine
shellfish found in Areas A and C, that either li kely
originated outside the ROW or were used to fi ll
ruts withi n a dirt road, no other ind icators of aboriginal activity were found within the SH 48
ROW
Three areas of aooriginai activity were discovered
outside the ROW adjacent to Areas A and G and
these were assigned state site numbers 4 1CF189
through 191 . The locales include the three (possibly four) oyster deposits on the northern arm of
Lorna de las Yeguas (Area G), the fl aked sunray
venus and other marine/estuarine shellfish fro m
the northeastern edge of the "lorna island" in Area
A. and the southern lip of the same lorna island
where the halfÂ·naked pen shell/oyster deposit was
found. None will be affected by the proposed construction project.
Overall, therefore, the only area of possible concern is at the location of site 41CF 159. However,
as noted in the previous chapter. the site area within
the ROW has been badly disturbed (actually, virtually destroyed), leaving only a very narrow strip

(ca. I m or less in width) of intact ground within
the ROW on the north side of SH 48. Within that
strip. shovel tests revealed the remains of a ca. 20em-thick mixed earth and Rallgia midden that covered an area about 20 m long. Radiocarbon resu lts suggested that this midden probably was
deposited between ca. 3520 and 3020 B .C.
However. aside from the recovery of a few additional artifacts and shellfish remains, subsequent research in such a small area would appear to provide little chance of finding much
usefu l archaeolog ical data. For that rcason, further archaeological work within the ROW at site
4lCFl59 is not considered necessary. Nevertheless, despite the situation within the SH 48
ROW at site 41CF159, future projects located
north of the ROW should take into account the
possible preserved nature of the cultural deposÂ·
its in that area. Accordingly, proper archaeological investigations should take place in order to confirm or deny the presence of such deposits.
Finally, as discussed earlier in the Preface and
Acknowledgments, it should be noted that all photographs, notes, and cultural material collected during the survey from site 4lCF159 will be curated
at the Center for Archaeological Research at The
Uni versity of Texas at San Antonio. No artifacts
were collected (and no material will be curated)
from those sites located outside the ROW.

Appendix A: Depths of Trenches and Heights of ProfIle Cuts
Excavated along the Route of SH 48
Richar d A. Weinstein
The following table provides the depths of all
trenches. and the heights of all profile cuts, excavated in SH 48 ROW Areas A, B, C, F, and G. For
trenches, the recorded depth is at the deepest part
of the excavation, and this usually corresponds to
the section cleaned and photographed (see Appen-

dix 8). The height of a profile cut is relatively
self-explanatory and simply records the extent of
the exposure initially cleared by the Gradall and
then cleaned and photographed by the eEl field
crew (again see Appendix 8).
