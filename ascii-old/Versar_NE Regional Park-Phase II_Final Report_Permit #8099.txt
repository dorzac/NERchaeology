ABSTRACT

Between the 13th and 22nd of December 2017, Versar Inc. performed a pedestrian survey of 30 acres
for the proposed development of the Northeast Regional Park-Phase II footprint, El Paso County,
Texas. The inventory followed the standards outlined under THC’s Archaeological Survey
Standards for Texas and Rules of Practice and Procedure for the Antiquities Code of Texas. The
survey parcel is positioned adjacent to the Greenbelt Levee/Drainage system. Chippendale Avenue
lies to the south and Redstone Rim Drive to the west. The area of potential effect is on property
owned by the City of El Paso; funding for the proposed undertaking is underwritten by Texas Parks
and Wildlife.
The proposed impact to the municipal lands, which entails the construction of recreational facilities
and supporting infrastructure, has generated the requirement for a Texas Antiquities Permit and
cultural resource inventory. As such, the project goal was to identify all prehistoric and historic
archaeological sites in the survey parcel and develop National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
eligibility recommendations for any newly discovered sites.
The survey documented no archaeological sites and only two isolated occurrences; the isolated
finds were fully documented and are not eligible for a NRHP recommendation. To further explore
the stratigraphic context of the parcel and investigate the possibility for buried cultural deposits a
series of subsurface excavations were implemented. Seven shovel tests and seven backhoe trenches
were excavated throughout the parcel. Each subsurface excavation was documented; all were
negative for buried cultural deposits. As a result, no further work is recommended for the proposed
30-acre Northeast Regional Park II footprint.

INTRODUCTION

Essco Environmental, Inc., contracted with Versar, Inc., to conduct a cultural resources inventory
with limited testing for the proposed Northeast Regional Park-Phase II footprint in the City of El
Paso, El Paso County, Texas (Figure 1-1). The survey parcel is positioned adjacent to the Greenbelt
Levee/Drainage system and covers 30-acres. Chippendale Avenue lies to the south and Redstone
Rim Drive to the west (Figure 1-2). The area of potential effect is on property owned by the City
of El Paso; funding for the proposed undertaking is underwritten by Texas Parks and Wildlife.
The proposed impact to the municipal lands, will incorporate the construction of recreational
facilities and supporting infrastructure, has generated the requirement for a Texas Antiquities
Permit and cultural resource inventory. As such, the project goal was to identify all prehistoric and
historic archaeological sites in the survey parcel and develop National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) eligibility recommendations for any newly discovered sites.
Between December 13th. and 22nd. 2017, Versar Inc., performed a survey of the Area of Potential
Effect (APE). The survey employed a pedestrian transect method for documenting artifact
concentrations and features that represent potential sites. This method used global positioning
system (GPS)-based locational data, along with integrated ArcPad Software and tabulated attribute
pull-down menus. The integration of the pedestrian survey and digital recording techniques
provided a complete and consistent inventory of visible cultural resources within the survey parcel.
The inventory identified two isolated occurrences; the isolated occurrences were fully documented
and are not eligible for a NRHP recommendation. In addition, seven shovel tests and seven backhoe
trenches were excavated throughout the parcel. Each subsurface excavation was documented; all
were negative for buried cultural deposits. As a result, no further work is recommended for the
APE as defined in the proposed 30-acre Northeast Regional Park II footprint.
As such, this document presents the methods and results of the investigations conducted during the
survey and limited testing process. As presented, Chapter 1 provides a general summary of the
undertaking. Chapter 2 presents a brief overview of the environmental and cultural setting of the
study area. Chapter 3 summarizes previous work conducted on the site and the methods utilized
during this project. Chapter 4 presents the results of the survey. Chapter 5 includes a summary of
these investigations and recommendations for future work. Isolated occurrence data are presented
in Appendix A. Backhoe Trench and shovel test pit locational information is presented in Appendix
B. The ESSCO Site Stratigraphy-Geomorphological Study is presented in Appendix C.

CULTURAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND GEOMORPHIC
CONTEXT

A cultural and environmental overview of the project area has been presented in several previous
publications. For a more detailed overview of the regional prehistory and historical sequences
associated with the region, the reader is referred to Goar et al. (2006), Miller, Kenmotsu, and
Landreth (2009), Swanson et al. (2014), and Condon and Jones (2016). The project area lies along
the eastern margins of the Franklin Mountains within a low-gradient alluvial fan that empties onto
the Hueco Bolson. The survey parcel falls within the Mexican Highland Section of the Basin and
Range physiographic province (Fenneman 1931) and prehistorically within the Jornada Mogollon
region of south-central New Mexico (Lehmer 1948).
Within the general project area, landforms consist of poorly-developed mesquite-stabilized dune
fields, areas of interdunal deflation, and shallow sand sheets characterized by gravelly alluvium.
Impacts to the parcel include recent grading and landform modification. Soils within the project
range from shallow, poorly developed gravelly soils overlying calcium carbonate deposits to deeply
buried alluvium that are reinvested on a seasonal basis. Within the survey parcel, soils include
loamy fine sands-to-silty loams that generally equate to Blair et al.’s (1990) Q-Series soil sequence.
Residential complexes are adjacent to the west and south of the parcel. Modern debris is lightly
spread throughout the 30 acres.
The vegetative community in the area is described as a desert scrubland and is characterized by
soaptree yucca (Yucca elata), whitethorn acacia (Acacia constricta), Christmas cholla (Opuntia
leptocaulis), saltcedar (Tamarix spp.), prickly pear cactus (Opuntia phaecantha), ocotillo
(Fouquieria splendens), creosote (Larrea tridentata), and desert willow (Chilopsis linearis)
(Powell 1998). Due to mechanical grading, minimal vegetation is present within the 30-acre parcel.
The property is currently gated with a fence line security measure in place.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND METHODS

BACKGROUND HISTORY AND ESTIMATED SITE COUNTS
Previous investigations were primarily limited to surveys covering the lands adjacent to the
proposed inventory parcel (Gerald 1985; Miller 1987; Goar et al. 2006; Swanson et al. 2014). The
most relevant being a 1987 Greenbelt Levee survey carried out by New Mexico State University
(Miller 1987) and a survey conducted by Versar/GMI (Swanson et al. 2014). No previously
recorded sites are present in the current survey parcel.
FIELD SURVEY AND SITE DOCUMENTATION PROCEDURES
In accordance with the intensive survey parameters set forth by the CTA and approved by the Texas
THC, the following field procedures were implemented during the survey.
Prefield Research
The staff at Versar Inc., El Paso, Texas conducted a comprehensive search of the online Texas
Atlas database, obtaining existing Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory site files and
researching pertinent literature to identify any previously recorded prehistoric and historic sites
within the survey parcel. In addition, aerial photographs, USGS 7.5- minute quadrangles, geologic
maps, and soil survey maps were examined prior to the field investigation. These additional
research avenues augmented the background research and provided relevant information on
topography, soils, vegetation, geology, the local environment, and levels of development within
the vicinity of the project area. A thorough search revealed seven sites within a one-half mile of the
proposed survey parcel. Identified in this search were prehistoric sites 41EP2612, 41EP2614,
41EP2620, 41EP2621, 41EP2624, 41EP2625, and 41EP5765 (Figure 3-1).
Pedestrian Transect Survey
Versar performed the pedestrian survey using a 10-m (~32 ft.) transect interval starting in the
southwestern portion of the parcel; survey crews worked in a north-to-south direction. Transect
width was contiguous, leaving no unsurveyed areas remaining between transects. The amount of
area covered, including recording time, did not exceed a rate of 15 acres per person, per eight hour
day calculated for the entirety of the project; ground visibility approximates 90 percent.
In order to effectively accomplish the survey Versar provided two experienced personnel to carry
out this task: one Project Archaeologist and one field technician. Each crew member was equipped
with a Trimble XT handheld GPS unit with integrated ArcPad data dictionaries to document
cultural materials. The Versar personnel who participated in the survey completed the Versar
mandated onsite safety training. In addition, each member read and understood the safety protocol
outlined for this project (e.g., orange safety vests, eye protection, and safety tail gate meetings).

Chapter 3: Previous Research and Methods

SUBSURFACE LEVEL OF EFFORT: MANUAL EXCAVATION AND MECHANICAL
TRENCHING
The survey parcel was examined for subsurface data potential and geomorphic context through a
series of excavation methods. Three testing methods were utilized to evaluate subsurface potential,
feature integrity, and geomorphic context of the 30 acre parcel. Stratigraphic units were depicted
in a descending order, soil structure was determined using the American Standard Soil
Classification Systems, and color was identified using a Munsell Soil Classification. Given that
color classification can be affected by lighting, moisture content, and individual examiner, some
variation in both color and hue is to be expected. As such, the original recordings presented by the
archaeological technicians and soil scientist’s exhibit minor color differences; however, the
hue/values are general consistent across the color range.
Manual Excavation
Trowel probes were utilized to provide an initial examination of isolated occurrences and potential
surface features. This was an effective and immediate method in determining subsurface integrity
and possible chronometric potential, as well as to minimize any adverse effects to a potentially
culturally sensitive area.
Excavation of shovel tests (n=7) provided a good indication of the upper soil sequence present in
the parcel. The shovel test pits recovered site-specific geomorphic data relevant to determining
context and potential NRHP eligibility. Seven shovel tests were judgmentally placed within the 30
acre parcel. In each case, the shovel test was excavated from 20-cm to 1-m below the ground
surface, or until sterile soil deposits were identified. Sediments removed during excavation were
screened through 1/8-inch mesh, and all soils were profiled.
Mechanical Excavation
Mechanical excavations (n=7) provide comparative soil profiles and was used to further explore
the deeper alluvial deposition of the project area. Seven 15-m long backhoe trenches were
excavated across the survey parcel to assess depositional context and to explore for cultural
deposits. The ESSCO soil scientist and Project Archaeologist designated the location for the 150
linear meters of backhoe trenching (1.0-m by 15.0-m). The exposure of buried features during the
mechanical excavation would result in the immediate suspension of backhoe trenching to allow for
a full documentation of the feature; consultation with the THC would occur immediately after.
Backhoe trenches were filled in after the soil sequence documentation was complete. Open trenches
were minimized, and caution tape used to clearly demarcate the trench area. In all cases, this stage
of the project was monitored closely by the soil scientist and archaeologists. The project soil
scientist, Dr. Emile Couroux, determined which trenches provided the best context for stratigraphic
mapping and sampling.

NATIONAL REGISTER ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR PREHISTORIC AND HISTORIC SITES
In the event of a site designation, the NRHP eligibility recommendation would be developed with
reference to the specific series of data criteria thresholds set forth in the 36 CFR 60.4 and the CTA
guidelines. The qualification of a property as eligible for listing in the NRHP would be judged in
relation to four evaluation criteria defined by 36 CFR Part 60. These criteria are to be applied
following the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions. The
quality of significance in American history, architecture, archaeological, and culture is present in

Page 19 of 54

Footprint, El Paso County, Texas (Permit #8099)
Chapter 3: Previous Research and Methods

districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design, setting,
materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
A. That are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad
patterns of our history; or
B. That are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
C. That embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or
that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a
significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction;
or
D. That have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history
[36 CFR § 60.4, emphasis added] (Federal Register 1981).
A key component of the NRHP eligibility program implemented by Versar will be to clearly define
the associations between features, activity areas, and artifacts. Archaeological sites with integrity
that contain artifacts and features that can contribute information toward addressing a research issue
would be regarded as significant and recommended for listing on the NRHP under Criterion D of
36 CFR 60.4. In support of the NRHP recommendation will be explicit and unambiguous
statements describing the integrity and research potential of features and activity areas will be
developed as will an evaluation of the research potential of artifact assemblages in terms of specific
research issues. The spatial arrangements and the interaction of features and artifacts in relation to
geomorphic landforms and topography will also be addressed.
Sites found to be lacking in chronometric potential or geomorphic integrity, or for which data
potential is so limited than the site has no relevance to any of the research issues, will not meet the
significance threshold of Criterion D of 36 CFR 60.4 will be considered ineligible for inclusion in
the NRHP. If it is determined that a proposed undertaking will have an adverse effect on the
identified historic properties, it will be recommended that a program of avoidance, protection, or
data recovery be implemented to mitigate the undertaking.
Collection Protocol, Limited Testing Standards, and Curation Procedures
Finally, as presented under the Texas Antiquities Permit-Terms and Conditions and TAC Title
13, Part 2, Chapter 26.C.26.17, Versar is responsible for preparing all specimens, artifacts,
materials, samples, and original field notes, maps, drawings, and photographs for curation at the
Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory, Austin, Texas. A curation form will accompany the
collections and be sent to both TARL and THC.
Artifact collections during survey will be restricted to rare items with each individually plotted on
the appropriate site and project area map. Rare artifacts will include unbroken projectile points,
whole vessels, decorated ceramics of exotic manufacture (e.g., Casas Grande pottery), and items of
personal adornment (e.g., turquoise pendants, shell/bone beads, or shell bracelets). All items that
fall under the rare category will be photographed with a scale and the location plot recorded using
a Trimble XT GPS unit; all collections will be documented and follow policies outlined under CTA
guidelines.
Since the location of this project is in proximity to landforms containing both significant
archaeological deposits and relatively rapid sediment accumulation, additional limited subsurface
investigations are proposed. Subsurface testing followed guidelines presented under THC
guidelines; all artifacts recovered during the testing protocol (trowel tests, shovel test pits, and
mechanical excavations) will be collected, analyzed, and curated. Collections relating to

Chapter 3: Previous Research and Methods

subsurface testing will include unit provenience, collection unit, and depth. If warranted,
subsequent analysis will be carried out by Versar in a laboratory setting and integrated into the
technical report.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION

This project entailed the intensive pedestrian survey of an irregularly-shaped 30-acre APE, as well
as the excavation of seven shovel tests and seven backhoe trenches in El Paso County, Texas
(Figure 4-1). The survey was confined to the established APE, which was generally disturbed,
primarily from the ground leveling and landscape modification (Figure 4-1 to Figure 4-5).
The northwest corner of the parcel contains an improved access road; the southern boundary
contains two low-lying drainage ponds. The eastern margin abuts the Greenbelt Levee system. The
far west is bounded by an existing residential neighborhood. Much of the parcel has been impacted
by eolian deflation action, and to a lesser extent, water erosion. The far western boundary remains
moderately intact with areas exhibiting sediment deposition. Locales exhibiting sediment
accumulation were closely examined for evidence of buried cultural deposits.
With the completion of the pedestrian survey, seven shovel tests were excavated across the 30 acre
parcel. These shovel test were judgmentally placed in areas of accumulated sediments and covered
the majority of the parcel. Finally, seven backhoe trenches were excavated within the parcel to
investigate the stratigraphic context of the parcel and further explore the possibility of buried
cultural deposits. No archaeological sites were identified; two isolated occurrences were
encountered (Appendix B).

ISOLATED OCCURRENCES
Two isolated finds were documented during the survey, both located in the southeast portion of the
proposed APE, each within 1-m of the other. The first isolated occurrence is a small El Paso
Polychrome body sherd (Figure 4-6). This sherd was identified within a surface context and

measured 5 cm in size. The second isolated occurrence consisted of two conjoining El Paso
Brownware body sherds (Figure 4-7). These sherds were identified within a surface context and
measured 4 cm in size. No other artifacts were encountered during the survey. Both artifacts were
thoroughly documented in-field and no further action is recommended.

Finally, in order to assess the potential for buried archaeological deposits and examine the
contextual integrity of the project area, seven shovel tests and seven backhoe trenches were
excavated within APE (Figure 4-8). All sediments removed from the shovel tests were screened
through 1/8th-inch hardware mesh. The shovel tests did not reveal any buried archaeological
remains. The stratigraphic data are presented below

SUBSURFACE LEVEL OF EFFORT: SHOVEL TESTS
Shovel Test 1 was placed in the southeast corner of the survey parcel in an area characterized by
accumulated sands (Figure 4-9). The shovel test exposed a single compact sandy-loam matrix that
extended 23-cm below ground surface. This brown (7.5YR 5/4) colored horizon was extremely
compact with caliche flecking (i.e., Q3 soil). Underlying the sandy loam was an extremely compact
calcic soil horizon (i.e., Q2 soil); the shovel test was terminated at 23 cm below ground surface.
All sediments were screened using 1/8th-inch hardware mesh-no cultural materials were
encountered.
Shovel Test 2 was placed in the northeast portion of the site; two strata were encountered in the
shovel test (Figure 4-10). The overlying sediments (Brown, 75YR 5/4, Q4 horizon) were loose and
shallow, reaching only 5 cm in depth. Underlying the loose surface sands was an extremely compact
calcic soil horizon (i.e., Q2 soil). This horizon was brown (7.5YR 5/4) in color, compact, and
contained caliche filaments; the shovel test was terminated at 20 cm below ground surface. All
sediments were screened using 1/8th-inch hardware mesh-no cultural materials were encountered.
Shovel Test 3 was placed in the north-central portion of the parcel; two strata were exposed in the
shovel test (Figure 4-11). The overlying sandy loam sediments (i.e., Q4 horizon) were compact and
gravelly, reaching 48 cm in depth. This horizon was brown in color (7.5YR 5/4) and compact.
Underlying the silt loam was an extremely compact calcic soil horizon (i.e., Q2 soil). This horizon
was pinkish-gray (7.5YR 6/2) with clear calcic inclusions/filaments; the shovel test was terminated
at 53 cm below ground surface. All sediments were screened using 1/8 th-inch hardware mesh-no
cultural materials were encountered.

Shovel Test 4 was excavated along the northern margin of the parcel; two strata were exposed in
the shovel test (Figure 4-12). The overlying sandy loam sediments (i.e., Q4 horizon) were compact
and gravelly, reaching 36 cm in depth. This horizon was brown in color (7.5YR 5/4). Underlying
the silt loam was an extremely compact calcic soil horizon (i.e., Q2 soil). This horizon was pinkishgray (7.5YR 6/2) with clear calcic inclusions/filaments; the shovel test was terminated at 48 cm

below ground surface. All sediments were screened using 1/8th-inch hardware mesh-no cultural
materials were encountered.

Figure 4-12. Shovel Test 4, looking north.
Shovel Test 5 was placed in the north-central portion of the parcel; two strata were exposed in the
shovel test (Figure 4-13). The overlying sandy loam sediments (i.e., Q4 horizon) were a compact
mixture of sand and gravel, reaching 10 cm in depth. This eolian horizon was brown in color (7.5YR
5/4). The underlying matrix is described as an extremely compact calcic soil horizon (i.e., Q2 soil).
This horizon was also brown (7.5YR 5/4) in color but contained calcic inclusions/filaments; the
shovel test was terminated at 70 cm below ground surface. All sediments were screened using 1/8thinch hardware mesh-no cultural materials were encountered.
Shovel Test 6 was excavated in the south-central portion of the parcel; one stratum was encountered
in the shovel test (Figure 4-14). This horizon was brown in color (7.5YR 5/4) and extremely
compact. Examination of the sediments identified a compacted sandy loam with calcic
inclusions/filaments; the shovel test was terminated at 45 cm below ground surface. All sediments
were screened using 1/8th-inch hardware mesh-no cultural materials were encountered.
Shovel Test 7 was placed in the southwest portion of the site. Two strata were exposed in the shovel
test (Figure 4-15). The overlying sandy loam matrix (i.e., Q4 horizon) is described as a compact
mixture of sand and gravel, reaching 40 cm in depth. This horizon was brown in color (7.5YR 5/4)
with intermixed caliche gravel. The underlying horizon is consistent in color and context as
exhibited in the preceding shovel tests. Described as an extremely compact calcic soil horizon (i.e.,
Q2 soil), this horizon was pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) in color and contained calcic
inclusions/filaments; the shovel test was terminated at 45 cm below ground surface. All sediments
were screened using 1/8th-inch hardware mesh-no cultural materials were encountered.

MECHANICAL EXCAVATIONS
Following the completion of the shovel tests, seven backhoe trenches were excavated within the
project area (seeFigure 4-1, Figure 4-16). Backhoe trenching were used to further expose the
stratigraphic sequence across the project area and facilitate feature discovery in portions of the APE
and augment the shovel test data. Mechanical investigations consisted of seven 15-m long, and
approximately 1.0-m wide, backhoe trenches judgementally placed across the site in an effort to
provide a comprehensive cross section to the APE. Trench placement was determined in
conjunction with the project soil scientist-Emile Couroux-ESSCO Environmental, Inc. In each
case, a single wall was profiled in cross section; a 1.0-m window was provided a more critical
examination by the soil scientist (Figure 4-17). No buried cultural deposits were encountered during
the trenching process.
Backhoe Trench 1
Backhoe Trench 1 was excavated in the northwest portion of the project area. This trench measured
15-m long, was approximately 1-m wide, and reached a maximum depth of 0.80-m below ground
surface. The north wall profile revealed three strata (Figure 4-18). Stratum I, the upper-most soil
unit, is described a compact, gravelly, sandy loam. This brown-colored (7.5YR 5/4) matrix is
consistent with soil units exposed in the shovel test pits; Stratum I reached depth of 0.20-m below
ground surface. Underlying the upper horizon was Stratum II, a compact strong brown (7.5YR
5/6) horizon. This stratum was 0.33-m thick and contained a gravelly loamy sand matrix with
increased pedigenic structure; calcium carbononate filaments were present. Directly beneath
Stratum II was caliche bedrock. Designated Stratum III, the pinkish-white (7.5YR 8/1) cabronate
was fully exposed in profile prior to terminating the excavation. A cross-reference of the Appendix
C soil facies identifies a correlating stratigraphic sequence-Stratum I: 5YR 3/3 Dark Reddish

Backhoe Trench 2
Backhoe Trench 2 was placed approximately 70-m southeast of Backhoe Trench 1, in the central
portion of the project area. This northwest/southeast oriented trench was 15-m long, 1.0-m wide,
and reached a depth of 0.60-m below ground surface. The east wall profile exposed three strata
(Figure 4-19). Stratum I is a compact, gravelly, brown-colored (7.5YR 5/4) sandy loam that is the
equivalent of Stratum I exposed in Backhoe Trench 1. Stratum I reached depth of 0.15-m below
ground surface.
Stratum II underlies Stratum I. This soil unit is a compact strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) horizon that
was comprised of a gravelly loamy sand matrix with increased pedigenic structure; calcium
carbononate were filaments. Stratum II was 0.25-m thick. Directly beneath Stratum II was inudated
caliche bedrock. Stratum III, the pinkish-white (7.5YR 8/1) calcium carbonate was fully exposed
in profile prior to terminating the excavation. A cross-reference of the Appendix C soil facies
identifies a correlating stratigraphic sequence-Stratum I: 5YR 3/3 Dark Reddish Brown, Stratum
II: 5YR 3/2 Dark Reddish Brown-diffuse unconformity, and Stratum III-5YR 8/1 Pinkish White.
No cultural deposits were encountered during the excavation of Backhoe Trench 2.

Stratum II underlies Stratum I. This soil unit is a compact strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) horizon that
consists of a gravelly loamy sand matrix with increased pedigenic structure; calcium carbononate
filaments were observed. Stratum II ranged in thickness from 0.15-m to 0.45-m deep. This
noticeable shift in depth was caused by incising present in the caliche bedrock (Stratum III);
sediment assigned to Stratum II infilled this cut resulting in dramatic dip in the soil profile.
Stratum III was described as pinkish-white (7.5YR 8/1) carbonate bedrock that was fully exposed
in profile prior to terminating the excavation. A cross-reference of the Appendix C soil facies
identifies a correlating stratigraphic sequence-Stratum I: 5YR 3/2 Dark Reddish Brown, Stratum
II: 5YR 3/2 Dark Reddish Brown, and Stratum III-7.5YR 8/1 Pinkish White. No cultural deposits
were encountered during the excavation of Backhoe Trench 4.
Backhoe Trench 4
Backhoe Trench 4 was excavated in the south-central portion of the project area. This
northwest/southeast oriented trench was 15-m long, 1.0-m wide, and reached a depth of 0.60-m
below ground surface. The east wall profile exposed three strata consistent with the soil sequence
present in the northern portion of the parcel (Figure 4-21). Stratum I is a compact, gravelly, browncolored (7.5YR 5/4) sandy loam. Stratum I reached a depth of 0.18-m below ground surface.
Stratum II underlies Stratum I. This soil unit is a compact strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) horizon that
consists of a gravelly loamy sand matrix with increased pedigenic structure; calcium carbononate
filaments were present. Stratum II was 0.38-m thick. Stratum III was caliche bedrock-a pinkishwhite (7.5YR 8/1) inudated calcium carbonte fully exposed in profile prior to terminating the
excavation. A cross-reference of the Appendix C soil facies identifies a correlating stratigraphic
sequence-Stratum I: 5YR 3/3 Dark Reddish Brown, Stratum II: 5YR 3/2 Dark Reddish Brown, and
Stratum III-7.5YR 8/1 Pinkish White. No cultural deposits were encountered during the excavation
of Backhoe Trench 4.

Backhoe Trench 6
Backhoe Trench 6 was excavated in the southwest portion of the project area, approximatley 50-m
southwest of Backhoe Trench 5. In addition, Backhoe Trench 6 was placed in proximity to Shovel
Test 7. This northeast/southwest oriented trench was 15-m long, 1.0-m wide, and reached a depth
of 0.60-m below ground surface. The north wall profile exposed four strata (Figure 4-23). Stratum
I is a compact, gravelly, brown-colored (7.5YR 5/4) sandy loam. Stratum I reached depth of 0.10m below ground surface.
Stratum II is a compact brown (7.5YR 5/4) colored, sandy loam characterized by gravels and
caliche nodules. Stratum II was 0.20-m thick. Stratum III is a compact strong brown (7.5YR 5/6)
deposit that consists of a gravelly loamy sand matrix. Increased pedigenic structure was present as
was an increase in calcium carbononate filaments. Stratum III was 0.15-m thick. Stratum IV was
also described as a compact strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) deposit; an erosional uncomformaty
separated the two strata. This lower horizon consisted of a gravel-filled loamy sand matrix.
Increased presence of calcium carbononate filaments was noted. Underlying Stratum IV was
pinkish-white (7.5YR 8/1) bedrock caliche. The backhoe excavation was terminated with exposure
of bedrock caliche.
A cross-reference of the Appendix C soil facies identifies a correlating stratigraphic sequenceStratum I: 7.5YR 5/6 Brown, Stratum II: 5YR 3/4 Dark Reddish Brown, Stratum III-5YR 3/4 Dark
Reddish Brown, and Stratum IV-5YR 8/1 Pinkish White. No cultural deposits were encountered
during the excavation of Backhoe Trench 6.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Versar Inc., on behalf of ESSCO Environmental, Inc., carried out a cultural resources inventory
with limited testing of the proposed Northeast Regional Park-Phase II footprint in the City of El
Paso, El Paso County, Texas. The survey parcel is adjacent to the Greenbelt Levee/Drainage
system; 30-acres were inventoried. Chippendale Avenue lies to the south and Redstone Rim Drive
to the west. The area of potential effect is on property owned by the City of El Paso; funding for
the proposed undertaking is underwritten by Texas Parks and Wildlife.
Between the 13th and 22th of December 2017, Versar Inc. performed a pedestrian survey of the
proposed park footprint. The survey employed a pedestrian transect method for documenting
artifact concentrations and features which represent potential sites. This method used global
positioning system (GPS)-based locational data, along with integrated ArcPad Software and
tabulated attribute pull-down menus. The integration of the pedestrian survey and digital recording
techniques provided a complete and consistent inventory of visible cultural resources within the
survey parcel.
The inventory identified two isolated occurrences. An intensive examination of the areas
surrounding the IOs documented no further resources; there appears to be no potential for
contextual integrity or buried cultural deposits. The IOs have been thoroughly documented and are
ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP.
In addition, seven shovel tests and seven backhoe trenches were excavated throughout the parcel.
Each subsurface excavation was documented; all were negative for buried cultural deposits. The
highly reworked and eroded nature of the project area indicates that the parcel holds little contextual
integrity regarding the presence and/or preservation of past human activity. Although portions near
the western boundary appear to have some remaining geomorphic integrity, there was no evidence
of intact prehistoric/historic sites.
It is recommended that the information potential of the isolated occurrences has been exhausted
through documentation, and no further work is merited. Based upon the results of this process,
Versar recommends that the proposed development of the Northeast Regional Park-Phase II will
not have an adverse effect on any NRHP-eligible historic properties within the proposed APE. No
further work is recommended. In the unlikely event; however, that cultural resources are identified
during construction, work should stop immediately, and the THC should be contracts to determine
the appropriate course of action.
