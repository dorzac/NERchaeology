ABSTRACT
A reconnaissance designed toward locating and evaluating
the significance of archcological and historical resources to
be affected by the Houston Lighting and Power Company's proposed construction of a nuclear power generating plant and
associated power transmission lines in Austin, Waller, Fort Bend,
and Harris counties, Texas, was carried out in November, 1972,
by staff members of the Texas Archeological Salvage Project, The
University of Texas at Austin.
As a result of this survey, 54 definable sites were recorded
within the limits of this property. Of the 45 prehistoric sites,
20 are considered to warrant investigation beyond that carried
out during this reconnaissance. General recommendations regarding
site preservation and alternatives designed to mitigate the
possible loss or damage to specific site locations are presented.
Recommendations are also made pertaining to the preservation aud
avoidance of possible ad~rse effects concerning nine historic
sites. Recorded sites that may be affected by environmental
alterations and limited surface collections from these localities
are briefly described.
As an aspect of the study, it was determined that no sites
or areas currently listed in the National Register of Historic
Places or the National Register of Natural Landmarks are located
in or near project-affected areas.

INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this report is to document the results of an
evaluative archeological and historical reconnaissance of areas
to be affected by the proposed nuclear power plant and associated
facilities in Austin Cuunty, Texas, and prospective power transmission lines in Aust.in, Waller, Fort Bend, and Harris counties,
Texas. Specifically, ~his coverage included about 11,000 acres
for the power plant ;.1.:d cooling -reservoir and approximately 270
miles of proposed pi:· i !.;ary and secondary routes for the transmission line rigl1ts-of-way. The work was carried out in November
of 1972 by the Texas 'rcheological Salvage Project, The University
of Texas at Austin.
The reconnaissance was intended to locate and evaluate,
insofar as surf icial inspection and minor subsurface probes would
allow the significance of cultural resources which might be
affected by land alteration or construction activities associated with this project. Under terms of an agreement with Dames
and Moore, acting for the Houston Lighting and Power Company, the
Texas Archeological Salvage Project undertook this study with the
following specific aims:
1.

To precisely locate and define the present condition
of any archeological/historical sites and features.
Particular attention was directed toward determining
the presence, if any, of sites listed in, or in
consideration for, the National Register of Historic
Places;

2.

To evaluate the scientific or historic significance
of any previously recorded or newly discovered archeological and historic sites, as well as any artifacts
found to be associated with these localities;

3.

To determine the extent of any adverse effects upon
these cultural resources which could not be avoided
should the proposal be implemented;

4.

To make recommendations concerning the possibility of
alternatives to the proposed actions which might preserve, avoid, or minimize damage to any archeological
or historic site which has potential for providing
significant information relative to our understanding
of the cultural lifeways of the local prehistoric and
historic inhabitants; and

1

,•
5.

To determine the presence of areas listed on the
National Register of Natural Landmarks in possible
conflict with project-related modifications.

The area under consideration, from the communities of
Sealy to Fairbanks, has been described as included within the
Coastal Plains Physiographic Province, a well-defined lowland
that borders the coasts of the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic
Ocean (Atwood 1940). A subarea, more particular to this region,
is termed by Fenneman (1938) as the West Gulf Coastal Plain.
The late Quaternary geological history of this part of the
Gulf Plains has been relatively well documented. The major
activity of the period was the development of the coastal
shoreline. The late Pleistocene marked the period of the decline of sea level, which forced the coastal rivers, such as
the Brazos and Colorado to deeply erode and entrench their
valleys to reach their gradients.

-.

,-....

- ,/

The drainage system of the area is quite young (Sutherland
1908) with th~ pre-Pleistocene rivers--the Colorado, San Bernard,
and Brazos--heading inland and passing across the coastal plain
which they have deeply incised. Smaller streams and bayous of
Pleistocene origin head at springs along the plain or are the
r~sult of localized runoff.
The topography of the region is characterized by rivercut scarps of the Late Pleistocene Brazos deltaic plain situated
east and west of the present day Br~zos entrenchment. Also
present are many oxbows (abandoned channels) and old river scars
turning much of the land into a low, swampy area.
The area of concern lies on the northern periphery of the
Gulf Coastal Plain soils. Soils in the area are of two types:
(1) from the shoreline to about 10 miles inland the soll is
highly saline and high in alkalincs; (2) from 10 miles to about
50-60 miles inland is the black Lake Charles clay overlying the
lighter, earlier Beaumont clays. In many places the later soil
has been blown away, exposing the older clay.

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
The immediate study area has had very little previous
archeological investigation which has been reported in published
form. In 1S47, Joe Ben Wheat, then of the Smithsonian Institution,
surveyed part .of the area to be enclosed in the proposed Addicks
Reservoir west of Houston. He located 13. sites and partially
excavated two of them (Wheat, 1953). The primary transmission
line right-of-way in the Addicks Dam area will intersect several
of the previously recorded archeological sites in that area. (see
Fig. 2). In 1969-70 Lawrence E. Aten of the Texas Archeological
Salvage Project extensiveJy excavated three shell middens near
Galveston (Aten, 197la) and also another shell midden near Lake
Jackson (Aten, 197lb). In addition Rice University has excavated
a series of shell middens in the Galveston Bay-Chocolate Bay area .
. To the north of Sealy, near Bellville, the Albert-George
Site has been excavated (Walley, 1955). This is a sand midden,
quite distinct from the shell sites encountered nearer the coast.

RESEARCH TECHNIQUES
Before initiating the field work, a considerable amount
of time was devoted to researching available records pertaining
to the known archeological and historical sites in the immediate
area which had been reco~ed from previous investigations. The
review included a thorough examination of the maps and project
descriptions provided by the sponsoring organization, available
geological information, and other pertinent literature, as well
as a bircf study of artifact collections from this general region
now housed at the Anthropological Laboratories, The University of
Texas at Austin. An evaluation of the areas to be affected was
also included based on an examination of black and white as well
as infrared photographs provided by Dames and Moore. When sites were located, they were photographed and recorded
on standard University of Texas at Austin archeological survey
forms, and limited surface collections were made. Sites were
also plotted on U.S.G.S. 7.5" quad maps, using standard trinomial
notation, which will be available to the sponsoring organization.
These will be provided to augment the reduced size locational
maps included with this report (Figs. 1 and 2).
In relation to the evaluation of sites, particular attention
was devoted to assessing the intensity with which the power plant
project would affect the preservation of sites.
Physical inspection of all of the areas to be affected was
impaired somewhat by dense ground cover in many areas and slowed
in some cases by difficultie$ in obtaining access to privately
owned lands. It is felt, however, that the surficial inspection
of the plant site area was adtquate. It was not possible to
extend observations to an estimated 15 percent of the proposed
reservoir pool area. This is not considered a serious lack of
survey coverage, particularly in view of the virtually complete
lack of archcologlcal remains noted elsewhere within the Brazos
River floodplain where the reservoir is planned.
Reconnaissance relating to the transmission line right-of-way
was of a selective nature, due to the allotted time and the extent
of both the primary and secondary routes. However, the probability
factor of non-reported sites along the lines was significantly

4

••
reduced by directing coverage toward the affected drainage systems
and mounded areas where prehistoric occupational sites are most
likely to occur. Recorded historic sites within one mile of the
pr.oposed transmission lines were considered to be within an endangered range and therefore warranted documentation in this report.
Prior to the field reconnaissance, the archivist researched
.various state and local historical records pertaining to the concerned areas. Of particular value were the documents made
available by the State Historical Survey Committee in their Austin
offices. Field work by the archivist entailed consultations with
local historical societies and landowners in an attempt to locate
and accurately plot on maps any significant historical markers or
sites to be affected by the project activities.
All forms of field documentation and artifact collections
made will be housed in the Anthropological Laboratories, Balcones
Research Center, The University of Texas at Austin, where they
will be available for studies.

GENERAL NATURE OF THE ARCHEOLOGICAL AND HISTORIC RESOURCES
During the process of reconnaissance, 34 archeological and
9 historical sites were recorded.
In addition, 10 previously
discovered archeological sites which lie along or near the proposed
routes and boundaries of the transmission line rights-of-way are
presented within the context of this report. The evidence of
prehistoric occupation varies from that of small chipping stations
and/or occupational areas to extensive lithic an<l pottery bearing
sites. One possible human burial site was reported, 41 AU 36.
The nine historic sites consisted of one community and three local
family cemeteries alpng with two old homesteads in the power plant
and reservoir area, and three historical markers situated near the
transmission routes under consideration. Noticeable structural
features (other than historic), such as hearths and burned. rock
middens, were not observed during the reconnaissance.
Thirty-four of the resource localities are located primarily
along the bluffline bounding most of the proposed cooling reservoir
area. A few sites lie on Allens Creek in the western section of
the plant site area. No sites were encountered in the bottomlands.
The remaining twenty-one localities are scattered along or near
the primary and secondary transmission line rights-of-way from the
plant to the hook-up with existing systems. Locations of the sites
in reference to project boundaries are shown in Figures 1 and 2.
As revealed by cut banks and minor subsurface probes, cultural
deposits in most of the sites appear to be no deeper than 2 feet.
A large percentage of the sites S'eem to be fairly intact and undisturbed except for a few that are subject to erosion and bisection
by farm roads.
Until further work is carried out in the area, the temporal and
geographic affiliation of those aboriginal groups occupying the
above mentioned sites cannot be conclusively demonstrated. However, based upon the incidence and comparison of specific artifacr
types from the concerned area, it is believed that similarities
exist with previously defined prehistoric culture groups of the Gulf
Coastal Plains and Central Texas regions.
The time-diagnostic artifacts found included an example of
an established dart point type, Williams, and several other miscellaneous forms representative of the Middle Archaic through
early post-Archaic, or "Nee-American" period. Other diagnostic
specimens representing the "Neo-American" period are Scallorn

6

I

•

and Perdiz arrow points, and Goose Creek Plain pottery fragments
and various untyped arrow points. These diagnostic artifact
forms have been proven to present relatively consistent stratigraphic associations at several sites in the Gulf Coastal Plains
and Central Texas region of Texas, and appear to range from about
A.D. 1500-2500 B.C. The only evidence of the earlier "Paleo-Indian"
occupation is represented by several Angostura and lanceolate type
dart point fragments in a private collection from site 41 AU 18
and possibly an untyped lanceolate dart point fragment from
41 AU 13.
The reported archeological sites in Harris County appear to
fit into the Southeast Texas Archaic culture unit termed the "La
Harpe Aspect" (Johnson, 1962) and the later "Galveston Bay Focus."

HISTORICAL ASPECTS OF THE STUDY
At the close of the 17th century, southeast Austin County
was within the range of a group of Indians known collectively
as Karankawan. The principal bands, sharing a common language
and culture, included the Cujane, Karankawa, Guapite, Coco,
and Copanc. These groups occupied at least the central portion
of the Texas Gulf Coast and an adjacent inland zone at the time
of initial contact with the Europeans (Bolton 1915).
The first records of positive contact with the Karankawan
were made by La Salle when he built Fort St. Louis at Matagorda
Bay.
In 1687 Joutel mentions them as Koienkahe and represents
them as living between Matagorda Bay and the Colorado River
(Hodge 1907:657).
Three e~rly explorations are recorded as having passed
through southeast Austin" County. In 1686 La Salle, on route
from Matagorda Bay to the rancherias of the "Cenis" (a Caddoan
group) on the Trinity River, passed through the area. In 1689
Captain A~onso De ~eon_lcd his fourth expedition through the
area and in 1690 his fifth exploration followed nearly the same
route (Castaneda 1936: map following p. 444).
The Karankawan declined quickly after the arrival of the
white men.
It is probable that Karankawa were living on St.
Bernard Bay in 1707-1721 and by 1793 a part of the Karankawa
had become Christianized and were living at the mission of
Nuestra Senora del Refugio at Aransas Bay. The decline of the
tribe began in earnest with the settlement of Stephen F. Austin's
colony on the Brazos in 1823. Settlers and Karankawas clashed
frequently. The result of these conflicts was a major battle
between the Indians and settlers. About half the tribe was
killed, and the survivors fled to a presidio on the San Antonio
River called La Bah{a (Hodge 1907:657).
In July, 1823, Stephen F. Austin and the Baron de Bastrop
established San Felipe de Austin on the old Atascosito crossing
of the Brazos River as the headquarters of the colony. The
present town of San Felipe lies approximately six miles north
of the proposed plant site. In 1823, the colony covered considerable territory. There were no legal boundaries for the
colony and a 11 the 1£1.j1d between the Gulf of Mexico and the Old
San Antonio Road, and between the Lavaca River and the San
Jaci11to River was considered part of the colony's land grant.
Built 011 a high prairie overlooking a bend in· the Brazos, San
Felipe had about 20 log houses in 1828. In April, 1836, the
8

••
community was burned by the settlers when Sam Houston and the
Texas Army withdrew from the Brazos. The townspeople returned
and partially rebuilt San Felipe in 1837. Some of the earliest
settlers of San Felipe were Josiah H. Bell, James B. Miller,
Godwin B. Cotton, and Gail Borden (files of the State Historical
Survey Committee, Austin).
In the 1870's San Felipe sold part of its townsite to the
Gulf, Colorado, and Santa Fe Railroad. The result of this
transaction was the development of the township of Sealy,
located five miles west of San Felipe (Webb 1945:550).

Historic Sites in Plant Area
At the time of this study it was determined that there were
no sites in Austin County (which includes the power plant and
reservoir area) listed on the National Register of Historic Places
nor are there any under current consideration for nomination to
the Registry. However, there is a Texas State Historical Marker
located at the previously mentioned Hrtt1. century· colony of San
Felipe de Austin.
I~~~
Three historic cemetery sites were· located by the archeological survey party which examined the plant site area and a
fourth discovered subsequently. Additionally the remains of two
historic structures (41 AU 32, 33) were encountered.
The first cemetery is locally referred to as Allen's
Cemetery. It is approximately 20 feet by 30 feet in extent
and consists of ten visible gravestones. The exact number of
marked interments is difficult to determine because of a heavy
brus~1 cover on the site.
The dates on these stones range from
1871 to 1892. The cemetery lies on land granted to Antonio
Mancha on December 22, 1832.
The second family cemetery is much smaller, about ten feet
square, and contains only four gravestones, one of which is
facing up and readable. This marker notes the death in 1854 of
a Mr. Walker. The graves lie on land originally granted to
Stephen Richardson on April 23, 1831.
The third family cemetery situated north of site 41 AU 34 on
the Alvin Marek property is bisected by the 125 foot contour line.
This ce1netery was discovered subsequent to the field reconnaissance
described herein.
The Wallis Cemetery is a community cemetery maintained and
operated by the City of Wallis. The area is about 100 yards by
80 yards in si2e, and is still being utilized as a graveyard.
Some of the older gravestones date in the late 1800's, a fact
possibly enhanc:ing its historical value.

Recorded ·Historic Sites Along Proposed Transmission Lines
There are no sites on the National Register of Historic
Places in reasonable proximity to the proposed transmission
line rights-of-way nor are any under active consideration for
nomination to the Registry. There are, however, three sites
marked by State Historic Markers within a zone of one mile
along the rights-of-way.
The first of these is the Thomas Barnett Home, a historic
structure in Fort Bend County. It is approximately 0.7 miles
north of the proposed transmission lines and about 5.0 miles
northwest of the town of Rosenberg (Fig. 2). It is a pioneer
home built by Thomas Barnett in 1836. Mr. Barnett was one of
the original colonists to the area, an alcalde, a signer of the
Texas Declaration of Independence, and a member of the first
Congress. The house was burned by Santa Anna's Army and rebuilt
by Barnett in 1836 after the Battle of San Jacinto.· The home
is located on the property of J.F.D. Moore (files of the State
Historical Survey Committee, Austin).

... /

The San Felipe Town Hall in Austin County _is another
historic marker site within one mile of the proposed transmission lines (Fig. 2). Situated on a local road leading
northeast off F.M. 1458, the structure is about 0.5 miles
south of the historic area of Stephen 'p. Austin State Park. The
building is the successor to the 1828 hall used by the
"Ayuntamiente" (Town Council). The conventions of 1832, 1833,
and the consultation of 1835, leading to the Texas Rev6lution,
met there. It was burned during the revolution in 18 3 6. The
two story section of the present structure was built about
1842 and may have served as the county courthouse until 1847.
After 1900 it was joined to a one story school and moved to the
present site in 1915 (file& of the State Historical Survey
Committee, Austin).
An historic marker noting the site of San Felipe de Austin
lies almost directly in the path of the proposed transmission
right of way (Fig. 2). This marker is located off F.M. 1458
approximately 0.5 miles north of Interstate 10. It notes San
Felipe <le Austin as being the first Anglo-American Capital of
Texas. In July 26, 1823, it became the capital of Austin's
colony (files of the Texas Historical Survey Committee).

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This report details the results of an archeological and
historical reconnaissance of portions of areas to be affected
by proposed land modifications of the Houston Lighting and
Power Company 'nuclear polifCr plant and associated power transmission line rights-of-way. During the course of the field work
44 sites were recorded, in addition to investigations pertaining
to 10 previously reported sites situated either within or near
the currently planned boundaries of this project.
It should be pointed out at this time that no sites,
historic or prehistoric, in areas to be affected by modifications
associated with the power plant site proper, cooling reservoir,
or associated transmission lines were found to be currently in
the National Register of Historic Places. Additionally, none of
these sites are known to be under current consideration for
nomination tc this Registry.
Research carried out during this study indicated that project
related modifications do not conflict with any known areas in the
National Registry of Natural Landmarks. The only listing known
for this region is the Attwater Prairie Chicken Preserve in
Colorado County, clearly well away from the area of concern.*
The reconnaissance did determ~ne, however, that a number of
significant archeological and historic localities will, or may
be, detrimentally affected by the proposed project. The results
of our investigations indicate that this is particularly true in
the proposed area of the plant site and adjacent cooling reservoir. Ilere, the proposed constr:uction activities would likely
destroy or damage, or remove from the possibility of future
investigation, several localities deemed significant. For this
reason, recommendations relative to protective management or
measures designed to lessen the effect of loss of certain of
these resource areas are provided.
Ide3lly the avoidance of any lan<l alterations or developments on or near these resources would preserve their present
condition. Any environmental modifications directly or indirectly
affecting t11e data contained in these definable localities
results in an irreversible and irretrievable loss for historic
and scientific study. Many of the sites reported herein are
dcemeJ significant partially because of their potential to produce rel ial>Jc information pertaining to. the current scanty
archeological record in this region.

••
The basic strategy involved in mitigation of loss or damage
to these sites would be initiation of a program involving subsurface testing of selected sites prior to intensive excavations.
Subsurface investigations would re-examine those areas only
surficially covered in the study just completed.
A brief p~esentation of our rationale for specific site
recommendations along with these specific suggestions is given
below. Specific site recommendation for the reported definable
resources are arranged into two classes:
(1) no further investigation recommended, and (2) recommended for further study during
a course of subsurface testing.

-

Twenty-seven archeological sites documented during this
reconnaissance are judged to have no significant potential for
yielding useful scientific or historic information beyond that
gathered during this reconnaissance. These sites are: 41 AU 9,
41 AU 10 , 41 AU 11 , 41 AU 12 , 41 AU 15, 41 AU 16, 41 AU 1 7 ,
41 AU 20, 41 AU 22, 41 AU 24, 41 AU 25, 41 AU 29, 41 AU 30,
41 AU 32, 41 AU 33, 41 AU 34, and 41 AU 39 in thef1 power plar.t
and reservoir area, and 41 FB 18, 41 FB 19, 41 ~41 WL 10,
41 WL 11, 41 HR 5, 41HR181, 41 HR 184, 41 HR 188, and 41 HR 208
near the power transmission rights-of-way.
A total of 20 definable archeological sites are deemed to
exhibit either demonstrable or highly probable potential for
yielding information of value. These localities exhibit such
characteristics as extended or concentrated areas of occupational
refuse and/or evidence of relatively undisturbed deposits.
Specifically, these archeological sites include: 41 AU 8,
41 AU 13, 41 AU 14, 41 AU 18, 41 AU 19, 41 AU 21, 41 AU 23,
41 AU 26, 41 AU 27, 41 AU 28, 41 AU 31, 41 AU 35, 41 AU 36,
41 AU 37, and 41 AU 38. In ~he power transmission line rightsof-way these sites are 41 HR 187, 41 HR 206, 41 HR 207, 41 HR 214,
and 41 WL 9.
The above are considered to warrant further investigation.
Historic resource areas include three sites situated near
planned transmission line rights-of-way (i.e., Thomas Barnett
Home, San Felipe Town Hall, and San Felipe de Austin). It is
our belief that these three sites, each of which is identified
by an historic marker, can be readily avoided by proposed primary
and secondary transmission line routes. Aside from the factor of
direct conflict, however, the possibility is that the aesthetic
value of hjstoric sites and markers might be affected by improper
placement of transmission line structures.

12

Recognized historic localities in the Allens Creek plant
site area include four cemeteries, none of which appear to have
particular historic significance. Present engineering plans
suggest that all would be physically affected by modifications.
It is therefore indicated that they be relocated in accordance
with current state laws.
In summary, our general recommendations based on an evaluation
of the reconnaissance reported herein are:
1.

Protective management measures should be conducted
where possible to preserve the present condition of
all cultural resource localities. Such measures
appear to be particularli feasible in transmission
line rights-of-way.

2.

In such areas as the plant and reservoir site where
protection is not feasible, mitigative measures should
include selective test excavations in the 20 areas
described above. Intensive excavations of a sampling
of these sites, based on the results of test excavations
should be carried out by a professional archeological
research agency or institution acceptable to the State
Historical Survey Committee and the U.S. National
Park Service.

3.

Historic cemeteries and markers should be either
relocated or avoided by construction activities;
the farmer should be handl e.d in accordance with
state statutes and the latter under close liaison
with the Texas State Historical Survey Committee.

APPENDIX 1
DESCRIPTION OF SITES
All archeological and historical sites located by the
reconnaissance team within the proposed limits of the nuclear
power plant and adjoining routes of the power transmission line
rights-of-way under consideration are listed in Table l along
with the location, description, recommendations, and the character
of any material cultural evidence retrieved during the surface
reconnaissance.
~
When possible, the depth of deposits at site locations was
determined by minor shovel testing, personal observations of
cutbanks, or both.
All references to named geograph~c areas in the following
table are found on the Wallis 7.5" Quadrangle Map (U.S.G.S.).
Sites are numbered in the standard trinomial system used
widely in the United States. In this system of designation,
"41" is the numerical designation for the State cf Texas; letter
designators represent abbreviations for counties (i.e., "AU" for
Austin County, "F8" for Fort Bend County, "HR" for Harris County,
and "WL" for Waller County); and the final number identifies the
specific site locality. This particular sequence is keyed to
that established in the files of the Anthropological Laboratories,
The.University of Texas at Austin. Gaps in the numerical
sequence to follow represent previously recorded sites in the
above counties which are not located in project-affected areas.

Numbered Archeological and Historic Sites in Plant Site Area
Site No. and Location

Description and Recommendation

Materials Collected

Consists of a fairly r1cn concentration of cultural debris lying on
sandy knoll adjacent to creek. Most
materials collected came from the
southern slope of the area, which is
subject to fairly intensive erosion.
Horizontal extent is small, though
deposit seems fairly deep.
Area: 50 yds. x 45 yds.
Recommendations: Subsurface testing
based on depth of deposit and abundance of cultural debris. Site appears
to have potential for providing useful
scientific data.

APPENDIX 2
DESCRIPTION OF ARTIFACTS
Artifacts made of both lithic and clay materials were
recovered during the reconnaissance. For the purpose of this
tentative classification and descriptive presentation, specimens were placed in the following general functional and/or
morphological categories: Chipped Stone, including arrow
points, dart points, unstemmed bifaces, cores, unifaces,
scrapers, utilized flakes, and non-utilized flakes; and Clay
Artifacts, including pottery and burned clay. When possible,
further subdivisions were made within each of these categories.
Such classificatory procedures were somewhat limited, however,
due to the highly fragmented nature of many specimens.
Formal projectile point and pottery type nomenclature
adhere generally to the Handbook of Texas Archeology: ~
Descriptions (Suhm and Jelks, 1962T; other categories follow
Aten (197la, 197lb), and Wheat (1953).

/

·\_

The lithic artifacts recovered were probably made from
locally available cherts found in gravel beds along the nearby
Brazos River.* The color of these chert samples and the artifacts range from light to dark brown through various shades of
black, white, and red. The clay artifacts were also probably
made from the vast supply of locally available material.

Chipped Stone
A total of 18 specimens are placed into this category, and
are distinguished into two general categories, those artifacts
produced by bifacial chipping and those produced by unifacial
chipping. Further subdivisions are made on the basis of morphological characteristics.

* This statement is based on field crews collection of a sizeable
quantity of these materials from the gravel beds for comparative
studies.

Arrow Points
A total of 4 arrow points were recovered; all have slightly
fragmented bases.
Scallorn (1 specimen)
The one example of this type is extremely well made and is
missing only one corner of the base. It is made from a grayish
chert and is bifacially chipped with precise retouch along the
edge.
Perdiz (2 specimens)
The two points assigned to this category are done so
tentatively, since both have missing bases. However, it does
appear on both examples that the partially-remaining base is
contracting, hence the assignment. One example is fairly well
made of brown chert and is missing the base, tip, and one tang.
The other specimen, also without stem and tip, is made of white
chert and has minute retouch along both edges.
Untyped I (1 specimen)

-·-...,,-----...,

This point has a triangular blade with slightly convex edges
and moderately barbed shoulders. Only one face of the blade
displays minute marginal retouches along the edges. Shoulders
and stem have been formed by wide corner notching, making the
shoulders perpendicular to the stem. Stem is slightly contracting
and narrow. General characteristics of the base are undeterminable due to its fragmented· nature. Overall craftsmanship is
good and point is similar to the type Perdiz.

Dart Points
A total of seven dart points were found.
complete--the others are basal fragments.

Only two are

Williams (1 specimen)
Point is large and well-made, with typical expanding,
slightly bulbar stem. Point is broken, but base is intact and
slightly convex in form. Edges are strongly serrated. Material
is a translucent chert.

42

,•
Catan-like (1 specimen)

0

This specimen resembles the type Catan in that it is a
shoulder-less, lozenge-shaped point. It is much longer, however,
than the average Catan. The point is 5.5 cm. long and is quite
well executed. The base has been thinned, probably as an aid to
hafting. The point is made of a light brown chert.
Expanding Stem Type r (3 specimens)
One specimen is represented by only the base, midsection,
and one tang. Material used is marbled chert. The second
specimen is complete except for one tang. Material used is
chert; patination has obscured the original color. Point is
very well made. The third specimen, also well executed, is of
chert and patinated. Stems slightly expand with the stem length
being less than one-quarter of the total length.
Untyped I (1 specimen)
This unique specimen is missing a stem through breakage,
but at one time had either a straight or contracting stem. The
point is quite long and is crudely made. The thickness of the
point (cortex remains on one face), even at the tip may reflect
breakage during manufacture. The point is made of a poor
quality flint not conducive to controlled ch~pping.
Untyped II (1 specimen)
The middle and basal end of a lanceolate shaped projectile
point was recovered. The outline of the specimen appears to
have slightly convex edges wi.th the broadest part near the
middle. The base is deeply concave and displays slight basal
grinding on one face of the blade. A peculiaT characteristic
exhibited is what appears to be channeling on both faces, but
only on part of the specimen, and not enough to make the central
section very thin or concave on both faces. The base is too
deeply cut to resemble Clovis and Folsom points; the channeling
feature distinguishes it from the Plainview type.

Unstemmed Biface Fragments
Under this category are grouped seven well made fragments.
Most of these small specimens may represent basal portions of
projectile points; one is pointed enough to have functioned as
the tip of a point. The unbroken ends of these pieces include
round, straight, or pointed forms .

"
Cores
(11 specimens)
Single prepared and non-prepared platforms are represented
among the artifacts. All have multi-facets, nine of which are
block-like and two of which are rectangular in form. All speciments represent large flint nodules or have been reduced from
such. Two of the artifacts exhibit abrasions along one edge,
possibly indicating their use as battering stones.

Unifaces
Artifacts which have been flaked only on one face are
placed in this category. This classification includes scrapers,
utilized flakes, and miscellaneous chipping debris.
SCRAPERS
These artifacts are divided into two groups based on
morphological attributes.
Discoidal Scraper (1 specimen)

'

1....._,,,1'

This artifact is circular in outline and was made from a
very large percussion flake. The utilized edge is perpendicular
to the bulb of percussion. Specimen has been unifacially
trimmed on the dorsal side, yet retains a small amount of cortex
near the utilized side.
Elongated Side-end Scraper (1 specimen)
The specimen is made from the long prismatic blade. The
primary utilized edge is opposite the bulb of percussion; only
one long edge displays secondary retouching and evidence of
slight usage. No cortex is retained on the specimen.

Miscellaneous Chipping Debris
Utilized Flakes (16 specimens)
Presumably these artifacts were modified by use. Minute
identations or smoothing and polishing are evidenced along one
or more edges on all specimens. Only four can be classified

44

,a

readily as blades; the rema1n1ng 12 specimens are irregular in
form. Nine of these flakes exhibit bilateral indentations and
seven are lateral. E{gh% of the artifacts have cortex, almost
all of which is on the striking platform.
Non-Utilized Flakes (677 specimens)
This general category represents miscellaneous chipping
debris and includes flint flakes and chips which were formed
and discarded as a result of reducing cores and preforms in
the preparation of producing lithic tools. None of these
specimens exhibit any use as characterized by marginal indentations or smoothing and polishing on the edges. Although these
artifacts could be separated into more distinguishable and
definable classifications, it is unnecessary for tne purpose of
this report.

Clay Artifacts

category (see Suhm and Jelks 1962:55-57). The main chracteristic
of this pottery is sandy paste with no apparent temper. Four
of the sherds are.quite hard and are not easily broken, a trait
which is unusual for this type.
Bone-Tempered Plain (2 specimens)
Two pieces with obvious inclusions were recovered. No
attempt at placing these sherds in a named category was made;
bone-tempered ceramics are commonly reported from Central Texas
and also from gulf coastal areas in the vicinity of Rockport.

Burned Clay Fragments (7 specimens)
These items range in size from a few millimeters to 5 or
6 centimeters in diameter. The pieces are burned in varying
degrees. By examining their cross sections it can be inferred
that some show evidence of burning in the form of a crust on
their exterior; others appear to have been burned throughout.

APPENDIX 3
SUGGESTIONS fOR THE FUTURE
David S. Dibble
The high probability of detrimental effects occurring to a
number of archeological sites as a direct or indirect result of
the construction and use of the Allens Creek plant site and
reservoir has, I feel, been demonstrated by the reconnaissance
reported herein. On the other hand, with the possible exception
of the known site concentration in the Addicks Dam area (Fig. 2),
engineering latitudes possible in transmission line routes appear
to effectively minimize conflicts with known historic or prehistoric sites along or near those rights-of-way now under
consideration.
Although none of the archeological resources identified at
the Allens Creek plant and reservoir site seem worthy of listing
in the National Register of Historic Places or are demonstrably
of major historic or scientific importance, a number of localities
have been characterized in this report as exhibiting ".significant"
value (see CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS and Table 1). These
evaluations are based on the observed characteristics listed on
page 12. The degree to which these sites in project areas exhibit
extraordinary qualities or are unique to the lower Brazos River
region is not possible to adequately assess. This is due to the
fact that professional archeological investigations in this general
region have been very limited.
Nonetheless it can be confidently stated that most, if not
all, of the sites recommended for further serious concern (p. 12
and Appendix 1) do show potential for p,roviding valuable scientific and historic information. For this reason the general
conclusions and recommendations presented by the main authors in
this report are seconded here. The following points represent
enlargements or commentary on recommendations provided herein
(p. 13):

(1)

Twenty sites listed as exhibiting significant potential
for productive investigation should be given serious
consideration in final plans for land modification
at the Allens Creek development. Those archeological
sites which can feasibly be left in their present
condition and not be damaged or destroyed by direct

48

or indirect result of construction or use of the
facility woul~ provide a valuable resource for
future study.J·Our first recommendation, then, is
that as many as possible of thest;) sites be avoided
by project-related developments~
2•

When final engineering plans make it possible to
precisely identify those archeological sites which
cannot be effectively avoided by necessary project
mod if ica t ions, it is strongly re(:o;·•1;.1ended that the
Houston Lighting and Power Company ~ponsor a program
of intensive archeological survey. l.n "inten,.sive
survey" has been well defined as ''a. comprehensive and
extended physical examination of an area, for the
purpose of obtaining an accurate sample of data on
all archeological resources, situations, and associated
environmental variables."* This work would require
significant test excavation in order to precisely
define the characteristics of these resources. The
result of such a study would be to provide the basis
for designing a program of intensive excavation of a
representative sampling of site areas which cannot be
preserved. Completion, in turn, of this intensive
sampling should be sufficient for effective mitigation
'of the impact of the project on archeological resources.

As is obvious from Figure i, Appendix 1 (this report) and
from large scale maps submitted with this report, archeological
sites are virtually restricted to bluffline or near-bluffline
positions bordering the present Brazos River flood plain. In these
positions they are vulnerable or, at best, potentially vulnerable
to inundation by the planned reservoir. Too, land modifications
associated with contruction in the plant site and cooling reservoir
preparation must be consid~red in assessing any threat to significant archeological localities. It appears that, based on present
development plans, a number of valuable sites would be subject to
damage or _destruction or effectively removed from investigation in
the foreseeable future. Upon this basis it is suggested that the
Houston Lighting and Power Company consider the potential threat to
the known archeological localities at such time as specific design
and development plans are final at the Allens Creek Site. Further,

it is recommended that necessary mitigation of any unavoidable
impact be carried out in the reasonably near future through
sponsorship of a program of intensive archeological survey
followed by intensive excavation at a number of localities
considered representative and realistic by a responsible archeological research organization. As mentioned in the foregoing
report, such an organization should be recommended by the State
_Historical Survey Committee and the National Park Service.
The time required to complete the field work necessary for
a two-phase program of investigation such as described above would
of course vary~ however, based on the present estimate of the
numbers of archeological sites which would probably be affected
by present plans and the operating capability of the organization
represented by the writer, it is felt that a period of from four
to six months would bt:: sufficient.
