The Gregg Ranch Site (41HY131), Hays County, Texas
Howard D. Land

ABSTRACT
Excavations at the Gregg Ranch site (41HY131) revealed the presence
of man on the’Blanco River in Hays County,’Texas, for a period that spans
10,000 years, from mid-Paleo-Indian to Late Prehistoric periods of the Central Texas Archaic. In addition to providing supplemental information on
previously defined Archaic traditions, archeological data from site 41HY 131
shows that relations existed between late Paleo-Indian and very early Archaic traditions long suspected of overlapping in both time and space. The
site also yielded new variants of Early Archaic projectile points as well as
evidence suggesting the existence of an early occupation shelter.

INTRODUCTION
The primary objective of this report is to supplement previous studies of
early man in Texas and to corroborate certain ideas that recently have become
evident in Texas archeology. This includes support of previously defined chronological sequences for Central Texas, with the addition of new information, the
identification of specialized tools, and the formulation of a hypothesis for the
settlement patterns at the Gregg Ranch site. Special emphasis has been placed on
Late Paleo-Indian through Early Archaic data called San Geronimo (Weir 1976a).
The Gregg Ranch site (41HY131) is a multicomponent occupation site on a
low terrace of the Blanco River, a tributary of the Guadalupe River in Hays
County, Texas. The site is about 6.4 km (4 miles) west of Kyle on the land of
A. W. Gregg (Figure 1). Limited excavations were carried out by the writer and
Paul Duke, of Austin, on weekends and holidays from August 1976 through May
1977.
Description of the Site
The Gregg Ranch site is a single burned rock midden situated on a low alluvial terrace on the north side of the Blanco River (Figures 2, 3). The terrace is
about 20 meters wide; it is bounded by a limestone bluff about 3 meters high
(Figure 3, b) on the north and by the river’s flood plain on the south (Figure 4).
The river channel is about 60 meters south of the terrace, and about 60 meters
east of the site is an intermittent creek. The midden is in front of the bluff (Figure 3, b) where limestone is readily available for cultural needs. The midden was

easily identifiable by surface concentrations of burned rock, hearths, snail
shells, lithic debris, and dark soil. Artifacts and surface lithic scatters are sparsely
distributed in the vicinity of the site, particularly on the higher terrace that over!ooks the site. From surface indications, the midden was judged to be about 20
meters wide and 50 meters long (Figure 5).
Previous Investigations
Limited excavations have been carried out in the area by several universities
in conjunction with surveys in the San Marcos and Blanco drainages. Excava-

tions were carried out at the Greenhaw site (41HY29) by Frank Weir from 1974
to 1976 (Weir 1979), but no previous excavations or surveys are known to have
been made in the Gregg Ranch area.

Environment
The character and location of the Gregg Ranch site, situated directly on the
Balcones escarpment at the eastern rim of the Edwards Plateau offered many advantages to aboriginal peoples. From it the faunal and floral resources of both the
Edwards Plateau and the Blackland Prairies, directly to the east, were easily accessible. A sheltered southern exposure provided more protection and warmer
average temperatures than are found on adjacent uplands. The large limestone
outcrop (Figures 5 and 3, b) also provided a readily available source of raw materials for hearths, ovens, shelter hold-down, and other uses. The presence nearby
of permanent water and a source of stone for making tools (Figures 2 and 3, a)
were especially favorable to settlement. Possibly in former times there was an
abundance of plants and both large and small game. By following the drainages
of nearby major streams, the inhabitants could traverse several biotic zones, a
situation that offered significant advantages for food procurement. The avail-

ability of vegetable foods was probably optimal and very suitable to the early
hunter-gatherer populations (Butzer 1971:151). Exploitation of molluscs and
fish is evidenced archeologically in late Paleo-Indian times as well as during the
Early and Middle Archaic. As the result of Pleistocene alluviation, it is apparent
that an old flood plain was stranded on the north bank of the Blanco River due to
down-cutting during drier periods. On the bench formed by the stranded flood
plain is the Gregg Ranch site, where the early inhabitants made their temporary
camps, starting about 10,000 years ago and lasting to Historic times. As time
passed and groups continued to use this favorable location, midden material and
occasional flood deposits accumulated until the site grew to a thickness of more
than 2 meters in some places. Climate undoubtedly played a major role in occupation and deposition at the site, affecting interrelations of soils, plants, animals, and man (cf. Butzer 1971:49-78). If the scenery and climate of the past
were similar to those of the present, the site area must have been a beautiful place
to live. The existence of a site at the Gregg Ranch was predictable because there
are so many favorable indicators in the vicinity today.

Excavation
To begin excavations at the Gregg Ranch site, a 20-meter north-south baseline was established between two datum reference points, bisecting the site. Excavations along this baseline were designated Area A, and an area 18 meters east
of the south datum point was designated Area B (Figures 5, 6). The writer was
responsible for Area A, and Paul Duke for Area B. We set an arbitrary elevation
of 210 meters (690 feet) for the north datum stake (the top of the stake was level
with the midden surface). Using reference data from U.S.G.S. 7.5 minute quadrangle San Marcos North, we constructed a grid system along the north datum
line and established the horizontal control point at the south datum stake, which
was designated N00-E00. All points on the site were measured from this datum.
Within squares, measurements were taken in centimeters starting at the southwest stake, moving to the east, then to the north. Vertical measurements were
taken from an established plane that was maintained throughout the excavation.
Measurements were recorded in field notes, and artifacts were recorded by provenience. These records made it possible to reconstruct excavated profiles and features (Figures 7, 8). Excavation was by arbitrary 10-centimeter levels, and material was screened through quarter-inch hardware cloth. All cultural material was
saved, except for burned rock and snail shells. All materials were separately
bagged, recorded, washed, and analyzed. More than 500 man-hours were spent
on 18 squares that ranged in depth between 90 and 200 cm.

Zone A (Surface Zone)
Consists, in the northern half of the site, of a dark brown compact midden
soil and, in the southern half of the site, a compact tan alluvial clay, probably
deposited by heavy flooding. This zone contains much burned rock (including
hearths), snail shells, bone, artifacts, and lithic debris. The tan soil is generally
sterile. The average thickness of Zone A is 10 cm.
Zone B (Main Occupation Zone)
Contains an abundance of dark gray to black midden soil, burned limestone
fragments, hearth stones, bone, snail shells, lithic debris, and artifacts. The
average thickness of Zone B is 80 cm (thinning out toward the edges~; and the
zone is at an average depth of 10 cm below the surface, extending over about half
of the site.
Zone C
A zone of loose, tan, sandy soil that contains much cultural debris, including diagnostic tools, mussel shell, snail shells, bone, and burned rock fragments.
The average thickness is 30 cm; the top of Zone C averages 90 cm below the
surface.
Zone D
Composed of loose, yellow, claylike soil that contains a small amount of
burned rock, snail shells, and cultural material. The average thickness of this
zone, encountered at an average depth of 110 cm below the surface, is 50 cm.
Zone E

A soil of light yellow compact clay that contains very little cultural material. This soil was encountered at an average depth of 160 cm below the surface
and extends to an undetermined depth.
Dating
No radiocarbon dates have been established for the Gregg Ranch site, so the
archeological sequence is in temporal limbo. Using previously established sequences from other sites in Central Texas, and closely adhering to the detailed
chronological framework established by Weir (1976a), the site can be dated with
the help of new data with a fair degree of confidence. The new data from the
Gregg Ranch site have not radically altered the picture of the cultural history of
Central Texas presented by Weir (1976a), but have corroborated his phases, especially the San Geronimo phase. The finding of Plainview, Barber, Scottsbluff(?), Angostura, Early Triangular, Gower, Hell Gap(?), and early barbed
projectile points and the remains of a possible shelter--all stratigraphically below Early Archaic materials--was fortuitous, and can be exploited scientifically.
Using approximations of Weir’s phase sequence for Central Texas, as well as
Paleo-Indian sequence data from the Devils Mouth site (Sorrow 1968:45-50)
and Baker Cave (Word 1970:98-105), the following time periods can be estimated for the Gregg Ranch site (Figure 8).

Provenience of the Artifacts
If each excavation unit at the Gregg Ranch site had been stratigraphica!ly
level and uniform in thickness, it would have been ideal to list individual 10-cm
levels chronologically for each of the eight squares, but the site had about a 15percent slope, and the thickness of the stratigraphic units varied.
During excavation, all vertical measurements were plotted on a profile chart
showing the east profile of all eight squares (Figure 7). Stratigraphic changes and
major features (burned rock, tan soil, yellow soil) were plotted from the field
measurements. Multiple occurrences of special cultural material (mainly the recognized projectile point types) were used to make inferences about time spans of
specific levels. Cultural phases proposed by Weir were the basis for establishing
time markers for Gregg Ranch site (Weir 1976a), as follows: Late Prehistoric
(400-1,500 BP); Twin Sisters (700-2,000 BP); San Marcos (1,800-2,800 BP);

86

Texas Archeological Society

Round Rock (2,600-4,200 BP); Clear Fork (4,000-5,000 BP); San Geronimo
(4,500-8,000 BP); and Paleo-Indian (7,000-12,000 BP). For postulating
chronological relations among artifacts, the Area A profile was divided arbitrarily into ten 20-cm levels (Table 1). These 10 levels are correlated with temporal phases (Weir 1976a) postulated from artifact types by various researchers
(Johnson 1964, 1967; Sorrow et al. 1967; Word and Douglas 1970; Hester 1971)
(Figure 8).
The occurrence of Nolan points (Clear Fork phase) consistently at the very
bottom of the primary burned rock midden suggests the start of a new life-style
about 5,000 years ago. Below this depth a different group of people (San Geronimo phase) is indicated, represented by early corner-notched points, early
barbed, and Uvalde-like points as described by Hester (1971:71) and others
(Johnson 1964, 1967; Sorrow et al. 1967; Word and Douglas 1970). Below the
San Geronimo phase (cf. Weir 1976a: 121-124) Paleo-Indian points are found
together with other material thought to represent a life-style slightly different
from that of the later, Archaic hunter-gatherers. Probably there was an overlap of
the late Paleo-Indian with the Early Archaic in Central Texas (Prewitt n.d.).
There are instances of Gower and Early Triangular points occurring stratigraphically with or below Plainview and Barber at the Gregg Ranch site (Table 1;
Figure 8).

Artifacts of the Clear Fork Phase and Earlier
In the descriptions below, emphasis is placed on artifacts found in the Clear
Fork, San Geronimo, and Paleo-Indian levels. Additional data and field notes are
on file at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin.
Projectile Points
Early Barbed Points
10 Specimens (Figure 9)
Description: Triangular with deeply cut corner notches and expanded stems;
base is usually inverted V-shaped with straight lines as opposed to the slightly
curved lines of the Martindale point, but sometimes rounded instead of V-shaped.
Workmanship good. Stone is usually a variety of homogeneous, dark Edwards
Plateau flint. Figure 9, i, often called Bandy, is typical of these points.
Dimensions: Length 32-57 mm; width across shoulders 30-40 mm; length
of stem 7-17 mm; depth of notches 6-10 mm; width of base 19-26 ram; thickness 4-7 mm.
Provenience: Area A, squares N08, N09, N11, N12, N14-E01, levels 5, 6,
and 7; most specimens came from level 6.
Remarks: These projectile points are of an unnamed type, similar in most
respects to Martindale (Suhm and Jelks 1962:213). However, barbed specimens are found consistently well below Early Archaic projectile points (Nolan,
Bulverde, and Travis) and just above types of the Paleo-Indian tradition (Angostura, Barber, Plainview). Similar types have been found in like context at La

Jita (Hester 1971 : 71-73), Baker Cave (Word and Douglas 1970: 21 - 25), Devils
Mouth (Johnson 1964: 2, 3), Stillhouse Hollow (Sorrow et al. 1967: 16- 24), Jetta
Court (Wesolowsky et al. 1976:46), San Geronimo, and Wilson-Leonard (Weir,
personal communication). Weir includes this type in the San Geronimo phase of
the Central Texas Archaic (Weir 1976a: 52, Figure 9, F and G). Several varieties
may become evident after additional work at Gregg Ranch or other early occupation sites in the region. There also appears to be some connection with the
Uvalde type, and a lanceolate variety (Figure 12, b).

Plainview Preform
1 Specimen (Figure 10, a)
Description: Percussion-flaked, parallel-sided, lanceolate biface with slightly
indented base and broken end; base is beveled as if preparation was being made
for final basal thinning. Flake scars create slighly irregular edges along both margins; has minimal retouch and no evidence of grinding on the lowest edge or
base. Stone is opaque tan flint. Specimen probably was discarded after breakage
occurred at the distal end.
Dimensions: Extrapolated length 80 mm; width across shoulders 20 mm;
thickness 7 mm.
Provenience: Square N10-E01, 149 cm below datum; assigned to level 7.
Remarks: Unlike most Archaic artifacts at the Gregg Ranch site, which
often have crusts, this specimen has a slight patina on one side; classed as a
Plainview preform because of its stratigraphic position in the site, workmanship,
shape, and probable stage in production.
Possible Lange
1 Specimen (Figure 10, b)
Description: Triangular with prominent shoulders resulting from deep corner notches and an expanding stem; base is straight and shows no evidence of
grinding; basal thinning by removal of short flakes. Stone is light tan flint. Good
workmanship; mainly percussion flaking with minor pressure retouch. Apparently an unfinished point that was broken during manufacture.
Dimensions: Extrapolated length 63 mm; extrapolated width across shoulders 35 mm; length of stem 10 mm; basal width 22 mm; thickness 6 mm.
Provenience: Square N12-E01, Area A, 147 cm below level 7 datum.
Remarks: In general this specimen fits within the range defined by Suhm
and Jelks (1962:203). The point was lying on edge below the Golondrina point
(level 7). If it is a Lange, it is considerably out of context. When found it was
believed to be in good context due to the compact soil that surrounded it and
because it had the encrustation that is typical on lithic debitage at this depth. But
there could have been some mixing resulting from soil cracking during dry periods or burrowing by rodents, although no evidence of burrows was noted. Assuming good context (10 cm below and near the Barber point), one can speculate
on its morphological relation to Paleo-Indian projectile points.

Barber
1 Specimen (Figure 11)
Description: Biface lanceolate point with deep concave base, smoothed (by
grinding) lateral edges, and slightly flared basal corner with recurved edge.
Flake removal was by either heavy pressure or a technique of closely controlled
percussion, resulting in oblique-parallel flaking. Good workmanship; minimal
amount of marginal retouch is probably the result of edge straightening; basal
thinning is of the crescent variety. Stone is opaque, gray flint. Cross section is
piano-convex, suggesting that a prismatic blade was the initial stage in the manufacturing process. Distal end, one edge, and one basal ear have been damaged; it
appears that an attempt was made to remove a flake at the distal end with a burin
stroke after breakage during manufacture. The resulting fractured tip may have
been used for cutting.
Dimensions: Extrapolated length 95 mm; maximum width 23 mm; basal
depth 7 ram; thickness 7 mm.
Provenience: Square N15-E01, Area A, 134 cm below level 7 datum.
Remarks: Except for the well-executed oblique-parallel flaking and the
piano-convex cross section, this point is similar to the Golondrina type from the

92

Texas Archeological Society

Devils Mouth site (Johnson 1964:46-52), but its oblique flaking and deep basal
concavity identify it as a Barber point (Kelly 1983; Turner and Hester 1985 : 70).
The occurrence of these well-made points in Central Texas suggests an affiliation with Paleo-Indian cultures of the High Plains; the Jimmy Allen site readily
comes to mind (Wormington 1957 : 145). Additional work done at Hell Gap places
the Gregg Ranch specimen potentially within the Frederick or Lusk complexes
as defined by Irwin-Williams et al. (1973:50-52). Note also that Irwin’s spatial
representation for the Frederick complex, although not totally defined because of
lack of evidence, extends from southern Montana through the Great Plains and
into Central Texas (Irwin 1971 : Figure 6). The writer also agrees with Irwin’s reservations about assigning a site to a complex on the basis of morphology of specific artifacts rather than considering the entire tool assemblage (Irwin 1971:54).
In the case of the Gregg Ranch site (Area A), an additional item that favors the
Frederick complex is a bone awl at the same stratigraphic level as the Barber
point. An oval of large rocks--possibly the remains of a temporary light-weight
shelter--in the Plainview level in Area B, comparable to a feature found at Hell
Gap (Irwin-Williams et al. 1973:45), also indicates temporal affiliation with the
Frederick complex. Much comparative analysis between Central Texas assemblages is needed before we can establish relations among Paleo-Indian occupations. A possible Hell Gap point was also found in Area B at the Gregg Ranch
site (see below). Because the Gregg Ranch Barber specimen was stratigraphically below early barbed points, but contemporaneous with Gower points (San
Geronimo), possibly there is an overlap of Archaic and Paleo-Indian traditions in
Central Texas. This has long been suspected by Prewitt (n.d.), Weir (1976a),
Agogino (n. d.), Johnson ( 1964: 92), and Sorrow (1968 : 48). Willey (1966: 62 64) cites several instances of mixed contexts found in eastern North America,
the Great Plains, and Texas, including the Jake Martin site (Davis and Davis
1960: 22).
Additional evidence for this hypothesis was found at Gregg Ranch, Areas B
and C, where Early Triangular, Plainview, and (possible) Hell Gap points were
found in the same levels and where Gower and early barbed points have been
reported by relic hunters below Plainview and Angostura in Area C. There is, of
course, the possibility of mixing between the late Paleo-Indian occupation and
the succeeding San Geronimo phase (Archaic) during the Altithermal climatic
period (7,000 years BP approximate starting date). Mixing might be the result of
very little deposition during a dry period or of heavy erosion during wet periods
(Hester 1982).
Tree-root growth, animal burrowing, soil cracking, and the treading of men
and animals also may account for the mixing of artifacts. Special attention was
given to this problem during the excavation at the Gregg Ranch site, where animal burrowing was noted; some specimens obviously were out of place. Also
found in the same level as the Barber specimen were several large prismatic
blades and many thinning flakes that were very similar in color, texture, and
composition, implying a good context. Fortunately, artifacts assigned to the San

Geronimo phase were plentiful, particularly in levels 6 and 7 (Figure 8). In addition to the Plainview preform and the Barber specimen, the San Geronimo materials aided in determining the Paleo-Indian level, which is thought to lie on a hard
terrace surface (Figures 7, 8). An additional argument for the contemporaneity
of Paleo-Indian and Archaic traditions is the occurrence of Archaic cornernotched points in eastern North America 8,000 to 11,000 years ago (Coe 1964 :
12; Broyles 1971:49; Peck and Painter 1984:23); similar Archaic points could
have been in Central Texas at the same time. The relations between climate,
flora, fauna, and man suggest that even the Paleo-Indian peoples as big game
hunters occasionally may have exp!oited geographical areas other than the High
Plains and eventually may have been drawn to a different way of life--the Archaic. The flaking pattern on this specimen differs from most Paleo-Indian points
of this type, suggesting that it may have been manufactured by a left-handed individual, judging from the writer’s experiments with preform holding and flake
removal.

Unclassified
5 Specimens (Figure 12, a-e)
Description: Triangular to leaf shaped with straight or convex edges; prominent shoulders with rounded or barbed corners; strongly expanding stems; base
has slight concavity and is sometimes similar to Martindale. Some specimens
have stem and basal smoothing.
Provenience: Squares N08-E01, N1 l-E01, N12-E01, and N15-E01, Area
A, level 5.
Remarks: Except for 9, a, these specimens apparently are variants of Travis
or Nolan types. Specimen 12, c is well made, has serrated edges, and may be a
Travis point. Specimens 12, a and b have slight to moderate smoothing along the
base and stem edges. Figure 12, b has a base similar to those of the early barbed
points shown in Figure 9 or to the Martindales. These specimens compare favorably with ones assigned to the San Geronimo phase of the Central Archaic as
defined by Weir (1976a: 52, Figure 9, D and E).
Nolan
10 Specimens (Figure 12, f-k)
Description: Triangular to leaf shaped; stems (except for Figure 12,g) alternately beveled and rectangular to slightly expanding in cross section; stem edges
on most specimens lightly smoothed. Workmanship varies from fair to good; percussion is the predominant flaking technique. Preferred material is an opaque
flint. Some specimens show evidence of heat treatment.
Dimensions: Length 50-9~=mm; width across shoulders 20-32 mm; length
of stem 12-27 mm; width of base 12-20 mm; thickness 5-9 mm.
Provenience: Squares N09, N09, Nll, N13, N14, and N15, levels 3, 4, and
5; most specimens were near the bottom of the primary burned rock midden, on
level 5.
Remarks: Both edges of the stem of one specimen (Figure 12, g) were beveled on the same face. Called Zorra by some, the writer believes this to be only a
variant of Nolan. Two Pandale points were recovered very near several Nolan
points in Square N15-E01 (Figure 7). These are thought to be Nolan, although
they have expanding bases and well-pronounced bevels on the stems. Some
Nolan points also closely resemble Travis. These similarities suggest cultural affiliations among the three types.
At Gregg Ranch there was evidence that the people who produced the Nolan
type specimens (Clear Fork phase), though not the earliest, were the first to use
burned rock middens intensively. Whether the vast accumulations of burned rock
at this site represent many hearths, a system of ovens, or some other cultural
feature is not known. Nolan specimens from Gregg Ranch conform to the type
described by Suhm and Jelks (1962:225). Weir considers Nolan diagnostic of the
Clear Fork phase of the Texas Archaic (1976a: 29, Table 1).

Pandale
2 Specimens (Figure 13, a, b)
Description: Leaf shaped; convex edges beveled to such an extent that the
specimens are slighly twisted; slightly beveled shoulders narrow into recurved
base. Stone is opaque tan flint and chocolate-brown chert. Workmanship good;
percussion used for finishing.
Dimensions: Length 65-70 mm; width across shoulders 24-26 mm; maximum width of base 17-19 mm; thickness 8 mm.
Provenience: Square N14-E01, level 4, Area A.
Remarks: These specimens resemble Nolan closely and are affiliated with
Nolan materials near the lower part of the primary burned rock midden. They
conform to the type described by Suhm and Jelks (1962:231). Weir considers
this type diagnostic of the Clear Fork phase of the Texas Archaic (1976a: 29,
Table 1).

Bulverde
6 Specimens (Figure 13, c-h)
Description: Large and small triangular specimens; characteristic rectangular or slightly contracting stems and straight to slightly concave bases thinned to
wedge shape (Suhm and Jelks 1962: 169). Specimens e, g and h appear to have
been reworked.
Dimensions: Length 35-90 mm; width across shoulders 20-40 mm; length
of stem 8-20 mm; basal width 15-22 mm; thickness 7-11 mm.
Provenience: Squares N10, ! 1, 12, 13, and 15-E01, Area A; three specimens assigned to level 4 and one each to levels 2, 3, and 5.
Remarks: The specimens were found in the lower levels of the primary
burned rock midden and probably represent stages of the Round Rock and Clear
Fork phases of the Texas Archaic. Weir considers the Bulyerde type diagnostic of
the Clear Fork phase (1976a: 53, Figure 10A, B).

Castroville
1 Specimen (Figure 13, i)
Description: Triangular with slightly convex edges; corner notched with
straight base and wide stem. Specimen apparently was unfinished due to a hinge
fracture that terminated at the completed corner notch and created a thicker cross
section near one corner. Stone is a light tan, opaque flint. Workmanship very
good; percussion flaking primary means of final thinning.
Dimensions: Length 78 ram; width across shoulders 31 ram; length of stem
9 mm; extrapolated basal width 18 ram; thickness 8 mm.
Provenience: Square N13-E01, level 3, Area A.
Remarks: Similar to Lange; conforms to the type described by Suhm and
Jelks (1962:173). Weir considers this type diagnostic of the San Marcos phase of
the Texas Archaic (1976a:29, Table 1).

Lerma
1 Specimen (Figure 13, j)
Description: Leaf-shaped biface with impaot fracture on distal end. Stone is
brown flint. Workmanship good; both percussion and pressure employed for final
thinning and shaping; no basa! or edge smoothing evident.
Dimensions: Extrapolated length 70 mm; width 22 ram; thickness 7 ram.
Remarks: Conforms to the type described by Suhm and Jelks (1962: 207). It
came from the level just above Nolan and Bulverde (Figure 8). Lerma points
are thought to occur early in the Archaic and may be associated with the San
Geronimo phase.

Wells
1 Specimen (Figure 14, a)
Description: Triangular blade with convex edges, narrow shoulders, and
long, rectangular stem that terminates in straight base that has cortex from the
original core nodule; stem is slightly ground along one edge. Stone is opaque,
mottled brown flint. Workmanship good; edge retouch by both percussion and
pressure.
Dimensions: Length 51 mm; width across shoulders 23 ram; length of stem
21 mm; basal width 16 ram; thickness 7 mm.
Provenience: Square N13-E0I, level 4, Area A.
Remarks: Except for the flat cortex base with remnant cortex, this specimen
conforms to the type description by Suhm and Jelks (1962:257). Weir considers
this type diagnostic of the Clear Fork phase of the Texas Archaic (1976a: 53,
Figure 10, G).

Pedernales
11 Specimens (Figure 14, b-k)
Description: Generally triangular with straight sides; shoulders prominent
and stems generally rectangular with the typical indented base. Stone ranges
from translucent tan chert to opaque, brown flint. One specimen has evidence of
heat treating (Figure 14, g). Percussion was primary means of flake detachment,
with pressure flaking for final shaping, edge straightening, and retouch. Resharpening also evident on some specimens. (Fine pressure flaking produced a
sharp serrated edge on a single point found by a relic hunter in Area C.) Specimens found at the Gregg Ranch site conform closely to those described by Suhm
and Jelks (1962 : 235- 238). Workmanship generally good.
Dimensions: Length 50-95 mm; width across shoulders 23-38 mm; length
of stem 17-24 mm; basal width 17-22 mm; thickness 5-9 mm.
Provenience: Squares N09-E01, N10-E01, Nll-E01, N12-E01, N13-E01,
and N14-E01; levels 2, 3, 4, and 5; most specimens recovered from levels 3
and 4.
Remarks: Several of the Pedernales specimens found at the Gregg Ranch
site represent different phases of the manufacturing process. Figure 14, f is a
biface (preform) that has only the base finished, obviously the first step in shaping this particular specimen. Figure 14, g represents the next stage of manufacture: final shaping, done by pressure flaking along the edges. The specimen illustrated in Figure 14, j, first thought to be a Gower point, is probably a Pedernales
preform, primarily because of its provenience within the primary burned rock
midden. Figure 14, c, j, and k may be reworked points. Figure 14, h was found
out of context in a rodent burrow. Figure 14, b has an impact fracture on the
distal end. Weir (1976a: 29, Table 1) considers the Pedernales type diagnostic of
the Round Rock phase of the Texas Archaic.

Marcos
1 Specimen (Figure 14, 1)
Description: Long and triangular, slightly convex edges; deeply barbed
on corners, with convex base, resulting in a strongly expanding stem. Stone is
opaque tan flint. Workmanship good; percussion was the primary means of thinning; minor pressure retouch was employed along the edges, resulting in some
serration. Has a broken distal end.
Dimensions: Extrapolated length 55 mm; width across shoulders 24 mm;
length of stem 10 mm; basal width 20 mm; thickness 5 mm.
Provenience: Square N14-E01; level 3, Area A.
Remarks: Conforms to the type described by Suhm and Jelks (1962: 209).
Weir includes Marcos in the San Marcos phase of the Texas Archaic (1976a: 29,
Table 1).

Texas Archeological Society

Marshall
1 Specimen (Figure 14, m)
Description: Triangular with straight edges; shoulders strongly barbed,
stem rectangular, base straight. Stone is translucent brown chert. Workmanship
good, with percussion the primary means of final thinning. Has an impact fracture on one side at the distal end; one ear and one edge broken.
Dimensions: Extrapolated length 66 mm; extrapolated width across shoulders 35 mm; length of stem 10 mm; basal width 19 mm; thickness 4 mm.
Provenience: Square N10-E01, level 2, Area A.
Remarks: Conforms to type described by Suhm and Jelks (1962:211). Weir
considers this type diagnostic of the San Marcos phase of the Texas Archaic
(1976a:55, Figure 12).

Gower
1 Specimen (Figure 14, n)
Description: Triangular with straight edges and thick body; stem straight
and deeply notched; lateral edges lightly smoothed; basal thinning by removal of
crescent-shaped flakes. Stone is tan flint. Workmanship fair; primary manufacturing technique is percussion. One ear of stem is missing.
Dimensions: Length 60 mm; width across shoulders 37 mm; length of stem
17 mm; width of stem 22 mm; thickness 8 mm.
Provenience: Square N15-E01, Area A; 147 cm below level 7 datum.
Remarks: Specimen was slightly deeper than the Plainview-Golondrina
specimens and may be out of context due to rodent activity in the midden. It is
similar in outline to a Pedernales type found much higher in Area A at 47 cm
(Figure 14, k) and to a Gower found at Youngsport (Shafer 1963: Figure 7-B) as
well as several of those found at Granite Beach (Crawford 1965: Figure 3). Its
context in the Gregg Ranch site, however, falls within or near the San Geronimo
phase of the Archaic as defined by Weir (1976a: 52, Figure 9, H, I).

Other Lithic Artifacts
Corner Tanged Knife
1 Specimen (Figure 15, a)
Description: Triangular biface with tang on one corner for hafting. Stone is
light tan chert. Workmanship very good; primary means of final thinning was
percussion; sharpened by pressure retouch.
Dimensions: Length 90 mm; width 38 mm; width of tang 20 mm; depth of
notches 10 mm; thickness 7 mm.
Provenience: Level 4, Area C (Figure 5), 1 meter east of N12-E01 and 70
cm below the surface.

mens and may be out of context due to rodent activity in the midden. It is similar
in outline to a Pedernales type found much higher in Area A at 47 cm (Figure 14,

Miscellaneous Artifacts

Several ovate specimens and side scrapers were found in the San Geronimo
occupation level of the Gregg Ranch site (Figure 15, b-e, i). Some appear to have
been heat treated; some appear to have sustained use breakage. A possible preform (Figure 15, e) from the San Geronimo level was heat treated; it is a glossy
pink. A probable ovate scraper (Figure 15, f), also was heat treated. A probable
side scraper (Figure 15, b) came from N08-E01, level 6. Figure 15, d appears
to be a uniface scraper, and Figure 15, b and c appear to be side scrapers. Figure 15, g and h appear to be broken scrapers that were heat treated.
Other lithic tools from the Gregg Ranch site include a probable Perdiz arrowpoint (Figure 16, b) and a preform (Figure 16, c) found in the upper 10 cm (level
1) of Square N13-E01). Although it was found just above a heavy layer of snail
shells and hardpan soil (Figures 7, 8) deep in Square N15-E01, 147 cm below
level 7 datum, Figure 14, f appears to be a Pedernales point, but based on its
archeological context it is probably a Gower. A possible Pedernales point (Figure 16, a), broken, was found in Square Nll-E01, and the broken and burned
base of a Nolan point (Figure 16, d) came from Square N08-E01, level 5. An
artifact from N09-E01, level 7, probably the bit end of a Guadalupe Gouge (Figure 17, h), appears to have been in context with Paleo-Indian materials. A preform (Figure 17, i) came from Square N08-E01, level 4, and a broken hammerstone (Figure 17, e) from Square N09-E01, level a. The hammerstone is of red
quartzite and has use-wear along the edge. Utilized flakes (Figure 17, a-g) were
recovered from various levels. One (Figure 17, e) has fine retouch on all edges in
addition to use-wear. The blade is straight and has a strong lip at the platform,
indicating soft-hammer removal while on an anvil. A possible scraper (Figure
17, f) also has fine retouch flaking along all edges. Two of the utilized flakes
(Figure 17, a and b) were found near the Barber point (Figure 11). A possible
gouge (Figure 17, a) may have come from the same flint nodule as the Barber
point. Another flake (Figure 17, b) may have served as a graver. Several prismatic blades (Figure 18) were recovered from probable Paleo-Indian levels. Two
prismatic blades (Figures 15, h and 17, a), one (Figure 15, h) apparently a preform that has had some flakes removed at the start of the thinning process, were
also very close to the Barber point (Figure 11), and they to appear to have come
from the same flint nodule.
Among the representative bifaces from the Gregg Ranch site (Figure 19) is
one (Figure 19, e) from the San Geronimo level that appears from its pink color
and glassy sheen to have been heat treated; and has an oblique transverse parallel
flake-scar pattern that may be Paleo-Indian workmanship. Of particular interest
too are pink bifaces with glassy sheen (Figure 15, b-h) from the San Geronimo
level that apparently were heat treated. Figure 15, d is a prismatic blade from the
San Geronimo level.
Several drills (Figure 20, a-d) came from the middle Archaic, a bone awl
(Figure 20, e) came from the Clear Fork phase of the Central Texas Archaic, and
a probable bone awl (Figure 20, f) came from the Paleo-Indian level. Three ap-

parent uniface knives (Figure 20, g-i) came from the San Geronimo level, all
with secondary retouch flaking along the cutting edges on one face only and each
with a wide safety ridge along the top side. All three have apparent use-wear.
Four choppers or cores (Figure 21) were recovered, one (21, a) from well below
the Barber point, which was just above the Paleo-Indian level (N1 l-E01, level 8).

AREA B

Description
Area B (Figures 5, 22) was excavated by Paul Duke, of Austin, at the same
time that Area A was being excavated. Metric measurements originated from the
site datum (N01-E01). Area B excavations commenced 17 meters east of the site
datum and were within a 12-square-meter grid. Squares were excavated individually by 10 cm levels and screened through half-inch hardware cloth.
Surface
On the surface of Area B were two hearths (Figure 23).
Occupation zones began on the surface and continued to a depth of 130 cm.
A possible shelter feature, a classic Plainview point, and an Early Triangular
point--all in close proximity--and a possible Hell Gap point and a Clear Fork
gouge were recovered. Except for these, the artifacts, soil color, bone, shell, and
burned rock midden features in Area B were typical of those found in most
burned rock middens of Central Texas and are not discussed here.
Excavation
While excavating squares N01-E19, N02-E19, N03-E19, N02-E20, and
N03-E20 Duke encountered seven large fragmented limestone rocks arranged in
a circle 2 meters in diameter (Figure 22). These rocks lay on soil that was relatively free of other rock and sloped slightly to the south toward the flood plain.
Due south of and near this feature were the remains of a stone-lined hearth. The
arrangement of the large rocks in the 2-meter circle suggests that they were
the remains of a simple windbreak or shelter. A similar feature was noted in the
lower levels of locality 1 at the Hell Gap site in Wyoming (Irwin-Williams et al.
1973:45). However, significant artifacts are two projectile points that may have
been directly associated with the rock feature. A classic Plainview point (Figure
24, a) was found next to one of the large rocks in Square N03-E20 and an Early
Triangular point (Figure 24, h) was found on the opposite side of the same rock
(Figure 22, a). All three items appeared to be at the same level and in good context. The Plainview point, of excellent workmanship, is made from a light tan
Central Texas chert. It has an indented base, basal thinning, and has been ground
on the base and lower edges. The distal end has been damaged. The Early Triangular point is similar to other triangular points found at comparable levels in
Area B. Hester considers the Early Triangular point to be pre-Early Archaic in
age at the La Jita site (Hester 1971 : 119). Evidence from Gregg Ranch may push

the chronological position of the Early Triangular point further back in time,
possibly to 10,000 years BE The point (Figure 24, h) is made from a local blue
gray chert, of excellent workmanship, with basal thinning and some grinding
along the base, but not on the edges.
Among the other artifacts found in Area B is a possible resharpened Hell
Gap point (Figure 24, e). It is similar to points found at several Hell Gap sites in
Wyoming (Frison 1974:71-90, 1978:168-177) and was made from a light tan
Central Texas chert. It has moderate grinding along the base and lower lateral

gouges (not illustrated) were also found in the lower levels of Area B, but although they are believed to be as old as Plainview, their exact age has not been
determined. Several early corner notched points (Figure 24, b, f) of the San
Geronimo period were also recovered together with a Travis (Figure 24, d) and a
possible Meserve point (Figure 24, c).

CONCLUSIONS
The prevalence of hunting and hide-working tools (dart points, knives,
scrapers, and awls) over grinding tools suggests that hunting was the primary
means of subsistence, with a secondary reliance on gathering. Lithic artifacts
and debitage are the most abundant materials found at the Gregg Ranch site; they
are the basic sources available for the analysis of stone-working techniques.

110

The close association of a Plainview point with an Early Triangular point
and a primitive-style, stone-lined, windbreak type of shelter suggests an overlap
in time of two different cultures: the highly mobile Great Plains big-game hunting tradition of the Paleo-Indians and the riverine hunter-gatherer tradition of the
Archaic. These early peoples most likely exploited the environment using all
manner of hunting and gathering techniques, available resources, and ideas
gained from contact with other groups--groups both nomadic and fairly stable in
their settlement patterns. At the Gregg Ranch site the variety of game and lithic
resources, varied topography, good weather, good water, and easy access must
have come together as it does today to make an ideal place for man to live.
