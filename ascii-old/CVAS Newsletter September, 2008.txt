Video Made for Television
Of The Painted Rocks Is
September Presentation
This past summer a team from Hot
Shots Video Productions visited Fred and
Kay Campbell’s ranch at Paint Rock to
film a video for the RDH television channel. The 25 minute video was made for
Ag Lifestyles program, which features
Farmer Jones.

Bill Yeates

The video is an excellent arm chair
presentation of the rock art on the Campbell's ranch. Fred and Kay explain the history of the ranch and the background of
the paintings. Kay shows us how the Indians made the paint. There is even a cameo
of Bill Yeates with his photos taken during the summer and winter equinoxes.

Friends and colleagues: As online quality
continues to improve, audiences increasingly are turning to the Internet as
their preferred source for video entertainment. Participating in that trend, ALI
now is offering a short-term trial of a new
system for viewing videos on our nonprofit streaming-media Web site, The Archaeology Channel (http://
www.archaeologychannel.org), at resolutions up to and including true High Definition.
We are staying on the cutting edge
of technology to give you the best video
quality possible through streaming. Partnering with VIRCAS, we invite
you to view five video titles using the
new VIRCAS player (so far for Windows
users only–the Mac version is coming
soon). Depending on your bandwidth
and the titles you select, you will be able
to watch these films at resolutions ranging from DVD to true HD. This is a test
to measure traffic and gain experience
with this new mode of video delivery.
The titles available through this
new service are:
Bilad Chinqit: The Land of Chinguetti
(Mauritania, 59 min) (DVD quality)
A Forgotten Place: The History of an
Abandoned Farming Community (North
Carolina, 52 min.) (DVD quality)
The Greatest Good (United States, 124
min.) (High Definition)
In Vivid Color: Voices from Shiloh’s
Mound (Tennessee, 22 min.) (DVD quality)
Signs Out of Time: The Story of Archaeologist
Marija
Gimbutas
(Worldwide, 59 min.) (DVD quality)

An Invitation to the 2008 TAS
Annual Meeting
The Texas Archeological Society’s 79th
Annual Meeting will be held in Lubbock,
Texas, October 24–26, 2008. All TAS
members are invited to attend the
meetings, and, for the second year,
non-TAS members can attend the sessions and/or the banquet at a slightly
higher fee than members. In a sense,
having the meetings in Lubbock is a
sort of homecoming for the TAS; many
of the pioneers in Texas archeology
and early members of the TAS worked
in the Panhandle. The theme of
“pioneers of Texas archeology and Panhandle archeology” will be carried into
the public forum, banquet, session,
and excursions. We’ve got a fun and
busy weekend planned, so start making

WHEN THE FAIR CLOSES, PLEASE
STAY AND HELP BREAK DOWN ALL
EXHIBITS. Thanks to all of you who have
volunteered your time and efforts and I look

your plans to attend early.
The conference hotel is the Holiday
Inn Park Plaza, conveniently located on
Loop 289 on the south side of
town. Some of you will remember this as
the site of the 1994 TAS and Plains conference. Just this year, the hotel completed an extensive renovation, so you
may not recognize the place. We recommend that you contact the hotel early to
reserve a room (single or double) at the
conference rate of $89.00, plus tax. There
is a small block of student rooms at the
same rate for up to four people per room.
Registration fee is $50 for members, and $70 for non members. Studentfees are $25 and $35. These fees will increase $10 after October 3. For more information the about the Annual Meeting
and a registration form, contact the Texas
Archeological Society.

Rattlesnake Shelter Pictograph Tour

Drawing by Forrest Kirkland from The Rock Art of Texas Indians

Meet Texas Tech representative at the Seminole Canyon Center parking lot at 8 AM
Sign Up
for a morning tour, or 1 PM for an afternoon tour. Sign 2 liability release
forms and make $25 donation ($5 for students) (cash or check payable to Texas Tech University).
Participants are responsible for their own transportation. Carpooling is encouraged
Travel
to reduce the number of vehicles involved as much as possible.
Tours will depart at 8:30 AM and 1:30 PM from the
Seminole Canyon Center parking lot. There will be 2 tours each day
on Friday and Saturday, and 1 morning tour only on Sunday.
If you are not with the guided group, you will not be able to get in.
Drive to Langtry on Hwy. 90 (ca. 20 miles). From Langtry, there is a short drive west on Hwy.
90. We will then enter a private ranch through a locked gate and travel about 3.5 miles on a
rough gravel road. Ranch road is slow and dusty, but 4-wheel is not required. However, your
vehicle needs to have high clearance. The group should be back at Seminole Canyon in about
3 hours.
Difficulty The hike to Rattlesnake Shelter is moderately strenuous. The round-trip walking distance is about 1 mile involving going into and coming out of the canyon on unimproved
trails. We will be in a remote location where response to serious injuries and medical emergencies will be difficult.
Clothing Sturdy hiking boots, long pants, and a hat are recommended.
Restrooms The closest public restrooms are at the Judge Roy Bean Center in Langtry.
A quart or two of drinking water, camera, walking stick, bug repellent, etc.
