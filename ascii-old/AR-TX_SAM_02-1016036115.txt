Abstract
Surveying And Mapping, LLC (SAM) conducted a marine archaeological survey of the proposed West
Ranch to Point Comfort Pipeline Project located in the upper portion of Lavaca Bay, north of the Lavaca
Bay Causeway, in Calhoun County, Texas. The survey corridor is located in Texas state waters and spans
portions of State Mineral Lease Tracts 4A, 5A, 6A, 11A, 12A, 14A, 15A, 22A and 23A. A route for the
proposed pipeline will be selected through the corridor based on locations of environmental constraints,
including oyster reefs and potential shipwrecks. This survey was funded by Harvest Pipeline Company
through a subcontract with Blanton & Associates, Inc. of Lakeway, Texas. SAMâs field investigations
consisted of a marine geophysical survey performed under Texas Antiquities Permit 7431 from October
9 to 18, 2015 and January 27 to February 6, 2016. An archaeological assessment was conducted of all
data acquired from the survey. The area of potential effect (APE) measures 4.4 miles long; 2,000 feet
wide at the north end; 5,000 feet wide at the south end; and encompasses 1,628 acres. Water depths
range from 0 to 6 feet below Mean Lower Low Water. Trenching for pipe laying will be limited to within
5 feet of the existing seafloor. The purpose of SAMâs survey was to locate potential archaeological sites
so they can be avoided by bottom disturbing activities associated with pipeline construction. A desktop
review of the cultural background determined that 4 marine archaeological investigations have been
reported within 3 miles of the APE. No marine archaeological sites have been confirmed within 3 miles
of the APE. At least 19 shipwrecks have been reported from historic and/or cartographic sources to
potentially lie within 3 miles, including as many as 5 within the APE. This study was completed in
compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (Public Law 89-665; 16 U.S.C. 470)
and the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resource Code, Title 9, Chapter 191). The minimum
reporting and survey requirements for marine archaeological studies conducted under a Texas
Antiquities Permit are mandated by The Texas Administrative Code, Title 13, Part 2, Chapters 26 and 28,
respectively. SAM recommends avoidance of 22 magnetic anomalies (Mag 1 to Mag 22) and a charted
area of periodically exposed wreckage. All 22 anomalies and the charted wreckage are potentially
associated with historic shipwrecks thus could meet criteria for State Antiquities Landmark status or for
the National Register of Historic Places and are recommended for avoidance by bottom-disturbing
activities associated with this project.

Introduction

Surveying and Mapping, LLC (SAM) conducted a marine archaeological survey of the proposed West
Ranch to Point Comfort Pipeline Project located in the upper portion of Lavaca Bay, north of the Lavaca
Bay Causeway, in Calhoun County, Texas (Figure 1). This survey was funded by Harvest Pipeline
Company through a subcontract with Blanton & Associates, Inc. of Lakeway, Texas. The area of potential
effect (APE) measures 4.4 miles long; 2,000 feet (ft) wide at the north end; 5,000 ft wide at the south
end; and encompasses 1,628 acres. The APE is located in Texas state waters and spans portions of State
Mineral Lease Tracts 4A, 5A, 6A, 11A, 12A, 14A, 15A, 22A and 23A. Water depths range from 0 to 6 ft
below Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW). Cultural resources investigations were required by the Texas
Historical Commission (THC) because pipe laying activities might affect historic cultural resources resting
on or embedded in the seafloor. Trenching for pipe laying will be limited to within 5 ft of the existing
seafloor.
Fieldwork was conducted from October 9 to 18, 2015 and from January 27 to February 6, 2016. The
purpose of SAMâs survey was to locate potential archaeological sites so they can be avoided by bottom
disturbing activities associated with pipeline construction. An archaeological assessment was conducted
of all data acquired from the APE. Construction access will follow an existing dredged channel;
therefore, no archaeological assessment was required along the access route. No artifacts were
collected during this survey.
Archaeological sites, should they be present, might be eligible for nomination to the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) or as State Antiquities Landmarks. Archaeological sites in this context typically
would be shipwrecks or abandoned watercraft. The potential for shipwrecks in a given area is expected
to correlate with the amount of ship traffic utilizing the area. Upper Lavaca Bay was navigated by
historic watercraft as early as 1685 when LaSalle established a short-lived colony on nearby Garcitas
Creek. Earlier explorers visited Matagorda Bay by 1542 but may not have ventured as far inland as the
APE.
A desktop review of the cultural background determined that 4 marine archaeological investigations
have been reported within 3 miles of the APE. No marine archaeological sites have been confirmed
within 3 miles of the APE. At least 19 shipwrecks have been reported from historic and/or cartographic
sources to potentially lie within 3 miles, including as many as 5 within the APE.
Analysis of the survey data revealed 22 magnetic anomalies (Mag 1 to Mag 22) consistent with those
produced by complex anomaly sources such as shipwrecks. No wrecks were confirmed by sonar
imagery; however, an area of charted wreckage, which was too shallow to survey, was visually
confirmed in the southeastern corner of the APE. SAM recommends avoidance of all 22 targets, as well
as the visually-confirmed area of wreckage, by bottom-disturbing activities associated with this project.
All 22 anomalies and the visible wreckage are potentially associated with historic shipwrecks thus could
meet criteria for State Antiquities Landmark status or for the NRHP.

The results reported in this document will support Harvest Pipelineâs application for a United States
Army Corps of Engineers Permit, requesting permission to trench sediment within the APE. This study
was completed in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (Public Law 89665; 16 U.S.C. 470), which requires that federally funded or permitted projects give due consideration to
cultural resources, and with the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resource Code, Title 9, Chapter
191), which provides for the protection of cultural resources on state lands. The APE is publicly owned
2|Page

and administered by the Texas GLO; therefore, a Texas Antiquities Permit was required prior to
beginning fieldwork. Work was completed under Texas Antiquities Permit 7431. The minimum reporting
and survey requirements for marine archaeological studies conducted under a Texas Antiquities Permit
are mandated by The Texas Administrative Code, Title 13, Part 2, Chapters 26 and 28, respectively.
The report is organized into five sections that provide the necessary context for interpreting the results
of the survey. Section II summarizes the physical environment of the APE based on a combination of
published literature and data collected by this survey. Section III describes the archaeological
background of the area within a 3-mile radius of the APE, including relevant and maritime history of the
area, previous archaeological investigations nearby, and the potential for occurrence and preservation
of prehistoric and historic sites in the APE. Section IV describes the survey design and the methods used
for acquisition, processing and analysis of geophysical data. Section V presents the geophysical survey
results and archaeological assessment. Finally, a list of all bibliographic references cited in the text is
provided as Section VI. Appendix A (not for public disclosure) contains maps of the survey results.
Appendix B (not for public disclosure) contains geophysical target descriptions and locations including a
table of magnetic anomaly locations recommended for avoidance due to their potential archaeological
nature. Appendix C contains a copy of Texas Antiquities Permit 7431 and the THC concurrence letter (in
the final draft only).

Physical Environment

The APE is located in the upper portion of Lavaca Bay. The near seafloor geology of this area was
influenced by sea level changes occurring during and since the Late Wisconsin Glaciation. At that time
significant amounts of water were locked up in continental glaciers. Sea level has risen more than 300 ft
since the last glacial low stand, about 20,000 to 22,000 years ago. Many sea level curves have been
published showing minor variations in the timing and degree of change (e.g. Figure 2). Nevertheless
there is broad consensus in the magnitude and approximate timing of this event. The former
Pleistocene/Holocene landscape, now submerged on the continental shelf, is of particular interest to
archaeologists, because the timing of its most recent exposure overlaps the period of human habitation
in North America.
The Pleistocene-age Lavaca River crosses beneath the southern end of the APE at a depth of about 27
meters (89 ft) below sea level (Patch 2004:47; Bryne 1975). Patch (2004: 29-30) interpreted two
Pleistocene horizons (designated B and C) at depths typically greater than 25 meters (82 ft) beneath the
surface of the APE based on intermittent sub-bottom acoustic reflections. A pervasive and fairly level
Holocene horizon, designated by Patch as Reflector A, was interpreted at depths ranging from 16 to 20
meters (52-66 ft) below sea level underlying northern portions of the APE. Reflector A approximately
correlates with the top of Holocene sands and gravels interpreted by Bryne (1975). Sediments above
Reflector A are interpreted by Patch as recent mud and would have been deposited in a subaqueous
environment.

Figure 2: Holocene Sea Level Curves by Various Authors
Reproduced from Weise, et al. (1980, Figure 16)
As sea level rose during the Holocene, the Lavaca River and Garcitas Creek valleys became a single tidal
estuary. The presence of fresh surface water and the ecological diversity of an estuary would have been
particular attractions to both prehistoric human and animal populations. By about 9,500 years before
present (BP), the APE was inundated by the sea. During the process, the upper Pleistocene-age
sediments in the APE would have been reworked by wave action and covered by fluvial sediments
originating in the Lavaca River and Garcitas Creek basins.
Sub-bottom profiles from the present survey indicate that at least the upper 60 ft of sediment in the APE
(the maximum depth of SAMâs sub-bottom data) was deposited under subaqueous conditions. No
horizons were observed in the data from SAMâs survey that could be interpreted as an unconformity
between the Pleistocene land surface and Holocene-age fluvial/marine sediments. The Pleistocene
subaerial surface beneath the APE is minimally 75 ft below MLLW and slightly deeper within the
inundated Lavaca River. Holocene sea level curves for the Gulf of Mexico (Figure 2) suggest that the
former land surface in the APE was inundated most recently by about 9,500 years BP. Prior to that
event, the area might have been continually exposed to subaerial conditions for the full extent of human
habitation in the New World; however, the Pleistocene-age surface and ancestral Lavaca River delta are
located well below the depth of proposed seafloor disturbance for this project.

The seafloor in the present-day APE consists mostly of estuarine mud. An area of fluvial sand, deposited
by the Lavaca River, extends across the central portion of the APE (Bronikowski 2004: 28). Extensive
areas of active oyster reefs and shell hash occur near the southern end of the APE. Water depth in the
modern APE ranges from 1 to 6 ft MLLW (Figure 3). This is not substantially different than depths
charted during the late 19th century (Figure 4).

Archaeological Background

Prehistory
Evidence from many archaeological sites in North and South America suggest that the New World was
colonized by humans as early as 15,000 BP, predating the Clovis Culture by at least 2,000 years. The
Paleo-Indian Period, sometimes referred to as the Big Game Hunting Tradition, continued until about
10,000 BP. Waters and Stafford (2014) suggest that the earliest projectile points diagnostic of the PaleoIndian Period, the Clovis complex of fluted-blade technology, likely evolved in the New World long after
migrants had already spread throughout both North and South America. The idea of a pre-Clovis
migration from central Asia, possibly as early as 16,000 BP, is supported by genetic evidence and
correlates with an apparent decline in megafauna populations beginning shortly after that time.
Stright (1990) summarized inundated sites discovered along the Gulf of Mexico coast at depths up to 59
ft below Mean Sea Level. For example, artifacts from all Paleo-Indian traditions with the exception of
Folsom have been found along a 22-mile stretch of McFaddin Beach near Sabine Pass, Texas (Long 1977;
cited in Stright 1990). The collection includes 14 Clovis Points. Faunal material recovered there includes
a wide variety of Pleistocene species, such as mammoth, mastodon, saber-toothed cat, bear, giant
armadillo, bison, tapir and horse. An elephant tusk from the site yielded a radiocarbon date of 11,100
+/- 750 BP. The former Pleistocene land surface at McFaddin Beach, known regionally as the Beaumont
Clay Formation, is about 5 ft below sea level.

6|Page

Many known inundated sites have been discovered as a result of dredging. For example, human remains
and artifacts were recovered from the Texas City Channel in Galveston Bay near the ancestral Trinity
River Valley (Aten and Good 1985). The site contained 4,000 bone specimens from Pleistocene species,
such as horse and tapir, including 42 bones that appeared to have been modified, and a variety of lithics
interpreted as stone tools.
Few attempts have been made to actively seek intact buried site deposits on the continental shelf.
Nevertheless, one such effort by Coastal Environments, Inc. (1986) located two possible prehistoric shell
midden sites in vibracore samples collected near Sabine Pass at depths of 54 and 59 ft below Mean Sea
Level. Pollen analyses demonstrated that both deposits had formed under subaerial conditions;
however, the core sample sizes were too small to allow a definitive determination of cultural origin for
the shell deposits.

Potential for Submerged Prehistoric Sites
There is no question that humans once lived along Gulf of Mexico coastlines long-since submerged by
rising seas. Many such sites are presumed to have been destroyed by wave energy during the process of
inundation. The search for intact sites has focused on landforms that both are recognizable on acoustic
sub-bottom profiles and are known to have attracted prehistoric populations. The most likely locations
for such sites to have been preserved are along streams where burial in alluvial deposits might have
afforded protection from wave energy. As river valleys flooded to become estuaries, deltaic sediments
may have accumulated on top of already sealed deposits, providing further protection by the time those
sites were exposed to high wave energy. Remnants of flooded and buried stream channels that were
above sea level during the period of human habitation in North America are considered the most
probable locations for prehistoric sites to occur on the submerged continental shelf. The presence of
fresh surface water and the ecological diversity of an ancestral delta would have been attractive to
prehistoric human populations while affording the potential for protection of sites from the destructive
force of sea level rise.
The former Pleistocene-age land surface lies at a depth of at least 75 ft below MLLW in Lavaca Bay
(Bronikowki 2004; Byrne 1975). Acoustic sub-bottom profiles were acquired by SAM throughout the
APE. The data are consistent with fluvial deltaic sediments of Holocene age deposited by the Lavaca
River in a marine environment. No layers were observed to indicate the presence of either the
Pleistocene subaerial land surface or the strong Holocene-age Reflector A reported by Patch (2004: 2930) within the limits of reliable data (about 60 ft), a result that is consistent with earlier studies. Sea
level curves for the Gulf of Mexico (Figure 2) indicate that the former Pleistocene dry-land surface
underlying the APE likely was inundated by about 9,500 BP. Depending on which curve one follows, it is
possible that the area was briefly re-exposed between about 7,000 and 9,000 BP. Prior to inundation at
around 9,500 BP the APE might have been exposed for most or all of the period since about 24,000 BP.
The timing of the APE exposure overlaps the entire Paleo-Indian Period and also would encompass any
pre-Clovis human habitation postulated in North America. It is possible that prehistoric sites pre-dating
7,000 years exist beneath the APE; however, if present, such sites would be buried at least 52 ft below
sea level (the minimal depth of Reflector A in Patch 2004: 29-30) and would not be affected by proposed
pipeline construction activities.

Maritime History
European ships first entered the Gulf of Mexico in 1508, sixteen years after Columbusâ first voyage,
when Sebastian de Ocampo sailed around the island of Cuba (Weddle 1985:21). In 1519, the same year
that Hernando Cortez arrived in Vera Cruz on his way to conquering the Aztec empire, another Spaniard,
Alonso Alvarez de Pineda, became the first to explore the Gulf Coast of Texas. Pineda led an expedition,
under orders from the governor of Jamaica, to explore and map lands bordering upon the Gulf of
Mexico in hopes of discovering a passage to India. A map produced by Pineda indicates a number of
inlets on the Texas Coast including one that might correspond to Pass Cavallo; although, there is no solid
evidence that he ventured into Matagorda Bay (Weddle 1985).
Pinedaâs voyage eliminated any idea of a natural route to Asia through the Gulf of Mexico but also
produced detailed knowledge of wind and current patterns that would help determine the best sailing
route between Vera Cruz and Havana (Chipman 1992:24-26). The Spanish silver fleet built upon this
knowledge to conduct steady trade between Vera Cruz and Europe via Havana from the mid-16th century
through 1790. Wind and currents generally dictated one of two routes from Vera Cruz to Havana, either
crossing the central Gulf of Mexico or following a northern route closer to the coast (Lugo-Fernandez et al.
2007). The northern route would have occasionally brought Spanish flotillas near Matagorda Bay during
storms, as witnessed by the wrecks of silver fleet ships near Port Mansfield, Texas and on the Louisiana
Coast.
Cabeza de Vaca was the first European credited with landing on the Texas Coast. De Vaca was one of only
four survivors to reach Mexico City from an ill-fated expedition led by PÃ¡nfilo de NarvÃ¡ez in 1527. Cabeza
de Vaca and about 80 other Spaniards from the expedition landed on or near Galveston Island on rafts.
Those men who managed to survive the first winter were enslaved by Native American tribes including the
Karankawa and Coahuiltecan. Cabeza de Vaca and three other survivors escaped and wandered from tribe
to tribe through Texas, northern Mexico, and down the Pacific Coast of Mexico, eventually reaching
Mexico City after about 8 years. Cabeza de Vaca published a narrative of his experiences among the native
peoples of the new world in 1542 after returning to Spain (e.g., Cabeza de Vaca 2013).
Matagorda Bay was first explored by Europeans in 1542 by Hernando De Sotoâs expedition, led by Luis de
Moscoso Alvarado who had assumed leadership upon De Sotoâs death (Chipman 1992:39-40; Weddle
1991:100). The bay is believed to have been visited again by Guido de Lavazares in 1558 (Chipman
1991:48-49 and Weddle 1991:100-103). Following those early visits by Pineda, Alvarado and Lavazares,
little attention was paid the Matagorda Bay area for about two centuries. The Spanish continued to claim
the region throughout the ensuing period but focused their efforts south of the Rio Grande except when
other European powers infringed upon their territory.
RenÃ© Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle arrived in Matagorda Bay in 1685 with three ships and 300
colonists. La Salle had intended to settle on the Mississippi River; however, he misjudged the riverâs
position and arrived instead on what is now the Texas Coast. There he attempted to establish a
permanent colony, which he christened Fort St. Louis. Unfortunately one of his three ships, LâAimable,
was lost on arrival while trying to enter the bay through Pass Cavallo. Soon thereafter, a group of
colonists returned to France in one of the remaining ships. La Salle then led a series of overland
8|Page

expeditions in an attempt to locate the Mississippi River but was murdered by disgruntled members of
his crew. During their absence from Fort St. Louis the only remaining ship, La Belle, drifted aground and
was lost inside Matagorda Bay. Cut off from Europe, most of the remaining inhabitants of Fort St. Louis,
already greatly diminished in numbers, eventually perished (Weddle 1991).
La Salleâs expedition was unsuccessful; however, his engineer, Minet, returned to France with the first
map of Matagorda Bay. More importantly, the mere presence of the French invigorated Spanish interest
in the region north of the Rio Grande. Several expeditions were mounted to search for the French
settlement, which was eventually discovered, abandoned, on Garcitas Creek above Lavaca Bay by Alonso
de LeÃ³n in 1689. Subsequent expeditions investigated the feasibility of a Spanish settlement, which was
finally accomplished in 1721 when La BahÃ­a del EspÃ­ritu Santo was established at the site of Fort St. Louis
(Weddle 1991), although it was moved four years later to a location on the Guadalupe River.
Texas lacked permanent European settlements until 1746 (Zavaleta 1986:131). Concerned that French
colonists in Louisiana would move into the area, the King of Spain appointed Jose de Escandon in 1746 to
colonize Nuevo Santander (Pierce 1917:17). He successfully established several towns and missions along
the Rio Grande, although none of his settlements were located near the modern Texas coast.
Early settlement was spurred by the conflict over land rights in Texas between the United States, Spain
and New Spain, which was fueled by the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Galveston Island and Point Bolivar
became a base of operations for privateers, backed by French, Mexican and Anglo-American interests
seeking to overturn Spanish control of the region. In 1816, JosÃ© Manuel Herrera declared that Galveston
Island was part of the Mexican Republic and chose Louis Aury as his governor and naval commander
(Chipman 1992:238; Davis 2005:306). Auryâs control of Galveston was usurped by Jean Lafitte in the
spring of 1817 (Davis 2005:324) while Aury was escorting the military expedition of Xavier Mina and
Henry Perry to Mexico. Unable to regain his role as governor in Galveston, Aury departed again in May
to establish a base of operations and a short-lived settlement at Matagorda Bay (Davis 2005:337). He is
rumored to have destroyed his fleet there following the defeat of Mina at Soto de la Marina in June
1817 (Taylor 1957:30â31). There are conflicting reports of the number and location of vessels destroyed
by Aury. A detailed summary by Borgens, et al. (2007: 27) suggests that no more than five vessels might
have been lost despite claims by Antonio Martinez (the Spanish governor of Texas) that Aury had arrived
in Matagorda Bay with a fleet of 13 vessels.
Continuous Anglo-American settlement of the area began in 1822 when Stephen F. Austin founded the
town of Matagorda at the mouth of the Colorado River. Colonists were recruited, largely from New York,
to build the community. In 1824 Austin requested that the newly independent Mexican government
settle Galveston in order to aid in the shipment of cotton to England. The Congress of Mexico
established a port of customs at Galveston in 1825 (Cotham 1998:1; Francaviglia 1998:91, 95). A
customhouse in Matagorda soon followed in 1831 and trade steadily increased (Guthrie 1988).
Increasing trade with the interior of Texas quickly led to other settlements along the shore of Matagorda
Bay, including the communities of Linnville and Port Lavaca on Lavaca Bay. The small port town of
Linnville grew up around John Linnâs Landing at the entrance to upper Lavaca Bay in about 1830. When
9|Page

the Texas War for Independence started in 1835, the Texas Army was supplied partially by goods coming
through Linnville (Guthrie 1988: 130, 148 and 155). When the Lavaca Customs District was founded in
1839, Linnville became its official port of entry. Linnville was destroyed in 1840 by a Comanche raid but
was quickly supplanted by the town of Lavaca, which soon became the busiest port on the bay during
the Texas Republic Period (Maywald 1996:281). Today the town of Linnville is commemorated by a
Texas Centennial Historical Marker. The marker reads: âSite of the Town of Linnville. An early Texas port
named for John Joseph Linn, 1798-1885, pioneer merchant of Victoria who located his warehouse here
in 1831. Around this a settlement grew up which was destroyed by Comanche Indians on August 8,
1840. Erected by the State of Texas, 1936.â
In 1844 German immigrants began landing at Indian Point on the west side of Matagorda Bay. Within
two years the deep-water port of Indianola had been established on the site. During the United Statesâ
war with Mexico a military supply depot was established at Indianola, quickly elevating the portâs
importance to the Texas Coastâs economy. The town grew rapidly to become the second busiest port in
Texas, a position it maintained, except during the Civil War, until it was devastated by two severe
hurricanes in close succession in 1875 and 1886. Business moved to Port Lavaca following the storms,
and Indianola ceased to exist.
The volume of shipping to and from Matagorda Bay declined drastically with the expansion of railroad
service to Port Lavaca in the 1880s. Port Lavaca refocused its maritime industry toward oyster
harvesting (Guthrie 1988:166â170, 187â189; Kleiner 1996:902; Maywald 1996:282) and grew to about
2,000 people by 1908. A channel was dredged to Port Lavaca in 1910 and enlarged in 1939, providing
access to deep-water fishing schooners. The discovery of oil inland from Lavaca Bay let to authorization
in 1945 of the 20-mile Channel to Red Bluff, completed in 1960, across Lavaca Bay and up the Lavaca
and Navidad rivers. Commercial traffic with destinations outside of Matagorda Bay, other than fishing,
did not make a significant rebound until the petroleum and aluminum industries served as impetus for a
deep-draft channel, which was authorized by Congress in 1958. The Matagorda Ship Channel was
completed through Matagorda Peninsula in 1965 and opened to traffic in 1966 (Alperin 1977).

Potential for Historic Shipwrecks
The earliest likely navigation of the APE was in 1689 when Alonso de LeÃ³n led a search for the French
settlement, Fort St. Louis, which he discovered on Garcitas Creek north of Lavaca Bay. In the process of
searching, it seems likely that other streams would have been entered, including perhaps the Lavaca
River, which would have entailed crossing the APE. Subsequent expeditions investigated the feasibility
of a Spanish settlement, which was established in 1721 at the site of Fort St. Louis (Weddle 1991). Those
expeditions also might have crossed the APE; however, there is no record of vessels lost in Lavaca Bay
during this early period of exploration.
SAM researched potential shipwrecks reported within 3 miles of the APE (Table 1). Sources consulted for
this research included the Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas, maintained by the THC, NOAAâs Automated
Wreck and Obstruction Information System (AWOIS) database, a shipwreck database compiled by
PBS&J, and historic maps from the Texas Historical Overlay (Foster et al. 2006).

The Sites Atlas contains shipwrecks reported from historic records. The AWOIS list focuses on
shipwrecks and other navigational hazards along the coastal United States. The PBS&J database was
assembled by a group of archaeologists, including this author, and is based in part on information
gathered from charts, historical reports, THC files, and the AWOIS database. The PBS&J database
focuses primarily on well-documented commercial wrecks postdating 1850.
The THC Sites Atlas was searched out for a distance of 3 miles in each direction from the survey
boundary. It is important to note that the final disposition of most wrecks has not been ascertained.
Historical accounts of wreck site locations are often inexact and can contain errors based on the original
source. Precise locations of most wrecks are unknown. Shipwrecks for which no position estimate is
available, but which, based on their descriptions, might have been lost in the vicinity, are included in
Table 1.
Wrecks reported as specifically associated with geographic features located outside of the APE, such as
Cox Point, Matagorda Bay or the Gulf of Mexico, have been excluded from Table 1 unless represented as
nearby in THC records. Wrecks charted inside or on the margin of the APE by at least one source are
indicated by use of an asterisk (*) in Table 1. None of the ships reported in Table 1 have been located by
archaeologists, rather these are potential identifications that might be associated with geophysical
targets discovered by this survey.
At least 19 shipwrecks have been reported within a 3-mile radius of the survey area by one or more of
the sources listed above. The positioning for most of these reports is generally accurate only at the scale
of large landmarks. For example, any wreck reported as occurring in âLavaca Bayâ might be in the APE
unless more specific information is available to suggest otherwise. Of this number, as many as 5 wrecks
have been reported within or on the margins of the APE (indicated by an asterisk [*] in Table 1).
The THC reports two wrecks (THC Numbers 1235 and 1238) near the southern end of the APE. Both of
these were reported as dating prior to 1976, which indicates the source of the information was a 1976
NOAA navigation chart. The 2013 edition of NOAA Chart 11317 shows at least 4 wrecks charted along
the southern shoreline of the APE and another 2 wrecks located slightly east of the APE near the Point
Comfort Shoreline.
THC 1235 corresponds with an area charted as âFoul Wksâ on the 2013 edition of NOAA Chart 11317.
THC 1238 is located reasonably near AWOIS 5273, which was confirmed as wreckage by a NOAA survey
in 1992. The 2013 edition of NOAA Chart 11317 shows a âWreck-Visibleâ symbol at this same location,
which is presumed to represent the same vessel. Two other wrecks are charted inside the APE on the
2013 edition of NOAA Chart 11317. One is shown as a Wreck Awash symbol and the other is charted as
âWks.â
AWOIS 5271, on the margin of the APE, represents two groups of sunken derelict barges confirmed by a
NOAA survey in 1992. They have been charted since at least 1975. These barges appear to have been
intentionally scuttled to provide shelter for an uncharted channel connecting the Point Comfort
Shoreline with the Lavaca River Channel. AWOIS reports that âat the beach end of the channelâ¦the first
700 feet of channel is lined with sunken barges.â

Factors Affecting Vessel Loss
The main factors influencing the loss of vessels in the APE are shallow water, including oyster reefs and
the shoreline combined with seasonal and tropical weather extremes. The concentration of vessel traffic
through the northern half of Lavaca Bay was relatively light; however, historic navigation occurred in the
vicinity by the late 17th century and possible as early as the 16th century. Stranding is the most common
mechanism by which ships are wrecked, accounting for about 64 percent of total losses reported by the
U.S. Lifesaving Service for the period 1876 through 1914 (Gearhart, et al. 1990: Volume IV, 59-61). Two
thirds of stranding events were caused by weather. Most stranding events occur along a shoreline.
Stranding is the most likely source of shipping losses, other than perhaps intentional abandonment, in
the APE. The shoreline and water depth have not changed significantly in historic times (compare figures
3 and 4).
Severe weather was, and remains, the most significant environmental factor contributing to shipwrecks,
accounting for 55 percent of total losses reported by the U.S. Lifesaving Service for the period 1876
through 1914. Prior to modern weather forecasting, mariners were hampered by relatively short
warnings of approaching storms. Hazardous weather conditions can occur along the central Texas Coast
throughout much of the year. Strong northern winds are generated through the area each winter by the
passage of 15 to 20 northers, or rapidly moving polar fronts, each generally lasting 24â36 hours. Such
storms may contain 50-mile-per-hour winds and generate intense wave activity and longshore currents
(McGowen 1976:19â23, 94). Hurricane season lasts from late June through October. Hurricanes have
winds in excess of 74 miles per hour and can have devastating effects on any ships caught in their paths.
Factors Affecting Vessel Preservation
Preservation of vessels wrecked within the APE would depend largely upon the composition of their hull
and the degree to which they become and remain buried. The lower portions of vessels wrecked in this
region can become buried soon after sinking due in part to scour and liquefaction of sediments during
storms. Metal vessels remain exposed much longer than wooden ones, although their lower hulls are
equally susceptible to burial.
Any wooden components that are not buried tend to disintegrate quickly. Wood-boring organisms
rapidly consume exposed wood. In shallow water, wood weakened by biological organisms and water
saturation is then disarticulated and laid flat or removed by hurricanes and/or fishing trawlers. In areas
such as this having copious quantities of weakly consolidated sediment, significant portions of a wooden
hull can become buried, protecting it from biological degradation. Burial produces an oxygen-deprived
environment, which promotes long-term preservation of wood.
Iron artifacts, on the other hand, corrode five times faster in seawater than when buried on land.
Calcium carbonate forms a concretion around iron artifacts that incorporates surrounding materials
such as rock and sand or even other artifacts. Oxidation can eventually leach out most or all of the iron,
leaving only a carbonate mold of the original artifact (Hamilton 1998). Nevertheless, iron and steel hulls
can survive exposure to seawater in various states of preservation for well over a century.

Previous Investigations
SAM reviewed the findings of published cultural resource studies having relevancy to the present
project. Four marine archaeological surveys and one desktop study have been completed previously
within 3 miles of the APE. None of those surveys overlaps the APE, and no shipwrecks have been
assigned Texas archaeological site designations within 3 miles of the APE.
A study was conducted from 1991-1992 under Texas Antiquities Permit 1027 on behalf of the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers along the lower reaches of the Lavaca and Navidad Rivers in Jackson and Calhoun
counties (Pearson and James 1991; Pearson et al. 1993). That study included a magnetometer survey
and subsequent diver investigations in the river. Remains of a steamboat (Site 41JK9), scuttled in 1864,
and a wooden fishing trawler (Site 41JK188) were recorded downstream of Palmetto Bend Reservoir in
Jackson County. The steamboat was first reported by George Hutchens in 1965. Both of these sites are
located greater than 3 miles from the APE.
HRA Gray & Pape, LLC was contracted by URS Corporation in 2005 to conduct a cultural resource
background study of areas within a half mile of the Matagorda Ship Channel. This work was performed
in anticipation of future archaeology surveys of the ship channel margins and proposed placement
areas. They compiled a list of 19 historic markers, 36 archaeological sites, and 9 shipwrecks based on an
examination of the AWOIS database and the THC Atlas (Hughey 2005).
In 2005 and 2006, a preliminary study was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit 4079 on behalf of
URS Corporation and their client, the Calhoun County Navigation District, in connection with proposed
modifications of the Matagorda Ship Channel. A survey was conducted by NCS Subsea, Inc. in December,
2005, which included the turning basin at Point Comfort and three associated dredge placement areas.
PBS&J reviewed that data and found no evidence for potential shipwreck sites in the study area
(Borgens and Gearhart 2006).
Further extensive investigation associated with proposed expansion of the ship channel was performed
in 2006 under Texas Antiquities Permit 4080 (Borgens et al. 2007). The Calhoun County Navigation
District proposed to double the existing width of the Matagorda Ship Channel and deepen the channel
by 8 ft. The study included a marine geophysical survey along both sides of the Matagorda Ship Channel
and including areas proposed for placement of dredged materials. The remote-sensing survey included
the collection of magnetometer, side-scan sonar, and bathymetric data. A total of 39 potentially
significant magnetometer anomalies, and 4 sonar targets were discovered by the survey.
In 2013 a study was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 6335 (Tuttle 2013) in support of
a Liquid Natural Gas project in Lavaca Bay proposed by Excelerate Energy. The study included a remote
sensing data analysis, but as of this writing, only an interim report has been submitted.

Research Design

Survey Methods
SAMâs survey methodology followed the requirements stipulated by the THC. The survey was conducted
from a 25-foot hydrographic survey vessel. Positioning was provided by a Hemisphere VS131 Differential
Global Positioning System (GPS). Hypack software was used for navigation and for logging of GPS-sensor
offset positions, as well as magnetometer and bathymetry data. Horizontal positions were based on the
Texas State Plane Coordinate System (North American Datum 1983 [NAD83], South Central Zone, U.S.
ft). Primary transects were surveyed parallel to one another and spaced an average of 20 m (66 ft) apart.
Bathymetry data were collected using an Odom CVM recording fathometer (200 kiloHertz). The CVM
was calibrated using an Odom Digibar-Pro sound velocity meter. Bathymetry is intended as a planning
tool in the event of future archaeological activities and is a requirement of the Texas Antiquities Permit.
Bathymetry from this survey was tidally corrected to meet engineering needs of the sponsor.
Magnetic data were acquired using a Geometrics 882 magnetometer equipped with a depth sensor. The
magnetometer sensor was towed on the sea surface 72 ft aft of the survey boat and within 20 ft of the
seafloor. Magnetometer data illustrated in Appendix A has been thinned to a 1-second interval between
data points.
An Edgetech 4125 side-scan sonar (600 kiloHertz) was towed from the survey vesselâs starboard side.
GPS positions were integrated into sonar imagery using Edgetechâs Discover Sonar Acquisition Software,
which was also used for recording the acoustic data. The sonar was set to image the seafloor for a
distance of 50 m (164 ft) to either side of the survey path. A mosaic image of the sonar data (Section V
and Appendix A) was created using Chesapeake SonarWiz software. The data were analyzed to locate
and map objects projecting above the seafloor.
The magnetometer was the primary instrument relied upon for locating and recognizing potential
shipwreck sites. Side-scan sonar imagery provided verification of magnetic anomaly sources exposed
above the mud line. Shipwrecks are visible on the side-scan sonar record if exposed and are located
solely based on magnetometer readings if buried. Vessels predating World War II tend to be constructed
of wood thus generally are not preserved above the seafloor. Nevertheless buried portions of such sites
can retain a high level of artifact preservation and historic integrity. No artifacts were collected during
this survey.
A Microsoft EXCEL spreadsheet was used to process the magnetometer data prior to contouring. The
spreadsheet uses an algorithm to remove diurnal fluctuations. The difference between anomalous
values and the local background field results in a dataset where abnormally high and low magnetic
values (anomalies) are centered around zero (the ambient level). This process removes low frequency
trends from the dataset, such as those caused by diurnal variation, geologic gradients, or gradual
changes in water depth while leaving high-frequency variations (anomalies) intact. Diurnal processing
allows visual representation of the data that reflects the polarity of magnetic anomalies.

15 | P a g e

A contour map of the diurnally-corrected magnetometer data was prepared using Bentleyâs GeopakÂ®
digital terrain modeling software at a 5-nanoTesla (nT) contour interval (Appendix A). Magnetometer
data illustrated in Appendix A and text figures below has been thinned to a 1-second interval between
data points. Magnetic amplitudes between +5 nT and ï­5 nT are considered insignificant for purposes of
marine archaeological interpretations. The 0-nT contour level is omitted from the contour maps to
prevent a cluttered appearance. Positive amplitude in all magnetic contour illustrations is indicated by
red contours. Negative amplitude is indicated by blue contours.

Interpretation of Magnetometer Data
The probable sources for most magnetic anomalies are relatively small items of modern ferrous debris.
Such anomalies tend to be more concentrated in proximity to modern navigation channels and in other
areas of heavy use. Ferromagnetic debris is common in such settings due to the frequency of
commercial and recreational boat traffic. Concentrations of magnetic anomalies also tend to occur in
the vicinity of industrial developments, petroleum wells, and pipelines.
The method used here to interpret unidentified magnetic anomalies is based upon a comparison of
verified shipwreck and debris anomalies as detailed in Gearhart (2011) and summarized below. The
author has assembled, over the past several years, a diverse collection of magnetic anomalies recorded
over 29 verified shipwrecks and many debris sources in an effort to characterize differences between
these two categories of magnetic sources. Shipwrecks included in this dataset encompass a wide variety
of hull compositions (wood, iron, steel, and concrete), propulsion systems (sail, steam-driven
paddlewheels and propellers, oil and diesel screws, and towed or pushed barges), ages (mid-16th to the
mid-20th century), and depositional environments (harbor entrances, surf zones, beaches, marsh, oyster
reefs, open bay, and the Gulf of Mexico). These vessels also wrecked in various ways including by
stranding, foundering (sinking), boiler explosions, and burning. Some were even partially demolished
and/or salvaged after wrecking. Based on Gearhartâs (2011) sample, it is possible to characterize
shipwreck and debris anomalies in an empirical fashion.
Complexity
Many archaeologists have attempted to characterize the differences between shipwreck anomalies and
those associated with ferromagnetic debris. Shipwreck anomalies frequently have been described as
appearing âmulticomponentâ or âcomplexâ, emphasizing the fact that shipwreck anomalies, in certain
contexts, may exhibit multiple dipoles in addition to having unpaired monopolar amplitudes. Garrison et
al. (1989: II, 223) summarized the more common methods used at the time for prioritizing anomalies.
Historic shipwreck anomalies were said to share the following characteristics: multiple amplitude peaks
of differing magnitudes spread over an area greater than 10,000 square meters (2.5 acres), gentle
gradients, and a linear association with anomalies on adjacent transects. Debris anomalies were
characterized as typically having single amplitude peaks covering an area of less than 10,000 square
meters, steep gradients, and no alignment of anomalies on adjacent lines.
Horizontal Dimensions
The horizontal size of an anomaly is referred to by many archaeologists as âdurationâ in reference to
how many seconds a magnetometer registers anomalous readings as it passes overhead in the water
16 | P a g e

column. Duration obviously depends upon the velocity of the survey boat; therefore this author instead
refers to duration as anomaly width exceeding the +/ï­ 5-nT amplitude level. Duration is often used by
archaeologists as a tool for discriminating potentially significant anomalies from those more likely to be
caused by debris. For example, Linden and Pearson (2014) would consider an anomaly significant if it
has amplitude of at least 50 nT and a duration equivalent to 65 ft or more.
The widths of historic wood-hulled shipwrecks and debris anomalies overlap significantly, thus width (or
duration) is not a very useful tool for discriminating between the two categories of anomaly. Most
debris anomalies tend to be no wider than anomalies observed over wood-hulled sailing ships or woodhulled steamboats; however, within the category of shipwreck anomalies, there is a 15-fold difference in
width between the smallest wood-hulled sailing vessel and the largest steel tanker. In other words,
when it comes to width alone, anomalies of small wooden ships, which tend to be the most historic,
look more like debris anomalies and bear less resemblance to larger, especially ferrous, shipwrecks.
The most difficult shipwrecks to detect are the small, wooden, generally historic sites, precisely because
their anomalies are in the size range of many debris anomalies. The smallest verified shipwreck anomaly
known to this author (Figure 5) was recorded over the wreck of an early 19th-century sailing vessel, Site
41CL92. The site was shown by divers to measure at least 23 x 52 ft (7 x 15.9 m) and is characterized by
a large collection of concreted artifacts, iron bar stock, and pig iron ballast (Borgens 2004).
Distinguishing the anomalies of small shipwrecks from debris anomalies in the same size range is
complicated and cannot be done on the basis of size alone. Garrison et al. (1989: II, 223) characterized
shipwreck anomalies as typically being larger than 10,000 square meters; however, if that were the only
criterion used for selecting significant anomalies, all of the wood-hulled sailing ships and all but one of
the wood-hulled steamboat anomalies known to this author would be excluded. For example, Site
41CL92, believed to be either the 67-ft New Orleans schooner Hannah Elizabeth that sank in 1835 or the
Mexican naval sloop General Bustamante that sank in 1830 (Borgens 2004), covers an area of only 1,580
square meters (0.4 acres) out to the 5-nT contour.
Amplitude
Amplitude is even less useful as a tool for differentiating shipwrecks from debris due to the substantial
overlap between shipwreck and debris anomaly amplitudes. The peak-to-peak amplitude of shipwreck
anomalies from Gearhart (2011) averages 270 nT for wood-hulled sailing vessels (n=6); 5,020 nT for
wood-hulled machine-powered vessels (n=7); and 10,386 nT for iron- and steel-hulled vessels (n=12).
Debris anomalies can have amplitude virtually anywhere within the range of shipwreck anomalies.
Anomaly amplitude correlates poorly with vessel size because amplitude depends greatly upon the
distance between the magnetometer and the magnetic source. Anomalies with large amplitude can
result from a wooden shipwreck containing a relatively small iron mass when measured at close range.
Orientation
Despite the diversity of shipwrecks, their anomalies consistently have one characteristic in common with
one another. They are aligned closely with earthâs magnetic field (e.g., Figure 5). In mid-latitudes of the
northern hemisphere, where all of the wrecks discussed by Gearhart (2011) occur, the primary negative
17 | P a g e

pole of each shipwreck anomaly is located to the north of its positive pole. By contrast, the alignments
of debris anomalies are not limited to one particular orientation.
A simple debris source produces an anomaly dominated by its permanent magnetic field, thus the
anomaly alignment associated with a solitary item of debris is determined by the orientation of the
object on the seabed, and the polar axis of debris anomalies can be oriented along any point of the
compass. On the other hand, shipwrecks are complex anomaly sources comprised of many
ferromagnetic objects. The randomly-oriented permanent magnetic field of each ferromagnetic
component in a shipwreck tends to be cancelled by the overlapping fields of other nearby sources. The
weaker, earth-induced field of each source is reinforced by the induced fields of all other nearby
components, since all of the induced fields are oriented parallel to earthâs local field lines. As a result,
shipwrecks and other complex sources have anomalies closely aligned to the direction of magnetic
north.
The characteristic of anomaly orientation is used to differentiate magnetic anomalies caused by most
ferrous debris from anomalies caused by shipwrecks. Consideration of magnetic anomaly orientation
has potential to eliminate up to about 80 percent of debris anomalies from further archaeological
concern. By chance, about 20 percent of simple debris sources have anomaly orientations overlapping
those of complex sources, including shipwrecks. At present there is no consistent method for eliminating
that 20 percent of debris from consideration as a potential buried shipwreck.
Many anomalies, however, can be eliminated from consideration as potential shipwrecks simply by
demonstrating that their orientations differ substantially from the direction of magnetic north. The only
cases in which anomalies of simple debris sources should align with earthâs magnetic field is when, by
chance, their magnetic moments, as determined by their orientation on the seafloor, closely align with
magnetic north. The opposite case, a wood-hulled shipwreck having a magnetic anomaly not aligned
with magnetic north, is virtually impossible, as it would require a large percentage of a wreckâs many
ferromagnetic components, by chance, to have the same magnetic moment.
Interpretation of magnetic anomalies, in practice, was done by comparing the magnetometer data,
contoured at a 5-nT interval, to the anomaly of the small wood-hulled historic shipwreck, 41CL92, shown
in Figure 5. The verified 41CL92 shipwreck anomaly was contoured using the same parameters as the
survey data from this project and was properly oriented and scaled to match the data to which it was
compared. Any anomalies lacking a polar orientation similar to 41CL92, given a sufficient data density,
were excluded from further consideration. Anomalies remaining as shipwreck candidates were then
researched with the Railroad Commission of Texas to determine which ones could be attributed to
abandoned petroleum wells, which also happen to closely resemble shipwreck anomalies.

Results

Twenty two magnetic anomalies have been recommended for avoidance due to their potential
association with historic shipwrecks. None of those targets are confirmed as wrecks by sonar imagery;
however, an area of submerged wreckage, which was too shallow to survey, was visually confirmed in
the southeastern corner of the APE.

Side-Scan Sonar
Side-scan sonar data is illustrated as a mosaic in Figure 6. A more detailed view of the sonar mosaic is
provided in Appendix A. A total of 2 unique targets, Sonar-1 and Sonar-2, were observed in the sonar
data. Dimensions and interpretations of sonar targets are provided in Table 2. Positions for both targets
are included in Appendix B. Both targets are closely associated with a 900-foot-long linear magnetic

anomaly, which is interpreted as abandoned dredge pipe, based on its position adjacent and parallel to
the Channel to Red Bluff. Sonar Targets 1 and 2 (Figures 7 and 8) are interpreted as disarticulated
segments of abandoned dredge pipe. Neither target is believed to be associated with historic cultural
materials.

Magnetometer
Magnetometer data is illustrated as contours in Appendix A. Additional data were gathered over
selected anomalies along transects spaced 10 m (33 ft) apart in order to better evaluate their historic
potential. Information regarding petroleum infrastructure was obtained from the Railroad Commission
21 | P a g e

of Texasâ Public GIS Viewer. Two wells and one pipeline are reported in the APE all of which were
confirmed close to their reported positions by magnetic anomalies.
Twenty two magnetic anomalies are interpreted as potential historic shipwrecks based on their
resemblance to verified wreck anomalies (e.g., Figure 5), as described in Section IV. None of those
anomalies are associated with side-scan sonar targets. Magnetic anomalies interpreted as potential
wrecks are illustrated in Figures 9 to 27. The possible association of those 22 anomalies with historic
shipwrecks cannot be ruled out based on the geophysical data at hand. Their sources might, therefore,
meet criteria for inclusion on the NRHP.

Archaeological Assessment
Analysis of survey data revealed 22 magnetic anomalies consistent with those produced by complex
anomaly sources such as shipwrecks. No wrecks were confirmed by sonar imagery. As many as 5 wrecks
have been reported within or on the margins of the APE (indicated by an asterisk [*] in Table 1). None of
these wrecks can be positively correlated with specific geophysical targets from this survey; however,
they may be represented in the data.
An area of wreckage was visually confirmed in the southeastern corner of the APE, although the area
was too shallow to survey. This area is charted as âFoul Wksâ on the 2013 edition of NOAA Chart 11317.
Nearby AWOIS 5271, described as âtwo groups of sunken derelict bargesâ confirmed by a NOAA survey
in 1992, is believed to be associated with the charted area of âFoul Wksâ observed during this survey.
They appear to have been intentionally scuttled by 1975 to provide protection for the shoreward end of
an uncharted channel connecting the Point Comfort Shoreline with the Lavaca River Channel. AWOIS
reports that âat the beach end of the channelâ¦the first 700 feet of channel is lined with sunken barges.â

Recommendations
The 22 magnetic anomalies described above (Mag 1 to Mag 22) and the area of visually-confirmed
wreckage observed in the southeastern corner of the APE are potentially associated with historic
shipwrecks thus could meet criteria for State Antiquities Landmark or for the NRHP. SAM recommends
avoidance of all 22 targets, as well as the visually-confirmed area of wreckage, by bottom-disturbing
activities associated with this project. Details regarding the age, construction and function of these
abandoned vessels is unavailable and cannot be discerned from this survey. They should be considered
31 | P a g e

potentially eligible for the NRHP until such time as they may be demonstrated otherwise by a hands-on
archaeological assessment. Avoidance distance is mandated by The Texas Administrative Code, Title 13,
Part 2, Chapter 26, as 50 m (164 ft) beyond the target boundaries. In the case of the exposed wreckage,
the exact target boundary is unknown, since the survey vessel could not safely approach close enough to
record a sonar image, thus the entire area lacking sonar data is recommended for avoidance.
In the event that shipwreck remains, or other potentially historic materials, are discovered anywhere in
the APE during the course of construction, work should be halted within 50 m (164 ft) of the find until
the THC can provide direction concerning the discovery. SAM recommends cultural resource clearance
for all portions of the APE outside of avoidance polygons as illustrated in Appendix A.
