Intensive Cultural Resources Survey
of Proposed Improvements to Raider Way and East Woodview Drive

ABSTRACT
At the request of Walker Partners, and on behalf of the City of Leander, Texas, SWCA Environmental
Consultants (SWCA) conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of proposed improvements to
approximately 4,630 feet of Raider Way and East Woodview Drive in the City of Leander, Williamson
County, Texas. Because the project involves lands owned by the City of Leander (a political subdivision
of the state), the project is subject to review under the Antiquities Code of Texas. SWCA conducted the
investigations under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7812.
Planned improvements would involve roughly 2,872 feet of Raider Way and 1,954 feet of East
Woodview Drive. The proposed project would utilize existing rights-of-way (ROWs) along Raider Way
and East Woodview Drive, as well as proposed ROW on adjacent private property. Roadway
improvements will include the widening of Raider Way and East Woodview Drive to 47 feet of
pavement, as well as the construction of a roundabout at the Raider Way and East Woodview Drive
intersection. Additional project elements include an approximately 660-foot long deceleration lane within
the existing United States (US) Highway 183A frontage road, curbs, gutters, storm sewers, water quality
features, lighting, landscaping, irrigation, and 6- to 8-foot-wide sidewalks. Overall, the planned project
area would impact a 4,826-foot-long by 120-foot-wide area that encompasses approximately 13.3 acres.
The depth of impacts is anticipated to extend 3 to 4 feet below ground surface for roadway construction
and up to 10 feet for any cross drainage culverts.
Investigations included a background review and an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel testing of
existing and proposed ROW. The background literature review determined that four cultural resources
surveys are known to have been conducted in close proximity to the proposed project area; those various
investigations resulted in the recording of one archaeological site (41WM1065) just east of Raider Way.
Additionally, a review of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Historic Overlay maps
revealed eight possible historic-age structures adjacent to the project area.
Field investigations involved the excavation of 37 shovel tests and an extensive examination of the
ground surface within the proposed ROW. During these investigations, SWCA recorded one previously
undocumented historic site (41WM1354) consisting of two mobile home or trailer foundations. SWCA
recommends that the parts of 41WM1354 within the current project area do not warrant designation as a
State Antiquities Landmark (SAL); the remainder of the site outside of the project area could not be
evaluated and is of undetermined eligibility. Based on these data, no further work or avoidance is
recommended for the parts of site 41WM1354 within the current project area. However, should the
proposed project design change and require impacts to parts of 41WM1354 outside the current project
area, those areas would require additional survey.
SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify cultural resources properties within the
Raider Way and East Woodview Drive project area. As no archaeological historic properties or sites were
identified that may meet the criteria for designation as an SAL, as per 13 Texas Administrative Code
26.10, SWCA recommends no further cultural resources investigations within the project area.

INTRODUCTION
At the request of Walker Partners, and on behalf of the City of Leander, Texas, SWCA Environmental
Consultants (SWCA) conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of proposed improvements (i.e.,
widening) to approximately 4,826 feet of Raider Way and East Woodview Drive in the City of Leander,
Williamson County, Texas (Figure 1). Because the project involves lands owned by the City of Leander
(a political subdivision of the State of Texas), the project is subject to review under the Antiquities Code
of Texas (ACT). Planned improvements would involve roughly 2,872 feet of Raider Way and 1,954 feet
of East Woodview Drive. The proposed project would utilize existing rights-of-way (ROWs) along
Raider Way and East Woodview Drive, as well as proposed ROW on adjacent private property.
Investigations included a background review and an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel testing of
existing and proposed ROW. All investigations were conducted in accordance with Texas Historical
Commission (THC) and Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) standards, as well as the guidelines
provided in Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (National Park Service 1983). The
cultural resources survey efforts were conducted by SWCA archaeologists Mary Rodriguez and Ben
Morton on October 25, 2016. Brandon S. Young served as Principal Investigator under Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 7812, issued by the THC.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The approximately 4,826-foot-long project alignment appears on portions of the Leander, Texas (3097214) U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle map. The proposed project
would utilize existing rights-of-way (ROWs) along Raider Way and East Woodview Drive, as well as
proposed ROW on adjacent private property. Roadway improvements will include the widening of Raider
Way and East Woodview Drive to 47 feet of pavement, as well as the construction of a roundabout at the
Raider Way and East Woodview Drive intersection (Figure 2). Additional project elements include an
approximately 660-foot long deceleration lane within the existing United States (US) Highway 183A
frontage road, curbs, gutters, storm sewers, water quality features, lighting, landscaping, irrigation, and 6to 8-foot-wide sidewalks. Overall, the planned project area would impact a 4,826-foot-long by 120-footwide area along Raider Way and East Woodview Drive that encompasses approximately 13.3 acres, as
well as the 660-foot long deceleration lane area that encompasses approximately 0.23 acre; the total
project area is approximately 13.5 acres in size (Figure 2). The depth of impacts is anticipated to extend 3
to 4 feet below ground surface for roadway construction and up to 10 feet for any cross drainage culverts.

GEOLOGY AND SOILS
The underlying geology throughout the project area consists of Early Cretaceous Walnut Clay (clay,
limestone, and shale with some calcite beds) that is approximately 125 to 175 feet thick (Barnes 1974).
Given the age and physical properties of Walnut Clay, it has virtually no potential to contain buried
archaeological resources. Project area soils are mapped as Eckrant cobbly clay, 1 to 8 percent slopes
(Natural Resources Conservation Service [NRCS] 2016). As this soil developed in place from residuum
weathered from limestone, it has little to no potential to contain intact deeply buried archaeological
materials.

CULTURAL BACKGROUND AND SETTING
Williamson County is on the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau and near the eastern margins of the
Central Texas archaeological region, as defined by Collins (2004), Prewitt (1981, 1985), Suhm (1960),
and other researchers. The Central Texas archaeological region is an artificial construct, and its
boundaries are somewhat arbitrary (Collins 2004:102). As Collins (2004:103) points out, it is unlikely
that any group in the past 11,000 years had their key resources, geographic range, or political sphere
conform to these boundaries. It is worth noting that Perttula (2004:Figure 1.1) extends the boundaries of
Central Texas much farther east than many researchers. Nevertheless, situated as it is on the Edwards
Plateauâs margins, the sites identified within the project area share many traits in common with âclassicâ
Central Texas sites (i.e., those above the Balcones Escarpment).
As noted above, the project area is near the eastern edge of the Central Texas archaeological region. Its
occupants likely ranged west, deeper into the Edwards Plateau, and east, onto the rolling Blackland
Prairie. Inhabitants of the area were influenced by cultural developments taking place in Central Texas, as
well as to the east. Regardless of the intensity or nature of influences from off the plateau, we rely on
more developed chronologies from Central Texas to summarize the cultural history of the area. Following
standard chronological divisions, we divide the prehistoric cultural sequence into three periods:
Paleoindian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric. The Archaic period is commonly subdivided into three
subperiods (Early, Middle, and Late), although, as this report addresses, various labels have been applied
to the last few centuries of the Archaic; we generically call the period from approximately 600 B.C. to
A.D. 700 âthe end of the Archaic.â

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD
The Paleoindian period, which includes the earliest known peoples in the area, began during the close of
the Pleistocene. The presence of Paleoindian artifacts and sites, dating from about 11,500 to 8800 B.P., are
not considered uncommon in Central Texas (Collins 2004). Two of the more important Paleoindian sites
in Texas are near the current project area: the Wilson-Leonard site (41WM235) on Brushy Creek in
southern Williamson County and the Gault site (41BL323) in adjacent Bell County.
Diagnostic artifacts of the period include lanceolate-shaped and fluted projectile points such as Clovis,
Folsom, and Plainview. These projectile points were hafted onto wooden spears and often used to hunt
big game such as mammoth, mastodon, bison, camel, and horse (Black 1989; Bousman et al. 2004).
Recent research has demonstrated that Paleoindian people relied on a more diverse subsistence base than
previously thought, exploiting a variety of plants and small fauna in addition to the larger animals
(Bousman et al. 2004). Paleoindian lifeways gradually transitioned to a more Archaic-style adaptation
(increasing reliance on plants and smaller game, better-defined and smaller group territories, and regional
diversification in projectile point styles) as the big game died off and the climate warmed following the
end of the Pleistocene ice age (Bousman et al. 2004).

ARCHAIC PERIOD
As the Paleoindian period came to an end, humans began to more intensively harvest local floral and
faunal resources. Material culture became more regionally diversified, and the use of burned rock
middens and ovens became widespread. This period is known as the Archaic period and dates from
approximately 8800 to 1200 B.P. in Central Texas (Collins 2004; Johnson and Goode 1994).

EARLY ARCHAIC
The Early Archaic is commonly dated to ca. 8800 to 6000 B.P. (Collins 2004:119). Research suggests that
Early Archaic people became increasingly reliant on local resources and residential mobility decreased
(Prewitt 1981:73; Suhm et al. 1954:18). Early Archaic populations utilized base camps for longer periods,
perhaps seasonally, and hunted a diverse array of small (e.g., snakes, turtles, rodents, rabbits), medium
(e.g., opossums and raccoons), and large (e.g., deer and antelope) game; fished local rivers; and cooked
wild plant bulbs in earth ovens. It is likely that the reduction in residential mobility was related to a
variety of factors including diminished bison populations, population increase, tribal territoriality issues,
and climatic change. By the start of the Early Archaic, well-established resident populations lived in
every biogeographical region of Texas.
Collins (2004:120) and McKinney (1981) observe that a large number of Early Archaic sites are
documented along the eastern and southern margins of the Edwards Plateau. They argue that if our
current understanding of Early Archaic site distribution reflects prehistoric land use, then the Early
Archaic was a period when people were living in the better-watered parts of the Edwards Plateau. With
very low population densities across the state at the beginning of the Archaic, it makes sense that the
environmentally desirable zones, such as the well-watered ecotone along the margins of the Edwards
Plateau, would be the first areas to have been more heavily settled.
During the Early Archaic, projectile points became more regionally diversified, and stemmed forms
replaced the lanceolate points of the Paleoindian period. This technological shift may have been due, in
part, to the development of a more localized, broad-based hunting and gathering economy that
necessitated differing point types for different game (Johnson and Goode 1994; Story 1985). Early
Archaic populations supplemented their hunting diet with a diverse assemblage of processed plant foods.
This is most evident through the use of hot rock cooking technologies, which become commonplace at
Early Archaic sites. Early Archaic burned rock features are most often small- to medium-sized hearths,
with minimal evidence of reuse. However, at a few Early Archaic sites (e.g., Wilson-Leonard and Loeve),
larger earth ovens have been documented (Collins et al. 1998; Prewitt 1982); these are believed to be the
precursors to burned rock middens.
A burned rock midden is a large, dense feature of burned rocks and ash-stained soil that accumulates from
use and reuse as a thermal cooking feature (Black et al. 1997; Mahoney et al. 2003; Suhm 1960). The
number of burned rock middens increased throughout the Archaic period and it seems clear that their
technological roots lie in the first earth ovens of the Early Archaic (Black et al. 1997; Collins et al. 1998;
Decker et al. 2000). Burned rock midden technology appears to have first developed in the eastern plateau
around 8500 to 8000 B.P. and gradually spread into the western plateau ca. 6500 to 5000 B.P. (Decker et
al. 2000:301). These large features vary greatly in size and form, but share the common functional
purpose of serving as an earth oven or similar cooking device (Black et al. 1997; Weir 1976).
Work completed on the Gatlin site, 41KR621, in southern Central Texas highlighted the complexity and
diversity in the Early Archaic settlement system noted by previous researchers (Houk et al. 2008). As
Johnson (1991:159) states, âpeople acquired different foods at different suitable places,â meaning that
certain sites were visited repeatedly on a seasonal basis. Johnson (1991:160) speculated that people in the
eastern part of Central Texas may not have had large base camps, instead they traveled from site to site in
small groups; the Gatlin site data for the Early Archaic period supports this hypothesis. In fact, based on a
study conducted as part of the Gatlin site analysis, only the Wilson-Leonard site was classified as an Early
Archaic base camp out of 16 well-documented Early Archaic components in Central Texas. The other
sites all represent short-term, specialized activity sites (Houk et al. 2008).

MIDDLE ARCHAIC
The Middle Archaic is commonly dated to ca. 6000 to 4000 B.P. (Collins 2004:120). During the
beginning of the Middle Archaic, from approximately 5750 to 5250 B.P., Johnson and Goode (1994:73)
contend that a brief warm and dry period arose. Hudler (2000) also documents a major climatic shift
towards warmer and drier conditions ca. 5300 B.P., followed by a very brief wet interval. Johnson and
Goode (1994:73) also believe this dry period was followed by a short period of climatic amelioration
between 5250 to 4600 B.P. with moderately wet and cool conditions.
The Middle Archaic is marked by a significant increase in archaeological sites on the Edwards Plateau. It
is difficult to determine if this increase is due to a larger, denser population or an increase in residential
mobility (Turpin 2004). In either case, there is abundant evidence that settlement and subsistence became
more regionally specialized during this time. Burned rock hearths, scatters, and concentrations are
common at Middle Archaic sites; however, none of these features is more pronounced than the burned
rock midden, the use of which proliferated during the Middle Archaic (Black et al. 1997; Prewitt 1981;
Shafer 1988). There is widespread evidence supporting an increased reliance on the processing of
geophytes and succulent plant bulbs such as sotol, yucca, and lechuguilla in burned rock middens (Dering
1999). Three distinct types of burned rock middens documented during the Middle Archaic: 1) sheet
middens, 2) dome middens, and 3) annular middens (Mahoney et al. 2003). Sheet middens are loose
accumulations of displaced and mixed burned rocks, usually derived from several burned rock features.
The rock displacement may be caused by natural or cultural processes, including erosion, flooding,
feature maintenance, and/or reuse. Dome middens are round, dome-shaped accumulations of burned rock
that can be several feet thick. Dome middens form through repeated feature use and maintenance, thus
resulting in a massive, dense accumulation of burned rock. Annular middens (also called crescent, ring, or
donut middens) are circular or semicircular-shaped accumulations of burned rock with a centralized
depression. Like dome middens, they may be several feet thick.
Early Triangular dart points appear in the beginning of the Middle Archaic subperiod, around 5300 B.P. at
the Gatlin site (Houk et al. 2008:Figure 13.2). This unstemmed type co-occurs with Bell and Andice
points, which are basally notched, stemmed point forms (Mahoney et al. 2003; Sorrow et al. 1967).
Wyckoffâs (1995) research suggests that Bell and Andice points (also known as Calf Creek points) are
intrinsically linked to bison hunting. Their appearance at the beginning of the Middle Archaic is
presumably related to the return of bison to the area ca. 5000 B.P. Nolan and La Jita points, which have
square to rectangular stems with weak, rounded, or abrupt shoulders, appear in the Central Texas
archaeological record ca. 4800 B.P. and persist into the beginning of the Late Archaic (Houk et al.
2008:Figure 13.2).
LATE ARCHAIC
The Late Archaic began around ca. 4000 B.P. and lasted until ca. 1200 B.P., ending when the bow and
arrow was introduced into Central Texas (Collins 2004:121). Late Archaic sites are more numerous than
earlier Archaic period sites (Black 1989; Collins 2004), and some researchers argue that population
increased during the Late Archaic (Johnson and Goode 1994; Prewitt 1981; Weir 1976). Increasingly
complex cultural manifestations are characterized in the Late Archaic archaeological record, and
increased population size may have contributed to this complexity (Johnson and Goode 1994).
Territoriality issues may have also been more commonplace in the Late Archaic. This argument is
somewhat supported by the development of more formal cemeteries in many areas of Texas (Hall 1981;
Lukowski 1987; Taylor and Highley 1995). Burials from these cemeteries often contain grave goods, such
as marine shell ornaments (from the Texas coast), boatstones (from Arkansas), and corner tang knives

(from the Edwards Plateau). The presence of these items ultimately suggests that plateau populations
participated in some form of a trade system during the Late Archaic (Hall 1981).
Compared to previous subperiods, an extremely diverse assemblage of projectile point forms was utilized
during the Late Archaic. Pedernales, Kinney, and Tortugas points appeared at the beginning of the period.
Pedernales points have bifurcated stems and a narrow to broad, often leaf-shaped blade (Turner and
Hester 1999). Montell, Lange, Marshall, Williams, Marcos, Castroville, and Shumla points appear
slightly later and for the most part are all broad-bladed points that generally have expanding stems and
prominent, barbed shoulders. Many of these early Late Archaic points were apparently used for bison
hunting (Dibble and Lorrain 1968).
Hot rock cooking technologies that had developed in previous periods continued to be employed during
the Late Archaic, and burned rock middens are a very common Late Archaic site feature. Many of the
burned rock middens that formed during the Middle Archaic also continued to be used by Late Archaic
peoples (Black et al. 1997).

THE END OF THE ARCHAIC AND THE BEGINNING OF THE LATE PREHISTORIC
As Collins (2004:122) notes, âdiverse and comparatively complex archaeological manifestations toward
the end of the Late Archaic attest to the emergence of types of human conduct without precedent in
Texas.â As is discussed in detail elsewhere in this report, various labelsâTransitional Archaic (Johnson
et al. 1962; Turner and Hester 1999), Terminal Archaic (Black 1989), and Late Archaic II (Johnson and
Goode 1994)âhave been applied to the end of the Archaic period. While the names differ, these
competing schemes generally begin after Marcos points appear in Central Texas, encompass the FairlandEnsor-Frio point style intervals, and end with the Darl point type. The succeeding Late Prehistoric period
began ca. 1200 B.P. with the introduction of the bow and arrow into Central Texas. The first widespread
arrow point type was Scallorn, and it is commonly associated with the Austin phase/interval, or Late
Prehistoric I (Collins 2004; Johnson and Goode 1994). Bone-tempered ceramics are also indicative of the
Late Prehistoric period, specifically the Toyah phase/interval, as will subsequently be discussed.
By the early part of the Late Archaic period, Central Texas was occupied by broad-spectrum foragers
specializing in the resources available within specific ranges or territories. Arnn (2007:274â275) argues
that the stabilization of climatic patterns during the Late Archaic allowed area-specific cultural material to
emerge throughout the region. For example, the intensification in plant processing, evidenced by
increased accumulation of rock oven features and burned rock middens, suggests an increasing reliance
on a resource that is essentially fixed on the landscape (Arnn 2007:277).
Late Archaic groups did not exist in isolation, and the eventual spread of most Late Archaic point styles,
particularly the later style types, as well as exotic materials such as marine shell and perhaps religious
ideas throughout the state suggests their participating in a âvast web of social relationsâ (Arnn 2007:277).
Decorated bone ornaments, Gulf whelk shells, and atlatl weights of exotic stone are among the new types
of materials to appear during the Late Archaic (Johnson and Goode 1994). Exotic materials are recovered
from domestic contexts as well as burials suggesting they were a pervasive component in the life of Late
Archaic peoples (Arnn 2007:277).
The end of the Archaic, then, was an interesting time in Central Texas; one that we are still struggling to
understand. Arnn (2007:278â279) argues âthat the Late Archaic Period may be viewed as a precursor (in
terms of technology, subsistence, and settlement practices) to similar technologies and practices observed
during the Late Prehistoric.â Framing the research within that context, one of continuity rather than
change, may be a useful approach for investigating the transition from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric.
As is discussed elsewhere, Johnson and Goode (1994:40) characterize the termination of the Late Archaic

as the most difficult and complex of all the period boundaries, noting that it may have ended either 400
years later with the Toyah phase or even 400 years earlier, when small dart points types like Darl
appeared.
As noted above, the end of the Archaic period chronologically is marked by the appearance of a variety of
small, side- and corner-notched dart point types including Fairland, Frio, Ensor, Ellis, and Edgewood
(Turner and Hester 1999). Johnson and Goode (1994:37) point to social interaction with the eastern
United States as a possible source for these new point types. These projectiles may have been part of a
package of new cultural items related to the spreading of Eastern religious ideas as far as the Edwards
Plateauâthese included the exotic items noted above such as marine shells and atlatl weights (Johnson
and Goode 1994:37).
An important cultural trait of the Late Archaic is the appearance of formal cemeteries off the Edwards
Plateauâon the plateau, sinkholes continued to be used as repositories for the dead. Cemeteries, where
many of the previously mentioned exotic items have been found, suggest that groups were tied to specific
territories. Cemeteries are more common in the early Late Prehistoric, and many individuals buried in
them show clear evidence of violent deaths (Johnson and Goode 1994:40). Prewitt (1982:Table 4)
provides an exhaustive, if somewhat dated, list of cemeteries and burials in eastern Central Texas, and
notes many incidences of Scallorn arrow points either with a skeleton or clearly imbedded in the skeleton.
The Loeve-Fox site (41WM230) contained an Austin phase cemetery where warfare was âsuggested by
the direct association of Scallorn arrow points with fatal positions in several skeletonsâ (Prewitt 1982:12).

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD
Introduction of the bow and arrow and, later, ceramics into Central Texas, marked the Late Prehistoric
period. Population densities dropped considerably from their Late Archaic peak (Prewitt 1985:217).
Subsistence strategies did not differ greatly from the preceding period, although bison again became an
important economic resource during the late part of the Late Prehistoric period (Prewitt 1981:74). Use of
rock and earth ovens for plant food processing and the subsequent development of burned rock middens
continued throughout the Late Prehistoric period (Black et al. 1997; Kleinbach et al. 1995:795).
Horticulture came into play very late in the region but was of minor importance to overall subsistence
strategies (Collins 2004:122).
In Central Texas, the Late Prehistoric period generally is associated with the Austin and Toyah phases
(Jelks 1962; Prewitt 1981:82â84). Austin and Toyah phase horizon markers (i.e., Scallorn-Edwards and
Perdiz arrow points, respectively) are distributed across most of the state. Violence and conflict often
marked introduction of Scallorn and Edwards arrow points into Central Texasâmany excavated burials
contain these point tips in contexts indicating they were the cause of death (Prewitt 1981:83). Subsistence
strategies and technologies (other than arrow points) did not change much from the preceding Late
Archaic period. Prewittâs (1981) use of the term âNeoarchaicâ recognizes this continuity. In fact, both
Johnson and Goode (1994:39â40) and Collins (2004:122) state that the break between the Austin and
Toyah phases could easily and appropriately represent the break between the Late Archaic and the Late
Prehistoric.

HISTORIC PERIOD
In the Historic period (1630 A.D. to present), the period of European contact and settlement in Texas, the
general Austin area was inhabited by several aboriginal groups including the Jumano, Tonkawa, Lipan
Apache and Comanche (Newcomb 2002). The first Europeans into the area were probably Spanish
missionaries who established three missions at nearby Barton Springs in 1730 (Webb 1952). The Spanish

mission period in this area was of short duration and failed to colonize or even tame the area south of the
Colorado River and north of Onion Creek. An aboriginal presence thus continued in the Austin area into
the 1860s.
After Mexico gained independence from Spain, the newly formed country used a policy of land grants to
attract Anglos from the United States to help inhabit the sparsely populated northern regions of Mexico.
During the 1820s, Stephen F. Austin obtained grants from the Mexican government to settle hundreds of
families along the lower Brazos and Colorado Rivers (Webb 1952). This colony, known as the âOld
Three Hundred Colony,â was successful in pushing the European settlement frontier further west into the
Central Texas region. Prior to the Texas Revolution, most of the âOld Three Hundred Colonyâ settlement
was focused south of Bastrop and the old La Bahia Road (Webb 1952).
During the Texas Revolution with Mexico, the area continued to be inhabited only by aboriginal Native
Americans. After the war, a growing Texan population led many settlers to move northwards in search of
open, profitable land to plant crops and raise cattle. This wave of migration spurned new conflicts with
the native groups living in the area, culminating in the Battle of Brushy Creek, near what is today the
town of Taylor, in February of 1839. This battle, between the Comanche and the Texas Rangers, resulted
in numerous deaths and eventually resulted in the removal of the Native American presence in the area.
After the battle, the nearby town of Waterloo, on the banks of the Colorado River, was renamed Austin
and designated the seat of government for the Republic of Texas in 1839 (Webb 1952). Williamson
County, located north of the new capital of Austin, was organized shortly afterward in 1848 as the
population in the area grew. The county was named in honor of Robert M. Williamson, an area leader and
a veteran of the Battle of San Jacinto. During this battle, Williamson lost one of his legs and thereafter,
wore a wooden leg, which earned him the colloquial nickname Three-Legged Willie.
The county quickly grew in population and economic prosperity as the rich soils made agriculture one of
the top industries in the area. Accompanying the increases in population and commerce was the rapid
adoption of slave labor. In 1850, two years after the founding of the county, the slave population in
Williamson County totaled 127. By 1864, less than 15 years later, the slave count had multiplied by over
10, with an enslaved population of 1,074 (Campbell 1989:266). Following the Civil War, many of the
planters turned to cattle to regain their ante-bellum prosperity.
Texas University, later named Southwestern University, was founded in Georgetown in 1873. This was
the first successful Methodist College in Texas and it brought several new facets to the county population.
The county remained dedicated primarily to agriculture and cattle production through the first half of the
twentieth century. As the modern era and new technology developed, Williamson County began to see
major changes in its configuration. Due to its proximity to Austin, the county quickly became home to
numerous large high-tech industries. This rapid influx of people and industries to the area continues to be
the hallmark of the southern half of the county today, as the northern half continues to rely mainly on
agribusiness.

METHODS
BACKGROUND REVIEW
SWCA performed a cultural resources records review to determine if the proposed area of potential
effects (APE) has been previously surveyed for cultural resources or if any archaeological sites have been
recorded within or adjacent to the APE. To conduct this review, an SWCA archaeologist reviewed
portions of the Leander, Texas (3097-321) USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle map on the THC

Texas Archeological Sites Atlas. This source provided information on the nature and location of
previously conducted archaeological surveys, previously recorded cultural resource sites, locations of
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) properties, sites designated as State Antiquities Landmarks
(SAL), Official Texas Historical Markers, Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks, cemeteries, and local
neighborhood surveys. SWCA also examined aerial photographs, Bureau of Economic Geology Maps,
and the NRCS Web Soil Survey. The TxDOT Historic Overlay was examined to identify the presence of
potential historic-age structures.
The background literature review determined that four cultural resources surveys are known to have been
conducted immediately adjacent to the proposed project area; those various investigations resulted in the
recording of one archaeological site just east of Raider Way. Additionally, a review of the TxDOT
Historic Overlay maps revealed 41 possible historic-age structures within 1 mile of the current project
area (Foster et al. 2006).
In January 2003, PBS&J conducted a survey on behalf of Leander Independent School District for the
construction of the Leander High School directly east of the proposed road expansion (Blakistone et al.
2003). Investigations resulted in the discovery of one archaeological site (41WM1065). Site 41WM1065
was a highly disturbed historic homestead recommended not eligible for designation as an SAL or for the
NRHP; the construction of Leander High School destroyed the site (Blakistone et al. 2003).
In September 2014, C Dimensions conducted a survey on behalf of Dougherty Mortgage LLC for an
apartment complex immediately west of Raider Way; that survey discovered no cultural resources (THC
2016).
In 2014, a roadway survey was conducted for TxDOT adjacent to Raider Way at the south end of the
current project area along Crystal Falls Parkway; those investigations discovered no cultural resources
(Hartnett and Peyton 2014).
The final adjacent survey occurred along the south edge of the Crystal Falls Parkway ROW, with the
project areaâs northern terminus at Raider Way; no cultural resources were discovered near the currently
proposed project area (Stahman 2007).

HISTORIC MAP REVIEW
The review of the TxDOT Historic Overlay maps revealed eight possible historic-age structures near the
project area (Foster et al. 2006). The eight structures are depicted adjacent to the existing East Woodview
Drive and Raider Way on maps dating to 1934 and 1962. No earlier maps were available; therefore, the
approximate dates of construction are unknown. SWCA also conducted a review of historic maps from
HistoricAerials.com (2016) to determine if any historic-age built resources were located within the project
area and to develop an idea of land development over time. SWCA reviewed aerial maps dated to 1962,
1985, 1996, 2004, 2008, 2010, and 2012. Of the eight structures depicted on the historic maps, four
possible historic-age structures are shown on the aerial images to be adjacent to the currently proposed
project area. On the 1962, 1985, 1996, and 2004 maps, the project area appears to have been used for a
mixture of ranching and agricultural activities with minor disturbances from land clearing and the
construction of the existing Crystal Falls Parkway and the U.S. Highway 183A (US 183A) Toll roadways.
By 2008, the large high school complex directly east of the project area had been constructed and
additional residential development and roads appear near the current project area. By 2013, large-scale
residential development began in the area with the creation of subdivisions to the west and southeast of
the project area.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY
SWCAâs investigations consisted of an intensive pedestrian survey augmented with shovel testing.
Archaeologists examined the ground surface and available erosional exposures for cultural resources.
Shovel testing was primarily used where the project crosses topography with a potential for buried sites
and when surface visibility was low. Where performed, shovel tests were systematically excavated within
the APE and additional shovel tests were required to define site boundaries. The amount of shovel tests
decreased depending on the level of previous disturbances, the nature of the soils, and the topographic
setting of the APE.
Archaeologists excavated shovel tests in 20-centimeter (cm) arbitrary levels to 1 meter (m) in depth
unless soil characteristics or bedrock precluded reaching that depth. All matrix removed from the shovel
tests was screened through Â¼-inch mesh. The location of each shovel test was plotted using a hand-held
Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver and was recorded on appropriate digital recording forms in
SWCAâs field tablets. SWCA archaeologists excavated shovel tests to the depth of project impacts, when
possible.
SWCA conducted a non-collection survey. Artifacts were tabulated, analyzed, and documented in the
field, but not collected.

SITE EVALUATIONS
All newly discovered archaeological sites found during the survey were evaluated for suitability for
official SAL designation, with reference to the criteria given in 13 Texas Administrative Code (TAC)
26.10, of the Rules of Practice and Procedure for the ACT. For official SAL designation, the
archaeological site must meet one or more of the following five distinct criteria:
1) has potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory or history of Texas;
2) contains preserved, intact archaeological deposits;
3) possesses unique or rare attributes related to Texas prehistory or history;
4) provides opportunities to test theories and methods of preservation contributing to new scientific
knowledge; and
5) is a target or likely target of vandalism or relic collecting.

RESULTS
ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY RESULTS
On October 25, 2016 and March 29, 2017, SWCA archaeologists conducted an intensive pedestrian
survey of the proposed 4,826-foot-long (0.9-mile-long) project area, including proposed ROW and the
planned deceleration lane area along the US 183A northbound frontage road (Figure 3). Field
investigations encountered a highly disturbed environment throughout the majority of the project area
impacted by multiple surface and buried utilities. The vegetation consists of dense juniper forest in
undisturbed areas in the northern end of the project area, and short grasses and/or manicured landscaping
in disturbed areas in the southern end of the project area (Figures 4 and 5). Ground surface visibility
throughout the survey area ranged between 10 to 85 percent, and averaged approximately 60 percent.

The northern terminus of the project area is at the intersection of the US 183A northbound frontage road.
The Leander Flea Market is to the north of the East Woodview Drive, as are the Life Church and
associated parking lots, fences, and landscaping. A large subdivision was actively being constructed when
the survey was conducted; this subdivision is north of East Woodview Drive and parallels the APE for
806 feet. This neighborhood is enclosed by a 6-foot-tall wood privacy fence. This segment of the project
area has been impacted by land clearing and the construction of the existing roadway and an asphalt
driveway for the residence just north of the project alignment, as well as a sidewalk paralleling the
northern edge of the existing roadway (see Figure 5). The southwest quadrant of the Raider Way/East
Woodview Drive intersection is undeveloped and supports a dense juniper forest, as well as an occupied
residential structure with an associated gravel driveway.
Moving east from US 183A, the project area trends south along Raider Way that is bordered by a buried
fiber optic cable and gas pipeline. The east site of Raiderâs Way is dominated by the sprawling Rouse
High School campus and has been cleared and paved over in many areas. Six asphalt driveways
associated with the school intersect the project area. Four houses are situated west of the project, each
with an associated intersecting driveways. The Central Leander Church is west of Raider Way. Asphalt
driveways associated with this church also intersect the project alignment. The southern terminus of the
project area is a large gravel parking lot and Raider Way/East Crystal Falls Parkway intersection.

Surface investigations within the project area revealed common exposed bedrock as well as limestone
cobbles and boulders (Figure 6). Given the presence of existing surface and subsurface utilities along
much of Raider Way and East Woodview Drive, shovel testing was anticipated to be minimal, except for
the undeveloped wooded parcel in the southwest quadrant of the Raider Way/East Woodview Drive
intersection. Subsurface investigations included the excavation of 37 shovel tests (MR01â MR14 and
BM01â BM20) (Table 1; Figure 3). The THC/CTA standards require 16 shovel tests per mile, per 100
feet of ROW width for linear surveys. For a linear project of this size (120 feet wide by 0.9 mile long) a
minimum of 15 shovel tests is recommended. The 37 shovel tests excavated for the project exceeds the
recommended number of tests. Shovel testing typically revealed dense silty clay or sandy clay loam from
0 to 10 cm below surface (cmbs) overlying limestone bedrock. All shovel tests were negative for cultural
materials. Although all subsurface investigations were negative, surface examinations resulted in the
discovery of historic site 41WM1354.

SITE 41WM1354
Site 41WM1354 consists of two mobile home foundations (Features H1 and H2) with an associated
historic/modern refuse scatter (Figures 7â9; see Figure 3). The site boundary was determined to be
approximately 80 feet north/south by 75 feet east/west within the project area (see Figure 7); however, the
site extends an unknown distance east and south of the project boundaries. SWCA archaeologists
discovered the site within the wooded parcel in the southwest quadrant of the Raider Way/East
Woodview Drive intersection. The site is in generally level uplands with exposed bedrock outcrops, and
limestone cobbles and gravels on the ground surface throughout the site area. Ground surface visibility at
the time of investigations was approximately 30 to 40 percent.
The surface scatter of historic/modern debris consists of clear window glass, sanitary seam cans, wire cute
nails, clear bottle glass, sheets of corrugated metal, and pull tab aluminum cans within a dense juniper
stand. Given the type of artifacts, site occupation appears to have occurred during the late 1960s through
the 1970s, though later use of the site area for unknown purposes may have occurred subsequent to the
removal of the mobile homes and/or trailers.

Subsurface investigations of site 41WM1354 involved the excavation of six shovel tests (BM06â BM11),
all of which were negative for cultural materials (see Table 1). Site delineation resulted from identifying
the extent of the surface scatter within the project area. The site was also associated with a depression in
the ground surface (Feature H3) that was covered by corrugated aluminum (Figure 10). The depression is
approximately 3 feet in depth and 3 feet in diameter. No cultural material was found within the
depression. The site dates to at least 1962, when a structure first appears on the historic topographic maps
(USGS 2016).
Based on the shallow upland soils with frequent exposures of bedrock, the ubiquitous nature of the
observed artifact assemblage, and a lack of buried cultural materials, it is SWCAâs opinion that site
41WM1354 has no potential to contain intact, deeply buried cultural deposits warranting SAL
designation. Given this data, SWCA recommends that site 41WM1354 is not eligible for designation as
an SAL, due to the inability to provide new or important data concerning regional history. Accordingly,
no further work is recommended. However, the parts of the site that extend to the south, beyond the APE,
could not be evaluated and have undetermined eligibility for the NRHP or for designation as an SAL.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
At the request of Walker Partners, and on behalf of the City of Leander, SWCA conducted an intensive
cultural resources survey of proposed improvements to approximately 4,826 feet of Raider Way and East
Woodview Drive and a 660-foot long planned deceleration lane along the existing US 183A northbound
frontage road. The work was conducted as part of the sponsorâs compliance with the ACT (Permit No.
7812).
Investigations included a background review and an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel testing of the
project area boundaries. The background review determined that four cultural resources surveys are
known to have been conducted in close proximity to the proposed project area; those various
investigations resulted in the recording of one archaeological site (41WM1065) just east of Raider Way.

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey
of Proposed Improvements to Raider Way and East Woodview Drive

Site 41WM1065 was a highly disturbed historic homestead recommended not eligible for designation as
an SAL; the construction of Rouse High School destroyed the site (Blakistone et al. 2003). Additionally, a
review of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Historic Overlay maps revealed eight
possible historic-age structures near the project area.
Overall, the intensive pedestrian survey revealed that the proposed project area is largely developed.
Rouse High School, two church complexes, five inhabited houses, one housing development, and one flea
market intersect the project area. Exposed bedrock, limestone cobbles and boulders, and degraded
fragments of limestone bedrock were frequently observed on the ground surface throughout the APE.
Disturbances include existing roadway (e.g., the proposed deceleration lane within existing US 183A
ROW along the existing shoulder), one existing pipeline corridor, and one buried fiber optic cable. The
subsurface investigations consisted of 37 shovel tests and an extensive examination of the ground surface
and erosional profiles and exposures for cultural resources. During these investigations, SWCA
discovered and documented previously unrecorded historic archaeological site 41WM1354.
Site 41WM1354 consists of two mobile home foundations and an associated surface scatter of clear
window glass, sanitary seam cans, wire cut nails, clear bottle glass, sheets of corrugated metal, and pull
tab aluminum cans. Based on the shallow upland soils and frequent exposures of bedrock, site
41WM1354 has no potential to contain intact, deeply buried cultural deposits. The site dates to
approximately 1962, when the structure first appears on historic topographic maps. SWCA recommends
that the parts of the site within the current project area do not warrant designation as an SAL; the
remainder of the site outside of the project area is of undetermined eligibility. Based on these data, no
further cultural resources investigation or avoidance is recommended for the parts of site 41WM1354
within the current project area. However, should the proposed project design change and require impacts
to parts of 41WM1354 outside the current project area, those areas would require additional survey.
SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify cultural resources properties within the
Raider Way and East Woodview Drive project area. As no properties were identified that may meet the
criteria for designation as an SAL, as per 13 TAC 26.10, SWCA recommends that no further cultural
resources investigations are warranted.
