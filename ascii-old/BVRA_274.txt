ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey for the proposed Lakeway road was conducted by
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) on August 27 and 28, 2015. The Area of
Potential Effect (APE) traverses cross-country and crosses Lick Creek and Spring
Creek. The survey consisted of a surface inspection and shovel testing and probing.
Parts of the APE are wooded with a dense understory that made digging shovel tests in
areas free of roots virtually impossible. The pre-survey research found that there are no
previously recorded sites in the APE and that the area had not been examined at any
time by a professional archaeologist. No prehistoric or historic sites were identified and
recorded and no artifacts were collected. It is recommended that the City of College
Station be allowed to proceed with construction as planned. Copies of the final report
are on file at the Texas Historical Commission (THC); Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL), Texas State Library, CME Testing and Engineering, Inc., BVRA, the
City of College Station, and various libraries and repositories as required by the
antiquities permit. The APE is 25.3 acres in size. The Antiquities Permit issued for this
project is 7396.

INTRODUCTION
BVRA was hired by CME Testing and Engineering, Inc. to conduct a Phase I
cultural resources survey for the proposed Lakeway Drive Extension Project in central
Brazos County (Figure 1). This construction is part of the City of College Station’s
“Roadway Thoroughfare Plan.” The purpose of this construction is to extend Lakeway
Drive from its current termination point at Spring Creek near William D. Fitch Parkway to
the campus of the Scott & White Hospital near Rock Prairie Road in College Station, a
distance of 8200 feet. The width of the road will be 100 feet plus a right-of-way of 125
feet. At the two stream crossings, the right-of-way will be 200 feet to allow for
movement of the road if needed. A secondary road, Pebble Creek Parkway, will also be
constructed from the main alignment of Lakeway Drive to the existing service road of
State Highway 6 immediately south of the property known as Christ United Methodist
Church. The length of this road will be 1380 feet and the width (including right-of-way)
will be 125 feet. The proposed Lakeway Drive alignment will cross two streams, namely
Spring Creek in the southern portion of the alignment and Lick Creek in the central
portion of the alignment.
Based on an examination of the project area as depicted on the topographic
map, the soil survey for Brazos County, and a conversation with other archaeologists,
the APE was considered to be a low to medium probability area in terms of containing
significant prehistoric and/or historic sites. Figure 2 depicts the APE on the United
States Geological Survey 7.5’ Wellborn topographic quadrangle (3096-422). The APE
is depicted on an aerial photograph dated October 3, 2014 (Figure 3).

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is located within the West Gulf Coastal Plain section of the
Coastal Plain physiographic province as defined by Fenneman (1938:100-120). This
physiographic section is subdivided according to the age of the geological formations
(Gulf series) that roughly parallel the Texas coastline. The area is hilly and situated
within the East Texas timber belt. Gould (1969) describes it as an area characterized
by gently rolling to hilly topography with light colored soils that are acidic sandy loams or
sands. The climate is sub-humid to humid, and the weather is considered to be
predominately warm. Annual rainfall for Brazos County is 39.21 inches. A January
minimum temperature of 42 degrees F. and a July maximum temperature of 95 degrees
F. combine to produce a growing season of 274 days (Kingston and Harris 1983:180).
The altitude above mean sea level in the county varies from 200-400 feet. In the project
area, the altitude exceeds 300 ft. above mean sea level.
According to the soil survey for Brazos County (Chervenka 2003:Sheet 37), there
are several specific soils in the project area. Along the creeks, the soils are described
as Sandow loam, frequently flooded (Chervenka 2003:75). This soil is found in
floodplains and along streams. It is a deep, moderately well drained soil that has a
perched water table at 3.5 ft. to 6.0 ft. Slightly acid sandy loam can be present from the
surface to a depth of 80 in. The soils that are present in the rest of the project area are
described as Booneville fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes (BoA); Tabor fine sandy
loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes (TaA); Tabor-Urban land complex, 0 to 2 percent slopes
(TuA); Ustarents clay (Us); and Zulch fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes (Zub).

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to the Office of the State Archeologist, Brazos County is located in the
Southeastern Region of Texas (Figure 4). A check of the site records at TARL and the
Texas Archeological Sites Atlas revealed that there are no recorded sites in the
proposed project area and a professional archaeologist has not examined any portion of
the APE. Prehistoric sites in this area are typically found on sandy ridges and uplands
in close proximity to dependable sources of water such as creeks and rivers. Few
prehistoric sites have been recorded along minor tributaries and intermittent streams.
Surface finds of projectile points believed to be associated with the Paleoindian
period have been found in the county but no sites dating to that period have been
documented. Perhaps the most significant locality in Brazos County where artifacts
dating to this period have been found is the Thurmond site (41BZ73) where numerous
Paleoindian points have been reported by collectors. Harry J. Shafer (1977) describes
this site in Paleoindian Lifeways. Thoms (1993b:29) states that this period lasted in
Brazos County from circa 11,200 Before Present (B.P.) to about 8000 B.P.
There is more evidence for the presence of Archaic components at sites in
Brazos County but no pure sites of that period are known. One site (41BZ132)
containing an Archaic projectile point and burned rock was found during a previous
survey of the Traditions Golf Course (Moore 2000) but additional work is needed to
determine if this is a pure Archaic site. According to Thoms (1993b:29), the Archaic
(Early, Middle, Late, and Transitional) in Brazos County existed from circa 8000 B.P. to
about 1300 B.P. Site types include temporary and more permanent camps as
evidenced by the presence of chipped stone debitage and tools and features associated
with fire-cracked rock. Hunting and gathering of wild plants are believed to have been
the major source of food during this time. Evidence of hunting game exists in the
numerous projectile point types found at Archaic sites or multi-component sites with an
Archaic component and food processing involving freshwater mussels has been
documented at two sites on the Brazos River (Thoms 1993b:29).
Late Prehistoric sites are by far the most numerous and have been documented
throughout the county. Prehistoric burials have been found at sites in adjacent counties
such as 41BU16 and 41BU17 in Burleson County and eroding from the Brazos River,
but no burials have been reported at sites in Brazos County. According to Thoms
(1993b:29), the Late Prehistoric lasted from circa 1300 B.P. to about 300 B.P. It was
during that period that projectile points were made for use with the bow and ceramics
first made an appearance. Cooking was evident at 41BZ110 and 41BZ111 where
quartzite fire-cracked rocks were found and believed to have been associated with
boiling water. Bison, deer, rabbits, turtle, fish, and mussels are some of the faunal
species that are known to have been exploited by the indigenous groups.

The largest survey conducted in the county was by BVRA when a survey of 945
acres set aside for a golf course and country club was examined in 2001 (Moore 2001).
The major source of water in the area is Turkey Creek and its minor tributaries. This
project recorded a prehistoric site with a historic component (41BZ131) and three
prehistoric sites (41BZ132-41BZ134). The only prehistoric site with diagnostic artifacts
was 41BZ132. At this site, a dart point classified as Carrollton was recovered along
with numerous flakes and burned rock. The THC made the decision that this site was
not significant.
Archaeologists from SWCA, Inc. (Drake 2000) investigated 285 acres along
Spring Creek and found no sites. The entire project area was 735 acres but SWCA only
examined 250 feet on either side of the drainage. Earlier, I visited an area adjacent to
the SWCA project area where a local collector reported finding projectile points. At the
time of my visit, it consisted of a badly eroded and disturbed hill overlooking a former
channel of Spring Creek about 200 m to the west. I saw numerous flakes and recorded
the site at TARL as 41BZ173.
The site of the Bush Presidential Library Center was examined by Archaeology
Consultants, Inc. (Moore and Warren 1993). Archaeologists from the Texas A&M
Archaeological Research Laboratory conducted surveys for the Brazos Valley Slopes
Project (Thoms 1993a), Veterans Park and Lick Creek Park (Dering and Mason 2001),
and the White Creek Archaeological Project (Thoms 1993b). Numerous small area
projects with negative results have been carried out by archaeologists in the county.
BVRA (Moore 2013) conducted an archaeological assessment of the Proposed Great
Oaks Phase III Large Lot Development Project and determined that the area to be
affected was not likely to contain significant cultural resources.
The survey for the proposed Lick Creek Park recorded four prehistoric sites
identified as lithic procurement sites and initial reduction areas. They are 41BZ141,
41BZ144, 41BZ145, and 41BZ146. They were identified as such because of debitage
on the surface and natural outcrops of sandstone. I visited two of these sites and found
only gravels that had been brought in for the construction of a pipeline.
Historic sites are not always tied to water and can consist of standing structures
dating to the 19th and 20th centuries and isolated features associated with farming and
ranching such as cisterns, wells, and outbuildings. In certain areas historic bridges and
cemeteries are present. One major historic site is the Richard Carter house site
(41BZ74) that dates to the 19th century. Shawn Bonath Carlson (1983, 1987)
investigated it while employed by the Archeological Research Laboratory at Texas A&M
University. This site represents the earliest historic settlement in the county at circa
1831. Two early log structures have been reported in the county. One is an early cabin
(41BZ93) and the other is a log crib or cabin (41BZ89) that has been destroyed. The
town of Boonville (41BZ91), including Boonville Cemetery, was the first county seat of
Brazos County and was established in 1841 (Webb 1952:188).

METHODS
Prior to the commencement of the field survey, the Texas Historic Sites Atlas and
site files at TARL were checked for previously recorded sites and surveys in the project
area and vicinity. Relevant contract reports documenting work in the immediate area
were reviewed in order to be aware of the kinds of sites that are most likely to be found
in the APE and the types of topographic settings where they typically occur. The project
area was examined through a surface inspection and shovel testing. M. Frederick
Conlin, Jr., P.E. represented CME Testing and Engineering, Inc. and he accompanied
the Project Archaeologist to the project area and answered his questions about
easements and how to navigate through the area and stay on course. The stream
crossings are discussed individually in the Results and Conclusions section of this
report.
The APE was investigated with shovel tests and probes and visually when testing
was not possible. Shovel tests were dug on each bank of the two crossings and along
the footprint of the proposed road at intervals of 100 meters when possible. In all, 39
tests were excavated. The approximate location of the tests is depicted in Figure 2.
Each test was approximately 30-50 cm in diameter and they were terminated when the
B Horizon or a natural obstacle such as clay or standing water was encountered. The
excavated soil was screened using ¼ inch hardware cloth. Shovel test data were
recorded on a shovel test log (Appendix I) and the project area was further documented
with a field journal and digital photography. The field journal (Appendix II) provides a
more detailed description of the methods employed. A sample of the photographs can
be found in Appendix III.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Examination of the files at TARL and the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
revealed that no professional archaeologists have surveyed the area and no known
sites are present. The APE was adequately covered and no cultural materials were
observed. The survey began at the southern end where the new road will connect with
the existing segment of Lakeway Drive. The first shovel test was dug about 50 m from
the beginning point to a depth of 34 cm through loam.
About 100 m from the first test, APE crosses Spring Creek. At this crossing,
Spring Creek was estimated to be about 4 m wide and 2.5 m deep. The substrate is
believed to be sandy, loamy clay with hematitic limestone gravels and cobbles. The
southern bank drops off rather sharply to the water below but the northern bank is more
of a gentle slope where sandstone bedrock was exposed on the surface (Appendix III:
930). Three shovel tests were dug on the south bank of the creek through loamy soil to
clay at depths of 66 cm to 72 cm. Three tests were dug on the north bank and they
encountered bedrock at depths of 20 cm to 68 cm. The area on both sides of the creek
was thickly vegetated with a mixed stand of oak, hackberry, mesquite, and elm trees.
The understory consisted of numerous vines, cactus and various grasses. In this area,
there was a possibility that the location of the new road could vary 200 ft. on either side.
Therefore, tests 3 and 4 were dug in these expanded areas.
The terrain between Spring Creek and Lick Creek is described in this report as
level and savannah-like. Ground visibility was never greater than 5%, but eye-height
visibility was excellent in the areas next to two-track roads (Appendix III: Photo 920).
Sagebrush and bunch grass were the two most dominant grasses in this area. Nine
shovel tests were dug along this segment and terminated at depths of 19 cm to 41 cm.
The next phase of the field survey was the investigation of both banks of Lick
Creek. At the time of this survey, the creek contained clear water flowing over a loamy
clay substrate at an estimated depth of one meter (Appendix III: Photo 915). Shovel
tests 18-20 were dug on the south bank of the creek in loamy soil containing sand to
depths of 35 cm to 97 cm. Tests 21-23 were dug on the north bank through loamy soil
to depths of 61 cm to 69 cm.
After leaving Lick Creek, the remaining area of approximately 400 m the terrain
was savannah-like. Twelve tests (24-35) were dug in this area in a formerly plowed
field, a field that had once been terraced, and a dirt two-track road. These tests were
dug through fine loam and fine sandy loam to depths of 32 cm to 41 cm. This part of
the APE ends at the intersection of the proposed road and the existing section of
Lakeway Drive.
The last area to be examined was 425 m of proposed road that will connect State
Highway 6 with the new road. The remaining tests (26-39) were dug in this area
through loamy clay and quartzite gravels to depths of 30 cm to 43 cm.

There can be many reasons why one or more prehistoric sites are not present in
a particular area. Some of the more common ones are an absence of dependable
water that would support even a temporary camp, clay soils at the surface that would
not allow for water to permeate the soil following rains. The latter would make the
surface not conducive for a living area. Some prehistoric sites do not depend on either
of these factors and they exist because of natural resources such as plants and animals
needed for food or exposed raw materials such as clay for making pottery or cobbles
that can be used for making stone tools. The two creeks probably were sources of
water in the prehistoric past; therefore, other factors must have contributed to an
absence of a prehistoric site. No raw materials suitable for the manufacture of stone
tools were observed. It is my conclusion that those parts of the APE at the stream
crossings could have been utilized by aboriginal groups but their activities left little or no
evidence of their presence. Probable activities would have been gathering of wild
plants for food, exploitation of riverine resources in the streams, and/or limited stays of
only a few days.

11

RECOMMENDATIONS
No previously unrecorded sites were found in the project area. Therefore, it is
recommended that the City of College Station be allowed to proceed with construction
as planned. It is always possible that archaeological sites are missed during any
cultural resources survey. Should areas containing prehistoric or historic artifacts not
discussed in this report be discovered during construction, the THC must be notified
immediately and all work stopped in the area of concern until it can be determined if
additional work is necessary.

LAKEVIEW DRIVE ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEY FIELD NOTES
COLLEGE STATION, TEXAS (AUGUST 27-28, 2015)
BY JESSE TODD
The Study Area
The terrain rises at a gentle slope to the northwest from W. D. Fitch Parkway.
The terrain dips southeast and northwest at Lick Creek and a small valley is formed.
From the existing Lakeway Drive northwest of Fitch Parkway to just northwest of Lick
Creek, the terrain is generally level. However; the terrain undulates from northwest of
Lick Creek to the hospital. Ground visibility was never greater than 5% and eye-height
visibility was excellent in the areas adjacent to dirt roads (Photos 920 and 931) and
gravel two-track roads (Photo 937) to about a meter through the remainder of the study
area.
Ever present perennial understory included saw greenbriar, berry vines, prickly
pear cactus, sage, grama grasses, bunch grass, black-eyed susans, hog brush, grape
vine, johnson and bermuda grasses, and other miscellaneous perennials. Berry vines
basically were present and dominated the vegetation regime northwest of Lick Creek in
the once plowed fields (Photo 919). Prickly pear cactus was found only in the short
northeast-southwest oriented roadway adjacent to Christ United Methodist Church.
Sagebrush was present in the savannah-like area between Lick Creek and the former
fields as well as northwest of Spring Creek. Bunch grass dominated the vegetation
northwest of Creagor Road for about 150 meters before the savannah-like environment
reappeared.
The savannah-like environment (Photo 918) existed mainly from Spring Creek to
Creagor Road in a northwest direction, from about 150 m northwest of Creagor Road to
approximately 400 m northwest of Lick Creek, and along the short northeast-southwest
segment of roadway. Forested areas from 12 to 15 m wide (Photos 916, 917, and 942)
were present on both sides of Lick Creek. If a path had not been cut through the trees, it
is doubtful that the archeologist could have reached the creek. Trees within the forested
area and in the savannah-like areas include oaks, hackberry, mesquite, elm, wingedelm, and possibly hawthorn.
Spring Creek and Lick Creek are present along the proposed roadway. Spring
Creek is approximately 4 m wide and 2.5 m deep. At the main crossing, the water is
black (Photo 926) and unknown depth. The substrate is probably sandy, loamy clay with
hematitic and limestone gravel and cobbles. An examination of the creek discovered
that the water depth ranged from 0.25 m to the previously mentioned unknown depth.
The water was flowing. Within the northwest bank of the creek appear laminated
limestone layers (Photo 927). The southeast bank is in the form of a sharp drop-off, but
the northwest bank is eroding at a slope where the limestone bedrock is exposed on the
ground surface (Photo 930).

Lakeview Drive Field Notes (Page 2)
Lick Creek is approximately 4 m wide and 3 m deep. Clear water is flowing over
a loamy clay substrate. The water is about 1 m deep (Photos 915 and 943).
Disturbance along the APE includes a sewer line located about 40 m from the
end of Lakeview Drive northwest of Fitch Parkway (Photo 925) and some form of
electrical or other mechanical outlet northeast of Highway 6 (Photo 924). The proposed
roadway will cross an electrical line southeast and close to Lick Creek (Photo 941).
About 600 to 700 m southeast of Lakeview Drive at the hospital to Shovel Test 29, the
land has been terrace (Photo 921). The terrace is about 1 m high, probably deflated due
to erosion and is about 0.5 m wide. Plowing over the years has occurred about 400 to
500 m southwest of the terraced area.
The Survey *
The survey began northwest of Fitch Parkway and went to the northwest. The
first shovel test was placed about 50 m from the existing Lakeview Drive. Shovel Test 2
was dug within the main roadway right-of-way (ROW) on the southeast bank of Spring
Creek, but since the land owner decided that he might vary the location about 200 ft. on
each side of the main ROW, approximately 200 ft. were examined northwest and
southeast of the main ROW, and shovel tests 3 and 4 were excavated within these
areas. Shovel Test 5 was dug within the main ROW and shovel tests 6 and 7 were dug
within 200 ft. (~67 m) for the previous reason. Shovel Test 5 was placed about 12 m
from the northwest bank of Spring Creek due to sandstone bedrock on the ground
surface and the slope of the land.
The proposed roadway parallels an existing two-track dirt road northwest from
Spring Creek. However, the proposed road had moved to northeast of a fence and
between the fence and a forested area within 100 m within the proposed road. The
proposed road continued within this forested/savannah area for approximately 300 m
before intersecting with Creagor Road. Shovel Test 11 was placed just northwest of
Creagor Road and encountered very shallow bedrock.
Shovel tests 12-14 were placed in savannah/field environments until a tributary
road that departed from Creagor Road and ran to an electrical substation was
encountered. The proposed road will parallel an existing gravel two-track road, and it
will run southwest of the existing gravel road. A portion of the landscape appears to
have been removed prior to the construction of the gravel road. Shovel Test 15 was
placed within this area.

Lakeview Drive Field Notes (Page 3)
Shovel Test 16 was excavated in sandy loam prior to encountering the electrical
substation, whereas Shovel Test 17 was placed southwest of and about in the middle of
the area adjacent to the electrical substation. This area previously was surveyed by
Hicks and Company. Piled logs from the construction of the plan and forested areas
were present northwest and southeast of Shovel Test 17. The forested area continued
northwest to Lick Creek.
As previously mentioned, the proposed road will run beneath the electrical lines.
About midway (~8 m) to the southeast bank of Lick Creek where several logs had been
placed in a pile. Whether this was by accident or intentional is not known. Shovel tests
18 and 21 were placed within the ROW on the southeast and northwest banks of Lick
Creek, respectively. Shovel tests 19 and 20 were placed northwest and southeast of
Shovel Test 18 on the southeast bank, and shovel tests 22 and 23 were placed
northwest and southeast of Shovel Test 18 on the northwest bank, per the landowner’s
request.
Approximately 400 m northwest of Lick Creek the landscape was savannah, and
shovel tests 24 through 26 were excavated in that environment. Shovel tests 27-29
were placed in a once-plowed field, and shovel tests 30-34 were placed in a field that
once had been terraced. Shovel tests 27-31 were placed adjacent to two-track dirt road,
which the proposed roadway paralleled on the northeast side. The proposed roadway
turns and runs for approximately 100 m to the northwest toward the existing Lakeview
Drive adjacent to the Scott and White Hospital where the archeological survey of the
main roadway terminated.
The Pebble Creek Parkway will be constructed from SH 6. The client’s portion of
this proposed roadway runs from SH 6 for approximately 425 m where it terminates at
the Lakeview Drive roadway. The proposed roadway is southeast of and adjacent to
Christ United Methodist Church. Shovel tests 36-39 were placed along this northeastsouthwest oriented roadway. The shovel tests encountered small quartzite gravels, and
that was the only area where these gravels were encountered during subsurface
testing. The intensive pedestrian archeological survey was terminated at this point.

* All shovel tests were negative. See the shovel test log for more detailed
information and Figure 2 for approximate locations of the tests.
