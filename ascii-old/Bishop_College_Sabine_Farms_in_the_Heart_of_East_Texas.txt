Sabine Farms Community Center
The potentialities of "Sabine Farms" as a rural life movement among Negroes are
reflected in the numerous programs and services that are conducted at the Community
Center, and in the various community organizations that give them direction.

ice, farm and home improvement activities, a co-operative. for marketing saleable vegetables and other farm produce, a co-operative store, organized recreation, community
fairs and celebrations, college ,! workshops, a community Sunday school, religious serv. ..
ices, the public school for that district, etc.
.·•

The facilities at the Center consist of a twenty acre woode.{i, campits fronting the

Hornemaking Education
Homemaki ng and Agriculture are relctted in the Sabine Farms program on the
true-to-life basis on which they function_as integrated activities in the life of the rural
family . Home-life in the Sabine Farms community provides (a) a laboratoq for the
training of college women in the science and art of _homemaking comparable with the
importance of the seventy-five farms to the colleges agricultural program, and ( b) an
unexcelled opportunity for community service.
Homemaking at Bishop College is unlike any other program o-f i~s kind in "Negro
education," in that it offers a required laboratory course in home management to every
woman student enrolled in the college, as a prerequisite to graduation. Two practice
houses, which operate on a twelve month basis, provide, as nearly as possible, true-tolif e experiences for that course.
A four-year, combination, degree course in Foods, Clothing, Child Care and related
subjects is offered for majors in Homemaking Education.

George Washington Carver

Research Laboratory
I

The Board of Truste~s of Bishop College has authorized the establishment of a
research laboratory at Sabine Farms, dedicated to the type of service for East Texas that
was rendered the South and the Nation by George V\Tashington Carver.
The research program will seek (a) to assist in the preparation of an inventory of
the resources of E ast Texas, (b) to assist in the development of techniques by which
those resources may be developed and conserved for the well-being of our entire population, and ( c) to assist in the creation of incentives and opportunities in East T exas, for
potential Carvers to d iscover, develop, and invest their abilities and powers.

Bishop College students learn by actual experience that investments of intelligence
and industry in East Texas land pay gratifying dividends.

Sabine Farms
Sabine Parms consist of a community of seventy-five Negro farm-families, seventy-five family-size farms, a well developed rural community center, a program of agri-:uJ rural and homemaking education, and a full schedule of co-operative college-community activities. This unique rural life laboratory is l ocated south of Marshall in the vicini r~· of the Sabine River - in the hear t of the East T exas area, where approximately
90 1/c. of the state's Negro population reside. The "project" was developed ten year.s
ago by the Farm Security Administration. The farms consist of 12,00Q acres of typical East Texas far m land; and the community center represents an investment of
$60,000.00 in buildings, equipment, and modern facilities for electric lights, runrnng
water, and sanitation.
Bishop College shares, equally, the ownership of the center, with the seventy-five
Negro farm-families; and is an indispensable, but unofficial party to the business arrangement by which the families are becoming the owners of the farms they occupy. The
two corporations, namely, Bishop College and the Sabine Farms Educational Society,
Inc., are working together as co-operating equals, and share the responsibility of directing the over-all community program.
The rich natural and human resources of Sabine Farms are available to Bishop College (a) to assist in raising the standards of living in the community, and (b) to give
practical emphasis to ·educational processes in the institution.

True-to-life on-farm-training is provided for Bishop's agricult.u ral students because
indust~ious, Christian fa~m-family, on. a farm adequate
for its size, is
a well inteo-rated
b
}
.
the greatest man-building laboratory on earth.

Negro is the major source of fhe section's farm labor supply. However, less than 3%
of the· Negro scholastics in the .' area receive even the most. elementary instruction in Agriculture." Too, Bishop is the only college in the East Texas Area that is-.facing that issue
-that is addressing its program of ·instruction and community seuvice tci' the problems of

_At first glance,. time appears to have overlooked a ruslic loghewn forl on U.S .. Rwy; 59·:s-0uth of Marshall.
Curious motorists .frequently stop to inquire about the history
· of the· 18 structures nestled in a groye of pine and oak.
The ornate-~ooking buildings which· look like a fort and town
of early Tex~ history are, strangely enough. a government
project of the 20th eentury.
Constructed during the Franklin D. Roosevelt Administration
as a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) project, the PanolaHarrison Fam1ers Cooperative has served the low-income farmers of the Sabine -COmm'unity for more than a quarter of a
cen1Jury.
Following ~ts construction m 1938, the buildings were . used
as the Sabine-Bishop Farmers Cooperative for some 14 years.
According t > Herman· Crawford, acting manager of the present
coop, the faeiiity was used by the area farmers to sell cucumbers
for four or i.ive years after it was vacated by the Sabine-Bishop
unit in 1952.
Since the early 1950's, the bulldings have been utilized by
various coojleratives which serve some 200 farmers in the imi:nediate vicinity.
"T<>e1ay-,1n11r·'S11'. otllle--:18 ""bu:..IU1rrgs are being· utilized··ey lhe

"We've got a lot of plans for the buildings," Crawford says
optimistically.

Sabine Farms interviews - Alvin Davis, 75, of Board Feny Road, Harrison County
Interview by Gail K Beil, August 29, 2002
Alvin Davis said he moved from Panola County, where his parents, Lee Jim
and Magnolia Davie were sharecroppers, to Southern Harrison County, where they
moved into a place with 150 acres, a house, barn, chicken house, well and privy.
"When we got there, the house was already there, someone else had lived
there. I don't know what happened to them."
"They [the Relocation Federation] made it possible for us to make it as
fanners. We got a team of mules, a wagon, milk cows, hogs and provision for
chickens."
Mr. Davis said some farmers got more land, some got less than his parents
acreage. Some of, he said, had so much timber on it that the farmers were able to
pay or their land when it was cut.
He also said no one had ever asked him if white farmers were involved, but
that he didn't think so, He, too, had often heard his mother say that she told her
husband that if they didn't go to Harrison County, they would never have the
chance to own their own land and that if he didn't want to go, she would take the
children and go by themselves.
Later his brothers were members of the Future Farmers Assn. (FHA) through
"colored" Harrison County Agent R.L.(?) Roland, then colored County Agent LU
Mason. (He is still living in Marshall) Mr. Davis said his brother had hog projects.

Sabine Farms
left its mark on
Harmon County
By LESLIE BAILEY
News Messenger

Crumbling buildings and the scattered descendants
of sharecroppers are all that remain now of what one
researcher called "America's only land reform experiment of the 20th century."
The researcher is Jess Gilbert, professor of rural
sociology at the University of Wisconsin, and the "land
reform experiment" is Har.rison County's Sabine
Farms.
Gilbert and research assistant Spencer Wood were
in Harrison County Friday to visit what remains of
Sabine Farms and interview descendants of original
land owners.
Wood is writing his dissertation on a similar farming community in Mileston, Miss.
Gilbert has researched planned communities and
the government agency that oversaw them for nearly
15 years. The communities, created "to help turn sharecroppers into land owners," were part of Franklin D.
Roosevelt's New Deal reforms, he said.
The communities were overseen by the Resettlement
Administration. In 1935, FDR created the RA by executive order. The agency was independent of the Depart~
ment of Agriculture, which was dominated by conservative politics at the time, Gilbert said.
The RA was quite the opposite of conservative. "It
was a very progressive, wonderful, radical, liberal
agency," he said. It was headed by the equally progressive Rexford G. Tugwell, who also served as the

undersecretary of agriculture.
Gilbert called Tugwell a "big
thinker" whose radical ideas
included giving penniless
sharecroppers a chance to
own their land.
Plantation owners, also
cash-strapped due to the
Depression, were happy to sell
land to the government. The
land was.then parceled out to
program participants.
Sabine Farms was created
in 1937. There are 100 such
planned communities scattered across the country, but
only 12 or so targeted African
American farmers in the rural
South. SabiD.e Farms was one

of those communities, and the
only one of its kind in the
state. Dr. M.W. Dogan, then
president of Wiley College,
was an instrumental supporter of Sabine Farms, as was
Bishop R.E. Jones of the Meth·
odist Episcopal Church.
The community consisted of
12,000 acres divided into 120
homesites. On each plot, the
federal government built a
barn, a poultry house, a hoghouse, a purnphouse and a
privy. Many of the original
Sabine Farms homes are still
standing.

farmer's market, a canning
building and a school, was
functional until the 1970s, said
Myrtle Davis. Ms. Davis lives
with her husband Alvin on
Boards Ferry Road. Her grandfather, Alex Richardson, was
an original Sabine Farms land
owner.
Once the hub of the community, buildings like the canning center are slowly being
reclaimed by the land. Cucum·
ber vines, perhaps sprouted
from tossed~out seeds, now
grow wild around the building.
"When we moved away in
'53, it (the community center)
was still operating really

her husband moved to West
Texas to raise their children,

County in 1967.

"The important thing is the
contemporary social impact."
"Land is power," Gilbert
added. "Thomas Jefferson
knew it, Tugwell knew it. He
wanted to destroy the Southern plantation system."
Harrison County wasn't
untouched by Tugwell's progressive spirit. Although
many potential Civil Rights
leaders were too busy feeding
their families, voter registration drives were part of life in
Sabine Farms, Ms. Davis said.
"For so long we were not
able to vote," she said. "They
really encouraged us to vote, I
remember that."
Sabine Farms also significantly improved the economic
position of participants. Ms.

Juneteenth
festivities

STEVE BANDY
News Messenger

Prior to Friday, the last time a Juneteenth celebration was at Sabine
Farms Historic Site was the early
1960s.
• "This was the place to be on Juneteenth," said Lavern Williams, who
remembered attending those earlier celebrations as a teenager. "Everyone was here. They came by car,
wagon, horse, they walked - they
got here any way they could."
· On Friday, members of the Sabine
Farms Educational Society took
the first step in re-energizing tha1
tradition, staging an old-fashioned
Juneteenth gala under the trees
near what had once been the Sabine Farms assembly hall. It was
planned as a time of celebration
and reflection, according to Helen
Murray.
Juneteenth, also known as Freedom Day or Emancipation Day,
commemorates the announcement
·of the abolition of slavery in Texas
in 1865.
"This is the day African Americans learned we were free," said
Frankie Williams, 88 years old and
considered the "resident expert" on
the history of Sabine Farms.
"The slaves had -already been free
for about more than a year, but not
in Texas," she added.
' The Emancipation Proclamation
had been issued on Sept. 22, 1862,
with an effective date of Jan.. 1,
1863, but it had minimal immediate effect on most slaves' day-to-day
lives, particularly in Texas, which
was almost entirely under Confederate control.
Texas was resistant to the Eman-

cipation Proclamation, and
though slavery was very
prevalent in East Texas, it
was not as common in the
western areas of the state,
particularly the Hill Country, where most GermanAmericans were opposed
to the practice. Juneteenth
commemorates June 19,
1865~ the day Union General
Gordon Granger and 2,000
federal troops arrived in
Galveston to take possession
of the state and enforce the
emancipation of its slaves.
While Friday's activities
were planned in observance
ofthis historic event, the site
selection was no accident.
Sabine Farms was one of
about 200 "resettlement
· communities"-for displaced
farmers and laborers established by the federal government during the Great
Depression of the 1930s. It
is one of only 13 of the sites
that were designated for Af·rican Americans and is said
to be the only one for African Americans west of the
Mississippi River

was designed for 75 families to live
on 12,000 acres, with each
family working its own portion of land in cooperative
fashion.
For each family farm, the
government built a house,
barn, poultry house, hoghouse, pumphouse and
"privy."
The fields surrounded a
complex of buildings that included a community center,
.library, church, school, dormitories, mess hall, store,
medical building and other
community-oriented facilities. The large community
center - or assembly hall was built by an all-African
American Civilian Conservation Corps camp and had
room to seat 400 people.
Later facilities included a
cannery, weaving room and
smokehouse.
"I wish you could have
seen the assembly hall," Ms.
Murray said, pointing at an
~ea where a chimney and
slab were all that remained.

burned it down."
The general consensus is
that the fire that burned the
building was deliberately
set since there was no electricity, gas or utilities of any
kind going into the building
at the time of the blaze.
Ms. Murray remembered
the baseball diamond that
:~..J been located behind
the assembly hall, the water
well to one side of the hall
and the general store on the
other side.
"Over there in that building, that was the dormitory
for Bishop College students.
The caretaker lived in that
house right there and, over
here behind us is where they
used to bring the cucumbers," she said, pointing out
each weather-worn and vandalized structure.
Robert "Tubby" Cook, who
lives "right around the corner" from the site, said he
remembers the Juneteenth
celebrations there.
"Every June 19 "Ed Nero
and Arthur Fisher would
come out here and cook barbecue," Cook said. "They
were out here all night long
and I used to come over.
That went on up until the
early '60s."
·
But some activities continued at the site. ·
T.C. Williams remembered
playing baseball as a member of the.Sabine Braves "up
until 1972, '73."

In 2004, Sabine Farms was
designated a Historical Endangered site by Preservation Texas.
On Saturday, the site received a marker from the
Texas Historical Commission noting the importance
of the site to the state's rich
history.
.And members o~ the Sabme Farms Educational Society want to make sure the
site does not remain endangered as they seek funds to
begin restoqi.tion of the remaining community center
buildings at the site.
Dignitaries, friends, people who lived and worked
at Sabine Farms along with
representatives from Paul
Quinn College, the county
Historical Commission and
Harrison County Historical
Museum were on hand to unveil the marker.

"We're here to celebrate
Sabine Farms' importance
to Harrison County and East
Texas," said Jennifer Larned,
president of the Harrison
County Historical Commission. She noted the commission issues a few markers a
year and Sabine Farms site
was one that received one
this year.
.
The speaker was local historian Gail Beil, who spoke
on how the farms got started
and how it was brought to
East Texas by Wiley College
President Matthew Dogan.
"It was one of 13 sites offered to African-Americans,"
she said, noting it was the
only one west of the Mississippi. It was also free of the
politics that surrounded the
other 12 sites as it had the
support of the governor and
many others at the time.
Roy L. Edwards, who grew
up there, recalled that when
he began attending school in
1948 that was when the buses
started running to Sabine

ernment ended the project
in 1944, the Sabine Farms
property was put up for
sale. Residents formed the
Sabine Farms Educational
Society and joined with
Bishop College in Marshall
to purchase the site. Under
the guidance of the college,
the community continued to
thrive and provide residents
with much-appreciated and
well-utilized agricultural
and social resources.
"After Bishop College released its administration of
Sabine Farms during the
early 1960s, many of the
activities at the community
center slowed or ended.
Most of the buildings at the
site have now been lost. The
portions of structures that
remain serve as tangible evidence of the vibrant community once located at this
site."

there was no bus service for
students. There was a short
bus that broke down often
and some students were unable to get to school until
half the day had passed.
"We grew up here. There
was supposed to be a high
school, I have all that historical information," he said.
"Like Ms. Beil indicated for
some it was the termination
of their education but when
the buses started running,
we had a chance to get an

Education at Sabine
Farms went only to ninth
grade and Edwards said
while there were plans for
a high school at the farms
it did not receive support of
the county commission or
the congressman.

he Sabine Farm Education Society held
its Juneteenth celebration Friday in the remnants of the Sabine Farm
community, reuniting
many people who remembered the community of
old.
"There (are) lots of activities that happened
around here," said President of the Sabine Farm
Education Society Helen
l'v1urray, wistfully looking
around the remains of the
Sabine Farm community.
The community was one
of 200 projects constructed
under Franklin Delano
Roosevelt's New Deal, and
one of only 13 made for
black residents.
"It was a self-sustaining
community. It was important for farmers because
they could get everything
they needed without going
to town. And it was a cooperative, so they are all
invested."
l.'v1urray said the community once was celebrated Juneteenth for decades,
but like the New Deal
compound, it was forgot-

"These were all thrivin1

what it was like to return
to the community after

Murray said because of
the site's importance, the
Sabine Farm Education Society has worked hard to
try and save what was left,
having received a historical
marker for the site a year
ago.
But though Murray
hopes the society will be
able to revitalize the community and tear down
some of the buildings in
disrepair, she said the society will continue to hold its
annual Juneteenth celebrations here.

"We hold it here because
of the significance of it,"
Murray said. "It was a
place that was built by the
federal government. to serve
the Sabine project to build
homes for families and
sharecroppers. It was a way
of improving their lives."
June 19, called Juneteenth, commemorates the
day in 1865 when slaves in
Texas finally learned that
the war had ended and
slavery had been abolished.
The news, delivered in
Galveston by Union soldiers, came two and a half

years after President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, which
was issued in 1862 and became official Jan. l, 1863.
"It's important to continue to remember and celebrate what Juneteenth
meant to our parents and
in the community," Murray
said
"It meant people were
given a better way of life. It
was an opportunity to become homeowners,
landowners and to be self
sufficient and no longer
have to be sharecroppers."
