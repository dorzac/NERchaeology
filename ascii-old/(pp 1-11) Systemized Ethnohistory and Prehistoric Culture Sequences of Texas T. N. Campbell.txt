SYSTEMATIZED ETHNOHISTORY
AND PREHISTORIC

CULTURE SEQUENCES IN TEXAS*
T. N. CAMPBELL

ABSTRACT
Archeologists and ethnohistorians have certain limited objectives in
common,

one of which is arranging the evidence of past human

populations

in

chronological

order.

Prehistoric

archeologists construct

models known as local or regional culture sequences and are interested in
correlating, whenever possible, their latest prehistoric culture units with
ethnic groups named and described by early Europeans in written records
that have been analyzecl by ethnohistorians. Archeologists sometimes feel
handicapped because ethnohistorians do not always present their data in a
systematized form that is readily available, intelligible, and practically
useful to the archeologist.
ethnohistorians

It now

seems reasonable to advocate that

pay more attention

to the needs of archeologists and

prepare an areal series of ethnohistory handbooks that will summarize and
synthesize what is known about every historic ethnic group, large or small,
with emphasis on environmental data and ecological patterns and also on
interaction with other peoples, both native and European. Such handbooks
should not be presented in the usual authoritarian manner, but should
evaluate evidence presented and identify residual problems.

No attempt is made here to present specific ethnohistoric data on
any part of Texas or adjoining areas. This paper is essentially a brief
critical appraisal of past and current ethnohistoric studies as aids to
prehistoric archeology in the Texas area, accompanied by
suggestions as to how these ethnohistoric studies may be made more
pertinent and useful to archeologists.
Today many archeologists profess to be interested in ecological
processes of the past, particularly those in which man is involved.
These archeologists are very much aware that for any given sample
of the earth’s landscape it is essential to identify and describe
specific human population units, determine the approximate boundaries of their environmental exploitation, and then arrange these
man-land associations in chronological order. With much effort, and
perhaps with a certain amount of good fortune, it is sometimes
possible to achieve such an ordering for a relatively small section of

at the 74th Annual Meeting of the Texas Academy of Science, Nacogdoches,
Texas, March 12, 1971.

the earth’s surface. This achievement is commonly referred to as a
local cultural sequence. Unfortunately, the human groups involved
can rarely be defined with precision, and it is equally difficult to
chart their former territorial ranges. However, these difficulties do
not seem to deter archeologists, who are sustained by the hope that
greater precision and refinement will eventually emerge from continued study and that this procedure may be extended to larger and
larger portions of the earth’s surface. It is generally believed that
these sequences provide a realistic setting for study of the various
processes that operate when groups of men develop sociocultural
extensions that permit them to live acceptably in their chosen landscape arenas and maintain themselves through time.
How does the specialty known as ethnohistory relate to this
limited objective of sequence recognition and the more distant objective of defining and explaining ecological processes? As I conceive it, ethnohistory is initially a set of operations that one performs on observational data recorded in written documents to
achieve definition, description, and chronological ordering of
specific man-land associations. It involves difficult feats of information retrieval, analysis of refractory and often incomplete
data, and eventually involves cross-examination of the ordered data
to arrive at interpretive and explanatory statements about the nature
of interactions between groups of men and between these human
groups and their respective natural environments.
Although prehistoric archeologists and ethnohistorians seem to
have common objectives concerning relations between man and
nature, it is unrealistic to ignore certain differences which tend to
inhibit communication between them. Archeologists who develop
cultural sequences are accustomed to dealing with residues of
human behavior from which they must make inferences about actual behavior. Ethnohistorians, on the other hand, are accustomed to
working with verbally recorded observations of human behavior
and, despite various kinds of bias that enter written records, are
somewhat closer to the phenomena being studied. Archeologists
deal with evidence of apparently slow behavioral change over very
long periods of time, whereas ethnohist0rians are more or less
boxed-in by a short span of time determined by availability of written documents, less than 500 years in the Texas area. Furthermore,
ethnohistorians must consider behavioral changes in a context of
massive and often rapid acculturation, evasive or enforced
migration, and frequent ethnic extinctions connected with intense
competition of European and aboriginal populations for living space
and exploitable resources.

These disparities tend to reduce effective cooperation of
prehistoric archeologists and ethnohistorians to a short span of time
in any given area, namely, just before and shortly after the initial
entry of Europeans. This is dictated by the archeologist’s desire to
link his late prehistoric groups with named native groups recorded
by the earliest travelers and explorers before the native cultures
began to be extensively modified and also before post-European
population pressures induced habitat shifts. This focuses attention
on the truly aboriginal groups of any given area, meaning those who
were there before various kinds of chain reaction developed. The
ethnohistorian may be inclined to rebel against this restriction, for it
forces him to concentrate on his earliest and generally his least informative written documents. I regard this as a healthy situation
because ethnohistorians, like many archeologists, are attracted to
the richer bodies of data and tend to pass quickly over obscurities. If
the ethnohistorian is to meet this specific challenge, he must put far
more effort and analytical ingenuity into study of the earlier
documents. For example, in central, southern, and western Texas
the ethnohistorian finds himself faced by the complex problem of
identifying, locating, and describing innumerable obscure Indian
groups who were later swept away by multi-directional pressures
from aggressive Apaches, Comanches, and Spaniards. In such areas
it is small wonder that the archeologist is discouraged from making
greater use of ethnohistoric data for the purpose of extending his
prehistoric sequences into the historic period. As things now stand,
in these areas the archeologist is faced by an apparently
meaningless jumble of small ethnic groups, for which there is
minimal information on geographic range, on linguistic affiliation,
and on distinctive behavior patterns. Since he can find few satisfactory statements of what ethnic unit was where, when, and how
related to other units, he cannot be expected to show much enthusiasm about tracing cultural continuities into the historic period.
He might, however, force the ethnohistorian’s hand by finding and
excavating more settlements attributable to the Apache, Comanche,
and Spanish invaders. Specialists who share an interest in certain
problems tend to expect too much from each other, but mutual prodding often gets results and eventually leads to beneficial
cooperation.
It is only fair to make clear that my views about the relationships
of ethnohistory to prehistoric archeology have developed as the
result of unorthodox behavior. As an archeologist with an interest in

4

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Texas and adjacent areas, I have recently been doing a limited
amount of ethnohistoric research. It now seems to me that archeologists who deal with late prehistoric and early historic
materials tend to make minimal and often ineffective use of
ethnohistoric data mainly because those data have not been presented in a form that can be quickly found and readily used. What archeologists really want is more systematically organized
ethnohistoric information, and with more of it organized with archeological problems in mind. Perhaps one way to inject more archeological bias into ethnohistory is for more archeologists to try
their hands at ethnohistoric research and see what emerges. The
first objection that archeologists will voice is that the professional
archeologist is likely to be no more than an amateur ethnohistorian
at best, and this is a valid objection. I must admit that my experience thus far has not always been satisfying, mainly because my
archeological training failed to prepare me for even the most
elementary ethnohistoric research. But there is nothing inherently
mysterious or difficult about ethnohistoric research, any more than
there is about archeological research. I would say that any archeologist can do his own ethnohistoric research if he really wants
to and is willing to devote enough time to it.
Some of my archeological colleagues and students have
questioned the value of further ethnohistoric studies connected with
Texas and adjoining areas in both the United States and Mexico,
particularly for the early historic period. One question has to do
with the scope of the search for ethnohistoric data. Have historians
and cultural anthropologists found most of the extant documents
that are pertinent? The answer to this is an emphatic no. Thus far
the search has been confined largely to the massive and better
known archival collections, principally those in the great documentstorage centers of Spain, France, Mexico, and the United States. Ar" chival materials in many provincial capitals and lesser administrative centers for both church and state have been only spottily searched, and relatively little attention has been paid to
specialized institutional records, such as those of old families,
Christian missions, early mining companies and landed estates that
used Indian labor, and court records that pertain to land inheritance
and sale, marriages, and various kinds of crime.
The same question is sometimes phrased in another way. Is it
possible that the search thus far has revealed most of the basic information about former native populations and that further effort
will be merely a minor, mopping-up operation? My limited ex-

SYSTEMATIZED ETHNOHISTORY

perience thus far forces me to be cautious in trying to answer this
question. For some Indian populations we will never find much information simply because they were never actually seen by any
European who put something down on paper. These populations are
known only through hearsay from other Indians. But for other
groups that were frequently observed and recorded over a considerable span of time the possibility of data recovery increases in
proportion to the number of recorded observations retrieved. It all
boils down to the fact that we will never know just how much information exists until we search. The situation is not greatly different from that faced by an archeologist who begins an excavation
program in a poorly known area. He will never know what can be
learned until he has excavated. My stance here is that the
ethnohistorian should continue his search until he is satisfied that
he has exhausted the possibilites and appears to have reached a
point of rapidly diminishing returns. To this I would add my impression that much of the ethnohistoric research thus far done in the
greater Texas area has been a cream-skimming operation. The effort
has gone primarily into finding documents with high data yield, and
I suspect that a substantial number of these may have been found.
But I also believe that there has been general neglect of low-yield
documents, whose number is phenomenal. Here, I think, lies the
greatest opportunity. It is in these low-yield documents that one often finds critical information on population size, seasonal range of
hunting and gathering groups, migrations, intergroup economic
cooperation or conflict, earliest introduction of European trade
goods, and non-linguistic evidence of linguistic affiliation. This
potential is what makes me insist that what we most need now is a
painstaking, dragnet operation through the innumerable documents
that have never been examined for isolated detail or have been
passed over as insignificant. This of course is a major undertaking,
but I see no reason for anyone to be overawed by its magnitude.
Few archeologists seem to be overwhelmed by the amount of work
that must be done before their major objectives are achieved.
An imposing mass of information has been assembled and
published on various historic Indian peoples in Texas. Much of this
can be labeled as ethnohistory in a broad sense, but the Texas area
is incompletely covered and the smaller population units rarely
receive adequate individual attention. One has only to inspect a few
special studies, such as Gatschet (1891) on the Karankawans,
Ruecking on the Coahuiltecans (1953, 1954a, 1954b, 1955a, 1955b),
Sjoberg (1953a, 1953b) on the Lipan Apaches and Tonkawas,

Newcomb and Field (1967) on the Wichita groups, and Swanton
(1942) and Griffith (1954) on the Caddoans to appreciate the wide
range of approaches to the data as well as the variety in structured
presentations. Failure to focus attention on the smaller ethnic units
through both time and space sometimes results in misunderstanding, as in the case of the Ervipiame, always identified as a
Tonkawan group linguistically and culturally. However, it is easy to
demonstrate by documents that the Ervipiame migrated shortly after
1700 from northeastern Coahuila and vicinity to east-central Texas
and there became associated with Tonkawan groups. They seem to
represent assimilation of a Coahuiltecan group in a new social setting.
The first serious attempt to present ethnohistoric information on
all the known groups in Texas was connected with the preparation
of the Handbook of American Indians, edited by F. W. Hodge and
published between 1907 and 1910. Basically this is an encyclopedia,
consisting of a series of summarizing essays, one for each known
Indian group, arranged in alphabetic sequence by name. These
essays were written by the best qualified individuals of the time,
and the dominant contributor for the Texas area was an historian,
H. E. Bolton, who had specialized in colonial Spanish Texas and
had examined thousands of unpublished documents bearing on Indian populations. His brief essays cover hundreds of Texas groups,
particularly those noted for relative obscurity.
The most notable deficiency of the Handbook is that it is
inadequately structured for effective information retrieval. It is
name structured and difficult to use unless you begin with a known
Indian group name. It is not place or time structured in any convenient way, nor is it structured for categories of cultural information. For instance, if you want to find the names of all the Indian groups known to have lived in southern Texas during the 17th
century, or if you want to determine which groups had rabbit drives,
cultivated maize, or used peyote ceremonially, you must read or
scan some 2,000 double-column pages. This inadequacy could have
been minimized by including a detailed name and topic index, but
what the Handbook needed most was a series of integrative essays.
However, this early Handbook does grapple effectively with the
problem of name variants, one of the fundamental issues in
ethnohistory, and it presents useful bibliographies.
Later publications can sometimes be used to supplement the
Handbook. Swanton’s The Indian Tribes of North America (1952) is
place structured, but its scope is so broad that any particular sub-

SYSTEMATIZED ETHNOHISTORY

area receives only schematic treatment. More generalized syntheses,
such as Newcomb’s The Indians of Texas (1961), provide orientation
and perspective, but are of little help on the smallest identifiable
ethnic units.
What is needed today, and especially by archeologists, is a more
ambitious and better organized handbook. For maximum usefulness
all known ethnic groups, large or small, well-known or obscure,
should receive individual essay treatment and be arranged in
alphabetic order. Each essay should summarize what is presently
known about the Indian group in question. For groups with a wealth
of recorded observational detail, the essays will have to be compressed. The poorly known groups, however, should get special attention because of previous neglect. Each essay should be accompanied by an alphabetized list of all name variants and a
bibliography that will guide the user to all the truly informative
sources. I would insist that all ethnic name variants should be entered in alphabetic order along with the essays and that the name
variants be linked with essays by cross reference. This is the only
realistic approach, since the handbook user will always start with a
name, which may or may not be readily recognizable as equivalent
to a name which has been standardized by frequent usage in anthropological literature. Since some name variants are less demonstrable than others, the handbook user is entitled to know in each
case how good the evidence for equivalence actually is. If earlier
errors were made in name linkages, he is also entitled to know who
made the errors and the probable reasons for error. Hence all name
variants should be accompanied by specific bibliographic citations.
A properly systematized ethnohistoric handbook should have a
section that would permit one to begin with a specific landscape
unit, such as a general geographic area or a physiographic, biotic, or
archeological province, or even some smaller subdivision of these,
and readily find alphabetized lists of Indian groups associated with
these units during various phases of the historic period. This should
be designed to separate the apparent aboriginal groups from groups
known to have immigrated from adjoining or more distant areas.
There should also be a special section on Spanish missions that will
identify Indian groups known to have been represented there, with
dates of entry and departure, if known. The list might even be subdivided on the basis of the areas of population origin. For example,
the surviving records of Mission San Antonio de Valero (the Alamo)
of San Antonio indicate that individuals and families from over 100
Indian groups were represented there at some time or other. No one

8

has yet systematized this long list in any meaningful way.
Another section should be devoted to the earliest European explorers and the Indian groups they encountered and reported by
name. Much more critical work needs to be done on the delineation
of routes because the correct placement of many Indian populations
depends upon the maximum precision in route determination. Thus
far too many routes have been traced with too little first-hand
knowledge of the terrain traversed and without making full use of
ecological data. Hence some of the older route studies now seem
naive or even ludicrous. Recent studies that have led to greater
precision include Krieger’s (1961) review of the route of Cabeza de
Vaca across southern Texas and northern Mexico, Schroeder’s
(1962) revision of the routes followed by Coronado and O~ate
across the southern High Plains, and Williams’s (1962) remarkable
paper on the route of Dominguez de Mendoza from E1 Paso eastward into the Edwards Plateau region of central Texas. The last, the
study by Williams, has radically altered Bolton’s (1916: 313-343)
widely accepted earlier interpretation by on-the-spot observation of
landmarks and unique ecological niches mentioned in Mendoza’s
itinerary. As a consequence of this route correction, it is now
possible to identify a considerable number of Indian groups who
ranged over a large part of the Edwards Plateau before being
displaced by southward movement of the Apaches. At last the archeologist can begin to find the answer to an old question: just who
were the aborigines of the Edwards Plateau?
For the archeologist a good ethnohistoric handbook should pay
more attention to European observations of the natural environment, particularly those that indicate environmental changes
during the past 400 years. My modest foray into the document jungle
has forced me to realize that some documents are rich in observational detail and give important cues to both archeologists and
cultural anthropologists. I suspect that we can learn as much about
the environment and its changes as we can learn about the
distribution of native groups and their behavior. An opportunity is
being neglected when ethnohistorians continue to ignore basic environmental information that is available for collation, analysis and
ecological interpretation. The richest sources, of course, are the
records of earlier travelers, which are far more numerous than the
publications by historians have led us to believe. Some European
travelers were remarkably close observers of the landscape and
sometimes took the trouble to record much detail on vegetation patterns and animal distributions. Occasionally they actually described

SYSTEMATIZED ETHNOHISTORY

9

specific ecological niches, and few failed to note vegetation
dominants in areas traversed. Since weather limited early travel,
European travelers often recorded excessive rainfall, massive
floods, hurricanes, tornadoes and sometimes even commented on
erosion and deposition in stream valleys. I believe that by
segregating certain kinds of information and noting changes recorded through time we can better document gradual changes in soils
and vegetative cover, such as, for instance, the early spread of
thorny brush vegetation in southern Texas and northeastern
Mexico. It may also be possible to document shifts in migratory
animal distribution, such as the variable southern margin of the
bison range during winter. It may also be possible to document
changes that affected the irregularly distributed resources of special
interest to man -- surface water (springs, ponds, lakes), firewood,
grass, salt, flint and other siliceous stones, and minerals used for
pigment.
This is probably enough to provide some idea of the potential of
systematized ethnohistoric data. In conclusion, I would like to comment on areas that are notably weak in ethnohistoric data. Certain
parts of Texas are poorly known because Europeans rarely went
there prior to 1800. This is particularly true of numerous small areas
in which archeologists become interested. As an example we may
cite the area around the mouth of the Pecos River, where so much
archeological research has been done during the past decade. When
you search the documents, published or unpublished, you find practically nothing about early Europeans actually encountering natives
in this area, which had no resources that attracted Europeans and
did not lie on routes to places of special interest. This does not
mean, however, that we can never learn anything about the earliest
historic inhabitants of~the area. The approach here must be indirect,
that is, one must search the records of the nearest Spanish settlements for information recorded by travelers who skirted the
lower Pecos area or who talked with Indians who had been there or
otherwise had some knowledge of the area. In this case, one learns
that missionaries based in Coahuila traveled northward in the
1670’s, crossed the Rio Grande, and penetrated the southwestern
part of the Edwards Plateau just east of the Pecos (Bolton 1916: 283309; Figueroa Tortes 1963). These missionaries identified a considerable number of hunting and gathering groups whose seasonal
range must at times have included the lower Pecos area. Similarly,
records at Parral in Chihuahua reveal several lists of Indian groups
reported as ranging north of the Rio Grande or along the Rio Grande

10

from present Presidio, Texas, to the mouth of the Pecos. One
document of 1693 (Griffen 1969: 93-94) clearly points to the lower
Pecos area as the winter-season, bison-hunting range of a considerable number of named groups who at other times of the year
ranged both sides of the Rio Grande upstream from the mouth of the
Pecos River. As a result of this indirect approach, it is possible to
say something specific about the attractiveness of the lower Pecos at
certain times of the year. It also tells us something about distances
which hunting and gathering peoples traveled to get at especially
abundant food resources. Thus by careful analysis it is possible to
identify a substantial number of native groups who with high
probability exploited the lower Pecos area.
