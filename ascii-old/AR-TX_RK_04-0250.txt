MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
This report presents the results of a Phase I archaeological resources survey performed by Raba
Kistner Environmental, Inc., on behalf of the City of Grand Prairie for the proposed Great
Southwest Park development project (GSWP). The proposed GSWP consists of the development
of a city park along Johnson Creek in Tarrant County, Texas. The proposed GSWP is divided
into two land parcels separated by a railroad spur that crosses Johnson Creek. Raba Kistner
Environmental, Inc., performed a Phase I archaeological survey of the proposed development by
pedestrian survey and intensive shovel testing. The Phase I archaeological survey was conducted
in accordance with the Antiquities Code of Texas under Texas Antiquities Permit #8573.
All fieldwork for this project was conducted on 27-28 September 2018. No archaeological sites
were recorded and no prehistoric or historic artifacts were observed during Phase I shovel testing.
Raba Kistner Environmental, Inc., recommends that construction proceed as planned with no
further cultural resources investigations for the proposed GSWP development project. All field
records generated by this project will be curated in accordance with Texas Archaeology Research
Laboratory guidelines.

1. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Raba Kistner Environmental, Inc. (RKEI), has been contracted by the City of Grand Prairie to
conduct a Phase I archaeological resources survey for the proposed Great Southwest Park
development project (GSWP). The proposed GSWP consists of two parcels separated by a
railroad spur that services warehouses north of the development. The western land parcel
consists of 24.6 acres and is bounded on the north by warehouse construction, on the west by
residential development, on the south by Johnson Creek, and on the east by the railroad spur. The
eastern land parcel consists of 44.2 acres and is bounded on the north by residential development,
on the west by the railroad spur, on the south by Johnson Creek, and on the east by a small
undeveloped land parcel. The eastern land parcel boundary extends slightly across Johnson
Creek and includes minor portions of the south bank of the creek in the southeast and southwest
corners of the parcel.
The project area is located within the city limits of Grand Prairie and depicted in Figure 1 on the
Euless, Tex. 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle map (USGS 1981). More specifically, the
project area is located along a segment of Johnson Creek, a major tributary of the West Fork of
the Trinity River with its confluence located 2 to 2.8 miles to the east. The surrounding area is
heavily developed with residential housing and light industrial warehouses (Figure 2).
The proposed archaeological Area of Potential Effects (APE) consists of the two land parcels
described above and comprises 68.8 acres of which approximately 11 acres consist of the waters
of Johnson Creek, golf course water hazards, and an impoundment associated with the warehouse
development. Depth of impact for the currently proposed phase of park development is not
anticipated to exceed 1 meter (m). The testable APE consisted of the 57.4 acres of land area.
The proposed project is subject to the Antiquities Code of Texas, and in accordance with 13 TAC
§ 26.13 and Texas Historical Commission (THC) policy, RKEI performed a Phase I
archaeological resources survey within the City of Grand Prairie proposed GSWP. No federal
undertaking is anticipated.
Principal Investigator Julisa Meléndez, M.A., RPA, and Senior Archaeologist, Charles Neel
conducted the investigations and authored the report. Fieldwork was conducted on 27-28
September 2018. In accordance with 13 TAC § 26.17, project documentation will be curated at
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), The University of Texas at Austin, and will
be prepared for curation according to TARL standards.

2. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project is located in the Grand Prairie division of the West Gulf Coastal Plain as defined by
Fenneman (1938:102, 105), which comprises a topography of level plains due to stripping of the
limestone beds along their planes which dip slightly toward the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers and
tributaries however, give an angularity to the landscape due to their deeply cut channels. Johnson
Creek is entrenched at least 5 m into its narrow channel. Elevations within the project area range
from 465 to 505 ft above mean sea level (amsl) and lie within the floodplain and valley walls of
Johnson Creek.

Geology
Geology of the project area is mapped as Late Cretaceous Woodbine Formation (Kwb) (Barnes
1987). The constituents of the formation consist of one major bed of sandstone-mudstone. The
formation is further divided into (ascending) Dexter, Red Branch, Lewisville, and Templeton
stratigraphic units, an interlensing sequence of sand, clay, sandstone, and shale.
One exposure of the Woodbine Formation was documented on the south bank of Thompson
Creek immediately outside the project APE. An approximately 1.3 m thickness of the formation
comprised of a yellowish brown to brownish yellow soft sandstone member was observed
extending above the water level of the Johnson Creek channel entrenchment at approximately 3.7
to 5 m below the channel rim.

Soils
The project area is comprised of six mapped soil units (Figure 2): Pulexas-Urban land complex
(60), occasionally flooded; Konsil fine sandy loam (37), 1 to 5 percent slopes; Houston BlackUrban land complex (35), 1 to 4 percent slopes; Gasil-Urban land complex (32), 1 to 8 percent
slopes; Frio silty clay (27), frequently flooded; and Ferris clay (24), 5 to 12 percent slopes, eroded
(CSRL 2018). Approximately 50 percent of the project area is mapped as Pulexas-Urban
Complex, a soil unit comprised of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils.
A typical soil profile consists of an A horizon of brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam 5 inches
deep, overlying a C1 horizon consisting of a light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) fine sandy loam
5-30 inches deep, a C2 horizon consisting of a brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam 30-42 inches
deep, and a C3 horizon consisting of brown (10YR 4/3) loam 42-60 inches deep. Approximately
27 percent of the project area is mapped as Gasil-Urban land complex, a soil unit comprised very
deep, well-drained, moderately permeable soils. A typical profile consists of an Ap horizon of
brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam 8 inches deep, overlying an E horizon of very pale brown
(10YR 7/3) fine sandy loam 8 to 17 inches deep, a Bt1 horizon of reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6)
sandy clay loam 17 to 30 inches deep, a Bt2 horizon of brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) sandy clay
loam 30 to 53 inches deep, and a Bt3 horizon of brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) sandy clay loam 53
to 75 inches deep.
Approximately 7.4 percent of the project area is mapped as Konsil fine sandy loam, a soil unit
comprised of very deep, well drained moderately permeable upland soils. A typical profile
consists of an A1 horizon of reddish gray (5YR 5/2) fine sandy loam 9 inches deep, overlying an
E horizon of light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) fine sandy loam 9 to 12 inches deep, a Bt1 horizon of

4

red (2.5YR 5/6) sandy clay loam 12 to 29 inches deep, a Bt2 horizon of red (2.5YR 5/8) sandy
clay loam 29 to 47 inches deep, a Bt3 horizon of light red (2.5YR 6/8) sandy clay loam 47 to 71
inches deep, and a Cr horizon of yellowish red (5YR 5/6) weakly cemented sandstone 71 to 80
inches deep. Approximately 4.5 percent of the project area is mapped as Houston Black-Urban
land complex, a soil unit comprised of very deep, moderately well drained, and very slowly
permeable soils. A typical profile consists of an A horizon of very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay 8
inches deep, overlying a Bw horizon of very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay 8 to 24 inches deep, a
Bkss1 horizon of dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay 24 to 38 inches deep, a Bkss2 horizon of grayish
brown (10YR 5/2) clay 38 to 80 inches deep, and a Bkss3 horizon of gray (10YR 6/1) clay 80 to
104 inches deep.
Approximately 1 percent of the project area is mapped as Frio silty clay, a soil unit comprised of
very deep, well drained, and moderately slowly permeable soils. A typical profile consists of an
A1 horizon of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay 8 inches deep, overlying an A2 horizon
of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam 8 to 22 inches deep, an A3 horizon of dark grayish
brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay loam 22 to 29 inches deep, an A4 horizon of dark grayish brown
(10YR 4/2) silty clay loam 29 to 40 inches deep, and a Bk horizon of grayish brown (10YR 5/2)
silty clay loam 40 to 80 inches deep. Approximately less than 1 percent of the project area is
mapped as Ferris clay, a soil unit comprised of deep to mudstone, well drained, very slowly
permeable soils. A typical profile consists of an Ap horizon of olive (5Y 5/3) clay 8 inches deep,
overlying a Bk horizon of pale olive (5Y 6/3) clay 8 to 24 inches deep, a Bkss horizon of pale
olive (5Y 6/3) clay 24 to 40 inches deep, and a Cdk horizon of pale olive (5Y 6/3) and yellow
(2.5Y 7/8), non-cemented calcareous mudstone bedrock 40 to 80 inches deep.
Attributes of these soil map units are summarized in Table 1. Historically, the project area was in
the Crosstimbers vegetation zone, an area of dense mixed post oak and blackjack oak forest
(Street 1895). Current land use is an unutilized parcel of woodland, thickets, and mown grassy
areas of a closed and abandoned golf course with some intact concrete cart paths, bridges, tee
boxes, and water hazards.

3. BACKGROUND REVIEW
The Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) online database was reviewed on 28 June 2018 for
previously recorded cultural resources and previously conducted cultural resources surveys within
1 kilometer (km) of the project area (Figure 3). There are no recorded cultural resources or
previously conducted surveys within the project area boundaries. Two historical markers and one
cemetery are located within 1 km of the project area and are listed in Table 2. Three previously
conducted cultural resources surveys have been completed within 1 km of the project area and are
listed in Table 3.
Archival research was conducted of historic to recent imagery of maps and aerial photographs
from 1894 to 1995 (Street 1895; USDA 1920; USGS 1894, 1918, 1931, 1945, 1949, 1954, 1958,
1959a, 1959b, 1963, 1968, 1973, 1981, 1982, 1985, 1995). One historic-age structure related to
the former golf course is indicated to the east of the railroad tracks on a 1968 map (USGS 1968).
However, this structure was demolished between 2017 and 2018, based on aerial photographs and
communication with City of Grand Prairie officials. Vegetation within the project area is
depicted on the 1895 map (Street 1895) as Crosstimbers and by 1959 (USGS 1959a) the region is
shown as primarily in prairie with woodland along narrow stream valleys and steep ridge slopes
of the Trinity River valley. The 1920 soil map shows no buildings within the project area. The
floodplain soils, at that time, were mapped as Amite series, fine sandy loam, deep phase.
Previous archaeological surveys in the vicinity of the project area have not yielded many
significant archaeological sites. The project area and its immediate surroundings are suburban
developed land of residential and commercial properties and few sites have been recorded in
these disturbed settings.

4. FIELD METHODOLOGY
In accordance with 13 TAC 26.15 and THC policy, RKEI performed shovel testing of 57.4 acres
of land area of the project APE and 28 shovel tests were excavated. The primary objective of the
shovel testing survey was to assess the presence/absence of cultural material and depths of soil
units within the valley fill of Johnson Creek.
Field forms generated during this investigation were completed with pencil on acid-free paper
and GPS coordinates were documented for all shovel tests excavated. One measured drawing
profile was compiled for the south cut bank of Johnson Creek immediately outside the project
APE. Fieldwork was supervised by an archaeologist meeting the Secretary of the Interior’s
Professional Qualification Standards for Archeology and the Professional Qualifications and
requirements as defined in 13 TAC 26.4.

10

5. RESULTS
Twenty-eight shovel tests were excavated during the Phase I survey (Figure 4). In general, the
disturbed nature of the previously developed and landscaped landform, recent flooding events,
and dense thickets along the banks of Johnson Creek precluded a systematic traditional shovel
test grid (Figure 5). However, shovel tests were excavated on an approximate 30- to 60-m
spacing along higher landforms and areas considered least disturbed by the presence of large
mature oak and pecan trees (Figures 6-7). None of these shovel tests were positive for cultural
material and no archaeological sites or cultural features were observed within or immediately
adjacent to the project area. No shovel tests were excavated on the south side of Johnson Creek
within the minor parcels due to graveled and impervious parking lots, as well as considerable
dumping activities.
A deep stratigraphic profile was recorded on the south bank of Johnson Creek immediately
outside the project APE and offers insight into the depositional history of the Johnson Creek
valley (Figure 8). A vertical section available for profiling was cleaned by shovel cut and
troweling to assess soil stratigraphy. Due to slumping of the profile face and an overall height of
around 5.5 m, the profile was cleaned in a step fashion. The profile revealed two alluvial units
capped by a mottled modern clayey fill material. This upper fill material is 69 cm thick and
contains pieces of concrete and bottle glass. Below this fill is the original ground surface and the
top of one of two alluvial units. This upper unit is around 174 cm thick and consists of loamy and
sandy sediments. It exhibits a weak soil imprint consisting of a 30-cm-thick reddish brown (5YR
4/4) clay loam A horizon. A very thin bed of strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) sand is preserved at the
base of the A horizon and below this bed of sand is a relatively unweathered massive brown
(10YR 4/3) sandy loam. The soil imprint is indicative of a Pulexas series soil, a soil that is
mapped on the floodplain of Johnson Creek (Soil Survey Staff 2018a). Pulexas soils are very
deep Ustifluvents formed in stratified loamy alluvium on floodplains and typical display an AC1-C2-C3 profile (Soil Survey Staff 2018b). Horizontal bedding planes are a diagnostic feature
in the upper part of these soils. These features, as evidenced from the very thin bed of sand at the
base of the A horizon, within a weakly developed soil suggest a relatively young age for this
alluvial unit, probably less than 1,000 years.
The underlying alluvial unit is about 90 cm thick and rests on weathered sandstone bedrock of the
Cretaceous Woodbine Formation. This soil unit is imprinted with a moderately developed A-C
horizon. The A horizon consists of a very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay loam, while
the underlying C horizon is a brown (10YR 4/3) silty clay loam. Given the soil’s stratigraphic
and geomorphic context it appears to be equivalent to the West Fork soil identified by Ferring and
Yates (1997) in the upper Trinity River basin. The West Fork soil formed on the Pilot Point
alluvium, a late Holocene alluvial unit that is buried by a more recent alluvium.
The Pilot Point alluvium is late Holocene in age, or ~4,500 to 1,000 years old. The West Fork
soil, which formed on the Pilot Point alluvium, is ~±1,000 years old, although technically it likely
began to form centuries before 1,000 YBP (years before present). The West Fork soil is probably
equivalent to the Copan and Caddo soils of Oklahoma, all of which represent a period of soil
formation after channel entrenchment and subsequent floodplain stabilization around 1,000 YBP
(Hall 1990) within the Southern Plains and Central Texas areas.

6. RECOMMENDATIONS
This report documents the Phase 1 archaeological resources survey of approximately 57.4 acres
of land area within the 68.8 acres of the proposed GSWP in Tarrant County, Texas. The primary
objective of the survey was the identification of archaeological resources within the project APE
that may be disturbed by project-related activities.
No historic or prehistoric artifacts or features were encountered during the Phase I survey of the
GSWP. No archaeological sites were recorded and no artifacts were collected. It is
recommended that no further cultural resources investigations for the development of the
proposed GSWP project are warranted. All field records will be curated in accordance with
TARL guidelines for permit closure.
