Comprehensive Management Plan/Environmental Assessment
El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail
U.S. Department of the Interior – National Park Service
September 2011
The purpose of this plan is to establish the administrative objectives, policies, processes,
and management guidelines necessary to fulfill preservation and public-use goals for El
Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail, which the U.S. Congress added to the
National Trails System on October 18, 2004. The legislation authorizing El Camino Real de
los Tejas National Historic Trail identified approximately 2,580 miles of trail, extending
from the Río Grande near Eagle Pass and Laredo, Texas, to Natchitoches, Louisiana. The
designation of El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail commemorates
significant historic routes extending from the United States-Mexico international border
at the Río Grande to the eastern boundary of the Spanish province of Texas in
Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana.
This plan provides a framework for the administration of the trail and a vision to be
fulfilled through future, more specific resource studies and site and segment management
plans. The plan was developed in consultation with state and local government agencies;
interested parties, including landowners; federally recognized American Indian tribes;
area residents; trail-user organizations; National Park Service program managers and
resources staff; and the general public.
This document also includes a programmatic environmental assessment, which
considers, at a general qualitative level, the impacts that the two alternatives could have on
trail development. The environmental assessment sets the framework for future
compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act and the National Historic
Preservation Act for the significant resources associated with the trail. The environmental
assessment also assists decision makers and the public in evaluating the relative merits and
impacts of each alternative.
This plan presents two alternatives and their respective environmental consequences.
Under alternative A, the no-action alternative, there would be no federal action except for
what is required under the National Trails System Act. The adoption of alternative A would
not mean that present management activities would stop, but that the National Trails
Intermountain Region and on-the-ground site and segment managers and owners would
respond to future needs and problems in a manner similar to the way in which they are
currently operating.
Under alternative B, the preferred alternative, the National Trails Intermountain
Region would collaborate with partners to provide the public the opportunity to enjoy and
appreciate significant trail resources through high quality visitor programs while at the
same time supporting research efforts to ensure that significant trail resources are
identified and protected.
Partners would work cooperatively to achieve the purpose of the trail designation—to
commemorate the historic development of a network of trails, based upon American
Indian routes, which linked Spanish missions, presidios, and trading posts in a travel
corridor from the Río Grande to Louisiana. Much of the implementation of strategies
would rest with those members of the trail community willing to take the lead in proposing
projects and programs that identify and protect significant trail resources and their
Page i

accurate interpretation. The National Trails Intermountain Region would provide
technical assistance and a certain level of funding, as it becomes available, to eligible
applications to facilitate the initiatives suggested by the trail community. It would also
work closely with volunteers to achieve the purpose of the trail. Projects most likely to
receive support would focus on the identification and protection of authentic resources
and their interpretation. There would also be ample recreational and educational
programs to provide trail users the opportunity to enjoy and understand the authentic
character of the nationally significant resources associated with El Camino Real de los
Tejas National Historic Trail.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The National Park Service administers
El Camino Real de los Tejas National
Historic Trail, which was added to
the National Trails System by the U.S.
Congress on October 18, 2004. The
legislation authorizing El Camino Real
de los Tejas National Historic Trail
identified approximately 2,580 miles of
trail extending from the Río Grande
near Eagle Pass and Laredo, Texas, to
Natchitoches, Louisiana. The designation
of El Camino Real de los Tejas National
Historic Trail commemorates significant
historic routes extending from the United
States-Mexico border at the Río Grande
to the eastern boundary of the Spanish
province of Texas in Natchitoches Parish,
Louisiana. Although the period of historic
significance for El Camino Real de los
Tejas National Historic Trail dates from
1680 to 1845—spanning Spanish, Mexican,
and early American use—this plan focuses
primarily on the network of roads that had
been developed by the end of the Spanish
Colonial period in 1821. Trail routes, as well
as sites along the trail, are associated with
events that made significant contributions
to broad patterns of our nation’s history.
The purpose of this Comprehensive
Management Plan/Environmental
Assessment is to establish the
administrative objectives, policies,
processes, and management guidelines
necessary to fulfill preservation and
public-use goals for El Camino Real de los
Tejas National Historic Trail. Although
the act designating El Camino Real de
los Tejas National Historic Trail does not
specifically ask for the development of a
plan, Section 5(f) of the National Trails
System Act requires that a Comprehensive
Management Plan be developed for all
designated national historic trails. The
National Trails System Act also requires
the Secretary of the Interior to consult with
appropriate state and local agencies in the
planning and development of the trail.

This Comprehensive Management Plan/
Environmental Assessment provides a
framework for the administration of the
trail and a vision to be fulfilled through
future, more specific resource studies
and site and segment management plans.
Administrative staff at the National Trails
Intermountain Region developed the
plan in consultation with state and local
government agencies; interested parties,
including landowners; federally recognized
American Indian tribes; area residents;
trail-user organizations; National Park
Service program managers and resources
staff; and the general public. A mutually
agreed-on plan facilitates the work of
partners in accomplishing specific goals.
This document also includes a
programmatic environmental assessment,
which considers, at a general level,
the impacts that the two alternatives
could have on trail development. The
environmental assessment sets the
framework for future compliance with the
National Environmental Policy Act and
the National Historic Preservation Act
for the significant resources associated
with the trail. The environmental
assessment also assists decision makers
and the public in assessing the relative
merits and impacts of each alternative.

PLANNING ISSUES
The planning team traveled extensively
along the trail in both Texas and Louisiana
to become acquainted with issues central
to the planning process. Eight scoping
meetings were conducted, where input
from the public, government agency
representatives, federally recognized
American Indian tribes, trail organizations,
and individuals was systematically
recorded. Other comments by letter
and/or comment forms and emails
were received by the planning team.

ADMINISTRATION AND
MANAGEMENT
Although the trail itself is administered
by the National Trails Intermountain
Region, less than 1% of the trail corridor is
owned by the federal government. Given
that a substantial percentage of resources
is in private hands and that only a very
small percentage of resources is managed
by state and local entities, an effective
mechanism needs to be developed to
stimulate cooperative partnerships among
the many stakeholders through a range of
incentives. A major challenge facing trail
administrators is the need for consistent
preservation strategies, development, and
marking of the trail as it passes through a
variety of jurisdictions; other challenges
include the lack of awareness about
the trail and poor coordination among
groups interested in trail development.

RESOURCE PROTECTION
Among the most pressing concerns in
protecting resources is the need for the
accurate mapping of routes and a systematic
ground truthing of trail resources. There
is also need for additional research on
several topics. Diverse ownership of trail
resources (federal, several state entities,
and numerous private landowners) poses
a challenge to efforts to develop trailwide
strategies to preserve trail resources.

Page iv

INTERPRETATION, VISITOR
EXPERIENCE, AND USE
There is a general lack of coordination
in getting interpretive information to the
public. Interpretive facilities along the
designated routes need to explain more
accurately the historic developments along
the trail, place them into an appropriate
context, and provide the public with
interesting yet relevant and authentic
materials. Periodic updates of interpretive
information to reflect the latest scholarship
are needed, along with ways of making
academic research information accessible
to the general public, to teachers, and
to students in grades K–12 and beyond.
Finally, there is a need to foster heritage
tourism programs that draw on and
protect authentic, documented historic
resources clearly linked to the trail.

ALTERNATIVES
As part of the planning process,
two alternatives were developed. The
preferred alternative will address
the issues discussed above.
ALTERNATIVE A: CONTINUATION
OF CURRENT CONDITIONS (NO
ACTION)
This alternative is a requirement of
National Environmental Policy Act and
serves as a basis for comparison. Federal
action would be limited to what is required
under the National Trails System Act. Its
adoption would not mean that present
management activities would stop, but
that administrative staff at the National
Trails Intermountain Region and on-theground site and segment managers and
owners would respond to future needs
and problems in a manner similar to the
way in which they are currently operating.
Increased federal funding for trail
administration activities would not occur.

Executive Summary

ALTERNATIVE B: TRAIL
DEVELOPMENT THROUGH
PARTNERSHIPS (PREFERRED
ALTERNATIVE)
Under this alternative, administrative
staff at the National Trails Intermountain
Region would assist the trail community
in achieving the purpose of the trail
designation, which is to commemorate
the historic development of a network of
trails, based upon American Indian routes,
that linked Spanish missions, presidios,
and trading posts in a travel corridor
from the Río Grande to Louisiana.
Under this alternative, the trail
community would include, among
others, the Texas Historical Commission;
the Louisiana Department of Culture,
Recreation, and Tourism; the State of
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department;
El Camino Real de los Tejas National
Historic Trail Association; other federal
entities; federally recognized tribes whose
homelands are crossed by the trail in East
Texas; private organizations; institutions
of higher learning; museums; visitor
centers; private owners of trail resources;
trail scholars; public and private schools;
Mexican entities (such as the Instituto
Nacional de Antropología e Historia);
and all others interested in the trail.
The National Trails Intermountain
Region would collaborate with partners to
provide the public the opportunity to enjoy
and appreciate significant trail resources
through high quality visitor programs
while at the same time supporting research
efforts to ensure that significant trail
resources are identified and protected.
The National Trails Intermountain
Region would serve as an information
clearinghouse for activities along the
trail, coordinating efforts to ensure the
most efficient use of available resources.
Much of the implementation of strategies
would rest with those members of the
trail community willing to take the lead
in proposing projects and programs
that identify and protect significant trail
resources and their accurate interpretation.

Volunteers would work closely with the
National Trails Intermountain Region
to achieve the purpose of the trail.
The National Trails Intermountain
Region would provide technical assistance
and a certain level of funding, as it becomes
available, to eligible applications, depending
on allocations. Funds from the Challenge
Cost Share Program that fluctuate from
year to year, and possibly from other
programs, would help support initiatives
suggested by the trail community. Projects
most likely to receive support from the
National Park Service would focus on the
identification and protection of authentic
resources and their interpretation, and
would offer trail users the opportunity
to enjoy and understand the authentic
character of the nationally significant
resources associated with El Camino Real
de los Tejas National Historic Trail.
Administrative staff at the National
Trails Intermountain Region would also
oversee the development of sign and
interpretive standards that can be applied
consistently along the trail corridor.
Consistency is important because it would
heighten awareness of the trail and assist
trail users in finding and following the
designated trail routes and significant
historic sites. Consistency would also
allow for a more effective development of
recreational experiences around authentic
resources and interpretive programs.
The National Trails Intermountain
Region would place its main emphasis
on working with the trail community to
expand knowledge about trail resources,
in particular significant sites and segments
with a certain degree of historic integrity.
Investigations leading to more accurate
and extensive identification of high
potential sites and segments and their
location, condition, and priority needs
will be encouraged. Research projects
that aim to elucidate important aspects
of trail history or topics that have not
yet received adequate attention will
also receive special consideration.

E xecutive S ummary

Under this alternative, there will be an
effort to foster awareness among the trail
community of the evolving nature of the
trail and its associated resources. It has
been argued that El Camino Real de los
Tejas National Historic Trail responds
to the changing conditions and the
needs of the users. The trail is complex
and continually evolving, and has the
potential of becoming a very powerful
educational tool to attract people of all
ages to understand and protect it.
The National Trails Intermountain
Region would encourage and assist private
landowners in protecting significant
trail resources and, if possible and
appropriate, help such owners to make
resources accessible to the public. This is
an important component of this alternative
because a high proportion of trail resources
is privately owned. As landowners become
aware of the significance of their resources,
they may decide to become more interested
in monitoring and protecting them.
Under this alternative, the trail
community would have the opportunity
to become active participants in the
development of inclusive interpretive
and educational programs that reflect
current scholarship and offer a variety
of perspectives. There would be special
emphasis on compelling stories about
people, places, and events, particularly
those that represent the heritage of
the various ethnic groups, who were
central in the development of the trail.
Under this alternative, a concerted effort
would be made, in cooperation with the
trail community, to provide recreational
experiences closely linked and compatible
with the appreciation of authentic trail
resources and their protection. These
experiences would be strengthened by the
development of a consistent accompanying
interpretive program, which places the
history of the trail into a broad context
from which it can be better understood and
appreciated, and by the use of consistent
signage to facilitate public awareness of
the trail and the location of its resources.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
PURPOSE AND NEED
FOR THE PLAN

three criteria listed in Section 5(b) (11) of
the National Trails System Act as follows:

El Camino Real de los Tejas National
Historic Trail became part of the National
Trails System on October 18, 2004. The
authorizing legislation (Public Law 108-342)
identifies “approximately 2,580 miles of trail
extending from the Río Grande near Eagle
Pass and Laredo, Texas, to Natchitoches,
Louisiana, as depicted on the maps included
in the National Historic Trail Feasibility
Study and Environmental Assessment: El
Camino Real de los Tejas, Texas and
Louisiana prepared by the National Park
Service and dated July 1998 (see Appendix
A, page 149 and Map 1-1, page 4).

1) It must be a trail or route established by
historic use and must be historically
significant as a result of that use; the route
need not currently exist as a discernible
trail to qualify, but its location must be
sufficiently known to permit evaluation of
public recreation and historical interest
potential. A designated trail should
generally accurately follow the historic
route, but may deviate somewhat on
occasion of necessity to avoid difficult
routing through subsequent development,
or to provide some route variations offering
a more pleasurable recreational experience;

BACKGROUND

2) It must be of national significance with
respect to any of several broad facets of
American history, such as trade and
commerce, exploration, migration and
settlement, or military campaigns; to
qualify as nationally significant, historic use
of the trail must have had a far-reaching
effect on broad patterns of American
culture;

The National Trails System Act of 1968
established the National Trails System
“to provide for the ever-increasing
outdoor recreation needs of an
expanding population and to promote
the preservation of, public access
to, travel within, and enjoyment and
appreciation of the open air, outdoor
areas and historic resources of the
Nation.”
The National Trails System is composed
of statutorily created national scenic trails
and national historic trails. In addition,
national recreation trails and connectingand-side trail are recognized through
secretarial actions. The National Trails
System Act provides for a lead federal
agency to administer each national scenic
and national historic trail in cooperation
with a variety of partners, including other
federal agencies, state and local agencies,
American Indians, local communities,
private landowners, and others.

3) It must have significant potential for
public recreational use or historic interest
based in historic interpretation and
appreciation; the potential for such use is
generally greater along roadless segments
developed as historic trails and at historic
sites associated with the trail; the presence
of recreation potential not related to
historic appreciation is not sufficient
justification for designation under this
category. Such trails are established by an
act of Congress. Examples include the Trail
of Tears, Santa Fe, Oregon, California, Nez
Perce (Nee-Me-Poo), and Lewis and Clark
national historic trails.

National historic trails identify and
commemorate historic and prehistoric
routes of travel that are of significance to
the entire nation. They must meet all

for El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail

PURPOSE OF THE PLAN
Comprehensive management plans for
national historic trails are long-term
documents that provide a vision for the
future of the trail, including a management
philosophy and a framework to be used in
making decisions and solving problems.
This Comprehensive Management Plan will
provide guidance for approximately the
next 15–20 years.
The purpose of this Comprehensive
Management Plan is to establish the
administrative objectives, policies,
processes, and management guidelines
necessary to fulfill preservation and publicuse goals for El Camino Real de los Tejas
National Historic Trail, as established in the
National Trails Systems Act (16 USC 1244 (a)
and Public Law 108-342), titled “An Act to
Amend the National Historic Trails System
Act to Designate El Camino Real de los
Tejas National Historic Trail.”

Page 4

Although the act designating El Camino
Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail
does not specifically ask for the
development of a plan, Section 5(f) of the
National Trails System Act requires that a
Comprehensive Management Plan be
developed for all designated national
historic trails. The plan should include, but
not be limited to the following items:
• specific objectives for the National
Park Service, including the
identification of significant
ethnographic, archeological, historic,
and natural resources to be protected;
• specific details of expected
cooperative agreements with
government agencies or private
organizations or individuals;
• protection strategies for high potential
sites and segments;
• user-capacity assessment; and
• implementation details

Chapter 1: Introduction - Purpose of the Plan

In addition, Public Law 108-342 includes
the following requirements:
• The Secretary of the Interior shall
administer those portions of the trail
on nonfederal land only with the
consent of the owner of such land and
when such trail portion qualifies for
certification as an officially
established component of the trail;
• The designation of the trail does not
authorize any person to enter private
property without the consent of the
owner;
• The Secretary shall consult with
appropriate state and local agencies in
the planning and development of the
trail;
• The Secretary may coordinate with
United States and Mexican public and
nongovernmental organizations,
academic institutions, and in
consultation with the Secretary of
State and the government of Mexico
and its political subdivisions, for the
purpose of exchanging trail
information and research, fostering
trail preservation and educational
programs, providing technical
assistance, and working to establish
an international historic trail with
complementary preservation and
education programs in each nation;
and
• The United States shall not acquire for
the trail any land or interest in land
outside the exterior boundary of any
federally administered area without
the consent of the owner of the land.
This Comprehensive Management Plan
complies with the requirements of the
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.
It includes a programmatic environmental
assessment as a follow-up to the 1998
National Park Service National Historic
Trail Feasibility Study and Environmental
Assessment: El Camino Real de los Tejas,
Texas and Louisiana, on which Congress
based its decision to establish the trail. The
feasibility study provided a historic
overview, a statement of significance, and
offered three alternatives for future
protection, interpretation, and management

of El Camino Real de los Tejas National
Historic Trail. The examined alternatives
included (a) the no-action alternative, (b)
the designation of routes from Paso de
Francia to Natchitoches, and (c) splitting
the trail into two separately designated
national historic trails: El Camino Real de
los Tejas and the Old San Antonio Road.
The feasibility study recommended the
alternative designating the routes from Paso
de Francia to Natchitoches, Louisiana, as El
Camino Real de los Tejas. The National
Historic Trail Feasibility Study and
Environmental Assessment: El Camino Real
de los Tejas, Texas and Louisiana constituted
the first phase of a planning and
environmental review process. This
Comprehensive Management Plan, the
second phase, is a general and
programmatic document that includes the
level of information necessary to make
broad policy and planning decisions.

NEED FOR THE PLAN
This Comprehensive Management Plan
is necessary to provide long-term guidance
for natural and cultural resources
preservation, education, and trail-use
experience along El Camino Real de los
Tejas National Historic Trail. It provides a
framework for the administration of the
trail and a vision to be fulfilled through
future, more specific resource studies and
site and segment management plans. It was
developed in consultation with state and
local government agencies; stakeholders,
including landowners; federally recognized
American Indian tribes; area residents;
trail-user organizations; National Park
Service program managers and resources
staff; and the general public. A mutually
agreed-upon plan facilitates the work of
partners in accomplishing specific goals.
The Comprehensive Management Plan
describes how the national historic trail will
be administered and managed and aims to
accomplish the following:
• Confirms the purpose and
significance of the trail;
• Describes resource conditions and
visitor uses and experiences to be
Page 5

achieved;
• Identifies the need for partnerships to
protect trail resources efficiently and
to provide appropriate trail-user
services; and
• Provides a frame of reference for
National Park Service administrators
and its partners when making
decisions about central trail issues.
Federal ownership and management of
El Camino Real de los Tejas National
Historic Trail is limited to a portion of San
Antonio Missions National Historical Park
in Texas. Less than 1% of the national
historic trail is within the boundary of this
national park unit. With the designation of
El Camino Real de los Tejas National
Historic Trail, those trail segments within
San Antonio Missions National Historical
Park have become federal protection
components in compliance with section 3(a)
3 of the National Trails System Act.
The Comprehensive Management Plan
outlines a process through which nonfederal trail sites and segments may become
official components of El Camino Real de
los Tejas National Historic Trail using
specific development plans and
implementation strategies (see section on
Partnership Certification Program, page 39
and Appendix B: Partnership Certification
Agreement, page 151). In compliance with the
National Environmental Policy Act,
Sections 106 and 110 of the National
Historic Preservation Act, the impacts from
each ensuing plan, construction project,
trail program, and various other projects
will be assessed, as required by the
implementing regulations set forth in the
Code of Federal Regulations and other
applicable federal, state, and county
regulations. In all cases, planning for the
trail and for trail facilities will be carried
out in close consultation with landowners,
American Indian tribes, trail organizations,
community groups, local residents, and
state and local governments.

NEXT STEPS AND PLAN
IMPLEMENTATION
The Comprehensive Management Plan is
a long-term plan. Both National Park
Service administrators and partners will
take incremental steps toward reaching its
goals. Additional research and resource
studies and more detailed planning and
environmental documentation could be
completed as part of individual site and
segment management plans.
Implementation of the Comprehensive
Management Plan could take many years
and will depend upon additional funding
and the National Trails Intermountain
Region’s and partners’ time and effort.
Components of the plan need to be
prioritized and implemented as funding
becomes available.

Chapter 1: Introduction - Historical Background

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND 1
The designation of El Camino Real de
los Tejas National Historic Trail in 2004
commemorates significant historic routes
extending from the international border at
the Río Grande to the easternmost extent of
the Spanish province of Texas in
Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana. The period
of historic significance for El Camino Real
de los Tejas National Historic Trail dates
from 1680 to 1845; however, this plan
focuses primarily on the network of roads
that had been developed by the end of the
Spanish Colonial period in 1821. Trail
routes, as well as sites along the trail, are
associated with events that contribute
significantly to our understanding of broad
patterns of United States history.
It is important to note that after the
initial period of exploration and
colonization the land along the different
trail routes became home to various ethnic
groups. These include Spanish (including
Canary Islanders), French nationals,
Mexicans, African Americans, Anglos, and
a variety of different European peoples.
Most of them settled along the trail and
managed, to a considerable extent, to retain
their cultural traditions (see section on
Ethnographic Resources, page 115).
When Spanish explorers began to travel
into Texas and western Louisiana in the
1680s, they followed already existing
networks of American Indian trails.
Representatives of the Spanish Crown used
these paths to reach areas where they
subsequently established missions and
presidios. Eventually, armies and
immigrants followed these routes, which
led to Euro-American settlements across
the two states. Many of these roads
continued to be used in later years, forming
the boundaries of early Spanish and
Mexican land grants. Some of these land
grants became part of modern highway
1 - Information for this section comes principally from

New Mexico.

systems. In many places, Spanish names for
roads and landscape features have been
retained and often represent the only
reminder of the Spanish presence. Physical
remains of the trail, such as swales and ruts,
are testimony to the Spanish Colonial
heritage and to significant events that
occurred along the trail.
Preferred travel routes evolved through
time in response to social, cultural, and
environmental changes. Topography was a
key factor when deciding where to locate
trails: the best routes went through areas of
dry, solid ground but with sufficient water
resources to camp and replenish travelers
and their horses and pack animals. In
addition, certain routes were used
seasonally to avoid natural obstacles, such
as overflowing rivers and streams. As some
groups moved, routes that were previously
favored became less frequently used while
others gained popularity. Settlements were
often relocated in response to colonial
policies, conflicts, and/or changing social
conditions. Occasionally new routes were
blazed to steer clear of dangerous obstacles.
The Spanish political agenda of the time,
as well as the existing natural resources and
cultural conditions among indigenous
groups, directly influenced the selection of
trail routes. Early missions and presidios
(late 1600s–early 1700s) were established in
areas near good water resources in places
where Spain expected to Christianize
potentially “friendly” American Indian
groups and where they wished to establish
strategic military defenses to counter
French incursions. As a result, the earliest
settlements in Texas were established
among agriculturist Caddo tribes whose
sedentary ways of life appealed to the
Spaniards more than the nomadic
American Indian groups who also
populated the area.
Prehistoric American Indian trails
linked a complex network of villages and
important natural resources. Many of these
American Indian settlements were visited
repeatedly by European explorers in the
years preceding the first European
settlements in Texas. The routes that made
Page 7

C hapter 1: I ntroduction

regional settlement in Texas and western
Louisiana largely possible followed
American Indian trails.
The main contributing factor in
establishing the network of trails that
became El Camino Real de los Tejas,
however, was Spain’s attempt to create a
buffer against the French from the late
1600s on. Spaniards showed little interest in
settling the area until 1685, when they
received news that French explorer René
Robert Cavalier Sieur de La Salle had
established a colony in Matagorda Bay.
Traveling both by overland routes and by
sea, several Spanish parties searched for La
Salle’s outpost. Alonso de León made three
failed attempts, but finally succeeded in
finding La Salle’s settlement in 1689.
Accompanied by Franciscan friar Damián
Massanet and guided primarily by a
member of the Quems Nation, de León’s
party found La Salle’s Fort St. Louis in ruins
on the banks of Garcitas Creek (on the
boundary of Victoria and Jackson
counties)2. The search for La Salle’s outpost
was the beginning of an ongoing Spanish
presence in East Texas, marked by
expeditions and attempts at colonization.
Though the French colonization effort at
Matagorda Bay was not successful,
Spaniards responded by increasing their
presence in East Texas to improve their
ability to monitor and defend against future
threats. In the year following the discovery
of La Salle’s settlement (1690), de León and
Massanet set out for East Texas again. This
time, they planned to contact the
“governor” of the American Indians known
as Los Tejas, to determine if his people
would welcome a Spanish mission.
The people whom the Spanish called
Tejas were the same as those the French
referenced as Les Cenis (members and/or
leaders of the Hasinai Confederation)3.

Page 8

These and other American Indian villages
are depicted on several early maps, and it is
likely that Luis de Moscoso’s expedition
party had visited them as early as 1542. A
reference to “The Kingdom of the Tejas” by
a Jumano Indian was recorded in Santa Fe
in 1683. This may have stirred interest in the
American Indian tribes of East Texas—an
interest that would have been bolstered in
1689 when de León and Massanet were told
that their journey had taken them near this
kingdom. The following year (1690), their
expedition to find the Tejas governor was a
success, and marked the beginning of
missionary efforts and Spanish Colonial
settlement in East Texas.
Upon arriving at the village of the Tejas
in 1690, Father Massanet reported that
Spanish missionaries were well received
and had constructed a temporary structure
to hold mass. That same year, they built a
more permanent log structure nearby:
Mission San Francisco de los Tejas,
probably in Houston County. (For a listing
of Spanish missions and presidios
associated with El Camino Real de los Tejas
National Historic Trail, see Table 1-1, page 9)
They also established Mission Santísimo
Nombre de María in the same general area,
but it was destroyed by flood in 1692. Even
though an expedition brought supplies to
Mission San Francisco de los Tejas in 1693,
the mission was soon abandoned due to
growing hostility from local indigenous
groups. 4 Although these first attempts to
found missions in East Texas failed, they
mark the beginning of increased travel
along the Spanish Colonial road network
that would eventually link major
settlements in Texas and Louisiana.

or ally, rather than referring to an actual tribe or band.
The Spanish spelling and pluralization gives us the word
Tejas or Texas. Throughout this document, the term
Tejas is used to refer to the American Indian groups
noted historically, whereas the spelling “Texas” refers to
the state of Texas, unless otherwise noted.

3 - The term Tejas often used to describe the American
Indian nation(s) for which the Spanish sought to
establish a mission is a bit of misnomer. The term is
based on the Caddo word Teija or Teysa meaning friend

4 - Some archeologists suggest that a handful of
known archeological sites in Houston County may be
associated with these missions (Krieger 1945, Tunnell
1965).

Between 1700 and 1703, Spanish travel
into East Texas was made easier by the
founding of three missions (San Juan
Bautista, San Francisco Solano, and San
Bernardo) and a presidio (San Juan Bautista
del Río Grande), all of which were located
on the south side of the Río Grande, near
Guerrero, Mexico. This new settlement
area created a convenient waypoint in
addition to already known routes across the
Río Grande. In 1707, Diego Ramón,
stationed at the Río Grande settlement,
crossed the river into Webb and Dimmit
counties to punish raiding American
Indians and to gather neophytes for the
missions. In 1709, the Espinosa-OlivaresAguirre Expedition traveled to the San
Antonio River in Bexar County and
recommended that missions be established
there. In 1713, Louis Juchereau de St. Denis,
a French explorer and colonist, contacted
the Tejas, then traveled southwestward
through the future Bexar County to the
settlement area on the south side of the Río
Grande.
The Spaniards made no attempts to
settle East Texas again until 1716, more than
two decades after Mission San Francisco de
los Tejas was abandoned. In 1716, the
Ramón-Espinosa Expedition reestablished
Mission San Francisco de los Tejas at a new
location in Cherokee County, and then
founded three additional missions and one
presidio in Nacogdoches County. In 1717,
two more missions were established—one
in San Augustine County and one in
Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana (then part
of the Spanish province of Texas).
In 1719, the East Texas missions were
again temporarily abandoned. This time it
was out of fear of a full-scale French
invasion precipitated by the War of the
Quadruple Alliance, which saw the French
allied with Britain, Austria, and the Dutch
Republic against Spain. This European
conflict coincided with French exploration
parties on the coast of Texas between 1719
and 1721, which underscored the need for a
fortified frontier along the eastern
boundary of the Spanish province of Texas.
In 1721, all of the East Texas settlements
were reoccupied in or near their previous
Page 9

C hapter 1: I ntroduction

locations. That same year, the Spanish
strengthened their defenses by adding a
presidio and villa (village) to Los Adaes.
This site would serve as the capital of the
Spanish province of Texas until it was
abandoned in 1773, when the capital was
moved to San Antonio de Bexar in Bexar
County.
The East Texas settlements remained
open until after the presidio in
Nacogdoches County was closed in 1729. In
1730, three of the missions were temporarily
moved to Austin in Travis County, and then
permanently settled along the San Antonio
River in Bexar County. Following the
closing of the Nacogdoches County
presidio and the removal of the three
missions in East Texas, there remained five
major sites in East Texas: the presidio, villa,
and mission in Natchitoches Parish (Los
Adaes); the mission in San Augustine
County; and one mission in Nacogdoches
County. These five sites remained occupied
until 1773, when settlers were ordered to
move to areas along the San Antonio River.
With the establishment of a mission at
Los Adaes, Spanish roads and settlements
were extended to the easternmost point of
the province of Texas. Immediately
following the establishment of the East
Texas missions, the Spanish recognized the
need for an intermediate station between
the settlements on the Río Grande and
those of East Texas. In 1718, Mission San
Antonio de Valero (1718–1793) was
established, along with Presidio San
Antonio de Bexar and Villa de Bexar in San
Antonio. During that time, Mission San
José y San Miguel de Aguayo (1720) was
founded in Bexar County. In 1722, another
mission, San Francisco Xavier de Nájera,
was also established in Bexar County.
Although it was intended to be an
independent mission, it was in fact never
more than a visita, or sub-mission, of
Mission San Antonio de Valero. It later
became part of Mission San Antonio de
Valero.5 Although these two missions were
moved to as many as three different

they are often outlying chapels of missions. They are
chapels without a resident priest that are visited by a
priest from a nearby parish once or more often each
year.

locations, they remained permanent
establishments in Bexar County until
secularization in the late 18th and early 19th
centuries. Presidio San Antonio de Bexar
and Villa de Bexar survived well beyond the
end of the Spanish Colonial period.
Another Spanish settlement founded at
the end of the retreat from East Texas
included a mission and a presidio
established in Victoria County in 1721. The
first location of Presidio Nuestra Señora de
Loreto de la Bahía was on the site of La
Salle’s colony on the west bank of Garcitas
Creek, and the first location of Mission
Nuestra Señora del Espíritu Santo (1722–
1830) was nearby, probably on the east bank
of Garcitas Creek. Early in 1726, the
mission was moved to what is called the
Tonkawa site. The same year, both the
original presidio and the mission were
relocated again to the bank of the
Guadalupe River in Victoria County. They
were moved yet again 23 years later, in 1749,
to their final location in Goliad County.
Also that year, a villa was established near
the new site of the mission and presidio. All
three locations would be known as the
settlement area of “La Bahía” at the various
times of their occupation in the Spanish
Colonial period.
In summary, between 1721 and 1745, the
three main settlement areas along the
designated El Camino Real de los Tejas
National Historic Trail included:
1) East Texas settlements from Houston
County to Natchitoches Parish,
Louisiana: six missions before 1730,
reduced to three missions after 1730;
two presidios before 1729, and one
after 1729; and one villa;
2) Settlements in San Antonio, Bexar
County: two missions prior to 1731,
increased to five after 1731; one
presidio; and one villa; and
3) La Bahía settlements in Victoria,
Goliad, and probably Jackson
Counties: one mission and one
presidio at three locations, with a villa
after 1749, and an additional mission
after 1754. In 1746, however, Father
Mariano de los Dolores would begin a

Chapter 1: Introduction - Historical Background

missionary effort in a new area on the
San Xavier River (San Gabriel River).
Spanish colonization of the area
presently known as Milam County began
informally in 1746 as an attempt to develop a
fourth major settlement area along the
designated trail. Mission San Francisco
Xavier de Horcasitas was founded in 1748,
and by 1750 two additional missions and
one presidio were established. This new
settlement area was approximately midway
between the San Antonio and East Texas
settlements, offering a convenient
waypoint. Although Spanish immigrants
made no attempts at settlement in the area
before 1746, they had familiarized
themselves with this upper route as early as
1721, when Marqués de San Miguel de
Aguayo traveled through the area and
became acquainted with the local
Ranchería Grande Indians. The San Xavier
settlement was ultimately abandoned due to
conflict with American Indians.
In 1746, after several proposals by Nuevo
León governors, an order from the viceroy
created the new colony or province of
Nuevo Santander. This was followed by a
period of exploration and establishment in
1748 of Nuevo Santander, south of the Río
Grande. The new settlement area was
formed along a corridor on both sides of the
Río Grande, extending east to the Texas
coast and north to above the Nueces River
almost to the Frío River. In 1749, the
governor of the new province, José de
Escandón, brought 3,000 settlers and 146
soldiers to the area.
North of the Río Grande, Nuevo
Santander was largely comprised of private
ranches. Ranchers who lived along the Río
Grande often owned large tracts of land on
both sides of the river. Owners of large
ranches north of the river could maintain
their residence on the south side of today’s
international border. Many of the
communities along the Río Grande evolved
out of ranch headquarters. For instance, the
town of Mier grew out of a ranch
headquarters of 19 families that had
previously been known as El Paso del
Cántaro. A total of six villas would be

settled on the Río Grande within the
province of Nuevo Santander. Four of these
villas—Reynosa, Camargo, Mier, and
Revilla—were south of the Río Grande,
although their ranchlands extended north
of the present international border.
Only two villas would be located north
of the river. The first was established when
Escandón authorized Vásquez Borrego to
expand his hacienda to create Villa Nuestra
Señora de los Dolores in 1750, located in
northwest Zapata County. Though it
continued to be referred to as a hacienda,
the officially decreed villa of Dolores would
serve as an important waypoint between
the Río Grande and the San Antonio and La
Bahía settlements providing a ferry service
as well as guards to protect both settlers
and travelers across the Río Grande. In
addition to serving as a river crossing, guard
post, town, and ranch, Villa Nuestra Señora
de los Dolores was also considered to be a
visita. Dolores was visited by the priest of
Revilla for a month each year until it
received a resident priest in 1760. Although
Dolores had guard posts and other
defensive structures, it suffered several
attacks and resulting fluctuations in
population. It was completely abandoned by
1828.
The second villa to be established north
of the Río Grande in Nuevo Santander was
San Agustín de Laredo, officially founded
in 1755. Like Dolores, Laredo was located at
a well-known crossing of the Río Grande. It
eventually replaced Dolores as the main
crossing in the area, including a ferry
service at least as early as 1767. Also like
Dolores, Laredo grew out of an existing
ranching headquarters and served the
functions of a town, a guard post, and a
visita. Laredo received a resident priest in
1759, but it did not officially become a
mission.
The establishment of Nuevo Santander
marks the beginning of a time when the
lines between historic use types and
functions for settlement sites became
increasingly vague. As part of the Nuevo
Santander land grants settlers provided
guards, and ranch headquarters themselves
Page 11

C hapter 1: I ntroduction

often served as de facto guard posts, or at
least defensive structures constructed with
fortified stone walls with gun ports and
fireproof roofing materials. These defensive
structures can still be seen in the Dolores
ruins today. Additionally, ranch owners
agreed to provide religious instruction for
both the American Indians and the local
Spanish population. In this way, ranching
operations not only became civilian
settlements but also evolved to serve
functions previously performed by the
military and missionaries. Such locations
were usually centered on river crossings
along the designated trail.
With the addition of the San Xavier
settlement area and Nuevo Santander, there
were now five main settlement areas along
the designated trail: East Texas; San
Antonio; La Bahía (in Victoria County until
1749, and Goliad County, thereafter); San
Xavier in Milam County (with brief
occupations in Hays and Comal counties);
and Nuevo Santander. Another such
settlement was located just south of present
Eagle Pass in Maverick County.
All of the settlements were located along
the main travel corridors used by the
Spanish from at least as early as 1721, with
many used even earlier, perhaps since 1691.
As of 1755, these main travel routes included
one corridor, which extended from the Río
Grande crossings at Presidio San Juan
Bautista del Río Grande northeast to San
Antonio, then to the Nacogdoches area, and
on to Los Adaes. A second main route
crossed the Río Grande in the general area
of Laredo in Webb County and extended
north to San Antonio. A route that
branched northeast passed through Goliad
County and continued northeast, probably
connecting with the upper travel corridor
near the Neches or Trinity rivers in the area
of Houston County, where the first mission
to the Tejas was established in 1690.
In the 1750s, the Spanish attempted to
branch out, but failed due to conflicts with
American Indians.6 The Spanish Crown
6 - Between 1756 and 1762, the Spanish created three
new major settlement areas. They included missions
and presidios in three areas far removed from the other
settlements: 1) A settlement on the Gulf Coast, east of the
Page 12

recognized the failure of its colonial effort
along the northern frontier, at least as early
as 1766, when the Marqués de Rubí was sent
to inspect presidios throughout the
northern frontier, including Texas and
Louisiana. As a result of Rubí’s inspection,
all recent settlements were ordered to be
abandoned, and all of their inhabitants
were relocated to San Antonio and La
Bahía. However, with the move to the San
Antonio River valley, the extent of Spanish
Colonial presence—at least for a short
period of time—was effectively reduced to
two major settlement areas: Bexar and La
Bahía. Soon after their removal from East
Texas, a group from Los Adaes, historically
known as “Adaesanos,” requested that they
be allowed to return to an area closer to
their homelands. As a result, in 1774, the
Villa of Nuestra Señora del Pilar de Bucareli
was founded on the west bank of the Trinity
River in Madison County near Paso Tomás.
The Villa de Bucareli was short-lived. It was
abandoned five years later, in 1779, when its
inhabitants reestablished their community
at the site of the former Mission Nuestra
Señora de Guadalupe in Nacogdoches,
where the mission church was still standing.
Much as in Nuevo Santander, the East
Texas settlement sites—reestablished by
civilians—would serve as de facto presidios
and missions, as well as civilian settlements
with ranches. The East Texas ranches along
the trail later became trading posts, where
Spanish, French, American, and American
Indian traders legally and illegally bartered
a wide variety of merchandise.
As a result of the recommendations of
Marqués de Rubí, Spanish settlement
policies in the New World changed. There
was no longer an emphasis on establishing
present-day Houston metro area, that included Mission
Nuestra Señora de la Luz de Orcoquisac (1756–1772)
and Presidio San Agustín de Ahumada (1756–1770); 2) A
settlement in Menard County, which included Mission
Santa Cruz de San Sabá (1757–1758) and Presidio San
Luis de las Amarillas (1757–1771); and 3) A settlement
area known as the “El Cañon” missions, which included
Mission San Lorenzo de la Santa Cruz (1762–1770)
in Real County and Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria
del Cañon (1762–1767) in Uvalde County. These new
settlements represented Spanish attempts to expand the
frontier, but they never succeeded and were abandoned
by 1772.

Chapter 1: Introduction - Historical Background

missions, presidios, and scattered towns;
instead, there was a reduction in the
number of settlement sites and no further
expansion attempts. With the exception of a
small outpost of the Presidio San Antonio
de Bexar (a post known as Fuerte del
Cíbolo), no new official Spanish presidios
and only one mission (Mission Nuestra
Señora del Refugio) would be founded
during this period. Additionally, only four

1780 provides clues to the date and subject
matter. Additionally, its reliability as
documentation of the relationship between
river crossings, roads, and ranch
headquarters can be demonstrated by
modern knowledge of the locations and

villas would be established—all an
outgrowth of civilian ventures. The latter
half of the 18th century saw a focus on
civilian settlements and extended areas of
mission ranches, where the lines between
missionaries, military, ranchers, and general
civilians became blurred. This pattern is
similar to the one for Nuevo Santander, but
it also seems prevalent in the settlement
areas of San Antonio and La Bahía and also
in East Texas after 1772. These sites played
an important role in the continuation and
success of the various routes of El Camino
Real de los Tejas Trail because most were
located at important crossings.
The pattern of ranch headquarters being
used as guard posts or stopping places along
routes is illustrated in a late 18th-century
map of the San Antonio River valley
between the San Antonio and La Bahía
settlement areas (Figure 1-1 on page 13 is a
section of this map). Although the

dispositions of several of the trail-related
resources depicted on this map.
Researchers have added notes to the map to
show sites that have been confirmed
physically and archeologically, to
demonstrate the credibility of its
information and to facilitate its
interpretation.7
Figure 1-1 shows a settlement pattern of
ranch headquarters clustered around one or
more river crossings and houses on both
sides of the river. The ranches depicted in
this map are mission ranches and ranches
leased from the missions, which were part
of the mission lands ( fundos legales) of the
missions in San Antonio and La Bahía.
These fundos legales included mission
grounds, agricultural fields, and
ranchlands. Legal documents refer to roads
as ranch boundaries and several parcel

added notes to the map.

corners and other boundaries being located
at known river crossings. It is not clear if the
pattern of ranch headquarters clustering
around crossings was deliberately planned
in laying out the boundaries of mission
ranchlands. However, this pattern is
consistent with travelers’ written
descriptions of parajes (stopping places or
campsites), which noted that travel parties
tried to make camp shortly after crossing a
river because a heavy rain could come
overnight and make it impassable.
Therefore, it was important to have a paraje
on either side of a river to facilitate
whichever direction a given party would be
traveling.8 By the mid-to late 18th century,
many of the ranch headquarters and towns
tended to be former campsites that evolved
into stopovers with more amenities.
Ranch headquarters clustered near river
crossings would not only have served
travelers but also local settlers by providing
a community structure that facilitated
sharing resources and increased defense
against enemies traveling along the road. A
good example of this community structure
is found in the number of people recorded
at Antonio Gil Y’Barbo’s Rancho Lobanillo,
which, as early as 1773, boasted a population
of at least 65 people (made up of 14 families).
Y’Barbo’s ranches are also noteworthy
8 - The term paraje, though often translated as campsite,
is a word derived from the verb parar, which simply
means to stop. It is from the same root word as parador,
which is used in Spain today to refer to any place
where a traveler stops overnight, such as a hostel or
an inn. Therefore, although the term paraje has been
interpreted by many researchers to mean campsite, a
broader translation, such as stopover or waystation, may
be more appropriate to discussing the stopping points
along the trail routes as they evolved through time. That
is, in the early period of the trail, the paraje was simply
a place that travelers would record as they crossed
the landscape, because it was important to note the
places where one could find good water and favorable
conditions to camp. However, in the later periods of the
trail, especially after the expansion of private ranches
near river crossings (beginning in the 1750s), parajes
provided anything from a campsite to actual shelter
and other amenities. Another example that illustrates
that ranch headquarters were likely also parajes is
found in an 1827 land grant in Wilson County (GLO
document #103440), which states that the Flores ranch
was located on the San Antonio River (Río de Bexar) at
el paraje Nombrado Chayopines. The reference to the wellknown paraje in defining the ranchlands demonstrates
the important relationship between the trail and ranch
headquarters—a relationship that likely extended well
into the Mexican period and beyond.
Page 14

because he was known to be a prolific
trader and smuggler, and it is likely that his
ranch headquarters served as a trading
post.
The community structure is also evident
in the multiple functions served by ranch
headquarters. For instance, Rancho de las
Cabras (41WN30) had a church that was
visited by a priest from Mission San
Francisco de la Espada in Bexar County.
This church may have also served three
ranches located on the west side of the river
near the crossing known as Paso de las
Mujeres (at the Calvillo Ranch), all of which
had been leased from Mission Espada ranch
lands.
In addition to serving religious and
economic functions, many ranch
headquarters in the Nuevo Santander area
were built to be defensive structures, as
were those in the San Antonio River valley.
Rancho de las Cabras, for instance, had
defensive walls with probable bastions
around the ranch compound. Additionally,
two other sites that have been confirmed
archeologically in the area covered by the
map segment in Figure 1-1 include a presidio
outpost and a ranch headquarters with
masonry structures that would have
provided greater defense than the jacales
(primitive wattle-and-daub adobe
structures) often recorded along the San
Antonio River. According to historical
reports, additional ranches in the area with
masonry structures and chapels included
Rancho Pastle in Wilson County and
Rancho La Mora in Karnes County, though
neither of these has been confirmed
archeologically. Other ranch headquarters
in the San Antonio River valley between
Bexar and Goliad counties may have had
similar defensive and religious structures.
In 1803, the United States acquired
Louisiana from France, opening the door to
an influx of Anglo-Americans into
Louisiana and Texas. Other newcomers
were American Indian groups from the east
and southeast who were being pushed
westward by Anglo expansion or saw better
opportunities and more game available in
the Southern Plains and in Texas. Among

Chapter 1: Introduction - Historical Background

those tribes were the Creek Alabamas and
the Coushattas. They settled among the
Caddo for a while, and later were granted
lands by Sam Houston, first governor of the
Republic of Texas. The Choctaw also
moved into the Red River area and despite
frictions, eventually settled among Caddo
groups and other American Indians who
also made their move into Louisiana and
Texas during the early and mid-1800s.
Following the Louisiana Purchase, Spain
gained a new rival for supremacy of lands in
Texas and Louisiana: the United States.
Spanish officials soon realized that the
cooperation of the local tribes was essential
to maintaining New Spain’s ill-defined
territorial borders. Trade and gift giving
were once again central to Indian relations
policies carried out by both Spanish and
United States. Most of the traffic appears to
have been between Nacogdoches and
Natchitoches, but it is also clear that trade
also involved other tribes and extended
westward.
The boundary dispute between Spain
and the United States was a complicated
affair. It resulted in the establishment of a
swath of territory between Nacogdoches
and Natchitoches that was not under the
control of either country. The boundaries
of this territory, which came to be known as
the Neutral Ground, were never officially
described. Only the Sabine River and
Arroyo Hondo were designated in the
informal agreement between Lieutenant
Colonel José María Herrera (the Spanish
official who signed the agreement) and
General James Wilkinson (the United States
official who first took possession of
Louisiana for the United States). The
Spanish bolstered their claims by increasing
troops at Bexar and Nacogdoches. More
than 500 soldiers traveled from San Antonio
to Nacogdoches, and in November 1806, 883
soldiers were assigned to patrol the area
between Nacogdoches and Los Adaes.
This issue, which was debated from 1804
onward, was finally settled with the signing
of the Adams-Onís Treaty on February 22,
1821. Although Spain asserted that the
Caddo villages were located in Spanish

territory, neither the groups along the Red
River nor in the United States accepted that
notion.
Travel through the area remained
dangerous, though. Troops, settlers,
traders, runaway slaves, filibusters,
gangsters, and many newcomers from the
East looking for easy profit and lands
traveled the main road developed in the
previous century. Caddo groups initially
profited from the opportunity, but soon
thereafter, started to suffer as the onslaught
of new settlers overwhelmed them. In 1806,
the warehouse at San Antonio distributed
589 three-pound tobacco twists, 1,829
knives, 938 scissors, and 3,024 small bells
among 1,331 Indians of various tribes. These
goods and others maintained trade
relations and connections among native
groups, but they did little to help these
groups feel safer and offered no practical
resources to help them defend their
traditional lands.
The Spanish distribution of gifts was
normally done through licensed traders like
William Barr and Peter Samuel Davenport,
while the United States used John Sibley’s
factory system located in Natchitoches.
Unlike the Spanish traders, Sibley and
others provided the native groups with
weapons. Indeed, Sibley even arranged for a
blacksmith to repair their weapons. Sibley
was so successful that at one time as many
as 700 Indians went to Natchitoches to
receive gifts. This trade went a long way
towards obtaining and maintaining native
allegiance. It is unclear how much of this
trade went through El Camino Real de los
Tejas, but some certainly did.
In 1801, the Spanish government gave
permission to the House of Barr and
Davenport to export to Louisiana all of the
livestock they obtained from the Indians in
exchange for muskets, blankets, pots, and
clothing. During the same year, Barr
obtained permission to drive to Louisiana
about 300 horses and mules so that he could
purchase goods for the tribes.
Notwithstanding the tensions in the
Neutral Ground, Caddo groups fared rather
well until the dismantling of the Spanish
Page 15

C hapter 1: I ntroduction

Colonial empire, which began in 1810 with
the rebellion led by Father Miguel Hidalgo
y Costilla and culminated in 1821 when
Mexico became independent from Spain.
The ensuing tumult of revolutionary
movements culminated with the Texas
Revolution of 1836. As Mexican General
Antonio López de Santa Anna approached
San Antonio to quell the Texas revolt,
Caddo groups and others were again asked
to take sides. This time, however, the sheer
number of participants and their
conflicting positions made the choices
unclear for American Indians. In 1835,
Caddo chiefs ceded those of their lands
within United States territory and retreated
westward to Texas.
As Mirabeau B. Lamar took office as
president of the Republic of Texas, the
situation worsened for Caddo groups and
American Indians in Texas. Pushed by
Lamar, many retreated into Oklahoma for a
while but returned to Texas in 1839. In 1841,
Sam Houston became president of the
Republic of Texas and tried to find a
solution. In March 1843, some Caddo
groups and many other groups signed a
peace treaty at the Tehuacana Creek near
modern Waco, Texas. Following the treaty,
the Kadohahacho, Hasinai, Nadaco, and
other Caddo groups settled on the Clear
Fork of the Brazos River. Sadly, the treaty
did not bring about a lasting solution. In
1859, about 1,050 Caddo were removed to
the Indian Territory and the Wichita agency
in western Oklahoma. Today, the Caddo
Tribe of Oklahoma has its tribal complex in
Binger, Oklahoma.
Competition over the territory held by
American Indian tribes had begun even
before the end of the Spanish Colonial
period. Spain recognized that immigration
was the key to successful colonization and
began to consider requests from Anglos,
including a petition for a land grant by
Moses Austin in 1820. Following Moses
Austin’s death the following year, his son
Stephen F. Austin carried out his father’s
plans, receiving a land grant in 1821. This
was the beginning of what would become a
large-scale European and American
migration into Texas.
Page 16

Austin’s colony was located between the
Lavaca and San Jacinto rivers, south of the
San Antonio Road. The San Antonio Road,
referenced in several land grants, remained
a well-known route into modern times.
During the Mexican period (1821–1836),
Texas served as a buffer between the United
States and Mexico. The Mexican
government recognized that populating
Texas with immigrants would strengthen
the buffer area, so in 1824, the Mexican
state of Coahuila y Texas offered 4,428
acres of grazing land and 170 acres of
farmland to new colonists. Within the next
decade, more than 30,000 Anglos and 3,000
mainly African American slaves moved into
Texas, primarily to the eastern section of
the state. With so many new arrivals,
settlements grew up in areas far removed
from the main routes of the designated trail,
with the result that a network of roads
began to crisscross the region, especially in
East Texas. Complex road networks
continued to develop throughout the
Mexican period, as is well documented in
the 1830 minutes of the Ayuntamiento (City
Council) of San Felipe in which Stephen F.
Austin called for the construction of several
new routes in the area, as well as
assessments of some of the roads that
predated the Mexican period.
During the Mexican and Texas Republic
periods (1821–1845), existing roads in Texas
were improved and additional ones
developed. Even so, many of the settlements
dating from this period were established
along roads dating to the earlier Spanish
period. But as immigration steadily
increased—especially after Texas won its
independence from Mexico in 1836—a
complex settlement pattern and associated
new roads transformed the landscape.
As the 19th century progressed,
immigrants increasingly arrived by sea.
Port cities, such as Indianola and Galveston,
became major entry points for newcomers
from all over the world. With increased
population and the complex network of
roads that grew in its wake, designated trail
routes still bore names that referenced their
Spanish Colonial beginnings, but they no

Chapter 1: Introduction - Planning Issues and Concerns

longer functioned as the major travel
corridors they had been when Spain
struggled to colonize Texas. With time,
radical changes to the use of the road
occurred and the reasons that made El
Camino Real de los Tejas nationally
significant diminished.

PLANNING ISSUES AND
CONCERNS
Members of the planning team traveled
extensively through Texas and Louisiana in
2006 and 2007 to acquaint themselves with
the main resources and issues central to the
planning process. The team received ideas
and comments from the public during these
trips. The team conducted eight scoping
meetings in 2007, where input from the
public, government agency representatives,
federally recognized American Indian
tribes, trail organizations, and individuals
was systematically recorded. The planning
team also received and recorded comments
by letter and/or comment forms. Every
comment was considered. Members of the
planning team have also helped identify
issues that will likely directly impact the
National Trails Intermountain Region’s role
as administrator of the trail.
Several concerns about trail
administration can appropriately be
addressed here while others are beyond the
scope of the Comprehensive Management
Plan/Environmental Assessment, or would
be better handled once detailed planning is
underway.
The following is a list of the principal
issues identified during the process of
developing this document. The issues have
been grouped into three categories, but in
several cases they overlap. For example,
ownership of resources is an issue that has
been listed under administration, but it also
has implications for resource protection,
interpretation, and visitor use.
ADMINISTRATION AND
MANAGEMENT
1. There is limited public awareness of
the trail.

2. The role and responsibility of
National Park Service in the
administration of historic trails is not
well understood by the partners.
3. There is no current overall
administration of the trail: a series of
sites and a few segments are managed
locally, but no coordinated system of
routes and trail resources exists.
4. The majority of resources is in private
hands. A very small number is
federally owned and a variety of state
and local entities manage the rest.
Many of the private landowners have
been reluctant to participate in the
development of this plan.
5. There is a lack of adequate
coordination among groups interested
in trail development. Protection and
use strategies are inconsistent:
different levels of protection, use, and
interpretation are employed,
depending on the location and owner.
6. No formal mechanism for providing
technical assistance for preservation
and interpretation exists.
7. Financial assistance to stimulate
partnerships, protect trail-related
resources, and educate the public is
limited.
RESOURCE PROTECTION
1. Additional routes might be identified
2. Trail routes need further study,
particularly addressing the following
areas:
a. Accuracy
b. Connecting routes
3. Ground truthing of trail resources has
been completed only in certain areas;
further research is necessary to add
resources to the list of high potential
sites and segments.
4. There is a need for additional research
on the following topics and possibly
others:
a. Original Spanish government
correspondence regarding the
settlement of areas served by El
Camino Real de los Tejas National
Historic Trail;
b. Sites and segments related to the
Page 17

C hapter 1: I ntroduction

Caddo and other American Indian
tribes with close ties to the trail;
c. The African American experience
along the trail;
d. Commercial activities/trade/
contraband along the trail;
e. Evolution of civilian communities
(Spanish, Mexican, Anglo) along the
trail (from ranchos to towns);
f. The migration experience along the
San Antonio Road.
5. Trail resources are under diverse
ownership (federal, several state
entities, and numerous private
landowners).
6. Existing strategies to preserve trail
resources, such as swales or ruts, are
controversial.
7. No strategy has yet been identified to
protect and preserve trail resources
due to neglect, ignorance of their
significance, development pressures,
inappropriate uses, and natural
processes.
8. No formal approach to provide
technical assistance for preservation
and interpretation has been
established.
INTERPRETATION, VISITOR
EXPERIENCE, AND USE
1. Few coordinated methods of getting
interpretive information to the public
exist.
2. Research information needs to be
made accessible to the general public,
as well as to teachers and students.
3. Periodic updates of interpretive
information to reflect the latest
scholarship are needed.
4. No formal approach to providing
technical assistance for preservation
and interpretation exists.
5. Strategies for promoting public
support for the preservation of trailrelated resources are lacking.
6. Methods used to mark the trails are
different and often incompatible.
7. Interpretive facilities along the
designated routes need to explain
historic developments more
accurately, place them into an
Page 18

appropriate context, and provide the
public with interesting yet relevant
and authentic materials.

BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENTS
The designation of El Camino Real de
los Tejas National Historic Trail
commemorates a significant route of travel.
As in the case of all other national historic
trails, the legislation does not include
identification of specific legal boundaries
and does not provide for federal land
acquisition without the consent of the
owner. The National Park Service does not
identify land acquisition as a management
priority for this plan.
Furthermore, most national historic trail
routes are mapped at a very coarse scale
and their specific historic location is often
not known. The accurate identification of
many of these routes will require exhaustive
research and ground truthing, timeconsuming tasks that will be ongoing
throughout the life of this plan. It is possible
that as new research reveals more accurate
information, the location of the designated
routes might be slightly modified. At the
time this plan is being prepared, no
additional routes are contemplated for
inclusion. However, because of the
complexity of conquest and development
patterns, potential routes of travel could be
identified for further study. Inclusion of
such additional routes would require action
by Congress. (See Appendix C for Solicitor’s
Opinion on adding routes not included in
feasibility study, page 153).

Chapter 1: Introduction - Purpose of the Trail

GUIDANCE FOR PLANNING
AND ADMINISTRATION
General guidance for trail planning and
administration derives from the purpose of
the trail, as established by Congress; the
national significance of the trail and its
fundamental resources and values; the
primary interpretive themes that convey the
trail’s significance; and federal, state, and
county legal and policy requirements—the
more general body of laws and policies that
apply to El Camino Real de los Tejas
National Historic Trail. These parameters
guide all programs and actions
recommended in the Comprehensive
Management Plan/Environmental
Assessment and contribute to achieving the
trail’s purpose and other mandates.

PURPOSE OF THE TRAIL
A statement of purpose defines why a
particular trail or park has received official
recognition. The purpose of El Camino
Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail is
derived from the legislative history, the
National Historic Trail Feasibility Study and
Environmental Assessment: El Camino Real
de los Tejas, Texas and Louisiana, and the
public comments received in 2007.
The purpose of El Camino Real de los
Tejas National Historic Trail is to
commemorate the development of a
network of trails, based upon American
Indian routes, which linked Spanish
missions, presidios and trading posts in a
travel corridor from the Río Grande to
Louisiana. This network of trails was used
throughout the Spanish Colonial period,
the Mexican period, and up to Texas nation
and statehood.
To achieve the trail’s stated purpose, it is
essential to identify, protect, and interpret
the significant resources associated with El
Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic
Trail, and to provide trail users with
educational and recreational opportunities,
so that they will understand and enjoy
authentic sites and segments associated
with the history of the trail. The
involvement of all of those interested in the

trail and in particular volunteers will be
essential to accomplish the purpose of the
trail.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTS
Significance statements reflect the trail’s
importance to the heritage of the United
States. They serve as a tool in identifying
interpretive themes and desirable visitor
experiences. They help trail administrators
focus on the preservation and enjoyment of
those resources and values that directly
contribute to the purpose of the trail and
that must be protected. Significance
statements describe the unique qualities of
the trail’s resources, both separately and as
a whole, and place them within a broader
regional, national, and international
context.
The significance statements for El
Camino Real de Tejas National Historic
Trail include:
• Spanish settlement of the northeast
corner of the province of New Spain
was triggered by the 17th-century
struggle with France for territorial
control in North America: The
establishment of missions and
presidios along El Camino Real de los
Tejas demonstrated Spain’s
determination to discourage French
intrusion.
• The network of routes that became El
Camino Real de los Tejas followed
established American Indian trails. It
fostered the convergence of European
and Indian cultures by linking
cultural and linguistic groups,
introducing a foreign religious system
(Catholicism), and serving as an agent
for cultural diffusion, biological
exchange, and communication.
• For more than 160 years, El Camino
Real de los Tejas facilitated the
conquest, colonization, and
development of the region and was a
key feature of the Spanish Colonial
empire in what later became the states
of Texas and Louisiana.
• The location of El Camino Real de los
Page 19

C hapter 1: I ntroduction

Tejas shaped the physical and legal
patterning of land grants, settlements, and
subsequent transportation networks in
Texas and Louisiana.
• El Camino Real de los Tejas served as a
critical travel corridor for Mexican and
Texan military forces during the first half
of the 19th century.
• The Old San Antonio Road, from the Red
River settlement of Natchitoches,
Louisiana, to San Antonio, Texas, was the
primary overland route for early 19thcentury Anglo and African American
migration into Texas, and supported the
development of the cotton economy in
eastern Texas and northwestern Louisiana.

PRIMARY INTERPRETIVE
THEMES
Interpretive themes are the key statements
defining the trail’s significance and resource
values. These themes identify the primary
stories that best convey the trail’s significance
to the public. Interpretive themes connect
trail resources to larger ideas, meanings, and
values. They are the building blocks upon
which interpretive programs are based.
• PROTECTION, CONTROL, AND
DEVELOPMENT
El Camino Real de los Tejas was a line of
defense for New Spain with long term
consequences­—­­modifying the landscape to
meet the needs of armies and immigrants
and leading to community and trade
development.
• IRREVERSIBLE CHANGE
The cultural groups who traveled El
Camino Real de los Tejas caused
irreversible change to American Indian
lifeways, affecting family and community
life, religious practices, intertribal relations,
and resource use.
• PATHS TRAVELED
The trail represents the lifeways of
Indian groups, whose physical pathways
Page 20

were defined by the geographic landscape
of the Tejas environment and were later
adopted by Spanish, Mexican, American,
and modern travelers.
• SHIFTING ROUTES
The trail was not static—varying routes
were developed to meet the changing needs
of travelers, who were affected by weather,
Indian relations, terrain, settlement, and
modes of transportation—and the multiple
paths provide a visual understanding to
modern travelers of the area’s development
through time.
• CHANGING STATES
The trail is representative of the
dramatic socioeconomic change of the
1800s, including political unrest, military
action, Texas’ independence from Mexico,
nationhood, and entry into the United
States.

HISTORIC RESOURCES ALONG
THE TRAIL
DESCRIPTION OF TRAIL ROUTES
Current knowledge of El Camino Real
de los Tejas is incomplete. This is evident in
any attempt to clarify the complex system of
routes associated with this trail (see
Appendix D, page 155 for a discussion of
mapping El Camino Real de los Tejas
National Historic Trail). El Camino Real de
los Tejas was not a single trail; instead, it
was a network of regional routes that
included El Camino Pita, the Upper
Presidio Road, the Lower Presidio Road, El
Camino de en Medio, El Camino Arriba,
the San Antonio–Nacogdoches Road, La
Bahía Road, El Camino Carretera, among
other routes. Trail experts note, quite
accurately, that throughout its long history,
the trail’s route alignments moved to allow
travelers to avoid flooded rivers or
American Indians. Even though the routes
shifted with the season of the year or with
time, most destinations remained constant.

However, often Spanish settlements
proved ephemeral. Several missions,
presidios, and villages were short-lived, a
testimony to the obstacles that Spain faced in
colonizing such a large and harsh territory.
The National Historic Trail Feasibility
Study and Environmental Assessment: El
Camino Real de los Tejas, Texas and Louisiana
identified El Camino Real de los Tejas
National Historic Trail routes that were
designated by Congress. The study classified
the routes according to their starting and
ending points into routes from the Río
Grande to San Antonio, and routes from San
Antonio to Los Adaes.
There were three basic routes from the
Río Grande to San Antonio (see Map 1-2,
page 21):
1) El Camino Pita, between Paso de Francia and San Antonio, was named for a
paraje (campsite) used in 1716 by the
Domingo Ramón-Fray Isidro Espinosa
Expedition. It remained the route of
most expeditions through the 1720s,
when traffic moved farther south in
response to American Indian attacks.
2) The Lower Presidio Road, used
primarily from 1750 to 1800, went
almost directly east from Paso de
Francia, before turning north to San
Antonio. This route was also known as
El Camino de en Medio because it was
between two other roads: El Camino
Pita to the north and, on the south,
another main road to San Antonio that
ran east from the Laredo crossing of
the Río Grande.
3) Routes from the Laredo area, also
called the San Antonio–Laredo Road,
came into use with the founding of
Villa Dolores and Laredo in the 1750s. A
spur from the San Antonio Road (1750–
1830) went directly north-northeast
from Laredo. A second route from
Laredo to San Antonio (1750–1830) ran
east-northeast to La Bahía near
present-day Goliad. The route then
turned back to the northwest, following
the San Antonio River to San Antonio.
An Upper Presidio Road was opened
Page 22

later (1795–1850) generally following the
route of the earlier Camino Pita (it is
generally north of it) to a point east of
the Frío River.
There were two main routes from San
Antonio to Los Adaes (see Map 1-2, page 21):
1) The Upper Road or El Camino de los
Tejas (1691–1800). This road went
through modern New Braunfels and
San Marcos, reached the Colorado
River just west of Austin, and extended
to the missions in eastern Texas in 1716.
It was the predominant route for the
explorers and early settlers of eastern
Texas. Beyond a point 10 miles northeast of Austin to the San Gabriel River,
this road is not well defined. From the
San Gabriel River to the Trinity River,
three variations are shown: one that
can be partially identified from records
and two other, more northerly routes.
2) The Lower Road (around 1720s–1790s).
During the 1720s, the road east from
San Antonio shifted south, followed the
San Antonio River downstream, then
turned east to cross the Guadalupe
River near present-day Cuero, the
Colorado River, just north of La
Grange, and the Brazos near the mouth
of the Little Brazos River, near Hearne.
After the presidio and mission at La
Bahía were moved to present Goliad in
1749, the road was extended to La
Bahía, where it intersected with the
Laredo Road after 1755. The Lower
Road joined the northern route before
their common crossing of the Trinity
River. Most traffic, and especially
official expeditions, followed the
Lower Road between 1727 and the
closing of Los Adaes in 1773. East of the
Neches, all three routes—the Upper
Road (also known as El Camino Real de
los Tejas), the Lower Road, and the Old
San Antonio Road (also called El
Camino de Arriba)—are on the same
alignment.
After the closing of Los Adaes, both the
Upper and Lower roads to the east continued

Chapter 1: Introduction - High Potential Sites and Segments

to be used, with the Lower Road receiving
more traffic. A new mail route was
pioneered in 1795, with the aim of
straightening the route to East Texas. Many
segments of this road—later called the Old
San Antonio Road—are the same as the
Upper Road; other segments are the same
as the Lower Road. In the area of New
Braunfels, the San Antonio Road turned
slightly south to avoid crossing the Comal
and Blanco rivers. It then headed straight
for the Brazos River crossing of the Lower
Road, passing the Colorado River at
Bastrop. The Old San Antonio Road
followed the Upper Road from San Antonio
to the New Braunfels area, where it turned
slightly south to cross the Guadalupe and
San Marcos rivers. It then headed through
Bastrop to the Brazos River, where it
crossed the same area as the Lower Road.
The Old San Antonio Road between
Natchitoches, Louisiana, and San Antonio,
Texas, served as one colonial route used for
emigration, trade, and commerce in the
early decades of the 19th century and
beyond. The Old San Antonio Road also
provided an important transportation
corridor for military activities during the
Texas Revolution and the War between
Mexico and the United States.
In the state of Louisiana, State Highway
120 paralleled the original route of El
Camino Real de los Tejas until the 1820s. At
that time, the Americans established Fort
Jesup and built what would become
Louisiana State Highway 6 and the
Pendleton Bridge across the Sabine River,
making the ferry across the Sabine no
longer necessary.
To avoid confusion, all of the
congressionally designated routes are
subsumed under the name El Camino Real
de los Tejas.

HIGH POTENTIAL SITES
AND SEGMENTS
According to Section 12 of the National
Trails System Act:
a) high potential sites are those historic
sites related to the route or sites in

close proximity thereto, which
provide opportunity to interpret the
historic significance of the trail during
the period of its major use; criteria for
consideration as high potential sites
include historic significance, presence
of visible historic remnants, scenic
quality, and relative freedom from
intrusion;
b) high potential segments are those
segments of a trail that afford highquality recreation experiences along a
portion of the route having greaterthan-average scenic values or
affording an opportunity to share
vicariously the experience of the
original users of a historic route.
The planning process determines if sites,
trail segments, or associated resources are
eligible to be included as official
components of the national historic trail.
High potential lists are compiled based on
information available when the
Comprehensive Management Plan/
Environmental Assessment is being
prepared. They should not be regarded as
complete, conclusive, or final. Lists may be
amended to add or remove properties, as
appropriate.
The process of selecting high potential
sites and segments for El Camino Real de
los Tejas National Historic Trail required
the analysis of historic and archeological
information from 40 Texas counties and
two Louisiana parishes. The list of high
potential sites and segments was developed
after analyzing more than 500 sites and
involved a number of steps (see Appendix E,
page 161).
Crucial input in selecting high potential
sites and segments came from a number of
different representatives from the trail
community, including the Texas Historical
Commission; the Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department; the Louisiana Department of
Culture, Recreation, and Tourism; the
Texas Department of Transportation;
Stephen F. Austin State University; El
Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic
Trail Association; and others with
knowledge of trail resources. Members of
Page 23

C hapter 1: I ntroduction

the National Trails Intermountain Region
planning team, assisted by a core group of
experts with extensive experience
identifying high potential sites and
segments, visited the majority of sites/
segments included in the list and made a
determination as to which should be
included. In a number of instances, a
resource appeared significant but its
relationship to the trail was not clear; in
others, there was not enough historic
evidence to link the site to the trail. In many
cases, a site appears to merit inclusion, but
its specific location has not been clearly
identified. A decision was reached to
develop two lists: 1) high potential sites and
segments (see Appendix E, page 161, for
greater detail); and 2) those sites that might
merit inclusion later on but, at this time, fail
to meet some of the criteria identified in the
National Trails System Act; these sites
(almost 100) are included in Appendix F,
page 197.
As knowledge of trail resources
increases, a larger number of authentic sites
and segments will become eligible for
inclusion as high potential sites. However,
even though some of these sites and
segments may merit inclusion due to their
scientific importance in understanding the
history and the development of the trail,
they still may not be suitable for
interpretation and public access. A
combination of factors, such as limited size
(very short swales), location (in an area not
likely to permit safe public access or
underwater), landowners’ wishes, and other
reasons, might lead trail administrators to
conclude that some sites and segments,
although authentic, do not have the
potential to be developed and interpreted
for the benefit of the public.
For the purpose of this plan, 74 high
potential sites and segments have been
selected for inclusion from the state of
Texas; 19 from the state of Louisiana; a total
of 93 for the entire trail. Their approximate
location is depicted on the maps which are
included at the end of Appendix E, page 183.

GAPS IN INFORMATION AND
RESEARCH NEEDS
Information for this Comprehensive
Management Plan/Environmental
Assessment has come from documents
prepared specifically for this project. They
include 1) a cultural resources inventory for
the trail in Texas; 2) an ethnographic
overview; 3) a cultural resources inventory

Chapter 1: Introduction - Gaps in Information and Research Needs

for the trail in Louisiana; and 4) a natural
resources overview. However, due to the
considerable length of the designated route
and the limited knowledge about major
sections of the trail, much still remains to
be learned about El Camino Real de los
Tejas National Historic Trail routes and
associated resources. This Comprehensive
Management Plan/Environmental
Assessment highlights the need for
continued research and study of the people
and the resources associated with the trail.
For this reason, the planning team
recommends that the following studies be
undertaken, as time and funding become
available:
				
1) African Americans’ experience along
the trail;
2) Immigration into Texas during the
first half of the 19th century;
3) Development of Spanish/Mexican
communities during the period of
significance;
4) Systematic evaluation and
identification of regional routes
defining their periods of significance,
associations of culture, historic
properties, and their role in the
development of regional histories;
5) In-depth research of economic
activities along the trail;
6) On-the-ground archeological
investigations to verify routes and the
specific location of missions and
presidios;
7) Archeological and historical
investigations to identify the location
of missions and presidios, and other
significant resources;
8) Studies of cultural landscapes along
the trail;
9) Examination of additional historic
routes for future Congressional
designation;
10)Development of site/segment
protection strategies that take into
account special environmental
conditions along the trail;
11) Analysis of the relationship between
route selection made by travelers and
natural resources/environmental
issues; and

12) Impact of the trail on indigenous
communities (and vice-versa).

LEGAL AND POLICY
REQUIREMENTS
In addition to the legislation designating
the trail and the National Trails System Act,
other federal laws apply to trail
management. All trail resources and
opportunities for visitor enjoyment must be
managed in compliance with a large body of
legal and policy requirements intended to
adequately protect the nation’s natural and
cultural heritage and opportunities for the
enjoyment of that heritage. Federal laws,
regulations, and planning direction
applicable to this Comprehensive
Management Plan/Environmental
Assessment include, but are not limited to,
the following:
• Antiquities Act of 1906 (16 USC 431433)
• Archeological and Historic
Preservation Act of 1974 (AHPA, 16
USC 469-469c)
• Archeological Resources Protection
Act of 1979 (ARPA, 16 USC 470aa)
• Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16
USC 35)
• Federal Cave Protection Act of 1988 (16
USC 4301-4310)
• National Environmental Policy Act of
1969 (NEPA 42 USC 5)
• National Historic Preservation Act of

RELATIONSHIP TO
OTHER PLANS
COUNTY LAND USE PLANS
Existing land-use plans in the trail’s
vicinity are numerous because the routes
cross two Louisiana Parishes and 40 Texas
Counties. Given the general nature of the
alternatives proposed in this plan, it is not
appropriate to list all such documents.
However, as trail projects begin to be
developed, the National Trails
Intermountain Region will ensure that all
pertinent local land-use plans are examined
to ensure that there are no unexpected
impacts or inconsistencies.
STATE
Statewide comprehensive outdoor
recreation plans exist for both Texas and
Louisiana. In Texas, the Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department has prepared the Land
and Water Resources Conservation and
Recreation Plan (2005). In Louisiana, the
Division of Outdoor Recreation of the
Office of State Parks prepared the state’s
plan that was approved early in 2009. These
plans identify statewide recreation
demands and issues and present a strategic
approach to address them. These plans are
required to qualify for federal grants for
outdoor recreation projects and are to be
updated every five years. The alternatives
proposed in this plan are in accordance
with the provisions identified in these
documents.
At the request of the Texas State
Legislature, the Texas Department of
Transportation prepared in 1991 and revised
in 2001 a historic study and preservation
plan for a large segment of the designated
Page 26

routes of El Camino Real de los Tejas.
Included in A Texas Legacy, The Old San
Antonio Road and the Caminos Reales: A
Tricentennial History, 1691-1991, the
preservation plan calls for the identification
of historic resources, the completion and
consolidation of all inventories and existing
data, on-site investigation, evaluation and
documentation, additional research, and
the development of a management system.
It identifies suitable places (the intersection
of the various old routes with existing
roads) for the installation of historic
markers or information rest-stops for
tourists. The plan also recommends the
designation of the caminos reales as a
national historic trail.

APPROPRIATE USE
Section 1.5 of Management Policies
(2006), “Appropriate Use of the Parks,”
directs that the National Park Service must
ensure that allowed park uses would not
cause impairment of, or unacceptable
impacts on, resources and values. In the
case of El Camino Real de los Tejas
National Historic Trail, the National Trails
Intermountain Region does not own any of
the resources and does not have the
authority to regulate use. However, the
office will make an effort to work with
partners and the trail community to foster
appropriate trail uses that will not result in
unacceptable impacts to resources.

IMPACT TOPICS
Impact topics address those resources
that could be affected by the alternatives
presented in this plan. They offer a means
of comparing the environmental
consequences of implementing each
alternative. The planning team chose topics
on which to focus the environmental
discussion, based on the following factors:
resources and values that may be affected,
federal laws and other legal requirements,
the Council of Environmental Quality’s
guidelines for implementing the National
Environmental Policy Act, the National
Park Service management policies, and
issues and concerns expressed during

Chapter 1: Introduction - Impact Topics

public scoping and meetings with interested
parties along the trail.
Each impact topic is identified below.
The list is followed by a brief justification
for dismissing certain impact topics from
further consideration.
IMPACT TOPICS ANALYZED
• Cultural Resources
Ethnographic
Archeologic
Historic
• Natural Resources
Vegetation
Wildlife
• Landownership and Use
• Socioeconomic Conditions
• Visitor Use and Experience
IMPACT TOPICS DISMISSED
The decision to dismiss certain impact
topics from analysis is partially based on
extensive experience administering
national historic trails, and knowledge of
trail resources. After a systematic analysis
of the alternatives, the planning team
concluded that certain impact topics were
not relevant to the development of this
Comprehensive Management Plan/
Environmental Assessment. This decision
was reached for two reasons: because
implementing either alternative would have
no effect or a negligible effect on the topic
or resource or because the resource does
not occur along the trail. The topics
dismissed from further evaluation include
the following:
AIR QUALITY
Trail use would have negligible shortand long-term effects on air quality.
Potential sources of air-quality effects may
arise from development of trailheads and
vehicle emissions associated with
constructing small parking areas. Each of
these sources would be short-term and
negligible. The proposed alternative would
result in negligible adverse, short-term
effects on air quality; therefore, this impact
topic was dismissed.

CAVES AND KARSTS
Although there are important caves and
karsts in one of the counties and one of the
parishes crossed by the trail, there are no
known significant caves and karsts in the
proximity of the trail corridor. If any future
site-specific development were to take
place, a more detailed environmental study
would be undertaken to identify any
possible such resource that might be
affected; therefore, this topic was
dismissed.
CLIMATE CHANGE AND
SUSTAINABILITY
Although climatologists are unsure
about the long-term results of global
climate change, it is clear that the planet is
experiencing a warming trend that affects
ocean currents, sea levels, polar sea ice, and
global weather patterns. Although these
changes will likely affect winter
precipitation patterns and amounts in the
parks, it would be speculative to predict
localized changes in temperature,
precipitation, or other weather changes, in
part because there are many variables that
are not fully understood and there may be
variables not currently defined. The
analysis in this document is based on past
and current weather patterns and not the
effects of future climate changes; therefore,
this topic was dismissed.
CULTURAL LANDSCAPES
Those who traveled the trail focused
neither on a set of swales or ruts nor on
isolated places along the way, but instead on
the physical nature of the regions they
traversed. Such areas are identified as
cultural landscapes. The Secretary of the
Interior’s Guidelines for the Treatment of
Cultural Landscapes define a cultural
landscape as “a geographic area (including
both natural and cultural resources and the
wildlife or domestic animals therein)
associated with an historic event, activity,
or person or exhibiting other cultural or
aesthetic values.”
Cultural landscapes are particularly
important in understanding Louisiana and
Page 27

C hapter 1: I ntroduction

Texas trails because they played a
fundamental role in the selection of travel
routes. Seasonal variations and weather
patterns combined to dictate routes.
Understanding the choices trail users made
requires examination of the landscapes
with care. The cultural aspects of a
landscape are as important as the natural
features in defining management strategies.
The term “landscape” differs in
meaning, usage, and importance,
depending on who is using it. Ecologists
often use the term “ecoregion” or
“ecosystem” when they refer to landscapes.
Among cultural geographers, definitions of
the term “landscape” have changed
dramatically during the last six decades and
continue to evolve.
Although cultural landscapes have not
been considered essential trail resources,
they should be a high priority for presentday trail managers because they define the
nature of the trail, both at the time of
original use and at present. Cultural
landscapes are very important trail
resources and need as much attention and
protection as swales and other types of
specific traditional historic resources. More
importantly: legally, cultural landscapes
merit the same protection as other cultural
resources and should receive the same
treatment and protection.
The major character-defining features of
cultural landscapes along historic trails
depend on the local vegetation, hydrology,
topography, and soil, and sometimes the
human modifications of these elements.
Variations in vegetation, landforms, water
sources, and soils also help to identify
boundaries among the various component
landscapes of a linear resource.
The National Park Service has developed
a sophisticated methodology for the study
of cultural landscapes. As in the case of
User Capacity, identifying cultural
landscapes along the trail and developing
strategies for their protection would require
periodic, long-term access to privately
owned trail resources. It is likely that
cultural landscapes occur along this trail.
However, the majority of them are privately
Page 28

owned and many landowners are not
willing to grant access to their land.
Furthermore, any future trail development
project associated with the proposed
alternative would require compliance with
federal laws regarding the protection of
cultural landscapes. In such cases a more
detailed environmental study would be
undertaken to identify any cultural
landscapes that might be affected.
Therefore, this topic was dismissed.
GEOLOGY AND SOILS
Neither alternative proposes or implies
activities that would remove, erode, or
contaminate soils. In more than 20 years of
national historic trails administration, the
National Trails Intermountain Region has
undertaken no projects that would
adversely impact soils and has reasonable
expectation that none would occur in the
future. Any individual undertaking that
might be proposed in the future would be
carefully analyzed with respect to soilrelated impacts. Impacts to soils and
geology would be negligible, if any;
therefore, this topic was dismissed.
MUSEUM COLLECTIONS
The National Park Service is one of the
primary federal entities that preserves
cultural and natural resources. National
Park Service museum collections include
diverse disciplines and represent a
significant portion of the resources that the
National Park Service is charged to preserve
and protect. The collections are
characterized as cultural, natural, and
archival.
According to Director’s Order #24
Museum Collections, the National Park
Service requires the consideration of
impacts on museum collections, and
provides further policy guidance,
standards, and requirements for preserving,
protecting, documenting, and providing
access to, and use of, National Park Service
museum collections.
At the moment, there are no museum
collections associated with El Camino Real

Chapter 1: Introduction - Impact Topics

de los Tejas National Historic Trail. In the
future, the National Trails Intermountain
Region will work with existing museum
facilities that have the capability of storing,
curating, and displaying objects, specimens,
and archives associated with the trail. A
funding program, such as Challenge Cost
Share, could help support museum
collections in both Louisiana and Texas.
Neither alternative would result in any
unacceptable impacts; therefore this topic
was dismissed.
PALEONTOLOGICAL RESOURCES
No known significant paleontological
resources are located in the proximity of
the trail corridor. If any future site-specific
development were to take place, a more
detailed environmental study would be
undertaken to identify any such resource
that might be affected; therefore, this topic
was dismissed.
PRIME AND/OR UNIQUE FARMLANDS
Prime farmland is defined as soil that
particularly produces general crops such as
common foods, forage, fiber, and oil seed;
unique farmland soils produce specialty
crops, such as specific fruits, vegetables,
and nuts. There are no lands classified as
prime and/or unique farmlands within the
El Camino Real de los Tejas National
Historic Trail corridor. Neither of the
alternatives propose land-use changes. In
both cases, there will be a concerted effort
to work with local landowners in
implementing the provisions of this plan.
Impacts to prime farmlands are expected to
be negligible; therefore, this topic was
dismissed.
PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY
Neither alternative would result in any
identifiable adverse impacts to human
health or safety. Neither alternative would
change sanitation levels of treated water or
exposure to environmental or chemical
hazards. The numbers or levels of mobility
that would result from either alternative
would not be detectable compared to

accidents that occur every day in Texas and
Louisiana; therefore, this topic was
dismissed.
SOUNDSCAPES
National Park Service Management
Policies 2001 and Director’s Order #47,
Soundscape Preservation and Noise
Management, recognize that natural
soundscapes are important park resources
and call for the National Park Service to
preserve, to the greatest extent possible, the
natural soundscapes of parks. The policies
and director’s order further state that the
National Park Service is to restore degraded
soundscapes to their natural condition
whenever possible and to protect natural
soundscapes from degradation due to noise
(undesirable human-caused sound).
Noise can adversely affect, directly and
indirectly, the natural soundscape and
other trail resources. It can also adversely
impact the visitor experience. Currently,
visitors to some of the sites along El Camino
Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail
have opportunities to experience solitude
and tranquility in an environment of
natural sounds. However, since the
preponderance of trail resources along this
trail is privately owned, the National Trails
Intermountain Region can only work with
partners to foster appropriate uses that do
not impact the natural soundscapes of the
trail. Neither alternative proposes any
action that could affect the trail’s
soundscapes; therefore, this topic was
dismissed.
SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES
The Endangered Species Act of 1973
requires examination of impacts on all
federally listed threatened, endangered, and
candidate species. Section 7 of the
Endangered Species Act requires all federal
agencies to consult with the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service to ensure that any action
authorized, funded, or carried out by the
agency does not jeopardize the continued
existence of listed species or critical
habitats. In addition, the 2006 Management
Page 29

C hapter 1: I ntroduction

Policies and Director’s Order #77 Natural
Resources Management Guidelines require
the National Park Service to examine the
impacts of federal candidate species, as well
as state-listed threatened, endangered,
candidate rare, declining, and sensitive
species. For the purpose of this analysis, the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Texas
and Louisiana departments of natural
resources were contacted with regards to
federal and state-listed species to determine
those species that could potentially occur
near the project area (see Appendix K, page
237, for a listing of Special Status Species).
Preliminary consultation with the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service Southeastern and
Southwestern regions indicates that neither
alternative is likely to adversely affect any
special status species in Texas or Louisiana.
Both offices caution, however, that any
subsequent development proposals would
require further study and consultation with
regard to potential impacts on such species.
As stated previously, all federally funded
proposals that involve development or
outdoor recreation and that, therefore,
could potentially impact special status
species would be individually reviewed
under the provisions of the National
Environmental Policy Act. At this time,
there are no specific projects that would
cause any negative impact of any species of
concern; therefore, this topic was dismissed.
URBAN QUALITY AND DESIGN OF
THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
Consideration of this topic is required by
40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)
1502.16. The quality of urban areas is not a
concern in this plan. Under either
alternative, if new structures are proposed,
vernacular architecture and compatible
design would be taken into consideration.
Structures, such as interpretive kiosks and
restrooms, would be small and visually
unobtrusive. Emphasis would be placed on
designs, materials, and colors that blend in
and do not detract from the natural and
built environment. Appropriate actions
under the National Environmental Policy
Act and Section 106 of the National Historic
Page 30

Preservation Act would be taken on a
case-by-case basis as site-specific projects
are undertaken. Adverse impacts are
anticipated to be negligible; therefore, this
topic was dismissed.
VISUAL RESOURCES
Trail use would have negligible shortand long-term effects on visual resources.
Visual effects may arise from development
of trailheads and vehicle emissions
associated with constructing small parking
areas. Each of these sources would be
short-term and negligible. Appropriate
actions under the National Environmental
Policy Act and Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act would be taken
on a case-by-case basis as site-specific
projects are undertaken. The proposed
alternative would result in negligible,
adverse, short-term effects on visual
resources; therefore, the topic was
dismissed.
WATER RESOURCES
Neither alternative would encourage
actions that could result in an increased or
decreased use of water or cause changes in
the chemical, physical, or biological
integrity of the water resources along the El
Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic
Trail corridor. In more than 20 years of
administering national historic trails, the
National Trails Intermountain Region has
never undertaken projects that would
impact water resources. It is not likely that
any such project would be undertaken in
the future; therefore, this topic was
dismissed.
WETLANDS AND FLOODPLAINS
Portions of the designated routes are
located on or near floodplains and
wetlands. Any federal agency involved in
trail development in these areas would be
mandated to follow Executive Order No.
11988, “Floodplain Management,” which
requires federal agencies, to the extent
possible, to take into account the long- and
short-term adverse impacts associated with

Chapter 1: Introduction - Impact Topics

the occupancy and modification of
floodplains wherever there is a practical
alternative. Furthermore, federal policy
prohibits federal agencies from taking
certain actions in a 500-year floodplain.
The alternatives considered in this
environmental assessment do not call for
any trail-related development proposals for
these sensitive areas. Any future
undertaking in relation to this trail would
be carefully analyzed to ensure full
compliance with this executive order
mentioned above and any other pertinent
federal policy; therefore, this topic was
dismissed.

ENERGY REQUIREMENTS AND
CONSERVATION POTENTIAL

WILD AND SCENIC RIVERS

INDIAN TRUST LANDS AND
RESOURCES

No wild and scenic rivers are located
within the designated routes of El Camino
Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail;
therefore, this topic was dismissed.
WILDERNESS
No designated wilderness areas are
located in the proximity of the trail
corridor; therefore, this topic was
dismissed.
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE
Executive Order No. 12898 requires
all federal agencies to incorporate
environmental justice into their
missions by identifying and addressing
disproportionately high and adverse effects
of their actions on minorities and lowincome populations and communities.
The communities along the trail corridor
are characterized by a mixture of incomes
and ethnic backgrounds (See tables in
Appendix L; page 249-page 254). The proposal
in this Comprehensive Management Plan/
Environmental Assessment would not
have adverse impacts on minorities and
low-income populations and communities;
therefore, this topic was dismissed.

No facilities with inherent energy needs
are proposed in the alternatives. Existing
building facilities would be used for visitor
orientation and interpretation. Should any
of these facilities require remodeling to
accommodate trail projects, sustainable
design concepts would be employed. The
objectives of sustainability are to minimize
adverse effects on natural and cultural
resources, to reflect the environmental
setting, and to require the least amount of
nonrenewable fuels or energy possible;
therefore, this topic was dismissed.

There are no Indian trust lands or
resources in the area crossed by the
designated routes; therefore, this topic
was dismissed.
ECOLOGICALLY CRITICAL
AREAS AND NATIONAL
NATURAL LANDMARKS
There are no ecologically critical areas
and national natural landmarks in the area
crossed by the designated routes; therefore,
this topic was dismissed.
NATURAL OR DEPLETABLE
RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS AND
CONSERVATION POTENTIAL
Neither alternative would substantially
affect energy requirements, either within
national park boundaries or nonfederal
lands along the trail route, because any
rehabilitated buildings or new facilities
would take advantage of energyconservation methods and materials;
therefore, this topic was dismissed.

POSSIBLE CONFLICTS BETWEEN
THE PROPOSED ACTION AND
THE OBJECTIVES OF FEDERAL,
REGIONAL, STATE, AND LOCAL
LAND-USE PLANS, POLICIES,
AND CONTROLS
Most trail-related projects along the
designated routes would be proposed and
carried out by individual landowners and
managers, often without notification to,
consultation with, or assistance from the
National Park Service, the designated
federal lead agency. The National Park
Service has no direct management authority
over project type, size, and design, which
would be the principal determining factor
in any impacts from given projects. In
addition, location-specific factors would
vary considerably from site to site along the
length of the national historic trail. These
include habitat, vegetation, viewshed,
existing uses, public sentiment, the
presence of threatened and endangered
species, and the presence of historic
resources eligible for inclusion in the
national historic register. The combined
effects of all of these location- and projectspecific factors cannot be fully anticipated
or addressed at this time, but must be
evaluated at the project level in accordance
with the National Environmental Policy Act
and Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act. Consultation with federal,
regional, state, and local governing entities
identified no conflicts with existing landuse plans that might arise from either of the
alternatives at this time; therefore, this topic
was dismissed.

CHAPTER 2: ALTERNATIVES
INTRODUCTION
The preferred alternative proposed in
this plan (alternative B) aims to achieve a
vision for the trail that emerged during the
process of preparing this document. This
vision entails collaborating with partners to
provide the public with the opportunity to
enjoy and appreciate significant trail
resources through high quality visitor
programs while at the same time supporting
research efforts to ensure that significant
trail resources are identified and protected.
The actions proposed follow a
progression based on the assessment of
current conditions along the trail. For
example, one central concern is the need to
identify and document authentic trail
resources. Once this task is completed, it
would then be possible to develop
protection strategies appropriate to the
resources identified. Before some future
actions can take place, it might be crucial to
complete other tasks. For example, quality
interpretation is based upon knowledge of
authentic trail resources and their
significance. Development of projects to
enhance visitor experience depends to a
large extent on a quality interpretive
program. Interested partners would then be
able to develop appropriate recreational and
heritage tourism activities.

knowledge of the resources and awareness
of the trail expand, the potential for
development programs would also increase.
Under both alternatives the National
Trails Intermountain Region would be
implementing the authorities of the
National Trails System Act that pertain to
national historic trails. Both alternatives
address the required and the discretionary
authorities identified in the Act.
While the provisions of the National
Trail System Act and the specific trail
legislation allow for the acquisition of
properties from willing sellers, the National
Trails Intermountain Region does not
intend to acquire any trail-related sites.
However, it would be willing to provide
technical assistance to partners interested
in acquiring properties that are threatened
and/or essential to offer visitors the
opportunity to enjoy and appreciate
significant trail resources.

Not all of the actions identified under
the preferred alternative can take place
simultaneously, particularly since sites and
segments along the trail are at different
stages of development. Some have been well
researched and are open to the public.
Others need research to clearly link them to
the period of significance of the trail. Many
are privately owned and of difficult access.
Some important sites are important for
scientific purposes, but might not be of
interest to the general public. Furthermore,
the length of the trail would require
crafting realistic implementation strategies,
which in turn would entail collaboration
with all those interested in the trail, so as to
make the most effective use of available
human and financial resources. As

ACTIONS COMMON TO ALL ALTERNATIVES
ADMINISTRATION AND
MANAGEMENT
Within the National Trails System, the
terms “administration” and “management”
have specific and separate meanings to
distinguish between trail-wide
coordination (administration) and local
ownership, protection, and interpretation
(management).
ADMINISTRATION
Administration encompasses the tasks
performed by the agency assigned by the
Secretary of the Interior to administer the
trail. For El Camino Real de los Tejas
National Historic Trail, that agency is the
National Park Service. Subject to available
funding, the administering agency exercises
trail wide responsibilities under the
National Trails System Act for that specific
trail. Typically, such responsibilities include
the following: providing technical
assistance, oversight, and coordination
among agencies and partnership
organizations in planning, resource
protection, trail marking, and
interpretation; identifying high potential
sites and segments, initiating and
maintaining agreements (partnership,
cooperative, and interagency); setting and
maintaining signage and interpretive
standards; helping to ensure consistent
preservation, education, and public-use
programs; managing the use of the official
trail logo; encouraging and supporting the
work of volunteers, and providing limited
financial assistance to other cooperating
government agencies, landowners, interest
groups, and individuals.
Responsibility for the overall
administration of El Camino Real de los
Tejas National Historic Trail rests with
the superintendent of the National Trails
Intermountain Region—with staff in
Santa Fe, New Mexico, and Salt Lake
City, Utah. Current cooperative
agreements with the Texas Historical
Commission and El Camino Real de los
Tejas National Historic Trail Association
Page 36

would continue, pending available
funding.
MANAGEMENT
Management refers to those site-specific
tasks carried out by various governmental,
community, and private entities that own,
direct, or care for lands along each national
trail. Management responsibilities often
include the following: inventorying
resources; mapping, planning, and
developing trail segments and sites;
ensuring compliance with federal and state
laws; providing appropriate public access;
developing site interpretation; overseeing
trail maintenance; carrying out trail
marking; protecting resources and
viewsheds; and managing visitor use.
As required by the enabling legislation,
the National Trails Intermountain Region
would make an effort to foster relations
with individual and entities currently
studying or developing compatible
programs along the Mexican section of the
trail, in particular members of the Instituto
Nacional de Arqueología e Historia and
other pertinent Mexican entities.
Preliminary reconnaissance of significant
sites located in Mexican territory suggests a
rich potential for collaboration with
Mexican authorities on both resource
protection and interpretation.
RESOURCE IDENTIFICATION,
PROTECTION, AND MONITORING
Both alternatives acknowledge the key
role of environmental factors in the
selection and use of trail routes and the
identification and preservation of resources
along the trail. This is significant for trail
protection as historically routes were often
selected because they offered the easiest
way to reach a certain destination. The
environmental factors that led travelers to
favor certain routes still play a role in land
use in modern times: historic routes were
selected to facilitate travel and now their
corridors have become the choice for the
construction of pipelines, new highways, or

Chapter 2: Alternatives - Resource Identification, Protection and Monitoring

road improvements. For this reason, both
alternatives consider the natural
environment an integral component of high
potential sites and segments.
Although a survey of historic sites
(extant above grade and archeological) was
carried out during the development of this
plan, many sites and segments along El
Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic
Trail are not adequately known. This
Comprehensive Management Plan/
Environmental Assessment details high
potential sites and segments for Louisiana
and Texas derived from information on
more than 500 sites (see Appendix E, page 161,
for a detailed description of these sites).
High potential sites and segments would
receive priority both in terms of protection
and interpretation.
On lands for which the National Park
Service has the responsibility for the
management and condition of cultural
resources, such as San Antonio Missions
National Historical Park, all pertinent
federal laws would apply (see Chapter 1,
page 25 for a list of applicable federal laws).
Approaches to cultural resource research,
on-the-ground route verification, planning,
and stewardship would follow the National
Park Service’s Director’s Order 28, Cultural
Resource Management Guidelines. The
National Trails Intermountain Region
would also work with San Antonio Missions
National Historical Park staff to carry out
research to better understand the character
and significance of cultural resources along
the trail and the needs for protection and
monitoring.
HEALTH AND SAFETY
Under both alternatives, health and
safety issues would be addressed as
appropriate. Trail users would be warned
about potential risks, such as rough terrain
and low-lying vegetation that could become
entangled in footwear and cause a fall.
Necessary precautions would be included
in brochures and other written information,
such as postings on the trail’s website, signs
at trail sites, and other forms of interpretive
media.

USER CAPACITY
The National Trail System Act requires
that carrying capacity be addressed in a
Comprehensive Management Plan/
Environmental Assessment. National Park
Service planning guidelines have replaced
the term “carrying capacity” with the term
“user capacity.” User capacity is defined as
the type and level of visitor use that can be
accommodated while sustaining the desired
resource and social conditions and visitor
experience that complement the purpose of
El Camino Real de los Tejas National
Historic Trail and its desired conditions.
The ever-changing character of the 2,580
mile-long El Camino Real de los Tejas
National Historic Trail presents a unique
challenge to planners attempting to
quantify acceptable user capacity. The trail
crosses numerous old and modern
landscapes and rural and urban settings.
Trail boundaries are difficult to determine.
While some high potential sites and
segments are managed by public agencies, a
substantial number are in private hands,
have uncontrolled access, and serve
multiple uses. The capacity of each site or
segment to withstand various types of use
depends on complex combinations of
environmental, cultural, and social factors;
these range from extremely susceptible to
remarkably resistant to impacts. Land uses
and visitor experiences cannot easily be
monitored or controlled by any one entity.
Nevertheless, a meaningful strategy is
necessary to determine and evaluate
sustainable uses and levels for individual
sites and segments over time, thereby
ensuring that the full range of the trail’s
most significant resources are preserved to
maintain the values and characteristics for
which the trail was established as part of
the National Trail System.
The premise behind user capacity is that
some level of impact invariably
accompanies public use; therefore, public
agencies must decide which level of impact
is acceptable and which actions are needed
to keep impacts within acceptable limits.
Two important components of user capacity
for any national historic trail are 1) the
Page 37

C hapter 2: A lternatives

condition of trail-related resources and 2)
the condition of social capacity. The
condition of trail-related resources
includes, among other things, the visual
integrity of cultural sites, the ecological
integrity of the area crossed by the trail,
climatic conditions, the condition of the
trail surface, pedestrian traffic, and
erosional patterns. Conditions of social
capacity include those levels of congestion
and crowding that affect solitude and the
opportunity to vicariously experience the
nature of the trail.
Currently most land management
agencies employ user-capacity
methodologies that follow the “limits of
acceptable change” process developed by
the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest
Service in the mid-1980s. The process
involves the following steps:
• Develop prescriptions for resource
and visitor experience conditions in
various land units or zones;
• Identify indicators (measurable
variables) of conditions that can be
measured over time;
• Set quantifiable standards that
represent minimum acceptable
conditions;
• Monitor conditions in relation to
indicators and standards; and
• Adopt management actions to ensure
that conditions remain at or above
standard.
Using this approach, it is clear that user
capacity is not a set of numbers or limits,
but a process that involves establishing
desired conditions, monitoring, and
evaluation, followed by actions to manage
visitor use to ensure that trail values are
protected.
This methodology would require
periodic access to trail resources over the
life of this plan. Given that the resources
along El Camino Real de los Tejas are
predominantly privately owned and that
many landowners are not willing to grant
access to their lands, the planning team has
concluded that the National Park Service
would not be able to conduct user capacity
studies during the life of this plan.
Page 38

However, efforts would be made to
collaborate with partners to periodically
monitor the condition of significant trail
resources and to encourage partners to
pursue studies that would provide a greater
understanding of user capacity issues along
the trail.
TRAIL LOGO AND MARKER
The logo developed for El Camino Real
de los Tejas National Historic Trail would
be incorporated into the standard
triangular shape of the National Trails
System marker (see Figure 2-1). The marker
is a unifying emblem representing the trail
and all of its partners. Marker use would be
restricted to the National Park Service and
its partners for applications that help
further the purposes of the trail. As a
federal insignia this marker is protected
against unauthorized uses. The trail
superintendent retains approval authority
for all logo use along the trail.

Tejas National Historic Trail

Chapter 2: Alternatives - Introduction to Alternatives

INTRODUCTION TO
ALTERNATIVES
The planning team gathered ideas and
concerns expressed during the public
scoping process, formal and informal
community discussions, conversations with
private landowners, and meetings with
government agency representatives to
develop two draft alternatives.
ALTERNATIVE A: CONTINUATION OF
CURRENT CONDITIONS (NO ACTION)
Concept
This alternative is a requirement of
National Environmental Policy Act and
serves as a basis for comparison. Federal
actions would be limited to those required
under the National Trails System Act. Its
adoption would not mean that present
management activities would stop, but that
the National Trails Intermountain Region
and on-the-ground site and segment
managers and owners would respond to
future needs and problems in a manner
similar to the way in which they are
currently operating. Federal administration
would continue as it is, with levels
consistent with 2010 funding.
Administration
Under this alternative the National
Trails Intermountain Region would work
closely with state, local agencies, and
volunteers to implement the purpose of the
trail and other activities as described by the
National Trail System Act. It would oversee
the development of sign and interpretive
standards. It would also consult with state
and federal agencies as well as the owners of
resources to avoid incompatible uses.
Efforts to cooperate with Mexican entities
would be limited to responding to requests
for information and providing technical
assistance, as feasible based on available
budgetary and staff resources.

Resource Identification, Protection,
and Monitoring
The National Trails Intermountain
Region would support projects that
prioritize the protection of high potential
sites and segments identified during the
development of this plan.
A database compiled to keep track of
available information on trail resources
would be available for use in trail
development projects although it might not
be possible for the National Park Service to
provide for periodic updates.
An additional database containing more
than 500 bibliographical references to maps
and written materials (historic,
archeological, et cetera) relevant to the trail
during its period of significance and
relating to both Louisiana and Texas would
also be available although it might not be
possible to provide for periodic updates.
Partnership Certification Program
Partnership certification is a tool used by
federal trail administrators, with the
consent of the landowner, to officially
recognize, preserve, and interpret trail
resources on nonfederal lands. The product
of the partnership certification program is
not simply a paper certificate
acknowledging a property’s link to trail
history, but an enduring partnership
between the property owner/manager and
the National Park Service to work together
to benefit the trail resource and the visiting
public.
Partnership certification begins with a
conversation between the property owner/
manager and the National Park Service
about the historical significance and
management needs of a particular trailrelated property. As shared public
recognition, preservation and public use
interests emerge, the landowner/manager
and the National Trails Intermountain
Region may wish to enter into a voluntary
partnership to manage, protect, and
interpret the site for visitors. Commitment
to that partnership is formalized with a
simple, legally nonbinding agreement that
Page 39

C hapter 2: A lternatives

says that the parties would work together
toward those general mutual goals (see
Appendix B, page 151, for sample partnership
certification agreement). The National
Trails Intermountain Region can provide
many forms of technical assistance,
including signing and interpretation on a
case-by-case basis.
In authorizing some national historic
trails, Congress prohibited or severely
restricted federal agencies from
purchasing lands or interests in lands
outside the boundaries of federal areas.
However, through partnership
certification, nonfederal parties may
choose to work with the appropriate
federal trail administrator to manage their
trail properties as part of a national
historic trail.
Congress has established each national
historic trail for the purpose of identifying
and protecting a “historic route and its
historic remnants and artifacts for public
use and enjoyment.” At the same time
Congress has recognized that when
deemed to be in the public interest, “such
Secretary [charged with the
administration of a national historic trail]
may enter written cooperative agreements
with the States or their political
subdivisions, landowners, private
organizations, or individuals to operate,
develop, and maintain any portion of such
a trail either within or outside a federally
administered area. Such agreements may
include provisions for limited financial
assistance to encourage participation in
the acquisition, protection, operation,
development, or maintenance of such
trails…” [16USC1242 Section 7 (h) 1].
Partnership certification extends
national trail status and protection to
nonfederal trail resources. Therefore, the
purpose of partnership certification is to
afford protection to nonfederal trail
remnants, artifacts, and interpretive sites
to allow for public use and appreciation.
Partnership certification is not exclusively
for the benefit of the property owner/
manager or even for the sole benefit of the
resource, but for the public as well.
Page 40

Conditions of certification should include
some allowance for “public use and
enjoyment”—a way for people to
experience parts of the trail that otherwise
would be unavailable for visitation.
Under this alternative, the National
Trails Intermountain Region would assist
owners of high potential sites and
segments, who express an interest to
participate in this program, by providing
technical assistance as limited resources
allow.
TRAIL USE EXPERIENCE
Interpretation/Education
The National Trails Intermountain
Region would encourage local entities to
develop interpretive media and education
programs focusing on the interpretive
themes and high potential sites and
segments identified in this document. The
media and programs currently offered to
the general public by various public
agencies or private organizations would
continue. Efforts to provide opportunities
for trail audiences to forge emotional and
intellectual connections with the
meanings of these resources would be
limited, because the additional research
required to enhance the current
interpretive program would be left to
independent researchers who might not
have the necessary support to carry out
long-term projects.
Recreational Activities
Existing recreational opportunities
would continue to be provided at federal
and state parks and other facilities along
the route. At present few, if any of these
facilities, offer programs that are trail
related. Efforts to provide a consistent trail
experience would be limited.
Trail retracement along major state
highways would be possible, but would be
dependent on local efforts. Trail routes
following existing public roadways and
providing access to high potential sites and
segments would be marked to raise
awareness of the trail and encourage

Chapter 2: Alternatives - Trail Use Experience

visitation. It would also be possible that the
trail community in consultation with
National Trails Intermountain Region
would develop other appropriate
recreational activities consistent with the
provisions of the National Trail System Act.
ORIENTATION
Trail Identification: Marker and
Signs
The official marker incorporating the
logo, designed during the Comprehensive
Management Plan development process,
could be used to mark the designated trail
route along major state highways (State
Highway 21 in Texas and State Highway 6 in
Louisiana) and at high potential sites and
segments open to the public. Signs installed
at these sites and segments would identify
permitted trail uses, information on safety
and protection of trail users, and adjacent
private property. Signing would only be
done as resources permit. The National
Trails Intermountain Region would pursue
no federal funding for signing.
COSTS
The fiscal year 2010 budget of $201,000
for El Camino Real de los Tejas National
Historic Trail is assumed to be constant
for Alternative A. Small increases over the
life of this plan (about 15 years) would not
be expected to keep up with inflation.
Operations
Current levels of staffing would
continue. Staff that give a portion of the
time to the administration of the trail
would include the superintendent, chief of
trail operations, cultural resources
specialist, tribal liaison, interpretive
specialist, and geographic information
systems specialist. This staff would
collaborate with partners on a limited
basis to carry out the provisions of the
National Trails System Act. Base funding
of $201,000 would pay for annual
operations, including the salary and
benefits for staff, travel for routine
technical assistance to partners, office
equipment, supplies, phone, signs,

brochures, and publications. However, the
total staff time would amount to less than
one full-time position. Under this
alternative support for partner activities
would diminish. A stagnant budget would
mean long-term declines in all aspects of
trail administration.
Funding
Funding for the annual operating costs
would be provided by the base operating
budget of the National Park Service. No
increases in its base funding to meet the
needs outlined in this alternative would be
anticipated. Funding for brochures, other
interpretive media, signs, and other needs
may be available for mutually beneficial
partnership projects through the
competitive Challenge Cost Share
Program, an appropriation from Congress
that fluctuates in size from year to year
and may not be available on a permanent
basis. The current Challenge Cost Share
Program requires partners to provide a
minimum of 50% matching contribution in
the form of funds, equipment, in-kind
labor, or supplies from nonfederal sources.

C hapter 2: A lternatives

ALTERNATIVE B: TRAIL
DEVELOPMENT THROUGH
PARTNERSHIPS (PREFERRED
ALTERNATIVE)
Concept
This alternative builds on a central
purpose of the National Trail System Act,
which is to encourage and assist volunteer
citizen involvement in the administration,
planning, development, maintenance, and
management of trails. The trail community
encompasses individuals, entities,
institutions, and partners who share an
interest not only in trail history, authentic
trail resources and their protection, but also
in interpretive and educational programs
that highlight the significance of the trail.
Under this alternative, the trail community
would include, among others, the Texas
Historical Commission; the Louisiana
Department of Culture, Recreation, and
Tourism; the State of Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department; El Camino Real de
los Tejas National Historic Trail
Association; the Louisiana and Texas
departments of transportation; Mexico’s
Instituto Nacional de Antroplogía e
Historia; federally recognized tribes whose
homelands are crossed by the trail; private
organizations; institutions of higher
learning; museums; visitor centers; private
owners of trail resources; trail scholars;
public and private educational institutions;
and others interested in the trail.
To achieve the purpose of the trail, it
would be essential to collaborate with
partners to identify, protect, and interpret
the significant resources associated with
these routes, and to provide trail users with
educational and recreational opportunities,
so that they would understand and enjoy
the authentic sites and segments associated
with these routes and the history of the
trail.
Under this alternative the National
Trails Intermountain Region would take a
more proactive approach; it would not just
address the required authorities identified
in the National Trails System Act, but it
would also be implementing the
Page 42

discretionary authorities addressed in the
Act, such as the development of cooperative
agreements, support of volunteers,
partnership certification of significant trail
resources, and allowance for compatible
use as necessary or required by trail
partnerships.
Administration
During the scoping process, the lack of
coordination among the trail stakeholders
and limited awareness of the trail and of the
role of the National Park Service in its
administration became recurrent themes.
Lack of a formal mechanism for providing
technical assistance and limited financial
resources to support trail projects were also
mentioned as serious issues that would
hinder trail development.
Under alternative B, the preferred
alternative, the National Trails
Intermountain Region would assist in
coordinating programs and activities along
the trail in part through the continuation
and establishment of cooperative
agreements with state and local institutions
interested in the trail.
As funding allows, the current
cooperative agreement with the Texas
Historical Commission for the purpose of
working jointly to protect and interpret
significant trail resources would continue
(see Appendix G, page 215, for a sample
Cooperative Agreement). Collaboration
also would be essential at public sites
managed by the Texas Historical
Commission, such as Caddo Mound State
Park, which includes high potential sites
and segments related both to the history of
the trail and to the Caddo culture. A similar
cooperation based on available funding
would be envisioned for Los Adaes State
Historic Park, a public site operated by
Louisiana’s Department of Culture,
Recreation, and Tourism, Office of State
Parks, which includes trail significant
resources.
Cooperative agreements with other state
agencies that manage high potential sites
and segments would also be initiated and/or

Chapter 2: Alternatives - Alternative B: Trail Development Through Partnerships (Preferred Alternative)

continued depending on available funding.
Such is the case of the Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department that manages several
significant trail resources identified as high
potential sites and segments in this plan.
Other important partners are the Louisiana
and the Texas departments of
transportation, agencies that provide
signage and trail guidance materials.
Under this alternative, the National
Trails Intermountain Region would
encourage owners of significant resources
to participate in the Partnership
Certification Program as already described
in this document.
Adoption of this alternative implies that
its implementation would rest mainly with
volunteer members of the trail community
willing to take the lead in proposing
projects and programs that identify and
protect significant trail resources and
interpret them appropriately. For that
reason, this alternative proposes the
development of a comprehensive volunteer
training program and strongly supports the
coordination of volunteer efforts. Such an
approach would address issues raised in the
areas of resource identification and
protection as well as interpretation and
raising awareness about the trail.
To facilitate the initiatives suggested by
the trail community and to provide for a
more formal mechanism to deliver technical
assistance, the National Trails
Intermountain Region would offer eligible
applicants a certain level of funding
through the Challenge Cost Share Program
and/or similar funding sources, as they
become available. The limited size of
resources in these programs would not
eliminate the need for the trail community
to search for additional sources of funding
for specific projects.
The proposals most likely to receive
support from the National Trails
Intermountain Region would focus on the
identification and protection of authentic
resources and their interpretation. Such
projects would provide a solid foundation
to offer trail users the opportunity to enjoy
and understand the authentic character of

the nationally significant resources
associated with El Camino Real de los Tejas
National Historic Trail. A high priority
would be given to developing a strategic
plan to prioritize technical and funding
assistance by the National Trails
Intermountain Region for El Camino Real
de los Tejas National Historic Trail. This is a
crucial element in the effective use of
financial resources, given the length of the
trail and the number of resources involved.
Under this alternative, the National
Trails Intermountain Region would act as
an information clearinghouse for activities
along the trail, coordinating efforts to
ensure the most efficient use of available
technical and funding resources, an issue
that was repeatedly raised during the
scoping process. It would also oversee the
development of sign and interpretive
standards that can be consistently applied
along the trail corridor in conjunction with
the Louisiana and Texas departments of
transportation and other local highway
authorities. Consistency would be
important in order to heighten awareness of
the trail and assist trail users in finding and
following the designated trail routes and
significant historic sites. Consistency would
also allow for the development of a variety
of satisfying recreational experiences using
as inspiration authentic resources and
interpretive programs.
Under the preferred alternative, the
National Trails Intermountain Region
would work with the Mexican entities to
fulfill the purpose of the legislation,
“… exchanging trail information and
research, fostering trail preservation and
educational programs, providing technical
assistance, and working to establish an
international historic trail with
complementary preservation and education
programs in each nation.”
Resource Identification, Protection,
and Monitoring
The National Trails Intermountain
Region would emphasize working with the
trail community to expand knowledge
about trail resources, in particular
Page 43

C hapter 2: A lternatives

significant sites and segments with a certain
degree of historic integrity. Investigations
that lead to more accurate and complete
identification of high potential sites and
segments and their location, condition, and
prioritized needs would be encouraged.
Research projects that aim to elucidate
important aspects of trail history or topics
that have not yet received adequate
attention, such as the development of
Hispanic communities along the trail, the
relationships between various ethnic
groups, the Caddo legacy, and the
experience of African Americans in East
Texas and western Louisiana, would also
receive special consideration. Future
investigations would eventually include the
study of cultural landscapes and other
topics of relevance (see recommendations
for further study, page 25).
Under this alternative, there would be an
effort to foster awareness among the trail
community of the evolving nature of the
trail and its associated resources. It has
been argued that El Camino Real de los
Tejas National Historic Trail could be
considered a living organism that responds
to the changing conditions and the needs of
the users—an organism that is complex and
continually evolving. As such, the
designated trail has the potential to become
a powerful educational tool, with people of
all ages and cultures interested in learning
about it and working to protect it.
The study and preservation of historic
trails is multidisciplinary by nature. A high
priority would be placed on communityinitiated and supported projects that
emphasize the role of environmental factors
in a) the selection and use of trail routes and
b) issues associated with the identification
and preservation of resources along the
trail. This is significant for trail protection
as, historically, routes were often selected
because they offered the easiest way to
reach a certain destination. The
environmental factors that led travelers to
favor certain routes still play a role in land
use in modern times: historic travel routes
are often selected for the construction of
pipelines, new highways, or road
improvements.
Page 44

To support resource identification,
monitoring, and protection, the National
Trails Intermountain Region and the trail
community would:
• Continue to maintain and upgrade a
database prepared as part of the
development of this plan to compile
and keep track of available
information on trail resources. This
alternative envisions that this easily
updated database would be used to
collect additional historical trail
resource information as it becomes
available in the future. Because of the
ease with which the database can be
modified, current knowledge about
trail resources would be easily
available. The National Trails
Intermountain Region would act as
the clearinghouse for this publically
accessible database, which would be
geo-referenced and would include a
series of variables or attributes that
describe each resource (site or
segment) and its current condition in
detail (see Appendix H, page 225, for the
attribute table that has been
developed as part of this planning
project). This database would also
include visual documentation: a series
of electronic images that reflect the
condition of a site or segment at a
certain point in time. These two
features of the database—the written
description and the images—would
permit a more effective monitoring
program since it would facilitate the
comparison of current conditions
with the information stored in the
database. In addition, as described
later in this section, trail stewards
would also assist in updating resource
information. The current methods
used to determine user capacity are
difficult to implement, but the flexible
database developed as part of this
alternative, coupled with volunteers’
efforts, would greatly assist the
National Trails Intermountain Region
in monitoring and preserving
resources more effectively.
•

Chapter 2: Alternatives - Alternative B: Trail Development Through Partnerships (Preferred Alternative)

• Continue the route-verification
process that has begun in association
with the development of this plan.
Combining fieldwork (archeological
inventories and on-the groundverification) with archival research,
this process would enhance the
probability of accurately identifying
authentic trail segments and clearly
establishing their relationship to the
trail. The process would require the
integration of historic data derived
from expedition diaries, maps,
drawings, correspondence, reports,
Government Land Office plats, and
other documentary sources with
archeological evidence and current
physical landscape conditions data.
The historic and archeological
evidence would be spatially linked to
satellite images, aerial photography,
LiDAR, or other spatial tools, such as
ground-penetrating radar, so that
there is a higher probability of
correctly identifying the location of
trail routes. The results of this
multidisplinary investigation would
be eventually captured and stored in a
geographic information system. This
would facilitate the management of
the trail-resource data because it
could be easily updated as more
accurate information becomes
available.
• Maintain a bibliographical references
database compiled in association with
this project. At the time this plan is
prepared, it contains more than 500
entries including maps and written
materials (historic, archeological, et
cetera) pertaining to Louisiana and
Texas and relevant to the trail during
its period of significance. This
database would be periodically
updated to include the latest
publications, thereby supporting an
interpretive program that reflects
current trail scholarship.
• Strive to identify subject-matter
experts currently studying or
developing compatible programs
along the Mexican section of the trail,

in particular members of the Instituto
Nacional de Arqueología e Historia
and other pertinent Mexican entities.
A preliminary reconnaissance of
significant sites located in Mexican
territory, conducted early in 2009,
suggests rich potential for
collaboration with Mexican
authorities on resource identification,
protection, and interpretation.
• Provide assistance with the
development of the National Historic
Preservation Act Section 106
consultation process with the state
historic preservation officers in
Louisiana and Texas before starting
any trail development project. The
lead federal agency, or the proponent
of the project, if privately funded,
would have ultimate responsibility for
compliance.
• Analyze resources along the trail to
determine appropriate protection
strategies. This alternative would
support a trail-wide effort to complete
periodic revisions to the trail database
previously identified and to
collaborate with partners in updating
said database.
• Support the identification of
properties potentially eligible for the
National Register of Historic Places
and collaborate in preparing forms for
their nomination in collaboration
with the Texas Historical Commission
and the Louisiana Department of
Culture, Recreation, and Tourism.
• Integrate resource protection
information into interpretive
messages to provide an incentive for
trail users to protect resources.
• Create a communication network to
disseminate information about
resources threats. Although the
National Trails Intermountain Region
has already been participating in the
process to assess the potential impacts
of proposed pipelines and other
serious threats to trail resources,
under this alternative there would be a
Page 45

C hapter 2: A lternatives

clearly defined process to alert all the
owners of potentially threatened
properties about the need to
participate in the compliance process.
When resource threats become
known, trail resource information
would be shared with all federal, state,
county, and local entities and
individual stakeholders.
• Encourage the participation of
interested private citizens. This
alternative would establish a
comprehensive training program for
volunteers to learn about issues
related to the identification,
protection, and interpretation of trail
resources. Volunteer efforts in the
identification and inventory of
resources are crucial to the success of
national historic trails. Special
training would be offered to
volunteers living all along the trail,
under the auspices of the Texas
Historical Commission, the Louisiana
Department of Culture, Recreation,
and Tourism, as well as the National
Trails Intermountain Region. This
alternative envisions collaboration
among institutions of higher learning
and other interested groups to
implement the volunteer training
program.
• Create the position of volunteer “trail
steward” within the trail community
for each county or parish crossed by
the trail. These stewards (similar to
the volunteer Archeological Stewards
Program that currently exists for the
state of Texas) would be responsible
for periodic monitoring of the
resources under their jurisdiction and
for assisting in providing information
on trail resources for the periodic
updates of the trail database. Trail
stewards would also be in charge of
establishing and maintaining a
semiformal communication network
that, among other things, would serve
to identify potential threats to
significant trail resources, such as
upcoming construction projects. The
National Trails Intermountain
Page 46

Region, the Texas Historical
Commission, and Louisiana
Department of Culture, Recreation,
and Tourism would provide technical
assistance, support, and guidance to
trail stewards.
• Collaborate with federally recognized
tribes to identify additional sites and
stories relevant to the history of the
tribe that are associated with the trail.
Resource owners would be able to
request technical assistance to address the
following issues: accurate documentation of
historic/archeological sites, physical
deterioration of swales/segments, site
restoration, building/ruin stabilization,
among other things. The Texas Historical
Commission, the Louisiana Department of
Culture, Recreation, and Tourism, and the
National Trails Intermountain Region
would assist private landowners interested
in developing their trail resources to ensure
that future proposed projects do not impact
the visual integrity of significant sites or
segments.
Collaboration among the members of the
trail community would be of utmost
importance given the sheer length of the
2,580-mile-long designated trail. The
National Trails Intermountain Region
would encourage and support a yearly
conference to discuss issues related to the
purpose of the trail, such as current trail
scholarship, resource protection issues, new
interpretive and/or educational programs,
and possibly others.
Partnership Certification Program
Partnership certification is a tool used by
federal trail administrators, with the
consent of the landowner, to officially
recognize, preserve, and interpret trail
resources on nonfederal land. The product
of the partnership certification program is
not simply a paper certificate acknowledging
a property’s link to trail history, but an
enduring partnership between the property
owner/manager and the National Park
Service to work together to benefit the trail
resource and the visiting public.

Chapter 2: Alternatives - Alternative B: Trail Development Through Partnerships (Preferred Alternative)

Partnership certification begins with a
conversation between the property owner/
manager and the National Park Service
about the historical significance and
management needs of a particular trailrelated property. As shared public
recognition, preservation, and public use
interests emerge, the landowner/manager
and the National Trails Intermountain
Region may wish to enter into a voluntary
partnership to manage, protect, and
interpret the site for visitors. Commitment
to that partnership is formalized with a
simple, legally nonbinding agreement that
says that the parties would work together
toward those general mutual goals (see
Appendix B, page 151, for sample partnership
certification agreement). The National
Trails Intermountain Region, as funding
permits, provides a certificate and a
national historic trail site identification sign
with the official logo designating the
property as a national historic trail certified
site.
Through partnership certification,
nonfederal parties may choose to work with
the appropriate federal trail administrator
to manage their trail properties as part of a
national historic trail.
Congress has established each national
historic trail for the purpose of identifying
and protecting “historic route and its
historic remnants and artifacts for public
use and enjoyment.” At the same time
Congress has established that when deemed
to be in the public interest, “such Secretary
[charged with the administration of a
national historic trail] may enter written
cooperative agreements with the States or
their political subdivisions, landowners,
private organizations, or individuals to
operate, develop, and maintain any portion
of such a trail either within or outside a
federally administered area. Such
agreements may include provisions for
limited financial assistance to encourage
participation in the acquisition, protection,
operation, development, or maintenance of
such trails…”
Partnership certification extends
national trail status to nonfederal trail

resources. Therefore, the purpose of
partnership certification is to allow for
public use and appreciation of nonfederal
trail remnants, artifacts, and interpretive
sites. Partnership certification is not
exclusively for the benefit of the property
owner/manager or even for the sole benefit
of the resource, but for the public as well.
Conditions of certification should include
some allowance for “public use and
enjoyment”—a way for people to experience
parts of the trail that otherwise would be
unavailable for visitation.
Under this alternative, the National
Trails Intermountain Region would make a
special effort to educate private landowners
about the benefits of entering into
partnership certification agreements. It
would encourage owners of high potential
sites and segments, who express an interest,
to participate in this program by providing
management, planning, coordination,
technical assistance, and capacity building.
User Capacity
Several proposed actions under
alternative B, the preferred alternative,
would help to address user capacity. The
development of a flexible database that
would include assessments of resource
conditions as well as images and that would
be updated periodically would greatly assist
the trail community in monitoring
resources. In addition, under this
alternative, volunteer trail stewards for each
county and parish would be identified.
Regularly scheduled monitoring of trail
resources would be one of their main
responsibilities.
TRAIL USE EXPERIENCE
Interpretation/Education
Interpretation and education play a
crucial role in the conservation of resources
central to the trail experience: they offer
visitors the opportunity to forge emotional
and intellectual connections with the
meanings of these resources. Only after
trail users understand the significance of
Page 47

C hapter 2: A lternatives

sites or segments can they truly enjoy and
value them and advocate for their
protection. For that reason, this alternative
places strong emphasis on education and
interpretation programs that aim to raise
awareness about the trail, its history, and its
resources.

were central in the development of the trail.
It is only after understanding the complex
and evolving relationships among the
various ethnic groups who lived along the
trail and used the trail that proper
interpretive and educational programs
about the trail can be developed.

This alternative envisions the
development of a high quality interpretive
program, one that continually explores the
relationship between the resource’s tangible
and intangible meanings and searches for
new ways of providing opportunities for
audiences to make their own intellectual
and emotional connections with these
resources. Interpretation programs offer
trail users ways of making connections
between the physical resources and their
essential meanings—in effect, to
comprehend the relationship between the
tangible and the intangible. For example, a
Spanish mission is clearly a tangible
resource; however, the reasons for its
construction, its relationship to those who
built it and the circumstances surrounding
the building are intangibles. Interpretation
itself may be viewed as a dynamic, flexible,
and goal-driven process, whereby
interpreters use a variety of tools to educate
the public about the resource, engage them,
and help them understand and appreciate it,
and eventually, and most importantly,
commit to its long-term stewardship. By
providing opportunities to connect to the
meanings of resources, interpretive
programs awaken visitors to the importance
of what they see and encourage them to
explore associations with other resources
that they have experienced. Interpretation
helps audiences understand their
relationships to, and their impacts upon,
these resources.

This document recommends the
development of a comprehensive
interpretive plan to improve the
coordination of interpretive and
educational programs.1 This is a long trail,
and its interpretive themes and potential
audiences are complex; therefore, the
development of an interpretive plan should
be a priority. A comprehensive interpretive
plan would help guide the development
and implementation of trailwide education
programs, encourage collaboration, and
avoid costly duplication of efforts. Under
this alternative there would be an effort to
incorporate all of the interpretive themes in
trail interpretation programs and try to
identify the most appropriate locations for
the interpretation of each theme.

The alternative would offer the trail
community the opportunity to become
active participants in the development of
inclusive interpretive and educational
programs that reflect current scholarship
and offer a variety of perspectives. There
would be special emphasis on compelling
stories about people, places, and events,
particularly those that represent the
heritage of the various ethnic groups who
Page 48

Wayside exhibits and signs would be
installed along the trail only at those sites
that require interpretation for user
understanding, enjoyment, and safety. The
National Trails Intermountain Region
would work to ensure that design guidelines
are adopted along the trail to protect the
visual integrity of resources. Some of the
interpretive materials would be bilingual, in
English and Spanish.
This alternative suggests the
development of a focused marketing
program to alert visitors to trail interpretive
programs. Interpretive partnerships among
the trail community would be critical to the
support and/or delivery of interpretive
services. Identification of current and
1 - The Comprehensive Interpretive Plan process is
established in the National Park Service Director’s
Order #6. The basic planning component for
interpretation, the Comprehensive Interpretive Plan is a
tool for making choices. It helps parks and trails decide
what their objectives are, who their audiences are, and
what mix of media and personal services to use. The
product is not the plan, but an effective and efficient
interpretive program that achieves management goals,
provides appropriate services for visitors, and promotes
visitor experiences.

Chapter 2: Alternatives - Alternative B: Trail Development Through Partnerships (Preferred Alternative)

potential partners for interpretation, and
the ways they can support the attainment of
interpretive goals, would support efforts by
staff at the National Trails Intermountain
Region to employ strategic resources to
serve the public and achieve desired
interpretive goals.
The development and implementation of
a wide range of media would be encouraged
in order to engage trail users and to
stimulate interest in El Camino Real de los
Tejas National Historic Trail and its history.
Interpretive media would be distributed at
appropriate locations, with the purpose of
promoting resource stewardship and to
support trail-user safety, as well as their
understanding and awareness of the need to
preserve cultural and natural resources.
Examples of media that could be used are
publications (brochures, reports, and
newsletters), electronic media (websites,
radio broadcasts, cell phone downloads, CD
rentals, and MP3/iPod downloads), wayside
exhibits, audiovisual media, traveling
exhibits, and indoor exhibits associated
with existing museums and visitor centers.
Written media should be presented
bilingually, in English and Spanish. The
National Trails Intermountain Region
would review media and interpretative tools
developed by others.

economic development, where cultural
conservation, building healthy
communities, and environmental
restoration are the goals.
This alternative would support oral
presentations, such as talks, lectures, group
discussions, and living-history
demonstrations at local school and civic
organizations by interpreters, historians,
and by others with profound knowledge of
the history of the trail and of the various
cultural groups that participated in its
development. Museums and visitor centers
interested in interpreting the history of the
trail and in providing a high quality
interpretive experience to trail users would
be given technical assistance in developing
or improving existing programs. (Appendix I,
page 227 and Map 2-1, page 50 identify
already existing facilities in Louisiana
parishes and Texas counties most likely to
participate in this program. The map shows
the names of the communities where the
facilities are currently operating. The
number of such facilities in each community
is indicated in parenthesis.)

An effort would be made to cooperate
with institutions of higher learning to
develop training workshops for educators
interested in teaching trail history.
Residents in communities along the trail
would also be given the opportunity to
learn about and managing natural and
cultural resources, by participating in
programs aimed at residents of all ages,
from early education to higher education
and community and adult education
programs. The team that developed this
Comprehensive Management Plan/
Environmental Assessment envisions the
trail as an “outdoor classroom,” providing a
land-based setting in which to learn the
school curriculum. These educational
experiences would serve as the basis for the
creation of new career and employment
opportunities in the fields of arts and
culture, the environment, and sustainable

Chapter 2: Alternatives - Alternative B: Trail Development Through Partnerships (Preferred Alternative)

RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES
Section 2 (a) of the National Trails
System Act states that trails should be
established,
“to promote the preservation of,
public access to, travel within, and
enjoyment and appreciation of the
open-air, outdoor areas and historic
resources of the Nation.”
Providing memorable recreational
opportunities for visitors while minimizing
visual and physical encroachment is a high
priority of the National Park Service. This
alternative envisions offering a more
meaningful trail user experience through
integrated development and programming
based on authentic resources and trail
themes. Appropriate and consistent trail
signage would facilitate visitor use and
enjoyment of trail resources. A more
profound understanding of significant
trail-related sites and segments and
enhanced cooperative efforts would result in
a more meaningful experience of an entire
array of trail resources. Increased
cooperation among the members of the trail
community would provide a more consistent
and accurate message about the history of
the trail and would make it easier for visitors
to obtain information and to access
numerous sites and segments.
One example of a recreational activity
this alternative would strongly favor is
“trail retracement,” using existing roads
that closely parallel the designated trail
routes and, in some cases, roads built
over the original trail alignment, such as
Louisiana State Road 120 and Texas State
Highway 21. Not only would such an
activity not harm resources, it would
offer visitors the opportunity to engage
intimately with trail resources and
experience vicariously what travel along
the trail might have been like during the
period of significance. It is essential to
provide opportunities for trail audiences
to forge emotional and intellectual
connections with the meanings of these
resources. One of the best ways to
achieve this is by actually traveling along
these routes.

Other sites that may offer some level of
outdoor recreational opportunity include
but are not limited to the San Antonio
Missions National Historical Park Hike and
Bike Trail in San Antonio, Texas, Los Adaes
State Historic Park, in Robeline, Louisiana,
and Mission Tejas State Park in Grapeland,
Texas. Walking, hiking, bicycling,
horseback riding, camping, sightseeing, or
travel by motor vehicle are all potential ways
in which visitors can experience the trail
corridor and its resources.
As part of this alternative, retracement
trails that follow as closely as possible the
historic route could be developed in
cooperation with the trail community. As
stated in the National Trails Systems Act,
such trails are to be built and created for
public use and enjoyment and to connect to
historic route segments. In the case of El
Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic
Trail, such trails would be only built in
public lands or in private properties where
the owners agree to provide public access.
Retracement routes using existing public
roadways and providing access to high
potential sites and segments would be
marked to raise awareness of the trail and
encourage visitation. Agreements would be
signed with local communities to identify
such local routes. It is also possible that the
trail community, in consultation with
National Trails Intermountain Region,
could develop other appropriate recreational
activities that are consistent with the
objectives of the National Trail System Act.
State and local governments, trail
partners, and landowners would be
encouraged to help establish, maintain,
and manage trail remnants, rights-of-ways,
and trail resources for the benefit of the
public. Recreational opportunities and
visitor enjoyment would be enhanced
through increased cooperation among
private landowners, the National Park
Service, and other land managing agencies
along the trail. Recognition through the
National Park Service partnership
certification program would also be
another way for private landowners to
share their resources with the public.
Page 51

C hapter 2: A lternatives

The National Trails Intermountain
Region would support special cultural
events sponsored by the trail community on
authentic trail-related themes, as well as
resource protection issues, trail awareness,
and public involvement.
All trail users would be informed
through written and interpretive materials,
signs, and exhibits about appropriate
behavior practices and protocols to
minimize negative impacts to cultural and
natural resources within the trail corridor
and to maximize safety for trail users.
Partners might want to undertake the
development of additional materials to
enhance the visitor experience of specific
user groups. They could prepare a series of
visitor guides for hikers, equestrians,
bicyclists, etc.
Communities along the trail are
enthusiastic about the potential of the trail
to attract visitors and have expressed strong
interest in the development of a heritage
tourism program. Under this alternative, El
Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic
Trail could become important in regional or
local tourism plans. The National Trails
Intermountain Region would be able to
offer leadership and guidance to those
groups interested in the development of
heritage tourism programs, provided such
programs place major emphasis on resource
authenticity and the dissemination of
information that is historically accurate.
ORIENTATION
Trail Identification: Marker and Signs
Developed during the Comprehensive
Management Plan/Environmental
Assessment process, the official marker
incorporating the logo would be used on
signs marking the designated trail route and
guiding visitor use of the trail (see
Appendix I for sample of trail signs). Care
would be taken to adapt logo use to the
sites’ signing needs. Special care should be
taken to avoid visual clutter, which could
impact the viewshed of the landscape along
the trail. Signs installed at these sites and
segments would identify permitted trail
Page 52

uses, information on safety and protection
of trail users, and adjacent private property.
Trail signs would be presented bilingually,
in English and Spanish, whenever possible.
Information signs, such as safety messages
and property boundary markers, would
also be presented bilingually, in English and
Spanish, whenever possible and
appropriate.
Sign specifications for marking the trail
and use of the logo would be provided by
the National Trails Intermountain Region,
using a conceptual sign plan. This
conceptual sign plan would address the
design, placement, and use of the logo on a
variety of signs, such as highway
information and directional signs, entrance
signs at parking areas, trailhead
information signs, regulatory signs,
directional indicators, interpretive signs
and wayside exhibits, private property
signs, destination signs, and trail-partner
signs. The sign plan would consider using
both the National Trails Intermountain
Region standards on federal lands and
typical approaches on national historic
trails that cross many nonfederal
jurisdictions. Specific signage activities
would be based on sign plans developed at
the local level. All signage and marking
would be dependent on available funding.
To help commemorate the trail’s national
significance, the official marker would be
placed along federal and other managed
trail segments and sites, in compliance with
the sign plan. The National Trails
Intermountain Region would provide the
markers, but local managers on nonfederal
lands would install them. Markers would be
placed on private property only with the
consent of the landowner. Markers would
identify the actual trail for individuals who
want to follow the route. Furthermore, by
indicating the presence of the trail, markers
may help protect the trail landscape from
inadvertent destruction from development.
With the cooperation and assistance of
road-managing agencies, and in compliance
with the sign plan, retracement route signs
would be placed along state and county
roads at appropriate road junctions

Chapter 2: Alternatives - Alternative B: Trail Development Through Partnerships (Preferred Alternative)

(consistent with the sign regulations of the
managing highway department).
Information signs to direct auto users to
local sites or segments may also be used.
COSTS
The implementation of alternative B, the
preferred alternative, would depend not
only on future NPS funding and servicewide priorities, but also on partnership
funds, time, and effort. The approval of
alternative B would not guarantee that the
funding and staffing needed to implement
the plan would be forthcoming; full
implementation could take many years.
Although El Camino Real de los Tejas
National Historic Trail is authorized to
acquire land from willing sellers, no land
acquisition through purchase is anticipated,
and no land acquisition costs are included.
All costs are in 2010 dollars.
Operations
Several members of the staff at the
National Trails Intermountain Region
would have responsibility for carrying out
the provisions of the action alternative.
They include a landscape architect, a
cultural resources specialist, a planner, an
interpretive specialist, a geographic
information system specialist, a tribal
liaison and an outreach coordinator. The
trail superintendent and staff involvement
in the trail would be equivalent to three
full-time positions.
In addition to staff salaries and benefits
operational costs include direct partner
support, travel, office equipment, supplies,
phone, signs, brochures, and publications.

media, signs, and additional needs may be
available through such funding as the
competitive Challenge Cost Share Program,
a yearly appropriation from Congress that
requires partners to provide a minimum of
50% matching contribution in the form of
funds, equipment, in-kind labor, or supplies
from nonfederal sources. However, these
funds may not be available every year and
their amount is likely to fluctuate from year
to year.
However, since alternative B places major
emphasis on partnerships and effective
collaboration, it might be possible to
explore in conjunction with the trail
community additional avenues for funding
that would make possible the full
implementation of this plan.
Funding for technical assistance projects
beyond administrative staff capabilities
would be requested from other appropriate
National Park Service sources.
Funds to develop projects on nonfederal
lands would be sought from state or local
governments or private groups or
individuals, sponsorships, or federal or state
highway enhancement programs, either
directly or in partnerships.
To fund cooperative preservation
efforts for high potential sites and
segments, aid from state and county
preservation fund sources and programs
as well as funds from donations, grants,
and other sources would be sought. Funds
would be used to supplement existing data
about high potential sites and segments
and to stabilize or conduct physical
activities to conserve resources.

Funding
Funding for the annual operating costs
would be provided by the base operating
budget of the National Park Service. To
achieve a minimum base level to implement
this plan the National Trails Intermountain
Region would seek increases in base
funding to meet some of the needs outlined
in this alternative.
Funding for some technical assistance

SUMMARY:
ENVIRONMENTALLY
PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE
HOW THE ACTION ALTERNATIVE
MEETS THE PURPOSE OF THE PLAN
The purpose of this Comprehensive
Management Plan/Environmental
Assessment is twofold: to establish
administrative objectives, policies,
processes, and management guidelines
necessary to fulfill preservation and publicuse goals for El Camino Real de los Tejas
National Historic Trail, as established in the
National Trails Systems Act, and to provide
a framework to be used in making decisions
and solving problems. The preferred
alternative presented in this document
strongly involves state and local agencies, as
well as the entire trail community, in
planning and developing the trail. It
encourages the involvement of private
landowners and fosters trail protection and
interpretation and education programs,
both in the states crossed by the trail and in
developing future activities in collaboration
with Mexican public, nongovernmental
organizations, and academic institutions.
ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERRED
ALTERNATIVE
The National Park Service Director’s
Order # 12 (Section 2.7) requires that an
environmental assessment identify an
environmentally preferred alternative. The
Council on Environmental Quality defines
the environmentally preferred as “the
alternative that will promote the national
environmental policy as expressed in the
National Environmental Policy Act’s
Section 101.” Section 101 of the National
Environmental Policy Act states that it is
the continuing responsibility of the federal
government to:

• Attain the widest range of beneficial
uses of the environment without
degradation, risk of health or safety,
or undesirable and unintended
consequences;
• Preserve important historic, cultural,
and natural aspects of our national
heritage and maintain, wherever
possible, an environment that
supports diversity and variety of
individual choice;
• Achieve a balance between population
and resource use that will permit high
standards of living and a wide sharing
of life’s amenities; and
• Enhance the quality of renewable
resources and approach the maximum
attainable recycling of depletable
resources.
Alternative A, continuation of current
conditions, would minimally meet the
criteria listed above. Alternative B, the
preferred alternative, is the environmentally
preferred alternative because it goes beyond
the no action alternative in attaining the
full range of national environmental policy
goals. It provides a higher level of protection
of cultural and natural resources, while also
proposing a wider range of neutral and
beneficial uses of the environment. This
alternative supports programs that enhance
cultural diversity. It integrates resource
protection with an appropriate and more
diverse range of uses than the no action
alternative.

• Fulfill the responsibilities of each
generation as trustee of the
environment for succeeding
generations;
• Ensure safe, healthy, productive, and
aesthetically and culturally pleasing
surroundings;

Alternative A: Continuation of
Current Conditions (No Action)

Alternative B, Preferred Alternative:
Trail Development Through Partnerships

This alternative, a requirement
of National Environmental Policy
Act, serves as a basis for
comparison. Federal actions
would be limited to those required
under the National Trails System
Act. Its adoption would not mean
that present management activities
would stop, but that the National
Trails Intermountain Region and
on-the-ground site and segment
managers and owners would
respond to future needs and
problems in a manner similar to
the way in which they are
currently operating. Federal
administration would continue as
it is, with levels consistent with
2010 funding.

This alternative encourages and assists
volunteer citizen involvement in the
planning, development, maintenance, and
management of trails. The trail
community encompasses individuals,
entities, institutions, or partners who
share an interest in trail history, authentic
trail resources and their protection as well
as in interpretive and educational
programs, which highlight the
significance of the trail.
Under this alternative, the National
Trails Intermountain Region would not
just address the required authorities
identified in the National Trails System
Act, but it would also be implementing the
discretionary authorities addressed in the
Act, such as the development of
cooperative agreements, support of
volunteers, partnership certification of
significant trail resources, and allowance
for compatible use as necessary or
required by trail partnerships.

Alternative B, Preferred Alternative:
Trail Development Through Partnerships

The National Trails
Intermountain Region would
work closely with state, local
agencies, and volunteers to
implement the purpose of the trail
and other activities as described
by the National Trail System Act.
It would oversee the development
of sign and interpretive standards
and would consult with state and
federal agencies as well as the
owners of resources to avoid
incompatible uses.
Efforts to cooperate with
Mexican entities would be limited
to responding to requests for
information and providing
technical assistance, as feasible,
based on available budgetary and
staff resources.

The National Trails Intermountain
Region would assist the trail community
in achieving the purpose of the trail
designation, which is to commemorate the
development of a network of trails, based
upon American Indian routes that linked
Spanish missions and posts in a travel
corridor from the Río Grande to
Louisiana. Much of the implementation of
strategies would rest with those members
of the trail community, including
volunteers, willing to take the lead in
proposing projects and programs that
identify and protect significant trail
resources and their accurate
interpretation. The National Trails
Intermountain Region would continue
current cooperative agreements and the
signing of other cooperative agreements
with state agencies that manage high
potential sites and segments looking for
more effective project coordination and
use of financial resources. Cooperative
agreements with federally recognized
tribes would also be developed as
appropriate. The National Trails
Intermountain Region would work with
Mexican entities to fulfill the purpose of
the legislation “… exchanging trail
information and research, fostering trail
preservation and educational programs,
providing technical assistance, and
working to establish an international
historic trail with complementary
preservation and education programs in
each nation.”

The National Trails
Intermountain Region
administration would support
projects that aim to protect the
high potential sites and segments
identified in conjunction with the
development of this plan. There
would be limited opportunity for
research projects that explore
topics that have not yet received
adequate attention through the
development of this plan.

Paramount emphasis will be placed on
working with the trail community to
expand knowledge about trail resources,
in particular significant sites and segments
with a degree of historic integrity.
Investigations leading to more accurate
and extensive identification of high
potential sites and segments and their
location, condition and priority needs will
be encouraged. Research projects that aim
to elucidate important aspects of trail
history or topics that have not yet received
adequate attention will also receive special
consideration.

Under this alternative, the
National Trails Intermountain
Region would provide technical
assistance to owners of high
potential sites and segments, who
express an interest to participate in
this program.

Under this alternative the National
Trails Intermountain Region would make a
special effort to educate private
landowners about the benefits of entering
into partnership certification agreements.
It would encourage owners of high
potential sites and segments, who express
an interest, to participate in this program
by providing management, planning,
coordination, technical assistance, and
capacity building.

Efforts would be made to
collaborate with partners to
periodically monitor the condition
of significant trail resources and to
encourage partners to pursue
studies that would provide a greater
understanding of user capacity
issues along the trail.

In addition, for this alternative the
development of a flexible database that
would include assessments of resource
conditions as well as images that would be
updated periodically would greatly assist the
trail community in resource monitoring. In
addition, under this alternative the
volunteer trail stewards for each county and
parish would be responsible for regularly
scheduled monitoring and updating
information on trail resources.

INTERPRETATION/EDUCATION

TRAIL USE EXPERIENCE

The National Trails
Intermountain Region would
encourage local entities to develop
interpretive media and education
programs focusing on the
interpretive themes and high
potential sites and segments
identified in this document. The
media and programs currently
offered to the general public by
various public agencies or private
organizations would continue.
Efforts to provide opportunities for
trail audiences to forge emotional
and intellectual connections with
the meanings of these resources
would be limited, because the
additional research required to
enhance the current interpretive
program would be left to
independent researchers who might
not have the necessary support to
carry out such projects.

This alternative would offer the trail
community the opportunity to become active
participants in the development of inclusive
interpretive and educational programs that
reflect current scholarship and offer a variety
of perspectives. There would be special
emphasis on worthy stories, particularly those
that represent the heritage of the various
ethnic groups who were central in the
development of the trail. It is only after
understanding the complex and evolving
relationship among the various ethnic groups
who lived and used the trail that proper
interpretive and educational programs about
the trail can be developed.
This alternative suggests the development
of an aggressive marketing strategy for
interpretive programs. Partnerships among
the trail community would be critical to the
support and/or delivery of interpretive
services. Identification of current and
potential partners for interpretation, and the
ways they can support the attainment of
interpretive goals, would enhance the
National Trails Intermountain Region’s ability
to strategically use resources to serve the
public and achieve desired interpretive goals.

RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES

TRAIL USE EXPERIENCE, CONTINUED

Existing recreational
opportunities would continue to
be provided at federal and state
parks and facilities along the
route. At present few, if any of
them, provide activities that are
trail related. Trail retracement
along major state highways would
be possible, but would be
dependent on local efforts. Trail
routes following existing public
roadways and providing access to
high potential sites and segments
would be marked to raise
awareness of the trail and
encourage visitation.

This alternative envisions providing a
more meaningful trail user experience
through integrated development and
programming. Trail retracement and
development would enhance
opportunities for public use and
enjoyment of authentic trail resources.
Appropriate and consistent trail signage
would facilitate visitor use and enjoyment
of trail resources. A more profound
understanding of significant trail-related
sites and segments would result in an
added appreciation of the heritage of the
trail. Enhanced cooperative efforts would
result in a more meaningful opportunity
to experience an entire array of trail
resources. Increased cooperation among
the members of the trail community
would provide a more consistent and
accurate message about the history of the
trail and would make it easier for visitors
to obtain information and to access
numerous sites and segments.

TRAIL IDENTIFICATION: MARKER AND SIGNS

ORIENTATION

Page 60

The official marker
incorporating the logo, designed
during the preparation of the
Comprehensive Management
Plan, would be used to mark the
designated trail route along major
state highways, such as State
Highway 21 in Texas and State
Highway 6 in Louisiana, and at
high potential sites and segments
open to the public. Signs installed
at these sites and segments would
identify permitted trail uses,
information on safety and
protection of trail users, and
adjacent private property. Signing
would only be done as resources
permit. The National Trails
Intermountain Region would
pursue no federal funding for
signing.

Sign specifications for marking the trail
and use of the logo will be provided by the
National Trails Intermountain Region
through a sign plan. This sign plan would
address the design, placement and use of
the logo on a variety of signs, such as
highway information and directional
signs, entrance signs at parking areas,
trailhead information signs, regulatory
signs, directional indicators, interpretive
signs and wayside exhibits, private
property signs, destination signs and trail
partner signs. The sign plan would
consider using both the National Trails
Intermountain Region standards on
federal lands and typical approaches on
national historic trails that cross many
nonfederal jurisdictions.

Trail-related ethnographic
resources on private lands could
be impacted by urban
development and could also
continue to be affected by private
projects, such as the construction
of oil and gas pipelines. American
Indian trail routes and associated
resources closely parallel major
state and federal highways, so they
might also be impacted by road
enhancement projects as well as by
increases in agricultural activities
and livestock grazing. This
alternative would add a minor
degree to the overall cumulative
impacts on ethnographic
resources.
Alternative A would have a
minor, long-term, and indirect
adverse impact because of the
limited awareness of the resources
that could be impacted. It would
have negligible effects on
American Indian concerns about
the interpretation of the stories
associated with El Camino Real de
los Tejas National Historic Trail.
Cumulatively, this action would
only add a minor degree of impact
to the overall effect on
ethnographic resources. Resource
impacts would be local, on or near
the trail.

Trail-related ethnographic resources on
private lands would continue to be
impacted by urban development, such as
housing, commercial businesses, and
highways. However, at a minimum greater
awareness of ethnographic resources would
lessen the likelihood of impacts from
nonfederal projects. American Indian trail
routes and associated resources closely
parallel major state and federal highways,
so they would be likely impacted by road
enhancement projects as well as by
increases in agriculture and livestock
grazing. However, this alternative would
result in minor cumulative impacts on
ethnographic resources because greater
awareness of resources would be more
likely to prevent projects that might cause
negative impacts. Alternative B would have
minor, long-term, and indirect beneficial
impacts because there would be greater
awareness of the resources likely to be
impacted. This alternative might have
negligible effects on American Indian
concerns about the interpretation of the
stories associated with El Camino Real de
los Tejas National Historic Trail; however,
the efforts to highlight the contribution of
American Indians to the development of
this trail would bring about more awareness
of the significance of resources and would
be more likely to lead to their protection.
Cumulatively, the minor beneficial effect of
this action on ethnographic resources
would not add impacts to the overall effect
on ethnographic resources. The trail would
bring about more awareness of the
significance of resources and would be
more likely to lead to their protection.
Cumulatively, the minor beneficial effect of

Trail-related archeological
resources on private lands could
be impacted by urban
development. They would also
continue to be affected by private
projects, such as the construction
of oil and gas pipelines. Historic
trail routes and associated
resources closely parallel major
state and federal highways, so they
might also be impacted by road

alternative would incrementally
add a minor degree to the overall
cumulative impacts on
archeological resources. It would
have minor, long-term, and
indirect adverse impacts on
archeological resources because
there would be little awareness of
the existence and location of the
resources. For that reason they
would be more likely to be
impacted. Cumulatively, this
action would only add a minor
degree of impact to the overall
cumulative effect on archeological
resources.

A few trail-related archeological
resources on private lands could be
gradually lost to development; but under
this alternative the losses would be
considerably smaller. Increased
knowledge about trail resources,
heightened awareness of their nature, and
the substantial involvement of volunteers
along the trail—both in the identification
and protection of resources—would
significantly improve the ability to protect
significant trail resources and prevent
their disappearance due to the trends
identified under the cumulative impacts
scenario. This alternative would result in
long-term beneficial minor impacts on
archeological resources because there
would be greater awareness of the
resources likely to be impacted. Increased
knowledge about trail resources and
compliance with Section 106 would result
in beneficial impacts to archeological
resources. Cumulatively, the minor
beneficial effect of this action would only
add a minor degree of impact to the overall

highways. They would also
continue to be affected by private
development, such as the
construction of oil and gas

impact on historic resources
because there would be little
awareness of the resources likely

Trail-related historic resources on
private lands could continue to be

the losses would be considerably smaller.
Increased knowledge about trail
resources, heightened awareness of their
nature, and the substantial involvement of

identification and protection of resources
and in preventing projects that might
cause adverse impacts, would significantly
improve the ability to prevent their
disappearance. This alternative would
result in long-term beneficial minor
cumulative impacts on historic resources.
Alternative B would have minor, longterm, and indirect beneficial impacts on
historic resources because there would be
greater awareness of the resources likely

Natural resources on private
lands could continue to be impacted
by increased urban development
and the construction of oil and gas
pipelines. Trail routes closely
parallel major state and federal
highways, so they would be likely
impacted by a variety of economic
development activities. This
alternative would result in minor,
long-term, and adverse cumulative
impacts on native vegetation.
Alternative A would have a minor,
long-term, and indirect adverse
impact on native vegetation because
there would be little awareness of
the resources likely to be impacted.
Cumulatively, the minor adverse
effect of this action on native
vegetation would only incrementally
add a minor degree of impact to the
overall impact on natural resources.

Heightened awareness of development
opportunities from increased visitation
might result in an expansion of retail trade
and visitor services. However, under this
alternative there would be a greater
understanding of the need to protect the
historic setting of trail resources and this
would minimize the negative impacts of
development associated with expanding
services. The preferred alternative would
cause minor, long-term beneficial, and
indirect effects because the majority of
developers would be more cognizant of the
impacts of their actions on trail resources.
Furthermore, any federal project resulting
directly from the implementation of
Alternative B would undergo site-specific
environmental analysis, and care would be
taken to avoid and minimize impacts to
these resources. Cumulatively, the minor

NATURAL RESOURCES: WILDLIFE

C hapter 2: A lternatives

During the last two centuries,
major changes in wildlife habitat
have occurred throughout the
counties and parishes crossed by
the trail. Agriculture has led to
large areas being converted from
wildlife habitat to croplands and/
or pastures of nonnative grasses.
Timber harvesting for fuel or
lumber has removed the extensive
woodlands that covered the
eastern sections of the trail, and
livestock grazing has reduced
animal densities in some areas and
changed the composition of
animal communities. Extensive
residential, commercial, energy,
and road-associated development
have removed wildlife habitat.
Natural resources on private
lands could continue to be
impacted by increased urban
development and the construction
of oil and gas pipelines. Trail
routes closely parallel major state
and federal highways, so they
would be likely impacted by a
variety of economic development
activities. This alternative would
result in minor, long-term, and
adverse cumulative impacts on
native fauna. Alternative A would
have a minor, long-term, and
indirect adverse impact on wildlife
because there would be little
awareness of the resources likely
to be impacted. Cumulatively, the
minor adverse effect of this action
on native fauna would only
incrementally add a minor degree
of impact to the overall impact on
natural resources.

Because of raised awareness about trail
resources, it is possible that some property
owners might choose not to initiate
activities, such as development or land
clearing, which might impact native
wildlife. In such cases, the impact of this
alternative would be local and beneficial
to natural fauna. Heightened awareness of
development opportunities from
increased visitation might result in an
expansion of retail trade and visitor
services. However, under this alternative
there would be a greater understanding of
the need to protect the historic setting of
trail resources and this would minimize
the negative impacts of development
associated with expanding services. The
preferred alternative would cause minor,
long-term beneficial, and indirect effects
because the majority of developers would
be more cognizant of the impacts of their
actions on trail resources, such as wildlife
habitat. Furthermore, any federal project
resulting directly from the implementation
of Alternative B would undergo sitespecific environmental analysis, and care
would be taken to avoid and minimize
impacts to these resources. Cumulatively,
the minor beneficial effect of this action
would only add a minor degree of impact
to the overall impact on natural wildlife.

VISITOR USE AND EXPERIENCE

Chapter 2: Alternatives - Summary: Environmentally Preferred Alternative

Development projects that aim
to attract large number of visitors,
but that do not consider the need
to retain the historic fabric of
trail-related resources would
detract from a high-quality
experience. Increased urban
growth, including housing,
commercial business, and highway
projects would limit geographical
opportunities of providing a
rewarding trail experience. All
these factors would add a minor
cumulative impact on the visitor
experience.
Under Alternative A developing
an interpretive program and
appropriate visitor access, and
installing trail signs would result
in minor beneficial effects.
Cumulatively, the minor beneficial
effect of this alternative on the
visitor experience would only add
a minor degree of impact to the
overall cumulative effect on the
current visitor use and experience.

The high quality visitor experience that
would result from the implementation of
Alternative B is likely to foster widespread
interest in the trail and its resources
among a broader spectrum of society than
exists at the time this document is being
prepared. Such interest would heighten
awareness of the potential damage that
unrestricted development and changes in
land use could cause to trail resources.
Other projects identified in the cumulative
impact scenario, such as increase in
heritage tourism and increase in websites,
exhibits, and facilities that offer the
opportunity to learn about and appreciate
trail resources, would have minor
beneficial impacts. The preferred
alternative would cause moderate
beneficial effects because a larger and
more diverse audience would be able to
learn about and appreciate trail resources.
Cumulatively, the minor adverse effect of
this action would only add a minor degree
of impact to the overall cumulative effect
on the visitor experience and would result
in moderate, long-term beneficial and
indirect impacts.

LANDOWNERSHIP AND USE

C hapter 2: A lternatives

Several trends identified in the
cumulative impact scenario are
closely associated with
landownership and use. However,
at the time this document is being
prepared, the planning team is not
aware of any specific project that
would have an overall negative
effect on landownership and use
along the trail. Alternative A
would have negligible cumulative
impacts on landownership and
use. Although the participation of
landowners would be voluntary, it
is likely that the trail designation
would raise awareness of issues
associated with the impact of
incompatible land uses on the
trail. No additional impacts on
landownership and use would
result from the implementation of
this alternative. Alternative A
would have minor, beneficial, and
indirect effects on ownership and
use along the trail corridor.

Although increased urban development
would not necessarily decline due to the
trail designation, greater awareness of trail
resources might result in less detectable
changes in land use. The same would be
true for other forms of development
described in the cumulative impact
scenario. Alternative B would encourage
more interest in the protection of
resources along the trail, which could
entail changes in land use and
development trends. These cumulative
impacts would be moderate and beneficial.
The trends identified under the
cumulative impacts scenario have the
potential to impact land use along the
trail. However, at the time this plan is
being prepared there are no specific
development projects being considered
that would have major impacts on
landownership and use. Alternative B
would result in moderate, beneficial, and
indirect cumulative impacts on
landownership and use along the trail.

Several projects identified in
the cumulative impact scenario
have the potential to impact
socioeconomic conditions along
the trail. However, at the time this
document is being prepared, there
is no information on specific
projects that would have any type
of impact on socioeconomic
conditions along the trail. At this
time it is not possible to speculate
on the overall cumulative effect
that these projects would have on
such conditions. Some minor
socioeconomic benefits are likely
to result from trail development
activities, increased visitation, and
government expenditures
associated with the development
of this alternative. Alternative A
would result in minor, long-term,
and indirect beneficial impacts on
socioeconomic conditions along
the trail.

Several projects identified in the
cumulative impact scenario have the
potential to impact socioeconomic
conditions along the trail. However, at the
time this document is being prepared,
there is no information on specific
projects that would have any type of
impact on socioeconomic conditions
along the trail. Implementing this
alternative is likely to strengthen the
regional and state economies through
increased tourism revenues. Increased
visitation to trail-related sites, segments,
and establishments would result in minor
growth in economic activity not only in
those communities along the trail
corridor, but possibly in Texas and
Louisiana as a whole, because visitors
might extend their stay in the trail area if
there are additional opportunities to learn
about natural and cultural history and to
search for the trail. Federal expenditures
would be slightly larger and possibly less
circumscribed geographically. While there
would be a beneficial impact from such
expenditures, it would be minor.

INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this chapter is to
describe the physical, biological, cultural,
and social environments of El Camino
Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail,
including topics that could be affected from
implementing the alternatives described
in the previous chapter. However, this
section of the plan also includes materials
that were identified as important by the
public and the planning team during the
scoping process as well as environmental
background data relevant to readers, site
managers, and trail administrators.
To assist in the preparation of this
section of the Comprehensive Management
Plan/Environmental Assessment, four
studies were completed: 1) an ethnohistory
of the general area encompassed in the
designated routes; 2) an inventory of the
cultural resources in Texas along the
congressionally designated routes; 3) an
inventory of cultural resources in Louisiana
along the congressionally designated
routes; and 4) a data acquisition study
for the major natural resources topics.

CULTURAL RESOURCES
ETHNOGRAPHIC OVERVIEW
American Indian groups were central
to the development of El Camino Real
de los Tejas National Historic Trail
and greatly influenced Spanish efforts
to discourage French intrusion and
to create viable communities. They
continued to play a major role in historical
developments along the trail through
the first half of the 19th century.
The Caddo
The ethnographic landscape the
Spanish encountered, beginning in the
1680s, was highly complex: records of
the early expeditions reveal close to 60
different groups of American Indians.
Chief among them were the Caddospeaking groups in the Neches-Angelina

areas and along the Red River. All Caddo
groups were intimately connected with
El Camino Real de los Tejas; indeed, El
Camino Real de los Tejas was named
after the Tejas (Hasinai). Moreover, the
seat of the Spanish Colonial capital of
Texas occupied the lands of the Adaes
(Adais) and was named after the tribe.
The Caddo lived in farmsteads dispersed
across the landscape but located close to
their agricultural fields. They were unified
by a common language and by a structured
cosmology, which was reflected in the
arrangement of their settlements with
specific locations for places of worship,
burials, and the dwellings of spiritual and
civil leaders. In the 17th and 18th centuries,
Caddo speakers in Texas and Louisiana
were organized in three major groupings,
sometimes called confederacies: the
Hasinai, Kadohadacho, and Natchitoches.
In their reports and correspondence,
Spanish missionaries described the Hasinai
Supreme Being, the Ayo-Caddi-Aymay, and
the hierarchical system of religious and
political leadership in a village, represented
by a high priest (xinesí), a number of
village leaders (caddices), and a council of
elders (canahas). Caddices and cahanas
were associated with specific Hasinai
communities, but the xinesi exercised
overall spiritual authority over most of
the Hasinai. The xinesi superseded others
whose functions included medicine men
or shamans (conna), town criers (tanmas),
and warriors (amayxovas), whose practices
were important to the daily activities of the
Hasinai. The xinesi established, maintained,
and monitored communications between
human beings and the spiritual realm and
was responsible for ceremonies and objects
designed to guarantee the well-being of the
Hasinai in all its aspects; the xinesi was the
unifying element in Hasinai communities.
This religious/political hierarchy was
supported by the commoners through
a well-organized system of reciprocal
exchange between members of the human
community and spiritual beings. This
Page 73

C hapter 3: A ffected E nvironment

interweaving of daily activities with
spiritual ones, as well as a traditional
settlement pattern that included productive
farms, ceremonial centers, and burial
grounds, made it difficult for Hasinai
communities to accept the conditions
the friars wanted to impose on them.
Not only were the Hasinai expected to
accept a different religion, but they were
also required to congregate in pueblos,
or villages, and change the physical
arrangement of their settlements. At the
end of the 17th century, the Hasinai had not
accepted these Spanish-imposed changes.
Caddo groups maintained social, political,
and trade relationships with other native
groups and with the French and the Spanish
government forces throughout the colonial
period. Trade connections extended
well beyond the modern boundaries of
Texas and Louisiana. Inquiries made by
Spanish authorities after the attack on San
Sabá mission uncovered the widespread
smuggling of weapons and ammunition
along El Camino Real de los Tejas, an
illegal trade of which military officials were
fully aware, and indeed, from which they
profited. These official Spanish inquiries, as
well as the earlier arrest of French traders at
the mouth of the Trinity River in 1754, made
clear to government officials that, in order
to have and keep the friendship of native
groups, they either had to close their eyes
to the contraband or compete against it.
From the late 1760s onward, by order
of the Spanish Crown, Spain changed
its colonizing tactics and implemented a
policy of gift giving to the native tribes,
which simultaneously provided goods
for trade while binding the recipient to
reciprocity obligations. The presence of
Anglo-American traders in Louisiana
and in Texas complicated Spanish
relations with native people though.
This was particularly true after France
ceded Louisiana to Spain in 1762.
In 1778, Frenchman Athanase de
Mézières, lieutenant governor of Louisiana,
was appointed by Spanish authorities
to manage gift giving and trade and to
control contraband. The Caddo, Bidai,
Page 74

Comanche, Taovaya, Tawakoni, Wichita,
and other Indian tribes participated in this
trade, which was centered in Natchitoches
and involved both French and Spanish
traders as well as Anglo-Americans. The
following year, de Mézières traveled
along El Camino Real to visit most of
the Indian tribes involved. His goal was
to ascertain the condition of the tribes
following a devastating epidemic in 1777,
elicit their goodwill, and evaluate the
extent of the trade. During this journey,
de Mézières noted the remarkable
Indian mounds east of the Neches River.
He crossed the river and visited the
village of San Pedro de los Nabedachos,
already important historically, as it was
the site of the first mission in Texas.
The large number of gifts given to
the Caddo and other tribes only added
to the vibrant underground economy,
which developed first with the acquisition
of contraband and swelled with the
introduction of gift giving. By the end
of the 1700s, there was little distinction
between either practice. Spanish settlers
and soldiers continued to visit the
Caddo villages between San Antonio
and Nacogdoches, and the movement of
goods and people probably intensified
considerably from the 1760s to the 1780s.
In 1773, in an effort to limit the
underground economy, Spain closed the
mission and presidio of Los Adaes and
moved the seat of government to San
Antonio. Despite this action, the following
year Spanish authorities noted that French
traders continued to trade in guns, powder,
and balls, and owed their suppliers more
than 600 horses. The increased Caddo
dependence upon the Spanish could not
have come at a worse time. Weakened by
epidemics and the continued wars with
the Osage, their ancestral enemies, Caddo
groups were forced to regroup and seek
alliances, but they were still unable to
mount an effective attack against the Osage.
Throughout the late 1770s, some
Caddo groups sought an alliance with
the Apache. In spite of old and ingrained
enmities, their mutual interest in trade

Chapter 3: Affected Environment - Ethnographic Overview

items, particularly guns and ammunition,
which the Apache needed and the Caddos
could supply, made an alliance increasingly
likely. New Spain was vehemently opposed.
In 1780, Domingo Cabello, governor of
Texas, held a meeting with the Hasinai at
Presidio La Bahía. When the Lipan Apache
arrived, aiming to hold peace talks with
the Hasinai, Cabello refused to allow the
Apache inside the fort. Barred from entry,
the Lipans shouted over the walls that
they would give the Hasinai horses, guns,
even women in exchange for an alliance.
Notwithstanding Spanish efforts, in 1782,
the Apache and Hasinai made a peace
agreement, and soon after, a huge trade
fair was held on the Guadalupe River, at
which the Apaches traded 1,000 Spanish
horses to a group of Tonkawas, Hasinais,
Bidais, and others in return for 270 guns.
Trade with the Apache continued for the
next four years, but the Spanish authorities
were determined to stop it. Spain tried
several different approaches, even halting
the gift giving until the Caddo groups gave
in. Harassed by the Osage and diminished
in numbers by epidemics and conflict,
the Kadohadacho moved south to Caddo
Lake in 1800; however, most of the other
Caddo-speaking groups remained in their
homelands until their final removal in 1859.
Nomadic American Indian Tribes
The story of nomadic Indian groups
along El Camino Real de los Tejas National
Historic Trail is equally complex. The
information obtained from archival
sources and supported by archeological
studies indicates that most indigenous
groups subsisted by hunting and gathering,
traveling through vast expanses of land,
and using widely dispersed native plants
and animals. The historical evidence
indicates that geographic and resource
areas were recognized by individual tribal
groups and that sanctions were applied
to trespassers, not so much due to the
violation of geographical borders but
because land resources were used without
permission. Some areas can be assumed
to be part of a native group’s territory

due to historical reports of repeated
encounters with that group in the same
general area and, sometimes, because of
specific statements made by travelers. Two
obvious cases are the Paquache, who were
consistently encountered between the
Nueces and Frío rivers, and the Payaya, who
were repeatedly found in the greater San
Antonio area. It is hard to match up native
groups and territories along El Camino
Real de los Tejas National Historical Trail
with complete certainty: tribal members
may have just been visiting certain
regions and their land-use territories may
have been located far from trail routes,
despite encounters with Europeans.
The historical and archeological data
suggest that these groups were organized
into small to medium-sized bands of 25 to
50 people, although some appear to have
included 300 to 500 people. These groups,
comprised of extended families related
by blood or marriage, scheduled their
gatherings to trade, to prepare for war and
make war alliances, to perform ceremonies,
to find mates, and to socialize in general,
at times and places where food resources
were known or expected to be abundant
during different seasons of the year.
Obviously, these were times when there
were many mouths to feed, but it is also
clear that some of the resources were to be
used by those going to war and to guarantee
the welfare of those staying behind.
Although little is known about the social
organization of these hunting and gathering
groups in Texas, the evidence indicates that
spokespersons, generally male, represented
and acted in the name of the group and, in
some cases, also were prominent warriors.
Male, and possibly female, shamans were
engaged in healing and mediation rituals.
Shamans were the mediators between
human beings and the spiritual world.
As part of curing ceremonies they used
natural objects, such as plants for infusions
and stones to which special powers were
attributed. Curing and removal of malefic
objects located in the body was facilitated
by blowing over the affected area, laying
on hands and sucking out objects such
as stones, arrows, and hair that had
Page 75

C hapter 3: A ffected E nvironment

penetrated the body and were supposed
to have caused the disease. Shamans were
reimbursed for their services. They could
be killed if the patient did not recover or if
it was thought that the shaman was at fault.
Women raised children; gathered food,
water, and wood; and often engaged in
trading. There is evidence that, in some
cases, women acted as peace negotiators.
The roles of warrior and hunter were very
important to the stability and defense
of the group, as well as to the balance of
relations with other groups. But the role of
women as procreators and nurturers was
essential. Information on child rearing and
the roles children played in society is scant.
Nomadic hunter-gatherer groups set
up temporary camps known as rancherías,
where dwellings were generally made of
bent poles or tree limbs, covered with
brush and bison or deer pelts. Most of
the evidence related to these rancherías is
associated with the harvest and seasonal
native use of specific resources, such as
the fruit of the prickly pear, mesquite
beans, mescal, wild berries, and nuts, such
as pecans and acorns. Faunal resources,
such as bison and deer, were procured
at specific times of the year. They were
important not just as sources of meat,
marrow, and fat and pelts for clothing,
shoes, and dwelling covers but also for
glue to haft projectile points, and for other
uses. Floral and faunal resources that
were available only at specific times of the
year and in specific locations required
the timely arrival of native groups to
harvest them, and native groups scheduled
their movements and programmed their
subsistence rounds to profit from those
resources. The nomadic groups in Texas
and Louisiana complemented their diets
with small mammals, rodents, birds,
snakes, snails, turtles, freshwater fish,
shellfish, insects, birds’ eggs, and other
animal protein sources, which were
generally available throughout the year and
not concentrated in geographical patches.
Like inland bands, hunter-gatherer
groups living along the coast of the Gulf
of Mexico also procured deer, and bison,
Page 76

and native plants seasonally, but they also
benefited from being able to rely on an
abundant marine and estuary resource
base that provided water roots, fish,
shellfish, and sea mammals. Temporary
camps used by coastal groups have been
uncovered that reflect seasonal travel
between the coast and the mainland to
obtain resources. Native groups living
along the Gulf Coast often built atop large
shell mounds, which had accumulated over
years of shellfish and shell consumption.
The archeological evidence indicates
that significant changes took place in the
centuries prior to European arrival (the
Proto-historic or Late Prehistoric period),
although the overall patterns of resource
selection and resource utilization did not
vary much between the Proto-historic
period and the arrival of Europeans.
Other American Indian Tribes
At other times, several other American
Indian groups occupied the territory
traversed by the trail. Among them
are the Alabama-Coushatta, Apache,
Bidai, Cherokee, Choctaw, Comanche,
Delaware, Karankawa, Kickapoo, Kiowa,
Seminole, Shawnee, and Tonkawa tribes.
The Alabama-Coushatta
The Alabama-Coushatta were part of the
mound-building cultures of the Southeast,
which included the Creeks, Cherokees,
Caddo, Natchez, Choctaw, Muscogee,
and others. All of these tribes shared a
common religion, with the same basic
beliefs, ceremonies, and traditions, but each
tribe interpreted it slightly differently.
The record of the first contact with the
Alabama people comes from the Hernando
de Soto Expedition in 1641. Hernando de
Soto came upon the “Alibamo” tribe in
central Mississippi and attacked and killed
many of them in a fierce battle. Later the
Alabama people moved east, to present-day
Alabama, where they lived at the junction
of the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers. De
Soto also found the Coushata living along
the Tennessee River. By the 1780s, pressure

Chapter 3: Affected Environment - Ethnographic Overview

on their lands from westward-migrating
Americans forced the Alabama to move
back west across the Mississippi River, into
the Opelousa area of Louisiana. Around
1803, they moved west again, across the
Sabine River into north East Texas.
In 1805, approximately 1,000
Alabamas came to Tyler County’s Peach
Tree Village. The Coushattas were
already in East Texas, having arrived
into the Big Thicket area sometime
after 1795. Their intertribal friendship
became even stronger as they roamed
and hunted this new land together.
Although the Republic of Texas
Congress had granted each tribe two
leagues of land along the Trinity River
in 1840, their land was soon taken over
by white settlers, leaving them homeless.
In 1853, the Texas legislature purchased
1,110 acres for the Alabamas. Two years
later (1855), it set aside 640 acres for the
Coushattas. However, the land allocated
for the Coushattas was never plotted or
surveyed, but either through marriage
or special permission, Coushattas ended
up moving onto Alabama territory,
and eventually the tribe became
known as the Alabama-Coushatta.
The Apache
Apaches had been present in the modern
territory of Texas since the 1680s, but
had remained mostly in or above the Hill
Country until the Europeans settled San
Antonio. That settlement, and the enhanced
Spanish presence, affirmed Spanish
intentions of colonization, particularly
after the Aguayo Expedition in 1721, and
frequently engendered violent Apache
reactions. The Apache put Spanish settlers
on notice when they left arrow shafts with
red flags attached to them in the ground
near San Antonio Presidio. Beginning in
the 1720s, Apache groups, particularly the
Lipan Apache, began attacking mule-train
convoys along El Camino Real de los Tejas,
successfully raiding the livestock herds of
the missions and threatening San Antonio.
As a result, travel along the trail became
increasingly dangerous, particularly

between the Río Grande and San Antonio.
Apache groups were displeased with
the increased Spanish presence but took
full advantage of raids on European
supply convoys along El Camino Real
de los Tejas to seize coveted horses and
items to trade. European goods and local
products sustained a native exchange
and trade economy, which maintained
a network of connections and alliances
among groups and enhanced the
prestige of individuals involved in it.
Conversely, attacks on convoys along El
Camino Real de los Tejas killed or angered
the Spanish settlers as well as taking a
toll on native groups. The Apache were
always viewed as the principal foe of the
missions and settlers who were engaged
in what has been called la guerra de la
pulga (the war of the flea). The Apache
utilized guerrilla-war strategies that used
the main arteries of communication and
travel corridors, such as El Camino Real de
los Tejas, to counterbalance the superior
military power of the colonizers. Local
Apache successes enhanced their prestige
among other Apache groups and made
them doubly feared by the local native
groups, whose small numbers and lack
of skill in warfare made them vulnerable
to both the Apache and the Spanish.
In the 1720s and 1730s, Apache attacks in
San Antonio and along El Camino Real de
los Tejas led the military and the citizenry
to conduct punitive counterattacks on
Apache raiders. These punitive expeditions
resulted in considerable booty in pelts,
saddles, iron implements, and horses.
In this way, horses presumably stolen in
Apache raids along El Camino Real de
los Tejas were returned to San Antonio.
These raids also brought Apache slaves
to San Antonio, mostly women and
children who either served the Spanish
as domestic and field help or were taken
along El Camino Real de los Tejas to be
traded south of the Río Grande to Mexico.
The pattern of Apache raids and Spanish
punitive counterattacks was interspersed
with peace negotiations, often initiated
and mediated by Apache women. The
Page 77

C hapter 3: A ffected E nvironment

Spanish used Apache hostages to press the
Apache into peace treaties; however, the
policy was ill advised and not successful
until the 1740s, when the Apache felt
squeezed between the Comanche from
the north and the Spanish in the south.
The pattern of use, enslavement, or
“adoption” of Apache women and children
by Spaniards continued into the late 1700s.
Even as the San Antonio missions
suffered Apache hit-and-run attacks
and the loss of cattle, goats, sheep, and
horses, they gained new converts from
local native groups, who joined forces
with Spanish settlers against their mutual
enemy. Between 1746 and 1752, the three San
Xavier missions on the San Gabriel River,
near present-day Rockdale, Texas, were
founded in this way. The location of these
missions on good buffalo hunting grounds
further angered the Apache, who began
harassing the native populations even
before the missions were built. It is ironic,
then, that property from the San Xavier
missions, which were abandoned in 1752,
was used to help establish the Nueces River
missions for the Apache at El Cañón in Real
County in 1762, following a peace treaty.
Earlier attempts were made to establish
missions for the Apache on the south side
of the Río Grande (1754) and at San Sabá
(1757–1758), but only the later Upper Nueces
missions were marginally successful.
The Bidai
The Bidai people lived along the lower
Trinity River, south of El Camino Real de
los Tejas, and were a friendly group. They
traded with the Hasinai over the Bidai Trail,
which led from the lower Trinity River to
the vicinity of Nacogdoches. The Bidai had
sporadic relations with the Karankawa
groups, especially the Coco, as well as
with the Tonkawa, the Wichita groups, the
Comanche, and with the Lipan Apache,
with whom they traded. Later on, the Bidai
apparently intermarried with Coushatta
people living along the Trinity River.
When Stephen F. Austin established
his colony on the lower Brazos River in
the early 1820s, the Bidai often mingled
Page 78

with the American settlers asking for
food. Subsequently, the Bidai experienced
great difficulties and suffered at least
one major typhoid fever epidemic. In
1836, they were once again receiving
gifts from Anglo-Americans.
The Cherokee
The Cherokee moved into Texas
during the early 19th century. In 1822,
they traveled to San Antonio to sign an
agreement with the Mexican governor
of Texas José Felix Trespalacios and
obtained permission to settle in Texas. In
1836, they met with Sam Houston to sign a
treaty requesting formal title to the lands
they occupied. At that time, they resided
along the Angelina, Neches, and Sabine
rivers near Nacogdoches, and appeared
interested in taking the lead in forming
a union of different tribes in Texas.
Unfortunately, frictions with European
settlers and concern about the Cherokee’s
influence on other smaller tribes led
the senate of the Republic of Texas to
nullify the treaty. Three years later, the
Texan government had still not ratified
Cherokee claims, and it became clear that
the tribe would be removed from Texas
territory. In July 1839, President Mirabeau
Lamar dispatched 900 soldiers to the
Cherokee village. After a battle that left
100 Cherokee and two Texas soldiers dead,
the Cherokee fled to Indian Territory.
The Choctaw
The first few Choctaw people in Texas
settled among the Caddo-speaking group
in 1807, when John Sibley brokered a peace
agreement between representatives of the
two tribes. Permission was given, despite
deep-seated resentments and unresolved
conflicts between the two tribes.
After 1819, the United States pressured
the rest of the Choctaw to move
westward from their original homelands
in Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia
to Indian Territory in Arkansas and
Oklahoma. The Choctaw were the first of
the Southeast’s Five Civilized Tribes (the

Chapter 3: Affected Environment - Ethnographic Overview

Choctaw, Cherokee, Chickasaw, Creek,
and Seminole) to be removed to Indian
Territory along what came to be known
as the Trail of Tears. By 1836, the year the
Choctaw signed a treaty with the Republic
of Texas, around 40 Choctaw and some
Chickasaw had been living in Nacogdoches
and Shelby counties for about two years.
The majority of the Choctaw, however,
never moved to Texas and remained on
Choctaw Nation lands in Indian Territory.
Any problems between settlers and the
Choctaw usually involved depredations by
Texas troops or citizens crossing north of
the Red River onto Choctaw Nation lands.
The Comanche
The Comanche began their forays
into north and central Texas in late 1729
in an effort to displace the Apache from
the southern plains and north-central
Texas. Comanche economic life was
centered on the buffalo, which they
hunted, processed in great quantities,
and bartered for any other products they
required. The acquisition of horses and
guns from Europeans enhanced Comanche
prowess on the battlefield, enabling them
to obtain war booty and more guns and
horses and become a formidable force.
During the early period, Spanish
Colonial settlers felt the impact of the
Comanche presence indirectly, mostly
through increased Apache activity, but
the 1758 attack on Mission San Sabá
changed the situation. The dominance
of the Comanche, multiplied by alliances
with the Tejas, Taovaya, and Wichita
tribes, changed the power dynamics in
the territory surrounding El Camino
Real de los Tejas. In the 1760s and 1770s,
a succession of attacks by the Comanche
and allied tribes on the Apache during
buffalo hunts, as well as on the Nueces
River missions, effectively positioned
the Comanche to play a central role in
political affairs. As a rule, the Comanche
preferred to remain above the Red River.
There is little evidence of their presence
along El Camino Real de Tejas, except
when they came to San Antonio to trade

or meet with the Spanish officials, when
they would frequently raid horse herds at
the Bexar settlement and the missions.
Comanche raids often resulted in
the kidnapping of Spanish women and
children. In the fall of 1773, the Comanche
mounted one of the largest and fiercest
raids ever experienced by the settlement of
Bexar. Raids on Laredo during the same
year added 350 horses to the Comanche
spoils. The hit-and-run attacks continued,
often targeting ranches along the Río
Grande and the presidio of San Juan
Bautista. In 1778–1779, the Comanche set
their sights on the Bucareli settlement on
the Trinity River. Successive Comanche
attacks, along with the devastation
caused by a 1777 epidemic and a flood,
led to Bucareli’s abandonment.
In the 1780s, the Comanche established
rancherías on the Medina River, north
of Bexar, and at Arroyo Blanco on the
Guadalupe River. These rancherías were
part of a new strategy that connected the
Comanche with the Texas road network
and commerce along those roads. Even so,
most Comanche remained in North Texas.
Multiple attempts to establish an
enduring peace with the Comanche were
only partially successful. The Comanche
promised they would refrain from attacking
settlements and taking horses only to
repeat the depredations. For instance,
during peace treaty negotiations in 1785,
Comanche chiefs promised to stop raiding,
but only after two raiding parties stole
horses from San Antonio and La Bahía.
After the treaty was signed, the Spanish
supplied gifts to the Comanche. This
established a regular routine, whereby
Comanche groups often came to Bexar
to collect their gifts, traveling across
portions of El Camino Real de los Tejas,
and often raiding the outlying settlements.
Kavanagh (1999) has pointed out that
warfare was embedded in the Comanche
social structure and way of living.
While the 1785 peace treaty reduced the
Comanche threat for Texas settlements,
it did not eliminate it, and confrontations
between Spanish settlers and the
Page 79

C hapter 3: A ffected E nvironment

Comanche continued into the 1790s.
During the revolutionary events of the
early 19th century, including the Hidalgo
revolt in 1810 and the Gutiérrez-Magee
revolt in 1812–1813, the Comanche played
all sides off one another and benefited
from trade with the Anglo-Americans who
were moving in from the East. Kavanagh
(1999) points out that, between 1786 and
1820, the Comanche prospered as never
before, expanding their range from Santa
Fe to San Antonio and from Natchitoches
to Chihuahua; however, the chaos of
the collapse of the Spanish empire and
the advance of the Anglo-Americans
altered their way of life considerably.
During the Mexican period, Comanche
attacks throughout Texas and Mexico led
to the 1822 treaty between the Comanche
and the Mexican government. During the
negotiations, one of the Mexican officials
stated that the Comanche’s wealth was in
“good horses and arms” and that in their
trade they had made “a well worn road
through the unsettled regions towards
Natchitoches.” By 1825, the conditions of
the treaty had already been violated, and
fear and unrest reigned among settlers.
During the following decades, the
Comanche were either friends or foes,
depending on the time and place. For
instance, the Comanche were considered
important allies in the struggle between
Mexico and the Anglo-Americans who
revolted against Mexican President
Antonio López de Santa Anna in 1835,
but they were feared foes when, in 1836,
they attacked the caravan of settlers
from Villa Dolores Colony on the Río
Grande. These settlers had abandoned
their colony precisely because of rumors
of an impending Comanche attack.
The political changes in Texas and the
establishment of the empresario colonies
led to increased friction between Anglo
and European colonists and American
Indian tribes. In 1838, another peace treaty
was signed with the Comanche aimed at
protecting the new colonists. Central to
the peace treaty was a Comanche request
that a demarcating line be established,
Page 80

dividing American Indian territory from
the region southward occupied by the
colonists. According to the wishes of the
Comanche, this line was to run between
the Hill Country and San Antonio, to allow
the tribe to hunt buffalo. However, the
creation of such a demarcating line was not
in the interest or the plans of the citizenry,
particularly the new colonists, and the issue
was postponed indefinitely. The treaty
languished until, finally, at the 1844 Council
at the Falls-of-the-Brazos, the Comanche
and other groups informed Sam Houston,
president of the Republic of Texas, that
they would not accept the conditions of the
treaty without the promised demarcation
line. The treaty was signed on October
9, 1844, but no line was established. In
1847, the Society of German Noblemen
purchased the Fisher-Miller empresario
land grant, and surveyors entered
Comanche hunting grounds. Despite
agreements and promises of gifts, the
Comanche held their ground and continued
to oppose the extension of the settlement.
As settlers encroached further on
native lands, they competed for resources
and conflicts multiplied. In January
1840, a group of Comanche traveled to
San Antonio, presumably to trade, and
became embroiled in what became known
as the Council House Fight—a violent
conflict that became deeply etched in
the memories of the Comanche and the
citizens of Bexar. The preponderance
of conflicts signaled the reluctance of
Comanche and citizens alike to abide by
agreements. In August, the Comanche
attacked Victoria and Linneville; in
turn, the Comanche were attacked near
Lockhart and lost many warriors.
The Delaware
Some members of the Delaware tribe
moved into Texas in the early 19th century
and lived near the Shawnee; however, by
the 1820s, most of them had moved onto
the Brazos Reserve among the Caddo. In
1836, the Delaware signed a treaty with
Texas that placed them on Cherokee land.
When combined with the Shawnee, they

Chapter 3: Affected Environment - Ethnographic Overview

were said to number 500 people. In general,
the Delaware and the Shawnee managed
to avoid conflicts with the white settlers.
In 1842, fears of alliances between the
Mexican government and several native
tribes, including the Delaware and the
Shawnee, increased. The following year,
representatives of both tribes met at the
Tehuacana Indian Council. Roasting Ear,
the Delaware chief, delivered the opening
statement, followed by Linney, the Shawnee
chief. In September of the same year,
these tribes signed a peace treaty with
the Republic of Texas. As interpreters,
guides, trackers, pack drivers, warriors,
and hunters, the Delaware traversed a
broad territorial expanse. Their presence
is mentioned from the Río Grande to the
Canadian River, as they were heavy users
of the network of roads that became El
Camino Real de los Tejas. In the 1850s, the
few Delaware who remained in Texas were
on the Brazos Reserve, among the Caddo
and the Wichita, and in 1859, they moved
to Indian Territory with those groups.
The Karankawa
The name Karankawa (Carancagua)
identifies a specific Texas coastal group,
but it is often used to include five different
groups: the Karankawa proper, the Coco,
the Cujane, the Guapite, and the Copane.
These groups likely spoke dialects of the
same language, and the Karankawa proper
and the Coco apparently spoke the same
language. The Karankawa language has
not been linked to any other language
family. Some of these coastal groups also
had friendly relations with the Akokisa
(Orcoquisa) and the Atakapa who also
lived farther to the east, on the coastal
area. None of these groups were in the
vicinity of El Camino Real de los Tejas, but
they had had close interactions with the
Spanish since the expedition of 1689 that
searched for La Salle’s settlement. During
that expedition, Alonso de León traveled to
Garcitas Creek, explored Matagorda Bay,
and reported seeing native rancherías, likely
belonging to any of the groups subsumed
under the designation of Karankawa.

In 1721, the Spanish founded the
Presidio of Nuestra Señora de Loreto
on Garcitas Creek, on the former site of
Fort St. Louis. Across the creek the next
year, the Franciscans established Mission
Nuestra Señora del Espiritu Santo de
Zuñiga hoping to attract coastal groups.
In 1726, the mission was moved inland
to the Guadalupe River, then moved again,
in 1749, to the San Antonio River at modern
Goliad. In 1745, when the Franciscans
founded the missions on the San Gabriel
River (San Xavier Missions), the Coco
were one of the groups at the missions.
In 1754, the Franciscans established
Mission Nuestra Señora del Rosario for the
Cujane. Four years later, 21 natives had been
baptized but all in artículo mortis (on their
deathbed). The coastal missions owned
large livestock herds and were raided by
native groups, including the Karankawa,
who took horses and cattle. During the
1770s and 1780s, the Karankawa were
particularly active in raiding and were said
to be well armed. They were involved in
trade with other coastal groups, such as the
Orcoquisa, as well as with inland groups.
In 1774, the Coco and the Karankawa were
living near the mouth of the Trinity River,
where French and English settlers came
to trade for horses and mules stolen from
Presidio La Bahía. In 1780, General Teodoro
de Croix commented that the Karankawa
where living on the mainland and on the
nearby islands and that they deserved to
be exterminated because of their cruelty.
By the 1780s, Mission Rosario was
abandoned, partly because of attacks
and raids on the livestock and partly
because of native revolts. In 1791, the
Franciscans established Mission Nuestra
Señora del Refugio as a last effort to
convert the Karankawa. Circumstances
had changed. This time the Karankawa
accepted the coastal mission, viewing it
as a refuge, a useful location for fishing in
time of need, and because it was far from
their enemies, the Comanche. During
the 1790s, the Karankawa appeared
consistently in Mission Refugio censuses.
In the early 1800s, the Karankawa,

Coco, and Cujane were still mentioned
in the records, but many perished in
conflicts with the white settlers.
The Keechi
The Keechi lived in the Red River area
in the first decades of the 18th century
and were mentioned as early as 1687 as
Caddo allies. In 1745, Fr. Xavier Ortiz
placed the Keechi in the area of the upper
Trinity, Brazos, and Red River areas. In
1770, Athanase de Mézières visited the
Kadohadacho on the Natchitoches River
and met the chiefs of several Nations
of the North (Norteños), including
the Keechi. The following year, they
signed a treaty with the Spanish.
In 1772, de Mézières visited the Keechi
village on the Upper Brazos and Trinity
rivers. De Mézières reported that the
Keechi traded buffalo and deer skins
for guns and ammunition with the
inhabitants of Natchitoches. He also
noted that the Keechi had only played a
small role in the hostilities waged against
the presidios although they had taken
part in the Mission San Sabá attack. In
1775, de Mézières followed El Camino
Real de los Tejas from Nacogdoches, left
the highway at Bucareli, and reached the
Keechi village on the Trinity River, near
modern Palestine, Texas. During the first
decades of the 19th century, the Keechi
maintained their association with the
Cadohadacho, traded at Nacogdoches,
and remained east of the Trinity River.
In 1843, the Keechi were present at
the Tehuacana Creek Council. They
signed a peace agreement with the
Republic of Texas, as part of the Wichita
confederation under the leadership of
A-cah-quash, the Waco chief. In 1846,
the Keechi signed the Treaty of Council
Springs, which placed them under the
protection of the United States. Frictions
with settlers and Keechi horse stealing
led to several confrontations. In 1850,
200 Keechi moved to Indian Territory,
where they settled near the confluence of
the Canadian River and Choteau Creek.
Finally, in 1859, the remaining Keechi
Page 82

were removed to Indian Territory as part
of the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes.
The Kickapoo
After ceding their native lands in Illinois
in 1819, a large number of Kickapoo moved
to Texas, where they lived among the
Cherokee until 1839, when the Cherokee
were forced to leave. Stephen F. Austin’s
1829 map shows the Kickapoo on the
Upper Trinity River. In February 1836,
the Kickapoo signed a peace treaty with
Texas, but after it became known that the
Kickapoo sided with Mexico, relations
with the fledgling republic broke down.
Late that year, after the Kadohadacho
and Kickapoo had attacked settlements
on the Brazos River, Texas Rangers
mounted a successful attack against them
on Elm Creek, east of Austin. In 1839,
when Mirabeau Lamar ordered that the
Kickapoo be removed from Texas, many of
the Kickapoo fled to Matamoros, Mexico,
and later to Morelos in Coahuila province.
Some Kickapoo joined the Seminole
leader Wild Cat’s Mexican settlement.
They were granted lands on condition
that they join the Mexican Army, which
required them to fight the Apache, the
Comanche, and others. Unhappy with
the conditions of the agreement, these
Kickapoo crossed the border at Eagle Pass
and returned to Kansas, with only a few
remaining in Morelos. Today, the Kickapoo
Traditional Tribe of Texas lives on a small
reservation immediately south of Eagle
Pass on the Río Grande. These Kickapoo
are the descendants of tribal members who
returned to Texas from Kansas in 1864.
Like the Delaware and Shawnee, the
Kickapoo were employed as interpreters,
guides, scouts, and hunters. In the 1840s,
Kickapoo parties were sometimes reported
hunting in Texas. In 1848, Commissioner
George W. Bonnell’s survey of American
Indians listed 1,200 Kickapoo.
The Kiowa
Spanish sources place the Kiowa in the
central plains in the first decades of the

Chapter 3: Affected Environment - Ethnographic Overview

18th century and in the southern plains
at the beginning of the 19th century.
According to J. H. Gunnerson and D. A.
Gunnerson, the Plains Apache joined the
Kiowa sometime around 1700. As a band
of the Kiowa, the Kiowa-Apache (still
often called the Plains Apache) moved
onto the southern plains in the late 18th
century. In 1806, perhaps earlier, the Kiowa
allied with the Comanche; the KiowaComanche alliance persisted into the
reservation period of the late 19th century.

largest native group in Texas in terms of
population. Regarding several groups,
including the Kiowa, Neighbors also stated
that “our intercourse has been extremely
limited, for the want of proper means.”
Kiowa relationship connections with El
Camino Real de los Tejas appear to be
slight, although their relationships with
the Comanche and the Wichita groups
complicate the issue. Today, the Kiowa live
near Carnegie in Caddo County, Oklahoma.

Throughout the late 18th and beginning
of the 19th centuries, the Kiowa remained
mostly north of the Red and Arkansas
rivers, but in association with the
Comanche and other groups, they raided
into Texas in the early 1800s, trading
weapons and ammunition with people
from Natchitoches and Nacogdoches,
and trading and receiving gifts from
Anglo-Americans. In 1836, representatives
of the Republic of Texas visited the
Kiowa and the Comanche to negotiate
and trade. Even so, in 1843 and 1844,
the list of goods specifically indicated
for the Kiowa was insignificant.

The Seminole and Seminole Maroon

In June 1844, Kinney Ranch near Corpus
Christi was attacked. The attackers were
presumably Kiowa, but it was attributed
to several other groups. In October 1844,
at the Council at the Falls-on-the-Brazos,
Sam Houston asked the Comanche to
keep the Kiowa away from Texas because
the Kiowa were at war. Comanche Chief
Pochanaquarhip replied that the Kiowa
were stronger and the Comanche (or
his band) feared them. Sam Houston
asked Pochanaquarhip to send a runner
with a white flag to warn the people in
San Antonio anytime the Kiowa were
approaching. Houston added, “If the Kiowa
come in, the people not knowing, will say
they are Comanche. We thought you all one
people.” As clarification, Pochanaquarhip
explained that nine tribes had not made
peace with the Texans; these included the
Kiowa, Lipan Apache, and Cheyenne.
In 1849, Robert Neighbors, the Indian
agent for the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs,
listed 1,500 Kiowa warriors, the third

The Seminole came to Texas after their
removal to Indian Territory from Florida
in the 1830s and 1840s. Like the Cherokee,
the Creek, and the Choctaw, the Seminole
were slave owners, a fact that had important
repercussions on their move to Texas and
Mexico. Seminole slavery followed social
patterns and relationships that are quite
unlike those practiced by other slaveowning American Indian tribes and by
Western societies. Although culturally and
linguistically different, the Black Seminole,
often called the Seminole Maroons
were, and are, descendants of African
populations enslaved by the Seminole.
The key figure in the Seminole move
to Texas and to northern Mexico was the
Seminole Chief Cooacoochee, known as
Wild Cat. Cooacoochee was a member of
the 1846 Butler and Lewis Expedition to
the Comanche and used this opportunity
and others to explore the Southwest.
He also explored the Brazos River area
and made contacts with the Kickapoo,
Caddo, and other groups. The events and
legal issues connected with the Seminole
recovery of their slaves after their removal
from the Southeast are beyond the scope
of this plan but, in 1849, the Seminole
received 260 former black slaves. While
the Seminole Maroon were hoping for
freedom from their Seminole masters,
they also had to contend with other native
groups and with the white settlers who
were ready to acquire them as slaves.
The solution for the Seminole and
the Seminole Maroon was to emigrate to
Mexico, which they eventually did in 1850.
Page 83

C hapter 3: A ffected E nvironment

That year, the Seminole and the Seminole
Maroon stopped on Cow Bayou near Waco
and at the Llano River to rest and raise
crops before continuing the journey south.
At these stops, Wild Cat promoted his
Mexican colony, but he only managed to
entice some Kickapoo to move southward.
As representative of the Seminole, Seminole
Maroon, and Kickapoo, Wild Cat signed an
agreement with the Mexican government
that provided them with about 7,000
acres of land: half of the land was at the
headwaters of the Río San Antonio and
the other half at the headwaters of the Río
San Rodrigo. In return, all three groups
were to patrol the border and provide
warriors to fight off other tribes such
as the Apache and the Comanche who
continuously harassed the citizens of
northern Mexico. The Seminole settled at
San Fernando de Rosas (modern Zaragoza),
the Seminole Maroon at El Moral, and the
Kickapoo at Tuillo (modern Guerrero).
Wild Cat and his fellow Seminole and
Seminole Maroon were a serious problem
for the United States, particularly regarding
runaway slaves. Wild Cat was described
as “an arch intriguer” and Texas officials
often participated in or ordered the pursuit
and apprehension of those thought to be
runaway slaves. Many slaves used Eagle
Pass to escape into Mexico, and so did
the parties of slave hunters who pursued
them. In the late 1860s, several requests
were made to the Mexican authorities
regarding border attacks and depredations
committed by Seminole, Kickapoo,
Delaware, Lipan Apache, and other groups
who had sought refuge south of the border.
In 1851, as mentioned above, the majority
of the Kickapoo left Mexico; those few
who remained settled in Morelos. That
same year, the Seminole and the Seminole
Maroon moved to lands granted at the
hacienda El Nacimiento although they
settled apart. In 1859, most Seminole
left Mexico for the Indian Territory, but
some of the Seminole Maroon stayed.

Page 84

The Shawnee
The Shawnee settled in Texas south
of the Red River in 1822. In 1824, they
obtained a temporary Mexican land
grant and, by 1826, 5,000 Shawnee and
Delaware families had settled the land.
The southwestern bands became known
as the Absentee Shawnee, but they chose
different settlement areas. One band settled
on the Canadian River; another joined the
Cherokee on the Sabine River in 1839; and
yet another joined the Caddo groups on
the Brazos Reserve. Like the Delaware,
with whom they were often associated,
the Shawnee were hired as interpreters,
guides, scouts, traders, and hunters. In
the 1830s, the Villa de Dolores settlers on
the Río Grande hired Shawnee hunters
because the colonists feared attacks by the
Comanche. In fact, there were reports of
the Shawnee hunting beaver for pelts at Las
Moras Creek, and on the Río Escondido,
south of the border. In 1836, and under the
leadership of the Cherokee, the Shawnee
signed a peace treaty with the Republic of
Texas. In 1837, the Shawnee were living in
the area of Nacogdoches, although their
status as residents was not clear. Two years
later, some Shawnee decided to disassociate
from the Cherokee, citing the latter’s
agreements with Mexico and the political
situation in Texas under Mirabeau Lamar;
others departed with the Cherokee and
received compensation for lost property.
In 1843, the Shawnee were present at the
Tehuacana Creek Council near modern
Waco. The gift list included 13 Shawnee,
with nine warriors under the leadership of
Black Cat. The following year, the Shawnee
were also present at Tehuacana Creek. In
1849, Indian Agent Robert Neighbors listed
the Shawnee with the Delaware: together,
they numbered 650 people and 130 warriors.
From the 1840s through the 1860s, the
Shawnee (and the Delaware) settled along
the Brazos and Bosque rivers. In 1861, the
Absentee Shawnee who had been removed
to the Wichita-Caddo reservation made
a treaty with the Confederacy, and some
Shawnee served in the Confederate Army.

Chapter 3: Affected Environment - Ethnographic Overview

The Tonkawa
Earlier interpretations and analyses
described the Tonkawa as native to Texas;
however, the work of William Newcomb
and Thomas Campbell conclusively
demonstrated that the Tonkawa were first
recorded in 1601, when they were living
in Oklahoma. During a battle with the
Aquacade, the Spaniards captured an
Indian called Miguel. Miguel was taken
to Mexico City, where he related that,
while still a boy, he had been captured by
Aquacade and that his own people lived
at a place called Tanoak. A map drawn
following Miguel’s instructions placed
Tanoak west of the Aquacade territory,
somewhere between the Salt Fork and
Medicine Lodge rivers in north-central
Oklahoma. During the middle to late 17th
century, some of these groups moved south
and probably remained around the Red
River region for several decades. In 1691,
the Tonkawa (Tamaqua) and the Youjuane
(Diujuan) lived along the Neches and
Angelina rivers. A couple of decades later—
in 1719, and again in 1723—French explorers
mentioned the Tonkawa in the Red River
area. In the middle of the 18th century,
the Tonkawa appear to have ranged
between the Colorado and the Trinity
rivers, above El Camino Real de los Tejas
leading from San Antonio to Los Adaes.
In the 1740s, the Franciscans founded
the San Xavier missions near presentday Rockdale, in Milam County. The
registers of Mission San Francisco Xavier
de Horcasitas indicate that there were
11 Yojuane at the mission but only one
Tonkawa. Indeed, the Tonkawa seem to
have studiously avoided mission life. The
Tonkawa were part of the native attacking
force that destroyed Mission San Sabá
in 1758. The Spanish punitive expedition
meant to avenge the San Sabá outrage
was a failure, but during the trip they
encountered a large camp of Yojuane, and
few natives survived the attack. Weakened,
the Yojuane joined the Tonkawa.
In 1770, when Athanase de Mézières
visited the Cadohadacho village on the
Natchitoches River, the Tonkawa were

expected to join the meeting but did not.
Two years later, de Mézières traveled from
Natchitoches to visit the native nations
on the Upper Trinity and Brazos rivers.
His report on the Tonkawa refers to a war
alliance between the Yojuane and the
Mayeye, which was mostly in place to fend
off the Apache and the Osage. De Mézières
mentioned that the Tonkawa had joined the
Mission San Xavier briefly but had soon
abandoned it. He stressed that they lived
between the Trinity and the Brazos rivers,
were prolific hunters, and traded their
pelts at the Tawakoni village. In fact, the
Tonkawa, Mayeye, and Yujuane generally
set up camp four leagues (about 12 miles)
beyond the beginning of the Monte Grande,
near a spring called Las Puentecitas.
Despite Mézières’s efforts, the Tonkawa
never formally agreed to peace: in 1777, they
campaigned against the Osage and were
said to have 300 warriors. The Spanish
continuously entreated and threatened
the Tonkawa to change their nomadic way
of life, settle in a village, and deliver the
apostates who left the missions. In 1779,
Mézières remarked that the Tonkawa had
maintained 150 warriors on their rolls
since the last epidemic. That same year,
de Mézières met with the Tonkawa and
Tawakoni chiefs and distributed gifts.
The Tonkawa chief was El Mocho, alias
Tosche [or Tosque], a Lipan Apache adoptee
who became leader of the Tonkawa. By
the 1790s, however, the Tonkawa were
stealing horses from the Lipan Apache.
Pressure from the Spanish authorities
and evolving political conditions must
have convinced the Tonkawa to settle
down because, in 1828, Jean Louis
Berlandier recorded visiting a Tonkawa
village located midway between the
Guadalupe and Colorado rivers. At this
time, the Tonkawa were allied with the
Lipan Apache, who were suffering from
the dearth of buffalo and the presence
of the Comanche. Anglo settlers decided
to remove the Tonkawa from the area;
however, Stephen F. Austin informed the
settlers that the Lipan Apache had agreed
to take charge of the Tonkawa instead, and
took them to an area between the upper
Page 85

C hapter 3: A ffected E nvironment

Nueces River and the Río Grande, where
they remained for a couple of years.
The Tonkawa and the Lipan Apache
fought as allies alongside the Texans
against Mexico. In 1843, the Tonkawa
endured a serious epidemic and continued
to suffer a declining population due to
intertribal conflict. The following year, the
Tonkawa and the Lipan Apache camped
near Cedar Creek to hunt, and both tribes
were reported to make sporadic raids on
cattle belonging to Texans. In May 1846,
the Tonkawa signed a peace treaty with
the United States at Council Springs. The
terms of the treaty provided trade goods
and protection to the tribes; in return, the
signatory tribes were to return prisoners
and captives and cease attacking and
horse stealing. But impoverished by loss
of lands and declining resources, and
used to providing for themselves, proud
tribal members frequently had no other
choice but to continue to raid livestock
from settlers to keep from starving.
Many Tonkawa sought the promised help
from the United States in the 1850s, often
gravitating toward Fort Inge and Fort Clark.
In the mid-1850s, the Tonkawa were sent to
the Brazos Reserve, and in 1859 they were
removed from Texas and settled on the
Wichita Reserve in Indian Territory. Today,
the Tonkawa live near Tonkawa, Oklahoma.
The Tawakoni (Wichita)
From the 16th through the 18th
centuries, the Tawakoni moved gradually
away from the Arkansas River into the
Wichita Mountains and the area north
of the Red River. Before 1835, the Iscani,
Keechi, (Kitsai) Taovaya, Tawakoni,
Waco, and the Wichita proper were
politically autonomous groups that shared
linguistic and cultural characteristics.
After signing The Treaty of Camp Holmes
with the United States, in 1835, these
groups became collectively known as
the Wichita. Still, unlike the Caddo in
Texas and Louisiana, the Wichita groups
generally remained peripheral to Texas
until the late Spanish Colonial period.

Page 86

In the 1740s, Wichita-speaking groups
located in northern Oklahoma were
engaged in profitable and intense trade
with French settlers and other American
Indian tribes, including the Comanche,
with whom they had established peace.
In the 1750s, these groups had moved to
the Red River and by 1758, some were
involved in the attack and destruction
of Mission San Sabá. That attack was
perpetrated with the Comanche and
the Texas Caddo and was meant to
dissuade the Spanish from protecting
the Lipan Apache. The following year,
the Spanish mounted a punitive counterattack against a fortified Taovaya village
on the Red River. Colonel Diego Ortiz
Parrilla led 600 men who were soundly
defeated and had to flee for their lives.
In 1770, Athanase de Mézières visited
the Cadohadacho, Taovaya, Tawakoni,
Iscani, and Keechi on the Red River,
although these groups also maintained
a village along the Sabine River. The
chiefs of these groups made clear that,
prior to that date, the Tawakoni and the
Iscani had settled between Bexar and San
Sabá but had now moved to the Sabine
River, where they intended to remain.
Mézières confirmed that the Taovaya had
abandoned their fortified village and had
moved south. They also stated they were
at war with the Lipan Apache, and that
the Comanche were at war with them.
In 1771, the Taovaya agreed to a peace
treaty with Spain. According to the terms
of this treaty, the Taovaya would not travel
farther south than the Bexar Presidio,
would return captives, and would persuade
the Comanche to refrain from committing
hostile acts. At that time, the Taovaya were
said to have between 2,000 and 3,000
warriors. A year later, Mézières again
visited the Wichita groups. The Tawakoni
village was located west of the Trinity River,
but the Iscani lived in dispersed, smaller
settlements about 20 miles from the Keechi.
Mézières also learned that the Tawakoni
had established another village on the
Brazos River. In 1777, the Wichita tribes
suffered an epidemic that affected many
other tribes in East Texas, particularly the

Chapter 3: Affected Environment - Ethnographic Overview

Tawakoni. The following year, the Taovaya
had returned to the fortified village on
the Red River. During Mézières’ 1779
visit to the Taovaya fortified villages, he
estimated that there were 800 men and
many children at the Taovaya villages.
In 1801, the Taovaya again suffered a
smallpox epidemic that reduced their adult
male population to 400. At this time, the
Iscani, Taovaya, and Tawakoni were living
in villages located on both sides of the Red
River. Their principal chief was Awakahea
(or Awahakei) of the Tawakoni village, who
died in 1811. When the tribes could not agree
on a successor, the groups dispersed. The
Tawakoni, or part of the tribe, moved south.
The Keechi, Tawakoni, Waco, and
Wichita proper were present at the
Tehuacana Creek Council of 1843, where
it was agreed that all hostilities were to
cease, trade would take place at the Brazos
trading post, and if a treaty was to be
concluded there would be mutual exchange
of prisoners or captives. Chief Acaquash
signed for all the tribes. The Republic of
Texas, the Keechi, the Tawakoni, and the
Waco signed a peace treaty at Bird’s Fort
on the Trinity River in September 1843.
But horse stealing continued, despite
the treaties and the goodwill, angering
settlers and leading to the killing of Wichita
people. At the next Tehuacana Council,
the chiefs of other groups repeatedly
admonished the Tawakoni to listen to
and uphold the recommendations of the
council in order that they could be happy
and freely travel without fear of reprisals.
In 1846, the Keechi, Tawakoni, Taovaya,
and Waco signed an agreement with the
United States to cease mutual hostilities.
As pressures mounted, white settlement
expanded, and resources decreased,
American Indian tribes, such as the
Wichita, resorted once more to raiding.
Ultimately, in 1859, the last of the Wichita
groups were removed to Indian Territory.
African Americans
Africans could be found living all along
the El Camino Real de los Tejas corridor,

particularly after the late 1680s. Some came
with the Spanish expeditions; many more
trickled in via the Texas-Louisiana border.
In 1783, 19% of the Texas population
was classified as “colored,” terms that
also included mestizo and mulatto, or
mixed race, and anyone who did not fit
well in other race categories. The figures
in Texas slowly rose each subsequent year:
20% in 1784 and 21%; by 1790, though, it
had dropped to 12%. Within Texas, 29%
of the population of San Antonio was
classified as African American in 1780; by
1790, that percentage had risen to 37%.
At La Bahía, 36% of the population was
classified as colored in 1780; by 1790 that
percentage had decreased to 19%. Skewing
the numbers, however, is the fact that
many light-skinned people with African
ancestry were quite often classified as
Spaniards, not mestizo or mulatto.
Africans occupied all sorts of trades
and, while some were sold into slavery,
others were free. Records show that Pedro
Ramírez was a ranch hand in San Antonio,
but Felipe Ulúa, who had bought his own
freedom, owned property and raised crops.
Still, their historical traces are difficult
to find because they did not advertise
their presence for fear of enslavement
and persecution, particularly after the
1800s, when British and Anglo-American
pro-slavery policies affected the South.
Some surviving records document the
presence of African Americans during
the early 1800s. For example, Kiamata
Long was a slave girl who traveled to
Texas with James Long from Louisiana
and nursed his children. After his death
in Mexico, Kiamata and Long’s wife
and children became part of Stephen F.
Austin’s colony. Kiamata and her children
served the Long family throughout their
lives. Moses Austin, Stephen’s father, had
an African slave, and so did many other
Anglos in the Texas colonies. Although
Mexico abolished slavery after it gained
its independence from Spain in 1821, Texas
colonists obtained an exemption from
the abolition law and continued to own
slaves during the Mexican period. James
Page 87

C hapter 3: A ffected E nvironment

Fannin, for instance, smuggled in 153
African slaves from Cuba in 1833. In 1825,
the Austin colony had 443 slaves owned
by 69 slaveholders. By 1836, this figure
had swelled to 5,000 slaves; just four years
later, the figure was 11,323. Most of the
slaves worked as field hands in the cotton
fields of East Texas or on the coast.
During the Texas Revolution, or War
for Texas Independence (1835–1836),
several Africans fought alongside the
Texans to gain independence from
Mexico. Unfortunately, although they
were successful, the change in regime
did not favor Africans; under the
Republic of Texas, the lot of Africans,
freed or enslaved, did not improve.
William Goyens, a light-skinned
African, was an exception. Goyens lived in
Nacogdoches in 1820 and became wealthy
as a blacksmith, wagon manufacturer,
and freight hauler between Nacogdoches
and Natchitoches. He also owned his
land, a mill, and traded in real estate. In
1832, Goyens bought a track of land on
El Camino Real de los Tejas, four miles
west of Nacogdoches. During the Texas
Revolution, Sam Houston used Goyens
as an emissary, requesting that the
Cherokee not side with Mexican forces.
Samuel McCullough, another free
African American, was wounded trying
to repel Mexican troops during the Battle
of Goliad in October 1835. When the
Texas Revolution was over, McCullough
feared being deported. He successfully
requested special permission to remain
in Texas on the basis of his service to the
republic. Hendrick Arnold was in a similar
situation. Arnold fought with Colonel
Ben Milam in San Antonio in 1835, and
although, as a freed man he was supposed
to leave the country, he and his family
remained in San Antonio, where he was
given land and operated a gristmill near
Mission San Juan Capistrano. It is perhaps
significant that both McCullough and
Goyens were married to white women.
During the mid-1800s, many freed
and fugitive slaves crossed Texas along
El Camino Real de los Tejas, en route to
Page 88

Mexico, where they joined communities
of Seminole Maroons, or Black Seminole.
Others remained in Texas and made their
name working on ranches as cowhands.
Other Ethnic Groups
Beginning in the 18th century with
Canary Islanders, El Camino Real de
los Tejas served as a migratory route for
many European ethnic groups. After
the 1840s, Belgians, Czechs, Frenchmen,
Germans, Greeks, Hungarians, Italians,
Irishmen, Norwegians, Poles, and
Swedes settled along the trail corridor
although most arrived by sea. Many of
these communities still retain major
elements of their ancestors’ culture.

from inventories of cultural resources
along El Camino Real de los Tejas National
Historic Trail carried out during the
planning effort for this Comprehensive
Management Plan/Environmental
Assessment. The report and database
of cultural resources along the Texas
portion of the trail includes close to
300 sites. A similar report and database
for the Louisiana portion of El Camino
Real de los Tejas includes 208 potential
sites and segments. Because many of the
resources are privately owned, specific
geographical details are not available to the
public. No systematic field investigations
were conducted in obtaining trail-related
data. The data for these inventories were
gathered from existing secondary sources,
in addition to some primary sources. A
database of more than 500 references used
to document trail-related resources was
also compiled in the course of preparing
this plan. Both of these databases will be
updated and expanded as new information
is uncovered about trail-related resources.
PREVIOUS RESEARCH
For decades, researchers have
documented cultural resources
associated with El Camino Real de los

Chapter 3: Affected Environment - Previous Research

Tejas National Historic Trail. Records
used to study Spanish Colonial history
and resources include travelers’ diaries,
historic maps, General Land Office maps
and land-grant documents, military
records, legal documents, memoirs, and
archeological and historical resource site
forms prepared by historic preservation
professionals. Many reports and books
summarize these primary sources.
At the local level, knowledge about the
trail has been transmitted through oral
tradition; however, corroborating historical
and archeological evidence is often limited.
Avocational and professional historians
and archeologists have examined primary
sources and conducted field research to
document the history of the trail, often
finding physical evidence of swales,
ruts, and related river crossings, camps,
missions, presidios, battlefields, civilian
settlements, ranches, and other artifacts.
On a broader scale, state agencies
have documented the history of the trail
throughout Texas. For example, the
Texas Department of Transportation has
collected and documented trail-related
historical information throughout the state,
including several counties through which
the Texas Department of Transportation
right-of-way encompasses much of the
original alignment of the trail’s main
routes. Several books have been published
that interpret many of the historic
documents and diaries. They provide
clues to the locations of the routes as they
may be found on modern landscapes.
Such research and publications can help
clarify the locations of various segments,
and improve our general understanding
of El Camino Real de los Tejas National
Historic Trail and its varying routes
through time and across the landscape.
Several reports and publications
summarizing various aspects of trail
history exist, but there has been no
comprehensive effort to collect all of the
data in one place. Often, data are found in
unpublished sources, such as the notes of
researchers, for which the original source
data is not known. The planning team

recognizes that a handful of researchers
have spent decades investigating trailrelated cultural resources, and that this
research will probably be ongoing for
decades. As mentioned above, during
the course of preparing this plan, the
planning team made a strong effort
to summarize and organize all data
into a comprehensive database that
can be easily accessed for research
purposes and expanded and updated.
An analysis of the geographic
distribution of historic resources along El
Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic
Trail suggests some interesting patterns.
While some counties had no trail-related
sites previously recorded, other counties
had dozens of potential trail-related sites
for which studies were readily available.
For example, more than 70 Spanish
Colonial and historic American Indian
sites were recorded for Bexar County.
This is the result of three main factors:
1) Extensive urban development in
Bexar County has resulted in required
archeological studies to comply
with federal and state regulations;
2) Several groups in Bexar County,
including the NPS and other
government entities and academic
institutions, have devoted resources
to the professional study and
preservation of a number of Spanish
Colonial period sites; and
3) The area was geographically
located at the intersection of several
Spanish Colonial roads.
The inventory of trail-related resources
focused primarily on previously recorded
sites. It was not an exhaustive search for all
possible resources; therefore, it represents
only a sampling of the total number of
potential resources. This sample is neither
systematic nor random, and it is heavily
skewed by the fact that some areas have
been studied intensively by historians and
archeologists, while others have not. As
a general rule, more professional studies
have been conducted in counties where
Page 89

C hapter 3: A ffected E nvironment

major settlements, such as missions and
presidios, are known to exist and more is
known about resources in these counties.

to allow for modern travel, but they still
retain a considerable integrity of setting.

Trail Segments Retaining Physical
Integrity

River and creek crossings, as well as
parajes (traveler’s campsites, or more
broadly, stopping places), would have
existed in all of the counties crossed by
the trail, including the counties where
travelers would have passed through
on their way to major destinations; yet,
relatively few of these fords (and the
likely parajes associated with them)
have been documented. In some of these
“pass-through” counties, documentation
of resources was often accidental.

In some places, physical evidence of the
trail has been obliterated or obscured by
development and other man-made changes
in the landscape, such as agricultural
activities or tree harvesting; however,
numerous original segments still survive
and anyone with a small amount of
training in landscape surveying should
be able to follow them. Slight to extreme
linear depressions, approximately 1 to 2
meters (3.3 to 6.6 feet) wide, may appear
in undisturbed locations. In those cases
where the depressions cannot be explained
by natural processes such as erosion or
by modern farming, hunting, logging, or
forest management activities, and if the
depressions remain consistent in width,
the depressions could be the result of the
natural wearing of carts, wagons, oxen, or
foot traffic—in other words, they could be
remaining traces of the trail. Archeological
research would then be necessary to
associate the trace, rut or swales with a
period of time when the trail was in use.
Researchers have identified intact
trail segments in Bexar, Houston and
Sabine counties and in Natchitoches
Parish. Segments in Brazos, Karnes,
Nacogdoches, Robertson, San Augustine,
and Wilson counties have been physically
identified, but their relationship to
the period of significance for the
trail has not yet been confirmed.
Some segments of the original trail have
been upgraded into modern dirt roads; in
some cases, they have been paved. Such is
the case with Louisiana State Highway 120.
It roughly follows the original route used
by traffic crossing the Sabine River before
1822, when Fort Jesup was established and
El Camino Real de los Tejas alignment
was no longer the only route from Texas
to Natchitoches. Others, like Ormigas
Road, the Texas Star Road, and the
Camino Carretera have been upgraded
Page 90

River Crossings and Parajes

During the Spanish Colonial period,
travelers mostly crossed the river at fords
that were, by definition, shallow and did
not require a ferry or bridge structure.
However, some places where travelers
crossed the river were deep enough to
require simple bridge structures, such as
fallen trees that were laid across the river,
and there are occasional references to the
use of rafts along the trail, indicating deepwater crossings. It has been documented
that people made river crossings at each of
the dams serving the five missions in Bexar
County. It is clear that, although favored
places to cross the river were typically
undeveloped fords, deeper waters in other
areas may have necessitated man-made
structures to accomplish the river crossing.
While most maps show trails intersecting
at roughly perpendicular angles to rivers,
crossing the river using a ford often
required following a river for some distance
away from the main trail, locating the ford
and using it to cross the river, then traveling
back to the main trail, a fact corroborated
by travel narratives. The location of
fords along the trail is important in trail
documentation because such locations
help in mapping trail routes. Furthermore,
parajes were located next to many places
where river crossings were made and
can provide clues to life on the trail. In a
previous study of trail routes (McGraw et
al 1991), dozens of fords and river crossing
places were recorded. Many of these were

Chapter 3: Affected Environment - Previous Research

confirmed by the use of a combination of
aerial photography and field investigations.
Most parajes along the trail were
simple campsites, usually located near
river and creek crossing places, where
travelers could find good water near the
trail. Some, however, included American
Indian villages, where travelers would
receive hospitality and may have traded
goods. Additionally, missions, presidios,
villas, and ranch headquarters often
served the functions of parajes along
the trail. For the following discussion,
however, parajes refer to relatively isolated
campsites, and those stopping places along
the trail that were settlements are noted
under other historic-use categories.
Information regarding several known
river crossing places and their associated
parajes was entered into the trail database.
Many of these parajes were noted in
several different diaries and itineraries
throughout the period of significance of
the trail, but not all of these campsites
have been confirmed archeologically.
American Indian Villages
In the 17th century, Spanish explorers
making the earliest entradas (exploring
military expeditions) into the future states
of Texas and Louisiana, along routes that
would become El Camino Real de los Tejas
National Historic Trail, noted in their
journals that they accepted hospitality
from several American Indian villages,
or rancherías. Some of these rancherías
were referenced repeatedly as stopping
places, or parajes, along the various routes.
For instance, the paraje known as Indian
Mounds is well documented as being at
or near present-day Caddo Mounds State
Park, and a Kickapoo village was located at
a well-known crossing on the Trinity River.
Spanish Missions
Spanish missions were established
for the religious and social conversion
of American Indians. Because many
missions were short lived, some of them
were never comprised of more than a

few jacales, primitive wattle-and-daub
structures made of poles and mud with a
thatch roof. Some of these unsuccessful
missions were abandoned, never having
accomplished their goal of converting
American Indians to Christianity, while
others were reestablished at new locations,
in the hopes that Christianizing American
Indians would be more successful in
different environs. Despite moving to new
locations, often changing names as they
did so, the majority of Spanish missions in
Texas were unsuccessful in their efforts to
convert American Indians to Christianity.
Some missions grew large enough to
warrant the construction of elaborate
stonemasonry buildings and structures
and finely engineered acequia systems,
becoming a major part of the landscape
with dense archeological deposits. Often
when missions were deemed a success,
they were secularized, or transferred
from ecclesiastical to civil or lay use,
and the mission lands turned over to
the neophytes, or new converts, at the
missions. Secularization occurred only
in the settlements in Bexar and Goliad
counties, beginning with the secularization
of Mission San Antonio de Valero in 1793.
Some of the buildings and structures
of the more elaborate missions still retain
much of their physical integrity, and they
serve as representations of the esthetics that
have become inextricably linked with the
Spanish mission period over time. Other
Spanish mission sites are now represented
only by archeological remains and would
require intensive study to properly
understand their historic significance.
Mission locations along El Camino Real
de los Tejas National Historic Trail include
a combination of cultural resource types
that have been recorded as archeological
sites, historic buildings, historic structures,
historic districts, and cultural landscapes.
When reestablishing a mission in a new
location, missionaries brought with them
everything that defined the mission as a
religious entity. This included supplies,
furnishings, and religious vestments that
had originally been brought along the main
Page 91

C hapter 3: A ffected E nvironment

branch of El Camino Real de los Tejas, as
well as converts from the previous mission.
The multiple locations of certain missions
are closely related to the changing routes
of the Spanish trails, and they serve as
reminders of the state of social flux in
which the trails developed. One mission
may have been located in several different
places over time, and the physical evidence
of a particular mission may be found at each
of these locations along the designated trail.
Many mission locations, however, have
not yet been confirmed archeologically.
Presidios, Military Outposts,
and Forts
Beginning with the first mission to
the Tejas in 1690, fortified settlements
manned by soldiers were an inseparable
part of the Spanish colonial missionary
effort along El Camino Real de los Tejas
National Historic Trail. With the founding
of the first presidios, or garrisons along
the trail—Bexar County in 1718, Victoria
County in 1721, and Los Adaes in 1721—
the Spanish government increased its
military defenses to protect missions
and villas. In the late 1700s and early
1800s, the military presence along the
trail increased to include outposts of the
presidios and other military posts, such as
informal guard stations staffed by civilian
soldiers from nearby settlements. Like
the missions, presidios sometimes moved
locations, so multiple sites along the trail
may be associated with a single presidio.
After Louisiana became part of the
United States, following the Louisiana
Purchase in 1803, several military
installations were built along the trail to
deter Spanish intrusions into American
territory. For example, the U.S. Army at
Fort Jesup built Louisiana State Highway
6 using a trail blazed by General James
Wilkinson in 1808 to avoid confrontations
with the Spanish. In 1812, the U.S. Army
built the Texas Star Road, as a route
between Fort Claiborne and Belmont
under army observation to prevent aid
from the west reaching Spanish settlers
living in the Bayou Pierre community.
Page 92

Spanish Villas
Civilian settlements were established
at several areas along the designated
trail, beginning with the villas of Bexar
and Los Adaes in the early 1700s. Earlier
villas were usually established to help
support Spanish soldiers, and to a lesser
degree, to support the missionaries and
their converts. After the 1750s—especially
after the founding of Nuevo Santander, a
primarily civilian venture—the trail saw
an increase in civilian settlements. Unlike
the military and missionary settlements,
villas often received little or no financial
assistance from the Spanish crown, and
they actually served as a tax base upon
which the Spanish government could fund
religious conversion and military efforts.
Other Historic Sites
Further research is necessary to
better understand how other sites, such
as quarries and ranch headquarters, are
related to the development of the trail.
National Historic Districts
The rich history of the areas crossed
by the trail is reflected in a number
of national historic districts:
• San Antonio River Valley
(West of Goliad) Rural
National Historic District
• Goliad State Park National
Historic District
• Mission Parkway Historic and
Archeological District
• San Antonio Missions
National Historic District
• San José de Palafox National
Historic District
• San Xavier Mission Complex
Archeological District
State Archeological Landmarks
There are several state archeological
landmarks along the trail corridor.
Among them are the following two
properties in Bexar County:
• Pérez Cemetery/Rancho de Pérez
• Sabinitas/Jett/Palo Alto Crossing,

Chapter 3: Affected Environment - Previous Research

Natural Landmarks
Natural landmarks were very important,
as their appearance in the landscape
reassured travelers that they were
following the right routes. They are often
mentioned in documents establishing
boundaries between properties. One
such landmark is Loma Alta, identified
in the 1765 legal case between Fray Pedro
Ramírez de Arellano and Domingo
Castelo regarding Rancho San Lucas.
Commemorative Historic Markers
Commemorative historic markers are
common along El Camino Real de los
Tejas National Historic Trail. They are
important artifacts associated with the
rich history of organizations such as the
Daughters of the American Revolution,
and have served to highlight some of the
major trail alignments. In the early 20th
century, the Daughters of the American
Revolution lobbied both their organization
and the state of Texas to have the route of
El Camino Real de los Tejas recognized and
commemorated. The route was surveyed by
V. N. Zivley and was identified by granite
markers every five miles inscribed with
“Camino Real” and “King’s Highway.” In
1918, the markers and identification of the
route were formally presented to the state of
Texas and were enthusiastically accepted.
In 1929, Senate Bill No. 570 formally
identified the route, its significance, and
towns along the way. The bill declared
the trail to be “a historic road of Texas”
and authorized the newly formed State
Highway Department to identify, preserve,
and maintain the historic route. This
law is still in effect and was reaffirmed
by Senate Concurrent resolution No. 2
in July 1989. Today, State Highway 21 in
Texas mostly follows the Daughters of
the American Revolution routes, except
where signed Old San Antonio Road.

Other commemorative monuments
and markers have been established by
the Texas Historical Commission along
the trail during the 20th century. Today,
the commission continues to install
markers providing historic information
at many sites related to El Camino Real
de los Tejas National Historic Trail.
Cemeteries
There are hundreds of burial sites along
the various routes of El Camino Real de
los Tejas National Historic Trail. They
reflect the ethnic and religious diversity
of settlements along the trail and provide
an important link to the trail’s human use
and formal development as communities
and towns emerged along the trail.

A similar effort took place in Louisiana
during the 1950s. The Daughters of the
American Revolution erected comparable
markers made of pink granite to
commemorate the route of El Camino
Real de los Tejas following today’s SR6.

NATURAL RESOURCES
This section addresses the affected
natural resources along the trail as it moves
from the United States-Mexico border in
South Texas; through south-central Texas,
from San Antonio to Austin, into East
Texas; eventually ending in Natchitoches,
Louisiana. This section focuses on geology
and soil, caves and karsts, paleontological
resources, water resources, vegetation
communities, special-status species, air
quality and visual resources, and land use.
In general, the region changes
climatically from a dry to a subhumid
climate, as it moves east from Texas to
Louisiana, with brushy vegetation in the
southwest portion of the trail, followed by
a wetter regime containing oak savannas
and piney woods on its eastern end. The
trail follows a segment of a geologic split
created by an ancient mountain uplift
that now lies buried beneath sedimentary
deposits from the Gulf of Mexico. The
United States portion of the trail begins
at the Río Grande and ends at the Red
River in Louisiana, crossing many major
rivers along its route. Land use generally
varies along the trail, depending on climate
variations, available water, and both
natural and mineral resources. Much of the
landscape of El Camino Real de los Tejas
has changed since its historic use, with
increased urban development from central
Texas eastward and conversion of prairie
land, forest lands, and fertile riverbottom
lands to agricultural production.
El Camino Real de los Tejas National
Historic Trail encompasses a huge study
area, so the planning team used U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency maps
as references for discussion of natural
resources, including vegetation, geologic,
and other divisions as appropriate for
discussion of the natural resources along
the trail (see Appendix L: Map L-3, page
241). Ecoregions are defined as landscapes
exhibiting similarities in the mosaic of
environmental resources, ecosystems, and
effects of humans. This approach is very
useful for environmental and resource
managers, as the maps allow for a seamless
Page 94

and holistic description of ecosystems
as they cross geographical boundaries.
They can help establish patterns
otherwise not easily discernible. The
map elements include not only vegetation
but physiography, soils, climate, geology,
wildlife, hydrology, and current land uses.
VEGETATION COMMUNITIES
The study area in general is ecologically
and biologically diverse. El Camino Real de
los Tejas passes through dry and subhumid
climate zones in the Southwest to a wetter
climate as the trail heads eastward through
the Deep South near the Gulf of Mexico.
The trail crosses numerous rivers, including
major watercourses such as the Colorado,
Guadalupe, San Antonio, and Sabine
rivers. Outside the major watercourses,
vegetation changes from generally brushy
plains in the southwest portion of the trail
to post oak savanna in the east-central
portion and piney woods in the east. For
this project, a vegetation map delineating
ecoregions and major rivers along the
trail corridor was prepared based on the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
data (see Appendix L: Map L-3, page 241).
South Texas
South Texas Plains (Level III)

El Camino Real de los Tejas National
Historic Trail has several branches in the
South Texas plains; routes crossing at the
Mexican border were all located at the
old Mission San Bernardo, near Guerrero,
Mexico, or farther to the south in or near
Laredo. The trails move to the northeast in
this region of shrub-dominated grasslands,
commonly referred to as brush country. The
region historically contained vast grasslands
with low-growing shrubs in a savanna-type
structure. A natural fire regime kept the
domination of brush species to a minimum.
Increased livestock grazing, decreased fires,
and drought have altered the vegetation of
the region to one that is shrub dominated.
The terrain is primarily flat alluvial plains.
In spite of their aridity, parts of the region
contain numerous streams and springs.
Some of the land, primarily near urban

Chapter 3: Affected Environment - Vegetation Communities

centers, contains irrigated agricultural
fields, where crops such as corn and grains
are grown. The more arid region is largely
dominated by livestock grazing. The area of
the South Texas plains crossed by the trail
contains two major Level IV ecoregions:
the Texas-Tamaulipan thornscrub and
the Northern Nueces alluvial plains.
Texas-Tamaulipan Thornscrub

The dominant ecoregion of the South
Texas portion of the trail, near the Mexican
border, is the Texas-Tamaulipan thornscrub,
commonly known as brush country. This
vast area is diverse, as it is a transitional
zone between the arid Chihuahuan
Desert, the subtropical woodlands and
thornscrub of the Río Grande, and the
coastal grasslands near the Gulf of Mexico.
Precipitation is erratic and droughts are
common, leading to a domination of
drought-tolerant, primarily thorny species
such as honey mesquite. Some areas
contain dense understory of granjeno,
kidneywood, and Texas paloverde. Mid
and short grasses found in this region
include sideoats grama, bristlegrass,
lovegrass, tridens and Tobosa. Most of the
area is open rangeland grazed by cattle.
Northern Nueces Alluvial Plains

The Northern Nueces alluvial plains
cover the area northeast of Carrizo Springs.
The region contains numerous streams
and springs and has higher precipitation
levels than surrounding areas. As a
result, more land is used for agricultural
purposes. Some open grasslands of little
bluestem, sideoats grama, and lovegrass
tridens contain scattered honey mesquite
and plateau live oak; other grasslands
in shallower soils contain low-growing
brush such as guajillo, blackbrush, and
kidneywood. Floodplain forests of the
region may contain hackberry, plateau
live oak, pecan and cedar elm, with black
willow and cottonwood along streambanks.
East Central Texas
East Central Texas has branches of the
trail that begin roughly at San Antonio,
head northeast to near Crockett, and

continue north past Bryan along the
southern route from Goliad; the trails
converge at Crockett. The area lies within
two Level III ecoregions: the Texas
Blackland Prairies and East Central Texas
Plains. Overall, the region can be generally
classified as oak woods and prairie. This
ecologically diverse area of post oak woods
and savannas, intermixed with prairie
and pockets of brush country, typifies
the landscape. The savanna landscape
historically was characterized by grasses
such as little bluestem, silver bluestem,
and brownseed paspalum amongst clumps
of post oak trees. Other trees, including
blackjack oak, water oak, winged elm,
hackberry, and yaupon, are found in this
region as well. Bottomland forests contain
water oak, post oak, willow oak, green ash,
and eastern cottonwoods. The planting
of nonnative grasses or overgrazing has
caused the loss of much of the native prairie
vegetation. Several major watercourses
cross this area of east-central Texas,
including the Guadalupe, San Marcos,
Colorado, Brazos, and Trinity rivers.
Texas Blackland Prairies (Level III)

This ecoregion typifies the landscape
around the northern route of the trail,
including the trail from San Antonio to
Austin and beyond to the northeast. The
region was historically dominated by prairie
grasses such as little bluestem, big bluestem,
yellow Indiangrass, and switchgrass,
found on rolling to nearly level plains
(Griffith et al., 2004). The prairies have
now largely been converted to cropland,
nonnative pasture, or urban development.
East Central Texas Plains (Level III)

This ecoregion typifies the landscape
around the Lower Road branch of the
trail, in the area between Goliad and Bryan
and beyond to the northeast. The area
is more forested than the surrounding
prairie ecoregions: it contains hardwood
forests and savannahs of post oak and
some areas of invasive mesquite in the
southern regions. The floodplains of
the major watercourses in this area are
broad and are primarily croplands,
with water oak, post oak, green ash,
Page 95

C hapter 3: A ffected E nvironment

cottonwoods, and hackberry dominating
the forested portions of the bottomlands.
East Texas, West Louisiana
South Central Plains (Level III)

The trail branches generally converge at
the Trinity River along the eastward route
of El Camino Real de los Tejas National
Historic Trail and enter the ecoregion
known as the South-Central Plains. This
region covers the route from approximately
the Trinity River in East Texas to the end
of the trail in Natchitoches, Louisiana.
Commonly known as the piney woods, it
was historically pine and hardwood forests
in the North and longleaf pine woodlands
and savannas in the South. Pines dominated
the uplands, while hardwoods dominated
the bottomlands. The area has been largely
replanted with plantations of loblolly pine
and shortleaf pine or converted to pasture.
Several major watercourses cross the trail in
this area, and include the Trinity, Neches,
and Sabine rivers, ending at the Red River.
Other croplands are limited primarily
to the floodplains of the Red River.

There are three Level IV ecoregions within
this portion of the trail, as follows:
Tertiary Uplands

The tertiary uplands are gently to
moderately sloping plains that cover
the majority of the eastern portion of
the trail. It is a region that historically
contained loblolly pine, shortleaf pine,
southern red oak, post oak, white oak,
hickory, and sweetgum. The western
portion of this region is drier, resulting in
more oak/pine, oak/hickory forests, and
pasture landscapes. Many areas have been
replanted with loblolly pine plantations,
and much of the region has been converted
to livestock pastures; therefore, very
little hardwood species remain.
Southern Tertiary Uplands

The southern tertiary uplands
historically were covered primarily in
longleaf pine forests. In more mesic, or
moderately moist, areas, American beech
or magnolia-beech-loblolly pine forests
Page 96

were commonly found. Shortleaf pine/
hardwood, calcareous, mixed hardwood/
loblolly pine forests, and hardwooddominated forests, and other forest
types occur in this region. Patches of
prairie support herbaceous species,
including many rare plants associated
with calcareous soils. The region’s
vegetation cover currently is more pine
forest than oak/pine or pastureland.
Floodplains and Low Terraces

Floodplains and low terraces are nearly
level, frequently flooded, and vegetated by
forested alluvial wetlands. The bottomland
forests are comprised of mixed hardwood
flanking large river systems and are
maintained by a natural hydrologic regime
of alternating wet and dry periods that
follow seasonal flooding events. Water
oak, willow oak, sweetgum, American elm,
and red maple are some of the tree species
represented in this ecoregion. Thousands
of acres of bottomland forests have been
lost due to conversion to agricultural
production and reservoir construction.
GEOLOGY AND SOILS
Texas has a wide array of natural
geologic resources, ranging from the
oil and gas fields to salt, sulfur, lignite,
building stone, sandstone, gravel, sand,
clay, uranium, other minerals, and water.
A geologic split in the shape of an “S”
runs across the center of the state and
represents a geological rift zone formed
by the ancient uplift and folding of the
Ouachita Mountains to the west, and
the eventual erosion and burial of that
mountain range, primarily by sedimentary
deposits from the downward tipping
of the Gulf Coast to the south. The San
Antonio and Austin areas are near this
split, where a shift in geological age is also
roughly defined. The geological age of the
area crossed by the trail gets younger as
it gets closer to the Gulf of Mexico. The
area around San Antonio and Austin falls
within the Cretaceous Period (145 to 65
million years ago), whereas the branches of
the trail to the south and east (the Laredo
Road) have rocks associated with the

Chapter 3: Affected Environment - Geology and Soils

Tertiary Period (65 to 1.5 million years ago).
The geology of the trail in Texas varies
from tropical sand barriers along the Gulf
Coast to limestone plateaus that sweep
across the south central part of the state.
The last uplift of the area—
approximately 10 million years ago, during
the Tertiary Period of the most recent
Cenozoic Era (65 million years ago to the
present)—formed the Edwards Plateau.
The fracture line of the plateau is known as
the Balcones fault zone. It passes through
San Antonio and naturally follows the
trending line of the buried Ouachita Range.
As the seas rose and fell over the lowlying Louisiana region, throughout the
Tertiary and later Quaternary periods,
some version of the Mississippi River was
carrying vast sediment loads from the
center of the North American continent
and depositing them on the rim of the
Gulf of Mexico. The Holocene epoch of
the Quaternary Period represents only
the last 10,000 years of Earth’s history,
but during the two million years of the
Pleistocene epoch that preceded it, the
river wandered over the whole region,
shifting course throughout time. As a
result of the river’s peripatetic wanderings
and deposition pattern, beneath the
surface of Louisiana lie younger gray
Holocene epoch alluvial deposits, laid
down in or adjacent to rivers and deltas
during the Quaternary Period, while most
surface exposures are composed of older
Pleistocene Period sediments, a reversal of
the usual older-to-younger deposition of
strata, readily observed at highly eroded
canyons such as Arizona’s Grand Canyon.
Soils along the trail corridor closely
follow the geological patterns and, in turn,
contribute to vegetation patterns. For
example, the pine forests of the eastern
region follow the sandy ridges of Tertiary
Period rocks in the area, whereas the
live oaks of the central portion of Texas
prefer the calcareous soils found on the
Edwards Plateau, which is predominantly
limestone. For consistency’s sake, and
because of the close relationships among
the geology, soils, and vegetation of

the area, the divisions of ecoregions
discussed in the Vegetation Communities
section (page 94) are also used here.
South Texas
South Texas Plains

Two major branches of the trail move to
the northeast from the Mexican border in
this subhumid to dry region of flat alluvial
plains and sandstone. Some portions of the
region, although arid, contain numerous
streams and springs. Soils of the region are
mostly clay, clay loam, and sandy clay loam
and range from alkaline to slightly acidic.
Rivers, tributaries, and other areas within
floodplains of the region contain alluvium
soils composed of floodplain deposits of
clay, silt, sand, gravel, and organic matter.
Texas-Tamaulipan Thornscrub

Caliche outcroppings and graveled
ridges and drainage divides are common
in this arid region of the plains. The
underlying bedrock is generally Eocene
Period sandstone and mudstone
that formed one phase of Gulf Coast
margin sedimentation about 50 million
years ago. Soils are varied and include
hyperthermic Alfisols, Aridisols, Mollisols,
and Vertisols. The soils are varied and
complex, ranging from deep sands
to clays and clay loams and they also
range from alkaline to slightly acidic.
Northern Nueces Alluvial Plains

The Northern Nueces alluvial plains
cover the area of the trail northeast of
Carrizo Springs. Alluvial fans and other
alluvial plain deposits from the Holocene
and later Quaternary periods characterize
this area of the trail. Numerous
streams and springs are contained in
this region of erratic precipitation.
East Central Texas
The East Central Texas region covers
branches of the trail from approximately
San Antonio northeast to near Crockett,
and along the southern route from
near Goliad north past Bryan, and up
to Crockett, where the trails converge.
Page 97

C hapter 3: A ffected E nvironment

Irregular plains, commonly underlain
with clay pan, characterize the area.
Soils tend to be acidic and vary between
the upland ridges and the low-lying
valley areas. Sands and sandy loams
dominate the uplands, while clay to
clay loams are found in the low areas.
The area between Goliad and Bryan is
primarily comprised of flat coastal plain
terrain, although the area around Goliad
contains an upland margin where Goliad
sandstone is found. This is a formation of
gray, cemented, pebbly sandstone from
the Pliocene epoch. Goliad sandstone
is used for construction materials in
many historical buildings in the area.
Common soils of the Goliad area are clay,
sandstone, marl, caliche, and limestone
and are underlain by Miocene, Oligocene,
Eocene, and Paleocene epoch sediments.
Texas Blackland Prairies

The Texas Blackland Prairies region
typifies the landscape around the northern
route of the trail, including the trail from
San Antonio to Austin and beyond to
the northeast. San Antonio is unique in
that the nearly 30-mile-wide Balcones
fault system cuts through the city from
northeast to southwest, following the
buried Ouachita Range. The area is a
zone of stair-stepping faults, leaving a
trail of limestone blocks and fault slices.
Cretaceous Period limestone has been
quarried in San Antonio for centuries, and
many of the historic buildings of the city
were constructed with the sturdy blocks.
Soils are diverse but obviously divided in
the city: the southern part of San Antonio
contains fluviatile terrace deposits; in the
northern part, various limestones and
chalks are common. Austin is also near the
Balcones fault system and straddles two
geologic provinces. To the west of Austin is
the uplifted plateau of Cretaceous Period
limestone and to the east is the lowland
Blackland Prairie country. Fractures,
cracks, and cavities in the limestone of
the region force waterways to surface; as a
result, springs are common to this portion
of the trail. Soil types are typically finetextured, dark, calcareous, and productive
Page 98

Vertisols. Rivers along the trail are typically
composed of alluvium floodplain deposits;
however, fluviatile terrace deposits
dominate the soil type of the Colorado
River in the area around Austin and the San
Marcos River, southeast of San Marcos.
East Texas, West Louisiana
South Central Plains

Several branches of El Camino de los
Tejas National Historic Trail generally
converge at the Trinity River, along the
eastward route of the trail, and enter
an area of rolling plains with nearly flat
fluvial terraces, bottomlands, sandy
low hills, and low cuestas (hills). The
uplands are underlain mainly by poorly
consolidated Tertiary Period coastal
plain deposits, and the bottomlands and
terraces are veneered with Quaternary
Period alluvium, terrace deposits, or
loess (wind-blown deposits). This region
covers the route from approximately the
Trinity River to the end of the trail in
Natchitoches. This area, known as the
piney woods, was historically pine forests
and woodlands and other vegetation, which
prefer soils that are thin, sandy to sandy
loam, silt loam, and sandy clay loam.
Tertiary Uplands

The tertiary uplands area of gently to
moderately sloping plains covers most of
the eastern portion of the trail. It contains
Tertiary Period deposits that are mostly
Eocene epoch clays, silts, and sands,
with some Paleocene epoch sediment.
Soils are mostly well- or moderately welldrained Ultisols and Alfisols, typically
with sandy and loamy surface textures.
Southern Tertiary Uplands

The southern tertiary uplands contain
soils that are generally well drained over
permeable sediments. Soils are silt-loam
to loamy-sand Ultisols and Alfisols.
It is a region of siltstones, sandstones,
and calcareous and acidic clay.
Floodplains and Low Terraces

The floodplains and low terraces are
nearly level, veneered by Holocene epoch

Chapter 3: Affected Environment - Air Quality and Visual Resources

alluvium and is frequently flooded. Soils
include Alfisols, Inceptisols, and Entisols.
Soils are generally somewhat poorly drained
to very poorly drained heavy clay and loam.
AIR QUALITY AND VISUAL
RESOURCES
Air quality in the region of El Camino
Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail
is distinguished by those areas that meet
or exceed National Ambient Air Quality
Standards for criteria pollutants. The U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency has
designated the following pollutants as
indicators of air quality for the National
Ambient Air Quality Standards: 1-hour
ozone, 8-hour ozone, carbon monoxide,
nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, particulate
matter (PM)-10, PM-2.5, and lead. These
pollutants have been evaluated for the
maximum concentration whereby adverse
effects will occur to human health. The
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,
in conjunction with individual states,
measures areas for these pollutants.
When an area does not meet the air
quality standard for one of the criteria
pollutants, it may be subject to the formal
rule-making process that designates
it as a “nonattainment area.” Those
nonattainment areas that do not meet
(or that contribute to inferior ambient air
quality in a nearby area) may be subjected
to control measures using the national
primary or secondary air quality standards
for a pollutant. “Attainment areas” are
those areas that do meet the primary or
secondary ambient air quality standard
for the pollutant. According to the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency national
maps for the criteria pollutants, there are
no areas along El Camino Real de los Tejas
National Historic Trail that are currently
considered nonattainment areas. State
monitoring stations are located at various
sections along El Camino Real de los Tejas
National Historic Trail, primarily near large
cities, and are discussed further below.
El Camino Real de los Tejas National
Historic Trail itself is a visual resource
that is designated a national historic trail

under the National Trails System Act of
1968. The Act, among other things, aims
to promote the preservation of the historic
and scenic values of historic travel routes
across the nation. El Camino Real de los
Tejas National Historic Trail crosses many
historical districts that contain viewshed
protections. Increased urban development
has posed challenges to viewshed
preservation of historical districts, leading
to increased municipal regulations for
historical areas, and other landmarks and
significant landforms. Still other areas of
the trail contain land uses, such as timber
harvesting or industrial developments,
that have altered viewsheds over time.
Visual resources are varied; however,
since topographical changes are slight in
most of the region, no dramatic changes
may be detected across the landscape
as a whole. The areas surrounding San
Antonio and Austin have the largest
change in topography, as the cities
are within the heavily visited scenic
region of the Texas Hill Country.
South Texas: Air Quality
The portion of the trail that includes
South Texas, from the United StatesMexico border northeast to San Antonio,
has no areas of nonattainment, according to
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
national maps for the criteria pollutants.
The Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality collects air data from 20 air
monitoring stations in the region. The
majority of these sites are located within
Bexar County, near San Antonio. The sites
are grouped by the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality into regions and are
rated daily on a scale based on the National
Air Ambient Quality Standards. The sites
in Bexar County are within Region 13. One
air monitoring site is located in Maverick
County, and three are located within the
Laredo City area of Webb County. These
sites are grouped within Region 16.
South Texas: Visual Resources
The topography in this region is
relatively flat until reaching the vicinity of
Page 99

C hapter 3: A ffected E nvironment

San Antonio; therefore, the visual resources
in this area would not be expected to
provide a dramatic effect from a change
in elevation. Historic towns in this
region include Laredo, Carrizo Springs,
Goliad, and San Antonio, and most have
preservation guidelines for the historic
districts that include visual resources. San
Antonio has many historical sites, and
the city has implemented visual resource
protection regulations in order to “protect,
preserve and enhance views and vistas”
surrounding their historic districts.
East Central Texas: Air Quality
This portion of El Camino Real de
los Tejas National Historic Trail has no
areas of nonattainment according to the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
national maps. East Central Texas has 12
air monitoring sites, with six of the sites
located in the Austin-San Marcos area
(Region 11, which includes Travis, Bastrop,
and Hays counties). Other counties with air
monitoring sites are Comal and Fayette.
East Central Texas: Visual Resources
East Central Texas contains the most
varied topography of the trail, thus creating
more opportunities for visual impact.
Towns and cities with historic districts or
significant landmarks of this area include
New Braunfels, San Marcos, Austin,
Bastrop, and Bryan. Austin has ordinances
in place to protect the views as seen from its
Hill Country roadways and help preserve
the scenic values of the corridor parkways.
East Texas, West Louisiana:
Air Quality
This portion of the trail has no areas
of nonattainment. East Texas and West
Louisiana have no air monitoring sites.
East Texas, West Louisiana: Visual
Resources
The topography of this region is
relatively flat; therefore, the visual
resources in this area would not be
Page 100

expected to change dramatically due to
shifts in elevation. Valuable scenic visual
resources can still abound in this region
as evidenced by places such as the ToledoBend Reservoir, where the large body of
water provides open and expansive vistas
of the landscape. Towns and cities with
historic districts or significant landmarks
include Crockett, Alto, Nacogdoches, San
Augustine, and Natchitoches, Louisiana.
PALEONTOLOGICAL RESOURCES
Modern mammals, birds, and flowering
plants began to appear during the
Cretaceous Period, from 145 to 65 million
years ago. By the end of the Cretaceous
Period, changes in climate, the breakup of
the supercontinent Pangaea, and regional
differences contributed to the mass
extinction of many organisms, including
dinosaurs (U.S. Geological Survey, www.
usgs.gov/states/texas). Much of the central
Texas portion of El Camino Real de los
Tejas National Historic Trail is composed of
Cretaceous Period rock. Exotic dinosaurs,
such as the mososaur, lived in the oceans
of the Cretaceous Period in Texas.
Skeletons of the large serpentlike creature
were found in Onion Creek, and the
fossilized skeletons of ancient amphibians
such as the Eryops megacephalus were
found in Archer County, Texas.
Tertiary Period materials dominate
the southern route of the trail through
Texas and into western Louisiana and
contain a rich vertebrate fossil record.
After the extinction of dinosaurs,
mammalian diversity exploded as new
species evolved (The Paleontology
Portal, www.paleoportal.org). Massive
amounts of eroded sediments, washed
down from the rising Rocky Mountains
to the northwest, were deposited across
Texas and in the Gulf of Mexico.
Many paleontological resources are
found in caves and karsts. Over time, such
environments become filled with species
that have either fallen into the underground
locations, been eaten, or denned in the
dark caverns. Approximately 25 caves in
Texas have yielded important fossils of

Chapter 3: Affected Environment - Paleontological Resources

vertebrate animals, including the scimitar
cat, a slender subspecies of the extinct
saber-toothed tiger, which lived in North
America until approximately 10,000 years
ago. A nearly complete set of fossil remains
of the scimitar cat have been found in
Friesenhahn Cave near San Antonio.
Alongside the cat’s fossilized remains
were the bones of its prey, including
baby mammoths, which the cat would
attack and drag to the cave. Friesenhahn
Cave has yielded a variety of Pleistocene
Period vertebrate fossils, including the
bones and teeth of more than 30 genera of
mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and birds.

climate was tropical to subtropical
during the Late Cretaceous Period.

Other caves in Central Texas contain
important paleontological resources.
Natural Bridges Caverns near San Antonio
contains not only human artifacts but
faunal remains, including species that
became extinct 12,000 years ago. Many
of the well-preserved animal bones
found in the caverns were transported
there through paleolithic human activity,
such as hunting and butchering, and
have provided insight into the diets
of prehistoric peoples of the area.

Caves in Texas follow the geologic
“S” shape of the buried ancestral
Ouachita Range across the central part
of the state and are relatively uncommon
near the coastal areas. In the largely
sedimentary central Texas region, with its
preponderance of limestone and dolomite,
at least 9,500 caves, sinkholes, and springs
have been found. The nearest major karst
to El Camino Real de los Tejas National
Historic Trail is the Balcones Fault System,
where the Cretaceous Period limestone cave
system contains many unique and diverse
resources. Hundreds of ancient species,
specially adapted to an energy efficient life
in permanent darkness, live in these cave
environments, and many are endangered.
Cave-adapted species include salamander,
catfish, shrimp, isopod, amphipod, snail,
spider, harvestmen, pseudoscorpion,
beetle, millipede, and centipede. Some
caves become temporary seasonal homes
for other species, with nothing short of
spectacular results. Bracken Bat Cave,
for example, is located approximately 20
miles northeast of San Antonio and is a
summer breeding ground for at least 20
million Mexican free-tailed bats, the largest
known mammal colony in the world.

Louisiana’s geological strata are
relatively young, making it difficult for
paleontologists to uncover fossil remains.
There are a few sites, however, with very
important paleontological resources that
have been exposed in rare outcroppings
or through road cuts. One such site, the
Cane River Site, is in the vicinity of El
Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic
Trail as it passes near Natchitoches. The
sedimentary Cane River Formation,
ranging in age from 44.5 to 46.5 million
years, was fortuitously exposed by a
road construction project and contains
some of the oldest and best-preserved
marine fossils found in Louisiana. The
diversity of marine fossils found at the
site is outstanding and includes dozens
of macroscopic (easily seen with the
naked eye) and microscopic species, such
as oysters, clams, corals, amoebas, even
shark’s teeth. The fossil record uncovered
at this site supports the geological record
that indicates the region was covered
by a shallow ocean at a time when the

CAVES AND KARSTS
Karst is a terrain formed by the
dissolution of carbonate bedrock by
acidic groundwater, and is generally
characterized by sinkholes and caves
that channel water underground. Most
of the caves and karst resources near
El Camino Real de los Tejas National
Historic Trail are found along the Central
Texas portion of the trail. The following
discussion will focus only on these areas.

The discovery of the Texas blind
salamander (Eurycea rathbuni) in the
water-filled caves of the Edwards Aquifer
near San Marcos, in 1896, boosted
cave research in that state. It is still not
known how many of these endangered
salamanders exist; they have only been
recorded at this one location. The artesian
Page 101

C hapter 3: A ffected E nvironment

well at San Marcos also contains at
least one unusual cave formation. The
Balcones Fault Line Cave in San Marcos
is one of the country’s more unusual
caves: it was formed by an earthquake.
Natural Bridge Caverns is one of
the largest caverns in Texas. It contains
visibly distinct strata of Cretaceous
Period limestone. The natural bridge (a
span carved by a water source) cited in
the cavern name was formed in Kainer
Limestone and spans water-carved passages
in the cavern. Natural Bridge Caverns is
listed in the National Register of Historical
Places due to its cultural significance. As
mentioned earlier, many artifacts have
been uncovered here, including projectile
points, charred plants, and stone tools, as
well as valuable paleontological resources
that became extinct 12,000 years ago,
during the late Pleistocene Period.
WATER RESOURCES
Regional water plans affected by El
Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic
Trail Comprehensive Management
Plan/Environmental Assessment show
existing water resources in a state of
flux as traditional uses of water change.
Fluctuations in groundwater levels
accompany population dynamics, climate
conditions, and land-use changes. Drought
and other climatic conditions directly
affect available water supply, and many of
the regions the trail traverses, particularly
Central Texas, are also being impacted
by urban development, with the drawdown of regional aquifers as population
increases. This is not set in stone, however;
water supplies in some areas may actually
increase as agricultural land use decreases.
Water sources for South Texas are
primarily associated with surface water
resources; Central Texas water sources are
a combination of surface and groundwater;
and East Texas and West Louisiana
primarily rely on surface water. Most, if
not all, of the rivers that cross the trail
are linked to reservoirs that supply water
primarily for agricultural and urban uses.
Along the eastern portion of the trail,
Page 102

water resources are also used for timber
processing and petrochemical industries.
El Camino Real de los Tejas National
Historic Trail generally passes from a drier
regime to a wetter regime as the trail travels
west to east from the Mexican border in
the southwest to the end at Natchitoches,
Louisiana. The trail crosses 13 major
rivers, including the two endpoints of
the trail: the Río Grande at the United
States-Mexico border and the Red River in
Natchitoches, Louisiana (see Appendix L;
Map L-4 page 242 for a location of the rivers
and Table 3-1, page 103 for a listing of them).
The trail crosses almost every major
river basin in Texas before reaching
the Louisiana state line; in Louisiana,
the trail ends in the Red River Basin.
These basins are a function of many
factors, but one of the most important
is precipitation. The average annual
runoff from precipitation varies from 0.2
inches along the South Texas portion of
the trail to 11 inches or more along the
eastern portion of the trail in Louisiana.
Texas has 196 major reservoirs. The
trail crosses several of these, including
the largest reservoir in the south: Toledo
Bend Reservoir. This massive reservoir
is located along the Texas-Louisiana
border and has a storage capacity of
more than four million acre-feet.

The trail crosses four major aquifers
in Texas and Louisiana: the CarrizoWilcox (outcrop and subsurface), Edwards
(Balcones Fault Zone), the Trinity (outcrop
and substrate), and the Gulf Coast aquifers.
Several minor aquifers are located along
or near the trail. Many areas along the
trail route are experiencing a decline
in the water level of the major aquifers.
Declines range from less than 50 feet to
greater than 200 feet in some areas.
South Texas
From the United States-Mexico border
north to San Antonio and south to Laredo
and Goliad the arid landscape contains
three major rivers. Major water resources
come from the Río Grande and the Nueces
River Basin, with interbasin transfers from
the Lavaca Region to the east. The trail
in this area crosses the Carrizo-Wilcox
Aquifer and the Gulf Coast Aquifer. These
are major aquifers, with the CarrizoWilcox outcrop covering an area of 11,186
square miles and the Gulf Coast Aquifer
area covering 41,879 square miles. The trail
begins to cross two other major aquifers—
the Edwards (Balcones Fault Zone) and
the Trinity aquifers—in this region. The
Edwards Aquifer outcrop area covers 5,560

square miles, with a subsurface area of 2,314
square miles. The Trinity Aquifer covers
10,652 square miles, with a subsurface area
of 21,308 square miles. The Trinity Aquifer
is composed of several individual aquifers
contained within the Trinity Group.
East Central Texas
The East Central portion of El Camino
Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail
includes the area east of San Antonio to
east of Bryan, Texas, and crosses six major
rivers. Water resources along this part of
the trail are a complex blend of surface
and groundwater resources. The trail
crosses a network of interwoven aquifers,
including the four above-referenced major
aquifers, as well as four minor aquifers:
the Queen City Aquifer (outcrop and
subsurface), the Sparta Aquifer (outcrop
and subsurface), the Brazos River Alluvium
Aquifer, and the Yegua-Jackson Aquifer.
East Texas-West Louisiana
The trail continues northeastward
through East Texas, crossing three more
major rivers, until it reaches its terminus
at the Red River in West Louisiana.
Major water resources are centered
on these rivers and their associated
reservoirs. The trail crosses two major
aquifers: the Carrizo-Wilcox Aquifer
(outcrop and subsurface) and the Gulf
Coast Aquifer. The end of the trail is
within the Red River Alluvial Aquifer.
SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES
Due to the size of the study area, the trail
is divided into three sections based on maps
from the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency that provide descriptions of the
vegetation classifications found within
the study area. County lists from the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service are included
within each of the three divisions. Species
counts and comparisons of state listed
species and federally listed species were
made using the databases maintained
by the Texas Parks and Wildlife and the
Louisiana Department of Wildlife &
Page 103

C hapter 3: A ffected E nvironment

Fisheries; however, only federally listed
species are included in Appendix K.page 237
The study area, in general, is ecologically
and biologically diverse and rich in species
diversity. There are 52 federally listed
species within the counties where the trail
corridor is located, and 16 species have
designated critical habitat. The species
with critical habitat designations vary
from invertebrates that spend their lives
underground in mesocaverns (humanly
impassable voids in karst limestone) and
caves to species confined to springs or
other isolated waterways. Nine listed
invertebrates with designated critical
habitat are underground cave dwellers and
four of the nine occur in only one cave. Two
insects (the Comal Springs dryopid beetle
and the Comal Springs riffle beetle) and
one crustaceous species (the Peck’s cave
amphipod) have designated habitat in two
springs in Comal and Hays counties, Texas.
San Marcos, in Hays County, also contains
critical habitat designations for four other
floral and faunal species: Texas wild rice,
San Marcos salamander, fountain darter,
and the San Marcos Gambosia. Bastrop
and Burleson counties contain critical
habitat for the Houston toad, with prime
habitat located near the town of Bastrop.
Some species, such as the whooping
crane, are listed in several counties. During
annual migrations, whooping cranes stop
in flooded playas, wetlands, or fields, and
near rivers or lakes, to feed or rest, but
not necessarily to reside. Other species
also have specific requirements related to
seasonal fluctuations in precipitation and
soil type. The Neches River rose-mallow
is listed in Houston County and requires
seasonally wet soils. Sites where the mallow
may be found are typically flooded during
late winter and early spring, but the surface
soils are often quite dry by late summer.
Little is known about some of the other
species listed in counties that the trail
crosses. The jaguarundi, for example, is one
of the rarest cats in Texas, and much of the
data available on its existence along the trail
is gathered from anecdotal or historical
writings. Jaguarundi habitat is thought
Page 104

to occur in dense thorny shrublands of
the Río Grande Valley, although sightings
of the cat have not been reported for
several years. Much of the habitat of listed
species has been fragmented as a result
of development for agricultural or other
purposes. As a result, species that once
claimed large territories are now confined
to remnant pieces of the original habitat
type. The ocelot for example, is now only
known to occur at or near Laguna Atascosa
National Wildlife Refuge, where its habitat
of dense, thorny shrubs remains intact.
Conversely, some listed species may now
be on the increase in areas the trail once
crossed. The Louisiana black bear, one of
16 subspecies of the American black bear,
historically roamed most of East Texas,
thriving in swamps, thickets, bottomland
hardwood forests, and other forest types.
The black bear is now known mostly
within the Atchafalaya River and Tensas
River basins in Louisiana. Neighboring
populations in Arkansas and Oklahoma are
stable or increasing. This has resulted in
more sightings of black bears in East Texas,
suggesting that populations are on the rise.

LAND USE
Land uses along El Camino Real de
los Tejas National Historic Trail generally
change with variations in landscape, water
resources, and climate. Land use in more
arid South Texas is dominated by livestock
grazing on vast, largely empty rangelands,
where the human population density is
relatively low compared with other areas
of the trail. Land uses in the region also
include oil and natural gas production,
and many of the ranches supplement
their income by issuing hunting licenses.
Agricultural lands are located in the area
north and northwest of Carrizo Springs,
where irrigated crops of corn, cotton,
small grains, and vegetables are grown.
In East Central Texas, much of the
prairie has been converted to cropland.
This region has a higher population
density than other areas of the trail,
and urban development is displacing
croplands at an increasing rate. The post

Chapter 3: Affected Environment - Land Use

oak savanna vegetation zone, south of
the cities of San Antonio and Austin,
has irregular topography, and land use
is dominated by livestock grazing.
East Texas and West Louisiana lie within
the piney woods vegetation zone, where
the major industry is lumber and woodpulp production. Other land uses include
poultry rearing, oil and gas production, and
livestock grazing. The fertile bottomlands
of the Red River basin near Natchitoches,
Louisiana, are used for croplands.
Land uses within towns and cities along
the trail include residential, commercial,
light industrial, public, agricultural, and
transportation. Portions of the trail are
now existing roads or highways, or are
crossed or paralleled by railroads and
highways. Many towns and cities along the
trail are steeped in history, and preserved
landmarks are a valuable resource for
attracting tourism to the area. Not
surprisingly, then, much of the trail route
has areas with historical designations.
El Camino Real de los Tejas National
Historic Trail does not cross any
designated wild and scenic rivers, nor
does it cross any designated wildernesses
or public lands managed by the Bureau
of Land Management. The only lands
managed by the U.S.D.A. Forest Service
crossed by the trail are in East Texas.

SOCIOECONOMIC
CONDITIONS
The data for this section is derived from
the latest census information available at the
county and parish level in 2000, except for
population growth, where the information
comes from returns for 1990 and 2000. It is
clear to the planning team that substantial
changes are likely to have taken place
in the last nine years. Unfortunately,
there is no way to extrapolate trends at
the state levels with any accuracy, given
the variability among the counties and
parishes crossed by the trail. The variables
selected for analysis appear to be good
indicators of socioeconomic conditions
along the trail. Income, education, and

employment are generally considered
to be among the best gauges of such
circumstances. An analysis of ethnicity was
conducted to satisfy the requirements of
Executive Order 12898, “General Actions
to Address Environmental Justice in
Minority and Low-Income Populations.”
POPULATION GROWTH
With the exception of Zavala and
Dimmit counties, all the counties and
parishes crossed by the trail experienced
population growth. In 14 instances the
growth was moderate, less than 10%,
with Natchitoches and Sabine parishes
in Louisiana included in this group. The
most dramatic increase in population
was found in two Texas counties, Comal
and Williamson, where populations grew
more than 75% between 1990 and 2000.
Bastrop, Guadalupe, Hays, Medina, Travis,
and Webb counties also registered major
demographic growth spurts. Appendix
L , Table L-2, page 250 and Map L-5, page
243 show an interesting pattern of major
growth linked with geographic location
occurring in areas around Austin, the
San Antonio suburbs, and the some of
the counties along the Mexican border.
INCOME/POVERTY RATE BY
COUNTY/PARISH
An examination of the census data
reveals very significant inequality in
levels of income and poverty among the
different counties/parishes (see Appendix
L; Table L-1, page 249 and Map L-6, page
244). One way to establish a meaningful
assessment is to compare the data for each
county and parish with the average for
the state as a whole. In both Texas and
Louisiana, it should be noted, the state
median household income is below the
national average. Only the two Louisiana
parishes and seven of the 40 Texas counties
reported a median household income
above the state average. In the case of
Williamson County, the median household
income was twice the state average.

mere 1.4%. In Texas, the situation is
dramatically different, but the data show
major discrepancies. Six counties report
that Hispanos constitute more than 75% of
their population, in the case of Maverick
reaching 95%. At the other extreme, Sabine,
San Augustine, Houston, and Leon counties
show percentages of Hispanos well below
the national average.
LANDOWNERSHIP
Landownership along the trail is
predominantly private and closely
parallels overall landownership patterns
in Louisiana and Texas. Slightly more
than 1% of the land crossed by the trail
in Texas is owned by federal or state
government; in Louisiana, slightly less
than 1% of the land is government owned.

VISITOR USE AND EXPERIENCE
Although El Camino Real de los
Tejas National Historic Trail has had a
tremendous influence on the shaping
of Texas and Louisiana history, few
visitors are familiar with the story of
the trail and its resources. Interpreting
El Camino Real de los Tejas National
Historic Trail, and providing access to
its resources, is particularly challenging,
because the majority of the designated
trail routes (more than 98%) cross privately
owned land. This poses a challenge not
only in interpreting and administering
the trail but also in gaining public
access to valuable trail resources.
Despite the large percentage of privately
owned land, visitors can still see and
experience historic sites and segments
located along the trail. Opportunities to
retrace the trail are readily available along
public lands and rights-of-way, and trail
users may potentially access trail sites
and segments on private lands, with the
consent and cooperation of the landowner.
There are currently no federal scenic/
historic byway designations in Texas,
or along El Camino Real de los Tejas
National Historic Trail’s main route

through Louisiana. However, many
segments of the trail either parallel
existing roads or have become a part of
the modern highway system, meaning
drivers can get a sense of what it was like
to travel these routes. This is especially
true on rural roads, where much of the
original landscape has been preserved.
In addition to segments and rights-ofway, opportunities to experience and learn
about the trail can also be found at publicly
accessible historic sites and national, state,
and county parks and other facilities,
such as museums and visitor centers.
Alternative B, the preferred alternative,
supports the enhancement of interpretive
and educational programs about the trail
in existing museums and visitor centers.
Information on the trail is also available
online on both private and government-run
websites as well as through publications
and other media, and are listed below.

The exact numbers of visitors to trail
resources is very difficult to compile since
most of these facilities seldom offer a
possibility to indicate the purpose of the
visit. However, Table 3-7 shows the latest
visitation data available for trail-related
parks and sites along El Camino Real de los
Tejas National Historic Trail.
TOURISM
Tourism is a major national industry.
Heritage tourism is becoming a significant
part of this industry, contributing to
both local and regional economies.
Heritage tourism dollars generate
sales for travel-related retail and
service businesses, support job growth,
and contribute tax revenue to local
and state governments. El Camino
Real de los Tejas National Historic
Trail is an important asset to the
states of Louisiana and Texas and is
expected to contribute to the travel and
Page 108

tourism sectors by attracting regional,
national, and international visitors.
LOUISIANA TOURISM SUMMARY FOR
20072
• Total Louisiana visitor spending
for 2007 was $9 billion
• More than 143,000 Louisiana residents
were directly employed in the travel
and tourism industry in 2007. This
implies that the travel and tourism
industry directly employed 7.7% of
the Louisiana workforce in 2007
• $5.6 billion of 2007 Louisiana
production (2.6% of gross state
product) was directly attributable
to expenditures in the travel
and tourism industry
• In terms of taxes, fees, and
license revenues, visitor spending
accounted for $782 million of 2007
Louisiana revenues, or 8.7% of
this major revenue category.
TEXAS TOURISM SUMMARY FOR
20073
• Total direct travel spending in
Texas was $56.7 billion in 2007. This
represents a 5.4% increase over the
preceding year. In constant (inflationadjusted) dollars, travel spending
increased by 2% from 2006 to 2007.
• Increased room rates and motor fuel
prices were the primary inflationary
factors in the travel industry.
• Local and state tax revenues directly
generated by travel spending were
$3.8 billion in 2007, not including
property tax payments. This represents
approximately 8% of all local and
state tax revenues, not including
property taxes. Travel spending
generated an additional $3.6 billion

in federal tax receipts. The total tax
revenues of $7.4 billion are equivalent
to $880 for each Texas household.
• Visitors who stayed overnight in
commercial lodging (hotels, motels,
resorts, bed and breakfasts) spent
$25.8 billion in 2007. This represents
more than one-half of all visitors
spending at destinations in the state.
• During 2007, travel spending in Texas
directly supported 534,000 jobs,
with earnings of $16.3 billion. About
three-quarters of these jobs were
in the leisure and hospitality sector
(accommodations, food services,
arts, entertainment, and recreation).
• Travel spending supported jobs
in other industries through the
recirculation of travel dollars
among local businesses and
individuals, creating a multiplier
effect. The secondary impacts
in 2007 were 469,000 jobs and
$16.3 billion in earnings.
• The gross domestic product of
the Texas travel industry was $23.1
billion in 2007. This is similar to
other export-oriented industries,
such as microelectronics and
agriculture/food production. Only
oil and gas production and related
manufacturing has a significantly
greater gross domestic product.
• Even though most of the travel
spending and travel-generated impacts
occur in the larger metropolitan areas
of Texas, this is misleading: travel is
actually more important for many of
the non-metropolitan areas in the state.
In terms of the relative importance
of travel-generated employment,
six of the top 10 counties in Texas
are in non-metropolitan areas.

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES
INTRODUCTION
This section analyzes the potential
environmental consequences or impacts
associated with the implementation of the
alternatives presented. The alternatives
offer general strategies for the long-term
administration and protection of trail
resources and related visitor use. They are
conceptual in nature and do not include any
specific development activities or any
site-specific action. Because no site-specific
actions, such as major construction projects
or specific land purchases, are proposed in
the alternatives, the analysis of impacts
consists of an overview of the potential
impacts of implementing each alternative.
And because of the broad nature of the
alternatives, the analysis of environmental
consequences is equally broad. This section
also describes generalized measures to
minimize potential impacts, but this plan
does not suggest that these measures would
work for every site, or that they should be
applied without further study of specific
development projects.
The parties responsible for the
protection of cultural resources in both the
states of Louisiana and Texas concurred at
the beginning of the planning process that
the project did not meet the criteria of a
federal undertaking. Nevertheless,
consistent with National Environmental
Policy Act and National Historic
Preservation Act, Section 106, any federally
proposed action in the future would require
specific compliance for each site or segment
along the congressionally designated routes
and may require consultation with the
Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service, Louisiana and Texas
departments of transportation, state
historic preservation officers, federally
recognized American Indian tribes, and
other state and federal agencies.

future administration of the trail. Impact
topics were selected based on federal laws,
orders, and regulations, National Park
Service management policies, and issues
and concerns expressed during public
scoping. Impact topics allow for a
standardized comparison of the potential
environmental consequences that each
alternative could trigger. Selected impact
topics considered relevant to this plan
include cultural resources (ethnographic,
archeologic, and historic resources), natural
resources (vegetation and wildlife), visitor
use and experience, landownership and use,
and socioeconomic conditions.

METHODOLOGY
Impact analyses are presented in this
document by describing the impacts of each
alternative on each resource topic. Each
impact topic includes a description of the
impact of the alternative, a discussion of
cumulative effects, and a conclusion.
Several factors inform impact analyses
and conclusions. They include National
Park Service staff knowledge of resources,
the project area, and administration and
management of other national historic trails
and a review of existing literature and
information provided by experts in the
National Park Service, other agencies or
organizations, or knowledgeable
individuals. Any effects described in this
section are based on the proposals for the
alternatives and the reasonable
expectations of the impacts they might
have; therefore, the best professional
judgment was used in determining potential
effects.

Chapter 3 covered the Affected
Environment and identified the existing
conditions for all impact topics that are
analyzed and provide additional
information that could prove useful in the
Page 113

C hapter 4: E nvironmental C onsequences

IMPACT TERMINOLOGY
Using the guidelines from the National
Environmental Policy Act, the potential
consequences of the actions in the
alternatives are discussed and analyzed.
Direct, indirect, and cumulative effects are
analyzed for each resource topic carried
forward. Potential impacts are described in
terms of type, context, duration, and
intensity. General definitions are defined
below, while more specific impact
thresholds are identified for each resource
at the beginning of each resource section.
Type describes the classification of the
impact as either beneficial or adverse, direct
or indirect:
Beneficial: A positive change in the condition or appearance of the resource or a
change that moves the resource toward a
desired condition.
Adverse: A change that moves the resource away from a desired condition or
detracts from its appearance or condition.
Direct: An effect that is caused by an
action, and occurs in the same time and
place.
Indirect: An effect that is caused by an
action but is later in time or farther removed in distance, but is still reasonably
foreseeable.
Context describes the area or location in
which the impact will occur
Duration describes the length of time an
effect will occur, either short term or long
term:
-Short-term impacts generally last only
during construction, and the resources
resume their preconstruction conditions
following construction.
-Long-term impacts last beyond the
construction period, and the resources may
not resume their preconstruction
conditions for a longer period of time
following construction.
Intensity describes the degree, level, or
strength of an impact. For this analysis,
Page 114

intensity has been categorized into
negligible, minor, moderate, and major.
Because definitions of intensity vary by
resource topic, intensity definitions are
provided separately for each impact topic
analyzed in this environmental assessment.

CUMULATIVE IMPACT
SCENARIO
The Council on Environmental Quality
(CEQ) regulations, which implement the
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969
(42 USC 4321 et seq.), require assessment of
cumulative impacts in the decision-making
process for federal projects. Cumulative
impacts are defined as “the impact on the
environment which results from the
incremental impact of the action when added
to other past, present, and reasonably
foreseeable future actions regardless of what
agency (federal or nonfederal) or person
undertakes such other actions” (40 CFR
1508.7). Cumulative impacts can result from
individually minor but collectively significant
actions taking place over a period of time.
Cumulative impacts are considered for both
the no action and preferred alternative.
The alternatives presented in this plan
were also evaluated based on external factors
that, together with the actions of each
alternative, could have cumulative impacts.
External factors consist largely of the
independent land-use decisions of possibly
thousands of private, state, county, and
municipal property owners along close to
2,600 miles of designated trail routes. Some
of these decisions may be somewhat
influenced by the trail designation, but they
are most likely driven by local economic
factors and community values, which can be
expected to vary across the two parishes and
40 counties crossed by the designated routes.
Another factor is the degree to which the
tourism and the hospitality industries would
participate in trail promotion and in
encouraging visitation.
Several trends along El Camino Real de los
Tejas National Historic Trail have been
identified for conducting the cumulative
effects analysis:

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences - Cumulative Impact Scenario

• Increased urban development,
particularly housing, commercial
businesses, and highways

A list of such projects has been identified in
Chapter 1, under Gaps in Information and
Research Needs, page 24.

• Energy development projects, such as
the construction of gas and oil
pipelines

IMPACTS OF THE
ALTERNATIVES

• Private individual development
projects that aim to attract visitors but
do not consider the need to retain the
historic fabric of trail-related resources
• Major changes in the ecoregions as a
result of changes in land use, such as:
 large timber industry operations
in Louisiana and East Texas
 agricultural activities
 livestock grazing
 large hunting preserves in South
Texas
• Increase in heritage tourism in Texas
and Louisiana, expanding
opportunities for retail trade and
visitor services
• Increase in websites, exhibits, and
facilities that offer visitors the
opportunity to learn and appreciate
trail resources along El Camino Real
de los Tejas National Historic Trail

INFORMATION SOURCES
AND GAPS
The impact analysis and conclusions are
based on information available in the
literature; data from studies, records, and
information provided by experts, other
agencies, and nonprofit groups; and field
work conducted by the planning team. In
addition, relevant laws, regulations, and
National Park Service management policies
were used in analyzing impacts.
In association with the preparation of
the document, several studies, mentioned in
the Affected Environment chapter, were
completed. However, due to the length of
the corridor, the long period of significance,
and the complex history of the areas
crossed by the trail, it will be crucial that
additional research projects be undertaken.

National historic trails are conceived
and designated as routes with beginning
and end points, but lack formally defined
corridor-edge boundaries. They allow
for—but do not require or legislatively
establish—public access, ownership,
easements, or rights-of-way to trail
segments for outdoor recreation purposes.
Landowners and land managers along the
designated routes retain full ownership and
control of their lands, can continue to use
and develop their property as they wish,
and are not required to open their lands to
the public. They are offered opportunities
to cooperate voluntarily with the trail’s
designated federal lead agency, to provide
for public access, resource protection,
interpretation, and limited development. In
the case of El Camino Real de los Tejas
National Historic Trail, the designated
federal lead agency is the National Park
Service. The role of the National Park
Service is to set and maintain signage and
interpretive standards; help ensure
consistent preservation, education, and
public-use programs; manage the use of the
official trail logo; and provide technical and
limited financial assistance to partners. The
impacts of any alternative depend upon the
interest of state and local landowners in
initiating projects and working with the
National Park Service to provide for trail
visitation and interpretation, as well as in
the interest of local businesses in promoting
trail-related heritage tourism activities.
CULTURAL RESOURCES
Cultural resources that may be affected
by the alternatives include ethnographic,
archeological, and historic resources.
Ethnographic Resources
The National Park Service defines
ethnographic resources as any “site,
structure, object, landscape, or natural
Page 115

C hapter 4: E nvironmental C onsequences

resource feature assigned traditional
legendary, religious, subsistence, or other
significance in the cultural system of a
group traditionally associated with it.” El
Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic
Trail consists of routes that were developed
by American Indian tribes who occupied
lands along the trail corridor. In the 19th
century, several of these groups were forced
by the federal government to relocate to
Oklahoma; however, these lands and their
resources along the trail corridor still hold
great cultural significance for many of the
federally designated tribes associated with
this project.
Consulting tribes are also extremely
concerned about how stories about the trail
are interpreted. Because their ancestors
played a key role in the development of
trade networks and because they were the
focus of Spanish missionary activities, tribal
members often regard these stories as
deeply meaningful on personal, spiritual,
political, and cultural levels. Affected tribes
take a deep interest in how they and their
ancestors are portrayed to the public.
Federal and most state agencies are
required to consult with affected tribes on
such matters; however, local and private
landowners are not.
Methodology

Among the issues of concern to
American Indian tribes are public
knowledge of significant American Indian
sites, potential impacts to physical
ethnographic resources, and whether
ethnographic information concerning the
events and impacts to affected tribes would
be considered in developing interpretive
media for public use.
Effects on ethnographic resources can
be beneficial or adverse, direct or indirect,
short or long term. For the purposes of this
analysis, levels of impact to ethnographic
resources were defined as follows:
Negligible: Impacts would be barely
perceptible and would neither alter
resource conditions, such as traditional
access or site preservation, nor the
relationship between the resource and
Page 116

the affiliated group’s body of practices
and beliefs.
Minor: Impacts would be minor but
noticeable, but would neither appreciably
alter resource conditions, such as
traditional access or site preservation,
nor the relationship between the
resources and the affiliated group’s body
of practices and beliefs.
Moderate: Impacts would be apparent
and would alter resource conditions and
interfere with traditional access, site
preservation, or the relationship between
the resources and the affiliated group’s
practices and beliefs, even though the
group’s practices would survive.
Major: Impacts would alter resource
conditions and/or block or greatly affect
traditional access, site preservation, or
the relationship between the resource
and the affiliated group’s practices and
beliefs, to the extent that the survival of
the group’s practices and beliefs would
be jeopardized.
Alternative A. Continuation of Current
Conditions (No Action)

Under this alternative, National Park
Service activities, including federally
mandated government-to-government
relations with federally recognized Indian
tribes, would continue.
The National Trails Intermountain
Region would have limited opportunity to
increase current knowledge about the
relationship between American Indian
groups and trail resources; they would not
be incorporated into the management of the
trail high potential sites and segments
associated with the various tribes who
played a key role in the development of El
Camino Real de los Tejas. Lack of
knowledge about the specific location of
sacred sites together with the absence of a
communication network would result in
impacts, resulting from the construction of
oil and gas pipelines, and possibly private
development projects designed to attract
visitors.
Public awareness of ethnographic

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences - Cultural Resources

resources would continue to be limited to
special interest groups and motivated
individuals. It is quite likely that some
landowners, nonprofit historic preservation
and/or conservation groups, and even some
local governments would take action to
identify, interpret, and protect
ethnographic trail resources that have not
been yet recognized. Interpretation of El
Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic
Trail, as it relates to American Indians who
lived along the trail corridor during various
periods, would involve discussing cultures,
actions, and the motivations of these
groups. As mentioned before, individual
landowners and local governments are not
required legally to consult American Indian
tribes regarding interpretation of their
history, the cultural and personal
consequences of the removal of the tribes to
Oklahoma, or potential impacts to
culturally significant resources. Moreover,
even well-meaning individuals often fail to
understand that their efforts at recognizing
American Indian contributions can cause
adverse impacts to ethnographic resources.
There is also a real danger that such
programs would not present accurate
interpretation of these groups’ experiences.
Cumulative Effects: Trail-related
ethnographic resources on private lands
could be impacted by urban
development, such as housing,
commercial businesses, and highways.
They could also continue to be affected
by private projects, such as the
construction of oil and gas pipelines,
which are often planned with limited
awareness of the existence and
significance of these resources. American
Indian trail routes and associated
resources closely parallel major state and
federal highways, so they might also be
impacted by road enhancement projects
as well as by increases in agricultural
activities and livestock grazing. This
alternative would add a minor degree to
the overall cumulative impacts on
ethnographic resources.
Conclusion: Alternative A would have a
minor, long-term, and indirect adverse
impact on ethnographic resources

because of the limited awareness of the
resources that could be impacted. This
alternative would have negligible effects
on American Indian concerns about the
interpretation of the stories associated
with El Camino Real de los Tejas
National Historic Trail. Cumulatively, this
action would only add a minor degree of
impact to the overall effect on
ethnographic resources.
Alternative B, Preferred Alternative.
Trail Development through Partnerships

This alternative places emphasis on
enhancing knowledge about trail resources,
particularly the relationships among these
resources and various American Indians
tribes. The National Park Service would
make a serious effort to identify, protect,
and interpret high potential sites associated
with those tribes who played a key role in
the development of El Camino Real de los
Tejas. Impacts could still result due to the
lack of information about the specific
location of some sacred sites and due to
incompatible use practices, such as the
construction of oil and gas pipelines.
However, on-the-ground trail stewards and
the communication network associated
with this alternative would help identify
such projects early on, and as a result,
construction would be more likely rerouted
to less sensitive areas. Advance notice of
these projects would also allow for the
implementation of proper mitigation.
Public awareness of ethnographic
resources would be greatly enhanced, since
this alternative emphasizes research on
trail-related issues that have received
limited attention. It is still likely that some
landowners, nonprofit historic preservation
and/or conservation groups, and even some
local governments would take action to
identify, interpret, and protect
ethnographic trail resources without
consulting with appropriate American
Indian tribes. However, given the emphasis
on landowner education, such actions
would be less likely to occur under
Alternative B.
The enhanced interpretive program this
alternative envisions would involve
Page 117

C hapter 4: E nvironmental C onsequences

discussions about the cultures, actions, and
motivations of the American Indian tribes
who lived along the El Camino Real de los
Tejas National Historic Trail corridor.
Under Alternative B, it is unlikely that
interpretive programs would present
inaccurate information about the
experiences of these groups and their role
in the development of the trail.
Cumulative Effects: Trail-related
ethnographic resources on private lands
would continue to be impacted by urban
development, such as housing,
commercial businesses, and highways.
However, at a minimum greater
awareness of ethnographic resources
would lessen the likelihood of impacts
from nonfederal projects, such as the
construction of oil and gas pipelines,
which are often planned with limited
awareness of the existence and
significance of these resources. American
Indian trail routes and associated
resources closely parallel major state and
federal highways, so they would be likely
impacted by road enhancement projects
as well as by increases in agriculture and
livestock grazing. However, this
alternative would result in minor
cumulative impacts on ethnographic
resources, because the greater awareness
of resources would be more likely to
prevent projects that might cause
negative impacts.
Conclusion: Alternative B would have
minor, long-term, and indirect beneficial
impacts on ethnographic resources
because there would be greater
awareness of the resources likely to be
impacted. This alternative might have
negligible effects on American Indian
concerns about the interpretation of the
stories associated with El Camino Real de
los Tejas National Historic Trail; however,
the efforts to highlight the contribution
of American Indians to the development
of this trail would bring about more
awareness of the significance of
resources and would be more likely to
lead to their protection. Cumulatively,
the minor beneficial effect of this action
on ethnographic resources would not
Page 118

add impacts to the overall effect on
ethnographic resources.
Archeological Resources
Methodology

The National Historic Preservation Act
requires federal agencies to take into
account the effects of their actions on
properties listed or eligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places. The
process begins with the identification and
evaluation of cultural resources for national
register eligibility, followed by an
assessment of the effects the proposed
undertaking might have on those eligible
resources. Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act provides criteria
for evaluating the kind of effect, if any, an
undertaking might have on historic
resources.
If a federal undertaking has no potential
to change the characteristics that qualify
the resource for inclusion in the national
register, then it is considered to have no
effect on the historic property. If the
undertaking could change those
characteristics, then it is considered to have
an effect, which could be adverse or not
adverse. No adverse effect means that the
effect would not be harmful (it could be
benign or beneficial) to those
characteristics that qualify the resource for
the national register. Adverse effect means
that the undertaking could diminish the
integrity of those characteristics.
Effects on archeological resources can
be beneficial or adverse, direct or indirect,
short or long term. For the purposes of this
analysis, levels of impact to archeological
resources were defined as follows:
Negligible: Impact is at the lowest levels
of detection, with neither adverse nor
beneficial consequences.
Minor: Adverse–Disturbance of site
results in little, if any, loss of integrity.
No adverse effect.
Beneficial–Maintenance and
preservation of the site. No adverse
effect.

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences - Archeological Resources

Moderate: Adverse–Disturbance results
in loss of integrity. Determination would
be adverse effect. If so, a memorandum
of agreement would be executed
between the National Park Service and
the state historic preservation officer,
and, if necessary, the Advisory Council
on Historic Preservation. A
memorandum of agreement identifies
measure(s) to minimize or mitigate
adverse impacts and reduce intensity
from major to moderate.
Beneficial–Site stabilization. The
determination would be no adverse
effect.
Major: Adverse–Disturbance results in
loss of integrity. Determination would be
adverse effect. Measures to minimize or
mitigate cannot be agreed upon, and no
memorandum of agreement is executed.
Beneficial–Active intervention to
preserve site. Determination would be
no adverse effect.
Alternative A. Continuation of Current
Conditions (No Action)

Under this alternative, the National Park
Service would continue to work with
resource owners to protect high potential
sites and segments associated with the trail,
to place signs along trail routes, to develop
appropriate visitor access and
interpretation, and to help protect other
trail-related historic properties. Land
use-related activities and practices, with
potential to affect archeological resources,
would continue at current levels.
Any proposed National Park Service
funded undertaking on any lands, private
or public, must comply with Section 106 of
the National Historic Preservation Act,
which requires federal agencies to consider
the effects of their actions on archeological
properties. It should be noted, however, that
after more than 20 years of managing
historic trails, the National Park Service has
undertaken no trail-related project that
resulted in adverse effects to archeological
resources.

Individual landowners, nonprofit
preservation and conservation groups, and
local governments would be at liberty to
independently recognize, interpret, and
protect trail resources. These activities
often involve the installation of structures
that might impair significant resources, and
can also entail roadside or interpretive
signs, increased visitation, guided tours,
maintenance, and protection of
archeological remains and historic
buildings, and possibly other activities.
Sometimes a local government will establish
a park, roadside pullout, or walking trail.
Such on-site activities could affect, either
beneficially or adversely, trail-related
archeological properties with
characteristics that make them eligible for
listing on the National Register for Historic
Places. However, as such nonfederal
projects are beyond the boundaries of
federal lands and without federal support
or permitting, such independent activities
typically receive no review from
archeological-resource professionals, state
historic preservation officers, or others
qualified to evaluate and develop
appropriate mitigation for effects on such
properties.
The National Park Service, the lead
federal agency for the trail, has no oversight
authority over these types of landowner
activities. Since most of the trail routes
associated with El Camino Real de los Tejas
National Historic Trail are in private hands,
this could become a problem. A general lack
of awareness about trail resources, their
fragile nature, and the subtle characteristics
that imbue them with meaning would
possibly contribute to continued misguided
development. The current lack of a
trailwide communications network to warn
about projects, such as the construction of
oil and gas pipelines that would harm trail
resources, would mean that many
archeological resources could be either lost
or adversely affected.
Cumulative Effects: Trail-related
archeological resources on private lands
could be impacted by urban
development, such as housing,
commercial businesses, and highways.
Page 119

C hapter 4: E nvironmental C onsequences

They would also continue to be affected
by private projects, such as the
construction of oil and gas pipelines,
which are often planned with limited
awareness of the existence and
significance of these resources. Historic
trail routes and associated resources
closely parallel major state and federal
highways, so they might also be impacted
by road enhancement projects as well as
by increases in agricultural activities and
livestock grazing. This alternative would
incrementally add a minor degree to the
overall cumulative impacts on
archeological resources.
Conclusion: Alternative A would have
minor, long-term, and indirect adverse
impacts on archeological resources
because there would be little awareness
of the existence and location of the
resources. For that reason they would be
more likely to be impacted. Cumulatively,
this action would only add a minor
degree of impact to the overall
cumulative effect on ethnographic
resources.
Alternative B, Preferred Alternative. Trail
Development through Partnerships

Under this alternative the National Park
Service, as the lead federal agency, would
interact more regularly with landowners,
encouraging land-management practices
that protect archeological resources. The
National Park Service would work with
individual landowners and nonfederal land
managers along the trail corridor to develop
appropriate visitor access, public education
opportunities, and interpretation of
significant resources. These activities
would enhance knowledge of the trail,
would promote awareness of trail-related
sites and segments, and foster interest in
and concern for their protection.
Under this alternative, the National Park
Service would encourage continued
research to verify trail routes and to identify
additional sites and segments that have not
yet received attention from investigators.
The National Park Service would sponsor
activities, such as conferences, to provide a
Page 120

forum for scholars interested in exploring
issues associated with the history of the
trail that have yet to deserve proper
attention. This would be part of the effort
to raise awareness about the trail.
Even with increased awareness, it is
possible that individual landowners,
nonprofit historic preservation and
conservation groups, and local
governments would still undertake projects
that might adversely impact archeological
resources. The National Park Service still
would have no oversight authority over
these types of landowner activities. Most of
the trail routes associated with El Camino
Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail
routes are in private hands, so this could
still become a serious problem. A general
lack of awareness about trail resources,
their fragile nature, and the subtle
characteristics that imbue them with
meaning would contribute to continued
misguided development.
It is likely, however, that it would be far
easier to prevent loss of resources or
adverse effects if there were an active
trailwide communications network to warn
about potentially harmful projects
undertaken by private landowners or by
private corporations. It is also likely that,
with increased awareness about trail
resources, landowners would be more likely
to work jointly with the trail administration
to take advantage of the technical and
limited financial assistance offered by the
National Trails Intermountain Region.
Such partnerships would offer National
Trails Intermountain Region staff, in
consultation with the two state historic
preservation officers, an opportunity to
identify potential adverse effects and to
propose avoidance or mitigation measures.
Any proposed National Park Service
funded undertaking on any lands, private
or public, would have to comply with
Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act, which requires federal
agencies to consider the effects of their
actions on historic properties. Typically,
National Park Service-supported activities
along historic trails that have the potential

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences - Archeological Resources

to affect archeological resources include
the following: small-scale site development
to improve visitor access and interpretation;
trail marking; site protection and
stabilization; outdoor interpretation
projects; rehabilitation, renovation, and
maintenance of historic buildings and
structures; and development of exhibits and
programs in already existing facilities. If
some of these projects are carried out, there
may be an increase in visitation and
activities and increased interest in the trail
and related National Park Service
programs. It is also possible that, by
studying new trail-related sites, there may
be greater opportunities to enter into
partnership agreements. Greater interest in
trail resources is likely to result in enhanced
interpretation and education programs,
higher-quality exhibits, and other projects,
which would have little or no potential to
affect archeological resources.
Cumulative Effects: A few trail-related
archeological resources on private lands
could be gradually lost to development,
such as housing, commercial businesses,
and highways; but under this alternative,
the losses would be considerably smaller.
Increased knowledge about trail
resources, heightened awareness of their
nature, and the substantial involvement
of volunteers along the trail—both in the
identification and protection of
resources—would significantly improve
the ability to protect significant trail
resources and prevent their
disappearance due to the trends
identified under the cumulative impacts
scenario. This alternative would result in
long-term beneficial minor impacts on
archeological resources, because there
would be a greater awareness of the
resources likely to be impacted.
Conclusion: Alternative B would have
minor, long-term, and indirect beneficial
impacts on archeological resources since
there would be greater awareness of the
resources likely to be impacted.
Increased knowledge about trail
resources and compliance with Section
106 would result in beneficial impacts to
archeological resources. Cumulatively,

the minor beneficial effect of this action
would only add a minor degree of impact
to the overall cumulative effect on
ethnographic resources.
Historic Resources
Methodology

The National Historic Preservation Act
requires federal agencies to take into
account the effects of their actions on
properties listed or eligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places. The
process begins with the identification and
evaluation of cultural resources for national
register eligibility, followed by an
assessment of the effects the proposed
undertaking might have on those eligible
resources. Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act provides criteria
for evaluating the kind of effect, if any an
undertaking might have on historic
resources.
If a federal undertaking has no potential
to change the characteristics that qualify
the resource for inclusion in the national
register, then it is considered to have no
effect on the historic property. If the
undertaking could change those
characteristics, then it is considered to have
an effect, which could be adverse or not
adverse. No adverse effect means that the
effect would not be harmful (it could be
benign or beneficial) to those
characteristics that qualify the resource for
the national register. Adverse effect means
that the undertaking could diminish the
integrity of those characteristics.
Effects on historic resources can be
beneficial or adverse, direct or indirect,
short or long term. For the purposes of this
analysis, levels of impact to historic
resources were defined as follows:
Negligible: Impact is at the lowest levels
of detection, with neither adverse nor
beneficial consequences.
Minor: Adverse–Disturbance of site
results in little, if any, loss of integrity. No
adverse effect.
Beneficial–Maintenance and preservation
of the site. No adverse effect.
Page 121

C hapter 4: E nvironmental C onsequences

Moderate: Adverse–Disturbance results
in loss of integrity. Determination would
be adverse effect. If so, a memorandum
of agreement would be executed
between the National Park Service and
the state historic preservation officer,
and, if necessary, the Advisory Council
on Historic Preservation. A
memorandum of agreement identifies
measure(s) to minimize or mitigate
adverse impacts and reduce intensity
from major to moderate.
Beneficial–Site stabilization. The
determination would be no adverse
effect.
Major: Adverse–Disturbance results in
loss of integrity. Determination would be
adverse effect. Measures to minimize or
mitigate cannot be agreed upon, and no
memorandum of agreement is executed.
Beneficial–Active intervention to
preserve site. Determination would be
no adverse effect.
Alternative A. Continuation of Current
Conditions (No Action)

Under this alternative, the National Park
Service would continue to work with
resource owners to protect high potential
sites and segments associated with the trail,
to place signs along trail routes, to develop
appropriate visitor access and
interpretation, and to help protect other
trail-related historic properties. Those land
use-related activities and practices, with
potential to affect historic resources, would
continue at current levels.
Any proposed National Park Service
funded undertaking on any lands, private
or public, must comply with Section 106 of
the National Historic Preservation Act,
which requires federal agencies to consider
the effects of their actions on historic
properties. It should be noted, however, that
after more than 20 years of managing
historic trails, the National Park Service has
undertaken no trail-related project that
resulted in adverse effects to historic
resources.
Individual landowners, nonprofit
historic preservation and conservation
Page 122

groups, and local governments can
independently recognize, interpret, and
protect trail resources. These activities
often involve the installation of structures
that might impair significant resources, and
can also entail roadside or interpretive
signs, increased visitation, guided tours,
maintenance and protection of historic
buildings, and possibly other activities.
Sometimes a local government will establish
a park, roadside pullout, or walking trail.
Such on-site activities could affect, either
beneficially or adversely, trail-related
historic properties with characteristics that
make them eligible for listing on the
National Register for Historic Places.
However, as such nonfederal projects are
beyond the boundaries of federal lands and
without federal support or permitting, such
independent activities typically receive no
review from historic-resource professionals,
state historic preservation officers, or
others qualified to evaluate and develop
appropriate mitigation for effects on such
properties.
The National Park Service, the federal
lead agency for the trail, has no oversight
authority over these types of landowner
activities. Since most of the trail routes
associated with El Camino Real de los Tejas
National Historic Trail are in private hands,
this could become a problem. A general lack
of awareness about trail resources, their
fragile nature, and the subtle characteristics
that imbue them with meaning would
contribute to continued misguided
development. The current lack of a
trailwide communications network to warn
about projects, such as oil and gas pipelines
projects that would harm trail resources,
would mean that many historic resources
would be either lost or adversely affected.
Cumulative Effects: Historic trail
resources on nonfederal lands would
continue to be impacted by increased
urban development, such as housing,
commercial businesses, and highways.
They would also continue to be affected
by private development, such as the
construction of oil and gas pipelines
which are often planned with limited
awareness of the significance of these

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences - Historic Resources

resources. Trail routes and associated
historic resources closely parallel major
state and federal highways, so they would
be likely impacted by economic
development activities, such as urban
development as well as increases in
agriculture and livestock grazing. This
alternative would result in minor, longterm, and indirect cumulative impacts on
historic resources.
Conclusion: Alternative A may have a
moderate, long-term, and indirect
adverse cumulative impact on historic
resources since there would be little
awareness of the resources likely to be
impacted. Cumulatively, the minor
adverse effect of this action would only
add a minor degree of impact to the
overall cumulative effect on historic
resources.

beneficial minor cumulative impacts on
historic resources.
Conclusion: Alternative B would have
minor, long-term, and indirect beneficial
impacts on historic resources because
there would be greater awareness of the
resources likely to be impacted.
Cumulatively, the minor beneficial effect
of this action on historic resources would
add a minor degree of impact to the
overall effect on historic resources.
Cumulative impacts would have minor,
long-term, and indirect widespread
beneficial impacts on historic resources.
Natural Resources: Native Vegetation
Methodology

Issues of concern with regard to native
vegetation may be associated with the
removal of vegetative cover in association
Page 124

with trail-related development and
visitor-use activities.
Effects on natural resources can be
beneficial or adverse, direct or indirect,
short or long term. For the purposes of this
analysis, levels of impact to natural
resources (vegetation) were defined as
follows:
Negligible: Individual native plants may
be affected, but measurable or
perceptible changes in plant community
size, integrity, or continuity would not
occur.
Minor: Effects on native plants would be
measurable or perceptible, but would be
localized within a small geographic area.
The viability to the plant community
would not be affected, and if left alone,
the community would recover.
Moderate: Changes would occur over a
relatively large area in the native plant
communities that would be readily
measurable in terms of abundance,
distribution, quantity, or quality.
Mitigation measures would probably be
necessary to offset adverse effects, but
would likely be successful.
Major: Effects on native plant
communities would be readily apparent
and would substantially change
community types over a large geographic
area. Extensive mitigation would be
needed to offset adverse effects, and its
success would not be assured.
Alternative A. Continuation of Current
Conditions (No Action)

Under this alternative, the National Park
Service would continue working with
landowners to place signs along trail routes,
develop appropriate visitor access and
interpretation, and help protect trail-related
sites. These land-related activities would
continue at current levels. Any National
Park Service-supported activities that might
disturb lands or increase visitation to
sensitive natural areas or wildlife
populations would undergo additional
environmental analysis to evaluate impacts.
Based on current information, it is highly

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences - Natural Resources: Native Vegetation

unlikely that trail-related projects would
have adverse impacts on any natural
resource along the designated trail routes.
Cumulative Effects: During the last two
centuries, major changes in vegetative
cover have occurred throughout the
counties and parishes crossed by the
trail. The practice of agriculture has led
to large areas being converted from
native vegetation to croplands and/or
pastures of nonnative grasses. Timber
harvesting for fuel or lumber has
removed the extensive woodlands that
covered the eastern sections of the trail,
and livestock grazing has reduced native
plant densities in some areas and
changed the composition of native
vegetation communities. Extensive
residential, commercial, energy, and
road-associated development have
removed native vegetation habitat.
However, some communities of native
plant species continue to exist,
particularly within protected public
lands.
Natural resources on private lands
could continue to be impacted by
increased urban development and the
construction of oil and gas pipelines,
projects that tend to show little
awareness of the importance of
preserving the native vegetation and
wildlife. Trail routes closely parallel major
state and federal highways, so they would
be likely impacted by a variety of
economic development activities. This
alternative would result in minor, longterm and adverse cumulative impacts on
native vegetation
Conclusion: Alternative A would have a
minor, long-term, and indirect adverse
impact on native vegetation since there
would be little awareness of the resources
likely to be impacted. Cumulatively, the
minor adverse effect of this action on
native vegetation would only
incrementally add a minor degree of
impact to the overall impact on natural
resources.

Alternative B, Preferred Alternative.
Trail Development through Partnerships

Habitat loss, such as its reduction due to
road construction or improvements, could
be a factor in jeopardizing the native flora,
and represents a potentially serious threat
to the long-term survival of endangered or
threatened species. Before any kind of
undertaking, a comprehensive survey and
consultation would be conducted with the
appropriate U.S. Fish and Wildlife office.
Exhibits and/or trails would be sited to
avoid habitats of native wildlife. Some
small-scale construction might occur, but it
would be carefully designed to avoid
impacts to native vegetation and its critical
habitat. To confirm the presence of a
species, it would be normal practice to
conduct species surveys of suspected
associated habitats. If a population were to
be detected at the project location, or
within the affected area, mitigation
measures would be incorporated into the
project proposals in consultation with the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the
Louisiana and Texas departments of
natural resources.
Under this alternative, National Park
Service would continue working with
landowners to place signs along trail routes,
develop appropriate visitor access and
interpretation, and help protect trail-related
sites. These land-related activities would
continue at current levels. Any National
Park Service-supported activity that might
disturb land or increase visitation to
sensitive natural areas would undergo
additional environmental analysis to
evaluate impacts. Based on current
information, it is highly unlikely that
trail-related projects would have adverse
impact on any natural resource along the
designated trail routes.
Typical trail activities that have the
potential to impact vegetation include
collaborative projects with landowners to
provide for appropriate visitor access and
use, the development of outdoor
interpretive trails and exhibits, and
collaboration with landowners to protect
trail resources. Impacts of native vegetation
Page 125

C hapter 4: E nvironmental C onsequences

from these activities would be rare and
negligible, if they occur at all.
Increased recreational uses, such as
hiking and biking, that might result in some
areas under Alternative B could adversely
impact native vegetation. Such potential
impacts would be reviewed and carefully
considered under a separate National
Environmental Policy Act process, so that
any adverse effects to natural resources
would be avoided or mitigated.
Cumulative Effects: Because of raised
awareness about trail resources, it is
possible that some property owners
might choose not to initiate activities,
such as development or land clearing,
which might impact vegetation. In such
cases, the impact of this alternative
would be local and beneficial to the
native flora.
Heightened awareness of development
opportunities from increased visitation
might result in an expansion of retail
trade and visitor services. However,
under this alternative, there would be a
greater understanding of the need to
protect the historic setting of trail
resources and this would minimize the
negative impacts of development
associated with expanding services.
Conclusion: The preferred alternative
would cause minor, long-term beneficial,
and indirect effects because the majority
of developers would be more cognizant
of the impacts of their actions on trail
resources. Furthermore, any federal
project resulting directly from the
implementation of Alternative B would
undergo site-specific environmental
analysis, and care would be taken to
avoid and minimize impacts to these
resources. Cumulatively, the minor
beneficial effect of this action would only
add a minor degree of impact to the
overall impact on natural vegetation.
Natural Resources: Wildlife
Methodology

Issues of concern with regard to native
fauna may be associated with the
Page 126

disturbance of wildlife habitat in
association with trail-related development
and visitor-use activities.
Effects on natural resources can be
beneficial or adverse, direct or indirect,
short or long term. For the purposes of this
analysis, levels of impact to natural
resources (wildlife) were defined as follows:
Negligible: Individual wildlife may be
affected, but measurable or perceptible
changes in plant community size,
integrity, or continuity would not occur.
Minor: Effects on wildlife would be
measurable or perceptible, but would be
localized within a small geographic area.
The viability of the animal community
would not be affected, and if left alone,
the community would recover.
Moderate: Changes would occur over a
relatively large area in the wildlife
communities that would be readily
measurable in terms of abundance,
distribution, quantity, or quality.
Mitigation measures would probably be
necessary to offset adverse effects, but
would likely be successful.
Major: Effects on native fauna would be
readily apparent and would substantially

In addition, when potential projects
along specific segments of El Camino Real
de los Tejas National Historic Trail are
proposed, project information would be
submitted to the Wildlife Habitat
Assessment Program for comments and
recommendations regarding potential
impacts to wildlife habitat and potential
impacts to state listed rare, threatened, and
endangered species.
Under this alternative, National Park
Service would continue working with
landowners to place signs along trail routes,

resources. Cumulatively, the minor
beneficial effect of this action would only
add a minor degree of impact to the
overall impact on natural wildlife.
Visitor Use and Experience
Methodology

Visitor use and experience along a
national historic trail is made up of three
fundamental components: social,
recreational, and intellectual/emotional.
The social aspects of user experience
include, among others, crowding or the
Page 128

perception of crowding. Recreation aspects
include the range of experiences available.
The intellectual/emotional aspects of user
experience include the absence or presence
and quality of information, interpretation,
and education and the opportunities to
understand the significance of the trail.
The potential for change in user
experience under each alternative was
evaluated by identifying projected increases
or decreases in user experience and
enjoyment, and determining how these
projected changes would affect the desired
user experience and to what degree.
Effects on visitor use and experience can
be beneficial or adverse, direct or indirect,
short or long term. For the purposes of this
analysis, levels of impact associated with
visitor use and experience were defined as
follows:
Negligible: No noticeable change in
visitor use or experience or in indicators
of visitor satisfaction or behavior.
Minor: Adverse–Slight, detectable
changes in visitor use and/or experience,
but the changes would not appreciably
alter characteristics of the visitor
experience.
Beneficial–Effects would be noticeable
and would somewhat enhance critical
characteristics of the visitor experience.
Moderate: Adverse–Critical
characteristics of the desired experience
would be changed, or the number of
participants engaging in an activity would
be substantially altered. Visitor
satisfaction would change as a result of
this alternative.
Beneficial–Effects would substantially
enhance visitor satisfaction.
Major: Multiple critical characteristics
of the desired experience would be
impacted.
Adverse–Effects would detract from
visitor satisfaction. Participation in
desired experiences would be
considerably reduced and would result in
substantial changes in defined indicators
of visitor satisfaction or behavior.
Beneficial–Effects would add to or

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences - Visitor Use and Experience

enhance visitor satisfaction. Participation
in desired experiences would result in
substantial changes in defined indicators.
Alternative A. Continuation of Current
Conditions (No Action)

Under this alternative, the National
Trails Intermountain Region would
continue to work with resource owners,
particularly state or local agencies, to
develop trail-related interpretive programs,
install trail signage, and develop
appropriate visitor access. There would be
potential to raise awareness of the trail and
to increase public understanding of its
significance. Although only a relatively
small percentage of the designated routes
are accessible to the public, visitor use and
enjoyment of significant trail resources
would still be available at state parks and
some privately owned heritage sites and
museums.
Overall, existing interpretive and
education programs would be enhanced,
and there would be potential for slight
increases in visitation and for greater visitor
satisfaction. Trail awareness among visitors
would also increase due to signage along
trail routes. Expected minor increases in
visitation would not likely impact social
conditions and would not be likely to result
in crowding. Appropriate signage and
interpretation would result in minor
beneficial impacts to the visitor experience.
The potential to visit some protected sites
and segments that are interpreted and
monitored would provide a long-term
minor beneficial effect to the visitor
experience.
Cumulative Impacts: Development
projects that attract large numbers of
visitors, but that do not consider the
need to retain the historic fabric of
trail-related resources would detract
from a high-quality experience.
Increased urban growth, including
housing, commercial business, and
highway projects would limit
geographical opportunities of providing
a rewarding trail experience. All these
factors would add a minor cumulative
impact on the visitor experience.

Conclusion: Under Alternative A,
developing an interpretive program and
appropriate visitor access, and installing
trail signs would result in minor
beneficial effects. Cumulatively, the
minor beneficial effect of this alternative
on the visitor experience would only add
a minor degree of impact to the overall
cumulative effect on the current visitor
use and experience.
Alternative B, Preferred Alternative.
Trail Development through Partnerships

Under this alternative, the National Park
Service, as the federal lead agency, would
facilitate a coordinated effort by the trail
community to provide a high quality
experience that would promote public
understanding and appreciation of cultural
and natural resources along the designated
route. The quality of the interpretation and
educational programs that are currently
being offered would be greatly enhanced by
working cooperatively with entities that
own high potential sites and segments along
the designated trail, such as San Antonio
Mission National Historical Park, and state
agencies, such as the Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department and the Texas
Historical Commission.
There are large numbers of Hispanic
residents along certain sections of the trail
and the trail has the potential to attract
visitors from Mexico. The emphasis on
bilingual interpretation and education
programs would serve the needs of this
audience, which has not been effectively
targeted in the past. Bilingual brochures
and other interpretive media could be made
available and shared with public and private
schools.
The experiences of African Americans
and American Indian tribes would also be
emphasized in the enhanced
interpretation program developed under
this alternative. This would help spotlight
the contribution of these groups to the
history of the trail and likely result in
increased visitation and awareness both
on the part of visitors and AfricanAmericans and American Indian tribes.
Page 129

C hapter 4: E nvironmental C onsequences

All of the public sites along the trail
currently experience low levels of visitation
(see Appendix L; Table L-6, page 254);
therefore, it is highly unlikely that the
implementation of this alternative would
result in overcrowding. Moreover, some of
the provisions—for example, the
development of a flexible and easily
updatable database in conjunction with the
work of local trail stewards—would make it
easier and more effective to monitor the
condition of resources. In some ways, this
approach would replace the current process
used to assess user capacity, which was
designed to be applied to public lands of
limited size, with well-defined public access
and clearly established boundaries, where
closures or other management actions are
possible.
A meaningful and up-to-date
interpretation of historic developments
along the trail, as provided under this
alternative, would allow visitors to forge
emotional and intellectual connections
with trail resources. Such engagement can
only have a positive effect on the long-term
protection of the resources, as visitors
become personally committed to the future
of trail resources. A variety of media, from
print materials to computer programs,
would be used to reach different age groups.
It is also to be expected that, by providing
technical assistance to visitor centers and
museums to expand and improve their
current interpretive program, more visitors
would be attracted to visiting trail sites. The
development of a sign and interpretive plan
would enhance the visitor experience
because it would improve the ability to
retrace a substantial portion of the original
routes. The preferred alternative's emphasis
on recreational activities, such as trail
retracement, would offer visitors the
opportunity to engage intimately with trail
resources and experience vicariously what
travel along the trail might have been like
during the period of significance. It would
help to provide opportunities for trail
audiences to forge emotional and
intellectual connections with the meanings
of those resources by actually travelling
along these routes. This level of engagement
Page 130

would result in long-term minor beneficial
effect to the visitor experience.
Cumulative Impacts: The high quality
visitor experience that would result from
the implementation of Alternative B is
likely to foster widespread interest in the
trail and its resources among a broader
spectrum of society than at the time this
document is being prepared. Such
interest would heighten awareness of the
potential damage that unrestricted
development and changes in land use
could cause to trail resources. Other
projects identified in the cumulative
impact scenario, such as increase in
heritage tourism and increase in websites,
exhibits, and facilities that offer the
opportunity to learn and appreciate
about trail resources, would have minor
beneficial impacts.
Conclusion: The preferred alternative
would cause moderate beneficial effects,
because a larger and more diverse
audience would be able to learn and
appreciate trail resources. Recreational
activities would provide opportunities
for trail audiences to establish meaningful
connections with the resources and will
result in long-term beneficial effects to
the visitor experience. Cumulatively, the
minor adverse effect of this action would
only add a minor degree of impact to the
overall cumulative effect on the visitor
experience and would result in moderate,
long-term beneficial, and indirect
impacts.
LANDOWNERSHIP AND USE
Impacts on land ownership and use are
addressed in this section of the document
because of the initial concern among
owners of property along the trail that
designation might in some way affect
property rights. The enabling legislation,
however, makes it clear that this is not the
case. It includes, among other requirements,
the following guidelines regarding land
acquisition:
• The Secretary of the Interior shall
administer those portions of the trail

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences - Landownership and Use

on nonfederal land only with the
consent of the owner of such land and
when such trail portion qualifies for
certification as an officially established
component of the trail;
• The designation of the trail does not
authorize any person to enter private
property without the consent of the
owner;
• The United States shall not acquire for
the trail any land or interest in land
outside the exterior boundary of any
federally administered area without the
consent of the owner of the land.
Issues of concern on this topic expressed
by private landowners include the
possibility of changes in landownership and
use practices; however, the National Park
Service would not be acquiring any
properties, even on a willing-seller basis.
Methodology

More than 2,500 miles of the designated
routes of El Camino Real de los Tejas
National Historic Trail are privately owned.
Because of the sheer scale of the trail and
the diversity of ownership, it has not been
possible as part of the analysis for this
Comprehensive Management Plan/
Environmental Assessment to acquire data
on the ownership and use of specific
properties and address issues individually.
Several general issues of concern have been
expressed by landowners, however,
including how trail designation would
affect their ability to use their lands and the
effect of trail designation on real estate
values and potential future sale of land or
easements along the trail.
Effects on visitor use and experience can
be beneficial or adverse, direct or indirect,
short or long term. For the purposes of this
analysis, levels of impact associated with
visitor use and experience were defined as
follows:
Negligible: Changes in land ownership
and use patterns are not detectable or
cannot be attributed to the trail
designation.

Minor: Changes in land ownership and
use patterns may be detectable and
appear likely to have resulted from the
trail designation. They occur locally
along trail routes and impact a few
properties.
Moderate: Changes in land ownership
and use patterns are apparent and are
clearly attributable to the trail
designation. They occur locally along
trail routes and impact a number of
properties along the designated routes.
Major: Changes in land ownership and
use patterns are apparent and are clearly
attributable to trail designation. They
occur locally along trail routes and
impact a substantial number of
properties along designated routes.
Alternative A. Continuation of Current
Conditions (No Action)

Participation of landowners in activities
associated with El Camino Real de los Tejas
National Historic Trail is voluntary. The
National Park Service would continue to
work with local governments and local
landowners to place signs along trail routes,
develop appropriate visitor access and
interpretation of trail sites, and help protect
trail-related resources.
The presence of trail-related site or
segments on privately owned land along
other National Park Service-administered
historic trails has rarely influenced
property sales or proposed private
developments. Real estate values have
seldom been significantly influenced by the
presence of trail sites or segments; instead,
they have been based on the intended use of
the property and the value and use of
neighboring real estate.
The National Park Service would not be
acquiring any land even on a willing-seller
basis, so there is no anticipated impact to
landownership and use resulting from
alternative A.
Cumulative Impacts: Several trends
identified in the cumulative impact
scenario are closely associated with
landownership and use. However, at the
Page 131

C hapter 4: E nvironmental C onsequences

time this document is being prepared the
planning team is not aware of any specific
project that would have an overall
negative effect on landownership and use
along the trail. Alternative A would have
negligible cumulative impacts on
landownership and use.
Conclusion: Although the participation
of landowners would be voluntary, it is
likely that the trail designation would
raise awareness of issues associated with
the impact of incompatible land uses on
the trail. No additional impacts on
landownership and use would result
from the implementation of this
alternative. Alternative A would have
minor, beneficial, and indirect effects on
ownership and use along the trail
corridor.
Alternative B, Preferred Alternative.
Trail Development through Partnerships

Along all of the historic trails it manages,
the National Park Service actively works
with private landowners to install trail site
signs, mark trail routes, establish
opportunities for trail retracement and
install signs to facilitate this activity, develop
appropriate visitor access and interpretation,
and help protect trail-related resources.
These projects are supported through the
Challenge Cost Share Program, an
appropriation from Congress that may not
be available every year and THAT requires
partners to provide a minimum of 50%
matching contribution in the form of funds,
equipment, in-kind labor, or supplies from
nonfederal sources. Interest in this program
is likely to increase—at least temporarily—as
publicity associated with the authorization
of the trail creates interest in trail-related
National Park Service programs and as new
partnership opportunities arise. However,
changes in land use as a result of these
activities are likely to be rare and minor.
Furthermore, as these projects are initiated
by landowners, they tend to be compatible
with existing land-use practices and are
viewed both by landowners and the
National Park Service as beneficial.

Page 132

The partnership certification program is
another tool that can be used to encourage
landowners to protect the integrity of their
properties. It is likely that because of the
heightened public awareness along the trail
associated with Alternative B, there would
be a surge in partnership certifications. Still,
because this is a program that is initiated by
the landowners and tends to be used in
conjunction with existing land-use
practices, it would be viewed both by the
landowner and the National Park Service as
beneficial.
After a national historic trail has been
authorized by Congress, local governments
along the trail corridor will often establish
parks, roadside pullouts, or trails for
educational and recreational purposes. Such
activities coincide with the designation of
the trail and are compatible with continuing
agricultural, residential, recreational,
commercial, and other ongoing land uses.
They are viewed as beneficial by
landowners, governments, the general
public, and the National Park Service. Some
landowners may benefit from the sale of
land or easements used for resource
protection or for trail-related cultural,
recreational, or educational facilities. Under
this alternative, these activities are expected
to increase slightly because of heightened
awareness of the trail and greater public
interest in the trail and its resources.
Under Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act, the National Park
Service is required to consider the effects of
undertakings on public properties. The
development of a trail generally increases
public awareness of the routes and
associated resources, and with that
awareness comes an increased sensitivity to
activities that might affect trail resources,
encouraging managers to review more
carefully any potential impacts.
Programs that increase awareness about
the existence of El Camino Real de los Tejas
National Historic Trail may lead to the
development of guidelines designed to
reduce visual and physical impacts from
development along the trail, helping
managers accommodate recreational

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences - Landownership and Use

motorized use, hiking, bicycling, equestrian,
and other activities along the route. Under
this alternative, there would be additional
funding available for trail-related protection
and recreation projects. The National Park
Service views practices that enhance
protection of trail resources as beneficial.
Cumulative Impacts: Although
increased urban development would not
necessarily decline due to the trail
designation, greater awareness of trail
resources might result in less detectable
changes in land use. The same would be
true for other forms of development
described in the cumulative impact
scenario. Alternative B would encourage
more interest in the protection of
resources along the trail, which could
entail changes in land use and
development trends. These cumulative
impacts would be moderate and
beneficial.
Conclusion: The trends identified under
the cumulative impacts scenario have the
potential to impact land use along the
trail. However, at the time this plan is
being prepared there are no specific
development projects being considered
that would have major impacts on
landownership and use. Alternative B
would result in moderate, beneficial, and
indirect cumulative impacts on
landownership and use along the trail.
SOCIOECONOMIC CONDITIONS
Socioeconomic factors include the trail’s
effects on social and economic conditions in
counties and parishes crossed by the trail
and on landownership.
Methodology

Socioeconomic data derived from the
United States Census (see Appendix L;
Tables L1-L3, page 249-page 251) and the latest
available tourism information for the states
of Louisiana and Texas (see Chapter 3,
Affected Environment, Section on Tourism,
page 108) were used to identify and discuss
potential impacts.

Clear and consistent hard data about the
economic impact of historic trail
designations are not available. The only
existing study concerns the Overmountain
Victory National Historic Trail, where the
data suggest that the biggest beneficiaries of
trail designation are establishments serving
food and beverages and the retail and
lodging industries along the trail route.
Issues of concern include opportunities to
create jobs related to tourism and hospitality
and federal government expenditures
associated with the administration of the
funds, such as Challenge Cost Share, an
appropriation from Congress that may not
be available every year. This program
requires partners to provide a minimum of
50% matching contribution in the form of
funds, equipment, in-kind labor, or supplies
from nonfederal sources.
Socioeconomic impacts were determined
based on professional expertise and
judgment. A qualitative analysis is sufficient
to compare the alternatives for decisionmaking purposes.
The thresholds of change for the intensity
of impacts on socioeconomic conditions are
defined as follows:
Negligible: Socioeconomic conditions
would not be affected, or effects would
not be measurable, or any changes would
not be related to the trail.
Minor: Changes in socioeconomic
conditions would be noticeable and
measurable. They would be linked to the
designation of the trail and associated
interpretation and development and
would affect a small percentage of
households in the counties and parishes
crossed by the trail.
Adverse–Impacts would slightly diminish
median household income and
employment opportunities.
Beneficial–Impacts would result in
enhanced median household income and
employment opportunities and possibly a
slight increase in high school graduation
levels.
Moderate: Changes in economic
conditions would be very apparent and
Page 133

C hapter 4: E nvironmental C onsequences

widespread within many of the counties
and parishes and would be closely linked
to trail development.
Adverse–Impacts would substantially
reduce median household income and
employment opportunities in various
counties and parishes.
Beneficial–Impacts would substantially
increase median household income and
employment opportunities in various
counties and parishes.
Major: Changes would be readily
apparent and clearly attributable to
development associated with the trail. It
would substantially change
socioeconomic conditions, median
household income, and employment
opportunities in most of the area crossed
by the trail.
Adverse–Impacts would greatly reduce
median household income and
employment opportunities in various
counties and parishes.
Beneficial–Impacts would greatly increase
median household income and
employment opportunities in various
counties and parishes.
Alternative A. Continuation of Current
Conditions (No Action)

With the exception of San Antonio
Missions National Historical Park and The
Alamo, most sites along El Camino Real de
los Tejas National Historic Trail receive
relatively few visitors. Total visitation
figures for all 15 state sites and museums for
which data are available (see Chapter 3,
Affected Environment, Table L-6, page 254)
indicate a total of slightly in excess of
one-quarter million visitors a year, but
many of those visits are not associated with
the designated trail. Visitors are mostly
attracted to the recreational opportunities
offered by sites along the trail, and even
though several of these facilities have trail
resources, few have interpretation
programs that are specifically trail related.
Trail development activities, such as the
installation of signage and expansion of
interpretation programs, have the potential
to attract additional visitors to the trail.
Page 134

Increased visitation is likely to result in
small increases in revenues and
employment associated with expanded
opportunities to provide services and retail
trade to visitors in the communities crossed
by the trail. Work opportunities in the
heritage tourism program and associated
industries would increase slightly. The
percentage of the population interested in
furthering their education might increase
slightly, since the heritage tourism industry
would require a certain level of education
and knowledge about the trail.
A very slight impact on economic
conditions might result from direct
government expenditures associated with
the administration of the trail. Under this
alternative, such expenditures would be
relatively small and geographically
circumscribed.
Cumulative Impacts: Several projects
identified in the cumulative impact
scenario have the potential to impact
socioeconomic conditions along the trail.
However, at the time this document is
being prepared, there is no information
on specific projects that would have any
type of impact on socioeconomic
conditions along the trail. At this time, it
is not possible to speculate on the overall
cumulative effect that these projects
would have on such conditions.
Conclusion: Some minor
socioeconomic benefits are likely to
result from trail development activities:
increased visitation and government
expenditures associated with the
development of this alternative.
Alternative A would result in minor,
long-term, and indirect beneficial
impacts on socioeconomic conditions
along the trail.
Alternative B, Preferred Alternative.
Trail Development through Partnerships

Efforts to protect, develop, maintain,
and interpret the trail would create some
new localized and relatively minor
spending. Expenditures for labor and
materials would be short term and would
accrue to a few individuals or firms. Some

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences - Socioeconomic Conditions

of the small communities along the trail
would likely benefit from increased
visitation and related expenditures. Local
businesses, such as food service, lodging,
camping stores, sporting goods, and
bookstores would receive some benefits
from sales to visitors. It would be possible
that small bed and breakfast establishments
operated by private landowners would open
as a result.
With the exception of San Antonio
Missions National Historical Park and The
Alamo, most sites along El Camino Real de
los Tejas National Historic Trail receive
relatively few visitors. Total visitation
figures for all 15 state sites and museums for
which data are available (see Appendix L,
Table L-6, page 254) indicate a total of slightly
in excess of one-quarter million visitors a
year. It should be noted that many of those
visits are not triggered by the presence of
the designated trail. Visitors are mostly
attracted to the recreational opportunities
offered by sites along the trail, and even
though many of these facilities have trail
resources, few have any interpretation
program that is specifically trail related.
Cumulative Impacts: Several projects
identified in the cumulative impact
scenario have the potential to impact
socioeconomic conditions along the trail.
However, at the time this document is
being prepared, there is no information
on specific projects that would have any
type of impact on socioeconomic
conditions along the trail. At this time it is
not possible to speculate on the overall
cumulative effect that these projects
would have on such conditions.
Conclusion: Implementing this
alternative is likely to strengthen the
regional and state economies through
increased tourism revenues. Increased
visitation to trail-related sites, segments,
and establishments would result in minor
growth in economic activity not only in
those communities along the trail
corridor but possibly in Texas and
Louisiana as a whole, because visitors
might extend their stay in the trail area if
there are additional opportunities to

learn about natural and cultural history
and to search for the trail. Federal
expenditures under this alternative
would be greater and possibly less
circumscribed geographically. While
there would be a beneficial impact from
such expenditures, it would be minor.
Alternative B would result in minor,
beneficial, long-term, and indirect
cumulative impacts on socioeconomic
conditions along the trail

UNACCEPTABLE IMPACTS
The National Park Service must prevent
any activities that would impair park
resources and values. The impact threshold
at which impairment occurs is not always
readily apparent. Therefore, the National
Park Service applies standards that offer
greater assurance that impairment will not
occur. The National Park Service will do
this by avoiding impacts that it determines
to be unacceptable. These are impacts that
fall short of impairment, but are still not
acceptable within a particular park’s
environment. Park managers must not
allow uses that would cause unacceptable
impacts; they must evaluate existing or
proposed uses and determine whether the
associated impacts on resources and values
are acceptable.
To determine if unacceptable impacts
could occur to the resources and values of
El Camino Real de los Tejas, the impacts of
the proposed actions in this environmental
assessment were evaluated based on
monitoring information, published
research, and professional expertise, and
compared to the guidance on unacceptable
impacts provided in Management Policies
1.4.7.1 that defines unacceptable impacts as
impacts that, individually or cumulatively,
would:
• Be inconsistent with a trail’s purposes
or values, or
• Impede the attainment of a trail’s
desired future conditions for natural
and cultural resources as identified
through the trail’s planning process, or

Page 135

C hapter 4: E nvironmental C onsequences

• Create an unsafe or unhealthful
environment for visitors or employees, or
• Diminish opportunities for current or
future generations to enjoy, learn
about, or be inspired by trail resources
or values, or
• Unreasonably interfere with:
 trail programs or activities, or
an appropriate use, or
the atmosphere of peace and
tranquility, or the natural
soundscape maintained in
wilderness and natural, historic, or
commemorative locations along the
trail.
By preventing unacceptable impacts,
trail administrators work with partners to
ensure that the proposed use of trail
resources will not conflict with the
conservation of those resources. In this
manner, the trail administrators ensure
compliance with the National Park Service
Organic Act’s separate mandate to conserve
resources and values. Using the guidance
above (see bullets), the following text
analyzes the potential for unacceptable
impacts for all alternatives carried forward
in this Environmental Assessment.
• Both alternatives are consistent with
the trail’s purposes and values. The
trail was established with the purpose
of identifying and protecting a
“historic route and its historic
remnants and artifacts for public use
and enjoyment.” If Alternative A were
selected, this might result in the loss of
resources, a loss that would increase
with the passage of time. This loss
would limit opportunities for the
public to use the trail and enjoy its
resources. If Alternative B, the
preferred alternative, were selected,
the trail administration would be
better able to prevent the loss of
resources and would be better
equipped to provide for public use and
enjoyment.
• Neither alternative would impede the
attainment of desired future conditions
Page 136

for natural and cultural resources along
the trail. Alternative A would be less
likely to enhance research and foster
the development of more adequate
protection strategies.
• Neither alternative would create an
unsafe or unhealthful environment for
visitors or employees. Under
Alternative B, trail development
projects would be more likely to
enhance visitor safety by providing
adequate parking and safe access to
resources.
• Under either alternative, visitors would
continue to have opportunities to
enjoy, learn about, or be inspired by
trail resources and values. Neither
alternative would change the overall
opportunities available to visitors.
Alternative A would maintain visitor
use and experience exactly as it is now.
Alternative B would substantially
enhance opportunities for visitors to
understand and appreciate resources
and would provide enhanced
recreational opportunities.
• Neither alternative would interfere
with programs or activities,
appropriate uses, or an atmosphere of
peace and tranquility along the trail.
Alternative B, through its emphasis on
partnerships, would enhance all trail
programs. Through its emphasis on
trail awareness it would tend to
maintain an atmosphere of peace and
tranquility along the designated routes
and would be more likely to encourage
appropriate uses.
Overall, the analysis of effects on trail
resources, interpretation, and visitor use
indicates that there are no major adverse
effects under either alternative; effects were
analyzed as negligible to moderate. Based
on this, and the above analysis, there would
be no unacceptable impacts from
Alternative A (No Action) or Alternative B
(Preferred)

Chapter 4: Environmental Consequences - Impairment

IMPAIRMENT
Impairment is an impact that in the
professional judgment of responsible
National Park Service’s managers would
harm the integrity of resources and values.
National Park Service’s Management
Policies, 2006 require the analysis of
potential effects to determine whether or
not actions would impair resources. The
fundamental purpose of the National Park
System, established by the Organic Act and
reaffirmed by the General Authorities Act,
as amended, begins with a mandate to
conserve resources and values. National
Park Service managers must always seek
ways to avoid, or to minimize to the greatest
degree practicable, adversely impacting
resources and values.

would have major or significant effects.
This Environmental Assessment identifies
less than major effects for all resource
topics. Guided by this analysis and the
Superintendent’s professional judgment,
there would be no impairment of trail
resources and values from the
implementation of either alternative.

However, the laws do give the National
Park Service management discretion to
allow impacts to resources and values when
necessary and appropriate, as long as the
impact does not constitute impairment of
the affected resources and values. Although
Congress has given the National Park
Service the management discretion to allow
certain impacts, that discretion is limited by
the statutory requirement that the National
Park Service must leave resources and
values unimpaired, unless a particular law
directly and specifically provides
otherwise. An impact to any resource or
value may, but does not necessarily,
constitute an impairment, but an impact
would be more likely to constitute an
impairment when there is a major or severe
adverse effect upon a resource or value
whose conservation is:
• necessary to fulfill specific purposes
identified in the establishing
legislation;
• key to the natural or cultural integrity
of the trail; or
• identified as a goal in the trail’s general
management plan or other relevant
National Park Service planning
documents.
The National Park Service’s threshold
for considering whether there could be an
impairment is based on whether an action

CHAPTER 5: CONSULTATION AND COORDINATION
INTRODUCTION
SCOPING MEETINGS
During the scoping process, the
planning team informed local, state, and
federal agencies and the public about the
development of the Comprehensive
Management Plan/Environmental
Assessment and solicited their comments in
order to identify issues and questions to
consider when developing the management
plan. The 60-day scoping period took place
between March 28 and May 31, 2007.
The scoping meetings were announced
through media releases, in two different
websites, and in a newsletter specifying
local schedules and meeting venues. The
Texas Historical Commission assisted by
announcing the scoping meetings and the
scoping process through their listserv at
www.heritage-tourism-list-l@lists.thc.state.
tx.us
Chambers of commerce in individual
communities also released scoping meeting
information. Eight public meetings took
place in locations along the trail, from
Laredo, Texas, to Natchitoches, Louisiana.
The meetings were attended by nearly 200
people. Among the attendees were
representatives from 60 private, state, and
federal entities. Written and verbal
comments are summarized and available at
www.nps.gov/elte
A series of planning issues, posed as the
questions listed below, were presented to the
public for consideration, both in the
newsletter and in the public meetings:
1) How will trail-related resources,
including historic buildings and sites,
archeological resources, and cultural
landscapes be identified and
protected?
2) How will visitors learn about and be
directed to trail-related cultural and
recreational activities?
3) How will coordinated trailwide
interpretation and education be
provided to visitors and local residents?

4) How will the perspectives of all
people associated with the trail’s
history be included in interpretive and
educational materials?
5) How can American and Mexican
perspectives on the trail be increased?
6) What is the most effective use of
partnerships to achieve goals for the
trail’s future?
Verbal and written comments received
during the scoping period and during these
meetings were considered in the
development of the alternatives presented in
this draft.
FEDERAL AGENCIES
Less than 1% of land along El Camino
Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail is
publicly owned. Aside from San Antonio
Missions National Historical Park and Cane
River Creole National Historical Park,
which are managed by the National Park
Service, the only other public lands adjacent
to the trail are portions of lands managed
by the U.S.D.A. Forest Service. U.S.D.A.
Forest Service personnel were contacted
during the early stage of the planning
process. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
scientists from the Southwest and Southeast
regional offices were consulted about
federally listed threatened and endangered
species found along the trail corridor.
STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES
This document was developed in close
consultation with the Texas Historical
Commission, the agency designatedas a key
partner in this project by the Texas State
Legislature. Staff from the Texas Division of
Archeology at the Texas Historical
Commission offered valuable assistance in
identifying high potential sites and
segments. The National Trails
Intermountain Region has also taken the
lead in highlighting possible construction
projects that might adversely impact
significant trail resources. The Louisiana
Department of Culture, Recreation, and
Tourism has been equally helpful.
Page 141

C hapter 5: C onsultation

and

C oordination

The Texas Historical Commission also
conducted a preliminary survey of
information on resources associated with
the trail. The information received was
voluminous and demonstrated widespread
enthusiasm for the trail. It included
documentation on museums, visitor
centers, community events, and festivals, as
well as the description of numerous sites
and segments. These materials were
compiled and were of assistance to the
contractor who developed the historic
resource database for the state of Texas.
Both the Texas and the Louisiana
departments of transportation have been
important partners in developing this plan.
They will continue to collaborate with the
National Trails Intermountain Region to
develop signage plans and other pertinent
projects.
The planning team received great
support during this process by staff from
McKinney Falls, Fort Boggy, and Mission
Tejas state parks, managed by the Texas
Parks and Wildlife Department, and Caddo
Mounds State Historic Park, managed by
the Texas Historical Commission; these are
all public parks with significant trail
resources. Staff from the Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department Division of Historic
Sites also joined the planning team in
assessing high potential sites and segments.
They have worked closely with the National
Trails Intermountain Region and will
become an important partner in the
implementation phase of the plan.
Interested landowners, members of El
Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic
Trail Association, and other trail advocates
also assisted the team in providing access to
significant sites or important information.
PUBLIC OUTREACH
The planning team developed a list of
contacts of nearly 1,000 individuals and
entities who have received newsletters and
other pertinent materials, such as a DVD,
On the Road to Partnerships, prepared to
support the planning effort.

Page 142

The planning team traveled the entire
length of the trail several times. Concerted
efforts to assess resources and to gather
input from interested trail advocates and
landowners took place throughout the
process. Starting in the fall of 2007, several
trips were made to Louisiana and East and
South Texas to meet with interested parties,
discuss trail-related issues, and develop
familiarity with the resources. Meetings
took place in Yorktown (DeWitt County),
Pearsall (Frio County), Victoria (Victoria
County), Goliad, Bryan/College Station
(Brazos County), Rockdale (Milam
County), and many other locations.
Presentations at professional meetings and
workshops also attempted to provide the
public with updates about the planning
document.
In Louisiana, members of the planning
team also met with representatives of two
state-recognized tribes: the Adai Indian
Nation and the Choctaw-Apache
Community of Ebarb.
ORGANIZATIONS
El Camino Real de los Tejas National
Historic Trail Association played a key role
in the development of this draft plan.
Members contributed information and
assisted the planning team in identifying
resources of significance and arranging for
landowners to become involved in this
planning effort. County and parish historic
commissions were also important in
providing information and assisting in
organizing meetings and visiting sites.
EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS
There are several institutions of higher
learning along the trail. An effort was made
throughout this planning effort to contact
those faculty members who are recognized
trail experts or who could make a sizable
contribution to this project.

Chapter 5: Consultation and Coordination - Government-to-Government Consultation

CONSULTATION WITH AMERICAN
INDIAN TRIBES
GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT
CONSULTATION
Government-to-government
consultation is the basic means by which
American Indian tribes and federal agencies
approach and resolve differences in the
application of policies and regulations.
Government-to-government consultation
recognizes that tribes are sovereign nations
within the United States and that there is a
unique legal and historic relationship
between the United States government and
Indian tribes, shaped by treaties,
congressional acts, court decisions,
executive orders, and other actions of the
Executive Branch.
Numerous laws require agencies to
consult with American Indian tribes on
federal actions. Federal actions are defined
as projects, activities, or programs funded
in whole or in part under the direct or
indirect jurisdiction of a federal agency,
including those carried out by or on behalf
of a federal agency; those carried out with
federal financial assistance; those requiring
a federal permit, license, or approval; and
those subject to state or local regulation,
pursuant to a delegation or approval by a
federal agency. The decision for an agency
to enter into government-to-government
consultation with American Indian tribes
depends upon the agency’s adherence to
federal law, regulation, and agency policy,
as well as on the nature and scale of the
project. Tribal governments may also, at
their discretion, request formal
consultation on issues of interest.
The challenge for administrators of El
Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic
Trail is that, historically, Louisiana and
Texas, the states through which the trail
passes, had a very aggressive policy of
removing American Indian tribes from
their native lands. Federal removal
programs in the 19th century required
many American tribes to move to lands that
were not their home. Such was the case for
the Caddo, Wichita, Tonkawa, Comanche,

and other tribes. Some tribes voluntarily
removed to other states. Today, many of
their descendants have still not been
granted federal recognition as American
Indian tribes, even though they are
acknowledged as “State Recognized Tribes”
in the state where they live.
It is the policy of the National Trails
Intermountain Region to abide by the
language contained in the National Historic
Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470w):
An Indian tribe means an Indian tribe,
band, nation, or other organized group
of community, including a Native Village, Regional Corporation or Village
Corporation, as those terms are defined
in Section 3 of the Alaska Native Claims
Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1602), which
is recognized as eligible for the special
programs and services provided by the
United States to Indians because of their
status as Indians.
The key word in this law is “recognized,”
meaning federally recognized tribes. It is
the policy of the National Trails
Intermountain Region to abide by a
government-to-government relationship
with federally recognized tribes; however,
this government-to-government
relationship does not apply to groups who
are not federally recognized.
Methodology
Recognizing the important role played
by American Indian groups in establishing
routes that later became El Camino Real de
los Tejas National Historic Trail, the
planning team made a special effort to
engage all potentially affected American
Indian groups in the planning process.
Formal consultation began in October
2007. All federally recognized tribes in
Texas and Louisiana were contacted. Some
of these tribes reside in Texas and
Louisiana, while others are located in
Oklahoma. The former include the
Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas, the
Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas, the
Louisiana Coushatta Indian Tribe, the
Louisiana Jena Band of Choctaw Indians,

and

the Chitimacha Tribe of Louisiana, and the
Louisiana Tunica-Biloxi Tribe. Federally
recognized tribes residing in Oklahoma
include the Caddo, the Comanche, the
Tonkawa, the Kiowa, and the Wichita &
Affiliated tribes.
After initial phone contacts, members of
the planning team made visits to a number
of these groups: the Kickapoo in April 2008;
the Caddo in October 2007, February and
March 2008, and March 2009; and the
Comanche, the Tonkawa, and the Wichita
& Affiliated tribes in October 2007.
In an effort to solicit input from as many
associated and interested parties as
possible, the planning team also met with
representatives from two non-federally
recognized tribal entities in Louisiana in
September 2007. These meetings did not
represent government-to-government
consultation. And, although the
representatives expressed interest in
participating in the project, the input they
offered for incorporation in this plan was
limited, due to changes in personnel or
other issues. The planning team will
continue to work with these groups, as their
perspectives are key in the future
interpretive program for the trail.
On March 2009, at a meeting with the
Caddo Nation Tribal Council in Binger,
Oklahoma, further government-togovernment consultation took place, and
focused on the development of this
document. Several issues were discussed,
among them the identification of sites,
landmarks, and sacred places along the
trail-designated routes that are important
to the Caddo Nation.
The discussion also focused on the
development of an oral history program to
record stories from tribal elders before they
pass on. The Caddo Tribal Council
expressed interest in working with the
National Trails Intermountain Region to
tell the ”real” stories of the Caddo and El
Camino Real. The tribal council viewed the
opportunity to participate in the
development of this document as a way to
allow the Caddo Nation to partner in
developing interpretive materials that
Page 144

reflect the Caddo’s perspective.
The Caddo Tribal Council also
expressed support for signage and
interpretation programs along the trail,
particularly at Caddo sites. The tribal
council reminded the National Trails
Intermountain Region that all Caddo site
are sacred and should be accorded that
recognition in resource management and
interpretation activities.
The executive director of the Comanche
Nation of Oklahoma has also expressed
interest in participating in the development
of El Camino Real de los Tejas National
Historic Trail.
TRIBAL LISTENING SESSIONS
Tribal listening sessions in association
with public review of the Comprehensive
Management Plan for El Camino Real los
Tejas National Historic Trail took place in
Austin, Texas (August 31-September 1, 2010)
and in Lawton, Oklahoma (December 9,
2010).
The overall objective of these sessions
was to encourage the participation of the
federally recognized tribes in planning for
the future development of the trail and to
help them understand the role of trail
administration, the strength of partnership
efforts, and how the National Park Service
can support such efforts.
The specific objectives of the listening
sessions included the following:
• Explain the designation of a national
historic trail and the role of the National
Trails Intermountain Region office in
administering trails;
• Explain the role of partnerships in trail
administration using El Camino Real de
Los Tejas National Historic Trail
Association as an example;
• Provide opportunities for dialogue
among tribes, the National Park Service
and the trail association;
• Explain the Challenge Cost Share
Program and the process of Cooperative
Agreements and how this would benefit the
tribes;
• request tribal response to the following
questions:
a. How can we actively involve the
tribes?

Chapter 5: Consultation and Coordination

b. How can we incorporate tribal
interests in resource identification and
protection as well as education?
c. How can we include tribal
perspectives in telling the story of El
Camino Real de Los Tejas National Historic
Trail?
All federally recognized tribes identified
in this document as associated with the trail
were invited. The Superintendent of the
National Trails Intermountain Region, who
attended both sessions, highlighted the
crucial role of establishing a dialogue with
federally recognized American Indian
tribes early on in the process of trail
administration. He stressed that tribal
involvement is highly essential in
identifying and protecting resources,
including traditional cultural properties, as
well as in the development of educational
opportunities.
He also explained the potential for
technical assistance to the tribes through
the Challenge Cost Share Program as well
as interpretive/educational programs that
would highlight the American Indian
perspective in narrating the history of the
American Indian peoples and their
association to the trail. The tribal
representatives who attended these sessions
believe that archival materials on which
history is based, quite often only present
one point of view and fail to accurately
reflect the whole truth and, in particular,
the perspective of the tribes.
Tribal representatives also expressed the
need to develop a relationship of trust. All
participants acknowledged that building
trust would take considerable time and
effort on the part of the American Indians
as well as the National Trails Intermountain
Region staff and the members of the trail
association.
Both listening sessions ended with a
series of recommendations that would
foster better communication between the
National Park Service and the tribes, lead to
more effective cooperation, and eventually
bring about a level of confidence and trust
among a wide array of trail partners.
