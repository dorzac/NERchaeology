The Rowland Clark (41RR77) Site,
Red River County, Texas
Gregory Perino
with contributions by Leonard Blake and Carol J. Loveland

EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION
The Rowland Clark (41RR77) and Dan Holdeman (41RR11) archaeological sites
were excavated in the late 1970s and early 1980s by Gregory Perino of the Museum of Red
River in Idabel, Oklahoma. Manuscripts on those investigations were prepared by Perino
shortly after the conclusion of the work, but these were never published, remaining instead
on file at the Museum of the Red River.
After discussions with Mary Herron of the Museum of the Red River, and Gregory
Perino (now retired), the Friends of Northeast Texas Archaeology was granted permission
to edit and publish the two manuscripts in two volumes of the Journal of Northeast Texas
Archaeology. The Rowland Clark manuscript is being published in No. 4 of the journal, to
be followed in 1995 with the Dan Holdeman report in No. 5.
There have been all too few recent archaeological investigations of Caddoan sites on
the Red River in Northeast Texas (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993; Bruseth 1994), with the
notable exception of the Museum of the Red River's excavations at the Bob Williams
(Perino 1983) site and the 1991-1992 Texas Archeological Society's field schools at the
Roitsch, Fasken, Ray, and Saltwell Slough sites in Red River and Lamar counties (Bruseth
et al. 1991, 1992). It is fair, but unfortunate, to state that this part of the Caddoan
archaeological area remains poorly known (e.g., Perttula 1992a), while the looting and
vandalism of important Caddoan sites along the Red River continues unabated (Perttula
1992b).
This makes the publication of Perino's work notable for two principal reasons.
First, the Museum of the Red River excavations recovered significant archaeological data
on the nature of Caddoan occupations from ca. A.D. 900 to 1600 in the Red River valley-including bioarchaeological and paleobotanical remains (see appendices by Blake and
Loveland, this volume). And second, the publication of these reports will make this
information available to Caddoan archaeologists and to all those interested in the prehistory
and early history of the Caddoan peoples.

Archaeological Research at the Rowland
Clark Site (41RR77), Red River County, Texas
Introduction and Site Setting
The Rowland Clark site is located in Red River County, Texas, on a prehistoric
river channel of the Red River that has been intersected by a more recent channel of the
river. It is approximately 16 km south of the Arnold Roitsch or Sam Kaufman (41RR16)
site. The site had small Coles Creek and Early Caddoan period occupations, but the major
occupation was of a McCurtain phase group of the Late Caddoan period. I
The site has been in the Clark family for more than a century. The land the site is on
is the property of Mr. Rowland Clark.
The site lies on a narrow alluvial terrace at the edge of the floodplain, and it is
bounded on the north by a comparatively recent river bank with springs at the base (Figure
1). An older river bank is to the east, and to the west is a small range of sandy pimple
mounds, some 5-6 feet tall. These pimple mounds may be ancient sand dunes. A shallow
swampy depression, part of an older watercourse, lies between the sandy mounds and the
site.
Soils at Rowland Clark consist of 0. 75-1 meter of sandy loam overlying 5-8 em of
a red gumbo-like clay, which in turn overlies a black gumbo clay deposit of unknown
depth. These are favored agricultural soils because the gumbo hardpan retains water above
it so that it is available to most plants when it is needed. This characteristic of the soil was
detrimental to the preservation of site burials, artifacts, and faunal and floral remains.
The Rowland Clark site primarily contains a McCurtain phase village with one
small plowed-down mound (ca. 1 meter in height). West of it was a broad, low, terrace
rise where farmsteads and attendant house patterns were preserved. The mound and the
village are approximately 200 meters southeast of what likely was the contemporary river
bank; the river today is 1.2 km north and east of the site.
A small amount of artifacts were found on the site in the five years preceding
Museum of the Red River excavations. The prehistoric artifacts included sections of small,
thin clay pipestems, five celts, three celt preforms, cobble and anvil tools, pitted cobbles,
lithic debris, a few pottery sherds, two stone cobble pottery trowels, three Caddoan
harnmerstones with faceted working ends, one edge-prepared tool used in chert knapping,
one un-notched Mineral Springs knife, and 23 projectile points (one serrated Agee, nine
Alba, two side-notched arrow points, seven Fresno and Maud, three comer-notched arrow
points, and three Gary dart points).
The Agee arrow point, the Mineral Springs knife, and a few Coles Creek pottery
sherds indicate that a small Coles Creek period/late Fourche Maline occupation (ca. A.D.
700-900) was present on the alluvial terrace. No features or house sites were identified in
our excavations for this occupation, or with the Early Caddoan period occupation
represented by the Alba arrowpoints.
Early nineteenth century materials are present as well, namely: a pewter button with
four holes, part of the base of a green wine glass bottle, and two pieces of hand-painted
refined earthenware. This is the kind of material expected to occur on early Choctaw sites
when they began to occupy the area across the Red River in southeastern Oklahoma, as
well as on early frontier Anglo-American sites.

I Perino's terminology has been revised and updated, following Schambach (1982), Story (1990) and
Bruseth (1994), as follows: Perino uses Coles Creek, Gibson period, McCurtain Focus, and Fulton period,
and I have changed them to Coles Creek (late Fourche Maline), Early Caddoan, McCurtain phase, and Late
Caddoan period, respectively.

Our excavations, which were conducted in April-May 1981, were located between
the bank of the terrace and the mound. There, we found evidence of a lengthy and intensive
Caddoan occupation with overlapping house patterns and two cemeteries; the habitation
areas were identified by carbon-darkened soil, pottery sherds, and lithic debris (Figure 2).
Unfortunately, the site has been cultivated for more than 100 years, and consequently much
soil has eroded from it, also plowing up hearths and house floors.
The excavation area had many postmolds, smudge pits, and an assortment of small
to large pits, and appears to have been the most intensively used part of the site. There were
a few houses near the mound, but none showed the amount of activity as those in our
excavation area.
The two cemeteries were discrete in that one contained the remains of early
McCurtain phase burials and the other the remains of later McCurtain phase burials. The
later graves were near the edge of the river terrace, but were more scattered than the early
McCurtain graves; the later cemetery was also in an area that had early McCurtain phase
house remains, which indicates some lapse of time between the use of the two cemeteries.
These were farther back from the terrace edge and were closer together. Both cemeteries
had a northeast-southwest orientation.
The placement of the cemeteries suggests that the Caddo occupants of the site were
able to recognize the locations of earlier graves when they returned to habitation sites like
Rowland Clark. Three factors may be pertinent: (1) Caddoan farmsteads were apparently
surrounded by a hedge of trees, and many of the trees would still be living even after an
absence of a century or more; (2) some Caddoan houses were of the sub-floor type, and a
depression would still exist that marked its location; and (3) earlier graves would be evident
by depressions created by the collapse of grave timbers upon which small piles of dirt had
been placed. New graves were often excavated near the edges of the older cemeteries.
Judging from the associated artifacts, the earlier cemetery dates from ca. A.D.
1300-1450. The later McCurtain phase burials are estimated to date primarily from ca. A.D.
1550-1650, with a few (Burials 36-38) dating as late as A.D. 1700. The earlier graves
were wider and longer, and contained more grave goods than did the post-A.D. 1550
burials, which became progressively narrower and had fewer grave goods by early historic
times.

The Rowland Clark Mound
The mound was reported to me to have been excavated many years ago by an
individual who claimed to have found a clay pipe in it. The Museum of the Red River tested
the mound with a soil corer several years prior to 1981, and we determined that it had been
plowed down over time to a height of ca. 90-120 em. It was about 12.2 meters in width
and 18.3 meters in length, and it appeared as if the rear of the mound had a broad apron
that was lower than the conical portion in the front.
Under the conical portion of the mound is a burned house, denoted by a thick layer
of burned clay with its floor about 60 em deep in the mound fill. The apron portion is
nearly flat, and when probed a group of five vessels were located only a few em below the
plow zone; the plow had damaged the vessels slightly.
The vessels may have marked a grave, although no human remains were noted. The
vessel types can be attributed to the late McCurtain phase, ca. A.D. 1600. The vessels
consisted of:
o an Emory Punctated jar with castellated rim and saddle-like handles; a
short appliqued strip extends vertically onto the shoulder below each
handle.
o a red, conical Simms Engraved bowl.

o a V -shaped black bowl with an A very Engraved sunrise motif repeated
five times on the sides, and spaced by large blank circles and cross-hatched
panel dividers.
o black A very Engraved carinated bowl with red pigment in the engraved
lines; the decoration consisted of cross-hatched panel dividers and four
groups of nested circles with a toothed circular sunray design in the center
of each group, and a small circle inside the sunray circle; and
o a black, polished, vase-like Avery Engraved bowl with three decorative
panels (notched or toothed scrolls filled with hatchured lines), with circles
and cross-hatching in the panel dividers. It has an everted, castellated rim
with saddle-like handles, and there are three engraved lines on the outer rim
surface.

1981 Excavations
Our excavations were conducted in 10 foot squares (3.05 meters square) that were
taken to the sterile subsoil. Squares were assigned alphanumeric designations (i.e., 1-8
from south to north, and A-H from west to east as well as aa-dd from east to west) (see
Figure 2). After the plow zone and A-horizon from the first four squares was removed and
screened, it became apparent that very little cultural material was to be found other than
cultural features From that point, the excavations in the other 66 10 foot squares proceeded
to a depth of ca. 61 em, and identified features were recorded and excavated; in most cases,
once the plow zone and some of the A-horizon was removed, features were recognizable.
Based on our probing, we expected to demarcate a late McCurtain phase cemetery
near the edge of the terrace; the early McCurtain phase cemetery was unanticipated. We
located this group of graves (see Figure 2) where Burial 21 was located when our
excavations were extended to include a previously identified burned Caddoan house area.

Burial Features
Burial features were recognizable because the grave pits had been excavated
through the sandy loam and red clay into the black gumbo, and the red clay mottling
marked the feature fill against the tan or buff-colored subsoil. Once the red clay mottles in
the black gumbo were removed, the complete outline of each burial pit was disclosed.
Based on excavations at the Haley site in southwest Arkansas (Perino 1967), the aboriginal
digging of the pits through the gumbo soils was accomplished by excavating a trench along
one wall12-15 em deep, then driving a wood stake into the soil near the trench to break out
chunks of the gumbo; these chunks then became mixed in the sandy backfill of the graves.
The 39 burials excavated at Rowland Clark were found in two cemeteries: Burials
1-21 in the western part of the excavations, dating from ca. A.D. 1300-1450, and Burials
22-39 in the eastern part of the grid, dating from ca. A.D. 1550 to near A.D. 1700; Burials
36-39 date after ca. A.D. 1650.
The earliest burials were in deep (97-158 em), wide (92-123 em), and long (200276 em) grave pits, with squared to rounded ends. Based on the shape or opening outline,
it is likely that some of the graves may have been excavated by the same individuals:
Burials 1, 3-4, and 8 (square-ended) and Burials 9-11 and 13 (rounded ends). The large
grave pit size was the result, in part, of the area needed to accommodate the many ceramic
vessels that often accompanied the early McCurtain phase burials. The late McCurtain
phase burials were narrower and shorter (Burials 22-35 were 102 em deep, 51-92 em
wide, and 179-248 em wide), and they also contained fewer grave goods. Burials 36-39
ranged from 95-121 em in depth, 59-77 em in width, and 174-215 em in length.

In general, the skeletal material was in poor condition (see Loveland, Appendix 2,
this volume) because the adult burials were placed in pits within a water-saturated black
clay gumbo stratum that dissolved many of the bones (Figure 3). The burials of children
were usually associated with house floors, and were placed in shallow pits within the
sandy loam stratum. They were poorly preserved as well, probably because of bioturbation
and rodent activities.
The burials are individually described in this section of the report. Information
provided on each of the burials includes age, provenience, depth, grave size, head
orientation, and grave good inclusions.

Age:Child
Provenience:4E
Depth:77 em
Grave Size:49 x 98 em
Head Orientation:Nmth-Northeast
Grave Goods:One small, globular jar with strap handles and a pinched decoration on the
shoulders (see Figure 7g).
Two other possible burials were recorded in the excavations, Feature 21 (Squares
lA and 1B) and Feature 62 (Square 5H) (See Figure 2). Feature 21 was probably a child's
grave, although no bones remained in the pit. The pit was ca. 44 em deep. Feature 62
consisted of the bottom of a ceramic bottle; the upper part had been plowed away. It may be
associated with Burial 34 since it is near the eastern end of the grave.

Features
A variety of other types of McCurtain phase features were excavated at the Rowland
Clark site. These were recognized after the plow zone was cleared away. Although many
post molds were found, no specific house patterns could be defined; the numbers of post
molds suggest an intensive occupation during the McCurtain phase in the excavation area.
Included in the 67 other features were pits (ranging from postmolds to smudge pits) and
hearths, as well as one dog burial.
The most interesting features were the smudge pits in which com cobs, wood, and
pine cones were burned to create a smudge or smoke for curing skins. Smudge pits were
commonly found in groups in the area where houses had apparently been constructed.
These pits were generally 26-47 em in diameter and about 30-47 em in depth. Com cobs
were used most often in the smudge pits (see also Appendix 1 by Blake, this volume), but
wood and pine cones were used on occasion independently or mixed with other plant
materials. In some cases postholes were reutilized as smudge pits and ash pits; previous
excavations on the Red River had not previously documented this type of feature re-use.
Information on the 28 smudge pits is provided in Table 1.

Smudge pits are thought to have been used for the smoke-curing of skins (Binford
1967), although Munson ( 1969) suggests that the smoke from them might have been used
to smudge pottery.
Two kinds of hearths were noted among the 21 hearths at the Rowland Clark site.
The first kind (N=6) was found on house floors and had flat, burned areas with several em
of ash still lying on them. The other kind of hearth (N=15) consisted of heavily burned
floors in pits; the pit fills contained layers of ash and scattered charcoal. These hearths in
pits were usually between 1-1.25 m in diameter. Table 2 summarizes information on the
two kinds of Rowland Clark hearths.

Artifact Assemblage2
The Form and Design of the Ceramics
The ceramics from the Rowland Clark site include jars, bottles, and bowls.3 In the
discussion that follows, I will discuss each of the vessel forms and how they changed
through time in shape, rim treatment, and decoration.
The jars at the site principally include the McKinney Plain, Nash Neck-Banded, and
Emory Punctated-Incised types, although a portion of a Canton Incised jar was recovered
in Feature 67. There is little change during the McCurtain phase occupation of Rowland
Clark in the jars.
In the early McCurtain phase, the Nash Neck-Banded jars were usually rounded to
globular in shape and decorated with straight or broken incised lines comprised of dashes
(see Figure 7a, g). In some cases, a vertical incised line extended from a horizontal incised
line on the shoulder to one near the base. Later in the phase, the incised lines were replaced
by four equally spaced appliqued or engraved triangles (plain, notched, or chevron leaf-like
designs [see Figure 7f] that extended downward from the shoulders; in a few cases, the
upper body is incised or engraved as well. Jars also became more elongated, with vertical
rims, and by ca. A.D. 1700 they had a melon shape with highly everted rims.
Up to ca. A.D. 1650, jars often had castellated rims; this is particularly the case
from ca. A.D. 1300-1450. These rims had four equally-spaced peaks or high points. Jar
handles changed from loop and strap handles to lugs and closed decorative appliqued
designs by late McCurtain times.
Emory Punctated-Incised jars dating from ca. A.D. 1300-1450 had fingernail
punctates (see Figure 4k and Figure 7b-c) or pinching. Later examples had angular
punctations probably made with stone flakes, sharp sticks, or cane.
Plain bottles and A very Engraved bottles with carinated bodies and straight necks
are indicative of early and late McCurtain phase ceramics. By ca. A.D. 1650-1700, bottle
decorations changed to Hudson Engraved and Keno Trailed, and the bottles had spool
necks. The early A very Engraved bottles have fine engraved lines, and the lines may be
filled with red pigment.
A painted bottle was found in Burial 13 that has grog temper. It is buff in color with
a tall, straight red-painted neck and three large painted dots on the body (see Figure 8g). It
resembles painted Middle Mississippi period bottles from northeast Arkansas and southeast
Missouri.
The Rowland Clark bowls have considerable variation in size, shape, and
decoration. Many of the plain bowls have flat bottoms and V -shaped sides similar to the
bowls found in the Sanders phase; in fact, Sanders-like vessels constitute a goodly part of
the plain pottery in the early McCurtain phase.
2 Other than pottery sherds, bones, and small cobbles and pebbles, few artifacts of note were found in the
excavations outside of features. They include: Gary points (squares IE, 4D, 6C, and 7A); unidentified sidenotched (IE), corner-notched (4G), stemmed (7B), and contracting stem (IH) arrow points; Alba arrow point
(3G); Agee arrow points (3G, 5B); a cobble anvil (IH); manos (IH, 2G, 3C, 7D); sandstone and
ferruginous sandstone abraders (IH, 4B, 5F, 5H, 6C, 6F[2], 6aa); hammerstones (2F, 3D, 3E, 5aa);
hematite with abraded surfaces (6aa); celts and celt preforms (2H, 3A, 3D, 4B, 4F, 5A, 5H, 5aa, 6B, 6F,
6G, 6aa, 6bb, 7B, 7aa, 7bb, and 8A); quartz crystal (3D); quartz cobble (6F); limonite slab (5E); flat
sandstone slabs (5bb[2]); a rectangular stone (6bb); utilized flake (2G); Coles Creek Incised rim (5E); Red
River pipe, variety Haley (5E); pottery disk (4F, 5G, 6H, 6cc); clay earplug (2G, 5L); and mud-dauber nests
(2F, 5G).
3 Although Perino does not discuss the temper of the Rowland Clark ceramics, inspection of the collections

at the Museum of the Red River indicates that it is primarily shell-tempered; in some cases, a shelltempered grog was employed as an aplastic [Editor's note].

Engraved carinated bowls with constricted necks and flaring rims have several
different kinds of decorations during the early McCurtain phase. One unslipped bowl
(Burial4) had a castellated rim, strap handles, and fingernail punctates on the collar and rim
(Figure 9c). This form loses the handles and punctates, instead having a red slip with the
Avery Engraved decoration (classic early form is similar to the sunrise motif) on the
shoulders. Burial 7 had a classic, but unslipped, Avery Engraved form with a scalloped rim
(Figure 9e). Scalloped rims are restricted to the early McCurtain phase, and likely were
derived from Sanders phase ceramics. Burial 6, by contrast, had two different Avery
Engraved bowls: one with a castellated rim and loop handles and an almost vertical neck,
and the other with a carinated body, straight neck, and scalloped rim (Figure 9d, f).
Tall, conical Avery Engraved bowls developed first from elongated V-shaped
bowls (common in the earlier Sanders phase) with two forms: (1) with a plain, vertical rim;
and (2) one with a short, angular or carinated rim (the Simms-like form; as this form was
later used for deep, conical bowls with Simms Engraved decorations). The latter variety
often had scalloped rims (Figure lOa-b).
The vertical rimmed variety became more common through time, and between ca.
A.D. 1300-1450, these bowls had wide mouths with the Avery Engraved decoration
extending from the rim down two-thirds its height (Figure 11a-d). Rarely, the carinated rim
bowl form had a narrow Avery Engraved decoration on the narrow shoulder (see Figure
10d); this was later replaced by the Simms Engraved decoration.
From about A.D. 1450-1650, the tall, conical bowls developed slightly narrower
orifices, and the Avery Engraved decoration covered only about 33 percent of the upper rim
area (Figure 12). This late form of the tall, conical bowl appears first in the Burial 17
assemblage, about the same time the scalloped rim edges are no longer made with the
Simms vessels. After ca. A.D. 1650, the sides of the bowls curve outward at the rim, and
scroll-like Hodges Engraved and Taylor Engraved motifs replace them on these vessel
forms (see Figure 12e).
As mentioned above, some early Simms type bowls had A very Engraved
decorations on the shoulders of the narrow, inverted rims, but they soon had their own
distinctive design elements (Figure 13i). Simms bowls differ from Avery Engraved bowls
in that the former have a short, angular offset rim, while the latter have straight rims.
The shallow, carinated bowls at Rowland Clark occur with Avery Engraved
designs (see Figure 13e), with a variety of Simms Engraved, and as a ceramic variety we
are tentatively referring to as Clark Engraved. Clark Engraved carinated bowls are a
common bowl form during the early McCurtain phase.
The engraved motifs on Clark Engraved have four or (rarely) five panels on the
shoulder decorated with an upper and a lower double line filled with groups of short
vertical lines or cross-hatching. Panel ends may be rounded with the curves back-to-hack in
reverse parentheses, or with the line ends pointing towards each other to form partial circles
(see Figure 13a, c-d, f-h). The S-shaped motif is sometimes featured in design elements as
well. Figure 14a-h illustrates the most common Clark Engraved designs.
Clark Engraved bowls frequently have four small and outward projecting sprocketlike lugs on the vessel rim; the sprocket-like lugs slant from the top of the sprocket to the
base of the next adjoining sprocket. Some Clark Engraved bowls have small, flattened lugs
on the rim, and others have an extra sprocketed rim (see Figure 13f).
An assortment of other small bowl forms were identified at the Rowland Clark site,
including noded bowls, effigy bowls, and bowls with castellated rims and lug handles
(Figure 15). These bowls occur almost exclusively in the early McCurtain phase burials at
the site.

Clay Pipes
Clay pipes were present in 13 burials at Rowland Clark. The early McCurtain phase
pipes were plain (Figure 16g), and generally resembled the Haley variety of the Red River
pipe defined by Hoffman (1967). They were different, however, in having an abbreviated
stem designed to take a reed or wooden stem rather than the clay stem integral to the Haley
pipes. The later McCurtain phase pipes were elbow forms (Figure 16d-e). One late pipe
had an engraved decoration on it identical with decorations found on Taylor Engraved
ceramics from the site (Figure 16a).
Pottery Disks
This artifact category includes one complete and three fragmentary specimens from
the McCurtain phase village area. They may have been used as spindle-whorls.
Clay Earplugs
Untempered, baked clay earplugs are seldom found on Caddoan sites along the Red
River; one was recovered from a late McCurtain phase burial at the Bob Williams site
(Perino 1983). The two earplugs were in what may have been different postmolds.
The earplugs are about 1.6 em in length, 1.9 em wide at the mushroomed face end,
and approximately 1.6 em wide at the mushroomed basal end (see Figure 4a-b). The central
column is constricted to 1.3 em in diameter. Although the actual use of these specimens is
unclear, they may have used as "training" plugs to keep holes in pierced ears open when
the more decorative shell disk type of ear plug was used as an ornament.
Chipped and Ground Stone
This artifact category includes dart points, arrow points, celts, and ground hematite;
scrapers, cutting tools, and utilized flakes were rare. The dart points consist of a few small
Gary points, while the arrow points were found in numbers only with the burials.
Four main types of Caddoan arrow points were recovered from Row land Clark: the
Scallorn sattler, Washita peno, Maud, and Talco types. The varieties of SeaBorn and
Washita arrows (cf. Brown 1976) occur in the early McCurtain phase graves, along with
one Haskell arrow point. The triangular Maud and Talco arrows characterize the late
McCurtain phase, although one Bassett was found in Burial 36.
The Scallorn sattler arrow is most frequent in the early McCurtain phase; the
Washitapeno variety is relatively rare in the area, and has not been found as the sole arrow
point type in mortuary contexts in the middle Red River. Also during this time, some
corner-notched arrow points that had the stems broken off were reworked and hafted as
triangular points. Many of the Scallorn specimens were made on curved flakes with only
one well-chipped side; the other side often showed a broad flake scar. The later triangular
arrows were completely chipped on both sides of relatively straight flakes.
The triangular arrows at Rowland Clark ranged from having needle-like tips and
concave basal edges (Maud), to simple triangles (resembling the Fresno type), to arrows
with a broad, concave basal edge and an accentuated needle tip (Talco). A few Maud points
have rudimentary side notches (see Figure 6a); triangular arrows with the same style of
notching have been recovered on contemporaneous Titus phase sites in the Cypress Creek
basin (Turner 1978).
There appear to be regional changes in the types of cherts used for making arrow
points during the McCurtain phase. During the early McCurtain phase (at Rowland Clark as
well as the Roitsch, Bob Williams, and Roden sites), cherts preferred included novaculite,
siltstone, Battiest chert, Big Fork chert (black and green varieties), Woodford chert, and
various cobble cherts; these Ouachita Mountains materials could all be gathered in the Red

River gravels below the mouth of the Kiamichi River, or in the Red River downstream
from the Glover and Mountain Fork rivers (Banks 1990). Some of the cherts (deep,
translucent brown in color) resemble Edwards chert from Central Texas. Ogallala quartzite
was the dominant material used for producing Maud and Talco arrows in the late McCurtain
phase. The Caddo appear to have heat-treated the fine-grained quartzite, as the arrow points
on this material were well made and finely flaked.
Many of the celt preforms were made of local diorites that were first chipped to
form, then ground and polished to finish the piece. Hatton Tuff and Colbert Creek diorite
lithic debris is quite common on McCurtain phase sites in the middle Red River, indicating
that celt manufacture was important in Late Caddoan times. As the local diorites were not
particularly durable, and fractured easily, many celts needed to be made to satisfy the
demand for these tools. Most Caddoan celts are roughly made, being essentially a stone,
slab, or cobble with a bit for cutting. To make the celts last longer, the Caddo rounded the
bits to have a more obtuse cutting edge; this lessened their cutting ability, however. Other
celts were made of slate and slabs of Ouachita Mountains quartzite (Banks 1990; Banks and
Winters 1975).
Finely-made celts are rare in the McCurtain phase, but are sometimes found with
high-status burials. Well made celts are more common in Mississippian sites to the east and
north where glacial diorite is found.
A possible slate celt with an offset bit more like an adze, or a fleshing tool, was
placed with Burial 38, a historic Caddoan male burial (see Figure 5p). This tool had the
angular form of the Avery Engraved decoration on either side of the poll; I doubt the tool
was hafted like an adze as this would have obscured the decoration. If correct, it would
have made an excellent fleshing tool, like those made from sections of deer leg bones. A
similar slate tool was recovered in Feature 69, which contained an early McCurtain phase
tool cache.
One ground hematite fragment was found in the Rowland Clark excavations. This
material was probably used to make a red pigment for body decorations and for coloring
pottery. On the Red River, hematite is often found as a mortuary offering with Caddo
males.
Bone Artifacts
Most of the bone artifacts from Rowland Clark were found in mortuary contexts.
Identified tool forms include deer jaw picks (possibly used for excavating graves and pits),
deer ulna knapping tools (in the Feature 69 tool cache and in early McCurtain phase
burials), and sections of antler from tool knapping (Burial25).
Mud-Dauber Nests
Two mud-dauber nests were recovered at the site. These wasps attached their mud
nests to various parts of Caddoan houses, such as the timbers or thatch, and the
impressions suggest one had been attached to poles about 2.5 em in diameter, while the
other had grass or thatch impressions.

Food Remains
Corn was obviously commonly used as food since charred corn cobs were
numerous in the smudge pits at Rowland Clark (Blake, Appendix 1, this volume). Nuts
were also an important part of the diet as many charred fragments of crushed hickory nuts
were recovered as well.
The excavations at Rowland Clark uncovered evidence in the mortuary features for
the inclusion of animal remains as grave good associations. One such offering included the
bones of three small fish of the sunfish family with Burials 10 and 11. The bones of a gray

Journal of Northeast Texas Archaeology, No. 4 (1994)

squirrel were found in a ceramic bowl with Burial 38, while the bones of a songbird
(sparrow or finch) were recovered in a bowl in Burial 34. ·
Bird and animal bones have been reported in, and under, ceramic vessels at other
Red River Caddoan sites such as Bob Williams (Perino 1983) and Roden (Perino 1981).
At the Haley site in southwest Arkansas, bird bones found in vessels with Burials 24 and
26 included one scarlet tanager, one yellow-billed cookoo, five red-eyed vireo, and two
small birds of the Vireo species; the bones of a squirrel were found in a bowl in Burial 24
(Perino 1967).
SUMMARY

Our excavations at the Rowland Clark site were intended to document the habitation
and mortuary features of Caddoan late McCurtain phase groups who occupied the site, and
also to corroborate the archaeological information previously obtained from work at Roden
(Perino 1981) and Bob Williams (Perino 1983). This was accomplished in part, but of
equal significance was the discovery and excavation of a discrete early McCurtain phase
cemetery where bioarchaeological information was obtained on ca. A.D. 1300-1450
lifeways, but also containing interesting typologically and stylistically developmental
ceramic wares.
The early McCurtain phase cemetery contained 20 individuals in deep graves (and
one in a house floor). The late McCurtain phase burials (including those dating to the midlate seventeenth century) consist of 18 individuals laid out with their heads to the west or
west-northwest. Other contemporaneous McCurtain phase cemeteries had individuals
oriented with heads to the east; this change in mortuary orientation cannot be explained at
the present time, but perhaps it simply relates to strong local preferences. Most of the
features and house remains at Rowland Clark appear to date to the early McCurtain phase.
Their density in the excavation area clearly indicates intensive Caddoan use of the river
terrace at that time.
The accompanying ceramics in the two cemeteries hint at their origins from various
forms of Sanders phase pottery, but new types and vessel forms were developed as well.
Avery Engraved, Simms Engraved, Clark Engraved, Nash Neck-Banded, McKinney
Plain, and Emory Punctated-Incised types dominant the ceramics for about 350 years (ca.
A.D. 1300-1650), while new styles and forms of engraved and incised bowls and bottles
(Hudson Engraved, Hodges Engraved, Taylor Engraved, Keno Trailed) became popular
after ca. A.D. 1650. A form of red-slipped jar with a d.istinctive design element (left and
right curlicues and pendant engraved triangles filled with chevrons [see Figure 16f])
appears to also be part of the ca. A.D. 1650-1700 occupation of the Rowland Clark site, as
this identical form and design has been found in Burial 20, House 2 at the Bob Williams
site in association with an iron strike-a-lite (Perino 1983).4

Other cob fragments appear to be parts of the same measured cob. Charred plant
materials sent from this feature consisted mostly of wood charcoal and pine cones. A
similar smudge pit with pine cones has been examined by Fritz (1992) from 41RR236, a
few miles upstream from Rowland Clark.

Appendix 2
Rowland Clark and Dan Holdeman Site
Human Skeletal Remains

Carol J. Loveland

INTRODUCTION
The Rowland Clark site was occupied by Caddoan Indian groups from
approximately A.D. 1300-1600+. Twenty one of the 39 burials recovered during the
Museum of the Red River excavations were assigned to the earliest McCurtain phase
occupation (ca. A.D. 1300-1450); 14 burials were ascribed to a later McCurtain occupation
between ca. A.D. 1450 and 1600; four burials belonged to the final McCurtain occupation
(ca. A.D. 1600+) of the site. Since infants and children were buried under house floors
rather than in the cemetery area associated with each time period, their interment does not
necessarily follow the assigned time period. Due to poor preservation and small sample
sizes all burials were evaluated as a single Caddoan population.
The burials from the Dan Holdeman site were found in a mound and three cemetery
areas located on a terrace adjacent to the Red River. Skeletons of 26 individuals were
recovered. The remains of an additional 15 individuals could not be retrieved due to their
poor preservation. The acidity of the soil at the site contributed to considerable
disintegration of the bones, leaving all burials in fragmentary condition.
Three time periods are represented in the burials from the Dan Holdeman site.
Burials 22, 23, and 25 were associated with a Formative Caddoan occupation (that Perino
designated the Spiro Focus) dating about A.D. 1000. Interments corresponding with the
Middle Caddoan Sanders Focus, dated about A.D. 1200, include Burials 1-20 and 24. One
subadult, Burial21, dates to the latter portion of the McCurtain phase (ca. A.D. 1650). The
skeletal material that could not be retrieved represented individuals living during the
Formative and Middle Caddoan occupations.
Since much of the data on the osteoarcheology of the Clark and Holdeman sites has
been presented in Loveland (1987), specifically stature estimates, skeletal anomalies, and
caries rates, it is the purpose of this appendix to summarize other aspects of the skeletal
biology of the prehistoric inhabitants of the two sites. However, the poor condition of the
skeletons recovered from the sites precludes accurately assessing the biological condition
and adaptive efficiency of the people who lived at the site. However, the analyses presented
here, and in Loveland (1987), present data that provides a fairly complete picture of
Caddoan adaptive efficiency on the Red River in Northeast Texas.

SKELETAL INVENTORIES
The skeletal remains from the Rowland Clark and Dan Holdeman sites represent
Caddoan individuals who lived over a span of several hundred years. Ideally, those burials
associated with each site occupation should be treated as a separate sample; however, due
to the fragmentary nature of the remains and the small number of burials available for
study, the interments from each site were analyzed as single groups. Tables 1 and 2 present
a brief description of each burial from the two sites, including sex, age, skeletal elements
present, and skeletal anomalies noted. Sex designations in these tables include those

Journal of Northeast Texas Archaeology, No.4 (1994)

51

individuals classified as probable males or females. Hereafter, those burials will be
grouped with their respective sex.
Dentition
Dental pathologies occurred commonly in the Rowland Clark population; those
observed included caries, broken teeth associated with caries, and abscesses. Table 3
shows the distribution of these dental problems by tooth type and sex. The dentition of
several burials was excluded from this analysis since the teeth and alveolar bone were too
fragmentary and broken to permit determination of tooth side and position.
The males exhibited slightly more dental problems than the females: two more
caries, one more abscess, and 11 more teeth lost antemortem. This probably reflects their
greater longevity rather than any difference in the use or care of their teeth.
The dentition of six males and three females at Dan Holdeman was sufficiently
complete to determine the condition of the teeth based upon type, position, and side. Table
4 presents the distribution of caries, abscesses, and broken teeth among the 229 teeth
examined from these nine individuals. Caries were entirely limited to the posterior
dentition; however, it is possible that caries may have occurred in some of the missing
anterior teeth.
Cranial Measurements
Few of the Holdeman or Rowland Clark burials were complete enough to measure.
The measurements that were taken are provided in Tables 5 and 6 for comparison with
other Caddoan populations.
CONCLUSION
Despite the poor preservation of the Clark and Holdeman site burials, the
bioarcheological analyses of the skeletons contributes to a better understanding of the
prehistoric Caddo Indians and their adaptation to their environment (Loveland 1987). Many
questions about the skeletal biology of the Rowland Clark and Holdeman populations
remain unanswered because the small sample sizes and fragmentary nature of the remains
prohibits a comprehensive analysis. However, analysis of the available skeletal data can
contribute to our understanding of the Caddoan people.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
I wish to thank Gregory Perino for making it possible for me to study these skeletal
collections. Dr. John B. Gregg, School of Medicine, the University of South Dakota,
Sioux Falls, South Dakota, kindly consented to evaluate two of the skeletal lesions from
the Holdeman site. I extend my appreciation to him.
