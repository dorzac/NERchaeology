ABSTRACT
On February 6, 2019, personnel with Prewitt and Associates, Inc., conducted an intensive
archeological survey of parts of Southside Lions Park in southeast San Antonio, Texas. The
survey was done under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8756. Areas surveyed are those that will
be impacted by improvements done as a result of the city’s 2017 bond program and consist of (1)
about 750 linear feet of new trail from the Southside Lions Senior Center to the Hiawatha Street
trail loop, (2) locations where lighting will be installed along the existing Hiawatha Street trail,
(3) installation of a canopy over an existing basketball court, and (4) locations where additional
picnic units will be placed at an overlook area and a baseball field along Hiawatha Street.
No historic or prehistoric sites were identified, and Prewitt and Associates, Inc., recommends
that no additional archeological investigations are warranted prior to construction of these
improvements.
Since this survey did not recover any artifacts, this project does not require artifact
curation. Project records and photographs currently housed at the offices of Prewitt and
Associates, Inc., will be transferred to the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The
University of Texas at Austin.

INTRODUCTION
On February 6, 2019, personnel with Prewitt and Associates, Inc., conducted
an intensive archeological survey of parts of Southside Lions Park in southeast San
Antonio, Texas (Figure 1). The survey was done under Texas Antiquities Permit No.
8756. Areas surveyed are those that will be impacted by improvements done as a
result of the city’s 2017 bond program and consist of (1) about 750 linear feet of new
trail from the Southside Lions Senior Center to the Hiawatha Street trail loop, (2)
locations where lighting will be installed along the existing Hiawatha Street trail,
(3) installation of a canopy over an existing basketball court, and (4) locations where
additional picnic units will be placed at an overlook area and a baseball field along
Hiawatha Street (Figure 2). The horizontal area of potential effects for the project
is less than 0.2 acres. The vertical area of potential effects will be less than 1 ft in
most places. All work done during this survey complied with the requirements of the
Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resource Code of 1977, Title 9, Chapter
191, VTCS 6145-9) and the City of San Antonio’s Historic Preservation and Design
Section of the Unified Development Code (Article 6 35-360-634).
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is near the edge of the Balcones Escarpment in central
Bexar County along the boundary between the Blackland Prairie to the southeast
and the Edwards Plateau to the northwest (Arbingast et al. 1973:6; Griffith et
al. 2004; McMahan et al. 1984:Figure 1). This portion of the Blackland Prairie is
characterized by rolling to nearly level tall-grass plains underlain by soft interbedded
marls, chalks, limestones, and shales. The scarp along the edge of the Edwards
Plateau is a rugged dissected landscape of limestone hills and canyons created by
extensive stream downcutting and headward erosion. According to the Geologic
Atlas of Texas (Bureau of Economic Geology 1983), the project area is mapped as
Pleistocene fluviatile terrace deposits; no Holocene alluvium is mapped in or near
the project area, although Quaternary low terrace deposits are mapped along Salado
Creek to the east. Soils are mapped as Branyon clay and Heiden-Ferris complex,
severely eroded (USDA, NRCS 2019). The former occurs on terraces and consists of
calcareous clayey alluvium derived from Pleistocene mudstone. The latter occurs in
uplands and consists of eroded clayey soils developed in Cretaceous shale and marl.
Vegetation within the unimproved parts of the survey area consists of a secondgrowth mesquite and ligustrum canopy with dense undergrowth of huisache and
other woody shrubs, grasses, and occasional prickly pear cacti.
RESULTS OF FILE SEARCH
A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Archeological Sites Atlas
in January 2019 revealed four previous archeological investigations and three
documented archeological sites within 1 km of the project area. One of the previous
investigations consisted of survey in 2014 of the Hiawatha Street trail and overlook
area immediately south of the proposed trail surveyed during the current project;
no sites were found (Norment and Kibler 2014a). The second investigation consisted
of survey in 2014 of the proposed Southside Senior Center immediately north of the

current project area; that survey identified one site, 41BX2037 (Norment and Kibler
2014b). The third investigation consisted of survey in 2009 of the proposed Hiawatha
Street basketball court (the one now proposed for the addition of a canopy), along
with proposed trails and roadways around Pecan Valley Lake to the east; that survey
identified one site, 41BX1857 (McWilliams and Kibler 2010). The fourth previous
investigation consisted of survey in 2007 for proposed trail development along Salado
Creek east of the current project area; that survey identified one site, 41BX1756
(Kemp and Moses 2008). The three known sites are 41BX1756 ca. 1.0 km east of
the current project area, 41BX1857 ca. 0.4 km east of it, and 41BX2037 ca. 0.1 km
west of it. Site 41BX1756 has historic and prehistoric components, with the former
apparently being remnants of a twentieth-century farmstead and the latter being
a lithic scatter. Site 41BX1857 is an outcrop of Uvalde gravels containing scattered
flakes, cores, and burned rocks; it represents a lithic resource procurement area. Site
41BX2037 is a sparse scatter of flakes and cores at an outcrop of Uvalde gravels;
it also represents a lithic resource procurement area. Based on these known sites,
the current project area can be considered to have a high probability of containing
prehistoric archeological materials relating to lithic procurement.
In addition to review of the Archeological Sites Atlas, the potential for historic
archeological sites was assessed using maps obtained from the Texas Department
of Transportation’s Texas Historic Overlay and historic aerial photographs. None
of these sources (1936 and 1959 county highway maps; 1903 and 1953 USGS
topographic maps; 1911 soils map; 1927 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers map; and
1953, 1963, and 1973 aerial photographs) depict improvements within the immediate
project area. Hence, the area appears to have a low probability of containing historic
archeological sites.
METHODS OF FIELD INVESTIGATION
The archeological survey consisted of 100 percent pedestrian coverage of
the proposed trail and other areas to be impacted by a single project archeologist.
The survey conformed to and exceeded the Texas Historical Commission’s survey
standards. For the 750 ft of proposed new trail, the archeologist walked two transects
spaced less than 30 m apart along the flagged center line, and all surface exposures
along those transects were examined for evidence of prehistoric and historic
artifacts and features. Nine shovel tests were dug along these transects because
ground surface visibility was poor (30 percent or less). All shovel tests were 30 cm
in diameter and excavated in 10-cm levels. The clayey and wet sediments removed
from the tests were carefully sorted with a trowel, since they could not be screened.
Shovel testing was not necessary in the other areas surveyed, since ground
surface exposure around them was good (more than 50 percent). In addition, some of
these areas, such as the Hiawatha Street trail, overlook area, and basketball court,
had already been surveyed with negative results. Nevertheless, each area was again
carefully inspected. In addition, photographs were taken of survey conditions at
each area, and a photograph log and daily journal of project activities, discoveries,
and observations was kept by the project archeologist.

SURVEY RESULTS
The survey encountered no prehistoric or historic sites that will be impacted
by the currently proposed improvements. The 750 linear feet of new trail will
cross the western side slope of a northeastward-projecting interfluve between
Southside Lions Senior Center and the existing Hiawatha Street trail. Elevation
of the proposed trail ranges from 630 ft above mean sea level on the northeast end
by the Senior Center to 680 ft on the southwest end at its intersection with the
existing trail. Approximately 240 ft of the northeast end of the new trail has been
disturbed by construction of the Senior Center, the Center’s parking lot, a gravel
berm surrounding the parking lot, and an existing dog park (Figure 3a). Although
vegetation in this area consists of grass, there are large open patches where ground
surface visibility is over 50 percent. These open areas were scrutinized, but no
artifacts were found.
Most of the new trail is in dense vegetation consisting of second-growth
mesquite and ligustrum trees, woody shrubs, and grasses. Leaf litter obscures the
ground surface such that surface visibility was less than 30 percent. Still, siliceous
gravels and a few exposures of sandstone bedrock were noted on the surface along
the northern half of the 510 ft of forested trail. Nine shovel tests were excavated
along the forested trail to compensate for the lack of surface exposures (Figure 3b).
The shovel tests encountered 20–30 cm of dark gray clay loam above stiff dark gray
clay. Siliceous and calcareous gravels, ranging from fist- to walnut-sized pieces, were
noted at 0–20 cm below the surface apparently stopping at the contact with the dark
gray clay in some tests. Shovel Test 2 produced two primary decortification flakes
in the upper 20 cm. No other artifacts were found in Shovel Tests 3–5 and 9 nearby,
although one possible tested cobble was noted on the surface in the area of Shovel
Test 5. These flakes and tested cobble could be the remains of prehistoric people
passing though the area and evaluating its lithic resources. Given the presence of
nearby sites 41BX1857 and 41BX2037 with more-abundant remains, they apparently
found better resources elsewhere. It also is possible that these items could have
resulted from historic activities such as land clearing.
No shovel testing was done in the other areas surveyed, since ground
surface exposure around them was good. Still, each was carefully inspected.
Trail lighting is proposed along the existing Hiawatha Street trail. Twenty-three
light poles spaced approximately 100 ft apart will be constructed adjacent to this
2,600-ft-long concrete trail (Figure 4a). The Hiawatha Street trail, the nearby
overlook area where new picnic units will be added, and the Hiawatha Street
basketball court where a canopy will be added had been previously surveyed
with no sites found (McWillliams and Kibler 2010; Norment and Kibler 2014b).
Reexamination of these areas did not change those results. The last improvement
area surveyed was the location of picnic units at the Hiawatha Street baseball
field. The ground surface in this area appears to have been sculpted and disturbed
during construction of the adjacent baseball field, parking lot, sidewalks, and
concession stand (Figure 4b). Scrutiny of good surface exposures did not reveal
any evidence of archeological sites.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No prehistoric or historic archeological sites were discovered during this
survey. A few possible prehistoric artifacts were encountered along the proposed
new trail. These few artifacts, two primary decortification flakes and one possible
tested cobble, likely represent prehistoric people passing though the area and
evaluating the stony outcrops as a potential lithic resource. Given the presence of
nearby sites 41BX1857 and 41BX2037 where artifacts are more abundant, better
resources were present elsewhere, although neither of these sites was considered
eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places or designation as a State
Antiquities Landmark. The few artifacts found during this survey are too sparse
to warrant designation as a site. Hence, Prewitt and Associates, Inc., recommends
that no additional archeological investigations are warranted prior to construction
of the proposed park facilities.
