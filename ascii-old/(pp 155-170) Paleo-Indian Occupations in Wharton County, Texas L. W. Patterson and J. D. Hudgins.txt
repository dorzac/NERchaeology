Paleo-Indian Occupations in Wharton County, Texas
L. W. Patterson and J. D. Hudgins

ABSTRACT
Several sites have been recorded in Wharton County, Texas with evidence of PaleoIndian occupations. Much of the data is in the form of surface collections. However, excavations at site 41WH19 have demonstrated a well-stratified site with an occupation sequence from the Paleo-Indian period through the Late Prehistoric. Ongoing research by
members of the Houston Archeological Society is contributing to a more detailed picture
of early occupation sequences and technologies in southeastern Texas.

INTRODUCTION

This paper discusses evidence for Paleo-Indian occupations in Wharton
County. This has become an important geographic area for Paleo-Indian research
by the Houston Archeological Society. A number of surface collections from this
area contain Paleo-Indian components and the first site in southeastern Texas
with well-stratified Paleo-Indian occupations has been found here.
The Paleo-Indian period is of great interest in archeology, especially in relation to origins and early adaptations of early man in the New World. This time
period is generally recognized as being a span of approximately 4,000 years in
Texas (Story 1981:142), from 10,000 to 6,000 B.C. It is viewed here as a
chronological period rather than a term given to a specific prehistoric lifestyle.
There appear to be regional differences in lifestyles throughout North America
during this time period, perhaps due to adaptations to local resources. Data on
this prehistoric period in southeastern Texas has been slow to accumulate (Hester
1980). However, in recent years a significant amount of new data (Patterson
1983) has become available on Paleo-Indian occupations in this region, mainly
due to the efforts of serious amateur archeologists. The extent of the data base
for each local area of this region seems to be directly proportional to the amount
of survey work done. Harris County has the largest number (14) of reported sites
in this region with Paleo-Indian components due to the large amount of survey
work completed there.
Only one radiocarbon date is available for Paleo-indian occupations in
southeastern Texas. Most Paleo-Indian manifestations here have been identified
by projectile point types. These include Clovis, Plainview, Dalton, San Patrice,

Scottsbluff, Early Stemmed (Turner and Hester 1985 : 87), and Angostura types.
Recent excavations at site 41WH19 in Wharton County have yielded Folsom,
Plainview, San Patrice and Angostura-tike points and some new types of notched
and stemmed points from the Paleo-Indian period.

THE SETTING IN WHARTON COUNTY
Wharton County is located in a relatively flat section of the inland coastal
plain (Figure 1), and contains a mixture of woodlands and prairie grasslands.
This county is bisected by the Colorado River drainage system, and has other
stream systems such as the West Bernard River. A large variety of natural floral
and faunal resources occur here that could have provided a subsistence base for
prehistoric foragers. The Holocene period geology here consists mainly of redeposited Pleistocene sands and clays overlying the Pleistocene age Beaumont
formation. Indian occupations here span the Paleo-Indian to the Historic period
with sites found mostly on high points along stream banks.

SURFACE COLLECTIONS

Most survey work in Wharton County has been done east of the Colorado
River. Surface collections from several sites in this area have revealed PaleoIndian projectile points, usually together with point types covering a much longer
time period. It is important to note that most finds of Paleo-indian points in this
area are not isolated finds, but come from surface collections of deflated sites
that usually have evidence of very long occupation sequences, from the PaleoIndian through the Late Prehistoric time periods.
Site 41WH2 (Patterson and Hudgins 1980a) has a collection with Plainview
and San Patrice points. Two points from this site previously identified as Williams and Darl have recently been reclassified as Paleo-Indian side-notched types
similar to ones excavated at site 41WH19. (Patterson and Hudgins 1980a: Figures 2,G and 4,G) It is common for early notched points to have ground basal
edges.
Two Plainview points have been found at site 41WH7 (Patterson and
Hudgins 1980a). Two Plainview points and one San Patrice point were found on
site 41WH26 (Patterson and Hudgins 1982). A Scottsbluff point was found on
site 41WH69 (J. D. Hudgin’s field notes).
Several Paleo-Indian points have been found on the surface of site 41WIll0
(Patterson and Hudgins 1980b, 1984a, 1985b). These specimens include Plainview, San Patrice, Early Stemmed (Turner and Hester 1985 : 87) and miscellaneous lanceolate types. Site 41WH10 is a stratified site but test excavations to date
have not located any Paleo-Indian points in situ.
A large surface collection has been obtained from site 41WH19 location
"A" (Patterson and Hudgins 1981, 1983a, 1984b, 1985a; Hudgins and Patterson
1983). Paleo-Indian points in this collection include Plainview, Scottsbluff, San
Patrice, Early Side Notched, Early Corner Notched, Meserve, and several forms
of early straight-stemmed points. The Early Side Notched, Early Corner Notched
and early straight-stemmed points are of the same types as described here from
excavations at Location "B" of this site.
A total of six sites in Wharton County has now been reported with surface
collections containing Paleo-lndian projectile points, mainly from the Late
Paleo-Indian period of about 8,000 to 6,000 B.C. With the exception of site
41WH69, all of these sites have yielded data indicating very long occupation
sequences, similar to a number of sites found about 50 miles east in Harris
County (Patterson 1983). Also, Wharton County (Patterson and Hudgins 1983b)
and Harris County (Patterson 1980) each have one excavated site with Paleoindian points found in situ.
An important point should be made here regarding surface collections,
which represent significant archeological data that some investigators tend to ignore. Only when data from both surface collections and excavations are used can
the maximum interpretive potential be realized. Syntheses derived without use of

SITE 41WH19 LOCATION "B"
Site 41WH19 Location "A" is a large eroded area on a steep river bank.
Details on the location of this site have been recorded in the files of the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin. This area was thoroughly tested
without finding any remaining intact cultural deposits. In the fall of 1982, tests
were made downstream on a less eroded section of this river bank and intact cultural deposits were found. This was designated as site 41WH19 Location "B". A
six-month excavation season was completed by the Houston Archeological Society in May 1983 and a preliminary summary has been published (Patterson and
Hudgins 1983b). A second six-month excavation season was completed in May
1984. A detailed final report of this work is now being prepared. This project has
required many hundreds of hours of labor. It is a good example of the type of
contribution that can be made by serious amateur archeologists.
Site 41WH19 is the first site found in southeastern Texas with well-stratified

Paleo-Indian components. This site has an occupation sequence for the Early
Paleo-Indian period through the Late Prehistoric. Stratified cultural deposits here
have a total depth of 2.5 meters. The depth of stratified Paleo-Indian components
appears to be slightly over 80 cm.
Stratum 1B is the top level of excavation, totally in the Late Prehistoric period. It consists of 35 to 40 cm of a uniform brown silty sand that is immediately
above the uppermost "A" horizon buried paleosol that was encountered. Arrow
points and ceramics were found in this stratum that are typical of the Late Prehistoric in this region. Stratum 1B, below 1A, consists of 35 to 40 cm of silty
sand that includes three separate buried paleosols. The depth of this stratum was
originally selected to include all visible "A" horizons, but later another "A" horizon was found in the top of Stratum 2. Stratum 1A is the transition between the
Late Prehistoric and the Early Ceramic periods, with arrow points found only
in the top half, but ceramics found throughout this stratum. A summary of
projectile points from Strata 1A, B is given in Table 1.
Stratum 2, below 1A, consists of 80 to 100 cm of alternate light and dark
brown layers. Variations in depths of the individual strata for various test pits are
due to the fact that excavations were made according to natural stratigraphic levels, according to soil types. The top 20 cm of Stratum 2 represents the earliest
portion of the Early Ceramic period. Below this level, Stratum 2 appears to be
entirely in the preceramic Archaic period. A summary of projectile points from
Stratum 2 is given in Table 2.
The bottom of stratum 2 appears to be the transitional point between the
Late Paleo-lndian and Early Archaic periods, at a depth of about 1.7 meters. An
Angostura-like point was found at this level. Based on estimates by other investigators (Prewitt 1981 :Figure 3), Angostura and Angostura-like points occur in
the period of 6,000 to 5,000 B.C.
Below stratum 2, in stratum 3, an abrupt soil change occurs, going from a
clay-sand matrix to a completely sandy matrix with a depth of approximately 40
centimeters. Stratum 3 appears to represent the Late Paleo-lndian period. A surprising variety of side-notched and corner-notched points were found at this level
(Figures 2, 3), all with ground basal edges. Except for San Patrice (Figure 3
upper left), these point styles were not previously known as being from the Late
Paleo-lndian period in southeastern Texas. Some of these point types probably
would be identified as Late Archaic types if found in surface collections. Some
of these point types also occur at Location "A". In the Early Archaic period,
notched points were displaced by straight stem point forms. Following the identification of these new kinds of notched points, more surface collections having
Late Paleo-Indian components may now be classified in this region. Stratum 3 is
judged as representing the Late Paleo-Indian period because it is bracketed by a
Plainview point below and an Angostura-like point above, as well as having a
San Patrice point in this stratum. A summary of projectile points from Stratum 3
is given in Table 3.
Below stratum 3, there is again a marked soil change in stratum 4 with a

depth of about 40 centimeters overlying sterile Beaumont clay. A Plainview
point, reworked as a scraper, and two side-notched points (Figure 4 lower right)
were found just below the top of stratum 4. This level probably represents the
earliest Late Paleo-Indian component at approximately 8,000 B.C. (Johnson and
Holliday 1980:Table 3). Below this, at depths of 10 to 15 cm in stratum 4, other
side-notched and unclassified points were found (Figure 4 upper row and lower
left). At a depth of 20 cm, a Folsom point was found (Figure 5 second from left).
This point is a manufacturing failure, apparently broken during removal of the
second flute. Since this Folsom point is a manufacturing failure, it is not likely to
be an item that was curated by later Indians. This split point type of manufacturing failure is common for Folsom points (Wilmsen and Roberts 1984:Figure
102). Because of the presence of a Folsom point, the lower portion of stratum 4
is judged to be in the earlier portion of the Paleo-Indian period that is usually
represented by fluted points. This is now supported by a radiocarbon date of
9920+530 B.R (AA-298) from a small piece of charcoal found during screening
of soil from the lower half of Stratum 4. More radiocarbon dates from several
excavation levels of this site are now being run. Many more small charcoal
samples are available that could be dated by the atomic accelerator method if
funds were available.

Surprisingly, a large side-notched point (Figure 5 left) was found at a depth
of 25 cm in stratum 4, somewhat below the Folsom point. The presence of a sidenotched point this early may be very significant. This may explain why Folsom
points have not been found previously on the upper Texas coast, because other
point types were perhaps being made here, instead of Folsom, during this time
period. A summary of projectile points from Stratum 4 is given in Table 4.
Some general comments on the lithic technology of this site can be made.
The full range of typical Paleo-Indian lithic technology is not present here, as can
be found elsewhere in Texas (Patterson 1977, 1981). Other than projectile point
types, only large scrapers and a few combination scraper/gravers are similar to
typical Plains-type Paleo-Indian tool kits. The absence of an industry for the
manufacture of large prismatic blades should especially be noted. This may be
explained by adaptation to use of local chert raw materials that are generally in
the form of small cobbles that are not suitable for the manufacture of large
blades. Paleo-Indian unifacial tool types seem to be discontinued altogether
above stratum 3 in the Early Archaic. The simple utilized flake dominates the
tool kit of the Archaic period, apparently casually taken from bifacial thinning
debitage.
Preservation of faunal remains in the lower levels of site 41WH19, Location
"B", is not good but some remains of deer and turtle have been identified. There
is no data from this site to associate Paleo-Indians with the hunting of extinct
megafauna, except for an unplaced elephant bone from Location "A". Based on
limited data for faunal remains (McClure 1983), the Paleo-Indian subsistence
pattern here does not appear to differ from that of the later Archaic period. Fired
clay balls found here may be associated with cooking functions (Patterson 1976:
183). This is the first site in southeastern Texas where fired clay balls have been
well identified at Paleo-Indian as well as Archaic levels. The use of fired clay
balls would appear to be a very long technological tradition.

EXTERNAL RELATIONSHIPS
Wharton County, Texas appears to be in a geographic zone that may be an
interface between Plains and eastern Paleo-Indian projectile-point traditions. At
site 41WH19 and other sites in this county, the Plains tradition is represented by
Folsom, Plainview, Scottsbluff, and Angostura-like points. The eastern tradition
is represented by San Patrice, Big Sandy, and a variety of other side-notched and
corner-notched points, all with ground basal edges. There seems to be a very
early and widespread eastern notched-point tradition. For example, some of the
side-notched points from site 41WH 19 are similar to points found with San Patrice at a site in Louisiana (Webb, et al. !971). Early notched points can be
found throughout the southeastern U.S. (Goodyear 1982; Coe t964; Gardner
1974) and on the eastern side of the Great Plains (Agogino and Frankforter

years ago.
It would appear that the development of a wide variety of projectile point
styles may have been well underway during the Paleo-Indian time period, instead
of starting in the Archaic period, as is so often cited. Some differences in
projectile-point styles may be explained as adaptations to different regional environments. It should be noted, however, that technological innovation is not always related to environmental adaptations, as technological change can occur for
a variety of reasons. The very early stemmed points at Site 41WH19 do seem to
be related to a broad-based Archaic hunting and gathering lifestyle. This fits well
with Shafer’s (1977 : 187) hypothesis "that the early lithic adaptations of the area
between the southern High Plains and the eastern woodlands was one of hunting
and gathering and not which could be described as big game hunting." This
should not be surprising. As Johnson (1977:65) notes, Paleo-Indians probably
always did operate from a broad economic base. Also, it should be noted that
hunting and gathering peoples must adapt readily to local resources in a new occupation area or perish.
A major question is how early did this nonfluted-point technological pattern begin in southeast Texas? Does this represent a technologica! tradition
completely parallel to the fluted-point tradition, or is it a development from
the Clovis early fluted-point tradition? Bryan (1977) notes the possibility of
other projectile point traditions parallel to the fluted-point tradition. Very early
stemmed points have been found in both western (Bryan 1980) and eastern
(Fowler 1971; Peck and Painter 1984) portions of the United States.
Shafer (1977:Figure 3) has described an Early Lithic technological tradition without fluted points that is found throughout eastern Texas. This fits well
into the concept of an eastern Paleo-Indian tradition that is distinct from the
Plains Paleo-Indian tradition. The Obshner site (Crook and Harris 1955) near
Dallas is a good example of this Early Lithic tradition in eastern Texas, where
side-notched points were found together with Scottsbluff Paleo-Indian points.
Severa! side-notched points from the Obshner Site are similar to Late PaleoIndian specimens from site 41WH19.
Some of the early-notched points found in the central Mississippi Valley
from a time period of 9,500 to 9,000 B.P. (Morse and Morse 1983 :Figure 5.2)
are similar to Late Paleo-Indian period points from site 41WH19. Morse and
Morse (1983:71) place Dalton points earlier, however. They also seem to imply
that the Dalton point may be a technological evolution from the Clovis point
(Morse and Morse 1983 : 72). Not all of the early-notched points in this region are
well dated. Unless the central Misssissippi Valley has a unique technological tradition, future research may find that some of the early-notched point types are as
early as Dalton. In any event, the central Mississippi Valley is another example of
the early start of an Archaic hunting and gathering lifeway (Morse and Morse
1983 : 71).
Aside from site 41WH19, there are now several sites in Texas with side-

Patterson and Hudgins--Wharton County

167

notched points earlier than Plainview. Watt (1978 :Figure 7) has shown a San
Patrice-like point earlier than Plainview in the central Brazos River Valley. The
Wilson-Leonard site (Weir 1985), north of Austin, has a number of side-notched
points earlier than Plainview (Frank Weir, personal communication). The Rex
Rodgers site in the Texas Panhandle (Hughes and Willey 1978 :Figure 12) has
San Patrice-like points at least as old as Plainview, similar to Watt’s specimen
from central Texas. It should also be noted that there are some sites in Harris
County, such as 41HR206 (Patterson 1976:Figure 1A, B, C), that have earlynotched point types similar to those from site 4 l WH 19 in Wharton County.
The presence of side-notched and straight and contracting-stem points as
early or earlier than a Folsom fluted point gives more credence to the findings of
Sellards (1940: 1641) from a site in Bee County that is 100 miles west of site
41WH19. The side-notched point found by Sellards (1940:Plate 1-6) is very
similar to the specimen from 41WH19 (Figure 5 left) that was found in a similar
stratigraphic position. This type of point is well made and has an expanding stem
with concave lateral edges. The straight and contracting stem point specimens
from site 41WH19 and from the Bee County site are all fragments. It should also
be noted that the coastal plain of southeast Texas is probably a poor place to
search for pre-Ctovis remains. It seems to be common for sites in this region to
have Paleo-Indian remains of 11,000 years age or less directly overlying the
Beaumont formation. Since the Beaumont formation has an estimated minimum
age of at least 30,000 years (Aten 1983: 108), there seems to be a gap in the
geological stratigraphy of this region of roughly 20,000 years. This may represent a severe erosional episode at the end of the Pleistocene period.

SUMMARY

It has now become apparent that there are a significant number of sites in
southeastern Texas with very long occupation sequences, indicating a longtime
stable settlement pattern for the inland portion of the coastal plain (Patterson
1983). Excavations at site 41WH19 (Patterson and Hudgins 1983b), site 41HR315
(Patterson 1980), and site 41HR5 (Wheat 1953) have given details on this subject. Numerous surface surveys have also aided in establishing this widespread
regional pattern. The long period of over 10,000 years for a foraging lifestyle in
southeastern Texas might be compared to a similar longtime pattern for the Desert Culture of the eastern Great Basin (Jennings 1974: 154-182).
Until recently, most of the data on the prehistory of southeastern Texas related to the Late Archaic and later time periods after 2,000 B.C. The earlier
Paleo-indian, Early Archaic, and Middle Archaic periods are now better known.
Ongoing research by members of the Houston Archeological Society is continuing to contribute to a more detailed picture of the early time periods in southeastern Texas.
