ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of two linear miles of proposed new county road
construction in central Scurry County was conducted by Brazos Valley Research
Associates (BVRA) on April 2, 2015 under Antiquities Permit 7235. This project
was carried out for Scurry County. William E. Moore was the Principal Investigator
and Jesse Todd was the Project Archaeologist. David Todd, P.E. at who works at
Enprotec/Hibbs & Todd, Inc. was the Project Manager. No sites were found, and it
is recommended that the client be allowed to proceed with construction as planned.
No cemeteries or standing structures were observed near the Area of Potential
Effect (APE). Copies of the final report are on file at the Texas Historical
Commission (THC), Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), the Texas
State Library, Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), BVRA,
Enprotec/Hibbs & Todd, Inc., and various libraries and other repositories. The
reviewer for this project was Tiffany Osburn, Regional Archeologist and Project
Reviewer for the Texas Historical Commission.

INTRODUCTION
Scurry County plans to construct a new county road that will connect State
Highway 350 with Block Line Road, two miles to the west in central Scurry County
(Figure 1). When completed, the road will be known as Cavender Road. Later, a
county road number will be assigned. The road is described by the Project
Manager as having a 2-course asphalt surface treatment without curb and gutter
(typical construction for county roads in Texas). The road surface will be 24 feet
wide with a shoulder and drainage ditch on each side. The road easement is 100
feet and the extent of subsurface disturbance due to construction will be 2 feet.
The entire area of potential effect (APE) is on private property, but the county will
assume ownership at a later date. The footprint of the proposed road crosses
varying types of terrain that varies in elevation from 2350 feet above mean sea
level (amsl) to 2400 feet amsl. Much of the land is flat but it is broken up in places
by draws and occasional hills. There are no stream crossings. The nearest major
stream is Canyon Creek that flows in a north/south drection and is approximately
150 meters to the west of Block Line Road. Figure 2 depicts the project area on the
USGS 7.5â topographic quadrangle Snyder (3200-323).

ENVIRONMENT
Scurry County is located in the Texas plains below the caprock in an area
known for ranching, agriculture (cotton, hay, and wheat) and oil and gas
production. It is approximately equidistant between Lubbock to the north and
San Angelo to the south. The county is sparsely populated with only 16,921
residents reported by the United States Census for 2010. Snyder is the county
seat, and the majority of the population resides there. The remainder live in the
small towns such as Camp Springs, China Grove, Dunn, Fluvanna, Hermleigh,
Inadale, Ira, Knapp, and Union. The size of the county (land and water) is
907.53 square miles. Elevations range from 2000 feet to 2822 feet above mean
sea level. Annual rainfall averages 22.2 inches. The January mean minimum
temperature is 25 degrees Fahrenheit while the July mean maximum is 93
degrees Fahrenheit. The above information was taken from the Texas Almanac
(Dallas Morning News 2004-2005).
This county is located in the Kansan Biotic Province of Texas and
Oklahoma as defined by W. Frank Blair (1950:109-112). Environmental areas
are often defined differently by various researchers. According to Blair
(1950:109), the limits of the Kansan Province differ considerably from those
posited by L. R. Dice (1943). Blair (1950:110) mentions three well marked biotic
districts that make up this province. These districts are also described by Blair
and Hubble (1938). They are the Mixed Grass Plains district that occupies a
large strip in the western part of Oklahoma and extends into the eastern part of
the Texas Panhandle, the Mesquite Plains district that occupies a small corner of
southwestern Oklahoma and the exposed Permian of northwest Texas, and the
Short Grass Plains district that is a continuation of the Llano Estacado or High
Plains. The Kansan province meets the Balconian province at the edge of the
Edwards Plateau, and it extends westward to the Pecos River valley in New
Mexico and northward through the Oklahoma Panhandle and southwestern
Kansas. Moisture is deficient throughout the Kansan biotic province and the
amounts of available moisture decreases from east to west. Charles Warren
Thornthwaite was an American geographer and climatologist who is best known
for devising a climate classification system in 1948 that is still used worldwide. In
1948, he (Thornthwaite 1948) published An Approach Toward a Rational
Classification of Climate, one of his better known works. In this article, he
classifies the eastern part of the Kansan province as dry subhumid and most of
the Short Grass Plains district as semiarid. A detailed list of the major plant
associations and species of characteristic mammalian fauna can be found in
Blair (1950:10-12).

The following information was taken from the soil survey for Scurry County
(Dixon et al. 1973). According to the General Soils Map, the proposed road
passes through two soil associations. They are Rowena-Abilene-Olton (nearly
level to gently sloping upland loams) and Mansker-Potter (nearly level to steep
upland loams). This survey began at the eastern end of the APE where the
proposed road will connect with State Highway 350 and proceed to the west until
it will end at Block Line Road.
According to sheet 31, the first soil encountered is the Mansker loam, 1 to
3% slopes (MkB). This is also the dominant soil in the area investigated. In this
soil the B horizon consists of clay loam and begins at seven inches below the
eroded and deflated A horizon (Dixon et al. 1973:13). The next soil is described
in the soil survey (Dixon et al. 1973:15) as Olton clay loam, 0-1% slopes (OcB).
The B horizon also consists of clay loam and begins at seven inches below the
eroded and deflated A horizon. The remainder of the project area is depicted on
Sheet 30. On this sheet, the OcB soils continued to be depicted and the next soil
is the Mansker-Potter complex (Mp). This soil type consists of loam overlying
clayey loams at seven inches below the ground surface. In the project area, the
only places where Mp soils are found are on a high hill that affords views over
much of the county. After leaving this soil, the APE is again passing through
MkB soils. The next specific soil type is Potter (Pt), and this is a soil that consists
of loam overlying the C horizon that consists of caliche at six inches below the
ground surface. (Dixon et al. 1973:16). The final soil that is encountered before
the termination point of the road is the Vernon -Potter complex that consists of
clay overlying clay. The B horizon is found at six inches below the ground surface
(Dixon et al. 1973: 23 for the Vernon description). The OcB and MkB soils are
derived from the late pleiocene and early pleistocene outwash soils. According
to the soil survey by Templin and Reitch (1931:9), the soils in the APE are âheavy
and shallow.â Additional information about the geology of the area can be found
in The Geology of Texas (Sellards et al. 1990) and the Geologic Atlas of Texas
(Barnes 1974).
The county is drained by the Colorado River that passes through its
southwestern corner and various tributaries of the Colorado and Brazos rivers.
The nearest dependable stream to the APE is Canyon Creek located
approxiately 150 meters to the west of Block Line Road. There are several
gullies in or near the APE that contain water but only after heavy rains. No
natural springs are known to exist in this area.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Few professional surveys have been conducted in the immediate area of
tlhe current APE. At this time, only four surveys and two recorded sites are
depicted on the Snyder topographic quadrangle. The surveys were conducted by
PBS&J (1998) for a transmission line, American Archeology Group (Bradle et al.
2004) for a park, Daniel E. Fox (1988) for a pipeline, and an area survey conducted
for the United States Air Force (no information available).
The nearest documented site to the APE is 41SC16, located about 4.18
kilometers to the northeast. This site was recorded in 1998 by David Sherman of
PBSJ for the Snyder Cooperative Gin Company who was planning to construct a
transmission line. He describes it on the site form as a historic site (artifact scatter).
In 1999, archaeologists from PBS&J returned to the site and dug 88 shovel tests.
Types of artifacts collected include various colors of bottle glass fragments, flat
glass, brick fragments, stoneware, and cut nails. These artifacts are curated at
TARL. The only report found for this project was authored by David Sherman and
Steve Hoyt (1998).
The second recorded site is a tiny jail (aka calaboose) that was recorded
by William E. Moore in 2013 as part of his personal project dedicated to
document as many calabooses in Texas as possible (Figure 3). Additional
information about this jail project can be found at www.tinytexasjails.com. This site
(41SC65) is a small wooden calaboose that was acquired by the local historical
society and moved from its original location in Hermleigh to Snyder where it
could be preserved. This historic structure was recorded as a Texas Historic
Landmark (marker number 1946) in 1972. This is the most recent site to be
recorded in Scurry County.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Archaic and Late Prehistoric sites in Scurry County include lithic scatters,
quarry sites, temporary and permanent campsites, burned rock mounds and
middens, occasional panels of rock art, and some reported burials. Although
these sites can be found virtually anywhere in the county, the more significant
sites have been documented along the Colorado River and its major tributaries.
Burned rock middens are one of the most common sites in Central and West
Central Texas. Discussions of this site type can be found in the writings by
Darrell B. Creel (1986), Thomas R. Hester (1991), and James E. Pearce (1938).
Creel (1977) also published a report on aboriginal subsistence and settlement of
West Central Texas.
Lynne A. Biesaart, Wayne R. Roberson, and Lisa Clinton Spotts (1985)
compiled a statistical overview of prehistoric archeological sites in Texas. I use
this sometimes in order to make comparisons between previous work and the
present. According to Biesaart et al. (1985), Scurry County is located in the
Lower Plains Region. In 1985, they state that there were only two recorded sites
in the county (site numbers are not given). At the time, these two sites
represented only .15% of the region and .01% of the state. One site is described
as a burned rock midden dating to the âGeneral Archaicâ and there is no
information for the other one. Both sites had been disturbed by erosion.
Historic Period
Scurry County was created in 1876 and organized in 1884 (Moore 1975).
It was named for Wiliam Read Scurry who was a lawyer and general in the
Confederate army. The railroad did not arrive in the county until about 1909 and
this late arrival hindered development and commerce. The first railroad was the
Roscoe, Snyder and Pacific Railway and its arrival helped boost the population of
Snyder to 2154 in 1910. Snyder is the county seat that began due to the efforts
of William Henry (Pete) Snyder who opened a trading camp in 1877 and laid out
the town in 1882. Two years later it became the official county seat. New towns,
such as Fulvanna and Hermleigh, were created because of the railroad.
Ranching and farming were the major enterprises in the county until 1948 when
oil was discovered in the Canyon Reef just north of town. Snyder instantly
became a boomtown and the population reached 12,000 in one year. The boom
ended in 1951, but oil still remained a major part of the economy. Later, an
industrial base was established and Western Texas College was opened in 1971.
Histories of Scurry County include works by Cotton (1957) and Shelton (1973).
An excellent source for Texas history was written by Daniel E. Fox (1983).

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, the Archeological Site Atlas (hereafter referred
to as the Atlas) was checked for previously recorded sites and past surveys.
Archaeological reports were reviewed during the planning stages of this project in
order to become familiar with the types of sites in the area and where they are
likely to be found. The Principal Investigator talked with several local ranchers
who willingly shared their knowledge of past use of the area during historic times
and what to expect on the ground in terms of soils and vegetation.
The survey was conducted on April 2, 2015. The crew consisted of the
Project Archeologist, Larry Thompson, and Tommy Johnson. They began at
State Highway 350 in a mesquite forest. Within 150 meters, grassland was
present. Mesquite forested areas alternated with grassland and areas of
mesquite and grassland in the APE. The crew estimated that approximately twothirds of the proposed route was grassland, while the remainder of the area was
in a mesquite forest.
The field methods consisted of a 100% Pedestrian Survey and testing with
shovels. Thirty-two tests were dug at intervals of 100 meters. The soil from each
test was screened using Â¼ inch hardware cloth, and the soil color was described
using the Munsell Color Chart. Shovel test data were recorded on a log that
appears as Appendix I to this report. The location of each test was plotted on a
field map and their relative position is depicted in Figure 2. In addition, GPS
coordinates were taken at each test. The project area was documented through
digital photography intended to illustrate the various field conditions as they
existed at the time of this survey. A representative sample of photographs
depicting the variation of topography and vegetation in the project area can be
found in Appendix II.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
General
The records check at the TARL revealed that no professional
investigations have been conducted in the APE, and no archaeological sites
have been recorded in the APE or in close proximity to the APE. Prehistoric
sites are commonly tied to a dependable water source. No such areas exist in
the APE, and this is viewed as a major reason that no evidence of prehistoric
utilization was found. Sites not tied to water are often referred to as quarry or
lithic procurement sites. These sites are areas where chert or other materials
suitable for the manufacture of stone tools is present on the surface. No such
materials were observed; therefore, this would explain the absence of a quarry
site. The high hill in the approximate center offers great visibility of the
surrounding terrain. Therefore, it is not unlikely that it was used as an area of
observation for game and other objects of interest in prehistoric and historic
times. Since no artifacts dating to prehistoric or historic times were observed,
this is only speculation.
Historic sites can occur virtually anywhere on the landscape. The APE is
located within the very large Cavender Ranch. No historic artifacts were
observed, and it is possible that this area was only used as range for cattle and
other related ranch activities. Our local informants stated that they believe that
there never were any structures on this part of the ranch. Other ranch related
features such as windmills, stock dip tanks, and watering troughs were also
absent.
Topography, Vegetation, and Soils
The terrain ranges from generally level to gently rolling. Trees are
dominantly mesquite with a few scattered cedar trees. Understory vegetation
includes sage, yucca, prickly pear cactus, grama grasses, and other various
perennial species. Limestone and quartzite gravel were present on elevated
areas. The drainage south of the westernmost ridge is the largest one. It is about
2.5 meters wide and less than a meter deep. It was dry at the time of the visit.
Ground visibility was at least 50 percent and eye-height visibility was limited to
approximately 30 meters in the mesquite forested area, but It was excellent in the
grassy areas.
The beginning of the survey at State Highway 350 was in a mesquite
forest, but within 150 meters, grassland was present. Mesquite forested areas
alternated with grassland and mesquite and grassland areas along the route of
the proposed road. The amount of grassland was estimated to cover about
about two-thirds of the proposed route while mesquite forest and mesquite/forest
constituted the remaining one-third of the route.

The soils in the APE are a mixture of clay and clay loam with occasional
areas of caliche. They are part of an environment setting that is not typical of
those where deeply stratified prehistoric sites are found. The western end of the
APE is not far from Canyon Creek but shovel testing and surface inspection did
not find any evidence of previous occupation. It is possible that the surface
present today may be regarded as recent due to deflation and erosion caused by
wind and rain. Discussions of the various soils in the project area found in the
soil survey suggest that the A horizon has been removed due to years of farming.
The B horizon for the Mansker soil type (MkB) is clay loam, and the A horizon is
loam. The absence of loamy soils in the project area suggests that most, if not
all, of the A horizon for this soil type is no longer present.
The surface inspection and shovel tests revealed the following soil data in
the APE. Thirty-two tests were dug at intervals of 100 meters. All but one test
(ST 25) was dug through brown (7.5YR 4/4 and 75YR 4/3)) clayey loam or strong
brown (7.5YR 4/6) clayey loam. The depth of these tests varied from 22 cm to
35 cm. All of the tests were dug in an upland setting on a deflated surface and
they were terminated when a sufficient depth was reached. Two shovel tests
were stopped due to caliche and three tests were terminated because of thick
gravel deposits that could not be penetrated with a shovel.
Findings
Approximately 28 meters west of Shovel Test 19 a chert cobble (Figure 4)
and three pieces of lithic debris were observed on the surface within an area of
about 1000 square meters. These specimens did not exhibit any evidence of
alteration by humans. The entire APE was closely examined for cultural
materials, and nothing else was found. In the same area, a large sherd of glaze
ware was observed on the surface. This specimen is described in this report as
an isolated find and not part of a historic site that should be recorded.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No archaeological sites were found during the current survey. It is, therefore,
recommended that construction be allowed to proceed as planned without further
consultation with the THC. Should the construction plans change that will involve
additional work in an area that is believed to be a likely setting for significant cultural
resources, the THC must be notified in case additional survey is warranted. If
cultural materials are unearthed during construction all work in the area of the find
must stop until the THC can evaluate the situation. This study conformed to the
Minimum Survey Standards as defined by the Archaeology Division of the THC.
