ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of 19.6 linear miles of proposed water
transmission pipeline in Reagan County was conducted by Brazos Valley
Research Associates (BVRA) on August 19-20, 2014 (Antiquities Permit 6992).
This project was carried out for the Reagan County Water Supply District (WSD).
William E. Moore was the Principal Investigator and Jesse Todd was the Project
Archaeologist. No sites were found and it is recommended that the client be
allowed to proceed with construction as planned. No cemeteries or standing
structures were observed near the Area of Potential Effect (APE). Copies of the
final report are on file at the Texas Historical Commission (THC), Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), the Texas State Library, Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT), BVRA, Enprotec/Hibbs & Todd, Inc., and
various libraries and other repositories.

INTRODUCTION
The Reagan County WSD in Big Lake plans to replace 19.6 miles of water
transmission pipeline that will connect the district’s well field with the ground
storage tanks in Big Lake. Some of the pipeline will be adjacent to ranch roads
paved with caliche that parallel State Highway 137 and Ranch Road 33,
approximately 2.5 miles to 3.5 miles to the west. The remainder will traverse crosscountry. The pipe is 18 inches in diameter and will be placed in a trench 42 inches
wide with a minimum of 3 feet of cover. The working easement will not exceed 50
feet and the width of the permanent easement will be 15 feet. The pipeline will
cross Divide Draw, Big Jim Draw, Red House Draw, Centralia Draw, and and some
of their tributaries. These drainages will be crossed using the trenching method on
level ground, slopes, and escarpments.
The proposed route of the pipeline begins at the water storage tanks at 12th
Street and State Highway 137 (Appendix II, Figure 1) and proceeds due north for
about 560 meters through an industrial area of Big Lake in street and highway
right-of-way on the east side of the roads. Next, it crosses over onto private
property and continues to the north along the east side of State Highway 137 for
about 1060 meters. At that point, it turns to the east for a distance of about 2920
meters and parallels another fence line. Then it makes another turn to the north
and parallels the east side of a fence for about 1723 meters until it encounters
Rocker B Road. At that point, it continues to the north and parallels Rocker B
Road on the east side of a fence for about 1810 meters. For the next 300
meters, the pipeline will be placed within a road surfaced with gravel and caliche.
Past this road and continuing north, the pipeline will be placed in a two-track road
surfaced with limestone gravel and dirt for about 574 meters until the southern
edge of the first major ridge is encountered. The distance from the top of the
ridge to the base is about 130 meters. From the base of the ridge on the north
side, the pipeline will traverse a valley for a distance of about 13,235 meters.
Within this area, it crosses Big Jim Draw and two of its tributaries. The trench will
be dug in the road or immediately adjacent to it on the east side. Next, it turns to
the northwest and parallels a two-track oil field road paved with gravel for about
3020 meters. When it leaves the oil field road it crosses a high ridge referred to
as Moore Hill on the topographic quadrangle. At the base of Moore Hill there is a
small drainage called Red House Draw. The next drainage is Centralia Draw.
The pipeline crosses both draws for a total of 1000 meters. The length of the
remainder of the proposed pipeline to the point where it ends at an existing water
storage tank is about 4200 meters. The footprint of the proposed transmission
line crosses varying types of terrain that varies in elevation from 2485 feet to
2760 feet above mean sea level (amsl). Much of the land is flat but it is broken
up in places by ridges and draws with floodplains and banks that vary from gently
sloping to steep. The project area is depicted on the USGS 7.5’ topographic
quadrangles Big Lake (3101-123), Divide Draw (3101-132), and Moore Hill
(3101-133).

ENVIRONMENT
Robert Schmidt (1988) refers to this area as being in the semiarid zone of
the Chihuahuan Desert biotic province. The soil survey for Reagan and Upton
counties (Butler 2003:10) places Reagan County in the western part of the
Edwards Plateau Major Land Resource Area. The valleys in this area were
formed by streams that originally cut deep V-shaped valleys that have been filled
with water-laid deposits. In some places, the valley fill is more than 100 feet
thick. Typically these valleys have broad, flat floors. Burgess and Turpin
(2013b:4) describe the area as “generally flat, the soils are thin, the climate arid,
the vegetation sparse, and water scarce.” The area is described by Ferguson
(1986) as the “Eldorado Divide” because this water from this “arid crest” drains
into the Concho River system to the south, the Pecos and Devils rivers to the
west, and the Llano and San Saba rivers to the east. In the heart of this area is
Big Lake, the largest playa lake in Texas. It is classified as an “internal drainage”
that is fed by Big Lake Draw on the west and Sugar Draw on the east.
Hydrology
The three major sources of water in this area are natural springs, playa
lakes, and draws. Playa lakes are depressions in the earth that are two to twenty
feet lower than the surroundiung plains. They are dry much of the year but fill
with water following heavy rains and/or runoff from some of the major draws. The
only sources of water within the path of the proposed transmission line are Big
Jim Draw, Red House Draw, and Centralia Draw and their tributaries. These
draws are often dry and contain water only on a seasonal basis when they are
fed by rainfall. Centralia Draw is a tributary of the Middle Concho River and gets
its water from runoff from other draws and and higher elevations.
Geology
The surface geology of the project area consists of Pleistocene and
Holocene deposits. Just north of the town of Big Lake, the APE traverses a
semi-rolling topgraphy and crosses a high ridge at an elevation of 2760 feet
above mean sea level (amsl). This ridge overlooks the sloping terrain that leads
to the south bank of Big Jim Draw. The overall surface exposure in this area is
identified by the San Angelo Sheet of the Geologic Atlas of Texas (Barnes 1974)
as belonging to the Segovia Formation (Ks) and Buda Limestone (Kbu). The top
of the ridge is mainly made up of Buda Limestone at or very near the surface.
This material typically consists of marly, nodular limestone and thin yellow marl.
Often the top portion is eroded. The slopes are those areas where outcrops of
the Segovia Formation is visible. These areas are characterized by cherty
limestone and dolomite in the upper strata and millolid limestone and marl and
marly limestone in the lower strata. These areas are often expressed as
prominent ledges and caprock. These surfaces are ancient and date to the Lower
Cretaceous period.

7

A large portion of the APE crosses lower elevations drained by draws and
gullys. The surface geology in the inter-drainage areas consists of Quaternary
desposits (Oau) formed during the Pleistocene and Holocene periods. Oau soils
are intimately associated with alluvium and these areas include caliche covered
by silt in generally sloping areas. The channel of Big Jim Draw passes through
narrow exposures of Holocene soils described as Alluvium (Oal) and broader
expanses of Lower Cretaceous limestone belong to the Edwards Group (Kft).
Some of the tributaries are closley associated with outcrops of limestone
belonging to the Edwards Group, Segovia Formation. The APE leaves these
rugged expanses of the draws and passes through large areas of Quaternary
windblown sands (Ocs) to the end of the survey area. These sands were
deposited during the early part of the Pleistocene. They are described as fine to
medium-grained quartz, silty, calcareous, caliche nodules. A few areas may
include younger deposits.
Climate
In his publicaton on Texas weather George Bowmar (1983), describes the
current climate as semiarid. The amount of precipitation averages less than 17
inches annually. The weather reporting station at Big Lake has documented
annual rainfall that varied from 7.5 inches in 1956 during the height of a major
drought to 39 inches in 1974. Turpin (1994:3) states that local informants recall a
24 hour period in when 11 inches of rain was recorded on Big Lake Draw in
1974. Winds are primarily from the south or southwest and average 9 to 12
miles per hour. Temperatures can be extreme and range from 0 degrees
Fahrenheit in the winter months to 107 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer.
Soils
Most of the soils in the project area are gravelly and rocky and have little
depth. Along the draws, the soils belong to the Rioconcho series and the CongerReagan series. The only deep soils in the project area belong to the Rioconcho
series and have a B Horizon that consists of silty clay to a depth of about 75
centimeters. Conger-Reagan gravelly soils with B-horizon of 8 inches are also a
common soil type along the draws.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located in a county where significant prehistoric and
historic sites have been documented. According to Burgess and Turpin
(2013b:12), Reagan County is in a transitional zone between three defined
cultural areas. These are the Southern Plains on the north, the Eastern TransPecos to the west, and the Lower Pecos to the east. Previous archaeological
investigations have recorded sites dating to the Paleoindian period through the
Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods as well as historic sites that date to the early
history of Reagan County and West Texas. Evidence of Paleoindian occupation
exists at several sites where isolated finds of projectile point types Folsom,
Midland, and Plainview have been reported.
Playa lakes are abundant in the area and these sources of water attracted
prehistoric and historic peoples and various species of wildlife. Big Lake is fed
by Big Lake Draw on the west and Sugar Draw on the east and is the largest
known playa lake in Texas. On one of its banks, archaeologists recorded the
remains of a small herd of bison associated with scrapers, projectile points, and
burned rock (Turpin et al.1993). This site (41RG13) was interpreted as a single
event that occurred about 8000 years ago. The only Paleoindian point in the area
that has been found in a stratigraphic context is a Milnesand base from that site.
Archaic and Late Prehistoric sites in Reagan County include burned rock
middens, hearths, lithic scatters, and quarries. Boat shaped bedrock mortars in
the county are typically viewed as an indication of food processing
(Riemenschneider 1994). Riemenschneider (1994:3) offers a possible
alternative use. He states that the reason they penetrated the bedrock could
have been a way to obtain water in this arid region. Seepage from the water
table could percolate through the limestone and collect in the mortar. Although
archaeologists have conducted investigations in various parts of the county, the
area that has received the most attention is Big Lake and Big Lake Draw. Work
at these areas has been carried out by Burgess and Turpin (2011, 2012, 2013a),
Turpin (1994), and Turpin et al. (1993).
Centralia Draw is the only drainage in the project area where
archaeological sites have been recorded. The Concho Valley Archeological
Society conducted a survey of parts of Rocker B Ranch in 1993. During this
investigation, they conducted an intensive surface inspection along Centralia
Draw that resulted in the documenting of nine sites (41RG32 – 41RG37 and
41RG 65, 41RG67, and 41RG69). The prehistoric sites and components consist
primarily of surface scatters of burned rock and lithic debris along the draw and
some of its tributaries. The size of the sites is based on cultural materials
exposed on the surface. Since shovel testing was not conducted, the depth of
deposits is not known but the recorders believe that cultural materials are not
likely to be present below about three inches.

9

The age of these sites is based on surface finds of dart points and arrow
points that suggest an Archaic occupation at four sites and a Late Prehistoric
occupation at two sites. According to Larry Riemenschneider (personal
communication), the Rocker B Ranch survey did not cover 100% of Centralia
Draw and the current APE was probably not examined.
This area has been the focus of early military activity on the Texas frontier
and later settlements associated with ranching and the development of towns.
Camp Grierson was a military outpost of Fort Concho, one of the forts that was
built to protect settlers from hostile Indians. This outpost was established at
Grierson’s Springs (41RG3), a reliable source of water in a desert environment
(Riemenscheider 1994). The firing range associated with the camp (41RG77) is
the only designated State Archeological Landmark in the county. Other recorded
historic sites in Reagan County include the remains of a 1920-1930 era
farmstead (41RG24), the Texon Boy Scout Camp (41RG83), a wooden structure
built of railroad ties and recycled telephone poles and partially burned during a
grass fire. Along Centralia Draw, the Concho Valley Archeological Society
recorded three sites with historic components that are described as breastworks
(41RG67), the mail road used by the Butterfield Stage Line (41RG65), and a
stagecoach station and storehouse (41RG35) belonging to the Butterfield line.
Local residents believe the breastworks may have been constructed by Buffalo
Soldiers as protection from hostile Indians. This site could also have served as
a rest stop for wagons hauling water or cowboys driving cattle herds north. Big
Lake is the county seat and the only functioning town in the county.
There are several ghost towns in the county that contain few or no
structures such as Santa Rita, Stiles, Best, and Texon. The town of Best was
recorded as 41RG76 during a historical survey of the county but no forms were
submitted. The author documented a small concrete jail in Best and this building
is the only standing structure remaining in town. In Stiles, there is only one
building left and it is the ruins of the rock courthouse (41RG71) that began
operation in 1911. The small wooden jail (41RG368) that used to stand next to
the courthouse has been moved from Stiles to Big Lake as a memory of lawless
times in the area. A website documenting these jails and others in Texas can be
accessed at www.tinytexasjails.com.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, the Archeological Site Atlas (hereafter referred
to as the Atlas) was checked for previously recorded sites and past surveys in
the area. Jean Hughes checked the site files at TARL for newly recorded sites
that are not on the Atlas. Archaeological reports were reviewed during the
planning stages of this project in order to become familiar with the types of sites
in the area and where they are likely to be found. Some of the documents
reviewed include contract reports by Burgess and Turpin (2011, 2012, 2013a),
Turpin (1994), and Turpin et al. (1993). The interested reader is referred to these
sources for additional information regarding the prehistory of this area. The
survey was conducted on August 18-19, 2014.
The field methods consisted of a 100% Pedestrian Survey and testing with
shovels and an auger. Testing was conducted in those areas near the draws that
have the deepest soils. Other areas, especially where bedrock was shallow, were
probed but not tested. These areas were visually inspected for the presence of
cultural materials exposed on the surface. The soil from each test was screened
using ¼ inch hardware cloth and the soil color was described using the Munsell
Color Chart. Shovel test data were recorded on a log that appears as Appendix I
to this report. The location of each test was plotted on a field map and their
relative position is depicted in figures 3 and 5. In addition, GPS coordinates were
taken at each test. The shovel test intervals varied depending on the terrain with
intervals of 100 meters when possible.
Information regarding the areas that were tested and those that were
subjected to a surface inspection can be found in the field notes (Appendix III).
The notes also describe in greater detail the types of vegetation encountered
along the route of the proposed pipeline. Twenty-one shovel tests were
excavated to depths of 16-85 centimeters below the ground surface. The project
area was documented through digital photography intended to illustrate the
various field conditions as they existed at the time of this survey. A
representative sample of photographs depicting the variation of topography and
vegetation in the project area can be found in Appendix II.

Unnamed Drainage
The first drainage in the APE is an unnamed draw on the first ridge
overlooking the valley where Big Jim Draw is located (Appendix II, Figure 2). It is
very small and barely discernable as a drainge. It begins near the top of the
ridge and flows downhill to the east. Shovel testing was not done due to
limestone bedrock on the surface.
Big Jim Draw
The topographic quadrangle depicts Big Jim Draw as 900 meters wide but
its exact location was also not clearly discernable. According to John Voller
(Construction Manager), the biologist for this project had a difficult time
identifying the exact location of the channel. A field determination was made that
it is probably somewhere between the slopes on each side. The vegetation
consisted mainly of mesquite trees, grama grasses, Johnson grass, and
miscellaneous perennials. Because the exact bounaries of the drainage could
not be determined shovel tests were dug in intervals of 100 meters when
possible. They were dug where the slopes converge. Ten areas were tested
with shovels and an auger (Figure 3). The soils are mainly loamy clay with
Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3) particles. The depth of tests in this area varied
from 15 centimeters below the ground surface to a maximum depth of 85
centimeters. The composition of the soil varied from being so hard that it could
not be peneterated with an auger to very fine loam that would not adhere to the
auger and, therefore, could not be retrieved. The first six tests were dug with a
shovel to a depth of 30-45 centimeters. Below that depth, an auger was used.
Shovel Test 10 was the most shallow. It was terminated when limestone bedrock
was encountered at 15 centimeters. Tests 1-9 were excavated at intervals of
about 100 meters and they generally encountered two to three soil horizons. The
B horizon was probably shallower than the soil horizon where the CaCO3 was
encountered. No tests were dug on steep slopes. A segment of Big Jim Draw is
depicted in Appendix III (Figure 3).
Minor Tributaries
Several branches or tributaries connect with Big Jim Draw to the north.
These are very minor and also barely recognizable as a drainage. The first is
depicted in Appendix II (Figure 4) and the second is also depicted in Appendix II
(Figure 5).

12

Red House Draw
The next drainage tested was the channel and floodplain of Red House
Draw (Appendix II, Figure 6), the first drainage below Moore Hill. The channel
was estimated in the field to be about 6 meters wide and 1 meter deep. Although
the area was heavily vegetated, ground visibility was at least 30%. The banks
were tested first and that is where shovel tests 11-12 were dug (Figure 5). The
soil in these two tests is loamy clay that was impossible to penetrate beyond 53
and 68 centimeters with an auger.
Centralia Draw
Centralia Draw was the next drainage encountered. It is located to the
north of Moore Hill (Appendix II, Figure 7) and is part of a wide canyon system
(Appendix II, Figure 8). The exact dimensions of the draw could not be
determined but its size was estimated to be about 15 meters wide and 2 meters
deep. Surface visibility was excellent along the channel. The banks were
visually inspected for a distance of 20 meters in each direction from the center of
the APE. Shovel tests 11-21 were dug in the valley and on the banks (Figure 5).
Shovel Test 17 was dug on a small ridge that may be part of an overbank levee.
The loamy clay was so hard that the Project Archaeologist and John Voller could
not turn the auger in nine of these tests. The depth of the remaining tests varied
from 47 centimeters to 74 centimeters and were dug through loamy clay. A
closeup of the draw is depicted in Appendix II (Figure 9).
Rest of Project Area
The topographic quadrangle Moore Hill depicts a small drainage in a
valley below an upland ridge north of Centralia Draw. This feature, however,
could not be found. The proposed pipeline proceeds to the north before ending
at a pump station and storage tanks (Appendix II, Figure 10).

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The records check at the TARL revealed that no professional
investigations have been conducted in the APE and no archaeological sites are
known to exist. Much of the APE contains shallow soils with excellent surface
exposure. Cultural materials in this type of setting would be at or very near the
surface that has been deflated due to erosion caused by wind and rain and many
sites have been affected by disturbance created by human intervention. The
primary culprits are roads, ranching activities, and oil and gas exploration. No
evidence of a prehistoric or historic site other than modern utilization was
observed within the length of the proposed pipeline. A single windmill just to the
north of Big lake is probably related to a large ranch but no evidence of any
structures or other features were observed in the APE.
Not one of the recorded sites on Centralia and Red House draws was
shovel tested by the Concho Valley Archeological Society. Their investigation
consisted of a Pedestrian Survey on both sides of the draws. Solveig A. Turpin
and Larry Riemenschneider have worked extensively in this area for several
years and it is their opinion that sites in the APE would be restricted to the
surface or are very shallow. Dr. Turpin has participated in the recording of more
than 1100 sites in the area. Even though surface visibility was excellent in many
areas, the Project Archaeologist elected to dig shovel tests to test the potential
for buried sites. These tests were dug to at least 40 centimeters with negative
results.
Most prehistoric sites are associated with a dependable source of water.
The exception is special activity sites where water is not a requirement such as a
lithic procurement site or short term camps. The three major sources of water in
the area are natural springs, playa lakes, and draws. Playa lakes are
depressions in the earth that fill with water following heavy rains and/or runoff
from some of the major draws. These intermittent sources of water are
numerous and often associated with prehistoric sites becase they are lined with
clay soils that retain water for short periods. Draws are channels that only
contain water as a result of rain. A draw is defined as an area of runoff that
originates at a higher elevation and flows in only one direction. These
topographical features feed other water sources such as playa lakes.
The logical conclusion as to the the nature of prehistoric settlement along
Centralia and Red House draws is that these areas were occupied on a
temporary basis that probably coincided with available water that had remained
in the draws as a result of ponding. These sites typically contain lithic debris
and/or the remains of small hearths. Projectile points are rare but Archaic and
Late Prehistoric types have been reported. The sites along these draws are
important because they reflect the local pattern of settlement. Not one site

14

reported to date is eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places or
for designation as a State Archeological Landmark.
RECOMMENDATIONS
No archaeological sites were found during the current survey. It is, therefore,
recommended that construction be allowed to proceed as planned without further
consultation with the THC. Should the construction plans change that will involve
additional work in an area that is believed to be a likely setting for a prehistoric site
or historic site, the THC must be notified in case additional survey is warranted. If
cultural materials are unearthed during construction all work in the area of the find
must stop until the THC can evaluate the situation. This study conformed to the
Minimum Survey Standards as defined by the Archaeology Division of the THC.

Appendix III: Field Notes
(by Jesse Todd)
Most of the 19.5 mile pipeline route is to be placed either in a roadway,
adjacent to a roadway, or in highway right-of-way (ROW). Only about 3.5 miles
were difficult to walk because of brush and other natural obstacles. The various
roads in or near the Area of Potential Effect (APE) provided good access to many
areas.
The survey began at two water storage tanks located at 12th Street and
State Highway 137 where the water line will be connected. We followed the
route to the north. For the first 678 m, the pipeline will be placed in city ROW in a
business and industrial area. No shovel tests were dug in this disturbed and very
low probability area.
Next, the route turns to the east for about 20 m and will be on private
property where it parallels a fence on the east side. Vegetation consisted mainly
of mesquite trees, grama grasses, Johnson grass, and miscellaneous perennials.
The terrain is undulating and for about a 1/3 of the distance is in a low spot that
contained water from recent rains.
The next segment is due north for a distance of about 1350 m. Ground
visibility was less than 20 % and eye-height varied from 1 m to 100 m or more.
The pipeline route then turns east and runs for approximately 2889 m
before turning to the north. It parallels a fence and road and it is in the road
where the trench for the pipe will be dug. Ground visibility was at least 80 % and
eye-height visibility was excellent. The vegetation was similar to that described
above.
The pipeline route turns north, paralleling a fence, and runs until Rocker B
Road is encountered, a distance of about 1700 m. Vegetation is basically the
same as in the areas previously described except prickly pear cactus and yucca
plants were present. Ground visibility averaged 30 percent while eye height
ranged from good to excellent.
From Rocker B Road to the edge of the the first high ridge is approximately
2609 meters. The pipe will be placed in a trench east of and parallel to a fence in
an existing caliche road. At this point, it will be put in the center of an existing
two-track road.

According to the topographic quadrangle, the first drainage is about 220 m
wide but the drainage itself is only about 30 m wide and 4 m deep. Ground
visibility was about 50 to 60%. The surface was littered with limestone gravels,
cobbles and boulders. For this reason, no shovel tests were excavated on bank
of drainage. A red ant mound was found on top of the hill but no cultural
materials were present on its surface. Vegetation was similar to that described
above.
From the base of the ridge, the proposed pipeline runs for about 8780 m
across a valley before crossing Big Jim Draw and two of its tributaries. A road
was present along the east side of a fence that the proposed route will parallel
and that made walking easy. The pipeline route will either be placed in the
roadway or immediately adjacent to it on the east side. Vegetation was similar to
that described above but the mesquite was in small stands surrounded by areas
of open ground covered with limestone gravel and cobbles and grassy areas
similar to a savannah-type environment . Away from the road, ground visibility
ranged from 30 to 80% and eye-height visibility varied from 10 m to 1/4 mile or
more.
According to the map, the drainage area for Big Jim Draw is about 900 m
wide but that distance did not seem to be correct in the field as no discernible
channel was observed. Nonetheless, shovel tests 1-9 were dug across the
valley. John Voller, an employee of the Reagan County Water Supply District
who accompanied me, said the biologist had a hard time determining where the
channel was. I made a field determination that the channel is that area between
the slopes on either side. Since no discernible drainage was noticeable, shovel
tests were not dug on each bank. Instead, they were dug in intervals of about
100 m.
Shovel tests generally encountered two to three soil horizons and all testing
was halted when the soil was too fine to adhere to the auger. The B horizon was
probably shallower than the soil horizon where the CaCO3 was encountered.
Shovel testing was terminated when the ground began to rise visibly upslope.
Two tributaries of Big Jim Creek that conjoin are located approximately
2760 m north of Shovel Test 9. They were marked by a small depression about
100 m wide and less than 1 m deep. No shovel test was placed on the south
bank because limestone bedrock was exposed on the surface and because
Shovel test 10 encountered shallow loamy clay overlying limestone bedrock.
The northernmost tributary of Big Jim Creek was also hard to find. Finally a
small depression was determined to be headwater of the drainage. Since it was
not easily discernible, no shovel tests were excavated.

We walked the entire distance from the northernmost tributary to the where
the proposed route turns to the northwest. No shovel tests were excavated due
to gravelly soil and good-to-excellent ground visibility.
The proposed pipeline turns northwest and parallels a gravel two-track oil
field road for about 2270 m. Since the proposed pipeline was west of and
adjacent to the road, it was easy walking due to good ground visibility and lack of
mesquite along the fence line.
The proposed pipeline route departs from the oil field road and crosses
Moore Hill. Ground visibility across the hill was at least 50% and eye-height
visibility ranged from 10 m to 100 m. Barrel cacti were present on the ridge. No
chert cobbles were noted but some were present at its base. None appeared to
have been tested. From where the road departs to another oil field road
northwest of the hill is about 1335 meters.
The distance from the oil field road south of Moore Hill to another road north
of Centralia Draw is 1602 m. Centralia Draw’s channel and floodplain, along with
Red Horse Draw, is approximately 800 m wide. Shovel tests 11-21 were dug
along this route; Shovel tests 11 and 12 were dug on the banks of Red Horse
Creek; Shovel tests 13-15 were dug 100 m apart; Shovel tests 16-18 were dug
on the banks of Centralia Draw, and Shovel tests 19-21 were placed at 100 m
intervals.
Red House Draw is located at the base of Moore Hill. This draw is about 6
m wide and 1 m deep. In addition to the vegetation already described, a
perennial species was almost waist high in places. Despite the amount of
vegetation, ground visibility was at least 30%. Eye-height visibility, however, was
between 1 and 10 m.
Centralia Draw is about 15 m wide and 2 m deep. Shovel Test 16 was
placed on its south bank. Shovel Test 17 was placed on a small ridge or
possible overbank levee prior to encountering the north bank, and Shovel Test
18 was placed on the north bank. Bank exposure was excellent in many places
along the banks; therefore, a total width of 20 m to the east and west was walked
from the center of the pipeline route. No cultural materials were noted.
Shovel tests usually encountered three soil horizons and the soil was
usually so compact that two men could not turn it. Soils around the draws slightly
different from floodplain soils.
From the oil field north of Centralia Draw to the northern ridge is about 1560
m. The land slopes gently upward and then follows a bench until the drainage is
encountered. Since the drainage was close to the edge of the ridge and its
headwater, it was not tested. From the drainage to the top of the ridge the slope
was fairly steep and littered with boulders.

From the edge of the ridge north to where the route terminates at a water
storage tank is about 2050 m. After the initial slight rise from the ridge, the terrain
is generally level. The pipeline route will cross several oil field roads and
abandoned well pads. Vegetation consisted mainly of various grass species and
miscellaneous perennials. Mesquite was scattered. Ground visibility ranged from
40-100%. Eye height visibility was excellent.
