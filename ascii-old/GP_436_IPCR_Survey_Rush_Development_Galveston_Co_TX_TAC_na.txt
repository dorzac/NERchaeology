ABSTRACT
HRA Gray & Pape, LLC (HRA Gray & Pape), of Houston, Texas, performed an
intensive pedestrian survey on approximately 41.42 hectares (102.36 acres) of private
property in Galveston County, Texas. The property is associated with the Rush
Development, L.P. residential development project.
The Lead Federal Agency for the project is the United States Army Corps of
Engineers, Galveston District (USACE) (Permit No. SWG-2007-01273). The goals of the
cultural resources survey were to determine if land altering activities required to complete
this project would affect any previously identified historic properties as defined by Section
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended (36 CFR 800),
and to establish whether or not previously unidentified cultural resources were located within
the project’s area of potential effect (Advisory Council on Historic Preservation [ACHP]
1999).
As a result of the investigation, a total of 42 shovel tests and ten auger tests, as well as
19 probes were excavated within the project area. No new or previously identified
archaeological sites or historic standing structures were recorded during the investigation.
Based on the negative results of the intensive pedestrian survey, HRA Gray & Pape
recommends no further work and that the project be allowed to proceed as planned.

INTRODUCTION
HRA Gray & Pape, LLC (HRA Gray & Pape), of Houston, Texas, performed an intensive
pedestrian survey on a total of approximately 41.42 hectares (102.36 acres) of property in
Galveston County, Texas. The property is associated with the Rush Development, L.P.
residential development project. The Lead Federal Agency for the project is the United
States Army Corps of Engineers, Galveston District (USACE). The survey was conducted
entirely on privately owned property. Therefore, a Texas Antiquities Permit was not
required. The archaeological Area of Potential Effect (APE) is defined as all 41.42 hectares
(102.36 acres) of property associated with the project.
The goals of the cultural resources survey were to determine if land altering activities
required to complete this project would affect any previously identified historic properties as
defined by Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as
amended (36 CFR 800), and to establish whether or not previously unidentified cultural
resources were located within the project’s area of potential effect (Advisory Council on
Historic Preservation [ACHP] 1999).

PROJECT AREA
The surveyed area is located on the San Luis Pass and Sea Isle United States
Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle maps in Galveston County,
Texas (Figure 1). The surveyed area is located on the west end of Galveston Island. The
project area is bounded to the northwest by the West Bay and to the southeast by TerminiSan Luis Pass Road (Highway 3005). The eastern and western boundaries were determined
by private fencing.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Crew Chief Charles E. Bludau and Senior Technician Elizabeth Spalding led the field
effort. Fieldwork was conducted in March of 2008 and required approximately 49 person
hours to complete. Principal Investigator Rebecca Sick completed site file research prior to
fieldwork mobilization. James Hughey acted as Project Manager. Tony Scott and Julia
Balakirova produced graphics. Charles Bludau prepared the content of the report. The
report was edited by Rebecca Sick and produced by Jessica Campbell.

SOILS
The survey area contains soils consisting primarily of soils within the Galveston-Nass
Complex and the Mustang-Nass Complex. Specific soils in the project area include Mustang
fine sand, saline and Mustang fine sand, slightly saline, and beaches.
The Galveston-Nass Complex (Gc) is found on dunes and depressions on barrier
islands. This complex is excessively drained, with ponding rare. Mustang fine sand (Mp) is
poorly drained, and is also found on barrier islands and depressions. While this soil is
frequently flooded, water does not collect in ponds. Mustang fine sand (Ms) is slightly saline
compared to Mustang fine sand (Mp). Finally, the Mustang-Nass complex is composed of
sandy eolian deposits and storm wash-over sediments of Holocene age
(http://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gove/app/ 2008).

CULTURE HISTORY AND PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Galveston County was formed with the help of Brazoria, Harrisburg (Harris), and
Liberty County in 1838. The first occupation of the area began in 1815 when a few ships
associated with Henry Perry and Waren D. C. Hall landed at Bolivar Point. Jean Laffite
formed the first community recorded on the island of Galveston in 1817 known as
Campeche. The small fort only survived until 1819 when it was destroyed by storm.
Archaeologists have discovered a very important piece of research in the Galveston
County area. There are two highly organized local mortuary traditions in the region. The
earliest of these traditions dates to the Late Archaic and is found inland in the Lower
Brazos/Colorado River valleys on the western edge of the region (see Hall 1981).
The second mortuary tradition found in Southeast Texas dates to the Late Prehistoric/
Protohistoric periods and is found in the Galveston Bay Area (Patterson 1995; Aten et al.
1976; Ricklis 1994). Burials in this tradition are often flexed or semiflexed and are
associated with locally manufactured grave goods. Red ochre is associated with some
burials. The local grave goods found in these interments include marine shell beads and
pendants, bird bone flutes, bone dice and awls, fishhooks, and projectile points. In the
Protohistoric and Historic periods burials are typically extended, with some graves being
enclosed within stone structures. Included with Historic period burials are trade goods such
as glass beads, iron tools and nails, and mirror glass fragments (Ricklis 1994).
Before colonization started in the area, early Spanish explorers used to refer to the
island as Isla de Malhado (Isle of Misfortune). This name is credited to Alvar Nunez Cabeza
de Vaca, who was shipwrecked in the area in 1528. During the exploration of the area by
Rene Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle the island of Galveston was designated San Louis to
3

honor the king of France Louis XIV. The island of Galveston finally achieved its current
name in 1783 when the channel was surveyed and the bay was named Galvezton in honor of
Viceroy Bernardo de Galvez. Although the land held its name of San Luis for a time, by
1820 it was being called Galveston Island.
In 1822, the ship Revenge brought a small group of Americans to settle a part of
Galveston County and in 1827 the first American settlement was established near Offat’s
Bayou. Stephen F. Austin helped spark the flow of settlers to the area by convincing the
government of Mexico to build a port and customhouse on the island. In 1830, a company
called the Galveston Bay and Texas Land Company was formed by David G. Burnet and
Lorenzo de Zavala to help settle the area under the Mexican colonization laws. By the time
that the United States annexed Texas, Galveston was the largest city in Texas with a
population of 3,500.
The island of Galveston has had a tumultuous past including being taken over by
Northern forces during the Civil War in 1862, having a yellow fever epidemic in 1864, which
all but wiped out the population, and even surviving one of the worst hurricanes on record in
1900. Through all of this Galveston has remained strong and prosperous. It was still
recorded as the largest city in Texas in 1880 with over 530 businesses, ten hotels, and 127
saloons (Kleiner 2000). The town continued to prosper up to 1930 with railway access being
improved with the construction of a causeway and interurban railroad (Kleiner 2000).
Today Galveston County is one of the most populated counties in Texas, with about
half of the land being used for farming or ranching. The Galveston area still remains a focal
point for medical services as well as aquatic research.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Site file research was initiated by reviewing records maintained by the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas, and by consulting on-line
research archives maintained by the Texas Historical Commission (THC). Research was
conducted within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) study radius of the project area to identify all
previously recorded archaeological sites, historical markers and historic structures eligible
for National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) listing. Site file research was used to
provide a historic context to the archaeological survey.
The archaeological investigations associated with the current undertaking were
designed to identify and record the existence of cultural resources, prehistoric and historic,
within the defined project boundaries. The entire tract was subjected to intensive pedestrian
cultural resources survey. Archaeological investigations included a combination of surface
(pedestrian survey) and subsurface (shovel and auger testing, probing) testing methods.

The project area was surveyed along a series of transects spaced 30 meters (100 feet)
apart. Transects in the survey area were surveyed on a northwest-southeast axis using
Highway 3005 as a fixed landmark for reference.
Texas minimum survey standards call for one shovel test every 1.2 hectares (3 acres) in
projects between 40 and 80 hectares (100 and 200 acres) in size. For this survey, a total of 70
shovel tests were planned for excavation (Figure 2). Transects were placed 30 meters (100 feet)
apart. Shovel tested transects were spaced 90 meters (295 feet) apart. Two pedestrian
surveyed transects were walked over between the shovel tested transects and the ground
surface was examined for exposed artifacts. On the shovel tested transects, a 60-meter (196foot) interval was used between each shovel test. Shovel tests were not excavated in areas of
standing water or in areas with saturated soils. For any area where shovel tests were not
excavated, auger tests were placed or the area was probed with a fiberglass probe in order to
determine if buried shell deposits were present within the survey area.
Excavated shovel tests measured 30 centimeters (12 inches) in diameter and were
typically excavated into the underlying substratum, or until culturally sterile subsoil was
encountered. Removed soils were screened through 0.64-centimeter (0.25-inch) hardware
cloth. Descriptions of soil texture and color followed standard terminology and soil color
charts. Additional information concerning soils encountered was recorded on standardized
shovel test forms for each excavation. See Appendix A and Figure 3 for descriptions of all
excavated shovel tests and auger tests.
RESULTS
Site file research resulted in no previously identified archaeological sites within 1.6
kilometers (1-mile) of the project area. The majority of the project area is covered with short
scrub and shrub foliage as well as beach grass. At the time of survey the area contained
inundated ground surface areas and wetland vegetation.
A total of three surveys were conducted within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the survey area
(see Figure 1). These include a survey by TAS, Inc. (TAS) for the USACE-VD, a survey by
Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. for the Environmental Protection Agency, and a survey
by HRA Gray & Pape for USACE-Galveston. The TAS and Horizon Environmental Services
surveys were conducted in 2003 and the HRA Gray & Pape survey was conducted in 2008. No
new cultural resources were identified as a result of these surveys.
While no previously identified archaeological sites or historic standing structures were
present within the survey area or within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the survey area, there were a
total of two shipwrecks identified within the waters adjacent to the survey area in a 2.3kilometer (2-mile) radius (Table 1). Both are designated as State Archaeological Landmarks.

As a result of the archaeological investigation, a total of 42 shovel tests were
excavated in within the survey area. An additional 28 shovel tests were attempted, but
standing water on the surface impeded the excavation of these shovel tests. All 42
successfully excavated shovel tests were negative for cultural resources. A total of ten auger
tests were placed within the survey area. None of these contained cultural material or
showed evidence of buried shell deposits. Additionally, the area was probed in 19 locations
with a fiberglass probe in order to determine if buried shell deposits were present. None of
the probes indicated that this material was present.
SUMMARY AND RECOMENDATIONS
This report presents the findings of an intensive pedestrian cultural resources survey
conducted on 41.42 hectares (102.36 acres) of property associated with the Rush
Development project in Galveston County, Texas. Initial investigation consisted of a
background literature and site file search to identify the presence of recorded sites in close
proximity to the current proposed project. No previously recorded sites or structures were
identified within a 1.6-kilometer (1 mile) study radius of the project area.
Previously recorded archaeological sites or historic structures were not identified
within the surveyed area. Field investigation consisted of pedestrian survey, shovel testing,
and mechanical deep testing within the project area. Subsurface investigation included the
excavation of a total of 42 shovel tests, ten auger tests, and 19 probes within the project APE.
The results of the intensive pedestrian survey indicate that no previously unidentified
cultural resources are located within the surveyed area and no newly identified
archaeological sites of historic structures were recorded. Neither auger testing nor probing
indicated that there was any evidence for buried shell deposits. Based on these results, HRA
Gray & Pape recommends no further work and that the project be allowed to proceed as
planned.
