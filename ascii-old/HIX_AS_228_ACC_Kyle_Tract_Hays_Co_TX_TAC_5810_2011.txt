Abstract

ABSTRACT
Hicks & Company archeologists completed a 100-percent intensive areal pedestrian survey for the
proposed Austin Community College (ACC) Kyle tract project northwest of the intersection of the Union
Pacific Railroad (UPRR) and Farm-to-Market (FM) 1626 immediately south of Kohlers Crossing in Hays
County, Texas. The survey was conducted for AMEC Geomatrix on behalf of ACC for Antiquities Code
of Texas (ACT) compliance. Investigations were coordinated with the Texas Historical Commission
(THC) under ACT Permit #5810. The proposed new campus location covers approximately 96 acres in
area, of which archeologists surveyed 100 percent on foot. Approximately 24 acres of the current project
area were previously surveyed on behalf of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) in 2004.
This portion of the project area was investigated through pedestrian inspection along with the remaining
72 acres of the current project area investigated through a combination of pedestrian inspection and
shovel testing (n=36). The survey area was found to be largely undeveloped, overgrown rangeland with
relatively shallow, dry clay loams. Site 41HY479, a light, likely historic artifact scatter and an associated
barn, was recorded during survey; however, following assessment by a Hicks & Company architectural
historian, both the artifact scatter and structure are determined ineligible for listing as a State
Archeological Landmark (SAL). Hicks & Company recommends that the proposed undertaking should
be allowed to proceed with no further cultural resource coordination. This survey followed a nocollection policy, and all artifacts were returned to their find location in the field. All project-generated
notes, forms, photographs and artifacts will be permanently curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory in Austin, Texas.

Management Summary

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
On behalf of AMEC Geomatrix for Austin Community College (ACC), Hicks & Company archeologists
conducted a 100âpercent intensive areal archeological survey of 96.1 acres of a proposed ACC campus
tract in eastern Hays County, Texas, northwest of the intersection of the Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR)
and Farm-to-Market (FM) 1626 immediately south of Kohlers Crossing (Figure 1). While exact design
plans are still in progress, it is assumed that planned construction of the new educational campus will
incorporate various facilities, including buildings, parking lots, and both above- and below-ground
utilities and infrastructure.
Investigations were conducted under ACT Permit #5810 in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) guidelines for intensive areal surveys. Investigations involved pedestrian survey
supplemented by shovel testing to identify and evaluate the horizontal and vertical extent of potential
archeological deposits within the proposed project area. Archeologists surveyed 100 percent of the
proposed ACC Kyle tract on foot, including approximately 24 acres of land previously surveyed on behalf
of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) in 2004. A total of 36 shovel tests were conducted
within the project area that had not been previously surveyed (approximately 72 acres), conforming to
THCâs minimum standards of one shovel test per every two acres for projects between 11 and 100 acres
in area. The project area is largely overgrown rangeland with relatively shallow clay loams in the
southernmost portion of the project area; very dry, silty clay loams in the lowland area; and dry, silty clay
loams in the northern upland portion of the project area. Backhoe trenching was considered unnecessary
for these investigations since deep depositional soils have not been mapped in the project area. During
survey, archeologists recorded Site 41HY479, consisting of a light, likely historic artifact scatter and an
associated barn. In conjunction with archeological investigations, a Hicks & Company architectural
historian assessed the barn and determined it to be historically insignificant. Both the artifact scatter and
the associated barn are considered ineligible for listing as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL).
Since the project will take place on public land, it is subject to the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). The
project lacks federal permitting or funding, though, and is therefore not subject to coordination under the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended. This project was previously coordinated with
the THC, and an intensive archeological survey was recommended in their coordination response letter on
October 15, 2010 (letter, Wolfe to Cole [Appendix B]). Hicks & Company recommends that the
proposed undertaking should be allowed to proceed with no further cultural resource coordination. All
project-generated notes, forms, photographs, and artifacts will be curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas.
Fieldwork for the investigations occurred on November 23, 2010, and December 1, 2010, requiring
approximately 36 man-hours to complete. Report production immediately followed conclusion of
fieldwork. John Fulmer served as Principal Investigator for the project, and Samantha Walden Champion
served as Project Archeologist. Joshua Haefner, Samantha Walden Champion, and Gregg Cestaro
conducted the survey, while Emily Freeman Reed served as architectural historian. David Fowler is
credited for the Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping. Samantha Walden Champion, Josh
Haefner, and Emily Freeman Reed authored the report. Subsequent sections of this report include
environmental and cultural backgrounds with a brief discussion of previous surveys and recorded sites, a
description of field methodology, and a discussion of the results of field investigations. This is followed
by a detailed description of the formal regulatory recommendations. This report is offered in partial
fulfillment of ACT Permit #5810.

Environmental Setting

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Geology and Soils
According to the Geological Atlas of Texas (GAT), the property is underlain by Austin chalk and
fluviatile terrace deposits (BEG 1974). Austin Chalk is comprised of chalk and marl with a depth of 325
to 420 feet. The chalk is mostly microgranular calcite with approximately 85 percent calcium carbonate.
It is ledge-forming, alternating with marl, and is grayish white to white in color. The marl is medium
gray and weathers to limonite. The fluvative terrace deposits mapped at the proposed project location are
high gravel deposits composed of an upper silty clay unit functional for crop production along with a
lower coarse unit yielding some water. Area topography is generally sloping toward Bunton Branch,
located approximately 450 meters to the east of the project area.
Soils mapped within the proposed project area include Austin-Catephen complex, one to three percent
slopes (52 percent of project area) and two to five percent slopes (28 percent of project area). The AustinCastephen complex is described as ridge-forming, well-drained, silty clay loam reaching depths of 18
inches before terminating at bedrock. Houston Black clay, one to three percent slopes, is found in
approximately 20 percent of the project area and is made up of clay formed from well-drained residuum
weathered Austin Chalk formation, reaching a depth of approximately 50 inches before terminating at
bedrock. Compared with the Austin-Castephen complex, the lower level of erosion and deeper sediment
of the Houston Black clay series provides a better environment for preservation of archeological deposits.

Flora and Fauna
The project area is located along an ecotonal crescent at the interface of the Blackland Prairies and the
Edwards Plateau Ecological Regions of Texas (Figure 2). The Blackland Prairies Ecological Region
encompasses approximately 11.5 million acres of nearly-level to rolling prairies and grasslands
interspersed with dense woodlands. The Edwards Plateau Ecological Region is an uplifted and elevated
region now categorized as brushland after continual overgrazing that encompasses nearly 24 million acres
throughout Central Texas (TPWD 2010).
The project area includes small wooded areas, mixed grassland, and farmland. Vegetation other than
cropland that would be expected in the area according to mapping conducted by the Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department (McMahan et al. 1984) would include little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium),
sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula), Texas grama (Bouteloua rigidiseta), three-awn (Aristida spp.),
hairy grama (Bouteloua hirsuta), tall dropseed (Sporobolus asper), buffalograss (Buchloe dactyloides),
windmillgrass (Chloris spp.), tumblegrass (Schedonnardus paniculatus), western ragweed (Ambrosia
psilostachya), broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae), Texas bluebonnet (Lupinus texensis), live oak
(Quercus virginiana), post oak (Quercus stellata), and mesquite.
A high diversity of fish and wildlife is known to exist in Central Texas and Hays County. According to
county records maintained by Texas A&M University (2009), amphibians and reptiles are represented by
five species of salamanders, 21 species of frogs and toads, eight species of turtles, eleven different kinds
of skinks and lizards, 27 different snakes and the American alligator. Texas Tech University (2008) has
documented at least 60 species of mammals in this region, while 471 bird species have been documented
within the oaks and prairies region that includes Hays County (TPWD 2003).
Commonly occurring mammal species that would be expected in the project area include but are not
limited to: coyote (Canis latrans), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), bobcat (Lynx rufus), Virginia
opossum (Didelphis virginiana), fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus),

eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), and raccoon (Procyon lotor). Common reptile species include
the green anole (Anolis carolinensis), Mediterranean gecko (Hemidactylus turcicus), collared lizard
(Crotaphytus collaris), checkered garter snake (Thamnophis marcianus), and water snake (Nerodia
erythrogaster). Frequent bird species would include northern mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos), northern
cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata), house sparrow (Passer domesticus),
house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus), white-winged dove (Zenaida asiatica), mourning dove (Zenaida
macroura), American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), redshouldered hawk (Buteo lineatus), Cooperâs hawk (Accipiter cooperii), great horned owl (Bubo
virginianus), gray phase of the eastern screech owl (Otus asio), barred owl (Strix varia), common grackle
(Quiscalus quiscula), great-tailed grackle (Quiscalus mexicanus), turkey vulture (Cathartes aura), and
black vulture (Coragyps atratus).
The climate of the area is considered humid subtropical, characterized by hot summers and cool winters
with an average high temperature in July of 96 degrees Fahrenheit and an average low temperature in
January of 38 degrees. Annual average precipitation is 81 centimeters (32 inches), with peak
precipitation in May and September. Summers are generally dry with occasional thunderstorms.

Hydrology
The property is located at the convergence of the Colorado River and Guadalupe River basins. Measured
in length and drainage area, the Colorado River is the largest river wholly in Texas. Its drainage area is
39,900 square miles, and its runoff reaches a volume of more than two million acre-feet near the Gulf
(Clay and Kleiner 2010). The Guadalupe River flows for approximately 230 miles from its convergence
at the North Fork and South Fork branches to its mouth at the San Antonio Bay. It has a drainage area of
approximately 6,070 square miles, with the Comal and San Marcos Rivers as its principal tributaries
(Smyn 2010). Stormwater runoff from this property flows into Bunton Branch, approximately 450 meters
east. Plum Creek, another intermittent drainage, runs to the southeast approximately 500 meters
southwest.

Land Use
The proposed project location encompasses 96.1 acres northwest of the intersection of the Union Pacific
Railroad (UPRR) and Farm-to-Market (FM) 1626, immediately south of Kohlers Crossing. North of the
FM 1626 bridge over the UPRR, the southern portion of the project area is composed of overgrown
rangeland of gravelly deposits with dry clay loams covered with one-meter-high grasses with intermittent
areas of exposed bedrock (Figures 3 and 4). Approximately 300 meters north of the southern project
boundary, soils are drier, silty clay loams with higher grasses as the landform slopes into a lowland area
(likely a dry pond). Though almost indistinguishable on aerial photography, this lowland area continues
for approximately 200 meters before slightly sloping upward, flattening into continued overgrown
rangeland (Figures 5). A faint two-track road used by land management personnel and surveyors is
located adjacent to the railroad right-of-way across the northâsouth extent of the project area (Figures 6
and 7). The northern portion of the project area consists of dry, fine clay loams covered with thicker,
medium to tall grasses. A barn associated with a farmstead complex 150 meters north (outside of the
project area) and modern trash and push piles were observed and documented during recording (Figures
8 and 9). Along the FM 1626 right-of-way, an area previously surveyed on behalf of TxDOT, grasses
were mowed and showed evidence of mechanical disturbance within the project area, likely attributed to
FM 1626 Extension construction (Figure 10).

Cultural Background

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
Archeological Background
The project area is located within the Central Texas Archeological Region (Figure 11). Most of the recent
chronologies for Central Texas are based on six distinct time periods, roughly representing a 12000 year
sequence of occupation. A synthesis of the culture-historical sequences provided by Collins (2004) and
Johnson (1995) is as follows: Paleoindian (prior to 8800 BP), Early Archaic (8800â5800 BP), Middle
Archaic (5800â4000 BP), Late Archaic (4000â1400 BP), Post-Archaic or Late Prehistoric (AD 600â
1600), and Historic (AD 1600 to present). Although these divisions represent convenient temporal
categories, they are also based in large part on perceived adaptations in subsistence and are reflected in
changes in lithic and other technologies.
Paleoindian (prior to 8800 BP)
The early Paleoindian culture in South and Central Texas is believed to be related to the well-known big
game hunting tradition of the Great Plains (Hester 1980). Most of the well-documented early Paleoindian
sites in Texas that are associated with extinct megafauna are located north and west of Central Texas on
the Llano Estacado and adjacent areas of the Southern High Plains. In general, early Paleoindian sites are
scarce in Central Texas, or at least less visible than later sites. Conversely, later Paleoindian sites are
much more numerous in South and Central Texas, although both are usually identified from only surfacecollected artifacts (Black and McGraw 1985). Subsistence data from several late Paleoindian sites does
suggest, however, that small game was exploited in addition to extinct megafauna. This data supports the
idea that a hunting and gathering lifestyle may have already been adopted across much of Southwest and
Central Texas prior to the Early Archaic period.
Paleoindian occupations in Central Texas have typically been associated with lanceolate projectile points
such as Clovis, Folsom, Plainview, Golondrina, and Meserve and stemmed points such as Scottsbluff
(Turner and Hester 1993). Recent investigations at the Wilson Leonard Site (41WM235) (Collins 2004)
equate three styles of projectiles, Golondrina/Barber, St. Maryâs Hall and Wilson, to the late Paleoindian
period. The Wilson component is dated at 10000 to 9650 BP and is associated with features, artifacts,
and a burial that are more Archaic-like in nature than Paleoindian (Collins 2004). The data from this site
further suggests that the Archaic nature of the adaptation continues during the ensuing Golondrina/Barber
and St. Maryâs Hall components. These are dated between 9500 and 8800 BP and may represent a
transitional period between the Paleoindian and the Archaic.
Early Archaic (ca. 8800â5800 BP)
The Early Archaic period is subdivided into three projectile point style intervals: Angostura, Early Split
Stem and Martindale/Uvalde, from 8800 to 6000 BP (Collins 2004). Generally, the shift from
Paleoindian to Archaic subsistence strategies is measured by a change in technology focused on the use of
burned rocks to process geophyte plant foods. This shift is traced back as early as 8800 BP at the WilsonLeonard Site and at roughly comparable ages at several other Central Texas sites (Decker et al. 1999;
Thoms et al. 1996). At these sites, evidence for the use of earth ovens and burned rock technologies for
processing plant foods is associated with lanceolate Angostura projectile points. Hence, the use of
Angostura and late Paleoindian lithic technologies may have continued on into the Early Archaic period
for a time but was gradually replaced by the bifurcate base split-stem and Martindale/Uvalde styles.

Cultural Background

The Early Archaic period marks a shift to the use of burned limestone and other rocks in the form of
scatters, hearths, middens and other features for the heated processing of plant foods. This represents the
start of a long-lived Archaic cooking tradition, lasting from roughly 8800 to 1400 BP. This tradition was
characterized by the repeated utilization of earth ovens and the resulting creation of burned rock middens
at strategic places on the landscape. These new subsistence practices began with a distinctive cooking
technology using layered arrangements of heated rocks in earth ovens, allowing for exploitation of a
broad range of geophytes. These included upland xerophytic plants like sotol and other species such as
Lily family onion bulbs, which grow in wetter environments (Decker et al. 1999).
Some of the most recent climatic reconstructions for the period posit a moist and cool late Pleistocene
environment with early to mid-Holocene shifts to drier conditions that became most pronounced during
the mid-Holocene (ca. 5000-7000 BP, Ricklis and Collins 1994). In contrast, Johnson (1995) suggests
that the relatively mesic conditions of the eastern Edwards Plateau during the Pleistocene and early
Holocene/Paleoindian period underwent a brief dry interval during Late Paleoindian times, later returning
to more mesic conditions during the ensuing Early Archaic period (roughly 8000-5800 BP). Whether the
Early Archaic climate reflects a gradual drying period (Ricklis and Collins 1994) or a more mesic interval
within an overall, long-lived trend toward aridity along the eastern Edwards Plateau, it appears that the
use of burned rock midden technologies for plant food and other types of subsistence related processing
began during this period and continued for many thousands of years.
Overall, the bulk of the Central Texas archeological literature suggests that the Early Archaic occupations
were generally small, widely distributed, and non-specialized (Black and McGraw 1985). Explanations
for these characteristics support a generalized hunting-gathering strategy involving relatively high group
mobility, poorly defined territories, and short-term occupations. Broad spectrum, well-adapted, highly
mobile subsistence strategies are theorized.
Middle Archaic (ca. 5800â4000 BP)
The Middle Archaic marks an intensification of the use of burned rock technologies to process plants and
other types of foods within an increasingly arid environment. Ricklis and Collins (1994) recognize a
pronounced mid-Holocene drying event from 7000 to 5000 BP, though it may have lasted longer.
Johnson (1995) posits the occurrence of a dry Edwards Interval along the eastern Edwards Plateau from
roughly 5500 to 1400 BP. Evidence for this is seen in the cessation of significant overbank sediment
aggradation at a number of Central Texas sites. Instead of deposition, arid conditions catalyzed extensive
downcutting and erosion along many Central Texas streams. Hypothetically, dry conditions would have
promoted the spread of desert succulent xerophytic plants and fostered the increased use of burned rock
middens. Drier conditions may also have engendered the return of bison to the plateau during the Middle
and Late Archaic periods. Furthermore, the proliferation of Bell/Andice/Calf Creek projectile point styles
at the beginning of the Middle Archaic may have coincided with the return of bison to the Edwards
Plateau and the adjacent Blackland Prairie; these broad bladed points have been associated with the
exploitation of bison within archeological literature. Additional Middle Archaic projectile point styles
include Early Triangular, La Jita, Nolan and Travis.
Late Archaic (ca 4000â1400 BP)
Recent refinements in the Central Texas chronology divide the Late Archaic interval into two different
subperiods (Johnson 1995). Subperiod I is marked by the appearance of Bulverde projectile points, which
along with later forms (Pedernales, Castroville, Marshall and Montell) were used to hunt bison and other
large game. Burned rock middens continued to proliferate during the Late Archaic I interval. The
resources processed via burned rock technology may have included yucca, sotol, and perhaps agave
lechuguilla. Other middens may simply be dumps for kitchen-type debris, which contain sizeable

10

Cultural Background

quantities of animal bones, broken stone tools, and flint-knapping detritus (Johnson 1995). Pedernales
peoples in particular may have been adept at both hunting and the processing of large volumes of plant
food materials.
The Late Archaic II interval (ca. 600 BC-AD 600) may have been a time of increasingly mesic conditions
for all but the western and southwestern portions of the Edwards Plateau (Johnson 1995). The onset of
more mesic conditions may have resulted in decreased numbers of upland xerophytic plants and perhaps
bison (Johnson 1995), which may have forced adjustments in prehistoric subsistence strategies. There
appears to be a decrease in the number of burned rock middens that can be directly attributable to the Late
Archaic II interval. The projectile points used at this time are smaller and are characterized by such styles
as Ensor, Fairland, Frio and Darl. Evidence suggests the large projectiles well-adapted to bison hunting
may have been gradually replaced. Also, it has been posited that the spread of Eastern Woodland
religious cults may have had an influence on the Late Archaic II peoples of Central Texas (Johnson
1995).
Late Prehistoric (ca. AD 600â1600)
The Late Prehistoric or Post-Archaic (ca. AD 600-1600) (Johnson 1995) in Central Texas is initially
marked by the replacement of the dart and atlatl with the bow and arrow, as reflected in the shift from dart
points to smaller, thinner and lighter arrow points (Ricklis and Collins 1994). Despite the shift to the bow
and arrow, there is strong indication that the broad based hunting-gathering economy of the Late Archaic
persisted into and throughout most of the Late Prehistoric period. The latter part of this period is marked
by the appearance of pottery and a distinctive complex of tools composed of contracting-stem Perdiz
arrow points, an abundance of unifacial end scrapers, thin, alternately beveled bifacial knives, and drills
or perforators made of flakes and blades. The Post-Archaic era again turned dry and somewhat arid
toward the middle of the Late Prehistoric, during which a dramatic increase in bison exploitation suggests
it became an increasingly important economic activity during the later part of this period.
Historic Period (AD 1528âPresent)
The most radical changes in the Native American history of Central Texas came during the historic era
(Black 1989). The horse was introduced into North America by Spanish settlers in the sixteenth century;
nomadic groups, initially the Apaches and later the Comanches, adopted the horse and rapidly altered the
aboriginal situation of Central Texas. These nomadic groups entered Central Texas from the plains and
mountains to the north and west and within 150 years had forced most of the native peoples to flee. Most
groups were destroyed by the combined effects of the nomadic raiders and the foreign diseases introduced
by Europeans. Others moved south, entering Spanish missions and settlements, or eastward to join
various agricultural groups such as the Wichita (Black 1989).
The historic period in Texas begins with the arrival of Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca and other survivors
of the Navarez expedition on the Texas coast in 1528, although there may have been earlier landings
(Cecil and Greene 2001). In any case, the influences of European colonization were not felt strongly in
Texas until several centuries later. By the middle of the eighteenth century, though, the Spanish had
established missions in East Texas and settlements in South Texas. This resulted in massive depopulation
and cultural disintegration among Native American groups.
The majority of historic period archeological sites in the vicinity are historic farmsteads relating to the
settlement and agriculture of the area, which was founded in the 1850s but whose major period of
settlement occurred after the Houston and Central Texas Railway was built in 1871 (Smyn 1996). Not
surprisingly, these historic sites appear to conform to the general dispersion pattern observed by Clark
(2004), where settlement in the Blackland Prairies during the nineteenth century tended to cluster along

Cultural Background

roads and other transportation arteries. Farmsteads were typically located near a reliable water source, and
houses were situated on hills overlooking creeks or springs.
The city of Kyle was established in 1880, when Fergus Kyle (for whom the town was named) and the
family of David Moore donated 200 acres of land for a town site beside the newly-arived International
and Great Northern Railroad line. Kyle grew quickly with the railroad, and by 1882, the population
exceeded 500 people (Strom 2010).

Previously Recorded Sites and Investigations

PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES AND INVESTIGATIONS
A background review of the project area utilized the Texas Historical Commissionâs (THC) Online
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) to determine if there are any previously recorded archeological sites or
previously conducted surveys within the project area. In addition, the review identified any archeological
sites within 500 meters of the project area.
One site was recorded directly west of the proposed project area, with no other sites recorded within the
project area or within 500-meter buffer. Site 41HY382 was recorded by Paul Price and Associates in July
2004 (Plate 1 [Appendix A]). The site is described as a historic surface scatter from the mid-twentieth
century consisting of pane glass, whiteware, stoneware, and an above-ground cement water trough.
Artifacts were mainly recovered from the surface, with only one fragment of pane glass collected from a
shovel test at three centimeters. The site encompasses an area of 2700 meters-squared and may represent
a historic trash dump. Site 41HY382 was described as having poor research value and was not
recommended for further work; however, it was recorded that the site could extend beyond the FM 1626
right-of-way.
The survey during which Site 41HY382 was recorded was conducted on behalf of TxDOT by Paul Price
and Associates in July 2004 for the FM 1626 Expansion project. The previously surveyed area overlaps
the westernmost boundary for this project, encompassing approximately 24 acres within the current
project area.

Methodology

METHODOLOGY
The field methodology implemented during the archeological survey of the proposed project area is
described below.
Hicks & Company archeologists conducted a 100-percent intensive pedestrian survey of the project area
following the THC minimum survey standards for projects of less than 200 acres in size. Shovel tests
were conducted at a rate of approximately one every two acres or as necessary, depending on surface
visibility and level of disturbance. Generally, soils were relatively shallow and moderately disturbed, both
naturally and artificially. In some portions of the project area, soils were nonexistent with exposed
bedrock visible at the surface. All shovel tests were terminated at a maximum depth of 100 centimeters
below ground surface unless pre-Holocene deposits, bedrock, or extremely dense clays were encountered.
All excavated soil from shovel tests was screened through quarter-inch wire mesh or hand-sorted where
clays could not be screened. Each shovel test was recorded in ten-centimeter levels on standardized forms
and its location plotted using a GPS. Once test data were recorded, all shovel tests were backfilled. The
entirety of the project area, including portions previously surveyed on behalf of TxDOT in 2004, were
investigated on foot and documented through notes and photographs.
Investigators used handheld GPS units and detailed maps to locate and record excavations within the
proposed project area. GPS positions were recorded for all shovel tests. All GPS positions were
downloaded and plotted on 7.5 minute USGS topographic maps and aerial photographs by Hicks &
Company Geographic Information Systems (GIS) personnel.

RESULTS OF FIELD INVESTIGATIONS
Pedestrian Survey and Shovel Test Summary
Archeologists performed a 100-percent intensive pedestrian survey supplemented by shovel testing of the
entire unsurveyed portion of the project area (Table 2 [Appendix A]). Approximately 24 acres of the
project area along the western boundary at FM 1626 was previously surveyed on behalf of TxDOT;
therefore, this area was surveyed through pedestrian means alone, with the exception of three shovel tests
(SC1, GC1, and JH1) located just inside the previous survey boundary at the southernmost extent of the
current project area. Disturbance along the previously surveyed portion of the project area was high,
likely attributed to construction during the FM 1626 Expansion project in 2004. The remaining project
area was surveyed through a combination of pedestrian transects and shovel tests. A total of 36 shovel
tests were excavated during the current field investigations, five of which were positive for cultural
materials.
Archeologists began investigations at the southernmost corner of the project area just north of the FM
1626 bridge over the UPRR tracks (Figure 3). Transects in this area were performed from south to north
approximately 30 to 50 meters apart. This portion of the project area, extending from the FM 1626 bridge
northward to slightly higher, more level ground, consists of dry, gravelly loam with varying surface
visibility. Where soils exist, thick, tall (up two meters) grasses dominate with intermittent scrub. Other
portions of this area are characterized by bedrock cobbles and gravels at the surface. A total of 23 shovel
tests (SC1âSC6, SC12, JH1âJH7, JH 12, GC1âGC6, and GC8âGC9) were conducted within the
overgrown, slightly lowland portion of the project area (Figure 12). Soils observed in these shovel tests
were predominantly very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2), dry, gravelly clay loam with occasional snail
shells, limestone and sandstone pebbles, and pieces of fragmented bedrock. On average, shovel tests
reached depths of 30 to 40 centimeters, terminating within sterile clays or at fragmented bedrock.
The northern extent of the project area abutting Kohlers Crossing consists of slightly shorter but thicker
grasses and prickly pear cactus and intermittent scrub atop shallow soils with interspersed cases of
exposed bedrock (Figure 13). A total of 13 shovel tests (SC7âSC11, SC13, JH8âJH11, JH 13âJH14, and
GC 7) were conducted within this portion of the project area, five of which (SC10âSC11, JH8, JH10, and
JH14) tested positive for cultural materials within the boundaries of Site 41HY479 (see Site 41HY479
discussion, below). Soils within this portion of the project area generally reached a depth of up to 35
centimeters, terminating at thick, impenetrable clay or fragmented bedrock. Soils within these shovel tests
were documented as dark grayish brown (10YR4/2) to dark yellowish brown (10YR4/3 to 10YR4/4) dry
clay loam with increasing clay content toward termination.

Results of Field Investigations

Site 41HY479
Site 41HY479 was recorded in the north-central portion of the project area and includes a barn structure
likely associated with a farmstead complex approximately 150 meters north, outside of the current project
area. The site is located approximately 50 meters south of Kohlers Crossing, 200 meters east of its
intersection with FM 1626, with the UPRR at a distance of 300 meters to the east. The site is located on a
slight rise above a lowland area to the south-southeast. The area is covered with thick grasses and prickly
pear, with intermittent scrub concentrated to the south (Figure 14). The area appears to have previously
served as rangeland or pasture, though the vegetation within and surrounding the site is largely
overgrown. A two-track road leads to the barn from the north (toward the complex outside of the project
area) and continues southeast, fading out before reaching the railroad tracks approximately 300 meters to
the east.
The site measures approximately 80 meters north-south by 150 meters east-west. An open concrete
reservoir measuring approximately two meters in diameter, presumably used for holding water, is located
just east of the barn (Figure 15). Beyond the barn and concrete structure, Site 41HY479 contains no other
cultural features and solely consists of a light scatter of likely historic artifacts, including four to five
whiteware fragments, three shards of glass (cobalt, light pink, and tan in color), and three to four pieces of
corroded miscellaneous metal (Figure 16). Artifacts were generally located within shovel tests to a
maximum depth of ten centimeters below the surface (cmbs).
A total of eight shovel tests were conducted within the site area; the results for each shovel test conducted
within the site area are shown in Table 1, below. Shovel testing within the site boundaries revealed soils
were generally dark yellowish brown, dry clay loams. Shovel tests were relatively shallow, reaching an
average depth of 30 cmbs before terminating at fragmented bedrock or impenetrable clay. The soils
within the site appeared to be moderately disturbed by general activity associated with the barn, including
a nearby two-track road and a burn pile located approximately ten meters east of the site.

Overall, the artifacts associated with Site 41HY479 are not considered archeologically significant.
Though the artifact scatter is typical of historic-aged sites, an exact date for the artifacts is unclear.
Comparatively, previously recorded Site 41HY382, located approximately 300 meters to the southwest, is
described as a historic artifact scatter with an associated cement water trough. The site was also shallowly
buried with a maximum depth of three centimeters, with artifacts including pane glass, whiteware, and
stoneware fragments. The site was recorded as a possible historic trash dump having low research
potential and was not considered eligible for listing as an SAL. Though a paucity of artifacts between
Sites 41HY382 and 41HY479 suggest they are not components of the same site, the similar nature of the
sites is evident and suggests that the sites could be part of a larger distribution of artifacts associated with
historic activity throughout the area. As with Site 41HY382, the artifacts associated with Site 41HY479
are considered ineligible for listing as an SAL; however, the barn within the site was assessed by an
architectural historian to determine if the structure is historically significant. The results of this evaluation
are outlined below.
Property Area History
The ACC Kyle tract is located in Hays County, identified by the Hays County Appraisal District as
Property ID R16180. The parcel is part of the Henry Lollar Survey, and is currently owned by Mountain
Plum, Limited.
Historic Structures Evaluation
The only standing structure in the project area is a barn, located approximately 50 meters south of Kohlers
Crossing. The barn measures approximately 40 meters long by 10 meters wide and has an enclosed room

on either end, with a center bay that has a dirt floor and is open on the south side (Figures 17â19). The
single-story barn features a side-gabled roof with exposed rafter tails covered in corrugated metal. The
sides of the exterior are clad in vertical wood board and batten siding, painted red. The wood is milled
lumber, with the exception of the support posts in the center bay, which appear to be cedar trunks.

The rooms on the east and west ends of the structure were not accessible during the field investigation,
but an opening in the wall revealed that various wire and fencing equipment are stored in the room on the
east. The central bay, closed on three sides and open to the south, is divided into two sections
(Figure 20). On the west, there is a section which has been enclosed in barbed wire and has hay on the
ground.

Results of Field Investigations

The barn is in relatively good condition, though siding sections are missing or deteriorated in some areas
(Figure 21). The Hays County Central Appraisal District does not have information on the date the
structure was built, but it is likely associated with the complex located across Kohlers Crossing to the
north (Figure 22). Some of the barns in this complex have a very similar style to the barn located in the
project area. According to the Hays County Central Appraisal District, the house in the complex north of
the project area was constructed in the early twentieth century. Based on field observation, Hicks &
Company architectural historians estimate that the structure in the project area was likely built in the midto late-twentieth century. Though the condition of the materials suggests that it may be of more modern
vintage, the barn was treated as a historic-age structure for the purpose of this analysis.
Evaluation and Summary
To be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), properties must be at least 50 years
old (except in cases of unusual significance), and establish both significance and integrity. To be
significant under Criterion A, agricultural properties âmust have had a direct involvement in the
significant events or activities by contributing to the area's economy, productivity, or identity as an
agricultural community,â and must also âcogently reflect the period of time in which the important events
took placeâ (NPS Preservation Bulletin 31). The barn does not clearly reflect association with significant
events or clearly reflect a period of significance. This structure is typical of the farmsteads constructed in
the area in the early to mid-twentieth century.
Integrity is a measure of how well a property reflects the âspatial organization, physical components, and
historic associations that it attained during the periods of significanceâ (NPS Preservation Bulletin 31).
The fact that the barn is separated from its original context (the farmstead located north of Kohlers
Crossing) has compromised several aspects of integrity, including setting. As such, though the barn may
be of historic age, it lacks integrity and also lacks significance in any of the four National Register
Criteria. The structure is not eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), which is a
prerequisite for State Archeological Landmark (SAL) designation.

Conclusions and Recommendations

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of AMEC Geomatrix for Austin Community College, Hicks & Company archeologists have
completed an areal 100-percent intensive pedestrian survey of approximately 96 acres. The survey
consisted of pedestrian inspection within portions of the project area previously surveyed (approximately
24 acres) along with a combination of pedestrian inspection and shovel testing (n=36) within the
remaining 72 acres of the project area. The survey area was found to be a mixture of largely overgrown,
open rangeland with disturbed dry, clay loam. During survey, one archeological site, Site 41HY479, was
recorded as a light, likely historic artifact scatter adjacent to an associated barn structure. The research
value of Site 41HY479 is very low, and the site is considered ineligible for listing as a State
Archeological Landmark (SAL). Furthermore, following evaluation by a Hicks & Company architectural
historian, it was concluded that the barn within Site 41HY479 is not historically significant and therefore
also ineligible for listing as an SAL. Based on the results of shovel testing and surface inspection of Site
41HY479 and the entirety of the project area, regulatory clearance for the project is recommended to
proceed with no further cultural resource coordination. In the unlikely event that cultural materials are
found during construction, all work in the area is recommended to cease until the THC can be contacted
and a professional archeologist can assess the finding and make recommendations for any future action
that may be required.
This report is offered in partial fulfillment of the requirements for ACT Permit #5810. All project-related
materials will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin, Texas.
