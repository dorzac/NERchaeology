ABSTRACT
On behalf of the City of Houston and the Memorial Park Conservancy, Gray & Pape, Inc. conducted
an intensive pedestrian survey of approximately 16.6 hectares (41 acres) for the proposed Eastern
Glades Phase 2 development project located in Memorial Park, a public park of the City of Houston,
Harris County, Texas. As the proposed project is located within property of the City of Houston, a
political subdivision of the state of Texas, and exceeds 2 hectares (5 acres) in area, the proposed
undertaking requires the completion of an archaeological survey and due consideration of identified
archaeological resources prior to project commencement, per the Antiquities Code of Texas. Fieldwork
and reporting for the survey were conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 7686, issued to
Gray & Pape by the Texas Historical Commission (Archeology Division) on June 17, 2016. The goals
of the intensive pedestrian survey were to assist the Memorial Park Conservancy in assessing the
proposed project’s Area of Potential Effects for the presence of cultural resources as they are defined by
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (36 CFR 800), and provide
management recommendations for identified resources. Gray & Pape, Inc. focused particular attention
on the State Antiquities Landmark-designated Camp Logan archaeological site (41HR614), which is
intersected by the project area. Survey, site identification and delineation, and reporting were completed
with reference to standards established by the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission,
the Council of Texas Archeologists, and the National Historic Preservation Act.
Background research for the project was conducted in May 2016 and fieldwork was completed in July
and October 2016. Fieldwork encompassed the entire project area and involved pedestrian
reconnaissance, subsurface investigation through shovel testing, and photographic documentation of
existing conditions. Gray & Pape, Inc. focused attention on areas likely to contain surface and subsurface
materials and deposits associated with Camp Logan. In particular, Camp Logan-period cartographic
resources and narrative reports dating to 1918 and historic aerial imagery dating to the mid-1940s
were consulted in planning and completing fieldwork.
The proposed project includes five separate areas (designated by Gray & Pape, Inc. as survey areas A
through E for fieldwork) clustered together in the southeastern section of Memorial Park. Pedestrian
reconnaissance identified a low-density surface brick scatter near Area A and four in situ pre-cast
concrete park benches located in Areas A and B. Pedestrian reconnaissance also identified traces of
former roadways likely associated with Camp Logan that could be identified through patterns in tree
growth and understory vegetation. Subsurface investigation involved the completion of a total of 61
shovel tests across all five survey areas, including five shovel tests completed within the mapped surface
brick scatter. Of these 61 shovel tests, three shovel tests yielded historic archaeological material (ferrous
wire nail fragments in all three shovel tests) that may date in manufacture greater than 50 years before
present; no other shovel tests yielded prehistoric or historic period archaeological materials pre-dating
the mid-1960s.
Based on the results of the survey, Gray & Pape, Inc. recommends no further archaeological
investigations with respect to the current design of the Memorial Park Eastern Glades Phase 2 project.
The current plans for the project take into consideration the most distinct and visible of the roadways
dating to the Camp Logan period. Gray & Pape, Inc. does recommend the adoption of an Unanticipated
Discoveries Plan and Workforce Education Plan by the Memorial Park Conservancy prior to the
commencement of construction to avoid adverse impacts to buried archaeological features and
materials associated with the Camp Logan archaeological site. Gray & Pape, Inc. submitted project
records to Texas Archeological Research Laboratoryi

1.0 INTRODUCTION
the THC (Archeology Division) on June 17,
2016.

On behalf of the City of Houston and the
Memorial Park Conservancy, Gray & Pape, Inc.
(Gray & Pape) conducted an intensive
pedestrian survey of approximately 16.6
hectares (41 acres) in July and October 2016
for the proposed Eastern Glades Phase 2
development project located in Memorial Park,
a public park of the City of Houston, Harris
County, Texas. The following report presents the
results of site file and background research,
survey methods, field results, and conclusions
and recommendations.

The project is located on the Houston
Heights, T.X. United States Geological Survey
(USGS) 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle
map in the City of Houston, Harris County,
Texas (United States Geological Survey [USGS]
1998; Figure 1-1). The proposed project
includes five, non-contiguous areas (designated
by Gray & Pape as survey areas A through E for
fieldwork organization) clustered together in the
southeastern section of Memorial Park, and
taken together constitute the project area and
direct APE investigated for the intensive
pedestrian survey.

1.1 Project Overview
The intensive pedestrian survey is intended to
assist the Memorial Park Conservancy in
assessing the proposed project’s Area of
Potential Effects (APE) for the presence of
cultural resources as they are defined by Section
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA) of 1966, as amended (36 CFR 800),
and provide management recommendations
for identified resources. Gray & Pape focused
attention on the State Antiquities Landmarkdesignated (#8200003264) Camp Logan
archaeological site (41HR614) that is
intersected by the project. Survey methods, site
identification and delineation, and reporting
were completed with reference to standards
established by the Archeology Division of the
Texas Historical Commission (THC), the
Council of Texas Archeologists, and the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA).

As currently proposed, the Eastern Glades
Phase 2 development project will entail the
installation of impervious hardscapes, such as
sidewalks, roadways, and parking areas, buried
utilities, restrooms and comfort stations,
signage, and tree and shrub plantings. These
features will require significant grading and
excavation of existing soils throughout the
project area (Appendix A).

1.2 Report Organization
The following report is organized into seven
chapters. Chapter 1.0 provides an overview of
the project and personnel and Chapter 2.0
presents an overview of the environmental
setting and geomorphology. Chapter 3.0
presents a discussion of the cultural context
associated with the project area. Chapter 4.0
presents the methods developed for this
investigation and the results of the intensive
pedestrian survey are presented in Chapter 5.0.
Chapter 6.0 presents a summary of the
investigation and recommendations based on
the results of the field survey. References cited in
the body of the report are provided in Chapter
7.0. Appendix A presents the project plans and
Hendrickson’s 1918 map is provided in
Appendix B with the project area.

As the proposed project is located within
property of the City of Houston, a political
subdivision of the state of Texas, the project
requires the completion of an archaeological
survey and due consideration of identified
archaeological resources prior to project
commencement, per the Texas State Antiquities
Code (1977). Fieldwork and reporting for the
survey were conducted under Texas Antiquities
Permit Number 7686, issued to Gray & Pape by

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT
Harris County area by alluvial or eolian factors,
or potentially, marshy environments.

2.1 Physiography and
Geomorphology

Topographic relief in the landscape of
Harris County is the result of down cutting of
sediments from fluvial action associated with the
many rivers, bayous, and creeks within and
around the region. Major drainages include the
Brazos River to the west, the Colorado River to
the north, and San Jacinto River to the east.
Several creeks and bayous that border or dissect
Harris County include Spring and Cypress
creeks to the north, Cedar Bayou to the east,
Buffalo Bayou in central Harris County, and
Clear Creek, Brays Bayou, and Keegans Bayou
to the south.

The Texas Coastal Plain makes up part of the
larger Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic
province, a low, level to gently sloping region
extending from Florida to Mexico. The Texas
Coastal Plain reaches as far north as the
Ouachita uplift in Oklahoma, and as far west
as the Balcones escarpment in central Texas.
The basic geomorphological characteristics of
the Texas coast and associated inland areas,
which includes Harris County, resulted from
depositional conditions influenced by the
combined action of sea level changes from
glacial advance in the northern regions of North
America, and subsequent down cutting and
variations in the sediment load capacity of the
region’s rivers. Locally, Harris County is
underlain by relatively recent sedimentary
bedrock and regolith as well as unconsolidated
sediments ranging in age from the Miocene to
Holocene (Abbott 2001; Van Siclen 1991).

2.3 Soils
The project area is mapped entirely within the
Bissonnet soils series. Bissonnet soils are very
deep, poorly drained loamy soils derived from
fluviomarine material of Pleistocene age. The
uppermost layer typically extends 11
centimeters (4 inches) below surface and consist
of a dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam. From
11 to 31 centimeters (4 to 12 inches) below the
surface there is a light brownish gray (10YR 6/2)
loam with increasing clay and oxidized ferrous
staining. This is underlain by a layer of gray
(10YR 6/1) clay loam extending to 94
centimeters (37 inches) beneath the surface.
This in turn is underlain by a gray (10YR 5/1)
silty clay loam at 94-122 centimeters (37-48
inches) that transitions into a greenish gray (10Y
7/1) clay and continues to a depth of 203
centimeters (80 inches) (Soil Survey Staff,
Natural Resources Conservation Service, United
States Department of Agriculture [SSS NRCS
USDA] 2016).

2.2 Surface Geology
Although older geologic units have been
identified in the region, units relevant to the
study of long-term human occupation in
modern-day Harris County include the
Beaumont Formation, generally believed to
predate human occupation in the region, and
the so-called “Deweyville” terraces, positioned
stratigraphically between the Beaumont and
Recent deposits (Abbott 2001; Barnes 1992;
Van Siclen 1991). These terraces are between
one hundred thousand and four thousand years
in age, and are characterized as consisting “of
up to three inset fluvial terraces… (distinguished
by the presence of) …large looping meander
scars…” indicative of watercourses capable of
fluvial action and discharge markedly greater
than that seen today (Abbot 2001;16).
Overlaying these deposits may be relatively
thick or thin Holocene deposits, laid down in the

2.4 Natural Environment
Flora and Fauna
Present-day Harris County is located near the
western edge of the Austroriparian biotic
4

rainfall, and relative humidity of the region, with
a climate that is usually characterized as humid,
subtropical. Winds trend from the southeast or
east, except during winter months when highpressure systems can bring in polar air from the
Great Plains. In recent years, the average high
temperature in the summer is 35 °Celsius (C)
(95 °Fahrenheit [F]) and the average high
temperature in the winter is 17 °C (63 °F), with
relative humidity in the summer often reaching
above 90 percent (National Centers for
Environmental Information [NCEI] 2010).
Rainfall in Harris County is generally even
throughout the year, with an average annual
accumulation of 126.4 centimeters (49.8
inches).

province, and is situated in the Upland Prairies
and Woods subregion of the Gulf Coast Prairies
and Marshes Region (Abbott 2001). Evidence
from pollen analysis in Central Texas suggests
that, at least during the Late Pleistocene, the
area may have been populated by vegetative
species that were tolerant of a cold weather
environment. Climactic fluctuations during the
Holocene would eventually result in a gradual
trend towards warmer weather, similar to that
seen today (Abbott 2001).
Late Pleistocene flora may have included
populations of spruce, poplar, maple, and pine
(Holloway 1997), in an oak woodland
environment that would eventually transition to
an oak savanna in the late Holocene (Abbott
2001). Fauna during this time would include
currently present species such as white-tailed
deer and various smaller game, as well as
bison, and, in localized areas, pronghorn sheep
and the American alligator (Abbott 2001).

2.5 Land Use
The project area is located entirely within
Memorial Park, a public park owned by the City
of
Houston
that
presently
encloses
approximately 590 hectares (1,460 acres). The
park is situated along the north bank of Buffalo
Bayou, with its northern and western edges
defined by Interstate 610. Along its eastern
boundary, Memorial Park is bordered by mixed
light
residential
and
commercial
neighborhoods, most notably the Crestwood
and Rice Military neighborhoods. Prior to its
development as a public park and the period of
Camp Logan (1917 to 1919), much of the area
encompassing Memorial Park was owned by
members of the Reinerman family, from 1835
to 1883. During their tenure, the area was
largely held as a “homestead” and was not
intensively developed. The City of Houston
created the park in 1924, purchasing the initial
property at near cost from Will Hogg, Mike
Hogg, and Henry Stude. It has since been
expanded significantly in size and amenities
(Memorial Park Conservancy 2016).

The
modern
vegetative
community
associated with this region consists of a diverse
collection of primarily deciduous trees and
undergrowth (Abbott 2001). Modern land
alteration activities, especially those associated
with agriculture, have resulted in the removal of
native plant species from the area. Identified
trees may include water oak, pecan, various
elms, cedar, oaks, sweetgum, and mulberry, to
name a few. Honeysuckle, dewberry, yaupon,
and blackberry are common, as are indiangrass
and bluegrasses (Abbott 2001).
The modern faunal community includes
mammals such as deer, squirrel, opossum,
raccoon, skunk and various small rodents,
numerous bird species, and reptiles including
the Texas rat snake, the western cottonmouth,
the kingsnake, and turtle species. Black bear
and bison were occasionally witnessed in the
recent past (Abbott 2001).

Climate
Harris County’s close proximity to the Gulf of
Mexico and latitude influences the temperature,

3.0 CULTURAL CONTEXT
Within this chronological context, the
earliest identified prehistoric sites in Harris
County can be found around Clear Lake, and
date to approximately 4,000 BCE placing them
in the latter part of the Early Archaic (Henson
2010). Unfortunately, it has proven difficult to
date many sites in the county. Those near the
coast are shell middens, which are difficult to
radiocarbon date accurately and are largely
Late Prehistoric in age (Ricklis 2004:201-202).
In addition, numerous shell middens were
destroyed by nineteenth century quarrying of
shell for use in construction (Henson 2013). The
evidence of inland human occupation is just as
fragmentary, particularly in the uplands where
archeological data are derived largely from
multicomponent sites with mixed deposits,
rather than stratified sites associated with river
valleys draining the county (Abbott 2001; Ricklis
2004:201-202).

3.1 Prehistoric Context
Researchers of the prehistory of Southeastern
Texas have used changes in projectile point
technologies and the introduction of ceramics
(or pottery) to characterize the chronology of the
region into six distinct archeological time
periods. In general, these include the
Paleoindian, Archaic (with Early, Middle, and
Late subdivisions), Ceramic, Late Prehistoric,
Protohistoric, and Historic Indian periods.
However, while archaeologists agree on the
general framework of cultural time periods
within the region, there is some disagreement
on the temporal boundaries of these periods.
For example, Patterson’s (1996) chronology
includes Early Paleoindian (10,000-8,000
Before Common Era [BCE]), Late Paleoindian
(8,000-5,000 BCE), Early Archaic (5,0003,000 BCE), Middle Archaic (3,000-1,500
BCE), Late Archaic (1,500 BCE-Common Era
[CE] 100), Early Ceramic (CE 100-CE 600),
Late Prehistoric (CE 600-1500), Protohistoric
(CE 1500-1700), and the Historic Indian (CE
1700-1800) periods.

3.2 Historical Context
Development of Harris County
Harris County was formed as Harrisburg County
on December 22, 1836. The county was
renamed Harris in December 1839 to honor
John Richardson Harris, an early pioneer who
had established Harrisburgh in 1826, the first
town site in the county. Harrisburgh was
established at the confluence of Buffalo Bayou
and Brays Bayou and by the 1830s had become
the major port of entry for the region and a
transportation hub. Roads ran northwest to the
Brazos communities of San Felipe and
Washington, east to the ferry landing that
crossed the San Jacinto, and west paralleling
Brays Bayou to the Oyster Creek Community
near present day Stafford in Fort Bend County
(Henson 2010).

In contrast, Ensor (1990) offers a Southeast
Texas chronology that includes Paleoindian
(10,000-8,000 BCE), Early Archaic (8,0005,000 BCE), Middle Archaic (5,000-1,000
BCE), Late Archaic (1,000 BCE-CE 400), Early
Ceramic (CE 400-CE 800), and Late Ceramic
(CE 800-CE 1750). Perttula’s (2004: Table
1.1) and Ricklis (2004:Figure 6.1.1) provide a
recent chronology for the Upper Texas Coast is
also applicable to the project area and includes
Early Paleoindian (10,000-8,000 BCE), Late
Paleoindian (8,000-6,000 BCE), Early Archaic
(6,000-4,000 BCE), Middle Archaic (4,0001,500 BCE), Late Archaic (1,500-200 BCE);
Tchula (200-0 BCE), Early Ceramic (CE 0-700),
Initial Late Prehistoric (CE 700-1250), Final
Late Prehistoric (CE 1250-1500), Protohistoric
(CE 1500-1700), and the Early Historic (CE
1700-1800) periods.

Under Mexican authority the area
surrounding Harrisburg (as it came to be spelled
by 1832) was known as the San Jacinto District.
The district stretched east from Lynchburg on the

6

and Texas Central Railway (1858), the Missouri,
Kansas and Texas Railroad (1890), and the
Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway
(1918). These lines met at what became known
as Eureka Junction, located 1.6 kilometers (1
mile) northwest of the APE, and became the
most active railroad depot for Camp Logan
(Aulbach et al. 2014:82-83).

San Jacinto River, west to the location of present
day Richmond, and from Clear Creek in the
south to Spring Creek in the north. Harrisburgh
County encompassed this same territory with the
addition of Galveston Island. The modern
boundaries of Harris County were established in
1838 (Henson 2010).
The lands that would become Harris County
comprised the southeastern border of Austin’s
Colony (McComb 1981). In July of 1824, 29
titles were granted to lands in future Harris
County, with an additional 23 grants made
between 1828 and 1833. These original grants
concentrated mainly on the watercourses of the
region. The early settlers in the region were
mostly whites from the southern United States
and slaves with African ancestry. In the 1840s,
large numbers of white German and French
immigrants settled in Harris County. The
Hispanic presence in the region was relatively
sparse prior to an influx of immigrants following
the Mexican Revolution (Henson 2010).

Camp Logan was one of 16 National
Guard training camps established by the War
Department after the United States entered
World War I in April 1917. Each camp was
constructed as quickly as possible and designed
to accommodate and train a division of soldiers
prior to deployment in Europe. A division
typically numbered up to 28,000 personnel and
consisted of two brigades of infantry, one
brigade of field artillery, one regiment of
engineers, three machine gun battalions, one
field signal battalion, and miscellaneous
support units (Thomas 2003).
Houston’s only World War I-era training
camp was named for Major General John A.
Logan, a Union Civil War officer and politician
from Illinois. In addition to serving in both the
United States House of Representatives and
Senate, Logan is credited with helping found the
Grand Army of the Republic (or G.A.R.), a
Union veterans’ organization, and helping
establish Memorial Day (initially known as
“Decoration Day”) as a national holiday (John
A. Logan Museum 2014).

History of the APE and its Immediate
Vicinity
In 1834, Johann Gerhard (John) Reinermann,
his wife, and two sons immigrated to Texas from
Germany. In 1835, he applied for a land grant
from Stephen F. Austin to settle “on Buffalo
Bayou near John Austin’s two leagues on N.
side of bayou” (Aulbach et al. 2014:79). In
1838, Reinermann’s land grant was confirmed
by the Republic of Texas government and issued
to John’s widow and heirs. The land remained
within the Reinermann family, largely intact until
the late nineteenth century. The Reinermann
homestead was located between present day
T.C. Jester Boulevard and North Shepherd
Drive, and north of the present Interstate 10
corridor, approximately 1.6 kilometers (1 mile)
northeast of the APE. An 1847 survey described
the Reinermann property as roughly divided
between pasture and arable land (Aulbach et al.
2014:81).

Land for the camp was leased from the
Hogg family and tree and brush clearing began
in July 1917 (Hazlewood 2010). Pressed by the
urgency to get units to Europe as quickly as
possible, emphasis was placed on speed.
Within 13 days the camps roads and bridges
were completed. Gravel was deemed too
expensive so the roads were paved in crushed
shell dredged from Galveston Bay and shipped
by rail. Bridges for crossing Buffalo Bayou and
smaller tributaries were constructed from timber
cut during the clearing of the site. Drainage for
the camp was a considerable dilemma and was
addressed by the construction of surface

Eventually three railroad lines passed
through the Reinermann Survey: The Houston

response, approximately 150 soldiers of the 3rd
Battalion set out towards downtown Houston.
Over the next several hours, 11 local residents
were killed, as well as four policemen. A fifth
officer later died of his wounds. In addition, four
soldiers died, two of whom were accidently
killed by fellow soldiers, perhaps mistaken for
police. After one of these incidents, the killing of
Captain Mattes, the march dispersed and most
of the men returned to the camp. The following
morning martial law was declared and the 3rd
Battalion was ordered to return to New Mexico.
In the three military trials that followed, 118
soldiers were indicted of serious crimes and 110
were found guilty. Of those found guilty, 19
were hanged and 63 were given life sentences.
The events of the riot helped delay the opening
of Camp Logan (Haynes 2010).

ditches. These ditches drained into nearby
Buffalo Bayou, which ran along the southern
edge of the camp. Initially, the disposal of
human waste was done in latrine pits, which
were occasionally emptied, and the waste
discharged into the City of Houston’s sewer
system through manholes. In the hot and humid
conditions around Houston this system of waste
and runoff water disposal created sanitary
problems. During the summer of 1918, a
covered culvert was completed to remove
hospital sewerage about a quarter mile away,
where it connected to the surface ditches in a
remote part of the camp.
By August 1917, over 1,300 buildings had
been completed. Photographs accompanying
the Camp Logan Completion Report depict
these buildings as simple one- or two-story
wood frame structures. Most were built on
raised pier masonry foundations except for the
latrine and shower buildings which rested on
poured concrete foundations (Rothrock 1918).
On August 18, 1917, the first troops arrived
from the Illinois National Guard and began
clearing and preparing additional ground for
unit camps (Aulbach et al. 2014).

At the end of August commanding officer
Major General George Bell informed the War
Department that Camp Logan was ready to
receive the main body of troops. Throughout
September and October soldiers of the Illinois
National Guard arrived in the camp and by the
end of October troop levels reached nearly 20,
000. On October 10, 1917, the Illinois
National Guard troops at Camp Logan were
reconstituted into the 33rd U.S. Infantry Division.
By the end of 1917, elements of the 78th Field
Artillery, 79th Field Artillery, and the 5th U.S.
Division brought Camp Logan to its peak
occupancy of 33,000 troops. In the spring of
1918, the 33rd U.S. Division began its
deployment to France and by that summer a
second wave of troops began to arrive for
training. However, with armistice on November
11, 1918, these units never completed training
and the War Department began a program of
demobilization and decommissioning the
training centers, including Camp Logan. Troop
numbers at Camp Logan had dropped to
11,000 in January 1919 and then to 5,000 in
February. By March there were just over 500
troops remaining and the camp was officially
closed March 20, 1919. Only a handful of
troops remained to complete the liquidation of
camp resources by May. With the exception of
the camp hospital, which was transferred to the

Completion of the camp was delayed by
events that came to be known as the “Camp
Logan Riot” or “Houston Riot of 1917.” With
construction of Camp Logan underway, the 3rd
Battalion of the all African-American 24th U.S.
Infantry Regiment was redeployed from New
Mexico to Houston to guard the camp. There
was immediate tension between the soldiers
and some of Houston’s white residents and the
Houston Police Department. On August 23,
1917, a member of the 24th U.S. Infantry was
arrested for interfering with police officers as
they attempted to arrest an African-American
woman. When a member of a military police
(MP) unit from the 3rd Battalion questioned a
Houston Police Department officer about the
arrest, the MP was assaulted, fired upon, and
taken into custody. At the 3rd Battalion camp,
east of Camp Logan, rumors began to spread
that the MP had been killed and that an armed
white mob was approaching the camp. In

with the large parade and drill ground in the
center of camp. The southernmost portions of
the APE overlap the 78th Field Artillery
regimental camp as wells as that of the 5th
Division Recruiting Battalion and the Hospital
and Ambulance Corps. The northeast portion of
the APE is in the vicinity of the Camp Logan Post
Office and a second, unlabeled, structure on
Hendrickson’s map. One possible identity for
the unknown structure is that of the camp
library. It is not labeled on Hendrickson’s map
but records maintained by the camp librarian,
Malcolm G. Wyer (1918), indicate that it was
located in the area of the Post Office.

United States Public Health Service, all other
buildings were razed or moved elsewhere
(Aulbach et al. 2014).
In addition to the camp completion report
produced by Captain Rothrock (1918), the
other primary source of information on the
organization of Camp Logan comes from a
map produced by Corporal Paul B.
Hendrickson (1918). On the map he notes with
an “X” the position of “the 14 ft square pyramid
tent” that he lived in for eight months while
serving at the camp. Corporal Hendrickson’s
map (Figure 3-1; see also Appendix B for the
full map) depicts the relative locations of rail
lines, roads, bridges, offices, and other
buildings throughout the camp. The map also
provides the location and layout of each
regimental camp at the time he composed the
map (Hendrickson 1918). The precision of the
period map with reference to recent aerial
imagery was deemed adequate for aiding in
relocating former camp structures with an
acceptable level of confidence.

Almost immediately after the closing of
Camp Logan, locals began calling for the land
to be set aside as a park in memory of the
soldiers who had been stationed there and
served during World War I. The most strident of
these advocates was Catherine Mary Emmott. In
1924, Will and Mike Hogg, along with Henry
Stude, purchased much of the property and then
sold it to the City of Houston at cost, allowing
for the formation of Memorial Park. Although
plans were drawn up as early as 1924, the
Great Depression delayed much of the work
until the Works Progress Administration put 500
men to work constructing the existing golf
course and other amenities.

The camp was laid out in a rough triangle
with the main camp entrance at the eastern
point near the current Washington Avenue. Six
regiments were arranged along its south side,
five regiments along the northeast side, and four
regiments along the western side. The Camp
Logan Division Headquarters, base hospital,
and other administrative buildings were
clustered at the eastern end of the camp where
Washington Avenue and Blossom Street
provided the primary entrances into the camp.
Each regimental camp follows roughly the same
layout: a line of officer’s quarters separated
from the rest of the camp by a road, across the
road were company buildings such as mess
halls, behind the company building the bulk of
the camp was set aside for rows of tents for
enlisted men, at the rear of camp were latrines
and shower buildings, finally beyond these were
corrals for regimental horses.
The APE overlaps with the southeastern
corner of the camp. Hendrickson’s map
indicates that the majority of the APE coincides

conducted in order to provide an understanding
of the development and history of the
immediately surrounding area of Memorial
Park, and to develop a regional context of the
area and discuss the significance of previously
identified
National
Register
properties,
particularly Camp Logan.

4.1 Site File and Literature
Review
Gray & Pape completed site file research and
literature review to identify previously recorded
archaeological
sites
and
previous
archaeological investigations within 1.6
kilometers (1 mile) of the project area. This work
was conducted by reviewing online data
available on the Texas Online Archeological
Sites Atlas. Historic maps and aerial imagery
available through Google Earth (2016),
National Environmental and Title Research
(NETR) Online (2016), and online cartographic
resources provided through the PerryCastañeda Library Map Collection of the
University of Texas at Austin (2016) and the
Portal to Texas History database, sponsored by
the University of North Texas (2016). In
particular, project goals included historic
research and cultural resources survey to
determine whether or not remains of historic
Camp Logan (Site 41HR614) are present within
the project’s APE; current information on the
Texas Sites Atlas suggest that the mapped
boundaries of this important archaeological site
(“Area 1” of the Camp Logan State Antiquities
Landmark) overlap with approximately half of
the proposed Memorial Park Eastern Glades
development area.

4.2 Field Methods
Gray & Pape implemented a survey strategy
focusing foremost on areas that were known to
contain previously recorded cultural resources.
In order to complete this task more efficiently
and accurately, Gray & Pape used a
georeferenced overlay of Corporal Paul B.
Hendrickson’s 1918 map of Camp Logan.
Historic maps and images, among other
resources, were used to provide a detailed
historic context used to guide the cultural
resources survey. Particularly useful was the
detailed history of Camp Logan prepared by
Louis Aulbach, Linda Gorski, and Robbie Morin
(2014). Finally, field observations and
conditions guided additional testing efforts
within the APE.

Intensive Pedestrian Survey
Survey of the project APE consisted of
pedestrian walkover and photo-documentation,
shovel testing, and a reconnaissance-level
metal detecting survey. A handheld Global
Positioning System (GPS) receiver capable of
sub-meter accuracy data recording was used to
assist in survey. Portions of the APE were
subjected to both systematic and judgmental
excavation of shovel tests. Shovel test placement
was determined by making an assessment of the
archaeological potential across the tract and in
all cases met or exceeded the Texas Minimum
standards. Survey transects were placed
approximately 30 meters (100 feet) apart, while
shovel test excavations and visual observation
took place at 50-meter (160-foot) intervals.

As part of these investigations, Gray & Pape
identified previously identified cultural resources
and previous investigations mapped within a
background cultural review radius (see Table 1).
This work was used to provide a historic context
to the cultural resources survey, and additional
documentary research was conducted in order
to provide an understanding of the development
and history of the surrounding area. This
research then was used to prepare an overview
history of the area and provided an
understanding of the contextual framework of
Harris County’s prehistory and history.
Additional
documentary
research
was

11

Shovel testing consisted of 30 by 30centimeter (11 by 11-inch) diameter tests
excavated to a maximum depth of 100
centimeters (39.3 inches) into the underlying
substratum. Vertical control was maintained by
excavating each shovel test in 10-centimeter (4inch) levels. One wall of each shovel test was
profiled and the walls and floor of each shovel
test were inspected for color or texture change
potentially associated with the presence of
cultural features. When possible, soils were
screened through 0.64-centimeter (¼-inch)
wire mesh and descriptions of soil texture and
color followed standard terminology and
Munsell Soil Color Charts (Munsell 2005).
Additional information concerning soils
encountered was recorded on standardized
shovel test forms for each excavation.

however, Gray & Pape submitted project
records to Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL)-

Site Definition
The project area intersects the boundaries of the
previously-recorded Site 41HR614 (Camp
Logan), thus site definition was primarily
focused on the identification of architectural
and archaeological deposits based on Camp
Logan-period records (discussed previously in
Section 3.2.2, above) and the results of
previous investigations in adjacent areas of
Memorial Park. Subsurface testing, combined
with intensive pedestrian assessment, was
utilized as a supplemental method to test the
accuracy of this data as applied to the current
project. Gray & Pape consulted the 1918
Hendrickson map prior to completing the
intensive pedestrian survey, as the map suggests
that several structures, buildings, and roadways
associated with Camp Logan were formerly
located within the southern margins of Areas A,
C, and D (Figure 3-1).

4.3 Laboratory Analysis and
Curation
No diagnostic or non-diagnostic artifacts were
collected in the course of the current survey,
therefore there no discussion of laboratory
analysis and curation is included in this report.
As a project permitted through the THC,

located west of East Memorial Loop Drive, was
surveyed. Within area C-4 MAC recorded three
features: a pile of concrete rubble pushed into
a ravine, the extant remains of 26th Street, and
a manhole (Moore et al. 1989). MAC
conducted a second survey of Memorial Park in
2001, though this survey was focused on
determining the relative potential of different
areas of the park for producing prehistoric
cultural remains. In regards to the current APE,
Moore and Sanchez characterized the current
project area as possessing a low probability for
the presence of prehistoric materials and
deposits (Moore and Sanchez 2002). Also of
note, Gray & Pape recently performed a cultural
resources survey of a portion of the western
extent of the Camp Logan site within Memorial
Park that is currently in the reporting phase (see
Texas Antiquities Permit Number 7574).

5.1 Result of Site File and
Literature Review
Previously Recorded Surveys
Consultation with the Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas revealed that there were seven cultural
resource surveys previously conducted within a
1.6-kilometer (1-mile) buffer of the project area
(Table 5-1). Of these, two of the surveys overlap
with the project area. In 1989, Moore
Archeological Consulting, Inc. (MAC, Inc.)
conducted an extensive survey of Memorial
Park, including the project area. This survey
noted structural remains but did not include a
complete mapping of every foundation (Moore
et al. 1989). The portions of the 1989 MAC
survey that overlaps with the current APE were
designated areas C-4 and E-3. Only area C-4,

Survey Area A

Previously Recorded Cultural
Resources

Survey began on the eastern margin of the APE
in Area A, which borders Arnot Street to the
north and runs roughly parallel to Crestwood
Drive for a distance of approximately 600
meters (1,970 feet) (Figure 5-1). Area A
subsumes an overall area of approximately 3.7
hectares (9.1 acres), oriented north-to-south.
The environmental setting observed within Area
A was predominantly low density mature pines
interspersed with dense secondary growth and
grasses, as well as tree and undergrowth debris
from ground maintenance activities (Figure 52).

The project APE is incorporated within the site
boundaries of Camp Logan (41HR614).
Furthermore, there are two additional sites
within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) radius of the
APE. The first (41HR1158) is a shell midden of
unknown age, approximately 800 meters
(2,600 feet) south of the APE, on the south bank
of Buffalo Bayou. At the time of recording it had
been heavily damaged by the construction of
the River Oaks Golf Course (Beene 2015). The
second is the Willowick Site (41HR791), a small
prehistoric lithic site, approximately 1 kilometer
(0.6 miles) south of the APE. Only two chert
flakes were recovered (Huebner and Moore
1989). No additional work was recommended
for either site.

A total of 16 shovel tests were excavated
across Area A, including five delineation tests
excavated within a small brick scatter (less than
four brick fragments were identified on the
surface) immediately west of the APE boundary.
The scatter was composed of incomplete glazed
architectural brick, with one brick fragment
featuring the intact maker’s mark [“HOUST…”]
on a bed face of the fragment (Figure 5-3).
Delineation of the brick scatter was completed
to characterize the horizontal extents and depth
of the scatter. One shovel test was placed in the
approximate center of the scatter (as visible on
the surrounding ground surface) and was
recorded as the only positive, while an
additional four shovel tests were placed in
cardinal compass directions, 10 meters (33
feet) from the brick scatter. The positive
delineation test (Shovel Test J1) yielded a total
of 11 corroded ferrous wire nail fragments
between the ground surface and 30 centimeters
(12 inches) below surface (Figure 5-4). The nail
fragments were recovered in Stratum I, in dark
grayish brown (10YR 4/2) compact sandy loam,
and Stratum II, consisting of pale brown (10YR
6/3) compact silty loam. Research of the
“HOUST…”-marked
architectural
brick
suggests that the brick was manufactured by the
Houston Brick & Tile Company, located in
Houston, Texas and operated as early as 1894,
remaining in operation through at least 1985
(Galveston
Daily
News
1894;

One National Register District and four
National Register Properties are located within
the 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) research area of the
APE. These include: Bayou Bend National
Register District, Hugo V. Neuhaus, Jr. House
National Register Property, William L. Clayton
Summer House National Register Property, and
Cleveland Harding Sewall House National
Register Property. The Hugo Victor Neuhaus, Jr.
House is also the location of a Texas State
Historical Marker.

5.2 Results of Field
Investigations
For fieldwork, the APE was organized into five
areas based on the proposed development
layout, corresponding to Areas A through D for
the original four survey areas, and Area E
representing the survey of a proposed access
road for the nearby Memorial Park golf course.
In total, 61 shovel tests were completed
throughout the project area (Figure 5-1). A total
of three shovel tests yielded non-recent
(modern) historic-period cultural material, one
near Area A and two within Area C; no
prehistoric cultural material was identified in any
shovel test.

along this alignment.

Houston Chronicle 1985). No additional
cultural materials were recovered near the brick
scatter and no soil features were identified in the
five shovel tests. Three intact, precast concrete
park benches were also documented in Area A.
Two of the park benches were identified at the
northern end of Area A, while the third was
identified immediately south of Shovel Test A6.
The park benches likely date to an earlier period
of Memorial Park and have not been regularly
used in the recent past; no other extant park
features or structures were identified in
association with the benches, such as lighting
fixtures or water fountains.

Survey Area B
Area B lies approximately 75 meters (246 feet)
west of Area A, and subsumes a small space of
1 hectare (2.5 acres) (Figure 5-1). The
environmental setting observed in Area B was
consistent with Area A. Four shovel tests were
excavated within Area B along two transects,
none of which contained archaeological
material. An additional precast concrete park
bench was identified immediately south of Area
B, near the approximate path of the primary
east-to-west camp roadway (Figure 5-5).

Field survey of Area A also visually identified
the trace of an historic roadway in the low
density of tree and understory growth along an
east-west linear alignment (see Figure 5-1).
Shovel testing in this area did not identify any
historic roadway surfaces (such as crushed
oyster shell, gravel, or asphalt) but the lack of
dense vegetation approximately matches the
alignment of a former roadway as depicted in
the 1918 Hendrickson map of Camp Logan

Survey Area C
Area C is situated approximately 30 meters (98
feet) to the south of Area B and 75 meters (246
feet) to the west of Area A. It encompasses 2.7
hectares (6.7 acres) directly east of the
intersection of East Memorial Loop Drive and
Memorial Drive. Area C contains an

environment consistent with Areas A and B,
though the western boundary is impacted by
park development, including manicured lawn
and running paths (Figure 5-1). Survey of Area
C included seven shovel tests arranged along
three transects. Shovel Test C7 was recorded as
positive and contained a total of seven corroded
ferrous wire nail fragments. These materials
were recovered from a depth ranging between
30 to 50 centimeters (12 to 20 inches) below
surface, in very compact light yellowish brown
(10YR 6/4) silty loam. Indications of
disturbance, such as common ferrous staining
and concretions, were evident throughout the
test, which was located on the boundary
between undeveloped brush and woods and the
manicured park lawn and running path along
East Memorial Loop Drive (Figure 5-6). Four
delineation tests were excavated in close
proximity (10 meters [33 feet]) to Shovel Test
C7, with Shovel Test C7-South containing two
additional ferrous wire nail fragments within the

Survey Area D
Area D encompasses approximately 9 hectares
(22 acres) of undeveloped wooded area,
oriented north-to-south immediately to the west
of East Memorial Loop Drive (Figure 5-1). This
more central portion of Memorial Park features
mature pine growth with dense underbrush and
several areas of minor ground depressions and
hollows that were generally inundated at the
time of the survey. The northeast corner of the
APE is notably lower in overall elevation and
was not subjected to excavation due to
expansive inundation during the initial
mobilization. A total of 19 shovel tests were
excavated within Area D, while six were
recorded as unexcavated within the inundated
northeastern extent of the project area.

Figure 5-6. Overview of Area C, near positive Shovel Test C7. View is to the north.

Figure 5-7. Overview of proposed golf course access road. View is to the south.

11 shovel tests were completed along the
proposed access road alignment, none of which
yielded cultural material; one shovel test at the
southern end of the access road alignment was
not excavated due to large quantities of
discarded asphalt adjacent to and north of the
existing park maintenance road. In general,
excavation along the access road alignment
revealed a surface stratum of approximately 10
centimeters (4 inches) of very dark grayish
brown (10YR 3/2) sandy loam. Underlain by
grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy clay
throughout the soil profile of the access road
area, as observed in Shovel Test E6 (Figure 54). Small ferrous concretions were commonly
encountered in the clay-rich soils, as well as
both brown (10YR 5/3) and strong brown
(7.5YR 5/6) mottles. The lower limits of most
tests featured a noticeable amount of moisture.

Survey Area E (Golf Course Access
Road)
An additional mobilization was undertaken to
survey a proposed access road for the Memorial
Park Golf Course, located between East
Memorial Loop Drive and the eastern extent of
the golf course grounds (Survey Area E) (Figure
5-1). The proposed road is oriented generally
north to south along a 0.6 kilometers (0.4 miles)
alignment, approximately 10 meters (33 feet) in
width, beginning at East Memorial Loop Drive
and ending at an existing park maintenance
pathway to the south. The survey crew noted
disturbance in this specific area, in the form of
several refuse piles of discarded asphalt. To the
north, the APE traverses an environment
consisting of flat, maintained urban woods of
beech and pine (Figure 5-7). Excavation within
the APE for the proposed road was administered
along a single transect within a corridor of
approximately 3.5 meters (11.5 feet) in width.
Testing was initiated at the northern end of
the project area and continued along the
proposed path at an interval ranging between
40 and 60 meters (131and197 feet). A total of

6.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Three shovel tests, one near Area A and two in
Area C, yielded ferrous wire nails less than 50
centimeters (20 inches) from the surface. A
surface scatter of architectural brick fragments
was also mapped adjacent to Area A, and four
concrete park benches were mapped within or
near to Areas A and B.

This report presents the findings of an intensive
pedestrian archaeological survey of 16.6
hectares (41 acres) of property proposed for
improvements for the Memorial Park Eastern
Glades Phase 2 project within Memorial Park,
City of Houston, Harris County, Texas. The
primary goals of the investigation were
identification of archaeological features and
materials associated with the State Antiquities
Landmark-designated
Camp
Logan
archaeological site (41HR614) within the
project APE and identify additional prehistoricor historic-period archaeological materials and
deposits predating the establishment of Camp
Logan. Fieldwork and reporting for the survey
were conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit
Number 7686, issued to Gray & Pape by the
Texas Historical Commission (Archeology
Division) on June 17, 2016.

There are several factors that have likely
contributed to the low density of cultural
material recovered during the intensive
pedestrian survey. Based on a review of period
photography of Camp Logan, most camp
structures appear to have been built without
substantial masonry foundations or footings,
and were instead constructed directly on the
ground surface or set on wooden or masonry
piles (Aulbach et al. 2014). The camp structures
were largely designed for short-term use and
were completely removed from the site within
10 years of the closure of the camp as a military
post. Given these conditions, few structural
remains were expected to be identified.
Furthermore, a review of the 1918 Hendrickson
map suggests that much of the project area was
dedicated to open parade and drill grounds in
the approximate center of the military post. This
area would likely have been regularly subjected
to refuse removal and “policing,” leading to the
removal of at least some amount of refuse and
casually-dropped materials from the exposed
ground surface of the camp.

Prior to undertaking the field investigation,
Gray & Pape completed background literature
and site file research to identify the presence of
recorded sites within or near to the project area.
The project area intersects the Camp Logan
(41HR614) archaeological site while no other
archaeological sites have been previously
mapped within the project area. There are two
archaeological sites within a 1.6-kilometer (1mile) radius of the project area (41HR1158,
41HR791). Additional historical research of
Camp Logan and geo-referencing of the
Hendrickson 1918 survey map of Camp Logan
(Figure 3-1; Appendix B) with respect to recent
aerial imagery allowed for approximate
mapping of Camp Logan-period features that
aided the field investigation.

With respect to the brick scatter identified
adjacent to Area A, shovel testing yielded no
definitive evidence (such as traces of brick
mortar or concrete) of the bricks originating
from a nearby foundation, footing, or other
architectural feature, and therefore likely
represents discard activity that cannot be
directly associated with the Camp Logan
archaeological site. The ferrous wire nail
fragments recovered from Shovel Tests J1, C7,
and C7-South were not recovered from an
archaeological feature or deposit and cannot
as well be directly associated with the Camp

Field investigation consisted of pedestrian
reconnaissance, shovel testing, and photodocumentation completed in July and October
2016. A total of 68 shovel tests were mapped
within five survey areas encompassing the
project area. Of these, a total of seven shovel
tests were recorded as unexcavated due to
inundation or obstruction from asphalt refuse.

Logan archaeological site. The four identified
pre-cast concrete park benches are likely
associated with an earlier design of Memorial
Park and not the World War I-era occupation of
the Camp Logan archaeological site.
Based on the results of the survey, Gray &
Pape recommends no further archaeological
investigations with respect to the ferrous wire
nail artifacts and architectural brick fragments
identified in the course of the recent survey. The
current plans for the project take into
consideration the most distinct and visible of the
roadways dating to the Camp Logan period, as
identified in Area A of the recent survey.
Therefore, Gray & Pape is of the opinion that
the proposed project meets in design the
obligations of the Memorial Park Conservancy
to the Texas Antiquities Code (Figure 5-1;
Appendix A). Gray & Pape does recommend the
adoption of an Unanticipated Discoveries Plan
and Workforce Education Plan by the Memorial
Park Conservancy prior to the commencement
of construction to avoid adverse impacts to
buried archaeological features and materials
associated
with
the
Camp
Logan
archaeological site. In support of this
recommendation, Gray & Pape has prepared a
coordination document that would provide
continuing understanding and communication
between the Memorial Park Conservancy and
the THC with respect to the management of
archaeological resources associated with Camp
Logan.
