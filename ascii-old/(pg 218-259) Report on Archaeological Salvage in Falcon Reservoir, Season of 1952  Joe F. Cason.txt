REPORT ON ARCHAEOLOGICAL SALVAGE
IN.FALCON RESERVOIR, SEASON OF 1952
Joz F. CASO~r
Introduction

The Falcon Reservoir is located on the Rio Grande in
Starr and Zapata Counties, Texas. Falcon Dam is situated
in Starr County and is being built by a group of construction firms working under the supervision of the International Boundary and Water Commission.
The filling of the reservoir will initiate a program of
power production, flood control, and irrigation designed to
be of considerable aid to adjacent areas. There are certain
byproducts of the program which take on critical significance: the water covering the reservoir area will deny
archaeologists and historians access to the artifacts and
structures within the reservoir, will displace the population now living within the reservoir area, and will by that
displacement, create what may well constitute a major
change in the life way of those displaced.

Archaeological salvage has been undertaken in the area
for the past two years. Krieger and Hughes (1950), and
Aveleyra (1951) have produced papers dealing with several
facets of anthropology and history of the area, as well as
the salient data of their thorough archaeological reconnaissances. In these papers there is also a statement of the probferns encountered in the area and recommendations as to
their solution. Hartle (1951) has done salvage work in the
area and in a preliminary report thereon not only published
on the material susceptible to immediate analysis but also
contributed to the tentative description of the archaeological
column. In addition, Hartle pointed up several specific problems related to the archaeology.
Too much emphasis cannot be placed upon the desirability
of studying these papers prior to an examination of the
present report.

As in previous years, the efforts and interest of Dr. Erik
K. Reed of the National Park Service were largely responsible for the continuance of the salvage operations. Dr.
Reed’s recommendations concerning the desirability of further work resulted in the National Park Service’s entering
into a contract with the University of Texas wherein the
National Park Service agreed to provide the funds necessary for the actual expenses of the operation, the major
outlay in funds, and the University of Texas agreed to
furnish the necessary technical supervision.
Mr. Alex D. Krieger, Archaeologist for the University
of Texas, undertook the supervision of the project in addition to his regular duties. The writer was placed in charge
of the salvage operations for the 1952 season.
There were other organizations and individuals who materially contributed to the operdtion. In the International
Boundary and Water Commission Messrs. L. M. Lawson,
R. B. Ward, Roger Collins, Robert Bickle, Isom H. Hale,
N. S. Smith, and Hugh Findlay contributed technical advice
or instruments and machinery. Messrs. Phillip C. Royer and
Richard Wheaton of the Falcon Dam Constructors were
especially helpful. Mr. Royer, the General Superintendent,
in effect adopted the salvage operation from its inception
and was most generous in his assistance which included
machinery, tools, repair, aerial photography, skilled technicians, and an unflagging interest in the daily progress of
the work.
Mr. and Mrs. Robert Sherron of Zapata displayed an in°
terest rare in laymen. Mr. Sherron, whose work with the
Department of Agriculture has given him an intimate known
edge of the area, was instrumental in the recovery of the
aboriginal burials. Mrs. Sherron, an instructor in the Zapata
School System, brought her entire class to the excavation
for a first hand period of instruction in the materials and
methods of prehistorical investigation, a new departure i~
primary education which speaks for itself.

river and the lateral drainage. It is hoped that eircumstance~
will be such as to allow him to make a detailed study of the
terrace system in conjunction with any future archaeological
work in the area.
Last, but certainly not least, Mr. Tom L. Williamson,
student in training who was engaged in learning field methods, and Messrs. Juan and Roberto Castillo worked hard and
intelligently during the entire operation.
Preparatory Stud~l
The 1952 season of salvage operations in the Falcon Reservoir began on 2 January, 1952. Prior to going down to the
reservoir area, the writer made a study of the previous publications concerned with the area (Krieger and Hughes,
1950, and Hartle, 1951), of the cultural material obtained
during both seasons, and an examination of some of the
documentary sources available in the Library and Axchive~
of the University of Texas. The potential documentary
sources proved to be of such propo~ions that the examination was abandoned, and the widely known and variously
interpreted journal of Cabeza de Vaca and the comparatively obscure Historia de Nuevo Leon~ written by Capitan
Alonso de Leon, an anonymous author, and General Fernando Sanchez de Zamora were studied because the ethnography contained in both seems more or less germane
to the general area of the lower drainage of the Grande.
Reconnaissance

On 19 January Krieger and the writer went down to the
Falcon area. Some three days were spent in examining the
previously excavated sites and other promising sites located
by Hughes during the 1950 season. Since the reservoir extends some thirty-seven miles along the river, only a general impression of terrain and the potential characterist~s
of the sites was obtained so that the writer spent an additional two weeks in walking out the arroyo system and in
examining more of the sites located by Hughes.

Natural Stratigraphy
The stratigraphy encountered in the face of the arroyo
banks merits considerable discussion because of the interrelation between the zones containing cultural material and
the physiography and historical geology of the area. The
face of an arroyo bank has one of two generalized forms:
that of a vertical cliff or that of an upper vertical face with
a lower slope. It would further seem that some factor other
than the nature of the material of the bedding sometimes
determines the presence or absence of the lower slope.
Material in both types of face was sometimes homogeneous,
sometimes not. These materials may be pure silt or a layer
of silt above a layer of yellow material (this term will be
employed throughout the remainder of this report for a
yellowish, partially granular, partially clayish earth which

seems to be in large part a disintegrated sandstone.~ When
wet, this material has a clay-like consistency and is more
cohesive than the silt. Permeability by water is high for
silt, low for the yellow material. Retention of moisture is
low for the silt and high for the yellow material). Other
faces of arroyo banks show an upper layer of silt, a middle
layer of yellow material, and a bottom layer of stone. In
general the stone layer will show a vertical face. A further
complication consists in the sporadic appearance of layers
or beddings of gravel which may be over and u~nderlain by
silt layers. The appearance of the gravel bedding in one
arroyo and its non-appearance in the next some 150 yards
distant is a matter to be explained by the geologists.
All types of arroyo face are sometimes covered with a silt
coating which conceals both the nature of the beddings and
the presence of burial cultural material. There are, however,
enough exposed faces of arroyo banks to permit a thorough
reconnaisance for the beddings to be encountered in the
area and for archaeological stratigraphy.
The Miniature Bedding~
The exposed faces generally reveal miniature beddings or
seams varying in thickness from a quarter of an inch to two
or three inches. These seams are characterized by greater
density and hardness than the silt above and below and in
general show fracture lines at right angles to the usually
horizontal line of the bedding. Where the silt crumbles, the
material in these seams shows clear-cut cleavage. There is
no great difference in color between silt and seam, but the
seam material feels as if it consisted in appreciably smaller
grain size resembling talc. Several seams may appear in
roughly parallel order in the silt bedding of the arroyo
face. In addition to appearing as lines of demarcation in
the vertical faces of the arroyo banks, these beddings produce a form of miniature step terracing because of differences in hardness and density. These seams would seem to
represent old land surfaces which have been overlaid with
the type of silting found in dry stream beds where dessica-

Texga Areheo~o~.c~ ~r.d P~er~to~og~c~

tion has produced a tile-like pattern of fracture of the sun-.
baked mud of the stream bottom.
Archaeological Stratigraphy

In those places where arroyo banks and hill slopes draining into adjacent arroyos indicate the presence of buried
cultural material, there seems to be two well defined zones
of cultural material. The upper zone extends from the surface to a depth of about one foot. The lower zone appears
in the faces of the arroyo banks about four feet below the
general surface of the surrounding terrain. In particular the
lower zone shows a fairly wide distribution and is generally
characterized by relatively heavy concentrations of carbon
and flint chips in the face of the bank.
In addition to the two above described zones a small number of sites show flint and carbon, jointly or separately, at
an approximate depth of ten feet below the present surface. Hartle (1951) excavated such a site (78-B9-4), one of
the six which Krieger and Hughes (1950) describe as being
deeply buried. Two more such sites were located during the
1952 season: 78-B9-17-2 and 78-B2-25.
Conclusions

The reconnaissance of the area led to two general conclusions: 1. The vast majority of the aboriginal surface
sites are immediately contiguous to an arroyo and are geno
erally close to a tinaja or the river. The uplands were examined as well as the arroyo system and do not show the
concentration of cultural material found on arroyo banks
nor such clear indications of occupancy in the form of
hearths, snail shell, mussel shell, and flint work, especially
piles of flint chips which are common in the arroyo sites.
2. W2aerever possible, those sites should be excavated which
would allow a balance of emphasis upon the working out
of the physiography and historical geology of the site and
the recovery of cultural material. This course of action
would bring about the fullest exploitation of the carbon
samples, which reconnaissance had shown to form a sig-

nificant portion of cultural remains, through Carbon 14
dating. This decision influenced most of the excavation
during the 1952 season.
Excavation

oS Site 78-B9-8

After the surface and the faces of the arroyo banks had
been studied, subsurface testing was begun at 78-B9-8. This
site was close enough to the dam to allow the use of the
caterpillar, furnished by Mr. Rollins of the International
Boundary and Water Commission, and the caterpillar operator and the necessary maintenance, furnished by Mr. Royer
of the Falcon Dam Constructors. The availability of th~
equipment also influenced the choice of other nearby sites
for excavation.

78-B9-8 is situated in an arroyo bed and upon the adjacent
banks. The maximum relief is perhaps ten feet from the
bed of the arroyo to the top of the banks. On the upstream
end there is an outcropping of stone which continues for
some miles up and down stream more or less parallel to the
river. The site is approximately a half mile from the Grande
and is some eighty feet above the river. It is marked by a
heavy concentration of flint chips, several hearths apparently more or less.in situ, and numerous flint artifacts.
A test pit eight feet square was dug in the arroyo bank at
this site. Fired sandstone, flint chips and a small amount of
carbon were encountered in a zone approximately six inches
thick some two feet and three inches below the surface.
Innnediately below this cultural zone the soil changed from
silt to the yellow material previously described at a depth
of two feet and nine inches. Excavation in this yellow material was extremely difficult, a state of affairs later appreciated as a harbinger of any excavation attempted in this
material. The yellow material, except for small particles of
caliche, was completely sterile. Since no cultural material
susceptible to analysis had been found, and the excavation
indicated but one cultural zone, the site was abandoned.

Royer Site 78-B9-17
During the period of surface and stratigraphic reconnaissance, Mr. Richard Wheaton, an indefatigable week-end
collector, had shown us a site in Zapata County about 400
yards north of the Zapata-Starr Counties common boundary
line and about three hundred yards east of the Grande. This
site proved extremely rich in surface material and gave
promise of containing considerable stratigraphy. The terrain,
in general, consisted of a bowl-like depression draining into
an arroyo system. Extending back about three hundred
yards from the river a particularly deep tinaja marked a
general area (above the tinaja) of well defined cultural
zones in the face of the arroyo banks. From this tinaja,
both south and east for four or five hundred yards there
were large concentrations of old hearths eroded out of the
immediately subsurface zone, myriad flint chips, and many
artifacts.
:
The site was named for Phillip C. Royer and six test areas
were designated. All tests were conducted on a five foot

square system oriented on magnetic north except the Wheaton Test, North 30 degrees East, and Roberto Test, North
45 degrees East. Testing was undertaken for the purpose of
establishing stratigraphy and determining the advisability
of salvage operations with the caterpillar.
Felipe Test 78-B9-17.1 ~
The testing resulted in the recovery of a few artifacts
and a prodigious amount of carbon from old hearths. The
cultural material in no place protruded through the various
miniature beddings or seams herein before described but
seemed to show the heaviest concentrations immediately
below such beddings and immediately below the carbon of
the old hearths. In some five foot squares as many as 800
flint chips were recovered from a single three inch vertical
layer.
The significance of the stratigraphy will remain in doubt
until such time as a detailed analysis may be made of the
cultural material and the carbon collected can be dated.
The richest cultural zone occurred approximately four feet
beneath the surface. In view of the paucity of artifacts in
higher levels, it was decided to remove some three and onehalf feet of overburden for the exploitation of the rich zone.
The caterpillar was used to remove this overburden and
hand excavation was then resumed for the exploitation of
the heavy zone. A great amount of carbon was recovered
and a. sparse collection of artifacts. (Plate 30).
Wheaton Test 78-B9-17-2
In the meantime a flint blade or point had been found
in the vertical face of the Wheaton Test at a level nine feet
and ten inches below the surface at elevation 221.1. A second
blade or point was found at elevation 222.3, and a hearth
with "associated flint chi,ps between 222,3 and 221.4. This
material seemed to warrant an assumption of a deeply
buried cultural level.

Whereas in the Felipe Test the yellow material was encountered at an elevation of 222.70, some six feet below the

surface of the squares contiguous to the face of the arroyo
bank, and further excavation into this material revealed the
usual caliche particles but an otherwise sterile condition,
both of the flint points and the hearth in the face of the
arroyo bank at the Wheaton Test were well within the bedding of the yellow material. An apparent disconformity
between the silt and the yellow material occurred at 223.70
and was marked by a concave banding on the face of the
bank.
The Wheaton Test was then excavated by means of the

P~rtial grid of 78-B9-17-I.

FIGURE

caterpillar to an elevation approximately one foot above
the deeply buried cultural zone. Following the dozing operation, a test pit was sunk with the usual finding of caliche
in the yellow material. Further excavation produced flint
chips and fine particles of carbon, much like those described
by Hartle. Eventually a few artifacts were found. (Plate

31, B).
The digging was of a character to defy description. Eight
and ten pound picks were substituted for the light mattocks
with little better results, so that the sterile twelve inches
above the cultural zone came to constitute altogether too
much of a waste of time and effort. The caterpillar was used
to remove an additional nine inches or so of the yellow material. This second excavation was done by an operator who
had had prior experience with archaeological field methods
in the removal of overburden from Nebraskan sites. The
second dozing left the excavation entirely smooth and removed all loose material from within the excavation area.
Excavation by hand was continued with sparse results in
the shape of artifacts, the hardness of the yellow material
abating in no fashion whatsoever, but a hearth i~ sits was
encountered which yielded more than a quart of relatively
pure carbon. Burned flakes of flint, as well as the usual
fired sandstones, were also recovered.

Excavation was again halted and a dam built across the
front of the Wheaton Test whose grid system began back of
any portion of the arroyo face which had been removed by
the caterpillar. Ten thousand gallons of water were then
dumped into the test in an attempt to soften the yellow
material. Ten days later the "water cure" had reduced the
yellow material to the consistency of wedged potter’s clay
with a fairly dry surface or skin about one inch thick. This
partially dried surface was removed and screened so that
another inch or so of the material might be exposed and
subsequently dried. Further intermittent excavation was
continued until the end of the season.

It seems important that the Wheaton Test, unlike the
Felipe Test to the North and most of the exposed faces of
that finger of the arroyo upon which the Wheaton Test is
found, does not show more than the single concave band
marking the apparent disconformity between silt and yellow material. In no fashion does it show the six miniature
beddings revealed so clearly at the Felipe Test and upon
most faces of the arroyo banks within the drainage bowl.
This lack of miniature beddings may be a result of differential erosion which degraded the terrain to the north of the
Wheaton Test without materially affecting the overburden
at the test itself. Subsequent deposition would then account
for the miniature beddings to the north.
Isla Test 78-B9-17-3
The Isla Test is located in the bottom of the arroyo some
fifty yards northwest of the Wheaton Test. A small island
had resisted erosion to the extent that the original beddings
were preserved about six or seven feet above the floor of
the arroyo. Two five foot squares were cut down from the
top, elevation 226.00 feet, through the silt bedding and into
the yellow material. Here again the caliche appeared in the
yellow material and numerous flint chips and three artifacts
were found between the elevations of 224.00 to 222.00 feet,
this flint material perhaps constituting a continuum of the
culture zone found in the Wheaton Test. The Isla Test did
not contain miniature beddings in the silt above the yellow
material which could be identified. The character of the
material from the top to a considerable depth showed a disintegration of the bedding which consisted of vertical fissures. These fissures had the effect of producing a.crumbling, flake-like texture in the soil which extended into the
yellow material. Consequently the disconformity was not so
clearly marked as in the Wheaton Test but seems to have
been slightly higher in elevation, somewhere around 224.00
to 224.25. The apparent slope from north to south of the
yellow material between the Wheaton and Isla Tests exactly reverses the modern drainage of south to north and is

Report On Archaeologica~ ~atvage In Falcon Reservoir

supported by a few indications of the cultural zone in the
Wheaton Test showing a tendency to slope from north to
south, i. e., in the opposite direction from the modern drainage.
Roberto Test 78-B9-17-4
The Roberto Test, some seventy-five to one hundred feet
northeast of the Wheaton Test, showed fired sandstones in
the west face of the arroyo bank, elevation 223.97. Below
these stones, elevation 223.36, there is a thin layer of soft
sandstone some nine inches thick which gives every indication of being of fairly recent origin. Above and below this
layer of sandstone there is a bedding of the yellow material.
The beddings in the face from top to bottom consist in silt,
yellow material, recent sandstone (?), yellow material, and
a bedrock which seems to be an upper Crockett Formation.
These beddings are described because of the fact that the
Wheaton and Isla Tests do not show either the thin sandstone layer or the bedrocl~ It is supposed that past erosion
has removed the thin sandstone layer as well as the lower
bedrock. Consequently the yellow material in both the
vtrheaton and Isla Tests may bethe result of redeposition at
a time later than that for the yellow material at the Roberto
Testmif the yellow material is not the result of leeching.
Excavation at the Roberto Test produced flint chips, carbon, and a few artifacts, but no carbon in the immediate
vicinity of ’the burned sandstones previously mentioned. A
particularly rich carbon strike continued down some feet
from the elevation at which it was first encountered, probably the result of .a burned tree root. Enough carbon was
obtained in the very bottom of the excavation for dating
purposes, and this carbon, found some four feet from the
rich vein, was stored separately. The excavation in the
Roberto Test ended at 225.00 with the appearance of the
bedrock in square ,A", at 225.24 in Square "B", but a two
foot section was continued down to the burned hearthstones in the west face of the bank in a search for carbon.

Mesa Test 78-B9-17-5

The Mesa and Nariz Tests immediately across the arroyo
from the Felipe Test were excavated for the purpose of
obtaining carbon samples of the same relative elevation as
that of the heaw3 zone in the Felipe Test. These tests were
small and shallow since erosion had progressed more rapidly on the south bank.
The surface of the ground of the Mesa Test seems to consist of an example of the step-terracing sometimes produced
by the miniature beddings. To the west of the test the

ground rises about a foot from a vertical face which shows
the miniature bedding denuded at the position of the test
itself. The higher ground to the west also seems to mark a
surface preserved by the harder material of the next higher
miniature bedding. As the ground slopes down toward the
east (upstream) from the position of the test an old hearth
appears denuded and surrounded by flint chips. The difference in elevation bet~veen the west side of the Mesa Test,
227.00, and the east side, 226.2, in a distance of twenty feet
might be explained by a relatively more efficient surface
erosion proportional to the distance from the next higher
level of the terracing. In any event, the material lying below
the elevation of 226.20 feet can possibly be taken as lying
below a miniature bedding whose lower limit is at that
level.
A carbon sample, flint .chips, and a couple of artifacts
were recovered from the Mesa Test.
Nar~z Test 78-B9-17-6
The Nariz Test consisted in reducing a small spur or nose
extending from south to north into the arroyo bed. Conditions of the material approximated those at the Isla Test.
The material was disintegrated and broken by vertical cracking and there were animal burrows in the northern portion
of the spur. Results of the excavation were nil until the
226.3-226.1 level was reached where three artifacts and a
carbon sample were obtained. A miniature bedding occurs
at about 226.3.
The EIenita Site 78-B9-19
The problem of the miniature beddings in relation to the
arroyo pattern was the motivation for two small test pits
being made in the Elenita Site. This site lies on the south
bank of the arroyo 200 yards south the Zapata-Starr Counties
boundary and some 100 yards east of the Grande. A finger
of the arroyo drains due north into the east to west main
drainage. Upon the east bank of this finger the Crockett

sandstone is exposed in identical fashion as at the Roberto
Test of the Royer Site.
Two five foot squares were excavated in an island rising
from the floor of the arroyo finger from elevation 233.00 to
229.7, and a large collection of mussel shells and a carbon
sample were obtained. A clay seam overlay the hearth which
contained the mussel shells and the carbon so that a Carbon
14 date might be correlated with the seam which has a lower
limit of 230.2 feet elevation.
Smith Site 78-B9-20

The Smith Site was uncovered immediately south of the
dam axis by earth-moving equipment excavating a borrow
pit. Mr. N. S. Smith, Soil Analyst for the International
Boundary and Water Commission, noticed that a caterpillar
had exposed a large hearth and stopped the excavation long
enough to recover carbon and a flint, chopper. This hearth,
according to estimates by Smith and others, was struck
some ten feet below the original surface of the ground and
gave every indication of being in situ. A check of the excavation could not be made in time to effect further salvage.
CastiZlo Site 78-B2-22

Mr. Robert Sherron of the U. S. Agricultural Department
informed us of a burial discovered in one of the small arroyos immediately adjacent to the Arroyo Beleno. This site,
named after Juan Casti.llo, lies upon the lip of the arroyo
bank some two hundred yards east of the Grande. A sparse
surface collection of points and scrapers was collected in the
general vicinity of the burial. The burial itself was apparently about fourteen inches below the surface. Erosion had
exposed part of the skeletal material to the extent that Mr.
Gaspar Garcia, who discovered the burial, had recognized
the character of the bones. Mr. Garcia had either partially
or completely excavated the burial some six months prior
to our arrival. He had removed some six or eight points and
the left half of a mandible. One point had been found in
contact with the Iengual surface of the body of the mandible.

240

Texas Archeolog~cal and Paleontological Society

Subsequently, lVlr. Garcia had covered over the material
after removing the mandible and the points.
Examination of the site showed small fragments of bone
exposed on the surface. Excavation revealed considerable
skeletal material which included a complete skull, except
for the left half of the mandible previously mentioned, cervical vertebrae, ribs, fragments of the long bones of the
arms, and very small fragments of the femora. A second
complete mandible was also recovered. The location of most
of the material indicated that it had either been disturbed
by Mr. Garcia or was in part a secondary burial. There was
some slight indication that not all of the material had been
disturbed since the relation of the cervical vertebrae and
the ribs to the skull seemed more or less normal. The axis
of skull, cervical vertebrae, and ribs was from east to west,
but lack of sufficient post-cranial material precludes any
statement concerning flexure.
Recovered with the skeletal material was a large quantity
of tubular bone beads, ochre, flint points, a bone awl, and a
bone tube.
Excavation was continued until sterile silt was encountered around and under the skeletal material.
Garcia Site 78-B2-21
Mr. Garcia showed us a second burial to the west of the
highway some 500 yards from the Castiiio site. Here again
erosion had uncovered skeletal material and small fragments
lay exposed upon the surface. This material lay at the foot
of a vertical three-foot bank. Immediately subsurface excavation of the area of exposed fragments laid bare more bone
in a very fragmentarh, state, but relatively well-preserved
teeth indicated the presence of parts of at least two individuals, since molars of an adolescent or young adult with
negligible wear of the cusps, as well as molars showing
such wear of the cusp surfaces as to more or less obliterate
the cusps, were found.

Numerous tubular bone beads were mixed in among the
skeletal fragments, and an old wrought iron nail was found
on the surface. This was named the Gaspar Garcia Site.
Evans Site 78-B2-26
In another finger of the arroyo system containing the
Juan Castillo Site, rotted fragments of tusk of elephant or
mammoth were encountered in the bed of the arroyo where
they lay exposed. Superficial excavation below the exposed
fragments revealed more fragmentation. Samples of the
tusk were collected, but the site was otherwise left undisturbed, since Krieger had indicated at the beginning of the
season that paleontological finds would be l~ft for removal
by professional paleontologists.
After the close of all excavation Mr. Glen Evans visited
the area with Doctor T. N. Campbell and the writer for the
purpose of giving us any possible aid with the geology which
he could offer. He pronounced the sand upon which the
fragments lay and were embedded to be stream-washed.
Mr. Evans made a further superficial excavation that produced more fossils which he described as skull and tooth
fragments. In addition, just beneath the skeletal material and
some nine inches beneath the surface, he exposed a flint
flake showing unmistakable signs of human manufacture.
This site, the Glen Evans Site 78-B2-26, is situated approximately 100 yards east of the Grande at an elevation of forty
to fifty feet above the river. The bottom of the arroyo is
perhaps eight feet below the adjacent area. The topmost
bedding seems to be the usual silt found throughout the
reservoir area. This bedding is followed by the streamwashed sand, and the arnoya has cut down two or three feet
into this sand. Below the sand there is a tightly compacted
bed of gravel. Small nodules of this gravel are found in
meager quantities in the higher sand, there being some
small nodules mixed with the sand in which the skeletal
material was found.

TecoloteroSite 78-B2-25
A heavy seam of charcoal was found in the face of the
bank of the Arroyo Tecolotero. The charcoa~ was approximately ten feet below the surface of the adjacent terrain
and some four feet above the floor of the arroyo. A sample
of the carbon exposed in the arroyo face was first collected,
and then the bank was undercut so that an uncontaminated
~mple might be obtained from a sufficiently interior position in the bank as to preclude contamination from the atmosphere. Excavation seemed unwarranted without the aid
of the caterpillar which was some twenty-five miles downstream.
Gut~rrezSite 78-B2-24

Surface collections were made at several sites found during the 1952 season. The Gutierrez Site was found by Krieger
and the writer during the first few days of the season. This
site lies ,~pon the old Gutierrez porcion to the north of
Zapata, about five hundred yards from the river and at an
elevation of fifty or sixty feet above the stream at that point.
It is situated upon the top of the arroyo bank which consists
of silt v~ith an underbedding of gravel The cultural zone
seems to be confined to the surface which seems to have
been eroded down some two feet or more below the general
level of the rather flat terrace top at this point.
De Cuellar Site 78-B2-23
This site is located upon the top of the terrace between
the Castillo and Evans Sites. It is perhaps sixty feet above
the river at that point. The de Cuellar site seems to be colon°
ial Spanish in character. The site is marked by stone from
a completely destroyed building, a profusion of potsherds,
and other typical artifacts of colonial or later times. As is
usual in most colonial sites there is also a profusion of flint
work and crdde, utilitarian pottery fragments which might
lead the unsuspecting to conclude that the pottery was aboriginal. In this connection it must be reported that not a

Report On Archaeological Salvage In Falcon Reservoir

245

single potsherd has been found in the excavation of a precolonial site.
An arroyo finger which reaches to within fifty yards of
the ruined building revealed a tremendous mass of skeletal material which Mr. Glen Evans identified as that of
cattle and sheep or goat. Th~s material lies buried in a zone
from four to eighteen inches below the surface similar to
the skeleta] remains at the Castillo Site and at about the
same elevation above the river. These skeletal remains
would seem to be the remnants of an old abbatoir.

Rio Corto Site 78-B8-I4
This site lies on the north bank of a tributary of the
Arroyo Grande to the south of the village of Falcon. This
tributary drains south into the main arroyo and the site is
situated in the face of the bank as well as in a small remnant
or island rising from the arroyo floor. The general surface of
the terrace below whic.h the arroyo has cut is about sixty
feet above the river. Cultural material is found in profusion
upon the terrace surface, in a zone perhaps one foot beneath
the surface, and in a zone approximately four feet below the
surface. The deeper zone appears, from the amount of flint
chips exposed in the face of the bank, and exposed artifacts
which give every indication of having been weathered from
this zone, to be the richest zone of the site. All zones bearing
cultural material lie within a silt bedding.
Escondido Site 78-B9-18
This site lies upon a north branch and upstream from the
arroyo upon which 78-B9-8 is located. The elevation of the
site is about eighty feet above the Grande, and it is about
six hundred yards east of the river. The Escondido Site is
marked by rather precipitous banks and the floor of the
arroyo is fourteen to eighteen feet below the surface of the
surrounding terrain. The face of the arroyo bank shows that
the major portion of the bedding is silt. In this site the cultural zone is not well defined but seems to lie in an immedi-

ately subsurface zone beneath the present general level of
the terrace. Material was found on the floor of the arroyo
as well as high on the sides of the arroyo face, but debris
eroded from what appears to have been the single cultural
layer can be traced upon the slope of the arroyo bank to an
immediately subsurface location.

For all sites excavated during the 1952 season, the geologic
column from the water’s edge of the Grande to a point immediately beyond the sites consists of a bedrock which
seems to be fairly continuous throughout the entire reservoir area and would seem to have a general upper limit of
between twenty and thirty feet above water level. In many
places the so-called modern terrace at the edge of the Grande
abuts against the face of this bedrock but does not completely cover it. Above the bedrock there is a bedding of
gravel or yellow material, and above this a bedding of silt.
Outcroppings of hard layers of stone are exposed in the
silt in successively higher levels, and these outcroppings
form lines roughly parallel to the river. In general there
is some evidence to support the contention that the twenty
to thirty foot level of the bedrock is continuous for two or
three hundred feet back from the river, and that the out~
croppings which are distinctly higher, may represent previous stages of erosion.

This idealized column seems to have been complicated by
erosion and deposition both from the lateral drainage systems and from the river itself, so that each individual site
constitutes a separate problem.
The relative abundance of carbon recovered should furnish some illumination of the problems of physiography and
climate related to the upper beds, as well as provide dating
for the cultural remains.

Since the carbon from the old hearths constitutes the bulk
of the material found, some discussion of the hearths is in
order. In general, the hearths consisted of a few burned sand-

250

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

stone chunks and carbon. In rare instances there was a considerable quantity of burned earth or of earth so heavily
impregnated with carbon as to have a dark, distinct color1
quite different from the tan silt or yellow material. There
was no symmetric pattern of disposition of the hearth stones.
Generally there would be three or four stones about six to
eight inches in diameter and several smaller fragments.
Carbon was also found in many instances where only a few
small fragments of burned sandstone were in association.
Snail shell and flint were generally more plentiful immediately contiguous to the carbon finds, and in many instances
flint chips and broken artifacts were found below the
hearths but showed no indication of damage from heat.
In some squares considerable carbon was recovered in
small, discrete particles, much in the fashion described by
Hartle (1951). Subsequent excavation in adjacent squares
exposed a hearth or mass of carbon upon the same level so
that one might tentatively conclude that the discrete particles had in some fashion or other been scattered, washed
or blown away from the adjacent fire.
The presence of carbon could sometimes be suspected
several inches higher in the excavation than the actual material. In such cases the silt would appear slightly moist
above the area of the buried carbon and the carbon, upon
excavation, would contain moisture. Practically no rainfall
was had during the entire excavation, but a heavy rain of
eight inches had fallen the prior September. In general the
moisture content of the silt and the yellow material seemed
negligible although some evaporation was perceptible because of color change after exposure and the increase in
dust, a condition readily noted because of continuous wind.
This observation is made because it makes possible some
contamination of the carbon from rainfall and seepage.
The lists of materials excavated are included for the purpose of showing not only the general types of material found
but also the quantities. The descriptive terminology is extremely tentative insofar as the flint work is concerned so

Repo~ On, Archaeological Salvage I~ Falco~ Reservoir-

251

that any permanent classification differentiating blades and
projectile points will have to await the detailed analysis of
all the material. Hartle’s finding of relative unii’ormity of
artifacts from top to bottom of the archaeological column
must stand because artifacts excavated during the 1952 season show a similar uniformity.
Recommendatior~
Insofar as the archaeology is concerned further work in
the area is needed, particularly in working out the correlation between cultural horizons and physiography and climate. In addition there is a considerable body of information
to be had in the area concerning the remains of elephant or
mammoth. Reports of findings of elephant bones are almost
as numerous as the arroyos in the drainage system in the
area and considerable skeletal material is now in the possession of lay collectors, most of whom can relocate the areas
from which the bones were collected. A majority of the
finds seem to have come from the gravel beddings, but a few
have been recovered from the silt. The probable occurrence
of associated cultural material with these elephant remains
merits investigation.
In any event, the services of a competent geologist who
could devote enough time to the project to help work out a
joint plan of attack upon the problem and accomplish the
necessary surveys of the terrace system seem vitally necessary for a well-rounded future program.

The excavation of prehistoric sites in this reservoir must
also be planned around the essential point that vast quantities of terrace silt must be removed in order to clear
archaeological sites which are, at best, very thin zones with
a few widely scattered artifacts and hearths. Such excavatioR will be rewarding, however, for this season’s work
showed that cultural material is buried in terraces which
had reached (before their subsequent erosion) heights of
sixty, seventy, and perhaps even eighty to ninety feet above
the present Rio Grande water level. Consequently, despite

252

the simplicity of the artifacts, a very long history of human
occupation and climatic changes over several thousand years
can be expected.
