Calendar of Activities

MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT
Last month I ended this column with the
statement “I hope you are all having a
wonderful summer”. But just this morning, as I was driving to work and seeing
some school buses on the road, my
thoughts were…just where did the summer go? My summer officially starts with
the TAS Field School; and after a great
week at Menard in June, the summer was
off to a good start. I remember the evenings at FS talking with other TCAS members about our big plans
for more archeology at the Upper Sprague site this summer. The
monsoons that repeatedly flooded many parts of Texas created
havoc all along the Leon River. As the continuing rain repeatedly
flooded out our work and progress there, I guess it washed away
an important part of my summer too. Hopefully, we can get back
to work there soon.
Speaking of making plans and incorporating some archeology;
please be aware that next month is Texas Archeology Awareness
Month. Every October many Historical and Archeological organizations across the state host some sort of event promoting archeology awareness in our communities. This is a great time to
spend some time educating and encouraging the general public
as to what Archeology is all about. It can fun and educational for
TCAS members too, when they volunteer to help at one or more of
the fairs. As always, we have been asked to help out with some
of the more local events. Please take a look at this months Calendar of Activities and pick a weekend or two that you could help
out.
Lastly, the TAS Annual Meeting is late is approaching soon. If you
haven’t ever attended Annual Meeting before make plans to go,
you’ll really enjoy it. This year the meeting will be held at the
Menger Hotel in San Antonio on October 26th - 28th. Make your
reservations at the historic (1859) Menger Hotel soon, as the
rooms are going fast.

Background on tel gezer
An Overview of the History of this Important Israeli site

The tel (mound) of the Biblical city of Gezer is located on the western slopes of the Judean Hills, midway between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Built on a hill overlooking the fertile Ayalon Valley, the importance of this city was its
strategic location at the intersection of the road from Egypt, along the coastal plain northward, and the road leading to the
Judean Hills and Jerusalem. The ancient name of Gezer is preserved in the Arabic name of the tel: Tel el-Jazari. Verification of
the site comes from Hebrew inscriptions found engraved on rocks, several hundred meters from the tel. These inscriptions
from the 1st century BCE read "boundary of Gezer."
The tel covers an area of over 30 acres. Part of this
area was excavated between 1902-1909, when archeology was still in its infancy, and caused considerable
damage to the site. Since the 1960s, new excavations
have been conducted in several areas of the tel. The
rich finds discovered in these excavations attest to the
importance of the city in antiquity and constitute a
unique contribution to the study of past material cultures
of the Land of Israel.
Inhabitants of the first settlement established at Tel
Gezer, toward the end of the 4th century BCE, lived in
large caves cut into the rock. At the beginning of the
Early Bronze Age (beginning of the 3rd millennium
BCE), there existed an unfortified settlement covering
the entire area of the tel. Following its destruction in the
middle of the 3rd millennium BCE, the tel was abandoned for several hundred years.
Then, in the Middle Bronze Age (first half of the 2nd
century BCE), Gezer became one of the foremost cities
in the Land of Israel. The entire tel was surrounded by a
massive wall constructed of large blocks of stone 4 m.
wide, with strong towers erected at intervals along it
Tel Gezer was first excavated by R.A.S. Macalister in
1902. New excavations were conducted from 1964 to
1973, in 1984 and in 1990.

THE POWER OF WATER
To those of us who raised an eyebrow last month when Larry Banks made claims about
the powers of anoxic water, here’s an article that supports his claims
The Wendover site was discovered in 1982 when a backhoe operator discovered human bones in the black peat he was
digging from the bottom of a pond. The developers, after being advised by the county medical examiner that the bones were
very old and not the product of a recent mass murder, realized that the materials might be of archaeological significance, so
they contacted the anthropology department of Florida State University.
Members of the faculty visited the site and recovered bones of several individuals from the spoil banks. Their first thoughts were that, because of the
exceptional state of preservation, the bones were only a few hundred years
old. Normally, bone deteriorates in an unprotected grave in about 500 to 600
years due to the high acid level of Florida soil and water.
Radiocarbon dating was done on two samples. The first piece showed an age
of 7,330 years, plus or minus 100 years, and the second showed an age of
7,210 years, plus or minus 100 years. Radiocarbon dating over the three seasons of excavation indicated ages ranging from 6,990 years to 8,120 years,
plus or minus 70 years.
A most significant find came only weeks into the project when one of the project directors found a lump of slippery, dark
brown material inside a skull. There was cautious speculation that it might be preserved brain tissue, but common sense
said that would not be possible--that any tissue would have dissipated into the black peat thousands of years ago. Laboratory tests proved however, that cautious speculation had become reality. The material was, indeed, human brain tissue.
This first find was from a woman who died at approximately 45 years of age. Over the three six-month field seasons 91
skulls were found to contain brain tissue. Some contained complete brains. Although they were shrunken to a third their
normal size, the brain hemispheres and convolutions were clearly intact.
Many artifacts made from wood, bone or antler were found over the three seasons. Several were scribed in geometric patterns. A small bone from a bird was intricately patterned with fine, precise lines which were probably made with a shark's
tooth as a tool. The hollow bone may have been used as a whistle.
Several manatee rib "hammers" were uncovered, some with parts of their wooden handles still intact. A dog tooth, held in
place with pine pitch as a form of glue, was imbedded in the end of one hammer.
The tooth provided a harder surface than the manatee rib. An unexpected find
was an atlatl "hook" made from deer antler. The atlatl is a wooden launching device which increases the velocity and the distance a spear can be thrown. The
rear end of the spear is nested in the "hook."
Why was the wood, bone, human brain tissue and other materials so well preserved? The answer lies in the way the bodies were buried and the nature of the
water in the pond. The bodies were evidently buried soon after death--probably
within twenty-four hours--before the process of decay had started. With peat covering the bodies, an anaerobic atmosphere was created. That is, oxygen necessary for the growth of bacteria and fungi that
cause decomposition, was shut out. Water in the sinkhole is brackish and nearly devoid of oxygen, and it is this anoxic water that has served as a natural preservative for thousands of years.
The State of Florida allocated nearly a million dollars for excavation and preservation, but now, a wealth of information lies
cataloged and boxed at Florida State University because the state cannot provide additional funds for research. Additional
research could tell much about the native Americans who lived near a small pond 4,000 years before Christ was born and
2,000 years before the pyramids were built or ceramics came into existence.

“Quid” is no longer British Money

Ancient Human DNA Extracted From Yucca Leaves
Spat Out
Science Daily — In a groundbreaking study, two Harvard scientists have for the first time extracted human DNA from ancient
artifacts. The work potentially opens up a new universe of
sources for ancient genetic material, which is used to map
human migrations in prehistoric times.

More broadly, archaeologists interested in migration patterns
anywhere now have a new source for the DNA that can be
used to track the movement of ancient people — though
LeBlanc cautioned that the methods have to be retested and
refined.

Before this, archaeologists could only get ancient DNA from
relics of the human body itself, including prehistoric teeth,
bones, fossilized feces, or — rarely — preserved flesh. Such
sources of DNA are hard to find, poorly preserved, or unavailable because of cultural and legal barriers.
By contrast, the genetic material used in the Harvard study
came from two types of artifacts — 800 to 2,400 years old —
that are found by the hundreds at archaeological sites in the
American Southwest.
“Quids” — small fibrous bundles of stripped yucca leaves —
are the spit-out remnants of a kind of ancient chewing gum.
Cells from long-dried saliva yield usable DNA. And “aprons”
were thong-like woven garments worn by women. They are
stained with traces of apparent menstrual blood, a source of
DNA
The Harvard study, featured in the summer 2007 issue of the
Journal of Field Archaeology, “opens up the possibility of utilizing a much larger variety of human-handled artifacts” for DNA
evidence, said project co-director Steven LeBlanc, director of
collections at Harvard’s Peabody Museum of Archaeology and
Ethnology.
Among the likely future sources of ancient DNA, he said, are
“sandals, textiles, and cane cigarettes,” a reedlike smoke favored by early humans. LeBlanc’s co-director in the project
was Thomas Benjamin, a professor of pathology at Harvard
Medical School.

The origins of the earliest North American farmers are still
officially a puzzle, and center on a now-lost tribe known as the
Western Basketmakers. More than 2,000 years ago, these
indigenous Americans started growing corn in what is now
southeastern Utah and northern Arizona.
In what is now a boon to archaeologists who look at DNA, early
farmers rested in the shade of rock formations, and spit out
quids of chewed yucca leaves.

“The team was as surprised as everyone else that we could
learn something about a possible migration over 2,000 years
LeBlanc and others sampled 48 quids from four Southwestern ago from ancient spit,” said LeBlanc. “Every artifact that we
