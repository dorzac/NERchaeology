ABSTRACT
In January 2012 Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants (DETAC) conducted a
cultural resource management survey of the proposed improvements to Fair Park in
Pittsburg, Texas. The improvements include adding six activity areas, grading
improvements, construction of a fountain, developing Americans with Disabilities (ADA)
access, installing sidewalks and benches, and improving existing activity areas, i.e.,
repainting existing activity areas and installing new basketball goals. The cultural
resources survey included a visual inspection of bare areas and shovel testing in a 2.8
hectare (6.8 acre) area around the proposed improvements under Texas Antiquities
Permit #6148. A total of 17 shovel tests were dug across the property; all were all
negative. No archaeological sites were documented and no artifacts were collected. No
further investigations are recommended; however, in the event that human remains and/or
archaeological materials are discovered during construction, then the project activity will
immediately cease and the Texas Historical Commission shall be notified of the
discovery. DETAC is requesting concurrence with the determination of “no effect” to
NRHP eligible properties for the proposed park improvements.

INTRODUCTION
In January, Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants (DETAC) conducted a cultural
resources survey of Fair Park in the City of Pittsburg, Texas (Figure 1). Cultural resource
management was required because the park is administered by the City of Pittsburg, and the city
plans to improve existing equipment and construct new facilities on the park property. Texas
Antiquities Permit #6148 was obtained for this project, and all terms of the permit were carried out
pursuant of the Texas Antiquities Code and the National Historic Preservation Act.
The purpose of the survey was to locate, describe, and document cultural resources. No
resources were recorded during the survey. The report was prepared using the short report
format outlined by the Council of Texas Archaeologists (CTA) (2005a) with additions suggested
by the Texas Historical Commission (Martin 1999). No previously recorded sites will be
impacted, no new archaeological sites were recorded, and no artifacts or cultural material was
observed or collected during the survey. DETAC requests concurrence with a determination of
“no effect” to properties listed or eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).

DEFINITION OF THE STUDY AREA
The project area includes 2.8 hectares (ha) (6.8 acres (ac) of the existing Fair Park.
Boundaries of the project area are defined by N. Texas Street to the west, Mattison Street to the
south, a neighborhood to the east, and the park pond to the north. Topographically, the project
area is on a gentle slope overlooking the headwaters of Sparks Branch. The stream was dammed
to create the pond along the northern boundary. A map of parcel boundaries, streets, and fences
clearly delineated the park boundaries. The proposed park improvements include adding six
activity areas, grading improvements, construction of a fountain, developing Americans with
Disabilities (ADA) access, installing sidewalks and benches, and improving existing activity
areas, i.e., repainting existing activity areas and installing new basketball goals.

Ground

disturbance is limited to foundations and footings for activity areas and grading an irregular
surface near the northwest corner of the project area.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS AND CULTURAL HISTORY
Overall, Camp County has been part of broad studies and investigated in large
examinations, individual site evaluations, and numerous small surveys. The closest large-scale
investigations to the City of Pittsburg were conducted for reservoirs and strip mines. For
example, Hus’s (1969) survey for the Titus County Reservoir and McCormick’s (1973) survey
for the Montecello Mine. Archaeological site evaluations (testing and data recovery) were
conducted on numerous sites in Camp County. Most recently, Perttula (2005) conducted data
recovery excavations on 41CP304, and Fishbeck and Loftus (2011) conducted NRHP testing on
41CP27 and 41CP417.

Small-scale surveys were conducted for several road and utility

improvements throughout the county, e.g., Perttula’s (2003) survey of a waterline north and west
of Pittsburg.
In addition to the fieldwork referenced above, several documents have added significantly
to available information on the archaeological record in this region. The documents of primary
importance are D.A. Story's (1990) and J.A. Guy's (1990) discussions of the Gulf Coastal Plain and
Thurmond’s published thesis (1990) describing archaeological site types and their distribution in
the Cypress Creek basin.

Additionally, the Texas Historical Commission, Department of

Antiquities Protection developed a document for the eastern Texas portion of the Texas State Plan
(Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). The State Plan includes several historic contexts, each of which
deals with a particular facet of northeast Texas prehistory. This plan serves to synthesize the
current state of archaeological research in the region and identify problems and objectives to be
addressed in future research and cultural resources management projects. Several weak areas in
archaeological knowledge of the region are identified in these studies. Cultural chronology,
aboriginal settlement patterns and subsistence, and historic continuities are some of the general
research directions that these recent studies emphasize as important for developing future
archaeological research designs. More recently, Perttula (2004:370-407) describes the Caddoan
archaeology of northeast Texas which encompasses the area between the Red River in the north,
the Trinity River in the west, and Angelina River in the south.
The occupation of the area ranges from the Paleo-Indian (ca. pre-7000 B.C.), Archaic
foraging cultures (ca. 7000-200 B.C.), Early Ceramic Period groups (ca. 200 B.C. - A.D. 800),
the sedentary Caddoan occupation (A.D. 800 - 1680), to the historic Euro American settlement
(Perttula and Kenmotsu 44:1993). The Paleo-Indian period (ca. pre-7000 B.C.) is characterized
3

by small, mobile bands of hunters and gatherers that consumed a variety of native plants and
animals (Story 1990). The Archaic (7000-200 B.C.) refers to hunter-gatherers who implemented
more regionally specialized approaches toward exploiting their environment (Story 1990). The
Early Ceramic (200 B.C.-A.D. 800) stage, also referred to as the Woodland period, represents an
increasing utilization of the environment by local groups to include a greater reliance on
cultigens, prolonged occupations at specific locales indicating an increasingly sedentary
lifestyle, and the emergence of social and ritual ceremonies (Story 1990). The prehistory of east
Texas in the Late Prehistoric period essentially concerns the Caddoan culture (A.D. 800-1600).
This culture is an indigenous development strongly influenced by the Mississippian tradition of
the Lower Mississippi Valley (Story 1990). Larger aggregates of people became sedentary and
constructed villages with public ceremonial areas and cemeteries found in association with large
mounds. A stratified social structure developed, corresponding to the chiefdom level as first
defined by Service (1962, 1975). Extensive commercial networks were also established.
The Historic period (1680-present) describes both the history behind the current cultural
setting of the area and marks a transition from the native populations domination of the area, to
the American immigrants establishment of farms, towns, and counties. The first Anglo settlers
in Camp County were American settlers from southern states after the Texas Revolution. These
settlers established Pittsburg and several other communities by the 1860’s and separated from
Upshur County in 1874 (Harper 2012). Pittsburg was named county seat in 1874 and remains
the largest city in Camp County. Construction of two railways through the city in the 1870’s and
1890’s insured the city would remain important to local agriculture and manufacturing (Davis
2012).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The investigations were performed in compliance with the National Historic Preservation
Act of 1966 (PL89-665), as amended in 1974, 1976, 1980, and 1992; the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 (PL91-190, 83 Stat. 915, 42 USC 4231, 1970); the guidelines set forth by the
CTA (2005b); the Texas Antiquities Code and the ethics standards of the Texas Archaeological
Society and the Society of Professional Archaeologists.
The program of site definition was conducted in accordance with the National Park
Service criteria (36 CFR, part 60.4) which present the guidelines for determining eligibility of a
cultural resource for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The
objectives of the survey were to locate prehistoric or historic cultural resources sites within the
survey area. If sites were found, then the investigations were to delineate the vertical and
horizontal extent of each site, determine each site’s integrity, and provide a preliminary
evaluation of each site’s potential for NRHP eligibility.
Before initiating fieldwork, DETAC conducted a records and literature review using the
Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2012).

The atlas contains an updated database with

published and unpublished data regarding cultural resource surveys, location maps, and cultural
resources records. In addition, these records show State Archaeological Landmarks (SAL) and
NRHP eligibility of previously recorded sites.
DETAC conducted a 100 percent pedestrian survey of the area. To locate sites, the
pedestrian survey relied on shovel testing and visual examination of the project area. Shovel
testing included excavating an area approximately 30 centimeters (cm) in diameter in 10 cm (4
inch (in)) levels down to the clay substrate or 90 cm (35 inches). The excavated matrix was
screened through a 0.635 cm (0.25 inch) wire mesh screen. According to the THC guidelines,
project areas between 3 and 10 acres require a minimum of two shovel tests per acre. Following
these guidelines, the pedestrian survey of the 2.8 ha (6.8 ac) project area included a surface
inspection focusing on areas with exposed soil (e.g., erosional features and ant mounds) along with
a minimum of 14 shovel tests. Shovel test locations were recorded with a Magellan GPS with 3 to
5 meter accuracy and notes were made about soil color, texture, and shovel test depth. The visual
examination included observing the ground surface (overturned trees, rodent disturbances,
mechanical disturbances) and making notes on topographic features (micro-topography, berms, and
pits) not visible on the topographic map.

RESULTS
The literature search and records review of the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (2012)
found one archaeological site, nine historical markers, and four surveys within 1.6 kilometers (km)
(1 mile (mi)) of the project area. The archaeological site, 41CP365, was recorded by Bo Nelson
(2000) as part of the Texas Archaeological Steward Network. Site 41CP365 was recorded as a
lithic scatter on city property roughly 100 meters (m) (330 feet (ft)) west of the project area. The
previously recorded nine historical markers include two houses from the 1890’s, two churches from
the 1890’s and 1900’s, three public buildings from the 1880’s to 1910’s, a library from the 1926,
and a private company building from 1902. All of these markers are within 500 m (1640 ft) of the
center of town. The closest historical marker is approximately 330 m (1000 ft) south of the project
area. The four archaeological surveys include surveys in 1983 and 1988 for road improvements
north of the survey, a survey by Perttula (2003) for a waterline, and a survey by TxDot in 2007 of a
proposed road reroute south of the city. None of these surveys documented any archaeological
sites within a mile of the project area.
The project area encompasses the Fair Park area south of the pond and west of the nearby
neighborhood (Figure 2).

Disturbances noted in the initial visual inspection included the

existing park equipment and facilities, sidewalks, and a large area near the western edge of the
pond that was exposed soil and heavily disturbed. The exposed surfaces were visually inspected
for artifacts.

No cultural material was found during the surface inspection.

No new

archaeological sites were documented as a result of the visual inspection in the project area.
Topographically, the project area gradually slopes northward to the pond. No microtopographic features were observed that required additional shovel testing or investigation.
Vegetation consists of mowed grasses and scattered hardwoods within the maintained park area.
Soil series within the project area included Nahatche silty clay loam (frequently flooded) adjacent
to the pond, Kullit very fine sandy loam (urban land complex) up to 50 m (164 ft) south of the
pond, and Sacul fine sandy loam more than 50 m (164 ft) from the pond (NRCS 2012). Nahatche
series includes 30 cm (11 in) of loam over stratified silty clay loam. Kullit series is described as 40
cm (16 in) of very fine sandy loam over clay. Sacul series is described as fine sandy loam 106 cm
(42 in) deep over clay.

Shovel testing in the project area was similar to the series description in texture and depth
in the Nahatche and Kullit series areas, but the depths to the subsoil were less than soil descriptions
in the Sacul soil area. A total of 17 shovel tests were excavated in the project area (Table 1).
Shovel test depth in the project area ranged from 10 cm (4 in) of red clay near the southwest corner
of the project area to 40 cm (16 in) of light yellowish brown sandy loam near the middle of the
project area. The soil colors and texture are similar; however, the difference between the NRCS
description and the shovel testing effort is most likely the result of modern disturbance to the area
to create a level surface for the park.

No cultural material was found in shovel testing. No

archaeological sites were documented as a result of the shovel testing.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The proposed Fair Park improvements project includes adding six activity areas, grading
improvements, construction of a fountain, developing ADA access, installing sidewalks and
benches, and improving existing activity areas, i.e., repainting existing activity areas and
installing new basketball goals.

Previous investigations and documentation of historical

buildings and properties in Pittsburg recorded one archaeological site roughly 100 m (330 ft)
west of the project area and several historical buildings more than 330 m (1000 ft) south of the
project area. A total of 17 shovel tests found soil 10 to 40 cm (4 and 16 in) deep in clay and
sandy loam soils over clay. No cultural materials were recovered from the shovel testing or
observed during the surface inspection. No new cultural resources were documented and no
cultural material was collected during the survey.
Based on the shovel test results and the visual examination, there is little chance of
encountering undiscovered cultural resources in the project area; however, in the event that
human remains and/or archaeological materials are discovered during construction, then the
project activity will immediately cease and the Texas Historical Commission shall be notified of
the discovery. DETAC is requesting a concurrence with the determination of “no effect” on
NRHP eligible properties for the proposed park improvements as defined by the National
Historic Preservation Act.
