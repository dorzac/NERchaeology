Long-Bone Implements from Some Prehistoric
Sites in Texas: Functional Interpretations
Based on Ethnographic Analogy
Grant D. Hall
ABSTRACT
Alternative functions axe proposed for certain implements made from the
long bones of deer, antelope, or bison found at several prehistoric sites in
Texas. These long-bone implements axe often identified as awls or hairpins, but
their use as head scratchers, louse crushers, or sweat scrapers is hypothesized
here. These functional interpretations axe based on analogies drawn from the
ethnographic literature of the American Southwest and California. Variations
in the geometric design patterns incised on the surfaces of some of these
implements suggest that the patterns may have been unique to their prehistoric
owners or perhaps to particular bands or lineages. If this is true, future tracking
of the occurrence of the decorative patterns from site to site in Texas may yield
information on the movements of individuals and bands, the social organization
of bands, and intergroup relationships.

INTRODUCTION
Because of their shapes, long bones from deer, antelope, and bison are
particularly well suited for the manufacture of certain artifacts, most commonly
ones called awls or awllike tools by archeologists. As Hough (1907:120) has
noted concerning the function of awls,
the awl was used to make perforations through which thread of
sinew or other sewing material was passed when skins for
moccasins, clothing, tents, etc., were sewed, and in quillwork,
beadwork, and basketwork. Other uses for awls were for making holes for pegs in woodwork, as a gauge in canoe-making,
for shredding sinew, for graving, etc. Various awllike implements that were used by the Indians in weaving and making
pottery, as pins for robes, as head-scratchers, pipe-picks, blood
pins for closing wounds in game to save the blood, marrowextractors, forks, corn-huskers, etc., have sometimes been
classed as awls.
Prehistoric people in many areas of Texas worked long bones into a variety
of implements and ornaments. This study is concerned with long-bone artifacts
that are often called awls, hairpins, or basket- or mat-weaving tools and especially with one class of these artifacts, which have relatively blunt tips. There
may have been other functions for these blunt-tipped tools.

DESCRIPTION OF THE IMPLEMENTS

Most of the specimens in this study are made from metapodial bones of
deer, but antelope or bison also may be represented. All of the implements
discussed here were made by splitting long bones into two symmetrical pieces
that were then worked by abrasion into long, tapering artifacts. In horizontal
cross section, these implements vary from essentially flat, to gently planoconvex, to subcircular, depending on the intended function and the location on the
tool of the cross section. The proximal end of the split long bone is usually only
lightly modified. The proximal articular surface is usually ground down to some
extent, but its original contours remain apparent. The distal end is worked into a
tip that ranges between very sharply pointed and rounded. Reflecting the morphology of the long bone, the tip is sometimes slightly upturned, but, except for
this, all signs of the articular surface are completely obliterated. The specimens
are between 8 and 22 cm long, between 1 and 3 cm wide, and between 0.5 and 1
cm thick. Some of the implements are perforated at the broader proximal end,
and some are decorated on the exterior (convex) surface with incised geometric
designs.
INFERRED FUNCTIONS
In the Texas archeological literature, artifact functions have most often been
inferred from their shapes, supported (usually tacitly) by ethnographic analogy,
and, to a lesser extent, by context. Specimens with sharp, slender points would
be useful for punching holes and are, not unreasonably, called awls. Polished
areas or striations, presumably signs of wear resulting from use, are sometimes
detectable and reinforce the notion that some of the implements did indeed
function as awls. However, long-bone implements found near skulls in graves
provide contextual evidence for an alternative view that the artifacts functioned
as hairpins. A third hypothesized function--supported mainly by ethnographic
analogy--is for weaving baskets or mats.
LONG-BONE IMPLEMENTS FROM TEXAS SITES

A representative sample comprising 118 complete long-bone implements
from sites in Texas (Figure 1) has been sorted according to morphological characteristics, contextual information, or postulated function. The specimens are
categorized as implements with the sharp, slender points characteristic of awllike
tools (Table 1), a smaller group that were thought to have functioned as hairpins
based on their locations in the graves from which they were recovered (Table 2),
and the largest group of artifacts, with tips that vary from narrow and pointed to
rounded (Table 3). These specimens differ from most of those in Table 1 in that
the tips are flat or convex in cross section, and, although it is technically accurate to describe them as pointed, their tips are not nearly as slender or sharp as
those of the awllike tools (Table 1). The bluntness of the tips of these tools did
not result from use wear; they were intentionally worked into this shape (Figures 2 to 7).

*Implements from the Shumla Caves and the McCann site have incised
decorations but are not illustrated here. The three decorated Shumla Cave
specimens have simple diagonal lines or criss-crossed lines incised over small
areas of their proximal (broad) ends. The specimen from the McCann site has a
simple zig-zag line pattern running most of its length. The scale published with
the illustration of the McCann specimen indicates that it is only about 7 cm
long, but it is possible that the scale is incorrect.

aThe total of 72 does not take into account 40 implements represented by
fragments (Hall 1981:235-236).
bDecorated implements from the Leonard K and Blue Bayou sites are not
illustrated here. The two specimens from the Leonard K site have elaborate
design patterns, but are too decomposed to be drawn accurately. The Blue Bayou
specimen has one line incised across its proximal (broad) end.

ETHNOGRAPHIC CORRELATES
The inferred identifications of the awls (Table 1) are accepted here as
correct. However, the relatively blunt tips of other specimens (Tables 2 and 3)
rendered them useless for piercing holes in tough materials such as hide, leather,
or plant fiber. In pursuing the idea that long-bone implements, especially those
with fairly blunt tips (Table 3), may have functioned as hairpins or mat- or
basket-weaving tools, a survey of the Handbook of North American Indians
(Heizer 1978, Ortiz 1983, DâAzevedo 1986) and several other ethnographic
sources indicated that the tool most often used in basket-making has a sharp,
slender point capable of perforating the fiber coils of baskets (Spier 1978:475,
Bowen 1983:241, Roessel 1983:601, Aikens and Madsen 1986:156, Cain and
Farmer 1981:84). The tools illustrated in these sources are of bone and are
shaped much like awllike artifacts (Table 1). Cactus spines (Fowler and Dawson

1986: 720) and metal awls (Cain and Farmer 1981: 84) are also documented for
the same purpose. In their mention of bone awls, Aikens and Madsen (1986:156)
note that these are suitable for perforating both leather and basketry coils.
A specimen very similar to the blunt-tipped tools (Table 3) is illustrated in
Volume 10 of the Handbook of North American Indians (Schwartz 1983:21).
Made from a long bone, it is decorated on one face with geometric, anthropomorphic, and zoomorphic designs. The reverse is decorated only with geometric
designs. The specimen is perforated at the proximal end and a leather thong is
knotted through the hole. Collected from a Yuman group in the Southwest, the
specimen is identified as a scratcher.
Other bone implements identified as head scratchers, louse crushers, hairpins, hair ornaments, or sweat scrapers are described and illustrated in other
ethnographic and archeological sources for the Southwest and California (Wallace 1978:173; Loud 1918:Plate 20; Heye 1921:3, 94-97; Gifford 1940; Ragir
1972:66-67; Hester 1974:Figure 6). Although these specimens vary considerably from bipointed to subrectangular, some are shaped much like the bluntpointed specimens in this study (Table 3) (see especially Heye 1921). The
subrectangular to rectangular specimens illustrated by Heye and identified as
louse crushers are reminiscent of bone implements found at several Late Prehistoric sites in Texas; Huebner (1987:6-15) has suggested that such rectangular
bone implements functioned as fleshing tools. Hester (1974) has reported on a
decorated long-bone implement from western Nevada, which he speculates may
have functioned as a sweat scraper, or strigil. Ragir (1972:66) illustrates a
similar specimen, also identified as a sweat scraper, from a site yielding Archaic
remains in California.
Wing and Brown (1979:104-105) discuss bone implements called husking
pins that were used by prehistoric and early historic farming peoples in North
America and Mesoamerica for shucking corn. The specimens illustrated by
Wing and Brown are in some cases identical to the blunt-tipped artifacts in this
study (Table 3), except that they lack decoration.
Most striking is the fact that many of the specimens illustrated in these
sources have incised geometric designs on the convex faces and are perforated at
one end. The sources specifically mention that females, both those involved in
menarche rituals (Teit 1900:311-14; Swanton 1910:314-15; Elsasser 1978:196;
Wallace 1978:172-3; Loud 1918:383) and postpartum females (Kelly 1978:
421) used bone head scratchers to touch their bodies (when scratching, eating,
etc.) in compliance with taboos against touching themselves with their fingers at
these times. These were apparently items that everyone would need now and
again, but the sources do not specifically state that everyone was equipped with
a head scratcher or louse crusher.

TEXAS LONG-BONE IMPLEMENTS
AS HEAD SCRATCHERS OR LOUSE CRUSHERS
On the basis of the ethnographic data from the Southwest and California, it
is proposed that use as head scratchers or louse crushers be added to the list of
possible functions for the blunt or flat-tipped long-bone implements (Tables 2
and 3). These newly proposed functions do not preclude concurrent service of
long-bone implements as hairpins or sweat scrapers, since both of these functions are also indicated for such tools in the ethnographic record.
Considering the presumed hunter-gatherer subsistence orientation of prehistoric peoples represented by the long-bone specimens in this study, it is not
likely that they used the implements for husking maize.
Referring back to the blunt and flat-tipped specimens (Tables 2 and 3), how
do the proposed functions agree with the available contextual information? All
three of the long bone implements listed in Table 2 were found in burials beside
or beneath the skulls, and, as already noted, are suggested by their respective
analysts to be hairpins or, in one case, a weaving implement. Most of the flattiped specimens listed in Table 3 also came from burial contexts. This is largely
because many specimens were recovered from Late Archaic cemeteries in Texas,
especially at the Albert George and Ernest Witte sites.
At the Albert George and Ernest Witte sites, which together yielded at least
95 specimens, the contextual distribution is decidedly postcranial. Only three
burials at Ernest Witte had long-bone implements positioned around the skulls.
Further confounding the issue, such implements, together with other types of
bone artifacts made from limb bones, were found in stacks or side-by-side in
echelon. All of the Albert George site specimens were found together in one
such cache (Walley 1955:233), and at the Ernest Witte site, seven stacks of bone
implements were found and account for most of the recovered specimens (Hall
1981:225-30). The graves of at least 14 individuals in the Group 2 component at
the Ernest Witte site were furnished with long-bone implements. Of further
significance is the fact that all long-bone artifacts (in fact, all bone artifacts) in
the Group 2 Ernest Witte component were associated with individuals more than
20 years old. An analysis of the Crestmont burials revealed that the grave of one
individual 13 to 14.5 years old was furnished with bone implements (Vernon, in
press). At Green Lake (Wingate and Hester 1972), Brandes (Highley et al.
1988), and Olmos Dam (Lukowski 1988), long-bone implements were found
around the skulls.
The contextual data from many of the sites therefore support the hairpin or
head scratcher functions proposed for the long-bone implements. However, the
strong contextual information from the Albert George and Ernest sites does not.
Is it possible to reconcile the contextual data with the hypothesized hairpin/head
scratcher/louse crusher functions? Single specimens with perforated ends found
in the upper torso areas of skeletons may have been attached to clothing or
suspended from the neck so that they would have been close at hand when head

scratching or louse crushing needs arose. Stacks of long-bone implements may
represent personal tool kits containing different types of tools intended for a
variety of functions. Alternatively, the stacks may be aggregates of individual
memorial tokens contributed as grave furnishings by survivors participating in
the funeral ceremonies. The last two alternatives neither confirm nor deny the
functional speculations made about the implements.
DECORATIONS ON LONG-BONE IMPLEMENTS
Geometric designs are incised into about 10 percent of the long-bone
implements from 10 prehistoric sites in Texas (Figures 2 to 7); they comprise
almost all of the incised specimens known to the author. Remarkably, no design
pattern is repeated among the 36 known specimens, but variations on certain
decorative themes are apparent. It is possible that study of the design elements
and themes on the decorated specimens will yield insights into social relationships among the individuals or bands responsible for their manufacture. For
example, did certain kin groups use variations on a particular geometric theme?
If so, a study similar to the work done with designs on Arikara pottery in the
Northern Plains (Deetz 1965) might prove fruitful.
As an example of how such a study of decorative themes might proceed,
attention is called to three sets of design patterns found at the Albert George,
Ernest Witte, and Crestmont sites (Figure 8). One group of similar patterns--a
zigzag, or lightning bolt--is represented by specimens from the Albert George
(Figure 2: A, E) and Crestmont (Figure 6: B) sites. A second group--the
diamond pattern (Figures 3, E and 6, C)--also involves the same two sites. A
third style of design links the Albert George and Ernest Witte sites (Figures 3, A
and 4, A) and could be described as a band/crisscross pattern. It is suggested that
tracking of the occurrence of these patterns as new specimens are found in the
future will yield useful insights into the movements and social structure of the
band represented by the specimens.
Not all of the long-bone implements have incised decorations; this observation may be significant. At the Ernest Witte site, only about 10 percent of the
implements have the incised decorations. Did a person need to reach a certain
age, achieve a certain status, or accomplish some other milestone in life to be
eligible for a personalized design pattern? The ritual/ceremonial uses recorded
for head scratchers in the Southwest suggest that the implements, with or
without designs, may be symbolic of particular conditions or status rather than
purely functional objects. At the Ernest Witte site, bone implements were
distributed about equally between males and females. As previously noted at the
Ernest Witte site, there was a definite lower age limit for association with bone
implements as grave furnishings. All those who had them were over 20 years old
at the time of death. This strong age-discriminant pattern is slightly confounded
by the findings at the Crestmont site, where a teenager was accompanied by such
artifacts. If the implements were indeed contributed by survivors, the tools and
their characteristics may be saying more about the survivors than about the deceased.

CONCLUSION

The ethnographic data reviewed here support the contention that the sharply
pointed long-bone implements (Table 1) were used as awls. In this capacity they
could have served several hole-punching needs, including the perforation of
fiber coils in basket making. The blunt- or fiat-ended specimens (Tables 2 and 3)
are too dull to have functioned well as awls and were more likely to have been
used principally as hairpins, head scratcher/louse crushers, or sweat scrapers
In addition to the proposal concerning some other functions, there is a
possibility of exclusivity in the usage of design patterns on the long-bone
implements. The data suggest that ownership (or, at least, inclusion as burial
furnishings) was restricted to adults and, possibly, later adolescents, suggesting
that social identity developed late in the second decade of life for these groups.
Finally, it is speculated that the design patterns may have been band-, lineage-,
or person-specific and that the use of these patterns survived the individuals who
commissioned them. The contention that design patterns are specific to persons
or bands is the most tenuous of the propositions presented here, but it can be
tested when additional data are recovered.
