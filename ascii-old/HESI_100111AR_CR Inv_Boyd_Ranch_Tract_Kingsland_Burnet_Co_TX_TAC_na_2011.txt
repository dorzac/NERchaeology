MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

In January 2011, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted cultural
resources investigations within the proposed 17.0-acre Boyd Ranch Residential Subdivision
Tract near Kingsland in Burnet County, Texas (Project Area). The investigations consisted of
both an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel testing efforts and mechanical trenching efforts.
Although the undertaking will be privately funded and is located on private property, the
development of the property within the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) jurisdictional
areas will require a USACE-issued Section 404 permit. As such, development of the Project
Area within the USACE jurisdictional areas is regulated by Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. Horizon conducted the cultural resources
investigations at the request of Sam Boyd Development in compliance with Section 106 of the
NHPA. The purpose of the investigations was to determine if any archeological sites were
located within the USACE jurisdictional areas and, if any existed, to determine their eligibility for
inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The initial pedestrian survey of the Project Area resulted in the documentation of 1 new
prehistoric archeological site. Site 41BT450 was documented as a prehistoric campsite
evidenced by sparse amounts of lithic debitage and mussel shell fragments on a small
peninsula adjacent to the Colorado River. Because the site’s location suggests the potential for
deeply buried cultural deposits, Horizon archeologists also excavated 3 backhoe trenches
across the site and 1 additional backhoe trench on an adjacent knoll within a similar setting in
the Project Area. These backhoe trenches revealed generally sparse cultural deposits within
the boundaries of site 41BT450 and no evidence of cultural materials on the adjacent knoll. Of
the 3 trenches excavated on site 41BT450, only 1 (Backhoe Trench [BHT]-2) produced
evidence of a cultural feature, consisting of a small pit containing freshwater mussel shells
surrounded by a scatter of fire-cracked rock. While this feature indicates that the site’s
inhabitants participated in a “clam bake” at some point in prehistory, no temporally diagnostic
implements capable of placing the site within a particular cultural period were recovered during
the investigations. Similarly, no radiocarbon datable plant remains were encountered within the
feature or in any other location on the site. Aside from freshwater mussel shell fragments, the
site was found to be lacking in preserved floral and faunal remains. Due to the sparse nature of
the cultural materials on site 41BT450, the lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts, and the
observed lack of floral/faunal preservation, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41BT450 is ineligible
for inclusion on the NRHP and that no additional investigations are warranted on this site.

Management Summary

Based on the results of the cultural resources investigations, it is Horizon’s opinion that
the undertaking will have no impact on cultural resources considered to be eligible for inclusion
on the NRHP. Horizon therefore recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for
the undertaking. However, in the unlikely event that human remains or burial features are
encountered during the development of the Project Area, even within previously assessed
areas, all construction efforts at the location of the find should cease and the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) and the USACE should be notified immediately.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of a cultural resources investigations survey of the US
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) jurisdictional areas within the proposed 17.0-acre Boyd
Ranch Residential Subdivision Tract near Kingsland, in Burnet County, Texas (Project Area;
Figures 1 and 2). The proposed undertaking consists of the development of the Project Area
into a lake-side residential subdivision composed of residential lots, associated roadways, and a
navigable canal. Although the undertaking is privately funded and located on private property,
the development of the Project Area within the USACE jurisdictional areas will require a Section
404 permit issued by the USACE. As such, development of the Project Area within the USACE
jurisdictional areas is regulated by Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA)
of 1966, as amended. Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted the cultural
resources investigations at the request of the Sam Boyd Development in compliance with
Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the investigations was to determine if any
archeological sites were located within the USACE jurisdictional areas and, if any existed, to
determine their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The cultural resources investigations consisted of an archival review, an intensive
pedestrian survey, mechanical trenching efforts, and the production of a report suitable for
review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas
Historical Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and
the Council of Texas Archeologists’ (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management
Reports. Reymundo Chapa (Horizon staff archeologist) served as the project’s Principal
Investigator. Michael Mudd (Horizon archeological field technician) conducted the initial
pedestrian survey of the Project Area. Reymundo Chapa supervised the mechanical trenching
efforts conducted by himself, Jared Wiersema, Michael Mudd, and Russ Brownlow (Horizon’s
cultural resources director).
Horizon conducted the initial pedestrian survey over the Project Area on 5 January 2011.
This entailed intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing efforts. The Texas
State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 1 shovel test
per 2 acres on acreage projects between 11 and 100 acres in size. As such, a minimum of 9
shovel tests were required within the 17.0-acre Project Area. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS
by excavating a total of 13 shovel tests across the Project Area.

Chapter 1.0: Introduction

The initial pedestrian survey of the Project Area resulted in the documentation of 1 new
prehistoric archeological site. Site 41BT450 was documented as a prehistoric campsite
evidenced by sparse amounts of lithic debitage and mussel shell fragments on a small
peninsula adjacent to the Colorado River. Because the site’s location adjacent to the Colorado
River suggested the potential for deeply buried cultural deposits, Horizon archeologists also
excavated 3 backhoe trenches across the site and 1 additional backhoe trench within a similar
setting on an adjacent knoll.
These backhoe trenches revealed generally sparse cultural deposits within the
boundaries of site 41BT450 and no evidence of cultural materials on the adjacent knoll. Of the
3 backhoe trenches excavated on site 41BT450, only 1 produced evidence of a cultural feature.
This feature consisted of a small pit containing freshwater mussel shells surrounded by a scatter
of fire-cracked rock. While the feature indicates that the site’s inhabitants participated in a “clam
bake” as some point in prehistory, no temporally diagnostic implements were recovered during
the investigations that would have allowed for the placement of the site within a particular
cultural period. Similarly, no radiocarbon-datable plant remains were encountered within the
feature or in any other location on the site. Aside from freshwater mussel shell fragments, the
site was found to be lacking in preserved floral and faunal remains. Due to the sparse nature of
the cultural materials on site 41BT450, the lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts, and the

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The overall Project Area consists of an approximately 17.0-acre tract located on the west
bank of a segment of the Colorado River, approximately 5.8 kilometers (km) (3.6 miles)
northeast of Kingsland, in Burnet County, Texas (Project Area; Figures 1 and 2). More
specifically, the Project Area is located 1.4 km (0.9 miles) west of Farm to Market Road (FM)
2342, just off of County Road (CR) 34. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS)
7.5’ Kingsland, Texas, topographic quadrangle (see Figure 1). The proposed undertaking
consists of the development of the Project Area into a lake-side residential subdivision
composed of residential lots, associated roadways, and a navigable canal.
The USACE jurisdictional areas within the Project Area consist of the banks of an
unnamed drainage that flows northeast-to-southwest through the middle of the property and the
east bank of a segment of the Colorado River (Figure 3). An artificial pond has been
constructed in the northeast portion of the Project Area, along the eastern bank of a bend
created by the unnamed drainage (Figure 4). The USACE jurisdictional areas were considered
those within 60.0 meters (m) (200.0 feet [ft]) of the jurisdictional drainage and areas along the
elevated bank of the Colorado River.

2.2

CURRENT LAND USE

The overall Project Area consists of a manicured lawn with large live oak and pecan
trees. An improved road enters the Project Area in the northeastern corner and divides into 2
roads. One of these runs south along the Project Area’s eastern boundary and leads to a
homestead just outside the southern boundary of the Project Area. Another segment of the
improved road heads west to a small guesthouse located just outside the northern boundary of
the Project Area. That segment of the road crosses over an improved bridge that has been
constructed over a segment of the unnamed drainage. After crossing the drainage, the road is
no longer improved; it becomes a 2-track road that offers access to the western portion of the
Project Area. Much of the unnamed drainage located in the central portion of the Project Area
has been improved with cement and cobble-stone walls. On-site photographs are provided in
Figures 3 through 6.

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The topography of the Project Area is dominated by gently rolling hills that slope in an
east-to-west direction toward the Colorado River (see Figure 1). Surface elevation ranges from
approximately 330.7 to 338.6 meters above mean sea level (840.0 to 860.0 feet above mean
sea level). The Project Area is in the Lake LBJ watershed on the Colorado River, with surface
water flow from east to west over most of the site, typically by overland sheet flow and unnamed
tributaries of Lake LBJ (COA 1998). An unnamed drainage flows northeast-to-southwest
through the middle of the property, and the Colorado River delineates the Project Area’s entire
western boundary. The confluence of the unnamed drainage and the Colorado River in the
southwestern-most portion of the Project Area create a small north-south oriented peninsula in
the western Project Area.

2.4

GEOLOGY AND SOILS

A review of existing literature shows that the Project Area is underlain by the Glen Rose
geologic formation and the Glen Rose Corbula bed (UT-BEG 1981). The Corbula bed is
described as the lower part of the Glen Rose and is about 160 feet thick with abundant
steinkerns of Corbula harveyi in intervals up to 5 feet thick. The Glen Rose geologic formation
is described as relatively impermeable and as the lower confining unit of the Edwards Aquifer. It
has a maximum thickness of about 350 to 500 feet. Stair-step topography is characteristic of
the upper member of the Glen Rose Limestone. The Upper Glen Rose Limestone is described
as yellowish-tan, thinly bedded limestone and marl (Garner and Young 1976). The upper
member of the Glen Rose Limestone is relatively more thinly bedded, more dolomitic, and less
fossiliferous than the lower member of the Glen Rose Limestone. The top of the upper member
of the Glen Rose Limestone is red-stained, lumpy, irregular, and bored, with oysters cemented
onto the surface (Rose 1972).
Soil within the Project Area is listed in Table 1 and presented in Figure 7 (NRCS 2011):

VEGETATION

The Project Area is situated within the Edwards Plateau vegetational area of Texas
(Gould 1975). Natural vegetation within the area of the Project Area typically includes Ashe
juniper (Juniperus ashei), plateau live oak (Quercus fusiformis), bermuda grass (Cynodon
dactylon), Texas grama (Boutelouna rigidiseta), purple threeawn (Aristida purpurea), immature
honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), twist leaf yucca (Yucca rupicola), flame-leaf sumac
(Rhus lanceolata), agarita (Berberis trifoliate), and willow baccharis (Baccharis negelecta).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The archeological record of Central Texas spans the known cultural-historical sequence:
Paleo-Indian, 11,200 to 8000 BP; Archaic, 8000 to 1400 BP; and Late Prehistoric, 1400 to 400
BP. A brief breakdown of this general sequence is presented below.

3.1

PALEO-INDIAN PERIOD (CA. 11,200 TO 8000 BP)

The Paleo-Indian period is believed to be the earliest cultural occupation in the Central
Texas region. This stage is characterized typologically by the occurrence of distinctive
lanceolate projectile points and highly mobile settlement and exploitation patterns. These
populations probably practiced a foraging (i.e., hunting and gathering) type of subsistence
(Prewitt 1981; Weir 1976), although the best-known sites exhibit a focus on the exploitation of
large mammals, including Mammuthus sp. and Bison antiquus. Investigations at sites such as
the Kincaid Rockshelter, Wilson-Leonard, and Gault have shown that, during the early part of
the Paleo-Indian period, the Clovis stage, subsistence included large herbivores (e.g.,
mammoth, bison, and horse) as well as smaller animals such as water turtles, badgers, and
raccoons. A multitude of plants are presumed to have also been an important part of the
aboriginal diet. However, during the later part of the Paleo-Indian period, the Folsom and
Plainview stages, subsistence seems to have depended more heavily on the specialized
hunting of big game, particularly bison. This presumption is based on the fact that only camps,
stone-working locations, and kill sites, mostly in or near grassland habitats, have been
documented (Collins 1995:382). This change was most likely attributable to the climate, which
had become warmer and drier than the previous Clovis stage.

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8000 TO 1400 BP)

The Archaic period, which covers 2/3 of Central Texas prehistory (Collins 1995), is
divided into 3 subperiods: Early (8000 to 5000 BP), Middle (5000 to 3000 BP), and Late (3000
to 1200 BP) (Hester 1986). The beginning of the Archaic period in Texas represents a similar
transition found world-wide at approximately the same time, the most noted indicators being the
extinction of Pleistocene megafauna and climatic changes. In Texas, there was a gradual
decrease in moisture and humidity reflecting the intensification of warming and drying trends
first noted during the Clovis-Folsom transition. An often-quoted response to these climatic
changes was a greater and more varied use of local resources; in actuality, this was already the
case in most places. Plant-processing implements such as manos and metates and earth
ovens become more evident in the archeological record, while the hunting of game continued.

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Although still nomadic, people of the Archaic period restricted their travel to smaller areas than
did the Paleo-Indian groups.

3.3

EARLY ARCHAIC (8000 TO 5000 BP)

The Early Archaic, the least understood period, is distinguished by the switch from
Paleo-Indian lanceolate-shaped points to notched-and-stemmed points. Overall, the Early
Archaic patterns in Texas are fairly similar throughout the state. Hester (1989) observed that,
prior to 5000 BP, the late Holocene hunters and foragers were essentially indistinguishable in
terms of subsistence strategies across Region 3, which includes the Central Texas Plateau
Prairie, South Texas Plains, and Lower Pecos Canyon lands. After that date, regionally
distinctive projectile points emerge. Hughes (1991) also noted similarities when he wrote that
the Early Archaic typological developments on the Texas High Plains resembled developments
in Central and Southwestern Texas as well as in other bordering regions.
Although settlement patterns for the Early Archaic are little known, it is assumed that the
population density was low and organized into small bands practicing a mobile, generalized
subsistence and settlement pattern. The wide distribution of artifacts suggests that mobility was
high and territories relatively undefined. McKinney (1981), among others, has noted that the
distribution of Early Archaic sites was apparently concentrated along the Balcones Escarpment.
This phenomenon may possibly reflect the greater availability of water resources along this
feature during an arid climatic interval (Hester 1989).
Sites containing Early Archaic components are open campsites such as Loeve, WilsonLeonard, Richard Beene, Sleeper, Landslide, Granberg II, Jetta Court, and Hall’s Cave. Lithic
materials found within these components include grinding implements, hammerstones, projectile
points, a variety of unifacial and bifacial chipped stone instruments, and Clear Fork and
Guadalupe bifaces. The Clear Fork tools, although indicative primarily of the Early Archaic,
actually appeared in the Late Paleo-Indian period and, in some regions, lingered into Late
Archaic and Late Prehistoric times (Hughes 1991).

3.4

MIDDLE ARCHAIC (5000 TO 3000 BP)

The Middle Archaic period is marked by an increased number of sites, which may reflect
an expanding population, the development of regionally distinct cultural patterns, and changes
in settlement, technology, social systems, and territorial boundaries (Black and McGraw
1985:38). Hester (1986) suggests that, during this period, the inhabitants of the Balcones
Escarpment region developed specialized adaptations to the hunting and gathering of abundant
regional resources, particularly acorns and white-tailed deer.
Site types include open campsites located near streams or tributaries, lithic workshops in
upland areas, and special-activity sites such as hunting camps or food-processing stations
(Black and McGraw 1985). Large burned rock features (hearths and rock ovens) of the early
part of the Middle Archaic gave way in the later Middle Archaic to burned rock middens (Collins
1995).
These latter features have been interpreted as representing several different
subsistence practices. For example, Hester (1986) proposed that they represent intensive

12

Cultural Resources Investigations within the Proposed 17.0-Acre Boyd Ranch Residential Subdivision
Tract, Kingsland, Burnet County, Texas

utilization of acorns, while Johnson and Goode (1994:26) suggested that they were more
frequently being used to cook xerophytes such as sotol. This latter explanation has been
supported by a number of recent investigations where evidence of preserved camas bulbs has
been recovered within oven and midden contexts (Brownlow 2003, 2004a, 2004b; Bush 2004;
Dering 1999, 2002; Mauldin et al. 2003; Ricklis and Collins 1994). Middle Archaic projectile
points include Nolan, Travis, Langtry, and Pedernales (Black 1989), the latter of which is
considered by Hester (1986) to be diagnostic of this time period in the Balcones Escarpment
region.

3.5

LATE ARCHAIC (3000 TO 1400 BP)

The Late Archaic period is represented by a continuation, and possibly intensification, of
the subsistence patterns seen in the Middle Archaic (Hester 1986; Collins 1995). The use of
burned rock midden sites continued throughout the Middle Archaic, peaking during the latter
part of this period (Collins 1995). Large cemetery sites are first noted during the Late Archaic
and may reflect the establishment of territories and subsistence schedules (Black 1989:30;
Black and McGraw 1985; Story 1985:49). Hester (1986) suggests that the development of
wide-ranging trade contacts also may have occurred around this time. Characteristic projectile
points include triangular types such as Lange, Montell, Castroville, and Marcos, along with
smaller, expanding-stem points such as Ensor, Frio, Darl, and Fairland.
Although Hester (1986) places the Late Archaic between 3000 and 1400 BP, a later
carving of the Archaic period by Johnson and Goode (1994) attempts to push back the initiation
point of the Late Archaic to around 4300 BP. This more recent division is based on what is
seen as a strong continuity between the material culture and subsistence practices of groups
utilizing the Pedernales point style and those utilizing the later Montell point style. Primarily,
Johnson and Goode (1994) point to similarities in the blade shape of these 2 styles, as well as
similar large, billet-thinned knives utilized during the times of these point styles. They also note
the continuance of Pedernales period plant baking within existing burned rock middens by later
groups utilizing Montell points. In fact, they view this continuity as evidence of a distinct culture
or “folk” on the eastern Edwards Plateau.
In addition to attempting to push back the initiation date of the Late Archaic period,
Johnson and Goode (1994) have also attempted to further divide the Late Archaic period into 2
subperiods (Late Archaic I and Late Archaic II) based on the material cultures as well as climatic
conditions. Their Late Archaic I subperiod coincides with the Dry Edwards Interval when xeric
conditions persisted between 4300 and 2600 BP. Diagnostic projectile points of this subperiod
include the Bulverde, Pedernales, Marshall, Montell, and Castroville styles. The Lange style
may also correspond to this subperiod based on the recovery of Lange specimens in
association with both Montell and Castroville specimens at 41WM815 and dated between 2800
to 2400 BP (Brownlow 2003). Johnson and Goode (1994:34) note that burned rock middens on
the Edwards Plateau during the Late Archaic I subperiod are more frequent than in any other
period. The increase in burned rock middens during this subperiod is undoubtedly a result of
the xeric climatic conditions that effectively expanded the ranges of certain geophytes such as
sotol and yucca: foodstuffs that require extended baking periods (in stone-lined ovens) in order

to break down their starches into edible simple sugars. The xeric conditions likely resulted in
the spread of grasslands on the plateau, which in turn would have attracted herds of buffalo.
Plentiful geophytic plants, as well as the presence of buffalo herds, may account for an increase
in human populations in the region as well (Weir 1976; Prewitt 1985).
Johnson and Goode’s (1994) Late Archaic II subperiod spans the time period between
2600 and 1400 BP. They equate this subperiod to more mesic climatic conditions that resulted
in the active aggradation of floodplains at many localities. The Marcos, Ensor, Frio, and Darl
dart point styles are viewed as indicators of this subperiod. Observing a break in the broad
blade stylistic tradition suggested for the Pedernales and Montell styles, Johnson and Goode
(1994:37) suggest that similarities in the Marcos-style dart points to styles on the Southern
Plains may indicate an influx of new occupants from the Southern Plains or perhaps a borrowing
of projectile-making techniques from this region. In addition to a perceived influx of new people
or technologies, Johnson and Goode (1994) also suggest some degree of social intercourse
with groups from the eastern US. This is evidenced by the recovery of materials such as whelk
shells and atlatl weights of exotic stone from burials dating to this time period. Although not
conclusive, Johnson and Goode (1994:37) suggest that these materials may indicate a
spreading of Eastern religious cult ideas into the region. While it cannot be conclusively stated
that groups on the Edwards Plateau subscribed to the beliefs and practices of the Eastern
religions, the evidence does suggest that groups on the plateau participated in extensive trading
with Eastern groups, primarily contributing large, thin corner-tanged knives made from local
Edwards chert.

3.6

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1400 TO 400 BP)

The Late Prehistoric period is separated from the preceding Archaic by the introduction
of the bow and arrow and ceramics. Two phases are recognized within this period: the Austin
(ca. 1400 to 800 BP) and Toyah (ca. 800 to 400 BP) phases. The Austin phase is characterized
by the transition from the use of the atlatl and dart to that of the bow and arrow and arrow
points, particularly the expanding-stemmed Scallorn type. This phase is also distinguished by a
decline in population and changes in settlement practices, in which there was a shift from open
to protected (rockshelter) sites (Black 1989:32; Collins 1995:385). In spite of these changes,
most archeologists agree that Late Archaic subsistence practices and settlement patterns
appear to have continued during the Austin phase (Black 1989; Collins 1995; Prewitt 1974).
The Toyah phase is characterized by relatively rapid changes in technology, notably
pottery (both local and imported from the Caddo area); large, thin bifaces; Perdiz (contractingstem) arrow points; and prismatic blades (Black 1989; Collins 1995). Limited horticulture may
also have begun during this time. The Toyah tool kit was associated with the hunting of bison,
deer, and antelope, and, although nearly all sites dating to this phase have yielded bison bones,
deer was the most significant faunal resource during this time (Black 1989:32). Evidence for
agriculture is seen in the occasional corn cob found at sites such as the Timmeron Rockshelter
in Hays County. Of course, the corn could also be attributed to the same trade network that
was bringing in the Caddoan pottery.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Archival research conducted via the Internet at the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC)
online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) database indicated the presence of 6 previously
recorded archeological sites within a 1.0-mile radius of the Project Area (THC 2011; Figure 8).
These sites and their distances from the Project Area are summarized in Table 2 below. No
previously recorded archeological sites or cemeteries, including any listed on the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP), are located within or immediately adjacent to the
boundaries of the Project Area. According to the Atlas, no formal cultural resources surveys
have been conducted within or adjacent to the boundaries of the Project Area.

Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial
terraces near stream/river channels or drainages. Based on the location of the Project Area
immediately adjacent to the Colorado River, it was Horizon’s original opinion that there exists a
relatively high potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural resources within the boundaries of
the Project Area.
The lack of any visible structures and other historic-era resources within the boundaries
of the Project Area on the 1967 topographic quadrangle map (USGS 1967) suggests a relatively
low potential for historic-era resources within the boundaries of the Project Area.

5.0 METHODOLOGY

5.1

INTENSIVE PEDESTRIAN SURVEY

A Horizon archeologist completed the initial intensive pedestrian survey of the Project
Area on 5 January 2011. This survey entailed both intensive surface inspection and subsurface
shovel-testing efforts across the 17.0-acre tract. These shovel tests averaged 30.0 centimeters
(cm) (11.8 inches) in diameter, and excavated matrix from each shovel test was passed through
6.0-millimeter (mm) (0.2-inch) hardware mesh. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 1 shovel test per 2 acres for projects measuring
between 11 and 100 acres in size. As such, a minimum of 8 shovel tests were necessary within
the 17.0-acre Project Area. Horizon exceeded the minimum survey standards by excavating a
total of 13 shovel tests across the Project Area.
A selective collection strategy was employed during the survey efforts. All nondiagnostic cultural materials (e.g., burned rock, lithic debitage, etc.) observed on the surface or
within shovel tests were tabulated and described in the field and then subsequently returned to
where they were found. Diagnostic cultural materials (e.g., projectile points, charcoal, etc.) were
to be collected for analysis and further documentation, if present. Field notes were maintained
on terrain, vegetation, soils, land forms, shovel tests, cultural material observed (if any), etc.
Standardized shovel test forms were completed for every shovel test. These forms included
location data, depth, soil type, and notations on any artifacts encountered. Digital photographs
with a photo log were also completed as appropriate. The locations of all shovel tests were
recorded via handheld GPS units utilizing the UTM coordinate system and the NAD 83 map
datum. Shovel test locations are presented in Figure 9 and shovel test data are presented in
Appendix A.

5.2

BACKHOE TRENCHING

On 15 January 2011 Horizon initiated backhoe-trenching efforts within the Project Area
to assess the vertical and horizontal extent of site 41BT450 which initially was located during
the intensive pedestrian survey, as well as to prospect for cultural deposits on an adjacent knoll.
A total of 4 backhoe trenches were excavated in the Project Area using a 90.0-cm- (35.4-inch-)
wide backhoe bucket. These trenches were numbered sequentially from 1 to 4 starting in the
south and working north (Figure 10).

BHT-1 was excavated on a southern slope of the alluvial peninsula on which site
41BT450 is located; BHT-2 and BHT-3 were excavated along the crest of the alluvial peninsula,
in close proximity to the shallow cultural materials that initially evidenced site 41BT450; and
BHT-4 was excavated on an adjacent knoll located approximately 161.0 m (528.2 ft) north of
site 41BT450. All trenches were laid out in a general east-west orientation, and their locations
were recorded via handheld GPS units utilizing the UTM coordinate system and the NAD 83
map datum.

5.3

TEST UNITS

In addition to the 4 backhoe trenches, 50.0-cm-by-50.0-cm (19.7-inch-by-19.7-inch) test
units were excavated into the profiles of BHT-1, BHT-2, and BHT-3. These are labeled as BHT1-1, BHT-2-1, and BHT-3-1, and their numbers correspond with the backhoe trench in which
they were excavated. Levels within each unit were excavated in 10.0-cm (3.9-inch) levels, and
the resulting matrix from each level was passed through 6.0-mm (0.25-inch) hardware mesh.
All cultural materials for these 50.0-cm-by-50.0-cm units were collected for analysis and further
documentation. Detailed notes were maintained for each 10.0-cm (3.9-inch) level on forms
dedicated to the specific purpose of testing. These forms include data on location, depth, soil
type and color, soil color and consistency, as well as observations related to possible cultural
activities, and digital photographs were notated on a photo log. Data recovered during the test
units are presented in Chapter 6.

6.0 RESULTS

The cultural resources investigations conducted within the Project Area resulted in the
documentation of site 41BT450, a prehistoric campsite initially evidenced by sparse amounts of
lithic debitage and mussel shell fragments on a small elevated peninsula at the confluence of
the Colorado River on the west and an unnamed drainage on the east. Unlike much of the
surrounding terrain, which is composed of Precambrian Town Mountain Granite and Pleistocene
and Holocene terrace deposits, this particular area is composed of Holocene alluvial sand and
silt (Stoeser et al. in press). Because the site is located within deposits that hold an increased
likelihood for containing deeply buried cultural deposits, Horizon archeologists conducted
mechanical trenching efforts across the highest point of the peninsula and on an adjacent knoll
located within a similar setting. The trenching investigations on the adjacent knoll did not
produce any evidence of cultural deposits. Trenching investigations on site 41BT450 served to
better assess the sparse cultural deposits on this site. Site 41BT450 is described in detail
below.

6.1

SITE 41BT450

General Description
Site 41BT450 was documented as a prehistoric campsite on a small knoll at the
confluence of the Colorado River and one of its tributaries (Figures 11 through 13; see also
Figure 6). Site 41BT450 is defined primarily by 2 separate components: 1) a low-density lithic
scatter confined almost exclusively to the site’s surface or to soils no deeper than 40.0
centimeters below surface (cmbs) (15.7 inches), and 2) cultural feature consisting of a small pit
containing freshwater mussel shells surrounded by a scatter of fire-cracked rock approximately
140.0 cmbs (55.1 inches) (Feature 1). Besides Feature 1, no other features were observed on
the site’s surface or in any of the shovel tests. A total of 8 shovel tests were excavated over the
peninsula containing site 41BT450, and 3 shovel tests were excavated on an adjacent knoll just
north of site 41BT450. Of the 8 shovel tests excavated on the peninsula, 6 produced evidence
of subsurface cultural materials at depths between 0 and 100.0 cmbs (0 and 39.4 inches). The
3 shovel tests excavated on the adjacent knoll produced no evidence of cultural materials.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Deposits
Based on the observed surface and subsurface materials, the horizontal extent of site
41BT450 is approximately 65.0 m (213.3 ft) north-south by 40.0 m (131.2 ft) east-west.

Chapter 6.0: Results

Figure 13. General view of site 41BT450 looking south
Three backhoe trenches were excavated on site 41BT450 and 1 backhoe trench was
excavated on an adjacent knoll. Based on these backhoe trenches and 6 positive shovel tests,
the vertical extent of site 41BT450 is approximately 170.0 cm (66.9 inches) deep, with the
majority of cultural material located between 0 and 40.0 cmbs (0 and 15.7 inches) and 120.0
and 170.0 cmbs (47.2 and 66.9 inches). Although only a sparse collection of cultural material
was observed in the soils between these 2 notable concentrations, enough exists to suggest at
least sparse occupations throughout those levels. This evidence amounts to 1 secondary flake
made of fine-grained chert located within a positive shovel test at 90.0 to 100.0 cmbs (35.4 to
39.3 inches) and 2 fire-cracked rocks located within the north profile of BHT-2 at 90.0 cmbs
(35.4 inches).
BHT-1, BHT-2, and BHT-3 measured 7.0 m (23.0 ft), 11.0 (36.0 ft), and 9.06 (29.5 ft) in
length respectively, and were excavated to an average depth of 1.6 m (5.2 ft). BHT-4 measured
5.0 m (16.4 ft) in length and was excavated to an average depth of 1.4 m (4.6 ft). A photograph
of trenching efforts is presented in Figure 14, and profile drawings of the 4 backhoe trenches
are presented in Figures 15 thru 18. Of the 4 backhoe trenches excavated within the Project
Area, only BHT-2 revealed cultural material (see Figure 17).
BHT-4 encountered heavily disturbed soils caused by recent clearing activities. As such,
no test unit was excavated into its profile because the research potential for such efforts would
have been minimal at best. Likewise, of test units BHT-1-1, BHT-2-1, and BHT-3-1, only BHT2-1 revealed cultural materials.

Cultural Features
The only observed cultural feature on site 41BT450 is a small pit feature containing and
surrounded by a scatter of burned rock, freshwater clam shells and chert fragments (Feature 1).
Feature 1 is located approximately 140.0 cmbs (55.1 inches) (Figures 19 through 21; see also
Figure 16). The northern and southern extents of Feature 1 were not assessed because both
boundaries fell outside the exposed limits of the 90.0-cm- (35.4-inch-) wide trench, but the

feature seems to be 150.0 cm (59.0 inches) in diameter and roughly circular in shape.
Excavation of the eastern portion of the feature revealed a shallow pit profile with depth of
approximately 7.0 to 10.0 cm (2.8 to 3.9 inches) (see Figure 21).
The materials that constitute Feature 1 cluster naturally into eastern, central and western
portions. The total material recovered from the eastern portion of Feature 1 weighs 5.0
kilograms (kg) (11.0 pounds [lbs]) and includes 7 pieces of fire-cracked limestone, 1 piece of
sandstone, 4 fragments of fire-cracked chert, and 2 unburnt fragments of chert. The central
portion of Feature 1 consists of 1 large piece of sandstone that weighs 5.3 kg (11.6 lbs),
numerous deteriorating freshwater clam shells weighing a total of 1.1 kg (2.5 lbs), 4 fragments
of fire-cracked limestone, 4 fragments of fire-cracked chert, and 1 piece of quartzite. The
western portion of Feature 1 contains stones that weigh a total of 4.8 kg (10.6 lbs) and include 3
fragments of unburnt limestone, 4 fragments of fire-cracked limestone, 1 fragment of granite,
and 5 fragments of chert. No temporally diagnostic stone implements or datable carbonized
materials were present in Feature 1. Sample photographs of material from Feature 1 are
presented in Figures 22 and 23.
Observed Cultural Materials
Intensive shovel testing on site 41BT450 revealed 10 chert flakes, 4 Rabdotus snail
shells, 6 deteriorating fragments of freshwater clam shells, 1 granite mano, and 2 fire-cracked
rocks (FCR) (1 made of rough-grained chert and 1 made of limestone). These are presented in
Table 3 and photographs of lithic specimens are presented in Figures 24 and 25. No evidence
of cultural features was observed on the surface or within any of the shovel tests.
Additionally, excavation in and around Feature 1 resulted in various lithic materials. The
western portion of Feature 1 included 1 round cortical flake made of fine-grained chert.
Although its edges do not show evidence of wear, both sides show secondary flake reduction
(Figure 26). The central portion of Feature 1 included 2 primary flakes made of fine-grained
chert that are dark grey to reddish brown in color (both show evidence of heat spalling); 2
secondary flakes made of fine-grained chert that are gray in color (1 shows evidence of heat
spalling); and 1 heat-spall fragment made of rough-grained chert that is light brownish gray in
color. This lithic material is presented in Figure 27. The eastern portion of Feature 1 included 2
cores made of medium-grained chert (light gray in color), and 3 cortical flakes made of fine-,
medium-, and rough-grained cherts. These lithics are presented in Figure 28. Unprovenienced
lithic material was collected from the floor of BHT-2. These included 3 cortical flakes made of
medium- and fine-grained chert (2 of which show evidence of heat treatment), 4 secondary
flakes made of fine-, medium-, and rough-grained chert, and 1 bifacial tool made of fin-grained
chert. These lithics are presented in Figure 29 and 30.
Finally, the cultural materials from the 50.0-cm-by-50.0-cm test units excavated off the
resulting profiles on the 3 trenches on site 41BT450 consisted primarily of sparse cultural
materials indicative of lithic tool reduction, probable mussel processing, and some level of
cooking with heated stones. Test units BHT-1-1 and BHT-3-1 failed to produce any evidence of
cultural materials, while test unit BHT-2-1 revealed sparse amounts of cultural materials

SUMMARY
Site 41BT450 was identified as a prehistoric campsite occupied over a long period of time that
likely functioned as a location for lithic tool reduction, probable mussel processing, and some
level of cooking with heated stones. It is located on a small knoll at the confluence of the
Colorado River and one of its tributaries. Site 41BT450 is defined primarily by 2 separate
components: 1) a low-density lithic scatter confined almost exclusively to the site’s surface or to
soils no deeper than 40.0 cmbs (15.7 inches), and 2) a cultural feature consisting of a small pit
containing freshwater mussel shells surrounded by a scatter of fire-cracked rock approximately
140.0 cmbs (55.1 inches) (Feature 1). A total of 8 shovel tests were excavated over the
peninsula containing site 41BT450 and 3 shovel tests were excavated on an adjacent knoll just
north of site 41BT450. Of the 8 shovel tests excavated on the peninsula, 6 produced evidence
of subsurface cultural materials at depths between 0 and 100.0 cmbs (0 and 39.4 inches). The
3 shovel tests excavated on the adjacent knoll produced no evidence of cultural materials.
Besides Feature 1, no other features were observed on the site’s surface or in any of the shovel
tests, and no carbon-dateable material (either faunal or floral) or diagnostic artifacts were found

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

SUMMARY

The initial pedestrian survey of the Project Area resulted in the documentation of 1 new
prehistoric archeological site. Site 41BT450 was documented as a prehistoric campsite
evidenced by sparse amounts of lithic debitage and mussel shell fragments on a small
peninsula adjacent to the Colorado River. Because the site’s location adjacent to the Colorado
River suggested the potential for deeply buried cultural deposits, Horizon archeologists also
excavated 3 backhoe trenches across the site and 1 additional backhoe trench within a similar
setting on an adjacent knoll.
These backhoe trenches revealed generally sparse cultural deposits within the
boundaries of site 41BT450 and no evidence of cultural materials on the adjacent knoll. Of the
3 backhoe trenches excavated on site 41BT450, only 1 produced evidence of a cultural feature.
This feature consisted of a small pit containing freshwater mussel shells surrounded by a scatter
of fire-cracked rock. While the feature indicates that the site’s inhabitants participated in a “clam
bake” as some point in prehistory, no temporally diagnostic implements were recovered during
the investigations that would have allowed for the placement of the site within a particular
cultural period. Similarly, no radiocarbon-datable plant remains were encountered within the
feature or in any other location on the site. Aside from freshwater mussel shell fragments, the
site was found to be lacking in preserved floral and faunal remains. Due to the sparse nature of
the cultural materials on site 41BT450, the lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts, and the
observed lack of floral/faunal preservation, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41BT450 is ineligible
for inclusion on the NRHP and that no additional investigations are warranted on this site.

7.2

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of the cultural resources investigations, it is Horizon’s opinion that
the undertaking will have no impact on cultural resources considered to be eligible for inclusion
on the NRHP. Horizon therefore recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for
the undertaking. However, in the unlikely event that human remains or burial features are
encountered during the development of the Project Area, even within previously assessed
areas, all construction efforts at the location of the find should cease and the THC and the
USACE should be notified immediately.
