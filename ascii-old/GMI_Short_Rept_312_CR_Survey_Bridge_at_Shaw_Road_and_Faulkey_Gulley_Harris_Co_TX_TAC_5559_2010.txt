ABSTRACT
In March, 2010, Geo-Marine, Inc., under contract to HNTB Corporation, conducted an intensive
archeological survey of a 0.51-acre (ac) parcel for a proposed bridge replacement at Shaw Road
and Faulkey Gulley in northwest Harris County. The area of potential effects (APE) is 320 feet
(97.5 meters) long and 70 feet (21.3 meters) wide and is confined to the existing roadway rightof-way (ROW). Vertical impacts within the APE will be restricted to the upper 3 feet (0.9
meters) except at the stream crossing, where depth of construction could extend to a depth of 8
feet (2.4 meters). The archeological field investigation involved pedestrian survey and
judgmental shovel testing of the entire APE. Two shovel tests were excavated in areas with the
highest probability of containing intact deposits, and one shovel test was placed near the stream
bank in the southwest quadrant to determine the extent of disturbance associated with the
installation of drainage culverts adjacent to the stream within each quadrant. No cultural
materials were recovered in any of the three shovel tests, and disturbed deposits were encountered
in each. Overall, the archeological integrity of the APE is very low.
All data generated from this project will be permanently housed at the Texas Archeology
Research Laboratory in Austin at the conclusion of the project.

INTRODUCTION
The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) is proposing a bridge replacement of the
existing simple (14.6-meter (m; 48-foot [ft]) span concrete flat slab bridge on concrete caps and
timber piles at the intersection of Shaw Road and Faulkey Gulley in Harris County (Figures 1 and
2). The proposed survey segment is approximately 97.5 m (320 ft) long with a current right-ofway (ROW) width of approximately (21.3 m (70 ft). According to the engineering schematics
available (Figure 3), most of the construction activities will occur within the top 0.9 m (3 ft)
except at the stream banks where drilled support shafts could extend to a depth of 2.4 m (8 ft).
The area of potential effects (APE) for the project comprises 0.51 ac including the 2.4 m (8 ft) of
depth at the stream crossing. The project area consists entirely of state-owned existing ROW.
TxDOT is required under the Antiquities Code of Texas (13 TAC 26.12) to provide
environmental and cultural assessments of the area to be affected by the proposed construction
activities associated with the bridge replacement. HNTB Corporation (HNTB) was contracted to
provide the environmental consulting services for the project. Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI; project #
30007.13.01.03), of Plano, Texas, was then subcontracted by HNTB to provide the cultural
resources investigation portion of the project. Fieldwork was conducted on March 17, 2010, by
Ben Fullerton and Lindsey Skelton of GMI. Melissa Green, also of GMI, served as Principal
Investigator.
The purpose of the cultural resources investigation in this APE was to conduct an inventory or
determine the presence/absence of archeological resources (36 CFR 800.4) and to evaluate
identified resources for their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP), as per Section 106 (36 CRF 800) of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as
amended, or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL) under the Antiquities
Code of Texas (13 TAC 26.12). This project was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit
5559.
The project area consists of Shaw Road, the existing simple-span, concrete, flat-slab bridge
structure (Figure 4), culverts and drainage ditches paralleling Shaw Road in each bridge quadrant
(Figure 5), and the existing ROW that averages approximately 22 m (72 ft) wide. Shaw Road is
built upon an artificial road berm in each quadrant, the steepest of which is present on the west
side of the road (Figure 6). Drainage culverts have been installed at the stream banks in each
quadrant, and concrete has been placed atop the drainage culvert in the southeast quadrant (Figure
7). Buried utilities were observed lining the edge of the existing ROW in the western quadrants
(see Figure 6). Overall, the area has been significantly disturbed by construction activities and
very little intact deposits appear to remain.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
This project corridor falls in a flat rural setting in northwest Harris County. The underlying
geology for the project consists of the Quaternary (Pleistocene) Lissie Formation (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1992). Soils in the project area fall within the Wockley-Gessner association,
nearly level, loamy soils that are poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable and moderately
permeable soils on prairies (Wheeler 1976). The specific soil mapped in the project area is
Gessner loam, a nearly level soil in broad, irregular areas and in small depressions, that tends to
pond after heavy rains (Wheeler 1976:14). The soil profile begins with a dark grayish brown
loam about 17 centimeters (cm; 7 inches [in]) thick overlying about 23 cm (9 in) of grayish
brown loam that grades into a dark gray, slightly more clayey loam for about 45 cm (18 in). This
is underlain by 48 cm (19 in) of light brownish gray loam that ends in 213 cm (84 in) of light gray
sandy loam with distinct yellowish brown and brownish yellow mottles (Wheeler 1976:14â15).

CULTURAL HISTORY
Six archeological time periods have been associated with Native American occupations in
southeast Texas. These include Paleoindian, Archaic, Ceramic, Late Prehistoric, Protohistoric,
and Historic Indian. Archeologists within the region agree on the general framework, but there is
some discrepancy regarding the temporal boundaries of these periods. Pattersonâs (1995)
chronology includes Early Paleoindian (10,000â8000 B.C.), Late Paleoindian (8000â5000 B.C.),
Early Archaic (5000â3000 B.C.), Middle Archaic (3000â1500 B.C.), Late Archaic (1500 B.C.âA.D.
100), Early Ceramic (A.D. 100â600), Late Prehistoric (A.D. 600â1500), Protohistoric (A.D. 1500â
1700), and Historic Indian (A.D. 1700â1800). In contrast, Ensor (1990) offers a chronology that
includes Paleoindian (10,000â8000 B.C.), Early Archaic (8000â5000 B.C.), Middle Archaic
(5000â1000 B.C.), Late Archaic (1000 B.C.âA.D. 400), Early Ceramic (A.D. 400â800), and Late
Ceramic (A.D. 800â1750). Despite the differences, the chronologies developed by researches are
based primarily on changes in projectile point technologies and the introduction of pottery.

METHODS
Prior to beginning fieldwork, the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas was consulted to determine if
any previously recorded cultural properties or cultural resources management projects have
occurred within a 1-kilometer (km; 0.6 mile [mi]) radius of the project area. No archeological
sites were found within the search radius; however, a single cultural resources survey occurred
approximately 0.48 km (0.3 mi) to the west of the current project area. The survey was
conducted by Moore Archeological Consulting and consisted of surface inspection and shovel
testing of a 5-ac tract on Grant Road in Harris County, Texas (Driver 2006). No evidence of
archeological or historical remains was identified within the project boundaries and no further
work was recommended.
The Houston District Potential Archeological Liability Map (PALM) was also consulted to
determine the type of archeological investigation recommended for the project area. PALM is a
predictive model that utilizes geoarcheological knowledge to identify areas that have the potential
for containing preserved archeological sites (Abbott 2001). PALM was used in this archeological
investigation as a planning tool for the conditions that were likely to be encountered in the field.
7

The field methods ultimately conformed to the PALM recommendation, which suggested a
surface survey (with shovel testing included) without the necessity for deep reconnaissance (i.e.,
trenching).
The current project area was first traversed to inspect the ground surface and exposed stream
banks for the presence of cultural materials. Following this, shovel tests were judgmentally
excavated in areas that appeared to be minimally disturbed from previous construction activities.
In some cases, shovel tests were also excavated in order to estimate the degree of disturbance in
specific areas. The number of shovel tests excavated within the project is consistent with the
survey standards of three shovel tests per acre in survey areas of 2 acres or less as recommended
by the Council of Texas Archeologists and approved by the Texas Historical Commission. Each
shovel test was approximately 35 cm (14 in) in diameter and excavated in approximately 20-cm
(8-in) arbitrary levels to 80 cm (32 in) below surface (bs), or until subsoil was encountered. The
soils removed from shovel tests were processed through 0.635-cm (0.25-in) mesh screen. The
soils and any artifacts observed in each shovel test were recorded on standardized forms. Digital
photographs were used to document the survey conditions, disturbances, and any cultural features
observed. Details of each photograph were recorded on standardized forms.
All data generated from this project will be permanently housed at the Texas Archeology
Research Laboratory in Austin at the conclusion of the project.

RESULTS
The survey began with an inspection of the ground surface and exposed areas along the creek
banks for the presence of cultural materials; however, no cultural materials were observed during
the initial pedestrian survey. Due to the proximity of the project area to the headwaters of
Faulkey Gulley less than 1.6 km (1 mi) away and the low velocity of water movement, the stream
cutbanks within the project area were poorly developed and did not reveal any observable deep
stratigraphic profiles (Figure 8). As a result, it was apparent that there was a low probability for
finding intact archeological deposits within alluvial sediments adjacent to the stream. It was also
immediately apparent during the walkover of the area that the majority of the existing ROW has
been affected by construction and maintenance activities. At the bridge abutments, drainage
culverts have been installed that extend between the stream banks and the beginning of the road
berm and drainage ditches in each quadrant. These culverts have been capped with fill, and the
southeast quadrant culvert has been capped with concrete. This process has significantly
disturbed the areas near the stream banks. The areas beyond the culverts within the existing
ROW have also been disturbed through the construction of the road berm, drainage ditches, and
buried utilities along the edge of the existing ROW on the west side of Shaw Road.
Three shovel tests were excavated within the 0.51-ac project area, resulting in a total density of
5.88 shovel tests per acre (Table 1; see Figure 2). Shovel Test 1 was excavated in the southwest
quadrant approximately 3 m (9.8 ft) south of Faulkey Gulley and 2 m (6.6 ft) west of Shaw Road.
The shovel test was placed near the stream bank in order to determine the extent of disturbance
associated with the installation of drainage culverts that extend distally from the creek banks in
each quadrant (see Figure 2). The encountered profile consisted of a yellowish brown (10YR 5/4)
sandy loam with strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) sandy clay inclusions between 0 and 15 cm (6 in) bs
and a yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam mottled yellowish red (5YR 4/6) and strong

(10YR 7/2) clay were observed throughout the lower zone of the shovel test unit, attesting to the
high degree of disturbance near the stream banks within the project area boundaries (Figure 9).

Shovel Tests 2 and 3 were excavated approximately 30 m (98 ft) from the bridge abutments and
2 m (6.6 ft) from the edge of Shaw Road in the southeast and northeast quadrants, respectively.
The shovel tests were positioned in the narrow strip of relatively level land (approximately 0.5 m
[1.6 ft] wide) between the base of the road berm and the drainage ditch. The shovel tests also
exhibited disturbed soil profiles, although the disturbances seemed to be confined to the upper 20
cm (8 in) to 30 cm (12 in) bs. Inclusions of light gray (10YR 7/2) clay were observed in the
upper 20 cm (8 in) of the predominantly brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam matrix, whereas the zone
between 20 cm (8 in) and 80 cm (32 in) bs consisted of a brown (10YR 5/3) moist sandy loam
with light brown (7.5YR 6/3) mottles. This lower zone is consistent with the Gessner loam soil
unit mapped within the project area. Similarly, Shovel Test 3 exhibited disturbed deposits in the
upper 30 cm (12 in) and seemingly intact deposits between 30 (12 in) and 80 (32 in) bs. No
cultural materials were recovered from the ground surface or from any of the three shovel tests
excavated within the project area.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The archeological investigations undertaken within the project area did not recover any cultural
materials and indicated that the majority of the project area has been disturbed by modern
construction activities. No historic properties as defined under 36 CFR 60.4, 13 TAC 26.5(6), 13
TAC 26.5(32), and 13 TAC 26.8 were identified during the archeological investigation of the
current project APE. In addition, the proximity of the project area to the headwaters of Faulkey
Gulley represents a low probability setting to find intact archeological deposits. As a result of
these investigations, there appears to be little potential for the presence of significant
archeological deposits within the project area. In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4(d)(2) and 13
TAC 26.2, no further investigation is necessary. Consequently, it is recommended that
construction be allowed to proceed. If archeological deposits are encountered during
construction, work should cease and the Texas Historical Commission should be notified.
