Introduction
This report documents two collections of Caddo ceramic vessels and pipes from
sites of prehistoric to early historic age in Smith and Wood counties, Texas, in the upper
Sabine and upper Neches river basins in East Texas (Figure 1). Most of these Caddo
artifacts are from the J. A. Walters collection, with the remainder being from the Bernie
Ward collection.
Figure 1. Location of sites and collection areas in the Sabine and Neches River basins of
East Texas.
Mr. J. A. Walters was a lifetime resident of Smith County, Texas, who amassed a
large collection of Caddo artifacts. He was a commercial rose grower, a part of a local
nursery industry that began in Smith County in the late 1800s. He was an active church
member and respected family man, the father of three children, the eldest (Mark Walters)
being one of the authors of this paper.
J. A. Walters became interested in archeology in the late 1950s through the
influence of his brother-in-law Sam Whiteside, an active avocational archeologist who
recorded numerous important Caddo sites in Smith County and surrounding counties
(Walters 2005). Mr. Walters became a longtime member of the Texas Archeological
Society and the Arkansas Archeological Society and enjoyed attending several of the
Arkansas Archeological Society annual meetings.
Unfortunately, Mr. Walters had an unpleasant experience with a member of the
Texas professional archeological community early in his amateur archeological career.
Often professional archeologists are guilty of failing to recognize the contributions of
amateur archeologists or place themselves in elevated positions. One consequence of this
unpleasant encounter was that Mr. Walters never fully embraced the principles of
professional archeology as far as record-keeping activities went. Fortunately, he did
acquire numerous 7.5â topographic quadrangle maps and he made good records of his site
locations; there were numerous as Mr. Walters exhibited a real zeal for his acquired
hobby. He also made sketch maps (although often fairly crude by professional standards)
showing features he encountered during his site excavations. Through these records, it is
possible to obtain a fairly accurate description of his artifacts and their locations at sites,
and within features on those sites.
During the late 1950s and early 1960s Mr. Walters mostly worked in Smith
County. He located sites by visual observations and uncontrolled shovel testing. He
would often then place hand-excavated test trenches across the site looking for features.
At several sites he noted Caddo houses, middens, and burials; these occurred either as
single interments or, in a few cases, as interments in small cemeteries. South of the

2
Sabine River in Smith County, these family cemeteries often are small in size (containing
less than 10 individuals), unlike the larger prehistoric and early historic Caddo cemeteries
north of the Sabine River that Mr. Walters encountered later in Wood County, Texas.
In the mid-1960s, Mr. Walters made acquaintances with several large landowners
in Wood County, mostly along Caney Creek in the Lake Fork Creek drainage basin. It
was during this period that he discovered and excavated portions of several large Titus
phase cemeteries, including a cemetery area at the Spoonbill (41WD109) site (Perttula
and Middlebrook 2007; Walters 2007; Bruseth and Perttula 1981). Mr. Walters
continued his work in this area of Wood County (see Perttula 2005:Figure 11-6) until the
mid-1970s, when his health began to fail.
Mr. Bernie Ward is a prominent geologist in Tyler, Texas. He has been a
longtime member of the Texas Archeological Society and a collector of Native American
art. Around 1985, Mr. Ward, along with Bubba and Donny Jones of Arp, Texas,
excavated a Frankston Phase Caddo cemetery at 41SM290 in what is now an exclusive
residential area in Tyler. Mr. Ward has a portion of the recovered artifacts from the
burial features, along with additional Caddo artifacts, including several ceramic vessels
and pipes that he collected over the years from the area. Mr. Ward graciously allowed us
to photograph and document those portions of his collection that had a measure of site
provenience.

Documentation Efforts
In the early 1990s Mark Walters became active in Texas archeology and realized
the need to document the archeological record of his father's collections as well as his
Uncle Sam Whiteside's work. He has to date filed hundreds of archeological site forms
with the state of Texas recording new site locations, including sites first found by his
father, and written numerous reports documenting that work. Documenting in details the
collections of J. A. Walters was a logical next step in the study of these archeological
materials.
In late January and early February 2009, around the time of the East Texas
Archeological Conference held in Tyler, Texas, the J. A. Walters collection and Bernie
Ward collections were fully documented. Involved in this effort was Timothy K.
Perttula, Mark Walters, Shawn Marceaux, and Bo Nelson, with the last minute assistance
of James Harrison III. As discussed below, a detailed description of each ceramic vessel
or ceramic pipe was made for documentation purposes, accompanied by drawings, where
needed, of ceramic vessel decorative motifs or pipe morphology to supplement the
artifact descriptions. Mark Walters and Bryan Boyd, a member of the Texas
Archeological Stewardship Network, had photographed the J. A. Walters collection at an
earlier date, and Bo Nelson took the photographs of the Bernie Ward collection that we
documented.
At the present time, it is not certain to which avenue this collection effort (and
others that remain to be completed) will lead. It is our intent to make this important

3
information on Caddo collections from East Texas Caddo sites a part of the public
record. We believe that there is substantial information to be gained as a result of this
effort that will be of considerable benefit in increasing knowledge of Caddo archeology.
Private collections are very vulnerable to the possibility of being sold, or broken up, and
there are few options for the holders of these collections to ensure that they remain
together and also be available for future study. Because the publication of
this documentation effort involves a sizable expense for report formatting and printing,
and the funding for these publication efforts remain uncertain at this time, it is not clear
how this reportâor others contemplatedâwill be distributed. We contemplate
putting this report and accompanying figures and photographs on a CD for distribution,
as well as on a Caddo archeology website under development.

Methods of Vessel Analysis
The large number of ceramic vessels that we proposed to study in the Walters and
Ward collections are from generally contemporaneous prehistoric Caddo sites in the
middle Sabine and upper Neches River basins. Therefore, we established a
documentation protocol to assist in the analysis of each of the vessels from the different
sites. Each of the ceramic vessels in the collections is described and analyzed utilizing a
consistent set of morphological, functional, and stylistic attributes modeled after the
presentations in Cast et al. (2006); Gadus and Fields (1996); Gonzalez et al. (2005),
Perttula et al. (1998, 2008), Perttula (2009), and Perttula (2005, ed.). The purpose of the
documentation is to thoroughly characterize the character of each of the ceramic vessels
in the different Caddo collections. The sections that follow provide the completed vessel
recordation forms from 16 prehistoric Caddo sites in these two river basins in East Texas
(see Figure 1), as well as accompanying vessel photographic illustrations.
The following attributes were employed in the ceramic vessel study:
Non-plastics: Deliberate and indeterminate materials in the paste (Rice 1987:411),
including a variety of tempers (grog or crushed sherds, bone, hematite, shell,
quartz sands, etc.) and âparticulate matter of some size.â The grog, bone, and
hematite non-plastics appear to have been deliberately added to the paste as
tempers. The bone used for temper had been burned and calcined, then crushed,
before it was added to the paste.
Vessel Form: The principal vessel form categories include open containers
(bowls, carinated bowls, and compound bowls) and restricted containers,
including jars and bottles of several shapes and sizes. As restricted containers, jars
allow access by hand, but bottles do not (Brown 1996:335). Another important
vessel form, at least in burial contexts, is the effigy bowl with a modeled head
(usually a bird or duck head) and a tab tail. Occasionally, an effigy vessel will
have a broader tab tail that supported an anthropomorphic or zoomorphic tail rider
(see Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 24k).

4
Additional form attributes that were recorded on each of the vessels
(depending upon their completeness) include the rim profile (outflaring or
everted, vertical or standing, and inverted), lip profile (rolled to the exterior,
rounded, flat, or thinned), and base shape (flat or rounded).
Core Colors: Observations on ceramic cross-section colors permit consideration
of oxidation patterns (Teltser 1993:Figure 2A-H; Perttula 2005, ed.), and thus the
conditions under which the vessel was fired and then cooled after firing.
Comments are included for these attributes on the presence and location of fireclouding, sooting or smudging from cooking use (Skibo 1992), and the
preservation and location of charred organic remains.
Wall Thickness: Thickness was recorded in millimeters, using a vernier caliper, at
the lip, along the rim, at several points along the body, and at the base when
possible (only for the vessels that were not complete).
Interior and Exterior Surface Treatment: The primary methods of finishing the
surface of the vessel include smoothing, burnishing, and polishing (Rice
1987:138). Brushing is a popular method of roughening the surface (particularly
the body) of large and small Middle Caddo (ca. A.D. 1200-1400) and Late Caddo
(ca. A.D. 1400-1680) period cooking jars and other utility wares. Here it is
considered a decorative treatment rather than solely a functional surface treatment
(cf. Rice 1987:138), although not all Caddo ceramic analysts treat brushing as a
decorative treatment (cf. Gadus et al. 2006:31). In certain fine ware vessels,
brushed bodies accompanied engraved rim panels. Smoothing creates âa finer and
more regular surfaceâ¦[and] has a matte rather than a lustrous finishâ (Rice
1987:138). Burnishing, on the other hand, creates an irregular lustrous finish
marked by parallel facets left by the burnishing tool (perhaps a pebble or bone). A
polished surface treatment is marked by a uniform and highly lustrous surface
finish, done when the vessel is dry, but without âthe pronounced parallel facets
produced by burnishing leather-hard clayâ (Rice 1987:138).
The application of a hematite-rich clay slip (Ferring and Perttula 1987),
either red or black after firing in an oxidizing or reducing (i.e., low-oxygen)
environment, is another form of surface treatment noted in these vessel
assemblages, albeit very rarely. The clay slip is more frequently applied on the
vessel exterior than on the interior surface, and then was either burnished or
polished after it was leather-hard or dry.
Height and Orifice Diameter: These attributes, measured in centimeters, were
recorded with a ruler.
Diameter at Bottom of Rim and Base Diameter: Also recorded in millimeters
using a ruler, these attributes permit characterization of the overall contour and
shape of the vessel.

5
Volume: Vessel volume in liters was determined by filling (to within 1 mm of the
lip) the vessel with lentil seeds, then dumping the lentil seeds in containers of
known volume. In estimating the volume of vessels with holes, the vessel was
first filled with a cloth that conformed to vessel contours, then the lentil seeds
were poured into the depression in the cloth to within 1 mm of the top of the lip.
Then they were dumped into containers of known volume. In cases where the
vessels were not (or could not) be reconstructed, but measurements of height and
orifice diameter were be obtained, volumes were estimated by comparison with
known vessel volumes of specific forms (i.e., carinated bowl, jar, bottle,
compound bowl, and bowl) in other documented Caddo vessel assemblages.
Decoration: Decorative techniques present in the vessel collections from sites in
the middle Sabine and upper Neches River basins of East Texas include engraving
and excising, incising, punctating, pinching, lip notching, brushing, neck banding,
and appliquÃ©ing. On certain vessels, combinations of decorative techniques (i.e.,
brushed-punctated) created the decorative elements and motifs. Engraving and lip
notching was done with a sharp tool when the vessel was either leather-hard, or
after it was fired, while the other decorative techniques were executed with tools
(incising and punctation), by adding strips of clay to the wet body (appliquÃ©), by
crimping the coils (neck banding), using frayed sticks or grass stems (brushing)
dragged across the body surface, or fingernails (certain forms of punctations and
pinching), when the vessel was wet or still plastic. Excising is considered a form
of engraved decoration, where the clay is deliberately and closely marked/scraped
and carved away with a sharp tool, usually to create triangular elements (the
pendant triangle or small tick marks) or crescent-shaped elements that separate or
serve to define scrolls (Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 64aâb, f).
A red clay film or wash was added to the surface of some vessels as a slip
before they were fired. Another form of vessel decoration is the use of red
(hematite or ochre) or white (kaolin clay) clay pigments that have been smeared,
impressed, or rubbed into the engraved lines of certain vessels.
Type: The kinds of named ceramic types in these collections from the middle
Sabine and upper Neches River basins follow primarily the work of Suhm and
Jelks (1962), Kleinschmidt (1982), and Hart (1982), as well as new types (Hood
Engraved) and varieties of Poynor Engraved defined by Perttula (2008, 2009).
In the sections that follow, we first discuss the archeological character of the
vessels found in mortuary contexts at the various prehistoric Caddo sites represented in
the J. A. Walters and Bernie Ward collections. Then, this vessel data is employed to
make comparisons of the kinds of decorative motifs and elements found on the different
kinds of vessel forms, followed by assemblage-level considerations of vessel form, vessel
size, use of temper, and firing conditions, as well as the use of pigments, from mortuary
vessels of different ages and ceramic traditions in both the upper and middle reaches of
the Sabine River and the upper Neches River basins. Following this is a discussion of the
pottery pipes in the J. A. Walters collection. This report also includes two appendices:

6
Appendix 1, the documentation of a small number of vessels from the well-known Sam
Kaufman site (41RR16; also known as the Roitsch site) in the Red River basin, and
Appendix 2, the documentation of vessels from unknown sites in both Smith and Wood
counties, Texas.

Archeological Context of the Sites
Where available from existing field notes, plan maps, and published articles, the
archeological context of the prehistoric Caddo ceramic vessels and pipes in the J. A.
Walters and Bernie Ward collections are discussed on a site by site basis. Those sites not
discussed below unfortunately have no available information on the archeological context
of the ceramic vessels and/or pipes in the J. A. Walters collection.
41SM73, Joe Meyers Place
The one ceramic vessel from the Joe Meyers Place, on Saline Creek in the Neches
River basin (see Figure 1), discussed in this report is in the Bernie Ward collection.
According to Johnson (1961:219-221), the Joe Meyers Place is primarily an Early Caddo
habitation site (with a midden deposit) and cemetery, and at least seven burial features
(Anderson 1972:139). However, Late Caddo Frankston phase ceramics and one whole
vessel of Poynor Engraved were found by the East Texas Archeological Society in 1957
and indicate some use of the site by the Caddo after ca. A.D. 1400.
41SM193, Redwine
The Redwine site is a small Middle Caddo mound and habitation center in the
Auburn Creek valley, a small tributary to Harris Creek, in the middle reaches of the
Sabine River (see Figure 1). The ceramic vessels and pipes were excavated in the early
1960s by Sam Whiteside, who conducted investigations in a substructural mound
(Walters et al. 1998:22-25), and also excavated four prehistoric Caddo burials; the
location of the burials at the site are not known. Later 1990s archeological investigations
reported by Walters et al. (1998:1) identified Middle Caddo period midden deposits on
the crest of the landform. The one calibrated radiocarbon date from a midden feature is
AD 1304-1434 (2 sigma) (Walters et al. 1998:35); the calibrated mid-point is AD 1401
(Reimer et al. 2004).
The burials at the Redwine site were placed in fairly deep (ca. 1 m bs) pits, and
were laid on their backs in an extended supine position; their orientation or direction is
not known (Walters et al. 1998:25). The burials contain ceramic vessels, ceramic pipes,
and arrow points as funerary offerings (Table 1). In total, there are 28 ceramic vessels
(7.0 vessels per burial), three ceramic pipes (0.75 pipes per burial), and 24 arrow points
(6.0 arrow points per burial).

The ceramic vessels from the Redwine site burials are discussed in more detail
below. Shafer (2008:55-61) analyzed the arrow points from Burials 1 and 3. He identified
Perdiz (n=6), Perdiz-Bonham (n=2), and Bonham-Alba (n=1) points from Burial 1, along
with a number of arrow points with a stylistic resemblance to point clusters from several
shaft tomb features at the George C. Davis site (Shafer 2008:58). The Burial 3 arrow
points include two Bonham-Alba and four that are untyped (Shafer 2008:60-61).
41SM197, Langford
The Langford site was excavated by J. A. Walters in 1960 (Walters 1997). The
site is located on an alluvial terrace overlooking the Sabine River, not far downstream
from the confluence of Harris Creek with the river (see Figure 1).
During that work, a Caddo house and several midden deposits were investigated,
along with nine Middle Caddo period burials; Walters (1997:38-39) provides a
description of Burials 1-7. The nine burials contain only 16 vessels (1.78 vessels per
burial), among them a beaker with engraved rattlesnakes (Walters 1997:Figure 2), and a
platform pipe (Table 2). One of the points is a dart point in the fill of Burial 8, but the
other is a small stemmed arrow point embedded in bone in the groin area of Burial 1.

41SM198, Pardee
The Pardee site is situated on a sandy alluvial rise on the east side of Sunstroke
Creek, in the Harris Creek drainage basin (see Figure 1). The rise is approximately 2.4 m
above the creek floodplain, and there is a naturally-formed lagoon along the south side of
the landform (Figure 2).
Figure 2. Map of 41SM198, showing the location of the burial with vessels, as well as
Houses 1-3, and a midden deposit.
J. A. Walters conducted excavations at the Pardee site in the late 1950s. During
that work, he excavated three circular Caddo houses, a burial (Feature 4), and portions of
a midden deposit (see Figure 2). House 1-3 ranged from 5.5 m in diameter (Houses 1 and
2, both with central hearths) to 6.1 m in diameter (House 3, also with a hearth, but its
location within the house was not specified in the field notes). There were numerous
mussel shells found in Houses 1 and 2, along with many animal bones, four Bonham
arrow points, and numerous large plain and decorated grog-and bone-tempered ceramic
sherds. Decorated sherds included examples from Dunkin Incised, Crockett Curvilinear
Incised, and Canton Incised types, and there were a few red-slipped sherds as well as a
small amount of brushed pottery. There were engraved sherds in the ceramic assemblage,
primarily from bottles.
The one burial from the Pardee site is approximately 10 m west of House 1 (see
Figure 2). No burial pit was noted, but the individual was laid out in an extended supine
position, with its head at the eastern end of the grave, and the body oriented in an westnorthwesterly position. Nine ceramic vessels were placed in the grave as funerary
offerings, three (Vessels 1-3) by the right side of the head and right shoulders, and the
other six (Vessels 1-9) on the right side of the body near the waist. Five of the vessels
(Vessels 4-5, 7-9) are plain, and the others are engraved bottles (Vessels 1 and 6), a
Canton Incised jar (Vessel 3), and an incised carinated bowl (Vessel 2) (see below).

9
41SM246, John Ellis site
The John Ellis site is about 0.5 miles south of the Middle Caddo Jamestown
Mound site (41SM54), a large site with seven known earthen mounds as well as midden
and habitation deposits (Perttula 1989; Perttula and Walker 2008:Figure 1). The John
Ellis site has a single mound, approximately 9.5 m in diameter, and Mr. J. A. Walters
identified two Caddo house structures just to the south and the northeast of the mound. A
single burial (Feature 2) was discovered and excavated about 1.8 m west of the southern
end of the mound. This burial, in a 2.1 x 2.0 m pit, contained three ceramic vessels and a
polished clay pipe stem.
41SM290
41SM290 is in the West Mud Creek drainage basin, in the southern part of the
City of Tyler proper (see Figure 1). It is a prehistoric Frankston phase cemetery with
seven burials, along with an associated 20 x 20 m habitation area based on the surface
scatter of artifacts. The cemetery was dug by Bubba and Donny Jones in ca. 1985, and
the vessels documented from the cemetery (in the Bernie Ward collection) represent only
a portion of the funerary objects found with the burials.
41WD109, Spoonbill
The Spoonbill site, primarily a Late Caddo Titus phase cemetery, in the Caney
Creek valley of the Lake Fork Creek drainage basin (see Figure 1), was excavated by J.
A. Walters in 1967 (Walters 1998:46). He excavated a cemetery with 15 burials, in an
area covering ca. 16 x 21 m, on a portion of terrace landform that overlooks the Caney
Creek floodplain to the north (Figure 3). These burials are in several east-west rows,
presumably with the individuals laid out in an extended supine position in the graves,
with their heads facing west.
Figure 3. Plan of the Late Caddo cemetery excavated by J. A. Walters at the Spoonbill
site. The location of Burial 4 is not known.
Two of the burials in the cemeteryâBurials 5 and 11âexcavated by J. A.
Walters apparently date to the Middle Caddo period, based on the decorated vessels
placed with the deceased individuals. The range of vessels known to have been recovered
from the various Titus phase graves at the Spoonbill site, including Taylor Engraved,
Simms Engraved, Womack Engraved, and Keno Trailed, var. Phillips, suggest that this
cemetery dates to the late 17th century (Walters 1998, 2007).
The exact location of the Titus phase cemetery excavated by J. A. Walters at the
Spoonbill site is not known, unfortunately. Later archeological investigations at the site
(Bruseth and Perttula 1981:40-48 and Figure 3-39) identified two more Middle Caddo
period burials and a post-A.D. 1600 Titus phase burial in a cluster at the southern end of
the site. That work also identified two temporally sequent Early to Middle Caddo period
clusters of pit features and a circular structure. Calibrated radiocarbon dates from the

10
Early Caddo component range from AD 967-1160, with midpoints at AD 1020 and 1040,
while dates from the Middle Caddo period component range from AD 1228-1395
(Perttula 1997:Table 1), with calibrated mid-points of AD 1279 and 1285 (Reimer et al.
2004, IntCal04.14c).
41WD586, Turquoise site
According to Walters (2006a:84-85), J. A. Walters excavated a Titus phase
cemetery in the mid-1960s at the Turquoise site in the Caney Creek valley (see Figure 1).
The nine burials were arranged east-west in several rows with the heads of the deceased
facing west and the bodies in extended supine position. The grave offerings:
were composed of ceramic vessels (located from the shoulder to the knee
and mostly on the right side), clusters of arrow points (both stemmed and
triangular forms) around the left side of the knee areas, clay pipes (elbow
style) located around the shoulder and the left side of the knee areas, and a
turquoise pendant which was located in the neck area (Walters 2006a:84).
Information about each of the burials is provided in Table 3. There were a total of 56
separate funerary offerings in these burials, primarily ceramic vessels (68%, and 4.2
vessels per burial), as well as stemmed and triangular arrow points (27%, and 1.67 points
per burial), and elbow pipes (5.4%, 0.3 pipes per burial).

The range of decorated ceramic vessels from the siteâincluding red-slipped
Taylor Engraved bowls and Simms Engraved bowlsâalong with the presence of both

11
stemmed and triangular (Maud type) arrow points suggests that the cemetery dates to the
latter part of the Titus phase, perhaps between ca. A.D. 1500-1600, or even later.
41WD589
Excavations by J. A. Walters at 41WD589 encountered six burials (Burials 1-6)
and a pit feature that bisected Burial 1 (Figure 4). There are two instances of burials
overlapping one another (Burial 4 bisecting Burial 6 and Burial 2 bisecting Burial 3) in
the cemetery, indicating several periods of cemetery use during the Late Caddo Titus
phase. Four of the burial pits are oriented generally east-west, with the head of the
deceased at the eastern end of the pit, facing west, and grave goods placed around the
head and body of the deceased. Two burial pits were oriented in different directions:
Burial 1 west-northwest, with the head facing northwest; and Burial 2, northeastsouthwest, with the head facing southwest (see Figure 4).
Figure 4. Plan of the burial excavations at 41WD589.
Burial 1 had three vessels, Burials 2/3 had 11 vessels and three arrow points (1
Bassett and 2 Maud type), Burial 4 also had 11 vessels, Burial 5 had at least three vessels,
and Burial 6 had three vessels. The average number of vessels per burial pit is 5.0 (n=30).

Langford (41SM197) Vessels
The Langford site is a Middle Caddo settlement and cemetery on the Sabine
River, just downstream from its confluence with Harris Creek (see Figure 1). There are
six vessels in the J. A. Walters collection that can be attributed to the Langford site burial
features, although the available records indicate 16 vessels were recovered from the nine
burials in the cemetery (see Table 2). The vessels in the collection include one brushedpunctated-pinched jar, a brushed-punctated jar, an engraved beaker (with a rattlesnake
motif), a plain bowl, a plain bottle, and an engraved bottle.

41SM290 Vessels
There are 18 vessels in the Bernie Ward collection from 41SM290. They include
Poynor Engraved, var. Cook (n=2), Poynor Engraved, var. Blackburn/Cook (n=1),
Poynor Engraved, var. Lang (n=2), Poynor Engraved, var. Hood (n=1), Poynor
Engraved, var. A (n=1), Poynor Engraved, var. N or P (n=1), cf. Hume Engraved (n=2),
Hood Engraved, var. Cook (n=1), Hood Engraved, var. unspecified (n=1), undetermined
fine ware (n=3), La Rue Neck Banded (n=1), plain jars (n=1), plain carinated bowls
(n=1), and plain bowls (n=1). Based on the range of varieties represented in the Poynor
Engraved vessels in this collection, it is likely that they come from Caddo burials that
date to the middle part of the Frankston phase, ca. A.D. 1480-1560 (Perttula 2009:Table
6-37).

Spoonbill Site (41WD109) Vessels
There are 34 Caddo ceramic vessels in the J. A. Walters collection from the
Spoonbill site, an important multi-component Caddo settlement and cemetery on Caney
Creek in the Lake Fork Creek drainage basin (see Figure 1). The vessels are from both
Middle Caddo and Late Caddo period burials found in the same cemetery.
The Middle Caddo period ceramic vessels include a red-slipped and punctated
bottle (cf. Maxey Noded Redware) from Burial 5 (see Figure 3), an interior and exterior
engraved bowl, a red-slipped incised-punctated bowl from Burial 11, an incised jar from
either Burial 5 or Burial 11, two Spoonbill Engraved bowls from Burial 11, and two
Sanders Engraved carinated bowls from Burial 11. The Titus phase graves include
vessels of the following identified ceramic types: Hodges Engraved, Hudson Engraved,
Keno Trailed, var. Phillips, La Rue Neck Banded, McKinney Plain (perhaps better
named McKinney Appliqued?), Mockingbird Punctated, Ripley Engraved, Simms
Engraved, var. Darco, and Taylor Engraved.

Caney Creek Vessels, Wood County, Texas
There are 58 vessels in the J. A. Walters collection that can only be identified as
coming from burials in the Caney Creek valley in the Lake Fork Creek basin (see Figure
1). Over the years, these vessels have lost their provenience, but they come from either
the Spoonbill site, 41WD354, the Turquoise site, or 41WD589. With one exception
(Vessel 223, see below), the vessels from Caddo sites in the Caney Creek valley are
clearly from late (post ca. A.D. 1550) Titus phase burials. They include vessels belonging
to the defined fine ware types Hudson Engraved,. Ripley Engraved, Simms Engraved,
var. Darco and var. unspecified, Taylor Engraved, Wilder Engraved, and probably
Womack Engraved, and several utility ware types: McKinney Plain and La Rue Neck
Banded. There are also plain jars (n=2) and a punctated carinated bowl (n=1).

been rubbed in the engraved lines.

148
The engraved âcircleâ in the central part of the motif (see Figure 146) is probably
not a circle at all, but a representation of a peyote button (see Tunnell 2000:Figure 1). It
seems likely that the Titus phase Caddo peoples were familiar with peyote and probably
with peyote ceremonialism by the 15th century A.D (Perttula 2005:23-24). This is turn
suggests that these Caddo, either through intermediaries or through pilgrimages of their
own, had knowledge of or had journeyed to the peyote gardens of southern Texas (e.g.
El-Seedi et al. 2005; Terry et al. 2006) long before they had the horse.

Pottery Vessel Comparisons and Ceramic Traditions
The pottery vessels in the J. A. Walters and Bernie Ward collections are from
Caddo sites that fall into a number of discrete geographical areas: the Caney Creek
drainage in the upper Sabine River basin; from west to east, the Village Creek, Harris
Creek, and Prairie Creek drainages in the middle Sabine River basin; the upper Neches
River basin; and the upper Angelina River basin (see Figure 1). The sites from which the
pottery vessels were obtained are not well dated through radiocarbon analysisâexcept
perhaps for the Spoonbill site, based on archeological research carried out by Bruseth and
Perttula 1981. Nevertheless, n the main, the burials at these sites that had whole pottery
vessels placed in them as funerary offerings date to Middle Caddo (ca. A.D. 1200-1400)
or Late Caddo (ca. A.D. 1400-1680) period times based on stylistic grounds. How do the
Caddo pottery vessels from mortuary contexts from these different geographic areas and
temporal periods compare with each other with respect to key attributes of vessel
manufacture and decoration?
Vessel Forms
There are a wide range of vessel forms in the Caddo mortuary vessels from sites
in the Caney Creek, upper Neches, upper Angelina, and Harris, Village, and Prairie Creek
areas (Table 4). The principal vessel forms in each of the regions, regardless of the
temporal context, are carinated bowls, jars, bottles, and bowls (including several different
forms within each of the vessel categories), but there are also compound bowls, deep
bowls, effigy bowls, and beakers.

Bottles are an important part of Caddo pottery vessel assemblages, and it was
typical that at least one bottle was placed as a funerary offering in each grave (except
apparently not the case among the Prairie Creek burials); bottles account for 14.9-27.3%
of the vessels in each assemblage (see Table 4). The latest forms of the bottles include
cylindrical bottles with short necks in the upper Angelina River site (both Hume
Engraved and Poynor Engraved forms), spool neck bottles (in the Caney Creek area), and
a Hodges Engraved bottle form with four hollow legs (cf. Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate
37b). Earlier bottle forms tend to have globular bodies and long, relatively straight necks.
Beakers, including an example with engraved rattlesnake motifs, are present only
in Middle Caddo period burials in the Harris Creek area (see Table 4). Similar decorated
beakers have been found in other sites in the middle Sabine River basin as well as in the

197
Angelina and Neches River basins, in contemporaneous Middle Caddo sites in Rusk and
Panola counties (see Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 61c; Perttula and Nelson 2003:Figure
2.9; Rogers and Perttula 2004).
Carinated bowls are also well represented in these Caddo vessel assemblages.
This is particularly the case in Late Caddo mortuary vessel assemblages from the upper
Angelina (Frankston phase) and Caney Creek (Titus phase) areas (see Table 4), where
they account for 44.4-54.7% of all the vessels. The preferential placement in burial
features of carinated bowls that would have been used in life as serving vessels has been
well documented in much larger Frankston and Titus phase vessel samples from East
Texas (Perttula 2005, 2009). One distinctive form of carinated bowl present in the Caney
Creek area in late Titus phase contexts is the hubcap form of certain Simms Engraved
vessels (cf. Skinner et al. 1969; Perttula 1992:Table 11; Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 71bc), a vessel form apparently made and used between ca. A.D. 1500-1700. Compound
bowls are present only in the Harris Creek (Middle Caddo period) and Caney Creek areas
(see Table 4), the vessels in the latter area are found in association with other Late Caddo
Titus phase mortuary vessels.
Bowls and deep bowls are relatively more abundant in mortuary contexts in
Caddo burials of Middle Caddo period age in the Caney Creek, Harris Creek, Prairie
Creek, and Village Creek areas than they are in Late Caddo contexts, irrespective of the
geographic area. Together, between 23.4-60% of the vessels from the Caney Creek,
Harris Creek, and Village Creek sites are bowls and deep bowls (see Table 4). Effigy
bowls, on the other hand, are only represented in Frankston phase burials in the upper
Neches and upper Angelina River basins as well as in the Harris Creek area in the middle
Sabine River basin (see Table 4); this suggests that perhaps there was a cultural
relationship between the Caddo peoples that lived in these areas.
Jars, used in life for cooking and storing food stuffs, consistently account for
between 11.1-20% of the mortuary vessels from the different geographic areas, except in
the small vessel sample from the Prairie Creek sites, where 87.5% of the vessels are jars
(see Table 4). Jars with lugs or strap handles are noted only in the upper Neches, upper
Angelina, and Harris Creek areas, where they occur on 25-50% of all the jars (see Table
4).
Rim and Lip Form
The rim profile of the vessels from the J. A. Walters and Bernie Ward collections
include everted, direct or vertical, or inverted profiles. Most of the lips tend to be
rounded, but there are also flat lips (Table 5). Everted rims are found most commonly on
jars, but also on some bottle forms (especially near the lip), while direct and inverted rims
are best seen on bowls and carinated bowls, as well as on some jars. Occasionally the lip
of some of the vessels has been folded over towards the exterior vessel surface; other lips
have distinctive Redwine or Sprocket lip modes (Miller 1986; Walters n.d.). Exterior
folded lips occur in the Harris Creek area in Middle Caddo times, and in Titus phase and
Frankston phase Late Caddo vessels in the Caney Creek and upper Angelina River areas.

198
In the present sample, vessels with Redwine or Sprocket lip modes are present only in
Middle Caddo sites in the Harris Creek area (Table 5).

Inverted rim vessels are present only in mortuary vessels from Late Caddo
cemeteries in the Caney Creek, upper Neches, and upper Angelina drainage basins (see
Table 5). These kinds of vessels are particularly abundant in post-A.D. 1550 Titus phase
contexts (cf. Perttula 2007a) in the Caney Creek area, suggesting that this rim form has

199
chronological significance. With the exception of the Prairie Creek area, the relative
proportion of direct rim vessels is particularly common in Middle Caddo assemblages
(80-88.8% of the vessels) and in the upper Angelina River basin (83.4%). The frequency
of direct rim vessels in Late Caddo contexts in the upper Neches and Caney Creek areas
ranges from 45.8-63.7% (see Table 5).
Temper and Paste
The Caddo vessels in the J. A. Walters and Bernie Ward collections, regardless of
their geographic area or temporal context, are from grog-tempered pottery traditions
(Table 6). Between 93.7-100% of the vessels by area and cultural period have grog
temper added to the paste, either as the sole temper inclusion (62.5-80%), or in
combination with hematite or bone. Hematite temper occurs in 9.1-22.2% of the vessels
from the different geographic areas, with the exception of the Prairie Creek and Village
Creek areas, where it was not apparently used in vessel tempering. Bone temper is
present in 5.3-20% of the vessels that are not Frankston phase mortuary vessels from the
upper Neches and upper Angelina River basin sites, but is absent in vessels from the
latter two areas. The dearth of bone temper use in these areas is consistent with other
ceramic analytical findings from the upper Neches, were the use of bone temper in
vessels and domestic site sherd assemblages was typically less than 3-5% in Late Caddo
and Early Historic Caddo pottery assemblages (see Perttula 2009). The single shelltempered vessel from the Caney Creek area (Table 6) is considered an import from a
manufacturing locale on the middle reaches of the Red River, in the area of the Sam
Kaufman site (see Figure 1), where shell-tempered pottery was virtually the sole pottery
manufactured there after ca. A.D. 1300.

The vast majority of the vessels have either a clay or silty paste, and the clays for
vessel manufacture were likely gathered from nearby alluvial settings, probably within a
short (1-7 km away, at most) distance from each of the settlements. Depending upon the
geographic area, about 3.2-25% percent of the vessels have a fine sandy paste, suggesting
that a naturally sandy clay was occasionally selected by Caddo potters, especially in the
Prairie Creek, upper Neches, and upper Angelina River areas for use in making particular
kinds of vessels. Those with a sandy paste may have facilitated resistance to thermal
shock or mechanical breakage. The preferential occurrence of sand in the clay paste of
Frankston phase vessels in the upper Neches and Angelina may, in fact, indicate a
particular focus on the use of alluvial clays by local potters (at least after the 15th
century), rather than the harder to process bedrock clay. Another study of 15th-17th
century vessels from the upper Neches documented that between 18-34% of the vessels
had a sandy paste (see Perttula 2009).
Firing Conditions
The Caddo pottery vessels in the J. A. Walters and Bernie Ward collections have
been fired under several different conditions (Table 7). With the exception of the upper
Angelina River vessels from 41SM290, the vast majority of the vessels have been fired in
a low oxygen or reducing environment (75-100%). In turn, most of these reduced-fired
vessels were cooled in the open air (or exposed to an open fire) near the end of the firing
process, leaving the vessel with a dark core and with either one or both vessel surfaces
with a thin oxidized or lighter-colored band visible in cross-section.

By geographic area, the Caddo vessels included in Late Caddo period burials
from the upper Neches and upper Angelina River areas, and from Middle Caddo period
contexts at the Harris Creek sites, were most likely to have been fired in an oxidizing or
high oxygen environment (see Table 7). Incompletely oxidized or low-fired pottery was
also present in relatively low frequencies in the upper Neches and upper Angelina burial
features, as it was in closely comparable amounts in Middle Caddo burial vessels from
the Caney Creek valley in the upper Sabine River basin. The highest proportion of
vessels fired in a reducing environment includes the Prairie Creek, Village Creek, and
Caney Creek geographic areas (see Table 7)
Decorative Methods
Most of the mortuary vessels in Caddo pottery assemblages in the Sabine, Neches,
and Angelina River basins are decorated. As will be discussed below, much of the
decorated pottery is fine ware, with engraved or trailed designs, typically on carinated
bowls and bottles, but a variety of vessel forms in these geographic areas have engraved
designs. Utility wares have wet paste designs; that is, designs that were executed prior to
a vessel being fired.
Eleven different utility ware ceramic types have been identified in the J. A.
Walters and Bernie Ward collections from the different geographic areas, as well as 18
fine ware types (see Suhm and Jelks 1962; Hart 1982; Perttula 2009; Perttula et al. 1998,
2007; Webb 1959) (Table 8). The earlier utility ware types are present in the Village and
Prairie Creek areasâincluding Canton Incised and Dunkin Incisedâas well as the Harris
Creek area, which has Dunkin Incised, Crockett Curvilinear Incised, Reavely BrushedIncised, and Killough Pinched. All of these types can be reasonably be expected to occur
in ca. A.D. 1200-1400 contexts in Caddo sites in the middle Sabine River basin, as well
as other parts of Northeast Texas. In the upper Neches, the sole utility ware identified in

202
the J. W. Walters and Bernie Ward collections is Bullard Brushed, a Frankston phase
cooking jar. Titus phase utility wares in the Caney Creek area include in order of
frequency: McKinney Plain (n=7), La Rue Neck Banded (n=5), Mockingbird Punctated
(n=2), and Moore Noded (n=1). The absence of brushed utility wares is typical of
western Titus phase ceramic traditions (Perttula 2005, ed.:401-405 and Table 11-10;
Bruseth and Perttula 1981).

The earlier sets of engraved fine wares include Hickory Engraved in the Village
Creek area; and Maxey Noded Redware, Sanders Engraved, and Spoonbill Engraved
from the 13th and 14th century component at the Spoonbill site in the Caney Creek area.
Bruseth and Perttula (1981:Table 5-10) identified four vessels from two burials in this
component.1 They included two Monkstown Fingernail Impressed jars, a Sanders
Engraved carinated bowl, and a plain bottle.
The fine wares Handy Engraved, Haley Engraved, and Washington Square
Paneled have been identified from the Harris Creek area (see Table 8); these latter fine
wares definitely point to social relationships and some shared ceramic stylistic practices
between the Harris Creek Caddo and Caddo groups in the Angelina River basin (Hart
1982; Corbin and Hart 1998) as well as in the Red River, Haley phase, area of Caddo
peoples in southwestern Arkansas. The Middle Caddo fine wares in the Harris Creek
area, perhaps dating at the very end of the 14th century A.D. at the Redwine site, also
include examples of Poynor Engraved and Hood Engraved. These are more common fine
wares in ca. A.D. 1400-1650 Frankston phase contextsâas seen in the upper Neches and
Angelina River basins (see Table 8), along with Hume Engravedâbut recent analyses of
a large series of whole vessels in the upper Neches suggests that early varieties of Poynor
Engraved are known that date from as early as ca. A.D. 1320-1400 (Perttula 2009).
The final set of engraved fine ware types are from the late Titus phase
components at several sites in the Caney Creek area in the upper Sabine River basin (see
Table 8); a number of these vessels (12.9%) have a red slip as well as red or white
pigments as decorative embellishments (see below). These include Taylor Engraved
carinated bowls (n=13) and bottles (n=5), Wilder Engraved bottles (n=1), a Hodges
Engraved bottle, Ripley Engraved carinated bowls (n=26) and compound bowls (n=1),
Simms Engraved (including var. Darco) carinated bowls (n=8), Hudson Engraved bottles
(n=4), Womack Engraved carinated bowls (n=2), and Keno Trailed bottles (n=1) and
bowls (n=1, var. Phillips). The Ripley Engraved rim motifs primarily include the
continuous scroll (n=11), the scroll (n=7), the scroll and circle (n=3), interlocking
horizontal scroll (n=2), and the pendant triangle (n=1) (see Thurmond 1990:Figure 6a-c,
f-g). These are popular western Titus phase rim engraved motifs (Perttula 2005:404).
Bruseth and Perttula (1981:Table 5-10) recovered seven vessels from a late Titus phase
burial at the Spoonbill site. They included a LaRue Neck Banded jar, a 16th and 17th
century hubcap form Simms Engraved carinated bowl, a McKinney Plain (or appliqued)
jar, and four Ripley Engraved carinated bowls. The engraved motifs on these Ripley
Engraved vessels include the scroll (n=1), continuous scroll (n=2), and scroll and circle
(n=1).
Many of the engraved carinated bowls in the Caney Creek area have inverted rims
(see below), and there are several spool-necked bottles; these are both pottery attributes
characteristic of 16th and 17th century Titus phase vessel manufacture and style. Womack
Engraved and Keno Trailed are likely evidence of post-A.D. 1650 mortuary use and
vessel manufacture in the Caney Creek area.

204
Dispensing with the typological categorizations, we can also examine and
compare the different vessel assemblages with respect to the various decorative methods
(i.e., brushing, incising, engraving), or combinations of decorative methods (i.e., brushedpunctated, engraved-brushed-punctated) represented on the decorated utility wares and
fine wares. There are 15 combinations of utility ware decorative methods in these Caddo
vessel collections, as well as nine fine ware decorative methods (Table 9).

Utility wares are well represented in the mortuary vessels from the upper Neches,
Harris Creek, Village Creek, and Prairie Creek areas, where they account for between 41100% of the vessels found in burials (see Table 9). In the upper Neches, the utility wares
are brushed, brushed-punctated, and punctated jars. In the area of the three creeks, the
principal utility wares have incised-punctated, incised, and punctated designs. In the
Harris Creek area, this unique assemblage also has brushed-punctated, brushedpunctated-pinched, and brushed-appliqued-punctated vessels, along with punctatedpinched vessels; they comprise approximately 35% of the utility wares (see Table 9).
In the upper Angelina and Caney Creek areas, utility ware vessels are apparently
not common funerary offerings. They comprise only 6.7-22.2% of the mortuary vessels
in these areas (see Table 9). The Middle Caddo utility wares from the Caney Creek area
are incised and punctated, broadly similar in proportions to the Middle Caddo vessels
from the Harris Creek area. The upper Angelina River utility ware is a neck banded
vessel. Neck banded utility ware jars are also part of the Titus phase vessel assemblages
from the Caney Creek area, where they account for 24% of the sample (see Table 9).
Punctated and punctated-appliqued (35%) and roughened-appliqued and roughenedpunctated (20%) are also important decorative methods represented in the late Titus
phase vessels from the Caney Creek area (see Table 9).
Vessels decorated solely with engraved lines are absent in the small sample of
vessels from the Prairie Creek area. Otherwise, they are moderately common in the
mortuary assemblages from the Village Creek, Harris Creek, and upper Neches areas (2544.1%), and very common in the other geographic areas (55.5-93.3%) (see Table 9). By
proportion, engraved fine wares account for between 72-100% of all the fine wares, with
the highest proportions in the Village Creek and upper Angelina River areas.
In other Middle Caddo vessel assemblages, there are red-slipped fine wares (15%
of the fine wares in the Harris Creek area) as well as red-slipped-punctated fine wares
(28% of the Caney Creek Middle Caddo fine wares) (see Table 9). In the Harris Creek
area, there are also engraved-punctated and engraved-brushed-punctated fine wares
(10%). The Late Caddo vessel assemblage in the upper Neches has an engraved-brushed
vessel, which is a common decorative combination on large Poynor Engraved carinated
bowls in Frankston phase mortuary assemblages (see Perttula 2009). In the Titus phase
burials in the Caney Creek area, there are also engraved-red-slipped (11%), trailed
(2.8%), and engraved-punctated (1.4%) fine ware vessels (see Table 9); engraved-redslipped and trailed vessels are absent in the other geographic areas.
Another interesting difference in the composition of the mortuary vessels from
these geographic areas is in the total percentage of plain vessels. In some areas, very few
plain vessels were placed in graves, while in others (i.e., Middle Caddo sites in the
middle Sabine River basin and Late Caddo sites in the upper Neches and Angelina River
basins) plain vessels were a common funerary offering. In the Caney Creek area, for
instance, only 2.1% of the vessels in the Titus phase burials are plain (in a larger sample
of 2035 vessels from 17 Titus phase cemeteries, 7.7% of the vessels were plain [Perttula
2005:Table 11-10]) ; none of them are plain from the Middle Caddo period burials (see

206
Table 9). By contrast, in Frankston phase burials from the upper Neches and upper
Angelina, between 16.7-36.3% of the vessels are plain (see Table 9). As a further
comparison, in a larger sample of 630 vessels from 35 Frankston and Allen phase
cemeteries in the upper Neches, 11.8% are plain vessels (Perttula 2009). Burials in the
Harris, Village, and Prairie Creek areas have numerous plain ware vessel funerary
offerings, ranging from 12.5-27.7% from one area to another (see Table 9).
Lip Notching
Lip notching is an occasional and distinctive decorative treatment on certain
Middle and Late Caddo vesselsâalmost exclusively seen on fine waresâin several
different geographic areas (Table 10) in the upper and middle Sabine River basin and the
upper Angelina River basin. It was most commonly employed as a decorative treatment
in the Caney Creek drainage, in both Middle Caddo and Late Caddo, Titus phase, pottery
vessels placed as funerary offerings.

The lip notched vessels from the Caney Creek area in Titus phase times includes
late (post-ca. A.D. 1550-1700) ceramic types. These include Hudson Engraved bottles
(n=2), a Keno Engraved, var. Phillips bowl, one Taylor Engraved carinated bowl, two
Simms Engraved, var. Darco hubcap-shaped carinated bowls, and a third Simms
Engraved carinated bowl.
Pigments
Caddo potters made use of both red and white clay pigments as a decorative
embellishment on certain fine ware vessels. The red hematite-rich clay and kaolin clay
pigments were rubbed in the engraved lines âon vessels whose surface is of a shade that
will show up the pigment to the best effectâ (Campbell 1936:181).
In the present assemblage of pottery vessels, both red and white clay pigments
were used for decorative purposes, although a red clay pigment was preferred on vessels
by more than a 3:1 ratio in these geographic areas as a group (Table 11). It may be
noteworthy that fine ware vessels in the present sample with pigments are absent in the
upper Neches, upper Angelina, Village Creek, and Prairie Creek areas, or simply a

207
product of small vessel sample sizes. Where vessels with pigments are present, they are
found on between 11.1-15.8% of the vessels, very similar to the proportions documented
by Campbell (1936:182) and Perttula (2009) in larger studies of East Texas Caddo
pottery.

By geographic area, pigment use is proportionally the highest, for both red and
white pigments (in a 2.8:1 ratio), in Titus phase vessels from the Caney Creek area (see
Table 11). The Middle Caddo period burials from the same area are dominated by vessels
with a red clay pigment, while both red and white (in a 5:1 ratio) clay pigments have been
used in mortuary vessels from the Harris Creek area in Middle Caddo period times.

Pottery Pipes
Redwine (41SM193)
The one pottery pipe (No. 30) documented from the Redwine site is from Burial 3
(others are discussed in Walters et al. 1998). It is a plain untempered elbow pipe that is
brownish-yellow (10YR 6/6) in color, with a rounded elbow, a distinct break or collar at
the attachment of the bowl and stem, a rounded stem butt end, and a short bowl (24 mm)
with a rounded lip (Figure 196); the bowl rim is 3.8 mm thick. The pipe stem (with a flat
lip) is 49 mm in length ad 8.9 mm in thickness. The orifice diameter of both the stem and
bowl is 33 mm.
Figure 196. Plain elbow pipe from the Redwine site.
41SM247
Fragments (#195a-c) of three Red River style long-stemmed pipes (see Hoffman
1967) are in the collections from 41SM247. Two are grog-tempered and the third is
tempered with bone. Two of these pipes were fired in a reducing environment and cooled
in the open air (see Teltser 1993:Figure 2f-g) while the other was fired in an oxidizing
environment (see Teltser 1993:Figure 2a).
The first pipe sherd (#195a) is a burnished bowl fragment with a direct rim and a
flat lip (Figure 197, 2nd from left). The bowl height is 37.0 mm, and the orifice diameter
is 23.0 mm. This is likely a Graves Chapel variety of the Red River pipe (Hoffman
1967:9), based on the size of the bowl. The second pipe sherd (#195b) is the butt end of a
bone-tempered Graves Chapel variety stem (Figure 197, 1st from right). The stem
diameter ranges from 3.0 mm (interior orifice) to 10.5 mm (exterior orifice). The third
pipe stem sherd (#195c) is a grog-tempered stem piece (direct rim and a flat lip) that had
been broken at the bowl attachment (Figure 197, 2nd from right). The interior and exterior
stem hole diameters (10.6 mm and 16.0 mm) suggest this sherd is from a large Haley
variety of the Red River long-stemmed pipe (see Hoffman 1967:10).

Red River pipe, probably Graves Chapel variety; c, Red River pipe stem, Haley variety;
d, butt end of Red River pipe, Graves Chapel variety.
The fourth pipe sherd from 41SM247 (#195d) is a large fragment from a plain Lshaped elbow pipe, probably the earliest form (ca. 14th to early 15th century) of elbow
pipe in the middle reaches of the Sabine (Rogers and Perttula 2004) and upper Neches
(Perttula 2009) river basins. The pipe is grog-tempered, made with a sandy clay, fired and
cooled in a reducing environment, and then burnished (see Figure 197, 1st from left). The
pipe is approximately 46.3 mm in length, with an exterior stem diameter of 19.0 mm; the
stem hole diameter is 11.0 mm.

209
41SM290
There are three undecorated elbow pipes in the Bernie Ward collection from
41SM290 (Figure 198a-c). They have generally the same bowl and stem size and
length/height, with broad bowls and stem orifice diameters (Table 12). On the first two
pipes the attachment of the bowl and stem is near a right angle, and the stem is
perpendicular to the bowl, with the stem opening well removed from the bowl (Figure
198a-b). The third elbow pipe has a broad bowl and a sloping stem (Figure 198c).

Caney Creek, Wood County
The Caney Creek pipe (#248) is an engraved elbow pipe (with a white kaolin clay
pigment rubbed in the engraved lines) and is likely to have come from a Titus phase
burial, since pipes of this form and decorative style are relatively common in Titus phase
contexts in both the upper Sabine and Cypress Creek drainage basins. This grogtempered pipe was fired in a reducing environment and cooled in the open air, has been
polished, and is brown (10YR 5/3) in color.
The pipe is a maximum of 62.8 mm in length, with the bowl 47.3 mm in length,
and with only a short stem (15.5 mm) extending past the bowl; the remainder of the stem
sits under the bowl (Figure 199). The height of the pipe is 39.0 mm. The exterior stem
diameter is 27.3 mm.
Figure 199. Titus phase engraved elbow pipe from the Caney Creek area, Wood County,
Texas.
The stem has a single horizontal engraved line below the lip, as well as a crosshatched engraved band below the intersection of the stem and bowl. The bowl itself has
semi-circular and cross-hatched engraved zones centered on either side of the bowl (see
Figure 199).

210
Unknown Sites
There is one small platform pipe (#194c), grog-tempered, in the J. A. Walters
collection. It is circular in shape, with the bowl at the top of the platform, and the edges
of the platform have been carved to form a sprocket edge; there is a single broad
horizontal engraved line below the stem hole but on the platform, as well as another
engraved line that encircles the bowl (Figure 200b). The pipe is 46.0 x 34.0 in length and
width, and the bowl orifice diameter is 20.2 mm. The stem has an exterior stem diameter
of 25.0 mm, with a small (5.6 mm) stem hole diameter.
Figure 200. Pipes from unknown sites in the Walters collection from Wood or Smith
counties, Texas: a (left to right), Red River pipe bowl, Graves Chapel variety; b, small
platform pipe; c, engraved elbow pipe.
Another pipe sherd in the collection (#194b) is a sherd from a grog-tempered
(sandy paste) Red River pipe bowl, Graves Chapel variety, that has been broken at the
stem attachment; the bottom of the bowl is flat (see Figure 200a). The bowl height is 29.0
mm, and it has a 26.6 mm orifice diameter. The stem hole is 3.7 mm in diameter, and the
exterior stem diameter is 11.0 mm. There is also a larger pipe section (#161), the bowl
and part of the stem, from a Red River pipe, Haley variety. This pipe is grog-tempered,
fired in an oxidizing environment (Teltser 1993:Figure 2a), and then burnished. The bowl
is 33.0 mm in height, with a 23.5 mm orifice diameter; it is only 1.9 mm in thickness.
The flat and direct stem has a 13.0 mm diameter; the stem hole is 8.1 mm in diameter.
One of the pipes (#192) is an upper Neches River basin elbow pipe style, with an
acute, almost flat, angle between the stem and the bowl. The pipe is engraved on both the
stem and the bowl with circles and rectangular elements (Figure 201). The stem is 55.2
mm in length, with an exterior orifice diameter of 25.6 mm; the bowl is 47.7 mm in
height, with an exterior orifice diameter of 31.9 mm.
Figure 201. Upper Neches River basin engraved elbow pipe (#192) from the Walters
collection.
There are eight other elbow pipes or pipe fragments in the J. A. Walters
collection; three are decorated (Table 13) and two are L-shaped pipes. All of them are
grog (n=7) or grog-hematite (n=1)-tempered, and the majority of them (75%) have been
fired and cooled in an oxidizing environment, one (12.5%) was fired and cooled in a
reducing environment, and the other (12.5%) was fired in a reducing environment but
cooled in the open air. They are either burnished (37.5%) or smoothed. Rims are direct
with a flat lip.

The first of the decorated elbow pipes (#194a), with a rounded elbow form, has
Titus phase engraved elements on the bowl. These consist of two horizontal engraved
bandsâone under the lip and one above the stem attachmentâfilled with short diagonal
engraved lines (see Figure 200c). The other two decorated pipes may be from sites in the
upper Neches River basin or the middle reaches of the Sabine River basin. One (#189)
has a rounded form and a very short stem that wraps under the bowl (similar to #192,
discussed above) and at its end is actually folded up against the bowl itself. The bowl is
decorated with eight engraved triangles, four on either side of the bowl (Figure 202a).
The other (#188) is an L-shaped elbow pipe with four distinct engraved elements. The
stem has two horizontal engraved lines under the lip, along with a single small pendant
oval. The central portion of the under side of the stem has two sets of small hooked arm
scrolls. The bowl, like #189, has eight engraved triangles on the rim, four on each side of
the bowl (Figure 202b).
Figure 202. Engraved elbow pipes from the Walters collection: a, #189; b, #188.
The plain elbow pipes range from an L-shaped form with a tall bowl and lengthy
stem, as well as a large stem opening (Figure 203a), to three others with rounded elbow
forms that have a shorter bowl and shorter stem (24-39 cm in total length) (Figure 203bd), and a fourth other with a broad stem. One of these rounded elbow pipe forms has a
very small (5.4) stem hole diameter. Otherwise, internal stem hole diameters range from
11.0-16.0 mm (see Table 13).

Conclusions
This study of the Caddo vessels and pipes in the J. A. Walters and Bernie Ward
collections from the upper and middle Sabine, upper Neches, and upper Angelina river
basins in East Texas has documented a diversity of plain and decorated vessels, as well as
several different kinds of pipes, from mortuary contexts at 16 known sites. These sites
principally have mortuary features that date to Middle Caddo (i.e., Caney Creek, Village
Creek, Harris Creek, and Prairie Creek) and Late Caddo (i.e., Caney Creek, Titus phase
burials; upper Neches, and upper Angelina) period times, with the latest (estimated to
date from the late 17th to the early 18th century) mortuary vessels having been found at
the Spoonbill (41WD109) and Turquoise sites in the Caney Creek valley. Several of the
vessels with unknown provenience (see Appendix 2), specifically of the Holly Fine
Engraved type, may be indicative of Early Caddo period burials and settlements in this
region, but unfortunately their site and mortuary contexts have been lost since they were
collected many years ago.
While the findings of this study are subject to the vagaries of sample size and
provenience issues, nevertheless they are important in documenting the wide range of
ceramic practices employed by prehistoric and early historic Caddo potters in these
regions of East Texas with respect to clay preferences, temper choices, methods of firing,
and surface treatment, as well as in the kinds and sizes of vessels that were made and
used. Just as significantly, the analysis of the stylistic designs and decorative methods
employed in the decoration of utility wares and fine wares has demonstrated that each
geographic areaâregardless of the temporal contextâhas its own distinctive set of utility
ware and fine ware styles. Pipes ranged from the long-stemmed Red River style (at
41SM247 in the Prairie Creek area), manufactured as late as the 14th century A.D., to
several varieties of plain and decorated elbow pipes, including the early L-shaped elbow
pipe form, each distinctive to different geographic areas within this part of East Texas
(e.g., Jackson 1933; Perttula 2009).
The upper Neches and upper Angelina River area mortuary vessels of Late
Caddo, Frankston phase age, in the Walters and Ward collections (see Figure 1), and
from many other studied sites, stand apart from each of the vessel assemblages from the
Sabine River, and comprise part of distinctive Late Caddo grog-tempered ceramic
tradition (Perttula 2009:Figure 6-70) dominated by a number of varieties of Poynor
Engraved. In the upper Sabine River, in the Caney Creek area (see Figure 1), the majority
of the vessels are from a larger western Titus phase ceramic tradition that also
encompasses parts of the upper Big and Little Cypress Creek basins and the upper part of
the White Oak Creek basin. The majority of these vessels are from a very late Titus phase
occupation, extending into the early 18th century, that has been recently recognized in this
part of the western Titus phase area (see Perttula 2006, 2007a; Perttula et al. n.d.; Walters
2007). The character and stylistic variety of this late Titus phase ceramic assemblageâ
dominated by Ripley Engraved, Taylor Engraved, and Simms Engraved fine wares and
McKinney Plain/Appliqued and La Rue Neck Banded utility waresâis now much better
understood at the local level.

214
The Middle Caddo mortuary vessels from the Caney, Village, Harris, and Prairie
Creek areas have a local stylistic and technological character, although they belong to the
broad regional grog-tempered pottery tradition that characterizes much of the upper and
middle Sabine River basin. That local character is particularly evident in the differences
in pottery vessel decoration (as well as the proportion of plain wares in each assemblage),
as the Caney Creek Middle Caddo ceramics resemble pottery found together as far north
as the Red River (in Sanders phase contexts) and across the upper Sabine River basin (cf.
Krieger 2000; Bruseth and Perttula 1981). The Village and Prairie Creek areas are the
least well understood in stylistic character, but they are more similar to each other in the
dominance of incised, incised-punctated, and punctated utility wares than they are in
vessel assemblage character to either the Caney Creek or Harris Creek areas. More
investigations of Caddo sites, and documentation of collections from both domestic and
mortuary contexts, are warranted in the Village and Prairie Creek areas to bring these
local ceramic traditions to a full light.
The Harris Creek area Middle Caddo mortuary vessels, especially those from the
Redwine site (41SM193) have a character all their own, with unique vessel forms (i.e.,
beakers, engraved jars with strap handles) and vessel lip modes (the Redwine and
sprocket modes, Walters n.d.) as well as a panoply of utility ware and fine ware
decorative styles that are not seen elsewhere in this part of the middle Sabine River basin.
However, vessels with similar form and stylistic attributes have been documented in the
Angelina River basin and in parts of southwestern Arkansas. The Caddo peoples living in
the Harris Creek area between ca. A.D. 1200-1400 most likely had extensive contact and
social interaction with a diverse range of Caddo groups and potters, and were far from
parochial.
We are pleased to be able to put the J. A. Walters and Bernie Ward collections of
Caddo pottery vessels and pipes on record, and to have this information available from a
number of different sites for present and future studies of the native history of the Caddo
in parts of East Texas. Hopefully our study will encourage Caddo archeologists and
others interested in the prehistory and history of the Caddo peoples to undertake the study
of other important collectionsâespecially those with accurate provenience dataâof
Caddo material remains (including chipped and ground stone tools) from East Texas.

Notes
1. None of the vessels described by Bruseth and Perttula (1981:Table 5-10) are
illustrated, so the typological identifications proffered there must rely on the vessel
attribute observations provided in Table 5-10 of that report.

Appendix 2, Ceramic Vessels from Unknown Caddo Sites in Walters
Collection from Smith or Wood Counties, Texas
There are 49 Caddo ceramic vessels in the J. A. Walters collection where site
provenience is not known, or has been lost. Nevertheless, it is known that they come from
Caddo sites in either Smith or Wood counties, Texas, and thus provide further
information on the broad character of prehistoric Caddo ceramic manufacture and
stylistic treatment in this part of East Texas from Early Caddo to Late Caddo period
times.
