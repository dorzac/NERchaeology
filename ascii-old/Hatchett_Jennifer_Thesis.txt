ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
This project would not have been possible without the assistance of a huge
number of people. I am certain to miss some individuals who were extremely helpful; for
any I omit, my apologies and thanks. I must first thank my advisor, Dr. Tamra L. Walter,
and my other committee members, Dr. Brett A. Houk and Dr. Robert R. Paine. The
Texas Archeological Society helped to finance the project through a Donor’s Fund Grant
in 2005. In Aransas County, Al and Diane Johnson made this project possible in many
ways and provided support and enthusiasm throughout the process. Texas would be a
better state for archaeology if there were more land owners like the Johnsons. Pat Braun,
the archeological steward for Aransas County, provided assistance and advice. Many
other individuals in the Rockport/Fulton area were also very helpful, including
specifically Pam Wheat and Phil Stranahan as well as the Aransas County Historical
Society. I also am deeply indebted to the Texas Tech University anthropology students
who assisted with fieldwork: Cody Ames, James Barrera, Matthew Carter, Beverly
Hatchett, Rebecca Hatchett, Jennifer Heuss, Bennett Kimbell, Kenneth LeCroy, Brittany
McClain, Kimberly Morgan, Aaron Norment, Antonio Padilla, Daniel Rose, and Lindsey
Skelton. Dan Rose and Jimmy Barrera handled most of the photography during the
project, and Aaron Norment took TDS points during the December excavations and
assisted with photography.
A number of other individuals in archives and libraries provided invaluable
assistance in finding resources and tracking down documents. The staffs at the Center for

ii

American History at The University of Texas at Austin and at the Texas General Land
Office were particularly helpful.
Douglas K. Boyd and a number of other professional, as well as avocational,
archaeologists in Texas have also provided advice and guidance. Andrew Fielding, of the
Lion Saltworks in Cheshire, England, provided mentoring and references that I probably
would never have otherwise found. Charles Hockensmith, of the Heritage Council of
Ohio, and Kurt Fiegel of MACTech have also been extremely helpful in providing
references and comments. Members of the Texas Archeological Society and the Society
for Historical Archaeology list serves responded to questions about archaeological and
historical issues regarding the salt works. State Historic Preservation Officers in states
where historic salt works are known to have existed also responded to e-mail and phone
calls. A number of individuals in Ohio, Kentucky, Florida, Georgia, and Louisiana were
helpful in providing materials and references, and individuals from across the country
responded to posted questions and illustrations with comments, suggestions, and advice.
Most importantly, without the support and encouragement of my family this
project would not have gotten finished. My mother and sister participated in all aspects
of this project, from the planning to the archives to the field to the lab and beyond. They
never hesitated to pitch in at any time on any task. My mother, Beverly Hatchett, made
the salt works come back to life through her artwork; her drawings are an invaluable
addition to this project. Bennett Kimbell has worked beside me through the entire
process as well, and his love and faith in me have carried me through the project.

ABSTRACT
Historical and archaeological investigations at site 41AS95, a mid-nineteenth century
salt works on the Texas coast, have revealed previously-unknown information about a
facility that likely provided salt to the local community of Lamar as well as to the
network of towns and villages surrounding Copano Bay. Captain James W. Byrne, an
Irish land speculator, helped to found the town of Lamar and built the salt works, which
was in operation from sometime after 1851 to around 1862. Archaeological evidence
suggests that the St. Charles Bay salt works may have consisted of a number of elements
widely separated on the landscape, and estimates are provided for the amount of salt that
could have been produced at the site. Byrne anticipated a need for local salt production
that did not become truly manifest until the Civil War, when such facilities became
relatively common and were among the high-priority targets of Union raids. Small-scale
salt production sites of the type Byrne built are relatively unknown archaeologically or
historically, so this research helps to illuminate a poorly-documented site as well as an
obscure industrial process.

CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTION
Site 41AS95 represents the remains of a mid-nineteenth-century salt-production
facility on the Texas coast near the town of Lamar (Figures 1 and 2). Lamar, Texas was
founded in 1838 by Captain James W. Byrne, George Armstrong, and George Robert
Hull (Huson 1953). As a founder of Lamar, Byrne was an important member of the
community and played a number of roles in the town, including developing the salt works
that is the focus of this thesis.
The town lies at the southern tip of the Lamar Peninsula, bounded by Copano Bay
on the west, Aransas Bay on the south, and St. Charles Bay on the east (Figure 2). Lamar
became an important community in the developing network of towns and villages around
Copano and Aransas Bays in the mid-nineteenth century. The settlements included
Lamar as well as Copano, St. Mary’s, Aransas City, Black Point, and Live Oak Point
(Figure 3). The Copano Bay area was a center of cotton production, ranching, lumber,
and shipping during this time. Efforts were made to bring the railroad to Lamar and to
establish the town as the hub of a major road system (Huson 1953). These efforts
ultimately failed because of financial limitations and the disruption caused by the Civil
War.
Lamar was founded in 1838 (Huson 1953) and reflects the history of Texas
through independence, early statehood, and the Civil War. Byrne’s salt works was in
operation from around 1851 to the early 1860s. Hobart Huson (1953), a prominent
coastal historian in the early twentieth century, wrote that the salt works was shelled by
1

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

the Federal navy in December of 1862, but no primary sources have been found that
confirm this statement. The official army records for the Confederacy and Union do not
mention this attack, and, according to the head researcher at the Naval History Center, no
official records from the U.S. Navy exist that mention this event. However, raids by
small parties on relatively insignificant sites may have gone unrecorded, especially if
they were unofficial actions (John Reilly, personal communication, January 2007). The
Federal military was present in Aransas Bay throughout most of the Civil War, capturing
merchant vessels and punishing blockade runners as well as generally harassing the
citizens of the area (Wright 1965). The military forces near Lamar likely damaged the
salt works, as salt works were common targets of Federal raids. Union forces attacked
the town of Lamar in February of 1864, and the community never fully recovered
(Wright 1965).

In 2004, landowners on the Lamar peninsula discovered remains of shellcrete
platforms on their property. Shellcrete was a common building material on the coast in
the nineteenth century. Composed of a mixture of shell, lime, and sand, shellcrete is
often referred to as “tabby,” particularly in the southeastern United States (Singleton
1996:152) (Figure 4). The landowners, Al and Diane Johnson, were interested in local
history and quickly surmised that the site represented the salt works on St. Charles Bay
that was already vaguely known to have existed, although its location was unknown
previous to the Johnsons’ discovery. The Johnsons contacted the Texas Historical
Commission (THC), and the Aransas County archaeological steward, Pat Braun, got
involved. The site was registered and designated 41AS95. The THC conducted smallscale testing in 2004, and a magnetometer survey was produced for the immediate area of
the salt works. Unfortunately, other than the magnetometer images, records of these
investigations were unavailable at the time of this report. Following the THC
investigations, Braun contacted archaeologists at Texas Tech University, initiating the
archaeological investigations carried out in December 2005 and January and March 2006.

Shortly after the archaeological field work for this project was finished,
ownership of a portion of the Johnsons’ property, including Features 1 and 2, passed to
U.S. Fish and Wildlife. The portions of the land below the high water line are now
government property.
The primary purpose of this thesis research is to gather basic information about
site 41AS95, a mid-nineteenth-century salt works on St. Charles Bay, and to document
the site. Three primary questions are addressed:
1. How did the salt works operate?
2. What role did the salt works play in the community of Lamar?
3. What was the importance of the salt works in the overall network of commerce
in the Copano Bay area?
This research is important for understanding the salt industry in Texas during the
nineteenth century and, especially, during the Civil War. Salt was an extremely valuable
commodity during this time period, and the production of salt by local individuals
contributed significantly to the salt supply in regions of the South (Lonn 1965). Coastal
salt works were uncommon in Texas compared to salt works based on brine springs or
salt domes. Such small salt works were rarely well documented, and this thesis helps to
illuminate salt-making procedures at coastal facilities. Since James Byrne requested that
his personal papers be burned after his death, very few documents exist that mention the
salt works at Lamar, so this project helps to fill a void in knowledge of a locally
important site. Furthermore, this project seeks to clarify details about the presumed
economic network that connected the Copano Bay communities to one another and to the
5

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

larger region, as well as to provide information on the economic and social situation in
the Copano Bay area before and during the Civil War. According to Walter F. Bell
(2005:219), “[t]here has been a growing interest by scholars in the study of localities”
affected by the Civil War. Research at the St. Charles Bay salt works certainly fits this
trend. In addition to exploring the history of the salt works, this project documents a site
that is threatened by coastal erosion. The site lies in a wetland area and is vulnerable to
destruction by storms and other natural processes. Therefore, it is crucial that the site be
documented before it is damaged further or destroyed completely.
This thesis is organized into five chapters, including the introduction. In Chapter
2, the research plan and methods employed for both the historical and archaeological
research are explained and described. Chapter 3 provides a background for the salt works
on St. Charles Bay by presenting a brief explanation of salt making in the nineteenth
century across the United States and, more specifically, in Texas. It also places the
Copano Bay area, the location for the salt works, in an environmental and cultural context
and provides the results of the historical research conducted for this thesis. Chapter 4
discusses the results of the archaeological research completed at the site. Finally,
Chapter 5 provides an analysis of the historical and archaeological results as well as a
discussion of the topic and the conclusions drawn from this research.

CHAPTER II
PROJECT DESIGN AND METHODS
Research Plan and Design
This project comprises two basic, and equally important, research approaches.
First, historical research provides a context for understanding the salt works as a part of a
larger historical scenario, and it supplements the archaeological field work to help answer
the primary research questions. Second, archaeological fieldwork provides details about
the salt works that are not present in the historical documents. Construction methods for
the salt works and associated features were revealed archaeologically, as was the basic
operating system.
The research plan, more specifically, involves both historical and archaeological
investigations. Background research into the general historical context of the salt works
provided a foundation for further work. Additional archival research, built upon this
foundation, yielded a more specific impression of Byrne, Lamar, and the Copano Bay
area.
Archaeological investigations included mapping, pedestrian survey, shovel
testing, and limited hand excavations. The information thus gathered was then compared
with existing data on other salt works that are known historically or archaeologically.
Finally, a synthesis of all the information from these diverse sources provided the basis
for a speculative reconstruction of the salt works.
The most important goal of this project is to document the site. The recent rash of
intense hurricanes has brought attention to the need for coastal sites to be documented
7

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

before they are destroyed, and although the salt works is somewhat protected by the
outlying St. Joseph’s island, the site was designed to be submerged and is clearly
susceptible to natural deterioration. Erosion of archaeological sites on Copano Bay is
occurring at an alarming rate, due to natural processes that are exacerbated by human
activities such as dredging (Barrera 2008).
Beyond documentation of the site, there are three primary research issues that are
addressed through archival investigation and interpretation of the archaeology. First, the
actual mechanism by which the salt works operated provides information useful to the
understanding of the salt works as an industrial site. Presumably, evaporation of salt
water was the basic principle behind its operation, but the archaeology of the salt works
itself indicates a more complicated process. Since this salt works was so poorly
documented, only the archaeology can illuminate what the site looked like and how it
operated. These details are not addressed in the historical documents, as they were often
taken for granted or considered unimportant by contemporary writers. As historical
archaeologists in the United States have recently begun investigating such industrial sites,
David R. Starbuck notes that:
We historical archaeologists have a tremendous opportunity to rediscover the
lost beliefs, values, and technologies of rural America by studying the many
abandoned or soon-to-be-demolished industrial sites. Mills, furnaces, mines, craft
shops, canals, fisheries, railroads, and many other industrial places have potential
to provide technological knowledge that is no longer used in today’s workplaces.
Too often industrial processes are forgotten in the rush to innovate and
modernize. The remains and lessons we discover at industrial sites are helping to
reconstruct a recent but poorly known past. [Starbuck 2005:146-7] [Emphasis
not in original]

8

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

Starbuck emphasizes the contributions that historical archaeology can make to the study
of small, poorly-documented industrial sites. The St. Charles Bay salt works can clearly
benefit from this perspective.
Second, it is important to examine how the salt works contributed economically
to the town of Lamar. Aspects of this question that are addressed include the number of
individuals employed by the salt works, how much salt was being produced, and by what
processes and to what places the salt was distributed. Verifying stories of Union raiding
of the salt works and the possible role of the salt works in the Civil War helps to
illuminate the importance of the site in the local economy. Some historical sources claim
that the salt works was raided shortly after the death of Captain Byrne, possibly in
retaliation against Texans on the coast for blockade running (Huson 1953). If true, this
story indicates that the salt works was an important part of the local economy and that it
may have supplied salt to Confederate garrisons in the area. Such small supply centers
are rarely mentioned in documentary records, but many existed across the South.
Finally, the synthesis of the archaeological and historical data helps to place the
St. Charles Bay salt works in the larger context of the Copano Bay economic network of
the mid-nineteenth century. Understanding how the salt works contributed to the local
economy can provide insight into the commercial networks that linked the towns of the
Copano Bay area to one another and to the rest of Texas and the Gulf coast. Because this
portion of the coast was relatively isolated, many items were probably produced locally
and distributed to towns in the Copano Bay area. While there may have been a number
of small salt works on this portion of the coast, Byrne’s is the only one that is known
9

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

from historical sources or from archaeology. Thus, the St. Charles Bay salt works was
likely a primary provider of salt throughout the local community of towns and villages.
Archaeological investigations have revealed the basic structure of the site
including the salt works and possible related structures, and these finds are compared to
existing literature on archaeologically-known salt works throughout the southern United
States and elsewhere. Information about the way the salt works was constructed was
gathered during archaeological fieldwork and provides a framework for estimating salt
yields and labor requirements at this facility. Historical sources that are incorporated
include both published syntheses of Copano Bay and Civil War history as well as many
primary documents. Archival materials including probate records, correspondence,
maps, land documents, and census information are used whenever possible to provide
first-hand information on many aspects of the salt works, Captain Byrne, the town of
Lamar, and the Copano Bay area.
Methods
Historical Research
Research conducted at the archives at the Texas General Land Office (GLO), the
Texas State Library and Archives (TSLA), the Catholic Archives of Texas, and the
Center for American History (CAH) at The University of Texas at Austin (UT) yielded
significant documentary information regarding the salt works, the town of Lamar, and
other pertinent issues. The GLO provided plat maps and other land records as well as
maps relating to the town of Lamar and the central Texas coast. Captain Byrne’s military
records and other documents relating to Byrne and the founding of Lamar, including
10

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

coasting manifests and shipping records, are held at the TSLA. While these records are
helpful in illuminating certain aspects of life during the time period, none of them
specifically mention Byrne’s salt. The Catholic Archives of Texas yielded records
relating peripherally to Captain James W. Byrne and his extended family, as well as to
the town of Lamar during the mid-nineteenth century. The CAH was by far the most
helpful repository for this research; a number of primary sources relating to many aspects
of Byrne’s life, the salt works, and the town of Lamar are held there.
Additional documents found at the courthouses in Rockport and Refugio include
land ownership and probate records. A set of detailed county scrapbooks, compiled by
Doris Ruttiger of Rockport and located at the Rockport public library, provided many
interesting tidbits of local lore as well as some primary sources.
The Cincinnati, Ohio main city library yielded additional information on James
Byrne and his wife and family, since Byrne had lived in Cincinnati before moving to
Texas. The library provided access to census records and city directories, many of which
have been compiled into books in the last thirty years.
The exhaustive search for primary sources has yielded a wealth of information on
Byrne, Lamar, and the network of towns on Copano Bay. Although few documents
mention the salt works itself, these resources provide insight into Byrne’s life and
ambitions, his family, and his business contacts and affairs. Correspondence and
business records of Byrne’s peers also contribute to an overall understanding of
circumstances in the region at the time. Contemporary maps show towns and settlements
that were considered important enough by the mapmakers to be included. When all the
11

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

information available from such primary sources is carefully considered, an image of life
in the Copano Bay area in the mid-nineteenth century begins to appear.
Archaeology at the St. Charles Bay Salt Works
After a preliminary visit to the salt works site in June 2005, a plan for field work
was developed. The research plan was designed to be flexible to adapt to unexpected
discoveries. The fieldwork itself ran for a total of 19 days in December of 2005 and in
January and March of 2006, during which time volunteers from Texas Tech University
worked at the salt works site and in the surrounding area at the invitation of the land
owners. Fieldwork sessions ran from December 14 through 21, 2005, and from January 4
through 8 and March 12 through 17, 2006. The crew for the December session included
13 Texas Tech University students, and the January and March crews had seven members
each. A total of 15 students participated in the field project.
The fieldwork consisted of four primary components: survey, mapping, shovel
testing, and excavation. Field methods were adapted from the following sources:
Carmichael et al. (2003), Collins and Molyneaux (2003), Hester et al. (1997), and Stewart
(2002). Prior to the crew’s arrival, the landowner cleared vegetation from the main area
around the visible features, and, as work progressed, he cleared additional areas to make
them more accessible and features more visible. A detailed daily field journal was kept,
in which notations were made about weather and environmental conditions, observations,
and other pertinent issues. In addition, photographs were used to document features,
excavation units, shovel tests, vegetation, topography, and unit profiles.

12

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

The crew surveyed over 42 acres of land in search of traces of human activity.
The survey area included a portion of land between the shore and the tree line and about
100 meters north and 300 meters south of the exposed salt works features (Figure 5).
Promising areas were marked, and records were made of the artifacts and features
specific to each. Transects were set at 30-meter intervals, and two surveyors were
assigned to each transect. The starting and ending points of each transect were recorded
using a portable GPS unit. Transects ran perpendicular to both the shore and the tree line,
or roughly east-to-west. Surface visibility was generally low (0 –10%) above the highwater mark, as natural vegetation obscured the ground surface.

To facilitate mapping, the crew established a 5-x-5-meter grid across the primary
salt works area, incorporating both features that were originally recognized by the
landowners (Features 1 and 2, designated Area A). These features include a small
13

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

rectangular shellcrete border, Feature 1, and a large rectangular shellcrete platform,
Feature 2. A standard mechanical transit was used to lay out the grid lines. The grid
covered an area of about 240 square meters, or 30 meters north to south and 80 meters
east to west, and was oriented toward magnetic north. Each 5-x-5-meter block was
marked by colored pin flags at the corners. The primary horizontal datum was arbitrarily
set at N1000, E1000, elevation 10.0 meters, and marked the northwest corner of the grid.
This datum was marked with a permanent aluminum cap set in concrete. As work
progressed and excavations were opened, a second permanent datum was set at N900,
E760, with an elevation of 12.57 meters (based on location relative to the primary
datum). The second datum point created a reference for Feature 3, an alignment of
shellcrete blocks, and Feature 4, marked by a pattern of eroding shell hash. This datum
and the two associated features (Features 3 and 4, designated Area B) were tied into the
original grid during the production of the master site map. A total data station (a Sokkia
SET 5E) was used to record the exact locations of each shovel test and excavation unit,
including surface elevations. The total station data allowed for accurate mapping of the
site features and the incorporation of these features into a Geographic Information
Systems (GIS) program, which was used to create a master site map (Figure 6). The
locations of each datum cap and all shovel tests and excavation units were also recorded
using a handheld Global Positioning Systems (GPS) unit.

Areas that appeared promising in terms of historical remains based on the
pedestrian survey were further investigated through shovel testing, and shovel tests were
also conducted in the vicinity of known features to determine the extent of each. Several
sandy dunes were tested for evidence of human activity, and additional shovel test pits
were randomly placed for more extensive sampling and to partially compensate for the
limited surface visibility. In all, thirty-two shovel tests were completed, and all fill from
each shovel test was screened through ¼-inch wire mesh. The location of each shovel
test pit was either marked on the grid map for Features 1 and 2 (discussed below) or
recorded using a portable GPS unit. These locations were later incorporated into the
master site map (Figure 6). Shovel tests were at least 30 centimeters in diameter and
were dug in approximately 20-centimeter levels to a depth of 1 meter or to the level of
the water table. Artifacts exposed during these shovel tests were collected in bags
marked with the shovel test number and location as well as the excavation level in which
they were found.
Excavation units were first placed around Features 1 and 2 (Area A), and then
units were added around the two newly-identified features discovered during survey,
Features 3 and 4 (Area B). Units were placed in specific locations in order to reveal as
much data on building methods and feature configuration as possible. Units were
designated by year and a unit number corresponding to the order in which they were
established, from 2005-1 to 2005-14 and 2006-1 to 2006-6. Excavation units were
generally 1 x 1 meter in size, while some were later expanded to 1-x-2 meter or 2-x-2
meter units. Soil was removed from the units in arbitrary 10-centimeter levels, and all
16

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

soil was screened through ¼ -inch hardware cloth. Initially, the extent and function of
the two features first identified during survey (Features 3 and 4, discussed below) was
unknown. Therefore, vertical provenience for the first excavation units at each of the
new features was established based on centimeters below surface elevation. As the
excavations were expanded, vertical provenience was established using a transit and
stadia rod based on the elevation of 12.57 meters set at the location of the datum cap for
Area B. This elevation was based on relation to the primary datum (set at 10.0 meters).
Each level in every excavation unit was documented on a level form on which
excavators recorded elevations, soil characteristics, artifacts recovered, and other
pertinent information. Level forms also provided space for mapping in situ artifacts and
features. Artifacts from each level were collected in level bags, as were samples of
architectural materials. All level bags were marked with field provenience information,
which was double-checked against the related field form at the end of each day for
accuracy.
After the fieldwork was complete, the level bags were taken to the Texas Tech
University archaeology laboratory for artifact processing. In the lab, each bag was
assigned a lot number that correlates to a specific level in a specific excavation unit or to
a shovel test. A total of 68 lot numbers was assigned, and the lot numbers were
catalogued with their corresponding provenience information. In the lab, artifacts were
weighed and counted. Metal artifacts were coated with oil to retard further corrosion, and
all artifacts were placed in archival-quality bags for storage.

The archaeological field work for this project led to additional historical research
and examination of comparable field projects. Historical data and the results of
archaeological investigations of other salt works were necessary in order to help interpret
the remains found at the St. Charles Bay salt works.
Although no single theoretical approach guided the interpretation of the data
recovered during this project, several formal theories are reflected in various aspects of
the syntheses and conclustions. Historical archaeology inherently involves the use of
both historical documents and the archaeological record. How these two sets of data
should be used and understood in relation to one another is an ongoing discussion among
historical archaeologists. In this project, the historical documents that were available are
understood as artifacts, as much products of the times and places of their creation as are
the structures of the salt works themselves. Documents must be evaluated with an
understanding of the objectives and biases of the people who created them (Hicks and
Beaudry 2006). Additionally, in attempting to understand Byrne’s motivations in
building the salt works, the site’s role in the larger world system must be taken into
account (Wallerstein 1989). Interestingly, Byrne apparently was attempting to make
Lamar less dependent on the external world than it had been by creating a local industry
to create a product that otherwise had to be imported. Larger forces intruded upon the
salt works during the period of the Civil War, when the conflict between the Union and
the Confederacy was felt throughout the United States. Finally, the St. Charles Bay salt
works cannot be evaluated adequately without examining its presence on the physical
landscape (Palmer and Neaverson 1994). The landscape itself determined the form and
18

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

location of the salt works, as only on that piece of available land was there the correct
combination of solid earth, briny marsh, wind and sun exposure, and nearby fuel needed
for the operation of such an industry. Thus, this thesis reflects various theoretical
approaches in the interpretation of documents, motivations, and the landscape.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Site Background
Setting
Environment
Site 41AS95 is located on St. Charles Bay, a narrow inlet that feeds into Aransas
Bay on the eastern side of the Lamar Peninsula (known as Lookout Peninsula before the
founding of Lamar). On the west side of the Lamar Peninsula is Copano Bay. The bay is
fed by Copano Creek and by the Mission River, which empties into Mission Bay, a small
bay on the northwest side of Copano Bay. Aransas Bay separates Copano and St. Charles
Bays from the Gulf of Mexico (Figure 7).

This network of bays is located in the region of Texas known as the Gulf Coast
Plain (Black 1989). Much of the Texas coastline is protected by barrier islands, which
buffer the coast somewhat from storms but create treacherous conditions for boats. St.
Joseph’s Island separates Copano Bay from the Gulf of Mexico. Further southwest along
the coast, the hypersaline bay known as the Laguna Madre provided a less habitable
coastal environment than that of the central coast (Black 1989).
Salt marshes and lagoons are common between the barrier islands and the
mainland, and the estuaries that make up much of the coast have provided rich resources
for people from prehistoric times to the present (Black 1989). Shellfish such as oyster
and lightning whelk abound in the estuaries and lagoons of the central Texas coast, and
shell reefs are common in St. Charles, Copano, and Aransas Bays. Fish species found in
these bays include red drum, black drum, sheepshead, southern flounder, and mullet
(Ricklis 1996). Many of these fish species are still found in great abundance in this area
during the winter to early spring.
The land on which the salt works was located includes both marshland and
grassland. Features 1 and 2, two rectangular platforms, (Figure 6) are below the current
high water line and are intermittently inundated. The vegetation in this area is composed
largely of salt-tolerant plants (Figure 8). Features 3 and 4, a circular structure of
shellcrete blocks and a possible architectural foundation, (Figure 6) are slightly more
inland and located on land that currently is covered in grasses, prickly pear cactus, and
mesquite (Figure 9). Further inland about 300 meters, the tree line is made up primarily
of mesquite, but live oak is also common.

Soils
The St. Charles Bay salt works is located in part of the Galveston-MustangDianola soil area, which is characterized by relatively level to undulating sandy soils that
are rapidly permeable and nonsaline through extremely saline. Soils of this type are
common in low coastal areas, such as that where St. Charles Bay is located (Guckian and
Garcia 1979). Mustang fine sand, soils of the Galveston-Mustang association, and soils
of the Barrada-Tatton association were all encountered during excavations of the salt
works. Mustang fine sands are variably saline, depending on the length of time since they
were last flooded by salt water, while the Galveston-Mustang association is characterized
by deep, poorly drained, relatively level sandy soils (Guckian and Garcia 1979). The
Barrada-Tatton association soils are highly-saline soils usually found along lagoons and
bays and are composed of a combination of Barrada clay and Tatton fine sand. The water
table is typically found at depths of 6 to 36 inches in this association, and soils are rarely
dry more than 10 inches below the surface (Guckian and Garcia 1979).
Prehistory to Early History (ca. 2000 B.C. – A.D. 1830)
The Copano Bay area has been significant to the development of Texas
throughout both prehistory and the historic period. While the historic period of Copano
Bay is relatively well known, the prehistory of the area is not clearly understood. Several
sites have been excavated in this area, but most of the work was done in the early part of
the twentieth century, and the analysis has not been fully reported for most of these sites
(See, for example: Campbell 1947, Campbell 1952, Campbell 1958, Martin n.d.). Still,

23

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

several prehistoric cultural manifestations that are represented archaeologically have been
identified.
Archaic Period: Aransas Focus (ca. 2000 B.C. –A.D. 1200)
Prewitt and Paine (1987) estimate that Copano Bay was exposed to sea water
around 7000 to 8000 B.C., but no stratified sites have been identified in this area that date
to before ca. 2000 B.C., when Aransas focus occupations are first apparent. The Aransas
focus was defined first by T.N. Campbell in 1947 in the Bulletin of the Texas
Archeological and Paleontological Society. Campbell’s article describes the Johnson site
on Copano Bay and names it the type site for the Aransas focus, which is based not only
on the Johnson site but also on the Kent-Crane and Live Oak Point sites. In 1989, Black
reported that what he calls the “Aransas complex” first appeared during the Middle
Archaic period, probably after 2000 B.C. However, Aransas complex materials as
defined by Black (1989) become more distinctive and more common during the Late
Archaic, beginning around 400 B.C. Black (1989) notes that the Aransas complex
encompasses the area of the coast from south of San Antonio Bay to north of Baffin Bay
and approximately 130 kilometers inland. Campbell’s (1947:63) description of the
Aransas focus is based on “the absence of pottery from the lower levels of some shell
midden sites” and the presence of a particular complex of artifacts made of bone, stone,
and shell. The absence of pottery in shell middens separates the Aransas complex from
the Late Prehistoric Rockport phase which is characterized by sandy paste ceramics.
Campbell (1947) describes Aransas complex people as coastal nomads who created large
shell middens that demonstrated their reliance on marine mollusks as well as fish, turtles,
24

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

aquatic birds, and some terrestrial mammals. Bone artifacts associated with the Aransas
complex include bird bone beads as well as awls and elongated pins of mammal bones
that are occasionally decorated with incised and drilled designs. The Aransas complex is
associated with large projectile points with plain or side-notched stems and short
triangular points with alternately beveled lateral edges and include Bell, Matamoros,
Catan, Abasolo, Gary, and Nolan point types (Campbell 1958; Prewitt and Paine 1987).
Lithic knives, gravers, and scrapers are not found in great quantities but are associated
with the Aransas complex as well. Ricklis (2004) dismisses the concept of the Aransas
focus as obsolete and obscuring the variations across time and space seen in the coastal
Archaic. The concept is still in use by many archaeologists, however.
Late Prehistoric to Historic Period: Rockport Phase (ca. A.D. 1200–1830)
The best known manifestation of Late Prehistoric occupation on the central Texas
coast is the Rockport Phase, defined by Sayles in 1935. Ricklis (2004) considers the
phase concept to be applicable in this situation, because there is clear definition of the
artifact assemblage in both time and space. Black (1989) refers to the assemblage
associated with this period as the “Rockport Complex,” and suggests dates from circa
A.D. 1200-1830. Rockport phase sites are defined primarily by the presence of Rockport
ware pottery, which is found in a zone about 40 kilometers wide along the coast between
Matagorda and Baffin Bays and has been correlated with the range of the historically
known Karankawa Indians (Ricklis 2004). Two primary site types have been recognized
for Rockport phase sites. The first group includes large, thick middens with abundant
artifacts and a profusion of fish bones and mollusk shells, indicating intensive occupation
25

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

and fishing activity. Seasonality analyses indicate these types of sites were occupied
primarily in the fall through early spring when fish are most abundant in these central
coastal bays and terrestrial resources are relatively scarce. These sites likely represent
seasonal aggregation of groups into large communities on the shoreline for fishing
(Ricklis 2004). The second site type includes small, thin deposits on streams and near the
heads of bays. Sites of this nature reflect a focus on hunting of large terrestrial game by
small groups of people during the spring and summer months (Ricklis 2004).
The Rockport Phase artifact assemblage is very similar to that of the central Texas
Toyah Phase except for the presence of Rockport ware pottery instead of the Leon Plain
pottery found at Toyah sites. Rockport Phase artifacts include arrow points, mostly
Perdiz points, as well as small unifacial end scrapers, and flaked drills or perforators.
This phase is also characterized by the reappearance of prismatic blade-core technology,
not seen since the Paleoindian period (Ricklis 2004). Rockport ware pottery has a sandy
paste, is sometimes bone tempered, and is often coated or decorated with asphaltum,
which naturally washes up on the shores of the central Texas coast. Bone and shell tools
and simple ornaments, as well as ceramic smoking pipes, are also often found in
Rockport Phase contexts (Ricklis 2004).
Like the Toyah phase, the Rockport phase has been associated with an increased
reliance on bison hunting. In fact, Ricklis (1992) suggests that the appearance of what is
recognized as the Rockport phase represents the adoption of a central Texas bison
hunting and processing toolkit by preexisting groups on the central Texas coast. The fact
that the Rockport people did not adopt the characteristic Leon Plain pottery of the Toyah
26

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

phase may indicate an indigenous pottery style was already in use on the coast before the
adoption of the Toyah phase toolkit by coastal dwellers (Ricklis 1992). The existence of
arrow point forms such as Scallorn may also indicate an earlier Late Prehistoric
manifestation than the classic Rockport phase (Ricklis 2004). The increase of bison
availability on the coast did not result in a complete abandonment of seasonal coastal
migration, but it did provide an economic opportunity that indigenous coastal people
exploited.
Associated with the Rockport phase, the Karankawa Indians were living on this
central portion of the coast when the first Europeans arrived. European writings about
the Karankawa often describe a tall, aggressive population that practiced cannibalism
(Ricklis 1996). Conflict between European settlers and the native people of the coast
began with LaSalle’s colony (discussed below) and continued well into the nineteenth
century, although the native groups in question varied.
Early History (1519 – 1864)
Although the Spanish were well established in Mexico by the middle of the
sixteenth century, they had little interest in the lands now known as Texas until word
spread that the Frenchman, La Salle, had founded a colony at Matagorda Bay in 1685
(Bruseth and Turner 2005; Mathes 2005). A few Spanish expeditions are worth
mentioning, however.
In 1519, Alonso Álvarez de Pineda was commissioned to search for a passage that
was thought to separate Florida from the mainland of the New World. The explorer
started his journey in Jamaica, rounded the end of Florida, and followed the Gulf coast
27

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

until he came to Veracruz. There is no evidence that he disembarked at any point, but he
created the earliest known map of the Texas coast (Kelsey 1998; Mathes 2005).
The famous journey of Alvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca and his companions
between 1528 and 1536 from Florida to the Pacific coast of New Spain took the four
survivors of the expedition across the Texas coast (Kelsey 1998). Correlations to any
specific locations on the coast with the writings from this expedition, however, are
difficult to make. Several other Spanish expeditions passed through the region, but
overall this northern frontier was neglected by Europeans until the late seventeenth
century.
In 1685, Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, landed on the Texas coast and
founded the ill-fated settlement of Fort Saint Louis on Matagorda Bay (Bruseth and
Turner 2005). Word spread about the Frenchman’s activities, and the Spanish began to
pay attention to what they claimed as their lands on the Texas coast. In 1686, Alonzo de
León began a search for La Salle’s colony (Mathes 2005). His journeys along the Rio
Grande were unsuccessful. The same year another Spanish expedition, led by Martín de
Rivas and Pedro de Iriarte, discovered La Salle’s abandoned ship La Belle but also failed
to locate the French colony (Mathes 2005). In April 1689, Alonzo de León finally
succeeded in locating the site of Fort Saint Louis, where he discovered the French settlers
had been massacred by Karankawa Indians (Foster 1995; Mathes 2005). The following
year de León returned to Matagorda Bay by roughly the same overland route he had used
in 1689, and then his expedition continued inland and to the north (Foster 1995).

28

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

In 1722, the Spanish built their own presidio, Nuestra Señora de Loreto en La
Bahía del Espíritu Santo, known as La Bahía, over the remains of the French Fort Saint
Louis at Matagorda Bay (Bruseth et al. 2004a; Bruseth et al. 2004b). The founding of
this presidio was part of a concentrated effort by the Spanish to increase their presence in
east Texas, in hopes of deterring further French settlement (Bruseth et al. 2004a, Bruseth
et al. 2004b). Following this activity, Spanish occupation in Texas began to increase.
According to Huson (1953), a fort called Aranzazu was built by the Spanish at
Live Oak Point (near present-day Fulton) in the middle of the eighteenth century, and
another fortification was built on St. Joseph’s Island near Aransas Pass at the same time.
The town of Goliad was created with the relocation of the mission and presidio of La
Bahia in 1749 (Huson 1953). Mission Refugio was founded in 1790 and formed the core
of the settlement of Refugio, which became one of the major towns in this region of
Texas for the next 150 years (Huson 1953). During the last half of the eighteenth
century, Spanish ranchos were established in this region, and by the time Mexico gained
its independence from Spain in 1821, much of the land was used for ranching.
During the Mexican period (between 1821 and 1836), a number of immigrants,
especially Irish, were granted land in Texas as empresarios. The Mexican government
granted these lands in an effort to discourage intrusion by American settlers; the Irish
were considered less threatening than Americans because of their Catholicism (Huson
1953). Empresarios entered into contracts with the Mexican government. In return for
land, the empresario agreed to settle a certain number of families on the land within a
specific time frame (Oberste 1953). Many of these land grant contracts were never truly
29

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

fulfilled, and when Texas fought for independence from Mexico, many empresarios who
had not complied with their promises fought for independence.
Salt Works Background
Salt Making in the Nineteenth Century
The earliest commercial salt works operated on the principle of procuring salt
through the evaporation of brine. In the United States even rock salt was accessed, prior
to the development of efficient mining techniques, by pumping water into underground
rock salt deposits to dissolve the salt into a brine which was then pumped out of the
ground and boiled to evaporate off the water. Other sources of brine for salt making
included brine springs and seawater. Brine evaporation was accomplished through three
primary methods: solar evaporation, boiling, or using what is known as a “thorn house”
or “graduation chamber,” in which salt water is poured over piles of thorny branches or
straw, respectively. In this third method, the salt water is thus distributed over a large
surface area, speeding the evaporation of the water (Fielding and Fielding 2006, Multhauf
1978).
In the United States, one of the major centers for commercial salt production since
the nineteenth century has been the Kanawha Valley in West Virginia (Updike 2001).
Brine springs and seeps attracted salt makers, who gathered salt water and boiled it in
large kettles, a process that gradually increased in capacity and complexity. A typical
early furnace in the valley consisted of two parallel walls that formed a flue above which
kettles would be placed. A firebox at one end of the flue provided heat that traveled
along the length of the flue, under the kettles, and out a chimney at the other end (Updike
30

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

2001). As Updike (2001:42) explains, “The process of making salt with this type of
furnace went as follows: The central feature was the furnace that evaporated salt from the
brine pumped from nearby wells. An elevated storage cistern fed the brine by gravity
through pipe logs to the kettles. Wooden stopcocks on each kettle controlled the flow of
water.” The first furnaces were built in the Kanawha Valley in the late eighteenth
century by families and, later, entrepreneurs who often rented their furnaces to others.
The valley experienced an industrial boom during the War of 1812, when large
government orders for salt encouraged expansion and the British blockade of the coast
limited imports to the Gulf coast and eastern states (Updike 2001). When the war ended,
salt prices dropped, endangering the industry of the Kanawha Valley. In 1817, to
stabilize prices, salt makers formed the Kanawha Salt Company, “the first industrial
cartel in American history” (Updike 2001:40). Most of the salt produced in this region
was transported to meat-processing centers in Cincinnati and Louisville via the Ohio
River. During the Civil War, the Kanawha Valley was an object of conflict, as both sides
in the war valued the salt and other resources produced in this area.
Archaeological remains associated with the Kanawha Valley salt works consist
primarily of furnaces. Archaeologically, these furnaces appear as piles of burned earth
and rocks with associated concentrations of cinders and coal (Updike 2001). The remains
of one of two furnaces found in 1999 suggested a more complex system of salt
production than simple evaporation by boiling. However, the other furnace appeared to
have operated on the basic principle described above, with a large trench over which
kettles or pans were placed as heat circulated below (Updike 2001).
31

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

At Boone’s Lick in Howard County, Missouri, several salt works were operated
between 1805 and 1833 (Bray 1987). These operations included six furnaces fed by two
brine springs. At this site, limited archaeological testing revealed wooden elements in a
remarkable state of preservation. Archaeologists discovered remains of a “brineelevating delivery system” and two structures that sheltered the mechanisms (Bray
1987:1). A wooden drive shaft for a treadwheel pump was found, and preserved sections
of wood provided evidence for a wooden aqueduct measuring an estimated 168 meters in
length. The aqueduct comprised a wooden trough that carried salt water from the
treadwheel pump, which pumped brine from underground, to several boiling furnaces
(Bray 1987). The well-preserved remains at Boone’s Lick emphasize the poor
preservation at other sites and the types of structures that were likely present at other salt
works.
Salt Making in Texas
Salt making at historic inland sites in Texas is reasonably well known. A number
of locales supplied with salt lakes or salt springs have been archaeologically investigated,
and more are known from historic records (Baker 1986; Skinner 1971). Among the
known nineteenth-century Texas saltworks were Bonner’s Saltworks in Anderson
County, Fort Worth Salt Company Saltworks and Lone Star Saltworks in Mitchell
County, Grand Saline Saltworks in Van Zandt County, Jordan and McGee Saltworks in
Kaufman County, and Steen Saltworks in Smith County (Baker 1986).
At the Neches Saline in Smith County, Texas, archaeologist S. Alan Skinner
(1971) investigated the commercial salt production conducted at that site between 1820
32

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

and 1870. Ten furnaces and eight furnace locations were identified during the
archaeological survey. At the Neches Saline in the nineteenth century, families could
buy salt from a salt maker or could rent kettles for making their own salt. According to
Skinner (1971:15), “[w]ater was collected in wells located on the prairie and piped to the
furnaces through a cedar trough pipeline….The water was poured into the kettles at the
furnace and was evaporated to yield the salt….Kettles were moved on and off the furnace
with the help of an A-frame.” These historic salt works, like some others based on brine
springs, conformed to a basic construction system, described by Skinner (1971:15-16)
and shown in Figure 10:
The furnace was a long trench lined with stone on both sides, and consisted of
three contiguous parts. These three sections are the firebed, the flue or cooking
area, and the chimney, in that order. A draft ran from the firebed at one end of the
trench through the cooking area and up the chimney at the opposite end of the
trench. An iron sheet covered the fire and cooking areas, and heat was funneled
under the sheet to the chimney where it escaped….Heavy iron grates spanned the
width of the trench in the fire area and logs were laid on the grates. The grates
were set above the trench floor about 1.5 feet, so that ashes could fall and be
removed easily. The trench was 4 feet wide in the cooking area, and the cast-iron
sheet which covered the trench had holes into which the kettles were placed.
Skinner (1971) also mentions that a walkway adjacent to the flue/cooking area was
necessary so workers could tend the kettles. This arrangement of kettles over a flue was
also typical of sugar-refining operations, which essentially used the same methods for
making sugar from sugar cane juice that was used for making salt from brine (Fox 1983).
At the Sutherland Plantation in Jackson County, a circular firebox with an iron grate was
found. Beneath the grate was a pit into which ashes would fall from the burning wood
above (Fox 1983).

Unfortunately, documentary information on historic coastal salt works in Texas is
limited. At the town of Velasco (only a small settlement at the time), at the mouth of the
Brazos River and northeast of Lamar, Asa Mitchell had a salt works as early as 1825
(Earls et al. 1996). Mitchell wrote to Stephen F. Austin in 1826 of his journey to New
Orleans to purchase a set of salt kettles (Earls et al. 1996). Although he apparently did
not find the kettles he needed, this letter lends support to the idea that the central Gulf
coast of Texas was not conducive to efficiently gathering salt through solar
evaporation alone. Moreover, Mitchell’s need for kettles at Velasco to at least expedite
salt making supports the hypothesis that Byrne’s salt works also used kettles for boiling
the brine (discussed in Chapter 5). After the Battle of Velasco in 1832, which essentially
destroyed the town that had existed up to that point, Velasco was rebuilt (Earls et al.
1996). The town association stipulated that salt wells or salt furnaces could not be built
in the town, possibly to protect the interests of Mitchell, whose salt works lay just outside
the town limits (Earls et al. 1996). Unfortunately, excavations at Velasco have not
located remains of this salt works.
Salt and the Civil War
The Union Blockade of the Coast
In April of 1861, President Lincoln instituted a blockade of the southern states of
Texas, South Carolina, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, and Louisiana; North Carolina was
added shortly thereafter (Thornton and Ekelund 2004). Lincoln hoped to end the war
quickly by placing a cordon of ships along the coastline of the South to cut off supplies
coming into the South and stop exports that provided income to the Confederate States.
35

By the end of 1861, the blockade was noticeably affecting supplies and prices. The
South depended heavily on cotton exports for income, and, after the first year of the war,
cotton exports had declined by 99 percent (Thornton and Ekelund 2004). The effect on
imports was no less extreme. The southern states imported wool, coffee, tea, medicines,
textiles, shoes, iron, and salt. All of these items became increasingly scarce in the South
as the blockade continued (Thornton and Ekelund 2004). Across the South, efforts were
made to develop local production of these commodities. In an attempt to make Texas self
sufficient, the military board encouraged the development of natural resources such as
salt and iron (Jewett 2002).
The South, despite having some natural salt deposits, imported almost all of its
salt from abroad. England and the West Indies were the principal suppliers of salt to the
United States in the years before the war, and, according to Lonn (1965), a fourth of all
salt shipped from England was brought to the port of New Orleans. Most of the salt
imported to Texas came through New Orleans. The blockade of the coast severely
affected the availability of salt, forcing the development of local production (Lonn 1965).
For the approximately nine million people in the Confederacy, the adjutant
general of Alabama estimated a requirement of three hundred million pounds of salt a
year, which was somewhat less than the pre-war consumption of 50 pounds of salt per
capita per year (Lonn 1965). Butter was heavily salted, eggs were commonly packed in
salt, cattle and horse feed had to be supplemented with salt, and salt was also necessary
for preserving hides until they could be tanned (Lonn 1965). The largest need for salt,
however, was for meat preservation. The only available methods for preserving meat at
36

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

the time were salting and smoking, and great quantities of salt were required for the
former. Experts recommended the use of two bushels of salt (about 100 pounds) per
1,000 pounds of pork, or one and one quarter bushels (about 70 pounds) of salt for 500
pounds of beef (Lonn 1965). In J. De Cordova’s (1969:30) book on Texas (originally
published in 1858), the author includes a section “On Salting Meat,” which provides
insight into contemporary thought on the issue:
From necessity, much the larger portion of animal food consumed in Texas is
salted meat; and as it is important that, under these circumstances, it should be
properly prepared, and as so few people understand the art, we give the following
process, being fully satisfied that those who will take the trouble will be amply
repaid by the superior flavor and nutriment that meat salted on this plan possesses
over that which is cured by the common manner.
Starvation was widespread in the South during the Civil War, in part because of the lack
of salt for preserving meat. Herds of livestock were available for sale, but many people
went without meat because it could not be preserved. Livestock in areas without natural
salt deposits sickened and died from lack of salt in their diets (Lonn 1965). People
resorted to extreme measures to procure salt, as Lonn (1965:51–52) explains:
All the brine in the troughs and barrels where pork or beef had been salted was
carefully dipped up, boiled down, and again converted to salt…the salty earth
under the old smokehouses, impregnated with the drippings of years, was dug up
and placed in hoppers…with a trough underneath to catch the seeping water as it
percolated through the hopper. The resulting brine was boiled down to the proper
point, poured into vessels, and set in the sun in order to complete the rude process
by evaporation. The residuum was unsightly in color, but it answered the
purpose, especially for the stock, and was accepted without complaint, if not
always gratefully.
The desperate need for salt across the South fueled the development of local production,
although many small-scale operations apparently were never documented.

37

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

During the Civil War, the Florida coast became a major salt-production area for
the South. As a result, it also became a target of Union raiding and attacks. Several large
commercial salt works are known historically and archaeologically, especially near St.
Andrews Bay, where as many as 5,000 people were engaged in salt making at various
facilities during the Civil War (Wayne and Ashton 1997). The Federal navy repeatedly
attacked the various salt works on St. Andrews Bay, but the destroyed operations were
quickly replaced with new ones (Wayne and Ashton 1997). While these large operations
have similarities to the small salt works at Lamar, their scale is entirely different. More
comparable, however, is a small nineteenth-century salt works at Salt Island, Florida that
was investigated through pedestrian survey in 1977 by M. F. Dickinson and G. W.
Edwardson (1984). The investigators noted that the salt works at this site comprised two
identified furnaces, represented today only by large piles of rock. Portions of cast iron
kettles, glass, and fragments of a clay pipe were scattered nearby (Dickinson and
Edwardson 1984). The archaeologists searched for evidence of a camp or domestic area
for salt makers, but no such occupation area was found.
Results of Archival Research
Captain James W. Byrne and His Family
Although his name is not recognized like that of Sam Houston, Stephen F. Austin,
or William Barrett Travis, James W. Byrne was intimately involved in the development
of Texas. Byrne was a cotton farmer, a cattle rancher, an entrepreneur, a land speculator,
a soldier, and one of the founders of the town of Lamar. He also built the small salt
works that forms the basis of this thesis. Byrne’s life prior to 1812 is difficult to trace.
38

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

Hobart Huson, a coastal historian of the first half of the twentieth century, reported that
Byrne was born in County Wicklow, Ireland around 1787 (Huson 1953). The year Byrne
and his siblings immigrated to the United States is unknown, but by 1812 he was living in
Kentucky or Ohio.
Byrne is listed in the War of 1812 service records as a member of Lieutenant
Colonel Ball’s Squadron Light Dragoons, U.S. Volunteers. Byrne’s military record
indicates that he entered the squadron as a private and was discharged as a corporal
(NARA Index to the Compiled Military Service records for the volunteer soldiers who
served during the War of 1812, Roll Box 31, Roll Exct: 602). A statement written by his
granddaughter, Anna Byrne, explains that Byrne fought at Sandusky, Fort Meigs, and
Fort William Henry in the War of 1812 (Statement of Federal Damages, Lamar Town
Tract).
Byrne married Harriett Oden on September 19, 1814, in Franklin County,
Kentucky (Franklin County, KY Marriage Records, 1790-1815, v.1). In 1817, William
Oden Byrne, the only child of James and Harriett Byrne, was born (U.S. and International
Marriage Records 1560-1900 [Ancestry.com]).
The 1817 Cincinnati, Ohio census lists a James W. Byrne, with no enumeration
(Dickoré 1960), and Preble County, Ohio deed records indicate that James W. Byrne was
living in Hamilton County, Ohio in 1818 and in Cincinnati, Ohio (in Hamilton County) in
1819 (Short and Bowers 1978). The Cincinnati City Directory for 1825 lists one James
Byrne, a brewer, as an occupant of Cincinnati. Whether this is the James W. Byrne in
question is unclear, in part because James W. and Harriet (sic) Byrne are listed as
39

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

residents of Louisville, Kentucky in 1824 Preble County deed records (Gilbert and Short
1987; Hall 1988).
In the 1830 U.S. Federal Census, a James W. Byrne is listed as living in the upper
suburbs of New Orleans, Louisiana, in a household consisting of one male, age 20–30
and one female, age 30–40, plus three female slaves (1830 New Orleans Census).
Whether or not this is the same James W. Byrne is unclear, but it is known that Captain
Byrne of Refugio County, Texas had a brother, Charles, who lived in New Orleans. It
seems likely that the James W. in New Orleans in 1830 is the same James W. who ends
up in Refugio County, Texas. Also in the 1830 U.S. Federal Census, there is a James
Byrne listed as living in the east ward of Cincinnati, Ohio in a household of one male 20–
30, and three females between the ages of 15 and 60 (Hamilton County, Ohio, City of
Cincinnati, East Ward Census Schedule 1830).
According to Hobart Huson (1953), Byrne was a member of Fraser’s Refugio
Militia in the Battle of Coleto on March 20, 1836. Fraser’s company was one of the
military units that fought with Fannin at Coleto and were captured and massacred at
Goliad on March 27. Huson (1953) claims that Byrne was one of several men of Fraser’s
company saved from the massacre by Captain Carlos de la Garza.
In 1838, Byrne, George Armstrong, and George Hull bought one league of land
issued to Isaac E. Robertson previously that same year. In the document of sale,
Robertson mentions that, “… James W. Byrne and George Armstrong not having resided
in the Republic of Texas a sufficient length of time to entitle them to the right of
citizenship…” (Robertson to Byrne, Hull, and Armstrong, TSLA). This indicates that
40

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

Byrne had been a resident of Texas for less than six months, which seems inconsistent
with his fighting in the Texas Revolution. According to Texas law at the time, a person
had to be a resident of Texas for at least six months before he or she could be considered
a citizen.
By 1839, Byrne appears on shipping accounts in the district of Aransas
(Accounts, Returns, Abstracts, Jan–Sept 1839, District of Aransas, TSA). One source,
based on the recollections of a man who had, as a child, known Byrne, explained that he
“…owned extensive wharves and commodious warehouses, and owned and operated a
large saltworks. The wharves, warehouses, and saltworks were destroyed by the Federal
Navy during the Civil War” (Huson 1994).
Byrne is also listed as an occupant of Refugio County, Texas in the 1846 tax list
(Texas Tax List Index 1840-1849), and he appears on the 1850 Refugio County census
record, although his wife is called Jane rather than Harriett on the census. Many
nineteenth-century census records contain inconsistencies and errors in spelling and other
details.
William Oden Byrne, Byrne’s son, may be the same William Byrne mentioned
several times in letters in the Mirabeau B. Lamar papers. A William Byrne was
commissioned by M. B. Lamar as notary public of Refugio County on May 29, 1839
(Gulick et al. 1968:III:5), and took the oath of office on May 7, 1840 (Gulick et al.
1968:III:391). He resigned the post in October 1840 (Gulick et al. 1968:III:463). In
February of 1840, some businessmen from Lamar endorsed William Byrne for the
position of secretary to the legation of France, claiming that this Byrne was educated in
41

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

France and was thus fluent in the French language (Gulick et al. 1968:III:342; Gulick et
al. 1968:V:411). Whether this William Byrne is the son of James W. Byrne is difficult to
determine, but no records for Refugio County mention another William Byrne living in
Lamar.
William Oden Byrne married Anne E. Hatch, possibly in Colorado County,
Texas, in 1844. The couple had one child, Anna William (Willie) Oden Byrne, who was
born in 1846 (Texas Marriage Collection 1814-1909, 1900 U.S. Federal Census). Anna
apparently lived with James and Harriett Byrne for a time after her father’s death of
unknown causes in 1849 or 1850 and was raised and educated by her grandparents
(“Statement of Federal Damage,” TSLA, ca. 1902). According to a later document
written by Anna Byrne, Harriett Byrne died in 1858. In the 1860 census for Lamar
Precinct, Refugio County, Texas, Anna was listed as living with her cousin, Jane P.
O’Connor, in Lamar. In the same census, J.W. Byrne is listed as a retired male, 68 years
of age. Byrne signed his last will and testament on August 16, 1862. In the will he
names his niece Jane P. O’Connor of Lamar and his daughter-in-law Mrs. Ann E. Byrne
of Ingleside as his executors (Last Will and Testament of James W. Byrne). Byrne died
in September 1862.
Byrne’s granddaughter and primary beneficiary (through her mother Ann E.
Byrne), Anna Willie Byrne, married Samuel C. Vineyard sometime between 1862 and
1870, and they had a three-year-old son as well as a baby listed on the 1870 census for
Refugio County. By 1880 they were both school teachers living in Austin, Texas with
their three children (1880 United States Federal Census).
42

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

In 1902, Anna Byrne Vineyard wrote two documents in support of a petition for
restitution from the U.S. government. Vineyard testifies that her inheritance from her
grandfather included certain town improvements that were destroyed by Federal forces
during the Civil War. She argues that Byrne was a non-combatant in the war, and that as
his heir she should be repaid for the damages to her inheritance caused by the military.
As an attachment to that letter, Vineyard includes a document she titles “Why Captain
James W. Byrne Destroyed His Papers,” in which she explains her lack of documentation
for any of her claims. According to her writing, Byrne requested of his executors that all
his personal papers be burned after his death:
Then a wild delirium of fever set in and his whole thought centered on burning all
his papers and letters to blot out the wretched memory of the fruitless labor of
years; and also to save them from the raids of the Federal Marines at Aransas
Pass! So under his instructions some ten or twelve barrels of business papers,
patents, field notes, contracts and letters were burned by two unreasoning women
who did not reflect what serious loss their folly entailed! [Why Capt. James W.
Byrne destroyed his papers, TSLA, ca. 1902]
Vineyard was a teenager at the time of the Civil War and her grandfather’s death, and her
comments in the documents provide interesting information about Byrne’s business
dealings and property. Some of her information is inaccurate, however. Specifically,
Vineyard states that Byrne owned no slaves, but other documentation demonstrates that
he owned at least two in both 1850 and 1860 (Refugio County Slave Schedules).
Lamar, Texas and Refugio County
Refugio County, until 1871, included all of Copano Bay as well as surrounding
lands (Huson 1953). The county seat was based at the town of Refugio, which grew up
around the mission established there by the Spanish in 1789 (Tennis 2002). The land was
43

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

seen early on as being fertile, and Refugio County was advertised as a good place to grow
crops and raise livestock. In an 1841 publication, William Kennedy (1925:164) wrote:
The whole of the back country affords a magnificent range for cattle. The land
upon Aransaso [sic] Bay and its tributaries is equal to any in the country for the
production of cotton and sugar….Aransas Bay abounds in turtle and every variety
of fish found in the Gulf of Mexico; the islands of the bay and the neighboring
prairies are the winter resorts of multitudes of wild fowl. Droves of wild horses
and herds of deer browze [sic] upon the prairies, and the forests are stocked with
the wild turkey and a species of grouse.
In September 1838, Isaac E. Robertson sold to Byrne, Hull and Armstrong all his
land holdings on the Lamar Peninsula for the sum of approximately $15,000 payable over
three years (Robertson to Byrne, Hull, and Armstrong All His Land on Look Out Point
and within Ten Miles of Look Out Point, GLO, Austin). It was on a portion of this land
that Lamar was founded.
The Copano Bay, Refugio County area was on the frontier of the new Republic of
Texas. Letters from Refugio County residents to Mirabeau B. Lamar, at the time VicePresident of Texas, indicate a constant threat from Indians, Mexicans, and bandits. Live
Oak Point, across Copano Bay from Lamar and now the site of part of the town of Fulton,
was a small town in 1838. In March, a W. Roberts wrote to General Mirabeau Lamar and
reported that:
…a party of robers [sic] of some description have visited the Copano house in
which was stored a large quantity of tobacco & have carried off nearly all of it,
& wantonly wasted & scattered the balance, riping [sic] open the bales &
strowing the tobacco all around the house as if with design to waste &
spoil…Copano house stands alone on the opposite side of the bay 7 or 8 miles
n.w. of Live oak point & no person lives in the neighborhood of it. It is the
point of landing upon the man [sic] land from the peninsula & where all persons
going from this place into the adjacent country must necessarily pass unless they
should prefer three days ride around by the isthmus This part of the country is in
a defenceless & very exposed condition… [Gulick et al. 1968:II:42]
44

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

In July, Roberts wrote to General Lamar again, describing the pleasantness of the place
and the abundance of fish, turtle, and oysters. He tells of the arrival of ships carrying
people and building materials. Roberts does mention however, that “…the only
annoyance we have is the dread of an incursion of Mexicans or Camanche [sic] Indians”
(Gulick et al. 1968:II:183).
In May of 1839, Samuel Hewes wrote to General Lamar from the City of Aransas
about an attack on Mexican travelers by a band of “Lapan [sic] Indians” (Gulick et al.
1968:II:585). He urges Lamar to send troops, stating, “[m]any families are desirous to
leave the Rio Grande and settle in this western Country, but are prevented through fear of
Indian hostilities” (Gulick et al. 1968:II:585).
The town of Lamar became a rival of the City of Aransas, when the custom house
was moved from Aransas City to Lamar. Hewes, who was appointed customs collector
for the area, wrote again to General Lamar from the City of Aransas on May 1, 1839,
recommending the removal of the custom house to Lamar (Gulick et al. 1968:II:555).
Hewes states that, “…from its Geographical position I am fully satisfied that the upper
Country as well as the Rio Grande trade must centre at that point.---the proprietors
Messers Byrne, Hull, and Armstrong are liberal, enterprising, Gentlemanly and men of
sterling worth…” (Gulick et al. 1968:II:555). He also mentions that there were only 12
houses and 30 inhabitants in Aransas, while there were 20 houses under construction and
more than 60 inhabitants in Lamar (Gulick et al. 1968:II:555). James W. Byrne delivered
this letter to General Lamar in Houston. On June 15, 1839, the citizens of Aransas City,
including the empresario Colonel James Power, wrote a letter to General Lamar
45

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

expressing their desire for the custom house to be returned to Aransas. The citizens
argued that the town of Lamar did not provide sufficient protection to vessels during bad
weather and that the waters around Lamar were too shallow for boats drawing seven feet
of water (Gulick et al. 1968:III:21-23). Furthermore, the Aransas City citizens stated that
their town seemed to be “…destined by a natural train of events up to this time to become
at no distant period the great commercial Emporium of western Texas…” and that Lamar
“…was never intended by Nature nor can it be made by art without the Expenditure of
millions of dollars a town of any importance” (Gulick et al. 1968:III:23).
The City of Aransas was gratified by the return of the custom house to that town.
In January 1840, Hewes again writes to General Lamar, complaining that as custom
collector at Lamar he did not earn enough money to support himself and that, as the
custom house would be permanently moved to Aransas, he would not be able to travel to
the custom house every day; he thus requests reassignment elsewhere (Gulick et al.
1968:V:398).
Other writers mention Aransas in complimentary tones as well. In an 1840 text,
Francis Moore, Jr. (1965:108) remarks on the town of Aransas, which he says,
“…promises to become the site of a new city, which will rival the first cities of the
republic in commercial resources. The harbour at this place is excellent. Vessels
drawing eight feet water may approach within sixty yards of the shore at all seasons”. In
1841, William Kennedy (1925:787) wrote of Aransas City, “[t]he town is already one of
much note, and has received a large share of public attention. It is very eligibly located,

46

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

and has much trade with Mexico.” Of Lamar, Kennedy (1925) wrote only that it was a
new town on Aransas Bay.
Another town of some importance by 1840 was Copano, on the north-east side of
Copano Bay. One writer in 1840 mentioned that, “…Copano is located on the east bank
of Aransaso [sic] Bay, and being conveniently situated for the prosecution of a lucrative
trade with the interior of Mexico, is rapidity [sic] increasing in population and wealth”
(Stiff 1968).
In February 1851 Byrne, Pryor Lea, William G. Hale, and others formed the
Treport City Company, officially changing the name of Lamar to Treport for a short time.
Byrne was unanimously elected President of the Treport City Company and was given
the authority to negotiate the purchase of additional land to add to that already laid out for
the town (“Treport City Company,” WGH Papers: Letters and Legal Papers 1851-1857,
CAH, UTA). The Company created provisions wherein the town would be laid out and
organized, and infrastructure including a warehouse, a wharf, and a pier would be
supplied. The costs of all these improvements were to be divided equally among the
members of the Treport City Company.
In May and June 1851, Andrew Morse, apparently an agent for Allen and Hale
who operated out of Galveston, wrote to his employers from Treport with news of the
business of the Treport City Company. In these letters, Morse indicates that Pryor Lea
and Byrne were at odds over building plans for the wharf and other infrastructure, and
that Lea was deeply in debt to Byrne and others. In the June letter, Byrne and his wife

47

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

sent their suspicions of Lea to Allen and Hale via Morse, who was a guest in the Byrne
home (WGH Papers: Letters and Legal Papers 1851–1852, CAH, UTA).
In February 1852, Byrne and a number of other investors created the Aransas
Road Company. The company was to build a road from Aransas Bay to the town of
Goliad, with branches “in such directions and to such distances as the company may
think proper,” and with the provision that portions of railroad could be built to
supplement sections of the road (Gammell’s Laws [GL]: Chapter 171). That same
month, Byrne and others created the Texas Western Railroad Company, which was to
construct a railroad from Aransas or Corpus Christi Bay to the Rio Grande (GL:192). In
general, Byrne and his peers were busy trying to build Lamar and the Aransas Bay area
as a center of transportation and shipping.
According to J. De Cordova (1969), as of January 25, 1858, Refugio County had
post offices in Lamar, Copano, Aransas, Crescent Village, and St. Mary’s. The town of
Refugio was even host to a Masonic Lodge. At the time, steamships ran regularly from
New Orleans to Galveston and Indianola (De Cordova 1969).
Sometime between 1850 and 1860, a number of Byrne’s relatives moved to
Refugio County from Cincinnati. The 1850 Cincinnati, Ohio Federal Census lists Sarah
Gregory (Byrne’s sister), her husband Henry, and their children Henry, Eliza, Martha,
Jane, Henrietta, and Sarah. In 1860, the Refugio County, Lamar Precinct census lists
S.E. Gregory (Sarah, age 55) and her daughters Henrietta (age 19) and Caroline (age 17).
Caroline of the 1860 census is listed as Sarah in 1850, but her full name was Sarah
Caroline. The ages of many of the family members are inconsistent between the two
48

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

censuses, likely due to imprecise record-keeping. Byrne’s niece Jane O’Connor (age 22)
is listed as a teacher, living with her son John H. (age 6) and her cousin Ann Willie Byrne
(age 15). O’Connor was Sarah Gregory’s daughter, and she must have married and
moved to Texas sometime between 1850 and 1854.

O’Connor’s husband, Patrick T.

O’Connor, was born January 1, 1822, and died August 10, 1854. Patrick O’Connor is the
only member of Byrne’s close family who is buried in a marked grave in the Lamar,
Texas cemetery (Figure 11).
The total population of Refugio County increased dramatically between 1850 and
1880 (the time frame during which the first three U.S. Censuses were taken in Texas). In
1850, the total recorded population of Refugio County was 288, in 1860 it was 1600, and
in 1870 it was 2324 (U.S. Census, Refugio County, Texas, 1850, 1860, 1870).

The Salt Works on St. Charles Bay
Very few documents were found that relate directly to Byrne’s salt works. Many
of the papers were probably burned with his other documents after Byrne’s death. Most
of the records about Byrne’s life or the salt works are in the form of legal documents and
letters written by Byrne to other people. The documents that exist reveal some
information, however. The land on which the salt works site is located appears on a
survey conducted for Byrne of 256 ½ acres in Refugio County, to which Byrne was
entitled by headright certificate number 482 issued to W. G. Martin in October 1845.
The headright certificate was issued for the standard 640 acres to Martin, but after buying
it, Byrne split up the certificate into two parcels. In addition to the 256 ½ acres on St.
Charles Bay, Byrne had a survey done for 383 ½ acres elsewhere on the Lamar
Peninsula. This parcel is unrelated to the salt works and is only one among the numerous
land holdings Byrne controlled. Byrne bought the headright certificate for $100 from
Ebenezer Allen on September 25, 1850. Allen had bought the certificate from John H.
Brown in July 1850, and John Brown had bought it from William G. Martin, to whom it
was originally issued, in October 1845 (TGLO). In May 1851, James Byrne wrote a
letter to his business associate William G. Hale in which he discusses the land that
probably became the site of the salt works. In his letter, Byrne writes:
I have ascertained, that in the survey made by Mr. Richardson of the Robertson
League, there was left out—not included in the survey—two large salt flats, or
tracts of marsh land, fronting on the St. Charles Bay, which would amount to
some 700 or 800 acres; and although not valuable now, may in the course of time
become of considerable importance. I therefore think it advisable to locate these
forthwith, and for that purpose shall use a piece of scrip of 640 acres, handed me
at Lavaca by Col. Allen, and which now remains in Surveyor’s office… [WGH
Papers: Letters and Legal Papers 1851-1857, CAH, UTA]
50

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

In 1861 Byrne and his associates Ebenezer Allen and William G. Hale sold to
Samuel Colt of Hartford, Connecticut about 14,000 acres on the Lamar Peninsula; almost
the entire peninsula was included except certain lots already sold to other individuals,
“…and also reserving certain concrete vats heretofore made by said Byrne, for the
purpose of making salt, and which are his private property” (WGH Papers: Letters and
Legal Papers 1861-1885, CAH, UTA). Colt apparently defaulted on the purchase, and
the lands returned to their previous owners, Byrne, Allen, and Hale. By this date Byrne
had died, and the lands passed to his heirs (“Statement of Federal Damages, Lamar Town
Tract” A.W.O. Byrne 1902, TSLA).
The final document found that mentions the salt works specifically is Byrne’s
will, in which he states:
To Mrs. Jane P. O’Connor of Lamar, I bequeath all improvements, salt making
apparatus and ten acres of land on which the said improvements and apparatus are
situated, under the condition that the said Jane P. O’Connor will pay One
Hundred ($100) Dollars to the Rev. J. Quirat to be applied according to the
direction I have given him, said sum to be paid as soon as any of the salt will be
sold. [Last Will and Testament of James W. Byrne]
No records indicating what Jane O’Connor did with the salt works or verifying
that Rev. Quirat received his $100 were found during the course of this research.
However in 1873, S.C. Vineyard, Ann Willie Vineyard’s husband, made testimony about
the piece of land on which the salt works was located (although he does not mention the
salt works). Vineyard’s statement indicates that his wife had inherited the land, but that
on examination based on the field notes on file in the general land office he “found there
was no space” (S.C. Vineyard, Oath in Relation to Certificate No. 482, Filed April 9,
1873, GLO, Austin). Apparently the marshy land that Byrne had seen as promising held
51

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

no value for his heirs, and at this point it was absorbed into the adjoining land holding,
the William Lewis League. A 1929 court case reinforced this change. In the case,
George E. Shelley of Travis County petitioned to “…purchase, if unsurveyed public
domain, land covered by field notes of abandoned Wm. G. Martin survey in Aransas Co.
No. 482 lying between Wm. Lewis League No. 254 and St. Charles Bay and containing
approximately 250 acres of land” (Refugio County 2-27 file, GLO, Austin, District Court
Minutes #1854). The court found that:
…said premises are covered by the field notes and patent of the William Lewis
survey No. 254,…or, if same were not covered by said field notes, then, at the
time of the survey of said Lewis League, the area covered by said field
notes…were covered by the waters of St. Charles Bay; and, if same is not the
condition of said area at this time, then said area constitutes an accretion to the
shoreline of said Wm. Lewis survey and has become a part thereof.
[Refugio County 2-27 file, GLO, Austin, District Court Minutes #1854]
The Union Blockade, Lamar, and the Salt Works
The Texas coast was a primary focus of Lincoln’s coastal blockade during the
Civil War, and the portion of the coast near Lamar lost much of its shipping business
during this time. The blockade was not completely successful in keeping shipments of
cotton from leaving Texas or goods from being brought in, but it disrupted commerce and
life in the region. Aransas Pass was closely guarded by Acting Lieutenant Kittredge on
the bark Arthur, beginning in February 1862. According to a report by Major C. G.
Forshey, a Confederate Army Engineer of Coast Defenses, the Union troops went ashore
at Aransas in early February, 1862, and “assumed many liberties, took beef and mutton at
their pleasure, burned several houses, shelled the neighboring islands and sand hills in the
moorings… and made themselves at home there” (U.S. Government Printing Office
52

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

[USGPO] 1883:482). Another report, by Major Dan D. Shea, of the Confederate Army
in February of 1862, mentions a meeting with a Union captain near Aransas. Major Shea
reports that “[i]f this man is not stopped immediately, before he can capture the small
boats now in the lower bays and salt-works, he will command the whole western coast”
(USGPO 883:485–86). The Union forces in Aransas Bay were clearly disrupting life and
commerce. On February 22, 1862, Capt. B.F. Neal at Camp Aransas wrote that “the
enemy is becoming quite bold and daring, and will destroy the commerce of these bays
unless checked in their buccaneering” (USGPO 1883:526). In July of 1862, Captain
Kittredge commanded a heavily-armed schooner that captured a vessel loaded with
cotton at Lamar (USGPO 1883:725). In August of 1862, Kittredge commanded the
bombardment of Corpus Christi by the U.S.S. Sachem, Reindeer, Belle Italia, and the
yacht Corypheus. On September 14, Kittredge was captured while ashore near Corpus
Christi (USGPO 1883:624). A number of other small incidents are reported in letters
appearing in the War of the Rebellion series, but none specifically mention the salt works
on St. Charles Bay. Despite the absence of specific references, it may be inferred from
the documentary evidence that, if the salt works was still in operation, it would have been
an attractive target for Union attacks. There are abundant references to small excursions
by Union troops into the areas between Corpus Christi and Indianola, and there are
specific references to activities at Lamar by both Union troops and Confederate forces.
On February 11, 1864, Captain Edward Upton of the Lamar Home Guard reported the
landing of 75 Union troops. The troops destroyed a large warehouse and plundered the
contents of it, then “[t]he men were turned loose, as it seems, for indiscriminate plunder.
53

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

They entered almost all of the houses and took whatever they desired, defenseless
families suffering the most” (USGPO 1891:135–136). In 1902 Byrne’s granddaughter
(and heiress), Anna Vineyard, wrote to the Federal government asking for restitution for
damages caused by troops during the Civil War to the property she inherited from Byrne.
Vineyard claims that:
Some two months after Capt. James W. Byrne’s death, a company of Federal
marines, of the Aransas Pass Blockade Squadron, and at one time under command
of Capt. J. Kittredge, entered the small port of Lamar, that was not garrisoned, nor
occupied, at any time, by any squad, or company of Confederate soldiers! The
Federal marines, in their unrestricted raids, tore down all the newly built town
improvements made by Capt. James W. Byrne… [“Statement of Federal
Damages, Lamar Town Tract” by Anna Wm. Odin Vineyard, Texas State
Archives, Austin, Texas]
Vineyard lists the destruction of a warehouse, a wharf, a large steam barge built to carry
cattle, cattle pens, machine shops, pile drivers, elevators, and “many other articles of
town property.” Vineyard then asks for restitution in the amount of $250,000, as she
says, “to cover principal, and interest, on the actual loss of $75,000 or $80,000.”
Although there are no specific references to this attack on Lamar in 1862 in the U.S.
military records, the Federal government most certainly had a presence in the Aransas
Bay area and may have invaded the town at this time. Alternately, Vineyard may be
referring to the attack on Lamar in 1864. Since almost forty years had passed between
the Civil War and the writing of the document, Vineyard may have mistaken the date.
See the timeline (Table 1) for a summary of the historical background for this research.

CHAPTER IV
RESULTS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH
Description of Field Work
Field work accomplished in the course of this project included pedestrian survey,
shovel testing, and excavation. The pedestrian survey completed in December 2005
covered an area of approximately 170,000 square meters. Pedestrian survey revealed two
previously-unknown historic features, Feature 3 and Feature 4, which were later
investigated through limited excavation. Shovel testing did not reveal any new features,
but it helped to delineate site boundaries and provided a better understanding of the soils
and terrain. Results of the shovel tests associated with each feature will be discussed
with the results of excavations below. For a detailed overview of the shovel tests, see
Appendix A.
Results of Excavation
Area A
Area A comprises two discrete features, Feature 1 and Feature 2, which appear to
represent a small shellcrete foundation and a large shellcrete platform, respectively. This
area was recognized by the landowners as archaeologically significant and provided the
impetus for this investigation. Features 1 and 2 are separated by a swath of vegetation
during the winter and by a marsh during the summer (Figure 12).

Feature 1
The visible portion of Feature 1 is a border of shellcrete, roughly rectangular in
shape, that measures approximately 5 by 2.5 meters (Figure 13). The long axis of the
feature lies at an angle approximately 110 degrees east of north and runs toward St.
Charles Bay, which is roughly 80 meters east of the feature at low tide (Figure 12).
Two 1-x-1-meter excavation units (2005-1 and 2005-2) were placed on the edges of the
shellcrete outline in an attempt to define the purpose and construction of the feature
(Figure 14).

Unit 2005-1 was excavated to a depth of 40 centimeters below the surface
(elevations from 9.68 to 9.28 meters). The water table was reached at approximately 35
centimeters below the surface, but excavations continued in to fully delineate the
stratigraphy of the feature. This unit did not yield any artifacts.
Unit 2005-2 was excavated to thirty centimeters below the surface (elevations
from 9.66 to 9.36 meters) to the level of the water table. One iron fastener covered in
shellcrete and one lithic flake were recovered, both from the upper 10 centimeters of unit
2005-2 (Figure 15) (see Table 2, below).
One shovel test placed near Feature 1 (ST 2) yielded a single shell fragment that
appears to be drilled with two holes of almost identical size (Figure 16). The fragment
may be part of a pendant from a prehistoric occupation, or the holes may be the result of
parasitic snail activity. No other artifacts were found in the shovel test.

The overlying soil in the area of Feature 1 is a mixture of sand and dense, sandy
clay and ranges in color from very dark gray to light brown. The stratigraphy of the
feature was distinctive, as shown below in Figure 17. Six strata were identified (Figure
60

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

17). The top of the feature was covered with the dense sandy clay typical of the soil in
that area. Below that lay a mixture of shellcrete and shellcrete components such as brick
and shell. The next stratum was a thick deposit of lime or very degraded plaster and shell
hash. Below that was a substantial lens of charcoal and burned wood. The surface below
the burned lens was a hard clay overlying sand.

Figure 17: North wall profile of unit 2005-2, Feature 1,
demonstrating stratigraphy; dashed lines represent
stratigraphic divisions.

This small rectangular feature may represent the remains of a foundation for
either a pump or an elevated cistern where salt water was held after it was pumped out of
the Feature 2 platform (discussed below) and before it was piped elsewhere. The
stratigraphy at Feature 1 may be the result of widespread vegetation burning immediately
prior to the laying of the shell for the foundation. In this case, the burned vegetation
under the foundation was preserved in place by the overlying shellcrete, while
surrounding areas were eventually washed clean of the burned remains. Alternately, the

61

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

burned stratum may represent the remains of a wooden base or platform that burned at
some time and was replaced by a platform of shellcrete.
Feature 2
Feature 2 lies approximately 30 meters to the east of Feature 1 (Figure 12).
During the summer, when the average water level of St. Charles Bay is at its highest,
Feature 2 is surrounded by marsh. In the cooler months, when the water level is lower,
the edge of the marsh is approximately 10 meters to the east of the edge of Feature 2.
The visible portion of the feature is a large rectangular surface that is only sparsely
vegetated (Figure 18). A slightly raised border of shellcrete marks one edge of what at
first glance appears to be the entire structure (Figure 19).

Figure 19: Visible shellcrete border between
eastern and western platforms at Feature 2
(photo by D. Rose).

Investigations to the east side of this surface revealed a second platform that abuts
the visible portion of the feature (Figure 20). The western platform measures
approximately 17 meters long by 7 meters wide. The eastern platform is also
approximately 17 meters long, with an width of approximately 10 meters. The elevations
recorded for the two platforms indicate that the western platform surface is approximately
15 centimeters lower than the eastern platform. Several shovel tests and three 1-x-1meter excavation units (2005-3, 2005-4, 2005-5) were used to delineate the extent of the
platforms and investigate the platform construction. Two narrow trenches were also hand
excavated roughly northwest-to-southeast across the surface of the eastern platform to
expose surface features. These trenches were each approximately 30 centimeters wide
and 5 to 10 centimeters deep (Figure 20). Because the surface of the platform was
covered with a thin layer of overburden, only a few centimeters of soil had to be removed

63

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

in these trenches. Although the soil was screened through ¼ inch mesh, as was all the
excavated soil, no artifacts were recovered from these trench excavations.

The surface of the platform seems to have been finely plastered with shellcrete,
some of which has eroded, and at least two partitions apparently ran parallel to the raised
shellcrete border dividing the two platforms, one to the east and one to the west (Figure
20). The footings of these partitions were revealed in the narrow trenches excavated
across the platform surface. The dimensions of the two platforms combined is
approximately 17 meters square (or almost 55 feet on each side). The edge of this eastern

64

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

platform nearest to the bay has eroded away leaving an irregular edge, and no evidence of
a wall or enclosure on the bay side of the structure was found. Around the edges of the
western platform, the remains of shellcrete wall footings, approximately 30 centimeters
wide, were observed. These wall footings were distinguished by their rough surface and
regular outline, and they indicate the presence of a wall or enclosure on the land side of
the structure (Figure 21).

N

Three 1-x-1-meter units were excavated within Feature 2 (Units 2005-3, 2005-4,
and 2005-5) (Figure 20). Unit 2005-3 was placed on the western platform and was
excavated from 9.67 to 9.28 meters (Figure 20). The surface of the platform was reached
at 9.45 meters. The northwest corner of the unit (25 x 25 centimeters) was further
excavated through the shellcrete platform, which appears to be approximately 8
centimeters thick. No artifacts were recovered from this unit.
Unit 2005-4 was placed on the northern end of the eastern shellcrete platform and
was excavated to 51 centimeters below the surface, from 9.81 to 9.30 meters (Figure 20).
65

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

Level 1 (9.81–9.70 m) from this unit yielded 20 small indeterminate iron fragments,
while the underlying level contained no artifacts. Two nail fragments, one indeterminate
iron object, and one small vertebra (from an unidentified small mammal) were found in
Level 3 (9.60–9.50 m) of unit 2005-4 (Figure 22). Due to time constraints, only the
southern half of this unit was excavated through Level 4 (9.50–9.40 m), and only the
southwest corner of the unit was continued through Level 5 (9.40–9.30 m). These partial
excavations provided a view of the stratigraphy of the unit, and no artifacts were found in
these levels. See Table 3 for detailed excavation information.

Unit 2005-5 was placed approximately 10 meters north of the northern edge of the
eastern shellcrete platform (see Figure 20). This unit was excavated from 9.82 to 9.52
meters and yielded no artifacts. Due to time constraints, Levels 2 through 4 (9.77–9.52
meters) included only the southern half of the unit, which was characterized by moist
sandy clay. The soil on and around the platforms is highly saline and not conducive to
the preservation of perishable materials. Remains of lightweight materials were likely
washed away by years of tides and storms. Thus, it is difficult to discern what structural
elements other than the shellcrete platforms were originally present. These shellcrete
platforms appear to have been solar evaporation vats, where salt water was exposed to
sun and wind in order to concentrate the brine.

A marshy inlet and dense vegetation separate Area A from Area B. Area B
covers a piece of land of approximately 70 x 50 meters and includes Features 3 and 4,

Feature 3
Feature 3 is one of the two historic features discovered during site survey. The
eastern portion of the feature was visible due to the activities of wild pigs in the area,
which had disturbed the overlying soil. Excavations revealed additional minor
disturbance. A total of 14 units was excavated within Feature 3, totaling 17.5 square
meters of surface area (Figure 24).

Although the entire feature was not excavated, an attempt was made to delineate
the structure to determine its function and appearance. No artifacts associated with this
feature were found in situ. This was due to the dark color of the metal artifacts, which
made it difficult to distinguish them from the dark color of the surrounding soil (see
Tables 4 through 17 for excavation information for each unit).

69

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

Feature 3 represents the remains of a circular structure approximately five meters
in diameter. A double wall of shellcrete blocks defines this architectural element, with
the most complete blocks measuring approximately 70 centimeters long, 30 centimeters
wide, and 30 centimeters thick (Figure 25). Excavations in the interior of the structure
revealed, in place, finely-plastered shellcrete blocks that appear to have been
intentionally aligned (Figure 26). Found in association with the feature were many small,
thin fragments of metal, averaging approximately 2.3 millimeters in thickness (Figure
27). These metal fragments may represent the remains of a kettle or pan used for boiling
brine to yield salt. The metal fragments are relatively well preserved, since the soil
around Feature 3 is not highly saline like that around Features 1 and 2. In and around the
structure, fragments of a sandy plaster-like substance, smoothed on one side and covered
with what appears to be a waterproofing material like pitch or tar, were found (Figures 28
and 29). The underside of some of this material retained traces of shellcrete, while
remnants of shellcrete and shell hash were also visible on the ground surface. The sandy
plaster-like material appears to have been intentionally spread over a thin layer of shell
hash and then coated for waterproofing.
This circular alignment of shellcrete blocks is likely what remains of a furnace on
which a metal kettle or pan of brine was boiled in order to cause the salt to crystallize out
of the solution. Such boiling furnaces were common features at inland salt works from
the same time period (Skinner 1971, Updike 2001). The flat metal fragments are likely
remnants of the boiling vessel, and the plaster-like material probably formed a pavement
around the structure.

unidentifiable species) was recovered from Shovel Test 19 (Figure 32). The relationships
of these items to the historic-period feature are unknown.

Figure 33: Feature 4 as seen on surface.

In two of the units (2005-6 and 2005-10), metal objects were recovered between
the elevations 12.95 meters and 12.85 meters. Two shovel tests in this area each yielded
one small flat fragment of iron, and one other shovel test yielded three square cut nail
fragments. Unit 2005-6 yielded three square cut nail fragments, and unit 2005-10 yielded
two large and fourteen small flat fragments of iron, and one small amorphous lump of
metal (Figures 35 and 36). Both units were characterized by dense concentrations of
broken shell (shell hash) between approximately 12.95 meters and 12.75 meters, overlain
with loose concentrations of broken shell. The third unit, 2006-1, also yielded loose shell
but appears to have been placed outside the main feature area (see Tables 18 through 20
for detailed excavation information).

Feature 4 appears to be the remains of the foundation for a structure of unknown
purpose. The archaeological remains provide little evidence for the feature’s original
purpose, but a functional relationship is likely between this feature and Feature 3, the
circular shellcrete structure. The relatively large number of metal fasteners found in
association with this feature (Figure 36) suggests that the foundation supported a wooden
structure of some type. As the excavations at Boone’s Lick emphasize, many of the
components that made up a salt works were composed of wood (Bray 1987). The Feature
4 foundation might have supported a storage structure for drying and keeping salt or,
more likely, a cistern where salt water was held before it was boiled at Feature 3.
Overall, Site 41AS95 yielded relatively few artifacts, and no artifacts of a
personal nature, such as buttons, ceramics, or pipe fragments, were recovered. This lack
of artifacts is likely the result of a combination of site scavenging and storm clearing.
After the salt works was abandoned, local people probably removed any usable
equipment and any other objects of value. The materials that were left in place probably
were washed out into the bay over time by periodic storms and floods. The area in which
the most artifacts were found, Feature 3, is relatively protected by its location, which
likely accounts for the number of metal fragments recovered there.

CHAPTER V
INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS
Interpretation
Both historical information (Huson 1953; LeConte 1862; Lonn 1965) and
archaeological data from other historic-period salt works (Bray 1987; Fielding 2005; Fox
1983; Skinner 1971; Updike 2001) were used to interpret the features and artifacts found
at the St. Charles Bay salt works. No single site provides a perfect analogy that can
explain all components of the Lamar site, but James W. Byrne’s salt works contains
features similar to those found at a number of different known salt works (Bray 1987,
Fielding 2005, Fox 1983, Skinner 1971, Updike 2001). No historical documents were
located that provide details or descriptions of the salt works at Lamar. However, a
synthesis of the archaeological remains at the site, coupled with the few references to the
St. Charles Bay salt works in historical documents and information from known salt
works elsewhere, are used to speculatively reconstruct the site of 41AS95.
Based on the available historical and archaeological evidence, a reconstruction of
how the St. Charles Bay salt works operated is proposed. Feature 2 probably represents a
set of platforms for solar evaporation. Saline bay water would have been pumped into
the easternmost chamber of the large, partitioned platform area (Feature 2). There,
sediments began to settle out, and some of the water evaporated. After some time, the
brine was allowed to pass into the second chamber, where further evaporation occurred.
The movement of water between chambers was probably accomplished through the use
of either small floodgates or pumps. The platform surfaces both slope slightly inland,
84

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

and the western platform drops approximately 15 centimeters from the eastern surface,
which would have facilitated the movement of water. This process was repeated until the
water was released onto the westernmost platform for further evaporation. The surface of
this platform was likely divided into a number of smaller chambers with low retaining
walls of shellcrete. This follows the pattern seen at many other historic salt works that
operated based on solar evaporation (Figure 37). Due to time constraints, the surface of
the platform was not investigated adequately to determine whether or not such walls were
present. The large surface area of this platform allowed for maximum exposure of the
water to the sun and wind, thus expediting the evaporation process. See Figure 38 for an
artist’s reconstruction of Area A, including Features 1 and 2.

separating the pools of brine.

Solar evaporation is the simplest method for producing salt from saline water. No
fuel is needed, and labor requirements are minimal (Updike 2001). Salt production by
solar evaporation involves the capturing of seawater on platforms or in shallow lagoons,
and it is a method that has been in use for centuries and across the globe (Lonn 1965). As
Fielding (2005:11) explains, “[a]s the seawater becomes more concentrated it is directed
through a series of smaller solar evaporation basins only a few centimetres deep where at
an appropriate stage, salt crystallises and is raked into heaps for drying while the bitter
tasting salts drain off.” This method of salt production is feasible in only certain
climates, high in sunlight and low in humidity. While the Texas Gulf Coast has plenty of
sunlight, it is too humid for solar evaporation alone to provide an efficient means of
making salt. Documents from the historic salt works at Velasco emphasize this point, as
Asa Mitchell needed kettles for boiling salt water (Earls et al. 1996). A combination of
solar evaporation and boiling was common in many locations where the climate is not
conducive to salt making by means of solar evaporation alone (Fielding 2005).
Pumps of some type were almost certainly used at the St. Charles Bay salt works.
Pumps were in use since at least the mid-sixteenth century, when Agricola described a
simple pump mechanism in his De Re Metallica (Bray 1987). There are few descriptions
of the types of pumps that might be in use at salt works in historic documents, however.
As Bray (1987:9) explains:
Among the various descriptions of technology involved in the manufacture of salt
in the early United States, there are frequent references to delivery of brine to
evaporative units. Thus, we read that pumps were used to raise water from wells
and into gutters, troughs, or leaders that carried brine by force of gravity to
evaporation sites. But rarely is there any elaboration on what kind of pump was
87

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

used nor just how broad one’s interpretation justifiably might be in defining the
word.
The types of pumps used at salt works and other industrial sites from the nineteenth
century was often taken for granted in contemporary written sources, so discerning these
details is difficult in present-day investigations. In conjunction with pipes, pumps may
have delivered water from St. Charles Bay to the solar evaporation platforms and also
from the platforms to other portions of the site. A wind-driven pump may have pumped
water from the bay onto the platforms. Such wind pumps were common at salt works, as
shown in Figures 39 and 40. Alternately, bay water could have washed onto the Feature
2 platform during high tide. This scenario is unlikely, however, because it would have
limited control over the process of procuring salt water for evaporation. More likely, the
entire platform area was enclosed in low shellcrete walls that prevented the marsh water
from washing onto the platforms and diluting the increasingly-saline brine being
processed. The remains of the footings for portions of these walls were found
archaeologically. If walls were present on the side closest to the bay, however, they have
since eroded away. Pumping water from some distance out in the bay would also help to
reduce the amount of sediments introduced onto the platforms. Water procured from the
marsh immediately next to the solar evaporation structure would contain a relatively large
proportion of sediments in the forms of vegetation, soil, and other impurities. Byrne
likely constructed a wooden walkway out into the bay to support a wind pump that could
pull relatively clean water from further off shore. In fact, a deeper pool within the marsh
Byrne owned might have provided the ideal source of relatively clean water (Figure 43).

nineteenth century (from Kurlansky 2002:284).

Figure 40: Windpump at Southwold, Suffolk, England, 1861 (from Fielding and
Fielding 2006:17).

Once the salt water being processed at Feature 2 had reached the desired salinity,
it was likely pumped through wooden pipes across the marsh to the circular structure
(Feature 3), where the remaining water was boiled until the salt began to crystallize. The
89

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

salt resulting from this process could then be gathered from the kettle or pan and allowed
to dry before being packaged. Networks of wooden pipes were frequently used at salt
works (Bray 1987; Lander 2005; Updike 2002) (Figures 41 and 42). Wooden pipes were
preferable to metal for the movement of brine, since iron is corroded by salt water while
wood is not. Hollowed out half logs provided inexpensive piping, and the open top
allowed for additional evaporation as the salt water moved slowly from one part of the
site to another. Although wooden materials rarely survive at archaeological sites, the
remains of such an aqueduct were found at Boone’s Lick, Missouri (Bray 1987). These
remains included “two 40- and 50-cm-long sections of half logs with squared ends. One
side of each log had been hollowed out forming troughs 26 cm deep and 58 cm in
diameter” (Bray 1987:32). Remains of a piping system have not been found at the St.
Charles Bay salt works, but salt water was probably moved from one part of the site to
another in this way.

Area A, dominated by the large evaporation platforms (Feature 2), and Area B,
where the circular structure (Feature 3) is located, are approximately 250 meters apart. A
carefully-planned system of pipes could have carried the saline water across this distance,
and the exposure to sun and wind during the slow journey from one area to another
provided additional opportunity for evaporation. Updike (2002) describes a pipeline in
the Kanawha Valley that may have spanned hundreds of meters. The great distance
between the two areas at the St. Charles Bay salt works may be explained by the
configuration of land on which Byrne built the salt works. By overlaying the survey map
Byrne had done for the property on an aerial photograph of the peninsula (Figure 43), it
becomes clear that there was very little dry land on which Byrne could build anything.
When comparing the modern aerial photograph to the survey map, it must be
remembered that the coastline has shifted somewhat, and exactly matching the modern
photograph to the nineteenth-century image is difficult.

A network of wooden pipes, as may have been present at the St. Charles Bay salt
works, would require a system of trestles to support the troughs at the correct elevations
to maintain the flow of water (Bray 1987). Feature 1 may represent the remains of a
foundation for a support of this type. A wooden trestle would leave behind few remains
under any but the best preservation circumstances. Alternately, the small platform at

92

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

Feature 1 may represent a foundation for a pump or for a small reservoir. Most likely,
however, the platform was related to the movement of water between the large
evaporation platforms at Feature 2 and the rest of the site.
The shell hash foundation and associated metal fragments at Feature 4 may
represent the remains of a cistern or tank for holding concentrated brine before it was
moved to the boiling structure at Feature 3. A tank of this type could provide a means of
regulating the flow of brine to the boiling feature. Alternatively, Feature 4 may be the
foundation for a storage building or other support structure needed for the production of
salt.
Feature 3, which appears to be the remains of a simple furnace for boiling salt
water, does not conform to furnace designs used at other historic salt works (Bray 1987;
Skinner 1971; Updike 2002), but it is similar enough to other furnaces that its function
can be understood. This circular feature lies approximately 10 meters southeast of
Feature 4, and the occupation levels at Feature 3 (9.90-10.20) are approximately 2.8
meters lower than those at Feature 4 (12.70-13.00), so there is a slight slope between the
two features. This slope would have allowed gravity to feed water through pipes from
Feature 4 to Feature 3. The boiling structure at Feature 3 was constructed of a circular
arrangement of shellcrete blocks set on a foundation or pavement. The pavement
extended past the circular structure, probably in order to provide dry stable footing for
laborers and a place to pile salt as it was removed from the pan. Skinner (1971) mentions
that a walkway for laborers would have been necessary at the Neches Saline as well.
Additional shellcrete blocks inside the circular structure would have both supported the
93

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

evaporation kettle or pan and acted similarly to the tile pillars in a Roman hypocaust in
which hot air circulated around and between the stacks of tiles (Figure 44).

Figure 44: Portion of Roman hypocaust system, Bath, England.

If the Feature 3 structure represents the remains of a boiling area, a fire was
probably maintained on the foundation of the structure, under the evaporation vessel.
Several large fragments of charred wood were found during excavations and provide
evidence for burning. Other burned remains have probably been washed away by the
storms and tides of the intervening 140 years. Gaps between some shellcrete blocks in
the circular alignment would allow access for laborers to build and maintain the fire and
to remove ashes and charcoal periodically. An mid-nineteenth-century publication by
John LeConte (1862:6) of South Carolina describes a salt works that operated on this
principle: “The bottom of the pan is supported by small pillars of brick-work, built from
the foundation of the furnace, so as to form, at the same time, flues for the distribution of
the heat. These flues are calculated to disseminate the flame as uniformly as possible

94

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

over the bottom of the pan…” Salt works based on boiling could be of any size and were
common throughout the United States and Western Europe (Figure 45).

Figure 45: Artist’s rendering of an early-nineteenth-century salt works near Salina,
New York. Note wooden pipeline supplying water to the boiling kettles set into a stone
framework. (Illustration by Mary Constance Enslow, from Eskew, 1948:50).

The nineteenth-century evaporation furnace at the Lion Salt Works in England
demonstrates this method of salt making on a large scale. At this salt works, the furnace
is a massive structure of brick with metal doors opening into the firebox. Firemen
worked constantly, feeding the fires with coal to maintain the temperature of the brine in
the huge evaporation pan above (Figures 46 and 47). Inside the firebox, pillars of bricks
encouraged heat circulation under the evaporation pan (Fielding, personal
communication, July 2007). At this site, heat was directed out of the firebox and into the
drying rooms, eventually escaping through a brick chimney at the end of the complex

Figure 48: Simplified schematic showing the process of salt making at the Lion Salt Works (image

Based on the available archaeological evidence, no chimney or external firebox
was present at Byrne’s salt works, although these were common features at some other
salt works such as at Neches Saline and in the Kanawha Valley (Skinner 1971; Updike
2001). At the St. Charles Bay salt works, heat probably escaped through gaps in the
supporting structure. The circular shape of the boiling structure at 41AS95 implies the
use of a circular evaporation pan or a very large salt kettle. Kettles were commonly used
for boiling salt at salt works in the early part of the nineteenth century. These vessels
were often recycled sugar or potash kettles, since containers produced specifically for salt
making were uncommon (Updike 2001). See Figure 49. The later nineteenth-century
practice of using relatively shallow iron pans allowed for greater relative surface area for
evaporation and were lighter in weight per surface area than were kettles. LeConte
(1862:6) describes a typical salt pan as a “…shallow four-sided vessel of sheet-iron, from
nine to twelve inches deep, with flat bottom, somewhat deepened towards the middle…”
Most of the documented salt pans were rectangular, but James Byrne may have had a
circular one specially made or adapted some other similar round receptacle to use as an
97

evaporation pan. Byrne’s brother, Charles, who lived in New Orleans, was a dealer in
metal goods. In the 1861 New Orleans City Directory, Charles Byrne advertised himself
as a:
Manufacturer of Copper, Sheet Iron & Tinware and dealer in Stoves, Stove-Pipe,
etc. Makes Copper Stills, complete to contain from 20 to 20,000 gallons, & any
other description of heavy or light Copper Work. Black-smithing & general
jobbing and repairing in the Metallic line, executed & attended to.
Byrne’s brother in New Orleans may have supplied metal vessels to Byrne’s
specifications for salt making. Unfortunately, no records of transactions between Byrne
and his brother were found during this research. A search for documents from Charles
Byrne’s store was also unsuccessful. See Figure 50 for an artist’s reconstruction of Area
B, including Features 3 and 4. Figure 51 illustrates the entire salt works area to
demonstrate the relationship between areas and features.

If Byrne’s salt works operated as suggested in this speculative reconstruction, it
was based on precedents well known to salt makers in the mid-nineteenth century. This
reconstruction is based on both the archaeological remains of the site and a wide range of
historical sources, and it fits into the patterns of salt making elsewhere during this time
period. LeConte (1862) describes multiple variations on making salt from sea water.
Specifically, LeConte describes a salt works based solely on solar evaporation, one at
which solar evaporation was combined with boiling, another using a graduation chamber
combined with boiling, a fourth combining leaching salt from beach sand and boiling,
and a final example based only on boiling sea water. The second method, that of
combining solar evaporation and artificial evaporation, is described in terms that parallel
elements of Byrne’s salt works on St. Charles Bay. In LeConte’s description, sea water is
concentrated in large basins before being boiled to yield salt. LeConte (1862) mentions
that furnaces, evaporation pans, and a storage building must be available if salt water is to
be boiled. Although LeConte’s (1862) full description is more complex than the system
suggested by the archaeology at the St. Charles Bay salt works, it is useful in interpreting
the site remains.
Sometime after 1935, Hobart Huson interviewed a Lamar native, Peter A.
Johnson, who recounted his memories of the Lamar area from the 1860s onward. These
notes later formed the basis of a book that provides interesting clues about how Byrne’s
salt works may have operated and about other details of life in Lamar in the midnineteenth century (Huson 1994). Johnson was only a boy during the Civil War, but he
reveals information about life in Lamar during the mid-nineteenth century. Much of
101

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

Johnson’s narrative, especially of the earlier period in Lamar, was probably based on
local stories rather than his own memories. Johnson recalls that one of his earliest
memories was from 1867, so many of the details he gives from before that time may be
inaccurate (Huson 1994). Johnson mentions that Byrne was a businessman who owned a
salt works, but he provides no details. At another point in the narrative, Johnson
discusses a large salt works on St. Charles Bay that he claims was built by the
Confederate authorities and that was abandoned because of Federal gunboat activity in
the bays (Huson 1994). According to Johnson, after the war Seth Ballou, a long-time
Lamar resident, took over that salt works and produced both salt and molasses at the site.
No archival records dealing with Ballou’s interest in a salt works, or, indeed, dealing with
any salt works on St. Charles Bay except that of Byrne, have been found. Johnson may
be confusing the salt works he claims was built by the Confederacy with Byrne’s, or there
may have been another salt works in the area that is even more poorly documented than
Byrne’s. Johnson does give some description of this salt works, but it is difficult to
determine how much of the detail is accurate and whether or not the salt works he
discusses was originally Byrne’s. According to Johnson:
The saltworks was a considerable affair. There was a mill operated by wind
power. The mill had “Johnny Armstrong arms” on the grinders. Salt was
scooped from the evaporation pits and ground by the mill, either coarse or fine, as
was desired. The saltworks was one place where employment could be had. I
often worked there as a boy, scooping salt. Sometimes I had to take my pay in
molasses. [Huson 1994:19]
Further research into the possibility of another salt works on St. Charles Bay could be
helpful in filling out the picture of life in Lamar at this time. This example illustrates the
difficulties inherent in attempting to reconstruct the history of a poorly-documented site.
102

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

Johnson also provides a few other interesting bits of information that may or may
not be reliable, considering the time lapse between the events and the recording. Johnson
claims that a man named Moses Simpson built a home at Copano sometime before 1856
and was shipping hides and tallow from there. Johnson also mentions another packing
operation at Lamar, “…in the bend of St. Charles Bay, near the ‘Big Tree.’…its operation
was kind of a community affair. The meat was salted or pickled. The tallow was packed
in barrels, and the hides tied in bundles” (Huson 1994:40). Neither of these claims has
been verified through documents, although a search was made for such records.
However, if anyone was engaged in packing meat, hides, or tallow commercially during
this time period, there certainly would have been a demand for large quantities of salt.
No archaeological remains of a packing operation have been reported in this location,
although such remains may exist. Also notable is the fact that Byrne’s salt works could
be described as being “in the bend of St. Charles Bay, near the ‘Big Tree,’” which is still
a recognized landmark.
Byrne may have moved to Texas for the promise of a new life, as did many other
immigrants. An 1840 publication sums up the attitude of promise in Texas:
Young men of good moral character and handsome acquirements, may have a
wide and uncultivated field in which to lay the foundation for future usefulness in
Texas; such perhaps as cannot be elsewhere found, and these, if possessed of
strong nerves, and qualified to perform the double duty of heroes and saints, may
have a very bright prospect of becoming in time, not only rich but eminent and
distinguished among men while living, and objects of veneration when dead.
[Stiff 1968:190]
Byrne was not a young man when he moved to Texas, and he may have seen in Texas the
opportunity to leave a lasting legacy. Documents indicate that he apparently had ongoing
103

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

financial difficulties. Virtually every documented business transaction in which Byrne
participated underscores his position as a speculator without enough means. Byrne did
leave a legacy, however; his name even appears on the “Local History” section of a
menu at a diner located near where the town of Lamar once stood (Menu, Pop’s
Restaurant, Lamar). Byrne is remembered locally for founding the town of Lamar, for
fighting in the Texas Revolution, and for building a salt works.
Conclusions
This thesis utilized a combination of historical research and archaeological
investigation to explain the nineteenth-century salt works on St. Charles Bay, Texas. The
salt works was excavated and recorded, fulfilling one of the major objectives of this
study. Beyond the documentation of the site, this thesis addressed three major research
questions: How did the salt works operate? What role did the salt works play in the town
of Lamar? What was the importance of the salt works in the overall network of
commerce in the Copano Bay area? Alone, neither the historical documents nor the
archaeological record fully answer any of these questions, but a combination of all of the
information collected provides considerable insight.
One of the primary research questions dealt with how the salt works operated. A
conjectural reconstruction of the St. Charles Bay salt works unites the four features that
were investigated archaeologically (Figure 51). The process of making salt at this site
likely began at Feature 2, the evaporation vats (Figure 38), where bay water was gathered
and concentrated. Feature 3, the circular boiling structure (Figure 50), probably
represents the final stage of the process. The highly-concentrated brine was then boiled
104

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

to yield salt. Features 1 and 4 likely represent structures that contributed to the
movement of water between Features 2 and 3. Feature 1 may be the remains of a
platform for a support structure for the wooden pipelines that were probably used to
transport brine from one part of the salt works to another. Feature 4 likely represents the
remains of a similar structure, or it may be the foundation for a cistern or tank for holding
salt water before it was transported to the boiling structure (Feature 3) for final
processing.
The second research question addressed the role that the salt works played in the
community of Lamar. Byrne clearly anticipated a need for local salt production far in
advance of the difficulties caused by the Civil War, when many local salt works arose
across the South. Throughout his life in Texas, Byrne was involved in investments and
business speculation, and he was interested in nurturing the town of Lamar. Byrne
probably built the salt works both in hopes of making a profit for himself and with the
expectation that a local salt works would strengthen Lamar, since salt would not have to
be imported from elsewhere. The cost of salt increased dramatically with distance from
the source, so producing salt locally would provide a considerable advantage for the
people of the area (Eskew 1948). While no business records have surfaced that provide
figures for salt production or income for this site, the importance placed on the salt works
in business transactions and in Byrne’s will indicate that the operation was of some
importance.
The production capacity of Byrne’s salt works is difficult to estimate accurately,
since such a figure is dependent on a number of factors. Included in this equation are the
105

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

salinity of the water, the rate of solar evaporation (based on ambient temperature, wind,
and humidity), the number of solar evaporation areas and boiling areas, and the types of
pumps used to transport the water. That being said, historical sources and the
archaeological remains do provide some insight into the possible yield of Byrne’s salt
works.
The total surface area of the Feature 1 platforms (excluding the width of the three
known partitions) is approximately 272 square meters, or almost 2,928 square feet. In his
description of a model salt works, LeConte (1862) recommends a water depth of 10 to 16
inches. If the water in the platforms was, on average, 13 inches deep, the total volume of
water on the platform area was approximately 23,727 gallons. The average salinity of sea
water is approximately 3 percent. To begin to boil brine to yield salt efficiently, the
salinity of the water should be between 20 and 25 percent (LeConte 1862; Andrew
Fielding, personal communication, July 2007). Based on the size of the Feature 3 boiling
structure, Byrne likely used a pan or kettle approximately 4.5 meters in diameter.
Assuming the vessel was a flat-bottomed pan rather than a semi-spherical kettle, at five
inches of water depth, the container would have held about 535 gallons. LeConte (1862)
recommends a flat-bottomed pan 9 to 12 inches deep, filled just over halfway with brine.
When the brine reached the correct salinity, salt crystals began to form on the surface. At
this point, the brine in the pan was kept over high heat (but not boiling) as salt crystals
grew and dropped to the bottom to be scooped out. LeConte (1862) claims that 260
bushels of salt could be produced from 10,000 gallons of brine at 20% salinity. Based on
this estimate, from the 535 gallons of brine at 20% salinity as originally fed into the
106

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

boiling pan at the St. Charles Bay salt works, approximately 14 bushels of salt could be
produced. The timeframe for this process is difficult to estimate, since the rate of solar
evaporation varied, and the time required to heat the brine to boiling would depend on
the heat of the fire. In LeConte’s (1862) instructions, the process of boiling the brine to
the point of crystallization could take from 20 to 24 hours. Following that period, it
could take several days for the salt crystals to grow and sink to the bottom of the pan
(LeConte 1862). Based on these estimations (LeConte 1862), Byrne’s salt works could
have produced as little as 14 bushels in 6 or 7 days of continuous work. If only 14 barrels
of salt was produced per week, the rate of return on the amount of time and labor
involved was relatively low.
However, if one or more factors were adjusted, the salt yield could increase
considerably. For example, if the bay water was concentrated to 30% salinity before
boiling, the yield increases to 21 bushels of salt per pan of water. The amount of salt
produced is further increased if brine is continuously added to the pan as water
evaporates, thus maintaining a constant depth of water in the pan. If this technique was
used, the process of harvesting the salt crystals is continuous rather than cyclical. Based
on this model, it would take several days to heat the brine to the point that salt begins to
sink to the bottom. Once that process began, it could continue indefinitely, with yields as
high as 21 bushels per day rather than per week, based on 30% brine salinity. The pan
requires cooling periodically for the removal of the hard crust of minerals that forms on
the bottom. This mineralization, called “blocking,” was subsequently chipped away,
because the blocking expanded and contracted at different rates than the iron pan and
107

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

could cause the pan to crack (Lonn 1965). Furthermore, a thick layer of blocking on the
bottom insulated the pan from the heat of the fire and reduced the efficiency of the
heating process (Lonn 1965). At the Lion Saltworks, the mineralization was removed
once a week (Andrew Fielding, personal communication, July 2007).
Based on the model described above, continuously boiling brine at an original
30% salinity for 6 days at a time (with a day off for cleaning the pan), potentially yields
as much as 105 bushels of salt a week. This estimate takes into account the 24 hours it
sometimes takes to boil the brine to the point that salt crystals can be harvested. A bushel
was approximately 50 pounds, so 105 bushels of salt would equal 5,250 pounds
produced weekly. An average estimate for the price of salt in 1860 is $2.50 per bushel
(Lonn 1965). Based on this price, Byrne’s saltworks was capable of producing $262.50
worth of salt in a week.
Clearly, the boiling of brine to yield salt was a process that needs maintenance 24
hours a day. Every time the pan was allowed to cool, it took hours to reheat it to boiling
temperature, so letting the pan cool between daytime shifts of laborers was inefficient.
The production of salt from bay water through the means used at Byrne’s salt
works would require a labor force of several individuals. Based on estimates of labor
forces at a number of other salt works, Byrne needed at least three people to tend to the
solar evaporation vats and at least two people to maintain the boiling of the brine.
Between these two elements, four or five laborers were probably employed to maintain
the pumps, repair pipelines, and ensure the process worked smoothly. Other laborers
were necessary for packaging the salt produced and transporting the salt to its final
108

Texas Tech University, Jennifer C. Hatchett, December 2008

destinations. Based on this model, a minimum of 12 individuals were needed to operate
the salt works. Thus, Byrne provided employment for a number of local laborers. In
addition to providing jobs, the salt works undoubtedly helped to meet dire local, and
possibly regional, need for salt that arose during the Civil War.
Finally, the role Byrne’s salt works played in the regional economy is addressed.
The St. Charles Bay salt works likely provided salt for the needs of both the town of
Lamar as well as surrounding areas. The importance of the salt works overall may be
indicated by its significance to the Union forces blockading the coast outside Lamar.
Whether or not Byrne’s salt works was attacked during the Civil War is unclear from the
documentary record. However, assuming the salt works was in operation at that time, it
undoubtedly attracted negative attention from the Union forces blockading that portion of
the coastline. The Union had a well-established habit of destroying sites of local
production of all sorts of products, especially salt. The Confederacy was so dependent on
imported salt that the coastal blockade severely limited salt availability and fueled the
development of local salt works. The Union began the blockade with the intention of
preventing the South from exporting cotton (which potentially provided income for
military activity) and importing necessary items (which would weaken popular resolve).
This being said, it is likely that any known salt works were potential targets for Union
attacks, and Byrne’s operation was in easy range of the blockading forces. The
likelihood of a Union attack on the salt works underscores the importance of the site to
the people of Lamar and of the Copano Bay community.

Small-scale coastal salt works in the United States are relatively unknown
archaeologically, and they tend to be poorly documented historically. Thus, the present
study contributes to knowledge of what is, at this time, a poorly-understood but vital
local industry from the nineteenth century. Through extensive archival research,
investigation into the history and operation of salt works from across the world, and
archaeological excavations at Byrne’s salt works, this thesis contributes significant
information to overall knowledge of salt production during the nineteenth century.
Additionally, this thesis demonstrates the difficulties of researching a poorlydocumented, small-scale industry. Also importantly, the research into Byrne’s salt works
provides insight into the personality of a pivotal figure in the history of the Copano Bay
area.
