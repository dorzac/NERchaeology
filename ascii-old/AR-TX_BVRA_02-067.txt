ABSTRACT
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) performed a cultural resources
survey of a water line replacement project in central Angelina County, Texas in July
1999. This project was conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee permit number
2210. The project area was investigated by shovel probing and testing. The area
investigated consisted of five areas (A-E), a total of 6.8 miles with a right-of-way of 10
feet (8.3 acres). Overall, the area examined was found to be very disturbed through
construction associated with the existing water line and other utilities and adjacent
residential and commercial development. High probability areas received the most
attention, and no archaeological sites were found. It is recommended that construction
be allowed to proceed as planned by the City of Lufkin. Copies of the final report are on
file at the Division of Archeology, Texas Historical Commission; Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory; the City of Lufkin; and BVRA in Bryan, Texas.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Lufkin proposes to replace an existing water line in central Angelina
County, Texas (Figure 1). Of the total area to be affected, only 6.8 miles with a 10 foot
right-of-way (8.3 acres), were required by the Division of Archeology, Texas Historical
Commission to be examined by a professional archaeologist. The 6.8 miles consists of
five separate areas and are referred to in this report as areas A-E. The project area is
depicted on two topographic quadrangles, Lufkin (dated 1949 and photorevised in 1980)
(Figures 2-3) and Keltys (dated 1949 and photorevised in 1980) (Figure 4). It should be
noted that these maps are very out of date. Only one house appears on the Lufkin
quadrangle in the area referred to as Area C in this report. Prior to the survey, for
example, this tract was considered to be a very high probability area for an
archaeological site. Today, however, the southern part of Area C within the City rightof-way contains an apartment complex; other areas examined contain shopping malls,
subdivisions, and commercial structures.
According to the letter from William A. Martin (dated June 7, 1999) to John Rusk
of Goodwin-Lasiter, Inc., portions of the project area "may contain undiscovered historic
or prehistoric sites, some of which may be eligible for inclusion in the National Register
of Historic Places or may warrant designation as State Archeological Landmarks." Mr.
Martin further states that an archaeological survey should be performed for all portions
of the project area highlighted in yellow on the "attached project area maps." In order to
comply with this request, the City of Lufkin retained BVRA to conduct this service which
was performed under Texas Antiquities permit 2210 with William E. Moore the Principal
Investigator.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The following general discussion of Angelina County was taken from the Soil
Survey of Angelina County (Dolezel (1988:1-4). Angelina County is located in the
central part of East Texas. The northern and southern parts of the county have a
dendritic drainage system with many large streams. Two rivers, Nueces and Angelina,
drain the county. Elevation ranges from about 100 feet in the south near the Nueces
River to about 460 feet in the northern part of the county. Angelina County is in the
East Texas Timberlands Land Resource Area and forest products are a major part of
the local economy. Soils in this area formed mainly under forest vegetation in a humid
environment, and most are light in color and low in natural fertility. Nearly level areas
are often wet, and moderately steep-to-steep areas tend to erode easily. When
possible, descriptions of soils specific to the project area appear in the Results and
Conclusions section of this report. Angelina County has long, hot summers because of
moist tropical air from the Gulf of Mexico persistently covers the area. Winters are cool
and fairly short. Rainfall is fairly heavy throughout the year, and prolonged droughts are
rare. The total annual precipitation is 41 inches. Of this, 21 inches (50%) usually falls
in April through September. In winter, the average temperature is 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, and the average daily minimum temperature is 39 degrees. In summer, the
average temperature is 82 degrees, and the average daily maximum temperature is 93
degrees.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to a recently published planning document for the Eastern Planning
Region of Texas (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.1.2), Angelina County is
situated within the Northeast Texas archeological study region. In 1985, according to a
statistical overview prepared by the Texas Historical Commission (Biesaart et al.
1985:107), Angelina County contained 52 recorded sites. The site files at TARL
revealed 172 recorded sites at the time of this survey. In 1985, 1 site in the county had
been excavated, 21 had been tested by hand, 1 had been tested by machine, 30 sites
had been dug by collectors, and 46 had been surface collected. Nine recorded
prehistoric sites in the county were listed as Archaic, and 41 sites were listed as Late
Prehistoric (Biesaart 1985:108). Five sites contained burials.
In 1991, an evaluation was made of significant sites in the Northeast Texas
Archeological Region (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Table 2.1.1). At this time Angelina
County contained 121 recorded prehistoric sites; of this number 19 were listed as not
significant, 67 as unknown significance, 35 as probably significant, and 22 as
significant.
The archaeological significance of Angelina County is partially reflected in the
following statistics. In 1993, the county contained the second highest number of
important known hunter-gatherer sites in Northeast Texas (n=3) (Kenmotsu and Perttula
1993:Figure 2.3.3) and also contained at least 13 important Late Caddoan sites (n=13)
(Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 2.5.2). Unfortunately, there are major forces that
continue to threaten the integrity of archaeological sites in Angelina County. These
include population growth (City of Lufkin and surrounding area), highway construction,
surface lignite mining, Sam Rayburn Reservoir (formerly McGee Bend), and the
lumbering industry.
Although private contract archaeology firms have played a part, most of the
archaeological sites known to exist in Angelina County have been identified by surveys
associated with reservoir construction and in-house projects by National Forest
personnel. The earliest archaeological research in the area was performed in the late
1930s and early 1940s by researchers from The University of Texas at Austin. At that
time prehistoric cemeteries and mound sites were considered to be of primary
importance. From the late 1940s until the mid 1970s, most of the archaeological
research in East Texas was carried out in connection with reservoir construction. In
1948, for example, Robert L. Stephenson published the results of his work at the
proposed McGee Bend Reservoir in Angelina, Jasper, Nacogdoches, Sabine, and San
Augustine counties (Stephenson 1948a, 1948b). At the time this was the only
systematic professional major archaeological investigation in the county.

In the 1970s, Ross Fields (1979) presented an overview of the cultural resources
of the Davy Crockett, Sam Houston, Angelina, and Sabine National Forests of Texas.
This document provides a brief discussion of all sites in each forest; 23 sites in Angelina
County are mentioned. Another important document for this area is a cultural resource
overview of the National Forests in Texas by John Ippolito (1983). Of particular
relevance to this project is Ippolito's Figure 21 entitled "Drainage Systems & Probability
Zones, Angelina National Forest, Texas."
Although no part of the project area is within the Angelina National Forest,
Ippolito's figure covers areas within 10 miles of the City of Lufkin. He considers the
Neches and Angelina rivers to be high probability areas with several streams in the
county listed as medium probability areas. According to Ippolito (personal
communication, July 15, 1999), there are several drainages in the county such as
Hurricane Creek and Biloxi Creek that should be considered to be medium to high
probability areas. Ephemeral streams such as Ippolito views those in Area A of the
current project area as low probability areas.
It is beyond the scope of this report to discuss in detail the archaeological
background of Angelina County, especially when numerous contract reports are
available. The interested reader is referred to the statistical overview (Biesaart et al.
1985), the planning document published by the Texas Historical Commission
(Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993), and other reports cited above for more detailed
information regarding the archaeology of Angelina County.

FIELD METHODS
This project was performed by driving all of the roads identified by THC
personnel as being in areas that needed to be subjected to an archaeological survey.
The depth of the proposed trench for the additional water line will not exceed three feet.
Shovel tests and probes were excavated in high probability areas (areas near local
water sources), and backhoe trenching was not considered necessary. All excavated
matrix was screened using 1/4 inch hardware cloth and recorded on a shovel test log
(Appendix I). In all, 17 shovel tests were excavated in the 8.3 acre project area.
Virtually the entire project area has been disturbed through prior water line installation
and various forms of residential and commercial development. The results of the
examination of these five areas (Areas A-E) are discussed separately below.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The site records at TARL yielded no previously recorded archaeological sites in
the project area. A review of the literature revealed that significant prehistoric and
historic sites are present in Angelina County. One previously recorded prehistoric site
(41AG21) is located on Cedar Creek near the confluence of this stream and Hurricane
Creek approximately 3000 meters south of Area E and 2300 meters west of Area B.
This site, recorded by Gus Arnold of the University of Texas at Austin in 1939 during his
informal survey of East Texas, is the closest known site to the current project area. This
prehistoric site is stated on the site form as about one acre in size on the top of a sandy
ridge (250 foot contour) that slopes into "bottom land and creeks to the west and north."
The age of this site is unknown; however, ceramics and projectile points suggest a Late
Prehistoric or Caddoan component. Overall, the entire project area has been disturbed
through residential and commercial development and erosion of certain landforms. The
findings at each of the five areas are discussed below.

Area A
This area (Figure 5) is 1.2 miles in length (1.4 acres) and is considered to be a
low probability area in terms of archaeological site potential. The only natural water
sources in the area are two minor tributaries of Biloxi Creek, a major stream that drains
into the Neches River to the south. Both sides of the road in this area contained deep
ditches where the new water line will be placed making it difficult to find undisturbed
areas to shovel test. According to Debbie Fitzgerald (Engineering Designer), the water
line replacement in Area A will be put in one of these ditches and will require little if any
additional excavation. Five shovel tests were excavated at the edges of the ditch, and
no evidence of a prehistoric or historic site was found. The proposed water line
replacement will have no negative affect on cultural resources in Area A.
Area B
This area (Figure 6) is 0.47 miles in length (0.6 acres). There is one prominent
landform at the 290 foot contour that appears to be a likely location for an
archaeological site; therefore, prior to this survey this was considered to be a medium to
high probability area in terms of archaeological site potential. The only natural water
sources in this area are the terminal reaches of two minor tributaries of Hurricane
Creek, a major stream in the county. The water line replacement will be placed on the
east side of the road that is very disturbed through road construction and other utilities.
The west side is a subdivision. According to John E. Ippolito (personal communication,
July 15, 1999), this was a heavily wooded area that was recently cleared to make room
for the roads and subdivision. The soil type at the top of the hill is Moswsell loam, 1 to 5
percent slopes (MsB) as described by Dolezel (1988:51). This soil occurs on smooth,
gently sloping, broad interstream divides. Typically, it has a loam surface layer about
five inches thick.

Figure 6. Area B

12

The subsoil is sticky and plastic clay to a depth of 37 inches and platy clay to a
depth of 45 inches. This soil is very slowly permeable and moderately well drained. It
has a medium available water capacity, and water erosion is a severe hazard.
Five shovel tests were excavated, and no evidence of a prehistoric or historic site
was found. Three shovel tests (B-1 - B-3) at the top of the hill, excavated at 10 meter
intervals, revealed crushed rock and concrete. Overall, the landform has a hummocky
appearance typical of land contouring. Tests B-4 and B-5, excavated at 20 meter
intervals, were placed at the northern end of this area and were also sterile. The soil in
this area is Alazan very fine sandy loam, 0 to 4 percent slopes (AaB), as described by
Dolezel (1988:23-24). This is a deep, nearly level to gently sloping soil on terraces and
low uplands throughout most of the county. This soil formed in sediment partly
reworked by wind. This soil has a high water capacity, is moderately permeable, and
somewhat poorly drained. Runoff is slow to medium. It is saturated late in winter and
early in spring. It has a water table at a depth of 18 to 30 inches. In addition to the
existing water line, other buried utilities such as electric and gas are present. The
proposed water line replacement will have no negative affect on cultural resources in
Area B.
Area C
This area (Figure 7) is 0.6 miles in length (.72 acre). That part of Area C south of
Hurricane Creek rises to a height of 280 feet and is the most likely section for the
presence of an archaeological site. The water line replacement will be placed on the
west side of the road that is very disturbed through road construction and other utilities.
The only natural water source is a minor tributary of Hurricane Creek that terminates
shortly after crossing Highway 59. Unfortunately, however, the area was cleared and
altered to accommodate an apartment complex in the project area right-of-way. When
the apartments were constructed there was at least a 100-200 foot buffer that extends
to the 10 foot right-of-way where the water line is to be replaced. Here, the soils (AaB)
are the same as those in the upland part of Area B (see discussion above). According
to John Ippolito, this area was heavily timbered until logged in the 1920s and 1930s. He
states that the soils are not well drained and highly erosive. This was confirmed by
shovel testing as tests C-1 through C-4 revealed a shallow clay less than 30 cm from
the existing ground surface.
That part of Area C north of the minor tributary of Hurricane Creek is a floodplain
that is made up of Pophers silty clay loam, frequently flooded (Po) as defined by Dolezel
(1988:54-55). This is a deep soil on broad, uniform bottomlands of the Neches River
flood plain and many of the larger creeks. This is a silty clay loam throughout and is
somewhat poorly drained and slowly permeable. It has a medium available water
capacity, and runoff is slow. This soil overflows 2 to 3 times per year in most years.
Flooding lasts for several days. The water table is at or near the surface during the cool
season. The hazard of frequent flooding of long duration and the high water table are
limitations of this soil.

13

Figure 7. Area C

At the time of this survey, this area contained standing water and numerous
crayfish mounds. Three tests (C-5 through C-7) were excavated in the southern
portion, all at 20 meter intervals. This area is considered very low probability for the
presence of an archaeological site. The proposed water line replacement will have no
negative affect on cultural resources in Area C.

14

Area D
This area (Figure 8) is 0.76 miles in length (.9 acre). The only natural water
sources in this area are Hurricane Creek and one of its tributaries that cross Highway
287 in a north-south direction. Area D consists of a highly developed section of town
that includes the loop around the City of Lufkin (287). There were no undisturbed areas
in the current project area worthy of shovel testing, due in part to the large areas that
have been covered with cement for sidewalks, parking lots, and roads. The City plans
to install the additional water line by boring beneath existing construction. The
proposed water line replacement, which will be placed on the north side of the highway,
will have no negative affect on cultural resources in Area D.
Area E
This area (Figure 9) is 3.8 miles in length (4.6 acres). The only natural water
sources in this area are Cedar Creek and several of its tributaries. Area E consists of a
highly developed section of town that includes the Brookhollow and Southridge
subdivisions. This is an area of upper income houses and well-kept yards. Overall,
Area E is in a floodplain that was built up for the subdivisions. According to Ippolito, the
entire area has been altered to accommodate the construction of roads and houses.
The area is low enough that floodplain insurance is common for homeowners adjacent
to creeks and low areas. Based on the topographic map, there are some higher
elevations that may be likely locations for archaeological sites. However, these areas
are well outside the 10 foot right-of-way. The proposed water line replacement will have
no negative affect on cultural resources in Area E.

Summary
Virtually the entire project area right-of-way is located within a disturbed context.
The original amount of disturbance required to lay the existing water line extends
beyond the present water line. Within the current project area right-of-way, the deepest
construction footprint would be a trench three feet deep and between 18 and 36 inches
wide. Although there are a few landforms within the project area where archaeological
sites might be present, no cultural materials were found in any of the shovel tests or
through surface inspection. It is highly unlikely that, should any sites be present, they
would contain intact deposits and possess significant research potential. It should be
stated here that, many shovel tests were not dug to a depth of three feet, a large
number were placed in existing ditches that extended the depth of the tests to below
three feet from the existing ground surface outside of the 10 foot right-of-way.

18

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the absence of archaeological sites in the project area, it is
recommended that construction be allowed to proceed as planned. It is always possible
that archaeological sites are missed during any archaeological survey. Should
evidence of a prehistoric or historic site in the project area right-of-way be discovered
during construction, all work in this area should cease immediately until the Archeology
Division, Texas Historical Commission can evaluate the situation.
