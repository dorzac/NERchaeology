National Register Testing at Sites 41BP585, 41BP594, and 41BP595
Three Oaks Mine, Bastrop County, Texas

ABSTRACT
Between October 2012 and July 2013, Atkins conducted National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
eligibility testing at historic sites 41BP585 and 41BP594 and prehistoric site 41BP595, located within the
Three Oaks Mine in Bastrop County, Texas, which is owned and operated by Luminant. Impacts to all three
sites are anticipated as a result of planned mine development. This work was conducted under the direction
of Principal Investigator David L. Sherman. This report of investigations was written at Atkins and is being
finalized by Blanton & Associates, with David L. Sherman remaining as the Principal Investigator.
This work demonstrated that significant archeological deposits that may contribute to the overall NRHP
eligibility statuses of the two historic sites are absent at both sites. Standing architecture at 41BP594,
however, has previously been determined to be eligible for listing on the NRHP (Martin 2001). Archival
research conducted as part of the current investigation into the histories of the historic sites remains
inconclusive with respect to the identity of their 1870s and earlier occupants.
Testing at prehistoric site 41BP595 indicated it resulted from multiple occupational episodes during the
period from the late Paleoindian to the Late Prehistoric. Shovel testing and mechanical trenching revealed
the presence of an expansive buried anthrogenic A soil horizon, or midden, replete with preserved
subsistence remains. Mechanical trenching also exposed a variety of burned rock cooking facilities partially
surrounding the midden area. Radiocarbon assays of burned nut shells recovered from feature contexts,
along with the assemblage of diagnostic lithic artifacts, suggest the site was most intensively occupied from
the Late Archaic to the early Late Prehistoric. A suite of special studies was conducted on burned rock
samples recovered from four of the better-preserved burned rock features. These studies, which include
residue, starch, and phytolith analysis, suggest that the burned rock features were used in part to process
tubers/roots and grass seeds for subsistence. Macrobotanical analysis of flotation samples recovered from
feature contexts identified spent fuel remains including oak and hickory wood and subsistence remains
including oak, hickory, black walnut, and acorn burned nut shells. A small amount of burned bulb, possibly
representing wild onion, was also recovered through flotation. These findings suggest that significant
archeological deposits important to understanding the Late Archaic to early Late Prehistoric period have
been preserved at 41BP595.

INTRODUCTION
Between October 2012 and July 2013, Atkins conducted National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
eligibility testing at historic sites 41BP585 and 41BP594 and prehistoric site 41BP595, located within the
Three Oaks Mine in Bastrop County, Texas (Figures 1 and 2), which is owned and operated by Luminant.
Impacts to all three sites are anticipated as a result of planned mine development. This work was conducted
under the direction of Principal Investigator David L. Sherman. This report of investigations was written at
Atkins and is being finalized by Blanton & Associates (B&A), with David L. Sherman remaining as the
Principal Investigator.
All three sites were subjected to an intensive program of shovel testing. Limited hand excavation was
conducted on the two historic sites. In addition to shovel testing, the prehistoric site was sampled with
mechanically excavated trenches and hand-excavated units. The standing architecture at 41BP594 has
previously been determined to be eligible for inclusion to the NRHP (Martin 2001). Archival research
conducted as part of the current investigation into the histories of the historic sites was inconclusive with
respect to the identity of the occupants during the 1870s and earlier.
Shovel testing and hand excavation at 41BP585 and 41BP594 have shown that significant archeological
deposits have not been preserved at either site. Testing has demonstrated that site 41BP585 lacks the data
resources to warrant NRHP inclusion under any eligibility criteria. Consequently, no further investigation
is warranted nor recommended. The standing architecture at 41BP594 has been determined to be eligible
for NRHP inclusion under Criterion A, as part of a Rural Historic District (Penick 2001, Martin 2001).
Additionally, the standing architecture may be eligible for NRHP inclusion under Criterion D for its
potential to yield information about log building construction in Central Texas (Martin 2001). It is
recommended that impact to the standing architecture at 41BP594 be avoided. If this is not feasible, it is
recommended that a treatment plan be developed in consultation with the Texas Historical Commission
(THC) to mitigate negative impact stemming from mine-related development.
Shovel testing at site 41BP595 revealed the presence of three sub-site areas and an expansive sub-surface
anthrogenic A horizon. Mechanical and hand excavation within the sub-site areas exposed 33 cultural
features, ranging from simple rock hearths to large burned rock cooking facilities. A fully representative
sample of the features identified was sampled. Seventeen features were excavated by hand, three features
were drawn but not excavated, and one feature was partially excavated. Feature 30 was sampled with two
50 by 50 centimeter (cm) units. The remaining eleven features were photographed after exposure and
subsequently reburied. Testing at the prehistoric site (41BP595) indicate it resulted from multiple
occupational episodes during the period extending from the late Paleoindian to the early Late Prehistoric.
Radiocarbon assays of burned nut shells recovered from feature contexts along with the assemblage of
diagnostic lithic artifacts suggest the site was most intensively utilized during the Late Archaic II to the
Late Prehistoric Austin Phase.
A suite of special studies was conducted on burned rock samples recovered from four of the better preserved
features. These studies, which include residue, starch, and phytolith analysis, suggest that the burned rock
features were used in part to process tubers/roots and grass seeds for subsistence.

Macrobotanical analysis of flotation samples recovered from feature contexts identified spent fuel remains
including oak and hickory wood and subsistence remains including oak, hickory, black walnut, and acorn
burned nut shells. A small amount of burned bulb, possibly representing wild onion, was also recovered
through flotation.
This work demonstrated that significant cultural deposits, which are likely to yield information important
to understanding the Late Archaic to early Late Prehistoric period in Bastrop County, and are eligible for
NRHP inclusion under Criterion D, have been preserved on site 41BP595. It is recommended that impact
to 41BP595 be avoided. If this is not feasible, it is recommended that anticipated mine-related adverse
impacts to site 41BP595 are mitigated through data recovery investigations.
These investigations were performed in compliance with the Protection of Historic Properties regulations
(36 CFR 800), which govern the Section 106 review process as established by the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966 (PL 89-665), as amended in 1974, 1976, 1980, and 1992; the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL 91-190, 83 Stat. 915, 42 USC 4231, 1970); the Office of Surface
Mining Regulations, as superseded by the Coal Mining Regulations of the Texas Railroad Commission,
1981, as updated in 1989; other appropriate cultural resources legislation; and the guidelines set forth by
the Council of Texas Archeologists and the Register of Professional Archaeologists.
Including this introduction, this report has eight sections and four appendices. Sections 2 and 3 describe the
natural and cultural settings of the Three Oaks Mine. Section 4 includes the research design and methods
used to test the three sites. The testing results for sites 41BP585, 41BP594, and 41BP595 are presented in
Sections 5, 6, and 7 respectively. A summary of the results of these investigations along with site specific
recommendations are contained in Section 8. Appendix A includes tables relevant to the Phytolith, Starch,
and Organic Residue analysis described in Section 7. Appendix B includes the tables referenced in the
Macrobotanical Analysis in Section 7. Appendix C contains the geoarcheological analysis data.

NATURAL SETTING
VEGETATION
The Three Oaks Mine is contained entirely within the Post Oak Savannah Vegetational Area, as defined by
Gould (1975). The Post Oak Savannah region, dominated by climax prairie grasses and scattered oak trees,
covers approximately 8.5 million acres within Texas and is bordered by the Pineywoods region to the east
and the Blackland Prairie region to the west. Elevation ranges from approximately 300 to 800 feet above
mean sea level (msl) within the Post Oak Savannah, and gently rolling to hilly topography is common
(Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs [LBJ] 1978).
Historically, plant succession in the Post Oak Savannah was strongly influenced by natural wildfire, with
frequent, low-intensity fires maintaining the savannah character of this plant community. Modern land use
practices result in the suppression of natural fire and, in the absence of this control mechanism, woody
invaders such as yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana), and greenbrier
(Smilax spp.) are able to develop deep understory and shrub layer thickets. Thickets of yaupon and eastern
red cedar are common throughout the modern Post Oak Savannah, especially in areas not managed to
preclude these species, and their presence can indicate a deterioration of this plant community (Hatch et al.
1990; Thomas 1975). Additionally, the lack of factors that previously maintained the savannah has also
resulted in the development of much more dense woodlands throughout the region.
The two tree species that dominate the Post Oak Savannah Vegetational Area are post oak (Quercus stellata)
and blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), which occur in upland habitats and are commonly associated
with winged elm (Ulmus alata), cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia), black hickory (Carya texana), eastern red
cedar, and sugar hackberry (Celtis laevigata). The climax grasses associated with the Post Oak Savannah
include little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), switchgrass
(Panicum virgatum), silver bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), purpletop (Tridens flavus), tall dropseed
(Sporobolus asper var. asper), and Texas wintergrass (Nassella leucotricha) (Hatch et al. 1990). However,
much of the forests have been cleared for agricultural use since European settlement, and most acreage is
in improved pastureland.
The modern-day practice of livestock grazing within the Post Oak Savannah has resulted in a shift of species
composition from the climax herbaceous species such as those listed above toward introduced pasture grass
species such as bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon), dallisgrass (Paspalum dilatatum), and bahiagrass
(Paspalum notatum). Native herbaceous species that remain in unimproved, yet disturbed, habitats often
include buffalograss (Buchloe dactyloides), common curly mesquite (Hilaria berlangeri), threeawns
(Aristida spp.), red lovegrass (Eragrostis oxylepis), broomsedge bluestem (Andropogon virginicus),
splitbeard bluestem (Andropogon ternarius), smutgrass (Sporobolus indicus), yankeeweed (Eupatorium
compositifolium), western ragweed (Ambrosia psilostachya), and silverleaf nightshade (Solanum
elaeagnifolium).

CLIMATE
The climate of east-central Texas is humid and subtropical because of the flow of warm, moist air from the
Gulf of Mexico. Summers are typically hot and humid, while winters are generally mild. However, sudden
changes in temperature can occur during winter when cold, dry polar air masses replace warm, moist
tropical air. During spring months, precipitation results from thunderstorms that are generally of high
intensity and short duration. While these storms are most frequent in the spring, they can occur anytime
during the year. Generalized, area-wide rainfall resulting from warm or stationary fronts lying across Texas
is most common in winter months. The predominantly anti-cyclonic circulation over eastern Texas in the
summer tends to exclude cold fronts from the area, resulting in a decrease in rainfall. The meteorological
disturbances that produce precipitation within the region are highly variable. Average annual rainfall for
Bastrop and Lee counties is approximately 35â40 inches (TWDB 2007). The monthly mean precipitation
total is greatest in May and lowest in August.
BIOTIC PROVINCES
Blair (1950) delineated seven biotic provinces in Texas, based on the distribution of topographic features,
climate, vegetation types, and terrestrial vertebrates, excluding birds. The mine area lies within the Texan
Biotic Province. The Texan biotic province encompasses an area west to the Balcones Escarpment and east
to the Austroriparian biotic province and is characterized by an intermingling of forest and grassland
associations (Blair 1950). The Texan province has no endemic species of vertebrates, with a fauna
consisting of a mixture of western grassland and eastern forest species (Blair 1950). The eastern boundary
corresponds generally to the western limits of the pine/hardwood forests. It also contains numerous swamps
and marshes, some of considerable extent (Dice 1943). According to Hubbs (1957), the distribution of
freshwater fishes within the state generally correlates with the terrestrial-vertebrate province boundaries,
although east-central Texas deviates to some extent from this general rule. The aquatic biotic communities
are typical of the region as a whole.
GEOLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
The surface geology of the sites examined in this document is dominated by the Eocene-aged Calvert Bluff
formation, of the Wilcox Group, which is âmostly mudstone with varying amounts of sandstone, lignite,
ironstone concretions, and in the uppermost part locally glauconiticâ (BEG 1974). This was the presumed
source of the hematite/hematitic sandstone and sandstone recovered from prehistoric site 41BP595. The
source for the raw materials identified as quartzite, silicified wood, and chert is, however, less certain. The
ubiquity of these materials at 41BP595 suggests rather strongly that they were obtained on site or in very
close proximity to the site. These materials could have been obtained from Quaternary high gravel deposits.
Although no such deposits are depicted in the vicinity of the site on the Geologic Atlas of Texas, Austin
Sheet (BEG 1974), such deposits are depicted several miles away. Expansive deposits of Quaternary high
gravels are located about 12 miles to the southwest and west of the site near Willbarger and Cottonwood
creeks. Additionally, a very small outcrop is located about 5 miles southwest from 41BP595, near the
confluence of Yegua Creek and Paint Creek. Although no outcrops of Quaternary high gravels are mapped
near Big Sandy Creek, the closest substantial creek to the site, the presence of such deposits within the

region underscores the possibility that additional smaller gravel deposits are present close by, and possibly
on site, that were not large enough to be depicted on the Atlas (BEG 1974).
The Three Oaks Mine is located in the Colorado and Brazos river basins in east-central Texas. The Colorado
River basin has a drainage area of 39,428 square miles (Texas Water Development Board [TWDB], 2007)
and is bounded to the north and east by the Brazos River basin and to the west and south by the Guadalupe
River basin. The Brazos River basin has a drainage area of 42,865 square miles (TWDB, 2007) and is
bounded to the east by the Trinity River basin and to the south and west by the Colorado River basin. The
Three Oaks Mine area is drained by tributaries of Middle Yegua Creek and Sandy Creek. Lake Summerville
is an impoundment of the Yegua Creek system located immediately east of the mine area. Sandy Creek
drains to the south and is a tributary of the Colorado River. All of the Big Sandy Creek watershed is located
within the Colorado River watershed and is within Bastrop County.

CULTURAL SETTING
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
The earliest archeological investigations in the region were undertaken in the 1930s with reconnaissance
surveys by the University of Texas and their later excavation and removal of two burials at site 41BP1 in
1953. However, the earliest, large-scale archeological survey in the region was conducted by the Texas
Archeological Salvage Project of the University of Texas in 1961 for the proposed Somerville Reservoir in
Lee, Burleson, and Washington counties. Thirty-nine sites were recorded, which were primarily prehistoric
surface scatters in cultivated fields (Honea 1961). Soon after, the Texas Archeological Salvage Project
completed the initial reconnaissance investigations for the Laneport (now Granger) Reservoir in eastern
Williamson County (Shafer and Corbin 1965).
The first systematic controlled excavation in the region was Gilmoreâs (1969) work at the San Xavier
Mission complex near the confluence of the San Gabriel River and Brushy Creek in northwestern Milam
County. In 1973, the Texas Archeological Salvage Project conducted limited testing on three sites at
Granger Reservoir (41WM118, 41WM133, and 41WM135) (Eddy 1973) and the Texas Archeological
Survey tested 41WM230, the Loeve-Fox Site (Prewitt 1974; 1982). Sites 41WM133, 41WM135, and
41WM230 were deemed significant and warranted further excavation.
Beginning in 1976, several intensive archeological surveys took place in the region. The THC conducted
an approximate 12,000-acre survey at the Sandow Mine in Lee and Milam counties south of Highway 79
and located 70 archeological sites, of which 37 were prehistoric, with a temporal range from the Middle
Archaic through the Late Prehistoric period (Betancourt 1977). Two sites were tested but had little depth
and were not recommended for additional work. Three prehistoric sites located during the survey were
recommended for additional testing.
In the same year, Texas A&M University began intensive survey investigations at Granger Reservoir
(Patterson and Moore 1976, Moore et al. 1978). Eighteen new sites were discovered and 47 previously
recorded sites were reevaluated. Texas A&M also tested three sites, 41WM21, 41WM124, and 41WM133,
all of which were recommended for further excavation (Moore 1976).
Data Recovery excavations pursuant to the construction of Granger Reservoir included those conducted by
the Texas Archeological Survey of the University of Texas at Austin at the Loeve-Fox Site (41WM230)
and the Loeve Site (41WM133) (Dibble and Prewitt 1982; Prewitt 1981), as well as at three sites
(41WM130, 41WM284, and 41WM294) collectively known as the Hoxie Bridge Sites, excavated by Texas
A&M University (Bond 1978).
At the Loeve-Fox Site (41WM230), discrete episodes of occupations extending from the Middle Archaic
Round Rock Phase through the Late Prehistoric Toyah Phase were found. Numerous cultural features
primarily representing cooking and warming hearths were uncovered, and a sequence of three occupations
was recognized, with each episode displaying feature patterning indicative of a circular encampment similar
to those documented for the Plains Indians. Features were often found within recognizable pits and thus
could be more comfortably associated with artifactual debris. More limited excavations at the Loeve Site
8

National Register Testing at Sites 41BP585, 41BP594, and 41BP595
Three Oaks Mine, Bastrop County, Texas

(41WM133) yielded evidence of a discrete episode of camping during the early Archaic Circleville Phase
(7000-8500 years B.P. [Before Present]). The patterning of features and debris suggests a hunting and
gathering encampment that was situated on a gravel point bar.
Of the three sites excavated by Texas A&M University at the Granger Reservoir, only site 41WM130
contained in situ subsurface deposits. It yielded evidence of prehistoric occupation during the Late Archaic
Twin Sisters Phase through the late Prehistoric Toyah Phase. Lithic reduction techniques used at the site
were largely confined to working of cobbles into lanceolate-shaped bifaces and the production of blades
from platform cores. While minor changes in lithic technology occurred through time at the site, and later
Toyah occupations used ceramics and exploited bison, there was a general pattern of continuity in
subsistence technology. Like the Loeve-Fox Site, discrete occupational evidence, in the form of wellpreserved stone-lined fire pits was found at 41WM130. While functional interpretations regarding the use
of these pits were largely conjectural, Bond (1978:233) suggested that the fire pits were not used to process
a single food source but that the rock pavements found in the pits acted as a supportive grill for baking of
a variety of foods.
Texas A&M University began archeological investigations at the Sandow Mine in 1976 with the initial
survey of the Industrial Generating Company's lignite mining area near the headwaters of East Yegua Creek
southeast of the Alcoa Aluminum Company complex (Hillier 1977). Six small prehistoric lithic scatters
were recorded during this survey. One site, 41MM106, was recommended for testing, which was conducted
in May of 1977, but the site had no discernible stratigraphy, and no further investigation was recommended
(Weed 1977).
In 1977, Texas A&M University conducted a survey of the area of the Sandow Mine then known as the
North Leases, located north of Highway 79 (Weed and Ippolito 1977). Nine prehistoric sites and seven
historic sites were recorded. One prehistoric site, 41MM116, was tested and occupations with stratigraphic
integrity more than a meter (m) in depth dating to the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods were
documented. Due to the paucity of artifacts and features, the testing investigation was considered adequate
mitigation, and no further work was recommended (Weed and Whittaker 1980:73).
In 1978, Texas A&M University conducted NRHP testing at three prehistoric sites and three historic mining
sites initially recorded by Bentancourt in 1977 (Ippolito and Childs 1978). The prehistoric sites were found
to be stratigraphically compressed and exhibited few diagnostic artifacts. None of these sites met the
requirements for inclusion to the NRHP.
The next major archeological survey investigation in the region was a 4,000-acre survey conducted at Camp
Swift in Bastrop County in 1979 by the Texas Archeological Survey of the University of Texas. The survey
recorded 42 prehistoric sites and 43 historic sites and tested eight prehistoric sites (Skelton and Freeman
1979).
In 1980, Texas A&M University conducted a survey within the Sandow Mine in Milam and Lee counties.
Eight prehistoric sites and 24 historic sites were recorded. Four of the prehistoric sites, including 41LE57,
41LE59, 41LE60, and 41MM138 were recommended for further investigation (Rushmore et al. 1980).

In 1980, the Center for Archaeological Research of the University of Texas at San Antonio conducted a
reconnaissance survey of eight tracts along the east side of FM 696 in northern Bastrop County and southern
Lee County totaling about 1,900 acres planned for lignite mining by CPS Energy. This was the first largescale survey investigation within the present Three Oaks Mine area. Nine sites, 41BP199-41BP206, and
41LE63 were recorded, including five prehistoric sites (41BP199, 41BP204, 41BP205, 41BP206, and
41LE63) and four historic sites (41BP200, 41BP201, 41BP202, and 41BP203). Sites 41BP204, 41BP205,
and 41BP206 were recommended as potentially NRHP-eligible. However, all three sites were outside of
the project area, along Big Sandy Creek west of FM 696. Historic site 41BP200 is the Morgan Chapel
Cemetery, which is protected by state law. The remaining five sites were not thought to be NRHP-eligible
(Kelly and Roemer 1981).
In 1983, the Center for Archaeological Research of the University of Texas at San Antonio conducted an
intensive survey for CPS Energy of four of the eight tracts previously surveyed in 1980 (Kelley and Roemer
1981) and one new tract, totaling 712 acres. These survey areas are within the present Three Oaks Mine
area. Seven sites were located or relocated (41BP200, 41BP203, 41BP264, 41BP265, 41LE73, 41LE74,
and 41LE75). Sites 41BP200 (the Morgan Chapel Cemetery), 41BP203, 41LE74, and 41LE75 were historic
sites, dating chiefly to the mid-to late 19th century. Sites 41BP264, 41BP265, and 41LE73 were prehistoric
sites. Site 41BP264 was tested but found to be completely disturbed. None of the sites were recommended
for further investigation. The Morgan Chapel Cemetery was mapped and documented and recommended
for relocation prior to construction.
In 1981-1982, the Texas Archeological Survey surveyed the Lower Colorado River Authorityâs 1,200-acre
Powell Bend mine in Bastrop County. The survey located 30 prehistoric and 22 historic sites (Kenmotsu et
al. 1982). Four sites were tested, and data recovery investigations were conducted at sites 41BP191 (a large
habitation site dating to the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods) and 41BP192 (a large burned rock
midden) (Bement 1984).
In 1983, Texas A&M University conducted additional survey investigations in the northern part of the
Sandow Mine in Milam County, which conststed of five widely separate areas totaling approximately 2,000
acres. Fifty-one sites including 10 prehistoric sites and 41 historic sites were recorded. Three prehistoric
sites and five historic sites were recommended as potentially NRHP-eligible (Carlson et al. 1983).
In 1984, the Center for Archaeological Research of the University of Texas at San Antonio conducted an
intensive survey for CPS Energy of 985 acres of the CPS Butler lignite prospect in northern Bastrop County
and southern Lee County, within the present Three Oaks Mine area. Fourteen archeological sites were
identified during this project including two prehistoric sites (41BP271 and 41BP272), 11 historic sites
(41BP202, 41BP272, 41BP274, 41BP275, 41BP276, 41BP277, 41BP278, 41LE86, 41LE87, 41LE88, and
41LE89), and one multicomponent site (41LE85). None of the sites were considered NRHP-eligible (Taylor
1987).
In 1985-1986, further investigations were conducted for a new permit area at the Sandow Mine in Milam
and Lee counties by Espey, Huston & Associates with two surveys totaling 1,737 acres (James 1986; James

10

National Register Testing at Sites 41BP585, 41BP594, and 41BP595
Three Oaks Mine, Bastrop County, Texas

and Moore 1987). Six historic sites and five prehistoric sites were located, none of which warranted further
investigation.
In 1985-1986, the Texas Archeological Survey conducted a 3,400-acre intensive survey along the Colorado
River lowland zone in Bastrop County, funded by the Bastrop County Historical Commission and a
National Register Thematic District Grant. Prior to this investigation, almost all previous large-scale
surveys in the region were in upland areas. Thirty-nine sites were recorded dating to Paleoindian, Archaic,
and Late Prehistoric periods. Test excavations were conducted at two sites: 41BP66, a Late Archaic and
Late Prehistoric encampment, and 41BP279, where a Toyah phase Late Prehistoric component was
identified. A Middle and Late Archaic cemetery, 41BP282, was also identified. The prehistoric findings
contributed to construction of a prehistoric settlement system model for the Colorado River valley
(Robinson 1987).
In the mid-1980s, highway widening projects prompted data recovery investigations at four important sites
in the region. Two sitesâ41BP19, the Kennedy Bluffs Site, and 41BP280, the Bull Pen Siteâwere located
on the Colorado River in Bastrop County. Site 41BU16 is located on the Brazos River in eastern Burleson
County, and the Bessie Kruze Site (41WM13) is on Brushy Creek in southeastern Williamson County.
At the Kennedy Bluffs Site, cultural remains consisted of burned rock hearth features composed of
quartzite, sandstone, chert, and petrified wood and lithic tools dating primarily to the Middle Archaic
periods. Occupations were attributed to Central Texas groups, based on the presence of a large number of
Pedernales- and Bulverde-like dart points as well as Clear Fork gouges, drills or perforators, and
interestingly, a slab of graphite (Bement 1989; Bement et al. 1989).
Excavations at the Bull Pen Site (41BP280) produced materials from as early as the Early Archaic period,
though the major occupations occurred during the Middle Archaic and produced evidence of use as a
hunting and gathering encampment of small groups of people, probably on a seasonal round in a continuum
that began by at least 3500 years B.P. and continued to the Late Prehistoric. The chipped stone artifact
inventory at Bull Pen included Pedernales, Fairland/Ensor, Darl, and Scallorn projectile points. Subsistence
evidence at the site was largely indirect, with grinding tools indicating plant food processing and numerous
projectile point types demonstrating the importance of hunting (Ensor and Mueller-Wille 1988).
Excavations conducted by Texas A&M at 41BU16 yielded prehistoric burials dating to between 4000 B.P.
and possibly as late as 450 B.P. Evidence in the form of four rock cooking hearths attested to the use of the
site as an encampment as well. Projectile points found at the site were equally representative of those from
both Central and Southeast Texas, while ceramics recovered were aligned with Southeast Texas. The
authors questioned the applicability of either the Central Texas or Southeast Texas culture
history/chronological models to the Post Oak Savannah of eastern Central Texas (Roemer and Carlson
1987).
The Bessie Kruze Site (41WM13) was excavated by the Texas Department of Transportation in 1988 and
1989 (Johnson 2000). The site occupied an ancient terrace along Brushy Creek composed of stratified
alluvial deposits that were approximately 1.3 m to 1.4 m thick. The primary prehistoric deposits included a

11

cremation burial. Late Archaic I deposits containing Pedernales dart points comprised the bulk of the
deposit, though later Late Archaic II wide corner-notched points also occurred.
In 1989, North American Consultants surveyed a new 1,370-acre area in the Sandow Mine in Milam and
Lee counties (LaVardera and Keller 1989). Additionally, because the THC had redefined intensive survey
requirements, an additional 1,780-acres including portions of several earlier surveys were resurveyed
(Betancourt 1977; Hillier 1977; Rushmore et al. 1980; James and Moore 1987). Eighteen sites were located.
Five of these sites, 41LE113, 41LE115, 41LE117, 41LE120, and 41MM277, were considered to be
potentially NRHP-eligible due to high artifact density and deep, relatively intact cultural deposits, and were
recommended for further investigation. Three previously recorded sites, 41LE57, 41LE59, and 41LE60
were tested, of which 41LE59 was considered to be NRHP-eligible.
In 1989, two multi-component sites along the Onion Creek valley in east-central Hays County, the Barton
Site (41HY202) and the Mustang Branch Site (41HY209), were excavated by the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (Ricklis and Collins 1994). Early and Late Archaic projectiles and burned rock
features were associated with the Barton Site. At the Mustang Branch Site, a Late Archaic era burned rock
midden was encountered. Two Late Prehistoric intervals, Austin and Toyah, were also documented (Ricklis
and Collins 1994). In 1994, Espey, Huston & Associates conducted data recovery investigations at the
Chesser Site (41LE59) at the Sandow Mine in Lee County. The site yielded cultural remains from the late
Paleoindian through Late Prehistoric periods. Well-stratified cultural deposits about 1.3 m thick and intact
features from the latter part of the Middle Archaic period through the Late Prehistoric periods were
encountered during the excavation. The site generally represents numerous low-intensity occupations with
the greatest degree of human activity during the Late Archaic II subperiod, dating from around 600 B.C. to
A.D. 600 (Rogers and Kotter 1995).
Also in 1994, Espey, Huston & Associates conducted a cultural resources survey of 380 acres for Alcoaâs
Sandow Mine (Hageman 1994). The survey recorded two multicomponent prehistoric and historic
archeological sites, 41MM304 and 41MM305. Neither site was recommended for further investigation.
In 1996, Espey, Huston & Associates conducted a 202-acre survey along Ham Branch south of Praesel at
the Sandow Mine in Milam County. Six prehistoric sites (41MM310, 41MM311, 41MM312, 41MM314,
41MM315, and 41MM317) and three multicomponent prehistoric/historic sites (41MM309, 41MM313,
41MM316) were located. Three of the prehistoric sites, 41MM310, 41MM315, and 41MM317 were
recommended as potentially NRHP-eligible and warranting further investigation (Tate and Bates 1996).
In 1997, Espey, Huston & Associates conducted a 2,420-acre survey west of Highway 77 between Rockdale
and Lexington in Lee and Milam counties. Forty-six sites were located including 23 prehistoric sites, 16
historic sites, and seven multicomponent prehistoric/historic sites. Ten prehistoric sites (41LE134,
41LE144, 41LE149, 41LE154, 41LE157, 41LE166, 41LE175, 41LE176, 41LE17, and 41MM321) and one
historic site (41LE145) were recommended as potentially NRHP-eligible and warranting further
investigation (Tate et al. 1997).
During 1997-1998, Espey, Huston & Associates conducted a cultural resources survey of 430 acres within
the I Area Expansion and 675 acres within the H Area Expansion at the Sandow Surface Mine in Lee,
12

National Register Testing at Sites 41BP585, 41BP594, and 41BP595
Three Oaks Mine, Bastrop County, Texas

Milam, and Williamson Counties, Texas. The 430-acre tract within the I Area Expansion is within the
present Three Oaks Mine Area. Three previously recorded sites were revisited, and 25 new sites were
recorded. Seven sites (41LE190, 41LE191, 41LE192, 41LE195, 41LE196, 41MM337, and 41WM926)
within the I Area Expansion were recommended for testing (Rogers and Cruse 1998).Within the H Area
Expansion, three sites (41LE180, 41LE182, and 41LE184) were recommended for testing to determine
their NRHP status.
In 1999, Espey, Huston & Associates conducted data recovery investigations at the Walleye Creek Site
(41LE57) at the Sandow Mine in Lee County. The site yielded cultural remains from the Late Archaic II
subperiod, about 2,300 B.P., into the Late Prehistoric period, about 800 B.P. Although living surfaces were
not definable in the sandy sediments, a number of intact hearths with organic remains provided insight into
food utilization and preparation (Rogers 1999).
Also in 1999, Coastal Archaeological Research conducted NRHP testing investigations at site 41LE177 at
the Sandow Mine in Lee County. The site was found to contain intact burned rock hearth features and lithic
artifacts representing the Paleo-Indian, Early Archaic, Middle Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods, all
within unconsolidated sandy deposits. However, despite the presence of intact features, interpretation of
cultural components at 41LE177 was considered tenuous due to the paucity of diagnostic artifacts and
continuous admixture of older cultural material from upslope through colluvial deposition (Ricklis 2001).
Between 1990 and 2000, archeologists from the Center for Archaeological Research at the University of
Texas at San Antonio revisited and evaluated the 169 sites then known on Camp Swift (Tomka and Crouch
1996). Based on the results of a subsequent survey, site 41BP138 (the Wine Cellar Site) was considered
NRHP-eligible, 59 sites were considered potentially eligible and warranted further investigation, and 106
sites were considered not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. Three cemeteries are protected by state law
(Robinson et al. 2001).
Excavations at the Toyah Bluff site (41TV441), located above Onion Creek in Travis County, revealed over
20 features, including burned rock hearths and earth ovens, some of which retained vegetal remains
(Karbula et al. 2001). Faunal remains were also present, but in relatively low numbers, representing bison,
deer, dog, and turtle. Both the faunal and vegetal evidence suggest a significantly more diverse subsistence
pattern for this period than often assumed, with bison probably supplementing rather than supplanting
existing subsistence practices. Manos and metates, further signs of plant processing, were also found
frequently in association with the burned rock features. While the earliest of the features at Toyah Bluff
date to approximately A.D. 1200, at least one of the earth ovens has been dated by radiocarbon analysis to
within the normal range of Toyah activity, between A.D. 1310 and 1480. Two Scallorn points, indicative
of the Austin phase, were found near the earliest features. However, the majority of the diagnostic artifacts
found at the site appear to belong to a typical Toyah assemblage and include beveled knives, blades, drills,
end scrapers, and nine arrow points of the Perdiz type. Ceramics recovered from Toyah Bluff consisted of
39 small specimens, the majority of which were bone-tempered with sandy paste; due to similarities with
sherds from nearby sites, these may suggest a widely produced local type (Karbula et al. 2001). Other
ceramics from the site were characterized by sand and bone temper or by a very sandy paste. This latter

group may possibly reflect ties with eastern Texas or the Texas coast due to their similarities with the Goose
Creek Plain type.
Between 1999 and 2001, an intensive survey of approximately 16,000-acres of the upland divide between
the Brazos and Colorado rivers was conducted for Luminantâs Three Oaks Mine (Turpin 2003). The survey
located or relocated 78 prehistoric sites, 122 historic sites, and nine multi-component sites. The prehistoric
sites are largely sparse lithic scatters in sandy matrix sediments. Sites with temporally diagnostic artifacts
range in age from Middle Archaic to Late Prehistoric times. Ten sites (41LE224, 41LE227, 41LE245,
41LE259, 41LE289, 41LE300, 41LE302, 41LE310, 41LE311, and 41BP595) were initially recommended
as being potentially NRHP-eligible. However, sites 41LE300 and 41LE310 were tested during the course
of the investigation and were determined to be not eligible. The historic sites illustrate differing patterns of
rural development and growth, but their archeological promise is low. Five standing structures sites
(41LE306, 41BP202, 41BP275, 41BP557, and 41BP594) were recommended as NRHP-eligible.
In 2001-2003, the Center for Archaeological Studies of Texas State University conducted extensive shovel
testing investigations at 58 sites identified by Robinson et al. (2001) as potentially eligible. After intensive
shovel testing, 31 were described as having little or no integrity, and no further work was recommended.
The remaining 27 sites were recommended as requiring additional investigation (Nickels et al. 2003;
Nickels and Lehman 2004).
In the early 2000s, SWCA Environmental Consultants in Austin conducted an archeological survey of the
635-acre Hyatt Regency Lost Pines Resort area in eastern Bastrop County. A number of sites were
identified, among them 41BP627, a Late Archaic II campsite that would later be designated the McKinney
Roughs Site (Carpenter et al. 2006; Texas Beyond History [TBH] 2007). This well-stratified site lies on the
banks of the Colorado River where nearly continual deposition of sediments during repeated periods of
overbank flooding resulted in rapid burial of some of the siteâs three discrete prehistoric living surfaces,
preserving them in place. The earliest and deepest of the three components dated to about 100 B.C. (2,100
years ago), and designated the Ensor I component after the style of dart point found in the zone. Small
features of burned rock and living debris such as stone tools were found in this component. The second
component dated to roughly A.D. 200 (1,800 years ago). The Ensor II component consisted of a living
surface replete with burned rock cooking features, lithic debris from stone tool making, and food remains,
predominately mussel shells. The third and most significant occupational surface is the Darl component.
This occupational zone yielded two radiocarbon dates of about A.D. 1150 and A.D. 1100 (850-900 years
ago). The Darl component comprised a well-preserved living surface with discrete burned rock features,
charcoal, stone tools, and debitage, as well as abundant mussel shell, with little or no evidence of
overprinting from later occupations at the site.
CULTURAL HISTORY
The Three Oaks Mine is located on the southeastern edge of the Central Texas Archeological Region of the
Central and Southern Planning Region of Texas near its interface with the Prairie Savanna Archeological
Region (Ellis et al. 1995; Mercado-Allinger et al. 1996; Prewitt 1981). Archeological assemblages in this
zone often share internal similarities with both archeological regions; however, the breadth of these
similarities expresses diachronic variation.

Over the last 60 years, the Central Texas Archeological Region has been the focus of intensive archeological
investigations (see Collins 2004; Johnson and Goode 1994). As a result, a fairly detailed archeological
sequence, based primarily on projectile point styles, has been developed for the area. Much of the data upon
which this sequence is based comes from sites in the eastern Edwards Plateau and the Balcones
Canyonlands; however, the evidence suggests a generalized fluidity of boundaries for the indigenous groups
in the region, as the archeological record points to seasonal movement of some groups and interactions with
groups living in East Central Texas and the South Texas Plains. For a comprehensive review of the
significant archeological work done in this region, the reader is referred to Collins (1995; 2004), Fields
2004, and Johnson and Goode (1994).
In Central Texas, the most common types of sites are open camp sites (both shallow and deeply buried),
situated on various topographic settings, rockshelters, and surface scatters. Site characteristics vary, but
most sites are recognized by the accumulation of cultural debris. Some of the more conspicuous feature
types are burned rock middens, burned rock hearths, lithic quarries and/or scatters, and pits. Prehistoric
cemeteries have also been recorded in Bexar County (Givens 1968), Williamson County (Prewitt 1974),
and Bell County (Watt 1936).
Sites along the east/southeastern margins of Central Texas are often deeply buried in the deep sandy soils
of the Blackland Prairies or the Post Oak Savanna (Bond 1978, Brown 1986, Carpenter et al. 2006, Taylor
1987). For hunting and gathering peoples, the area would have provided rich food sources, including pecan
and hickory trees (e.g. nuts), geophytes (e.g., roots, tubers, and bulbs), terrestrial fauna, and aquatic
resources. Thus, not surprisingly, sites typically occur along the riparian corridors of rivers and streams
where resources are concentrated.
In those portions of Central Texas that are east of the Balcones Escarpment, surface exposures of bedrock
are generally less common and burned rock features are generally less common than in the remainder of
the region. This apparent bias may be due, in part, to the lower visibility of burned rock features off of the
escarpment in deeper sandy soils. However, where bedrock exposures and/or lag gravel deposits are present,
burned rock features of varying sizes and densities are often found. Sizable burned rock features measuring
1-2 m across have been found in the broad sandy mantle of the Post Oak Savanna, many of which may be
the remains of large cooking features (Black and Ellis 1997:4-5; Thoms and Ahr 1996).
Cultural developments in this region are classified by archeologists according to four primary chronological
and developmental stages: Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and Historic. These periods are defined
primarily by changes in material culture over time, as evidenced through information and artifacts recovered
from archeological sites.
Paleoindian Period (12,000-8800 B.P.)
Paleoindian sites and isolated artifacts have been found throughout Central Texas, as attested to by several
stratified sites excavated in the region. Excavations of sites found along the eastern and southern margins
of the region, such as the Pavo Real (Collins et al. 2003; Henderson and Goode 1991), Wilson Leonard
(Collins 1998), Loeve-Fox and Tombstone Bluff (Prewitt 1982), and the Gault site (Collins 1998), have

enabled a fairly well-defined chronological sequence which indicates that people have been coming to
Central Texas since the Paleoindian period, for at least 12,000 years (see also Bever and Meltzer 2007).
Collins (1995; 2004) divides the Paleoindian period into early and late subperiods. The early subperiod
includes chipped stone artifact assemblages characterized by the fluted lanceolate Clovis and Folsom points
(see Hester et al. 1985). These early assemblages yield archeological remains such as engraved stones,
exotic lithic material such as obsidian, and ochre-stained artifacts (Collins et al. 1991). Data collected from
sites such as the Kincaid Rockshelter in Uvalde County (Campbell et al. n.d.; Collins et al. 1989), the Saint
Maryâs Hall site in Bexar County (Hester 1978), the Gault Site in Bell County (Collins 1998; Black 2001),
and the Chesser Site in Lee County (Rogers and Kotter 1995) provide evidence of a generalized hunting
and gathering lifeway that provided a diverse diet of large and small animals coupled with an array of wild
plants.
The transition from the early to the late Paleoindian subperiods is marked by the appearance of several
unfluted projectile point styles whose technological and cultural significance remains uncertain. These early
âPlainview-likeâ point styles fit within the typological range of the Southern Plains Plainview points.
However, they lack the thinness and overall flaking technology seen on the Plainview type-site points
(Collins 2004). The appearance of Dalton and San Patrice dart points during this transitional period also
complicates the temporal and cultural sequence, as many of the deposits from which they were recovered
lack integrity. Both point types have been recovered from sites in Bastrop and Grimes Counties along the
margins of the Prairie Savanna region (Johnson 1989: Table 2; Rogers and Foster 1994:66). Three later
nonfluted lanceolate point types, Wilson, Golondrina, and Saint Maryâs Hall, are somewhat better defined
and appear to post-date this earlier transitional group of points (Collins 2004). Interestingly, in some of the
better documented sites, such as Wilson Leonard (Collins ed. 1998) and Horn Shelter No. 2 (Redder 1985),
the artifact assemblages and organic remains associated with these later point styles are similar to those
found in archaic assemblages. Thus, the available data led Collins (2004:116) to suggest that the entire late
Paleoindian subperiod may be in many ways âan archeological intermediate or transitional era between the
Early Paleoindian and the Archaic.â
One line of evidence Collins (2004) points to is the temporal continuity of the Angostura dart point and its
variants. This is also supported by data from relatively well-dated open campsites such as the Richard Beene
site (Thoms and Mandel 1992, 2007) and Camp Pearl Wheat (41KR243) (Collins et al. 1990). Towards the
end of the Paleoindian period, the archeological record exhibits clear evidence of diversification in
subsistence patterns and adaptive strategies that mark the beginning of the complex chronological period
referred to as the Archaic.
Archaic Period (8,800-1,250 B.P.)
The Archaic period subsumes two-thirds of the prehistory of Central Texas and is divided into three
subperiods, Early (8500-6000 B.P.), Middle (6000-4000 B.P.), and Late (4000-1200 B.P.). Each of these
subperiods is defined on the basis of distinctive adaptive, environmental, and technological (primarily
projectile point styles) changes.

Johnson et al. (1962) first applied the term "Early Archaic" to early post-Paleoindian sites in Texas, though
it had been used previously in eastern North America to denote the temporal period that followed the
Paleoindian and was contemporaneous with the earlier post-glacial adaptations. The Early Archaic groups
continued to exhibit many of the characteristics of the preceding Paleoindian groups; however, there is clear
evidence of resource intensification that is supported by an increased prevalence of ground stone tools and
the use of heated rocks. Although subsistence data is sparse for this early subperiod, there are indications
that subsistence strategies diversified to include the hunting of a variety of medium and small game animals,
including deer and rabbit, and the gathering of edible roots, nuts, and fruits (Fields 2004; Collins 2004).
Site types include rock shelters, camp sites, lookout sites, and quarry sites that are usually located near a
reliable water source, a large number of which are concentrated along the eastern and southern margins of
the Edwards Plateau (Johnson and Goode 1994).
Most of the projectile points from this subperiod are well made and fall into three style intervals: Angostura
(which exhibits characteristics typical of late Paleoindian technologies), the early split stem point styles,
and the Martindale-Uvalde point styles. Clear Fork and Guadalupe tools (possibly specialized wood
working tools) appear in the archeological record, as do grooved and notched stones (possibly net sinkers)
(Collins 2004; Black and McGraw 1985).
The Middle Archaic subperiod can be subdivided into three projectile point style intervals: Bell-AndiceCalf Creek, Taylor, and Nolan-Travis. The first two style intervals with their thin-bladed, basically
triangular forms, could serve equally well as knives or as the tips of lances, spears, or darts, and reflect a
definite shift in lithic technology (Collins 2004). These bifacial forms are thought to have been added to
the Archaic toolkit as part of specialized bison hunting weaponry that accompanied a more mesic climatic
interval that saw a resurgence of bison in the region (Ricklis and Collins 1994; Johnson and Goode 1994).
During the Middle Archaic subperiod, the number, size, and distribution of sites increased, probably in
response to increasing population density and changes in social organization (Prewitt 1981; Weir 1976).
During this subperiod, large burned rock features became more common (e.g., the Barton Site in Hays
County [Ricklis and Collins 1994]). Burned rock features have also been identified at sites situated on the
marginal Prairie Savanna just east of the escarpment, such as the Bull Pen site (41BP20) (Ensor and
Mueller-Wille 1988). The proliferation of these site types during the Middle Archaic is indicative of the
increased reliance on plant resources and the development of a specialized plant processing economy used
to cook xerophytes such as sotol (Collins 2004; Johnson and Goode 1994).
The later part of the Middle Archaic saw the onset of one of the most xeric climatic intervals ever
experienced by the prehistoric inhabitants of Central Texas. Bison nearly disappear from the archeological
record, and there are notable shifts in subsistence strategies and mobility patterns that would have required
a shift in exploitation zones in order to accommodate the changing patterns of vegetative productivity as
well as related shifts in faunal distribution (see Ellis et al. 1995). These shifts were accompanied by a
number of technological changes that are exemplified in assemblages such as that found at the Wounded
Eye Site (41KR107) and the Shep Site (41KR109), where both Taylor bifaces and Nolan and Travis
projectile points were recovered from small burned rock middens (Luke 1980). These points, with their

17

comparatively thick, narrow blades, are morphologically distinct from their earlier predecessors (Collins
1995, 2004).
The beginning of the Late Archaic period saw a proliferation of new projectile point types (e.g., Bulverde
and Pedernales), but there is a continuation of Middle Archaic subsistence strategies including the continued
use of hot rock technology and their most archeologically recognizable by-productâthe burned rock
midden. Prewitt (1981) has suggested that this proliferation of projectile points may represent a return to
the Early Archaic pattern of small, dispersed bands with wide-ranging territorial areas.
Johnson and Goode (1994) subdivide this late period into two subperiods. The Late Archaic I subperiod
began with the appearance of Bulverde dart points and coincided with a hotter, dryer climate. The Bulverde
dart point type was followed by the appearance of Pedernales points, which may have developed on the
Edwards Plateau, where they are particularly abundant. Subsequent dart point types attributed to the Late
Archaic I subperiod include Lange, Marshall, Montell, and Castroville. The Late Archaic I subperiod
witnessed an increase in population. In easterly portions of Central Texas, burned rock middens reached
their most abundant level, particularly during the time when Pedernales points were in vogue (Collins
2004). It was during this time that the first evidence of contacts between Central Texas peoples and the
Texas coast peoples occurs in the archeological record, as evidenced by the recovery of a conch columella
bead in association with a Marshall dart point at the Loeve-Fox Site (41WM230; Prewitt 1982).
Late Archaic II subperiod begins sometime between 3500 and 2500 B.P., and corresponded to a somewhat
more mesic climate (Johnson and Goode 1994). Along the eastern edges of the Edwards Plateau,
dependence on less abundant xeric vegetation waned and the usage of burned rock middens declined.
Evidence of contacts between peoples living in the eastern part of Central Texas and the Texas coast
increased. Among many sites where marine shell ornaments have been found are the Locke Farm Site
(41CM25) in Comal County, the Pat Parker Site (41TV88) in Travis County, and the Loeve-Fox Site (Bond
1978). Trade of Edwards chert outward from Central Texas also occurred. Johnson and Goode (1994)
believe that this evidence of cross-cultural contacts and trade in ceremonial items reflects religious
movements that were occurring in the eastern United States.
The latter part of this period appears to be marked by an emphasis on the utilization of a wide variety of
food resources, perhaps indicative of population or climatic stress at this time. Burned rock features are
also relatively common. For example at the McKinney Roughs site(41BP627) located on the banks of the
Colorado River in eastern Bastrop County, three discrete Archaic II living surfaces replete with burned rock
cooking features, lithic debris from stone tool making, and food remains were uncovered (Carpenter et al.
2006; TBH 2007). Projectile points diagnostic of the latter part of the Late Archaic include Darl, Ensor,
Frio, and Mahomet point types (Collins 1995, 2004; Carpenter et al. 2006). These point types tend to be
somewhat smaller than those used during the Late Archaic I subperiod, which may reflect a greater reliance
on deer and smaller mammals.
Late Prehistoric Period (1200â300 B.P.)
The basic Late Archaic hunting and gathering lifeways continued into the Late Prehistoric and,
consequently, there is no clear division between the two periods. However, the Late Prehistoric period is
18

marked by several major technological advances. Sometime around 1200 B.P., smaller Scallorn arrow
points make their appearance in Central Texas, indicating the introduction of the bow and arrow, although
dart points still commonly co-occur with Scallorn points during the next 400 years. By about 800 B.P., the
bow and arrow becomes the standard weapon and small, thin Perdiz arrow points become the hallmarks of
the Late Prehistoric period. This shift is accompanied by the introduction of pottery, and an expanded stone
tool assemblage that included long, thin bifaces, end scrapers, and prismatic blades, which is associated
with a new influx of bison into the region. These material culture markers serve as somewhat arbitrary
points of reference for the division of the Late Prehistoric into two subperiods (Collins 1995; 2004; Johnson
and Goode 1994). The early subperiod corresponds to the Austin âphaseâ and the later subperiod
corresponds to the Toyah âphaseâ. These phases are defined on the basis of early work by Kelley (1947),
Jelks (1953), and Suhm (1957).
In his 1947 description of the Lehmann Rockshelter, J. Charles Kelley first identified the Late Prehistoric
period as the Central Texas Aspect. He divided this into the Austin and Toyah foci primarily on the basis
of the presence of Scallorn or Perdiz points, respectively. Explorations at Blum Rockshelter (Jelks 1953),
the Kyle Site (41HI1; Jelks 1962), Smith Rockshelter (41TV42; Suhm 1957), and the Oblate Site (41CM1;
Johnson et al. 1962) in the 1950s and 1960s identified the Austin phase as stratigraphically predating the
Toyah phase. Clear distinction between Austin and Toyah stratigraphy at Blum and Kyle allowed Jelks to
define material culture assemblages unique to each phase. Those artifacts Jelks categorized into the Austin
phase toolkit include Scallorn and Granbury arrow points, some dart points, Friday knives, and serrated
flakes. He included Perdiz and Clifton arrow points, double-pointed and four-edge beveled knives,
Covington knives, small flake drills, snub-nosed end scrapers, pottery, and bison bone as indicators of the
Toyah phase (Jelks 1962).
Although pottery is more commonly associated with Toyah phase assemblages, ceramic assemblages in
east-central Texas are technologically diverse and frequently contain sandy paste ceramics and Caddo
ceramics (Rogers et al. 2013: 249, Table 25). Research indicates that an indigenous ceramic tradition with
ties to the east/southeast existed in these areas by about A.D. 1200â1300 (Rogers 1995:114â116; Rogers et
al. 2013).
Following Jelksâ (1962) definitive work at the Kyle site, minor revisions have been made to his date ranges
and assemblage definitions, and investigations since then have changed few of the original conceptions of
the Late Prehistoric period. In his 1981 summary of Late Prehistoric sites in Central Texas, Prewitt
established date ranges of A.D. 700 to 1300 for the Austin phase and A.D. 1300 to 1750 for the Toyah
phase. Edwards arrow points have also been added to the list of arrow points in the Austin phase
assemblage.
The change from dart points to arrow points is generally accepted as marking the advent of the Austin
phase, when the prevalence of dart points gradually gives way to two technologically distinct arrow point
styles, Scallorn and Edwards. While the bow and arrow would likely have increased a hunterâs efficiency,
there is little evidence that subsistence practices changed significantly in Central Texas during the Austin
phase, as there is evidence from the western and southern Central Texas sites that burned rock middens
continue throughout the Late Prehistoric period (Black et al. 1997). This period also seems to have been

19

accompanied by an increase in hostilities, as witnessed by a number of burials in which arrow points were
the apparent cause of death (Prewitt 1982: Table 4; Rogers 2000).
Several excavations have shed additional light on the lifestyles of the Austin phase peoples. The Sheppard
Site (41WM1010), near the junction of the Edwards Plateau and Blackland Prairie in Williamson County,
yielded evidence of short-term encampments containing numerous stone-lined hearths and abundant faunal
remains, including bison (Dixon et al. 2003). A preliminary report of recent excavations at the J. B. White
Site (41MM341), along the Little River in Milam County, indicates that the site was visited by Austin phase
peoples who left a considerable amount of subsistence refuse, and the site also contains evidence of an
ephemeral Toyah occupation (Gadus et al. 2006).
The origins of the succeeding Toyah phase remain controversial, with the controversy centered on whether
Toyah represents an intrusion or migration of people into the region, or the spread of a successful toolkit,
composed of blade flake production (as opposed to the bifacial core reduction of the preceding Austin
phase) of Perdiz arrow points, Harahey knives, large flake/blade end scrapers, beveled knives, flake
perforators, and arrow-shaft abraders. The former concept is championed by Johnson (1994), though he
feels it unlikely that Toyah culture sensu lato was originally possessed over its entire geographic range by
one ethnic group. Johnson refers to a Classic Toyah culture, which included distinctive pottery. He views
this culture as arriving in Central and South Texas with outlanders who were in pursuit of bison, which had
made their appearance after several centuries of absence. Johnsonâs main argument against Toyah being an
in situ development in Central Texas through the melding of tools and associated behaviors is that the Toyah
phenomenon appears throughout much of its geographic sphere seemingly at the same time.
Bastrop County History
The first permanent European settlement in present-day Bastrop County was Fort Puesta del Colorado,
located at the Colorado River crossing where the town of Bastrop now stands (Moore 1977). Little is known
about the fort except that its purpose was to protect commerce on the El Camino Real, which ran from San
Antonio to Nacogdoches (Moore 1977; Marks 2013). The Baron de Bastrop had planned a German
community at the site; however, it was not until 1827 when Stephen F. Austin received a grant from the
Mexican Government for the âLittle Colonyâ that settlement truly began in the area. In 1831, Austin
received a second grant, and together the land was known as the Mina Municipality by 1834, which
comprised 16 present-day counties including the majority of Bastrop County. When Texas became a
republic in 1836, the Mina Municipality was one of 23 original colonies in Texas. In 1837, the Congress of
the Republic of Texas changed the county name to Bastrop to honor the baron, and the town of Mina was
renamed Bastrop as well. The Congress also whittled away the boundaries of the large county to form other
counties, including Travis County to the west, and by 1840 Bastrop County was close to its present shape
(Marks 2013).
The majority of initial settlers to the county was from Austinâs original colony and practiced small-scale
farming in the southern portion of the county near the Colorado River and the nascent town of Bastrop.
Change came in 1837, which marked the first year that African slaves were brought to the county by their
owners, the majority of whom were emigrants from the southern states (Marks 2013 and Kesselus 1987).
This also marked the beginning of the new cotton industry and plantation economy in the county. Bastrop
20

Three Oaks Mine, Bastrop County, Texas

County was never a leader in cotton production; however, it was considered the most important cash crop
for the county during the next 50 years (Marks 2013). Large plantations were soon established along the
fertile land surrounding the Colorado River, and the population of both free white settlers and slave laborers
steadily increased. In 1847, the white population of the county was recorded at 1,273, and the slave
population at 527. By 1850 the total county population had jumped to 2,180, of which 919 were slaves.
This trend continued and by 1860 white residents of the county numbered 4,415, and the slave population
numbered 2,591. While most (71 percent) slaveholders operated small farms, the remaining 29 percent in
1860 were large plantation owners who held over 75 percent of the slave population (Kesselus 1987).
With an increasing population of both whites and enslaved peoples, agricultural production rose
significantly as well. In 1858, 7,880 acres in the county were recorded as in use for agricultural purposes;
two years later, the acreage had increased to over 38,000 acres. The bulk of this land was devoted to corn
and cotton production. As expected, almost 75 percent of the population of the county resided in rural
farming communities, and most were located in the southern two-thirds of the county (Kesselus 1987).
The homogeneity of the southern character of the county began to breakdown in the 1850s with an influx
of German immigrants. Prior to this time, the vast majority of white residents were from the American
South. The 1850 Census enumerated 159 native Germans who represented seven percent of the county
population. Only one was recorded as a slaveholder, likely because the majority of Germans were
philosophically opposed to the institution of slavery. By the early 1860s, native Germans and their
American-born children accounted for over 20 percent of the countyâs population (Kesselus 1987).
Despite the fact that the county possessed a large slave population that supported a growing cotton
economy, Bastrop County residents voted 352 to 335 against secession in 1861 (Marks 2013). This was
due in part to the increasing German population, who aside from their opposition to slavery, many had left
their homeland to escape war and military service (Marks 2013). However, the close vote meant that many
residents were Confederate sympathizers, and the county supported the war effort by arming and equipping
military companies (Marks 2013).
The Confederacyâs defeat in the Civil War and the emancipation of slaves changed nearly every aspect of
the political, social, and economic climate within Bastrop County. Integration of the large population of
formerly enslaved peoples as full citizens gave rise to conflict in the county and the South in general. ExConfederates and former slaveholders allied themselves with the Democratic Party in an attempt to maintain
much of the former antebellum status quo, while Unionists (mainly African Americans and Germans) sided
with the Republican Party, which sought radical reform. At the end of the war, the free African American
population comprised 40 percent, Germans comprised 15 percent, native born Whites made up 35 percent,
and other ethnicities accounted for the remaining 10 percent of the county population (Kesselus 2011).
Included in this population were planters (former slaveholders), many white small-farm owners, a few white
businessmen, and laborers, who accounted for virtually the entire black population who were dependent on
whites for work.
While the majority of newly emancipated African Americans remained on rural properties owned by whites,
a number relocated to Bastrop and others became landowners (Kesselus 2011). The majority of these new

black landowners resided in freedmenâs settlements, which were scattered, informal communities of black
farmers and stockmen. The settlements were unincorporated communities usually formed around a church
and school and situated in pockets of cheap, neglected land; however, some were situated near former large
plantations. Several freedmenâs communities were located in Bastrop County, many of which were located
in the southern two-thirds of the county. Some of these settlements included Alum Creek, Cedar Creek,
Craftâs Prairie, and Pleasant Grove (Sitton and Conrad 2005).
The Freedmenâs Bureau was active in the county from 1865 to 1870 and was charged with providing relief
to, and defending the civil rights of, freed slaves. With the help and protection of the Freedmenâs Bureau
during the time of Reconstruction (1865-1874), African Americans began to enjoy some of the same rights
as their white counterparts, such as voting, holding county and state offices, owning land, and being paid
for their work. However, many whites were fearful of and angry over the African Americansâ new-found
freedom and rights, sparking legislation such as the 1866 Texas labor laws or âBlack Codesâ which heavily
favored white landowners and essentially allowed harsh treatment of black laborers (Kesselus 2011). The
majority of negative white reaction was unofficial and ranged from intimidation, to raids on black homes,
to lynching. By 1874, with the withdrawal of Federal Soldiers and the Freedmenâs Bureau and the end of
Republican Control of the county, the advance of freedmen began to wane (Kesselus 2011). It was during
this time that the Ku Klux Klan was very active in Bastrop County, which made daily life for African
Americans difficult to dangerous, and some left the county altogether (Kesselus 2011).
By 1870 the county population topped 11,000, and it had 34 manufacturing establishments, which included
multiple gins, sawmills, gristmills, and a wool factory in Bastrop. By the 1880s additional factories,
including those that manufactured brooms, iron, bricks, and pottery, were established within the county.
The first railroad in the county, the Houston and Texas Central Railway, was extended across the northern
portion of the county in 1871 to connect Austin to Brenham. Prior to its construction, Bastrop was the
countyâs sole populous town, and only small rural settlements dotted the county. However, with the railroad
came small communities that formed around railroad stops. These included the towns of McDade, Paige,
and Elgin (which was the most substantial). The railroad also lessened the distance needed to haul cotton,
timber, corn, and other products of the county by wagon (Marks 2013).
In 1874, Lee County was established and incorporated the mostly German, northern portions of Bastrop
County. Additional railroads were built through the county in the 1880s and 1890s, including the Taylor,
Bastrop and Houston Railway through Smithville and Bastrop. The Missouri-Kansas-Texas Company
(MKT) built a line through the southern part of the county in 1894, and the towns of Rosanky and Red Rock
developed along the line (Texas Historic Records Survey 1941). The MKT moved its central shops to
Smithville at this time, and the town doubled in size, becoming the largest in the county (Marks 2013). At
the turn of the century, the county was still primarily agricultural with over 3,500 farms and a population
of almost 27,000 residents. Change came to the county in 1913 with the discovery of oil and later years of
testing and drilling at various sites. However, most locations like the one near Cedar Creek were described
as productive but unspectacular, and the industry never took off like it did in other counties (Marks 2013).
Lignite mining proved to be a much more lucrative industry within the county. In 1926 there were nine
mining companies north of Bastrop, but by 1941 only two were producing coal (Texas Historic Records
Survey 1941).

The 1920s also brought changes to the Bastrop County agriculture industry. Cotton, followed by corn,
continued to be the biggest cash crops in the county. However, a farm depression that began in 1920 forced
changes in land use and diversification in agriculture and increased cattle production. The Great Depression
followed in the 1930s, and the number of farms in the county decreased from 3,325 in 1920 to 2,473 in
1940 and farm value dropped from $17 million to just over $7 million. Many residents reacted by leaving
the county, and the population decreased from 26,649 in 1920 to 21,610 in 1940. A brief economic upswing
to the county came during World War II. Cattle production increased and the economy of several
communities improved with the establishment of Camp Swift, an army training facility in the north-central
part of the county. The upsurge was short-lived, and many residents left the county during the war. Camp
Swift was phased out, the coal mines were closed, and lumbering exhausted the remaining commercial
timber.
Cotton cultivation was one-sixth its 1920 acreage at the end of the war. However, farmers had begun to
successfully diversify, and sorghum, watermelons, peanuts, and pecans became staple cash crops of the
county. By 1950, the emphasis on agriculture had shifted to beef-cattle raising, and more land was set aside
for pasture. While agriculture diversified, manufacturing became more focused, most notably on brick and
tile. Three plants were operating in Elgin by 1950.
The Three Oaks Permit Area
While the majority of Stephen F. Austinâs colonizers and later settlers took up residency in the southern
portion of Bastrop County near the Colorado River and its many tributaries, the northern portion of the
county remained largely unpopulated until after the Civil War. The Three Oaks Permit Area and its
surrounding vicinity were originally large land grants that were eventually divided into smaller parcels and
developed and farmed by individual families. Unlike central and southern Bastrop County, very few large
plantations were located in the region. Instead, the loosely organized agrarian communities formed around
churches and schools that were built on land donated by local farmers. These settlements appear to be
situated around churches and include Anglo, German, and later African American landowners.
During the previous intensive survey of the Three Oaks Permit Area in Lee and Bastrop Counties (Turpin
2003), 120 historic sites were identified and included cemeteries, schools, industrial facilities, and
farmsteads. Included in this number were the locations of 105 dwellings; according to archival research
conducted by Turpin, they appear to have been built between 1855 and 1946, and the majority represented
the homes of post-Civil War southern emigrants to the region. Of the sites that represented dwellings, 26
were extant at the time of survey. Five historic sites were attributed to the 1850s and 1860s and include the
W. W. Beatty family homestead (41BP630), the German immigrant family Bretnersâ homesite (41BP572),
the homesite attributed to Peter Kellermeier at 41BP585, and three additional sites to the north in Lee
County. Turpin points out that several recorded cemeteries within the survey area contained marked
internments dating from the 1860s, which indicates that several communities or families were living in the
area by that time (Turpin 2003).
Nine of the recorded house sites were attributed to the 1870s, and the first known burials within the Three
OaksâGoerlitz and Adina cemeteriesâoccurred during this time. In addition, the initial prospecting for the
Mowatt Lignite Mine began during this decade. Three sites were recorded just across the county line in Lee

County and include a tenant house (41LE308), T. J. Walkersâ homestead (41LE87), and J. C. Carterâs home
(41LE277), located near the community of Blue. Sites recorded in Bastrop County that are thought to date
to the 1870s include historic scatters that represent the A. B. Davidson (41BP272) and the Felix McLemore
(41BP550) homesteads. The extant Alf Shepard home (41BP202), which consists of a frame dwelling with
a log house core, was also thought to date to the 1870s. Turpin also recorded the site of the Wright Parmer
homestead (41BP582). Parmer is listed as a freedman in a deed when he purchased the property from A. C.
Cooper in 1872, and members of his family remained in the area until 1916. Turpin attributes Parmer and
his family as the only Black presence in the permit area in 1872; however, current research has revealed
that Jeff Tinnen, also a freedman, purchased the adjacent property (which contains 41BP594) from Cooper
that same day. He remained on the property until he conveyed it John Kellermeier in 1884 (Turpin 2003).
Turpin attributed a large wave of home construction in the 1880s partly to an increase in German
immigration and the founding of Hudlerâs gin, which provided work for the surrounding community
(including the Wright Parmer family). By the 1890s the Mowatt Lignite Mine was operating at a peak, and
housing for many workers was constructed near the shaft. Rural building appears to have decreased in the
early twentieth century, while industrial and educational building increased. Schools included the third
incarnation of the Mount Pleasant School (41BP546) and the Mount Rose or Chocolate School (41BP602).
During this time the Elgin Butler Brick Company (41BP602) moved its headquarters to the current location.
Other large industries within the county included lumber production, though it appears to have been
centered near the town of Bastrop, where the large pine trees were situated. The beginning of the lumber
industry in the county is marked as 1838 with the operation of the Bastrop Steam Mill Company. Bastrop
quickly became the supply source of lumbered pine in Central Texas, including what was used to construct
the first state Capital and the French Legation building.
Log Houses in Central Texas
The information in the following section was adapted from Terry G. Jordanâs Texas Log Building: A Folk
Architecture (Jordan 1978)
The vast majority of log houses in Texas were influenced by emigrants to Texas from the Lower South of
the U.S. Gulf Coastal Plains and Upper South and not directly influenced by European immigrants, as most
European immigrants hailed from areas of Europe where log construction was not the primary building
technique. Exceptions to this pattern include areas of Medina County and Fredericksburg. Many emigrants
to Texas during the early to mid-nineteenth century were by then mostly of mixed European ancestry and
had absorbed log structure construction techniques that were derived from the Pennsylvania Dutch
(immigrants from Sudetenland, Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, and Slovakia). Additionally, AfricanAmericans acquired log building techniques while enslaved, and thus log structures were also constructed
by black Texans before and after the Civil War. Log structure construction in Texas was for the most part
confined to North-Central, Central, and East Texas due to the diminishing size and frequency of trees in
the west, north, and southernmost parts of Texas. In general, Central and North Texas were populated by
emigrants from the Upper South, while emigrants from the Lower South settled mostly in East Texas. The
confluence of these two areas was made up of a mixture of both populations. Though both groups acquired
knowledge of log culture complex from the same source, over time, log structures differed between the two

groups. Other factors for varied development in Texas log architecture include the lumber type, climate,
level of craftsmanship, and economic status.
In Central and North Texas, the predominant tree types used in log construction were oak and cedar, while
the abundant pines of East Texas were used almost exclusively as building materials in that region of the
state. Tree type and size also influenced room size of the buildings. On average, North and Central Texas
houses were smaller than those located in East Texas, which used tall pines that afforded larger rooms.
Climate and weather likely influenced the popularity of floor plan type. For instance, open passageway or
âdogtrotâ plans were more popular in hot and humid East Texas than in North Texas. Another variable was
the builderâs level of craftsmanship. While some buildings were constructed during communal âlog
rollingsâ by amateur laborers, the majority of log houses (and the majority that survive today) were
constructed by professional or semi-professional carpenters working for hire. Some of these craftsmen
during the antebellum years were black slaves who traveled with their owners as carpenters or were rented
out by slaveowners during log house construction. Additionally, economic status was another factor that
influenced architecture, especially house construction. A richer manâs house presumably would be larger,
of better construction, and more likely to be covered with siding sooner after construction than a poorer
manâs house.
Log dwellings can be divided into two types: cabins and houses. A log cabin was usually a small,
windowless, first-generation dwelling, built by amateurs, with crudely notched logs with the bark left intact.
Cabins had dirt floors and, if present, chimneys were made of mud and sticks. Most cabins were occupied
for just a few years before being replaced or demoted to outbuilding status and used as a barn or
smokehouse. The majority of slave dwellings were log cabins. In contrast, a log house was a secondgeneration dwelling usually built by a carpenter with carefully hewn timbers that were tightly chinked, had
a window or two, wood flooring, and a more permanent chimney of stone or brick.
Though each log dwelling was unique, they shared many common construction attributes. Typically they
were situated in a well-drained location near a road or path and faced south to allow the summer breeze to
ventilate the structure. Documented log house floorplans in Texas include single-pen, double-pen, dogtrot,
triple-pen and four-pen. Often the floorplan underwent alterations and became more elaborate through time
and as family size increased. The single-pen log house is the most common form of the dwelling in the
interior portions of Texas and was less common in East Texas. Single-pen log dwellings may suggest a
lower socioeconomic status. The majority of single-pen log houses (like 41BP594) had a side-facing gable
and a chimney centered in one of the gabled ends.
Central Texas log houses were usually supported on flat field stone piers, and less commonly on wood
piers, and were low to the ground. In contrast, dwellings found in East Texas generally had tall foundations
of brick or log, which elevated the structure higher off of the ground to increase ventilation and to deter
termites. Sill logs, which rest directly on the foundation stones or piers, were more substantial than the logs
used for the walls and were hewn on all sides resulting in a square beam. They were placed on the eave
sides of the structure and bear the entire weight of the building. For structures with a planned wooden floor,
sills were mortised on the top side, and floor joists or sleepers (which supported the floor boards) were lapjointed into the sills. Two additional logs were then placed parallel to the sills and notched into the joists

below. Walls were raised by adding two more logs on parallel sides, each notched into the log below until
the wall attained the desired height. At the top of the wall, two plate logs rested below the eaves to support
the rafters; like sills, they were larger than wall logs.
Wall logs were prepared prior to placement. They were generally hewed (with an axe) on the two sides that
form the wall; the top and bottom sides were left untouched so that the chinking material could have a rough
surface to adhere to. Hewing suggests that the preparer was more skilled. Aside from displaying a finished
surface, a hewn wall could more easily be made tight against the weather and allowed for cladding to rest
against the surface at a later date. Once the wall was fully raised, openings were cut for doors, windows,
and a fireplace gap. Once the sawing was complete, the openings were framed with rived boards to stabilize
the cut boards.
The vast majority of log walls in Texas were erected such that individual logs did not rest against each
other, and a gap or âchinkâ larger than an inch remained between two logs. Chinks provided room for
subsequent warping of the logs after construction, as many dwellings were built with unseasoned wood;
chinks also allowed for the natural taper of logs. This gap between logs was covered or filled with a variety
of material, which can provide clues relevant to the origins of the builder. In the American Deep South, the
chinks were often covered horizontally with rived âsealing boardsâ on the inside and occasionally on the
outside. As such, this is the dominant type of chinking found in East Texas which was settled largely by
emigrants from the Deep South. In contrast, chinking in North and Central Texas generally consisted of
fillers, which was a more common chinking method used by settlers from the Upper South. Fillers included
thin slats of wood and small flat rocks wedged into the chink. The filler was then daubed both inside and
out to form a tight weatherproof wall. Daubing materials differed regionally, depending mainly upon locally
available resources. In areas where limestone was prevalent, a lime mortar was usually employed, and often
wood ashes and occasionally salt was added. Clay mixed with material such as animal hair, moss, or straw
was used in areas without limestone. In the absence of both, mud was used to fill the gaps.
The key element in log construction is the corner notch, the corner joint where logs from perpendicular
walls are attached to one another. Apart from the sills, the corners support the entire lateral and dead loads
of the building and prevent horizontal slippage. The majority of notching was performed on the ground
using an axe or saw, and the final exact fitting was performed once the log was in place on the wall. In
Texas, eight distinct notch types are found, with four dominant styles (half-dovetail notch, âVâ notch,
saddle notch, and square notch) and four less common types (full dovetail notch, semi-lunate notch, double
notch, and half notch). The most prevalent notching style (with a concentration in North and Central Texas)
is the half dove-tail, which is splayed on the top of the tongue of the log and forms a strong, locked joint.
The âVâ notch is an inverted V-shaped joint that forms a locked joint and was prevalent in the interior
central and northern portions of the state. The saddle notch is likely the oldest notch type and is found on
logs that are left round and not hewn. It is formed by scooping out a saddle-shaped depression to form a
locked joint. This notch was most common in East Texas and is the dominant notch found on twentieth
century log homes. The square notch consists of just right angles and requires less skill to fashion. As the
notch does not form a joint, pegs or nails must be used to secure the joint. This type of notch was the most
common form in Texas and is found in Central-east and East Texas.

Three Oaks Mine, Bastrop County, Texas

The full dovetail notch is fairly uncommon in Texas, though it is a joint of superior strength because both
the top and bottom of the tongue of the log are splayed. The semi-lunate notch is almost always applied to
half-round pine logs and found mostly in East Texas. It resembles a half of a saddle notch. The double
notch is also fairly rare in Texas and is simply a saddle notch with a square-shaped saddle and forms a
solidly locked joint. The half notch is the simplest of all forms because the builder had to remove only one
square of wood from the bottom corners of each log. Like the square notch, pegging or nails are required
to secure the half notch corner in place since it is an unlocked joint as well. This joint is rare in Texas, and
many square-notched structures feature occasional half-notched joints to rectify minor misfits in the wall.
Regional and temporal differences can also be observed in flooring, roofing, and chimneys of log houses.
Prior to access to milled lumber for flooring, log houses with flooring used puncheons, short, thick, rived
boards that reached from one floor joist to the next; the length was determined by the spacing of the joists,
usually about 2 feet. A step above was a hand-sawn plank floor. Access to milled lumber provided a more
stable and aesthetically pleasing floor. Several types of log house roofs are found in Texas, including
âridgepole-and-purlin,â âridgepole-and-rafter,â and the non-ridgepole roof. By far, the dominant roof
construction method in Texas is characterized by the absence of a ridgepole. These roofs had lap-jointed or
mortised hewn or pole rafters on opposite slopes, with long slats affixed to them for stability. Vertical studs
provided additional support on the gabled end and usually formed a 45-degree pitch. Early roof material
was generally in the form of rived clapboard and was usually later replaced by shakes or shingles. Log
house chimneys were almost always situated exterior to the structure on a gabled end and were constructed
from a variety of materials including stick, dirt, and masonry. Though masonry chimneys sometimes
replaced an initial stick and dirt chimney, most often stone or brick chimneys were original to the house.
They were normally built freestanding, about 6 inches from the wall to keep unwanted heat out of the house
and lessen the fire danger. After the Civil War, the majority of log houses were constructed without
chimneys in favor of wood burning, cast iron stoves. Additionally, a large number of existing chimneys
were removed in older dwellings, and the chimney gap was boarded over.
Log houses could be enlarged by several means, and this usually occurred as a process that unfolded over
time. Many log houses were built with a porch, or one was added later. The majority of porches were
situated in the front of the house and were full length with a roof attached a foot or two below the eaves.
Shed rooms (typically one-half to two-thirds the width of the pen) were added to the back of the house with
the roof attached to the main roof at the eaves, forming a break in profile. They were generally of frame
construction due to the difficultly of attaching a new log structure to an existing one and because they were
usually built at a later time period when there was access to milled lumber.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
NRHP testing at prehistoric site 41BP595 was undertaken following a research design (Sherman and
Frederick 2013) previously submitted to the THC. Research at the two historic sites (41BP585 and
41BP594) sought first to determine if significant archeological deposits were preserved and if behaviorally
meaningful patterns of discard could be discerned. This was accomplished through implementation of an
intensive systematic program of shovel testing augmented by limited hand excavation in units. Additionally,
archival research was undertaken to identify the historic occupants of the properties containing the two
historic sites and to determine whether they were associated with significant events, themes, or patterns of
historic development.
ARCHIVAL RESEARCH, SITES 41BP585 AND 41BP594
Prior to the present investigation, the standing structure at site 41BP594 was determined to be eligible for
NRHP inclusion as part of a rural historic district (Penick 2001) and potentially under Criterion D (Martin
2001). The eligibility status of site 41BP585 remains undetermined (Martin 2002). Of particular interest to
the THC was whether either site was occupied during the 1850s to the 1870s (Martin 2001).
To supplement the limited archival research that was conducted earlier for both properties (Turpin 2003),
the current research effort involved detailed consultation of online Texas General Land Office records and
chain of title research at the Bastrop County courthouse in Bastrop, Texas, including review of deed,
probate, and other vital records.
After determining the general timeline for development and occupation of the properties, the historian
supplemented the chain of title data with Ad Valorem tax research at the Texas State Library in Austin,
with the aim to determine when the properties were occupied and how they were used. The historian also
consulted the population census rolls, which provided information such as county of residence at the time
of enumeration, race, family size, and occupation. Limited secondary source research was conducted to
develop a brief historic background for development in the region and included The Handbook of Texas
Online, Turpin (2003), and several books concerning the development and history of Bastrop County.
PREHISTORIC RESEARCH OBJECTIVES, SITE 41BP595
An intensive program of shovel testing at 41BP595 (Sherman and Frederick 2013) isolated three sub-site
areas, referred to as areas 1, 2, and 3. This work also identified a buried, organically enriched soil deposit
in the southern half of Area 2. Research at 41BP595 sought to address several important questions
concerning the origins of these deposits such as: what types of resources were processed in each area? When
did the sub-site areas arise? Are interpretable cultural features with preserved remains suitable for
radiocarbon dating present? Can use ware analysis of the ground and chipped stone tool assemblages be
used to determine the types of materials processed on site? What are the origins of the organically rich soil
deposit located in the southern half of site Area 2 and how was it buried?

Cultural Affiliation
Prior to the present investigation, no temporally sensitive artifacts had been recovered from site 41BP595,
and its cultural affiliation remained uncertain. An important goal of testing was to recover temporally
sensitive artifacts and charred subsistence/spent fuel remains suitable for radiocarbon analysis. Testing
yielded several temporally diagnostic projectile points that suggest the site was occupied repeatedly from
the Late Paleoindian to the Late Prehistoric periods. Radiocarbon analysis was performed on eight burned
nut shells recovered from feature contexts and returned dates ranging from 1110 B.C. to A.D. 1150. The
site appears to have been most heavily utilized during the period extending from the Late Archaic II to the
early part of the Late Prehistoric period or Austin Phase.
Settlement/Subsistence
The present investigation identified a wide range of cultural features on site, including large burned rock
cooking facilities, small cooking surfaces, and disarticulated burned rock features. An expansive buried
anthrogenic A soil horizon, first identified in shovel tests, was sampled with hand-excavated units and
backhoe trenches. Flotation of soil samples taken from the buried anthrogenic soil, and from burned rock
features, recovered spent fuel remains and burned subsistence remains.
The artifact assemblage recovered from 41BP595 expressed limited diversity. The assemblage of flaked
lithic tools included 36 specimens representing five tool types: projectile point, biface, utilized flake,
uniface, and scraper. The assemblage of ground stone tools was much larger and included 114 specimens.
The ratio of chipped to ground stone tools was 0.32. These patterns suggest the site resulted from a limited
range of activities that were more focused on grinding activities than cutting activities. Site 41BP595 is
thought to have resulted from activities largely associated with subsistence processing. Based on the results
of macrobotanical, starch, phytolith, and residue analysis, the burned rock features appear to have resulted
in part from processing tubers, bulbs, and nuts.
Spatial Patterning
The distribution of cultural materials across the site suggests the presence of three sub-site areas. Additional
investigation within each site area sought to evaluate the structure (the distribution of feature types, artifacts,
and other cultural materials) of each area in order to place these within a chronological framework and
assess their function. Radiocarbon dates returned from samples recovered from sub-site areas 1 and 2,
coupled with the assemblage of temporally sensitive lithic artifacts recovered from these areas, indicate that
each of the sub-site areas resulted from multiple occupational episodes widely separated in time.
The buried anthrogenic soil horizon was limited to a roughly 55 m east/west by 22 m north/south area
limited to the southern half of sub-site area 2. Radiocarbon dates returned from samples recovered from the
anthrogenic soil deposit suggest it arose during a period potentially extending from 800 B.C. to A.D. 1030.
Three of the four radiocarbon dates returned from charcoal samples recovered from burned rock features
were encompassed by this date range. The charcoal sample recovered from Feature 29, cluster 1, in contrast,
returned a date that precedes this range by at least 200 years.

Geoarcheological Investigation
A geoarcheological investigation was undertaken to determine the origin and burial mechanism of the
organic-rich deposit in Area 2. There are several possible scenarios that can explain this deposit: 1) an
ancient gully fill; 2) gleyed sediment on top of the argillic horizon; 3) an ancient anthrogenic deposit (or
midden); 4) historic burn/bulldozer push feature. Although other scenarios exist, these are considered the
most likely at this time and are amenable to geoarcheological examination and testing. The results of this
investigation suggest that the organic-rich soil deposit has ancient anthrogenic origins and was buried via
Aeolian deposition.
Excavation Methods
Backhoe Trenching
Each sub-site area defined through shovel testing was sampled with a series of backhoe trenches excavated
at approximate 20 m intervals. Four trenches were excavated within and around Area 1, 12 trenches were
excavated within and around Area 2, and four trenches were excavated within and around Area 3. A total
of 32 cultural features were exposed during trenching.
Hand Excavation
A representative sample, consisting of 17 of the 32 cultural features exposed with the aid of mechanical
excavation, was sampled through hand excavation.
Special Studies
Based on the context of recovery, some of the burned rocks encountered in intact features might have been
directly exposed to food during cooking. The six best candidates, those rocks that were considered to
possess the highest probability of having been directly exposed to food during cooking based on their
context of recovery, were subjected to special studies including phytolith, starch, and Fourier Transform
Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses, in an attempt to determine what was cooked with the thermally
altered rock. The rocks chosen for this analysis had a flat upward facing surface and were exposed on the
tops of features.
All of the samples that were chosen were recovered from intact, or largely intact, burned rock features. The
rocks chosen for analysis were selected from the top layer of feature rocks. Rocks that had a flat up-facing
surface when exposed were chosen, if present. Burned rocks from features 1, 15, 21, 23, and 29 (clusters 1
and 3) were submitted to Paleo Research Institute, Inc. for analysis. Phytolith analysis identified an
environmental signature from the grasses that grew in all of the features post-abandonment. Phytolith
analysis also indicated that seeds might have been processed in features 1 and 23, or fortuitously
deteriorated in the features. Similarly, hackberry seed phytoliths were recovered from Cluster 3 in Feature
29, which could represent subsistence processing or a fortuitous inclusion. Starch analysis revealed the
presence of globular eccentric starches and globular centric starches from either grass seeds or tubers that
presumably resulted from subsistence processing. All three of the features that yielded starch also included

30

Three Oaks Mine, Bastrop County, Texas

sub-angular to angular starches with eccentric hila that are consistent with processing roots/tubers. These
three features also yielded Sagittaria-type root/tuber starches, which is indicative of cooking wapato tubers.
Radiocarbon Dating
Eight radiocarbon samples, recovered from feature contexts, were submitted to Beta Analytic for analysis.
The calibrated two sigma data ranges returned from these samples suggest the features sampled on site
arose during the period extending from 1110 B.C. to A.D. 1150.
Macrobotanical Analysis
A total of 30 soil samples retained from feature fill were submitted to Macrobotanical Analysis for flotation
and identification of the recovered botanical remains. This effort recovered spent fuel remains (including
oak and hickory charcoal) and subsistence remains (including charred hickory and walnut shells and a
charred bulb fragment.
FIELD METHODS
Horizontal Control
A grid was established at each site using a 60-m tape and a hand-held sighting compass. The grids at historic
sites 41BP585 and 41BP594 were oriented with the standing structure or structural remains. The grid at
prehistoric site 41BP595 was aligned with magnetic north. The locations of each shovel test were acquired
using a Trimble GeoXT GPS device that, with post-processing, is typically accurate to within 2 m.
At 41BP595 an alpha datum was established and all hand-excavated units, backhoe trenches, cultural
features, as well as all back sites, were tied to it with a total station. A permanent site datum and a permanent
back site were established, using galvanized steel spikes set into concrete, along the southwestern limits of
the site and shot in with the total station. The positions of the permanent datum, the alpha datum, along
with all of the back sites, were also acquired with the GPS device.
Shovel Testing
At prehistoric site 41BP595, 150 shovel tests were excavated in two phases. Initially, shovel tests were
excavated at 20 m across the site to assess the clinal variation of cultural materials across the site and
determine if culturally meaningful patterns of discard have been preserved on site, such as artifact high
density and diversity areas and cultural features. During the second phase, shovel tests were excavated at
10-m grid intercepts within areas of high artifact density and around possible cultural features. Three subsite areas were identified and are referred to as areas 1, 2, and 3. Historic sites 41BP585 and 41BP594 were
shovel tested at 5-m grid intercepts in the immediate vicinity of standing architecture or structural remains
and at 10-m intercepts in the site areas beyond the immediate vicinity of those remains.
Trenching
Twenty backhoe trenches were excavated at site 41BP595 in an effort to locate cultural features within subsite areas 1, 2, and 3. This effort exposed 30 burned rock features (features 1-3, 5- 29, 32, and 33) and one

rock concentration (Feature 4) whose origins appear to be largely natural. The buried anthrogenic A soil
horizon first identified during shovel testing was exposed in Trenches 1, 6, 7, and 8 and designated as
Feature 30. A portion of one additional burned rock feature (Feature 31) was exposed in a hand-excavated
unit (5) used to sample the deposits adjacent to Feature 29.
Once identified in a backhoe trench, the portion of each burned rock feature present within the trench was
fully exposed in plan using hand tools (trowels and brushes). Once fully exposed, each feature was
photographed and then tied to the site grid with the total station.

FEATURE AND UNIT EXCAVATION
A representative selection of the burned rock features identified on site (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 15, 16, 19, 20, 21, 23,
25, 26, 27, 29, 31, and 32), along with the concentration of unburned rocks (Feature 4), was selected for
sampling through hand excavation. The anthrogenic soil deposit or midden feature (30) was drawn in
profile, as expressed in the walls of trenches 6, 7 and 8, and then sampled with two 50 cm x 50 cm units
(units 1 and 2) that were excavated off of trenches 7 and 8. A total of 11 features (7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,
14, 17, 18, and 28) were photographed and reburied but were not sampled. Three features (22, 24, and 33)
were photographed, sketched, and reburied but not sampled.
The limits of all features that were sampled through hand excavation were first fully exposed and the feature
rocks were pedestalled. In hand-excavated units used to sample features, the sediment removed from the
features was screened separately from the rest of the level. All sediment removed from each feature was
screened using Â¼ inch mesh, with the exception of sediment retained for flotation. All artifacts recovered
in the Â¼ inch mesh were retained and bagged by feature. Thermally altered rock was categorized by raw
material, weighed using a bucket scale, and discarded in the field. Thermally altered ground stone artifacts
recovered in association with burned rock features were categorized by material, weighed, and retained.
Each of the burned rock features selected for hand excavation was drawn in plan. Complex features, and
large features thought to represent intact cooking facilities were bisected along a line crossing near the
featureâs center, and then drawn and photographed in profile. Lines of bisection were established with
wooden stakes connected by level string lines and tied to the site grid with the total station. Flotation
samples were retained from all of the excavated features that appeared to represent intact cooking facilities
(1, 5, 15, 19, 21, 23, 26, 27, 29, and 32). One flotation sample was retained from each 10-cm level excavated
in units 1 and 2 where Feature 30, the anthrogenic soil horizon, was encountered.
In addition to the two 50 cm x 50 cm hand-excavated units used to sample Feature 30, six additional handexcavated units, ranging in size from 50 cm x 50 cm to 1 m x 1.25 m, were used to sample the deposits
adjacent to six features. All of the units excavated on site were excavated off of backhoe trenches; the odd
unit size was employed as a matter of expediency. The larger units (those larger than 1 m x 50 cm) were
initially established as 1 m x 1 m units parallel to and about 20 cm away from the trench walls. Once the
unit walls were cut to the bottom of the first level, the unit was then extended to the trench. This method
was utilized in order to reduce the risk of wall failure and to make it easier to maintain squared unit walls.

LABORATORY METHODS
All recovered cultural materials were returned to the Archeological Laboratory at Atkins for processing
preparatory to analysis. Following analysis and washing, all cultural materials were returned to B&A.
Nonorganic remains were washed, dried, and catalogued by provenience. Once this report of investigations
is finalized, B&A intends to curate only temporally/culturally diagnostic artifacts. The Anthropology and
Archaeology Laboratory (AAL) at Stephen F. Austin Unisversity in Nacogdoches, Texas, is expected to be
the curation repository.
Prehistoric Materials
All lithic artifacts were classified as either tools or nontools as well as by raw material type and, where
possible, origin. Nontools were categorized as debitage, fire-cracked rock, or ground stone. The assemblage
of lithic debitage was subcategorized by morphology into complete flake, broken flake, flake fragment, and
debris.
The assemblage of lithic tools was examined under low-power microscopy in order to identify patterns of
use wear. Morphological characteristics of projectile points were used to assess manufacturing techniques
and identify cultural affiliation when possible.
The recovery of animal bone can provide clues pertinent to prehistoric subsistence patterns, duration and
season of occupation, utilization of bone material for tools or ornamentation, and animal population density.
Analysis sought to provide taxonomic identification of all faunal remains to the species level, or the most
specific taxon possible, based on limitations of specimen completeness. Minimum number of individuals
(MNI) of all species identified was calculated. Using MNI, a number of useful data categories such as
species-specific and total animal biomass can easily be derived. Other attributes of the bone assemblage
such as age distribution of species, observed pathology, differential preservation of various skeletal parts,
taphonomy, or butchering evidence were also identified and interpreted when possible.
Archeobotanical remains recovered through flotation can give clues to the diet of the prehistoric occupants
as well as to the season, or seasons, of occupation. Flotation samples recovered from feature contexts were
submitted to Archeobotanical Analysis for flotation and analysis.
Historic Materials
Historic artifacts were initially divided into nine broad material categories, with the exception of uncommon
and/or composite artifacts. These categories include historic ceramic, glass, metal, brick, mortar, thermally
altered rock, burned matrix, and miscellaneous historic materials. Additional attributes such as material
type, surface treatment, decorative element, makerâs mark, morphological characteristics, technological
variables, form, color, size, and condition were evaluated.
The historic artifact assemblages recovered from sites 41BP585 and 41BP594 were organized into a
functional classification system built upon ideas put forth by South (1977) for quantitative analyses. Southâs
artifact group and class system was developed to study patterned cultural processes at eighteenth century
British settlement sites. Several modifications were made to Southâs categories to encompass a wider
34

Three Oaks Mine, Bastrop County, Texas

variety of material bi-products produced in part by industrial, commercial, and technological advances
subsequent to the 1700s. Historic artifacts were categorized according to the following use contexts:
activities, agricultural, architectural, arms, clothing, household, kitchen, personal, and unknown. The
classes within each group are based on form and sometimes function. The use context categories in this
analysis are assumed to reflect the majority of a site inhabitantsâ daily behavior utilizing items of material
culture found in the archeological record. However, this classification system is intended only as a general
tool; artifacts may have had multiple uses that would be associated with entirely different categories and/or
functions (Beaudry et al. 1991).

SITE 41BP585 NRHP TESTING RESULTS
SETTING
Site 41BP585 is an historic homestead located on a gently sloping ridge at an approximate elevation of 510
feet (ft) above mean sea level (msl) and covers approximately 8,000 square meters (see Figure 2). A surface
inspection conducted during the present investigation located a variety of structural remains that together
indicated the location of a structure that is no longer extant (Figure 3). These remains include foundation
piers and postsâroughly arranged in a rectangular pattern, three structural beamsâroughly 5 m in length,
as well as a cistern. A transmission line right-of-way crosses the site roughly north to south immediately to
the west of the structural remains. Vegetation at the site consists primarily of mesquite and cacti. Two large
oaks stand 15 m west of the location of the former structure. The soil at the site is Edge fine sandy loam, 2
to 5 percent slopes, eroded (USDA/NRCS 2013). These soils are typically deep, moderately well drained,
and formed in residuum. Shovel testing revealed yellowish red clay at the ground surface across most of
the site. Slightly deeper soil, consisting of a shallow (10-40 cm deep) yellowish brown compact sandy loam,
was encountered within an area extending roughly 30 m east to west in shovel tests 15, 34, 35, and 36, just
to the south of the location of the former structure. The origins of this slightly deeper deposit of sand are
uncertain. The sand may represent a low dune. Ground surface visibility was very high across the site and
often exceeded 80 percent.
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Site 41BP585 was recorded during previous survey of the Three Oaks Mine (Turpin 2003). At that time,
seven shovel tests were excavated to define the limits of the site, of which three contained cultural material
including one crockery sherd, one bottle top, and one piece of colorless glass.
WORK PERFORMED
Shovel Testing
During the present investigation, a total of 129 shovel tests were excavated at site 41BP585, of which 71
yielded cultural materials (Figure 3). Initially, 41 shovel tests were excavated within a 30 m x 25 m area,
roughly centered on the site area where structural remains were exposed on the ground surface, at 5-m grid
intercepts. The remaining 88 shovel tests were excavated at 10-m grid intercepts surrounding the above 30
m x 25 m area where structural remains were observed.
Of the 41 shovel tests excavated at 5-m grid intercepts, 32 were culturally positive and yielded 429 glass
shards, 490 metal artifacts, 18 ceramic sherds, 56 shingle fragments, ten fragments of faunal bone, 40 mortar
fragments, one charcoal fragment, five brick fragments, one slate fragment, one burned conglomerate of
metal and glass, and one fragment of burned soil. Two prehistoric artifacts, both lithic debitage, were also
recovered. Shovel test 20, the third most productive shovel test excavated on site, exposed a layer of ash in
Level 3. The ash deposit was designated as Feature 1.

Of the 88 shovel tests excavated at 10-m intervals, 39 were culturally positive and yielded 585 glass shards,
75 metal artifacts, eight ceramic sherds, two brick fragments, two burned metal and glass conglomerates,
one fragment of burned soil, and one fragment of charcoal. Four pieces of non-diagnostic lithic debitage
were also recovered.
Glass shards were recovered in a slightly greater frequency from the shovel tests excavated at 10-m grid
intercepts. An average of 15 glass shards was recovered from these shovel tests, while an average of 13.4
glass shards was recovered from the shovel tests excavated at 5-m grid intercepts in the immediate vicinity
of the structural remains on site. The apparent concentration of glass shards in the area surrounding the
immediate vicinity of the former structure reflects the yield from one shovel test (ST 90), which contained
478 shards of glass. Artifacts in all remaining categories, most notably metal, ceramic, and brick, were
recovered in greater frequencies from the shovel tests excavated at 5-m grid intercepts.
Hand Excavation
Unit 1 and Feature 1
Unit 1 was excavated to sample Feature 1, first exposed in shovel test 20. Unit 1 was a 1 m x 1 m unit that
encompassed shovel test 20 along its western edge. The unit was excavated to a depth of 54 cmbs, where
the base of Feature 1 was encountered. Feature 1 was exposed in plan (Figure 4) at the base of Level 1,
roughly as a quarter section of a circle with an uneven outline that encompassed about two thirds of the unit
floor. The feature extended into the southern and western walls of the unit, and its horizontal limits were
not fully exposed. The portion of the feature exposed in Unit 1 was bisected east to west along a line
crossing the unit at its north/south midpoint. In profile the feature was shown to be a pit filled with domestic
refuse with a distinct layer of ash (Figure 5). The pit extended into the clay subsoil and was positioned
along the southern edge of the former structure. Based on the alignment of extant foundations piers, the pit
feature would have been under the house floor.

Richard H. Kimmel (1993:102) notes that the functions of sub-floor pits are variable both in terms of
original function and adaptive use. Such features often originated as borrow pits for hearth and chimney
construction and were subsequently put to other uses such as root cellars or places to store valuables. Feature
1 may have served one or more of these functions. Kimmel notes that the placement of borrow pits within
rather than outside of the foundation would eliminate an inconvenient hole in the yard.
The irregular outlines of Feature 1 and the absence of any evidence suggesting it might have been lined or
finished suggests it likely originated as a borrow pit. The pit was filled in with domestic refuse, ash, and
charcoal. Artifacts recovered from Feature 1 included 15 asphalt shingles, 29 brick fragments, 91 ceramic
sherds, 133 faunal bone fragments, 1,585 pieces of glass, 707 metal artifacts, and 88 pieces of mortar. Only
seven specimens (three glass, three ceramic, one faunal bone) exhibit signs of burning, indicating the ash
and charcoal were secondarily deposited and do not represent in situ burning.
Unit 2
Unit 2 was a 1 m x 1 m unit located 15 m south of the former location of the structure, within the portion
of the site with the deepest soils. Unit 2 was excavated to 47 cmbs. Artifacts recovered from Unit 2 included
two brick fragments, two ceramic sherds, one faunal bone, 30 glass shards, 73 metal artifacts, three pieces
of mortar, and one rubber fragment.
HISTORIC ARTIFACT ASSEMBLAGE ANALYSIS
Shovel testing and hand unit excavation at site 41BP585 yielded 4263 historic artifacts. Subsequent
analyses indicated that these artifacts fit within nine functional groups. Table 1 presents the functional
groups and the total number of artifacts assigned to each group. The historic artifact assemblage is discussed
within the framework of these artifact groups. When possible, contextual interpretations are made
concerning how the material remains may have been used.

Activities (n=7; less than 1 percent)
The Activities Group includes items that may have been utilized by multiple occupants at the site during
various pursuits. This group consists of a total of seven artifacts within three artifact classes, including
musical instruments, toys, and tools. Activities-related artifacts include four harmonica plates, one marble,
one axe head, and one chain fragment. No specimens within this group exhibited evidence of burning.
Musical Instruments
Harmonicas, also known as French harps or mouth organs consist of three basic parts: the comb, reed plates,
and cover plates. Four copper alloy (likely brass) reed plates from a harmonica were recovered from the
site. Harmonicas were introduced to America shortly after 1857 and rapidly became very popular. Although
harmonicas are still popular today, the United States experienced a shortage of harmonicas during World
War II due to limited supplies and rations.
Toys
The single toy recovered from the site is a glass marble. The marble type recovered was produced using an
early machine method, which is indicated by a roughened end and a swirling pattern close to the surface of
the marble. This technique is known as a transitional machine-made process, which generally dates from
1901 to 1926 (Randall 1971).
Tools
The historic tool assemblage includes two metal tools: a ferrous alloy axe head and a portion of a cast and
linked ferrous alloy chain. Both items were likely utilized in a variety of contexts and activities; however,
neither is temporally diagnostic.
SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES GROUP ARTIFACTS
The artifacts assigned to the Activities Group are consistent with a domestic occupation dating from the
nineteenth century and extending into the early twentieth century. The harmonica is associated with leisuretime activities, while tools recovered from the site imply a multitude of possible activities, which could
have been undertaken at a rural farmstead.

Agriculture (n=311; 7 percent)
The Agriculture Group includes items pertaining to animal husbandry and farming. All artifacts within this
category are comprised of ferrous alloy and were recovered in mostly incomplete forms. No specimens
within this group exhibited evidence of burning.
Animal Husbandry
Objects relating to animal husbandry at site 41BP585 consist of three buckle fragments, one snaffle bit
fragment, one harness buckle fragment, one horseshoe, 16 fence staples, and 262 fragments of fence wire.
The snaffle bit fragment consists of a ring and a partial mouthpiece. Bits are pieces of horse tack used within
the bridle. Harnesses allow a horse to pull various horse-drawn vehicles, such as wagons, carriages, or
plows. Fence wire in conjunction with fence staples indicates the former presence of fencing. The
predominant use for any type of fencing would have been for agricultural purposes, such as the containment
of livestock.
Farming
Objects related to farming include 24 fragments of wire, one scale weight, and two hangers. Fragments of
iron wire are assumed to reflect various agricultural activities including baling hay. Wire recovered from
site 41BP585 was fragmentary and consisted of narrow gauges of rusted iron alloy. The two-pound scale
weight is known as a hanging weight, which would have accompanied a balance beam scale and used to
weigh cotton, tobacco, grain, meat, or other such items.
SUMMARY OF AGRICULTURE GROUP ARTIFACTS
While the Agriculture artifact assemblage is not temporally sensitive, the use contexts of the artifacts are
consistent with a late-nineteenth to early-twentieth century farmstead occupation. The Agriculture artifacts,
such as the horse bit, harness, fence staples, hanging weight, and wire, are congruent with materials and
tools used in animal husbandry and farming activities during that time period.
Architecture (n=2345; 54 percent)
The Architecture Group includes structural materials, such as shingles, brick, mortar, and window glass;
construction hardware, such as nails and washers; and interior finishing items, such as electric insulators
and door handles. No specimens within this group exhibited evidence of burning.
Structural Materials
Asphalt Shingles
Asphalt shingles identified from the assemblage included 67 small fragments of an organic felt-backed
shingle with reddish brown and off-white ceramic inclusions. These shingles date to before the 1970s and
are likely historic in age.
Bricks
The 40 brick fragments recovered from site 41BP585 include handmade and machine-made varieties.
Handmade brick fragments total 11 specimens (149.87 grams [g]) and range in color from reddish brown
(n=5) to reddish yellow (n=5) to reddish gray (n=1). Machine-made brick fragments total 29 specimens
(1,947.1 g), and range in color from dark reddish brown (n=2) to reddish brown (n=24) to white (n=3). No
44

Three Oaks Mine, Bastrop County, Texas

surface treatments or evidence of burning was present on the brick specimens. While no makerâs marks
were observed, in Texas machine-made bricks generally began replacing hand-made bricks in construction
around 1900 (Steinbomer 1982).
Mortar
Mortar recovered from the site consists of a soft, white, sandy paste. A total of 132 mortar fragments were
recovered with a combined mass of 1,546.63 g. All recovered mortar was highly fragmented and displayed
no evidence of burning.
Window Glass
Window glass belongs to the structural materials subcategory of the Architecture Group. A total of 1,687
flat glass shards were identified as window pane fragments. Aqua-tint shards (n=1,492) and colorless shards
(n=195) were both recovered from site 41BP585. Recovery of flat glass less than 3.2 millimeters (mm) in
width indicates that at least one structure at the site contained paned windows.
Construction Hardware
Nails
A total of 373 nail fragments were recovered and assigned to the Construction Hardware subcategory of
the Architecture Group. The nail assemblage is comprised of fragmentary and heavily rusted specimens.
Degradation of the nail assemblage precluded identification of any characteristics other than basic
manufacturing techniques. Cut nails (n=65) are the least prevalent, while wire nails (n=288) represent over
80 percent of the nail assemblage. A total of 20 nails were of indeterminate manufacturing technique. A
single type of nail head was identified from within the assemblage. Roofing nails with white metal caps
meant to mushroom and seal the hammered nail hole comprised seven of the wire nails recovered. Although
wire nails were introduced during the first quarter of the nineteenth century, they did not replace cut nails
until the last decade of the nineteenth century (Adams 2003).
Miscellaneous
Brass washers (n=2), wood screws (n=4), iron staples (n=4), brass strapping fragments (n=16), ferrous alloy
spring (n=1), and ferrous alloy ring (n=1) were recovered from the site, which are assumed to represent a
portion of the architectural component. These items are not considered temporally diagnostic, and could
date to either the historic or modern era.
Interior Finishing Items
Electric Insulators
Electric insulators are considered interior finishing items to varying types of structures. Two single-knob
porcelain insulators were recovered from site 41BP585. Knob insulators were used for electrical wiring
within buildings. Before 1935, only 2.3 percent of rural areas in Texas had access to electrification from a
generating plant. However, the Emergency Relief Act of 1935 provided funding for electrification and by
1965 only 2 percent of Texas farms remained without electricity (Davis 2013). Therefore, it is likely that
the electric insulators date from sometime after 1935.

Three Oaks Mine, Bastrop County, Texas

45

Miscellaneous
Other items, which can be interpreted as finishing items within the Architecture Group, include iron
brackets (n=4), mortise latch and lock (n=1), hinges (n=9), brass nozzles (n=1), and a ceramic Benningtonlike brown-glazed doorknob (n=1). Many of these items could date to either the historic or modern period;
however, it is likely that the doorknob dates to after the 1860s (Hall 2013).
SUMMARY OF ARCHITECTURE GROUP ARTIFACTS
Temporally diagnostic architectural remains at site 41BP585 provide production date ranges that span from
1790 to the present. The predominance of machine-made bricks produced after 1900 indicate significant
building activities subsequent to the turn of the nineteenth century, with improvements, repairs, or additions
into the first half of the twentieth century (Steinbomer 1982). Additionally, the majority of the nails
recovered from the site are wire, suggesting construction activities were concentrated after circa 1900
(Edwards and Wells 1993). However, the presence of cut nails, handmade bricks, and items such as the
Bennington-like doorknob suggest that domestic occupation began during the nineteenth century and may
have occurred as early as 1860. The presence of insulators suggests the electrification of at least one
structure at the site, which most likely occurred after 1935 but before 1965. Additionally, the presence of
asphalt shingle fragments suggest that the site remained occupied into the first half of the twentieth century.
In summary, the Architecture Group suggests building activities may have occurred prior to 1900 and as
early as 1860, but the majority of materials date to the first half of the twentieth century.
Arms (n=16; less than 1 percent)
The Arms Group includes artifacts involved with the utilization and/or production of munitions. Artifacts
assigned to the Arms Group include 11 cartridge cases and five projectiles. No specimens within this group
exhibited evidence of burning.
Cartridge Cases
Cartridge cases recovered from site 41BP585 consist of rimfire (n=9) and centerfire (n=2) cases. The rimfire
cases are all spent .22 caliber cartridges made of brass in regular (n=1), long or long rifle (n=6), and
unknown (n=2) lengths. Rimfire .22 caliber cases have been in production since 1857; however, a head
stamp of a diamond provides a date range of 1898 to 1935. This type of mark was used by the Western
Cartridge Company founded in 1898, until its merger with the Winchester Repeating Arms Company in
1935 (Barnes 2000). Two âUâ headstamps were in use from 1867 to 1962 by the Union Metallic Cartridge
Company even after the Remington merger in 1911 according to Suydam (1979:327-329). In addition, a
single âFâ headstamp was identified as the mark of the Federal Cartridge Company from 1916 to present
(Suydam 1979:323). A total of four cases exhibited a âSHâ headstamp and a single case contained an
unknown character, both of which have unidentified manufacturers and date ranges. The two centerfire
cases are spent 12 gauge shotgun cartridges made of brass. The solid head cases exhibited a makerâs mark
associated with the Winchester Company and their line of New Rival shells from 1920 to 1929 (Stadt
1984:33).
Projectiles
The three projectiles recovered from the site include mushroomed, conical bullets of two sizes. A single
120 grain bullet and two 31 grain bullets are likely to be around .357 caliber and .22 caliber rounds,
46

National Register Testing at Sites 41BP585, 41BP594, and 41BP595
Three Oaks Mine, Bastrop County, Texas

respectively. These calibers were determined by weight. Both of these calibers are still in production today,
and are therefore not temporally diagnostic.
SUMMARY OF ARMS GROUPS ARTIFACTS
While the Arms Group artifacts conceivably could have been produced during the period from 1857 to the
present, the majority of the dated items represent production during the late nineteenth century to the 1930s.
For this reason, the Arms Group assemblage is thought to represent discard primarily during the first half
of the twentieth century.
Clothing (n=4, less than 1 percent)
Artifacts attributed to the Clothing Group include two fragments of the same button that were counted as
one artifact and three fabric fragments, none of which exhibited evidence of burning.
Buttons
The two button specimens represent fragments of a single button and include a molded dark purple glass
center and decoratively stamped copper alloy sheeting. The glass appears to be faceted and conical with a
central perforation, which was presumably for a metallic drum. The brass sheeting encircles a portion of
the exterior perimeter of the button, suggesting that the glass was decoratively rimmed. This type of button
is known as a Victorian Jewel or glass mounted in metal. The size of the button is indeterminate due to its
fragmentary nature, but it was likely larger than 25 Ligne (16 mm). Its decorative appearance suggests it
was utilized on a womanâs external garment.
SUMMARY OF CLOTHING GROUP ARTIFACTS
Artifacts attributed to the Clothing Group conceivably could date from the mid-nineteenth century through
the early twentieth century. The single glass button (two fragments) was highly decorative and was a type
popularly produced until around World War I. Although the textiles are likely more modern intrusions, the
single button suggests discard during the late nineteenth to early twentieth century.
Household (n=10; less than 1 percent)
This group includes items that are commonly found within a domicile and were presumably utilized by
multiple occupants at the site. Artifacts belonging to the Household Group are restricted to lighting items.
No specimens within this group exhibited evidence of burning.
Lighting Items
Lighting items recovered from the site consist of glass chimney lamp fragments, brass oil lamp parts, and
a single light bulb fragment. A total of six colorless chimney glass shards were recovered, one of which
consists of a chimney base with a scalloped and beaded edge. All chimney lamp glass is presumably
associated with kerosene lanterns, which required drafting in order to burn. Three portions of oil lamps
were recovered and include a lamp collar and two burners. Kerosene lanterns were generally in use between
1860 and 1880 (Spillman 1983), a period consistent with the September 16, 1862 patent date stamped on
both burners.

SUMMARY OF HOUSEHOLD GROUP ARTIFACTS
Few household items were recovered at site 41BP585. The presence of gas-burning lantern parts and light
bulb fragments are consistent with a domestic occupation potentially beginning as early as 1862 and
continuing into the twentieth century.
Kitchen (n=1,178; 27 percent)
The Kitchen Group includes subcategories of artifacts related to food preparation, storage, and
consumption. These artifacts include ceramic vessel fragments, glass container fragments, and metal
utensils. Sixteen specimens within this group exhibited evidence of burning.
Ceramics
A total of 125 ceramic sherds belonging to the Kitchen Group were recovered. Ware types recognized
include ironstone (n=51), redware (n=2), and stoneware (n=72). These specimens represent vessels
designed for use as tableware and storageware. Decoration is evident on 13 ceramic sherds; two sherds
have makerâs marks, and one sherd has a capacity mark. It is possible that the undecorated specimens
belonged to blank portions of decorated vessels. Seven ceramic sherds exhibited evidence of burning.
Redware
Two sherds exhibiting a coarse red paste were recovered. Both are undecorated body sherds with an Albanylike slip on both the interior and exterior and could not be attributed to a particular vessel form.
Stoneware
Stoneware is the most common ware type recovered from site 41BP585 (n=72). Stoneware hollowware
vessel forms include fragments from a rounded bottom bowl (n=7), a one process hanging lid (n=6),
indeterminate type lid (n=1), indeterminate crocks (n=2), a teapot (n=1), and straight-sided cylindrical jugs
with tooled shoulders (n=2). The remaining 53 sherds and sherdlets could not be confidently assigned to
either vessel category or form. Stoneware fragments recovered at the site include 14 rim sherds, 50 body
sherds, five base sherds, and seven sherdlets. Stoneware is not commonly decorated but is frequently treated
with a glaze or slip. At site 41BP585, 13 variations of glazes and/or slips are exhibited. These include
Albany-like slip, Bristol glaze, Rockingham glaze, alkaline glaze, salt glaze, and slip glazes. Unglazed
vessels, known as bisque ware, are also present. A total of two stoneware sherds display decoration while
a third displays a capacity mark; the remaining sherds are undecorated and unmarked.
Surface Treatments
The most frequent surface treatments (Table 2) to the stoneware assemblage at site 41BP585 consist of
variations of a Bristol glaze (n=29), followed closely by variations of Albany-like slips (n=28). Variations
of Bristol glazes include use of this glaze alone or in combination with Albany-like slips. Bristol glazes
were commonly seen on the exterior of vessels with an Albany-like interior from 1880 to around 1915
(Greer 1981). A total of three stoneware sherds were treated in this manner. After 1915, Bristol glazes were
commonly used alone on stoneware vessels. Twenty-five sherds were glazed internally and externally with
a Bristol glaze. Additionally, one split sherd retains only an external Bristol glaze.

The use of Albany-like slip glazes on both the interior and exterior of a vessel was a treatment that generally
predates 1890 (Greer 1981). A total of 20 sherds in the assemblage exhibit this form of slip. Two split
sherds retain only an external Albany-like slip. Albany like slip glazes were indentified on the exterior only
of six fragments from a single crock lid.
Additional and less frequently occurring glazes and slips at the site include alkaline (n=1), salted slips or
Frogskin (n=3), salt glaze (n=1), slips (n=3), and Rockingham (n=1). One Rhenish-like slip glazed sherd,
a variation of traditional salt glazing, was also recovered; this sherd exhibits a brown color under a colorless,
textured glaze.

Decorations
Of the 72 sherds in the stoneware assemblage, only two displayed evidence of decoration. The sole
decorative technique is sgraffito or incised lettering through the slip (n=2). The two fragments are from a
single jug with straight sides and tooled shoulders, which came into production around 1890 (Greer 1981).
The partial lettering is incised into the neck and collar through an Albany-like slip. An exact match to the
lettering and handwriting was observed in an identically formed jug reading, âFrom / Wallace & Gregory
Bros. / Sprit.Essig / Paducah, KY. / Sold by Knocke & Eiband / New Braunfels, Tex.â (ibid 143). Therefore,
this jug definitely dates between the years of 1887 and 1907 when the Knocke and Eiband store was
operating in New Braunfels (TARO & Sophienburg Museum and Archives).
Capacity Marks
Only one capacity mark was present within the stoneware assemblage. The mark consists of an impressed
â6â on the surface of an Albany-like slipped lid. This number represents a capacity mark for a vessel. It is
likely that the corresponding storage vessel held a volume of six gallons.

Refined Earthenware
Ironstone
Ironstone sherds are the second most frequently occurring sherd type at site 41BP585. Among the 51
ironstone sherds, 33 are undecorated, 16 are decorated, and one is marked. Decorative techniques (Table 3)
include decalcomania (n=1); decalcomania, molding, and gilding (n=6); decalcomania and molding (n=2);
and molding (n=7). Vessel forms represented are hollowware, such as fragments of tea cups (n=14), and
flatware, such as fragments of plates (n=21). The remaining 16 sherds could not be confidently assigned to
either vessel category or form. Ironstone sherds from these vessel categories comprised 13 rim sherds; 10
rim, body and base sherds; 13 body sherds; 13 base sherds; and two sherdlets.
Decorations
Decorative techniques can be useful chronological indicators for ceramics. Certain types of decoration have
periods of popularity that are well-established, although there is some variability from region to region.
Three distinct techniques of decorations are present on the refined earthenware sherds found at site
41BP585 and include decalcomania, molding, and gilding.

Makerâs Marks
Fragmentary makerâs marks are present on two ironstone sherds. Transfer print marks were the only type
of marks observed, which appear on the exterior surface of base fragments. Marks range in design from the
British Royal Coat of Arms (n=1) to text only (n=1). The only observed color was black (n=2). These
makerâs marks were too incomplete to be attributed to specific manufactures and date ranges.
Glass
Kitchen container glass (n=941) includes fragments of vessel glass (n=217), bottles (n=716), jars (n=4),
and jar lid liners (n=4). Vessel forms identified consist of rim shards, body shards, base shards, and
complete containers. (Table 4). A total of 32 glass shards exhibit evidence of burning. Multiple attributes
of glass containers can be temporally sensitive and can include color, technological characteristics,
decorations, and manufacturing marks.

Color
Glass colors present at the site include amber, aquamarine, aqua-tint, cobalt, colorless, dark olive, green,
jadeite, olive, and opaline (Table 5). Colorless glass also includes the subcategory solarized glass or suncolored amethyst. A total of 31 shards of solarized glass were identified. The most temporally sensitive
glass colors are solarized glass, which dates from around 1890 to 1920, and dark olive, or black glass, which
was not commonly produced after 1880 (SHA 2013).

Technological Attributes
Technological attributes of historic glass containers encompass a wide variety of characteristics, and in
many cases, relate closely to the manner in which the container was produced. Temporally sensitive features
include bubbles, suction scars, and finishes.
Bubbles
Air bubble inclusions were observed in 129 shards of container glass, accounting for roughly 15 percent of
the container glass assemblage. These inclusions are the result of irregularities in the production process,
which were all but successfully eliminated by 1920 (Polack 2000).
Suction Scars
No evidence of suction scars was observable within the glass assemblage. Suction scars are characteristic
marks produced by the Owens Automatic Bottle Making Machine. Bottles produced with suction scars
generally post-date 1910 and predate 1947 (SHA 2013). The fragmentary nature of many bottle bases or
perhaps a dearth of recovered glass from this time period may account for the lack of this diagnostic feature.
Finishes
A total of 23 rim specimens from bottles and jars retained portions of the finishes, of which only 15 are
identifiable. Seven different finishes are present within the assemblage, while only two methods of
production were noted. The finishes include bead (n=1), crown (n=1), patent (n=2), brandy (n=1), double
ring (n=1), oil (n=2), and external thread (n=7). All of these types are present on bottles, with the exception
of the external continuous threads, which are also present on jars. These finishes are not temporally
sensitive, as most were used from the nineteenth to twentieth century, including the external continuous
thread, which dates from the early twentieth century and remains in production today.
The three methods of finish production present at the site include applied finishes (n=1), tooled finishes
(n=3), and machine-made finishes (n=11). Applied finish specimens likely date to before 1915, while tooled
finishing is still employed on specialty bottles (SHA 2013). Conversely the 11 fully machine-made finishes
post-date 1905 and most likely 1915 (SHA 2013).
Decorations
A total of 170 glass shards exhibited molded characteristics beyond makerâs marks, which can be
considered decorative elements. Decorative treatments to glass containers within the Kitchen Group include
molding, embossing, and pressing. Examples of decorations consist of text (n=20), base stippling (n=122),
linear patterns (n=7), and indeterminate motifs (n=21). Temporally sensitive decorations present include
embossed texts, which date from 1900 to the present.
Makerâs Marks
Five makerâs marks were found on the bases of glass bottles and jars, of which only three marks could be
attributed to a specific manufacturer (Table 6). These marks date from around 1925 to 1980.

Metal Closures
A total of 109 metal specimens were identified as complete or incomplete portions of glass vessel closures.
Aluminum bottle caps (n=71) comprised the majority of the collection, while unidentified, ferrous alloy
lids (n=37) accounted for the remaining with the exception of a single pull tab. These closures
predominately date to the twentieth century.
Metal Utensils
One piece of metal cutlery was recovered from site 41BP585 belonging to the Kitchen Group. It consists
of a single, iron alloy spoon cast in one piece. Due to the lack of oxidation, the spoon is likely composed
of a rather sophisticated stainless steel, which likely post-dates 1930 (Dunning 2000:43).
SUMMARY OF KITCHEN GROUP ARTIFACTS
The kitchen material suggests that the primary domestic occupation of site 41BP585 dated to the twentieth
century. Diagnostic ceramic materials imply that the site could have been occupied as early as 1842 based
on the presence of ironstone and some salt-glazed stoneware; however, a lack of contemporaneous and
earlier wares suggest a later date as evidenced by dated makerâs marks from 1887 to 1907, as well as a
predominance of decorations dated to after 1890. Decorative varieties encountered on ceramic wares, such
as decal ware, are consistent with occupation into the mid to late twentieth century, as are stoneware glazes
which were produced until the 1940s. Glass containers at the site indicate occupation after 1900, as
evidenced by diagnostic colors dated mostly after 1920, and finish types dated predominantly after 1905
and likely 1920. The majority of the makerâs marks on glass containers also date from around 1925 to 1969.
The Kitchen Group represents occupation from around the end of the nineteenth century into the mid
twentieth century.
Personal (n=8, less than 1 percent)
Eight artifacts recovered from site 41BP585 were placed within the Personal Group. There are five
specimens related to tobacco consumption and three fragments related to hygiene. Only one artifact from
the Personal Group exhibited evidence of burning.
Hygiene
Two of the three hygiene items recovered from the site are from a plastic hair comb. The comb is made
from an unidentified plastic. Plastics were produced as early as the nineteenth century and continue to be
made today; therefore, the comb is not considered to be temporally sensitive. A single opaline cosmetics
jar was also recovered, which likely dates from 1920 to 1950 (SHA 2013).

Tobacco
Items related to tobacco consumption recovered at the site are fragments of snuff jars, distinguished by their
characteristic amber coloration and square shape. A total of five fragments of machine-made snuff bottles
were recovered.
SUMMARY OF PERSONAL GROUP ARTIFACTS
Artifacts recovered from site 41BP585 within the Personal Group are not considered temporally sensitive,
however they are not inconsistent with nineteenth and twentieth century domestic discard. In summary, the
Personal group reflects domestic occupation of 41BP585 during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
Unknown (n=384, 9 percent)
A total of 384 artifacts recovered from site 41BP585 were unknown or too fragmentary to confidently
assign them to any one of the functional groups including metal fragments (n=364), thermally altered rock
(n=1), burned matrix (n=15), plastic/rubber (n=1), and slate (n=3).
SUMMARY OF UNKNOW GROUP ARTIFACTS
The 384 artifacts within the Unknown Group could not be assigned to a particular functional group due
primarily to specimen incompleteness; however, their presence at site 41BP585 is consistent with the range
of other historic artifacts found at the site. In addition, they do not contradict any inferences drawn from
the rest of the assemblage.
Site 41BP585 Historic Artifact Assemblage Analysis Summary
All of the temporally diagnostic artifacts recovered reflect a historic occupation from the late nineteenth
century into the early twentieth century. The Architecture Group indicates building activities after the turn
of the twentieth century and continuing as late as the 1930s or 1940s. Artifacts from the Activities, Arms,
Clothing, Household, Kitchen, and Personal groups confirm an occupation that likely began before 1900
but occurred primarily after this time. The historic artifacts recovered from the site include common and
widely available materials consistent with domestic and farming activities. The artifact assemblage as a
whole reflects activities consistent with the occupation of a late nineteenth century to early twentieth
century working farmstead with a domestic component.
FAUNAL MATERIALS
Faunal materials recovered from NRHP testing at site 41BP585 include 153 specimens (Appendix D,
41BP585 Faunal Remains). Of the recovered remains, 14 (9.2 percent) could not be identified to any
taxonomic category because of their small size, fragmentary nature, and poor condition of preservation. Of
the remaining 139 identifiable specimens, 62 (44.6 percent) were attributable to mammals, 72 (51.8 percent)
were attributable to birds, three (2.2 percent) were attributable to reptiles, one (0.7 percent) was attributable
to amphibians, and one (0.7 percent) was attributable to invertebrates (Table 7).

Of the 62 mammalian remains, one specimen was categorized as belonging to a large-sized mammal,
generally greater than 120 kg in live weight. In this size range, the most likely candidate would be cattle,
horse, or a large example of swine.

National Register Testing at Sites 41BP585, 41BP594, and 41BP595
Three Oaks Mine, Bastrop County, Texas

55

Fifty-eight of the mammalian remains were attributable to medium-sized mammals (20â120 kg in live
weight), numerically accounting for 93.6 percent of the mammalian total count. These medium-sized
mammals include 36 specimens identified as swine (Sus scrofa) and one specimen identified as a large dog,
coyote, or wolf (Canis sp.). The remaining 21 medium-sized mammal bones could not be further identified
taxonomically. Swine is often the most common medium-sized mammal species in historic assemblages in
this region, so it is likely that most of the 21 remaining medium-sized mammal bones are also swine
remains. Other possible candidates in this size range include sheep, goats, immature cattle or horse, deer,
pronghorn antelope, coyote, wolf, red wolf, or larger examples of dog or beaver.
Three specimens were categorized as a small-sized mammal, generally weighing between 0.5 and 20 kg in
live weight. Two were identified as belonging to the common domestic cat (Felis domesticus) and one
specimen was attributed to a cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus sp.)
Of the 72 specimens that were attributable to birds, 67 were egg shell fragments. Based on shell thickness
and size, all were consistent with eggs of chicken (Gallus gallus). The only other bird remains were five
longbone diaphyseal fragments from a large bird, consistent in size with a chicken or similar-sized bird.
Three reptile remains were recovered, representing the only other faunal remains recovered from site
41BP585. All three were attributed to an unidentified pond turtle (Family Emydidae). The single amphibian
bone was from a bullfrog or large leopard frog (Rana sp.)
The only other faunal specimen was a bivalve shell half from the common rangia (Rangia cuneata), a
brackish water clam. Rangia is not native to the site area. Its closest natural occurrence is along the Texas
Gulf coast, more than 150 km away.
Cultural Modification
The only evidence of cultural modification present in the faunal assemblage was burning, which was present
on only one unidentified specimen, and sawing, which was present on two unidentified medium-sized
mammal bones. The burned specimen was burned completely to a light gray, suggesting intentional discard
in a fire rather than fortuitous blackening of exposed bone surfaces during cooking for consumption. This
method of disposal was probably intended to inhibit flies and insects as well as larger scavenger species.
The low incidence of burning of the faunal remains in Feature 1 indicates that the discarded remains were
not consistently burned.
The two sawn specimens exhibited cut surfaces consistent with a power saw rather than a hand saw,
indicating that they were discarded late in the historic period, almost certainly post-1920. No other evidence
of cultural modification was observed in this assemblage.
Ageing
The only specimens for which ageing could be interpreted were two specimens attributable to swine: a
single third upper molar (lot 32) and a mandibular fragment (lot 139). The condition of the teeth suggests
at least two individuals, a juvenile about 9 to 12 months old and a young adult about 18 to 20 months old.

SITE 41BP585 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH
Site 41BP585 is located within the original 4,428-acre Joseph Black Bastrop First-class headright. Firstclass headrights were issued to individuals who arrived in Texas before March 2, 1836 and entitled heads
of families to receive one league (4,428 acres) and one labor (177.1 acres), while single men received 1/3
league (1,476.1 acres) (Texas GLO n.d.). In an applicant list for Texas General Land Office First-Class
certificates dated March 1838, Joseph Black is listed as having immigrated to Texas in 1823, which
qualified him to receive a first-class headright. (Texas GLO n.d.). Black patented his league (4,428 acres)
along Sandy Creek in Bastrop County on May 12, 1846. The associated abstract states that the survey
contains 10 labors of improved land and 15 labors of pasture land (Texas GLO Records, Bastrop County
Abstract 86). Prior to applying for a patent, Black more than likely had to fulfill conditions of the patent
such as residing on the land for a certain amount of time and making improvements to the land. As part of
his headright, Joseph Black also received one labor, which is located in Bastrop County.
Joseph Blackâs ownership of the 4,428-acre tract ended with his death in 1848, at which time a portion of
the tract was sold to settle debts and the remainder was partitioned into five equal parts between his widow
Elizabeth Black, daughter Tabitha and husband David Reynolds, daughter Christina and husband John
Terry, daughter Malinda Black, and minor Polly Black (Bastrop County Deed Records H:489). Just a few
days after the partition deed was filed, each of the heirs conveyed a share of the property they received to
Elizabeth Black for a total of 1,475 acres, comprising the southeast third of the original Joseph Black
League (Bastrop County Deed Records F:218). The subject tract is located within 591.5 acres that Malinda
Black received during the partition of Joseph Blackâs land; it is unclear if she conveyed all or only a portion
of her land to Elizabeth Black (Bastrop County Deed Records P:35). Elizabeth appears to have remarried
by 1850, as she is recorded as Mrs. E. Smitz [sic] in the 1850 Bastrop County tax rolls and owning 1,350
acres in the Joseph Black League at a value of $300. She also paid taxes on a town lot whose name was
illegible in the tax roll (1850 Bastrop County Tax Roll). Elizabeth (age 42) and her new husband Antonio
Schmidt [sic], a carpenter (age 50), are enumerated in the 1850 Bastrop County census, along with C. Hart
(age 18), J. Freestone (age 42), and K. Freestone (age 9) who were residing with the Schmidts in their home.
In 1853 Elizabeth and Antonio Schmitz [sic] conveyed 687 acres within the Black League to Sterling
Edwards for $500. The deed states that both parties were residents of Bastrop County at the time of the
transaction (Bastrop County Deed Records I:137). The Schmitzâs also retained the remainder of their land
within the Black league, as well as their town lot (1853 Bastrop County Tax Roll). The same day he
purchased the land from the Schmitzâs, Edwards sold 200 acres containing the subject parcel to James
Dewes of Bastrop County for $150 (Bastrop County Deed Records I:138). Dewes retained the property for
about a year, after which he sold the 200 acres to James Davis for $175 in 1854 (Bastrop County Deed
Records I:373).
James Davis also did not retain the property long, as he conveyed the 200-acre parcel a month later for $300
to John Chenny [sic], who is listed in the 1854 deed record as a resident of Bastrop County (Bastrop County
Deed Records I:373). Chenny [sic] retained the property for 12 years until he transferred ownership to J. S.
Baker in 1869 for $600, at which time Chenny [sic] is listed in the deed record as a resident of Liberty
County (Bastrop County Deed Record O:341). A review of the 1854 Bastrop County Tax Roll did not

57

reveal a John Chenny; however, a John Cherry [sic] is enumerated as owning 200 acres within the Joseph
Black League worth $200 (1854 Bastrop County Tax Roll). Cherry remained a resident of Bastrop County
until 1856, after which time he was listed as a resident of Liberty County (1856 and 1857 Bastrop County
Tax Rolls). Cherry appears to have been a prosperous farmer while he we was a resident of Bastrop County.
According to the Bastrop County Tax Rolls, Cherry owned up to nine slaves, many horses, a large herd of
cattle, and many hogs while he resided in Bastrop County on the Joseph Black League. Cherry (age 55), is
enumerated in the 1860 Liberty County Census with his wife Frances (age 27) and seven children. He is
listed as a farmer living within the Tarkington Prairie community and owned $2,000 of real estate and
$5,000 of personal estate (1860 Liberty County Census Records). According to an Official Texas Historic
Marker (THC 2013) in Ryan Cemetery, Liberty County, John Cherry arrived in Texas in 1818, served in
the Texas War for Independence and served as an Indian interpreter for General Sam Houston (OTHM).
He patented 2 land grants in Liberty County, including a League in 1835 and a Labor in 1861 (Texas GLO,
Liberty County Abstract Nos. 11 and 160). It is unknown why he spent time in Bastrop County, but he
appears to have remained in Liberty County subsequent to 1860.
Historians did not locate a record of J. S. Baker conveying the property to a subsequent owner; however,
in October of 1869, DeWitt Clinton Baker of Travis County sold 191.5 acres of the 200 acre tract (formerly
owned by Cherry) for $381 to Peter Kellermeier, Sr. of Bastrop County (Bastrop County Deed Records
P:35). DeWitt Clinton Baker was a wealthy Austin businessman and land agent, and it is unknown if he
and J. S. Baker were related. Peter Kellermeier, Sr. was a native of Bavaria, Germany and may have
immigrated to the U.S. as early as 1841 (Rootsweb 2013). Kellermeier first appears in the Bastrop County
tax roll in 1849 and paid taxes on 50 acres within the Joseph Black League (1849 Bastrop County Tax
Rolls). It is likely that the 50 acres were a portion of Blackâs land that was sold to settle debts after his death
in 1848. Kellermeier was also married in 1849, and the 50 acres may have served as his homestead
(Rootsweb 2013). He thus likely resided in the immediate vicinity for many years prior to his larger land
purchase within the Black league. A year after Baker sold him the 191.5 acres, he is enumerated as Peter
Kellermeyer [sic] in the 1870 Bastrop County Census as a 45-year-old farmer living with his wife Barbella
(age 41) and their eight children, including sons Peter, Jr. (age 15), John (age 11), and William (age 6)
(Bastrop County Census Records 1870). Kellermeier retained the 50 acres, as he is listed in the 1870
Bastrop County Tax Roll as owning 240 acres within the Black league at a value of $480. Five years later,
the same property is valued at $800, which could indicate improvements to the property. In 1882, Peter
Kellermeier, Sr. donated 1 acre from his homestead tract for a Catholic church and school, which adjoined
a 1 acre cemetery tract previously donated by Kellermeier for use by several of the German Catholic
families in the vicinity such as the Goerlitzs. The church was demolished, but the cemetery remains and is
now known as the Three Oaks-Goerlitz Cemetery (Turpin 2003; Bastrop County Deed Records 3:517).
The value of Kellermeierâs land remained similar until 1900, when he is listed as owning 245 acres in the
Joseph Black survey at $1,000 (1900 Bastrop County Tax Rolls). Again, this increase in value could
indicate improvements to the property. Peter Kellermeier, Sr. retained the property, which includes the
subject tract until his death in 1908, at which time there was a lawsuit between the Kellermeier heirs and
members of the Herring family, who have an unknown affiliation with the Kellermeiers. The lawsuit
describes the disputed land as about equal portions of mixed pasture and farming lands; however, no
improvements are noted. Instead of partitioning the land, the lawsuit resulted in its sale at public auction,
58

Three Oaks Mine, Bastrop County, Texas

and the land was purchased by Peterâs son, W. F. Kellermeier, for $2,200 (Bastrop County District Court
Records Docket No. 4483). At the time of sale, the property was resurveyed, and the land that Peter
Kellermeier, Sr. purchased from Baker in 1869 was found to consist of 236 acres and not 191.5 acres as
recorded in the original field notes (Bastrop County Deed Records 43:487).
W. F. Kellermeier owned the property until his death in 1963 at the age of 81 (Bastrop County Probate
Minutes 10:80). Kellermeier appears to have been a lifelong resident of Bastrop County and likely resided
somewhere on the subject tract. According to Turpin (2003), family friend Erhard Goerlitz recalled that the
former house that has been attributed to Peter Kellermeier, Sr. was dismantled in the 1930s. His estate was
divided amongst his heirs, and in 1966 the 236 acres within the Joseph Black survey was conveyed to Leslie
D. and Gloria Hurta for $27,025 (Bastrop County Deed Records 175:359). The property has had several
subsequent land owners and does not appear to have been used for residential purposes in subsequent years.
Site 41BP585 Archival Research Summary
Archival evidence indicates that the land within the subject parcel was associated with members of the
Black and Schmitz families from at least the 1840s to 1853. Joseph Black and his family, including wife
Elizabeth, likely resided on some part of the 4,428-acre property for several years prior to Blackâs patent in
1846 to Blackâs death in 1848. It is likely that the portion of land that Elizabeth received at Blackâs death
(which does not contain the subject parcel) contained the Blackâs homestead, which she retained after she
remarried Antonio Schmitz. Thus if the structure at 41BP585 was extant during the mid 1800s it likely was
not the Blackâs homestead, though it could have been associated with one of their children or tenants.
Additionally, it is also possible that the Schmitzâs may have lived on their town lot. The brief period of the
propertyâs ownership under Sterling Edwards, James Dewes, and James Davis during 1853 and 1854
suggests that none of the men resided on the property.
The next long-term owner of the property that contained the subject tract was John Chenny/Cherry, who
owned the property from 1854 to 1869. Archival research revealed that during Cherryâs residency of
Bastrop County until 1856, he was a prosperous farmer and owned nine slaves and a large amount of
livestock. Cherry does not appear to have owned additional property while he was a resident of the county,
which suggests that he lived on the 200-acre property. Thus if the structure was extant while Cherry lived
on the property, it could have been associated with him, his slaves, or tenants. Cherry became a resident of
Liberty County in 1857 and lived there throughout the remainder of his ownership of the property; thus, the
structure could have been associated with any tenants until he conveyed 191.5 acres to Peter Kellermeier,
Sr. in 1869. Kellermeier had lived with his wife and family on 50 acres of the Joseph Black League for 20
years prior to his purchase of the Cherry property, and this property likely served as his homestead. His
total property within the Black League was valued at $480 in 1875 and increased to $800 in 1880, which
suggests improvements were made to the property. These improvements could have consisted of
construction of the structure at 41BP585 or additions to it. If Peter Kellermeier, Sr. was residing at a house
on his homestead, the structure could be attributed to one of his children or a tenant. William F.
Kellermeierâs ownership of the property in 1908 after Peterâs death and subsequent lawsuit may indicate
that he or a tenant resided in the structure. According to a 2000 telephone interview with Erhard Goerlitz,

Three Oaks Mine, Bastrop County, Texas

59

who was a family friend of the Kellermeierâs, the structure at 41BP595 was associated with the
Kellermeierâs and Mr. Goerlitz remembers it being dismantled in the early 1930s (Turpin 2003).
DISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Site 41BP585 appears to represent a farmstead occupation beginning during the late nineteenth century and
continuing into the early twentieth century. Shovel testing and surface inspection revealed shallow eroded
soil over most of the site. The deepest soils on site were limited in extent to the area immediately to the
south of the former location of the structure. The artifacts recovered during testing represent a mixed
assemblage that is thought to date from the late nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth century. It remains
uncertain when the former structure on the site was originally built. The property value increase recorded
in 1880 suggests the structure may have been built by this time. Artifacts recovered belonging to the
architecture group indicate building activities continued after the turn of the century. According to an
informant report, however, the structure appears to have been dismantled in the 1930s.
Site 41BP585 is not associated with events or individuals significant to history, and the site therefore does
not appear to meet National Register eligibility criteria A or B. The absence of standing architecture on the
site precludes eligibility under criterion C. The eroded nature of the soils on site and the mixed nature of
the archeological deposits suggest further that the site does not harbor preserved cultural deposits significant
to history that could qualify the site for listing under Criterion D. For these reasons, site 41BP585 does not
appear to be eligible for NRHP listing. Consequently, no further investigation and granting cultural
resources clearance are recommended.

SITE 41BP594
SETTING
Site 41BP594 is an historic site with an extant structure located on a shoulder slope at an approximate
elevation of 520 ft msl (Figure 6). An unnamed intermittent drainage is located about 300 m to the north
east of the site. A small depression is located to the east of the standing structure. The soil on site is Demona
fine sandy loam 1 to 5 percent slopes (Baker 1979). Demona soils are slightly acid in the A horizon and
strongly acid in the B horizon. Site 41BP594 was initially recorded during previous survey within the Three
Oaks Mine and the standing structure was determined, at that time, to be eligible for NRHP listing (Penick
2001, Martin 2001, Turpin 2003).
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Eight shovel tests were excavated encircling the standing structure when it was first recorded, of which
three were culturally positive and yielded glass, rusted metal, and ceramic sherds (Turpin 2003). âSurface
debris included crockery, glass, square nails, metal scraps, dimensional and split lumber, brick, wire,
linoleum scraps, hinges, roofing metal, and a leather shoe sole that retained one square nail (Turpin
2003:188).â
SITE 41BP594 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH
Site 41BP594 has a similar history to Site 41BP585 in that it was part of the Joseph Black estate during the
first half of the nineteenth century. Upon his death in 1848, Joseph Blackâs daughter Tabitha and husband
David Reynolds were assigned 594 acres within the southwest corner of Blackâs League where the subject
tract and site 41BP594 are located (Bastrop County Deed Records H:489). David Reynolds (32), a
carpenter, and Tabitha (28) are enumerated in the 1850 Bastrop County Census along with their children
(1850 Bastrop County Census Records). The Bastrop County Tax Rolls from the same year valued the
Reynoldsâ property within the Joseph Black League as worth $150 and shows that Reynolds also owned
and paid taxes on 250 acres within the nearby Albert Black Survey (1850 Bastrop County Tax
Rolls). In 1853, the Reynolds conveyed all of their interest in the 594 acres within the Joseph Black survey
to William E. Pinckey [sic] for $175 (Bastrop County Deed Records I:149). Pinckey is listed as a resident
of Bastrop County within the deed record and he paid taxes on the sole property as a resident of the county
until his 1862 conveyance of the entire 594 acres to A. C. Cooper (Bastrop County Tax Rolls 1854, 1855
and 1862; Bastrop County Deed Record M:438). During Pickneyâs ownership of the property, its value as
listed in the Bastrop County Tax Rolls, increased from $250 in 1855 to $900 in 1862. This significant
increase may suggest improvements to the property; however, it was sold to Cooper for only $500.
A. C. Cooper resided in Travis County in 1860, but had relocated to Bastrop County by 1862 when he
purchased the property (1860 Bastrop County Census Records). Cooper only owned land within the Black
League for the next 5 years which suggests that he resided somewhere on the property; however, by 1870
he owned just 300 acres within the Black League (1870 Bastrop County Tax Rolls). In 1872, Cooper
conveyed a 134.5-acre tract containing the subject parcel to âfreedmanâ Jeff Tinnen for $200 (Bastrop
County Deed Record S:535). That same day, A. C. Cooper conveyed the remainder of the 300 acres to the
National Register Testing at Sites 41BP585, 41BP594, and 41BP595
Three Oaks Mine, Bastrop County, Texas

61

south to âfreedmanâ Wright Parmerâ for $200 (Bastrop County Deed Record R:410). Jeff Tinnen is listed
in the 1870 Bastrop County Tax Roll as owning 160 acres in the John Hearn League at $320; however, he
appears to have sold the property prior to purchasing the 134.5 acres in the Black League for $200. The
value of Tinnenâs land fluctuated while it was in his possession: rising to $546 in 1873, $408 in 1875, $800
in 1877, $314 in 1878 and $408 in 1881 (Bastrop County Tax Rolls 1873, 1875, 1877, 1878 and 1881).
This change in value suggests improvements to the land such as structures or perhaps agricultural
improvements. In the 1880 Bastrop County Census Jeff Tinnon (47) [sic] is recorded as a laborer residing
with his wife Amanda (27), son Bob (18), son Charley (16) and daughter Mary (7) (1880 Bastrop County
Census). His neighbors include two Goerlitz families, Peter Kellermeier and three Parmer families (all
African American) including fellow âfreedmanâ Wright Parmer.
Jeff Tinnen owned the property until 1884 at which time he moved to Milam County and conveyed the
134.5 acres to John Kellermeier (Peter Kellermeierâs son) for $435.30 (Bastrop County Deed Record
6:153). When Kellermeier bought the property he was 25 years old and had purchased 200 additional acres
in the Joseph Black League in an adjacent tract, 3 years earlier (1884 Bastrop County Tax Records). The
total of 334.5 acres was valued at $668 in the 1885 Bastrop County Tax Roll (1885 Bastrop County Tax
Records). As Kellermeier did not own any additional land, he likely resided somewhere on his property in
the Black League. In 1890 Kellermeierâs land within the Black League had increased to $768, though he
had sold 17 acres of his property. This could indicate improvements to the property such as construction or
additions to structures. By 1895 John Kellermeier increased his land holdings to include 99.5 acres in the
R. H. Grimes League, 83 acres in the A. Martinez League and 3 lots in the town of Elgin. He also owned a
small amount of livestock including horses, cows and hogs (1895 Bastrop County Tax Roll). In 1900 John
Kellermeier is enumerated in the Bastrop County Census as a 40 year old farmer living with his wife Annie
(24) and three small children. His neighbors include the Parmers, Goerlitzs and P. T. Kellermeier, which
indicates that he and his family were residing on his property on the Black League (1900 Bastrop County
Census Records).
John Kellermeierâs land holdings remained stable until 1907 at which time he owned 288 acres in the Black
League which was valued at $1200; just two years earlier the same land was valued at $725 (Bastrop County
Tax Rolls 1905 and 1907). Additionally, the property was valued at $1600 in 1910 (1910 Bastrop County
Tax Rolls). The increase in land value could indicate improvements to the property, including additions to
structures. Kellermeier appears to have moved to Runnels County in 1910 as he is enumerated in the 1910
Census as a farmer and a resident of Runnels County, along with his family (1910 Runnels County Census).
He likely continued to reside in Runnels County as he is listed as a Runnels County resident in 1927 when
he conveyed 160 acres of the Joseph Black League (including the 134.5 acres that contains the subject tract)
to Arthur and Ida Behrend of Bastrop County (Bastrop County Deed Records 83:568). Subsequent to 1910,
the structure could have been associated with members of John Kellermeierâs extended family or tenants.
The property was owned by members of the Behrend family throughout the remainder of the twentieth
century.

Site 41BP594 Archival Research Summary
Archival evidence indicates that the land within the subject parcel was associated with members of the
Black and Reynolds families from at least the 1840âs to 1853. Joseph Black and his family including wife
Elizabeth likely resided on some part of the 4,128-acre property for several years prior to Blackâs patent in
1846 until Blacksâ death in 1848. However, it appears that the coupleâs homestead was located on a different
parcel of the Black League and thus, if the log house was extant during their ownership it could have been
associated with one of the Black children or tenants. The Reynolds short-lived ownership of the property
coupled with the fact that they retained their property in the Albert Black League suggests they may never
have resided on the land and if the house were extant it may have been associated with tenants of the
Reynolds.
William E. Pinckey owned the 594-acre parcel of land for the next 9 years during which time the assessed
property value increased from $250 in 1855 to $900 in 1862. This significant increase suggests
improvements were made somewhere on the property which could include structures or agricultural
improvements; though, it was conveyed in 1862 to A. C. Cooper for only $500 which could indicate that
some of the improvements were temporary. However, it is still possible that the log house was constructed
while Pinckney owned the property. Cooper appeared to sell almost half of the 594 acres by the 1860âs and
by 1870 he owned just 300 acres though it was assessed at $780 in the tax rolls. âFreedmanâ Jeff Tinnen
purchased 134.5 acres from Cooper in 1872 for $200. On that same day, Cooper also conveyed the
remainder of the 300 acres to âFreedmanâ Parmer Wright for $200. Being that Tinnenâs land was sold at
the same price as an adjacent tract that was larger by 30 acres suggests that Tinnenâs land contained
improvements at the time of purchase and thus A. C. Cooper may be associated with the construction of the
log house at 41BP594.
Tinnen resided on the property for 12 years, during which time the value of his property fluctuated from
one year to the next which could indicate structural or agricultural improvements to the land. John
Kellermeier purchased the 134.5 acres from Jeff Tinnen and wife Amanda in 1884 for $435.30.
Kellermeierâs land holdings remained stable until 1907 at which time he owned 288 acres in the Black
League which was valued at $1200; just two years earlier the same land was valued at $725. Additionally,
the property was valued at $1600 in 1910. The increase in land value could indicate improvements to the
property, including additions to structures. The additions and alterations to the dwelling at 41BP594 appear
to be contemporaneous with John Kellermeierâs ownership; it is likely that he, a family member or perhaps
a tenant is responsible for them.
STANDING ARCHITECTURE AT 41BP594
Site 41BP594 contains an extant single-pen, hand-hewn, log house core with several phases of milled, wood
framed alterations and additions that have resulted in a one-story, modified L-plan dwelling (Figure 7 a, b,
and c). The initial construction phase of 41BP594 appears to have been the single-pen log house core
(Figure 8 A) and attached porch (Figure 8 B), which feature elements that suggest a construction daterange from the mid nineteenth to the late nineteenth century. Subsequent additions and alterations to the
dwelling, including an ell addition extending past the attached porch (Figure 8 C) on the west side of the
log core, a second smaller addition on the north side of the log core (Figure 8D), and a porch with a shed

Three Oaks Mine, Bastrop County, Texas

65

roof (Figure 8 E) on the east side of the log core, appear to have been built during the late nineteenth
century to early twentieth century.
The log house core was constructed as a one-story, side-gabled, single-pen dwelling measuring
approximately 4.5 m x 4.5 m. It is situated about 20 cm above the ground surface, resting upon fieldstone
piers. Two large oak sills are situated on the eave sides of the structure and are hewed on all four sides
(Figure 7 e). Three hand-hewn oak joists are lap-jointed to the sills and support milled floorboards which
are likely historic-age replacements. The walls of the dwelling are comprised of rough-hewn oak logs and
feature half-notched corners possibly secured with wood pegs (Figure 7 f). The log core appears to have
been originally constructed with one door and one window on the west faÃ§ade and a chimney under the
north eave. Apertures for all three elements were cut into the structure after the walls were built. The
chimney and fireplace are no longer extant, though remnants of the chimney base, in the form of red-orange
handmade bricks and lime mortar, are evident through a hole in the floor adjacent to the boarded-over
chimney gap (Figure 7 g). The chimney appears to have been replaced by a wood-burning stove as
evidenced by a flue cut into the roof and a metal stove pipe on the roof (Figure 7 h). Yellow hand-made
bricks under the floorboards appear to have supported the wood-burning stove. Terry Jordan (1978) noted
that the majority of log houses built after the Civil War did not include chimneys, and the chimneys in many
of those built prior to the war were later replaced with a stove.
The log dwelling appears to have featured a contemporaneous porch, evidenced by two hand-hewn oak
joists situated on round log piers on the west side (Figure 7 i). The porch was removed, as an ell addition
to this faÃ§ade was built in its place at a later date. The exterior of the log core dwelling is clad in milled,
vertical board and batten siding and affixed with cut nails which indicate that the siding was likely added
no later than 1890. This same board and batten siding also serves as cladding and structural support to the
walls of the shed roof addition on the north faÃ§ade. This room is approximately half the width of the log
core and was accessed through a door on the west faÃ§ade. This addition was built subsequent to the removal
of the chimney and perhaps at or around the same time the log house was clad in board and batten. The roof
of the addition and the log core are supported by milled rafters and clad in corrugated metal strips. The
milled rafters indicate that this is likely a replacement roof for the log dwelling and may not be original to
the addition. Remnants of a shed roof porch, that was likely added subsequent to the ell addition, lie along
the east faÃ§ade of the log house.
The ell addition on the west faÃ§ade is side-gabled and approximately 6 m x 4 m. It is framed in wide, vertical
milled boards and is situated on the hewn sills of the original porch as well as milled sills, all of which rest
on wood piers. The north faÃ§ade of the ell and the majority of the tongue and groove flooring are no longer
intact. It is clad in horizontal beveled weather board on the exterior and thin horizontal tongue and groove
boarding on the interior. A combination of cut and wire nails were used throughout the room, potentially
indicating at least two phases of alterations. Two tall window and/or door apertures punctuate the south
faÃ§ade and an additional window opening has been closed by weatherboard. A line of square wood
foundation piers lies north of the ell addition and may indicate the location of a porch.

Site 41BP594 includes an extant mid- to late-nineteenth century single pen log house core (with later
alterations and additions) and features some distinctive design characteristics of log house construction
such as hand hewn logs, corner notching and stone piers. However, the original pen features several historicage alterations including removal of the chimney, addition of two doors, and two attached room additions
along with the addition of a shed-roof porch. The dwelling lacks sufficient individual architectural merit
and physical integrity to meet the NRHP requirements under Criterion C.
As noted above, Turpin (2003) recommended that the structure be dismantled so that building techniques
of regional log structure construction can be observed. Currently, 41BP594 is one of only a few extant
dwellings in the area with a log house core and subsequent historic alterations. The board and batten
cladding is missing at two of the corners of the log structure, exposing the half-notch corner notching. This
type of notching does not create a secure lock and often includes pegging to create a corner lock.
Observation of dismantling the structure will reveal the type of pegging used. Additionally, the type of
chinking used in the construction of the log dwelling is also of interest as it has eroded at the exposed The
altered dwelling also displays several instances of ornamentation. The interiors of the log house and the
addition are clad in vertical siding both affixed with wire nails and remnants of paint indicate that it was
once painted white. Red base boards also lined both rooms. The ceiling of the log dwelling, which appears
to have been added at a later date, is chamfered and was once covered in some kind of paper. The ceiling
of the ell addition was painted a light blue. The north addition of the log dwelling features a commercially
made scalloped fascia, a detail usually seen on Victorian and folk-Victorian dwellings.
INTEGRITY AND NRHP ELIGIBILITY ASSESSMENT
In the final survey report for the Three Oaks Mine, Turpin (2003:191) recommended that the building at
41BP594 be considered eligible for NRHP listing, and stated further that dismantling of the log core could
âuncover building techniques of interest to regional rural architecture.â This recommendation is in
accordance with the THCâs determination that the log structure at site 41BP594 may be eligible for NRHP
listing under Criterion D, for its potential to yield information concerning log building techniques in Central
Texas (Martin 2001). Later that same year, the THC further determined that the structure at 41BP594 was
eligible for listing in the NRHP as a contributing member of a rural historic district that included three
additional standing structures (at sites 41BP202, 41BP275, and 41BP557) located in the vicinity (Pennick
2001). In 2008 Atkins evaluated these three additional structures (along with 41BP621) and recommended
they be considered not eligible for NRHP inclusion under Criterion C (Foster 2008); the THC subsequently
concurred with this recommendation (Smith 2008).
The extant structure at 41BP594 retains integrity of materials, workmanship, feeling, setting, and location.
Integrity of design has been compromised due to the absence of the north wall of the ell addition, the partial
collapse of the north shed room addition, and the collapse of the east shed roof porch addition.
The structure at 41BP594 may have been constructed as early as the 1850s-1860s with alterations and
additions likely made until the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Current archival research
revealed that the land upon which the structure is situated was purchased and owned by freedman Jeff
Tinnon from 1872 to 1884. Additionally, Tinnon lived adjacent to freedman Wright Parmer who purchased
the property on the same day as Tinnon. Both families appear to have been the only black or mulatto families
70

National Register Testing at Sites 41BP585, 41BP594, and 41BP595
Three Oaks Mine, Bastrop County, Texas

in the area and the majority of their neighbors have German surnames. Tinnon appears to have farmed and
owned a small amount of livestock and does not appear to have relied on whites for work as many of his
counterparts did. Certainly African American land ownership in a non Freedmenâs community during
Reconstruction was very uncommon in Bastrop County. However, the current research effort, including
property (deed, probate and other vital records) research, ad valorem tax record research, population census
research and county history research did not reveal any conclusive evidence that Tinnon built, lived in, or
made alterations to the dwelling at 41BP594. The standing structure at 41BP594, therefore, does not appear
to meet the requirements for NRHP inclusion under Criterion A.
Although it appears that âfreedmanâ Jeff Tinnonâs ownership of a large parcel of land that was not located
within a Freedmensâ community was rare in Bastrop County, current research did not uncover evidence
that conclusively demonstrates Tinnon himself is individually significant or that he built or occupied the
structure at 41BP594. Therefore, the standing structure at 41BP594 does not appear to meet the criteria for
NRHP inclusion under Criterion B.
B&A also recommends producing elevation drawings of the building to record the original log structure
and its subsequent alterations which are part of the structureâs historic fabric and representative of the
evolution of a rural dwelling over many years.
SHOVEL TESTING
A total of 124 shovel tests were excavated on site 41BP594. Of these shovel tests, 56 were excavated at 5
m grid intercepts in the immediate vicinity of the standing structure, an area extending roughly 45 m
east/west by 25 m north/south. The remaining shovel tests were excavated at 10 m grid intercepts
surrounding this area (see Figure 6).
Of the 56 shovel tests excavated in the immediate vicinity of the standing structure at 5 m grid intercepts,
48 were culturally positive, yielding 200 glass shards, 175 metal artifacts, 22 ceramic artifacts, 11 faunal
bone fragments, 11 mortar fragments, 3 slate fragments, 3 charcoal fragments, and 2 rubber fragments.
Three pieces of non-diagnostic lithic debitage were also recovered. Of the 68 shovel tests excavated at 10
m grid intercepts surrounding the above area, 28 were culturally positive and yielded 42 glass shards, 139
metal artifacts, 4 ceramic sherds, 15 mortar fragments, 1 slate fragment, and 2 charcoal fragments. One
piece of non-diagnostic lithic debitage was also recovered.
Most artifact categories were recovered in greater frequencies from the immediate vicinity of the standing
structure, where shovel tests were excavated at 5 m grid intercepts. Metal artifacts, however, were slightly
more frequent in the area surrounding the immediate vicinity of the standing structure, where shovel tests
were excavated at 10 m grid intercepts. Most of the metal artifacts recovered from the former area came
from just two shovel tests. Metal artifacts were more evenly distributed in the latter area, though most were
recovered from the east half of the site.

Units
Two 1 x 1 m units were excavated at 41BP594 in an attempt to recover temporally diagnostic artifacts to
determine the occupation date range of the site. Units were located in areas of high artifact density
determined through shovel testing.
Unit 1
Unit 1 was excavated immediately north of shovel test 123, near the depression east of the structure. The
unit was excavated to 60 cm below ground surface and terminated at clay subsoil. Artifacts recovered from
Unit 1 include 1 handmade brick fragment, 1 piece of cement mortar, 4 historic ceramics, 3 charcoal
fragments, 1 unidentifiable faunal bone fragment, 50 glass shards, and 68 ferrous metal artifacts, 2 chert
debitage, and 1 thermally altered rock.
Unit 2
Unit 2 was excavated immediately east of shovel test 31, beneath the large oak trees present at the site. The
unit was excavated to 20 cm below ground surface and terminated at clay subsoil. Artifacts recovered from
Unit 2 included 47 brick fragments, 2 pieces of lime mortar, 10 historic ceramics sherds, 1 porcelain doll
arm, 77 shards of glass, 1 glass marble, 1 charcoal fragment, 1 white tailed deer bone fragment, 43 metal
artifacts including 1 lead alloy and 1 copper button and ferrous and copper bullets, and 1 unidentified
artifact.
ARTIFACT ASSEMBLAGE ANALYSIS
In sum, 1,020 specimens were collected during NRHP testing at site 41BP594 (Appendix D 41BP594
Specimen Inventory). From this number, 998 specimens were identified as artifacts and 22 were identified
as ecofacts. The majority of artifacts (n=985; 98 percent) are associated with the nineteenth and twentieth
century occupation of the site. Several artifacts consist of lithic material that may be aboriginal in origin
and may be prehistoric in age (n=6, less than 1 percent). The remaining artifacts are of uncertain time period
and may date to either the historic or prehistoric era (n=7, less than 1 percent). The ecofacts recovered from
the site are believed to date to the historic occupation due to their recovery context. These include food
residue (n=22), such as faunal bone fragments (n=13); and charcoal samples (3.07 g).
Prehistoric Artifact Assemblage
Chipped stone artifacts comprise the prehistoric artifacts recovered from 41BP594. One formal tool and
five nontools were identified from within the assemblage. The single formal tool is a Scallorn arrow point
(Lot 55). The remaining chipped stone artifacts are non-tools or debitage. A total of five flakes were
produced from chert (n=3), and thermally altered chert (n=2). None of the debitage exhibited evidence of
utilization or modification.
The Scallorn arrow point was formed from fine grained 10YR 7/2 light gray chert. It is 17 mm in length by
12 mm in width by 3.5 mm in thickness. The stem is 5.9 mm in length. The lateral margins are slightly
concave and sharp, suggesting that the point was re-sharpened prior to discard. It has corner notches and an
expanding stem. The base is flat and nearly as broad as the shoulder barbs. Scallorn points date to the Austin
Phase of the Late Prehistoric period, roughly from A.D. 700 to A.D. 1200 (Turner and Hester 1993).

Summary
The ephemeral nature of the prehistoric assemblage is indicative of a short duration occupation during the
prehistoric period. The Scallorn arrow point suggests the occupation occurred during the Austin Phase of
the Late Prehistoric Period
Historic Artifact Assemblage Analysis
A total of 985 historic artifacts were recovered from the site and categorized by function into seven groups.
Table 8 presents the functional groups and the total number of artifacts assigned to each group. The historic
artifact assemblage is discussed within the framework of these artifact groups; however, when possible,
contextual interpretations are offered concerning how these materials might have been used.

Activities (n=6; less than 1 percent)
The Activities Group includes items that may have been utilized by multiple occupants at the site during
various pursuits. This group includes six artifacts that were classified as either toys or miscellaneous.
Activities related artifacts include one marble fragment, one porcelain doll fragment, and four fragments of
slate. No specimens within this group exhibited evidence of burning.
Toys
The marble type recovered was produced using an early machine method, which is indicated by a swirling
pattern close to the surface of the marble. This technique is known as a transitional machine-made process,
which generally dates from 1901 to 1926 (Randall 1971). The porcelain doll fragment consisted of a molded
arm.

73

Miscellaneous
Miscellaneous activity items include four fragments of slate, which were possibly utilized as part of a slate,
chalk board.
SUMMARY
The artifacts assigned to the Activities Group are consistent with a domestic occupation dating from the
nineteenth century and extending into the early twentieth century. The toys are associated with leisure time
activities of children, while fragments of a slate board indicate possible educational activities.
Agriculture (n=33; 3 percent)
The Agriculture Group includes items employed in animal husbandry and farming. All artifacts within this
category, with the exception of a terra cotta pot fragment, were formed from ferrous alloy and were
recovered in mostly incomplete forms. No specimens within this group exhibited evidence of burning.
Animal Husbandry
Objects relating to animal husbandry at site 41BP594 consist of fence wire fragments and fence staples.
The predominant use for any type of fencing would have been for agricultural purposes, such as the
containment of livestock.
Horticulture
A single terra cotta pot fragment is suggestive of raising flora in a contained location. Terra cotta pottery is
not temporally diagnostic.
SUMMARY
While the Agriculture artifact assemblage is not temporally sensitive, the use contexts of the artifacts are
consistent with a late-nineteenth to early-twentieth century farmstead occupation. The Agriculture artifacts,
such as the fence staples, are indicative of materials and tools involved with animal husbandry and farming
activities during that time period.
Architecture (n=387; 39 percent)
The Architecture Group includes structural materials, such as brick, mortar, and window glass; construction
hardware, such as nails and bolts; and interior finishing items, such as hinges. A single machine made brick
fragment within this group exhibited evidence of burning.
Structural Materials
Bricks
The 112 brick fragments recovered from site 41BP594 include handmade and machine made varieties.
Handmade brick fragments total 103 specimens (352.14 grams [g]), and range in color from reddish brown
(n=41, 39.64g), reddish yellow (n=59, 98.36g) to white (n=3, 214.14g). Machine made brick fragments
total ten specimens (417.05 g), and range in color from dark reddish brown (n=5, 4.18g), reddish brown
(n=3, 12.87g) to white (n=2, 400.00g). A single machine made brick exhibited an alkaline glaze. While no
makerâs marks were observed, in Texas machine-made bricks generally began replacing hand-made bricks
in construction around 1900 (Steinbomer 1982).

Three Oaks Mine, Bastrop County, Texas

Mortar
Mortar recovered from the site had an off white, sandy paste. A total of 18 specimens were recovered
totaling 146.79 g. All recovered mortar was highly fragmented, and displayed no evidence of burning.
Window Glass
Window glass belongs to the structural materials subcategory of the Architecture Group. A total of 24 flat
glass shards were identified as window pane fragments. Aqua-tint shards (n=7) and colorless shards (n=17)
were both recovered from site 41BP594. Recovery of flat glass less than 3.2 mm in width indicates that at
least one structure at the site contained paned windows.
Construction Hardware
Nails
A total of 204 nails and nail fragments were recovered and assigned to the Construction Hardware
subcategory of the Architecture Group. Nails recovered from site 41BP594 were fragmentary and heavily
rusted, which prohibited identification of any characteristics other than their basic manufacturing
techniques. Cut nails (n=63) and wire nails (n=112) were recovered. A total of 29 specimens could not be
confidently attributed to either manufacturing category. A total of 30 nails were complete and the rest were
fragmentary. Additionally, 14 lead roofing nail caps were also recovered.
Miscellaneous
Bolts (n=3), screws (n=2), and an S-bracket (n=1) were recovered from the site, which are assumed to
represent a portion of the architectural component. These items are not temporally sensitive and could date
to either the historic or modern era.
Interior Finishing Items
Miscellaneous
Other items, which can be interpreted as finishing items within the Architecture Group, include hinges and
hinge fragments (n=7), and a single tack. Many of these items could date to either the historic or modern
period.
SUMMARY
Temporally diagnostic architectural remains at site 41BP594 provide production date ranges that span the
period from 1790 to the present. The predominance of handmade bricks suggest significant building
activities prior to the turn of the nineteenth century, with improvements, repairs or additions undertaken
into the first half of the twentieth century (Steinbomer 1982). Identifiable nails recovered from the site are
predominantly wire, suggesting construction activities were concentrated after around 1890 (Edwards and
Wells 1993). In summary, the Architecture Group suggests building activities may have occurred prior to
1900, but the many materials dating to the first half of the twentieth century indicate continued construction
activities.
Arms (n=3; less than 1 percent)
The Arms Group includes artifacts involved with the utilization of munitions. Artifacts assigned to the
Arms Group include three cartridge cases. No specimens within this group exhibited evidence of burning.

Cartridge Cases
Cartridge cases recovered from site 41BP594 consist of rimfire (n=1) and centerfire (n=2) cases. The rimfire
case is a spent .22 caliber cartridge made of brass of an indeterminate length. Rimfire .22 caliber cases have
been in production since 1857, and due to the absence of a headstamp, this cartridge has a very wide
temporal range. The two centerfire cases are both spent 16 gauge. The solid head cases exhibited a makerâs
mark associated with the Western Cartridge Company and their line of Field shells were produced from
1923 until around 1965, while the other displays a âRomaxâ stamp by the U.S. Cartridge Company, which
was in production from 1879 to 1931 (Stadt 1984).
SUMMARY
The Arms Group artifacts recovered from the site could have been produced from 1857 to the present. The
majority of the temporally sensitive items, however, date from the late nineteenth century into the 1930s.
Clothing (n=5, less than 1 percent)
Artifacts attributed to the Clothing Group include clothing fasteners, such as a buttons (n=3), and shoe
parts, such as nails (n=2). No specimens within this group exhibited evidence of burning.
Buttons
Three buttons were recovered from the site including a snap button, stud button, and an indeterminate type
rubber button. The snap button is a âGripperâ type, which was introduced in 1930 by Scovill. The stud
button, also known as the âoverall typeâ is commonly on menâs work clothing, such as overalls in the
twentieth century (Pool 1991). The rubber button also exhibited a makerâs mark; however, the lettering was
illegible and fragmentary.
Shoes
Two shoe nails were recovered. The type is identified as a heel nail and it likely secured a stacked heel.
SUMMARY
Artifacts attributed to the Clothing Group could date from the mid nineteenth century through the early
twentieth century. While the rubber button is likely nineteenth century, the snap button was definitively
produced after 1930 and is still in production today. This possibly suggests an occupation spanning both
centuries.
Household (n=32; 3 percent)
This group includes items that are commonly found within a domicile and are presumed to have been
utilized by multiple occupants at the site. Artifacts recovered belonging to the Household Group at site
41BP594 include lighting items. No specimens within this group exhibited evidence of burning.
Lighting Items
Lighting items recovered from the site consist of glass chimney lamp fragments and brass oil lamp parts. A
total of 29 colorless and 2 solarized glass shards were recovered, one of which consists of a chimney base
with a scalloped edge. All chimney lamp glass is presumably associated with kerosene lanterns, which
required drafting in order to burn. A single lamp burner was recovered from the site. Kerosene lanterns

Three Oaks Mine, Bastrop County, Texas

were generally in use between 1860 and 1880 (Spillman 1983), which is consistent with the June 23, 1863,
patent date stamped on the burner.
SUMMARY
Few household items were recovered at site 41BP594. The presence of gas-burning lantern parts provide
evidence for domestic occupation as early as 1863. Overall, the household assemblage, while not highly
temporally sensitive, suggests a small domestic occupation during the late nineteenth century.
Kitchen (n=354; 36 percent)
The Kitchen Group includes subcategories of artifacts related to food preparation, storage, and
consumption. These artifacts include ceramic vessel fragments and glass container fragments. Fourteen
specimens within this group exhibited evidence of burning.
Ceramics
A total of 40 ceramic sherds belonging to the Kitchen Group were recovered, including ironstone (n=18),
porcelain (n=8), redware (n=1), and stoneware (n=13). These specimens represent vessels designed for use
as tableware and storageware. Decoration is evident on seven ceramic sherds and two sherds exhibit
makerâs marks. Although some sherds were undecorated, it is possible these specimens belonged to blank
portions of decorated vessels. Three ceramic sherds exhibited evidence of burning.
Redware
One body sherd had a coarse red paste with an Albany-like slip on both the interior and exterior. It was too
fragmentary to assign a vessel form.
Stoneware
Stoneware is the second most common ware type recovered from site 41BP594 (n=13). The sherds and
sherdlets could not be confidently assigned to either vessel category or form. Stoneware fragments
recovered at the site are all body sherds with the exception of one sherdlet. Stoneware is frequently treated
with a glaze or slip, however less commonly decorated. At site 41BP594, only three variations of glazes
and/or slips are present. The most frequently occurring surface treatment to stoneware at site 41BP594
consists of a Bristol glaze on the exterior and interior (n=11), followed by a single instance of an Albanylike slip and a salt glaze. All stoneware sherds are undecorated and unmarked.
Refined Earthenware
Ironstone
Ironstone was the most common ware type present on site. Among the 18 sherds, 14 are undecorated, 4 are
decorated, and 2 are marked. Decorative techniques include decalcomania (n=2); molding (n=1), and
gilding (n=1). The partial makerâs marks were not identified, but it likely that both date to after 1891 due
to the presence of the word â(M)adeâ indicating production after the McKinley Tariff Act. One mark
exhibited a British Royal Coat of Arms, which suggests either an English or American manufacturer. The
sherds could not be definitely assigned to either vessel category or form. Ironstone sherds comprised 3 rim
sherds, 10 body sherds, and 5 base sherds.

Porcelain
Porcelain sherds are the least frequently occurring ware type at the site. A total of 8 sherds were recovered,
the majority of which were undecorated (n=6). However, one sherd exhibited gilding and another
decalcomania. No vessel categories were assigned due to the fragmentary nature of the porcelain
assemblage. However, bodies (n=2), rims (n=2), bases (n=2), and sherdlets (n=2) were all present.
Glass
Kitchen container glass (n=314) includes fragments of vessel glass (n=227), bottles (n=78), jars (n=1), and
jar lid liners (n=8). Numerous artifacts representing each vessel form were recovered and consist of rim
shards, body shards, and base shards. (Table 9). A total of 11 glass shards exhibit evidence of burning.
Multiple attributes of glass containers can be temporally sensitive and can include color, technological
characteristics, decorations, and manufacturing marks.

Color
Glass colors present at the site include amber, aquamarine, aqua-tint, cobalt, colorless, dark amber, green,
green-tint, olive, and opaline (Table 10). Colorless glass also includes the subcategory, solarized glass, or
sun-colored amethyst. A total of 76 shards of solarized glass were recovered. Of these colors, the most
temporally sensitive is solarized glass, which dates from around 1890 to 1920, and dark amber, or black
glass, which was not commonly produced after 1880 (SHA 2013).

Technological Attributes
Technological attributes of historic glass containers encompass a wide variety of characteristics, and in
many cases, relate closely to the manner in which the container was produced. Temporally sensitive features
include bubbles, suction scars, and finishes.
Bubbles
Air bubble inclusions were observed in 120 shards of container glass, accounting for roughly one third of
the assemblage. These inclusions are the result of irregularities in the production process, which were all
but successfully eliminated by 1920 (Polack 2000).
Suction Scars
One suction scar was observed within the glass assemblage. Suction scars are characteristic marks produced
by the Owens Automatic Bottle Making Machine. Bottles produced with suction scars generally post date
1910 and predate 1947 (SHA 2013 ). The fragmentary nature of many bottle bases or perhaps a dearth of
recovered glass from this time period may account for the lack of this diagnostic feature.
Finishes
A total of 14 rim specimens from bottles and jars retained portions of the finishes, of which only eight are
identifiable. Four different finishes are present within the assemblage, while only two methods of
production were noted. The finishes identified are bead (n=2), brandy (n=1), crown (n=1), external
continuous thread (n=2), and packer (n=2). All of these types are present on bottles with the exception of
the continuous thread. These finishes are not highly temporally sensitive as most were used from the
nineteenth to twentieth centuries.
The two methods of finish production present at the site include tooled finishes (n=6), and machine made
finishes (n=2). Tooled finishing is still employed on specialty bottles, while fully machine made finishes
post date 1905 and most likely 1915 (SHA 2013).
Decorations
A total of 43 glass shards exhibited molded characteristics beyond makerâs marks, which can be considered
decorative elements. Decorative treatments to glass containers within the Kitchen Group include applied
color labels (n=1), embossing (n=9), and molding (n=33). Embossing and molding are common decorative

techniques; however, a proprietary mark for âMcLeanâs Strengthening Cordial,â dates this particular shard
from circa 1865 to 1906 with the passing of the Pure Food and Drug Act. The single shard with the applied
color label dates to the 1930s or after.
Makerâs Marks
Five partial makerâs marks were present on the bases of glass bottles and jars. Only a single mark could be
identified and indicated production by the Anchor Hocking Glass Corporation after 1938 (Toulousse 1971).
The other marks could not be attributed to particular glass houses, but likely date to after 1905.
Secondary Modifications
Glass recovered from the site was historically manufactured, but some was modified intentionally, or
chipped, to form sharp edges. Worked glass at the site consists of two glass shards within the same context.
The shards are from two distinctly different containers, one being a solarized body fragment from an
indeterminate vessel type, and the second being a dark amber body fragment of a bottle. Both shards were
unifacially chipped along one lateral edge. Macroscopic examination revealed wear patterns along this edge
consistent with sawing of a medium soft material.
SUMMARY
The kitchen material suggests that the site dates primarily to the twentieth century. Diagnostic ceramic
materials imply that the site could have been occupied as early as 1852, based on the presence of ironstone
and some salt-glazed stoneware; however a lack of contemporaneous and earlier wares suggest a later date
as evidenced by a predominance of decorations and makerâs marks dated to after 1890. Decorative varieties
encountered on ceramic wares, such as decal ware and gilding, are consistent with occupation into the midto late-twentieth century. Glass containers at the site further support a substantial occupation period dating
after 1900 as evidenced by diagnostic colors dated mostly after 1920. However, the predominance of handtooled finishes versus fully machine made vessels suggests manufacture of several bottles before 1905 and
likely 1920, while the single makerâs marks dates to after 1938. In summary, the whole of the Kitchen
Group appears to represent a primary occupation from around the end of the nineteenth century into the
mid twentieth century.
Automotive (n=1, less than 1 percent)
One fragment of a rubber tire was recovered from the site. The tire fragment was likely from a vehicle or
mobile machinery and dates to the twentieth century.
Unknown (n=164, 16 percent)
A total of 164 artifacts recovered were unknown or too fragmentary to confidently assign them to any one
of the functional groups including metal fragments (n=163) and an unknown material (n=1). Additionally
six pieces of thermally altered rock (totaling 3.2g) consisting of silicified wood and chert were recovered.

SUMMARY
The 302 artifacts within the Unknown Group could not be assigned to particular functional groups either
due to incompleteness or lack of distinguishing characteristics; however their presence at the site is
consistent with the range of other historic artifacts found at the site.
Historic Artifact Assemblage Analysis Summary
All of the temporally sensitive materials recovered on site reflect a historic occupation from the late
nineteenth century into the early twentieth century. The Architecture Group suggests an emphasis on
building activities after the turn of the twentieth century, while the other artifact groups confirm an
occupation of multiple individuals, beginning before 1900 but primarily after this time. The historic artifacts
recovered from the site include common and widely available materials. The artifact assemblage as a whole
reflects activities consistent with occupation of a late nineteenth century to early twentieth century working
farmstead with a domestic component.
DISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The results of shovel testing and hand unit excavation on site 41BP594 suggest that significant buried
cultural deposits have not been preserved. The assemblage of artifacts recovered during testing contains
few temporally sensitive items. This assemblage is mixed and distinct occupations cannot be isolated. For
these reasons, the archeological deposits on site are unlikely to yield information important to local patterns
of history and do not warrant NRHP inclusion under Criterion D.
The standing structure on site 41BP594 has been determined to be eligible for NRHP listing under Criterion
D and as a contributing element of a rural historic district (Penick 2001, Martin 2001). For this reason it is
recommended that impact to the standing structure be avoided. If this is not possible it is recommended that
negative impacts stemming from mine related development be mitigated through additional research, such
as producing elevation drawings and dismantling the walls to investigate building techniques, following a
research design approved by the THC.

SITE 41BP595 EXCAVATION RESULTS
SETTING AND PREVIOUS INVESTIGATION
Site 41BP595 is situated on a ridge summit and shoulder at an elevation that ranges between 510 and 520
feet msl (see Figure 3). The nearest source of water is an unnamed tributary to Big Sandy Creek, located
about 225 m west of the site. The soil on site is Robco loamy fine sand, 1 to 5 percent slopes (United States
Department of Agriculture/National Resources Conservation Service [USDA/NRCS] 2013). These soils
are deep, moderately well drained, and formed in upland loamy sediments on Pleistocene terrace deposits
and are moderately acid (USDA/NRCS 2013). The surface geology on site consists of the Eocene aged
Calvert Bluff Formation (Ecb), which is âmostly mudstone with various amounts of sandstone, lignite,
ironstone concretions, and in the uppermost part locally glauconiticâ (Proctor et al. 1981). The siteâs
topographic setting suggests it has not been subject to significant aggradation since it was abandoned
prehistorically, as sedimentary sources appear to be limited to colluvial deposition from slightly higher
portions of the landform and Aeolian deposition.
The site covers approximately 32,000 square meters (m2). Its maximum dimensions are 160 m east-west by
200 m north-south. Shovel testing during the present investigation revealed yellowish brown fine sandy
loam extending more than 100 cm in depth on the top of the landform. Below the summit the soil was more
variable in depth and strong brown clay was encountered below the fine sandy loam at depths ranging
between 25 and 100 cm. Most of the site was vegetated with tall weedy grasses with oaks, cedar, and
mesquite along the periphery (Figures 9 and 10). Ground surface visibility was less than 10 percent.
A total of 29 shovel tests were excavated when the site was originally recorded (Turpin 2003), of which 14
were culturally positive, yielding 18 pieces of lithic debitage, 2 utilized flakes, and 8 fragments of burned
rock between 0 and 110 cmbs. A possible hearth was exposed in the southern quarter of the site in Shovel
Test 10, between 50 and 60 cmbs (Turpin 2003).

SHOVEL TESTING
Shovel testing was undertaken in two phases during the current investigation (Figure 11). Initially, 85
shovel tests were excavated at 20-m grid intercepts to define the limits of the site and identify potential
artifact high density and diversity areas. Of these shovel tests, 66 yielded cultural material that was
presumably deposited during the prehistoric period and included 3 chipped stone tools, 38 ground stone
fragments, 202 lithic nontools, 10 botanical charcoal fragments, and 103 pieces of thermally altered rock.
One shovel test yielded a single historic artifact (an unidentified fragment of painted metal). The remaining
18 shovel tests were culturally sterile.
The most common classes of cultural material recovered during the first phase of shovel testing include
lithic nontools, ground stone, and thermally altered rock. The lithic nontool recovery rate ranged from 1 to
16 specimens for each shovel positive for this material class, with an average of 3.42 and a standard
deviation of 3.49. Eight shovel tests (4, 18, 22, 24, 37, 38, 53, and 58) had lithic nontool recovery rates
more than one standard deviation above the mean. The recovery rate for ground stone fragments ranged
from 1 to 6 for each shovel test positive for this material class and averaged 1.8 with a standard deviation
of 1.29. Two shovel tests (6 and 38) had ground stone recovery rates more than one standard deviation
above the mean. Between 1 and 8 fragments of thermally altered rock were recovered from each shovel test
positive for this class of material with an average of 3.12 and a standard deviation of 4.0. A total of four
shovel tests (4, 36, 53, and 55) had thermally altered rock recovery rates more than one standard deviation
above the mean.
During the second phase of shovel testing, an additional 65 shovel tests were excavated at 10-m grid
intercepts around shovel tests excavated during the first phase that yielded ten or more artifacts (based on
field counts), pieces of fire-cracked rock, or fragments of botanical charcoal. All of the shovel tests
excavated during this phase were culturally positive and yielded 6 chipped stone tools, 30 ground stone
fragments, 383 lithic nontools, 2 faunal bone fragments, 20 botanical charcoal fragments, and 300 pieces
of thermally altered rock.
Eight of the nine chipped stone tools recovered through shovel testing are expedient tools, representing
either utilized flakes or unifacially modified flakes. The remaining chipped stone tool is a small biface
fragment. Fragments from ground stone tools are more than seven times as common as chipped stone tools,
suggesting that grinding activities were much more common than cutting activities on site.
DISTRIBUTION OF CULTURAL MATERIALS
The distribution of the most common classes of cultural material (debitage, ground stone fragments, and
thermally altered rock) presumably better reflects the range of cultural and natural processes that have
resulted in the current expression of the archeological record than less common classes of cultural material.
The distributions of the other classes of cultural material recovered are thought to be less reliable indicators
of post-abandonment processes due to sample size.
Cultural material was recovered from throughout the vertical column, from 0 to 110 cmbs. The vertical
distribution of the various classes of cultural material, however, differed (Table 11). Lithic nontools were

concentrated in the upper part of the vertical column and gradually became less concentrated with depth.
Thermally altered rock fragments were fairly evenly distributed from 0 to 100 cmbs but were concentrated
in Levels 6, 7, and 8 (50â80 cmbs). Ground stone fragments were fairly evenly distributed throughout the
vertical column but were somewhat concentrated in Levels 6 (50â60 cmbs) and 8 (70â80 cmbs).

These patterns presumably resulted in part from a variety of post-abandonment turbative processes,
including rodent and root activity, which can foster vertical artifact migration. The siteâs topographic setting
on a ridge summit and shoulder suggest sedimentary sources are limited to colluvium from slightly higher
slope elements or possibly Aeolian deposition. Consequently, it appears unlikely that the concentration of
thermally altered rock and ground stone fragments in Levels 6 through 8 (50â80 cmbs) resulted from
substantial post-abandonment aggradation. This is because larger cultural clastics, such as burned rock, are
more likely to migrate down as a result of faunal turbation than smaller materials, such as lithic nontools,
which are more likely to migrate both up and down the vertical column (Bocek 1986). The slight
concentration of lithic nontools near the top of the vertical column is consistent with this conclusion.
Cultural materials were unevenly distributed across the site and were found to be concentrated in three
isolable artifact high density and diversity areas, referred to as areas 1, 2, and 3 (see Figure 11). The
boundaries of these areas were defined by the presence of adjacent shovel tests with high densities of at
least one class of cultural material, represented by yields that were more than one standard deviation above
the mean. Positive shovel tests that were surrounded on at least three sides by high density positive shovel
tests were included within subsite areas.
Area 1 is the northern most area and is vaguely âUâ shaped. It is roughly 90 m east to west and 25 m north
to south. Area 2 is to the southeast of Area 1 and extends about 100 m north to south by 75 m east to west.
Area 3 is southwest of Area 1 and is about 60 m east to west by 33 m north to south.
The material assemblages recovered from each of the site areas are essentially the same. The average
density of cultural materials from each site area (number of specimens/shovel tests) is presented in
Table 12. Site areas 1 and 3 both had 15 shovel tests and identical densities of chipped stone tools, ground

stone, and botanical charcoal, and nearly identical densities of thermally altered rock. Area 3, however, had
the highest density of lithic nontools, with an average of 9.733 lithic nontools per shovel test. With 25
shovel tests, site Area 2 was also the largest subsite area. Area 2 had the highest density of ground stone,
with an average of 0.840 specimens per shovel test, and botanical charcoal, with an average of 0.40
specimens per shovel test. Chipped stone tools were much more common in Area 2 than the other site areas,
though any conclusions based on this observation must be considered with caution due to sample size.
The narrow range of cultural materials present within each of the site areas suggest each resulted in part
from similarly narrow ranges of systemic activities. The larger size of Area 2 relative to the other site areas
suggests it may have been utilized more intensively than the other site areas. The presence of faunal bone
fragments in the Area 2 assemblage, along with a higher density of botanical charcoal, suggest subsistence
remains may be better preserved in Area 2, possibly because Area 2 represents, in part, a more recent
occupation.

A dark, organically rich, soil deposit was recorded in an east to west trending band of shovel tests (36, 37,
86, and 87) in Area 2. The dark soil was encountered as shallow as 30 cmbs in Shovel Tests 86 and 87 but
was not encountered until 70 cmbs in Shovel Test 36. It was encountered at 50 cmbs in Shovel Tests 37
and 88. The darkened soil typically extended to the bottom of the shovel tests from where it was first
identified. The origins of the organically rich soil deposit are presumably anthrogenic and associated with
subsistence processing.
The concentration of botanical charcoal, thermally altered rock, and ground stone in each of the three subsite
areas, suggest they resulted in part from activities associated with subsistence processing. These findings
also indicate that cultural features may have been preserved within each site area, particularly in the
southern half of Area 2, in the vicinity of shovel tests (37, 92, and 94) that yielded concentrations of
charcoal, and adjacent shovel tests (36 and 88) that yielded concentrations of thermally altered rock.

TRENCH EXCAVATION
As noted above, 20 trenches were excavated in an effort to identify cultural features (see Figure 11).
Trenches ranged in length between 4.5 m and 19.5 m and averaged 9.95 m. Trench excavation proceeded
until one of the following conditions was met 1) cultural features were encountered, 2) the clay Bt horizon
was encountered, or 3) a depth between 100 and 130 cm was achieved. A total of 30 features were exposed
during trenching. Of these 28 were burned rock features, one (Feature 4) was a concentration of unburned

The concentration of features in areas 2 and 3 suggest both areas resulted from intensive utilization. The
range of materials recovered from each of the areas is consistent with this interpretation.
Temporally diagnostic projectile points along with a representative sample of the lithic tools exposed
through trenching were retained. During the course of testing, trench backdirt piles were periodically
inspected for these materials, especially following rains. As a result of this effort, nineteen artifacts were
recovered including 7 dart points or dart point fragments, 2 arrow points or point fragments, 4 lithic bifaces,
1 utilized flake, 1 uniface, 1 lithic core, 2 ground stone artifacts, and 1 projectile point fragment. These
materials are listed in Table 14 below by trench provenience. Where possible, type assignments are also
provided.

Based on the distribution of temporally sensitive lithic artifacts, it appears that areas 1 and 3 saw the earliest
occupations on site. Two late Paleoindian Scottsbluff points were recovered from Area 1, along with an untyped lanceolate dart point. The presence of both arrow points and dart points in Area 2 suggests it
represents the most intensively utilized portion of the site.

A GEOARCHEOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF FEATURE 30, AREA 2, AT SITE 41BP595
by
Charles Frederick and Brittney Gregory
Introduction
This section reports the results of geoarcheological investigation of Feature 30, located by shovel testing
within Area 2 at site 41BP595. The work has focused on identifying whether this feature is a natural or
anthrogenic feature, and how it has been buried.
Setting
The site is located in an upland setting characterized by gently rolling hills with about 50 to 100 feet of
local relief and is part of the Big Sandy Creek drainage basin. Big Sandy Creek is a tributary of the Colorado
River and joins it just upstream of Bastrop. It drains the northern side of the Colorado River basin
immediately west and north of Bastrop.
The site is underlain by the Eocene age Calvert Bluff Formation of the Wilcox Group (BEG 1974). The
Wilcox Group comprises a body of fluvial-deltaic sediment and contains depositional facies typical of large
lowland rivers, such as sandy channels, floodplain muds and floodbasin peats which through diagenesis
have been transformed into lignite.
Soils
The gently rolling upland landscape is draped by sandy soils formed from weathering and subsequent
erosion and re-deposition of the fluvial-deltaic sands and muds of the Wilcox Group. In broad, general
terms these sandy soils are known as texture-contrast soils and are characterized by two parts that differ
significantly in terms of texture and appearance (Phillips 2007). The upper portion of such soils is
comprised of fine, loose sand, whereas the lower part of the soil is typically a firm sandy clay or sandy clay
loam which is typically red or mottled red. The formation of this type of soil is the subject of considerable
debate among soil scientists as well as archeologists. Among soil scientists, the debate hinges on whether
the subsoil formed from the weathering of the upper sandy part of the soil, or is an older sedimentary deposit
unrelated to it. Archeological concerns share this interest, but further consider the manner in which the
unconsolidated sands are moved and disturbed, which has significant implications for the integrity of the
cultural deposits contained within the sands. Although the paradox of texture contrast soils is often
discussed as an either/or scenario, it is a potential problem in equifinality as both scenarios undoubtedly
occur and discerning which for any given pedon is a complex problem.
The soil upon the hilltop occupied by the site is currently mapped as the Robco loamy fine sand (NRCS
2013a), but this soil was originally mapped as the Demona fine sand (Baker 1979). The Official Soil Series
Description for the Demona series (NRCS 2013b) describes the soils as occurring âon uplands with mixed
concave and convex surfacesâ and that these soils âhave formed mainly in the basal sands and sandy clays
of Cretaceous age that have been reworked by windâ. The Demona series description in Baker (1979) makes
no mention of wind alteration of the soil and the age of the parent material cited is clearly incorrect here.
The same can be said for the official description of the Robco series which is described as âformed in loamy
National Register Testing at Sites 41BP585, 41BP594, and 41BP595
Three Oaks Mine, Bastrop County, Texas

91

sediments on Pleistocene terrace deposits about 35 to 100 feet above present streams or local outwash
colluvial plainsâ (NRCS 2013c).
Immediately east of the hilltop is a saddle that lies between the site and a slightly higher hill immediately
to the east; this saddle acts as a local drainage divide and has low order drainages that flow to the north and
south away from the saddle. The headwaters of both of these small streams are eroded and support numerous
small gullies that expose the reddened subsoil. The soils mapped in this area are the Crockett, Tabor and
Edge (but originally mapped as the Axtell) series. The upland to the east of this hill is again mapped, like
the site as the Robco series, and the Padina fine sand (originally mapped by Baker 1979 as the Patilo
complex). Interestingly, the Patilo complex is described by Baker (1979:22) as consisting of âdeep, gently
sloping to strongly sloping, moderately drained sandy soilsâ¦formed in thick, sandy and loamy material
that appears to be reworked by windâ.
Research Questions
As noted earlier, the primary research question driving this work was What is the origin and burial
mechanism of the organic-rich deposit in Area 2 (in the vicinity of shovel tests 36, 37, 86, and 87). This
matrix-defined buried organic-rich deposit identified near the hill summit is enigmatic for this landscape
and it is critical to determine, if possible, if this is a natural, or anthrogenic feature, and if the latter,
prehistoric or modern. There are several possible scenarios that can explain this deposit: 1) ancient gully
fill; 2) gleyed sediment on top of the argillic horizon; 3) an ancient anthrogenic deposit (or midden); 4)
historic burn/bulldozer push feature. Although other scenarios exist, these are considered the most likely
and are amenable to geoarcheolgical examination and testing.
Ancient gully
Although it is unusual to encounter evidence of gullies in this landscape position, gullies are common in
east Texas sandy mantle landscapes and often fill with homogeneous sandy sediment. If this is a gully, the
basal and lateral margins will be abrupt, most likely cut into the argillic horizon, and the infilling sediment
may exhibit evidence of sedimentary stratification or sedimentary structures. Furthermore, the edges of the
organic-enriched deposit will respect the margins of the gully feature.
Gleyed Sediment
The soils associated with sandy mantle landscapes in East Texas typically exhibit prominent changes at the
interface between the subsoil argillic (or Bt) horizon and the overlying unconsolidated sand. The Bt horizon
generally has much lower permeability than the overlying sands and acts as an aquaclude and thereby
promotes lateral flow of water within the soil, but it is possible that weathering of the Bt horizon could
create a topographically low spot on top of the argillic horizon that would favor local waterlogging and
gleying rather than leaching and lateral flow. If this is the case, the deposit above the Bt horizon (and
possibly the top of the Bt horizon) will be dark colored but not owing to increased organic matter but
associated with reduction of the iron minerals in the soil (or gleying). Gleyed sediment will also have a very
low magnetic susceptibility, and will respect the margins of a depression formed at the top of the Bt horizon.

Ancient Anthrogenic Sediment (a midden or floor of structure)
Human subsistence activities are known to result in concentrated refuse deposits that generally have a dark
color, increased organic matter content, and elevated artifact frequency. In Texas, prehistoric refuse
middens are generally associated with discard of refuse on the ground surface and are only buried when
natural landscape processes cover them with slopewash (colluvium) or eolian sediment. The landscape
position of this deposit precludes a colluvial burial mechanism. Although the feature is not on the summit,
the amount of slope above it is insufficient to explain the degree of burial observed in the shovel tests.
Burial of a matrix-defined feature by pedoturbation is unlikely (especially if it is sitting on top of the Bt
horizon) for burial could only occur if âcleanâ (not organic enriched) sand was transported from below it
to above it (an upward biotransfer in the jargon of Donald Johnson (see Johnson et al., 2005) or laterally
translocated. Lateral translocation in such low slope areas are uncommon, although have been argued to be
the dominant process by which mima (or pimple) mounds form (cf. Horwath and Johnson 2012; 2006)
although to our knowledge there are no such landforms present on the site). Alternatively, local burial by
eolian reworking may be possible, and if so, the deposits burying the organic-rich deposit should exhibit
slightly different textural properties than the sand at depth away from the buried organic-rich deposit.
Although the size of the anomalous feature is large for a structure, burial of house floors by sediment is
common in structures that included sediment in the superstructure (such as adobe or earth plastered timber
buildings; cf. Quigg et al. 2013). Although rare, these are not unheard of in Texas. If this is the case, then
there should be some evidence in the deposit of the use of finer textured sediment on top of the organicrich deposit. The sandy sediment by itself is too coarse textured for use as a plaster without the addition of
some finer material. Second, the margins of the organic-rich deposit should be sharply defined, will most
likely be inset into a shallow depression, and may exhibit enhanced magnetic susceptibility, organic matter
and phosphorus. Obviously, the age of the included charcoal would be ancient rather than modern.
Recent Anthrogenic Sediment
The apparent linear nature, presence of charcoal in this deposit, and buried position on a hill top may be a
stratigraphic manifestation of twentieth century land clearance aided by a bull dozer. If this is the origin of
the deposit, it will have sharply defined lower and lateral edges, and may exhibit fill structures and crude
stratification and rounded clods. The age of any charcoal will reflect the age of the standing forest (up to a
couple of hundreds of years old).
Data Requirements
In order to test which hypothesis is most likely, several types of samples and exposures are desirable.
a. Cross-section exposure of the organic-rich buried feature in Area 2 that clearly exposes the upper and
lower boundaries as well as the lateral margins, preferably accomplished by means of a trench.
b. Sample columns derived from inside and immediately outside the organic-rich buried feature in Area
2 that would permit clear comparison of the deposits.
c. Sample column(s) from slope settings below the hill summit (like Area 3) that permit comparison of
the sand above the argillic horizon in various catenary (slope) relationships

d. Samples collected should include a column of paleomagnetic sample boxes (to be used for
granulometry, magnetic susceptibility and loss-on-ignition) as well as a column of samples for
microartifact analysis.
Methods
Fieldwork involved the examination of profiles revealed by two backhoe trenches that were excavated
across Feature 30 from south to north (see Figure 12). The results of the shovel testing indicated that
Feature 30 is elongated along an east-west axis, and Trench 6 was located near the east end, whereas Trench
7 appears to be located close to the center of the feature. Two soil profiles were examined and sampled
within Trench 6, one outside of Feature 30 to the north (Trench 6, Profile 2), and a second that was within
Feature 30, but where its expression was fairly subtle (Trench 6, Profile 1). Trench 7 nearly completely
sectioned Feature 30 and a single soil profile was described and sampled near the center of the organicenriched deposit. A second sample set was collected from Feature 30 in Trench 7, and this was a series of
grab samples collected every meter from the center/most-organic-rich deposit present that was obtained in
order to permit assessing the perceived variation of organic matter across the feature. In addition to the
feature-oriented samples, two small sample columns were collected from a fence row dune on the southwest
side of the site in order to document the nature of unambiguously eolian sand on this hill. Figure 12 shows
the location of the sample columns with respect to the trenches and other geomorphic features near the site.
In all, 102 samples were collected in the field and examined in the lab for a variety of properties. Soil
samples from the columns were collected in 2.5 cm plastic cubes at 5 cm intervals (see Figure 13). For
each column sample three analyses were performed: magnetic susceptibility, particle size distribution, and
loss-on-ignition. Sediment samples from the two short column samples collected from the nearby fence
row dune were processed for particle size analysis. Descriptions of the methods used for the analyses are
provided below. The results of this work are presented in tabular form in Table 15 and shown graphically
on Figure 13.

Magnetic Susceptibility
Magnetic susceptibility is a general measure of the degree to which a sample may be magnetized, and
provides basic information on the magnetic mineralogy of the sample, which may vary owing to a variety
of factors, such as depositional processes, soil development, and human occupation. The application of
magnetic susceptibility to archeological research has been discussed in detail by Dalan (2008) and Dalan
and Bannerjee (1998). In order to determine the magnetic susceptibility samples were first dried, weighed,
and then the low frequency (470 Hz) and high frequency (4700 Hz) volume magnetic susceptibility (kappa)
was measured on the o.1 setting on a Bartington MS2 meter and an MS2b sensor (Dearing 1999). The mass
corrected magnetic susceptibility (chi, or Ïlf) and coefficient of frequency dependency (Ïfd) were then
calculated. The coefficient of frequency dependency (Ï fd), is the percent difference in magnetic
susceptibility measured at low and high frequencies (calculated as: Ï fd = (Ï lf â Ï hf )/ Ï lf)*100). Elevated
values of Ï fd (ca. >10%; Gale and Hoare 1991:213) are indicative of increased concentrations of finegrained ferrimagnetic minerals, most often maghemite, in top soils (Dearing et al., 1996). The magnetic
susceptibility values are presented on Table 15 and are reported in SI units (10-8m3kg-1).
Particle Size Analysis
The particle size distribution (or texture) of the sediment samples was determined on a Beckman-Coulter
LS 13-320 multi-wavelength laser sizer. Following completion of the magnetic susceptibility analysis,
samples were subsampled, with a small amount placed in a small beaker which was then put on a hot plate
and to which concentrated (30 percent) hydrogen peroxide was added in order to remove organic matter
and a 5 percent solution of sodium hexametaphosphate was added to disperse the clay minerals. The liquid
was then brought to a boil and then left on the hot plate until the reaction had ceased or the color of the
sediment had changed, at which point the sample was removed from the hot plate, cooled and then measured
on the LS-13-320. The results of these analyses are presented as percentages of sand, silt and clay, as well
as in the form of descriptive statistics that are presented in phi units (a negative log base 2 conversion of
millimeters). In the phi system, sands exhibit phi values between 0 and 4, silts between 4 and 9, and clay >
9 phi. Comparisons with traditional particle size data and laser sizer granulometry (e.g. Ramaswamy and
Rao 2006; Konert and Vandenberghe 1997) suggest that using the silt-clay boundary at either 6 or 8 microns
yields results most comparable with traditional particle size methods and this is the method used to
determine percentage clay on Table 15. The USDA soil texture class for each sample was determined using
the Soil Texture calculator provided by the NRCS website (NRCS 2013d).
Loss-on-ignition (LOI)
The organic matter content of the samples was estimated using the weight loss-on-ignition method
following Schulte and Hopkins (1996; see also Heiri et al 2001 and Nelson and Sommers 1996). Loss-onignition (or LOI) provides a reasonable estimation of organic matter content in the absence of minerals with
structural water (e.g. smectite clays, gypsum) and in many cases, drying samples at 150Ë can minimize
organic matter overestimation where problematic minerals are present. To determine the loss-on-ignition,
samples were placed into porcelain crucibles, weighed, and dried at 150ËC overnight, after which they were
weighed again, and then placed in a muffle furnace at 450ËC for 4 hours. Samples were removed from the

101

furnace and weighed while hot, and the percentage weight loss-on-ignition was calculated. Given that most
of the sands contain very little clay, the LOI values for these samples most likely are reasonable estimates,
but all of the samples derived from argillic horizons exhibit significant LOI values, but do not appear to
have a color that would support this so these values should be viewed with skepticism.
Lidar Digital Elevation Model
Following fieldwork, lidar data obtained from the mine was used to compile a digital elevation model
(DEM) that was useful in examining and documenting local geomorphic features on and near the site (see
Figure 14). These data provide an exquisite view of low-relief landforms associated with historic land use
in this area and clearly show the location and size of the minor landforms like fence row dunes, which are
visible in the field but too small to show on normal topographic maps (see also Figure 15). Because the
lidar images were compiled following fieldwork, the interpretations presented below have not been ground
truthed.
Geomorphology
The landscape in the immediate vicinity of the site contains numerous geomorphic features created by soil
erosion and re-deposition primarily associated with Historic period farming. The two most conspicuous
features are fence row dunes and gullies.
Fence Row Dunes
One of the surprising attributes of the landscape around the site is the presence of numerous fence row
dunes. These dunes are accumulations of windblown sand that form along fence lines owing to the reduction
in wind speed associated with the fence itself and vegetation growing along it and or trapped by it. The
ability of fences to cause eolian sand deposition has long been used to build up sand dunes (e.g. Pye and
Tsoar 2009; Grafals-Soto 2012; Grafals-Soto and Nordstrom 2009; LÃ³pez and Marcomini 2006; Miller et
al 2001; Hotta et al., 1987) and the accumulation of sand along fence lines has been noted as an unintended
consequences of fencing in areas with sandy soils and abundant wind, like the Southern High Plains of
Texas. For example, in the soil survey of Garza County, Texas, on the Southern High Plains Richardson et
al (2013:39) note that fence row dunes are upwards of 2 m thick and between 7 m and âseveral hundred
feet acrossâ and in another reference describe them as âdunes as much as 20 feet high are common along
fence rowsâ (Richardson et al 2013:45). On the southern High Plains, these dunes are large enough to be
mapped by the soil surveys where they are delineated as the Tivoli fine sand and occur in landscapes
underlain by fine sandy soils such as the Brownfield fine sand and the Miles loamy fine sand. Newman et
al (1960:21) show photos of two such dunes, including one such dune that formed from just two dust storms
in 1960. Once such dunes reach heights in excess of 10 feet they are often depicted on USGS Topographic
maps (for an example from the Southern High Plains see Holliday 2001:100, Figure 7).

Figure 15. Lidar Image of Site and Environs
In Texas, most fence row dunes are often considered to be products of the dust bowl but analytical evidence
supporting this assertion is scant. Such dunes have been OSL dated in two instances (cf. Feathers et al.,
2006; and Lepper and Holliday 2007). Feathers et al., (2006:1662) dated sand built up behind a Historic
104

fence at the Milnesand Site that yielded an single aliquot age of A.D. 1880Â±20, which the authors note is
older than local residents suggest for the age of the dune. More recently Lepper and Holliday (2007) dated
fence row dunes on the Southern High Plains of Texas and New Mexico and obtained results with an
average age of A.D. 1917Â±8 (89 Â± 8 years) and with 1 sigma ages ranging from A.D. 1899 to 1935. These
ages support the formation of such dunes in the early period of Historic land use but fail to restrict such
features to the Dust Bowl years (generally considered to be the 1930s). The accuracy of these OSL dates is
dependant upon the dose rate (primarily amount of background radiation in the sediment), with low dose
rates generally yielding less precise depositional ages (Lepper and Holliday 2007).
Although fence row dunes are a common element of the Southern High Plains historic landscape, evidence
supporting eolian erosion and transport of sandy soils in East Texas is generally lacking. Work on a summit
site at one locality in East Texas by Frederick et al (2002) identified a soil profile that was thought to exhibit
evidence of eolian sedimentation. Although more recent work on the effects of pedoturbation on single
aliquot OSL dating casts some doubt on the chronology derived from this work, the granulometric attributes
of those deposits are clearly consistent with eolian sedimentation (see results, below for comparison of the
granulometric attributes of those sands with the Historic eolian sand observed during this fieldwork). Hence
the fence row dunes that exist in proximity to 41BP595 and presumably associated with Historic farming
are worth noting for the fact that they provide prima facie evidence of eolian reworking of these East Texas
sandy soils as well as silent testimony to the location of historic field boundaries and fence lines, many of
which are no longer part of the present land divisions.
Fence Row Dunes Near 41BP595
As note previously, fence row dunes are a common component of the landscape near 41BP595. These
features can be easily seen on the shaded relief digital elevation model derived from Lidar data (Figures 14
and 15). Two such dunes were noted in the field, in direct proximity of the site, aligned with the fences that
border the hill summit on the northwest and southwest. Examination of the lidar derived digital elevation
model suggests a third such dune encircles the hill summit on the east side of the site. These dunes are low
relief and subtle features, with the most obvious one on the southwest side of the hill being about 0.7 m tall
and 15 m wide (see Figure 15, elevation transect 1). However, there are much larger dunes in the immediate
vicinity, the largest of which is a chevron shaped fence row dune about a kilometer east of the site, one side
of which is about 3 m tall and 60 m wide (see Figure 15, elevation transect 3).
Gullies
As noted previously in the discussion of the soils, the saddle immediately east of the site supports small
streams that flow south and north away from the saddle, and both of which are extensively gullied today.
These gullies have an abrupt form with more than 2 m of local relief in places, and are often augmented by
cattle trails, especially along fence lines.
Also apparent in the lidar DEM are a series of older, somewhat healed gullies that still have topographic
expression today. One set of these is on the northeast side of the site, and another set is in the saddle to the
east of the site in between the modern gullies (see Figure 15). The east slope of the hill upon which the site
is situated exhibits numerous small relief undulations which appear to be healed/buried gullies that

originated from small streams draining into the saddle. A few of these are shown on Figure 15 above, but
these gullies are most likely more extensive than this map suggests. The age of these older gully features is
unknown.
Results
Nature of the deposits
Away from Feature 30 (as in Trench 6-Profile 2), the soil profile exhibited an AC-E/A1-E/A2-Bt sequum.
The AC horizon consisted of a grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sand that was loose, had a single grain structure
and a smooth gradual lower boundary. Although it was impossible to tell in the field, granulometric data
from this horizon indicated that the upper 20 to 30 cm is of eolian origin. The underlying E/A horizon
consisted of brown (10YR 5/3) to pale brown (10YR 6/3) sand and became slightly finer (loamy sand to
sandy loam) immediately above the argillic (Bt) horizon. This deposit was loose, single grained, and had
an abrupt wavy boundary where it rested upon the underlying argillic horizon. Krotovina of burrowing
fossorial mammals, most likely pocket gophers or moles, were present within this horizon and had sharp
edges, ranged from 5 to 12 cm in diameter and were generally either circular to ellipsoidal in cross-section.
These burrow fills often contained small (~1cm diameter) rounded fragments of different colored soil and
in this particular profile there were dark colored fragments of A-horizon in burrows situated immediately
above the Bt horizon. A few thin (1-2 mm) brown (10YR 4/2) wavy clay lamellae are present in this sand
as well. The Bt horizon was a yellowish red (5YR 5/8) sandy clay loam that was firm, exhibited very coarse
prismatic structure, and had between 10 percent and 50 percent gray (10YR 6/1) to light brownish gray
(10YR 6/2) iron depletions which imparted a mottled appearance to the horizon.
Within Feature 30, the soil profile exhibited an AC-C-2Ab-2E/A-2Bt horizon sequence and a recent drape
of younger sand was apparent in most places, and clearly evident in the center of the feature where the color
contrast between the younger sand and the organic-rich buried A horizon of Feature 30 was pronounced. In
the center of Feature 30, the stratigraphy was most clear, but essentially the same as observed near its edge.
A thin (~10 cm) AC horizon had formed in the top of the 30 to 40 cm thick, younger sand, which is
presumably a Historic age eolian deposit, and this weakly developed top soil was a light brownish gray
(10YR 6/2) sand, that was loose, single grained and had a clear smooth lower boundary. The majority of
the recent eolian drape was a C horizon that was comprised of pale brown (10YR 6/3) sand which was
loose, single grained, and met the buried A horizon at a clear irregular boundary, which had primarily been
disturbed by small animal bioturbation. A few krotovina were apparent in the eolian sand, but they were
not as prevalent as in the buried A-horizon that comprises Feature 30. The latter is a buried A-horizon that
ranged in color from very dark gray (10YR 3/1) to a grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sand that was loose to very
friable, single grain, and had a gradual to diffuse lower boundary. This sand exhibited common to many
rodent/mole krotovinas, the appearance of which was facilitated by color contrast of the material. An A/E
horizon was present between the base of the buried soil and the argillic horizon, and this sand was generally
a brown (10YR 5/3) to pale brown (10YR 6/3) sand and like the profile outside Feature 30, became slightly
finer (loamy sand to sandy loam) immediately above the argillic (Bt) horizon. A clear to abrupt irregular
boundary separated the A/E horizon from the Bt horizon. The argillic horizon under Feature 30 was

essentialy the same as it was outside, characterized by yellowish red (5YR 5/8) sandy loam to sandy clay
loam that had a mottled appearance owing to iron depletions along roots/pore and ped faces.
Historic Eolian Mantle
As noted above, a thin mantle of relatively clean sand was observed burying Feature 30. This drape of
recent sand was difficult to impossible to discern away from Feature 30. Although an eolian depositional
origin is most likely for this deposit, in order to assess this hypothesis, two profiles were collected from a
clearly eolian fence row dune that parallels one of the fences on the site. The logic of this approach was to
see how different, if at all, the fence row dune sediments are from the rest of the sands on the hill.
In all of the profiles that were characterized in the lab, the particle size of the deposits comprising the buried
soil and the A/E horizon beneath it were broadly similar, with a mean particle size between 2.3 and 2.6 phi
and with sorting values between 1.1 and 1.5 phi (Figure 16). In verbal terms these deposits are a poorly
sorted fine sand. These sands are most likely bedrock derived sand.

horizon in and near Feature 30 at 41BP595. The blue points are the eolian sands collected from the fence
row dune on site, and the white squares and triangle are deposits identified as eolian on the basis of their
sorting. For comparison, the green circles are sands identified by Frederick et al (2002) for another hill
summit in east-central Texas.

The nine samples collected from the nearby fence row dune were all fine sand, but as a group were slightly
finer (2.2 to 2.45 phi) and notably better sorted (moderately to moderately well-sorted) with values between
0.6 and 1.0 phi. The deposits of the top 30 to 40 cm of the column profiles collected from Trenches 6 and
7 were similar to the fence row dune, and in most of the column profiles the drape of recent sand is clearly
evident in terms of the sorting, which is notably better than the underlying sand (see Figure 13). Hence,
the sands draping Feature 30 closely resemble the eolian fence row dune, and are therefore interpreted as
an eolian deposit.
Just for comparison, also plotted on Figure 16 are samples collected from a hill summit in Lee County that
Frederick et al., 2002 argued were of eolian origin. Note how well these samples compare in terms of mean
and sorting to the fence row dune samples collected at 41BP595.
Attributes of Feature 30
Examination of the stratigraphic exposures of Feature 30 and subsequent analysis of the deposits provides
several insights on the context and origin of this deposit. First, the sediment comprising the feature and the
sediment in the same stratigraphic position outside of it are texturally similar, which suggests that this
feature has formed within the existing sediment, which is most likely weathered Eocene Wilcox Group
fluvial-deltaic sand (see Figures 13 and 16). Second, the organic matter that comprises the feature is
greatest in the center and diminishes towards the margins, and there is approximately three times more
organic matter in the center than in the margins of the feature (see Figure 17). The area of organic
enrichment respects neither a surface topographic depression nor a depression in the top of the underlying
subsoil (argillic horizon), indicating it is not a product of poor drainage or gleying. In fact, prior to burial
Feature 30 appears to have been slightly domed, with the organic-enriched center slightly higher than the
margins. The profile of Trench 7 indicates that before burial by recent eolian sand, the top of Feature 30
was at the ground surface and the feature is deepest in the center and feathers out towards the margins.
Although the A horizons of many soils exhibit magnetic susceptibility enhancement in the form of elevated
Xlf and Xfd, the soils of East Texas sandy mantle deposits typically do not. But both the magnetic
susceptibility and the coefficient of frequency dependency are elevated within the center of Feature 30 and
diminish towards the margins of the feature (see Figure 17). The low frequency mass corrected magnetic
susceptibility (Xlf) is twice as high in the center of the feature as it is at the edge, and the coefficient of
frequency dependence (Xfd) is as much as five times greater in the center than at the margin. Together, these
indicate a process of magnetic susceptibility enhancement that is abnormal for east-central Texas sandy
soils and clearly not the product of gley or water logging.
Finally, although somewhat anecdotal, it was noted when drawing the profile of the feature in Trench 7 that
there are numerous thin (1-2 mm) clay lamellae in the lower half of Feature 30 and beneath it along the
margins of the feature, but there are none under the center, the most organic rich part of the feature (see
Figure 17, next to top panel). The absence of lamellae beneath the center of the feature is perplexing unless
this feature and its organic matter derived from thermal refuse contributed by people. The extensive and
ubiquitous argillic horizons common in this landscape indicate that the soils are low in

bases such as calcium. Schaetzl and Anderson (2005:365) note that the process of clay translocation or
lessivage is weak or almost non-existent in calcareous materials, and will not occur until most of the calcium
has been stripped from the soil. Calcium carbonate is one of the primary constituents of wood ash. Although
the amount of calcium carbonate in these samples was not assayed, the apparent stratigraphic pattern of
clay lamellae is suggestive of one where calcium has not been entirely leached from the thickest part of the
National Register Testing at Sites 41BP585, 41BP594, and 41BP595

109

feature. It would be interesting to see if the spatial and stratigraphic occurrence of calcium is inversely
related to that of the clay lamellae, which if so would indicate that Feature 30 is most likely the result of
the disposal of thermal refuse.
Considered together, the evidence gathered here indicates that the most plausible origin of Feature 30 is
human activity, more specifically, the disposal of thermal refuse. Although there are a few burned rocks
within Feature 30, there appeared to be several intact burned rock features around it, but not in the center.
This suggests that if this hypothesis is correct, that the feature resulted from discard of thermal refuse rather
than an in situ creation of thermal refuse as occurs with an earth oven. It is tempting to consider this feature
as a manifestation of a common space between thermal activity areas rather than a site appliance like
feature. The most compelling and useful information in understanding the origins of this feature will most
likely be the spatial and stratigraphic occurrence of in situ thermal features with respect to Feature 30.
Summary
This chapter presents the results of a geoarcheological examination of Feature 30 at 41BP595. Crosssections of the feature made with a backhoe, together with examination of the deposits present, indicate that
this dark-colored, organic-rich deposit, which is situated near the crest of a hill, is most likely the result of
human activity, specifically the deposition of organic refuse, at least some of which, and possibly most,
was thermal refuse. The feature consists of a lenticular body of organic-rich sand that is about 70 cm thick
in the center and feathers to a thin edge on the sides. The feature was present on the ground surface before
it was buried by 30 to 40 cm of recent eolian sand. The organic matter within this feature is elevated in the
middle where the deposit is thickest, and the magnetic susceptibility is also greatest in this location as well.
The degree of magnetic susceptibility enhancement is considerably greater than normally observed in sandy
topsoils in this region. The magnetic susceptibility of the feature is too high for a gleyed deposit, and the
feature is not restricted to a topographic low or a depression in the top of the underlying subsoil. The curious
absence of clay lamellae beneath the thickest part of the feature as exposed by Trench 7 may be an artifact
of the presence of calcium presumably derived from ash in the central part of the feature, the presence of
which inhibits the processes of lessivage that creates clay lamellae.
Both lidar derived shaded relief digital elevation models and the profile of a trench excavated through the
feature, indicate that this hill slope has been stripped by gully erosion in the not too distant past. The north
and east slopes of the hill bear tangible scars of ancient gullying which are prominent even today when
walking across the site, and a recent group of gullies are now cutting headwards onto the site from a saddle
immediately east of the site. Feature 30 has formed in sand that partly overlies a small ancient gully that
was cut into the argillic horizon near the south end of Trench 7, but this small gully appears to be unrelated
to Feature 30. Despite clear evidence of active small mammal pedoturbation, this matrix-defined feature
retains spatial integrity, and the deposits appear to retain some semblance of stratigraphic integrity. Burnt
rock features discovered around the margins of the feature appear to retain good integrity and it is likely
that the distribution of such features may hold considerable clues to understanding what Feature 30 was in
the past. Although the scale and some aspects of the appearance of this feature are consistent with site
appliance-like thermal features (think burned rock midden without the rock) the presence of intact thermal

features on the periphery suggest an alternative origin, namely a common space between dispersed thermal
activity areas where thermal and organic refuse was disposed.
FEATURE AND UNIT EXCAVATION
Feature 1
Feature 1 was a subsurface circular concentration of thermally altered rock thought to represent the remains
of a prehistoric hearth (Figure 18). It was exposed in the southern half of Trench 6 at 50 cmbs and was
contained within the buried anthrogenic A soil horizon referred to as Feature 30 (Figure 19). Feature 1 was
found near the southeastern edge of Feature 30. Here, Feature 30 appeared to be less organically rich than
it did in Trench 7, where it was more massive. A portion of Feature 1 extended into the western wall of the
Trench and was sampled with Unit 3. The eastern portion of the feature exposed within the trench was
mapped, excavated and drawn in profile before the western portion was exposed in Unit 3. In plan, it
extended 110 cm north-south by 100 cm east-west. In profile the feature was 8 cm thick, consisted of a
single layer of burned rock, and terminated in a slight basin. Its volume was 41,887.90 cubic centimeters
(cc).
The east half of the feature consisted of 120 Chert rocks (8.5 kg), 110 quartzite rocks (14.7 kg), and 29
hematite rocks (2.5 kg). The total mass of all of the burned rocks from the eastern half of the feature was
25.7 kg. The count of the rocks from the western half of the feature (the portion exposed within Unit 3) was
not recorded. The total mass of each rock type, however, was recorded. The west side of the feature
contained 9.3 kg of burned quartzite, 4.3 kg of burned hematite, four burned chert fragments with a
combined mass of 0.9 kg, and one piece of silicified wood with a mass of 0.9 kg. The total mass of all of
the rock recovered from the west half of the feature was 15.4 kg.
Unit 3
Hand excavated unit 3 extended 120 cm east west by 110 cm north south (See Figure 18). Unit 3 yielded
123 pieces of lithic debitage, 8 ground stone fragments, 1,970.43 g of burned rock, 1 projectile point, 1
lithic biface, 1.87g of burned nut shell, and 0.33g of wood charcoal. The vertical distribution of cultural
materials from Unit 3 is presented in Table 16 below. The burned rock recovered from Level 6 presumably
was associated with Feature 1.

The Feature 1 assemblage of cultural materials recovered in the Â¼ inch screens includes 25 pieces of lithic
debitage, 3 ground stone tool fragments, 1 burned nutshell, 0.33 g of wood charcoal, and 18 fragments of
thermally altered rock with a combined mass of 628.3 g. Just over half of the debitage specimens (n = 13)
were thermally altered. The 18 fragments of thermally altered rock include 3 chert fragments (4.78 g), 1
fragment of hematitic sandstone (220 g), 1 fragment of hematite (0.46 g), 3 fragments of metaquartzite
(16.8 g), 10 fragments of quartz arenite (380.7 g) and 1 fragment of silicified wood (5.56g).
The rocks comprising the feature occurred in a single layer. As mentioned above, the feature was found
contained within Feature 30 near its southeastern edge, where it was expressed as a 10YR5/6 yellowish
brown fine sand, with mottles of 10YR4/4 dark yellowish brown sand and 10YR4/3 brown sand around the
feature rocks. Many fine roots and minor rodent disturbance were recorded in the field notes. A single
burned rock was retained for FTIR, starch, pollen, and phytolith analysis. The phytolith record from Feature
1 indicates that it may have been used to process grass seeds. The recovery of a broken Cyperacea achene
seed phytolith suggests that sedge seeds may have been processed.
Two soil samples, comprising 17.10 cubic decimeters (cu dm), were retained for flotation from the eastern
half of Feature 1 and submitted to Macrobotanical Analysis for flotation and analysis. Flotation yielded
0.07 g of wood charcoal which consisted of 0.03 g of Oak, 0.01 g of Hickory, and 0.03 g of unidentified
hardwood. Flotation also yielded 0.10 g of burned nutshell including 0.07 g of Hickory and 0.03 g of
Hickory/Walnut. A total of 0.02 g of indeterminable charred remains and 0.03 g of burned bark were also
recovered through flotation. One burned hickory nutshell recovered from the Feature 1 flotation sample
was submitted for radiocarbon analysis and returned a two sigma calibrated date range of A.D. 4 to A.D.
130.
Feature 2
Feature 2 was an amorphous and diffuse scatter of thermally altered rock (Figure 20) exposed in Trench 1
at roughly 26 cmbs. The feature was found contained within Feature 30 near its western edge. The rock
scatter was limited to an area extending 80 cm north-south by 64 cm east-west. The feature consisted of 21
thermally altered quartzite rocks (2.5 kg) that occurred in a single layer resting on a level plane. The
estimated volume was 64,340 cc. The feature was limited to the anthrogenic A soil horizon and the soil in
and surrounding it was a 10YR6/3 pale brown sand with no visible mottling. No artifacts were recovered
in association with this feature. Rodent activity and small roots were noted on the field forms. This feature
is thought to represent a disarticulated hearth or possibly secondarily deposited material from a nearby
feature, rather than an intact cooking facility. For these reasons, the feature was mapped in plan and the
feature rocks were weighed, but it was not further sampled.
Feature 3
Feature 3 was an ephemeral subsurface scatter of thermally altered rock (Figure 21) exposed in Trench 1
approximately 15 cmbs. The feature was found contained within Feature 30 near its southwestern edge.
The rock scatter was limited to a 58 cm north-south by 20 cm east-west area and consisted of five thermally
altered quartzite rocks (0.5 kg). The rocks occurred in a single layer resting on a level plane.

The estimated volume was 4,640 cc. The feature was contained within the C horizon, above the buried
anthrogenic A horizon, and the soil within and around it was a 10YR6/3 pale brown sand. Four of the five
feature rocks were contained within a rodent run that was a 10YR 6/2 light brown gray fine sand. Many
fine roots were observed throughout the feature. No artifacts were found in association with the feature.
Feature 3 is thought to represent secondarily deposited rock from a burned rock cooking facility.
Consequently, once it was maped in plan and the feature rocks were weighed it was not sampled further.
Feature 4
Feature 4 was a large subsurface concentration of rock that, for the most part, lacked any evidence of
thermal alteration (Figure 22). A small number of thermally altered rocks, representing about 1 percent of
the feature, was present. It was exposed in Trench 1 at about 90 cmbs and was contained within an area
extending roughly 135 cm north-south by 100 cm. Feature 4 was exposed below the buried anthrogenic A
horizon (Feature 30), at the bottom of the A/E horizon near its conformation with the Bt horizon. Here the
A/E horizon was a 10YR5/4 yellowish brown sand while the underlying Bt horizon was a 5YR5/6 strong
brown sandy clay. The volume of Feature 4 was approximately 38,024 cc. The western half of the feature
was excavated by hand and screened through Â¼ inch mesh. This effort recovered no artifacts but did yield
86 quartzite rocks (23.6 kg), 5 silicified wood rocks (2.2 kg), 4 hematitic sandstone rocks (1.4 kg), and 2
chert cobbles (0.3 kg). The combined mass of all the rock removed from the western half of the feature was
27.5 kg. Once the western half of the rock concentration was removed, the feature was drawn in profile
(Figure 23). In profile, the base of the feature undulated and it did not appear to be resting on a level plane
or in a basin.
Based on its near complete absence of thermally altered rock, Feature 4 is thought to have primarily noncultural origins. The rare pieces of thermally altered rock that were found are thought to be intrusive. It is
conceivable that the rock represents a cache of raw materials gathered systemically for possible later use in
a cooking facility.
Feature 5
Feature 5 was a subsurface cluster of thermally altered rock (Figure 24) that was exposed in Trench 1 at
about 40 cmbs. The feature consisted of a 35 by 42 cm oval shaped cluster of burned rocks with several
additional burned rocks scattered in an adjacent triangular area that extended 16 by 25 cm. A 12 by 22 cm
void was located near the center of the feature. The featureâs volume was about 7,697 cc. It consisted of 52
thermally altered quartzite rocks (7.9 kg). The rocks occurred in a single layer resting on a level plane. The
feature was found contained within the western edge of Feature 30, which was expressed in the featureâs
vicinity as a 10YR3/2 to 10YR2/2 very dark grayish sand. Many fine roots were present in the matrix. No
artifacts were recovered in association with this feature.
The feature was drawn in plan and a flotation sample was taken from amongst and below the feature rocks.
The feature appeared to be relatively intact. The central void within the oval shaped portion of the

feature, along with the adjacent rock scatter, are thought to represent the partial dismantlement of the feature
at the end of its use life. Feature 5 is thought to represent a prehistoric hearth. A 4.45 cu dm soil sample
was retained from the feature for flotation and macrobotanical analysis. Flotation yielded 0.10 g of wood
charcoal, consisting of 0.06 g of Oak, 0.02 g of Hickory, and 0.02 g of unidentified hardwood. No burned
nut shells were recovered from the flotation sample. An additional 0.02 g, of unidentified charred botanical
remains was also recovered.
Feature 6
Feature 6 was an ephemeral and amorphous scatter of burned rock (Figure 25) exposed in Trench 1 at
roughly 36 cmbs. The rock scatter was contained within a 40 cm north-south by 30 cm east-west area. Its
volume was 4,320 cc. The feature consisted of nine thermally altered quartzite rocks (1.0 kg). The rock
occurred in a single layer resting on a level plane. The feature was found contained within Feature 30. The
soil surrounding the feature ranged from a 10YR5/4 yellowish brown sand to a 10YR4/3 brown sand with
signs of rodent activity and many fine roots. The feature is thought to represent a secondarily deposited
concentration of burned rocks. For this reason, it was not further sampled.
Feature 15
Feature 15 was a subsurface cluster of burned rock thought to represent a portion of a partially intact
cooking surface (Figure 26). It was first exposed in profile in the west wall of Trench 6, at a depth ranging
between 35 and 46 cmbs and extending for 56 cm along the trench wall (Figure 27). A portion of the feature
along its eastern edge was likely removed when Trench 6 was excavated. The feature was sampled with
Unit 4, which extended 1 m north/south along the trench wall by 64 cm east/west. Feature 15 was exposed
in plan in Level 4 of Unit 4 where it was shown to extend 58 cm north-south by 38 cm east-west. The
feature rocks occurred in a single layer and were found to be resting on a level plane. Its volume was 6,042
cc. The feature was composed of 5.6 kg quartzite and 2.3 g of hematite that had a combined mass of 7.9 kg.
The feature was contained within the eastern edge of the culturally enriched soil horizon referred to as
Feature 30, which was expressed in the vicinity of Feature 15, as a 25 cm thick zone of 10YR5/3 brown
sand that differed only slightly from the 10YR6/3 pale brown C horizon above it and the A/E horizon below
it.
Unit 4
Unit 4 was a 1 m x 64 cm hand excavated unit used to sample the remaining portion of Feature 15 exposed
in the western wall of Trench 6. In addition to the burned rock from Feature 15, recovered from Level 4,
Unit 4 yielded 38 pieces of lithic debitage, 3 ground stone fragments, 0.79 g of wood charcoal, and 411.42
g of thermally altered rock. The vertical distribution of these materials is presented in Table 17 below.

A 5.15 cu dm soil sample was retained for flotation and macrobotanical analysis. Flotation yielded 0.07 g
of wood charcoal including 0.03 g of Oak and 0.04 g of unidentified hard wood. A total of 0.06 g of burned
nut shell was recovered from flotation including 0.04 g of hickory and 0.02 g of hickory/walnut. An
additional 0.01 g of unidentified burned botanical remains was also recovered.
A single feature rock was retained and submitted for FTIR, phytolith, pollen, and starch analysis. No
phytoliths or starches were identified that reasonably could be interpreted as evidence of subsistence
processing. The FTIR analysis identified the presence of fats/oils/lipids and/or plant waxes with fingerprint
region peaks consistent with Sagittaria.
Feature 16
Feature 16 was a shallowly buried linear scatter of thermally altered cobbles (Figure 28) exposed in Trench
5 at approximately at 27 cmbs. The feature was contained within a 78 cm east-west by 36 cm north-south
area and its volume was 12,480 cc. It was found just to the east of the eastern limits of Feature 30 and
contained within the E/A soil horizon. The feature consisted of 20 quartzite rocks (5.0 kg), and three
hematitic sandstone rocks (0.5 kg). The soil both surrounding and within the feature was a 10YR6/3 pale
brown sand. Feature 16 is thought to represent secondarily deposited burned rocks rather than an intact
cooking facility. For this reason, it was not sampled further.
Feature 19
Feature 19 was a subsurface cluster of thermally altered rocks exposed 37 cmbs along the northern edge of
Trench 17. The exact size and shape of the feature remains undetermined, as it extended into the north and
west trench walls. The portion of the feature that was exposed appeared as a partial oval (representing
roughly 60 percent) aligned northeast to southwest with portions near the focal points extending into the
trench walls. The exposed portion of the feature extended 45 cm north-south by 48 cm east-west. Once the
exposed portion of the feature was mapped in plan (Figure 29) and excavated the remainder was mapped
in profile in the trench walls (Figure 30). The featureâs maximum thickness was 10 cm. The excavated
portion consisted of 48 quartzite rocks (6.8 kg), 8 hematite rocks (0.9 kg), and 2 petrified-wood rocks (0.1
kg) that had a combined mass of 7.8 kg. The volume of the sampled portion of the feature was about 24,881
cc. The soil surrounding and within the feature was a 10YR5/4 yellowish brown sand E/A

horizon. The feature rocks occurred in a single layer resting on a level plane. Four pieces of lithic debitage
(all thermally altered) were recovered from beneath the feature in the Â¼ inch screens. The feature appeared
to represent a mostly intact cooking facility. Minor rodent disturbance and many fine roots were noted on
the feature form. A 4.25 cu dm soil sample was retained for flotation and macrobotanical analysis. Flotation
yielded 0.01 g of unidentified hardwood charcoal and 0.01 g of burned hickory/walnut nutshell.
Feature 20
Feature 20 was an ephemeral scatter of burned rock (Figure 31), thought to represent materials secondarily
deposited from a nearby cooking feature. The feature was exposed in Trench 9 at an approximate depth of
60 cmbs. The feature was contained within the E/A soil horizon, which was a 10YR7/2 pale gray sand. The
feature consisted of ten burned rocks resting on a level plane and confined to an area extending 40 cm
east/west by 50 cm north/south. No charcoal or soil staining were found in association with feature 20.
Once the feature was exposed and mapped in plan it did not appear to represent an intact cooking facility.
For this reason it was not further sampled.
Feature 21
Feature 21 was a small tight cluster of burned rock with a light scatter of burned rock surrounding it (Figure
32). The feature was exposed in Trench 10 at a depth of approximately 54 cmbs (Figure 33). In plan, the
tightly clustered portion of the feature had a semi-oval outline that extended 38 cm east/west by 34 cm
north/south. The associated scatter of rocks was found within 30 cm of the limits of the tightly clustered
portion. Rodent runs and small roots were recorded in the field notes. After the portion of the feature
exposed in the trench was recorded and removed it was shown to extend west into the wall of the trench,
where it was drawn in profile. The feature rocks occurred in a single layer on a level plane and had a
maximum thickness of 8 cm. The volume of the sampled portion of the feature was 8,294 cc and consisted
of 28 quartzite rocks (4.7 kg) and two hematite rocks (0.1 kg) that had a combined mass of 4.8 kg. Two
ground stone tool fragments were recovered from the Â¼ inch screens. The Feature was contained within the
E/A2 horizon which was a 10YR5/6 yellow brown sand.
One feature rock was retained for FTIR, phytolith, starch, and pollen analysis. The phytolith record from
Feature 21 reflects the environment. A single Poaceae pollen grain was identified. Starches, apparently
representing subsistence, were abundant and appear to represent subsistence processing of grass seeds and
tubers/roots. The FTIR analysis identified the presence of fats/oils/lipids and/or plant waxes with fingerprint
region peaks consistent with Sagittaria.
Unit 7
Once the portion of Feature 21 within the trench was removed, a 50 cm x 50 cm unit (7) was excavated
off of the western trench wall, adjacent to the former location of the feature. Unit 7 yielded 15 pieces of
lithic debitage, 1 lithic biface, and 269.9 g of thermally altered rock. Table 18 below lists the cultural
materials recovered from Unit 7 by 10 cm level.

A 5.15 cu dm soil sample was retained from the portion of the feature exposed in Trench 10 for flotation
and macrobotanical analysis. Flotation yielded 0.03 g of wood charcoal including 0.01 g of oak, 0.01 g of
hickory, and 0.01 g of unidentified hardwood. Flotation also yielded 0.04 g of burned nutshell including
0.01 g of hickory/walnut, and 0.03 g of black walnut. The black walnut nutshell was submitted for
radiocarbon analysis and returned a calibrated two sigma date range of 44 B.C. to A.D. 84.
Feature 22
Feature 22 was a small cluster of burned rocks (Figure 34) partially exposed in Trench 11 at 30 cmbs, along
the eastern trench wall. The feature was contained within the E/A soil horizon, which was a 10YR5/4
yellowish brown fine sand. The portion of the feature exposed in the trench was drawn in plan and
photographed. It consisted of five burned rocks contained within an area extending 22 cm north/south by
20 cm east west. The origins of Feature 22 are ambiguous. The rocks may represent the edge of a larger
feature that extends east into the east wall of the trench. It is also possible that the rocks represent a
disarticulated hearth or discarded lid rocks. Due to the small size of the exposed portion of Feature 22, its
uncertain origins, along with the fact that it was found relatively close to the ground surface, a flotation
sample was not taken.
Feature 23
Feature 23 was a tight circular cluster of burned rock with an associated light scatter of burned rock
surrounding it (Figure 35). The feature was exposed in the floor of Trench 11 at an approximate depth of
60 cmbs (Figure 36). The rock cluster had a diameter of 36 cm while the exposed portion of the surrounding
rock scatter was contained within an area extending 166 cm north-south by 80 cm east-west. A portion of
the rock cluster extended into the west wall of the trench. The feature consisted of 72 hematite rocks (3.2
kg), 67 quartzite rocks (9.9 kg), and 4 silicified wood rocks (0.2 kg) that have a combined mass of 13.3 kg.
The feature was contained within the E/A soil horizon and the soil within and around it was a 10YR7/2
light gray sand. Once the portion of the circular cluster exposed in the trench floor was excavated, the
portion extending into the trench wall was drawn in profile. The feature rocks occurred in a single layer
that was resting on a level plane with a maximum thickness of 5 cm. The volume of the sampled portion of
the cluster was 3,534 cc.

A single piece of hematite was retained from the feature for FTIR, pollen, starch, and phytolith analysis.
Cyperaceae achene phytoliths were recovered which could represent an environmental signature or
processing sedge seeds for subsistence. The starch record suggests that tubers (most likely Sagittaria) and
possibly grass seeds were processed in the feature. The FTIR analysis identified the presence of
fats/oils/lipids and/or plant waxes with fingerprint region peaks consistent with Sagittaria.
The circular rock cluster is thought to represent a largely intact prehistoric cooking surface while the scatter
of rocks surrounding it is thought to represent materials displaced from the cluster following its last use. A
Scottsbluff dart point was found just beneath the rock retained for residue analysis. The dart point showed
no signs of thermal alteration, suggesting it was discarded after the feature was last used, perhaps when the
associated rock scatter became displaced from the rest of the feature. In addition to the dart point, other
cultural materials recovered in the Â¼ inch screens include two pieces of thermally altered lithic debitage
and one ground stone fragment.
Unit 8
Once the portion of Feature 23 within the trench was removed, Unit 8, a 50 by 50 cm unit, was excavated
adjacent to its former location, off of the western wall of Trench 11. Unit 8 yielded 26 pieces of lithic
debitage, 1 ground stone artifact, and 285.01g of thermally altered rock (Table 19).

Feature 24
Feature 24 was a loose scatter of thermally altered rock (Figure 35) exposed in Trench 11 at an approximate
depth of 40 cmbs. The feature rock was found widely scattered within an area extending 100 cm northsouth by 50 cm east-west. Once it was fully exposed, Feature 24 was thought to represent secondarily
discarded burned rocks, rather than an intact cooking facility. It may represent materials displaced from
Feature 23. The feature was contained within the E/A soil horizon which was a 10YR7/2 light gray dry
sand. The feature was mapped, photographed and left in place.

Feature 25
Feature 25 consisted of a small, partially complete oval shaped cluster of burned rock with an associated
light scatter of burned rock to the northwest and southeast (Figure 37). The burned rocks were contained
within an area 50 cm wide by 110 cm long, with the long axis oriented northwest to southeast. The central
oval shaped cluster extended 46 cm x 35 cm x 8 cm in maximum thickness; several internal voids were also
present. The volume of the oval cluster was 6,597 cc. Feature 25 was exposed 46 cmbs and was found
contained within the E/A soil horizon which was a 10YR5/4 yellowish brown sand. The feature was
composed of 41 quartzite rocks (5.6 kg), 5 hematite rocks (0.7 kg) and 1 silicified wood rock (0.2 kg). The
total mass of the feature rocks was 6.5 kg.
The feature was mapped in plan, photographed, and excavated. No additional artifacts were recovered from
the Â¼ inch screens. Slight disturbance from rodent and root activity was noted on the feature form. The oval
cluster of burned rocks is thought to represent a disarticulated hearth. The loose scatter of burned rock
presumably represents materials removed from the oval shaped cluster following its last systemic use.
Because the feature appeared to be largely disarticulated it was not sampled for flotation.
Feature 26
Feature 26 consisted of a roughly oval shaped cluster of burned rocks, with several large internal voids, and
a surrounding light scatter of burned rock (Figure 38). It was exposed at 55 cmbs in Trench 17. These
materials were contained within an area extending 114 cm north-south by 100 cm east-west. The oval
shaped cluster was roughly 85 cm x 60 cm with the long axis oriented north, northwest by south, southeast.
The feature was bisected along a northeast by southwest line crossing the central portion of the cluster. The
southeast half was excavated first and the remaining portion of the feature was drawn in profile (Figure 38).
The profile crossed one of the interior feature voids. Due to the presence of the void in the profile, the base
of the feature is not fully depicted in profile and it remains uncertain if this feature terminated in a basin or
was resting on a level plain. The feature was contained within the E/A soil horizon, which was a 10YR6/3
pale brown sand. The portion of the profile that was present suggests that the feature was constructed with
two layers of rock and had a maximum thickness of 10 cm. The volume of the oval rock cluster was 37,699
cc. The burned rock comprising the feature included 435 quartzite rocks (60.1 kg), 36 hematite (1.1 kg),
and 18 petrified rocks (1.5 kg). The combined mass of these materials was 63.2 kg. Only one piece of
thermally altered debitage was recovered from the Â¼ inch screen. Feature 26 is thought to represent a
prehistoric cooking facility that has been partially disarticulated. Two soil samples, comprising 11.70 cu
dm, were retained for flotation and macrobotanical analysis. Flotation yielded 0.01 g of oak charcoal and
0.02 g of unidentified hardwood charcoal.
Feature 27
Feature 27 was a large burned rock feature consisting of two distinct clusters, referred to as Clusters 1 and 2
(Figure 38) exposed in Trench 17. The feature was contained within the E/A soil horizon, which was a
10YR6/3 pale brown sand. The feature was not distinguished by a change in soil color or texture. No visible
charcoal was present when the feature was exposed.

Cluster 1 was a roughly circular burned rock bed with a diameter ranging between 110 and 120 cm. It was
exposed 66 cmbs. Once Cluster 1 was fully exposed and mapped in plan in the trench, it was bisected from
northeast to south west and the south east half was removed first. In profile the feature extended up to 10
cm in thickness and was composed of two layers of rock (Figure 38). Cluster 1 terminated in a shallow
basin. Its volume was 50,256 cc. The northwest half of the feature was subsequently removed. The rock
from both halves of Cluster 1 include 820 quartzite rocks (140.8 kg), 148 hematite fragments (6.8 kg), 40
silicified wood rocks (3.4 kg), 1 unidentified rock resembling granite (0.1 kg), 1 coarse sandstone rock (1.2
kg) and 3 thermally altered chert rocks (0.3 kg). The volume of Cluster 1 was 69,115 cc. A single lithic
biface was recovered from amongst the feature rocks in Cluster 1 that showed no signs of thermal alteration.
Artifacts recovered from the Â¼ inch screens include 16 pieces of lithic debitage, of which 12 had been
thermally altered, 14 ground stone artifacts, of which 13 had been thermally altered, 1 utilized flake and
one 0.1 g fragment of wood charcoal.
Three soil samples, comprising 21.25 cu dm, were retained from Cluster 1 for flotation and macrobotanical
analysis. Flotation yielded 0.03 g of unidentified hardwood charcoal and 0.01 g of hickory/walnut burned
nutshell.
Unit 6
Unit 6 was excavated off of the east wall of Trench 17 adjacent to Cluster 1 (Figure 38). It extended 1 m
north south by 1.2 m east west. Unit 6 yielded 35 pieces of lithic debitage, 1 lithic scraper, 155.86 g of
thermally altered rock, 1 lithic core, and 1 utilized flake. The vertical distribution of these materials is
presented in Table 20 below.
A light scatter of burned rock was exposed and mapped in Level 6 (Figure 38). The origins of the burned
rock recovered from Unit 6 in Levels 6 and 7 (consisting of 31 quartzite rocks, 2 chert fragments, 5 hematite
fragments, and 1 piece of coarse sandstone) remained ambiguous after the unit was excavated. These
materials may have been displaced from Cluster 1 following its last use or they may represent secondary
discard from another nearby cooking facility.

Cluster 2 was a roughly circular burned rock bed exposed in Trench 17 at 65 cmbs with a diameter ranging
between 100 and 120 cm (Figure 38). Cluster 2 was found directly adjacent to Cluster 1. Based on the
orientation of the rocks in both clusters, Cluster 1 appears to intrude into Cluster 2. Two amorphous voids
were also noted in plan. The western void was roughly 25 cm east/west 25 by 20 cm north/south while the
eastern void was about 20 cm north/south by 10 cm east west. Once Cluster 2 was exposed and mapped it
was bisected from southwest to northeast. The line of bisection crossed a roughly 36 cm long intact portion
of the Cluster as well as the eastern void. The portion of the cluster that was visible in profile had two layers
of rock with a maximum thickness of 8 cm (Figure 38). The volume of Cluster 2 was 50,266 cc. Due to
where the line of bisection was placed, it was not possible to determine the shape of the base of the cluster.
The rock from both halves of the cluster included 163 quartzite rocks (42.2 kg), 121 hematite rocks (9.3
kg) and 11 silicified wood rocks (1.0 kg). Artifacts recovered in the Â¼ inch screens from Cluster 2 include
4 pieces of lithic debitage, of which 2 were thermally altered, 2 thermally altered ground stone artifacts, 2
lithic bifaces, and 2 faunal bone fragments. In plan, Cluster 2 appeared to be less intact than Cluster 1 and
is consequently thought to pre-date it. This interpretation is supported by the observation that the boundary
of Cluster 1 was better defined than that of Cluster 2 where the two clusters joined.
Two soil samples, comprising 16.70 cu dm were retained for flotation and macrobotanical analysis from
Cluster 2. Flotation yielded 0.08 g of wood charcoal, including 0.02 g of oak, 0.03 g plateau live oak, 0.02
g of hickory, and 0.01 g of unidentified hardwood. Additionally, 0.01 g of hickory/walnut burned nutshell
was recovered.
Feature 29
Feature 29 was a large complex subsurface burned rock feature spanning most of the floor of Trench 15
(Figure 39). It is composed of five partially overlapping rock clusters thought to represent multiple events.
The top of the feature was encountered at roughly 69 cmbs. Together, the rock clusters extended
approximately 5.2 m north south by 1.5 m east west.
Clusters 1, 2, 4, and 5 were composed of a single layer of rock while Cluster 3 was composed of up to three
layers of rock that together ranged between 20 and 28 cm in thickness. The combined mass of rock from
the five clusters was 392.2 kg, which included 3,473 quartzite rocks (367.1 kg), 404 hematite rocks (23.4
kg), and 36 silicified wood rocks (1.7 kg). The feature was contained within the E/A2 soil horizon which
was a 10YR5/4 yellowish brown fine sand with no visible mottling. Disturbances recorded on the field
notes include rodent activity and fine to small roots.
Cluster 1 was a small tight cluster of burned rock thought to represent the remains of a prehistoric cooking
surface. It extended 60 cm north/south by 80 cm east/west. Once exposed, it appeared to be largely intact
aside from a small void near the center. Cluster 1 contained 41 quartzite rocks (7.8 kg) and 4 hematite rocks
(1.1 kg). One ground stone fragment was recovered from the Â¼ in screens. No other cultural materials were
recovered in association with the cluster. In profile, Cluster 1 was shown to be resting on a level plane and
the rocks occurred in a single layer with a maximum thickness of 4 cm. Its volume was 8,796 cc.
One burned rock from cluster 1 was retained for FTIR, starch, pollen and phytolith analysis from the eastern
Â½ of the cluster. Starches recovered from the cluster 1 sample suggest that Sagittaria-type roots/tubers

143

along with a variety of grass seeds may have been processed. The FTIR analysis identified the presence of
fats/oils/lipids and/or plant waxes with fingerprint region peaks consistent with Sagittaria.
A 5.65 cu dm soil sample was retained from Cluster 1 for flotation and macrobotanical analysis. Flotation
yielded 0.01 g of oak charcoal and 0.02 g of hickory/walnut burned nut shell. The burned hickory/walnut
nutshell was submitted for radiocarbon analysis and returned a calibrated two sigma date range of A.D.
1049 to 1084, A.D. 1124 to 1136, and A.D. 1150 to 1256.
Cluster 2 was a small amorphous cluster of burned rocks located between cluster 1 and 3 that is thought to
represent a disarticulated burned rock cooking feature or a discard pile associated with one of the nearby
clusters (Figure 39). Cluster 2 extended roughly 60 cm north/south by 90 cm east west. Because the cluster
did not appear to represent an intact cooking facility, no soil sample was retained for flotation. The cluster
contained 43 quartzite rocks with a combined mass of 7.3 kg. The cluster was composed of a single layer
of burned rock resting on a level plane with a maximum thickness of 4 cm. Its volume was 8,495 cc.
Cluster 3 consisted of a large and very dense oval shaped cluster of burned rocks that extended 130 cm
north/south by 95 cm east west and was surrounded by a less dense scatter of burned rocks contained within
an area extending roughly 1.75 cm north south by 140 cm east/west (Figure 39). Cluster 3 was the largest
rock cluster identified during NRHP testing. It is thought to represent a relatively intact cooking facility.
At its widest, cluster 3 extended across the width of the trench. In profile the cluster was shown to be
composed of three to four layers of rock and terminate in a shallow basin, suggesting it was built in a
shallow pit (Figure 39). Cluster 3 was composed of 2,989 quartzite rocks (297.0 kg), 368 hematite rocks
(20.8 kg) and 34 silicified wood rocks (1.4 kg). Its maximum thickness was 26 cm and its volume was
220,540 cc. Clay lamellae were noted two to four cm below the feature rocks in profile. Three quartzite
ground stone artifacts and three pieces of lithic debitage were recovered in the Â¼ inch screens. Two soil
samples, comprising 13.35 cu dm, were retained for flotation and macrobotanical analysis. Flotation yielded
0.01 g of unidentified hardwood charcoal and 0.01 g of hickory/walnut burned nutshell.
A single burned rock was retained for FTIR, phytolith, and pollen analysis, recovered from the western Â½
of cluster 3. Celtis seed phytoliths were recovered from the cluster 3 sample and may indicate that
hackberrys were processed. No starches were found in the cluster 3 sample. The FTIR analysis identified
the presence of fats/oils/lipids and/or plant waxes with fingerprint region peaks consistent with Sagittaria.
Unit 5
Unit 5, a 1 x 1.2 m unit, was excavated adjacent to Cluster 3 off of the east wall of Trench 15 (Figure 39).
A small concentration of burned rock, extending 42 cm north/south by 8 cm east/west was exposed in
Levels 8 and 9 (95-107 cmbd, 74-86 cmbs) and represents a portion of the outer edge of cluster 3. A small
area of burned soil, extending 16 cm north/south by 2 cm east/west was exposed within the portion of
Cluster 3 identified in Unit 5. Unit 5 (Table 21) yielded 307 pieces of lithic debitage â of which 229 had
been thermally altered, 2 ground stone artifacts, 1 lithic uniface, 0.31g burned nut shells, 0.56g of wood
charcoal, and 730.91 g of burned rock. One unidentified metal fragment was also recovered.

Cluster 4 consisted of an amorphous cluster of burned rock that occurred in a single layer resting on a level
to slightly sloping plane (Figure 39). Its maximum thickness was 6 cm. In plan it extended roughly 1 m
north/south by 1.1 m east/west. Its origins are uncertain. The rocks comprising the cluster may represent a
disarticulated cooking facility or perhaps discarded lid rocks from cluster 3. Once the feature rocks were
removed and flotation samples retained, the remaining feature fill was screened with Â¼ inch hardware cloth.
This effort yielded 6 pieces of lithic debitage, of which 2 had been thermally altered, and 1 projectile point
base that had been thermally altered. Cluster 4 was composed of 254 quartzite rocks (27.0 kg) and 13
hematite rocks (0.7.0 kg). The clusterâs volume was 49,244 cc.
A 6.5 cu dm soil sample was retained for flotation and macrobotanical analysis. Flotation yielded 0.01 g of
indeterminate hardwood charcoal, 0.1 g of burned hickory nutshell, and 0.01 g of burned hickory/walnut
nutshell. The burned hickory nutshell was submitted for radiocarbon dating and returned calibrated two
sigma date range of 1110 B.C. to 894 B.C. and 867 B.C. to 854 B.C..
Cluster 5 was an amorphous cluster of burned rock that occurred in a single layer (Figure 39). In profile,
the featureâs base was uneven and its maximum thickness was 5 cm. It extended roughly one m north/south
by 90 cm east west. It consisted of 146 quartzite rocks (28.0 kg), 19 hematite rocks (0.8 kg), and 2 silicified
wood rocks (0.3kg) that had a combined mass of 29.1 kg. The clusterâs volume was 40,500 cc. The cluster
appeared to extend into the west wall of the trench. The origins of cluster 5 remain ambiguous. It may
represent a systemically disturbed or disarticulated cooking feature or discarded lid rocks from a nearby
feature. It did not appear to represent an intact cooking facility.
A 5.20 cu dm soil sample was retained for flotation and macrobotanical analysis. Flotation yielded 0.02 g
of wood charcoal, including 0.01 g of white oak and 0.01 g of indeterminate hardwood. Flotation also
yielded 0.01 g of burned hickory/walnut nutshell.
Feature 30
Feature 30 was an expansive, buried anthrogenic horizon or midden expressed as a dark, organically rich
soil deposit in the walls of four backhoe trenches (1, 6, 7, and 8) as well as four shovel tests (36, 37, 86,
and 87). This deposit extended roughly 55 m east/west by 22 m north south. Feature 30 was sampled with
two 50 cm x 50 cm units excavated by hand off of trenches 7 and 8. Unit 1 was excavated off trench 7 while

National Register Testing at Sites 41BP585, 41BP594, and 41BP595

147

Unit 2 was excavated off of Trench 8. One m sections of trenches 7 and 8, encompassing Units 1 and 2,
were drawn in profile (Figures 40 and 41).
Units 1 and 2
One soil sample from each of levels 5 through 10 was retained for flotation and macrobotanical analysis
from Unit 1. For Unit 2, one soil sample from each of levels 5 through 9 was retained for flotation and
analysis. The soil samples ranged in size from 7.00 cu dm to 9.10 cu dm. The combined volume of all of
the flotation samples from Unit 1 was 46.45 cu dm while the combined volume of the Unit 2 samples was
40.10 cu dm. The most common remains recovered through flotation from both units were wood charcoal
and burned nutshells.
The Unit 1 flotation samples yielded a total of 1.24 g of wood charcoal, including 0.19 g oak, 0.02 g white
oak, 0.01 g plateau live oak, 0.35 g hickory, 0.66 g of indeterminate wood charcoal, and 0.01 g of wood
charcoal not examined for species. The Unit 1 samples also yielded a total of 0.47 g of burned nutshell
including 0.33 g hickory, 0.13 g hickory/walnut and 0.01 g acorn. Additionally, the unit 1 flotation samples
yielded 0.03 g of hickory nut hull and 0.01 g of an indeterminable bulb, 0.22 g of indeterminable botanical
remains, and 0.02 g of plant gall.
The Unit 2 flotation samples yielded a total of 0.74 g of wood charcoal, including 0.16 g Oak, 0.07 g white
oak, 0.02 g plateau live oak, 0.18 g hickory, 0.28 g indeterminate hardwood, and 0.03 g not examined for
species. The Unit 2 flotation samples also yielded 0.93 of burned nutshell including, 0.83 g hickory, 0.08 g
hickory/walnut, and 0.02 g acorn. Other remains include 0.02 g indeterminable bulb and 0.08 g
indeterminable botanical remains.
To illustrate the vertical distribution of the charred botanical remains recovered from units 1 and 2, the
combined mass of the wood charcoal and burned nutshells recovered from each of the flotation samples is
presented in Table 22 below by level. To facilitate comparison of these results, Table 22 also lists the
combined density of burned nutshell and wood charcoal for each level as g/cu m. The vertical distribution
of these remains in Unit 1 is fairly even while the vertical distribution of these remains in Unit 2 was uneven.
In Unit 2, wood charcoal and burned nutshell were nearly twice as dense in Level 8 than they were in the
next most productive Level (Level 7).

The sediment excavated from units 1 and 2 not retained for flotation was screened through Â¼ inch (0.635
cm) mesh. Unit 1 yielded 43 pieces of lithic debitage, 1 ground stone fragment, 1,342.44 g of thermally
altered rock, 2 faunal bone fragments, 0.22 g of burned nut shell, 0.89 g of wood charcoal, and 1 projectile
point from screening. The projectile point is similar to a small Edwards arrow point and presumably dates
to the same period, around A.D. 900-1100 (Turner et al. 2011), The vertical distribution of these materials
is presented in Table 23 below.

The vertical distribution of cultural materials in Unit 1 and 2 is uneven, with high yielding 10 cm levels
bracketed by low yielding levels. The culturally richest ten cm levels were however, generally consistent
with the buried anthrogenic A horizon in levels 6 through 10.
Feature 30 is thought to represent a midden that resulted primarily from the deposition of organic refuse
from multiple episodes of hot rock cooking. Four radiocarbon assays were obtained from burned hickory
nutshell fragments recovered from four of the flotation samples taken from Feature 30 (Unit 1 levels 7 and
9 and Unit 2 levels 6 and 8). The sample from Unit 1, Level 7 returned a calibrated two sigma date range
of A.D. 902 to 920, A.D. 962 to A.D. 1041, and A.D. 1108 to A.D. 1116. The Edwards like arrow point
recovered from Level 6 in Unit 1 conceivably could represent the same occupation. The sample from Unit 1,
Level 9 returned a calibrated two sigma date range of A.D. 433 to A.D. 459, A.D. 467 to A.D. 488, and
A.D. 533 to A.D. 638. The sample from Unit 2, Level 6 returned a calibrated two sigma date range of B.C.
808 to B.C. 749, B.C. 684 to B.C. 667, B.C. 640 to B.C. 588, and B.C. 579 to B.C. 561. The sample from
Unit 2, Level 8 returned a calibrated two sigma date range of A.D. 400 to A.D. 538. The Unit 1 dates
occurred in their expected stratigraphic sequence; the Level 7 sample returned an earlier date than the Level
9 sample. The inverse is true with the Unit 2 dates, where the Level 6 sample returned an older date than
the Level 8 sample. The calibrated two sigma results suggest Feature 30 arose during the period ranging
from 800 B.C. to A.D. 1030.
The vertical distribution of the cultural materials recovered from units 1 and 2, including those recovered
in the 1/4 inch screens and those recovered through flotation is uneven, suggesting they have been subjected
to some post depositional mixing. A variety of natural and cultural processes, including those that occurred
prior to and following the siteâs prehistoric abandonment, may account for this pattern. Systemic discard
behavior and trampling during the siteâs prehistoric occupation conceivably could have resulted in some
mixing to Feature 30 during the roughly 2000 year period in which it appears to have arisen. Postabandonment cultural processes associated with historic land use practices also may have contributed to the
observed expression of the archeological record. Faunal turbation from burrowing rodents also may have
contributed to the vertical displacement of cultural materials throughout the vertical column.

Feature 31
Feature 31 is a burned rock cluster exposed in the floor of Unit 5 (see Figure 39) along its northern wall
(Figure 42) at 68 cmbs. The feature was found adjacent to the eastern edge of Feature 29, Cluster 3, and at
roughly the same depth below ground surface. Only a small portion of the feature was exposed in the unit
and most of it remains un-sampled. The feature was contained within the E/A soil horizon, which ranged
from a 10YR5/4 yellowish brown to a 10YR5/6 yellowish brown sand. The portion of the feature that was
exposed was a semicircle extending 40 cm east west by 10 cm north south. Several burned rocks were found
scattered across the unit floor at the same elevation as Feature 31 and Feature 29, Cluster 3, but could not
be confidently associated with either. The portion of Feature 31 that was sampled consisted of 14 quartzite
burned rocks (3.0 kg).
Feature 32
Feature 32 is a burned rock feature represented by three distinct clusters, referred to as Clusters 1, 2, and 3
(see Figure 38). Feature 32 was exposed in Trench 17 just to the south of Feature 26 at 60 cmbs. The feature
was contained within the E soil horizon which was a 10YR5/4 yellowish brown sand. Feature 32 was
bisected north/south. The western half of each cluster was removed first and a profile facing east was drawn
(see Figure 38) before the eastern half was removed.
Cluster 1 was an amorphous burned rock scatter contained within an area extending 80 cm north/south by
95 cm east/west. The rocks in the central portion of Cluster 1, an area extending roughly 50 cm north/south
by 40 cm east/west, were more closely spaced while the rocks in the surrounding area were more scattered.
Cluster 1 is thought to represent a disarticulated cooking facility, whose rocks may have been borrowed for
use in an adjacent cooking facility. Alternatively, this disarticulation might have resulted from bioturbation
associated with burrowing animals and/or tree roots. In profile the feature rocks occurred in a single layer
resting on a level plane. A flotation sample from Custer 1 was retained. Flotation failed to yield any cultural
remains. The burned rock in Cluster 1 included 173 quartzite rocks (21.0 kg), 1 chert rock (0.1 kg), 1
hematite rock (0.1 kg), and 7 silicified wood rocks (0.4g).
Cluster 2 was a smaller concentration of burned rocks confined to a roughly circular area with a diameter
of 30 cm. Cluster 2 was found at a slightly higher elevation than Cluster 1. The origins of Cluster 2 remain
ambiguous. It may represent secondarily discarded rocks associated with Cluster 1 or an as yet unidentified
hot rock cooking facility. The burned rock in cluster 2 included 14 quartzite rocks (3.7 kg).
Cluster 3 was an even smaller burned rock concentration that was confined to a roughly circular area with
a diameter of 20 cm. The origins of Cluster 3 are unknown. The cluster may represent secondarily deposited
material associated with a nearby cooking facility. The burned rock in cluster 3 included 3 quartzite rocks
(0.4 g) and 1 silicified wood rock (0.1 kg).

Feature 33
Feature 33 was a small cluster of burned rock exposed in Trench 17 at 57 cmbs (Figure 43). The feature
was contained within the E/A soil horizon which was a 10YR6/3 pale brown fine sand. When Feature 33
was first exposed in the floor of Trench 17, it was not distinguished from Feature 27 directly below and
several of the feature rocks were removed with and attributed to Feature 27. Once Feature 27 was removed,
Feature 33 was readily discernible in the west wall of the trench as a separate cluster of burned rock
extending 64 cm north/south along the wall of the trench (Figure 43). The three burned rocks depicted on
the slight rise in the western half of the Feature 27 cluster 1 profile drawing (see Figure 38) can reasonably
be attributed to Feature 33. These three rocks were separated from the underlying Feature 27 by 2 to 5 cm
of sediment. The origins of Feature 33 are uncertain as most of it appeared to extend into the western wall
of Trench 17. Based on its expression in the western wall of the trench and its superposition above Feature
27, Feature 33 is thought to represent a largely intact burned rock hearth that was utilized after Feature 27
was abandoned.
FEATURE VARIABILITY
The burned rock features identified at 41BP595 varied with respect to volume, rock mass, morphology, and
composition. The volume of the sampled burned rock features, and the individual burned rock clusters that
comprise the complex features, ranged from 1,257 cc to 220,540 cc, and averaged 32,036.07 cc with a
standard deviation of 45,768.27. Only the very largest of these, Feature 29, Cluster 3, had a volume that
was more than one standard deviation above the mean. The total mass of rock in each feature ranged from
0.50 kg to 319.20 kg, and averaged 33.78 with a standard deviation of 68.82. Only the two largest features,
Feature 27, cluster 1, and Feature 29, Cluster 3 had a total mass more than one standard deviation above
the mean. The rock density of each feature, and each cluster in the complex features, was derived using the
formula (Total mass of feature rocks in grams/ Volume in cc). Feature density ranged from 0.04 to 3.76 and
averaged 0.95 with a standard deviation of 1.74. Two features, Feature 23 and Feature 27 cluster 1, had
densities greater than one standard deviation of the mean. Two features, Features 2 and 3, had densities
more than one standard deviation below the mean.
The features and individual clusters in complex features were categorized by their shape in plan and profile.
In plan, most features were either circular (n = 6) or oval (n = 11). The remaining features were amorphous
in outline. The base of the features and clusters were typically either flat (16) or shallow basins (7). The
base of feature 4, however, was uneven. Burned rocks were virtually absent from Feature 4 and it does not
appear to have resulted from hot rock cooking. The majority of the features were constructed with only one
layer of rock. Four features (26, 27 Cluster 1, 27 Cluster 2, and 29 Cluster 3) were constructed of two or
more layers of rock.
The most common rock type used in the features excavated on site was quartzite, which represents nearly
90 percent of all the combined rock used in all of the features sampled. The percentage of quartzite within
individual features and clusters, however, varied and ranged from 65.2 percent to 100 percent by mass.

Hematite and hematitic sandstone were the second most common rock types found in the sampled features
and clusters and comprises 6.54 percent of all of the rock recovered from feature contexts. A total of 16
features, out of the 24 sampled, had hematite and/or hematitic sandstone, which comprised between 0.46
percent and 29.11 percent of these 16 features by mass. Silicified wood was the third most common rock
type represented in the sampled features and clusters, representing 1.4 percent of the combined burned rock
present in all of the sampled features and clusters. Silicified wood was present in 12 of the features and
clusters sampled and comprised between 0.44 percent and 20 percent of each. Chert was the fourth most
common rock type in the features and clusters sampled, comprising 2.22 percent of all of the rock present
in feature contexts. Chert was identified in 4 of the features sampled and comprised between 0.20 and 25.54
percent of each by mass. Rock classified as âotherâ represents 0.21 percent of the rock in these features,
and was present in only two features, representing between 0.79 and 0.86 percent by mass of each.
The type of rock used for feature construction may have been chosen based on its physical properties and/or
its availability. The physical properties of quartzite make it especially suitable for hot rock cooking. Ellis
(1997:54) notes that âquartzite appears to be more resilient than other types of lithic raw material when
heated and allowed to cool in place. In experiments where quartzite cobbles were exposed to repeated
heating/dowsing episodes, the cobbles could be re-used for long periods before they exhibited noticeable
color changes and jagged breaks.â
Feature 4 is thought to represent, primarily, a natural concentration of unburned rock and may be a remnant
of a Quaternary high gravel deposit. The small amount of burned rock that was present in Feature 4 (about
1 percent) is thought to represent a fortuitous inclusion; burned rock is scattered widely across the site. The
composition of the sampled portion of Feature 4 was 86 percent quartzite, 5 percent hematite, 8 percent
silicified wood, and 1 percent chert. It is notable that the composition of Feature 4 is consistent with the
remainder of the features sampled on site, which were mostly quartzite with small amounts of other rock
types.
This pattern is also consistent with the composition of burned rock recovered from non-feature contexts.
The burned rock recovered from feature contexts was categorized by raw material type in the field, weighed,
and then discarded. The burned rock recovered from non-feature contexts in shovel tests and excavation
units was brought back to the Atkins laboratory where it was placed into raw material categories. The raw
material categories used in the field were more general while those used in the laboratory where more
detailed. The categories used in the field include: quartzite, chert, hematite, hematitic sandstone, coarse
grained sandstone, silicified wood, and granite-like. Although finer grained material distinctions were made
in the lab than in the field (see Table 25 below), the results remain comparable. In the lab, quartzite
(including quartz arenite and metaquartzite) was found to comprise just over 87 percent of all of the burned
rock recovered from non-feature contexts. Hematitic sandstone (7.07 percent) and silicified wood (1.89
percent) were the next most common burned rock types followed by chert (1.54 percent). The remaining
nine raw material categories together comprise only 2.33 percent of the burned rock from non-feature
contexts.

The burned rock composition of most features sampled on site, along with the composition of burned rock
recovered from non-feature contexts, as well as the composition of unburned rock in Feature 4, remained
fairly stable. It is therefore reasonable to predict that the more Features differ from the normative pattern,
the more likely they are to have resulted from processes that likewise differ.
Feature 1, with its very high proportion of chert (25.54 percent) and low proportion of quartzite (65.22
percent) stands out as anomalous compared to the other features sampled on site. Although the origin of
this pattern remains uncertain, the simplest source is inter-observer variability, as the distinction between
chert and the fine grained quartzite present on site was sometimes difficult to make in the field. This
interpretation is bolstered by the fact that, outside of Feature 1, very little chert was identified on site in
feature and non-feature contexts.
Feature 15 and Feature 27, Cluster 2, have high concentrations of burned hematite/hematitic sandstone
(29.11 percent and 17.71 percent respectively) relative to the other features sampled on site. Hematite and
hematitic sandstone are readily distinguished from other lithic raw material categories encountered. For this
reason, the apparent concentration of hematite and hematitic sandstone in these features is not likely due to
observer error. The origins of this patter, however, remain ambiguous.
Feature 32, Cluster 3 had the highest proportion of silicified wood (20 percent) of the features sampled.
The origins of this pattern are almost certainly sample size, as the entire mass of all of the rocks in this
cluster was only 0.5 g, making it one of the two smallest features or clusters sampled.
The preservation of charcoal within the features identified on site was generally poor. Although charcoal
was recovered from flotation samples taken from feature contexts, for the most part, charcoal was not visible
in feature matrices during excavation. One possible explanation for this observation is that the fuel used to
heat the burned rocks was entirely consumed during the cooking process. Ellis (1997:53) noted that:

158

National Register Testing at Sites 41BP585, 41BP594, and 41BP595
Three Oaks Mine, Bastrop County, Texas

In the case of the sealed pit, the earth covering would effectively reduce the amount of
oxygen found in the cooking environment. Due to the decreased oxygen content, any fuel
that was not reduced to ash by the time the pit was covered would probably not be entirely
consumed. Therefore, it is likely that the soil matrix surrounding the feature rocks would
contain chunks of charcoal. By contrast, the uncovered pit provides a more oxygen-rich
environment that would promote the complete combustion of large charcoal lumps, leaving
mostly ashes and few, if any, charcoal fragments, especially if the coals are stirred
frequently.
The foregoing suggests the possibility that the small amount of charcoal recovered from burned rock feature
contexts reflects use as open pit cooking facilities. Other processes, including both cultural and natural
transformations that occurred both before and after the site was abandoned may have also contributed to
this pattern. It is possible that much of the charcoal contained within the features was broken down by
natural turbative processes since the features were last used. It is also possible that the absence of charcoal
in the features resulted from how the features were used. If, for example, the features were cleaned out after
they were used and the charcoal and other refuse were re-deposited at another location, lower amounts of
charred remains would be expected. Such a pattern could explain, in part, how the midden (Feature 30)
arose. The fact that burned rock clusters were concentrated around the perimeter of the midden in Area 2
appears consistent with this hypothesis. Alternatively, the absence of charcoal within the features may have
resulted from the feature rocks having been heated before being deposited in the feature pit.
CHIPPED STONE ARTIFACT ASSEMBLAGE
The following section first identifies patterned variability between the chipped stone artifact-assemblages
recovered from each of the sub-site areas at 41BP595 and second explores possible origins of this
variability. The entire chipped stone artifact assemblage recovered during testing consists of 1,313
specimens, and includes 1,274 pieces of lithic debitage, 14 projectile points, 10 bifaces/biface fragments, 8
utilized flakes, 3 unifacially modified flakes, 2 cores, and 1 scraper.
The distribution of these materials across the site remained fairly consistent. Table 26 below lists the
artifacts by type recovered from each site area, along with the âoff areaâ artifacts, those recovered from the
site through shovel tests that were not associated with a sub-site area.

Although each area differed by size, sampling intensity, and artifact density, the types and ratios of the
various classes of material recovered from each remained fairly consistent. For the purposes of this
discussion, hand excavation refers to all hand excavated units as well as all positive shovel tests. Area 2
was by far the most heavily sampled sub site area (Table 27). Area 2 was sampled with 6 m2 of hand
excavation, while Area 1 received 1.5 m2 and Area 3 received only 1m2. Of the 14 trenches that yielded
artifacts, 7 were in Area 2 while 6 were in Area 1 and only 1 was in Area 3. Nine out of the eleven sampled
features were located in Area 2.

Table 27 also presents the artifact density of each sub site area, which refers to the total number of lithic
artifacts recovered for each square meter of hand excavation. The apparent high artifact density in Area 3
is likely due in part to sample size. Area 3 received the least amount of hand excavation of any of the subsite areas. The high artifact density in Area 2 is thought to represent a more robust pattern as Area 2 was
the most intensively sampled sub-site area.
Lithic debitage was by far the most common class of material recovered and comprises more than 95 percent
of the chipped stone artifact assemblages recovered from each of the site areas as well from off of these
areas. The second most common class of artifacts in all site areas was projectile points and/or bifaces. The
remainders of the sub-site area chipped stone assemblages consist of expedient tools (utilized flakes,
unifaces, and a scraper) and lithic cores, which were recovered in low numbers across the site.
The greater diversity and quantity of materials recovered from Area 2, compared to the other site areas, is
thought to have resulted more from sampling intensity and systemic use intensity rather than profound
functional variability. In short, the range of lithic reduction strategies conducted within each sub-site area,
along with the ways the lithic tools were used, is likewise thought to have remained relatively consistent.
Area 2, however, appears to have resulted from significantly greater systemic use intensity than the other
site areas. This conclusion is based on the observation that 20 of the 33 features identified on site were
found within Area 2 or just outside of it, as well as the fact that the large midden represented by Feature 30
was also contained within Area 2.
The range of raw material types represented in the sub-site lithic assemblages similarly remained consistent
across the sub-site areas. In all sub-site areas, chert was by far the most common material type recovered,
representing nearly 90 percent of the raw material types within each sub-site assemblage. Table 28 below
shows the ratios of lithic raw material types within each of the sub-site area chipped-stone assemblages.
Silicified wood, quartz arenite, and metaquartzite represent the three next most common raw material types.
The remaining raw material types, including hematite, chert/quartzite, quartz crystal and quartzite occurred
infrequently across the site.

Notably, the raw material types present within the chipped stone assemblage are present within the
thermally altered rock assemblage, but in vastly different ratios. Nearly ninety percent of the thermally
altered rock assemblage recovered from feature contexts was composed of quartzite while close to ninety
percent of the chipped stone assemblage was chert. Two hypotheses may be proposed from this observation.
First, both raw material types were relatively easily obtained by the prehistoric occupants of the site.
Second, chert was the preferred raw material for chipped stone tools while quartzite was the preferred raw
material for hot rock cooking.

Sub-site Area 2 evidenced the greatest raw material diversity. This pattern presumably resulted in part from
variability in sampling density across the sub-site areas. This pattern also is thought to reflect the more
intensive prehistoric utilization of Area 3 with respect to the other site areas.
Patterned variability within the sub-site debitage assemblages suggests some possible minor differences
between their origins. The debitage assemblage from 41BP595 was categorized by morphology into
complete flakes, broken flakes, flake fragments and debris. Table 29 below compares the ratios of debitage
categories within each sub-site debitage assemblage.

Sub-site Area 2 is distinguished from the other sub-site areas by its low proportion of debris, high proportion
of complete flakes, and elevated proportion of flake fragments relative to the other sub-site areas. The low
debris ratio in Area 2 suggests a reduction strategy less dependent upon primary core reduction. The high
ratios of complete flakes and flake fragments may reflect a reduction strategy geared more towards tool
production, use, and maintenance.

Variation between the sub-site chipped stone artifact assemblages is thought to have resulted in part from
variability in the formation histories of each area as well as the intensity with which each area was sampled.
The ratios of tool types and raw material remained relatively consistent across each sub-site area suggesting
that the activities represented also remained consistent. The Area 2 assemblage appears conspicuous by its
high artifact density and diversity as well as by its high density of cultural features. These patterns suggest
Area-2 resulted from more frequent and/or longer duration systemic occupations than the other site areas.
PROJECTILE POINTS
Fourteen projectile points and projectile point fragments were recovered during NRHP testing at 41BP595.
Nine of these specimens are dart points; the remaining five are arrow points. These artifacts represent
discard spanning the period from the Late Paleoindian to the Late Prehistoric.
Lot 543. This Montell dart point was manufactured from a very fine-grained, slightly translucent, brown
thermally altered chert. It has a long, narrow body with very straight lateral margins extending from a broad
bifurcated base with square corners (Figure 44 a). The artifact is 62.2 millimeters (mm) in length, 21.0 mm
in width, and 5.6 mm in thickness, with a maximum blade width of 13.9 mm. Minor utilization damage is
present to the lateral margins, suggesting cutting usage against a soft to medium material. The extremely
narrow body of the artifact may be the result of retooling to revitalize a damaged tool, or it is possible that
the thinning of the body was for some specialized purpose. The Montell point type suggests a Late Archaic
date, ca 800-400 B.C. (Turner et al. 2011). This specimen was recovered from Trench 1.
Lot 544. This untyped dart point fragment was manufactured from a fine-grained grayish brown chert. The
artifact appears to have been truncated on the lower body, just above the shoulder. The cross section is thin
and slightly convex. The lateral margins are moderately convex with a very regular serrated edge (Figure
44 b). The point does not appear to be finished, suggesting that the artifact may have been discarded
following a manufacturing failure, either during initial manufacture or retooling. Only slight evidence of
utilization is apparent, suggesting some short term unidentified usage against a soft or medium material.
The artifact is 50.5 mm in length, 28.6 mm in width, and 7.4 mm in thickness. This specimen was recovered
from Trench 4.
Lot 548. This Scottsbluff dart point was manufactured from a fine-grained gray chert with a large coarsegrained inclusion on the upper body near the margin (Figure 44 c). The lateral margins are nearly straight,
becoming more convex closer to the tip, and basally recurve out slightly to form weak shoulders. It has a
narrow lanceolate outline with a thick biconvex cross section. The flaking is irregular rather than parallel
and the specimen has been extensively retooled such that no evidence of utilization is apparent. The stem
is squared with base and margins exhibiting very slight grinding. The artifact is 97.2 mm in length, 26.0
mm in width, and 10.7 mm in thickness with a stem 20.5 mm in length and 9.2 mm in width. The Scottsbluff
type dates to the Late Paleo-Indian period, ca 7120-6650 B.C. (Turner et al. 2011). This specimen was
recovered from Trench 11.
Lot 549.1. This Scallorn arrow point was manufactured from a fine-grained chert (Figure 44 d). The point
tip has been broken in an apparent impact fracture. One barb and one basal corner have also been truncated.
A large heat spall is present on one face of the body that appears to be post-discard. The artifact is a dark
162

National Register Testing at Sites 41BP585, 41BP594, and 41BP595
Three Oaks Mine, Bastrop County, Texas

reddish brown in color, probably as the result of the heat alteration that produced the spall. The lateral
margins are straight to slightly concave and slightly denticulate with strong, downward pointing barbs and
deep corner notches. The base is relatively flat and narrower than the shoulders. No evidence of utilization
is apparent. The artifact is 22.3 mm in length, 18.1 mm in width and 3.6 mm in thickness with a stem 7.5
mm in length and 11.1 mm in width. The Scallorn type in indicative of the Austin Phase of the Late
Prehistoric period, ca. A.D. 700 â 1200 (Turner et al. 2011). This specimen was recovered from Trench 15.
Lot 549.2. This artifact is an arrow point distal fragment of an unidentified type, missing the stem and most
of the body. It has been truncated in a hinge fracture, probably a result of bending force. It was manufactured
from a fine-grained light brown chert with an intermittent reddish brown surface effect resulting from post
manufacture heating. The artifact is thin and bi-convex in cross section with finely flaked, relatively straight
lateral margins (Figure 44 e). Little if any edge wear is present. The artifact is 18.1 mm in length, 12.1 mm
in width, and 2.8 mm in thickness. This specimen was recovered from Trench 15
Lot 555. This artifact is an arrow point proximal fragment of an unidentified type with only the stem
present. It has been truncated in a hinge fracture at the narrow juncture between body and stem. It was
manufactured from a fine-grained light brown chert with an intermittent reddish brown surface effect
resulting from post manufacture heating. The stem has finely flaked, straight, expanding edges and a
slightly concave base, lending a âfish tailedâ appearance (Figure 44 f). No utilization wear is apparent. The
artifact is 7.0 mm in length, 13.7 mm in width, and 2.8 mm in thickness. The general morphology is
comparable with a small example of the Edwards type, suggesting a date of ca A.D. 900-1100 (Turner et
al. 2011), but in the absence of the body this conclusion remains speculative. This specimen was recovered
from Unit 1.
Lot 585. This artifact is an arrow point manufactured from a fine-grained grayish brown chert which was
probably heat treated prior to manufacture. It exhibits significant reduction to the lateral margins by
resharpening. The artifact is triangular with slightly convex, beveled lateral margins, weak shoulders, a
broad, slightly expanding stem and a slightly convex base (Figure 44 g). The pattern of wear suggests final
use as a drill against a medium material such as wood. Beveling of lateral margins was probably to facilitate
drill use. The artifact is 25.8 mm in length, 17.5 mm in width, and 4.9 mm in thickness with the stem about
10.8 mm in length. This specimen was recovered from Unit 3.
Lot 594. This artifact is a thin, corner notched, triangular arrow point with straight to slightly recurved,
slightly serrated lateral margins, very prominent barbs, an expanding stem, and a flat base (Figure 44 h). It
is nearly complete, lacking only the point tip. It was manufactured from a fine-grained brown chert. It is
19.2 mm in length, 22.6 mm in width, and 3.7 mm in thickness with a stem 7.1 mm in length and 9.6 mm
in width. Its general appearance is most similar to the Edwards or Sabinal types although the base is less
prominent and unbifurcated compared with the Edwards type and more prominent and expanding compared
with the Sabinal type. Itâs similarity to these types suggests a date in the early middle to middle of the Late
Prehistoric period (Turner et al. 2011). This specimen was recovered from Unit 4.

Lot 604. This artifact is a long, relatively thin, lanceolate shaped biface or dart point manufactured from a
grayish brown fine to medium-grained chert. It has straight to convex lateral margins tapering to a sharp
point and a broad, rounded to slightly flattened base (Figure 44 i). The artifact is 72.9 mm in length, 22.5
mm in width and 7.0 mm in thickness. The base and the lateral margins within about 25 mm of the base
exhibit slight edge rounding, probably indicative of haft wear. The lateral margins within about 30 mm of
the point exhibit edge rounding and crushing and intermittent step fracturing associated with longitudinal
usage against medium material such as cutting and/or sawing woody material. The margins within 10 mm
of the tip exhibit the most intense wear, suggesting perforating or boring of a medium material. The medial
portion of the lateral margins exhibit very slight nonspecific wear. No wear suggests usage as a projectile
point and it was more likely used as a knife. This specimen was recovered from Trench 10.
Lot 605.1. This is a complete example of a large, thick, triangular dart point with slightly convex lateral
margins, broad corner notches, and an expanding stem with a convex base (Figure 44 j). The artifact was
manufactured from a grayish brown, medium to fine-grained chert. It is most similar to the Fairland dart
point type, although the base is somewhat narrower than average for that type. The artifact is 53.2 mm in
length, 21.8 mm in width, and 8.4 mm in thickness with a stem 13.5 mm in length and 17.9 mm in width.
The Fairland type typically dates to the Transitional Archaic period (Turner et al. 2011). This specimen
came from Trench 16.
Lot 605.2. This artifact appears to be a stem fragment of a dart point. It has been truncated in a snap fracture.
It is manufactured from a fine-grained light grayish brown chert. Over its 18.4-mm length, the artifact
expands to 15.9 mm in width and 6.7 mm in thickness. It has a bi-convex cross section and relatively straight
margins (Figure 44 k). Little if any edge wear is present. The marked expansion in width and thickness
from the tip is consistent with a Gary type dart point fragment and suggests a Late Archaic date (Turner et
al. 2011), although it is possible that the artifact is simply a fragment of a perform or other biface. This
specimen came from Trench 16.
Lot 606. This artifact probably represents a fragment of an unfinished preform of a large bifurcated stem
dart point which most closely resembles the Pedernales type. The stem is relatively straight with rounded
bifurcated corners and a deep central concavity. (Figure 44 l). The artifact was manufactured from a finegrained, gray chert and is 36.7 mm in length, 34.2 mm in width, and 6.6 mm in thickness. One lateral margin
shows pronounced use wear to the ventral edge suggesting unidirectional scraping or shaving against a
medium material such as wood with the dorsal edge leading. The Pedernales type dates to the Middle
Archaic period, ca 2500-3500 B.P. (Turner et al. 2011). This specimen was recovered from Trench 20.
Lot 639. This Scottsbluff dart point was manufactured from a fine-grained light gray chert. The lateral
margins are straight to slightly convex, becoming more convex closer to the point, with weak shoulders
(Figure 44 m). Its outline is a narrow lanceolate; it has a moderately thick biconvex cross section. The
flaking is generally parallel on one face and more irregular on the opposite face. Although the point is biconvex in cross-section, it has been retooled such that the tip section is relatively thin. Because of the
retooling, no evidence of utilization is apparent. The stem is squared with base and margins exhibiting slight
grinding. The artifact is 73.3 mm in length, 20.4 mm in width, and 8.4 mm in thickness with a stem 20.7

mm in length and 15.7 mm in width. The Scottsbluff type dates to the Late Paleo-Indian period, ca 71206650 B.C. (Turner et al. 2011). This specimen was recovered from Trench 11.
Lot 694. This artifact, recovered from Trench 8, is a distal fragment of a long, relatively thin, lanceolate
shaped biface or dart point manufactured from a light gray fine-grained chert. It has straight to convex
lateral margins tapering to an oblique point that has been crushed slightly. The artifact has been truncated
medially in a snap fracture so that the base is completely absent. The extant portion is 42.2 mm in length,
23.7 mm in width and 5.1 mm in thickness. Both lateral margins have been beveled slightly and the margin
edges have been microflaked bifacially, creating a very regular denticulate appearance (Figure 44 n). Both
margins exhibit slight edge rounding and crushing with fine fracturing suggestive of longitudinal usage
such as cutting or sawing against a soft or medium material. No wear clearly indicative of usage as a
projectile point was observed and the artifact was more likely used as a knife.
GROUND AND BATTERED STONE TOOLS FROM 41BP595
One-hundred and fourteen ground, battered, and/or polished stone tools were recovered at 41BP595 (Table
30). Many are fragmented or highly weathered and approximately 50 percent exhibit thermal alteration,
with a large number of them having been recovered from burned rock feature contexts.
Ground and battered stone tools are generalized tools in the sense that a single tool may not be functionally
specific with regard to the manner in which it is used or the things it is used to process or prepare. Since a
variety of processes can produce distinctive wear, tools were assigned to specific analytical categories on
the basis of several key variables: the mechanical processes (e.g., pounding or rubbing), the outcome of
those processes, and the material being processed. Microscopic examination of each tool aided in the
identification of the key mechanical processes and the subsequent wear patterns still visible on the tool.
As with all classification systems, there are always those tools that could easily fit into more than one
functional category. Because any specific tool can be used in a range of activities, multi-functional tools
were categorized on the basis of the predominate type of wear still visible on the tool. For example, an
abrader may be small enough to be held in the hand, but it is still the lower anvil stone that absorbs the
pressure of rubbing an object across its surface. By contrast, a mano is a hand-held tool that supplies the
pressure used for grinding. If both types of wear occur on the same tool then the tool would have served as
both a mano and an abrader (e.g., Specimen 618.1). Thus, this tool would be, by strict definition, both an
upper hand-held tool used to supply the pressure for grinding and a lower anvil stone that absorbs the
pressure of some rubbing activity. Examination under 10â20 X power binocular magnification revealed the
presence of eight types of wear on one or more of the tools: grinding, polishing, pecking, battering, pitting,
striations, grooves, and notches. On the basis of examination, the recovered tools were assigned to 16
functional categories (Table 30).

Both lower anvil stones and upper hand-held stones were recovered. The upper hand-held stone is the most
easily manipulated and supplies pressure during the two primary mechanical operations of pounding and
rubbing. The lower anvil stone serves as a stationary platform that absorbs the pressure of pounding and/or
rubbing. By far, upper hand-held stones represent the largest percentage of the ground and battered stone
artifacts recovered at the site.
Among the 113 ground, battered, and/or polished stone tools, six raw material types were observed (Table
31). Stones made from quartz arenite were the most common, and 66 percent of the tools recovered were
made from this raw material.

Lower Anvil Stones
As previously noted, the lower anvil stone serves as a stationary platform that absorbs the pressure of
pounding and rubbing, and both processes produce certain outcomes. Apart from the objective of the
process (such as dehulling nuts or grinding grass seeds), the process itself (i.e., rubbing or pounding), as
well as, the types of surface-to-surface contacts involved (i.e., hard-object-to-hard-object or hard-object-tosoft-object) will ultimately result in different types of wear on the stone. At 41BP595, 16 lower anvil stones
or stone fragments were identified. These included 1 pitted anvil stone fragment, 1 milling stone, 4 milling
stone fragments, and 10 abrader/abrader fragments.

Pitted Anvil Stone Fragments (n=1)
Specimen 676.3 was recovered from the SE Â½ of Cluster 1 in Feature 27. It is heavily eroded. The fragment
is an edge section from a large platform stone that exhibits numerous jagged pits on its remaining face. This
type of wear suggests a pounding, pulverizing or crushing action that dehulls or reduces mass through the
exertion of pressure. The process could have involved dehulling of nuts, or pounding tough and stringy
dried meats to soften their texture (Carter 1977).
Milling Stone/Milling Stone Fragments (n=5)
In contrast to pitted anvil stones, the wear patterns noted on milling stones result primarily from the rubbing
or grinding process. Rubbing combines pressure and friction in order to reduce mass through abrasive
action, such as the grinding down of coarse particles into finer particles, by scouring or scraping away the
surface, or by sharpening, smoothing, or refining. The surface-to-surface contacts vary depending on the
type of material being processed which in turn results in wear patterns with different characteristics. For
example, the mechanical operation of rubbing can be used to reduce the mass of vegetal material (such as
corn kernels, roots, grains, or seeds) or non-plant material (such as clay or ocher). During this process, the
material(s) to be ground are placed on the hard stationary surface or platform, and processing occurs when
an upper hand-held stone slides across the lower anvil stone (see Carter 1977; Kraybill 1977).
Four of the five stones in this category have oval or circular-shaped grinding surfaces that suggest they
functioned as platforms for grinding down substances. On these four specimens (Lots 215.3, 549.1, 679.3,
and 679.9), movement of the upper hand stone was in a circular or rotary motion that created a basin-shaped
surface on the lower stone. For example, specimen 549.1 is a well-worn basin-shaped milling stone. The
peck marks dotting its face indicate that its grinding surface had been refurbished many times. The presence
of distinct areas of polish points to the grinding of vegetal material such as nut meats, seeds, or grains (see
Kraybill 1977; Riddell and Pritchard 1971).
Specimen 677.1 differs somewhat from the other milling stones with regard to its overall shape and wear
pattern. This specimen is a refitted section of a rectangular, bi-planar slab made of hematitic sandstone.
Although weathered, grinding is still visible on the high relief areas of the stone and polished patches dot
its surfaces. Unlike the milling stones described above, the striations on this tool indicate that grinding was
done in a back-and-forth motion rather than a circular or rotary motion. This suggests that whatever was
being ground probably required a heavier exertion of pressure on the stone.
Abraders (n=10)
The tools assigned to this category exhibit a variety of wear patterns, but all have at least one or more
grooves cut into the surface. These types of tools result from the abrasive use of the stone to grind, smooth,
shape, or sharpen a variety of implements such as grinding the base of a projectile point, straightening and
polishing an arrow shaft, and/or sharpening the tip of a bone awl. Although all of the tools assigned to this
category are small enough to comfortably be held in the hand, functionally they all serve as stationary
platforms that absorb the pressure of rubbing. The distinct areas of polish present on most of these tools
suggest they were being used to work softer material such as wood or bone.

Of the 10 abraders recovered from the site, seven are modified sections of silicified wood. All have ground
areas and one or more grooves. Four of them are composed of rather distinct varieties of petrified wood
that have large quartz crystals embedded in the silicified layers. On these four tools, intensive grinding and
abrasion has caused differential wear on the large quartz inclusions layered between the lamina. Specimen
253.1 had been thermally altered, but has a series of deep, lengthwise running grooves that cross cut both
plane surfaces. On three specimens (75.1, 666.1, and 688.1), the grinding has created grooves that follow
the silicified layers in the wood, and many of the grooves are highly polished.
Specimen 315.2 is a fragment of thermally altered silicified wood that is ground and polished on one plane
surface, one side, and one end. Two deep grooves run lengthwise across the plane surface. Specimen 75.1
is a small disc-shaped tool that is battered on both ends. Specimen 666.1is a large square section of silicified
wood exhibiting highly polished areas. While both these tools are polished, the location of the polish
indicates that they were used in a somewhat different manner. On specimen 75.1, the polish is located in
the hollow of wide grooves indicating that an object, such as a wooden arrowshaft, was laid in the basin of
the groove and drug back and forth. On specimen 666.1, one side of the tool has narrow grooves that follow
the silicified layers, and grooves are smooth, but not polished. On the opposite face, grinding has smoothed
the silicified layers and the polished areas occur atop the layered edges. This indicates that one side of the
tool involved surface-to-surface contacts that entailed a back-and-forth motion that followed the individual
grooves, while on the opposite face the surface-to-surface contact involved the entire face of the tool. The
wear pattern on this face suggests contact with a soft material that left polish on the high relief areas.
Specimen 688.1 is an especially interesting tool. This bi-planar piece of silicified wood is paddle-shaped in
overall form, and wedge-shaped in profile. Wear along the narrow end of the tool suggests that it may have
been hafted. The wide portion of the tool has distinct areas of polish on both plane surfaces. The tool had
been flaked along the wide side of the tool to produce an edge, where distinct notches are visible. Wear
along this edge has left the notches rounded and polished, suggesting that it was used to work softer material
such as wood or fiber such as cordage for baskets.
Specimen 215.2 is a bi-planar chunk of silicified wood found in Level 6 of shovel test 80. Wear occurs on
one end and three faces. Intensive grinding and abrasion has leveled the quartz inclusions layered between
the lamina. A series of polished, shallow grooves, of varying lengths, occur across two of the working
surfaces. Ground and polished areas occur on one plane surface and one end.
Three other abraders were recovered from shovel tests. Specimen 495.1 is a rectangular shaped abrader
fragment made of hematitic sandstone that was found in Level 6 of shovel test 140. Wear occurs on the two
plane surfaces. One side exhibits a smoothly ground surface that terminates in a broad notch, angled toward
one corner. The surface of the notch exhibits abrasion, with traces of red and yellow ocher embedded in the
abraded areas. On the opposite side, the surface has been ground and polished, with diagonal, unidirectional
striations cross cutting one end.
A wedge-shaped abrader fragment (Specimen 54.1) was recovered from shovel test 22, Level 4. This tool
is made of metaquartzite and is missing portions of one side and one end; however wear is still visible on

National Register Testing at Sites 41BP585, 41BP594, and 41BP595
Three Oaks Mine, Bastrop County, Texas

169

its two remaining surfaces and on one end. A series of shallow grooves cross-cut both surfaces and it is
ground and highly polished on one end.
A quartz arenite abrader was also recovered. Specimen 119.1 is a small square stone whose edges have
been rounded by grinding. Two closely spaced narrow, grooves cross-cut one plane surface. The wear
patterns on this tool suggest that it was used to grind and abrade relatively hard objects such as stone.
Upper Hand Stones
The ground stone assemblage at 41BP595 includes 80 upper hand-held stones. On the basis of microscopic
examination, these 80 stones were assigned to eight functional categories: mano/mano fragments,
muller/muller fragments, mano/hammerstone, mano/abrader, mano/scraper, polishing stones, seriating tool,
and pestle. Seventeen indeterminate grinding stone fragments were also recovered. Although these 17
stones were too fragmented to determine their functional categories, most were probably sections of upper
hand-held stones.
Mano/Mano Fragments (n=43)
Ten manos and 33 mano fragments were recovered at the site. Manos are hand held stones that are generally
controlled by the palm of the hand. Typically, the direction of use is in a back-and-forth motion that results
in flat facets at right angles to the long axis of the tool (Kraybill 1977; Riddell and Pritchard 1971). While
they are frequently used in conjunction with lower anvil stones, they are also used in combination with
other surfaces, such as wood or hides.
The majority of the manos recovered at 41BP595 are made of quartz arenite (n=34). Twenty-seven of the
43 stones exhibit evidence of thermal alteration; many of them had been recycled for use as hearthstones.
All eight types of wear patterns were identified in varying combinations on these 43 tools and tool
fragments, indicating their use in a range of activities that involved the grinding and processing of both
hard and soft substances.
For example, specimen 61.1 is an ovoid shaped stone that is wedge-shaped in profile. Several old, wellworn flake scars encircle the stone, indicating that it had been modified to comfortably fit in the hand.
Patches of grinding occur across the face of both surfaces. Its overall wear patterns suggest that it was used
in a back and forth motion on one side and a circular motion on the opposite side. On the flat face of the
tool, grinding has obliterated the interstices between the grains, leaving distinctive patches of polish. A
deep groove had been cut into the surface, and unidirectional striations run the length of the stone. Areas
of polish also occur around the sides of the tool. On the mounded side, grinding is concentrated on the high
relief areas and there is micro-fracturing of the interstices between the grains giving this surface an opaque
look. Randomly oriented striations occur across the surface. This mixture of wear types suggests that this
tool may have been a multi-purpose food processing tool used to grind both relatively hard substance(s)
and softer vegetal material.
Specimen 596.1 is a sub-triangular shaped stone that was recovered from Unit 4, Level 5. This thick stone
is made of quartz arenite and is bi-planar in profile. A well-worn flake scar along one side would have
170

served as a comfortable finger rest. Battered and crushed areas are visible on its narrow end. On both
surfaces and two sides of the tool, grinding has obliterated the interstices between the grains, leaving
distinctive patches of polish. This type of wear suggests that the substance(s) being ground was relatively
hard, with repeated grinding producing a heavy buildup of debris.
Also recovered from Unit 4, Level 5 was specimen 596.2, a quartz arenite stone that is sub-triangular in
overall form and plano-convex in profile. On the mounded face, the grinding is concentrated on the high
relief areas and there is micro-fracturing of the interstices between the grains giving this surface an opaque
look. On the flat face of the tool, grinding has obliterated the interstices between the grains and numerous
peck marks dot the surface. This type of wear suggests that the substance(s) being ground was relatively
hard.
Specimen 674.3 is a refitted, sub-triangular mano that was recovered from the NW1/2 of Cluster 2 in
Feature 27. Made of quartz arenite, this large, heavy tool exhibits evidence of battering on its flattened end.
Grinding occurs primarily on the high relief areas on one face of the tool and around its curved edges. On
its opposite face, the tool is highly polished. The polish fills the interstices between the grains and covers a
shallow, but distinct, trough-shaped depression that runs horizontally across the entire face of the tool. The
orientation of the depression indicates a back-and-forth motion that horizontally bisected this face of the
tool. This type of wear suggests surface-to-surface contact with a softer curved surface and not a hard, flat
surface.
Muller/Muller Fragments (n=16)
Thirteen mullers and three muller fragments were recovered at the site. These small multi-purpose grinding
tools differ from manos in that they are generally smaller and manipulated with the fingers rather than the
palm of the hand. They often exhibit distinctive wear patterns such as polishing and/or shallow striations
that are oriented in a more circular or horizontal direction. Both experimental evidence (Adams 1988, 1996;
Semenov 1964) and ethnographic evidence (Kraybill 1977; Riddell and Pritchard 1971) suggest that these
types of wear patterns result from the pressure of a hard object against a soft object (such as a hide, a
wooden bowl, or a basket) and/or they were used to grind or crush softer and more fragile seeds or grains.
The mullers identified at 41BP595 range from 12 mm to 65 mm at their widest point. Four of the 16 stones
are small, irregular fragments; however, based on their overall size and shape, the remaining 12 mullers fall
into roughly four sub-groups. The stones in the first sub-group are sub-triangular in shape and have one
more-or-less flat surface.
Specimen 56.1 is a small quartz arenite stone that is sub-triangular in plan and plano-convex in profile. Its
ground and flattened surface has curved linear striations that run the length of one edge, and curved linear
striations cover half of its convex side. Polish is visible on the high relief areas, but does not fill the
interstices between the grains. This wear pattern is consistent with wear that results from the pressure of a
hard object against a soft object (such as a wooden bowl) while processing grains or seeds.
By contrast, specimens 15.1 and 613.1 are larger in overall size, but have extremely polished surfaces that
fill the interstices between the grains. Remnants of curved striations occur randomly across at least one

face. Such smooth, shiny, or glossy surfaces could have resulted from actions such as rubbing this finegrained stone against a coarser-grained piece of stone; from friction against a softer material such as a hide;
or from the residual buildup of the materials being ground (e.g., oily sunflower seeds) (Adams 1996;
Semenov 1964; Vaughan 1975).
Sub-group 2 includes four quartz arenite stones that are predominately ovoid shaped with one flattened end.
Although weathered, the wear patterns on all four stones are similar where grinding has obliterated the
interstices between the grains, leaving distinctive patches of polish. On specimens 476.1 and 590.1,
polishing is more extensive. On each stone, the flattened end also exhibits extensive polishing.
Sub-group 3 consists of three ovoid-shaped stones that exhibit similar wear patterns. All three stones are
made of quartz arenite, and range in size from 37 mm to 56 mm in maximum dimension. Intensive grinding
has rounded the edges of each stone and left a distinctive polished surface crosscut by curved striations.
The two stones in sub-group 4 are roughly square in overall form. Specimen 392.2 is made of quartz arenite
and is more wedge-shaped in profile. Specimen 679.1 is a well-worn granite fragment and is bi-planar in
cross-section. On both stones, grinding has leveled the grains and the interstices have been obliterated in
places. Patches of polish occur on the high relief areas of the grains. Together, the flattened grains, the
obliteration of the interstices between the grains, and the lustrous appearance of these specimens suggest a
heavy build-up of debris from whatever was being ground.
Mano/Abrader (n=4)
The four stones assigned to this category appear to have functioned as both upper hand-held grinding
implements, as well as abraders considering they all have obvious grooves cut into their sides or surfaces.
All four tools are heavily weathered and thermally altered, but their remaining observable wear patterns
suggest they were used to grind, smooth, shape, or sharpen a variety of relatively hard substances.
Specimen 119.3 is a bi-convex stone made of quartz arenite. Although weathered, traces of grinding still
occur on the high relief areas. On one side, a deep groove has been cut into the surface. Specimen 248.2 is
an oval shaped stone that is plano-convex in profile. Although it is a thermally altered hearthstone, evidence
of grinding is still visible on some of the high relief areas of the stone. A series of shallow, curved grooves
cross cut its convex surface.
Specimens 589.3 and a 618.1 are both end fragments of larger tools. Specimen 589.3 is made of
metaquartzite and has been thermally altered. It is bi-planar in profile and its remaining surfaces and sides
are heavily ground and polished. Portions of a deep groove run diagonally across one surface.
Specimen 618.1 is a wedge-shaped end fragment that exhibits a range of wear patterns on multiple surfaces.
The wide end of the tool has a shallow smooth pit that is polished. Grinding is visible on the high relief
areas of both the flat and the convex surface; however, on the convex side of the tool, two wide grooves
cross-cut the surface.

172

Mano/Hammerstone (n=8)
Based on their visible wear patterns, eight tools were classified as mano/hammerstones. These eight stones
vary in overall size and shape, but all appear to have functioned as both grinding implements and
implements for delivering forceful impact. In addition to ground, polished, and/or pitted areas, they all
exhibit battering.
For example, Specimen 248.1 is wedge-shaped stone made of quartz arenite that exhibits wear on multiple
faces. Visible patches of grinding occur on its convex surface and along its angled end. The flat surface of
the tool has numerous shallow, well-smoothed pits distributed across its surface. Its wide end exhibits
crushed and battered areas. A well-worn flake scar on one side of the stone would have provided a
comfortable place for the thumb to rest while gripping the stone. The wear patterns noted on this tool
suggest that it was used primarily for the pounding and grinding of hard substances.
Two small specimens (Lots 17.1 and 589.1) are broken fragments of manos that exhibit battering in one or
more areas. These small stones may be pecking stones used to refurbish the working surfaces of other
ground stone tools.
Mano/Scraper (n=2)
Two relatively unusual tools were classified as manos/scrapers. Both appear to be end fragments of manos
that continued to be used after they were broken. On both, the break left an angled circular edge that had
been utilized. On specimen 509.1, grinding is evident on one side. Microscopic examination of the grinding
surface shows that polish occurs on the high relief grains and there is little micro-fracturing of the interstices
between the grains suggesting that this stone may have been used primarily to grind or process softer vegetal
material, such as fresh corn kernels or fruits, or was used in tandem with a softer grinding platform, such
as a basket (see Smith 1986). This type of sheen could also result from adding water during the grinding
process (see Kraybill 1977). At some point in its use-life the stone appears to have broken and/or been
modified to perform another function. The circular edge of the stone has one flattened edge and one notched
area, both of which are highly polished. This distinctive type of edge wear indicates something pliable was
worked, such as the sinewy fibrous material used in basketry or the debarking of tree branches (Adams
2006).
Specimen 133.1 appears to be the end fragment of a mano that exhibits micro-fracturing of the interstices
between the surface grains and grinding has obliterated the interstices between the grains, leaving
distinctive patches of polish on the high relief areas. This type of wear suggests that this tool was used to
grind or process relatively hard vegetal substance(s) such as dried nuts or corn. At some point, the stone
was modified to form a circular edge that was then used in cutting and/or scraping activities. Two wide,
polished notches occur along the circular edge of the tool. The polish extends outward onto the surface
surrounding the notches. As with the previously described tool, this type of edge wear suggest that it was
used to work something pliable such as the sinewy fibrous material used in basketry or the debarking of
tree branches (Adams 2006).

173

The majority of stones in this category are small, hard stones with well-weathered rinds. They vary in
overall shape and size, ranging from 24 mm to 38 mm in length. Although weathered, sections of their
smooth polished surfaces and well rounded edges remain. Both ethnographic and archeological evidence
suggest that these small, smooth stones were often elements in pottersâ tool kits (see Cosgrove and Cosgrove
1932; Price and Griffin 1979; University of Arizona 2007); however, the wear patterns noted on the
41BP595 specimens indicate they were probably used in a range of activities.
Seriating Tool (n=1)
Specimen 164.2 is a flake off a large chert nodule that was recovered from Level 9 of shovel test 56. The
large inclusions in the raw material form jagged v-shaped notched edges along the circular edge of the
flake. At various points along the edge, the notches are worn, and polish is visible within the notch and
extends onto the surrounding surface. Striations are also visible on many of the polished areas. The polish
occurs on the high relief grains and is consistent with plant polish. It may be that the seriated edge of this
tool was used to split some type of wide-leafed, fibrous plant for use in basket making.
Pestle (n=1)
A small, loaf-shaped pestle (Lot 224.1) made of silicified wood was recovered from Level 7 of shovel test
90. The tool is plano-convex in profile and exhibits grinding on all surfaces. A shallow groove cross-cuts
one end of the convex side of the tool and a series of striations run lengthwise across the flat side of the
tool. The presence of the linear striations and micro-fracturing of the interstices between the grains suggests
that heavy pressure was applied in a back and forth motion. This tool may have started as a small,
rectangular mano, but extensive grinding may have worn away the edges separating the surfaces resulting
in a cylindrical appearance. Due to the scratches and cracks created by surface fatigue and abrasive wear,
its surfaces have a frosted appearance. This wear pattern suggests that the substance(s) being ground was
relatively hard.
SUMMARY
In general, many of the recovered tools appear to be multi-purpose tools and their general morphology and
associated wear patterns point to their use in a diverse range of activities such as food processing, tool
manufacturing and maintenance, and the working of sinewy fibrous material. Such identifications provide
clues to the range of activities carried out at the site and the resources exploited.
The recovered ground stone assemblage includes primarily upper hand stones. Only six lower anvil/milling
stones or stone fragments were recovered. Although small in number, the wear patterns noted on these
lower stones is heavily weighted toward milling stones (n=5) that involve the processing of substances
through the grinding down of mass rather than through a pulverizing or crushing action such as the dehulling
of nuts. This assessment is further confirmed by the low number of pitted stones with jagged pits (e.g.,
nutting stones) recovered at the site.
Since battering and jagged pitting are the wear patterns most commonly associated with pounding, their
representation at 41BP595 is low; only 21 percent of the recovered tools exhibited evidence of battering.

Three Oaks Mine, Bastrop County, Texas

Further, only 27 percent of the recovered tools exhibited pitting and on the majority of those, the pits were
smooth rather than jagged. This suggests that processing activities carried out at the site were more heavily
weighted toward the rubbing or grinding down of substances.
The macrobotanical analysis shows that the recovered subsistence remains are heavily weighted toward
nutshells, primarily hickory nuts. Since hickory nutshells generally require heavy pounding, this seems to
contradict the above assessment; however, it may be the evidence for battering was unrecognizable due the
fact that a great many of the recovered ground stone were fragmented, highly weathered, and exhibited
thermal alteration. Since 27 percent of the stones exhibited both jagged and smooth pits, this would support
the grinding down of kernels. Given the emphasis on grinding activities suggested by the analyzed ground
stone tools and the presence of grape leaves that are known to have been used as insulating or packing
material (Bush, this volume), it may be that some type of nut cakes or bread were being prepared at the site.
Earth oven baking is also supported by the bulb fragments recovered from Feature 30.
A number of non-food related activities are also indicated. The presence of the ten abraders and four
mano/abraders exhibiting trough-shaped grooves and/or deep notches point to the manufacture and
maintenance of a variety of wood, fiber, stone, and/or possibly bone implements. In addition, the interesting
seriating tool and the two mano/scrapers type of edge wear point to the working of pliable substances such
as the sinewy fibrous material used in basketry or the debarking of tree branches (Adams 2006). The
presence of the grape seeds and leaves at the site also supports these types of activities, as grape vines are
known to have been used to make cordage and baskets (Bush, this volume).
The ground, polished, and battered stone assemblage present at 41BP595 offers interesting clues to the
range of activities carried out at the site. These tools also are consistent with processing the range of
subsistence remains identified at the site.
PLANT REMAINS FROM ELEVEN FEATURES
By Leslie Bush
Thirty soil samples from eleven features at Site 41BP595 were submitted for flotation processing and
identification and analysis of botanical macroremains. The site is a prehistoric occupation located near the
top of a slope overlooking a tributary of Big Sandy Creek in northern Bastrop County. Big Sandy Creek
drains into the Colorado River near Bastrop. Soils at the site are sandy near the surface, and the sands were
clearly represented in the flotation samples. The sands overlie red clay, which was not represented in the
flotation samples. The site area is currently in pasture. Notable vegetation consists of bermuda grass
(Cynodon dactylon, a non-native grass) with post oak (Quercus stellata), juniper (Juniperus virginiana),
and mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) trees at the pasture edges (THC site form 3/13/2000).
Site 41BP595 is situated in the Post Oak Savannah ecological region, which many ecologists conceptualize
as a transition zone between the Eastern Woodlands and the grasslands of the mid-continent (Diggs et al.
2006). The Post Oak Savannah is broadly characterized by sandy soils, grasslands, and widely spaced trees.
The most common trees in relatively undisturbed areas are post oak (Quercus stellata) and blackjack oak
(Q. marilandica). Ferdinand Roemer mentioned walnut trees (Juglans nigra) among the oaks when he
crossed the Post Oak Savannah in 1946 (Roemer 2011 Chapter V), but today the closely-related black

hickory (Carya texana, associated with the uplands) and pecan (C. illinoinensis, associated with stream
valleys) are more common in the southern Post Oak Savannah. Benny Simpson notes that walnut trees in
Texas have been extensively harvested (Simpson 1999:178), so in Roemerâs day walnuts may well have
been more common. Common grasses in undisturbed areas of the Post Oak Savannah include the tallgrass
prairie trio of little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), Indian grass (Sorghastrum nutans) and
switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) (Diggs et al. 2006:116). There is much local variation within the Post Oak
Savannah, however. Near Site 41BP595, variation would have been conditioned by the slopes associated
with tributaries of Big Sandy Creek. North- and east-facing slopes provide protection from the drying
effects of sun and wind and possibly some protection from wildfires as well. Grape vines (Vitis spp.), elm
trees (Ulmus spp.), and forbs such as white avens (Geum canadense) would have grown in these locations.
Vegetation Reconstructions
Modern equivalents exist for most prehistoric plant communities in Texas despite changes in the abundance
and structure of the communities (Diggs et al. 2006:87). The most notable changes on the Post Oak
Savannah since presettlement times include an increase in woody vegetation and the loss of âbottom prairieâ
communities along major rivers such as the Colorado River (Diggs et al. 2006:115-116). Pollen studies
indicate that use of the modern vegetation zones described above is appropriate for understanding the plants
and attendant animal resources available to people for much of the Holocene. Boriak Bog, in adjacent Lee
County, shows Pleistocene spruce-hardwood forests giving way to Holocene oak-grass savannahs with dry
conditions peaking around 5,000 B.P. The Boriak pollen sequence is truncated at 3,000 B.P., but Weakly
Bog, in Leon County, indicates oak and later oak-hickory woodlands during the last 3,000 years, suggesting
that modern plant communities provide especially good analogs for late Holocene Texas plant communities.
A recent study by Bruce Albert in southwest Upshur County offers supporting data (Albert 2007). Some
fluctuations in rainfall and temperature have taken place (Bousman 1998:204), but even decades-long
fluctuations in rainfall patterns seem to be part of the natural background of Late Holocene climate patterns
(Stahle and Cleaveland 1992). In addition, more frequent fires would have made the woody vegetation less
prominent in the distant past than during the last century or so (Diggs et al. 2006, MacRoberts et al. 2002).
Methods
Flotation samples from Site 41BP595 were processed by Macrobotanical Analysis personnel using the
Texas Archeological Society Method, a manual flotation process using 0.3 mm light fraction mesh that has
been shown to provide good recovery (Bush 2012). Flotation heavy fractions were caught in 1.0 mm bottom
mesh due to the sandy soils. In the laboratory, dried heavy fractions were scanned under a light microscope
for carbonized botanical material. One fragment of hickory nutshell (0.01 g) in the light fraction of Feature
20, FS #568 was found and added to the light fraction for that sample. Any flakes that were spotted were
placed in small bags within the heavy fraction bags.
Thirteen flotation light fractions, those from Features 1 and 30, were scanned for material suitable for
radiocarbon dating prior to full analysis. During this stage of analysis, samples were subject to full
radiocarbon protocols. They were sorted on freshly cleaned glassware and handled only with latex gloves
and metal forceps. Screens used to size-sort material were cleaned between samples. Contact with paper
and other plant products was avoided. Only one sample was open at a time in the laboratory. Writing

instruments used for data recording of samples were plastic mechanical pencils. Material removed from
these light fractions for radiocarbon dating is shown in Appdeix B, Table B.1. The material, all nutshell, is
also included in the full identification tables (see Table 32, Appendix B Tables B.3, and B.4).

Once radiocarbon material was removed, samples were treated according to standard procedures for sorting
and identification at the Macrobotanical Analysis laboratory in Manchaca, Texas (Pearsall 2000). Each
sample was weighed on an Ohaus Scout II 200 x 0.01 g electronic balance before being size-sorted through
a stack of graduated geologic mesh. Material that did not pass through the No. 10 mesh (2 mm square
openings) was completely sorted, and all carbonized botanical remains were counted, weighed, recorded,
and labeled. Uncarbonized botanical material larger than 2 mm (roots and rootlets) was weighed, recorded,
and labeled as âcontaminationâ. Material that fell through the 2 mm mesh (âresidueâ) was examined under
a stereoscopic microscope at 7-45 X magnification for carbonized botanical remains. Any identifiable plant
material that had not been previously identified in the material larger than 2 mm was removed from residue,
counted, weighed, recorded, and labeled. Small seeds were placed on the scale pan for weighing, but since
their weights rarely registered on the balance they are not reported here. Uncarbonized macrobotanical
remains were recorded on a presence/absence basis on laboratory forms.

Wood charcoal identification was attempted for twenty randomly-selected specimens larger than 2 mm
from each sample. When fewer than twenty fragments were present, identification was attempted for
progressively smaller fragments until identification became impractical or until twenty fragments were
identified. Wood charcoal fragments were snapped to reveal a transverse section and examined under a
stereoscopic microscope at 28-180 X magnification. When necessary, tangential or radial sections were
examined for ray seriation, presence of spiral thickenings, types and sizes of intervessel pitting, and other
minute characteristics that can only be seen at the higher magnifications of this range.
Botanical materials were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level by comparison to materials in
the Macrobotanical Analysis comparative collection and through the use of standard reference works (Core
et al. 1979; Davis 1993; Hoadley 1990; Martin and Barkley 2000; Musil 1963; Panshin and de Zeeuw
1980). Botanical nomenclature follows that of the PLANTS Database (USDA, NRCS 2013).
Results
Table 32 summarizes carbonized plant material identified in the thirty flotation samples. The identifications
are detailed by feature and lot number in Appendix B, Tables B.3 and B.4, and shows the uncarbonized,
modern plant taxa identified on the site.
Preservation. In all except the driest areas of North America, uncarbonized plant material on open-air sites
can be assumed to be of modern origin unless compelling evidence suggests otherwise (Lopinot and
Brussell 1982; Miksicek 1987:231). Bastrop County received an annual average of 36.5 inches (927 mm)
of precipitation for the period 1941-1980 (NFIC 1987), and it is not arid enough that routine preservation
of uncarbonized plant remains on open sites can be expected. Uncarbonized plants in the flotation samples
are interpreted as parts of modern plants currently or recently growing on the site. This interpretation is
supported by the habits of the plants recovered: They consist of grasses, weedy forbs, and oak and juniper
leaves (Appendix B Table B.2). In addition, there is an inverse relation (r=-0.45) between the number of
uncarbonized taxa recovered and depth in the six levels of Feature 30, indicating that uncarbonized seeds
originate at the modern surface.
Discussion
Wood charcoal. A total of 269 fragments of wood charcoal weighing 2.46 g were recovered from Site
41BP595. Identification was attempted for 255 wood charcoal fragments, of which 125 could be identified
to family, genus, or species. Of these, 79 (63.2 %) belong to the oak genus. Both live oak (Quercus
fusiformis) and white group oaks (Quercus subg. Quercus) were identified. As noted above, post oak is the
most common white group oak in the region. The remaining 36.8% percent of the identifiable wood
charcoal assemblage consists of hickory, probably black hickory. Hickories and especially oaks have dense
wood that burns at high temperatures and produces excellent coals (Graves 1919). They would have
provided good fuel sources for earth oven cooking.
Nutshell. One hundred thirty-one fragments of nutshell were recovered from the site, more than half of
which could be identified as hickory (n=72). Two fragments were identifiable as black walnut and three as
acorn. The remaining 54 nutshell fragments were identifiable only to the family Juglandaceae, which
178

National Register Testing at Sites 41BP585, 41BP594, and 41BP595
Three Oaks Mine, Bastrop County, Texas

includes hickory and walnut but not acorn. Three fragments of hickory nut hull were identified from Feature
30, Level 8.
Small seeds. Eighteen small seeds or seed fragments were recovered in carbonized form. Of these, ten were
in good enough condition to be identifiable. Six belong to the grass family (Poaceae), including one
panicoid grass (panicgrass or bristlegrass). Three grape seeds and one avens fruit were also identified.
Avens fruits have a hooked appendage, enabling them to cling to animal fur and human clothing. The avens
fruit at 41BP595 probably represents a nuisance bur that was disposed of in a fire. Ethnographic accounts
indicate grapes were an especially useful plant, and not just for the edible fruits. Native people in California
used grape leaves as an insulating, moisture-retaining layer in earth ovens. Grape vines and roots are useful
for lashing and in craft production (e.g., basketry), and various parts of the grape plant have medicinal uses
(Moerman 1998).
Bulbs. Two bulb scales were recovered from Levels 7 and 9 of Feature 30. The bulb fragments could not
be identified to species, but they do indicate geophyte exploitation at the site. Ethnographically, bulbs such
as camas and onion are frequently cooked in earth ovens for extended periods to optimize their nutritional
value to humans (Kolande 1972; Wandsnider 1997).
Distribution of carbonized plants. Feature 30 had a higher density and diversity of ancient plant remains
than any other feature. Even the sample within Feature 30 with the lowest botanical density (FS# 567) had
a higher botanical density than all but two of the samples from other features (Appendix B, Table B.4).
Feature 30 was also the only feature from which bulbs and identifiable seeds were recovered. Two
unidentifiable seeds were recovered from Feature 1. All other features contained only wood, nutshell, and/or
unidentifiable botanical material.
Summary
Notable macrobotanical remains recovered from Site 41BP595 consist of wood (oak and hickory), nutshell
(hickory, walnut, and acorn), an assortment of small seeds, and two bulb scale fragments. The wood
charcoal assemblage reflects trees that would have been readily available in the site area and which would
have made high quality fuel. Hickory nuts, acorns, and walnuts would have been similarly abundant.
Additional food plants are represented by the grape seeds and bulb fragments.
PHYTOLITH, STARCH, AND ORGANIC RESIDUE (FTIR) ANALYSIS OF SAMPLES FROM

Introduction
Site 41BP595 is a Late Archaic site situated between 510 and 520 ft. above sea level on a ridge summit and
shoulder 225 m east of a tributary to Big Sandy Creek in Bastrop County, Texas. Excavations completed
in 2013 exposed several thermal features from multiple occupations between 2,500 and 1,000 B.P. Six
thermally altered rocks (TAR) from five thermal features were submitted for phytolith, starch, and organic

residue analysis. Organic residues were examined using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR),
which provides information concerning compounds that were extracted from the thermally altered rocks.
Information concerning foods that may have been processed in association with thermal features was
derived from matches with our reference library of processed plants and animals, while information
concerning the environment is inferred from matches with our reference library of raw plants and animals.
Phytoliths and starch recovered from these TAR were interpreted as representing either the natural
environment or plants that might have been processed.
Methods
Phytolith and Starch Extraction from Thermally Altered Rock
Soil adhering TAR was removed using tap water and gentle rubbing with a gloved hand. This step is critical,
because the phytolith record from post-use soil yields an environmental signal that can âdiluteâ and
overwhelm phytoliths and other microfossils representing the prehistoric use of this item. A sonicating
toothbrush with a new brush head was used to clean several areas of the TAR surface with a few drops of
a mild detergent (5% Triton X-100) added to target areas to aid the removal of particles that bonded to or
were deeply lodged within microscopic crevices. Reverse osmosis deionized (RODI) water was used
periodically to flush removed particles into a plastic container. The liquid wash solution from each TAR
containing the removed particles was then transferred to a 50-ml centrifuge tube. Each sample was rinsed
thoroughly and centrifuged removing clay particles with short-duration spins (10 seconds at 3000 rpm). To
assess the sample a test slide was made. Following this the samples were dried under vacuum, mixed with
sodium polytungstate (SPT, density 2.3 g/ml), and centrifuged to separate the phytoliths and starches, which
will float, from the heavier inorganic silica fraction, which will not float. After several water rinses and a
final alcohol rinse, the samples were mounted in optical immersion oil for counting with a light microscope
under 500X magnification. A percentage phytolith diagram that includes frequency data for any starch
grains observed was produced using Tilia 2.0 and TGView 2.0.2.
FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy)
A mixture of chloroform and methanol (CHM) was used as a solvent to remove lipids and other organic
substances that had soaked into the surface of the thermally altered rock. This mixture is represented in the
FTIR graphics as CHM. The CHM solvent and sample were placed in a glass container, covered, and
allowed to sit for several hours. After soaking the solvent was pipetted into an aluminum evaporation dish,
where the CHM evaporated, concentrating the organic residue in the aluminum dish. The aluminum dishes
were tilted during the process of evaporation to separate the lighter fraction of the residue from the heavier
fraction. The lighter and heavier fractions, often visible as bands in the dish, are designated upper (lighter
fraction) and lower (heavier fraction), respectively, in the subsequent analysis. The residue remains in the
aluminum dish for FTIR spectral analysis.
FTIR is performed using a Bruker Alpha optical bench with an ATR (attenuated total reflection) accessory
and a diamond crystal. The dish containing the organic residue was placed on the FTIR crystal with the
residue in contact with the crystal, and the spectra were collected by a specially encoded infrared beam,
which passes through the sample producing a signal called an âinterferogram.â The interferogram contains
information about the frequencies of infrared light that are absorbed and the strength of the absorptions,
180

Three Oaks Mine, Bastrop County, Texas

which is determined by the sampleâs chemical make-up. A computer reads the interferogram, uses Fourier
transformation to decode the intensity information for each frequency (wave numbers), and presents a
spectrum.
Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) Review
Infrared spectroscopy (IR) is a technical method that measures the atomic vibrations of molecules. It is
currently one of the more powerful methods used in organic and analytical chemistry for the extraction and
identification of organic compounds. The infrared spectrum is produced by passing infrared radiation
through a sample, whether the sample is from a liquid, paste, powder, film, gas or surface. The measurement
of this spectrum is an indication of the fraction of the incident radiation that is absorbed at a particular
energy level (Stuart 2004). This provides information on infrared radiation absorption, heat conversion, and
the structure of the organic molecules. Analysis of specific regions and peaks in the infrared spectrum
enables identification of organic compounds, including both plant and animal fats or lipids, plant waxes,
esters, proteins, and carbohydrates.
The Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer is an instrument that converts the raw data and measures the
infrared spectrum to be interpreted. Advantages of using this technique over others include the simultaneous
measurement of all wavelengths, a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio with a short measurement time.
Since molecular structures absorb vibrational frequencies (i.e. wavelengths) of infrared radiation we can
use the bands of absorbance in the identification of organic compound compositions. The spectrum is
divided into two groups, the functional and the fingerprint regions. These groups are characterized by the
effect of infrared radiation on the respective groupâs molecules. The functional group region is between
4000 and c. 1500 wave numbers, and the fingerprint region is below 1500 wave numbers. The molecular
bonds display vibrations that we can interpret as characteristic of the vibrations of fats, lipids, waxes,
lignins, proteins, and carbohydrates. The portion of the infrared spectrum most useful for this research and
in the identification of organic compounds (e.g., carbohydrates, lipids, proteins) is the electromagnetic
spectra between 4000 and 400 (Isaksson 1999:36-39). The recorded wavelengths of the electromagnetic
spectra are what we compare to the reference collections housed in the PaleoResearch Institute (hereafter
PRI) library. That is, we compare the results from the sample with the reference collection aiming to identify
the closest match. For example, plant lipids and fats are identifiable between 3000 and 2800 wave numbers.
This portion of the spectrum can be suggestive of the presence of animal fats, plant oils, oily nuts (e.g.
hickory, walnut, or acorn), or plant waxes.
Samples from archeological contexts are difficult to analyze because they often result from complex
compound mixtures. For instance, groundstone tools and ceramic cooking vessels are often multipurpose
artifacts used to process (e.g. crush, grind, cook) a variety of foodstuffs or ingredients. Thus, multipurpose
artifacts can create a spectra of overlapping absorption bands with few distinctive characteristics. In
particular, FTIR is a useful technique in the examination of organic compounds in TAR because so few
other techniques can be used. Organic compounds often are deposited on rocks during cooking. Fats, lipids,
waxes, and other organic molecules could be deposited onto rock surfaces as a result of (a) dropping, (b)
oozing from foods being cooked or baked in a pit, or (c) seepage out of or spill over from cooking vessels.
Re-use of rocks is possible, in which case the organics recovered from the FCR might represent multiple
cooking episodes. The PRI extraction method gently removes these organic molecules from the

181

groundstone, ceramics, and/or rocks so they can be measured with FTIR and subsequently identified.
Organic molecules from sediments also can be extracted, measured, and identified. This is useful in the
identification of dark horizons that result from the decay of organic matter, whether plant or animal. For
example, if the dark horizon is the result of decaying organic matter, FTIR will yield a signature of decaying
organic remains. If the dark horizon is the result of ash blown from a cultural feature (i.e. hearth), then the
signature will be considerably different. Below is a discussion of the common organic materials that can be
identified in archeological samples using FTIR.
Lipids
Lipids that are solid at room temperature are called fats and those that are liquid at room temperature are
referred to as oils (Wardlaw and Insel 1996:108). Both forms of lipids can be detrimental, as well as
beneficial, to human health. Consumption of certain animal fats rich in saturated fatty acids can lead to
heart disease, but ingesting omega-3 fatty acids such as EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA
(docosahexaenoic acid), found in both fish and plants, is essential for good health. Lipids, whether fats or
oils, are noted between 3000 and 2800 wave numbers on the FTIR spectrum.
Fatty acids are components of most lipids in humans, animals, and plants foods (Wardlaw and Insel
1996:108). A fatty acid is considered saturated if the carbons are connected by single bonds. Saturated fatty
acids occur in high proportions in animal fats. If the carbon chain has only one double bond between two
of the carbons, then the fatty acid is monounsaturated. If there are two or more double bonds between
carbons, then the fatty acid is polyunsaturated. Essential fatty acids are those lipids necessary for human
health, including normal immune function and vision. Essential fatty acids comprise omega-3 and omega6, alpha-lineolic, and linoleic (Wardlaw and Insel 1996:110-111). Diets high in essential fatty acids reduce
the risk of heart attacks because they minimize the tendency for blood to clot (Wardlaw and Insel 1996:112).
Esters
Esters are components of the biological compounds fats, oils, and lipids, and as such are an important
functional group. In an ester, the basic unit of the molecule is known as a carbonyl. Esters may be
recognized using FTIR by three strong bands appearing near 1700, 1200 and 1100 wave numbers. Esters
are divided into aliphatic and aromatic groups (Stuart 2004:78) or into saturated and aromatic groups (Smith
1999:108). Aromatic esters take their name from their ability to produce distinctive odors and occur
naturally in many plant foods. They are defined by the presence of a benzene ring as part of the alpha carbon
(Smith 1999:108). This is recognizable in the FTIR by the wave number assignment of the peaks. Aromatic
esters are expressed in the FTIR spectrum by distinct peaks located at 1730â1715, 1310â1250, 1130â1100,
and 750â700 wave numbers. In contrast, aliphatic esters do not contain a benzene ring. Some have
distinctive odors, while others do not. Saturated esters are defined by saturation of the alpha carbon (Smith
1999:108). Saturated (or aliphatic) esters are represented by peaks in the ranges 1750â1735, 1210â1160,
1100â1030, with a unique peak for acetates expressed at approximately 1240 wave numbers, the latter of
which can be very strong (Smith 1999:110-112). It is easy to identify the distinction between
saturated/aliphatic and aromatic esters when all three bands are present since they occupy different wave
number regions.

Proteins
The majority of the building blocks for proteins, or amino acids, are produced by plants. Humans do not
have all the enzymes required for biosynthesis of all the amino acids, which are organic compounds that
contain both an amino and a carboxyl group, so many must be supplied by diet. The human body uses
protein from both plant and animal sources to perform key bodily functions (e.g., blood clotting, fluid
balance, hormone and enzyme production, cell growth and repair, and vision). The human body requires
thousands of different types of proteins that are not all available within the body (Wardlaw and Insel
1996:152). Through a process known as translation, amino acids are linked in a variety of ways to form
necessary proteins (Rodnina 2007). The order of amino acid arrangement is determined by the genetic code
of the mRNA template, which is a copy of an organismâs genetic code (Creighton 1993). Amino acids are
divided into standard and non-standard types. The 20 naturally occurring standard amino acids (Creighton
1993) are divided into essential and nonessential types, essential because they are necessary for human
growth and are not produced by the body (Young 1994). Essential amino acids must be obtained from food
sources and comprise histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine,
tryptophan, and valine (Furst and Stehle 2004; Reeds 2000; Wardlaw and Insel 1996:154).
Nonessential amino acids also are essential for human health, but they do not need to be obtained from diet
because the body can produce them. Sometimes nonessential amino acids, can become essential particularly
when an individualâs health is compromised (Wardlaw and Insel 1996:155), in a manner that interferes with
the bodyâs ability to produce these amino acids. Nonessential amino acids comprise alanine, arginine,
asparagine, aspartate (aspartic acid), cysteine, glutamate (glutamic acid), glutamine, glycine, proline, serine,
and tyrosine (Furst and Stehle 2004; Reeds 2000; Wardlaw and Insel 1996:154). Also present are
nonstandard amino acids in two groups, that is, those chemically altered after incorporation into a protein
and those that exist in living organisms but are not found in proteins (Driscoll and Copeland 2003).
Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are a product of photosynthesis in green plants and are the most prevalent group of
compounds on earth. They include sugars, starches, and fibers: sugars are the simple carbohydrates found
in table sugar, honey, fruit, and molasses; starches are simple or complex carbohydrates present in legumes,
grains, vegetables, and fruits; and fibers (cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin) are present in whole grains,
legumes, vegetables, and fruits (Garrison and Somer 1985:13). The four groups of carbohydrates, classified
based on their molecular structure, are monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and
polysaccharides. The following discussion presents a brief overview of the different carbohydrates with a
more detailed discussion of the polysaccharides.
Monosaccharides, Disaccharides, and Oligosaccharides
Monosaccharides are naturally occurring simple sugars containing three to seven carbon atoms. Variations
in the carbon chains create different sugars, including glucose, D-glucose, fructose, galactose, and mannose.
The most important dietary monosaccharides are hexoses (C6H12O6). Disaccharides form when two
monosaccharides combine (Wardlaw and Insel 1996:72). Sucrose, lactose, and maltose are the three most
common disaccharides found in nature (Wardlaw and Insel 1996:72). Oligosaccharides consist of two or
more hexoses with the exclusion of one water molecule (C12H22O11). These carbohydrates are water soluble
and are able to crystallize. Raffinose and stachyose are oligosaccharides found in legumes. Humans (and
National Register Testing at Sites 41BP585, 41BP594, and 41BP595
Three Oaks Mine, Bastrop County, Texas

183

other monogastric animals) are missing the Î±-GAL enzyme that allows for the digestion of these two
carbohydrates (Wardlaw and Insel 1996:80). Thus ingestion of raffinose and stachyose results in gasproducing bacteria in the lower intestine (carbon dioxide, methane, and/or hydrogen) that leads to flatulence
(and discomfort).
Polysaccharides
Polysaccharides (C6H10O5) are complex starchy compounds (cellulose in plants and glycogen in animals).
These carbohydrates are not sweet, do not crystallize, and are not water soluble. They are formed of
repeating units of mono- or disaccharides that are joined together by glycosidic bonds. Polysaccharides are
often heterogeneous, and slight modifications of the repeating units result in different FTIR signatures. The
different types of polysaccharides comprise storage (starches and glycogen), structural (cellulose and
chitin), acidic (containing carboxyl groups, phosphate groups, and/or sulfuric ester groups), neutral
(presumably without the acid features), and bacterial (macromolecules such as peptidoglycan,
lipopolysaccharides, capsules and exopolysaccharides).
The two primary storage polysaccharides are starch and glycogen, both digestible by humans (Murray et
al. 2000:155; Wardlaw and Insel 1996:80-81). Cooking starches allows for easier digestion by making them
more water soluble and available for breakdown by digestive enzymes (Wardlaw and Insel 1996:80). The
two primary types of plant starch are amylose and amylopectin, both are sources of energy for plants and
subsequently for animals (Murray, et al. 2000:155; Wardlaw and Insel 1996:80). Glycogen, often referred
to as animal starch, is a storage polysaccharide found in the liver and muscles of humans and other animals.
Structurally, glycogen is similar to amylopectin. Glycogen has a more complex branching pattern of glucose
molecules, however, that allows for easier energy conversion because its enzyme breakdown occurs only
at the ends of chains of glucose molecules. This makes glycogen an ideal form for carbohydrate storage in
the body (Wardlaw and Insel 1996:81). Breakdown of glycogen yields glucose-phosphate molecules that
either can be converted into glucose by the liver and transferred into the blood stream or broken down in
the muscles through a nonenzymatic process termed glycolysis (Wardlaw and Insel 1996:81,335).
Glycolysis in the muscles during intense physical activity or stress yields lactic acid under anaerobic
conditions or carbon dioxide and water under aerobic conditions (Wardlaw and Insel 1996:336). Therefore,
glycogen is absent in meat from butchered and hunted animals because in response to stress and/or intense
physical activity the glycogen is broken down into lactic acid and/or metabolized by the animal (Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 2009; Green et al. 2006; Sheeler and Bianchi 2004;
Wardlaw and Insel 1996:81).
Humans and other animals cannot digest structural polysaccharides, also known as dietary fibers. Structural
polysaccharides are composed primarily of cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, gum, and mucilage (Wardlaw
and Insel 1996:82). Lignins are complex alcohol derivatives that make up the only non-carbohydrate
component of insoluble plant fibers (Wardlaw and Insel 1996:82). However, pectin, gums, and mucilages,
on the other hand, are soluble fibers found inside and around plant cells that help âglueâ them together
(Wardlaw and Insel 1996:82).
Acidic polysaccharides are defined as containing carboxyl groups, phosphate groups, and/or sulfuric ester
groups. Carboxylates often are identified in FTIR with a signature peak between 1560 and 1410 wave

numbers. Neutral polysaccharides (chitin, chitosan, curdlan, dextran, glucan, inulin, arabinogalactan,
arabinogalactorhamnoglycan, and other compounds that are a result of fermentation or are plant-specific)
lack carboxyl groups, phosphate groups, and/or sulfuric ester groups.
Bacterial polysaccharides are diverse macromolecules that include peptidoglycan, lipopolysaccharides, and
exopolysaccharides. Peptidoglycans function as a structural component of cell walls. Pathogenic bacteria
can produce a thick, mucous-like, encapsulating layer of polysaccharide that cloaks the antigenic proteins
on the bacteria surface. These proteins are used by the host organism to provoke an immune response,
leading to the bacteriaâs destruction. These are referred to as âbacterial capsular polysaccharides.â This
encapsulating layer also protects the bacterium from harsh environments, such as Pseudomonas in the
human lung. Bacteria, fungi, and algae can secrete polysaccharides to help them adhere to surfaces and/or
to prevent them from drying out. Humans use some of these polysaccharides, such as xanthan gum, as
thickening agents in food.
Ethnobotanic Review
It is a commonly accepted practice in archeological studies to reference ethnographically documented plant
uses as indicators of possible or even probable plant uses in prehistoric times. The ethnobotanic literature
provides evidence for the exploitation of numerous plants in historic times, both by broad categories and
by specific example. The presence of numerous sources of evidence for exploitation of a given resource
can suggest widespread utilization and strengthens the possibility that the same or similar resources were
used in prehistoric times. Ethnographic sources both inside and outside the study area have been consulted
to permit a more exhaustive review of potential uses for each plant. Ethnographic sources document that
the historic use of some plants was a carryover from the past. A plant with medicinal qualities is likely to
have been discovered in prehistoric times, with its use persisting into historic times. There is, however,
likely to have been a loss of knowledge concerning the utilization of plant resources as cultures moved from
subsistence to agricultural economies and/or were introduced to European foods during the historic period.
The ethnobotanic literature serves only as a guide indicating that the potential for use existed in prehistoric
times, not as conclusive evidence that the resources were used. Pollen, phytoliths, starch, and macrofloral
remains, when compared with the material culture (artifacts and features) recovered by the archeologists,
can become indicators of use. Plants represented by phytoliths, starch, and organic residues are discussed
in the following paragraphs to provide an ethnobotanic background for discussing the remains.
Native Plants
Poaceae (Grass Family)
Members of the Poaceae (grass) family have been widely used as a food resource, including Agropyron
(wheatgrass), Hordeum (little barley grass), Elymus (ryegrass), Eragrostis (lovegrass), Achnatherum
(ricegrass), Poa (bluegrass), Sporobolus (dropseed), and others. Grass grains could be eaten raw but usually
were parched and ground into a meal to make various mushes and cakes. Several species of grass contain
hairs (awns) that were singed off by exposing the seeds to flame. Young shoots and leaves were cooked as
greens. Roots were eaten raw, roasted, or dried and ground into a flour. Grass also is reported to have been
used as a floor covering, tinder, basketry material, and to make brushes and brooms. Grass seeds ripen from
spring to fall, depending on the species, providing a long-term available resource (Chamberlin 1964:372;

Colton 1974:338, 365; Cushing 1920:219, 253-254; Ebeling 1986; Harrington 1967:322; Kirk 1975:177190; Whiting 1939:65-66).
Celtis (Hackberry)
All species of Celtis (hackberry) produce edible, berry-like drupes that can be eaten raw or dried. The
Comanche would pulp the berries, mix them with fat, and shape them into balls that they would roast at the
end of a stick. Species of Celtis found in Bastrop County include
C. occidentalis (common hackberry), C. laevigata (Sugar hackberry, Southern hackberry, Texas hackberry)
and C. reticulata (netleaf hackberry). Hackberry fruits are typically orange-red and ripen in September or
October. The wood is close-grained, soft, and heavy but not strong. This tree is found throughout the
southeastern United States, ranging west into central and west Texas, southern Oklahoma, southern New
Mexico, and northeast Mexico. It is a small tree, seldom growing over 25 feet high, and can be found
growing along streamsides, in moist soil, on rocky bluffs, on the sides of draws, in washes, and in the deep
gorges of Texas mountains (Angell 1981:80-82; Gould 1962:36; Peattie 1953:465-466; Petrides and
Petrides 1992:171; Wallace and Hoebel 1986:73).
Cyperaceae (Sedge Family)
The Cyperaceae (sedge family) are grasslike or rushlike herbaceous plants commonly found in riparian
habitats. Several members are noted to have been important resources for Native Americans. Many species
of Cyperus (flatsedge, nutgrass) have a tuber-like thickening at the base of the plant or possess tubers at the
end of slender rootstalks. These tubers were eaten raw, boiled, dried and ground into a flour, or baked in a
fire. The nut-like roots also can be roasted until dark brown and ground to make coffee. The seeds of
Cyperus odoratus, as reported by E. Palmer, were eaten by the Cocopah Indians, while the Apache are
noted to have eaten the underground parts of Cyperus fendlerianus (Kearney and Peebles 1960:149, 150).
The Pima are reported to have eaten the small tubers of Cyperus ferax. Cyperus esculentus is noted to have
been a famous plant food since ancient Egyptian times. Fresh or dried tubers of Cyperus esculentus were
chewed by the Pima to treat coughs. Cyperus is a grass-like perennial found in moist ground, especially in
damp sandy soil and waste places, and can be common weeds in cultivated fields and pastures (Harrington
1967:174; Kearney and Peebles 1960:98-99, 149-150; Kirk 1975:176; Peterson 1977:230). Eleocharis
(spikerush) is an annual with round, grooved, and spiked sheathing and a bulb-like base. Eleocharis bulbs
can be eaten raw or cooked. Medicinal uses of Eleocharis include as an analgesic, anti-diarrheal, urinary
aid, and a ceremonial emetic. Stems and leaves were used for making beads, pillows and bedding, baskets
and woven dishes, cooking tools, toys, and games (Hickman 1993:1140; Moerman 1998:208).
Scirpus-type (bulrush, tule) plants are mostly perennial herbs with triangular or circular stems. Recent
studies by taxonomists have resulted in the creation of several new genera, such as Amphiscirpus,
Bolboshoenus, Isolepis, Shoenoplectus, and others. At one point, the Scirpus genus held almost 300 species,
but many of the species once assigned to this genus have now been reassigned to the new genera, and it
now holds an estimated 120 species. In general, bulrushes have cylindrical, bullwhip-like stems, while
three-squares have triangular stalks. These plants were used extensively by native groups. Young shoots
were gathered in the spring and eaten raw or cooked. Old stems were woven into mats and baskets. Pollen
was collected and mixed with other meal to make breads, mush, and cakes. Seeds also were parched and
186

National Register Testing at Sites 41BP585, 41BP594, and 41BP595
Three Oaks Mine, Bastrop County, Texas

ground into a flour. The starchy roots are edible and were eaten raw, roasted, or dried and ground into a
flour for cooking. Young rootstocks were crushed and boiled to make a sweet syrup. Plants also were used
as a ceremonial emetic. Scirpus-type plants can be found in woods, thickets, meadows, pastures, ricefields,
ditches, swamps, bogs, marshes, and in other low, wet places (Britton and Brown 1970:326; Duke
1986:141; Kearney and Peebles 1960:151; Kirk 1975:175-176; Martin 1972:31; Moerman 1986:446;
Muenscher 1980:151; Peterson 1977:230).
Sagittaria (Arrowhead, Swamp Potato, Wapato)
Sagittaria (arrowhead, swamp potato, wapato) species are perennial plants found in the shallow water of
streams and lake margins. The plants have large, arrow-shaped or ribbon-shaped leaves and edible tubers
borne at the end of long rootstocks. Their tubers are solid and white-colored inside, covered with
overlapping scales, and are noted to be much larger in the fall. They are found well below the ground surface
and can be located some distance from the main cluster of stems and leaves. Tubers are noted to have been
used widely by Native Americans. Lewis and Clark described how Native American women waded into
the water and dug the tubers up with their toes. The tubers would float up to the surface where they could
be collected. Some groups also would raid muskrat caches to obtain Sagittaria tubers. The tubers can be
eaten raw, but they have a bitter taste that is removed by boiling or roasting. Native groups often pit roasted
the tubers or boiled and dried them for later use. Dried tubers were later boiled or ground into a flour. The
common arrowhead (Sagittaria latifolia) is the most widespread species in North America (Harrington
1972:29-32).
Discussion
Site 41BP595 is located east of Austin, Texas at an elevation of 510â520 ft in a pasture with native grasses
(Poaceae) and hardwood trees. This site rests on a ridge summit and shoulder in deep, moderately drained
Robco loamy fine sand on a 1â5 % slope. Fine roots and rodent bioturbation have damaged site integrity.
Six TAR samples from five spatially distinct thermal features within the site were analyzed for phytolith,
starch grain, and organic residue (FTIR) to gain an understanding of prehistoric cultural activities between
2,500 and 1,000 B.P. (Table 33).

The phytolith records from each of these samples exhibits similarities indicating that the majority of the
phytoliths are associated with an environmental signal. Typically cool season and warm season phytoliths
both are well represented in the samples. Rondels dominate the C3 (cool season) grass record (Figure 45).
Rondels that are elongated, horned, keeled, or that are noted in side view because they are approximately
twice as long as they are broad also were observed intermittently. These C3 grass forms represent leaves
and stems of grass rather than reproductive structures surrounding seeds, so are part of the environmental
rather than economic record. Saddles formed in Chloridoid C4 warm season grasses also are moderately
abundant. These forms represent short grasses that tolerate drought and the high temperatures of midsummer. Bilobates and crosses, representing Panicoid or tall grasses, were present, but not abundant. This
mixture of grass short cells indicates a local grass population that included cool season grasses that thrive
in the cooler growing months of the year and/or in shady locations and short grasses that prefer sunny
locations and relatively hot, dry conditions. Little evidence of tall grasses, which usually are found growing
in moist or wet areas, particularly in sunny areas along streams, rivers, or springs, was observed.

Phytoliths representing grasses in general include buliforms, which control leaf rolling in response to
drought. Elongate forms, whether smooth, castillate, spiny, or sinuate, are typical of grasses, although
smooth elongate forms also may be observed in Cyperaceae and occasionally dicotyledenous plants.
Trichomes are hairs usually associated with grasses and sedges, while papillae are hairs with pitted bases
typical of grasses.
The hair bases noted are typical of those produced by Asteraceae, but since they are the bases only, other
dicots cannot be ruled out as potential producers of these forms. Dicot knobby forms are often observed in
Quercus, but these were not considered to be diagnostic of oaks or acorns, therefore, were âdowngradedâ
to representing woody or shrubby plants. Parallelepiped long forms also represent dicots. Tracheary
elements are observed in woody plants and are part of the structure of plants that transports fluids.
Microscopic charcoal was present in all TAR wash samples and likely represents charred bits adhering to
the surface of the rocks. Occasionally burned grass short cells were observed, indicating the presence of
grasses in the features at the time of their use.
All of the FTIR spectra were very similar, exhibiting a major peak with a doubling at the top near 1007â
1029 wave numbers (Tables 2 and 3). Due to this similarity, the basic FTIR signature for these samples will
be discussed here. Samples 4, 7, 10, 13, and 17, from Features 15, 21, 23, and 29 respectively, match the
baked Sagittaria (arrowhead) root drippings reference with peaks at 1007 and 916 wave numbers. Shoulder
peaks consistently at 1161, 1083, and 914 wave numbers representing cellulose and/or polysaccharides and
a doubling of the carbohydrate peak at 1029 and 1007 wave numbers match our baked Sagittaria reference
(Table 34). Sagittaria grows in wetland communities with Sagittaria graminea, S. platyphylla, and S.
pedunculata noted in modern Bastrop County (Lewis 1962:17; Turner et al. 2003:686-687; USDA Natural
Resources Conservation Service 2011). Matches to specific roots/tubers are interpreted to represent the
general category of roots/tubers, specifically when matching cooked items. This is because there is a
significant overlap in compounds present in roots/tubers of different genera and even families. Therefore,
in spite of the fact that we report a match with Sagittaria baked tubers for this sample, it also is possible
that this signature was produced by baking another type of root/tuber for which we do not have a reference.
Additional low amplitude peaks in Samples 4 and 7 show esters/triglycerides and protein appearing
respectively at 1741; 1578 and 1459 wave numbers, though no additional matches could be made with our
reference libraries. The double peak at 795 and 777 wave numbers in Samples 4, 7, 10, 13 and 17 also
matches with calcium oxalates, which is a compound found in many cacti and xeric plants such as saltbush
and mesquite.

Feature 1
Feature 1 is a subsurface circular TAR concentration interpreted as an in situ hearth. Rocks within the
feature include chert, quartzite, and hematite as a single level plane. One TAR (Sample 1) was submitted
for phytolith, starch, and FTIR analysis.
The phytolith record from the TAR wash exhibited the typical environmental signal, described above.
Papillae were recovered only in this sample, which might represent processing grass seeds, since these
forms occur as part of the structure of the glumes surrounding the seeds. A single dendritic phytolith, which
are produced in the glumes surrounding grass seeds, also was noted. These two forms together suggest
processing grass seeds, even though the quantity of dendritic phytoliths observed in this sample does not
rise above the quantity considered to be âtypicalâ or expected as part of the background phytolith signature.
Recovery of a broken Cyperaceae achene (seed) phytolith (Figure 46 A) indicates the possibility that sedge
seeds were ground before being cooked in this feature. These phytoliths are usually observed whole, not
broken. A burned grass short cell was recovered from this sample that might be present as a result of
processing grass seeds. A small quantity of charred Asteraceae tissue suggests burning a member of the
sunflower family in the feature, possibly as fuel. Overall the phytolith record is environmental, reflecting
the local vegetation at the time of the siteâs occupation rather than revealing any specific use of TAR.
Recovery of a single sponge spheraster might represent use of water, since these globular echinate forms
are produced in fresh water sponges (Spongillidae) where they are found loose in the sponge body or fused
to the main skeleton (Boury-Esnault and Rutzler 1997). Sponges typically thrive in water that is alkaline
(above pH 7), and their abundance is negatively correlated with turbidity and sediment load (Barton and
Addis 1997; Cohen 2003; Droscher and Waringer 2007; Harrison 1988). Alternatively, it is possible they
grew in moist sediments in the feature. No starches were observed.

Sample 1, representing TAR from Feature 1, yielded low amplitude peaks reflecting major categories
(functional groups) of compounds (4000â1500 wave numbers), and specific compounds noted in the
fingerprint region (1500â400 wave numbers) of the spectrum. Functional group peaks indicate the presence
of absorbed water, fats/oils/lipids, and/or plant waxes (Tables 2 and 3). Lipids are organic compounds
insoluble in water, but soluble in nonpolar organic solvents such as chloroform, ether, and/or methanol,
which along with proteins and carbohydrates constitute the principal structural components of living cells.
Lipids include fats, waxes, sterols, triglycerides, phosphatides, cerebrosides, and related/derived
compounds. Peaks observed within the fingerprint region represent the presence of aromatic rings; saturated
esters; triglycerides; protein; calcium oleate; calcium oxalates; pectin; starch; cellulose and carbohydrates;
and the polysaccharides arabinogalactan, arabinoglucuronoxylan, glucomannan, galactoglucomannan,
glucuronoxylan, glucan, and xyloglucan.
The match with deteriorated cellulose was most common, likely representing detritus from the sediments
or feature fill. A match with calcium oleate is likely associated with cooking, as this compound is formed
when calcium is heated in the presence of fats/lipids. No other good matches were made with material in
our reference libraries.
The presence of peaks representing cellulose, starch, pectin, and polysaccharides including
arabinoglucuronoxylan, glucomannan, galactoglucomannan, glucuronoxylan, xyloglucan, arabinogalactan,
glucan, rhamnogalacturonan, arabinan, arabinogalactorhamnoglycan, and Î±- and Î²-D-glucose suggests the
presence and deterioration of plant material, although no specific match could be made with this signature.
Feature 15
Feature 15 is a subsurface cluster of TAR interpreted as an in situ prehistoric cooking surface. Quartzite
and hematite occur as a single level plane within the feature with root and rodent disturbance. One TAR,
represented by Sample 4, was submitted for washing to recover phytoliths and starch for analysis. First,
organic residues were extracted at PaleoResearch Institute for FTIR analysis.
The phytolith record was very similar to that of Sample 1, discussed above, and appears to reflect the local
vegetation community and environment. No phytoliths were documented that might provide evidence of
food processing using this feature. No starches were observed. Additionally, a Tilia pollen grain (Figure
46 F) recovered in this sample documents local growth of basswood. A saddle phytolith (Figure 46 D), and
a trapeziform sinuate (Figure 46 E) illustrate well preserved grass short cells. Although difficult to see,
Figure 46 G illustrates epidermal tissue containing multiple cells. Recovery of only a few sponge
(Spongillidae) spicules represents freshwater sponges that live on a hard stratum, such as rocks in this
feature. While they indicate moisture, they cannot be interpreted to represent standing water.
Sample 4, representing TAR from Feature 15, yielded functional group peaks reflecting the presence of
fats/oils/lipids and/or plant waxes. Fingerprint region peaks indicate aromatic rings; saturated esters;
triglycerides; protein; calcium oxalates; starch; cellulose and carbohydrates; and the polysaccharides
arabinogalactan, arabinoglucuronoxylan, galactoglucomannan, rhamnogalacturonan, and glucan.

Feature 21
Feature 21 is a tight cluster of quartzite and hematite TAR, in a semi-oval shape. Post depositional
disturbance is due to small roots and rodent burrows. One TAR, represented by Sample 7, was submitted
for phytolith, starch, and organic residue analysis (FTIR).
The phytolith record from this TAR also exhibits a typical environmental signal. Burned grass short cells
were present, indicating that grasses also were burned in the feature, either accidentally or as part of
processing. A cuneiform phytolith (Figure 46 H) displays surface pitting indicating partial dissolution. This
signals the probability that smaller phytoliths have been completely dissolved in these sediments. A single
Poaceae pollen was noted in this sample. Starches were particularly abundant, representing food processing
activities.
Starches were divided into several categories including globular starch with centric hilum, globular starch
with eccentric hilum, sub-angular starch with eccentric hilum, root starch, and Solanum jamesii-type starch
(Figure 45). Recovery of globular starches with centric hila probably represents processing grass seeds.
Some of the globular eccentric starches are typical of those produced by Sagittaria tubers, but not
necessarily diagnostic of wapato tubers. Sub-angular to angular starches with slightly eccentric hila also
probably are attributable to seeds. Angularity results from tight packing of starches within the seeds or other
plant parts.
This rich starch record suggests processing diverse resources such as grass seeds, possibly Sagittaria tubers,
and wild potato. Modern distribution of Solanum jamesii and S. fendleri includes the extreme southwestern
corner of Texas (El Paso, Hudspeth, Culberson, Jeff Davis, Presidio, and/or Brewster Counties) (Turner, et
al. 2003:589). The USDA Plants website also notes Solanum jamesii growing in Ellis County to the north
(USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service 2011). It is rare for any atlas of plants to be 100%
exhaustive in its plotting of modern locations of plants. This discrepancy is not surprising. In addition,
recovery of this starch from TAR in Bastrop County suggests several possibilities. First, the prehistoric
distribution of Solanum jamesii and/or S. fendleri might have been different than modern. Second, wild
potato tubers might have been traded or packed as a food to be carried while âon the roadâ.
Sample 7, representing TAR from Feature 21, yielded low amplitude functional group peaks reflecting
compounds including absorbed water and fats/oils/lipids and/or plant waxes. Other peaks identified in the
fingerprint range indicate the presence of aromatic rings; saturated esters; triglycerides; protein; calcium
oxalates; pectin; starch; cellulose and carbohydrates; Î±- and Î²-D-glucose; and polysaccharides including
glucuronoxylan, glucomannan, and galactoglucomannan.
Feature 23
Feature 23 is a quartzite, hematite, and silicified wood TAR circular cluster interpreted as an in situ
prehistoric cooking surface. Many TAR are scattered around the feature, suggesting a disturbance
subsequent to its last use. One TAR, represented by Sample 10 was submitted for phytolith, starch, and
organic residue analysis (FTIR).
The phytolith signature for this sample is very similar to that of Sample 1, recovered from Feature 1,
including the presence of Cyperaceae achene phytoliths (Figure 46 B). As before, it is possible that the
194

National Register Testing at Sites 41BP585, 41BP594, and 41BP595
Three Oaks Mine, Bastrop County, Texas

Cyperaceae achene phytoliths might be associated with the environmental record or might represent
cooking sedge seeds (achenes). No dendritic elongate forms were noted that would suggest processing or
cooking grass seeds. The starch record holds the clue to plant processing for this TAR and feature. Five
globular centric and 13 eccentric starches, as well as eight sub-angular to angular eccentric starches were
observed. Centric starches are usually attributed to seeds. In this case, all of the globular centric starches
could originate in grass seeds. The globular eccentric starches exhibited mild to moderate hilum
eccentricity, suggesting that some could represent grass seeds, while others might originate in roots/tubers.
All of the sub-angular to angular eccentric starches most likely represent roots/tubers that were processed.
In addition, three starches could be separated out as most likely representing Sagittaria, although the variety
of starches produced in wapato encompasses nearly the entire variety of starches observed in this sample.
Unfortunately, not all starch shapes are diagnostic. Due to the fact that multiple shapes of starches may be
noted in one root or tuber and the fact that individual shapes of starches may be observed in many different
types of roots or tubers, assigning each individual starch to a genus or even family is extremely difficult. In
this case, it is likely that the majority of starches recovered from this TAR are attributable to wapato and
that the remainder represent grass seeds.
Sample 10, representing TAR from Feature 23, did not exhibit functional group peaks (4000â1500 wave
numbers). Fingerprint region peaks indicate aromatic rings, calcium oxalates, starch, cellulose and
carbohydrates, and the polysaccharide arabinogalactorhamnoglycan.
Feature 29
Feature 29 is a large in situ TAR cluster exhibiting five partially overlapping clusters of quartzite, hematite,
and silicified wood interpreted to represent multiple events. Post depositional disturbances include rodent
burrows and small roots. Two TAR samples from different clusters were submitted for phytolith and starch
analysis. Sample 13 was collected from the eastern half of Cluster 1, while Sample 16 represents the western
half of Cluster 3.
The phytolith records for these two samples is somewhat different, suggesting local growth of different
grasses following use and abandonment of these clusters. Specifically, Sample 16, exhibits more warm
season grass short cells, particularly Chloridoid saddles, than did Sample 13. These Chloridoid forms
indicate local growth of short grasses that thrive in hot, dry conditions during the summer. Sample 16 also
contained Celtis seed phytoliths (Figure 46 C), suggesting cooking hackberry seeds. Recovery of burned
grass short cell phytoliths in Sample 16 suggests burning grasses, which might include parching grass seeds.
Sample 13 displayed starches, while Sample 16 did not. Starches observed in Sample 13 include globular
eccentric, sub-angular to angular eccentric, and Sagittaria-type root/tuber forms. These starches suggest
parching or processing a variety of grass seeds and roots/tubers that probably included wapato in the area
of Cluster 1. A few diatoms also were noted in Sample 13, which contained starches. Diatoms might be
present as a result of cooking seeds and/or roots/tubers in water.
Sample 13 and 16, representing TAR from Cluster 1 and 3 respectively of Feature 29, yielded no functional
group peaks (4000â1500 wave numbers). Fingerprint region peaks indicate aromatic rings; saturated esters;
calcium oxalates; starch; cellulose and carbohydrates; and the polysaccharides glucuronoxylan,

glucomannan, and galactoglucomannan. Sample 16 did contain additional peaks demonstrating the
presence of polysaccharides arabinan and arabinogalactorhamnoglycan.
Summary and Conclusions
Phytolith analysis of TAR from five features yields an environmental record of grasses that grew in the
TAR clusters after they ceased being used. Cool season and warm season short grasses both appear to have
been common. Warm season tall grasses were represented by relatively few phytoliths. Dissolution of
phytoliths was recorded, particularly on large forms such as buliforms, which is typical. Dissolution is
common in alkaline sediments that are moist for at least part of the year. Moisture is indicated by recovery
of diatoms and sponge spherasters/spicules in Feature 1 Sample 1, Feature 15 Sample 4, Feature 21 Sample
7, Feature 29 Sample 13. Phytolith analysis provides evidence of processing or perhaps merely deterioration
of Cyperaceae achenes (seeds) in Features 1 and 23. Celtis (hackberry) seed phytoliths were recovered only
in Sample 16, representing Cluster 3 in Feature 29, where they might represent either processing hackberries
or deterioration of hackberry seeds that dropped from a tree that grew in the vicinity of this feature. The
best evidence of probable economic activity associated with these TAR clusters is the presence of starches
in Features 21, 23, and Cluster 1 of Feature 29. Features 21 and 23 contain globular centric starches that
suggest processing grass seeds. Grasses that are not represented by this shape of starch include wheatgrass,
ryegrass, barley grass, and ricegrass. Neither is this shape of starch indicative of Cyperaceae or Sagittaria
tubers. All three features that contain starch exhibit globular eccentric starches that also suggest processing
grass seeds or perhaps tubers such as Cyperaceae or Sagittaria. Once again, this shape starch is not found
in wheatgrass, ryegrass, barley grass, and ricegrass. Sub-angular to angular starches with eccentric hila also
were observed in all three features that contained starch. These starches suggest processing roots/tubers, as
eccentric hila are not common in seeds. Finally, Sagittaria-type root/tuber starches were noted in each of
these three features, suggesting cooking wapato tubers in Features 21, 23, and Cluster 1 of Feature 29. In
addition, recovery of Sagittaria-type starch helps to verify the specificity of the FTIR match to baked
Sagittaria-type tubers that was observed in these three features and also Feature 15 and Cluster 3 from
Feature 29. Deteriorated cellulose was noted in the FTIR record for Feature 1, where it represents
deterioration of vegetation in the sediment or feature fill. Calcium oleate, which is produced when fats/lipids
are heated in the presence of calcium, is represented by paired peaks in Feature 1. Peaks representing
calcium oxalates, which are present in many cacti as well as plants in the Chenopodiaceae (goosefoot
family), Salicaceae (willow family), legumes (including mesquite) and other families were noted in
Features 15, 21, 23, and 29, where it likely represents part of the environmental signal.
RESULTS OF THE RADIOCARBON ANALYSIS
Eight radiocarbon samples were submitted to Beta Analytic for analysis. The conventional radiocarbon
dates returned from Beta Analytic were calibrated using Calib version 5.0 (Stuiver and Reimer 1993). The
two sigma date ranges are depicted graphically in Figure 47 below, with the relative area under the
probability curve. All of the materials selected for radiocarbon analysis were recovered through flotation.
Four of the flotation samples were taken from Feature 30, the buried anthrogenic A soil horizon. The
remaining flotation samples were obtained from between the rocks of burned rock cooking facilities. Two

samples were recovered from Feature 29, one from cluster 1 and the second from cluster 2. One sample
came from Feature 1 and one came from Feature 21. All of the charcoal samples were burned nutshells.
The sample from Feature 21 was from a black walnut and the sample from Feature 29 cluster 1 was from a
hickory/walnut. All of the remaining samples were from hickory nuts. Burned nut shells were chosen
because they reasonably can be considered to be a byproduct of systemic human behavior, specifically,
food production.
The calibrated two sigma date ranges overlap only twice. The assays from Feature 1 and Feature 21 overlap
during an 80 year period from A.D. 4 to A.D. 84. The date ranges from two of the four Feature 30 samples,
those from Unit 1 Level 9 and Unit 2, Level 8, overlap during a 105 year period extending from A.D. 433
to A.D. 538. The samples from Feature 29 cluster 1 and Feature 30, Unit 1, Level 7, appear to represent
events that may have been separated by as little as 34 years. Similarly, the samples from Feature 29, cluster
4 and Feature 30, Unit 2, Level 6, appear to represent events that may have been separated by as little as 44
years.
The date ranges for the samples from Feature 30, Unit 1, Level 7 and Feature 29, nearly overlap, suggesting
they represent occupations that occurred closely in time. However, when the portion of the date ranges
under the probability curve is considered, the sample from Feature 30, Unit 1, Level 7 appears to predate
the sample from Feature 29, Cluster 1, perhaps by as much as 100 years. Similarly, the date ranges from
Feature 29, Cluster 4 and Feature 30, Unit 2, Level 6 are close but do not overlap and most likely represent
separate occupations.
Clusters 1 and 4 of Feature 29 are thought to have resulted from distinct cooking events. Cluster 1 and 4
were separated by about 3.5 m, a space taken by two other burned rock clusters (2 and 3). Cluster 1 was a
small tight cluster of burned rocks thought to represent a relatively intact cooking facility. Cluster 4 was a
larger, somewhat looser, cluster of burned rocks thought to represent a partially disarticulated cooking
facility. The rocks from Cluster 4 may have been partially scavenged to build Cluster 3, which is thought
to represent a largely intact cooking facility. The two sigma date range for Cluster 1 was A.D. 1049 to 1084,
A.D. 1124 to 1136, and A.D. 1150 to 1256. The two sigma date range for Cluster 4 was much earlier,
extending from 1110 B.C. to 894 and 867 B.C. to 854. These are the earliest and latest dates returned from
the site. The events represented by clusters 1 and 4 were separated minimally by 1,903 years.
The dates returned from the burned rock cooking facilities and the buried anthrogenic A horizon, suggest a
pattern of repeated occupation during a period potentially lasting more than 2,000 years, from 1110 B.C. to
A.D. 1150. The fact that there is very little overlap between the date ranges is consistent with the
interpretation that the site resulted from multiple occupational episodes. The buried anthrogenic A horizon
and the burned rock features presumably arose concurrently and resulted from related systemic cultural
processes, namely the large scale subsistence processing of a variety of resources, including hickory nuts,
and the secondary discard of the refuse generated from this activity.
The assemblage of temporally diagnostic lithic artifacts recovered during testing from 41BP595 includes
nine dart points and five arrow points that span the period from the Late Paleoidnian to the Late Prehistoric
Period. Six of the dart points and three of the arrow points were sufficiently complete to assign, at least
198

Three Oaks Mine, Bastrop County, Texas

provisionally, to a type. The remainder of this assemblage was categorized only generally as either dart
points or arrow points.
The assemblage of typed dart points includes 2 Late Paleoindian (Scottsbluff) specimens, 1 Middle Archaic
Specimen (Pedernales), 1 Middle to Transitional Archaic (Gary) specimen, and two Late Archaic specimens
(Montell and Fairland). The assemblage of typed arrow points includes 1 Edwards/Sabinal-like specimen,
1 Edwards-like specimen, and 1 Scallorn specimen, all of which are thought to date to the Late Prehistoric.
All of these specimens, with the exception of the Scottsbluff and the Pedernales points, were likely
discarded during the roughly 2000 year period defined by the calibrated two sigma radiocarbon date ranges
returned from samples recovered from feature contexts. Site 41BP595 appears to have been most
intensively occupied during this period.
SITE 41BP595 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Site 41BP595 is an expansive burned rock hearth field and lithic scatter that resulted from multiple
occupational episodes during the period from the Late Paleoindian to the Late Prehistoric. A large, buried,
organic-rich anthrogenic horizon, or midden, was identified that is thought to have arisen through the
discard of organic refuse produced through subsistence processing , including the use of the burned rock
cooking facilities present on site. Based on four calibrated two sigma radiocarbon dates, returned from
radiocarbon assays of burned nutshell samples recovered from the midden, the midden appears to have
arisen during the period from the Late Archaic to the early part of the Late Prehistoric.
Three sub-site areas were defined based on clinal variation of artifacts across the site. Based on the density
and diversity of cultural materials, sub-site Area 2 was the most intensively utilized part of the site.
Calibrated two-sigma radiocarbon dates returned from Area 2 samples, along with the assemblage of
temporally sensitive projectile points from the area suggest Area 2 was most intensively utilized during the
latter part of the Late Archaic to the early part of the Late Prehistoric period.
Sub-site Area 1 appears to have witnessed the earliest occupation identified on site, represented by two
Scottsbluff dart points and potentially by an un-typed lanceolate dart point. Area 1, like Area 2, appears to
have resulted from multiple occupational episodes. A burned nutshell recovered from Area 1 returned a two
sigma calibrated date range extending from 40 B.C. to A.D. 80. No temporally sensitive artifacts were
recovered from Area 3 and no radiocarbon dates were obtained. Based on the high number of cultural
features identified in Area 1, it seems very likely that it resulted from multiple occupational episodes.
A sample of burned rocks recovered from feature contexts was submitted to Paleo Research Institute for
residue, starch, and phytolith analysis. This work suggests that the features resulted in part from processing
tubers and perhaps grass seeds and hackberry fruit for subsistence. Macrobotanical analysis of flotation
samples recovered from feature contexts suggests that these features were also used to process mast
resources for subsistence.
Research at 41BP595 identified intact burned rock features and a large midden area with preserved
subsistence and spent fuel remains. This work indicates that the site is likely to yield additional information
important to prehistory. Consequently, site 41BP595 is thought to merit NRHP listing under Criterion D.

For this reasons, it is recommended that impact to 41BP595 stemming from mine related development be
avoided. If this is not possible, it is recommended that impacts to the site be mitigated though the
implementation of data recovery investigations following a research design approved by the THC.
PROJECT SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
At the request of Luminant, National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) eligibility testing was conducted
at historic sites 41BP585 and 41BP594 and prehistoric site 41BP595. These sites are located in Bastrop
County, Texas within the Three Oaks Mine, owned and operated by Luminant. Impacts to all three sites are
anticipated as a result of planned mine development. This work took place between October 2012 and July
2013.
This work demonstrated that significant archeological deposits, which contribute to the overall NRHP
eligibility statuses of the historic sites, are absent at both. Standing architecture at 41BP594, however, has
previously been determined to be eligible for listing on the NRHP (Martin 2001). Archival research
conducted as part of the current investigation into the histories of the historic sites remains inconclusive
with respect to the identity of their 1870âs and earlier occupants.
Site 41BP585 does not appear to warrant NRHP inclusion under any eligibility criteria. No further
investigation and granting cultural resources clearance are recommended. Although no archeological
deposits at site 41BP594 appear to warrant NRHP inclusion, the standing structure has previously been
determined to be eligible for NRHP listing. It is recommended that impact to the standing structure on
41BP594 be avoided. If this is not possible it is recommended that mine impacts be mitigated following a
research design approved by the THC.
Testing at prehistoric site 41BP595 indicated it resulted from multiple occupational episodes during the
period from the late Paleoindian to the Late Prehistoric. Shovel testing and mechanical trenching revealed
the presence of an expansive buried anthrogenic A soil horizon, or midden, replete with preserved
subsistence remains. Mechanical trenching also exposed a variety of burned rock cooking facilities partially
surrounding the midden area. Radiocarbon assays of burned nut shells recovered from feature contexts,
along with the assemblage of diagnostic lithic artifacts, suggest the site was most intensively occupied from
the Late Archaic to the early Late Prehistoric. A suite of special studies was conducted on burned rock
samples recovered from four of the better preserved burned rock features. These studies, which include
residue, starch, and phytolith analysis, suggest that the burned rock features were used in part to process
tubers/roots and grass seeds and potentially hackberry fruit for subsistence. Macrobotanical analysis of
flotation samples recovered from feature contexts identified spent fuel remains including oak and hickory
wood and subsistence remains including oak, hickory, black walnut, and acorn burned nut shells. A small
amount of burned bulb, possibly representing wild onion, was also recovered through flotation. The
presence of these remains in the NRHP testing assemblage indicates that data resources significant to
understanding the prehistoric period in Bastrop County have been preserved on site. For these reasons site
41BP595 is thought to merit NRHP listing under Criterion D. It is recommended that impact to 41BP595
stemming from mine related development be avoided. If this is not possible, it is recommended that impacts
to the site be mitigated though the implementation of data recovery investigations following a research
design approved by the THC.

County, Texas
Compound

Description

Source

Â· Organic compounds that contain the
carbonyl group (âªC=O) (Davis et al.
1984:851).
Â· Ubiquitous in nature (O'Brien et al. 2006).

Â· Compounds naturally emitted by plants
(O'Brien, et al. 2006).
Â· Formed by the oxidation of alcohols (e.g.
formaldehyde (methanol), acetaldehyde
(ethanol), propionaldehyde (propanol)
(Davis, et al. 1984:851).

LIPIDS:
Aldehydes

ESTERS: (Components of fats, oils, and lipids)
Triglycerides

Â· Esters with fairly high molecular masses
derived from fats and oils.
Â· These esters are more saturated if they
come from animal fats, and less saturated
if they come from plant fats.

Â· Plants and animals.
Â· Nuts, seeds, meat.

Aliphatic esters
(saturated and unsaturated)

Â· Esters of fatty acids (more saturated from
fats, less saturated from oils) (Davis, et al.
1984:844).

Â· Common in plants and animals (Davis, et
al. 1984:845).

Aromatic esters

Â· Responsible for flavors and smells (Davis,
et al. 1984:843).

Â· Plant parts (fruits, flowers, bark, etc.) (e.g.
cinnamon, mint) (Davis, et al. 1984:843).

Â· A simple monosaccharide found in plants,
soluble in both hot and cold water,
crystallizes.

Â· Plants.

Â· Polysaccharide composed only of glucose
molecules linked by glycosidic bonds
(specific type of bonds linking sugars).
Â· Found in association with pectin (Stephen
et al. 2006).

Â· Resides in the cell walls of plants and trees
and many forms of bacteria and fungi
(Stephen, et al. 2006).

Â· Straight-chain glucose polymer linked by
beta bonds (Wardlaw and Insel 1996:82).

Â· Plants.

Galactoglucomannan

Â· Water-soluble hemicellulose, consisting of
galactose, glucose and mannose (WillfÃ¶r et
al. 2008).

Â· Plants (Stephen 1982).
Â· Woody tissue of all coniferous plants
(Bochicchio and Reicher 2003), Trifolium
(clover) (Buchala and Meier 1973).

Glucomannan

Â· Soluble fiber used to treat constipation by
decreasing fecal transit time (Bochicchio
and Reicher 2003; Marzio 1989).

Â· Roots or corms and in the wood of conifers
and dicotyledons (dicots) (Bochicchio and
Reicher 2003).

Glucuronoxylans
(abbreviated GX)

Description
Â· Hemicellulosic plant cell wall
polysaccharide composed primarily of
glucuronic acid and xylose (Awano et al.
2000).

Source
Â· Secondary cell walls of hardwoods
(Awano, et al. 2000:72).
Â· Fruits, nutshells, sunflower hulls, and
coneflower (Rudbeckia) (Ebringerova et al.
2005:8).

Xyloglucan

Â· Important for plant cell wall growth and
repair (Moore and Saehelin 1988).

Â· Most dicotyledonous plants and in all
vascular plants (Fry 1989).

Arabinan

Â· Essential for the function of guard cells,
which play a key role in the ability of
plants to survive on dry land (Jones et al.
2003:11783).

Â· Terrestrial plants.

Arabinogalactan

Â· Composed of arabinose and galactose.
Â· Sugar found in plant carbohydrate
structures, particularly gums and
hemicelluloses. Bonds with proteins to
repair damage (Nothnagel 2000).

Â· Most plants.
Â· Widely distributed in flowering plants.

Pectin, Gums, and Mucilages:

Arabinogalactorhamnoglycan
(pectic)

Â· Terrestrial plants (cell walls) (Capek et al.
1999; Kacurakova et al. 2000).

Arabinoglucuronoxylan

Â· Often used for its gelling or thickening
action.

Â· The cell walls of softwoods and
herbaceous plants (Sjostrom 1981).

Rhamnogalacturonan
(pectic)

Â· Composed primarily of rhamnose and
galacturonic acid (Willats et al. 2001).
Â· Results from the degradation of pectin
(Willats, et al. 2001).

Â· Terrestrial Plants (cell walls) (Willats, et
al. 2001).

Pectin, Gums, and Mucilages (Continued):
Pectin

Â· Composed of linear or branched forms of
simple sugars, primarily rhamnose.
Â· Often used for its gelling or thickening
action.

Â· Apples, plums, gooseberries, and citrus.

MINERALS:
Calcium Oleate

Calcium Oxalate
(abbreviated CaOx)

Appendix A-6

Â· Calcium salt formed when calciumcontaining alkaline materials, such as
limestone or shell, are combined with oleic
acid (common in many plant and animal
fats) through heating.
Â· CaC2O4 or Ca (COO)2
Â· Crystal forms include styloids, raphids,
pyramids, or rosettes.
Â· Primary function of calcium oxalate
formation in plants is to regulate
high-capacity calcium and protect against
herbivory (Franceschi and Nakata
2005:41).

Â· Most abundant in plant leaves and roots
(Patnaik 2003:765).
Â· Populus (cottonwood), Salix (willow),
Agave, Yucca, Cactaceae (cacti), Nicotiana
(tobacco), Datura, all members of the
Fabaceae or legume family, and various
plants in the Chenopodiaceae such as
Atriplex (saltbush), Chenopodium
