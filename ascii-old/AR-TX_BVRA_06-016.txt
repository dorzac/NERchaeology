ABSTRACT
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) and Dixie Environmental
Services Co., LP (DESCO) were retained by Kevin and Audra Strickland of Lufkin,
Texas to assess the need for a formal archaeological survey on land within the
Angelina National Forest in San Augustine County, Texas that will be affected by
construction of power poles in order to provide electricity to the Strickland residence
on private land within the forest. Phil Bishop and J. Phillip Washington visited the
project area on March 30, 2010 in order to make an initial determination regarding
the need for shovel testing. They found the area to be disturbed and determined it
to be an unlikely setting for a significant prehistoric site due to its distance from a
permanent source of water. They also saw no evidence of a historic site. No
shovel testing was conducted, as this was only an assessment that was verbally
approved by Barbara J. Williams (Heritage Program Manager) at the Lufkin office of
the National Forests and Grasslands in Texas. The recommendation of this
assessment is that no formal survey is necessary.

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The official name for this project is the “Strickland Power Corridor” project,
and it consists of 2173 feet of proposed utility line from an existing pole at the Oak
Grove Church in southern San Augustine County, Texas (Figure 1) to the area
where a new power pole will be installed on property owned by Kevin and Audra
Strickland of Lufkin, Texas. In order to bring electricity to Ms. Strickland, ten new
power poles will have to be erected on land owned by the National Forest Service.
The new poles are usually between thirty and forty feet in height and six to eight
inches in diameter. Each pole will be placed in a hole approximately five feet deep.
The spacing between most of the poles will be between 220 to 300 feet depending
on the local terrain. Of the ten poles, one was added since this assessment was
performed and will be located fifty feet south of the existing active pole at the Oak
Grove Church where service will begin. From that point, four poles will be placed in
an existing power corridor (old right-of-way) through a thickly wooded area for a
distance of 1088 feet from the existing pole. At that point, the route crosses to the
west side of Forest Service Road 317, and poles 6-9 will be placed within the road
right-of-way when possible for a distance of approximately 700 feet. The ninth pole
(referred to as the angle pole) will also be on the west side of the road, and it will be
used to make the final drop to the Strickland’s property line (Debbie Dane at Deep
East Texas Electric Cooperative, personal communication). The location of the
poles is depicted in Figure 2. The project area is depicted on the Veach USGS
7.5’ topographic quadrangle (3194-113) (Figure 3). The project area is located in
Forest Service Compartment 35.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
This project was performed in order to assess the potential for significant
cultural resources within the Area of Potential Effect (APE) and to recommend a
formal survey if the APE was found to be a high probability area for significant
archaeological sites. This project was coordinated by BVRA and DESCO. The
field assessment was performed by Phil Bishop and J. P. Washington on March
30, 2010, and it involved 16 person hours. The final location of the power line,
power poles, guy lines, anchors, and conductors will be identified by Deep East
Texas Electric Cooperative, Inc. of San Augustine, Texas under Work Order 211.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas was checked
for the presence of previously recorded sites and archaeological surveys and
projects in the project area and vicinity. Relevant archaeological reports
documenting work in San Augustine County were reviewed in order to become
familiar with the types of prehistoric and historic sites found in the area. The project
area was investigated by two archaeologists who conducted a field assessment in
order to determine the need for a formal survey. The entire route of the APE was
walked, and the assessors looked for obvious signs of disturbance. No shovel tests
or ground disturbing activities were conducted. They took notes and documented
the area with a digital camera and hand-held GPS.

RESULTS
Examination of the files at TARL in Austin, Texas and the Atlas revealed two
previously recorded prehistoric sites in the general area. Site 41SA90, also known
as the W. W. Carrol site, is described as an “occupational area” on a high sandy hill
overlooking the Angelina River floodplain. This site was first investigated in 1949
by R. L. Stephenson prior to the construction of McGee Bend Reservoir (now Sam
Rayburn Reservoir). According to the site form, no artifacts were observed, and the
cultural affiliation is indefinite. No further work was recommended. Site 41SA172
was recorded in 1993 by Forest Service Archaeologist Velicia Hubbard as an
Archaic campsite containing mostly lithic debitage. This site is located on a high hill
overlooking Sam Rayburn Reservoir. The nearest water source to this site was the
Angelina River that is 1000 meters to the southwest. Ms. Hubbard recommended
further work be conducted to determine the significance of this site. The Oak Grove
Baptist Church is located approximately 20 feet from the pole that the proposed
utility line will connect to, and the Oak Grove Cemetery (SA-C114) is located 122
feet behind the church. The entire APE has been disturbed through logging
activities and construction of Forest Service Road 317. In addition, clay was
observed at the surface over much of the area. That portion of the proposed utility
line that follows the existing power corridor passes through a relatively young pine
forest that was planted after the former forest was logged (Figure 4). Remains of
the previous utility line were seen in the form of bases of power poles that have
been cut down (Figure 5).

RECOMMENDATIONS
No evidence of a prehistoric or historic site was found as a result of this
assessment. It is recommended that the client be allowed to proceed with
construction as planned. Should evidence of an archaeological site be encountered
during excavation for installation of poles at any of the areas investigated, all work
must stop until the THC can evaluate the situation.
