WESTERN GULF COASTAL PLAIN PHYSIOGRAPHY
Richard U.

Birdseye and Saul Aronow

The field trip will traverse a portion of the western Gulf
Coastal Plain physiographic province.
This region can be divided
into three distinct areas consisting of (1) inland dissected
Tertiary uplands with relief commonly in excess of 300 feet, (2)
gently sloping Quaternary terraces near the coast and along the
major drainages, and (3) active fluvial, deltaic, and strandplainbarrier systems of Holocene age.
Nine major river systems drain
the western Gulf Coastal Plain, which include (from west to east)
the Rio Grande, Colorado, Brazos, Trinity, Neches, Sabine, Red,
Mississippi, and Pearl rivers.
The stratigrapic history of the Pleistocene units of the Gulf
Coast region is complex and only the essential points will be
considered here.
In the late 1930's and early 1940's H. N. Fisk, based on his
Pleistocene mapping in the Red River area of north-central Louisiana,
elaborated a comprehensive and persuasive scheme for the origin and
stratigraphy of the Pleistocene Gulf Coast alluvial plain-deltaic
complexes (see, e.g. Fisk, 1939).
The major concept is that the
deposition of the coast-paralleling units is related to sea level
changes generated by the advance and retreat of Pleistocene
glaciers; units would be regressive and laid down during times of
high sea level, then eroded and incised during lower sea level.
Four high sea-level stages would correspond to the three
interglacials (Aftonian, Yarmouth, and Sangamon) between the
Nebraskan, Kansan, Illinoian, and Wisconsin stages, respectively,
and to one ice retreat during the Wisconsin.
Four formations have
been mapped in Louisiana from oldest to youngest:
Williana,
Bentley, Montgomery, and Prairie.
These formations were first
mapped in Texas between the Sabine and Neches Rivers by H. A.
Bernard (1950).
Further development of the concepts and some
applications in Texas were made later by Bernard and LeBlanc (1962;
1965).
The Fiskian scheme was adopted for the first edition of the
Houston Sheet (Barnes, 1968) using in part some Texas names:
from
oldest to youngest, Willis, Bentley, Montgomery, and Beaumont.
The
second (1982) edition of the Sheet dropped this four-fold classification and reverted to the usage of the old Geologic Map of Texas-from oldest to youngest:
Willis, Lissie, and Beaumont (Darton et. al.,
1937).
The areas of the Bentley and Montgomery of the 1968 Sheet
correspond fairly well to the Lissie of the 1982 Sheet (Table 1).
Among the reasons for reverting to the three-fold
classification ~re probably doubts about the Fiskian units as valid

mappable formations, and the large number of high sea-level stages
available for the deposition of regressive alluvial plain-deltaic
complexes.
Beard et al. (1982), using seismic stratigraphy, zoning
by microfossils, and climatic interpretation of oxygen-isotope
ratios of microfossils, have identified at least eight high sealevels stands (including the Holocene) sinqe the beginning of the
Pleistocene, which they placed at about 2.5 rna.
Van Siclen (1985)
has mapped at least five Pleistocene regressive depositional units
in the Houston area based on the sea-level fall-and-rise cycles
proposed by Beard et al. (1982).
Some of Van Siclen's units are
those used by Doering (1956) in an extensive revision of Fisk's
formations.
Recent investigations, using both morphologic and lithologic
criteria, have identified five Quaternary physiographic units in
Louisiana, which include the Pleistocene High Terraces, Intermediate
Terraces, Prairie Terraces, Deweyville Terrace, and the Holocene
coastal and alluvial plains (Snead and McCulloh, 1984) (Tables 1
and 2).
These units consist of multiple terraces with the exception
of the Deweyville Terrace and the Holocene coastal and alluvial
plains.
A new, major work (Sibrava et al., 1986) may render obsolete much
of the previous stratigraphic framework for the Pleistocene.
The
papers in this volume (see especially Richmond and Fullerton, 1986a;
1986b) are based on more than two decades of research on deep-sea
cores (determination of water temperatures by oxygen-isotope ratios
in microfossils), radiometric dating of widespread ash falls, the
areal distribution and stratigraphy of tills and related deposits,
and a detailed paleomagnetic chronology for the Pliocene and
Pleistocene.
Richmond and Fullerton (1986b) propose the abandonment
of the terms Nebraskan, Aftonian, Kansan, and Yarmouth in their type
areas and they suggest they be referred to as "pre-Illinoian."
They
note the occurrence of tills older than the type Nebraskan, and that
for the U.S. as a whole the "pre-Illinoian" includes at least seven
Pleistocene and at least three Pliocene glaciations.
They support
the now generally accepted Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary at about
1.65 Ma.
Illinoian and Wisconsin time may include at least five
glaciations.
For our field trip all this may mean (a) that
units, though they are valid as formations, may be
deposits of more than one high-sea level stand, or
the latest regressive deposits are identifiable as
formations, or (c) both.

Table 2.

Physiographic characteristics of the Louisiana Quaternary
surfaces (Saxton, 1986).

CHARACTERISTICS

SURFACE
High Terraces

Coincide closely with Williana and
portions of the Bentley terraces.
They
are dissected, less continuous and slopes
are greater than the lower terraces.
Surface elevations are usually in excess
of 170 feet.

Intermediate Terraces

Correspond to the Montgomery Terrace and
most of the Bentley Terrace.
They are
moderately dissected and are depicted as
having minor surface exposure.

Prairie Terraces

Three levels are recognized; two are found
along the alluvial valleys and one is found
intermittently toward the Gulf of Mexico.
Stream dissection, drainage development,
slope, and elevations are much less than on
the Intermediate and High terraces.

Deweyville Terrace

Represented by fluvial terraces only and
are fairly well preserved morphologically.
Topographically lower than the Prairie
Terraces.

Holocene coastal and
alluvial plain

Elevations range from zero to a few feet
above sea level and are topographically the
lowest portions of the Quaternary surfaces.
The coastwise plain merges with the
alluvial valleys of river systems.

STOP 1
HACKBERRY SALT DOME AND PIMPLE MOUNDS
Saul Aronow
Location
-------Hackberry Island is located 18 miles south of Sulphur on LA 27.
stop 1 will be made on the western side of the salt dome on LA 390
(Fig. 4).
Petroleum production from the Hackberry fields, the
uplifted Prairie Formation, and pimple mounds will be discussed.

Hackberry Island, an inlier of the Prairie Formation within the
Holocene marsh, has been raised by intrusions of salt and diapiric
shales and thus was not submerged by the post-18,000 year B.P.
transgression.
The structures so resulting are responsible for the
several oil fields in the Hackberry area.
A Strategic Petroleum
Reserve storage site is located in a dissolved portion of the salt
dome.
The inlier surface displays relict meander patterns of Red
River origin.
The Hackberry Oil Field complex includes the East Hackberry,
West Hackberry, Big Lake, Sweet Lake, Calcasieu Lake, and Chalkey
fields in Cameron Parish.
The West Hackberry Field was the first to be discovered.
Surface expression and gas seeps were noted in 1902, but it was
1928 before the Cameron Oil Company drilled the first producing
well, on the south side of the dome.
This well was completed in a
sand at 3152 feet.
It produced 100 barrels of oil a day.
Present
production is from Pliocene sands at 2950-80 feet, 11 zones in the
Miocene at 3095-5879 feet, the R~t~Â£QÂ§t~gi~~ zone at 6232-40 feet,
the M~Â£gi~~!i~~ sands at 6425-8390 feet, and the Q~m~Â£i~~ zone of
the Anahuac at 8630-9953 feet.
The West Hackberry Field lies on the western end of a long
ridge which extends six miles from the southeast end of Black Lake
eastward to the west bank of Calcasieu Lake.
The ridge is highest
at the western end, above the Hackberry dome.
In 1935 the elevation
was reported at 23.5 feet, but earlier reports indicate an elevation
of as much as 45 feet.
A small cliff is formed where the ridge is
truncated by Calcasieu Lake.
The ridge is composed of Pleistocene
deltaic material.
It is thought to reflect the presence of a large
salt ridge at depth.
Older formations dip away from the ridge at 55
degrees on the south flank, giving a narrower production zone than
on the north, where the dip is not as steep.
Below the Oligocene,

heaving shales, probably of Jackson age, have hampered drilling.
Formations above the salt are thick, compared with other fields on
the trend.
The East Hackberry Field was discovered by the Calcasieu Oil
Company from a seismographic anomaly.
No surface indications were
present.
The first well was drilled on November 7, 1927, and it
produced 800 barrels of oil a day from a Miocene sand at 3973 feet.
In 1930, oil was found in a zone above the cap, at a depth of 2707
feet.
Later production was also discovered in several other zones
in the Pliocene, Miocene, and upper Oligocene, with much oil coming
from the Q9~~riQ9 zone in the Anahuac.
The caprock is at a depth of
2695 feet and the salt at 3588 feet.
East and West Hackberry, along with the other fields in the complex,
are thought to be cupolas on the large salt ridge mentioned above.

Pimple mounds, two to six feet in height and up to 150 feet in
diameter, are found in Louisiana and elsewhere almost exclusively
west of the modern floodplain of the Mississippi River.
They
continue to occur in northeastern Texas and southwardÂ· along the
Texas Gulf Coast; northward they extend into southeastern Oklahoma,
Arkansas, and southern Mi~souri with isolated occurrences in northwestern Iowa and southwestern Minnesota.
They are found in parts of
New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and
California (Cox, 1984).
In areas other than Louisiana and contiguous
states they are known as mima or prairie mounds.
Theories for the origin of pimple mounds are many, and the
literature is vast and confusing.
Two recent studies by Goodarzi
(1978) and Carty (1980) which pertain, respectively, to Cameron and
Calcasieu Parishes, and to nearby Jefferson County in adjacent east
Texas, are of considerable interest and have recent bibliographies.
In flatter areas the pimple mounds are roughly circular in
ground plan; on some slopes, especially on older surfaces, the
mounds are elongated or joined by a high swale in a downslope
direction and thus parallel the local fine-scale drainage.
On the
western part of the Prairie surface in Calcasieu Parish the mounds
more efficiently obscure the relatively small relict meandering
stream channels and point bars of the paleo-Sabine deposits, whereas
the larger of such features formed by the paleo-Red seem to manifest
themselves regardless of the mounds.
An interesting question with no clear answer at present is
whether the mounds on the two different kinds of surfaces (in terms
of degree of preservation of relict depositional forms), the Prairie

15

and the older surfaces, respectively, were formed in the same
episode or in two or more different episodes.
An erosional theory for their origin is widely held by, among
others, Goodzari (1978).
According to this theory, intermound areas
would be eroded away by running water leaving the mounds
differentially high.
Pedogenesis would proceed during the erosion,
resulting in the differing soil profiles of the mound annd
intermound areas.
At the other end of the spectrum of inorganic
theories of origin are the eolian or accumulational approaches which
might involve small patches of vegetation holding together soil
material which otherwise might be subject to sheet erosion, thus
establishing slight topographic highs.
The vegetation would trap
windborne sand, silt, and pellets of clay as the mound increases in
height, mostly by this wind accretion but also partly by sheet flood
erosion around the base.
As in the erosional theory soil formation
would keep pace with the wind-deposited increments.
Such features,
called coppice mounds, are found in arid and semi-arid regions.
Carty's (1980) study, though inconclusive, provides some support for
this view.
Accumulational theories pre-suppose periods of drier
climates.
The major organic theory for mound origin invokes the fossorial
or burrowing activities of small mammals like pocket gophers (Cox,
1984; Cox and Gakahu, 1986).
The burrowing, under this theory,
"fluffs up" or increases the volume of soil material as well as
providing for the centripetal movement of soil material topward the
center of the mound; bulk density decreases.
Gravelly mounds and
the abrupt termination of mounds on the western side of the
Mississippi, as though limited by the distribution of an animal
group, are among the reasons for supporting this theory.
Gravelly
mounds cannot be eolian though coarse materials can be transported
upward by burrowing animals.
Cox and Gakahu (1986) analyzed the location and sorting of
gravelly mound components in Washington and California and concluded
that fossorial activities are the only valid explanation for the
origin of these mounds.
The erosional theory requires large-scale sheet flow to produce
an essentially finely dissected topography with a very high stream
density.
A key issue, among others, is whether the mounds formed
under a climate like the present or one of much higher rainfall,
like, for example, the one producing the Deweyville Terrace.
The
mound soil profiles are stable and "mature" and a different climate
may be needed.
An accumulational theory, likewise, seems to suggest
a climate dissimilar to the present, but towards the more arid.
The writer's own experience in excavating and describing the

16

interior of mounds in the Gulf Coast of Texas and Louisiana suggests
that much of the relief consists of a thickening of the A and E
horizons under the mounds.
The Band C horizons under the mounds
are in many places essentiailly flat or raised toward the center of
the features.
Some observers have noted a sagging of surface
horizons like the A and E, producing a kind of bi-convex lense of
coarser surface materials.
The A and E horizons are almost
invariably toward the sandy or loamy end of the compositional
continuum.
In areas where the mound and intermound areas are underlain by the same soils, the mounded portions display thicker A and E
horizons.
In areas where there are similar soils, the intermound
soils may show fewer or poorly differentiated horizons.
In the Gulf Coast region of Texas and Louisiana mounds are
mostly confined to Pleistocene surfaces, including the late
Pleistocene to early Holocene Deweyville surfaces.
An unusual mound
occurence is on the surface of the Brazos River delta (in Texas),
which has accumulated since the diversion of the Brazos to its
present course in 1929.
In areas of preserved fluvial depositional topography, the
mounds are usually found on the meander ridges.
On older
Pleistocene surfaces where the depositional topography has been
obliterated, the mounds have a more random distribution and are
usually not as well-defined.
The surface of the Ingleside Barrier
is almost everywhere moundy, and unless the sand is thin, the whole
solum is developed in sand.
The area of our pimple mound stop on Hackberry Island has been
mapped as complexes of either the Mowata-Vidrine silt loams or the
Crowley-Vidrine silt loams.
In both of these complexes, the soil of
the mound is the Vidrine Series.
A soil profile for the Vidrine
Series is presented in subsequent pages (courtesy of the U.S. Soil
Conservation Service which has just completed the soils mapping of
Cameron Parish).
The Mowata and Crowley series are found in the
intermound areas.
Profiles for these also are provided.
In the early 1960's the writer conducted an investigation of
pimple mounds in southwestern Louisiana and southeastern Texas.
Two
mounds, one in western Calcasieu Parish near Vinton and the other in
the Hackberry area of Cameron Parish, were excavated.
The cross
sections (Figs. 5 and 6) show the interior structure of the mounds.
The latest unpublished mapping of soils in both Cameron and Calcasieu
Parishes indicates that the mounds were the sites of the Vidrine
Series.
The profile designations on the cross sections have been
superseded, giving the profiles an archaic or vintage aspect.
The
soil profile, prepared many years ago for the Calcasieu mound, is
also presented.
It does not quite fit the Vidrine profile;
either
I erred or it is a variant!!

STOP 2
GULF OF MEXICO WEST OF HOLLY BEACH
Richard U. Birdseye

The effects of coastal erosion may be viewed along LA 82 some
3.5 miles west of Holly Beach (Fig. 7),
Coastal processes, local
sediments and landforms, and environmental/engineering
considerations will be discussed.

Louisiana's coast along Highway 82 between Holly Beach and
Peveto Beach is a wave-dominated transgressive shoreline undergoing
rapid retreat.
The road is continuously being undercut by waves and
is prone to frequent overwash.
Initial failure of the roadbed was
noted in 1978, and in the following ten years up to one-half of the
highway has been removed by erosion (Figs. 8 and 9).
Frequent
hurricanes, sediment deprivation, and blockage of longshore drift by
the mile-long Calcasieu Pass jetties at Cameron are responsible for
the deterioration of the road, which has been relocated inland
several times in the last 50 years.
Route 82 serves as an important
hurricane evacuation corridor, as well as the only direct highway
from coastal southwestern Louisiana to Texas.
Strandline erosion and reorientation have been occurring in
this area since it was first mapped in 1833 (Nummedal, 1982).
The
chenier ridges, so prominent to the east and west, have been
truncated.
Only a thin veneer of recent beach sand and shell hash
is evident.
Instead, shoreline transgression has exposed the
underlying mudflat and marsh deposits, and overwash debris may be
found in the marsh to the north.
Homes standing in the Gulf of
Mexico in the community of Peveto Beach to the west and pilings and
telephone poles in the surf to the east accompany the decaying
highway as victims of shoreline retreat (Fig. 10).
In the past few years, several groins and breakwaters have been
constructed near Peveto Beach and accretion is locally evident
because of them.
Spoil is being made available from Calcasieu Pass
to the east, providing sediment which may be carried westward into
the region by longshore currents.
A small dune ridge has recently
formed near Holly Beach, indicating a slow return to stability.
Low
property and home values in the area have curtailed any more
ambitious or costly stabilization programs up to the present time.

STOP 3
CAMERON TIDAL MUDFLAT
Richard U.

Birdseye

A regressive tidal mudflat shoreline, smaller than but
otherwise similar to the ancient chenier plain tidal mudflats, is
exhibited at this stop east of Calcasieu Pass in Cameron Parish
(Fig. 11, Sec. 21, T15S, R9W).

The Cameron Mudflats are comprised of sand, mud, shell debris,
and decaying grasses, all deposited in brackish water (see core
description in Table 3).
Armored mudballs are commonly found on
the surface of the flats; they are rip-up clasts resulting from wave
erosion of recent marsh deposits that have been flattened, smoothed,
and armored with shell fragments.
Marsh grasses extend from the
backshore seaward into the brackish intertidal zone.
Desiccation
cracks are evident on muddy surfaces at low tide, whereas
symmetrical ripples characterize the sandier materials.
Offshore
swash bars are indicated by lines of breakers and by shore birds
standing in the very shallow water.
Although the Cameron Mudflats
are basically a low energy setting, significant differences in water
levels and waves occur due to tides and to changes in wind velocity
and direction.
The bulk of the sediments accumulating on the prograding Cameron
Mudflats are derived from the Calcasieu and Mermentau rivers, as
well as from the reworking of older marsh and mudflat deposits.
Up
to nine feet of mudflat accretion was noted from 1812 to 1954 (Morgan
and Larimore, 1957).

OAK GROVE/FRONT RIDGE SAND PIT
Richard U. Birdseye

This pit, operated by Cameron Construction Company, is located
west of the community of Oak Grove on Cameron Parish Hwy. 357 (Fig.
12, Sec. 2, T15S, R8W).
The entrance to the site lies on the face
of the Oak Grove/Front Ridge system, and the pit occupies the distal
portion of the chenier.
Because of a sluggish economy and limited construction in the
Chenier Plain in recent years, the numerous sand pits located
between Oak Grove and Cameron have ceased dredging operations and
are presently supplying sand from stockpiles.
The pits have filled
with water which limits exposures.
If renewed dredging operations
are underway at the time of this trip (which the company is hoping
they will be), the pit will then provide a view of the bedding and
internal geometry of the chenier ridge, as well as a look at a
poorly developed soil profile at the top of the excavation.

The Louisiana Chenier Plain is a 120 mile by 12 mile section of
coast that extends from the Sabine River east to Vermilion Bay (Fig.
13a).
It has been of interest geologically since the term "chenier"
was introduced by Russell and Howe in 1935.
According to their
definition, a chenier is comprised of a linear deposit of sand
and/or shell material on which a sizeable oak tree (chene in French)
population exists.
The term "chenier plain" was coined by W. A.
Price (1955) to describe the Holocene sequence of coalescing or
alternating chenier ridges and marsh/mudflat deposits in
southwestern Louisiana (Fig. 13b).
The original model for chenier development is based largely on
work by Russell (1940), Fisk (1944, 1948), Price (1955), Byrne et
al. (1959), and Gould and McFarlan (1959).
Alternating changes in
Mississipi river flow in the last 3,000 years is generally cited as
being responsible for the repetitive development of chenier ridges
and mudflat sequences.
When the Mississippi River introduced
sediment in the present chenier plain region, the shoreline
prograded seaward because of mudflat growth; during times when
sediment influx to the area was low, wave attack would inhibit the
shoreline adance and rework the mudflat sediments.
Sand and shell
debris were thus concentrated to form a chenier prior to renewed

This model has been named the
"flip flop" model (Kaczorowski and Gernat, 1980).
Spacing between cheniers is variable, as are the dimensions of
the individual ridges.
The cheniers rise from less than one foot to
more than ten feet above surrounding marshes; most have an average
elevation of six feet.
The lengthy Oak Grove-Grand Chenier-Pecan
Island trend stretches for more than 50 miles across southwestern
Louisiana, making it the longest of the chenier systems.

Front Ridge is located within a broad fan of very young chenier
ridges, less than 600 years old, that form the western tip of the
1100 year old Oak Grove ridge (Gould and McFarlan, 1959).
Figure
13b shows a N-S section across the chenier plain approximately four
miles east of stop 4.
The most prominent ridge is the Oak Grove
chenier that forms the stable substrate for LA 82.
Each chenier was
built on shallow, foreshore Gulf-bottom sediments that ranged from
sand to silty clay,
Although a variety of structures and environments can be
observed at Stop 4, the most notable are the interbedded sands and
silts that have been altered by overwash processes.
During storms,
normal beach processes are interrupted by high tides and large waves
that deposit the coarser sediments inland as washover fans.
These
deposits can be recognized by abrupt changes in lithology and by
steeply inclined beds that dip northward.
The fact that the
coarsest sediments in the cheniers (except for the shell) are fine
sands reflects the nature of the sediment available for transport
rather than an inability of winter storms and hurricanes to
transport coarser particles.
The shell layers, typically a few inches thick, consist largely
of clam and oyster fragments.
The layers of silt and the thin claly
drapes are a result of rapidly changing conditions; a continuous
supply of muds from the east, even though diminished during periods
of chenier building, provides an opportunity for incorporation of
fine-grained sediments in the cheniers.
Kaczorowski and Gernat
(1980) have shown that layers of sand and shell account for
approximately 75 percent (by volume) of a 18 foot vertical section
with the remaining 25 percent being clay and mixed-clay units.
The
upper three feet of section consists of fine eolian sands and dark,
rooted soils from colonization by marsh grasses.

STOP 5
LITTLE CHENIER RIDGE
Richard U.

Birdseye

Little Chenier ridge is located in northeastern Cameron Parish.
The shell pit to be examined at this stop is located approximately
11 miles east of LA 27 on a parish road (Fig. 15).
Landscape
development, sedimentary sequences, and a Tchefuncte Indian mound
are aspects of this site.

Of all of the cheniers in southwestern Louisiana, Little
Chenier is unique.
It has been dated at 2800 years B.P., making it
the oldest of the ridges.
Additionally, shell hash is more abundant
at Little Chenier than at other localities, implying that storm
activity was partly responsible for its formation.
Little Chenier ridge is over 12 miles long and varies in
width from 1~0 to 1600 feet; the average elevation is 3-4 feet,
but elevations of 8-9 feet are found locally (Kaczorowski, 1978).
The ridge is bordered on the north and south by vast expanses of
marshes and mudflats.
Further to the south lies a complex of
cheniers ranging in age from 2200-2500 years.

Shell hash, sand, and clay are the dominant materials
comprising Little Chenier ridge (Table 4).
The high percentage of
coarse material is suggestive of deposition on a storm beach.
Numerous borrow pits along ~he ridge indicate the lateral continuity
of the storm debris.
Extensive marsh and mudflat sequences overlying the Pleistocene
Prairie Formation lie north of Little Chenier.
The fine-grained
sediments and the absence of chenier ridges to the north are likely
due to eustatic instability during early and middle Holocene time.

A Tchefuncte Indian mound is located between the borrow pits at
stop 5.
It is a prominent topographic high, reaching an elevation

C. W.

COOKE'S SHORELINE-LIKE FEATURE
Saul Aronow

Stop 6 is located approximately 20 miles south of Lake Charles
on LA 384 along the eastern shore of Calcasieu Lake (Fig. 16),

This shoreline-like feature was first mentioned by C. Wythe
Cooke in 1966 (p. 37) in a rather obscure (from a geologic point of
view) publication.
In the field trip stop area it is an east-west
trending ridge about 0.3 to 0.5 miles wide and about 8 to 10 feet
high (Fig. 16).
This east-west trending part is about 10 miles in
length and terminates to the west on the east shore of Calcasieu
Lake.
To the east it increases in width to almost a mile, swings to
the north, and disappears into the general trend of meander-ridge
patterns associated with the relict Red River depositional
topography on the Prairie surface south and southeast of Lake
Charles (see Lake Charles and Sulphur 15-minute quadrangles or Moss
Lake, Lake Charles SW, Lake Charles SE, and Iowa 7 1/2-minute
quandrangles).
Cooke identified the southern east-west trending part as a
portion of his six-foot Pleistocene Silver Bluff (marine) Terrace
which he traced from the southern Atlantic Coastal Plain across the
Mississippi embayment into southern Louisiana.
Bernard and LeBlanc (1965) in their Figure 5 showing the geomorphic
features of southwest Louisiana and southeast Texas (see last page
of this guidebook) do not show this feature but show other
shoreline-like ridges in western Calcasieu Parish which trend
generally parallel to the southeast-northwest pattern of relict
depositional features of the Pleistocene paleo-Sabine River on the
Prairie surface.
They depict similar ridges in southeast Texas
(Jefferson County).
The Texas features are probably distributary
ridges of small paleo-Trinity River deltas on the surface of the
Beaumont Formation (Louisiana equivalent = Prairie Formation).
The
Calcasieu River-related ridges in Calcasieu Parish have no terminal
deltaic position but are anomalous short ridges with no systematic
relationship to the nearby relict meander patterns.
Road cuts and
shallow auger holes disclose no sandy sediments which might be
interpreted as beach deposits.
The features these last most
resemble are the older Pre-Holocene eolian clay dunes on the
Pleistocene surFaces in south Texas, in the vicinity of Corpus

Christi and farther south in Texas.
This may be analagous to
ascribing the Carolina Bays to permafrost processes!!!
While
Cooke's feature might be a delta distributary, the fate of the
remainder of the presumed delta is obscure.
These shoreline-like features await the drilling of some test
holes (25 to 50 feet) to determine the presence or absence of
fluvial deltaic sands.
The recently completed SCS soils mapping in Calcasieu and
Cameron Parishes show all the ridge areas to be mainly topped by the
Crowley-Vidrine complex silt loams whose substrates are largely
silty clays, silty clay loams, and clay loams, none of which qualify
as beach or barrier island deposits.

STOP 7
INTERMEDIATE TERRACES AT LONGVILLE
Richard U.

Birdseye

The geomorphology and stratigraphy of the Pleistocene
Intermediate Terraces of southwestern Louisiana may be observed at
this site in an abandoned sand pit located three miles east of
Longville and US 171 in Beauregard Parish (Fig. 17, Sec. 21, T5S,
R8W).
Fluvial sequences, soil development, gullying, badland
evolution, and an overview of the Pleistocene terraces are features
of this stop.

The Intermediate Terraces are indicated on the Geologic Map of
Louisiana (Snead and McCulloh, 1984) as those surfaces formerly
depicted as Montgomery, Irene, and the majority of the Bentley.
They are further described as consisting of "light gray to orangebrown clay, sandy clay, and silt; much sand and gravel locally."
Exposures of the Intermediate Terraces are more extensive in
southwestern Louisiana than anywhere else in the state.
These
surfaces are widest between the Calcasieu and Sabine rivers, where
they may extend for more than 30 miles in a north-south direction.
Topographically, the Intermediate Terraces lie between the Prairie
and the High terraces, and are found from elevations in excess of
210 feet to as little as 35 feet.
The Intermediate surfaces are
moderately dissected, and slopes of 3-8 feet per mile are typical.
Soil development is moderate, although fertility is generally low
due to the high sand and gravel content of the parent material.
Evergreens cover much of the region.
Advanced soil erosion (man-generated) is producing badlands in
the youthful sediments at Stop 7.
The gullies and topography may be
attributed to a combination of poorly consolidated materials, steep
slopes, a lack of vegetation, and abundant precipitation (average 55
inches per year).
The age of the Intermediate Terraces has been inferred from
eustatic curves for the Gulf of Mexico, and a wide range of
approximations appears in the literature.
Varius Pleistocene
intervals including the Sangamonian (Fisk and McFarlan, 1955; Alford
and Holmes, 1985), Yarmouthian (Saucier, 1974), or pre-Sangamonian
(Otvos, 1982) have been suggested.

The stratigraphy displayed at the site supports the widely
acepted fluvial origin of the Intermediate Terraces in southwestern
Louisiana.
Clean sands, muddy sands, and muds comprise the outcrop.
Sorting varies among the individual units comprising the exposure.
Three distinct channel sequencews with associated point bar and
overbank deposits comprise the bulk of the sediments at the pit
(Fig. 18).
The lowermost unit is comprised of tan muddy point bar
sands.
Low angle cross beds are apparent locally.
The anomalous
clay content is likely associated with diagenesis and the chemical
decomposition of the constituent ferromagnesian minerals.
Overlyling the basal point bar deposits is 4.5 to 6 feet of
mud, with a conspicuous erosional unconformity separating the two
units.
The mud is red and gray; mottles and root traces are
abundant.
A well-defined clay plug is present at the northern end
of the outcrop.
Overbank and oxbow lake environments were the
likely depositional settlings for these muds.
Cut into the muds in the northern portion of the exposure is a
third channel sequence, whose fill consists of up to 3 feet of light
gray, medium-to-fine grained sand.
the deposit is clean and wellsorted, and thins to the north and south.
The uppermost unit consists of approximately four feet of sand,
silt, and clay.
A brown-to-gray A soil horizon is confined to the
upper 6 inches of this unit, which is underlain by a well-developed,
red-to-tan B hoirizon.
The B horizon is developed in point bar
sediments at the northern end of the outcrop which grade into
apparently overbank materials to the south.
The A horizon, and
possiblly the very upper portion of the B, have likely formed in
eolian deposits of local origin.
Beneath the 25 feet of exposed section described above lies a
considerable quantity of sand and gravel, as revealed by cores taken
at Stop 7.
An additional 40 feet of sand and mud was found directly
beneath the surface.
Below this lies sand and gravel, which was
initially encountered about 65 feet below the surface and continued
down to the base of the core at 100 feet below ground level.
Neither of the subsurface units is known to outcrop in the vicinity
of Longville.
The stockpiled sand and gravel across the road from
Stop 7 was not obtained from the pit at this site; it was dredged
from a General Portland Corp. pit loated five miles to the northeast
on the Intermediate Terraces.
Surface and subsurface date at Stop 7 indicate that the
materials forming the treads of the Intermediate Terraces were

STOP 8
POSSIBLE FAULTING SOUTH OF DEQUINCY
Richard U. Birdseye and Saul Aronow
Location
------Stop 8 is located approximately two miles south of DeQuincy on
LA 27 (Fig. 19).
An additional stop (8A) may be made another six
miles south of Stop 8 on the same highway (Fig. 19).

The most prominent Pleistocene scarp in the DeQuincy area with
over 20 feet of relief (Fig. 19) is located about two miles south of
the intersection of LA 12 and LA 27.
This scarp occurs within
Fisk's (1948) Montgomery Terrace, which was mapped by Snead
and McCulloh (1984) as the Intermediate Terraces.
Fisk did not
comment on this scarp in his 1948 report.
More recent investigation of this scarp indicates the
possibility of faulting for its origin.
If it is not of tectonic
origin, then it must represent the edge of an extra terrace surface
that certainly does not conform to Fisk's (1948) four-fold
classification of the Pleistocene terraces.
Time permitting, we will look at Fisk's scarp which separates
the Prairie Terraces from the Intermediate (Montgomery).
This stop
(8A) is located another six miles south on LA 27.
Here the scarp is
fairly representative of most of the bounding scarps in its 10-15
feet of relief.
It is definitely less well defined than the scarp to
the north (Fig. 19).

STOP 9
HOUSTON BARRIER SEGMENT OF THE INGELSIDE STRANDPLAIN
Richard U.

Birdseye

The only exposure of the Ingleside barrier island strandplain
in Louisiana is located in western Calcasieu Parish in the vicinity
of the junction of the Houston River with the main stem of the
Calcasieu River.
The Houston Barrier segment will be viewed west of
LA 27 in a former sand pit (Fig. 20, Sec. 4, T9S, RIOW).
Aronow, in
a later section of this guidebook, will comment further on the
Ingleside system in Texas.

Ingleside strandplain sands comprise numerous segments of an
ancient shoreline stretching from the South Texas Sand Sheet
northeastward into Calcasieu Parish.
Correlative units, referred to
by Otvos (1975, 1985) as the "Gulfport" ridge system, have been
identified along the Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida coasts (Fig.
21; Table 5).
In Louisiana, the Houston Barrier forms a linear ridge
extending for approximately 17 miles from the edge of the Sabine /
River plain eastward to the Calcasieu River.
Maximum elevations of
the entire Ingleside Strandplain are found here (Table 5).
Elevations along the Houston ridge range from 25 feet to 36 feet.
The surrounding Prairie Terrace exhibit an average elevation of 20
feet, which results in local relief between the Houston Barrier and
the adjacent Prairie surface of up to 16 feet.
The Houston Barrier is a sand body which formed as a result of
both marine and eolian processes.
The sediments for the barrier
were supplied largely by the Sabine, Red, and Mississippi rivers and
were deposited as a barrier island with an extensive laioon existing
to the north.
Still evident are remnants of tidal inlets, tidal
deltas, spits, and washover fans associated with the system.
The
Houston sands are surrounded and partly overlain by fluvial and
deltaic deposits of the Pleistocene Prairie Formation (Barrilleaux,
1986) .

Houston Ba~rier sediments are considered to be a sandy facies
of the Prairie Formation.
They consist mainly of tan to gray, finegrained and ver~ fine-grained, moderately to well-sorted sand

At the eastern end of the Houston ridge a slight fining of the
sediment occurs and the materials become better sorted and more
rounded.
The iron content also increases in an easterly direction
and is evidenced by the color of the sands.
A plausiblle
explanation for this is the contribution of sediment by the Red
River during the Pleistocene (Barrilleaux, 1986),
The thickness of the Houston sand body is difficult to
ascertain.
Graf (1966) reported a sand thickness in excess of 35
feet; however, auger and bore holes could only attain depths of 15
feet and elrded in sand.
The downd.ip 1 imi t of the barrier is
likewise uncertain but it appears to thin seaward (Morton and
Nummedal, 1982).
Soils
----The Houston sands are associated with the Bienville-CahabaGuyton soil association.
The termination of these soilÂ· survey
units correspond to the terminus of the sand ridge near Sam
Houston state Park (Barrilleaux, 1986).
In some areas the barrier
is covered with the Kinder-Messer, the Messer-Guyton, the Guy tonMesser, and the Brimstone soils which are associated with the
Prairie Terraces.
Many of the soils on the Houston Barrier are also
found on the Deweyville Terraces of the -Sabine River, suggesting
that under eolian influen~es similar parent materials, regardless of
origin, may develop similar soils (Aronow, 1985).

Particle size analysis, sedimentologic characteristics, and
microfossil evidence acquired' from samples taken in the vicinity of
the Houston Barrier led Barrilleaux (1986) to conclude that this
sand body was deposited as a ~arrier island during a Late
Pleistocene eustatic high.
It may have been similar to the present
day barriers of the Texas coast.
The age of the Houston as well as -its placement in the
Pleistocene stratigraphic column is controversial; the same may be
said of the entire" Ingelside system.
Because the Houston is near
the most inland p6rtions of the Prairie Terraces, it may be
Sangamonian or older (Aronow, 1978).
Barrilleaux (1986) and Bergman
and Birdseye '( 1986) suggested a Peorian age.
ttDead" dates of more
than 40,200 years B. P~ were otained on Houston sediments by Aronow
(1965) and Barrilleaux (1985~ personal comm.).
Similar dates in
excess Â·of 35,000 years B.P. and 36,000 years B.P. (both ftdead tt ) were
mentioned by Otvos (1985).
Tn c~ntrast, a radiocarbon date of
29,260 Â±630 years B. P. was obtained on a microcoquina bed at a

56

depth of 33 feet below the base of the Ingelside sand body at the
type section near Corpus Christi. Texas (Shideler, 1981).
If this
date is valid, an age as recent as Farmadalian is indicated for the
Ingleside sands.
