INTRODUCTION
The four sites discussed here are on private property on the east side of
the Navasota River in western Madison County (Figure 1). They are significant
in that they represent the only sites in the county where a large collection of
artifacts has been made available for study. Most of the 41 known prehistoric
sites in Madison County were identified and recorded by archaeologists during a
cultural resources survey that did not progress beyond the Phase I survey stage.
As a result, artifact collections from these sites were made in a short period of
time and were small. The landowners have collected artifacts from the four sites
discussed here for at least 15 years, and this has resulted in a sample that is
worthy of documenting. The discussion of artifact types is based on my
experience with specimens in the area and assistance from other professional
archaeologists. These sites are depicted on the USGS 7.5’ topographic
quadrangles Canary and Clear Lake (Figure 2).

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Madison County encompasses 480 square miles of land and ranks
number 238 among the 254 Texas counties in terms of its size (Moore 1983:28).
The county is drained by the Navasota River that forms its western boundary, the
Trinity River that forms its eastern boundary, and several creeks in the rest of the
county. Madison County shares a common border with Leon County on the
north, Houston County on the north and east, Walker and Grimes counties on the
south, Brazos County on the south and west, and Robertson County on the
northwest.
When the Department of Antiquities Protection, Texas Historical
Commission published a planning document entitled Archeology in the Eastern
Planning Region, Texas: A Planning Document (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993),
Madison County was included in the Prairie Savanna Archeological Study Region
of the Eastern Planning Region (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.1.2)
(Figure 3). This area shares a common border with the Northeast Texas and
Southeast Texas study regions. It is, therefore, logical to assume that shared
cultural traits exist between Madison County and the adjacent regions.
Madison County is poorly represented in the archaeological record in
terms of numbers of site recorded. According to the TARL site records, there
are 44 documented sites in Madison County (Table 1). Forty sites are prehistoric
or have prehistoric components mixed with historic materials (Table 2), and eight
sites are historic or have a historic component mixed with a prehistoric
component (Table 3). In 1997, Madison County contained 0.001 - 0.1 sites per
square mile and was one of the counties with the lowest density of recorded sites
in Texas (Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993:11). The reason for the small number of
recorded sites in the county is related to the size of the county and lack of largescale development in the area. The majority of known sites in Madison County
(n=31) were recorded during the three largest investigations: Millican Reservoir,
Arbuckle Pipeline, and the Navidad Resources Pipeline project. According to the
Abstracts in Texas Contract Archeology series compiled by William E. Moore and
William A. Martin from 1987 to 1992, the only archaeological study during this
time was the reconnaissance of archaeological and historical resources in the
Navasota River Basin by Sorrow and Cox in 1973. Sites were recorded in 1960
(n=1), 1972 (n=1), 1974 (n=1), 1982 (n=17), 1989 (n=2), 1998 (n=1), 2000 (n=1),
2005 (n=4), 2008 (n=7), and 2011 (n=8). The date that site 41MA1 was recorded
is not known, but it probably was 1960 or earlier.

CHRONOLOGY
Paleoindian Stage
It is generally accepted that the Paleoindian Stage in this part of Texas
dates to sometime between 11,500 years Before Present (B.P.) and 8000 B.P.
(Bousman et al. 2004). Ensor et al. (1991:8-10) discuss the most common
Paleoindian projectile point types found in inland Southeast Texas. According to
their research, these are Angostura, Clovis, Folsom, Golondrina, and Plainview.
The San Patrice point is viewed by some archaeologists as a transitional type
between the Paleoindian and Archaic stages. The only evidence of this time
period in Madison County consists of three Angostura point fragments and a
Pelican point found at site 41MA27. These specimens are described and
illustrated in Appendix I. Most Paleoindian points were made from high-grade
lithic material not found in Southeast Texas, and Ricklis (2004:184) believes that
this is an indication of a widespread movement of people and materials. Few
sites attributed to the period have been documented. In adjacent Montgomery
County, the Scott’s Ridge site (41MAQ41) is an example of a camp that dates to
the Late Paleoindian or Early Archaic stages based on the presence of a San
Patrice point and other stemmed biface forms not present in later sites plus an
absence of ceramics (Shafer and Stearns 1975:37). This project successfully
tested the hypothesis that prehistoric sites having considerable antiquity do occur
on older landforms in the area. Bousman et al. (2004) compiled a very
comprehensive discussion of Paleoindian archaeology in Texas, and this is one
of the most current sources of information on this period of Texas prehistory.
Archaic Stage
The Archaic Stage in inland Southeast Texas dates from circa 8000 years
Before Present (B.P.) to 1500 B.P. (Ricklis 2004:184). During this period, there
was an increase in the number of projectile point types that were mainly
fashioned from local materials such as low-grade chert, quartzite, jasper, opal,
and silicified wood. Story et al. (1990) believes that the use of local materials
suggests a decrease in mobility and more tightly defined group territories. Ensor
et al. (1991:8-10) discusses the most common Archaic projectile point types
found in inland Southeast Texas sites. According to their research, these are
Early Side Notched and Early Corner Notched (Early Archaic); Carrollton,
Palmillas, Trinity, and Yarbrough (Middle Archaic); and Gary/Kent (Late Archaic).
In addition to the projectile points, scrapers, adzes, knives, and other tools are
present. It should be stated here that not all artifacts that appear to be projectile
points were used solely for that purpose. Microscopic analysis has revealed
wear patterns on some specimens that indicate they may have been used as
knives, perhaps while hafted. Archaic sites are typically found on sandy hills and
terraces in close proximity to dependable sources of water.

9

Faunal and macro-botanical materials are rare at inland Archaic sites, and
Ricklis (2004:185) believes this “precludes the drawing of inferences about
adaptive patterns beyond the assumption of some mix of hunting-and-gathering
subsistence practices.” Artifacts that date to this period have been reported at
seven sites in Madison County (41MA2, 41MA4, 41MA8, 41MA27, 41MA28,
41MA29, and 41MA30). Archaic specimens from the current study area are
described and illustrated in Appendix I.
Late Prehistoric Stage
The Late Prehistoric Stage in inland Southeast Texas dates from circa
A.D. 700 to A.D. 1500 with the introduction of the bow and arrow and ceramics
and lasted until the Historic Stage that could be as late as A.D. 1700. Ensor et
al. (1991:8-10) discusses the most common arrow point types found in inland
Southeast Texas sites. According to their research, these are Alba, Bonham,
Catahoula, Cliffton, Friley, Perdiz, and Scallorn. In addition to the projectile
points, scrapers, adzes, knives, and other tools are present. Sandy hills and
terraces were still the areas selected for camps. The increase in the number of
sites during this period suggests a population increase. The most common arrow
points are Alba, Bonham, Catahoula, and Perdiz. Sandy hills and terraces were
still the areas selected for camps. Sites in Madison County that date to this
period are 41MA2, 41MA3, 41MA4, 41MA5, 41MA10, 41MA27, 41MA28,
41MA29, 41MA30, and 41MA36. Late Prehistoric specimens from the current
study area are described and illustrated in Appendix I.
Historic Indians
There are no known sites in Madison County that can be identified as
historic Indian. The Akokisa and Bidais lived in the general area during the early
1800s, but there were no large bands of historic Indians living in present-day
Madison County and the surrounding area by 1830 (Aten 1983:Figure 3.2).
Remnants of these groups remained in the region, and this is documented in a
diary by Becky Lee who stated that there was a small camp of Bidais and
Akokisa near her place in northwestern Harris County who were there until at
least 1918, well into the 20th century. They were living in hide tents on the same
kinds of floodplain mounds where sites were later found during a survey by
Moore Archeological Consulting on Cypress Creek (Moore 1992:44). They still
spoke their native language that is assumed to be Atakapan. The reminiscences
of Ms. Lee are presented in Moore’s report as Appendix II.

10

According to Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993:44), sites attributed to the
historic Caddo are present in the region, but not one such site has been
documented in Madison County. One probable Caddo sherd was found at site
41MA29 in the current study area. Caddo sherds and a four-beveled knife were
found at site 41BZ102 in adjacent Brazos County, and artifacts associated with
this group have been found throughout the region. The nearest major Caddo
village is the George C. Davis site (41CE19) in Cherokee County.
Historic Sites
Historic sites are numerous and can be found virtually anywhere on the
landscape since they are not always linked to a water source. In rural Madison
County, historic sites consist of farmsteads and their associated outbuildings and
features, cemeteries, and bridges. A log crib (41MA23) was recorded on the
farm where sites 41MA27 – 41MA30 are located. Terry G. Jordan’s (1982) book
on Texas log buildings has a chapter on rural log outbuildings that discusses log
cribs. In urban areas, there are numerous structures (residential and
commercial) that are greater then fifty years of age and some are potentially
eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. Since the focus of
this article is the four prehistoric sites, an in-depth discussion of the Historic
period and the sites that it has spawned will not be presented.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
The only information for 41MA1 is on the site card at TARL. It is
described as a large campsite and cemetery with mounds on a tributary of
Bedias Creek. The recorder is believed to be M. M. Reynolds, but the date it was
recorded as at site is not stated. Black-and-white negatives are on file at TARL in
the Madison County miscellaneous files. It is not known if artifacts were collected
and where they are housed.
Edward B. Jelks and Lathel F. Duffield recorded 41MA2 based on artifacts
exposed in a road cut on State Highway 21 near the town of Midway in 1960.
Artifacts observed and collected are described as arrow points, dart points,
worked flint, majolica sherds, and a lead ball. The only information available is
the site card at TARL. The artifacts are curated at TARL.
William M. Sorrow recorded 41MA3 in 1972 during a survey for the Trinity
River Canalization project in 1972. According to the site form, 41MA3 is in the
northwest corner of the county on a terrace adjacent to Youngs Creek. The only
artifacts observed were a large prehistoric ceramic sherd and a biface made of
silicified wood. These artifacts are curated at TARL.
In 1973, archaeologists employed by the Texas Archeological Survey
(Sorrow and Cox 1973) conducted a preliminary archeological reconnaissance of
the Navasota River Basin, the area to be affected by the proposed Millican Lake
on the Navasota River. Most of the area investigated is in Brazos and Grimes
counties, but a small portion lies in Madison County. This project was conducted
for the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Little Rock District under contract
DACW 03-73-C-0086. A large portion of the project area was not examined due
to standing water and impassable roads. The method used to locate sites was a
surface inspection that concentrated on areas of exposed dirt associated with
rodent burrows. The authors (Sorrow and Cox 1973:3) admit that their study
“simply provides the foundation for future investigations which, it is hoped, will
not only seek to locate new sites but to evaluate by means of selective
subsurface testing.” Prior to the 1973 field season, only twelve sites were known
within the Navasota River Basin. No previously recorded sites were known to
exist in the Madison County portion of the proposed reservoir, and no new sites
were found in that area.
Harry J. Shafer recorded 41MA4 in 1974 as a prehistoric site on private
property on Curey Creek about two miles south of Madisonville. Artifacts
observed or collected are listed on the site form as Gary and Kent dart points; an
arrow point; Caddoan-like pottery; lithic debris of flint, quartzite, and silicified
wood; deer bone; and human bone fragments. Shafer describes this site as an
occupation area and burial site that was badly disturbed due to the removal of
sand for commercial purposes.

12

The next investigation in the county that resulted in the documentation of
new sites was the Millican Reservoir project in the Navasota River Basin in
Brazos, Grimes, Leon, Madison, and Robertson counties (Kotter 1982). This
investigation was conducted by archaeologists from the contract firm Prewitt &
Associates, Inc. in 1981 for the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort
Worth District under contract DACW63-81-C-0141. Although Kotter (1982:7)
admits that “Surface examination has demonstrated the need for selective
testing,” the project area was examined by a surface inspection without shovel
tests or probes. This project recorded 122 new sites that represent 109
prehistoric and 22 historic components. In Madison County, 16 sites (41MA5 –
41MA20) were recorded. The prehistoric sites consist of seven lithic scatters and
five isolated finds. Only three of the prehistoric sites yielded diagnostic artifacts.
An arrow point (type not stated) was found at 41MA5, and unidentified dart points
believed to date to the Late Archaic were found at sites 41MA8 and 41MA10.
The four historic sites consist of a possible bridge made of brick, five on the
banks of the Navasota River at a place known as Bundy’s Crossing, a trash
scatter found at the location of a habitation site, and two L-shaped structures
connected by porches that may date to the 19th century. The artifacts for sites
41MA5, 41MA8, 41MA9, and 41MA10 are curated at TARL.
Site 41MA21 was recorded in 1982 by archaeologists from Espey Huston
& Associates, Inc. (Rathbun 1982) during a survey for a proposed transmission
line. This job was performed for the Brazos Electric, and the Federal agency was
REA. This site is located on a high sandy knoll near Kickapoo Creek. It was
recorded as a prehistoric site based on five flakes found in a shovel test. One
flake was observed on an adjacent knoll, and the recorders believe this landform
may be an extension of site 41MA21.
It was seven years before another site was recorded in Madison County.
In 1989, William E. Moore observed flakes and ceramic sherds in eroded areas
within the right-of-way of State Highway 21 on the east bank of the Navasota
River, and it seems probable that the site probably includes the landform on the
opposite side of the highway. This area was recorded at TARL as 41MA22.
When Moore visited the landowner he observed a double pen log crib in very
good condition that was constructed about 75 years ago. This structure was
recorded at TARL as 41MA23. It was later demolished by the current
landowners.
There is no site form for 41MA24. According to Jonathan Jarvis at TARL,
this number was apparently overlooked when the next site was recorded.

13

In 1998, archaeologists from Antiquities Planning & Consulting (Godwin et
al. 1998) conducted an archaeological survey of three five-acre borrow pit sites
on the Ellis, Ferguson, and Wynne units of the Texas Department of Criminal
Justice in Madison and Walker counties. Prehistoric site 41MA25 was recorded
as a possible campsite in an upland setting. Artifacts observed consist of
debitage made from jasper, chert, and silicified wood; unmodified flakes, one
possible pebble tool, fire-cracked rock, and small mammal bone fragments that
had been exposed to fire. This site was determined to not have significant
research potential.
William E. Moore (2000) conducted an archaeological survey along State
Highway 21 for the Texas Department of Transportation from North Zulch to
Madisonville in 2000. One prehistoric camp (41MA26) was recorded on a sandy
terrace overlooking the floodplain of Iron Creek. No features were observed and
the only artifacts recovered were chert flakes. That portion of the site within the
highway right-of-way was not considered to be significant and no further work
was recommended. The artifacts are curated at TARL.
In 2005, William E. Moore visited a farm adjacent to the Navasota River
and recorded four prehistoric sites (41MA27 – 41MA30). These sites are on
private land and the landowner allowed two specialists to analyze the lithics and
ceramics (see discussion of these sites below). Three sites are located on sandy
hills near the river. At site 41MA27, 136 projectile points and about 20 pieces of
prehistoric pottery had been collected along with numerous flakes and
miscellaneous bifaces. Projectile points, and a large number of flakes were
found at 41MA28. These artifacts were found on the bank of the river and it is
suspected that they washed down from a sand hill nearby. Seventeen pieces of
pottery and five projectile points were found at 41MA29 and 19 pieces of pottery,
seven projectile points, and a few bifaces were found at site 41MA30.
Occupation of this area may have begun during the Paleoindian period based on
the presence of a few early projectile points and the sites were definitely
occupied during the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods. Some of the sherds
have been identified as Caddo or Caddo-like.
In 2008, Archeological & Environmental Consultants, LLC conducted an
archaeological survey for the Arbuckle Pipeline project. Seven prehistoric sites
(41MA31 – 41MA37) were recorded (Perttula and Nelson 2008). At six sites the
only cultural evidence consisted of lithic debris and these sites were classified as
unknown prehistoric and considered to be not significant. Site 41MA36 yielded
ceramics, a Perdiz arrow point, lithic debris, a piece of daub, and charred
material. This area is believed to be a prehistoric camp with research potential,
and it was recommended that the site be avoided.

The last project to record sites in Madison County was a survey for the
Navidad Resources Pipeline project in 2011 by Archeological & Environmental
Consultants, LLC (Perttula and Nelson 2011). This study located and recorded
six prehistoric sites (41MA38, 41MA39, 41MA42, 41MA43, 41MA44, and
41MA45) and two multi-component sites with prehistoric and historic artifacts
(41MA40 and 41MA41). The majority of the prehistoric sites (n=6) were identified
on the basis of lithic debitage and are best described as unknown prehistoric.
Diagnostic artifacts were found at two sites and identified as Yarbrough
(41MA42) and a possible Palmillas (41MA44), and their presence suggests an
Archaic occupation. The historic components consist of trash scatters that date
to the early 20th century and are probably the remains of habitation sites. The
artifacts collected during this project are curated at TARL.

SITE DISCUSSIONS
41MA27
This prehistoric campsite is situated on a sand hill on the east bank of the
Navasota River at an elevation of 230 feet above mean sea level in western
Madison County. It is depicted on the United States Geological Survey 7.5’
Canary and Clear Lake topographic quadrangles. The site was first discovered
when the current landowners removed sand from the hill in order to obtain sand
for fill during barn construction. The site occupies a landform that is
approximately 6.5 acres in size. It is estimated that 5% of this area has been
disturbed due to past and current quarrying of sand for the barn, a road and other
projects. Cultural features observed include burned rock and charcoal at three
locations in the cut bank profile created when barn foundation was constructed.
These features were observed to a depth of about 1.2 meters. Other forms of
disturbance are erosion and wallows by feral hogs. Although no controlled
excavation has been conducted, the profile created by road construction depicts
a depth of sandy soil over clay to a depth of 3.75 meters (Figure 4).
This is a very rich site in terms of artifacts that date from the Paleoindian
to the Late Prehistoric periods of Texas prehistory. Artifacts available for study
include numerous dart points, arrow points, arrow point preforms, a possible
gouge or adze; drills; one unifacial end scraper; one probable graver; one
eccentric; bifaces and biface fragments, and numerous flakes and other forms of
debitage. The lithic artifacts from this site are described and illustrated in
Appendix I. The ceramics from this site consists of one decorated rim sherd,
sixteen plain body sherds and three base sherds. Most of the sherds (90%) have
a sandy paste that ranges from fine to coarse, and the few sherds that are
tempered have either bone (n=2) or grog (n=3). The sherds are from vessels
that are fairly thick, and this suggests that they represent the remains of jars
(Perttula 2012).
The combination of a deeply stratified site with features that may contain
datable materials and a large number of diagnostic artifacts suggests that site
41MA27 may be eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.

41MA28
This site is situated on the south bank of the Navasota River at an
elevation of 230 feet above mean sea level in eastern Madison County. It is
depicted on the United States Geological Survey 7.5’ Canary topographic
quadrangle. The site was first discovered when the current owner observed a
large projectile point on the surface. Artifacts observed and/or collected include
broken dart points, two arrow points, miscellaneous bifaces, numerous flakes,
and a possible nutting stone. The arrow point depicted below (Figure 5) is the
only diagnostic specimen from this site that was available for analysis. This is a
unifacial arrow point made from chert. Although the stem is broken, this
specimen closely resembles the Perdiz type. This site is unusual in that all
artifacts were found on the bank of the river instead of a sandy hill or terrace.
There is a sand hill approximately 150 meters to the east, but no evidence of a
site has been observed in this area. It is possible that the artifacts found here
were transported to this area during floods. This site is not eligible for listing in
the National Register of Historic Places.

41MA29
This prehistoric campsite is situated on a sand hill overlooking a relict
channel of the Navasota River at an elevation of 240 feet above mean sea level
in eastern Madison County. It is 150 meters due east of 41MA27 and 215 meters
due north of 41MA30. Site 41MA29 is depicted on the United States Geological
Survey 7.5’ Canary topographic quadrangle. This site was first discovered when
the current owner cultivated the area for pasture. The major disturbance to this
site is due to agricultural activities, erosion, and wallows by feral hogs. To date,
five projectile points, seventeen ceramic sherds, and numerous flakes have been
collected by the owner. The ceramics are the only artifacts that were available
for analysis. No Cultural features were observed. The size of this site is
estimated to be four acres based on the extent of the area where artifacts were
found.
The ceramics from this site consists of one sandy paste plain rim and
sixteen plain body sherds. Most of the sherds (88%) have a sandy paste that
ranges from fine to coarse, while two sherds have a clayey to silty paste and are
tempered with grog or bone and grog. The sherds from 41MA29 are from
moderately thin vessels that are slightly thinner than the sherds from sites
41MA27 and 41MA30, and they probably represent fragments of jars and simple
bowls. Four of the body sherds (Figure 6a-d) are decorated. The specimen
illustrated in Figure 6b has a partially smoothed-over parallel-brushed decoration.
Although the orientation of the brushing is not definitive, it was probably a vertical
decoration on the body of a utility ware jar. This sherd is very likely from a vessel
made by a Caddo potter sometime after A.D. 1250. The sherd illustrated in
Figure 5b was decorated with rows of fingernail punctations. The remaining
decorated sherds were punctated with some type of tool that was pushed into the
wet clay surface (Figure 6c-d).
Because this site may contain a component that can be attributed to a
Caddo occupation, it may be eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places.

41MA30
This prehistoric campsite is situated on a sand hill overlooking the
Navasota River 100 meters to the south at an elevation of 240 feet above mean
sea level in eastern Madison County. It is depicted on the United States
Geological Survey 7.5’ Clear Lake topographic quadrangle (3096-442). The site
was first discovered when the current owner cultivated the area for pasture. The
major disturbance to this site is due to agricultural activities, erosion, and wallows
by feral hogs. The size of this site is estimated to be six acres based on the
extent of the area where artifacts were found. Artifacts observed and/or
collected include dart points, one large biface that appears to be an Archaic
knife, numerous flakes, and thirty pieces of pottery. The only lithic artifact
available for analysis was the probable knife (Figure 7). The shape of this
specimen strongly resembles the Kinney point as described and illustrated by
Turner et al. (2011:121), but it appears to be too big for use as a projectile point.
Goode (2002) conducted an extensive study of the Kinney type and concluded
that they were used as knives. This specimen is made from Edwards chert.
The ceramics from this site consists of one plain grog-tempered rim from a
bowl, twenty-six body sherds, and three base sherds. Approximately 80% of the
sherds have a sandy paste that varies from fine to coarse with no inclusions that
would have been added as temper. Three other sandy paste sherds were
tempered with bone, and five sherds with a silty to clayey paste were tempered
with grog; one silty to clayey paste sherd has no temper. The sherds in this
sample are from moderately thick vessels that were probably jars and bowls. The
three decorated sherds represent a jar with an incised-punctated motif, a
possible carinated bowl with a simple incised decoration on the rim panel, and a
brushed body sherd. The motif on the jar consists of a single straight incised line
adjacent to an area filled with tool punctations. The complete design may have
been triangular in shape with incised lines creating a triangle filled with
punctuations. Based on the ceramic analyses by Perttula (2012, 2013), the
ceramics at this site appear to represent part of an aboriginal ceramic tradition
defined by Perttula and Ellis (2013) that is localized in the east-central part of the
state. This tradition is recognized by a preponderance of plain sandy paste
pottery, especially Goose Creek Plain, var. unspecified. This type of pottery is a
distinctive aspect of the material culture remains of the inland Mossy Grove
culture defined by Story et al. (1990:258; Figure 39). Sites belonging to the
Mossy Grove culture are found in the Brazos, Trinity, and Neches-Angelina river
basins in Southeast Texas and at sites in East Central Texas and East Texas.

SUMMARY
Sites 41MA22 and 41MA27 – 41MA30 are located in a prime setting on
landforms adjacent to the Navasota River. Although these five areas have been
recorded as separate sites, it is possible that they represent different landforms
that were occupied by the inhabitants of the same site. In prehistoric times, more
permanent camps were usually established in areas where an abundance of
natural resources were available. Rivers provided a dependable source of water
that could be used for drinking and cooking, and they contained marine life that
was consumed such as fish, turtles, and mussels. Prehistoric sites on rivers and
other streams are often located in areas where these waterways could be more
easily crossed, and some of these natural crossings were later used by early
settlers who established ferries. As the country developed, some of the Indian
trails became roads that are used today with bridges where the ferries used to
operate. An example of early settlement in an area once inhabited by prehistoric
Indians (41BU16) is found in a letter by William B. DeWees who describes the
influx of settlers to the area in 1822 (Appendix I in Roemer and Carlson 1987).
He states that the area is “literally alive with all kinds of game” including buffalo
and bear.
Indians utilized networks of trails that they followed to other villages, and it
is known from the writings of early explorers, especially Henri Joutel (Foster and
Warren 1998), that the Indians in this area moved about while engaging in the
pursuit of natural resources and trading expeditions. Some researchers (Hatcher
1932:53-54) believe that “segments of the first routes of exploration often
followed pre-existing Indian trails.” McGraw et al. (1991:35) state “It is
conceivable, even probable, that these Indian routes were established well
before the Historic-contact period.”
Perhaps the most widely used trail in the area is El Camino Real de los
Tejas (also referred to as the Old San Antonio Road), a route that is based in
part on traditional Native American trails that were later used by European
explorers. For centuries, the Native Americans had used this trail for trading
between the Great Plains and Chihuahuan Desert regions. The sites discussed
in this report are on State Highway 21, a road that roughly follows the original
route of the El Camino Real de los Tejas. This historic trail was first followed and
marked by Spanish explorers and missionaries in the 1700s and was one of
several “royal roads” that connected Spanish holdings in North America with
Mexico City. This road was designated as a unit in the National Historic Trail
system in 2004.

23

An in-depth history of the Old San Antonio Road and the Caminos Reales
was published by the Texas State Department of Highways and Public
Transportation (McGraw et al. 1991). According to their research, the Old San
Antonio Road in 1691 was nothing more than a mule trail that connected the
frontier missions of an unexplored province to distant colonial settlements south
of the Rio Grande. They also state that the road changed through the centuries
and directly influenced the establishment of many Texas towns and ultimately the
modern network of state highways (McGraw et al. 1991:xix).
Although the sites discussed in this report are on State Highway 21, they
appear to be only about five miles south of the El Camino Real de los Tejas.
Since these early trails changed course over time, it is possible that this trail was
once closer. There are two known prehistoric sites and one historic site on this
trail. The prehistoric sites are 41CE19 (George C. Davis) and 41BU16, and the
historic site is the mission San Francisco de los Tejas that was established in
1690. The George C. Davis site is a major Caddoan village on the Neches River
in Cherokee County 127.8 kilometers (79.4 miles) to the east of the sites
discussed in this report, and site 41BU16 is a large camp 43 kilometers (26.7
miles) to the west in Burleson County on the Brazos River at the crossing of the
Old San Antonio Road.
The exact period of occupation of the Madison County sites is not known.
Artifacts collected suggest that the first inhabitants were Paleo-Indians that could
have utilized the area sometime between 8000 B.P. to 5700 B.P. Since not one
of these Paleo-Indian artifacts was found in situ, it is not known if they represent
a pure Paleo-Indian component of any permanence or if they were dropped by
transients during this period. The largest number of artifacts date to the Archaic
and date to a broad time span from 4500 B.C. to 1000 B.C. The last period is the
Late Prehistoric that is represented by arrow points, ceramics, and certain tools
that were used circa A.D. 800 to A.D. 1600 and later. Habitation at these sites
could have occurred during any period of the dates mentioned above.
Trade and influence from other areas are evidenced by the presence of
artifacts made from Georgetown chert that is found near the community of
Georgetown in Williamson County. Evidence of interaction with Caddo groups is
based on a single ceramic sherd that Perttula (2012) believes represents a utility
ware jar that was likely made by a Caddo potter sometime after A.D. 1250. This
potter could have been part of a small trading or hunting party that originated
from the Davis site or an outlier. Two sites in the general area where Caddo
pottery has been found are 41WA55 in Walker County where a Holly Fine
Engraved sherd (identified by Dee Ann Story) was found (Moore 1986) and
41BZ102 in Brazos County where Caddo pottery and a four-beveled knife were
collected by a local and recorded by the author of this report.

24

Raw materials from other areas, especially Central Texas, were highly
desired by East Texas Indians and were a source of trade as well. According to
Harry J. Shafer (personal communication), lithic artifacts from the Davis site
include specimens made from chert found at White Flint Park on Lake Belton in
Bell County and Uvalde Gravel (now referred to as local gravels of unknown
origin) from the Central Texas prairies. Another non-local material found at the
Davis site is Manning Fused Glass, and it is represented by debitage and arrow
point failures (Shafer 1973:163). The most likely source for this material is in
Walker County about 80 kilometers to the south and southwest.
Kenneth M. Brown (1971) discusses the resources for this material at the
Davis site and in an article in the Bulletin of the Texas Archaeological Society he
(Brown 1976) provides an overview of the origin and distribution of this material
in Texas. It has been documented by Joutel (Foster and Warren 1998) that the
Caddo made forays into other areas to obtain bison skins and tongues for trade.
According to the description of life on the Brazos River in 1822, DeWees
mentions the abundance of bison in the following statement:
“You would scarcely believe me, were I to tell you of the vast herds of
buffalo which abound here; I have frequently seen a thousand in a day
between this place, and the mouth of Little River.”
Another historic account of bison in Texas is by an anonymous author who
traveled throughout the state in 1837. His notes were edited and published by
Andrew Forest Muir (1986) under the title Texas in 1837: An Anonymous
Contemporary Narrative. The presence of buffalo in the prairies west of Houston
is described on pages 57 and 125.
The above statements are presented as possible evidence that the
Madison County sites may have been part of a hunting and trading network that
involved the inhabitants of 41BU16 to the west, 41CE19 to the east, and other
sites not identified during this study. The Davis site was abandoned sometime
during the 13th century when the elite ruling class dissipated after the outlying
hamlets became more self-sufficient and grew less dependent on the site for
religious and political matters. By the time Europeans arrived in the area in the
18th century, the Caddo groups in the area lived in small villages and hamlets,
spread across the local landscape. They had long since stopped building
mounds, and their former hierarchical social and political organization had
become much less centralized. The date of the demise of the Davis site roughly
corresponds with the proposed age of the Caddo sherd at 41MA29. This
suggests that it is possible that there was a Caddo occupation at this site.

25

These sites are in a region where there is a mixture of projectile point
types from East Texas and Central Texas. There have been no formal typology
studies for point types in this area. As a result, points found at sites in counties
such as Brazos, Burleson, and Madison are typed based on known types found
in other parts of Texas, and this is evidenced by the artifact analysis at site
41BU16. Six dart points are described in the report as “Bulverde related.” In
addition, the analyst was unable to classify sixteen arrow points. Large
collections of thousands of projectile points from the Brazos Valley are housed at
the Brazos Valley Museum and Texas A&M University. Although the
provenience of these specimens may not be specific, they do offer a large
sample that can be used for comparative purposes.
When other streams are present that flow into rivers, a greater variety of
natural resources was usually available for exploitation. In this case, the sites
described in this report are located between the river and a relict channel of the
river. To the south and across the river is a marshy area that might have
provided different sources of floral and faunal species. The presence of
projectile points is an indication of hunting, and impact fractures on some
specimens attest to their having been used. No faunal remains were available
for study, but it is assumed that marine and land animals were hunted and
consumed. At site 41BU16, for example, subsistence was based on marine
resources (gar, freshwater drum, freshwater mussels, and soft shell turtle) and
animals hunted in the nearby prairie savannah. The presence of three “nutting
stones” at 41MA27 is evidence of the gathering of nuts for eventual processing
and consumption. Ceramics are viewed by most archaeologists as related to
food preparation and storage of food and water.
As stated above, sites 41MA29 and 41MA30 are viewed as significant
because of the presence of ceramics in large numbers. Pottery is not common in
sites on the opposite side of the Navasota River in Brazos County. It could be
argued that sites with large numbers of ceramics are present in Brazos County,
but they have not been documented at this time. Very little information is
available regarding permanent settlement patterns in this area, but there is
evidence that the more long-term sites are on the major rivers. The author is
only aware of six sites (41BZ1, 41BZ10, 41BZ31, 41BZ94, 41BZ99, and
41BZ102) in Brazos County where pottery has been documented. All of the
ceramics from these sites were surface finds except for 41BZ10. This site
appears to support the hypothesis that pottery was not made and used in large
numbers in Brazos County. Only four plain sherds were found at this site. This
is viewed as a very low number and reliance on pottery at this site, and this
statement is based on the fact that only four sherds were found in 34 shovel tests
and 12 backhoe trenches. Site 41BZ10 is part of a major site on the river, and if
pottery was an important part of the subsistence at this site it seems reasonable
that it would be present in much larger numbers. This site was excavated by
archaeologists from Texas A&M University (Thoms 1993).

26

A major testing program was conducted at site 41BU16 in Burleson
County, 26.7 miles to the west (Roemer and Carlson 1987). Twenty-six cubic
meters of soil was removed during this investigation, and only seventy-two
sherds were recovered. The authors believe that they were probably made
locally from clay obtained from the Brazos River and its tributaries. They
(Roemer and Carlson 1987:121) state, “…until proven otherwise, the majority of
ceramics at 41BU16 were locally made and distributed.” They pose the
hypothesis that ceramics may have been “exchanged up and down the Brazos
River in this area.” It is also possible that there was influence from the sites in
Madison County regarding the manufacture of ceramics.

APPENDIX I: ARTIFACTS FROM 41MA27
Dart Points
Based on the wide distribution of Angostura points in Texas and the
variety of flaking patterns observed on this type, the specimens illustrated below
are classified as Angostura, and they represent the only documented examples
of this type in Madison County. Angostura points vary greatly in size, shape, and
flaking patterns; and this sometimes makes positive identification difficult.
Angostura points are found throughout Texas and, According to Turner et al.
(2011:59), they date to the Late Paleo-Indian period based on radiocarbon dates
of 8805 ± 75 years Before Present (B.P.) at 41BX831 in Bexar County and 8490
B.P. to 8080 and 8080 B.P. to 7960 B.P. at the Armstrong site (41CW34) in
Caldwell County. Specimen “a” exhibits retouch on the blade, and the base and
stem are ground or smoothed (dots indicate areas of smoothing). Specimen “b”
also has some smoothing on the base and stem. Specimen “c” has minimal
smoothing and has been reworked to create an end scraper. Thomas C. Kelly
(1983) examined a collection of Paleo-Indian points from a collection in South
Texas. Based on this study, he proposed two variants that he refers to as “Texas
Angostura” and “Zella.” Specimen “a” is made from a gray chert (origin
unknown), and specimens “b” and “c” were made from local chert that was
probably collected from river gravels.

One specimen appears to be an example of the Golondrina type, but it
also shares some minor traits of the Plainview type. Its resemblance to
Golondrina is based on its deep basal concavity (5.5 mm) that is recurved, flared
ears or barbs, and grinding on the basal edge and within the basal concavity.
According to Turner et al. (2011:110-111), this type is mainly found in South
Texas, Central Texas, the Coastal Plain, and the Lower Pecos. It is a PaleoIndian type that was dated at Baker Cave (41VV213) in Val Verde County to
circa 7080 B.C. to 6830 B.C. The only similarity to Plainview is the basal
concavity. Plainview points are not fluted, but this specimen has a small flute on
the dorsal surface. The lateral edges appear to have been abraded or ground at
one time, but most of the abrasion has been removed due to re-sharpening.
It is made from Georgetown chert.

One artifact from 41MA27 fits the description of the Pelican type.
Sherwood M. Gagliano and Hiram F. Gregory (1965) named Pelican points for
specimens found at the John Pearce site (16CD56) in Louisiana. Based on its
shape, ground or smoothed edges, and basal thinning, Pelican points are
believed to be a Late Paleo-Indian or Early Archaic type from the Great Bend of
the Red River. According to Turner et al. (2011:151), Pelican points may be
contemporary with the San Patrice type that dates to 7500 B.C.; and the two are
similar in shape. The specimen from 41MA27 is made from a very high quality
non-local chert. Two of the characteristics of this type are basal thinning that
resembles fluting and lateral edges that have been smoothed or dulled (dots
depict areas of smoothing). Both characteristics are present on this specimen. It
appears that the distal portion of the blade edge has been reworked. Its
measurements are 40.29 mm (length), 27.85 mm (width), and 6.73 mm
(thickness). The depth of the basal concavity is 3.67 mm. It is made from
Georgetown chert.

Baird’s Beveled points are believed to have been in use during the latter
stages of the Early Archaic based on examples found in well-stratified sites in the
Edwards Plateau. Specimens found in Central Texas were referred to by Kelly
(1947) as Baird’s Beveled Blade and Taylor Thinned Base. William A. Dickens
(personal communication) believes that these specimens are morphologically
different from Taylor Thinned Base. Black and McGraw (1985) suggested that
they functioned as knives, but a microware study revealed minimal use of the
lateral edges and a high frequency of impact fractures. The results of this study
are viewed by Decker et al. (2000) as evidence that they their primary function
was that of a projectile point. The general age for this type is circa 5800 B.P. to
5700 B.P. (Turner et al. 2011:88). Dickens states that excavated specimens are
usually found at the same level or just above the Martindale type. This specimen
is highly serrated on both lateral edges. Its measurements are 57.20 mm
(length), 29.93 mm (basal width), and 10.5 mm (thickness at the mid-section). It
is made from Georgetown chert.

Two examples of the Pedernales type were found at site 41MA27. The
first person to describe this point was J. Charles Kelley (1947). He named it
“Pedernales Indented Base” based on a single specimen found at the Lehmann
Rockshelter (41GL1) in Gillespie County. This type was described in more detail
by Suhm et al. (1954) who shortened the name to Pedernales. Turner et al.
(2011:148-149) place this point in the Middle Archaic with a date of 2500 B.P. to
3500 B.P. This is the most common type found in Central Texas, but examples
have been documented in other parts of the state including Brazos County.
Harry J. Shafer says that specimen “a” is an expanding stem Pedernales that is
common on the prairies along the Lampasas, Little River, and at sites in the
Brazos Valley. Specimen “b” appears to have been made from a high quality
chert that may be non-local.

T. N. Campbell (1952) was the first to recognize the Kent point as a type
based on specimens found at the Kent Crane site (41AS2) in Atascosa County,
and Suhm et al. (1954) were the first to name it. Turner et al. (2011:120) believe
this is a Middle Archaic type based on a radiocarbon date of 3156 B.P. to 2873
B.P., and McKinney (1981) dates it to the Early Archaic. Kent points are often
confused with the Gary type. Both types have contracting stems, but the bases
on the Kent type are usually rounded or straight, while those on the Gary type
are pointed. Many specimens in Southeast Texas were made from silicified wood
and appear to be unfinished because of the nature of the raw material used. It is
not uncommon for cortex to be present on the base (see specimens “a” and “g”).

The Andice type has massive barbs that extend downward, and this
makes it one of the more unusual points found in Texas. Because the juncture of
the barbs and the body is narrow, there is a very high frequency of breakage.
Andice points date to the Middle Archaic (circa 4500 B.C. to 3500 B.C.) and are
found in East Texas, South Central Texas, and across the Gulf coastal plain to
the Victoria and Corpus Christi area (Turner et al. 2011:57-58). Andice points
are morphological similar to the Bell type (see Turner et al. 2011:65). These
points are part of the Calf Creek Horizon found in Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma,
and much of Texas.

One Pontchartrain point was found at site 41MA27. This type was named
by James A. Ford and Clarence H. Webb (1956) for examples found at the
Poverty Point site (16WC5) and near Lake Pontchartrain in Louisiana. According
to Turner et al. (2011:153) this point dates from the Middle Archaic to the
Transitional Archaic (circa 2000 B.C. to A.D. 500). It is found at sites in East
Texas, Southeast Texas, and Louisiana.

Two Ellis points were found at site 41MA27. This type was first described
by H. Perry Newell and Alex D. Krieger (1949) based on specimens found at the
George C. Davis site (41CE19) in Cherokee County, and they named it “Ellis
Stemmed.” Later, Suhm et al. (1954) shortened the name to Ellis. Turner et al.
(2011:93) refer to this type as Late to Transitional Archaic with a date of circa
1000 B.C. McKinney (1981) wrote an article entitled “Paleo-Indian/Archaic
Transition Problem” in which he describes them as Early Archaic. Turner et al.
(2011:93) state that it is often difficult to distinguish this point morphologically
from the Edgewood and Ensor types, and Prikryl (1990) compares them to the
Marcos type.

Fifteen wells points and four bases that appear to be from Wells points
were found at 41MA27. Fourteen are illustrated here, and the bases are not
illustrated. The first examples of the Wells type were found at the George C.
Davis site (41CE19) in Cherokee County by Perry Newell and Alex D. Krieger
(1949) and named for the town of Wells near the site. R. L. Stephenson (1949:34
and Plate 7a:specimens 5-7)) referred to this point as “Sisterdale Shouldered.”
Turner et al. (2011:170) consider this type to be a Middle Archaic form with a
date of 4000 B.C. to 2500 B.C. Prewitt (1981) and McKinney (1981) refer to it as
Early Archaic, and Perino (1985) believes it is a Late Archaic type with an
estimated age of 2000 B.C. or later. Wells points are long and narrow, but the
presence of a long stem is their most salient feature. The blades on specimens
“h” and “i” have been reworked.

H. Perry Newell and Alex D. Krieger (1949) were the first to recognize
Gary points as a type based on examples found in East Texas where it is a
common point type. They referred to it as “Gary Contracting Stem.” Suhm et al.
(1954:416) shortened the name to Gary, and they believe it was in use between
2000 B.C. and A.D. 1000 and in some areas possibly as late as A.D. 1500 to
A.D. 1600. Gary points are often confused with the Kent type. Both types have
contracting stems, but the bases on the Gary type are usually pointed or slightly
rounded, while those on the Kent type are rounded or straight. One small
specimen was found by William E. Moore at 41WA55. It has the classic Gary
shape but is not much larger than some arrow points, and it was found in the
upper levels of the site where arrow points and ceramics were also present.
Perhaps this specimen represents the transition from dart points to arrow points.
This would be consistent with the statement by Ford and Webb (1956) that there
is evidence that this type became smaller in size in more recent times. Baerreis
et al. (1958) mentioned that there is a considerable range in variation within the
Gary type and further study may necessitate that it be divided into more than one
type. At this time, it is best described as Late to Transitional Archaic. Three
specimens from this site were identified by Harry J. Shafer as Gary preforms.
These artifacts are made from local materials.

Perry H. Newell and Alex D. Krieger (1949) named this type “Yarbrough
Stemmed” for examples found at the George C. Davis site (41CE19) in Cherokee
County. Suhm et al. (1954) shortened the name to Yarbrough. Turner et al.
(2011:173) refer to this type as Late Archaic but offer no date. Suhm et al.
(1954) date it to 500 B.C. to A.D. 1000. Perino (1985) believes it is an Early
Archaic type that may have persisted past that time.

Arrow Points
One arrow point was found at 41MA27 that appears to be an example of
the Alba type. Alex D. Krieger (1946) referred to this point as “Alba Barbed” and
named it for the town of Alba in Wood County in 1946 where the first specimens
were found. Suhm et al. (1954) shortened the name to Alba and described it in
more detail. According to Davis (1995), this type is primarily found in East Texas
and Northeast Texas. Specimens have been found in other areas of the state
but in fewer numbers such as one specimen from the Kyle site (41HI1), a
rockshelter in Hill County. Turner et al (2011:177) refer to its distribution as East
Texas, Central Texas, the coastal plain, and Louisiana. They date it to sometime
between A.D. 800 and A.D. 1200. Alba points closely resemble Bonham points
that are believed to date to circa A.D. 800 to A.D. 1600 (Davis 1995).

There are thirteen arrow point fragments in the collection, and two are
illustrated here because they are fairly complete. They are described in this
report as not recognized according to a known type. Specimen “a” shares some
traits with the Livermore type that is mainly found in the western part of the state
and specimen “b” may be an example of the Alba or Bonham type. The function
of the serrated blades on some arrow points is not known but they are common
and occur on a variety of arrow point types.

Untyped Arrow Points

15

Arrow point preforms are sometimes mistaken as a point type, especially
those with no stems or notches. A true preform represents an unfinished arrow
point and sometimes is the last step before the completion of the desired type. A
preform can be a biface or uniface. Specimen “a” is thick in the middle, and this
may reduce the choices for further reduction and shaping. It is difficult to tell if
specimen “b” is a broken arrow point or a preform. Specimen “c” is unifacial and
made from high quality chert that may not be local.

The most widely used terms for the artifacts illustrated below are drills or
perforators. Perforators were used to punch holes through leather and hides and
may have been used in tasks involved in weaving or stitching. Drills were used
in a rotary fashion to create holes in stone, bone, and wood. These tools were
used during the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods. The Late Prehistoric drills
are typically smaller than the Archaic forms and they usually have long bits that
extend from rounded bases that may be bifacial or unifacial. Late Prehistoric
drills are often associated with Perdiz arrow points and are a key trait of the
Toyah Horizon (A.D. 1350 to A.D. 1600 and later). It is important to note that a
Perdiz point was found at site 41MA28. The above information was taken from
Turner et al. (2011:239).

Scrapers are a formal tool form found in Paleo-Indian sites associated with
the Folsom culture and Late Prehistoric sites that date to the Toyah Horizon
(A.D. 1350 to A.D. 1600 and later). The specimen from 41MA27 was made on a
large flake, and it is a classic example of an end scraper. This artifact type was
sometimes hafted, and some were used as trade items. Caches of finished tools
or the blades and flakes on which they were made have been found in the Texas
Panhandle and the Llano Estacado in Central Texas. The above information was
taken from Turner et al. (2011:246). This specimen was made from a material
that closely resembles a Central Texas type referred to as “Owl Creek Black” that
is most common in the Fort Hood area. This material is also found in the gravels
associated with the Brazos River (William A. Dickens, personal communication).
Dr. Dickens (2005) discusses Owl Creek Black in his dissertation.

Two specimens from site 41MA27 appear to be formal tools that may have
functioned as gravers. Gravers may have been used for cutting and engraving
with various uses in different areas and different time periods (Turner et al.
2011:231). Gravers were used from Paleo-Indian times through the Late
Prehistoric. This specimen was made from the mid-section of a large biface that
has been re-worked into this tool. There are three areas that could represent
additional gravers that were present at one time. It is made from Georgetown
chert.

This interior flake has been worked to create a projection that appears to
have been designed to function as a graver (see arrow). One of the lateral
edges exhibits a very fine beveled edge that may have been used as a scraper.
It is not possible to accurately determine the purpose of this piece without use
wear analysis.

A core is a cobble or other form of raw material from which flakes or
blades are removed. In addition to providing a source for flakes and blades,
cores can be utilized as tools. Specimens “a” through “d” are made of chert and
are best described as “exhausted cores” because they appear to have been
utilized to their maximum extent.

This specimen is ovoid in shape and has a bit or working edge at the
widest end. Based on an examination of similar gouges using a high powered
microscope and replication experiments by Hudler (1977), it was determined that
most of these tools were used in tasks related to woodworking in an adze-like
fashion. Most gouges are referred to as Clear Fork tools as first defined by
Cyrus E. Ray (1941). Clear Fork tools have been reported over much of Texas
and can date from Paleo-Indian times through the Middle Archaic (Turner et al.
2011:225-226). The earliest professional discussion of the Clear Fork Focus was
written and published by J. Charles Kelley (1947). John C. Lohse (personal
communication) believes that this artifact could be a reworked Clear Fork gouge.
The arrow points to the working edge.

This specimen is an example of a plano-convex tool made from silicified
wood. There is an exaggerated convexity on the dorsal surface that creates a
shape that resembles a hump, and it is referred to b some as a “humpback
scraper.” William A. Dickens (personal communication) believes that these
artifacts probably used for scraping, and he prefers the term plane. Planes could
have been used to modify wood, plants, and/or bone. This specimen probably
dates to the Archaic.

Plane from 41MA27

23

There is a class of artifacts that are often referred to as eccentrics
because they cannot be recognized as a formal tool or projectile point. Turner et
al. (2011:236) refer to these as “Multinotched Early Archaic Lithics.” This unique
type of artifact is believed to date to the Early Archaic and associated with the
Calf Creek Horizon and related to Andice and Bell points. Hester (1990:4),
Weber and Patterson (1985:21-27), and Don Wykoff (personal communication)
state that learning to create the deep notches in Andice and Bell points was a
difficult task, and they hypothesize that points with multiple notches might have
resulted from the need to practice the deep-notching skills required to create
these unique points. These artifacts are found as reworked projectile points and
amorphous forms, and both types are illustrated in Turner et al. (2011:236). It
appears that the specimen from 41MA27 may have been a stemmed point that
has been extensively reworked to create shape illustrated below. The presence
of an Andice barb fragment at this site lends support to the function of this artifact
as a practice piece. It is made from Georgetown chert.
