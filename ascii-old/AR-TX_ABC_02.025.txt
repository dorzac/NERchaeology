ABSTRACT
At the request of S & B Infrastructure, Ltd., Anthony & Brown Consulting conducted an
archaeological survey of the north portion of the proposed West Rail Bypass, and the proposed Railroad
Street running adjacent to the bypass in Cameron County. The portion of the rail bypass surveyed in
2009, which has a 100-foot right-of-way, extends eastward from the existing tracks that parallel US 77/83
south of Merryman Road, arching south to run along a canal then swinging north to cross the Resaca del
Rancho Viejo from which it follows an existing gas pipeline along the northern boundary of the Resaca
de la Palma State Park. The proposed rail turns south just past New Carmen Road, extending south the
cross the Resaca de la Palma; south of this crossing the remainder of the proposed rail was surveyed by
Anthony & Brown in 2003. The new Railroad Street will run east-west immediately south of the canal
that the rail bypass follow for a short distance west of US 77/83. The proposed road right-of-way is 80
feet. The recently surveyed portion of the rail is about 4 miles in length while approximately 1.5 miles of
proposed new roadway was surveyed. The 2009 survey consisted of a 100 percent pedestrian walkover
aided by shovel tests and backhoe trenching. A total of 19 backhoe trenches found no buried cultural
materials or evidence of subsurface contexts likely to contain sites. No archaeological sites were observed
during the survey and the project is unlikely to affect significant cultural resources. No cultural materials
were collected and thus no curation is necessary.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
We would like to thank Mark Iglesias and Martin Ramírez for help with the logistics of this
project, Juan Pereida and Luis Guerrero and their staff at Juan Pereida Company for their excellent work
during the backhoe trenching phase, and Daniel Orive, Alfonso Garrido, Victor González, and Manuel
“Chito” Cisneros of the Cameron County Engineering Office and Department of Transportation who were
extremely helpful in securing access to the properties and helping to mark the centerline to insure the
trenches were effective in judging impacts. Pete Sepulveda of Cameron County also provided
considerable help with landowners along the rail. The project was delayed several times by unseasonably
heavy rains and fieldwork was hampered by wet and rainy conditions. The Cameron County staff
responded very quickly and worked long hours to complete the project prior to rains that arrived just as
the last trench was being filled. We would also like to thank Greg Sundborg and Owen Ford of the
Anthony & Brown field crew for their survey efforts in wet and muddy conditions. Special thanks are also
due to Chris Ringstaff, archaeologist with the Environmental Affairs Division of TxDOT, who shared his
experience with regional archaeology and who guided us through the new TxDOT cultural resources
procedures. William J. Wagner and Thomas R. Hester provided input on earlier versions of some of the
sections in this report and P. G. Cavazos of San Pedro provided information on the Carmen Ranch House
for the 2003 survey that is briefly mentioned here.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
At the request of S & B Infrastructure, Anthony & Brown Consulting conducted an
archaeological survey for the proposed West Rail Bypass and Railroad Street Project in Cameron County,
Texas. The surveyed section of the proposed rail line is 4 miles in length including a .8-mile previously
surveyed segment that was not trenched in 2003 due to landowner concerns and for which a new survey
was requested by TxDOT. The rail, which lies within a 100-foot right-of-way, extends west from the
Missouri-Pacific Railroad tracks that parallel US 77/83 in this area and along the north side of an existing
drain. It then heads northwest crossing a wide curve in the Resaca del Rancho Viejo. From there it
continues west, north of both the afore-mentioned resaca and Resaca de la Palma. It curves south across
New Carmen Road (the .8-mile segment), crosses the Rancho Viejo Floodway and continues south to the
Rio Grande crossing. The survey also included a new section of roadway that will replace the existing
landowner access along Butler Road. This new road will extend west from US77/83 along the south side
of the existing drain for 1.5 miles with an 80-foot right-of-way. The rail route west of New Carmen Road
has been previously surveyed by Anthony & Brown (Brown et al. 2003) and was not included in the
current proposed project except for the area between Resaca de la Palma and New Carmen Road where
trenching was not possible in 2003. A location map of the project area showing the current and previous
survey corridors is presented in the subsequent section of this report.
Survey consisted of 100% pedestrian walkover of the proposed route, accompanied by 11 shovel
tests, and 19 backhoe trenches, each component conducted at different times due to weather and access
issues. The shovel tests and the trenches revealed largely very clayey soils, with siltier deposits near the
resaca banks. None of these trenches yielded cultural materials or other evidence of archaeological sites
and no clear paleosols or other indicators of high-probability buried contexts for archaeological sites were
observed. Unseasonably wet weather delayed both the pedestrian and trenching components. The
pedestrian survey was conducted 14-18 September 2009 by Greg Sundborg and Owen Ford and required
six person days, excluding travel time. Backhoe trenching was conducted 13-16 October 2009 by David
O. Brown and Dana Anthony, requiring five person-days, excluding backhoe operator time and travel.
Dana Anthony served as PI and David Brown as geoarchaeologist. This work was conducted under Texas
Antiquities Permits number 5386.
The surface survey, shovel tests, and backhoe trenches failed to observe any surface or subsurface
cultural materials that would define an archaeological site. A single modern clear glass shard was
recovered from one trench near Resaca de la Palma in the upper disturbed fill deposits adjacent to the
resaca crossing. The only other artifact noted was a small whiteware sherd on the surface near Trench 11
and close to bank of the Resaca del Rancho Viejo. Both were obviously out of their original context. No
other materials were noted with the right-of-way. An effort was made to identify buried soils that might
contain intact deposits but none were positively identified and no buried cultural materials were observed.
The likelihood of finding intact buried deposits is very small in this region.
Because no archaeological sites were found within the Area of Potential Effect, and that together
with the many disturbances within the project area over the years, the likelihood of West Rail Bypass
construction or subsequent maintenance activities impacting a significant archaeological site is near zero.
Nonetheless, it is impossible to sample 100 percent of subsurface environments, and within an area of
Holocene alluvium, previously unknown sites could be encountered. Should any cultural materials be
noted during construction, TxDOT and the THC should be consulted immediately. Additionally, the
project should continue to take into account the presence of the Carmen Ranch House site just west of the
proposed international crossing, as described in the 2003 report. This could be an extremely important
archaeological site and if ancillary facilities such as the proposed customs building are built on the
upstream side of the bridge, this potentially highly significant site could be damaged. We recommend that
CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY — CAMERON COUNTY WEST RAIL BYPASS

this site be properly recorded and its boundaries delimited as part of planned construction in the
international bridge area. Finally, this report only presents the archaeological findings; full cultural
resource protection requires integration of the findings of the ongoing historic properties investigations.
With these caveats, the project is unlikely to damage significant cultural resources within the
APE. If the issues of historic architectural properties, including the Carmen Ranch House, are addressed,
then the project should be allowed to proceed without further cultural resource consultation.

INTRODUCTION
At the request of S & B Infrastructure, Anthony & Brown Consulting conducted an
archaeological survey for the proposed West Rail Bypass and Railroad Street Project in Cameron County,
Texas. The surveyed section of the proposed rail line is 4 miles in length including a .8-mile previously
surveyed segment that was not trenched in 2003 due to landowner concerns and for which a new survey
was requested by TxDOT. The rail, which lies within a 100-foot right-of-way, extends west from the
Missouri-Pacific Railroad tracks that parallel US 77/83 in this area and along the north side of an existing
drain. It then heads northwest crossing a wide curve in the Resaca del Rancho Viejo. From there it
continues west, north of both the afore-mentioned resaca and the Resaca de la Palma. It curves south
across New Carmen Road (the .8-mile segment), crosses the Rancho Viejo Floodway and continues south
to the Rio Grande crossing. The survey also included a new section of roadway that will replace the
existing landowner access along Butler Road. This new road will extend west from US77/83 along the
south side of the existing drain for 1.5 miles with an 80-foot right-of-way. The rail route west of New
Carmen Road has been previously surveyed by Anthony & Brown (Brown et al. 2003) and was not
included in the current proposed project except for the area between Resaca de la Palma and New Carmen
Road where trenching was not possible in 2003. The current and former survey areas are illustrated on
Figure 1.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The proposed improvements are to remove the existing Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) rail line
from the junction of the East Rail and US 77/83 south to the Rio Grande, a distance of approximately 7.69
miles. In addition the existing Brownsville and Matamoros (B&M) International Bridge Border Crossing
would be removed and relocated to a new location west of the City of Brownsville. A new West Rail
segment would be constructed from the junction of the East Rail and US 77/83 and traverse in a westsouthwest direction to the Rio Grande to the location of the proposed new international border crossing.
The West Rail Bypass is designed to originate at the junction of the East Rail and US 77/83 and
traverse west, just north of the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Resaca de la Palma refuge, for
approximately 2.7 miles. It then turns south 2,000 feet west of the World Birding Center and descends
due south to U.S. 281 and the Rio Grande. The primary components of the proposed project include the
construction of a new international rail bridge, an overpass across U.S. 281, a crossing of the International
Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC) levee, and the construction of approximately 5.85 miles of a
new single rail track. The route comprises a total of 6.0 miles. In order to eliminate a potential crossing at
grade, Butler Road would be terminated at the new railroad. In order for property owners located south of
the new relocated railroad to maintain access, Railroad Street would be extended .97 miles west.
The proposed international rail bridge will have a total span of approximately 2,940 linear feet,
crossing the entire width of the Rio Grande floodway and its associated flood control levees. The bridge’s
width will accommodate a single railroad line. The length of the United States portion of the bridge is
approximately 840 feet. At a minimum, the bridge design will include a vertical clearance above the
levees to meet IBWC requirements in addition to requirements for authorized vehicular passage along US
281. An 8 foot 3 inch curved chain-link fence system will be installed at the edges of the bridge’s
superstructure to serve as fall protection for pedestrians and as an immigration barrier. No bridge
illumination will be installed under the bridge. Gate controls will be constructed across the bridge.

The bridge structure, design, and construction will be in accordance with UPRR engineering
standards. In addition, a 1,000 square foot building will be constructed adjacent to the bridge for use by
the federal inspection services. This structure will be equipped with municipal water, sewer, and electric
services. Meetings with General Services Administration (GSA) resulted in a recommendation that the
project sponsor coordinate directly with the federal inspection agencies regarding the design and
construction of the building.
In addition to the bridge structure spanning the Rio Grande, several other drainage structures
would be required to span the Rancho Viejo Floodway, five man-made drainage ditches, and the Resaca
del Rancho Viejo. The Rancho Viejo Floodway, located approximately 1.7 miles north of US 281, would
require three 5x3-foot concrete box culverts to be placed within the floodway. The three man-made
drainage ditches, which are located approximately 3.72 miles, 4.0 miles, and 4.17 miles northeast of US
281 respectively, would require a 5x3-foot concrete box culvert at each crossing. Resaca del Rancho
Viejo, which is located approximately 4.52 miles northeast of US 281, would require two 4x4-foot
concrete box culverts. The final two man-made drainage ditches, which are located approximately 4.9
miles and 5.7 miles northeast of US 281 respectively, would require a 5x3-foot concrete box culvert and
three 5x3-foot concrete box culverts respectively.
Railroad Street from US 77/83 to .11 miles west of US 77/83 is an 18-foot-wide caliche roadway
consisting of two 9-foot-wide travel lanes. The existing right-of-way is 60 feet in width. Storm water
drainage for the roadway is accomplished by an open graded vegetated ditch. The roadway is utilized by
the adjacent Seventy Seven Flea Market as a one-way exit during the weekends.
In order to provide access to property owners south of the proposed railroad relocation, Railroad
Street would be extended .97 miles west. The new roadway would be reconstructed and widened to
provide for a 32-foot-wide roadway consisting of two 14-foot-wide travel lanes and 4-foot-wide
shoulders, a distance of approximately 1.08 miles. Additional right-of-way would be required for the
proposed extension. Right-of-way would vary from 60 feet minimum to 120 feet maximum with an 80­
foot usual width. From US 77/83 to .18 miles west of US 77/83, storm water drainage would be
accomplished by a series of inlets and pipes. The underground storm water drainage system would vary in
size from a minimum of 24 inches to a maximum of 36 inches that would be placed on the north side of
Railroad Street from 400 feet east of US 77/83 to 1,400 feet east of US 77/83 at an average depth of 7
feet. From .18 miles west of US 77/83 to 1.08 miles west of US 77/83, storm water drainage would be
accomplished by graded vegetated ditches at an average depth of 2 feet.
In order to extend Railroad Street, the road would need to span four man-made drainage ditches
and one irrigation canal. The first two drainage ditches, which are located approximately .27 miles and
.28 miles west of US 77/83 respectively, are graded open vegetated ditches that provide drainage of storm
water for the existing West Rail. In order to span these two drainage ditches, a 4x88-foot reinforced
concrete pipe with concrete wing walls and a 2x62-foot reinforced concrete pipe, with concrete wing
walls, would be installed respectively. Minor re-grading of the existing ditches would be required to meet
the proposed flow line.
The third drainage ditch, which is located approximately .30 miles west of US 77/83, would
require a 12x4x60-foot concrete box culvert, with concrete wing walls. The ditch provides additional
drainage for storm water for the adjacent flea market. The fourth drainage ditch, which is located
approximately .39 miles west of US 77/83, is a graded, vegetated, open ditch that provides drainage for
the surrounding agricultural properties in the area. In order to span the ditch, a 10x8x60-foot concrete box
culvert with concrete wing walls would be constructed. Minor re-grading of the existing ditches would be
required to match the proposed flow line.

The irrigation canal, which is located approximately .38 miles west of US 77/83, is the main
canal for the Valley Municipal Utility District No. 2. The district extends from the Town of Rancho Viejo
to the River Bend Resort located next to the Rio Grande. Constructed in the 1930s, the main canal is
unlined and extends approximately 29,700 feet. In order to span the canal, a 12x10x170-foot concrete box
culvert, with concrete wing walls would be installed.
The proposed West Rail Bypass has been designed to minimize subsurface impacts. The roadbed
will be elevated. Primary subsurface impacts will involve the construction of drainage culverts as
described above. Within the current survey area, most of these are located on artificial ditches and are
expected to have little impact. The primary construction within a high probability cultural resource
environment will involve the crossing at the Resaca del Rancho Viejo. At that locus, the 4x4 concrete box
culverts are likely to be set within the more recent channel fill deposits rather than more sensitive deposits
along the bank. The construction of Railroad Street will involve several ditch crossings as well as a
proposed underground storm water drainage system.
The proposed improvements would require the acquisition of approximately 166.4 acres of
additional right-of-way. See the figures included Appendix A of this survey report for existing and
proposed typical sections, location maps, and engineering drawings.
CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY
Because Cameron County is a political subdivision of the State of Texas, it must comply with the
provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas, now redefined as Title 9, Chapter 191 of the Texas Natural
Resources Code whose practices and procedures are contained in Title 13, Part 2, Chapter 26 of the Texas
Administrative Code. This legislation and the associated rules define the necessary conditions for
recognition and preservation of State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) and require that the various
branches of government of the State of Texas identify potential SALs through survey of public lands prior
to actions that could potentially damage those landmarks. The code’s provisions are now administered by
the Texas Historical Commission (THC). Archaeological survey must be conducted under a permit issued
by the THC in accordance with the provisions of the code.
The proposed project has received funds from both the American Recovery and Reinvestment
Act of 2009 (ARRA), and from the Federal Railroad Administration. The ARRA funds are being
administered by the Federal Highway Administration and Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT),
which are both the lead agencies reviewing the NEPA document. Because of the federal funding link,
TxDOT is effectively the lead Federal agency for cultural resources and will jointly review the project
with the THC. TxDOT’s Standards’ of Uniformity were followed in preparing the scope and research
design for the survey as well as the field methods and report preparation that adhere to standards defined
in Title 13 TAC 26.20 and Title 13 TAC 26.24. As part of their cultural resources compliance process, the
TxDOT Pharr District office and Environmental Affairs office will review the project (CSJ 0921-06-073).
Since the proposed West Rail Bypass will link to an international bridge at the southern end of
the project area, the project falls under the purview of the Department of State. Thus, potential cultural
resources within the project area are protected by the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as
amended. The intent of the NHPA is to protect significant cultural resources that might be threatened by
actions that are federally funded or permitted, or which occur on federal property. The act, which creates
the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and the Advisory Council for Historic Preservation
(ACHP), states that the ACHP must be afforded the chance to comment when any cultural resources
eligible for inclusion on the NRHP are present in an area affected by federal agency actions or actions
funded or permitted by federal agencies. The federal regulatory process is described in detail in the ACHP
regulations, 36 CFR 800, and in the regulations of the agencies and federal divisions engaged in historic
CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY — CAMERON COUNTY WEST RAIL BYPASS

Anthony & Brown Consulting
preservation. Protection of cultural resources under federal law is tied to eligibility for the NRHP that
depends on site significance as defined by National Park Service (NPS) rules 36 CFR 60. Although the
ACHP is the final arbiter of the Section 106 process, which includes the identification, evaluation, and
treatment of significant properties and impacts, in practice, the process is typically limited to review and
concurrence by the involved agency and the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), represented in
Texas by the Texas Historical Commission.
The survey was conducted under the authority of Texas Antiquities Permit No. 5386, with Dana
Anthony serving as Principal Investigator. The permit application, originally submitted in August of
2009, was reviewed by TxDOT and the THC. The survey conducted by Anthony & Brown was designed
to be in compliance with appropriate archaeological survey methods as defined in the Secretary of the
Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Archaeology and Historic Preservation (National Park Service
1983), as well as the guidelines of the Council of Texas Archeologists (1987) and the THC survey
standards (THC n.d.). The primary intent of the survey was to identify and describe all cultural resources
within the proposed project area, evaluate their potential eligibility for the NRHP and/or their potential for
formal designation as SALs and, should significant resources be located, to make recommendations for
future cultural resource management options such as avoidance, preservation, or further investigations.
As stated in the Antiquities Permit application, for the purposes of the archaeological survey, the
Area of Potential Effect (APE) is regarded as the actual project right-of-way, including both the rail and
the new access road. For the purposes of the current survey, this does not include the area from the
Resaca de la Palma crossing to the Rio Grande, the area surveyed by Anthony & Brown in 2003. While
much of the previously surveyed area has been acquired by Cameron County, the current survey APE lies
across private property. Current plans called for the roadbed to be built up, minimizing the depth of
impact, though the series of culverts and crossings described above may have some subsurface impacts.
Survey efforts were focused on these areas, particularly the resaca crossings where archaeological sites
might be located. Typical profile sections are included in Appendix A of this report.
Survey consisted of a pedestrian component, accompanied by limited shovel testing, and backhoe
trenching, each component conducted at different times due to weather and access issues. Unseasonably
wet weather delayed both the pedestrian and trenching components. The pedestrian survey was conducted
14-18 September 2009 by Greg Sundborg and Owen Ford and required six person days, excluding travel
time. Backhoe trenching was conducted 13-16 October 2009 by David O. Brown and Dana Anthony,
requiring five person-days, excluding backhoe operator time and travel.
This report presents the results of the cultural resources survey of the proposed West Rail Bypass.
Following this introduction are sections on the Natural Environment and the prehistoric and historic
Cultural Background of the project area, including relevant cultural resource investigations in Cameron
County and specific data on archaeological sites within and adjacent to the APE. Following a brief section
outlining project methods, the negative survey results are presented. This results section, which offers
detail on trenching in the area, is followed by brief concluding statements with recommendations to allow
the project to proceed. Following the References Cited section Appendix A presents other specific data on
the project, including data tables and maps as well as construction drawings.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Cameron County lies within Fenneman’s (1938) West Gulf Coastal Plain section of the Coastal
Plain physiographic province. The project area lies within the alluvial valley of the Rio Grande with a lowlying and flat topography. Geologically (Fisher 1976), the Holocene deltaic and alluvial sediments of the
area are divided into interdistributary muds, alternating with areas of silts and sands found along former
distributary channels. These deep Holocene deposits have some potential for buried sites and the survey
methods have been adjusted accordingly, as discussed in the Survey Methods section of this report.
Although the project area is lacking in natural stone a brief mention is made because siliceous
materials are generally lacking in near-surface contexts throughout the project area and surrounding
alluvial/delataic environment. Gravels along the river include sedimentary rocks of Cretaceous and
Tertiary age and also igneous and sedimentary rocks from the Trans-Pecos Texas, Mexico, and New
Mexico. The Rio Grande tributaries contain mostly Tertiary rocks and chert derived from Uvalde Gravels.
Present at depth, the paucity of stone in prehistoric cultural contexts suggests that these resources were
minimally exploited if at all, and that most stone for tools was procured from farther inland.
Soils in the project area belong to the Rio Grande-Matamoros association that consists of silt
loams and silty clays (Williams et al. 1977). There are seven soil types mapped within the project area
dominated by Harlingen clays, Laredo silty clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes, Laredo-Olmito complex,
with lesser areas of Benito clay, Cameron silty clay saline, Olmito silty clay and (Williams et al. 1977).
All were formed in alluvial sediments.
The Harlingen series are very deep soils that formed in calcareous clayey alluvial sediments and
are located on nearly level stream terraces of the Rio Grande with slopes of 0-1 percent (NRCS 2009).
These soils are classed as very fine, smectitic, hyperthermic Sodic Haplusterts. A typical profile consists
of 11 inches of grayish brown clay Ap horizon overlying 12 inches of brown clay A horizon. Beneath, a
brown clay Bss horizon extends to 35 inches. The zone overlies a light brown clay Bnssl horizon to a
depth of 59 inches. Below, to a depth of 71 inches, is a brown clay Bnss2 horizon. Within the eastern
portion of the project area these soils are located at the approximate point where the proposed West Rail
route turns to the northwest but they do not extend all the way to Resaca del Rancho Viejo. There is also a
small mapped section that crosses the drain west of the resaca crossing, then quite a large area in the
north-central section.
The Laredo series consists of very deep soils that formed in calcareous and silty alluvium derived
from mixed sources and are nearly level to very gently sloping, 1-3 percent, occurring on deltas or
Holocene stream terraces of the Rio Grande (NRCS 2009). They are classed as fine-silty, mixed,
superactive, hyperthermic Torrifluventic Haplustolls. A typical profile consists of a dark grayish brown
silty clay loam Ap horizon about 8 inches thick overlying a dark grayish brown silt loam A horizon to 18
inches depth. This layer in turn overlies a light brownish gray silt loam Bw horizon to a depth of about 41
inches. A Bk/Ck horizon, which extends to approximately 49 inches, is described as 80 percent light
brownish gray silty clay loam with thin strata of silt loam (20 percent). Below this to a depth of 72 inches
is the C horizon consisting of light gray silt loam with thin strata of silty clay loam and very fine sandy
loam. These soils are found along both sides of the Resaca del Rancho Viejo crossing and also at the far
western area of the project area where the route curves to the south.
Benito series consists of deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in
calcareous alluvial sediments on nearly level terraces above normal overflow. Slopes are less than 1
percent. They are classified as very-fine, specific, hyperthermic Sodic Haplusterts (NRCS 2009). A
typical profile of Benito clay features 8 inches of gray-clay Az horizon over 48 inches of gray-clay Anz
horizon that in turn overlies a 9-inch thick Acnz horizon of light brownish gray silty clay loam. At the
CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY — CAMERON COUNTY WEST RAIL BYPASS

bottom of the profile is a 21-inch thick 2CKnz horizon of pale brown silt loam. There is a narrow band of
Benito clay that is mapped along both sides of the drain in the eastern portion of the project area along
which both the rail, to the north, and the roadway, to the south follow. There is also a mapped area of this
soil along the northern route where the line turns directly west.
The Cameron series consists of deep, moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils
that formed in alluvial sediments. These soils are in nearly level bottomlands. Slopes are less than 1
percent. They are classified as clayey over loamy, mixed, active, hyperthermic Vertic Haplustolls (NRCS
2009). A typical profile of Cameron silty clay show 7 inches of gray silty clay Ap atop 8 inches of gray
silty clay A1 that in turn overlies 8 inches of gray silty clay B2 horizon. Underlying this is a 6-inches thick
IICca horizon of light gray silt loam that overlies 34 inches of very pale brown silt loam IIC horizon.
These soils are found in the eastern extreme of the proposed project area extending across Hwy77/83, the
Missouri-Pacific Railroad and the Main Supply Canal.
Olmito series are deep soils formed in alluvial sediments on nearly level stream terraces. Slopes
are mainly less than 1 percent. They are classified as fine, specific, hyperthermic Vertic Calciustolls
(NRCS 2009) A typical profile has 23 inches of dark gray to grayish brown silty clay A horizon
(subdivided into an Ap, an A, and an Ak) over 11 inches of dark brown silty clay Bk horizon. The
underlying very pale brown silty clay Ck horizon has soft masses of calcium carbonate and some ironmanganese concretions. These soils are found in the eastern portion of the proposed project area north of
the drain and along the northern route before it curves to the south where there is also a small pocket
north of the Rancho Viejo Floodway.
The project area lies within the Matamoran District of the Tamaulipan Biotic Province as
described by Blair (1950). Alluvial soils support fairly dense, viny riparian forests whereas drier upland
sites tend to be dominated by spiny shrubs and stunted trees. Dominant tree species include retama
(Parkinsonia aculeta), Texas ebony (Siderocarpus flexicaulis), wild olive (Cordia boissieri) and
knackaway (Ebretia elliptica). Along the floodplain of the Rio Grande the most luxuriant brush occurs.
Elms (Ulmus crassifolia) are common in some places alternating with brush species. The vertebrate fauna
of the Tamaulipan includes both Neotropical and grassland species that range into the Texan and Kansan
provinces and some in common with the Austroriparian and Chihuahuan provinces. At the time of Blair’s
publication (1950), there were at least 61 species of mammals recorded in the Tamaulipan including 36
species of snakes, 19 lizards, two land turtles, three urodeles and 19 anurans.
The eastern half of Cameron County lies within the Gulf Prairies and Marshes Vegetation Area
(Hatch et al. 1990:11-12). The marshes are located along a narrow strip of lowlands adjacent to the coast
and barrier islands while the nearly flat plains comprising the prairies extend 30 to 80 miles inland with
elevations ranging from sea level to 250 feet. The project area is within the prairie zone. The soils in this
portion of the zone are reddish brown to dark gray, slightly acid to calcareous, loamy to clayey alluvial.
Original vegetation of the Gulf Prairies was tallgrass prairie and post oak savanna. Today, many
species have increased and dominate today including honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), oaks
(Quercus), and acacia (Acacia). Grasses include gulf cordgrass (Spartina spartinae), big bluestem
(Andropogon gerardii var. gerardii), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), indiangrass
(Sorghastrum nutans), eastern gammagrass (Tripsacum dactyloides), gulf muhly (Muhlenbergia
capillaries), tanglehead (Heteropogon contortus), and many species of Panicum and Paspalum. Prickly
pear (Opuntia) are common. Sunflowers (Helianthus sp.) are common in fields and disturbed areas.
The proposed West Rail Bypass right-of-way is largely divided between active and fallow
agricultural fields. Approximately half of the current project area was in active fields at the time of the
survey; visibility was close to 100 percent in all these areas. Observed crops include sorghum, cabbage,

and sunflowers. Fallow fields, which comprised most of the remainder of the area, were covered in low
grasses and small bushes such as depression weed (Baccharis neglecta) and occasional young mesquites.
Surface visibility in these areas was highly variable, but ranged from less than 50 percent in a few places
to 100 percent in occasional large bare patches; most areas fell between in terms of visibility. A few areas,
most notably the Wentz property northwest of the Resaca del Rancho Viejo crossing, were more densely
wooded with moderately thick short grass cover. Visibility was generally poor, from 40 percent to no
surface visibility through most of this area. This more densely vegetated area accounted for less than 10
percent of the project area total in the current survey. Tiny areas of resaca banks were also covered with
dense brush, though the ground surface was bare and surface visibility was excellent in places.

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
PREHISTORY OF THE RIO GRANDE DELTA
Cameron County falls within the South Texas Plains Cultural Zone that has been subdivided into
five biogeographical areas – Cameron and Hidalgo Counties comprise the Rio Grande Delta area (Black
1989). Though many aspects of the cultural history of this lower Rio Grande corridor are still poorly
understood, numerous archaeological studies have nonetheless helped to create a picture of the ancient
lifeways of the region’s inhabitants. As the population of the region grows, increased development has
resulted in increased cultural resource preservation efforts and has generated new archaeological studies
that add considerably to our knowledge of the area’s past. This increased effort in cultural resource
identification and protection, however, has not kept pace with the region’s explosive population growth
and rapid commercial and industrial development, disturbing and destroying many archaeological and
historic sites and leaving significant gaps in the archaeological and historical record, many of which
cannot be filled because of the irreversible destruction of cultural resources.
The earliest synthesis of the region’s archaeology was attempted by E. B. Sayles (1935) who
defined the Brownsville phase based on the early collections of A. E. Anderson (1932). A decade later,
Richard MacNeish (1947, 1958) included some parts of Texas along the lower Rio Grande in his
archaeological survey of Tamaulipas, defining the Brownsville, Abasolo, and Repelo cultural complexes.
Suhm et al. (1954) summarized the archaeology of this region, incorporating newly collected data from
the Falcon Reservoir survey and excavations (Krieger and Hughes 1950; Hartle and Stephenson 1951;
Cason 1952; Jelks 1952, 1953). Two new foci were defined. The Falcon focus represented the Archaic of
the region, while the Mier focus, with smaller dart points and arrow points, was considered later in time.
Following Campbell’s (1958) brief synthesis of the archaeology of the central and southern Texas
coast, various treatises added to the understanding of the prehistory of the region. These included papers
concerning cemetery sites and burial practices (Hester 1968, 1969; Hester and Rogers 1971; Hester and
Ruecking 1969) and settlement subsistence models (Nunley and Hester 1975; Hester and Hill 1975;
Hester 1975, 1976, 1980, 1981). Prewitt’s (1974) article provided an excellent synthesis of the
archaeology of Cameron County. Another important contribution during this period was the predictive
model developed by Mallouf et al. (1977) for the lower valley area. In more recent years, regional
summaries by Hester et al. (1989), Hester (1995), and Ricklis (1995) have provided important updates to
the synthesis of the archaeology of the region.
The prehistory of South Texas and its sub-areas has been most recently synthesized by Hester
(1989, 1995) and Black (1989); the following brief summary draws most heavily from those sources. The
cultural stages are: Paleoindian (9200-6000 B.C.); Early Archaic (6000-2500 B.C.); Middle Archaic
(2500-400 B.C.); Late Archaic 400 B.C.-A.D. 800); and Late Prehistoric (A.D. 800-A.D. 1600) (Black
1989:48-51).
The earliest evidence of the human presence in South Texas dates to the Paleoindian stage.
Distinctive fluted and lanceolate-shaped projectile points characterize this period, as do artifacts like the
Clear Fork biface. Throughout the area, most of these artifacts are scattered surface finds rather than from
buried stratified sites. As yet, no intact sites dating to this period have been identified in the Rio Grande
delta (Black 1989:48). Subsistence patterns during the Paleoindian stage are thought to have relied
heavily on now extinct Pleistocene herd animals such as mammoth and bison but evidence from inland
sites such as Baker Cave suggests a more varied diet (Hester 1983).
The transition from Paleoindian to the Early Archaic is difficult to define, yet by the Archaic
there was a change in projectile points from lanceolate forms to stemmed points as well as unifacial Clear

11

Anthony & Brown Consulting
Fork tools with beveled distal ends. This probably correlates with a change in subsistence patterns to a
more varied economy that no longer had an emphasis on the megafauna extinct by Archaic times.
However, subsistence data are scarce for this area. As with the Paleoindian period, Early Archaic sites are
known throughout the area but have not yet been found in the Rio Grande delta specifically (Black
1989:49). Such sites are well-represented north of the delta, however (T. R. Hester, personal
communication, 2003). Early Archaic sites are found on high terraces and in the uplands, but several
buried alluvial sites have also been identified, though not in the vicinity of the project area. As with the
Paleoindian period, the widespread distribution of artifact types and low site counts suggests small
populations and large territorial ranges.
By the Middle Archaic, ground stone, including manos and metates, occurs at various sites,
perhaps indicating a greater reliance on plant materials than during previous stages as well as new
methods of food processing. Distally beveled unifacial tools also continue, while triangular dart points
characterize the projectile points of this stage. Stemmed points are also present (Hester 1995:438). Sites
have been identified in the uplands as well as alluvial settings and along estuary bays in the Coastal Bend.
Chronologically diagnostic artifact scatters appear for the first time in the Rio Grande delta (Black
1989:49). In Starr County, Nunley and Hester (1975:13) identified Middle and Late Archaic sites as
occurring on terraces, arroyo banks and in hilly areas overlooking the arroyos and their tributaries. Hall et
al. (1986) suggest a greater reliance on plant materials based on the presence of burned rock
concentrations. Also at this time (2500 B.C.), the stabilization of the modern sea level led to maritime
exploitation as well (Prewitt et al. 1987). Population densities apparently increased during this stage along
with more defined territories.
Late Archaic sites in South Texas are quite numerous. During this time, plant and marine
resources probably took on a greater role than hunting of large mammals. A further increase in population
is inferred by the increase in site density during this period. During this period, regional distinctions in
artifact assemblages and other cultural traits become prominent.
The final prehistoric stage, the Late Prehistoric, is well represented in South Texas (Hester 1995).
It is during this time that the bow and arrow and pottery are introduced. In Cameron County the
Brownsville complex is noted for its shell-working industry (Black 1989:520). Recent dates suggest that
some aspects of the complex, including the shell-working industry, may have developed long before the
Late Prehistoric era, although Postclassic Huastecan ceramics occasionally associated with this complex,
evidence of connections to groups along the Mexican coast (Hester 1994), probably date to the Late
Prehistoric (T. R. Hester and W. Skye Wagner, personal communications, 2003).
HISTORIC PERIOD EXPLORATION AND SETTLEMENT
In 1519 Alonso Álvarez Pineda reached the mouth of a river he called the Rio de las Palmas (Hill
1926:14). This discovery and a recommendation that the mouth of the river be colonized led to one of
those accidents that were fairly common in the Age of Discovery. As LaSalle would later mistake
Matagorda Bay for the Mississippi delta, a Spanish expedition sent by Francisco Garay to fortify the
mouth of the Rio de las Palmas seems to have arrived instead at the mouth of the Rio Grande, 120 miles
north of the intended destination, in 1520. The leader of the expedition was Diego de Camargo who
commanded three ships carrying 150 infantry, seven cavalrymen, brass cannon, masons, and building
materials to construct a presidio.
Camargo sailed upriver about 25 miles where he encountered the local inhabitants. Demanding
food, shelter and women, he made a show of arms to awe the natives. Unimpressed, they attacked the
Spaniards, killing 18, and capturing a ship and all the horses. The survivors fled to the sea and eventually
reached Vera Cruz. Not finding the planned settlement, reinforcements who arrived from Jamaica after

Anthony & Brown Consulting
Camargo’s flight, made no attempt to stay. In 1523 Garay himself arrived off Boca Chica near the mouth
of the Rio Grande with 750 men and 16 ships. When his scouts reported no trace of the two previous
Spanish forces that he thought would already be established upstream, Garay too sailed away.
It would be more than two centuries after Garay’s failed attempts before Spain began colonizing
the Rio Grande Valley and permanent settlements on the north side of the river would be even longer in
coming. Except for a couple of treks along the river in search of LaSalle’s colony to the east, Spaniards
seldom saw the Lower Rio Grande Valley until the middle of the eighteenth century (McGraw and Sparks
1989:53).
Between 1747 and 1755 José de Escandón y Elguera helped establish 24 villages and 15 missions
in present-day Northern Mexico and Southern Texas. In seven years Escandón relocated over 6,000
Spaniards and half as many Indians in the new missions and settlements, mostly clustered like beads on a
string along the river. He also laid the foundation of the ranching economy on the Rio Grande. It was one
of the most successful colonizing ventures in the history of Mexico (Chipman 1992:166-169).
By 1755 there were 17 ranches within 5 leagues (about 13 miles) of Camargo, with an estimated
6,500 horses, 2,600 cattle, and 7,200 sheep. The ranch owned by Captain Blas María de la Garza Falcón
extended across the river to the north and contained thousands of head of livestock (Chipman 1992:169).
By the end of the eighteenth century the vaquero culture predominated on both sides of the river.
Ranchers from Camargo soon began to graze their herds in the vicinity of present-day
Matamoros. Matías de los Santos Coy named his ranch in the area San Juan de los Esteros Hermosos. In
1765 the Ramirez family founded Rancho Ramireño at the site of present-day Brownsville. In 1771, Jose
Salvador de la Garza claimed the enormous Espíritu Santo grant, covering the modern site of Brownsville
and much of present-day Cameron County. Garza named it Rancho Real de Santa Petronilla. His ranch
headquarters, in the bend of an abandoned river channel or resaca, was later called Rancho Viejo with the
resaca taking the name of the ranch (Kearney and Knopp 1978:13-17). Salvador de la Garza died in 1781
and was survived by his wife and three children. The heirs maintained possession of the entire grant until
1848 when Feliciana Tijerina sold 500 acres to James Grogan. Beginning in 1877 the ranch changed
hands several times. The modern community of Rancho Viejo owes its existence to the Rancho Viejo
Resort and Country Club, begun in 1968. This area was incorporated in 1980. The community had a
reported population of 1,200 by 1992 (Garza 1996a).
In 1774 former residents of Camargo founded the village of San Juan de los Esteros Hermosos at
the site of Coy's abandoned ranch. The founders were descendants of the Escandón's colonists. In 1796
the village was renamed Congregación de Refugio de los Esteros. At that time it was the easternmost
settlement in the Rio Grande Valley (Sanchez 1991:25). In 1807 several Refugio families moved to the
San Marcos River to found the short-lived village of San Marcos de Neve. Their leader, Felipe Roque de
la Portilla, was the first empresario in Texas (Castañeda 1942:332). The village failed and many of the
survivors moved back to the Matamoros area.
Napoleon occupied Spain in 1808 and a bloody six-year guerilla war against the French
weakened the Spanish throne. Most of Spain's colonies in the New World fell to local independence
movements. Mexico gained independence in 1821. That year the village of Refugio was renamed
Matamoros for Mexican patriot and martyr, Mariano Matamoros (Buckner 1929:8). By 1829 there were
almost 7,000 inhabitants and the population rose to over 16,000 by 1837 (Kearney and Knopp 1978:31).
The fledgling Mexican Republic was chaotic and, as in France, the most immediate political
result of the revolution was military dictatorship. In Texas north of the Nueces River a wave of AngloAmerican immigrants soon severed the land from Mexico. A war with the United States that lasted from
CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY — CAMERON COUNTY WEST RAIL BYPASS

13

Anthony & Brown Consulting
1846 until 1848 finally decided the issue of who would control South Texas. Mexico lost over half of its
territory to the United States.
This war began on the banks of the Rio Grande north of Matamoros. On March 8 and 9, 1846
Zachary Taylor and United States regulars defeated Mexican forces north of the river. The artillery duel
of the first day was called the battle of Palo Alto and the heavy fighting of the second day became known
as the battle of Resaca de la Palma.
General Taylor had earlier established a military post on the north bank of the Rio Grande
opposite Matamoros and dubbed it Fort Texas. Then he withdrew to the coast to await the arrival of
volunteer regiments from the United States. The Mexicans attacked Fort Texas and Taylor was forced to
march to the aid of the garrison, thus precipitating the fighting on March 8 and 9. United States forces
were victorious and Matamoros soon fell. During the brief siege of Fort Texas, the commander, Major
Jacob Brown, was killed. The fort was renamed in his honor and Brownsville was also named for him.
Brownsville was surveyed in 1848 and several merchants from Matamoros opened branch outlets
in the new town. Charles Stillman, Samuel Belden, and Simon Mussina sold lots for as much as $1,500
each. Stillman had bought much of the Espíritu Santo grant from the heirs of the first wife of Narciso
Cavazos. The heirs of his second wife won legal title and a court battle began that lasted for many years.
One of the sons of the second wife was Juan Nepomuceno Cortina, a veteran of Arista’s army at Palo Alto
and Resaca de la Palma, who would fight his battle on the ground, not in court (Tyler et. al. 1996: I: 776).
Cameron County was created in 1848 and Brownsville was named the county seat. Ranching
remained the basis of the county's economy (Tyler et. al. 1996: I: 919). The Old Military Road was laid
out along the north bank of the river during the late 1840s, but it did little to encourage settlement.
Isolated from both the harsh central government in Mexico City and the often harsher Anglo-Texans to
the north, the vaqueros of the Nueces Strip, as the area between the Nueces River and Rio Grande was
often called, retained much of their distinctive ranching culture.
Complaining of Anglo depredations against the Mexican inhabitants of the lower Rio Grande
Valley, Juan Cortina seized the town of Brownsville with a small force of supporters in September of
1859 (Thompson 2003). Persuaded to withdraw, he returned to his mother’s home at Carmen Ranch, near
the south end of the current project area, where he defeated a party of Brownsville citizens sent to capture
him. Cortina was eventually defeated by Maj. Samuel P. Heintzelman and John S. “Rip” Ford at Rio
Grande City, withdrawing into the mountains of Mexico. Returning to attack Carrizo in Zapata County
after the outbreak of the Civil War, Cortina was defeated by Confederate forces under Capt. Santos
Benavides (Thompson 2003).
In spite of Cortina and a Union blockade of the river, Brownsville merchants flourished during
the Civil War because of the cotton trade to Europe via Mexico. The last battle of the Civil War was a
skirmish won by "Rip" Ford's Confederates against U. S. infantry over a month after Lee's surrender at
Appomattox (Oates 1961:156-159).
By the end of the Civil War the fertility of the Lower Rio Grande's soils was well known and the
area's bright future was being predicted (Stevens 1864:26-27). As late as 1882, however, an author
remarked that "outside of the towns, the people are almost exclusively engaged in stock raising" (Spaight
1882:49). There were no railroads and large-scale irrigation systems existed only on paper. Some crops
were grown along the river with the aid of tiny private irrigation systems, but these were always in danger
of being inundated by floods. Agriculture in the Valley was still a real gamble at the turn of the century
and away from the river the arid brush country still supported a pastoral economy. The twentieth century
was to bring great changes to the ranches north of the Rio Grande.

The St. Louis, Brownsville, and Mexico Railway reached Brownsville in 1904 and new Anglo
farmers soon began to arrive in the valley. Irrigation systems were constructed and large-scale truck
farming led to a new prosperity. The arrival of so many Anglo-Protestants also profoundly altered the
cultural and ethnic make-up of the area (Chatfield 1893:42; Tyler et. al. 1996 Volume 1:777-778). The
San Benito and Rio Grande Valley Railway, begun in 1912, further connected points in Cameron and
Hidalgo Counties, including the modern community of San Pedro, once called Santander, founded on the
San Pedro de Carricitas land grant. In 1928 the community was a station on the San Benito and Rio
Grande Valley Railway and by 1948 it had a church and a school. In 1976 the community had an
estimated population of 792 people who were living in 149 dwellings (Garza 1996b).
In the early twentieth century the disparity between the rich and the poor residents in the Rio
Grande Valley was as great as anywhere in Texas. The large, irrigated farms were beyond the means of
poor farmers (Richardson et al. 1981:322). Land was owned by one immigrant group and worked by
another. Promotional literature promised the new farmers an abundant supply of cheap labor in the form
of local Hispanic Texans and Mexicans from across the river (Western Farm Land Company 1910:6).
The Rio Grande Valley was hit hard by the Great Depression, as was most of the world. It lasted
from 1939 into 1941, but beginning in 1933 federal New Deal agencies were providing some relief and
hope began to return. By 1941 the war economy, with its huge demand for soldiers, manufactured goods,
and agricultural products ended the depression, although unemployment would continue to be a problem
(Richardson et al. 1981:396-97).
Today the economy of the Valley is booming once again as trade agreements between Mexico
and the United States have again made Brownsville, always a gateway between the United States and
Mexico, a major point of entry in an unprecedented level of trade between the two countries.
PREVIOUS CULTURAL RESOURCE INVESTIGATIONS
Many of the professional archaeological studies in Cameron County have focused on coastal
areas, such as the survey conducted for proposed construction at Brazos Island where an important
Mexican War depot had been located (Hall and Grombacher 1974). The Brazos Santiago depot and Fort
Polk were also the subject of at least one master’s thesis (Banks 1983). In this general area, a series of
terrestrial and underwater archaeological survey and testing projects were conducted for alterations to the
Port of Brownville ship channel entrance (Nichols et al. 1981; Espey, Huston and Associates 1990, Hoyt
and Myers 1991) and at Brazos Island (Hoyt and Gearhart 1992). Also in this general area near the mouth
of the Rio Grande, the environmental assessment of the nearby Playa del Rio development at the mouth of
the Rio Grande (Espey, Huston and Associates 1987) summarized some of the area history and conducted
limited archaeological surveys.
Other Cameron County archaeological investigations have been concentrated along the river,
particularly in the Brownsville area. Rogers (1996) found 10 archaeological sites, all historic, in a survey
of the Brownsville International Bridge at Los Tomates. Farther downstream, survey of a proposed Port
of Brownsville International Bridge featured a re-evaluation of the Rancho Los Sauces site (Brown et al.
2002). Upstream from the project area, in Hidalgo County, archaeological survey at the Pharr-Reynosa
International Bridge recorded 10 archaeological sites, many of them associated with the El Capote Ranch
Community (Kibler and Freeman 1993). Several of these were later tested (Boyd et al. 1994).
The results of many of these surveys have emphasized historic sites. Among the most important
of these have been studies at the Mexican War battlefields in and around Brownsville. Studies at the Palo
Alto Battlefield (Baxter and Killen 1976; Bond 1979; Bond and Garrison 1979; NPS 1979; Paull 1982;
Plitt 1992) were among the earliest conducted in the county. The definitive volume on the Palo Alto battle
CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY — CAMERON COUNTY WEST RAIL BYPASS

15

Anthony & Brown Consulting
by Haecker (1994) includes much of this research and other archaeological investigations as well as a
limited analysis of documentary sources. The Park Service has synthesized many of the various studies in
a series of management plans (NPS 1994, 1998). Closer to town, historic Fort Brown has been the subject
of several studies (Carlson et al. 1990; Moir et al. 1993; Hartmann et al. 1999). The Resaca de la Palma
battlefield site, portions of which are now owned by the City of Brownsville, has seen more limited
investigations (Collins et al. n.d.; Bateman 1982; Ratliff 1993, 1994). Recently, the Mexican War sites
have been revisited and assessed by Perttula et al. (1997). This report includes an assessment of Palo Alto,
Resaca de la Palma, Fort Brown, and the Rancho de Carricitos battlefields, as well as sites near the mouth
of the Rio Grande such as Brazos Santiago, Camp Belknap, and Clarksville.
Dozens of small surveys have been conducted throughout the county for various federal, state,
and municipal projects. The vest majority of these projects have been negative. In particular, very few
prehistoric sites have been located. Geoarchaeological studies, which have emphasized the relatively late
development of the delta, suggest some reasons why prehistoric sites are rare in many parts of the county
(Kibler 1994; Frederick 1995; Gustavson and Collins 1998; Caran 2002).
Despite the amount of survey undertaken in the county, there have been relatively few
excavations and much of what is known about the archaeology of this area is known from surface
collections. One of the earliest and most important was the prehistoric cemetery excavations reported by
Michael Collins and his colleagues (Collins et al. 1969) at the Floyd Morris site in Cameron County.
Another important prehistoric cemetery site in Cameron County, the Unland site, was reported by Mallouf
and Zavaleta (1979). Excavations at the Ayala site (Campbell and Frizzell 1949; Hester and Ruecking
1969) in nearby Hidalgo County have also been extremely important in understanding the prehistoric
cultures of the region. These cemetery sites are somewhat unusual and offer a rare glimpse into the
cultures of this region (Hester 1968, 1969; Hester and Rodgers 1971; Hester and Ruecking 1969). In more
recent years, limited excavations were undertaken at the Horse Island site (Eling et al. 1993) while more
extensive test excavations were undertaken at four sites in the Los Tomates Bridge project area (Rogers
and Cruse 1996). These sites were primarily historic, and while the investigations did not determine these
sites to be significant, they did determine the likelihood that historic sites could be buried in the
floodplain of the river, something also noted by Frederick (1995).
Relatively few archaeological studies have been conducted in the general area of the current
project. Zavaleta (1984) surveyed an area south of Carmen Gin, not far southeast of the southernmost
terminus of the project area. He recorded no archaeological sites in that effort. Warren’s (1993) survey for
a new wastewater treatment plant in nearby San Pedro recorded no archaeological sites. North of the
project area, Houk and Barrile’s (2003) recent survey near Rancho Viejo also recorded no sites. The
survey by Maslyk et al. (1999) of 18 miles along the proposed Penn Octane pipeline recorded one
archaeological site, 41CF178, at the western end of the proposed route. This mid-nineteenth through
twentieth-century historic site was severely disturbed and not considered significant. Ringstaff (2002)
surveyed portions of this pipeline within the Resaca de la Palma State Park, adjacent to the project area.
but did not record any sites. Cooper et al. (2003) conducted an archaeological survey of the International
Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC) levee system along the river in Cameron and Hidalgo
Counties. They recorded several new archaeological sites along the river, none close to the current project
area.
Previous work within the current project area includes two surveys that covered portions of the
proposed West Rail Bypass. These include the survey of the West Rail Bypass western line running from
New Carmen Road south across Hwy 281 to the Rio Grande (Brown et al. 2003). The other survey was
conducted by Prewitt and Associates (Kibler 2002-Texas Historic Sites Atlas) for the MB Pipeline that
runs adjacent to the northern portion of the proposed West Rail.

Sites recorded within the project area or within one kilometer include 41CF183, represented by a
single marine shell (Kibler 2002- Texas Historic Sites Atlas). This site is plotted on the THC-Atlas as
being close to Resaca de la Palma where the western segment of the route starts to curve to the east. It
was not relocated during the 2003 survey (Brown et al. 2003). 41CF185 was recorded as a scatter of
historic and modern materials at the location of two formally standing structures just south of the Resaca
de la Palma bend along the western terminus of the proposed line (Brown et al. 2003). Slightly over one
kilometer west of the southern extent of the route a recent historic dump was recorded, 41CF204, as part
of a survey for Homeland Security (Texas Historic Sites Atlas).
Various historical and architectural surveys have been conducted within Cameron County. Near
the proposed project area are several THC Medallion Markers, including the Sabás Cavazos Cemetery
and the site of Santa Rita, the county seat of Cameron County from 1848-1849. In 1934, the Carmen
Ranch House was drawn and photographed for the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) as part
of a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project. Located near the southern end of the project area, the
ranch house, which is no longer standing, was a well-made brick structure near the bank of the river (see
Brown et al. 2003:11-12 for a photo and plan drawing). In addition to being a fine example of nineteenthcentury Mexican brickwork, the house was famous as the home of Juan Nepomuceno Cortina, whose
raids wreaked havoc in the mid-nineteenth-century Lower Rio Grande Valley.

SURVEY METHODS
Anthony & Brown conducted an intensive survey as defined in 13 TAC 26.5 (35) and 26.20 of
previously non-surveyed portions of the West Rail area of the APE. The APE is here defined as 4 miles of
new railroad right-of-way (100 feet wide) as well as a 1.5-mile section of roadway (80 feet wide) that will
be built to provide access to properties isolated by the planned rail. The survey examined all of this area
excluding only the southwestern leg previously surveyed by Anthony & Brown in 2003. With the
exception of road crossings such as New Carmen Road, the proposed project area is still all private land.
The intent of the proposed survey was to locate and conduct a preliminary evaluation of
archaeological sites within the proposed survey corridor. The survey was intended to search for and
record both prehistoric and historic archaeological sites that might be found within the proposed project
area. The study of existing historic structures is being conducted under a separate contract.
Examination of the geologic history of the delta suggests that much of the county below
Brownsville proper may have been estuarine marsh prior to about 2500 years ago with little potential for
human settlement through much greater potential for short-term procurement activities (Brown et al.
2002). Only dunes scattered across this wet, and largely saline environment, were attractive sites for
settlement and perhaps staging areas for resource procurement, essentially what Anderson encountered in
his early survey. Upstream from Brownsville, Late Holocene riverine deposits overlie earlier estuarine
deposits (Brown et al. 2003; Cooper et al. 2003). The highly active, low-gradient Late Holocene river
system is marked by numerous channel shifts and deltaic-type distributary systems, with very few marked
levees or higher relict landforms, though such landforms do become more prominent in adjacent Hidalgo
County (Ringstaff and Brown 2005). This unique geologic history makes the discovery of sites and even
at times the identification of potential high probability areas a more difficult process, necessitating a
component of directed subsurface investigations such as trenching.
The discovery of sites through investigation of levees and relict landforms is further complicated
by intensive agricultural activities, including massive leveling of fields throughout Cameron and adjacent
counties. The excavation of large canals and ditches has further altered the configuration of the land
surfaces around the West Rail area. Field identification of relict landforms is no longer possible in some
parts of the general area. Within the project area, there are few clues to such features though the project
design aerials do show occasional slightly elevated features along resacas. A possible paleosol was noted
by Chris Ringstaff in trench excavations in Resaca de la Palma State Park near the western end of the line
(personal communication, 2009).
Given the extent of recent Holocene fluvial activity, Paleoindian and Early Holocene sites are
thought to be rare to non-existent in the area and even Middle Holocene sites are not generally found in
the area. Late Holocene sites may be present, but the paucity of such sites recorded in surveys of similar
areas in the delta suggests that they are also rare. The lack of easily accessible stone sources in the delta
area and frequent flooding certainly argues that long-term village occupations were not likely a common
occurrence. Western Cameron County is roughly equidistant from shell resources for tools and good
fishing grounds along the littoral margin of eastern Cameron County and from stone sources and perhaps
better mammalian hunting grounds in the less saline uplands of western Hidalgo County. Thus, while the
lack of recorded prehistoric sites may be in part of function of deep burial, it may be equally due to more
ephemeral utilization of the middle delta region, parallel to the paucity of sites away from major streams
and elevated landforms in some areas of the inland coastal plain behind the estuarine lagoons farther north
along the Texas coast. By the same token, the rarity of such sites and our limited understanding of
prehistoric adaptation to this zone, suggests that any intact prehistoric sites found in the survey would be
of great importance.

The rarity of prehistoric sites is balanced by the relatively numerous occurrence of historic sites
in the middle delta area. Many of these sites are twentieth-century occupations, dating to the beginning of
widespread ranching settlement away from the river. For the most part, earlier historic ranching
settlements are limited to the riverine margins, such as the Goseacochea ranch noted in the previous
Anthony & Brown survey (Brown et al. 2003). Some early historic ranchos were located away from the
river, however, and more temporary facilities may have been common. The presence of Mexican or
Spanish ceramics would easily distinguish such sites. Unfortunately, most such sites, even the earliest, are
typically close to the surface and many, if not all, have been severely damaged by plowing and field
leveling. While such sites may have great cultural and historical value, especially at the local and regional
level, their archaeological value is likely to have been compromised. The presence of intact features,
including structural foundations as well as trash pits and other activity remains was considered an
important clue to site integrity, should sites have been located.
These issues were taken into account in the search for and evaluation of historic sites during the
archaeological survey. Available historic maps and photos were also examined to aid in survey. While the
examination of plowed fields was the key to the broadest and most thorough coverage, backhoe trenching
was used as the most important guide to the discovery of buried prehistoric and even historic materials.
As part of the background for the survey, the Texas Historic Sites Atlas was checked for
previously recorded sites located in the corridor and within one-eighth mile or one kilometer. In addition,
reports previously acquired from the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory were also consulted.
Copies of the 1936 (Figure 2) and 1956 West Brownsville, Barreda, and Olmito USGS topographic maps
from the Perry Castañeda Library, University of Texas and maps on file at the Texas State Library,
including the 1940 (Figure 3) and 1961 (Figure 4) General Highway Maps of Cameron County, were
examined for the presence of possible historic sites as well as land use along the route. Overall, these
maps suggested a very sparse early twentieth-century occupation in the general area, with only two
marked structures near the route of the proposed rail. These two loci were noted and closely examined by
the pedestrian survey team.
Methods used during the survey were informed by the research design outlined above. All
methods complied with applicable standards as referenced in the THC practices and procedures (13 TAC
26.20) and the THC Survey Standards, as well as the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines
(1983). Fieldwork for the survey consisted of 100 percent pedestrian survey with 20 meter transects,
including both the railbed and the proposed new location of the roadway.
An intensive survey was conducted as defined in the THC practices and procedures (13 TAC 26.5
(35) and 26.20) of previously non-surveyed portions of the West Rail area of potential effect (APE). The
APE is here defined as 4 miles of new railroad right-of-way (100 feet wide) as well as a 1.5-mile section
of roadway (80 feet wide) that will be relocated to accommodate the planned rail. The survey examined
100 percent of this area but did not include the southwestern leg previously surveyed by Anthony &
Brown in 2003.
The 100-percent pedestrian walkover was augmented by 11 shovel tests in areas where shallowly
buried remains might be present or where surface visibility was severely obscured. Shovel test locations
are shown in Figure 5 at the beginning of the next section of this report; more detailed data can be found
in a table in the appendix. Shovel tests ranged from 25 to 30 centimeters depth in the wet, clayey soils
along the route of the rail. Attempts to sieve the heavy clayey soils through quarter-inch screen were
generally futile; the matrix was mostly carefully troweled in a search for artifacts. The shovel tests were
negative as was the entire pedestrian survey. Note that all tests and trenches were located on private land.

Given the fluvial environment and the possibility of deeply buried sites, as well as the paucity of
surface sites recorded in nearby areas, backhoe trenching was considered the best opportunity, not only to
directly find sites, but to locate potential buried surfaces that might have been candidates for site
locations. A total of 19 backhoe trenches were excavated, ranging from about 1.35 to 2.20 meters in
depth. Most were around 5 meters in length and just under a meter wide.
Excavation of the trenches was carefully monitored, often by both field archaeologists present in
that phase. The locations of these trenches are shown in Figure 6 in the next section of this report and
additional location data are provided in tabular form in Appendix A of this report. No screening was
attempted, as the majority of the sediment was heavy clays and clay loams that would not pass through
the screen, but trench walls were carefully examined and troweled where feasible to search for clues.
Trenches were described according to standard NRCS conventions and these descriptions and preliminary
geomorphological interpretations are presented in the Survey Results section below. In the end, no buried
cultural materials were observed and few indicators of potentially high probability subsurface
environments were noted. No sites were recorded in the trenching phase.

SURVEY RESULTS
SURFACE SURVEY
The initial pedestrian survey of the project area, undertaken in September of 2009, was hampered
somewhat by saturated soils and rainy conditions. Although the route of the line had been staked, some of
the stakes had been removed or knocked over, while others were difficult to find in wooded or brushy
areas. Despite this, examination of the GPS tracks and waypoints showed that the crew remained within
the right-of-way during the entire survey, straying only occasionally to examine immediately adjacent
exposures.
The surface survey found nothing but occasional modern trash within the right-of-way and very
little of that. Ground surface visibility ranged from excellent in plowed areas on the Ortiz, R.E.C.L.,
Garza and Myers, and Esquivel properties to poor on the Wentz tract. The remaining tracts had sparse
grasses and occasional shrubs and offered generally moderate to good surface visibility. To offset the lack
of surface visibility and sample deeper deposits, 11 shovel tests were attempted along the route (Figure 5).
All encountered heavy clay soils and were limited to 25-30 centimeters depth. Attempts to screen these
clays were not wholly successful and ditch and canal exposures were used when possible to augment
subsurface examination during the surface survey. The shovel tests were negative.

Figure 5. Shovel test locations along proposed route of West Rail Bypass.
In addition to the tests in areas with low surface visibility, two shovel tests (STs 1 and 2) were
located on the Garza & Myers property at the site of a formerly standing house depicted off Butler Road
on the 1936 Cameron County USGS, West Brownsville quad (surveyed in 1930). The land here is a
fallow agriculture field in heavy weed growth. Ground visibility in this area ranged from 10 to 50 percent.
CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY — CAMERON COUNTY WEST RAIL BYPASS

Anthony & Brown Consulting
The tests were only excavated to 30 centimeters below the surface due to the heavy, wet clay. Backhoe
Trench 15, described later in this report, was also excavated in this area and no evidence of the historic
occupation was noted in the trench or the adjacent surface areas. However, the access road of the nearby
canal, located outside of the right-of-way, did show concentrations of mid-twentieth century artifacts in
this general area. It is not clear if this was excavated from the drain itself or brought in as fill, but the
adjacent property, where the trench and shovel tests were located, showed no evidence of having been
scraped and no surface artifacts at all. Additionally, the soil of the elevated berm where the displaced
artifacts were found was a tan color unlike anything seen in the upper two meters or so of nearby
trenches. Thus while the artifacts in the berm, which do not extend much beyond the suspected area to the
east or west, there is little evidence that would link them to this former house site. In any case, the former
house may have been located slightly north of the right-of-way. In any case, it is not visible on the 1936
Cameron County Highway map and none of the materials in the berm actually seem to pre-date 1936.
There is no evidence for cultural materials in this area.
BACKHOE TRENCHES
A total of 19 backhoe trenches were excavated along the route of the proposed rail including one
at the north end of the proposed service road (Figure 6). The trenches were designed to sample a variety
of soils and geologic settings, especially in the area of obvious superficial features such as the resacas. A
few small agricultural fields that were still in crops were excluded from the total sample but this was a
small and nearly insignificant part of the total line. Nine of the 19 trenches were dug in active fields,
while seven were excavated in grassy areas that had not been plowed in some years. The remaining three
trenches, all on the Wentz property, were in areas grown up with dense mesquite, huisache and a brushy
understory; while this area showed some sign of having been plowed, it has not been for many years or
even decades.
The trenches were mostly 5 to 6 meters long, and ranged in depth from about 1.5 to 2.2 meters.
Most were largely clay, clay loam, or silty clays and clay loams. A few had silty zones and fewer still had
very fine to fine sandy zones. No coarser sediments were encountered. Almost all had recognizable plow
zones, though several that had not been plowed in years were very vague. Carbonates were present in
many trenches, mostly between about .50 and 1.5 meters in depth, and nowhere strong enough to suggest
a pre-Holocene age to the sediments. Gleying and manganese concretions were very rare suggesting that
the area has not been marshy or lacustrine for some time. A very few trenches showed light signs of
oxidation mottling, but nowhere was this extreme. Overall, pedogenic alteration of the sediments was
limited. In addition to the above noted characteristics, evidence of translocated clays was minimal to non­
existent in most trenches and clay skins were observed on peds in only one trench.
Trenches were numbered in the order excavated and since this was not necessarily ordered across
the entire project area, the trenches are divided by tracts to facilitate comparisons between adjacent
trenches. Note also that the trench numbering was not continued from the 2003 project but begun again at
1 with this project.
The soil descriptions were made using standard NRCS terminology, but the focus was identifying
cultural materials and contexts where buried sites might occur rather than taxonomic identification. In
several cases, descriptions were limited where adjacent trenches were similar and apparently part of
identical depositional units. Occasional comments on the geomorphological setting are appended to the
individual descriptions.

Garcia Guajardo and Sampayo Properties
The Garcia Guajardo and Sampayo tracts are located east of New Carmen Road, extending to a
deep drain that separates them from the Wentz property. Within these properties, the rail runs
immediately north of a gas pipeline that runs in turn along the north edge of the Resaca de la Palma State
Park boundaries. This area was of some interest because of its proximity to the two resacas. Trenches 1
through 5 were excavated along the northernmost east-west section of the rail line. Trenches 1 through 3
were east of New Carmen Road and north of Resaca de la Palma, Trenches 4 and 5 were north of Resaca
del Rancho Viejo. With the exception of Trench 5 where the ground surface was exposed with
intermittent small bushes or grasses, thick grasses covered the entire area. Small mesquites and depression
weed bushes (Baccharis neglecta) were scattered about, with a few thicker clusters along the route.
Trench 1
Trench 1 was located about 175 meters east of New Carmen Road in a fallow field (Figure 7). It
lies roughly 365 meters north of the Resaca de la Palma channel and 110 meters west of Trench 2.
Maximum trench depth was 2 meters and trench length was 5 meters. Trench width was .9 meter.
Orientation was 100 degrees. The area around this trench is mapped as Chargo silty clay. Three
pedostratigraphic units were recognized.
Zone I – 0 to 20 cm; very dark gray (2.5Y3/1) clay loam; crumb or granular structure (.5 cm);
common fine roots; some lighter color silt washing down along cracks between peds;
some sediment mixing; occasional pores and wormcasts; clear, wavy lower boundary; Ap
horizon but not plowed recently.

Figure 7. Excavating Trench 1.
Zone 2 – 20 to 40 cm; very dark gray (2.5Y3/1) clay loam; strong to moderate, medium
subangular blocky structure; vertical cracks developing; some lighter silty sediment from
above filling old cracks; some mixing from below; few pores; occasional fine to medium
roots; lower boundary clear, smooth, but some mixing along boundary; A1 humic soil
below recent plow zone.
Zone 3 – 40 to 200 cm; dark brown (7.5YR4/3) silty clay; strong, coarse subangular blocky
structure at top trending to prismatic in middle of zone and generally massive towards
base; moister near bottom of trench; no roots, pores, or wormcasts; large cracks;
occasional carbonate concretions 100-150 cm below surface, most frequent at 150 cm;
A2/Bca/C horizon, texture and color the same throughout but the subangular blocky
portion is likely the undifferentiated lower A horizon, the weak prismatic structure with
carbonates is the Bca horizon and the massive base is the C horizon as described for
Cargo silty clay .
The soil observed in this profile generally resembles the mapped Chargo silty clay but the B
horizon described in the series description is weakly expressed at best. It clearly corresponds to the
carbonate nodules and weak prismatic structure found in the middle segment of the profile but these were
occasional and a weak Bca at best. Note that some of these were clear crystalline crystals, more gypsumlike than carbonatic, but no field tests were conducted. The fields on the Garcia Guajardo and Sampayo
properties were clearly irrigated in the past, though they have not been plowed in some time, and this has
influenced the development of these concretions. The sediments in this trench are old, fine-grained,
overbank alluvial terrace deposits that have long lost all traces of depositional strata. There was no
evidence of buried stable surfaces and no cultural materials.

Trench 2
Trench 2 was located about 110 meters east of Trench 1 and 355 meters north of the Resaca de la
Palma channel. It was 270 meters west of Trench 3. Maximum trench depth was 1.4 meters and trench
length was 5 meters. Trench width was .9 meter. Orientation was 100 degrees. The area around this trench
is mapped as Laredo silty clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes. Three pedostratigraphic units were recognized.
Zone I – 0 to 30 cm; very dark gray (2.5Y3/1) silty clay loam; crumb or granular texture at top;
some pores and wormcasts; frequent fine roots; lower boundary clear, slightly wavy;
Ap/A1 horizon, plow zone vaguely expressed at top but not plowed in recent years.
Zone 2 – 30 to 100 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR4/2) silt loam; weak, fine to medium
subangular blocky structure; underlying crumb structure; compact; carbonate concretions
begin at 70 cm with highest concentration of nodules 80 to 100 cm; few fine roots, no
pores or cracks; clear, smooth lower boundary; B2 horizon.
Zone 3 – 100 to 140 cm; brown (10YR4/3) silty clay loam, coarse, moderate to strong subangular
blocky structure; very compact; no cracks, some carbonates at top above impermeable
clay; C horizon, upper portion may be a Cca.
This trench is much siltier than Trench 1, roughly matching the description of the Laredo silty
clay loam that is mapped in this area. This soil is mapped as a broad band along the Resaca de la Palma
channel and reflects the slightly coarser (silt loam and silty clay loam versus silty clay) texture of the
deposits along the margins of the resaca. While slight, it indicates that these deposits are indeed related to
the visible channel rather than relict deposits of an earlier channel. This suggests late Holocene deposition
but, as with Trench 1, the loss of all primary depositional characteristics indicates that this meander belt
has been abandoned for some centuries, if not longer. No cultural materials or buried stable surface were
observed in the profile.
Trench 3
Trench 3 was located 270 meters east of Trench 2 and about 290 meters north of the Resaca de la
Palma channel, the closest point of approach to this old channel on the Sampayo property. It was 465
meters west of Trench 4. Maximum trench depth was 1.6 meters and trench length was 5 meters.
Orientation was 100 degrees. Trench width was .9 meter. The area around this trench is mapped as Laredo
silty clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes. Three pedostratigraphic units were recognized.
Zone 1 – 0 to 30 cm; very dark gray (2.5Y3/1) silty clay loam; essentially the same as Zone 1 of
Trench 2.
Zone 2 – 30 to 100 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR4/2) silt loam or loamy silt; essentially the
same as Zone 2 of Trench 2, but carbonate concretions start at 55 cm; concretions still
densest 80 to 100 cm
Zone 3 – 100 to 160 cm; brown (10YR4/3) clay-silty clay; essentially the same as Zone 3 of
Trench 2, but becomes moister, massive and slightly redder (dark brown - 7.5YR4/3) at
base.
All the zones in this trench were essentially the same as in Trench 2 with only slight differences
in color or carbonate density. The same comments regarding the geomorphological setting along the

CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY — CAMERON COUNTY WEST RAIL BYPASS

resaca banks apply here. As with Trench 2, no cultural materials or buried stable surface were observed in
the profile.
Trench 4
Trench 4 was located 465 meters east of Trench 3 and about 350 meters northwest of the Resaca
del Rancho Viejo channel. It was 410 meters west of Trench 5. Maximum trench depth was 2.2 meters
and trench length was 5 meters. Trench width was .9 meter. Orientation was 102 degrees. This trench lies
on the boundary between Chargo silty clay to the west and Harlingen clay, saline, to the east. Only two
pedostratigraphic units were recognized.
Zone 1 – 0 to 60 cm; dark brown (7.5YR4/2) clay; moderate, fine to medium subangular blocky
structure; large, coarse blocky peds in plow zone; slickensides on peds 35 to 50 cm; fine
roots through upper half; gradual, smooth lower boundary; Ap/A horizon, indistinct plow
zone to about 15 cm suggests not plowed in recent years, lower portion may be weak Bss
horizon.
Zone 2 – 60 to 220 cm; brown (10YR4/3) clay; massive; little cracking; slightly redder and
moister toward base; very few carbonates; B horizon.
This trench was very different from Trenches 1-3, more closely resembling the Harlingen clay
that is mapped on the eastern end of the trench. This deposit seems to represent very fine-grained
overbank terrace deposits at some distance from the channel, but could also be a somewhat older relict
deposit between the more recent adjacent resaca channels. Further analysis would be needed to determine
this. In any case, no cultural materials were observed and no buried stable surfaces were present.
Trench 5
Trench 5 was located 410 meters east of Trench 4 and 225 meters north of the Resaca del Rancho
Viejo channel (Figure 8). This is the closest point of approach to this channel on the Sampayo property.
The trench was about 700 meters west of Trench 19 on the adjacent Wentz property. This trench is
essentially the same as Trench 4. Water was reached at 2.05 meters. This section of the property appears
to be frequently inundated; land crabs. Maximum trench depth was 2.1 meters and trench length was 5
meters. Orientation was 94 degrees. Trench width was .9 meter. This area is mapped as Benito clay. As
with Trench 5, only two pedostratigraphic units were recognized.
Zone 1 – 0 to 60 cm; dark brown (7.5YR4/2) clay/clay loam; essentially the same as Zone 1 in
Trench 4.
Zone 2 – 60 to 210 cm; brown (10YR4/3) clay; essentially the same as Zone 2 in Trench 4.
Though this area is mapped as Benito clay, the trench profile is almost identical to that of Trench
4. In geomorphic terms, it seems to represent backswamp or very fine-grained overbank deposits. As with
Trench 4, no cultural materials were observed and no buried stable surfaces were present.
Ortiz Property
Trenches 6 through 10 were located on the curve of the Ortiz property between New Carmen
Road and the Resaca de la Palma crossing. A single modern artifact was recovered from a fill layer in
Trench 8. Trenches 7, 8, and 9 were placed well east of the centerline stake as an extra precaution in
avoiding the gas pipeline adjacent to the west boundary of the right-of-way. All the trenches were in

recently harvested fields with the exception of Trench 6 that was in tall grasses. The large areas under
cabbage and sunflower cultivation were avoided at the request of the landowner.

Figure 8. Trench 5 area, looking north.
Trench 6
This trench was located about 25 meters west of New Carmen Road in a grassy fallow field
(Figure 9). It was about 210 meters west of Trench 1 and 565 meters northeast of Trench 10, the closest
trench to the southwest. It was oriented at 262 degrees, 6 meters in length and .9 meter wide. The trench
reached a depth of 1.9 meters below the surface. This area is mapped as Olmito silty clay, just west of its
boundary with a pedon of Chargo silty clay. Three pedostratigraphic units were recognized.
Zone 1 – 0 to 20 cm; very dark gray (7.5YR3/1) clay loam; granular/crumb structure; many fine
to medium roots; clear, wavy lower boundary; Ap horizon.
Zone 2 – 20 to 125 cm; very dark gray (7.5YR3/1) silty clay; massive; moist; inclusions of lighter
color material near base; roots, worm casts, and occasional tiny pores at top; calcium
carbonate extends to base of zone; gradual, smooth lower boundary; B horizon.
Zone 3 – 125 to 190 cm; yellowish brown (10YR5/4) silt loam; moist, weak, coarse subangular
blocky structure; carbonate nodules extend into zone from above; clayier in bottom 20
cm; also darker; pores and root traces at top.
While the upper profile of this trench somewhat resembles the typical profile of Olmito silty clay,
the silt loam of Zone 3 more closely matches the typical profile of Cargo silty clay that has a very pale
CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY — CAMERON COUNTY WEST RAIL BYPASS

Anthony & Brown Consulting
brown silt loam from 41 to 47 inches (104 to 119 cm) that is noted as a separate lithostratigraphic unit. In
the Chargo profile, this silt loam is underlain by a light brown silty clay that may be vaguely related to the
clayier sediments at the base of Zone 3. Zone 3 appears to be a different deposition unit but the gradual
horizon boundaries indicate that many of the original deposition characteristics have been modified or
overprinted by more recent pedogenic processes. There is no clear evidence of a stable surface or soil
formation at the top of Zone 3 and no cultural materials were observed in the trench.

Figure 9. Excavating Trench 6.
Trench 7
Trench 7 was placed in a recently harvested field about 130 meters north of the Resaca de la
Palma crossing. It was 125 meters north of Trench 8 and 185 meters south of Trench 9. Placed near the
eastern edge of the right-of-way, the trench was 4.9 meters in length, 2.6 meters deep, and .9 meter wide.
It was oriented at 176 degrees. This trench was located at the southwestern corner of a roughly lenticular
pedon of Laredo-Reynosa complex, 0 to 1 percent slopes. Only two pedostratigraphic units were
recognized.
Zone 1 – 0 to 30 cm; brown (10YR4/3) fine sandy loam to loamy sand; weak, fine subangular
blocky structure tending to massive; roots, some pores; abrupt, wavy lower boundary; Ap
horizon.
Zone 2 – 30 to 260 cm; pale brown (10YR6/3) loamy fine sand; loose, massive, slightly moist;
slight texture variation top to bottom; discontinuous clay lenses some at angle - burrows
or alluvial structure; increasing fines at base; wet in final 40 to 50 cm.

The dominant feature of this profile is the loose loamy fine sandy layer that extends from the base
of the A horizon to the base of the trench. It does not really resemble either the Laredo or the Reynosa
components of the mapped complex though the Reynosa does have a layer of silt loam at 41 to 48 inches
(104 to 122 cm) and a fine sandy loam below 55 inches (139 cm). The loose, slightly coarser lower
sediments indicate near-channel deposition and suggest a point bar deposit within the meander of the
Resaca de la Palma. Although some of the original depositional characteristics are being destroyed by
active pedogenesis, traces of microstrata are clearly present. In general, this seems one of the more recent
soils of the area and indicates that the deposits here are clearly related to the extant Resaca de la Palma
channel rather than earlier depositional systems. The age of the deposits is not clear but could well be
within the historic era or the last centuries of the Late Prehistoric period. No evidence of stable surfaces
was observed, however, and no cultural materials were present in the trench. These loose fine sandy point
bar deposits are unlikely to have been a very attractive location for prehistoric settlement.
Trench 8
This trench was placed the closest to the Resaca de la Palma channel at the tree line east of the
center stake and oriented at 180 degrees (Figure 10). Only a few meters from what was marked as the
resaca channel on USGS and earlier maps, this area was apparently filled in at some time during the
recent past, perhaps when the nearby gas pipeline was built. The trench is only about 5 meters east of the
pipeline crossing, and lying at the extreme eastern edge of the right-of-way in this area. The southernmost
trench of the 2009 series, it was 125 meters south of Trench 7. Trench 8 was 5 meters in length, 1.6
meters deep and .9 meter wide. It lies within a broad area of Laredo silty clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes
that encompasses several smaller pedons of related soils. Five pedostratigraphic units were recognized.

subangular blocky structure; compact; some mixing from above and below; roots, no
pores; could be flood or artificial layer; clear, smooth lower boundary.
Zone 3 – 28 to 46 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR4/2) silty loam; weak, medium subangular
blocky structure; some carbonate threading and iron oxide, oxidized metal; tiny charcoal
flecks; fill layer; abrupt, smooth lower boundary; appears to be a modern fill layer.
Zone 4 – 46 to 70 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) silty clay loam; moderate, medium
subangular blocky structure; carbonate threading; larger charcoal pieces; modern clear
panel bottle glass shard; abrupt, smooth lower boundary; second modern fill layer.
Zone 5 – 70 to 160 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR4/2) silty clay; moderate to strong, fine
subangular blocky structure; very dry, hard; compact; no inclusions; apparent natural soil
layer below the layers of modern fill above – the original soil surface may have been
truncated; this dark clay may have been old channel fill though there is no evidence of
gleying or other wet soil characteristics.
Several fill layers were identified to a depth of 70 centimeters, likely from the construction of the
pipeline or the bridge over the Resaca de la Palma. A clear, modern glass bottle shard recovered from
Zone 4 was not saved. As noted above, the proximity of the lower clayey horizon to the original channel
suggests that it may be channel fill thought there are no obvious characteristics that would support that on
preliminary analysis. In any case, no stable surfaces were observed and no cultural materials were noted
other than the modern bottle glass.
Trench 9
Trench 9 was located 185 meters north of Trench 7 and 285 meters south of Trench 10. Oriented
at 176 degrees, the trench was 5 meters in length, 2.5 meters deep and .9 meter wide. It lies within an
arcuate-shaped pedon of Olmito silty clay. Four pedostratigraphic units were recognized.
Zone 1 – 0 to 30 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) clay loam; crumb structure trending to
weak, medium subangular blocky structure; fine roots; ; clear, wavy lower boundary; Ap
horizon.
Zone 2 – 30 to 100 cm; very dark gray (7.5YR3/1) heavy silty clay; weak to moderate, medium
subangular blocky structure; dense, compact; moist; gradual, smooth lower boundary;
possible upper B horizon.
Zone 3 – 100 to 150 cm; brown (10YR5/3) silty clay loam; weak, coarse subangular blocky
structure; some inclusions from above; zone of .5 to 1.5 cm size carbonate nodules at 125
to 140 cm; gradual, smooth lower boundary; possible Bca horizon but also related to
upward-fining depositional sequence.
Zone 4 – 150 to 215 cm; pale brown (10YR6/3) loamy silt; massive, moist with fine sand;
alluvially derived C horizon

This trench bears little resemblance to the typical profile of the Olmito silty clay that is mapped
here, but does show some relationship to Trench 7, 185 meters further south and closer to the channel. It
shows a typical fining-upward terrace sequence from a low-energy stream and as expected from its
location within the meander, it features generally finer sediments than the related Trench 7 (though with
little or none of the visible depositional characteristics that are visible in the latter trench. As with the
other trenches in this area , no evidence of stable surfaces was observed and no cultural material was
noted.
Trench 10
Trench 10 was located south of a field road separating the recently harvested field from a field of
sunflowers (Figure 11). It was 285 meters north of Trench 9 and 565 meters southwest of Trench 6. The
trench was oriented at 208 degrees along the centerline near the widest part of the curve in the harvested
field just south and west of the sunflower field. It was 5 meters in length, 1.75 meters deep and .9 meter
wide. The trench lies within an area mapped as Laredo silty clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes. Six
pedostratigraphic units were recognized.

Figure 11. Excavating Trench 10.
Zone 1 – 0 to 40 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR4/2) silty clay loam, silty loam at base; strong,
medium to coarse subangular blocky structure; common roots, darker with depth; some
mixing; clear, wavy lower boundary; Ap horizon grading to A.
Zone 2 – 40 to 60 cm; brown (10YR5/3) loamy silt; weak, coarse subangular blocky structure; no
roots or pores; lower boundary clear, smooth.

Zone 3 – 60 to 75 cm; grayish brown (10YR5/2) silty loam; moderate crumb structure; compact;
many carbonates at top, could be a paleosol; clayier than Zones 2 and 4; lower boundary
clear, smooth; possible B horizon.
Zone 4 – 75 to 110 cm; pale brown (10YR6/3) silt; massive; lower boundary gradual, smooth.
Zone 5 – 110 to 145 cm; pale yellowish brown (10YR6/2) silty loam; weak, fine to medium
subangular blocky structure; clayier than above; lower boundary gradual, smooth.
Zone 6 – 145 to 175 cm; grayish brown (10YR5/2) silty clay loam; moderate, fine subangular
blocky structure; clayier than above.
The sediments of this trench to bear some resemblance to the mapped Laredo silty clay loam, but
in general can be described as part of a fine point bar deposit with some evidence of short term stable
surfaces in Zones 3 and 6, though this in minimal and no cultural materials were observed and the layers
contained no charcoal or other evidence of a nearby occupation. This trench is not far from 41CF183,
recorded in the nearby pipeline survey by Kibler (2002). While there is no evidence of an archaeological
site in this trench, the potential stable surface could have offered a site for a short-term camp. Kibler
stated that this site, represented by only a single fragment of marine shell, was not a significant site, and
there si certainly not evidence that the site extends into this area as was noted in the surface survey of this
area by Brown et al. (2003).
R.E.C.L. Property
Trenches 11-13, and 16 were located along the center line on this property southeast of the large
bend in Resaca del Rancho Viejo where the proposed rail curves back eastward as it approaches its
eastern terminus. Most of the property was a recently harvested agricultural field. A single trench placed
at the extreme west end of the proposed access road near its closest approach to the Resaca del Rancho
Viejo channel in that area was also on property owned by the R.E.C.L. Limited Partnership.
Trench 11
Trench 11 was the closest excavated southeast of the Resaca del Rancho Viejo crossing, located
only about 10 meters from the resaca bank (Figure 12). It was 145 meters southeast of Trench 17 and 65
meters northwest of Trench 12. Oriented at 150 degrees, the trench was 5 meters in length, 2.1 meters
deep and .9 meter wide. It lies within an area mapped as Laredo silty clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes.
Nine pedostratigraphic units were recognized.
Zone 1 – 0 to 30 cm; very dark gray (10YR3/1) clay loam; strong, coarse subangular blocky
structure; compact; common fine to medium roots, strongly undulating abrupt lower
boundary; Ap horizon, obvious plow furrows present.
Zone 2 – 30 to 45 cm; pale brown (10YR6/3) silt; strong, coarse subangular blocky structure;
very compact; fine carbonate threading throughout; roots, clear, smooth lower boundary;
truncated calcic B horizon.
Zone 3 – 45 to 65 cm; brown (10YR5/3) silt loam, finer than above; massive; compact; roots,
pores; two carbonate bands up to 1 cm at top and bottom, carbonates present but less
common between the bands; possible weak Bca horizon.

Figure 12. Excavating Trench 11.
Zone 4 – 65 to 72 cm; brown (10YR5/3) loamy silt; massive; slightly compact; occasional
carbonate filaments and nodules, few roots.
Zone 5 – 72 to 90 cm; brown (10YR5/3) loamy silt; massive; slightly compact; same carbonates
as above but denser and up to 3 cm; silt lens at 76 to 79 cm.
Zone 6 – 90 to 100 cm; brown (10YR5/3) loamy silt; compact; occasional carbonates; massive.
Zone 7 – 100 to 115 cm; brown (7.5YR5/3) silty clay loam; strong to medium subangular blocky
structure; compact; carbonates almost as dense as Zone 5 and up to 3 cm, linear,
horizontal; possible soil formation.
Zone 8 – 115 to 135 cm; pale brown (10YR6/3) loamy silt; massive, loose; occasional carbonates
and filled pores.
Zone 9 – 135 to 210 cm; brown (10YR5/3) silty clay loam; moderate, medium subangular blocky
structure; many carbonates mostly from the top of zone to 160 cm, some linear up to 5
cm in length, some nodules 1 to 1.5 cm, occasional carbonates at 205 cm; filled pores;
becomes clayier turning to silty clay to base.
The sediments in this trench vaguely resemble the rather variable Laredo silt clay loam, but even
more clearly indicate a band of slightly coarser deposition along the margin of the resaca. As with
trenches along the Resaca de la Palma west of here, this trench clearly indicates that the deposition of
sediments in this trench are derived from the nearby resaca, which may have been active during the

historic era or the latter portions of the Late Prehistoric period. Several zones with carbonates may be old
surfaces though not technically paleosols. The depositional structures are well preserved and fairly young,
more so than perhaps any trench within the project area. One tiny plain whiteware sherd was noted on the
surface; this sherd was not collected. No cultural materials were noted in the trench itself.
Trench 12
Trench 12 was located 65 meters southeast of Trench 11 and about 70 meters northwest of Trench
13. Oriented at 140 degrees, it was 5.1 meters in length, 1.65 meters in depth, and .9 meter wide. Like the
nearby Trench 12, it lies within an area mapped as Laredo silty clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes. Five
pedostratigraphic units were recognized.
Zone 1 – 0 to 35 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) silty clay loam; strong, medium to
coarse subangular blocky structure; crumby; upper 15 cm (Ap) has large cracks and roots;
Ap/A horizon.
Zone 2 – 35 to 55 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR4/2) silty clay loam; weak, fine subangular
blocky to crumb structure; less clay and less compact than Zone 1; mixing from above
and below; few carbonates, worm casts.
Zone 3 - 55 to 75 cm; brown (10YR4/3) silty clay loam; moderate, fine subangular blocky
structure; darker than Zone 2 and more clay; carbonates .5 cm in size.
Zone 4 – 75 to 140 cm; brown (10YR4/3) deep, thick clay/clay loam; weak, medium to coarse
subangular blocky structure; dense carbonates up to 1 cm; clayier than Zone 3.
Zone 5 – 140 to 165 cm; brown (10YR4/3) clay; massive; sticky; plastic.
The sediments in this trench also resemble the mapped Laredo silty clay loam, but as with Trench
11, are first and foremost indicators of the deposition of slightly coarser sediments along the banks of the
resaca. Pedogenesis has removed many of the original depositional characteristics, but the sediments are
likely to be relatively young. No evidence of stable surfaces or cultural materials was observed.
Trench 13
Trench 13 was the south-easternmost of three trenches planed on the south bank of the Resaca del
Rancho Viejo, intended to give a better idea of the changes in sediments with distance from the bank. It
was about 70 meters southeast of Trench 12 and 360 meters northwest of Trench 16. The trench was
oriented at 134 degrees, 5.2 meters in length, 2 meters in depth and .9 meter wide. As with Trenches 11
and 12, it lies within an area mapped as Laredo silty clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes. Only two
pedostratigraphic units were recognized.
Zone 1 – 0 to 20 cm; very dark gray (10YR3/1) clay loam; weak crumb structure; very hard,
compact; roots; Ap horizon.
Zone 2 – 20 to 200 cm; dark brown (7.5YR3/2) massive clay; weak, coarse subangular blocky
structure; slight graduation from dark gray brown at top to reddish (dark brown 7.5YR4/2) at base; specks of carbonates at 100 cm, with occasional specks to 130 cm.
Though set at the outer extreme of the band of Laredo silty clay loam mapped along the bank of
the resaca, the sediments of this trench show little resemblance to that mapped unit, instead more closely

resembling the adjacent Harlingen clay. The clay appears to be an overbank terrace deposit of the resaca
but given the lack of any depositional characteristic could be a relict unit that pre-dates the two trenches
above. If it is related, it supports the characterization of these resacas as very low-energy distributary
channels, incapable of carrying coarser sediments and dropping fine clays only 150 meters from the
channel. As with the previous trench, no evidence of stable surfaces or cultural materials was observed.
Trench 16
This trench was located at the southeast corner of the R.E.C.L. property, 360 meters southeast of
Trench 13, 665 meters east-northeast of Trench 14 and 335 meters west of Trench 15. It was oriented at
276 degrees, was 5.2 meters in length, 2.25 meters in depth, and .9 meter wide. The trench is located
within an area mapped as Harlingen clay. Five pedostratigraphic units were recognized.
Zone 1 – 0 to 75 cm; dark gray (7.5YR4/1) clay/silty clay; massive; gleyed; leaching from
irrigation; gradual, smooth lower boundary; Ap/A horizon, plow zone weakly expressed
but more cracks present to about 20 cm.
Zone 2 – 75 to 115 cm; dark brown (7.5YR4/2) silty clay but not as silty as Zone 1; massive; tiny
carbonate flecks; possible weak B horizon.
Zone 3 – 115 to 125 cm; dark gray (7.5YR4/1) clay; massive; some undulation; no carbonates;
pedogenic development instead of depositional; also an apparent B horizon, this slightly
darker zone may have been a stable surface for a brief time during the deposition of this
sequence – it could also be the top of a second depositional sequence below the one
above.
Zone 4 – 125 to 165 cm; brown (7.5YR5/3) silty clay; massive; many carbonates up to 1 cm
common but not frequent; weak Bca horizon.
Zone 5 – 165 to 225 cm; brown (7.5YR5/3) loamy sand with strong brown (7.5YR5/6) mottling;
massive; few tiny manganese concretions; very moist with water at base; lower B
horizon.
This trench was excavated to sample an area within the field at a significantly greater distance
from the resaca. The clayey upper strata strongly support this view of overbank deposition at some
distance from the resaca channel, with some degree of pedogenic development represented by the
carbonates in Zone 4. Overall, the upper horizons are not dramatically different overall from the mapped
Harlingen clay, but the underlying loamy sand was unexpected and may represent point bar deposition
from a channel no longer clearly visible near here. The oxidation mottling indicates that this earlier
deposition is no recent, already suggested by the deep clays lying atop it. No stable surfaces were noted
and no cultural materials were observed in the trench.
Trench 14
This trench was located along the centerline at the far west end of the proposed new access road
(Figure 13). It was placed here for comparison with the trenches described above and for its proximity to
the resaca channel. It was located 480 meters southwest of Trench 11, 585 meters south of Trench 18, and
665 meters west-southwest of Trench 16. The trench was oriented at 76 degrees and was 5.4 meters in
length, 1.85 meters in depth, and .9 meter wide. The area around this trench was mapped as Olmito silty
clay. Three pedostratigraphic units were recognized.

Figure 13. Excavating Trench 14.
Zone 1 – 0 to 45 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) silty clay loam; strong, medium
subangular blocky structure, vertical cracks present; lower part of A (below ca. 20 cm)
massive; cracked; porous; crumby at top; gradual straight lower boundary; A horizon,
upper 20 cm an undifferentiated Ap horizon.
Zone 2 – 45 to 110 cm; brown (7.5YR5/3) clay loam; moderate, medium subangular blocky
structure; very compact; carbonates from specks at top to dense, 2 cm-size in bottom 20
cm; gradual boundary; apparent Bca horizon.
Zone 3 – 110 to 185 cm; brown (7.5YR5/3) moist, compact silty clay loam; moderate, fine
subangular blocky structure; slight yellow oxidation mottling; older B horizon or
minimally modified C horizon.
This trench was excavated at the closest point of approach of the proposed new access road to the
more southerly curve of the Resaca del Rancho Viejo. At about 185 meters from the channel bank, it is no
surprise that it exhibits clayey sediments, not unlike Trench 13 above, but Trench 14 has slightly coarser
sediments and greater pedogenic development. In particular, the intense carbonates at the based of Zone 2
suggest a greater age of deposition. It is possible that the point of Olmito silty clay in the core of the
meander could be a relict deposit but further investigations would be necessary. In any case, no buried
surfaces were noted and no cultural materials were observed.

Garza and Myers Property
A single trench was located at the southeast corner of the above property, once the location of a
house as depicted on the 1936 USGS. This section is under tall grasses. No sign of the homestead was
observed but a great quantity of trash was noted along the berms and sides of the roads in this location.
The location was also chosen to compare with the trenches on the R.E.C.L. property.
Trench 15
The easternmost of the trenches excavated in the 2009 investigations, this trench was located
about 335 meters east of Trench 16 (Figure 14). It was located near the site of an apparent formerly
standing structure (from the 1936 USGS topo map) that was also sampled in Shovel Tests 1 and 2 (see
above). The trench was oriented at 266 degrees, was 6.1 meters in length, 1.65 meters in depth, and .9
meter wide. It lies on a band mapped as Benito clay. Only two pedostratigraphic units were recognized.
Zone 1 – 0 to 125 cm; dark gray (10YR4/1) clay; massive; moist; gleyed; sticky; plastic; some
cracks at top; gradual, smooth lower boundary; no clear plow zone, apparent A/C horizon.
Zone 2 – 125 to 165 cm; reddish brown (5YR5/3) clay loam/silty clay loam; moist; oxidized;
small carbonate flecks and tiny nodules at base’ possible old B horizon?

Figure 14. Trench 15 area.
Though a relatively undifferentiated gray clay, not completely unlike the A11 and A22 horizons
of the typical profile of Benito clay, its reddish brown lower horizon shows greater oxidation than
expected. It may represent, at least in part, an older alluvial unit formed by overbank deposition at an

earlier time, capped by finer overbank sedimentation from the more recent, visible resacas. No stable
surfaces were observed and no evidence of cultural materials was noted. In particular, no evidence was
observed that would suggest the presence of the historic building mapped nearby on the 1936 map.
Wentz Property
Three trenches were located on this heavily wooded and brushy property, two in close proximity
to the Resaca del Rancho Viejo. Trenches 17 was along the north edge of the right-of-way due to heavy
brush while Trench 18 was placed as close to the centerline as brush would allow. Trench 19 was located
about 5 meters south of the actual centerline because of the presence of a gas line and a fence in that area.
It was still well within the right-of-way.
Trench 17
This trench was placed in an open area interspersed with huisache in closest proximity to the
resaca (Figure 15). It was about 10 meters from the bank of the resaca, 140 meters northwest of Trench 11
and 50 meters southeast of Trench 18. The trench was oriented at 342 degrees, was 5.9 meters in length,
1.35 meters in depth, and .9 meter wide. The area around this trench was mapped as Laredo silty clay
loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes. Four pedostratigraphic units were recognized.

Figure 15. Excavating Trench 17.
Zone 1 – 0 to 55 cm; very dark gray (10YR3/1) clay; fine, strong, subangular blocky structure;
hard; slickensides, clay skins on peds; many fine roots to 40 cm; lower boundary clear,
smooth; A horizon, separate plow zone unrecognizable.

CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY — CAMERON COUNTY WEST RAIL BYPASS

Anthony & Brown Consulting
Zone 2 – 55 to 70 cm; dark brown (7.5YR4/3) loam/clay loam; moderate, fine subangular blocky
structure; very compact; lower boundary clear, smooth; transitional zone with mixing.
Zone 3 – 70 to 95 cm; very pale brown (10YR7/3) silt; massive; lightly compacted; carbonates
dense at base; gradual, smooth lower boundary.
Zone 4 – 95 to 135 cm; brown (7.5YR5/3) clay loam; massive; very compact; some carbonates.
The clays in the upper portion of this trench were among the most compact of any tested on the
project. Somewhat like the Laredo silty clay loam mapped on both banks of the resaca, this trench near
the bank of the resaca shows few primary depositional characteristics, and extensive carbonate
development. It could be an older deposit than Trenches 11 and 12 on the opposite bank. In conjunction
with the nearby Trench 18, it appears that this point bar deposit was in construction around the time this
channel was abandoned and the clayey upper sediments may have been deposited after than
abandonment. The underlying clay loam could be a stable surface or an earlier depositional unit; but lacks
characteristics that would identify it clearly as a paleosol. No cultural materials were observed in the
trench.
Trench 18
This trench was located 50 meters northwest of Trench 17 and 400 meters southeast of Trench 19.
At an orientation of 302 degrees, it was 5 meters in length, 2.05 meters in depth, and .9 meter wide. As
with Trench 17, the area around this trench was mapped as Laredo silty clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes.
Four pedostratigraphic units were recognized.
Zone 1 – 0 to 22 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) clay; strong, coarse subangular blocky
structure; vertical cracks, many fine to medium roots, clear, wavy lower boundary; A
horizon.
Zone 2 – 22 to 38 cm; dark brown (10YR3/3) clay loam; moderate crumb structure; transition
between Zones 1 and 3.
Zone 3 – 38 to 90 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR6/4) very fine sand; massive; slightly
compact; moist; light traces of oxidization; few fine roots.
Zone 4 – 90 to 205 cm; very pale brown (10YR7/3) very fine sand/silty sand; not oxidized;
compacted at top; carbonates at top.
The sediments observed in this trench seem only vaguely related to the mapped Laredo silty clay
loam, but do make sense in the depositional scenario likely for this area along the resaca banks. The fine
sand in the bottom two zones is a likely point bar deposit, while the upper clayey deposits may have been
deposited after abandonment of the resaca, not unlike that suggested for the nearby Trench 17. No
evidence of the clay loam underlying the sediments of Trench 17 was noted here, however. In any case,
no stable surfaces were noted and no cultural materials were observed in the trench.
Trench 19
This was the last trench excavated and was placed some distance from the resaca to sample the
area between trenches 5 and 18 (Figure 16). It was about 400 meters northwest of Trench 18 and 700
meters east of Trench 5. The trench was oriented at 298 degrees and was 5 meters in length, 1.75 meters
in depth, and .9 meter wide. This trench was mapped at the western edge of a larger pedon of Laredo silty

clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes, just near its boundary with an area of Laredo-Olmito complex. Five
pedostratigraphic units were recognized.

Figure 16. Recording Trench 19.
Zone 1 – 0 to 15 cm; dark brown (7.5YR3/2) clay loam; strong, coarse subangular blocky
structure; compact; hard, plastic; vertical cracks; shallow A horizon.
Zone 2 – 15 to 55 cm; dark brown (7.5YR4/3) clay; massive; moist; broad transitional zone.
Zone 3 – 55 to 120 cm; brown (7.5YR5/3) clay, massive; moist; purer, redder than above.
Zone 4 – 120 to 160 cm; brown (7.5YR4/4) clay; massive; sticky; some carbonates at top.
Zone 5 – 160 to 175 cm; dark brown (7.5YR4/3) clay loam; weak crumb structure to massive;
compact; red oxidation mottling; no carbonates.
The heavy clays in this trench are completely unlike the Laredo silty clay loam that is mapped
here nor are they much like even the clayey Olmito silty clay component of the Laredo-Olmito complex
mapped just to the west. Instead, they strongly resemble the Harlingen clay pedon that is mapped about
300 meters west. They are overbank terrace deposits with few primary depositional characteristics
present, and relatively few carbonates. No stable surfaces were noted and no cultural materials were
observed in the trench.

Trenching Discussion
Backhoe trenching for the proposed West Rail Bypass found no evidence of buried prehistoric or
historic archaeological materials. A single shard of modern clear bottle glass found in a fill layer
associated with pipeline construction across the Resaca de la Palma on the Ortiz property (in Trench 8)
was the only cultural find from the trenches. A single sherd of whiteware found on the surface near
Trench 11 on the south bank of the Resaca del Rancho Viejo was the only legitimate cultural material
observed during the trenching phase. A cursory examination of the surface in this area revealed no other
cultural materials but this sherd is possible related to a building marked to the north of the pipeline on
earlier maps of the area. No evidence of a historic occupation (other than the plow zone) was noted in that
trench and the area was not recorded as a cultural resource site.
Overall, about half of the trenches roughly matched soils mapped in those areas though most
could hardly be called typical profiles. A few other trenches seemed to approximately match nearby
mapped soils, suggesting the mapping boundaries were slightly off. Other soils bore no resemblance
whatsoever to the mapped units.
For the most part, trenches excavated nearer the resaca channels tended to exhibit coarser
sediments and almost certainly were deposited by those resacas. The paucity of primary depositional
characteristics in most of these suggest that the resacas are no longer active sources of deposition and may
not have been for several centuries. In most of these cases, however, it is possible that these resacas were
active early in the historic era or during the last millennium of the Late Prehistoric period. The absence of
coarser sandy deposits among these near channel trenches suggests that these resacas were relatively
slow-moving distributary channels. In most cases, even the siltier deposits were limited to areas within
100 to 150 meters from the channels; more distant trenches were typically dominated by clay loams and
clays, supporting the idea that these distributaries were relatively low energy depositional systems.
Nonetheless, while a few of the mapped soils are described as saline, and some show dark gray clays and
gleyed deposits, there is little evidence to support the presence of extensive tidal flats as observed
underlying alluvial sediments in a survey conducted by the authors downstream of Brownsville along the
Rio Grande (Brown et al. 2002).
While a few apparent stable surfaces were noted in the trench profiles, no true paleosols were
noted, and none of these showed any evidence that might suggest a cultural occupation. In general,
neither the loose silty deposits nor the clayier terrace and backswamp deposits were probably attractive
locales for human settlement, though nothing observed precludes the possibility of occupation sites in the
general area. Slight topographic highs and low relict landforms could be present, some totally hidden by
more recent sedimentation. While sites have only rarely been recorded in this general area, and no clear
evidence for high probability environments for archaeological site locations was noted in the survey, there
is insufficient evidence to suggest that such sites cannot be present and that all surveys though this
general area should be abandoned. Instead, each project should continue to be evaluated on a case by case
basis.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Intensive, 100 percent pedestrian archaeological survey of the proposed West Rail Bypass,
accompanied by 11 shovel tests and 19 backhoe trenches did not locate any cultural resources, a similar
finding for many surveys in this general area. As noted in the Survey Methods section above, this Late
Holocene distributary environment, perhaps marshy and saline at times, seems to have been relatively
unattractive for longer-term settlement by native peoples. While low sandy knolls and other relict
landforms will continue to be high probability areas for cultural resource sites, none were observed within
the project area and no evidence was noted of areas were such landforms could have been leveled in the
past. The few twentieth-century occupations mapped near the right-of-way yielded no physical evidence
and may have been ephemeral, or actually located at some distance from the actual right-of-way. Further
archival research being conducted by GTI may pinpoint other locations, but the evidence from surface
materials is scant to non-existent. Historic occupations prior to the twentieth century are possible but
could be shallowly buried by early Rio Grande flooding or hurricane storm surge deposits. Given the
heavy clays of the project area, such hypothetical occupations, if they existed at all, would be extremely
difficult to find.
The previous Anthony & Brown archaeological survey of the southwestern leg of the proposed
West Rail Bypass (Brown et al. 2003) found no significant cultural resource sites in that right-of-way and
recommended clearance for construction. That report noted the presence of an artifact scatter and possible
buried foundations of the Carmen Ranch House just a few hundred meters west of the proposed
international crossing. Though never formally recorded as an archaeological site and well outside the
current right-of-way, we note that if plans change for ancillary facilities and this area is impacted, this
extremely important cultural resource site could be damaged. We suggest that this important site be
evaluated and its boundaries be delimited as part of the bridge and ancillary facilities permitting process
so that it can be properly protected if deemed significant.
Given the findings of the current archaeological survey, we conclude that construction of the
West Rail Bypass as designed is highly unlikely to impact significant cultural resources and we suggest
that construction be allowed to proceed without further cultural resource consultation pending the
outcome of the concurrent archival and historic structures survey. As with any archaeological project,
especially those located in alluvial sediments, previously unknown cultural resources sites could be
encountered during construction. Should such a site be located, work in that area should be suspended and
TxDOT and the THC should be contacted as soon as possible.
