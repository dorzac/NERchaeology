Cultural Resources Assessment of USACE Jurisdictional Areas and TMPA Property on the Proposed
East Houston to Hearne Pipeline Right-of-Way, Grimes, Brazos, and Robertson Counties, Texas

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) was selected by Zephyr Environmental
Corporation (Zephyr) on behalf of Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. (Magellan) to conduct a
cultural resources inventory and assessment of the proposed East Houston to Hearne Pipeline
right-of-way (ROW). The proposed undertaking would involve the construction of a pipeline
extending from an existing Magellan facility located near the intersection of Interstate Highway
(IH) 610 and Liberty Road in Houston, Harris County, Texas, to an existing facility located off the
northeastern side of US Highway (US) 190 in Hearne, Robertson County, Texas. Overall, the
proposed project corridor extends a total distance of approximately 207.6 kilometers (129.0 miles)
across Harris, Waller, Grimes, Brazos, and Robertson counties, Texas. This report documents
the results of cultural resources survey activities undertaken within Grimes, Brazos, and
Robertson counties, which constitute the segment of the overall project corridor that falls under
the jurisdiction of the US Army Corps of Engineers’ (USACE) Fort Worth District. This segment
of the project area extends a total linear distance of approximately 107.8 kilometers (67.0 miles)
and measures 30.5 meters (100.0 feet) in width. The cultural resources survey of the segment of
the project corridor that traverses Harris and Waller counties, which falls under the jurisdiction of
the USACE’s Galveston District, has been prepared under separate cover.
The proposed project is being sponsored by Magellan, a privately owned oil and gas
developer, and the vast majority of the segment of the proposed project corridor in Grimes,
Brazos, and Robertson counties is located on privately owned land. However, construction within
the proposed ROW near features that meet the criteria for designation as “waters of the US”
(WOUS) is subject to federal permitting by the USACE, Fort Worth District, under Section 404 of
the Clean Water Act (CWA) and/or Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act. Those portions of
the project area that fall under federal jurisdiction would also fall under the jurisdiction of
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended (16 USC §
470, et seq.); the Historic Sites Act (16 USC § 471, et seq.); the Archaeological and Historic
Preservation Act (16 USC § 469, et seq.); and Executive Order 11593, “Protection and
Enhancement of the Cultural Environment”; among others. These statutes are invoked when
federal funds are utilized or when federal licenses or permits are required for a proposed
undertaking. The NHPA states that the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) and
the Texas Historical Commission (THC), which serves as Texas’ State Historic Preservation
Office (SHPO), must be afforded the opportunity to comment when any historic properties eligible

H146-170124

for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) are present in a project area
affected by federal agency actions or covered under federal permits or funding.
In addition, approximately 4.2 kilometers (2.6 miles) of the proposed ROW in Grimes
County traverses property owned and operated by the Texas Municipal Power Agency (TMPA).
The TMPA is a public utility that operates as a non-profit municipality; as such, it constitutes a
political subdivision of the state of Texas, and the portion of the proposed ROW located on TMPA
property therefore falls under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of Texas. The cultural
resources survey of the segment of the proposed ROW on TMPA lands was conducted under
Texas Antiquities Permit no. 8304.
For purposes of the cultural resources survey, the federal Area of Potential Effect (APE)
consists of the proposed construction footprint, including permanent and temporary easements
and workspaces, within those portions of the overall proposed ROW subject to federal jurisdiction.
Following current USACE guidance, the APE consists of the channel, banks, and adjacent
uplands associated with USACE jurisdictional features within the proposed ROW. As delineated
by project biologists, 208 USACE jurisdictional features were identified within the proposed ROW
in Grimes, Brazos, and Robertson counties, including 15 perennial streams, 42 intermittent
streams, 48 ephemeral streams, 22 palustrine forested wetlands, 61 palustrine emergent
wetlands, five scrub shrub wetlands, and 15 ponds. While the permit area ultimately will be
determined by the USACE, archaeological survey areas associated with USACE jurisdictional
features are typically considered to include the banks and associated uplands extending
approximately 91.5 meters (300.0 feet) from the defined banks or edges of the feature, though
the USACE may extend the permit area farther. The proposed ROW consists of a linear corridor
measuring 30.5 meters (100.0 feet) in width. Thus, the APE associated with each jurisdictional
feature would measure a minimum of approximately 182.9 meters (600.0 feet) in length by
30.5 meters (100.0 feet) in width, covering an area of 0.6 hectare (1.4 acres). Horizon extended
many of the survey buffers beyond the typical 91.5-meter (300.0-foot) buffer on one or both sides
of jurisdictional features. Accounting for extended survey buffers and overlapping survey areas
surrounding adjacent jurisdictional features, the survey buffers surrounding the 208 USACE
jurisdictional features that constitute the APE collectively extend a total linear distance of
46.2 kilometers (28.7 miles) within the 30.5-meter- (100.0-foot-) wide proposed ROW, covering a
total area of 141.2 hectares (348.8 acres). The vertical depth of impacts across the majority of
the proposed pipeline would be 2.1 meters (7.0 feet) below surface, which would be the depth of
the open-cut pipeline trench (allowing for installation of a 50.8-centimeter- [20.0-inch-] diameter
pipe with 1.2 meters [4.0 feet] of overlying fill).
In addition, projects that fall under federal oversight must take into account the APE for
indirect effects, which considers possible viewshed effects on historic properties located within
line of sight of aboveground project facilities. The APE for indirect effects typically includes
parcels located adjacent to the proposed construction footprint but may extend farther depending
on the height of aboveground facilities. The proposed undertaking primarily involves installation
of a subsurface pipeline. In addition, one surface valve site would be constructed, but this would
have a minimal aboveground footprint and there would be no net viewshed impacts to any historic
properties in the surrounding area. As such, for purposes of the cultural resources survey, the

vi

East Houston to Hearne Pipeline Right-of-Way, Grimes, Brazos, and Robertson Counties, Texas

APE was defined based only on direct impacts from construction and operation of the proposed
pipeline facilities and was not expanded due to indirect impacts resulting from viewshed effects.
In addition to the federal APE described above, the entire segment of the ROW located
on TMPA property (i.e., state land) in Grimes County falls under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities
Code of Texas. This segment of the project area would measure 4.2 kilometers (2.6 miles) in
length by 30.5 meters (100.0 feet) in width and would cover an area of approximately
12.7 hectares (31.5 acres). The segment of the proposed ROW located on TMPA property
includes numerous USACE jurisdictional areas, so there is substantial overlap between federal
and state jurisdiction within this segment of the proposed ROW.
Prior to the initiation of cultural resources survey fieldwork, Magellan proactively engaged
in preliminary consultation with several federally recognized Tribes in the state of Texas to solicit
their comments regarding the proposed undertaking. The Tribes requested that the cultural
resources survey be expanded beyond the typical USACE jurisdictional survey buffers to include
100% of the proposed project corridor. At Magellan’s request, Horizon therefore conducted an
intensive 100% cultural resources survey of the entire ROW in Grimes, Brazos, and Robertson
counties, including USACE jurisdictional areas as well as intervening areas not subject to
regulatory jurisdiction. The 4.2-kilometer- (2.6-mile-) long segment of proposed ROW located on
TMPA property that falls under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of Texas required an
intensive 100% survey regardless of the extent of federal jurisdiction. This report describes the
results of the cultural resources survey conducted for Magellan’s proposed East Houston to
Hearne Project in Grimes, Brazos, and Robertson counties, including all cultural resources
recorded during the survey (including those found in portions of the overall proposed ROW that
are currently considered not to fall under any regulatory jurisdiction). In the interest of meeting
an ambitious reporting schedule, however, shovel testing data presented in this report are limited
to those portions of the ROW that fall within areas currently considered to be subject to federal
and/or state regulation.
Between November 1, 2017, and April 11, 2018, Horizon archeologists Charles Bludau,
Foster Duncan, Benjamin Johnson, Jacob Lyons, Benjamin Morton, Briana N. Smith, and Jared
Wiersema performed an intensive cultural resources survey of the Grimes, Brazos, and
Robertson counties segment of the proposed East Houston to Hearne Pipeline Project’s ROW to
locate any cultural resources that potentially would be impacted by the proposed undertaking.
Archeological field crews generally consisted of two members, though a third person was
sometimes added to a crew if an odd number of archeologists were deployed at the time. The
project’s Principal Investigator, Jeffrey D. Owens, performed a brief reconnaissance survey at the
beginning of the project to examine the range of environments and landforms that characterize
the project area and conducted field inspections of all archeological sites recorded during the
survey; as such, the Principal Investigator was in the field for approximately 25% of the duration
of field survey activities, typically from one to two days per week. Following completion of the
pedestrian survey with shovel testing, Horizon archeologists Foster Duncan, Jacob Lyons, Jared
Wiersema, and Rachel Naasz returned to the field from September 20 to October 6, 2018, to
conduct supplemental mechanical deep testing using a backhoe at nine streams that fall within
the USACE permit area that were considered to possess the potential to contain archeological

deposits at depths greater than shovel testing was capable of reaching during initial survey
activities.
Horizon’s archeologists traversed the centerline of the proposed ROW and thoroughly
inspected the modern ground surface for aboriginal and historic-age cultural resources. In
addition to pedestrian walkover and surface inspection, for linear surveys, the Texas State
Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per
1.6 kilometers (1.0 miles) for each 30.5-meter- (100.0-foot-) wide transect unless field conditions
warrant more shovel tests (e.g., in cultural high-probability areas) or fewer shovel tests (e.g., on
steep slopes, in areas with excellent ground surface visibility, in heavily disturbed areas). The
federal APE for the proposed project measures 46.2 kilometers (28.7 miles) in length by
30.5 meters (100.0 feet) in width; as such, 459 shovel tests would be required in order to meet
the TSMASS requirements. Horizon excavated a total of 1,052 shovel tests and 29 backhoe
trenches within USACE jurisdictional buffers during the survey; as such, the TSMASS
requirements were exceeded for an APE of this length. Furthermore, within the 4.2-kilometer(2.6-mile-) long segment of proposed ROW located on TMPA property, 42 shovel tests would be
required in order to meet the TSMASS requirements. Horizon excavated 103 shovel tests on
TMPA property, thereby exceeding the TSMASS requirements for a project area of this length.
Shovel tests were excavated at approximately 100.0-meter (328.1-foot-) intervals, though
intervals were tightened to 30.0- to 50.0-meter (98.4- to 164.0-foot) intervals within areas with a
higher potential for subsurface cultural resources, such as stream terraces or areas near
previously recorded archeological sites. A minimum of three shovel tests were excavated within
the survey area buffers on either side of each USACE jurisdictional area whenever possible. In
some cases, one or both sides of a jurisdictional area could not be shovel tested due to the
presence of large pools of standing water or the presence of built features that precluded shovel
testing, such as road and highway pavement, parking lots, gravel pits, and equipment yards.
Backhoe trenches were excavated at comparable intervals adjacent to selected streams, typically
consisting of two to three trenches on either side of the stream.
A total of 16 archeological sites and one historic-age engineering feature, a mid-20thcentury bridge eponymously designated as the Little Wickson Creek Tributary Bridge (which was
not recorded as an archeological site), were documented as a result of the cultural resources
survey of Magellan’s proposed East Houston to Hearne Pipeline ROW in Grimes, Brazos, and
Robertson counties. Of the total of 17 cultural resources (16 archeological sites plus the historicage bridge), 11 resources are located in Grimes County, four resources are located in Brazos
County, and two resources are located in Robertson County. Four of the 16 archeological sites
(41GM28, 41GM118, 41GM264, and 41RT129) are previously recorded sites that were revisited
during the current survey, and the remaining 12 archeological sites (41GM479-486, 41BZ180182, and 41RT610) plus the Little Wickson Creek Tributary Bridge are newly recorded cultural
resources discovered during the current survey. Aboriginal cultural components consisting of
surface and/or subsurface scatters of lithic and/or ceramic artifacts were recorded on 12 of the
archeological sites, including three sites with Early Ceramic to Late Prehistoric period components
and nine sites with undetermined prehistoric components. Historic-age components dating from
the late 19th to late 20th centuries were observed on seven of the archeological sites, and the

East Houston to Hearne Pipeline Right-of-Way, Grimes, Brazos, and Robertson Counties, Texas

Little Wickson Creek Tributary Bridge dates to the mid-20th century. Three of the archeological
sites are multiple-component sites containing both aboriginal and historic-age cultural
components.
A total of 12 cultural resources, including 11 of the 16 archeological sites and the historicage bridge (41GM28, 41GM118, 41GM264, 41GM481, 41GM482, 41GM484, 41GM485,
41GM486, 41BZ181, 41BZ182, 41RT129, and the Little Wickson Creek Tributary Bridge), fall
within portions of the proposed ROW that are currently considered to be subject to state and/or
federal regulatory jurisdiction. Eleven of these 12 cultural resources (41GM28, 41GM264,
41GM481, 41GM482, 41GM484, 41GM485, 41GM486, 41BZ181, 41BZ182, 41RT129, and the
Little Wickson Creek Tributary Bridge) fall within jurisdictional buffers surrounding WOUSs that
are subject to USACE permitting; as such, these 11 resources fall under the jurisdiction of
Section 106 of the NHPA. Three of these 12 cultural resources (41GM118, 41GM481, and
41GM482) are located on property owned and operated by the TMPA; as such, these three sites
fall under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of Texas.
Based on the results of Horizon’s investigations, 10 of the 16 archeological sites
(41GM479, 41GM480, 41GM482, 41GM483, 41GM484, 41GM485, 41GM486, 41BZ180,
41BZ182, and 41RT129) and the Little Wickson Creek Tributary Bridge are recommended either
as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP as a whole or as non-contributing to the overall eligibility
of a larger site for inclusion in the NRHP (i.e., not eligible within the investigated ROW). Site
41GM482 is further recommended as not eligible for designation as an SAL. No further work is
warranted within the proposed ROW on these sites regardless of construction method.
The remaining six archeological sites (41GM28, 41GM118, 41GM264, 41GM481,
41BZ181, and 41RT610) are recommended to be of undetermined eligibility for inclusion in the
NRHP, and sites 41GM118 and 41GM481 are further recommended to be of undetermined
eligibility for designation as SALs. Five of these six sites (41GM28, 41GM118, 41GM264,
41GM481, and 41BZ181) fall within portions of the proposed ROW currently considered to be
subject to federal and/or state regulatory jurisdiction. Four of these five sites (41GM28, 41GM264,
41GM481, and 41BZ181) are located within jurisdictional survey buffers surrounding WOUSs
potentially subject to permitting by the USACE, and sites 41GM118 and 41GM481 are located on
TMPA property and therefore fall under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of Texas.
Site 41GM118 was originally located within the proposed ROW within a USACE
jurisdictional area; however, the proposed ROW has been rerouted at this location, and site
41GM118 no longer falls within the APE of the proposed undertaking. Site 41BZ181 is not located
directly within the proposed pipeline centerline or permanent workspace, but rather just barely
encroaches within an area of temporary workspace. Magellan proposes to avoid impacts to site
41BZ181 by establishing a 15.2-meter (50.0-foot) avoidance buffer surrounding the site
boundaries within which no construction-related activities would occur. Magellan proposes to
avoid impacts to the remaining three sites of undetermined eligibility—41GM28, 41GM264, and
41GM481—by installing the pipeline underneath the documented site locations via horizontal
directional drill (HDD) or conventional bore and avoiding any other surficial ground-disturbing
impacts within the boundaries of these sites. As such, it is Horizon’s recommendation that no
additional cultural resources investigations are warranted on these five sites in connection with

H146-170124

ix

Management Summary

the proposed undertaking. In the event that ground disturbances on the sites are unavoidable,
additional significance testing would be needed to fully determine the eligibility of the sites for
inclusion in the NRHP and/or for designation as SALs, as appropriate.
The remaining archeological site recommended as being of undetermined eligibility for
inclusion in the NRHP, 41RT610, does not fall within a portion of the proposed ROW currently
considered to be subject to regulatory jurisdiction; as such, no further work is warranted on this
site in connection with the proposed undertaking regardless of construction method.
Horizon employed a non-collection policy for cultural resources during the survey.
Diagnostic artifacts (e.g., projectile points, ceramics, historic materials with maker’s marks) and
non-diagnostic artifacts (e.g., lithic debitage, burned rock, historic glass, and metal scrap) were
described, sketched, and/or photo-documented in the field and replaced in the same location in
which they were found. No cultural resources were collected from either public or private lands
during the survey. Upon completion of the project, all project records pertaining to the portion of
the overall project area located on state land (i.e., TMPA property) will be permanently curated at
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL).
Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
significant cultural resources would be adversely affected by the proposed undertaking. In
accordance with 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable
and good-faith effort to identify historic properties within the APE. As currently designed, it is
recommended that the proposed project would have no effect on historic properties in accordance
with 36 CFR 60.4 and 13 TAC 26, and no further cultural resources investigations are
recommended in connection with the proposed undertaking. However, it should be noted that
human burials, both historic-age and prehistoric, are protected under the Texas Health and Safety
Code. In the event that any human remains or burial objects are inadvertently discovered at any
point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance in the project area, even in previously
surveyed areas, all work should cease immediately at the location of the inadvertent discovery
until a qualified archaeologist can assess the find, and the THC should be notified of the discovery.

Cultural Resources Assessment of USACE Jurisdictional Areas and TMPA Property on the Proposed
East Houston to Hearne Pipeline Right-of-Way, Grimes, Brazos, and Robertson Counties, Texas

1.0 INTRODUCTION

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) was selected by Zephyr Environmental
Corporation (Zephyr) on behalf of Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. (Magellan) to conduct a
cultural resources inventory and assessment of the proposed East Houston to Hearne Pipeline
right-of-way (ROW). The proposed undertaking would involve the construction of a pipeline
extending from an existing Magellan facility located near the intersection of Interstate Highway
(IH) 610 and Liberty Road in Houston, Harris County, Texas, to an existing facility located off the
northeastern side of US Highway (US) 190 in Hearne, Robertson County, Texas. Overall, the
proposed project corridor extends a total distance of approximately 207.6 kilometers (129.0 miles)
across Harris, Waller, Grimes, Brazos, and Robertson counties, Texas (Figures 1-1 to 1-3). This
report documents the results of cultural resources survey activities undertaken within Grimes,
Brazos, and Robertson counties, which constitute the segment of the overall project corridor that
falls under the jurisdiction of the US Army Corps of Engineers’ (USACE) Fort Worth District. This
segment of the project area extends a total linear distance of approximately 107.8 kilometers
(67.0 miles) and measures 30.5 meters (100.0 feet) in width. The cultural resources survey of
the segment of the project corridor that traverses Harris and Waller counties, which falls under
the jurisdiction of the USACE’s Galveston District, has been prepared under separate cover.
The proposed project is being sponsored by Magellan, a privately owned oil and gas
developer, and the vast majority of the segment of the proposed project corridor in Grimes,
Brazos, and Robertson counties is located on privately owned land. However, construction within
the proposed ROW near features that meet the criteria for designation as “waters of the US”
(WOUS) is subject to federal permitting by the USACE Fort Worth District under Section 404 of
the Clean Water Act (CWA) and/or Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act. Those portions of
the project area that fall under federal jurisdiction would also fall under the jurisdiction of
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended (16 USC §
470, et seq.); the Historic Sites Act (16 USC § 471, et seq.); the Archaeological and Historic
Preservation Act (16 USC § 469, et seq.); and Executive Order 11593, “Protection and
Enhancement of the Cultural Environment”; among others. These statutes are invoked when
federal funds are utilized or when federal licenses or permits are required for a proposed
undertaking. The NHPA states that the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) and
the Texas Historical Commission (THC), which serves as Texas’ State Historic Preservation
Office (SHPO), must be afforded the opportunity to comment when any historic properties eligible

for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) are present in a project area
affected by federal agency actions or covered under federal permits or funding.
In addition, approximately 4.2 kilometers (2.6 miles) of the proposed ROW in Grimes
County traverses property owned and operated by the Texas Municipal Power Agency (TMPA).
The TMPA is a public utility that operates as a non-profit municipality; as such, it constitutes a
political subdivision of the state of Texas, and the portion of the proposed ROW located on TMPA
property additionally falls under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of Texas. The cultural
resources survey of the portion of the proposed ROW on TMPA lands was conducted under Texas
Antiquities Permit no. 8304.
For purposes of the cultural resources survey, the federal Area of Potential Effect (APE)
consists of the proposed construction footprint, including permanent and temporary easements
and workspaces, within those portions of the overall proposed ROW subject to federal jurisdiction.
Following current USACE guidance, the APE consists of the channel, banks, and adjacent
uplands associated with USACE jurisdictional features within the proposed ROW. As delineated
by project biologists, 208 USACE jurisdictional features were identified within the proposed ROW
in Grimes, Brazos, and Robertson counties, including 15 perennial streams, 42 intermittent
streams, 48 ephemeral streams, 23 palustrine forested wetlands, 60 palustrine emergent
wetlands, five scrub shrub wetlands, and 15 ponds. While the permit area ultimately will be
determined by the USACE, archaeological survey areas associated with USACE jurisdictional
features are typically considered to include the banks and associated uplands extending
approximately 91.5 meters (300.0 feet) from the defined banks or edges of the feature, though
the USACE may extend them farther. The proposed ROW consists of a linear corridor measuring
30.5 meters (100.0 feet) in width. Thus, the APE associated with each jurisdictional feature would
measure a minimum of approximately 182.9 meters (600.0 feet) in length by 30.5 meters
(100.0 feet) in width, covering an area of 0.6 hectare (1.4 acres). Horizon extended many of the
survey buffers beyond the typical 91.5-meter (300.0-foot) buffer on one or both sides of
jurisdictional features. Accounting for extended survey buffers and overlapping survey areas
surrounding adjacent jurisdictional features, the survey buffers surrounding the 208 USACE
jurisdictional features that constitute the APE collectively extend a total linear distance of
46.2 kilometers (28.7 miles) within the 30.5-meter- (100.0-foot-) wide proposed ROW, covering a
total area of 141.2 hectares (348.8 acres). The vertical depth of impacts across the majority of
the proposed pipeline would be 2.1 meters (7.0 feet) below surface, which would be the depth of
the open-cut pipeline trench (allowing for installation of a 50.8-centimeter- [20.0-inch-] diameter
pipe with 1.2 meters [4.0 feet] of overlying fill).
In addition, projects that fall under federal oversight must take into account the APE for
indirect effects, which considers possible viewshed effects on historic properties located within
line of sight of aboveground project facilities. The APE for indirect effects typically includes all
parcels located adjacent to the proposed construction footprint, but may extend farther depending
on the height of aboveground facilities. The proposed undertaking primarily involves installation
of a subsurface pipeline. In addition, one surface valve site would be constructed, but this would
have a minimal aboveground footprint and there would be no net viewshed impacts to any historic
properties in the surrounding area. As such, for purposes of the cultural resources survey, the

H146-170124

5

Chapter 1.0: Introduction

APE was defined based only on direct impacts from construction and operation of the proposed
pipeline facilities and was not expanded due to indirect impacts resulting from viewshed effects.
In addition to the federal APE described above, the entire segment of the ROW located
on TMPA property (i.e., state land) in Grimes County falls under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities
Code of Texas. This segment of the project area would measure 4.2 kilometers (2.6 miles) in
length by 30.5 meters (100.0 feet) in width and would cover an area of approximately
12.7 hectares (31.5 acres). The segment of the proposed ROW located on TMPA property
includes numerous USACE jurisdictional areas, so there is substantial overlap between federal
and state jurisdiction within this segment of the proposed ROW.
Prior to the initiation of cultural resources survey fieldwork, Magellan proactively engaged
in preliminary consultation with several federally recognized Tribes in the state of Texas to solicit
their comments regarding the proposed undertaking. The Tribes requested that the cultural
resources survey be expanded beyond the typical USACE jurisdictional survey buffers to include
100% of the proposed project corridor. At Magellan’s request, Horizon therefore conducted an
intensive 100% cultural resources survey of the entire ROW in Grimes, Brazos, and Robertson
counties, including USACE jurisdictional areas as well as intervening areas not subject to
regulatory jurisdiction. The 4.2-kilometer- (2.6-mile-) long segment of proposed ROW located on
TMPA property that falls under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of Texas required an
intensive 100% survey regardless of the extent of federal jurisdiction. This report describes the
results of the cultural resources survey conducted for Magellan’s proposed East Houston to
Hearne Project in Grimes, Brazos, and Robertson counties, including all cultural resources
recorded during the survey (including those found in portions of the overall proposed ROW that
are currently considered not to fall under any regulatory jurisdiction). In the interest of meeting
an ambitious reporting schedule, however, shovel testing data presented in this report are limited
to those portions of the ROW that fall within areas currently considered to be subject to federal
and/or state regulation.
Between November 1, 2017, and April 11, 2018, Horizon archeologists Charles Bludau,
Foster Duncan, Benjamin Johnson, Jacob Lyons, Benjamin Morton, Briana N. Smith, and Jared
Wiersema performed an intensive cultural resources survey of the Grimes, Brazos, and
Robertson counties segment of the proposed East Houston to Hearne Pipeline Project’s ROW to
locate any cultural resources that potentially would be impacted by the proposed undertaking.
Following completion of the pedestrian survey with shovel testing, Horizon archeologists Foster
Duncan, Jacob Lyons, Jared Wiersema, and Rachel Naasz returned to the field from
September 20 to October 6, 2018, to conduct supplemental mechanical deep testing using a
backhoe at nine streams that fall within the USACE permit area that were considered to possess
the potential to contain archeological deposits at depths greater than shovel testing was capable
of reaching during initial survey activities. The cultural resources investigation consisted of an
archival review, an intensive cultural resources survey of the APE, and the production of a report
suitable for review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas
Historical Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the
Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The proposed East Houston to Hearne Pipeline ROW in Grimes, Brazos, and Robertson
counties traverses a series of flat to gently rolling coastal lowlands, dissected sandy uplands, and
wide stream valleys on the Gulf Coastal Plain in southeastern Texas. The Gulf of Mexico
represents a structural basin formed by lithosphere deformation. The Texas Coastal Plain, which
extends as far north as the Ouachita uplift in southern Oklahoma and westward to the Balcones
Escarpment, consists of seaward-dipping bodies of sedimentary rock, most of which are of
terrigenous clastic origin, that reflect the gradual infilling of the basin from its margins (Abbott
2001). The Houston region is underlain by rocks and unconsolidated sediments that are quite
young in a geological sense, ranging from modern to Miocene in age. These consist
predominantly of a series of fluviodeltaic bodies arranged in an offlapped sequence, with
interdigitated and capping eolian, littoral, and estuarine facies making up a relatively minor
component of the lithology. Major bounding disconformities between these formations are usually
interpreted to represent depositional hiatuses that occurred during periods of sea level low stand.
The oldest rocks in this fill are of Late Cretaceous age. As a result of the geometry of basin filling,
successively younger rock units crop out in subparallel bands from the basin margin toward the
modern coastline. Farther inland, progressively older deposits of clay and sandstone of Miocene
and Eocene age crop out as bands paralleling the Gulf coastline.
Hydrologically, the project area spans two major watersheds—the San Jacinto and Brazos
rivers. Drainage in the southeastern portion of the project area, extending from the Grimes-Waller
county line northward as far as State Highway (SH) 105 near Stoneham in south-central Grimes
County, is typically to the east and south. From southeast to northwest, the proposed ROW within
southern Grimes County traverses a series of rolling uplands dissected by several major drainage
systems, including Birch Creek, Hurricane Creek, and Sand Creek, including numerous unnamed
tributaries of these streams. These streams ultimately discharge into Spring Creek, which flows
eastward and conjoins with the San Jacinto River within the Lake Houston reservoir.
Drainage patterns shift to the south and west as the proposed ROW continues
northwestward from Stoneham in southern Grimes County and enters the Navasota and Brazos
river watersheds. Continuing northwestward through Grimes County, the proposed ROW
traverses rolling uplands dissected by Grassy Creek, Spring Creek (not the same Spring Creek

H146-170124

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

that forms the northern Harris County line), Holland Creek, Turkey Creek, Rocky Creek, and Sand
Creek, including numerous tributaries of these streams. Minor streams tend to be narrowly
incised into local clay and sandstone bedrock, whereas major streams typically meander across
moderately wide floodplains with well defined terrace structures.
Continuing northwestward from the vicinity of Piedmont in west-central Grimes County,
the proposed ROW crosses the Gibbons Creek floodplain and hugs the eastern margin of the
broad floodplain of the Navasota River. The Navasota River floodplain is quite wide, measuring
3.2 kilometers (2.0 miles) or more in some areas. Tributaries of the Navasota River, including
Gibbons Creek, Dinner Creek, Alum Creek, Panther Creek, and numerous unnamed streams,
enter the broad Navasota River floodplain from the east and form a complex network of
meandering, braided streams, marshes, and sloughs. The proposed ROW turns more sharply
westward near Fergusons’ Crossing and crosses the Navasota River, which forms the GrimesBrazos county line, just south of the SH 30 bridge across the river. The proposed ROW continues
across the broad, marshy, western floodplain of the Navasota River and eventually climbs up onto
a series of sandstone and sand uplands that form a divide between the Navasota River to the
east and the Brazos River to the west.
Heading northwestward through Brazos County, the proposed ROW traverses a series of
rolling uplands with typically relatively narrowly incised streams and tributaries associated with
the watersheds of Wickson Creek, Brushy Creek, Steep Hollow Branch, Carters Creek, Little
Wickson Creek, Thompson’s Branch, Thompson’s Creek, and Peach Creek.
The proposed ROW crosses into Robertson County at the Old San Antonio Road (Texas
OSR) and continues northwestward, crossing the broad floodplain formed by the confluence of
Walker and Campbells creeks. Continuing northwestward, the proposed ROW roughly parallels
US Highway (US) 190/SH 6 and traverses rolling uplands with relatively narrowly incised streams
associated with the Spring Creek and Pin Oak creek watersheds. The northwestern terminus of
the proposed ROW is situated on an upland formation that overlooks the Brazos River to the
southwest.
Elevations vary widely as the proposed ROW rises and falls across uplands and stream
valleys, reaching a maximum elevation of approximately 121.9 meters (400.0 feet) above mean
sea level (amsl) on the crests of prominent upland ridges and descending as low as approximately
61.0 meters (200.0 feet) amsl along on the floodplain of the Navasota River.

2.2

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

The proposed ROW traverses numerous geological formations as it climbs from the
coastal lowlands on the southeast to the sandstone and sand uplands that frame the Gulf Coastal
Plain. From southeast to northwest, major geological formations crossed by the proposed ROW
include the Willis (Qw), Fleming (Mf), Manning (Em), Yegua (Ey), Cook Mountain (Ecm), Sparta
Sand (Es), and Queen City Sand (Eqc) formations (Figure 2-1) (BEG 1974, 1992). These
structures crop out as subparallel bands that frame the coastal lowlands to the southeast and
increase in age moving from southeast to northwest from the Late Pleistocene to the Middle
Eocene.

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

The Willis Formation, which correlates with the Williana Formation farther east in
Louisiana, is also occasionally referred to as pre-Lissie, and units in the same approximate
stratigraphic context have been termed Citronelle (Abbott 2001). The Willis Formation consists
of diverse fluvial deposits of clay, silt, sand, and siliceous gravel. The Willis and other correlative
units are undated at present, though they traditionally have been considered Early Pleistocene
based on stratigraphic criteria.
The Fleming Formation is an Upper Miocene formation composed mostly of silty clay with
common calcareous concretions and medium- to coarse-grained, calcareous sandstone. The
Manning Formation is a Late Eocene formation composed of lignitic clay interbedded with
medium-grained sand with brittle, tuffaceous sandstone. The Yegua Formation is a Middle
Eocene formation composed of quartzitic, indurated to friable sandstone and lignitic clay with
common lentils of lignite and ironstone concretions. The Cook Mountain Formation is a Middle
Eocene formation composed of glauconitic clay with abundant marine megafossils. The Sparta
Sand Formation is a Middle Eocene formation composed of quartzitic sand with silty clay partings.
The Queen City Sand Formation is a Middle Eocene formation composed of fine-grained,
quartzitic sand with thin interbeds of clay, sand, and silt.
While debate about the temporal affiliations of and correlations among the deposits that
underlie the major coastline terraces remain active, they are of little direct geoarcheological
relevance because virtually all investigators agree that these deposits considerably predate the
earliest demonstrated dates of human occupation in North America.
The proposed ROW also traverses bands of Holocene-age alluvium (Qal) and framing
terrace structures composed of Late Pleistocene-age fluviatile terrace deposits (Qt). Bands of
Holocene-age alluvium typify the broad floodplain of the Navasota River and its tributaries,
including Rocky, Gibbons, Alum, and Panther creeks.
The vast majority of natural soils mapped within the proposed ROW consist of residuum
weathered in situ from local marl, clay, sandstone, and siltstone bedrock formations (Table 2-1)
(NRCS 2018). However, clayey and loamy Holocene-age soils are common within the broad
floodplains formed by the major streams and rivers traversed by the proposed ROW, primarily
within the broad floodplain formed by the Navasota River and its major tributaries.

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995). While
the paleoclimatic history of the coastal region remains unclear, Bryant and Holloway (1985)
present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central Texas that includes three separate
climatic periods—the Wisconsin Full Glacial Period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.), the Late Glacial
Period (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.), and the Post-Glacial Period (10,000 B.P. to present). Evidence
from the Wisconsin Full Glacial Period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas was
considerably cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region was
more heavily forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and Holloway
1985). The Late Glacial Period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow

warming and/or drying trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands were
gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985). During
the Post-Glacial Period, the east-central Texas environment appears to have been more stable.
The deciduous forests had long since been replaced by prairies and post oak savannas. The
drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial Period continued into the midHolocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic conditions
lasting from roughly 6000 to 5000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and Holloway (1985) indicate
that modern environmental conditions in east-central Texas were probably achieved by
1,500 years ago.
The modern climate of the upper Texas coast, including the region surrounding Houston,
is classified as subtropical humid (Abbott 2001; Larkin and Bomar 1983), forming a transitional
zone between the humid southeastern US and the semiarid to arid west. The climate reflects the
influences of latitude, low elevation, and proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, which combine with the
urban heat island formed by the tremendous concentration of asphalt and concrete to give the
Houston area a notorious modern climate that is oppressively warm and moist throughout much
of the year. As a result of proximity to the Gulf and the abundance of surface water, humidity in
the early morning can approach 100% even on cloudless summer days, and it often exceeds 50%
even on the warmest afternoons. Largely as a consequence of the relatively high humidity
characteristic of the region, temperature patterns exhibit a moderate annual range and a modest
diurnal range that increases slightly with distance from the coast. Average monthly high
temperature ranges from a low of 17 to 19°Celcius (°C) (59 to 63°Fahrenheit [°F]) in January to a
high of 38 to 40°C (89 to 96°F) in August. Average monthly lows range from 4 to 9°C (38 to 47°F)
in January to 25 to 29°C (72 to 79°F) in July and August. Annually, average low temperatures

Cultural Resources Assessment of USACE Jurisdictional Areas and TMPA Property on the Proposed

range from 15 to 21°C (56 to 65°F), and average high temperatures range from 27 to 29°C (75 to
79°F) (Abbott 2001; Larkin and Bomar 1983).
The Houston region experiences two precipitation peaks throughout the year (Abbott
2001; Wheeler 1976). The first occurs in the late spring (i.e., May to June) due to the passage of
infrequent cold fronts that spawn chains of powerful frontal thunderstorms. The second occurs in
the late summer to early autumn (i.e., August to September) due to the incidence of tropical
storms and hurricanes from the Atlantic and, occasionally, Pacific oceans. In contrast, winter and
early spring are relatively dry, and high summer rainfall is dominated by convectional
thunderstorms that are relatively brief and localized, albeit frequently intense. Average annual
precipitation varies from a low of approximately 101.6 centimeters (40.0 inches) to a high of more
than 132.1 centimeters (52.0 inches). Average monthly precipitation varies from less than 5.1 to
7.6 centimeters (2.0 to 3.0 inches) in March to more than 19.1 centimeters (7.5 inches) occurring
locally on the coast during September. Almost all of the measurable precipitation falls as rain—
snowfall is extremely rare, occurring in measurable amounts in only 1 in 10 years.

2.4

FLORA AND FAUNA

The project area is situated near the southeastern edge of the Texan biotic province (Blair
1950), an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces
and the grasslands of the Kansas, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces. Some species reach
the limits of their ecological range within the Texas province. McMahon et al. (1984) further define
four broad communities that characterize that portion of the Texas biotic province that lies on the
Gulf Coastal Plain: (1) coastal marsh/barrier island, (2) coastal prairie, (3) coastal gallery forest,
and (4) pine-hardwood forest (cf. Abbott 2001:24-26).
The coastal marsh/barrier island category includes well-drained, sandy, coastal
environments and saline and freshwater wetlands in the coastal zone (Abbott 2001:24). Marsh
vegetation is typical of areas that are seasonally wet and have substrates composed primarily of
sands and silts, clays, or organic decomposition products. Vegetation assemblages are strongly
controlled by texture, salinity, frequency and duration of inundation, and depth of the seasonal
water table. Sandy, relatively well-drained, freshwater environments are typically dominated by
little bluestem, switchgrass, Florida paspalum, and brownseed paspalum. Wetter environments
are often dominated by marshhay cordgrass, seashore saltgrass, saggitaria, bulrushes, smooth
cordgrass, seashore paspalum, seashore dropseed, olney bulrush, saltmarsh bulrush, saltmarsh
aster, longtom, sprangletop, burhead, arrowhead, coastal waterhyssop, needlegrass rush, and
other sedges and rushes. Slightly higher, better-drained environments are characterized by such
taxa as seashore saltgrass, seashore paspalum, gulfdune paspalum, shoregrass, gulf cordgrass,
red lovegrass, bushy sea-oxey, and glasswort. A variety of fauna are characteristic of the shore
zone. Important larger taxa include raccoon, nutria, alligators, turtles, swamp rabbit, and many
birds, including ducks, geese, herons, and many smaller species. Aquatic taxa, including a wealth
of fish and shellfish adapted to brackish to hypersaline conditions, are also important in the coastal
zone.
The coastal prairie category consists primarily of grasses with minor amounts of forbs and
woody plants in areas that are not saturated on a seasonal basis (Abbott 2001:24-26). This

H146-170124

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

community is characteristic of upland areas and grades into the pine-hardwood forest to the north
and east and into the coastal marsh/barrier island to the south. A wide variety of grasses are
found in the prairie environments, but the principal taxa include big bluestem, little bluestem,
indiangrass, eastern grama, switchgrass, brownseed paspalum, sideoats grama, silver bluestem,
buffalograss, threeawn, and Texas wintergrass. Common forbs include Maximilian sunflower,
Engelman daisy, blacksalmon, penstemon, dotted gayfeather, bundleflower, yellow neptunia,
snoutbean, prairie clover, tickclover, wildbean, western indigo, paintbrush, bluebonnet, ragweed,
croton, milkweed, vetch, verbena, and winecup. Woody plants occurring in the coastal prairie
include mesquite, honey locust, huisache, eastern baccharis, sesbania, live oak, elm, hackberry,
bumelia, and coralberry. The frequency of trees increases dramatically as the coastal prairie
grades into the pine-hardwood forest, forming an open woodland environment with common
stands of hardwood trees and occasional pines. The coastal prairie is home to a diverse fauna,
including coyote, white-tailed deer, skunks, cottontail rabbit, many small rodents, amphibians,
reptiles, and a variety of permanent and migratory birds. Bison and pronghorn were also present
at various times in the past.
The coastal gallery forest consists of diverse, principally deciduous trees and associated
understory in floodplains and streams that traverse the outer coastal plain (Abbott 2001:26).
Important taxa include water oak, pecan, poplar, American elm, cedar elm, sugarberry, ash,
loblolly pine, post oak, cherrybark oak, mulberry, swamp chestnut oak, willow oak, sweetgum,
hawthorn, dogwood, hickory, bois d’arc, sassafras cypress, willow, cottonwood, and sumac.
Shrubs and vines such as mustang grape, greenbrier, yaupon, coralberry, possumhaw,
elderberry, honeysuckle, dewberry, and blackberry are common in the understory, as are grasses
such as little bluestem, big bluestem, and indiangrass. The fauna of the gallery forest include
white-tailed deer, opossum, raccoon, squirrel, turkey, a variety of small mammals and rodents,
turtles, snakes, and many birds. Black bear was also present at various times in the past, and a
number of fish and a few varieties of shellfish are present in the streams.
The pine-hardwood forest is characterized by a mix of coniferous and deciduous trees,
including longleaf pine, shortleaf pine, loblolly pine, post oak, red oak, white oak, blackjack oak,
willow oak, and live oak (Abbott 2001:26). Riparian environments often support larger deciduous
trees like pecan, cottonwood, hickory, beech, and American elm. Understory vegetation varies
from relatively open to quite dense, and consists of shrubs, vines, forbs, and young trees.
Common shrubs include acacia, yaupon, mayhaw, wild persimmon, myrtle, greenbriar, Virginia
creeper, blackberry, dewberry, trumpet vine, gourd, and poison ivy. A variety of fauna is also
present, including white-tailed deer, opossum, raccoon, squirrel, rabbit, mink, skunk, various small
rodents, turtles, reptiles, and many different birds. Black bear was also present at times in the
past, and bison and pronghorn were occasionally present in the transition zone to the coastal
prairie environment.

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located within the Southeast Texas Archeological Region, a 21-county
area extending from the Colorado River on the west to the Sabine River on the east and
measuring about 199.5 kilometers (124.0 miles) inland from the Gulf of Mexico coastline. Much
of the archeological record in Southeast Texas represents an interface between the Southern
Great Plains and the Southeastern Woodlands (Aten 1983, 1984; Patterson 1995; Story 1990).
Further distinctions are often made between the inland and coastal margin subregions of
Southeast Texas. These two subregions are somewhat culturally distinct, and the inland
subregion has a much longer chronological record. The coastal margin of Southeast Texas
comprises a zone about 25.7 kilometers (16.0 miles) inland from the coast that covers the area
influenced by Gulf tidal flows on the salinity of streams, lakes, and bays. Considerable ecological
variability characterizes this subregion, including woodlands, coastal prairie, lakes, wetlands,
marine coastline, and barrier islands. The inland subregion also encompasses considerable
ecological diversity, including mixed woodlands, coastal prairies, and dense piney woods.
The human inhabitants of Southeast Texas practiced a generally nomadic hunting and
gathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory. While many of the same labels are used to denote
Southeast Texas cultural/chronological periods, the timeframe and cultural characteristics of
Southeast Texas culture periods are often different than in neighboring regions. For instance, the
Archaic and Late Prehistoric time periods are different in Central and Southeast Texas, and
Central Texas lacks the Early Ceramic period that has been defined for Southeast Texas.
Mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have changed markedly through time in
Southeast Texas. Inland sites are usually found near a water source, usually exhibit evidence of
reoccupation through time, have well-defined intrasite activity areas, tend not to be associated
with satellite activity sites or separate base camps, and exhibit a range of subsistence-related
activities. Inland sites also tend to contain modest pottery assemblages, fired clay balls (at some
sites), abundant lithic material, and an absence of shell tools. Coastal sites tend to consist of
multicomponent Rangia shell middens that contain oyster shell tools, large quantities of pottery
(in later cultural components), numerous bone tools, and only a few lithic artifacts.

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 10,000 B.C. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;

Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists have historically discounted claims of much earlier human
occupation during the Pleistocene glacial period. However, recent investigations of the Buttermilk
Creek Complex in Bell County, Texas, have raised the possibility that a pre-Clovis culture may
have been present in North America as early as 15,500 years ago (Waters et al. 2011).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Southeast Texas is represented
by the PaleoIndian period (10,000 to 5000 B.C.) (Patterson 1995). This stage coincided with
ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that witnessed the
extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing various periods
within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often fluted, lanceolate
projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end-scrapers, gravers, and
bone foreshafts. Most evidence of the PaleoIndian period in Southeast Texas is based on surface
finds of projectile points, though temporally diagnostic projectile points also have been found in
excavated contexts mixed with later Archaic-period materials (Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat
1953).
PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized into egalitarian bands
consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic subsistence and settlement
pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence patterns in Southeast Texas are
known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence focused on the exploitation of
small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the PaleoIndian period. There is little evidence in
this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as has been documented elsewhere in North
America; rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern appears to have been practiced during all
prehistoric time periods. The fact that most recovered PaleoIndian projectile points are of highgrade lithic materials that are scarce or absent in Southeast Texas suggests a widespread
movement of people and materials (Ricklis 2004). Johnson (1989) has suggested that
deteriorating climatic conditions on the Great Plains during the early Holocene may have
prompted PaleoIndian populations to move into the margins of the Eastern Woodlands, where
some degree of interaction and acculturation took place between the resident PaleoIndian groups
and the newcomers.
In Southeast Texas, the PaleoIndian stage is divided into two periods based on
recognizable differences in projectile point styles (Patterson 1995). These include the Early
PaleoIndian period (10,000 to 8000 B.C.), which is recognized based on large, fluted projectile
points (i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late PaleoIndian period
(8000 to 5000 B.C.), which is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview,
Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (5000 B.C. TO A.D. 100)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend signaled the beginning of the Archaic stage
(5000 B.C. to A.D. 100) (Patterson 1995). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a

30

Cultural Resources Assessment of USACE Jurisdictional Areas and TMPA Property on the Proposed

significant reorientation of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less
pronounced in Southeast Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and corresponding
decrease in the big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified
resource base composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Southeast Texas, however, this
hunting and gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The appearance of a more
diversified tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone assemblage, and a general
decrease in the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural stage. Material culture shows
greater diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in the application of groundstone
technology.
The Archaic in Texas is generally defined by pre- or nonhorticultural adaptations and preceramic and pre-bow-and-arrow hunting techniques (Hester 1980; Prewitt 1981; Suhm et al.
1954). Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods. In
Southeast Texas, the Early Archaic period (5000 to 3000 B.C.) is marked by the presence of Bell,
Carrollton, Morrill, Trinity, Wells, and miscellaneous Early Stemmed projectile points. The Bell
point is the only type in this period that is closely associated with the Southern Plains. Many of
the latter point types continue into the Middle Archaic period (3000 to 1500 B.C.) and several new
types appear, including Bulverde, Lange, Pedernales, Williams, Travis, and probably the GaryKent series. The Late Archaic period (1,500 B.C. to A.D. 100) is characterized by Gary, Kent,
Darl, Yarbrough, Ensor, Ellis, Fairland, Palmillas, and Marcos points.
A general absence of faunal and macrobotanical remains at inland Archaic sites tends to
preclude drawing inferences about subsistence and settlement patterns beyond the assumption
of a generalized hunting and gathering adaptation (Ricklis 2004). Coastal and estuarine Archaic
adaptations focused on the exploitation of shellfish (Rangia cuneata and oyster) by around 2000
B.C., when the modern sea level stabilized (Aten 1983), though the presence of terrestrial
mammal and reptile remains at most sites indicates a mix of exploited resource zones (Ricklis
2004). A shift to the use of poorer-quality, local lithic materials in Late Archaic times may point to
reduced group mobility and more tightly defined group territories (Story 1990).
In the western part of inland Southeast Texas, a Late Archaic mortuary tradition developed
in the lower Brazos and Colorado river valleys and in the intervening area (Hall 1981; Patterson
1995). Organized burial practices actually started during the Middle Archaic period but reached
full development in the Late Archaic with the use of exotic grave goods such as boatstones and
bannerstones (probably used as atlatl weights), stone gorgets, corner-tang knives, stingray
spines, shark teeth, and marine shell beads and pendants. Other burial practices included the
systematic orientation of burial direction, body position, use of red ochre, and use of locally made
grave goods, such as longbone implements and bone pins. Most burials are found in extended
supine position, though some extended prone and bundle burials are also known. Burial direction
is usually consistent within single sites but varies from site to site. Patterson et al. (1993) report
that at least 11 sites are associated with this mortuary tradition in Austin, Fort Bend, and Wharton
counties. The establishment of discrete cemeteries is generally considered to represent
expressions of group territoriality in a systemic response to growing populations within the
resource-rich floodplains of regional streams (Hall 1995; Story 1985).

3.3

EARLY CERAMIC PERIOD (A.D. 100 TO 600)

The use of pottery did not start uniformly throughout Southeast Texas. Pottery
manufacture appears to have diffused into this region from adjacent regions, primarily from the
east, progressing first along the coastal margin and then moving inland (Patterson 1995).
Southeastern Texas ceramic chronologies are best known in the Galveston Bay area, where Aten
(1983) established a detailed chronological sequence based on changes in pottery types or the
proportional representation of types in site assemblages. Aten (1983:297) argues that pottery
was being manufactured on the coastal margin of the Texas-Louisiana border by about 70 B.C.,
in the Galveston Bay area by about A.D. 100, in the western part of the coastal margin by about
A.D. 300, and in the Conroe-Livingston inland area by about A.D. 500. Aten’s (1983) ceramic
seriation has been widely employed as a means of temporally ordering sites on the upper Texas
coast, but the periods he defined are not particularly well dated and are based on radiocarbon
dates from only nine sites. In addition, subsequent research has shown that key nonceramic
traits used by Aten (1983) as correlative time markers, such as the socketed bone point, actually
have far longer time spans than assumed in his sequence. Nevertheless, Aten’s (1983) sequence
remains useful for broad chronological assignments of ceramic components.
The earliest ceramic periods in the Galveston Bay and neighboring Sabine Lake areas
appear to be approximately contemporaneous with the earliest ceramic periods of the Lower
Mississippi Valley (Aten 1983, 1984; Phillips 1970; Weinstein 1986). Early assemblages contain
substantial quantities of Tchefuncte ceramics, including Tchefuncte Plain, occasional specimens
of Tchefuncte Stamped (rocker stamped), Mandeville Plain, O’Neal Plain var. Conway, and
Goose Creek Plain var. Anahuac. The Mandeville and Tchefuncte types are characterized by
contorted paste and poor coil wedging. Mandeville has sandy paste (like Goose Creek), while
Tchefuncte paste has relatively little sand. Given their technological similarities, Mandeville and
Tchefuncte may represent different clay sources rather than distinct pottery types (Patterson
1995). Within Aten’s (1983) earliest defined ceramic phase, Clear Lake, Tchefuncte and
Mandeville ceramics are among the earliest ceramics in the region, with Goose Creek emerging
somewhat later (Aten 1983; Ellis and Ensor 1998; Ensor 1995). In the Sabine Lake region, grogtempered varieties of Baytown Plain and Marksville Stamped are common, while grog-tempered
ceramics do not occur in the Galveston Bay area 129.7 kilometers (80.0 miles) to the west until
several hundred years later. With the principal exception of a few Tchefuncte ceramic types,
other southern Louisiana ceramics are not found on the Gulf coast west of the Sabine Lake area.
Goose Creek sandy-paste pottery was used throughout Southeast Texas and somewhat
farther north in the Early Ceramic, Late Prehistoric, and the early part of the Historic periods (Aten
1984; Patterson 1995; Pertulla et al. 1995). The Goose Creek series is the primary utility ware
throughout the prehistoric sequence in Southeast Texas, though it gives way to Baytown Plain for
about 200 years during the transition between the Late Prehistoric and Historic periods before
once again becoming predominant into the Historic period (Aten 1984). Sandy-paste Goose
Creek Plain predominates, and Goose Creek Incised exhibits very simple designs, usually
consisting of one to three parallel horizontal incisions under rim exteriors (Aten 1983). A minor
variety, Goose Creek Stamped, occurs only in the Early Ceramic period (Aten 1983). Three other
minor pottery types—Tchefuncte (Plain and Stamped), Mandeville, and O’Neal Plain var. Conway

32

Cultural Resources Assessment of USACE Jurisdictional Areas and TMPA Property on the Proposed

(Aten 1983)—were used only during the Early Ceramic period. The more elaborate incised
designs and zoned stamping of the Marksville ceramics of Louisiana are absent, and vessel
shapes are simple jars or deep bowls with rounded or conoidal, noded bases. The ubiquity of
simple, sandy-paste pottery provides a general link with the Early Ceramic period in Northeast
Texas, where simple sandy-paste ceramics are predominant prior to the emergence of
horticultural Caddoan adaptations and an associated elaboration of pottery (Perttula 1995, 2004).
The bone-tempered pottery that characterizes ceramic assemblages elsewhere in Texas is not
common in Southeast Texas.
While the earliest pottery serves as a time marker and may also indicate increased
efficiency in food processing and/or storage technology, ceramic components often overlie earlier
Archaic components on sites located along bay shores and river drainages, suggesting
fundamental continuities in settlement and subsistence patterns (Ambler 1967; Aten 1983; Aten
et al. 1976; Ensor 1987, 1995; Ensor and Carlson 1988; Gadus and Howard 1990; Hines 1992;
Moore 1994, 1995; Nash and Rogers 1992; Weinstein and Whelan 1987; Wheat 1953). Two
broad perspectives have been offered to frame the conversation about Early Ceramic period
cultures in Southeast Texas. Shafer (1975) and Aten (1984) have suggested an affiliation with
the Woodland cultures of the eastern US, noting the retention of various stylistic attributes similar
to pre-Mississippian period ceramics of Louisiana and the Lower Mississippi Valley. Story (1990),
on the other hand, suggests that Southeast Texas is archeologically distinct, with a relatively
homogeneous ceramic assemblage composed of sandy-paste (and, later, grog-tempered)
vessels, a minority of which were decorated with simple geometric incised motifs in narrow bands
under rim exteriors that differ from typical Woodland decorative patterns. Story (1990) has coined
the term Mossy Grove Tradition to designate the Early Ceramic period in the area, noting its
approximate geographic correlation with distinct ethnic and linguistic groups of early historic
times, including the Attakapan-speaking Bidai, Akokisa, and other tribes (cf. Aten 1983; Newcomb
1961).

3.4

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 600 TO 1500)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 600 to 1500) is defined by the appearance
of the bow and arrow and small, light, straight- and expanded-stem arrow points (Patterson 1995).
Elsewhere in Texas, pottery also appears during the latter part of the Late Prehistoric period;
however, as already discussed, ceramics appear earlier in Southeast Texas. Along the coastal
margin of Southeast Texas, use of the atlatl (i.e., spearthrower) and spear was generally
discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though they continued to be used in the inland
subregion along with the bow and arrow through the Late Prehistoric period (Ensor and Carlson
1991; Keller and Weir 1979; Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In fact, Patterson (1995:254)
proposes that use of the bow and arrow started in Southeast Texas as early as the end of the
Middle Archaic period, using unifacial arrow points that consisted of marginally retouched flakes.
In contrast, Prewitt (1981) argues for a generalized date of adoption of the bow-and-arrow hunting
system at about the same time (ca. A.D. 600) in Central and Southeast Texas. In Southeast
Texas, unifacial arrow points appear to be associated with a small prismatic blade technology.
Bifacial arrow point types include Alba, Catahoula, Perdiz, and Scallorn. A seriation sequence

H146-170124

33

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

for these point types has not been established in Southeast Texas, though Scallorn points appear
to predate Perdiz points throughout the rest of Texas.
Findings at the Mitchell Ridge site (41GV66) on Galveston Island suggest that the Late
Prehistoric in Southeast Texas can be divided into subperiods, as is the case elsewhere in Texas
(Ricklis 1994). At Mitchell Ridge, an Initial Late Prehistoric subperiod is associated with the
introduction of the bow and arrow, as reflected in the appearance of Scallorn arrow points. The
Final Late Prehistoric subperiod at the site corresponds with changes occurring throughout most
of Texas, as represented by the emergence of the Toyah phase (Prewitt 1985) in inland areas
and the Rockport phase on the central Texas coast (Ricklis 1992, 1995, 1996). These changes
involved the appearance of bison bone in faunal assemblages by A.D. 1250/1300 and a lithic
technocomplex consisting of Perdiz arrow points, unifacial end scrapers, blade-core lithic
technology, thin bifacial knives (often alternately beveled), and expanded-base drills/perforators
made on flakes and prismatic blades (Black 1986, 1989; Hester 1975, 1980; Johnson 1994;
Ricklis 1992, 1994; Ricklis and Cox 1993). The nearly consistent co-occurrence of bison bone
and this lithic assemblage suggests a significant shift to bison hunting and a concomitant adoption
of a technological package well suited to the procurement of large game and the processing of
meat and hides (Black 1986; Creel 1991; Johnson 1994; Ricklis 1992, 1994).
During the Late Prehistoric period, ceramics underwent some discernable technological
and stylistic changes. Grog- (i.e., crushed-sherd-) tempered pottery was introduced, which Aten
(1983) places at ca. A.D. 1000, though this development may have occurred somewhat earlier
given the tendency for radiocarbon dates in his sequence to be older than site age estimates
based on ceramic seriation (Ricklis 2004). The grog-tempered varieties include San Jacinto Plain
and Baytown Plain variety Phoenix Lake. San Jacinto pottery contains a relatively small
proportion of small-sized temper, while Baytown Plain has larger amounts of sherd pieces that
are often visible on vessel surfaces. As previously mentioned, sandy-paste Goose Creek pottery
remained in use throughout the Late Prehistoric period. Rockport Plain and Asphalt Coated
pottery from the central Texas coast are found at a few sites in Southeast Texas during the Late
Prehistoric and Protohistoric periods (Ricklis 1995). General parallels at this time between the
decorative motifs on the upper Texas coast and the Coles Creek-Plaquemine sequence in coastal
Louisiana and the Lower Mississippi Valley, such as wider bands of horizontal incised lines under
rims as well as decorative subrim zones of vertical, oblique, and cross-hatched incised lines,
suggest increased interaction with people to the east.

3.5

PROTOHISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 1500 TO 1700)

For the most part, protohistoric and early historic Indian sites in Southeast Texas have not
been articulated with the ethnographic record (Story 1990:258). Similarly, reconciling the
ethnographic record to prehistoric Indian groups in this region is problematic. Late prehistoric
and historic population movements further complicate this issue. Aten (1983) has reconstructed
the territories of native groups present in this region in the early 18th century, including the
Akokisa, Atakapa, Bidai, Coco (possibly Karankawa), and Tonkawa. The presence of the
Tonkawa in Southeast Texas may be due to their rapid expansion from Central Texas in the
17th and 18th centuries (Newcomb 1993:27). The Karankawa Indians are thought to have

34

170124_arch_survey_fort worth_report

Cultural Resources Assessment of USACE Jurisdictional Areas and TMPA Property on the Proposed
East Houston to Hearne Pipeline Right-of-Way, Grimes, Brazos, and Robertson Counties, Texas

occupied the coastal margin of this region as far east as Galveston Island and the corresponding
mainland (Aten 1983). Judging by the scarcity of Rockport pottery on sites east of the San
Bernard River, the ethnic association of the Karankawa Indians with the Coco tribe may be in
doubt.
Protohistoric and historic Indian sites may not be systematically recognized as such
because few aboriginal artifact types changed from the Late Prehistoric to the Historic periods
(Patterson 1995). Only a few non-European artifact types are useful in identifying historic Indian
sites, including Bulbar Stemmed and Guerrero arrow points and possibly Fresno and Cuney
points after A.D. 1500 (Hudgins 1986). Historic period Indian sites are usually identified by the
presence of glass and metal artifacts, gunflints, and European types of pottery.

3.6

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. A.D. 1700 TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when Álvarez
de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de
Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay;
however, European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until after 1700. The
first half of the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission system, as well as
the first effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native culture and social
systems. This process is clearly discernable at the Mitchell Ridge site, where the burial data
suggest population declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994), as well as increased participation
on the part of the Native American population in the fur trade. By the time heavy settlement of
Texas began in the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous Indian population was
greatly diminished. The Alabama-Coushatta Indians who currently reside in Southeast Texas are
migrants who were displaced from the east in the late 18th to early 19th centuries (Newcomb
1961).
3.5.1

Historical Background of Grimes County, Texas

The earliest historical inhabitants of the area were the Bidai Indians.1. For most of the
century after 1691, when they first appeared in the records of the Spanish, the Bidais experienced
little contact with Europeans. Though a generally peaceful people, the Bidais incurred Spanish
suspicions in the late 1700s by trading with the French and their allies, the Lipan Apaches, whom
the Bidais supplied with firearms smuggled in from Louisiana. In the late 18th and early
19th centuries, the Bidais suffered a disastrous population decline, primarily as a result of
disease. By the early 1800s, perhaps only 100 warriors remained, dwelling in a handful of widely
scattered villages along the principal local streams, notably Bedias Creek in what is now northern
Grimes and southern Madison counties. As Anglo settlement began in the early 1820s, these
villages were enlarged by refugees from neighboring tribes such as the Kickapoos and
Coushattas. These tribes established homes along the Trinity River on the eastern edge of the
Bidai territory; from there, they made hunting forays into what is now Grimes County. Their route
to the Brazos River in southern Grimes County was known as the Coushatta Trace. The Tonkawa

Indians were also known to conduct raids in the area in search of game or plunder, and a group
of them may have lived briefly in the bottoms of the lower Navasota River. By and large, the
Indian residents of what would become Grimes County lived amicably with the whites who settled
among them in the early 1800s. Their presence, in fact, seems to have afforded the Anglo settlers
a measure of protection against raids by hostile tribes such as the Comanches and Apaches. The
last fatal Indian raid in what would become Grimes County occurred in 1841. Few Bidais
remained in the area by that date. Some were assimilated into nearby tribes such as the
Orcoquizas, the Coushattas, and the Caddos. Most of the surviving Bidais were finally expelled
to reservations, first on the upper Brazos River, and later in the Oklahoma Territory, by the US
government’s general removal program in 1854. The 1860 census found only six Indians still in
residence in the county.
During the 1600s and 1700s, the territory that is now Grimes County was part of a vast
arena of competition between the Spanish and the French. It is likely that the first European to
set foot within what is now Grimes County was the ill-fated French explorer René Robert Cavelier,
Sieur de La Salle, who may have crossed the area early in 1687, traveling from Matagorda Bay
in a final attempt to reach the Mississippi River. On March 20, 1687, La Salle was murdered by
members of his own party at a site some believe to have been a few miles above the confluence
of the Brazos and Navasota rivers near what is now the town of Navasota. The first Spaniard to
reach the area was probably Alonso De León, the governor of Coahuila, who, while exploring
eastern Texas in 1690 in the company of Father Damián Massanet, traveled northeast from
Goliad to the vicinity of Navasota and continued past the future sites of Anderson and Prairie
Plains toward the Neches River. His route, originally a crude Indian trace through southern Texas,
soon became known as La Bahía road or trail and served as an important Spanish thoroughfare
between the presidio at Goliad and that of San Francisco de los Tejas on the Old San Antonio
Road near what is now Crockett. In 1767, the Marqués de Rubí traversed what is now Grimes
County en route from San Antonio to the Sabine River on his noted inspection tour of the Spanish
frontier. In 1788, Pedro Vial, searching for the most direct route from Natchitoches to San Antonio,
crossed the future county from northeast to southwest, generally following La Bahía trail.
Anglo settlement began with the founding of Stephen F. Austin’s colony between the lower
Brazos and Colorado rivers. In 1821, Andrew Millican took up residence along Holland Creek
west of what is now Anderson. By the end of 1824, seven of Austin’s original colonists (the socalled Old Three Hundred) had claimed land within what is now Grimes County. Early residents
included the families of Francis Holland, Isaac Jackson, James Whiteside, Jesse Grimes, Caleb
Wallace, Jared E. Groce, and Anthony Kennard. Before the outbreak of the Texas Revolution in
1836, a total of 64 heads of household obtained land grants within the future county from the
Mexican government. As elsewhere within the Austin colony, these first settlers were attracted
to the rich bottomlands along the rivers and major creeks and also preferred prairie acreage over
timberland. In 1822, Jared E. Groce moved from Alabama with some 90 slaves and settled on
the Brazos River near what is now Hempstead. There he planted what may have been one of
the first cotton crops in the Austin colony. Soon he began cultivating the staple on a three-league
tract in what is now southwestern Grimes County, where perhaps as early as 1825 he constructed
what may have been the first cotton gin in Texas. His example was soon imitated by settlers
taking up land nearby. Most immigrants at this time were from the slaveholding southern US, with

Alabamians perhaps preponderant among them, and brought with them slaves and a culture
shaped by the institution of slavery. The phenomenon of chain migration was conspicuous in this
phase of the area’s history. At least one settler, Tandy Walker, who arrived in the area about
1830, acted as a kind of land agent and collected fees for facilitating the immigration of perhaps
a dozen or more families from his former home in Alabama to his new neighborhood in what is
now southern Grimes County.
In 1830, the territory of what would become the county was incorporated into the new
Viesca District, and in 1835 it became part of the newly organized Washington Municipality. The
first post office in the area was established in December 1835 at the Fanthorp Inn, founded two
years before by Englishman Henry Fanthorp. Settlers in this vicinity abandoned their homes in
March and April of 1836 and to escape from the advancing Mexican army and joined the mass
eastward flight known as the Runaway Scrape. The area was quickly reoccupied after the Battle
of San Jacinto and its development accelerated. It became part of Montgomery County, which
was organized by the Congress of the Republic of Texas in 1837. On April 6, 1846, the first state
legislature accepted the petition of local residents and established Grimes County, named in
honor of Jesse Grimes, a signer of the Texas Declaration of Independence who was then
representing the area in the state Senate. A vigorously contested election later in the year
resulted in the designation of Anderson, recently platted in the center of the county, as the seat
of government. In 1853, Madison County was carved out of northern Grimes County, which
assumed its present boundaries in 1873, when Waller County was formed from territory in its
southern extremity.
The county’s adoption of the Old South pattern of plantation agriculture was evident in the
census of 1850, which found 1,680 slaves and two free blacks residing amidst a white population
of 2,326. As they had been from the beginning, cotton and corn remained the only significant
cultivated crops; 2,282 bales of cotton and 138,405 bushels of corn were produced in 1850. Stock
raising was also important, as demonstrated by large and growing herds of cattle, hogs, and
sheep. However, the persistence of frontier conditions was indicated by the fact that farmland
comprised less than 20% of the county’s total area and by the high ratio of oxen (1,193) to mules
(231), which suggests that farmers were still struggling with the task of breaking the land to the
plow. The county’s slave population continued to increase at an astonishing rate during the last
decade of antebellum Texas as a result not only of purchases by current residents but also of
continuing heavy migration of slaveholders from the lower South. In 1855, the county tax rolls
enumerated 3,124 slaves, representing an almost 86% increase over the 1850 level. The 1858
county tax roll listed 42 residents as holders of 20 or more slaves, the index of wealth often used
to define a “planter,” while the 1860 census listed 76 individuals owning 20 or more slaves. By
1860, there were 4,852 whites in the county and 5,468 slaves, constituting 53% of the population.
Thus, though the white population had doubled in the preceding decade, the slave population had
tripled. With 505 slaveholders, Grimes was one of only 17 counties in the state in which the
average number of slaves per slaveholder was greater than 10. On the eve of the Civil War, the
county’s agriculture had begun to show signs that it had advanced beyond frontier conditions. By
1860, more than half of the county’s total area had been incorporated into farms, and the ratio of
oxen to all other draft animals had fallen below 40%. Corn and cotton remained by far the most
significant crops, with cotton production increasing more than eightfold over its 1850 level to

H146-170124

37

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

18,303 bales. The value of livestock increased more than 275% over the 1850 figure to $766,739;
the total of almost 39,000 head of cattle would not be reached again until the late 1940s, while
the 1860 figure of 18,000 sheep would never be seen again.
The population surge also hastened the development of towns. By 1856, six communities
had acquired post offices—Anderson, Bedias, Grimesville, Retreat, Prairie Plains, and Navasota.
Two spas were established in the county around 1850—Kellum Springs, 10 miles north of
Anderson; and Piedmont Springs, seven miles west of Anderson. Piedmont Springs, in particular,
attracted guests from great distances, and in 1860 a four-story, 100-room hotel was constructed
there. The railroad first reached Grimes County in 1859, when the Houston and Texas Central
extended its line to Navasota, thus bypassing Anderson, whose residents had rejected the
railroad, supposedly remarking that such an innovation “would scare our mules and our Negroes.”
Though founded only in the early 1850s, Navasota, with the aid of the railroad, rapidly grew into
an important commercial center.
There was virtually no voice in Grimes County raised in opposition to the secessionist
movement during the crisis of 1860 and 1861. The referendum of February 1861 returned a
majority of 907 to 9 in favor of secession. Hundreds of county residents volunteered for service
in Confederate and state military units. State formations to which local companies were attached
included the Second, Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Texas Infantry and the Twenty-first Texas
Cavalry. In 1861, a munitions factory specializing in small armaments was constructed
3.2 kilometers (2.0 miles) west of Anderson, employing dozens of adults and a number of
children. The first telegraph lines in the county were strung through Navasota in 1862 for the
benefit of the railroad and the Confederate government. In the summer of 1863, General John B.
Magruder, commander of the Department of Texas, established his headquarters at Piedmont
Springs and stationed a division of Confederate soldiers there; by 1865, the once-opulent
ballroom of the Piedmont Hotel had been converted into a military hospital. To circumvent the
Union blockade of the Texas coast, planters transported cotton to Mexico in trains of ox wagons.
The staple was exchanged for food and clothing, which helped to mitigate the wartime privation
suffered by Grimes County residents. Far from halting immigration, the war in fact generated an
influx of planter refugees from the lower South, seeking protection for their slave property. Some
purchased bottomland on which to raise their own cotton, while others rented their slaves to local
landowners. By 1864, according to county tax rolls, war refugees had swollen the local slave
population to 7,005. While some blacks entering the county under these circumstances would,
after the war, return to the communities from which they had been recently uprooted, many more
would stay to build a new life in Grimes County.
The formal cessation of hostilities brought Grimes County residents new tribulations.
Recovery from the disastrous defeat was hampered by epidemics of cholera and yellow fever that
killed hundreds in 1866 and 1867. Furthermore, the war had scarcely ended before a violent
incident set the tone for much of the postwar history of the county. In May 1865, as Confederate
veterans straggling home congregated in Navasota, a number of soldiers, disgruntled by defeat
and the withholding of their pay, looted a warehouse filled with cotton and munitions. In the
process, the structure was set on fire, producing a tremendous explosion that demolished several
nearby edifices and set others ablaze. Before the fire had died, much of the town’s commercial

district had been damaged or destroyed. From 1865 to 1870, to help quell the spirit of lawlessness
beginning to manifest itself, federal troops were garrisoned at Millican in Brazos County, a few
miles northwest of Navasota, with jurisdiction over Brazos, Grimes, and other neighboring
counties. For at least part of this period, a company of soldiers was stationed at Anderson as
well. To assist the county’s large population of freedmen in their transition to citizenship, an office
of the Freedmen’s Bureau was established in June 1866. Most of Grimes County was placed
within the Bureau’s Twentieth Subdistrict, which was variously headquartered in Courtney,
Navasota, Millican, Anderson, and, finally, in Bryan in Brazos County. The Freedmen’s Bureau
established a court system to dispense justice to the former slaves, protected the freedmen in
their exercise of the franchise, and supervised the signing of labor contracts. Many of the first
educational institutions for African Americans established in the county were created during these
years by the Freedmen’s Bureau, which founded schools in Courtney, Anderson, and Navasota.
Reports filed by the subassistant commissioner describe a general breakdown of law and order
in Grimes and surrounding counties and make clear that while considerable violence was
perpetrated by whites against whites, blacks against blacks, and blacks against whites, most of
the violent crime in this period was committed by whites against blacks. Twenty-nine such
incidents, including 12 homicides, were reported in the county in 1867 alone. The authorities
seemed helpless to administer the laws, and few offenders were ever prosecuted. As the anarchy
deepened, armed bands of whites meted out vigilante justice; the Ku Klux Klan emerged in the
county at Navasota in April 1868. In self-defense, local blacks formed their own “militias.” The
secret activities of the county’s Loyal Leagues, organized among the freedmen by Republicans
as an agency of political indoctrination, inflamed white fears of black conspiracies against white
lives and property.
Despite the violence, the sheer size of the black population ensured that Grimes County
would become a stronghold of the Texas Republican party. The demographic impact of the war
refugees was conspicuous in the 1870 census, which revealed that although the county’s
population had grown by 22% to 13,218, most of the increase had occurred among blacks, who
now constituted virtually 60% of the county’s population. Though secessionists and former
Confederate officials won most of the offices of county government in the elections of 1866, the
military Reconstruction inaugurated in 1867 enabled local Republicans to quickly build their
strength. Edmund J. Davis, the Republican candidate for governor in 1869, carried the county
overwhelmingly. Even in 1873, when Richard Coke and the Democratic party defeated Davis and
“redeemed” the state from Republican rule, Grimes County remained solidly in the Republican
column. The loyalty of black voters would enable the local Republican party to retain considerable
influence for many years after the end of Reconstruction. Though Democrats reoccupied many
official positions after 1873, Republican candidates would continue to capture county offices, and,
under the party’s auspices, blacks from Grimes County would occupy eight seats in the state
legislature between 1871 and 1883. In only one presidential election from 1872 to 1900—that of
1892—did the county fail to return a Republican majority.
The postwar struggle of Grimes County blacks to establish vital social, economic, and
political institutions mirrored the efforts of the county’s white community to rebuild its own life in
the aftermath of a shattering defeat. In 1870, the county’s farms retained less than a third of their
1860 value. Though eight county residents had held property worth $100,000 in 1860, not a

single resident was that wealthy in 1870. Recovery would be slow. Not until 1910 would Grimes
County farms again be as valuable as they had been in 1860. Livestock production had suffered
a grave setback; there were only about half as many cattle in the county in 1870 and 1880 as
there had been before the war. As in the antebellum period, corn and cotton were again the
county’s most important crops. By 1890, both had exceeded their 1860 production levels, and
almost two-thirds of all cropland was planted in cotton. With farm ownership spread more widely
than before the war and with the number of farms continuing to increase by an average of 20%
each decade from 1870 to 1900, cotton cultivation expanded as well; the number of bales
produced rose steadily from 10,025 in 1870 to 11,761 in 1880 to 20,659 in 1890, before reaching
an all-time high in 1900 of 30,809. Cotton acreage expanded at a similar pace and would crest
only in 1930, when 81,937 acres were devoted to the staple. Farm tenancy and the crop-lien
system spread rapidly in postwar Grimes County. By 1880, tenants operated 64% of the farms
in the county, a figure that would remain constant until 1930, when it peaked at almost 69%. With
the Great Depression and ensuing shift away from staple crop production, tenantry began a
precipitous decline; in 1950, 44% of the county’s farmers were tenants; in 1969, only 10% were.
Transportation improvements were crucial in the development of the county’s postwar
economy. Grimes County acquired its second major railroad in 1883, when the Gulf, Colorado
and Santa Fe constructed a line from Somerville to Navasota. By 1896, the eastern end of this
line had been extended through Conroe into the East Texas pineywoods, facilitating the shipment
of lumber and other forest products through Navasota, which easily retained its position as the
county’s largest town, with a population of 3,857 in 1900. In that year, the International and Great
Northern Railroad completed the town’s third major railway, a branch line from Spring to Fort
Worth. In 1903, Anderson—the county’s second-largest town with a population of less than 600—
finally acquired its first railroad when the International and Great Northern extended its NavasotaMadisonville branch through the community. In 1907, the Trinity and Brazos Valley Railway
constructed a section of its Houston-to-Dallas line through the northern and eastern portions of
the county. The Grimes County road network remained in a primitive condition until 1930. That
year, the blacktopping of major thoroughfares began, with the construction of State Highway
(SH) 90 from Navasota to Madisonville.
Agricultural revival and transportation improvements helped attract a modest level of
migration to the county in the late 1800s. The Grimes County population stood at 18,603 in 1880,
after registering a 29% increase in the previous decade. Thereafter, the county population would
rise by 13% in the 1880s and by 18% in the 1890s, to crest at 26,106 in 1900, the highest figure
ever recorded there. As in the antebellum period, American-born settlers continued to arrive,
primarily from the states of Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Mississippi. At this time, however,
foreign-born immigrants became significant as well, enhancing the county’s ethnic and cultural
diversity. However, the foreign-born would never constitute more than 4% of the population.
Germans had been settling in Grimes County since at least 1851, when a number of families
established the community of Rodolph near Anderson. From the end of the Civil War right up
until World War I, fully half of the county’s foreign-born immigrants were born in Germany. They
tended to settle among the native inhabitants in all parts of the county, though a sizable German
enclave was established in and near Anderson. From the mid-1870s to the mid-1900s, hundreds
of Poles took up residence in the county, most of them settling in the vicinity either of Anderson

40

or of Plantersville and Stoneham in the southern portion of the county. By 1890, the newcomers
had constructed the county’s first Catholic and Lutheran churches and its first synagogue. With
emigration of blacks in the early 1900s greatly reducing the local labor force, large numbers of
Mexican migrant workers found employment in the county during and after World War I. Many
stayed, so that Mexicans became the most numerous of the foreign-born groups settling in the
county until 1940. These several hundred Mexican-born residents did not constitute a large
segment of the county population during the mid-1900s, but as the county’s population continued
to decline after World War II, the Mexican-American population became more prominent. By
1990, an estimated 1,767 residents, just over 10% of the county population, were of Hispanic
origin.
During the 1870s, the persistent credit and marketing difficulties afflicting Southern
agriculture began to spawn agrarian radicalism in Grimes County. In the late 1870s, Grange
organizations were formed at Courtney and Anderson, and the Greenback party became a force
in local politics. In the early 1880s, an interracial Republican-Greenback coalition succeeded in
electing candidates to a number of county offices. The insurgency died in the mid-1880s with the
demise of the Greenback party but was revived in 1892 when the increasingly radical Southern
Farmers’ Alliance, which had organized several Grimes County local alliances in the late 1880s,
transformed itself into the People’s party. The Populists courted black voters by raising the
inadequate salaries of black schoolteachers and by hiring black deputies in the sheriff’s
department. Many of the county’s black Republicans promptly joined the new insurgent
movement, which was assailed by the local Democratic press as a species of “radical Negroism.”
After smashing victories by the People’s party in the county elections of 1896 and 1898, Grimes
County Democrats retaliated by forming the White Man’s Union, an initially secret, oath-bound
society designed to end electoral “corruption” by excluding blacks from participation in county
politics. The White Man’s Union launched a campaign of night-riding and intimidation of Populist
voters and orchestrated the murder of several black Populist leaders. The local white Populist
sheriff, wounded by an armed mob on the streets of Anderson, was evacuated to Houston by an
escort of state militia. With terrorized Populists avoiding the polls, the White Man’s Union swept
the elections of 1900, and blacks began a mass migration from the county. The White Man’s
Union proceeded to select every officer of the county government until 1958. By 1910, the black
exodus had reduced the Grimes County black population by more than 30% to 9,858. Though
that figure remained roughly constant until 1930, black migration resumed during the Great
Depression, impelled by the decline of agricultural tenantry. It then accelerated during the 1940s,
when the lure of new defense-related employment in urban areas of Texas generated another
30% decrease in the black population. Blacks continued to leave Grimes County throughout the
post-World War II period, until by 1990 only 3,988 remained (23% of the total population). The
violence unleashed against Populists during the election of 1900 proved difficult to contain. Years
of prolonged vigilantism and lawlessness in the early 1900s earned Grimes County a “rough”
reputation, which was only enhanced by the local reemergence of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s.
In 1908, Navasota hired noted Texas Ranger Frank Hamer as its sheriff in an effort to “clean up”
the town. Another largely ineffectual attempt to curb the violence was made in November 1905,
when the county voted itself dry in a local-option election.

H146-170124

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

As the Grimes County black population declined in the 20th century, so did the overall
population. A 19% decrease in county population between 1900 and 1910 was almost entirely
attributable to the black exodus. Though the county registered an 8% increase in population
between 1910 and 1920 (a decade of agricultural prosperity), with the return of harder economic
conditions in the 1920s and 1930s, the Grimes County population declined again by an average
of almost 3% per decade. The few available unemployment statistics from the 1930s suggest the
magnitude of the loss of agricultural employment in this period; 1,422 county residents were either
unemployed or on relief work in 1937, indicating an unemployment rate of perhaps 16% or more.
The emigration of county residents accelerated during the 1940s; during the decade population
fell by more than 31%, to 15,135, as residents found desperately needed employment in defense
industries in urban areas, especially nearby Houston. Though the population decrease slowed
during the 1950s and 1960s, it was not reversed until 1970, by which time the county’s population
had fallen to 11,855, only 45% of the 1900 figure. In a sense, the decline was the price paid for
the fact that the county remained overwhelmingly agricultural and rural in character until the late
20th century. During the 1800s, industry in the county was confined almost exclusively to cotton
ginning and lumber processing. Until the 20th century, manufacturing in a given year never
employed more than 152 county residents, a pinnacle reached in 1890. By 1930, there were
15 manufacturing establishments in the county, employing 158 persons, with a product valued at
more than $1 million. During the Great Depression, however, cotton cultivation, the lifeblood of
the county’s nascent industrial sector, was drastically curtailed, and by 1940 only six
manufacturing establishments remained.
Agriculture has continued to be the preeminent economic activity in Grimes County but
has undergone several transformations in the 20th century. The problems of overproduction and
falling prices during the Great Depression reduced cotton acreage in the county by 53% between
1930 and 1940, to 38,726 acres; the 1940 yield of 16,031 bales was little more than half of that
of 1900. Acreage planted in cotton continued to fall precipitously over the next three decades, so
that although 13,520 bales were still being produced annually as late as 1959, by the 1970s cotton
cultivation in the county had ceased entirely. As cotton growing declined, stock raising expanded
in scope to become the most important agricultural activity in the county. The number of cattle
raised annually reached a post-Civil War peak of 37,785 in 1890, then remained at about that
level until 1940. Between 1940 and 1969, cattle production increased by an average of almost
25% a decade to stand at a historical pinnacle of 79,094 in 1969. Although production dropped
slightly during the two succeeding decades, there were still 50,637 cattle raised in the county in
1987. Dairy farming has been an important agricultural specialty in Grimes County since the late
1800s. There were 65 dairy farms in the county in 1982, and milk and beef remain the most
important livestock products in a county that derives 93% of its agricultural revenues from
livestock. Like cattle raising, hog raising also has continued on a substantial scale since the
1800s, though the number of hogs produced in 1987, 1,507, represents an 88% decline in
production since 1920. Sheep raising was significant in the county through most of its history but
declined in the 1900s. During the 20th century, annual production has seldom approached
2,000 head; in 1987, the figure stood at 1,507. Poultry was raised extensively in the county from
the mid-1800s to the mid-1900s, but annual production fell by 48% during the 1950s and then by
77% from 1960 to 1970, by which time its value was only $10,000.

Crop cultivation, though accounting for only a small proportion of the county’s agricultural
wealth, has become more diversified since the decline of cotton culture. Corn remained one of
Grimes County’s most important crops from the beginning of the county’s history until 1982, when
more than 150,000 bushels were harvested. Between 1982 and 1987, however, corn acreage
dwindled from 3,100 acres to 166, and production plummeted to only 7,623 bushels. As stock
raising has expanded since the Depression, so has the cultivation of hay, increasing from
1,812 acres and 2,364 tons in 1930 to 27,158 acres and 67,626 tons in 1987. Peanuts were
grown on a modest scale from 1900 until 1930, with annual yields averaging only about
10,000 bushels.
Over the two succeeding decades, peanut cultivation expanded;
327,409 pounds were harvested in 1940 and 215,331 pounds in 1950. Thereafter, however,
production declined sharply, and had disappeared entirely by the 1970s. In recent decades, cane
sorghum, various small grains, watermelons, pecans, Christmas trees, and vegetables such as
the potato, sweet potato, and soybean have been cultivated in the county on a limited scale.
Beekeeping has been of commercial significance in the county since the 1880s, and a number of
apiaries remained in production in the 1980s.
Since World War II, a modest industrial sector has developed in Grimes County, led by
extractive industries. With almost 40% of the county covered by forest, the processing of lumber
has been an important economic activity throughout its history; sawmills stand second only to
cotton gins in the story of the county’s early industrial development. The value of annual timber
production rose sharply during the 1980s, exceeding $10.5 million in 1987. Petroleum was
discovered in Grimes County in 1952, but until the late 1970s only token quantities were
recovered. In the early 1980s, production of both crude oil and natural gas increased dramatically,
and by the late 1980s almost a half million barrels of oil were being pumped annually. Almost
267,000 barrels of oil and 21,337,795 cubic feet of gas-well gas were produced in the county in
2004; by the end of that year, 18,220,020 barrels of oil had been taken from county lands since
1952. Lignite began to be mined in the county in the early 1980s, when the Texas Municipal
Power Agency (TMPA) constructed its 400-megawatt, lignite-powered Gibbons Creek Steam
Electric Station. The TMPA facilities near Carlos, which include a 2,500-acre cooling reservoir on
Gibbons Creek, provided employment for 250 county residents.
Stimulated in large measure by the growth of extractive industries, a small manufacturing
base developed in the county, with fabricated metal products and machinery leading the advance.
Between 1967 and 1982, the number of manufacturing establishments increased from 18 to 27,
while the number of persons employed in manufacturing rose in the same period from 200 to
1,400. Most of this new industrial capacity developed within the town of Navasota, which
continued to exercise a dominant influence on the economic, social, and political life of the county.
Navasota, with an estimated population of 6,637 in 1990, had become an agribusiness center for
portions of three counties. Anderson, long the second-largest town in the county, remained a
local marketing center but, with an estimated population in 1990 of 320, had slipped to third place
in size behind Iola, which became a focus of oil-drilling activity in the 1970s and 1980s and by
1990 had an estimated population of 331. In the early 1980s, a community of a different sort was
created almost overnight when the Texas Department of Corrections constructed two large prison
farms, Pack Unit I and II, in the southern portion of the county east of Courtney. In addition to
their agricultural activities, the facilities by 1983 operated a stainless steel factory with its

1,500 inmates. The drive toward economic diversification that had begun after World War II finally
enabled the county to reverse the long and virtually uninterrupted population decline it had
suffered since 1900. During the 1970s, the population of Grimes County grew by almost 13%, to
13,580, the first decennial increase since 1920. Growth accelerated in the next decade, which
saw the population rise almost 28%, to 18,828 in 1990. Moreover, during the 1980s, the county’s
black population grew for the first time since the late 19th century, increasing by more than 5%.
Though the White Man’s Union was dissolved in the 1950s, the citizens of Grimes County
remained steadfast in their allegiance to the Democratic party; through the late 1980s, the county
had not voted to fill a state office with a Republican since the 19th century. As recently as 1982,
fully 97% of county voters participating in party primaries chose the Democratic primary. By the
mid-1990s, however, Republican candidates were competitive in Grimes County races for state
offices, and by 2000 the area’s voters overwhelmingly favored Republican candidates for those
offices. This Republican ascendancy at the local level had been presaged by the county’s
increasing willingness to vote for Republican presidential candidates. The county returned
majorities for Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956 and favored the Republican presidential
candidate again in 1972, 1984, and 1988. In 1992 and 1996, Democrat Bill Clinton won slim
pluralities of the area’s voters, partly because Independent candidate Ross Perot ran well in the
county in those elections. In 2000 and 2004, however, Republican George W. Bush took the
county with comfortable majorities

Historical Background of Brazos County, Texas

The territory that is now Brazos County was included in Stephen F. Austin’s second colony
and became part of Washington Municipality under the Mexican government.2 Colonists who
sought plantation sites on the Brazos between 1821 and 1831 included Elliot McNeil Millican,
Richard Carter, James H. Evetts, Melvan Lanham, Lee C. Smith, and Mordecai Boon. In 1837,
most of the area of present-day Brazos County was included in Washington County. The Brazos
River, which bisected the latter, proved a serious obstacle to county government, and a new
county, Navasota, was formed in January 1841. The first court, with Judge R.E.B. Baylor
presiding, was held later that year in the home of Joseph Ferguson, 22.5 kilometers (14.0 miles)
west of the site of present Bryan. The county seat, named Boonville for Mordecai Boon, was
located on John Austin’s league and was surveyed by Hiram Hanover in 1841. In January of the
following year, Navasota County was renamed Brazos County. The 1850 census showed
466 whites and 148 black slaves in the county. Of the approximately 176,000 acres in farms at
that time, less than 2,000 acres was cleared for crops. Farmers concentrated on growing corn
and a bit of cotton. The county remained overwhelmingly rural in the 1850s; only two families
lived in the county seat in 1852, and only two post offices, Boonville and Millican, operated in the
county in 1856.
In 1860, growth in the county was speeded by the arrival of the Houston and Texas Central
Railroad, with Millican as its terminus. By that year, the county had some 14,509 acres under
cultivation, and cotton production had increased from 142 bales in 1850 to 2,269 bales. On the

eve of the Civil War, Brazos County had a mixed economy of small farms and a few larger
plantations, with a population of 1,713 whites and 1,063 slaves. Of the 118 slaveholders in the
county, 77 owned fewer than five slaves, and only four owned more than 50. The county voted
215 to 44 for secession in 1861 and mobilized its inhabitants for the war. The railhead at Millican
became an important transportation center for the Confederate war effort, and a training camp
was established nearby in 1861. Local men formed companies or parts of companies in the
Twenty-first and Twenty-fifth Texas Cavalry regiments, the Tenth Texas Infantry regiment, and
other army units, and participated in various home and state guard units. During the war, the
Brazos County Commissioners Court acted to gather supplies for the Confederacy and assist the
indigent families of men serving in the armed forces.
Federal troops arrived in Millican in June 1865, when Brazos County began almost eight
years of Reconstruction turmoil. County blacks and white landowners struggled to work out their
new economic and social relations, and a series of Freedmen’s Bureau agents, occasionally
backed by small numbers of federal soldiers, attempted to mediate between the groups. While
black children attended school for the first time at Millican and at Wilson’s Plantation, whites and
blacks quarreled constantly over labor contracts, and interracial violence became increasingly
common. This strife reached its peak in the Millican race riot of 1868. The Ku Klux Klan made
its first appearance in the county in June of that year, when a group of masked men paraded
through the black neighborhood in Millican. Armed blacks fired at the Klan members, drove them
off, and organized a militia company under the leadership of George Brooks, a black clergyman
who had also been active in registering black voters and was much hated by some white county
residents. In July, false rumors spread among the black community of Millican that a local black
leader, Miles Brown, had been lynched by whites. Escalating tensions on both sides eventually
led to several armed confrontations between groups of whites and blacks that left at least six
blacks dead, including Brooks.
Brazos County politics was also tumultuous in the postwar period. Immediately after the
war, during the presidential phase of Reconstruction, former Confederates were allowed to hold
local office and the prewar political structure of the county remained unchanged. At the end of
1867, many officeholders were removed from office by federal authorities as part of the new
policies of congressional Reconstruction, and by the following year the county was dominated by
the Republican party. Powerful local families like the Millicans, who were leaders in the
Democratic party, and the Myerses, who were prominent Republicans, engaged in questionable
voting practices and occasional violence in the struggle to control county politics. By the time of
the gubernatorial election of 1873, Brazos County was once again Democratic by a slim majority.
Blacks continued to hold office on the county commissioners’ court through the 1880s, and one
county black, Elias Mayes, served in the Texas House of Representatives in 1879 and 1889. In
1890, local white Democrats instituted a “White Man’s Campaign” similar to the white primary
movement in other counties, which acted to disfranchise black voters. The Republican party
remained a force in county elections for a time, and Brazos County voted for Republican
presidential candidates in 1888 and 1896. From the election of 1900 until the 1950s, however,
the county remained solidly Democratic. Subsequently, county voters supported Republican
presidential candidates in 1952 and 1956 and from 1968 through 2004.

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

While county residents worked out the social and political problems left by the Civil War,
the county prospered and grew. In 1866, the Houston and Texas Central Railroad resumed
construction past Millican, and county citizens voted to make a site on the railroad line, the new
community of Bryan, the county seat. Both Millican and the former county seat, Boonville,
declined rapidly as their inhabitants moved themselves, their goods, and in some cases, the
lumber from their homes and stores to Bryan. By 1870, Brazos County had 9,205 inhabitants,
more than a three-fold increase since 1860. Cotton production had also tripled since 1860, and
for the first time county ranchers raised cattle and hogs in substantial numbers. Sheep ranching
reached an all-time county record in 1870, when 8,565 sheep were counted, in contrast to only
219 in 1860.
Population growth continued at a more modest rate in the next few decades, reaching
13,576 in 1880 and 16,650 in 1890. The black population of the county increased more rapidly
than the white, growing from 3,759 in 1870 to 6,250 in 1880. In 1890, the number of African
Americans reached 8,845, and for the only time in its history the county had a black majority.
Beginning in the 1870s, substantial numbers of Germans, Austrians, and Czechs (Bohemians)
migrated to the county, and Italians began arriving in the 1880s. In 1900, the county population
reached 18,859. Of the 10,005 white residents that year, 1,403, or 14%, were foreign-born,
including 553 from Italy, 239 from Germany, and 223 from Bohemia. Settlement and economic
growth were hastened in the county by transportation developments in the last decades of the
19th century. In the 1880s, the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway built through the southern
part of the county and the Hearne and Brazos Valley Railway built through the northwest. In
1900, the International-Great Northern built through to Bryan, and in 1910 the Bryan and College
Station Interurban Railway was started between Bryan and Texas A&M College.
In the last decades of the 19th century and the early years of the 20th century, cotton
increasingly dominated county agriculture. Acres planted with cotton grew from 28,044 in 1880
to almost 44,000 in 1890 and to an all-time high of 72,275, about a third of all improved acres in
the county, in 1910. About half the cotton acreage was usually allotted to corn, the second major
crop in the county. The county also followed the general Southern pattern of large numbers of
small farms, many of them worked by tenants and sharecroppers. The number of farms increased
from 666 in 1870 to 1,630 in 1880 and 2,088 in 1890. In 1900, of the 2,613 farms in the county,
1,576, or 60%, were worked by tenants and sharecroppers. Black farmers were much less likely
to own land than their white counterparts. In 1900, more than half of the white farmers owned
their own farms, while only 20% of black farmers were owners. In 1920, the number of farms
reached a peak of 3,023, and the number of tenant farmers reached its zenith at 1,939, or 64%.
As a percentage of the total cropland harvested, cotton land probably reached its peak in 1930,
when more than 64,000 of the 88,224 acres harvested was used to grow cotton. Thereafter,
county farming began to change in response to changing technologies and opportunities. During
the Great Depression, much of the rural workforce left the county to seek work in the cities of
Texas or left the state entirely. By 1940, the number of farms had fallen to 1,773, comparable to
the number of farms back in 1880. Mechanized farming began in the bottomlands of the county
along the rivers in the late 1920s and slowly spread to other parts of the county. With the loss of
even more of the rural labor supply after World War II, farmers consolidated their holdings and
turned to tractors, mechanical cotton harvesters, and other machines to work their fields.

During the 20th century, Bryan and College Station played an increasingly important role
in the life of the county. After its founding as a railroad town in 1866, Bryan slowly grew to a
community of 3,589 in 1900, when approximately one-fifth of county residents lived there. The
nearby community of College Station, which grew around Texas A&M University after its founding
in the 1870s, numbered only 391 inhabitants in 1900. Both communities grew steadily, and by
1940 they had a combined population of 14,026; at that time, more than half of the county
population lived in the two communities. As the county population continued to grow—to 38,390
in 1950, 57,978 in 1970 and 93,588 in 1980—the urban population continued to grow both
absolutely and in relation to the rural population. In 1980, the 81,506 inhabitants of Bryan-College
Station were 87% of the residents of Brazos County. Significant industries that developed in the
two-city area in the later 20th century included defense electronics and varied manufacturing.
At the same time, that the county was becoming more urban, the building of a network of
rural roads in the 1930s and 1940s transformed the Brazos County countryside. As late as 1930,
the great majority of the county’s farms, 2,100 of 2,439, were located on dirt roads. Twenty years
later, only 538 were still on dirt roads. Similarly, though only 48 farms had electricity in 1930, rural
electrification brought power to most of the county’s farms by the early 1960s. Starting in the
1960s, as Texas A&M University embarked on a major expansion program, and much of the rural
land in the vicinity of Bryan-College Station was brought into the suburban orbit of the two cities.
By the mid-20th century, county farmers had increasingly turned away from the old agricultural
staples of corn and cotton and had moved on to cattle ranching. In the 1980s, cotton was
generally grown on approximately 12,000 acres, which represented only 15% of the acreage used
for cotton in 1925. The number of cattle in the county increased from 25,354 in 1940 to 42,545
in 1950 and fluctuated between 45,000 and 57,000 through the 1980s. As part of the shift to
cattle, feed crops of hay, oats, and wheat became more important in the county in the decades
following 1950. Oil, first discovered in the county in 1942, became an important part of the county
economy in the 1970s, and by 1990 a total of 73,427,789 barrels had been produced. Almost
2,215,000 barrels of oil and 6,807,187 cubic feet of gas-well gas were produced in the county in
2004; by the end of that year 137,027,692 barrels of oil had been taken from county lands since
1942.
In 1982, 67% of the land was in farms and ranches, with 18% of the farmland under
cultivation and 20% irrigated. Primary crops were hay, cotton, sorghum, oats, and wheat, and
primary livestock and products were cattle, hogs, and milk. The industries with the most
employment were agribusiness, oil and gas extraction, and construction. In 1980, Brazos County
was one of the most densely populated counties in the state. Of its 94,492 inhabitants, the largest
ancestry groups were English and German. The black population of the county, which had
remained relatively static at about 9,000 for most of the century, began to increase in the 1970s
and was 10,350 in 1980. Significant Hispanic migration to the county began in the second half of
the 20th century; by 1980, Hispanic residents numbered 9,455. In 1990, the county had 121,862
residents.

Historical Background of Robertson County, Texas

The first European to set foot in the area of future Robertson County was probably
Domingo Terán de los Ríos, who passed through the region on his way to Northeast Texas in
1690.3. In 1716, Domingo Ramón traversed the area as he traveled across Texas to found
Spanish missions in East Texas. Although occasional groups of priests or soldiers stopped in the
area on their trek to resupply the missions of East Texas, no permanent settlements were made
during the Spanish period. Following the Mexican War of Independence, Anglo-American interest
in the area grew. In 1822, a group of buffalo hunters camped at the Brazos crossing of the Old
San Antonio Road, and in 1823 six families from Kentucky built a temporary settlement at the
mouth of the Little River. The same year, Sterling C. Robertson, his cousin Felix Robertson, and
several other Tennesseeans representing the Texas Association of Nashville explored the area
with the view of eventually colonizing it. On April 15, 1825, Robert Leftwich, acting as agent for
the Texas Association, received a contract from the Mexican government to settle 800 families in
an area bounded on the south by the Old San Antonio Road, on the north by the Comanche
Trace, on the east by the Navasota River, and on the west by the watershed separating the Brazos
and Colorado rivers. Leftwich, however, received the grant in his own name and, upon his return
to Nashville, was forced to resign and sell his interest to the investment group. In 1826, Felix
Robertson, who served as president of the group, led a party of 30 Tennesseeans to Texas,
establishing a camp at the mouth of the Little Brazos. However, attempts to colonize the area
were stalled by the outbreak of the Fredonian Rebellion and by land claims made by squatters
who had moved into the area between 1824 and 1826. In 1827, the Mexican government
approved the transfer of Leftwich’s grant to the Texas Association and substituted another
member of the group, Hosea H. League, as empresario. Under the new contract, the grant
boundaries were expanded to include an area second in size only to Stephen F. Austin’s. League
subsequently established an office at San Felipe de Austin and awaited the arrival of families
recruited to settle in the colony but was implicated as an accomplice in a local murder and jailed.
Sterling C. Robertson replaced League, officially assuming authority as the company’s agent on
October 10, 1830. Robertson’s attempts to bring settlers into the area, however, were hampered
by the Law of April 6, 1830, which suspended the operation of the colony’s contract for four years.
In 1831, Stephen F. Austin petitioned the Mexican government for a grant covering the
land previously awarded the Texas Association. A new contract issued by Mexican authorities
conveyed to Austin and his new partner, Samuel May Williams, the right to colonize the area
previously granted to Robertson and his group. Robertson challenged Austin’s action, first in the
local courts and later in the Texas legislature. Both the court and legislature sustained
Robertson’s claims, and the government voided the Austin-Williams contract, recognizing the land
titles of the Nashville company. Nevertheless the episode began a legal battle to clear land titles
in Robertson County that continued until it was finally settled by the Texas Supreme Court in
1847. During the early 1830s, Sterling Robertson worked tirelessly to make the project a reality.
He made numerous trips to and from Texas, recruiting and escorting settlers to the area. In many
instances, Robertson put up his own money to finance the venture, which came to be called

Robertson’s colony. Despite continued legal battles and other obstacles, small groups of
colonists began to gradually settle in the area. In 1832, James Dunn constructed a fort at a site
later known as Old Cobb Prairie, and the following year the settlement of Wheelock was
established. During the Runaway Scrape in 1836, much of the area was abandoned, but after
the Texan victory at the Battle of San Jacinto, it was quickly reoccupied.
On December 14, 1837, the First Texas Congress passed a measure establishing
Robertson County from portions of Milam, Bexar, and Nacogdoches counties and naming it in
honor of Sterling Robertson. When the county was organized the following year, the settlement
of Franklin (usually referred to as Old Franklin today to differentiate it from the present-day county
seat also named Franklin), which served as headquarters for surveyors of a land district including
present Leon, Freestone, Limestone, Navarro, and other counties, became the county seat. Over
the next nine years, 16 counties were carved from its original jurisdiction, and the county only
assumed its present-day limits in 1846. In 1850, the county residents voted to move the county
seat from Old Franklin to Wheelock because the town was closer to the most heavily populated
areas of the area. Six years later, the county seat was once again moved, this time to a new
town, Owensville, near the geographical center of the county, where it remained until after the
Civil War. During the mid-1830s, Robertson County was the scene of numerous battles between
Anglo-American settlers and Indians. Among the most famous was the May 19, 1836, attack on
Fort Parker during which Cynthia Ann Parker, mother of Chief Quanah Parker, was taken captive.
The Indian raids, however, began to abate after 1838, when a company of Texas Rangers
commanded by Eli Chandler was stationed at Old Franklin. By the time Texas joined the US in
1846, the frontier had pushed farther west, and Indian raids in Robertson County had become
infrequent.
During the 1840s, the number of settlers increased slowly; as late as 1850, the population
was only 934. However, during the next decade, numerous new settlers arrived to take advantage
of the fertile bottomland along the Brazos and Navasota rivers. In just 10 years, from 1850 to
1860, the population grew more than five-fold, surging to 4,997. Most of new residents were from
the Old South, and many of them brought their slaves with them. During the same decade, the
slave population grew from 264 to 2,258. By 1860, 40% of the county’s families owned one or
more slaves, and two of the state’s largest slaveholders, B.F. Hammond and Reuben Anderson,
each of whom owned 100 or more slaves, lived in the county. The first farms in the county were
on the upland prairies; however, as the population increased and the Indian threat abated,
growing numbers of settlers moved into the bottomlands. Between 1835 and 1840, a number of
large landowners, including Andrew Cavitt, Liston Purdy, Joseph Webb, and James R. Robertson,
established plantations in the Brazos valley. Although cotton was grown as early as 1840,
subsistence farming continued to be the rule throughout the decade of 1840s. By the early 1850s,
a thriving plantation economy, based largely on cotton, had begun to emerge. Between 1850 and
1860, the cotton crop increased from 429 to 6,467 bales. The last antebellum decade also
witnessed a tripling in corn production, and a five-fold increase in the value of livestock. On the
eve of the Civil War, Robertson County was in most ways typical of the counties of the region,
decidedly Southern in character and outlook, with a rapidly developing plantation economy. Not
surprisingly given the large number of slaveholders, the county residents staunchly supported the
Southern cause, and nearly 85% (391 of 467) of those who went to the polls cast their votes in

H146-170124

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

favor of secession. Robertson County’s men also volunteered for the Confederate army in large
numbers. Company C, Fourth Texas Regiment, Hood's Texas Brigade, which fought at Gaines
Mill, Second Manassas, the Wilderness, Gettysburg, and Chickamauga, was largely recruited in
Robertson County. To further support the Confederate cause, Robertson County residents
supplied beef and grains to the rebel army, and a number of planters raised the necessary funds
to begin construction of a textile and flour mill near the site of present-day Hearne. Ironically, the
war years brought the county unprecedented prosperity. The number of slaves more than
doubled (from 1,955 to 4,392), as planters from Arkansas and Louisiana relocated there to protect
their slaves from confiscation and prevent them from escaping to the Union lines. This growing
labor pool helped to open new land for cotton and boosted production, feeding the growing
wartime cotton trade with Mexico. The war’s aftermath, however, brought profound changes.
Although spared the wartime devastation seen in much of the rest of the Confederacy, Robertson
County, like most other Texas counties, felt the stinging effects of the postwar depression. For
many of the whites, the abolition of slavery meant tremendous economic loss. Prior to the Civil
War, slaves had constituted nearly half of all taxable property in the county, and their loss, coupled
with a general decline in property values, caused a profound disruption for most planters. The
African-American population of the county fared even worse. Most blacks left the farms owned
by their former masters to seek better working and living conditions, but for the vast majority, the
change brought only marginal improvement. Most ended up working as agricultural laborers or
as sharecroppers, receiving one-third or one-half of the crop for their labors. The economic
conditions forced blacks into dismal living conditions, and, in many instances, they became
objects of violence by white vigilantes.
During Reconstruction, blacks, supported by white Republican allies, managed to briefly
exercise political power. On July 12, 1870, the Republican-controlled Twelfth Legislature, in a
political move to retain Republican political control of local government in Robertson County,
voted to relocate the county seat from Owensville to Calvert. However, whites gradually regained
the upper hand in the early 1870s and, over the course of the next decade, using intimidation and
occasional force, managed to effectively disenfranchise most of the African-American population.
Nevertheless, in several areas, such as Hearne and Calvert, where there were substantial black
majorities, African Americans continued to resist white political domination well into the 1890s.
The 1896 elections signaled the return to white supremacy in Robertson County. Whites stood
guard at the various polling places throughout the county with rifles, pistols, and sticks, turning
away blacks who ventured forth to vote. Following this election black voters failed to return to the
polls. Besides intimidation and harassment, the poll tax and White Primary effectively
disfranchised the county’s black population. County voting totals plummeted; 5,500 citizens cast
their votes in 1896, but less than 1,500 returned to the polls in 1904. Despite the havoc wrought
by the war and Reconstruction, the county began to recover by the late 1860s, in large part due
to a rapid increase in population. Between 1860 and 1870, the number of inhabitants doubled,
increasing from 4,997 to 9,990; in the following decade, it more than doubled again, rising to
22,383 in 1880. One reason for the rapid increase in population was a steady influx of white
farmers from the states of the Old South, attracted to the county by its abundance of rich and
relatively inexpensive land. Even more significant for the rapid growth was a steady rise in the
number of black residents. Because of the shortage of labor that followed the Civil War, Brazos

50

valley farmers traveled to parts of the Old South to recruit black farm hands, who arrived in large
numbers over the next decade and a half. As a result, by the 1880s blacks accounted for a
majority of the population (53%), a position they would continue to occupy until the turn of the
century.
Also spurring the postwar recovery was construction of the Houston and Texas Central
Railway, which built through the county in the late 1860s. Although a number of towns declined
or were abandoned after being bypassed by the railroad, including Wheelock, Owensville,
Nashville, Sterling, Staggers Point, Mount Vernon, Little Mississippi, and Port Sullivan, many
other communities were founded or began to flourish. In 1878, residents voted to move the county
seat to Morgan, on the railroad near the geographical center of the county. When application was
made for a post office, the town was renamed Franklin in honor of the original county seat. In
1880, the International-Great Northern was linked with the Houston and Texas Central at Hearne,
making it an important rail center. The coming of the railroads and the steady growth in population
led to a resurgence of the county’s agricultural economy. Over the next three decades, both the
amount of acreage under cultivation and overall production steadily increased. Cotton, corn, and
cattle, which had formed the mainstays of the economy after 1850, continued to be the leading
products through the second half of the 19th century. While agricultural output steadily increased,
however, Robertson County did not escape the hard times experienced by Southern farmers in
the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Falling cotton prices and depleted soils reduced profits.
To compensate for their shrinking income, large planters increased the acreage allotted to cotton
production, and sharecroppers and tenants were forced to do likewise. Acreage in the county
devoted to cotton cultivation rose steadily from 50,000 acres in 1880 to 150,000 acres in 1925.
Yet, despite this three-fold increase in acreage, production barely doubled. Nevertheless,
Robertson County farmers annually ginned 30,000 bales from the 1890s until the Great
Depression. Corn production ran a poor second. Farmers allocated 34,000 acres to corn
production in 1880 and 50,000 in 1910. Production increased, but at a much slower rate. Stock
raising, on the other hand, continued to dominate the upland prairies of the county. As in much
of the South, sharecropping replaced slavery as the dominant labor system on Robertson County
plantations following the Civil War. Large tracts were divided into small parcels that were let to
former slaves, poor whites, or immigrants on a sharecrop basis. By 1910, only 29% of all farmers
owned the land they worked, while over 60% were tenant farmers. By 1930, three out every four
farmers (2,936 of 4,065) were tenants. The combination of declining yields and tenancy kept
many farmers in permanent debt and brought widespread misery. The harsh conditions led to a
decline in population after 1900, as a sizeable number of families left to seek better opportunities
elsewhere. Between 1900 and 1910, the population of the county fell by more than 4,000, from
31,480 to 27,454. Contributing most to this decline was the flight of many of the large rural black
population, who left to find work in the cities of the North. The black exodus, combined with a
small influx of whites (mostly recent European immigrants) after 1900, brought an end to the
period of black majority; by 1920, blacks made up only 40% of the population, and by 1950 that
figure fell below 30%. Like most of the state, Robertson County was hit hard by the Great
Depression of the 1930s. Particularly affected were the county’s farmers, who were forced to
endure the combined effects of falling prices, soil depletion, and boll weevil infestations. Those
with large landholdings were able to weather the hard times, but many of the county’s legions of

H146-170124

51

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

tenant farmers and sharecroppers were forced off the land. Between 1930 and 1940, the number
of farms in the county fell sharply, from 4,065 to 2,834, and the number of tenants fell by more
than half, from 2,936 to 1,693.
Prosperity began to return by the eve of World War II, when both demand and prices for
agricultural products increased. Oil was discovered in the county in 1944, providing additional
income for some landowners. Since World War II, the agricultural scene has seen marked
changes. During the late 1940s and 1950s, many farmers continued to emphasize cotton farming;
however, in the 1960s, farming was increasingly replaced by ranching. By the 1970s, livestock
raising, particularly of beef and dairy cattle, hogs, horses, and poultry, had taken center stage.
For the next two decades, the majority of the county’s agricultural income was from livestock and
livestock products. In the years after World War II, the population of Robertson County continued
to decline. Between 1940 and 1970, the number of inhabitants fell steadily, from 25,710 in 1940
to 14,389 in 1970. After that, however, the population increased slightly to 14,653 in 1980 and
15,511 in 1990. Hearne, with a population of 5,132, was the largest community in 1990, followed
by Calvert (1,536), Franklin (1,336), and Bremond (1,110). The majority of the population was
white (65%), with blacks (28%) and Hispanics (12% percent) forming the largest minorities.
Religion has been important to the citizens of Robertson County since the earliest settlers
arrived. Methodist circuit-riding ministers traveled the frontier as early as 1835; the reverends
Isaac Addison and Robert Alexander were among the first to visit the area. In 1840, a formal
circuit ministry, the Nashville Mission, was established and Robert Crawford, a San Jacinto
veteran and later a Mier Expedition participant, served in the area. Z.N. Morrell, Baptist
missionary and author of Flowers and Fruits from the Wilderness (1872), arrived just prior to
Texas’s move for independence. Morrell headed the Baptist missionary effort in the region
throughout the 1840s. The first Union Church was founded at Wheelock just before the Civil War.
Union churches accepted ministers from almost any denomination in their pulpits. The county
was the scene of frequent camp meetings both before and after the Civil War. Following the war,
an Episcopal church was established in Calvert headed by the Reverend J. Wilkins Tray. Catholic
churches arrived with the railroad in the 1870s to serve the Irish workmen who built and operated
the railroads and, later, to minister to the Polish immigrants who settled at Bremond. St. Mary’s
Catholic Church was located in Hearne during the 1870s, and another church by the same name
was established in Bremond in 1888. Methodist and Baptist churches continue to be the
predominant Protestant groups in the county today, although a number of other denominations
also maintain congregations.
The county’s first school, Franklin Academy, was organized in Old Franklin in 1838, and,
in the years prior to the Civil War, several churches operated private schools. The first public
schools opened in the late 1850s. During the Civil War, public education was suspended, but in
1867 eight public schools reopened, and in 1868 the county court passed a measure establishing
the first school districts. Since that time, the county education system has seen various changes
and consolidations. In the early 1990s, there were five school districts, with six elementary, one
middle, and four high schools. Average daily attendance was 2,800. Education levels have
traditionally been quite low in the county but have seen some improvement during the second half

of the 20th century. However, many of the county’s best educated young people continue to leave
to seek better opportunities elsewhere.
In the early 1990s, Robertson County’s economy was still closely tied to agriculture, and
ranching and farming were the leading industries. Beef and dairy cattle were the largest source
of income. Leading crops included cotton, sorghums, small grains, watermelons, and corn.
Leading industries were agribusinesses, brick manufacturing, and a power-generating plant.
Other important sources of revenue included oil and natural gas and lignite mining.
Politically, Robertson County has been staunchly in the Democratic camp for most of its
history. Since the end of Reconstruction, Democratic presidential candidates have won nearly
every election. From 1960 through 2000, the only Republican presidential candidate to win a
majority of votes was Richard Nixon, who outpolled George McGovern by a single ballot in 1972.
Democrats also maintained control of the local offices and have generally fared well in statewide
races. In the early 21st century, however, Republicans began to be more competitive in local
elections. George W. Bush took the county in the 2004 presidential election with about 55% of
the vote.
In 2014, the census counted 16,500 people living in Robertson County. About 59% were
Anglo, 21% were African American, and 19% were Hispanic. Seventy percent of residents age
25 and older had four years of high school, and more than 25% had college degrees. In the early
21st century, agribusiness, oil and gas production, and small manufacturing were important
elements of the area’s economy. In 2002, the county had 1,555 farms and ranches covering
515,311 acres, 46% of which were devoted to pasture, 33% to crops, and 18% to woodlands. In
that year, local farmers and ranchers earned $515,311,000, with crop sales accounting for
$63,218,000 of that total. Beef cattle, cotton, and hay were the chief agricultural products. More
than 2,295,000 barrels of oil and 71,256,092 cubic feet of gas-well gas were produced in the
county in 2004; by the end of that year, 25,984,999 barrels of oil had been taken from county
lands since 1944. Franklin is the county’s seat of government and Hearne is its largest town.
Other communities include Calvert, Bremond, Wheelock, Mumford, and New Baden.

Transportation’s (TxDOT) Historic Bridges of Texas and Historic Districts & Properties of Texas
online databases, and the Texas State Historical Association’s (TSHA) The Handbook of Texas
Online for information on previously recorded cultural resources sites and previous archeological
investigations conducted within a 1.6-kilometer (1.0-mile) radius of the project area (NPS 2017;
THC 2017; TSHA 2017a, 2017b; TxDOT 2017a, 2017b). The archival research indicated the
presence of 98 previously recorded archeological sites, one historic district listed on the NRHP,
a possible crossing of El Camino Real de los Tejas, and 16 cemeteries within a 1.6-kilometer (1.0mile) radius of the project area (Figures 4-1 to 4-2; Table 4-1). Two of the cemeteries, the W.W.
Arrington grave site (41GM124) and Steele’s Grove Cemetery (41GM123), have been assigned
archeological site trinomials; however, these cemeteries are not included in the total count of
archeological sites herein so as not to artificially inflate the numbers of known cultural resources
in the vicinity of the project area. Similarly, the Piedmont Springs Archeological Site is a historic
district listed on the NRHP that has also been assigned an archeological site trinomial (41GM44),
though this resource has not been included in the archeological site count.
Five of the 98 previously recorded archeological sites (41GM20, 41GM28, 41GM118,
41GM264, and 41GM473) are mapped as being located within the current project’s ROW.
Horizon re-located and reinvestigated sites 41GM28, 41GM118, and 41GM264 during the current
survey through a combination of surface inspection and shovel testing. The results of Horizon’s
investigations on these three sites are presented in the following chapters.
Horizon did not re-locate the remaining two previously recorded sites, 41GM20 and
41GM473, mapped within the current project area. Sites 41GM20 and 41GM473 are described
on their site forms as consisting of low-density scatters of aboriginal lithic artifacts. Site 41GM20
was recorded in 1973 as a sparse scatter of aboriginal lithic debris in a disturbed context within a
saddle-like depression on a hill top. Site 41GM473 was recorded in 2016 as consisting only of a
single, isolated chert flake. Both sites are situated in disturbed contexts associated with an
existing pipeline (in the case of 41GM20) and an existing transmission line (in the case of
41GM473). Horizon excavated numerous shovel tests within and near the mapped locations of
these two sites but found no evidence of either site.

Six additional previously recorded archeological sites (41BZ92, 41GM12, 41GM19,
41GM235, 41GM236, and 41RT60) are mapped as being located near, though not within, the
proposed project’s ROW. For purposes of the cultural resources survey, “near” was arbitrarily
defined as 121.9 meters (400.0 feet) or less from the proposed centerline. Sites 41GM12,
41GM19, 41GM235, and 41RT60 were originally recorded as aboriginal lithic scatters of
undetermined prehistoric age. Sites 41BZ92 and 41GM236 were recorded as late 19th- to early
20th-century farmsteads. Horizon’s field crews excavated extra shovel tests within the proposed
ROW when passing near the mapped locations of these sites, reducing the shovel testing interval
to 30.0 meters (98.4 feet) or less. No evidence of these six previously recorded sites was
observed on the modern ground surface or in any of the shovel tests excavated during the current
survey.

Chapter 4.0: Archival Research

One NRHP-listed historic district, the Piedmont Springs Archeological Site, is present
within the archival search area. This resource is located well to the east of the current project’s
ROW near the small community of Piedmont and would not be adversely affected as a result of
the proposed undertaking.
None of the 16 cemeteries within the 1.6-kilometer (1.0-mile) archival review radius are
located within the proposed ROW. One cemetery, the Red Hill Cemetery, is mapped as being in
relatively close proximity to the project area. The mapped location of this cemetery on the THC’s
TASA places it just south of CR 190 in western Grimes County approximately 27.1 meters
(89.0 feet) east of the proposed ROW. Horizon thoroughly inspected the mapped location of this
cemetery as well as the surrounding area. The cemetery is mapped within an open pasture next
to an active farmstead. Several small copses of trees are located on this farmstead that were
also examined for evidence of the cemetery. However, no evidence of a cemetery was observed
anywhere near the mapped location of the Red Hill Cemetery. Online research conducted on the
findagrave.com web site (findagrave.com 2018) indicates that the Red Hill Cemetery is actually
located northeast of Bedias, Texas, approximately 41.8 kilometers (26.0 miles) northeast of its
mapped location on the THC’s TASA. As such, Horizon has concluded that the Red Hill Cemetery
is misplotted on the THC’s TASA and that the cemetery is not located near the current project
area.
Finally, two possible adjacent routes of El Camino Real de los Tejas, a Spanish Colonial
roadway utilized by the Spanish between the 17th and 19th centuries, cross the current project’s
ROW just southeast of the Old San Antonio Road (Texas OSR), which marks the boundary
between Brazos and Robertson counties northwest of Bryan-College Station. These possible
historic-age roadway alignments traverse the current project’s proposed ROW within an open
agricultural field that has been under active cultivation since at least the mid-20th century. In fact,
historical aerial photographs dating to 1961, 1971, and 1995 show extensive agricultural terracing
on this tract. These landscape modifications likely would have disturbed and altered any vestiges
of El Camino Real on this agricultural tract. No swales, depressions, or other surface indications
of El Camino Real were observed within the proposed ROW on either the Brazos or Robertson
county sides of the Texas OSR, nor did extensive shovel testing conducted in this area detect
any evidence of buried, compacted soil horizons or other soil anomalies that might be interpreted
as evidence of the historic trail. As such, Horizon has concluded that no remnants of El Camino
Real de los Tejas are present within the proposed project’s ROW. Magellan is proposing to install
the pipeline under the existing Texas OSR roadway via HDD or conventional bore.
Two, or possibly three, segments of the proposed ROW have been previously surveyed
for cultural resources.
First, an approximately 4.0-kilometer- (2.5-mile-) long segment of the current project’s
proposed ROW would be collocated within an existing Brazos Electric Power Cooperative, Inc.
transmission line that was surveyed for cultural resources by Cox|McLain Environmental
Consulting, Inc. (CMEC) in 2011. This previously surveyed segment of the proposed ROW begins
at the point where the current project area crosses an unnamed tributary of Campbells Creek on
the Circle X Ranch in Robertson County and extends southeastward approximately 4.0 kilometers
(2.5 miles) into Brazos County.

Second, an approximately 20.1-kilometer- (12.5-mile-) long segment of the proposed
ROW in Grimes County crosses a series of large block-area surveys that were conducted in
connection with the Gibbons Creek Lignite Mine for the TMPA in the 1970s and 1980s. This
previously surveyed segment of the current project area begins near the intersection of CR 30
and William D. Fitch Parkway northwest of the Navasota River and continues southeastwards all
the way to a point southeast of Rocky Creek. This 20.1-kilometer- (12.5-mile-) long segment of
the current project area traverses a portion of the Navasota River and Gibbons Creek floodplains
that ultimately was not included within the boundaries of the Gibbons Creek Lignite Mine. Rather,
this segment of the project area traverses a bonded portion of the TMPA property that was not
excavated or disturbed during mining activities as well as several privately owned ranches,
including the large Moody and Horse Head ranches.
Aside from these two extensive prior cultural resources surveys, very few prior cultural
resources surveys are on record that covered any portion of the current project’s proposed ROW.
A few linear surveys, presumably associated with various utility projects, are shown crossing the
current project’s proposed ROW on the THC’s TASA, but very few prior surveys are on record
aside from the two substantial surveys discussed above. However, approximately 14.0 kilometers
(8.7 miles) of the current project’s proposed ROW in Grimes County, extending northwestward
from the Grimes-Waller county line, is collocated within CenterPoint Energy’s existing Brazos
Valley Connection Transmission Line ROW, which was surveyed by POWER Engineers, Inc. in
2016. There is no report of this survey on file on the THC’s TASA, and the survey corridor for this
survey is not shown on the THC’s TASA. However, several archeological sites were recorded
during this prior survey in Grimes County, and also in Waller County to the south, that fall within
what would have been the linear survey area, and the site forms for those sites are on file on the
THC’s TASA. It is likely that only USACE jurisdictional areas were surveyed in connection with
the prior CenterPoint Energy project.

Cultural Resources Assessment of USACE Jurisdictional Areas and TMPA Property on the Proposed
East Houston to Hearne Pipeline Right-of-Way, Grimes, Brazos, and Robertson Counties, Texas

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

For purposes of the cultural resources survey, the federal APE consists of the proposed
construction footprint, including permanent and temporary easements and workspaces, within
those portions of the overall proposed ROW subject to federal jurisdiction. Following current
USACE guidance, the APE consists of the channel, banks, and adjacent uplands associated with
USACE jurisdictional features within the proposed ROW. As delineated by project biologists,
208 USACE jurisdictional features were identified within the proposed ROW in Grimes, Brazos,
and Robertson counties, including 15 perennial streams, 42 intermittent streams, 48 ephemeral
streams, 22 palustrine forested wetlands, 61 palustrine emergent wetlands, five scrub shrub
wetlands, and 15 ponds (Table 5-1). While the permit area ultimately will be determined by the
USACE, archaeological survey areas associated with USACE jurisdictional features are typically
considered to include the banks and associated uplands extending approximately 91.5 meters
(300.0 feet) from the defined banks or edges of the feature, though the USACE may extend them
farther. The proposed ROW consists of a linear corridor measuring 30.5 meters (100.0 feet) in
width. Thus, the APE associated with each jurisdictional feature would measure a minimum of
approximately 182.9 meters (600.0 feet) in length by 30.5 meters (100.0 feet) in width, covering
an area of 0.6 hectare (1.4 acres). Horizon extended many of the survey buffers beyond the
typical 91.5-meter (300.0-foot) buffer on one or both sides of jurisdictional features. Accounting
for extended survey buffers and overlapping survey areas surrounding adjacent jurisdictional
features, the survey buffers surrounding the 208 USACE jurisdictional features that constitute the
APE collectively extend a total linear distance of 46.2 kilometers (28.7 miles) within the 30.5meter- (100.0-foot-) wide proposed ROW, covering a total area of 141.2 hectares (348.8 acres).
In addition, projects that fall under federal oversight must take into account the APE for
indirect effects, which considers possible viewshed effects on historic properties located within
line of sight of aboveground project facilities. The APE for indirect effects typically includes all
parcels located adjacent to the proposed construction footprint, but may extend farther depending
on the height of aboveground facilities. The proposed undertaking primarily involves installation
of a subsurface pipeline. In addition, one surface valve site would be constructed, but this would
have a minimal aboveground footprint and there would be no net viewshed impacts to any historic
properties in the surrounding area. As such, for purposes of the cultural resources survey, the
federal APE was defined based only on direct impacts from construction and operation of the
proposed pipeline facilities and was not expanded due to indirect impacts resulting from viewshed
effects.

Refers to length of feature within 30.5-meter- (100.0-foot-) wide survey corridor.
Presented in Appendix B.

In addition to the federal APE described above, the entire segment of the ROW located
on TMPA property (i.e., state land) in Grimes County falls under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities
Code of Texas. This segment of the project area would measure 4.2 kilometers (2.6 miles) in
length by 30.5 meters (100.0 feet) in width and would cover an area of approximately
12.7 hectares (31.5 acres). The segment of the proposed ROW located on TMPA property
includes numerous USACE jurisdictional areas, so there is substantial overlap between federal
and state jurisdiction within this segment of the proposed ROW.
Prior to the initiation of cultural resources survey fieldwork, Magellan proactively engaged
in preliminary consultation with several federally recognized Tribes in the state of Texas to solicit

H146-170124

79

Chapter 5.0: Survey Methodology

their comments regarding the proposed undertaking. The Tribes requested that the cultural
resources survey be expanded beyond the typical USACE jurisdictional survey buffers to include
100% of the proposed project corridor. At Magellan’s request, Horizon therefore conducted an
intensive 100% cultural resources survey of the entire ROW in Grimes, Brazos, and Robertson
counties, including USACE jurisdictional areas as well as intervening areas not subject to
regulatory jurisdiction. The 4.2-kilometer- (2.6-mile-) long segment of proposed ROW located on
TMPA property that falls under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of Texas required an
intensive 100% survey regardless of the extent of federal jurisdiction. This report describes the
results of the cultural resources survey conducted for Magellan’s proposed East Houston to
Hearne Project in Grimes, Brazos, and Robertson counties, including all cultural resources
recorded during the survey (including those found in portions of the overall proposed ROW that
are currently considered not to fall under any regulatory jurisdiction). In the interest of meeting
an ambitious reporting schedule, however, shovel testing data presented in this report are limited
to those portions of the ROW that fall within areas currently considered to be subject to federal
and/or state regulation.
Between November 1, 2017, and April 11, 2018, Horizon archeologists Charles Bludau,
Foster Duncan, Benjamin Johnson, Jacob Lyons, Benjamin Morton, Briana N. Smith, and Jared
Wiersema performed an intensive cultural resources survey of the Grimes, Brazos, and
Robertson counties segment of the proposed East Houston to Hearne Pipeline Project’s ROW to
locate any cultural resources that potentially would be impacted by the proposed undertaking.
Archeological field crews generally consisted of two members, though a third person was
sometimes added to a crew if an odd number of archeologists were deployed at the time. The
project’s Principal Investigator, Jeffrey D. Owens, performed a brief reconnaissance survey at the
beginning of the project to examine the range of environments and landforms that characterize
the project area and conducted field inspections of all archeological sites recorded during the
survey; as such, the Principal Investigator was in the field for approximately 25% of the duration
of field survey activities, typically from one to two days per week. Following completion of the
pedestrian survey with shovel testing, Horizon archeologists Foster Duncan, Jacob Lyons, Jared
Wiersema, and Rachel Naasz returned to the field from September 20 to October 6, 2018, to
conduct supplemental mechanical deep testing using a backhoe at nine streams that fall within
the USACE permit area that were considered to possess the potential to contain archeological
deposits at depths greater than shovel testing was capable of reaching during initial survey
activities.
Horizon’s archeologists traversed the centerline of the proposed ROW and thoroughly
inspected the modern ground surface for aboriginal and historic-age cultural resources. In
addition to pedestrian walkover and surface inspection, for linear surveys, the Texas State
Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per
1.6 kilometers (1.0 miles) for each 30.5-meter- (100.0-foot-) wide transect unless field conditions
warrant more shovel tests (e.g., in cultural high-probability areas) or fewer shovel tests (e.g., on
steep slopes, in areas with excellent ground surface visibility, in heavily disturbed areas). The
federal APE for the proposed project measures 46.2 kilometers (28.7 miles) in length by
30.5 meters (100.0 feet) in width; as such, 459 shovel tests would be required in order to meet
the TSMASS requirements. Horizon excavated a total of 1,052 shovel tests and 29 backhoe

80

170124_arch_survey_fort worth_report

Cultural Resources Assessment of USACE Jurisdictional Areas and TMPA Property on the Proposed

trenches within USACE jurisdictional buffers during the survey; as such, the TSMASS
requirements were exceeded for an APE of this length. Furthermore, within the 4.2-kilometer(2.6-mile-) long segment of proposed ROW located on TMPA property, 42 shovel tests would be
required in order to meet the TSMASS requirements. Horizon excavated 103 shovel tests on
TMPA property, thereby exceeding the TSMASS requirements for a project area of this length.
Shovel tests were excavated at approximately 100.0-meter (328.1-foot-) intervals, though
intervals were tightened to 30.0- to 50.0-meter (98.4- to 164.0-foot) intervals within areas with a
higher potential for subsurface cultural resources, such as stream terraces or areas near
previously recorded archeological sites. A minimum of three shovel tests were excavated within
the survey area buffers on either side of each USACE jurisdictional area whenever possible. In
some cases, one or both sides of a jurisdictional area could not be shovel tested due to the
presence of large pools of standing water or the presence of built features that precluded shovel
testing, such as road and highway pavement, parking lots, gravel pits, and equipment yards.
Backhoe trenches were excavated at comparable intervals adjacent to selected streams, typically
consisting of two to three trenches on either side of the stream.
In general, shovel tests measured approximately 30.0 centimeters (11.8 inches) in
diameter and were excavated to a target depth of 1.0 meter (3.3 feet) below surface, to the top of
pre-Holocene deposits, or to the maximum depth practicable, and all sediments were screened
through 6.35-millimeter (0.25-inch) hardware cloth. Shovel testing was generally capable of fully
penetrating sediments with the potential to contain subsurface archeological deposits on uplands
and Pleistocene-age terraces adjacent to prominent floodplains as well as in some floodplain and
Holocene-age terrace settings. Several floodplain and terrace settings were encountered within
the proposed ROW, primarily on the broad floodplain formed by the Navasota River and its
tributaries, where clayey and loamy alluvial sediments extended more deeply than shovel tests
were capable of penetrating. However, the broad Navasota River floodplain is typified by a
complex network of meandering braided streams, marshes, and sloughs. These settings were
typically very poorly drained and were characterized by extensive inundated areas that are not
conducive to standard deep-testing strategies. While cultural resources may be buried at
potentially substantial depths within such floodplain settings, aboriginal sites recorded during prior
surveys and during the current survey are typically situated on older, topographically elevated
terrace structures adjacent to the active floodplains of the Navasota River and its major tributaries.
As such, it is Horizon’s opinion that pedestrian walkover with surface inspection and systematic
shovel testing was largely adequate to evaluate the cultural resources potential of the project
area. Maps depicting the locations of all 208 USACE jurisdictional features, the boundaries of
TMPA property, and shovel tests are presented in Appendix A. Summary data for all shovel tests
excavated within those portions of the proposed ROW subject to federal and state regulatory
jurisdiction and on all archeological sites recorded during the survey (including sites located in
non-regulated areas) are presented in Appendix B.
Following completion of the pedestrian survey with shovel testing, Horizon archeologists
Foster Duncan, Jacob Lyons, Jared Wiersema, and Rachel Naasz returned to the field from
September 20 to October 6, 2018, to conduct supplemental mechanical deep testing using a
backhoe. Initially, 14 streams located within the USACE permit area were selected for trenching

H146-170124

81

Chapter 5.0: Survey Methodology

based on their potential to contain archeological resources in alluvial sediments at greater depths
than shovel testing was capable of reaching during the previously completed pedestrian survey.
In practice, it was possible to conduct backhoe trenching at only nine of the selected streams,
including CRK-5, CRK-6, CRK-a2, CRK-a3, CRK-b19, CRK-b21, CRK-b22, CRK-b32, and CRKa72. Five additional streams were initially targeted for backhoe trenching, including CRK-a48,
CRK-a94, CRK-a95, CRK-a99, and CRK-b20. Magellan was unable to provide access to four of
these locations (CRK-a48, CRK-a94, CRK-a95, and CRK-b20) as landowners either refused to
allow backhoe trenching on their properties or refused access to roadways and driveways on
adjacent private property that was needed to transport the backhoe to the trenching locations.
The fifth stream (CRK-a99) that was initially targeted for trenching turned out to be inaccessible
to the backhoe due to heavy forest vegetation; at this location, Horizon instead excavated large,
60.0-by-60.0-centimeter- (23.6-by-23.6-inch-) diameter shovel tests on each side of the creek to
depths of approximately 1.0 meter (3.28 feet) below surface, terminating at an impenetrable clay
layer.
Horizon excavated a total of 29 backhoe trenches at the nine streams that were accessible
for trenching. The vertical depth of impacts across the majority of the proposed pipeline would
be 2.1 meters (7.0 feet) below surface, which would be the depth of the open-cut pipeline trench
(allowing for installation of a 50.8-centimeter- [20.0-inch-] diameter pipe with 1.2 meters [4.0 feet]
of overlying fill). Backhoe trenches were excavated using a standard-sized backhoe with a boom
capable of reaching approximately 3.0 meters (10.0 feet) below surface, thereby allowing the 2.1meter (7.0-foot) maximum depth of impacts to be fully assessed, as appropriate. Trenches were
excavated using a backhoe with a 0.6-meter- (2.0-foot-) wide bucket with a flat-edged cleanout to
the lesser of the following depths—a target depth of 2.1 meters (7.0 feet) below surface (the
vertical APE), deposits that substantially pre-date the Holocene, deposits that represent facies
beneath which archeological potential is minimal, or to a natural obstruction preventing further
excavation, such as the water table or impenetrable soils, gravels, or bedrock. In practice,
trenches measured from 2.0 to 4.9 meters (6.6 to 16.1 feet) in length and were excavated to
depths ranging from 0.4 to 2.8 meters (1.3 to 9.2 feet) below surface. During trench excavations,
soil “lifts” (i.e., thin, subhorizontal layers) measuring approximately 10.0 centimeters (3.9 inches)
in thickness were removed from across the entire trench, and the emerging trench walls and floor
were thoroughly inspected for evidence of artifacts, cultural features, or anomalous soil horizons
that may suggest the presence of buried land horizons potentially associated with prehistoric
cultural occupations. A sample of backfill removed from each trench was screened through 6.35millimeter (0.25-inch) hardware cloth during trench excavation. A minimum of one 5.0-gallon
bucket from every third backhoe bucket load was screened, though all backfill from selected soil
horizons was screened if the potential for subsurface archeological deposits was judged to be
high. Following completion of each trench excavation, a 1.0-meter- (3.3-foot-) wide section of
one trench wall was scraped down with a flat-bladed shovel to expose a clear stratigraphic profile
for inspection and photography. A standard backhoe trenching form was completed for each
trench detailing soil characteristics, stratigraphy, and the presence or absence of cultural
materials. Color digital photographs were taken of each trench and profile exposure. After
recording was completed, each trench was immediately backfilled and the ground surface was

restored as closely as possible to its original condition. At no time was an open trench left
unattended.
A total of 16 archeological sites and one historic-age engineering feature, a mid-20thcentury bridge eponymously designated as the Little Wickson Creek Tributary Bridge (which was
not recorded as an archeological site), were documented as a result of the cultural resources
survey of Magellan’s proposed East Houston to Hearne Pipeline ROW in Grimes, Brazos, and
Robertson counties. Of the total of 17 cultural resources (16 archeological sites plus the historicage bridge), 11 resources are located in Grimes County, four resources are located in Brazos
County, and two resources are located in Robertson County. Four of the 16 archeological sites
(41GM28, 41GM118, 41GM264, and 41RT129) are previously recorded sites that were revisited
during the current survey, and the remaining 12 archeological sites (41GM479-486, 41BZ180182, and 41RT610) plus the Little Wickson Creek Tributary Bridge are newly recorded cultural
resources discovered during the current survey.
For each resource, a standard site recording form was used to record pertinent information
on location, physiographic setting, and local environmental characteristics; types and quantities
of artifacts observed; distribution and densities of artifacts; artificial and natural impacts; and the
condition of surface and subsurface archeological deposits. A scaled sketch map was drawn
illustrating site boundaries; locations of shovel tests, cultural features, and/or material
concentrations; as well as notable features of the landscape. Each site was thoroughly photodocumented using color digital photography, and a photographic log was maintained of all
photographs taken. Based on the information recorded on the standard archeological site
recording form in the field, a Texas Archeological Data Site Form was completed for each newly
recorded site and a Texas Archeological Data Site Update Form was completed for each
previously recorded site by Horizon’s laboratory personnel using the most current version of
TARL’s TexSite archeological data collection software. All TexSite forms were submitted to
TARL, and permanent site trinomials were obtained for the newly recorded sites. During the
survey, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms, survey methods, and
shovel test results. Digital photographs were taken, and a photographic log was maintained.
Horizon employed a non-collection policy for cultural resources during the survey.
Diagnostic artifacts (e.g., projectile points, ceramics, historic materials with maker’s marks) and
non-diagnostic artifacts (e.g., lithic debitage, burned rock, historic glass, and metal scrap) were
described, sketched, and/or photo-documented in the field and replaced in the same location in
which they were found. No cultural resources were collected from either public or private lands
during the survey. Upon completion of the project, all project records pertaining to the portion of
the overall project area located on state lands (i.e., TMPA land) will be permanently curated at
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL).
The survey methods employed during the survey represented a “reasonable and goodfaith effort” to locate significant archeological sites within the APE as defined in 36 Code of
Federal Regulations (CFR) 800.3.

Cultural Resources Assessment of USACE Jurisdictional Areas and TMPA Property on the Proposed
East Houston to Hearne Pipeline Right-of-Way, Grimes, Brazos, and Robertson Counties, Texas

6.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS:
JURISDICTIONAL AREAS

A total of 16 archeological sites and one historic-age engineering feature, a concrete
bridge that was not recorded as an archeological site, were documented as a result of the cultural
resources survey of Magellan’s proposed East Houston to Hearne Pipeline ROW in Grimes,
Brazos, and Robertson counties. This chapter presents descriptions of cultural resources that
are located within portions of the overall ROW that are subject to regulatory jurisdiction via
Section 106 of the NHPA and/or the Antiquities Code of Texas. This includes sites within
jurisdictional buffers surrounding WOUSs that are subject to permitting by the USACE, which fall
under the jurisdiction of Section 106 of the NHPA, as well as sites located on property owned and
managed by TMPA, which fall under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of Texas. The
following chapter presents descriptions of archeological sites recorded during the survey that do
not fall within regulated portions of the overall ROW and are not subject to regulatory jurisdiction.
A total of 12 cultural resources, including 11 of the 16 archeological sites and the historicage bridge, fall within portions of the proposed ROW that are currently considered to be subject
to regulatory jurisdiction (Table 6-1; Figures 6-1 to 6-9). All 12 cultural resources fall within
jurisdictional buffers surrounding WOUSs that are subject to USACE permitting; as such, these
12 resources fall under the jurisdiction of Section 106 of the NHPA. Three of the archeological
sites (41GM118, 41GM481, and 41GM482) are located on property owned and operated by
TMPA, a political subdivision of the state of Texas; as such, these three sites additionally fall
under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of Texas. Four of the archeological sites discussed
in this chapter (41GM28, 41GM118, 41GM264, and 41RT129) are previously recorded sites
originally documented during prior cultural resources surveys that were revisited during the
current survey, and the remaining seven archeological sites and the historic-age bridge are newly
recorded cultural resources discovered during the current survey. Aboriginal cultural components
consisting of surface and/or subsurface scatters of lithic and/or ceramic artifacts were recorded
on 9 of the archeological sites, including three sites with Early Ceramic to Late Prehistoric period
components and six sites with undetermined prehistoric components. Historic-age components
dating from the late 19th to mid-20th centuries were observed on four of the archeological sites,
and the historic-age bridge dates to the mid-20th century. Two of the archeological sites
(41GM28 and 41RT129) are multiple-component sites containing both aboriginal and historic-age
cultural components. Each site is discussed in more detail below.

of Gibbons Creek and one of its unnamed tributaries to the south in Grimes County (Figures 6-10
to 6-14; also see Figure 6-9). The site is located on Moody Ranch and is bisected by an improved
gravel oil and gas lease road from east to west. The property is used as cattle pasture and for
seasonal hunting. Site 41GM28 was originally recorded by William M. Sorrow in 1959, at which
time the site was described as a surface scatter composed of four pieces of aboriginal lithic
debitage within a partially cleared setting dotted with rodent burrow mounds. The original site
form also noted that some cattle pens were located south of the gravel road that bisects the site.
Horizon revisited site 41GM28 during the cultural resources survey for the current project.
Based on Horizon’s investigations, the aboriginal component on site 41GM28 consists of a lowdensity, surface and subsurface scatter of lithic debris, and the historic-age component consists
of a mid-20th-century cattle pen on the southern side of the gravel road that bisects the site.
Vegetation on the site consists of dense, short grasses, weeds, and wildflowers with scattered
live oak trees. Portions of the site have been heavily bioturbated by wild boar rooting. Lithic
debitage observed on the modern ground surface was limited to these disturbed areas,
suggesting that the aboriginal artifact scatter is primarily a subsurface manifestation. The terrace
landform slopes down gradually to the southeast, and elevations on the site range from
approximately 57.9 to 59.4 meters (190.0 to 195.0 feet) amsl.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
At the time site 41GM28 was originally recorded in 1959, it was defined only by a centroid
representing the approximate location where the initial four artifacts were observed. At the time,
artifacts were observed only in a disturbed surficial context, and no subsurface investigations
appear to have been conducted.
Based on Horizon’s investigations during the current survey, site 41GM28 measures
approximately 93.0 meters (305.1 feet) north to south by 150.0 meters (492.1 feet) east to west.
The site was investigated only within the current survey corridor, though the site boundaries were
extended to the south to encompass the mid-20th-century cattle pen. The site boundaries may
extend farther to the north; however, the southern site boundary is defined by an unnamed
tributary of Gibbons Creek, and the site likely does not continue farther in this direction. A total
of 14 shovel tests were excavated on and near the site, six of which were positive for cultural
resources at depths ranging from 20.0 to 100.0 centimeters (7.9 to 39.4 inches) below surface.
Sediments observed in shovel tests consist of deep deposits of sandy loam and sand. Cultural
materials were also observed on the modern ground surface in areas that have been heavily
disturbed by wild boar rooting, but these artifacts are clearly not in primary context and likely
derive from the subsurface archeological deposits. It is Horizon’s opinion that the depth of
archeological deposits was not fully assessed via shovel testing and that more deeply buried
cultural resources could be present on the site.
Observed Cultural Features
No aboriginal cultural features were observed on the modern ground surface or in any of
the shovel tests excavated on site 41GM28 either during the original site recording in 1959 or
during Horizon’s current investigations. One piece of charcoal was observed in a shovel test

(ST BS331) at a depth of 90.0 to 100.0 centimeters (35.4 to 39.4 inches) below surface, though
the charcoal could not be clearly associated with the aboriginal archeological deposits due to the
bioturbative forces observed on the site in 1959 and currently.
A mid-20th-century animal pen is located south of the gravel ranch road that bisects site
41GM28 (see Figures 6-13 to 6-14). The corral is fenced with metal bars and the gate is on the
northern side facing the road.
Observed Cultural Materials
Aboriginal cultural materials observed on site 41GM28 consist of four secondary flakes
and 11 tertiary flakes manufactured from light grayish-brown and yellowish-brown fine-grained
chert (Figure 6-15). Some of the debitage exhibited reddish coloration indicative of heat treating.
No temporally diagnostic aboriginal artifacts or preserved floral or faunal remains were observed
on the site. No historic-age cultural materials were observed on the modern ground surface or in
subsurface contexts.
Historical Research
No other farmstead buildings are located within visible range of the mid-20th-century cattle
pen on site 41GM28, nor are any depicted nearby on historical USGS topographic maps or aerial
photographs (NETR 2018). Deed research conducted at the Grimes County Clerk’s office in
Anderson, Texas, indicates that the parcel on which site 41GM28 is located has been in the

ownership of the Moody family since at least the late 19th century (Table 6-2). The corral would
probably have been constructed in the 1950s during the time that Evans Moody owned the ranch.
As such, the corral on site 41GM28 is associated with mid-20th-century ranching operations on
the Moody Ranch but is not directly associated with any of the Moody family’s homesteads.
Summary and Recommendations
Site 41GM28 was initially recorded in 1959 as a diffuse scatter of four aboriginal chert
flakes observed in a disturbed context on a terrace above an unnamed tributary of Gibbons Creek.
Horizon was able to re-locate the site within the current project’s ROW through shovel testing and
surface inspection. Aboriginal cultural materials observed on the site consist exclusively of lithic
debitage. Subsurface cultural materials were observed at depths of 20.0 to 100.0 centimeters
(7.9 to 39.4 inches) below surface in six of the 14 shovel tests excavated on and near the site.
Artifacts were also observed on the modern ground surface in areas heavily disturbed by wild
boar rooting, but these materials likely derived from the subsurface archeological deposits. No
temporally diagnostic aboriginal artifacts or cultural features were observed on the site. A small

charcoal fragment was found with lithic materials in a shovel test between 90.0 and
100.0 centimeters (35.4 to 39.4 inches) below surface, though the charcoal could not be clearly
associated with the lithic materials due to the extensive bioturbation observed on the site in 1959
and currently. Based on the presence of deeply buried aboriginal cultural deposits and the
possibility of preserved charcoal, the aboriginal component of site 41GM28 is recommended as
being of undetermined eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP.
The historic-age component of the site consists only of a mid-20th-century animal corral
located south of the road that bisects the site. These animal pens are mentioned on the original
1959 site form and are still present. No other farmstead buildings are located within visible range
of the cattle pen or depicted nearby on historical USGS topographic maps or aerial photographs.
The parcel on which 41GM28 is located has been owned by the Moody family since at least the
late 19th century; as such, the corral on the site is associated with mid-20th-century ranching
operations on the Moody Ranch. While the Moody family has a long-standing history of owning
and ranching land in Grimes County and is associated with the agricultural development of the
county, the Moody family does not rise to the level of historical significance. Furthermore, the
isolated ranching feature on site 41GM28 is not directly associated with any of the Moody family
homesteads in the surrounding area and does not convey the significance of a mid-20th-century
homestead. As such, the historic-age component on site 41GM28 is recommended as noncontributing to the eligibility of the site for inclusion in the NRHP.

6.2

41GM118
General Description

Site 41GM118 consists of a low-density, subsurface scatter of aboriginal lithic debris
situated on a low terrace adjacent to Dinner Creek along the eastern margin of the Navasota
River floodplain in Grimes County (Figures 6-16 to 6-19; also see Figure 6-8). Site 41GM118 was
originally recorded in 1982 by Espey, Huston, and Associates, Inc. (EHA) during a cultural
resources survey conducted for the TMPA’s Gibbons Creek lignite mine survey. The site was
originally described as a sparse lithic scatter observed in the eroded banks of Dinner Creek and
on the adjacent southwestern slope of an eastern creek terrace. Six pieces of aboriginal lithic
debitage were initially observed across a large eroded area, and subsurface investigations
produced an additional 69 pieces of lithic debitage within archeological deposits measuring
approximately 30.0 centimeters (11.8 inches) in depth. Based on the initial investigations, the site
was not considered to possess significant research potential.
Horizon revisited site 41GM118 during the cultural resources survey for the current
project. The site is situated on a terrace remnant on the eastern side of Dinner Creek, just south
of its confluence with one of its unnamed tributaries, along the eastern margin of the broad
floodplain of the Navasota River. The site is located on land owned and managed by TMPA,
though the site is located on a bonded portion of the property situated to the west of the area
included in former lignite mining activities. As such, the landscape on and surrounding the site
appears to be largely intact aside from some minor erosion and impacts from use of the land as
cattle pasture. Vegetation on the site consists of dense grasses, yaupon, oak, and elm. The
terrace landform on which the site is perched slopes down gently to the west toward Dinner Creek,

amsl.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
At the time site 41GM118 was originally recorded in 1982, it was defined only by a centroid
representing the approximate location where the initial six artifacts were observed. Subsurface
investigations defined archeological deposits extending to a depth of 30.0 centimeters
(11.8 inches) below surface.
Based on Horizon’s investigations during the current survey, site 41GM118 measures
approximately 62.0 meters (203.4 feet) north to south by 60.0 meters (196.9 feet) east to west.
The site was investigated primarily within the current survey corridor, though the site boundaries
were delineated to the west as far as the channel of Dinner Creek. The site boundaries may
continue farther to the east outside the current survey corridor. A total of 10 shovel tests were
excavated on and near the site, three of which were positive for cultural resources at depths
ranging from 0.0 to 60.0 centimeters (0.0 to 23.6 inches) below surface. Sediments observed in
shovel tests consist of sandy clay loam and sand overlying clay and sandy clay. No cultural
materials were observed on the modern ground surface, though dense vegetation obscured
ground surface visibility. It is Horizon’s opinion that the depth of archeological deposits was fully
assessed via shovel testing for the most part and that more deeply buried cultural resources likely
are not present on the site.

H146-170124

Chapter 6.0: Results of Investigations: Jurisdictional Areas

Observed Cultural Features
One possible cultural feature was observed on site 41GM118. This possible feature
consists of a thin lens of ashy sediment observed in ST JL347 between depths of 25.0 and
30.0 centimeters (9.8 and 11.8 inches) below surface (the sediment lens itself is only about
2.0 centimeters [0.8 inches] thick) (Figure 6-20). No cultural materials were observed within the
ash lens, though flakes and burned rocks were found above and below it. The feature may
represent an aboriginal thermal feature, though it may also simply reflect a natural burning
episode that was subsequently buried by overbank sediments.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41GM118 during Horizon’s investigations consist of
five pieces of lithic debitage, including one primary flake and four tertiary flakes, and five pieces
of burned rock (Figure 6-21). The four tertiary flakes exhibit a reddish coloration and appear to
have been heat-treated. The non-heat-treated flake was manufactured from very light gray, finegrained chert. No temporally diagnostic aboriginal artifacts or preserved floral or faunal remains
were observed on the site.
Summary and Recommendations
Site 41GM118 consists of a low-density, subsurface scatter of aboriginal lithic debitage
situated on the western slope of a terrace of Dinner Creek. The site was investigated primarily

within the current project’s ROW and the boundaries were extended as far west as Dinner Creek,
and the site boundaries may continue farther to the east. The site was originally recorded in 1982
during a survey for the TMPA’s Gibbons Creek lignite mine. Cultural materials observed on the
site during the original 1982 survey and the current investigations consist of aboriginal lithic
debitage and a few small burned rocks. A 5.0-centimeter- (2.0-inch-) thick lens of ashy sediment
was observed in one shovel test at depths of 25.0 to 30.0 centimeters (9.8 to 11.8 inches) below
surface. This ash lens may represent an aboriginal thermal feature or simply a natural burning
episode, though it may be notable than four of the five pieces of lithic debitage observed during
Horizon’s investigations were thermally altered. No temporally diagnostic artifacts or preserved
floral or faunal remains were observed either during the original 1982 investigations or during
Horizon’s current revisit. While some surficial erosion was observed on the site, the archeological
deposits appear to be largely intact. Based on the presence of a possible subsurface cultural
feature and moderately deep cultural deposits, site 41GM118 is recommended as being of
undetermined eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL.

41GM264
General Description

Site 41GM264 consists of a substantial aboriginal campsite or small village situated on a
broad terrace north of Gibbons Creek and one of its unnamed tributaries along the northern
margin of the Gibbons Creek floodplain in Grimes County (Figures 6-22 to 6-24; also see
Figure 6-9). Site 41GM264 was originally recorded in 1989 by EHA during a cultural resources

survey conducted for the TMPA’s Gibbons Creek lignite mine survey. The site was originally
described as a large village containing aboriginal lithic debitage, ceramic sherds, burned rocks,
and charcoal fragments with possible hearth features and midden deposits. Cultural materials
were encountered down to a depth of 1.0 meter (3.3 feet) below surface and possibly continued
deeper. Based on the initial investigations, the site was considered to possess significant
research potential and further investigations were recommended.
Horizon revisited site 41GM264 during the cultural resources survey for the current project
and confirmed the original findings. The site is situated on a broad terrace on the northern edge
of the Gibbons Creek floodplain, which forms part of the broad floodplain of the Navasota River.
The confluence of Gibbons Creek and one of its unnamed tributaries is located a short distance
east of the site, and two sloughs that drain eastward into Gibbons Creek are located immediately
south of the site. The site is located on Moody Ranch and is bisected by an improved gravel
ranch road from east to west. The property is used as cattle pasture and for seasonal hunting.
The landscape on and surrounding the site appears to be largely intact aside from some minor
erosion and impacts from use of the land as cattle pasture. Vegetation on the site consists of
dense, short grasses, wildflowers, weeds, and live oak trees. The terrace landform on which the
site is perched slopes down gently to the south and east toward Gibbons Creek, and elevations
on the site range from approximately 56.4 to 62.5 meters (185.0 to 205.0 feet) amsl.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
At the time site 41GM264 was originally recorded by EHA in 1989, the site boundaries
were estimated to measure approximately 145.0 meters (475.7 feet) north to south by
555.0 meters (1,820.9 feet) east to west. Subsurface cultural materials were encountered in
shovel tests extending to a depth of 100.0 centimeters (3.3 feet) below surface and likely
continued deeper.
During Horizon’s investigations, cultural materials were observed only within the eastcentral portion of the previously delineated site area, though Horizon’s investigations were limited
to the current project’s linear ROW and did not extend across the entire site area. As such, the
originally delineated site boundaries were not altered as a result of Horizon’s investigations.
A total of 37 shovel tests were excavated on and near the site, 12 of which were positive
for cultural resources extending to a depth of at least 1.0 meter (3.3 feet) below surface.
Sediments observed in shovel tests consist of deep deposits of sand and sandy loam. A dense
clay or sandy clay loam substrate was encountered in a few shovel tests, though the majority of
shovel tests were terminated at a depth of 1.0 meter (3.3 feet) below surface and did not reach a
clear subsoil boundary. As such, it is possible that archeological deposits continue below a depth
of 1.0 meter (3.3 feet) below surface. It is Horizon’s opinion that the depth of archeological
deposits was not fully assessed via shovel testing and that more deeply buried cultural resources
could be present on site 41GM264.

Observed Cultural Features
One small, apparently intact burned rock feature was observed in ST JL637 (Figures 6-25
to 6-26). The top of the feature occurred at a depth of 35.0 centimeters (13.8 inches) below
surface), and the bottom of the feature occurred at a depth of 40.0 centimeters (15.7 inches)
below surface. Charcoal fragments and lithic debitage were observed within and below the
feature, and soil discoloration was also present within the feature matrix. Although no additional
intact features were observed, burned rocks were fairly abundant in shovel tests and several small
chunks of burned clay were encountered, suggesting that additional features may be present.
The burned clay chunks appear to represent burned soil associated with thermal features rather
than clay balls used for boiling food.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41GM264 include aboriginal lithic debitage
manufactured from a range of light gray to brown chert and petrified wood materials; two small,
undecorated, sandy paste ceramic sherds; one small faunal bone fragment; nine small burned
clay chunks; and 50+ burned rocks (Figures 6-27 to 6-32). No temporally diagnostic lithic artifacts
were observed, though sandy paste ceramics are generally indicative of an Early Ceramic to Late
Prehistoric period occupation (ca. A.D. 100 to 1500). The ceramic sherds observed on site
41GM264 were too small and crumbly to make even tentative typological assignments.

Summary and Recommendations
Site 41GM264 was originally recorded in 1989 as a large aboriginal campsite or small
village located on a terrace overlooking the Navasota River and Gibbons Creek floodplains.
Horizon was able to re-locate the site within the current project’s ROW through shovel testing and
surface inspection. Aboriginal cultural materials observed on the site consist of a high-density,
subsurface scatter of aboriginal lithic debitage, ceramic sherds, burned clay chunks, faunal bone,
charcoal, and burned rocks contained within a thick mantle of sand and sandy loam.
Archeological deposits were observed to extend to a depth of at least 1.0 meter (3.3 feet) below
surface and likely continue deeper. An intact burned rock feature, consisting of a small cluster of
burned rocks and discolored soil, was observed in one shovel test at a depth of 35.0 to
40.0 centimeters (13.8 to 15.7 inches) below surface. Charcoal fragments and lithic debitage
were observed within and below the feature. No other intact cultural features were observed
during Horizon’s investigations, but the abundance of burned rock observed on the site and the
presence of burned clay chunks suggest that additional thermal features may be present. No
temporally diagnostic lithic artifacts were observed. The presence of two sandy paste ceramic
sherds suggests an Early Ceramic to Late Prehistoric period occupation (ca. A.D. 100 to 1500),
though the high density of cultural material suggests that multiple cultural components could be
represented. Aside from some limited surficial impacts from construction and use of a gravel
ranch road that crosses the site and use of the property for cattle grazing, archeological deposits
on site 41GM264 appear to be largely intact. The presence of a substantial assemblage of cultural

H146-170124

115

Chapter 6.0: Results of Investigations: Jurisdictional Areas

materials, temporally diagnostic artifacts, preserved charcoal, and intact cultural features
suggests that site 41GM264 may have significant research potential. Additional significance
testing would be required to firmly establish the NRHP eligibility of the site; as such, site 41GM264
is recommended as being of undetermined eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP.

41GM481
General Description

Site 41GM481 consists of a high-density, subsurface scatter of aboriginal lithic and
ceramic artifacts situated on a terrace east of Dinner Creek along the eastern margin of the broad
Navasota River floodplain in Grimes County (Figures 6-33 to 6-35; also see Figure 6-8). The site
is located on land owned and managed by TMPA, though the site is located on a bonded portion
of the property situated to the west of the area included in former lignite mining activities. As
such, the landscape on and surrounding the site appears to be largely intact aside from some
minor erosion. Vegetation on the site consists of dense grasses and greenbrier with scattered
oak, yaupon, elm, and hackberry. The terrace landform on which the site is located slopes down
gently to the west toward Dinner Creek, and elevations on the site range from approximately
60.4 to 61.6 meters (198.0 to 202.0 feet) amsl.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of subsurface cultural materials observed in shovel tests, site
41GM481 measures approximately 70.0 meters (229.7 feet) north to south by 60.0 meters
(196.9 feet) east to west. The site was investigated only with the current project’s linear survey
corridor, and the site boundaries may extend farther to the east and west. However, Dinner Creek
flows southward approximately 30.0 meters (98.4 feet) west of the investigated site boundaries,
and the site probably does not extend much farther to the west outside the survey corridor.
A total of 19 shovel tests were excavated on and near the site, 11 of which were positive
for cultural resources. Cultural resources were observed at depths ranging from 30.0 to
100.0 centimeters (11.8 to 39.4) below surface; however, the highest density of artifacts appears
to be around 60.0 to 70.0 centimeters (23.6 to 27.6 inches) below surface, suggesting that a
buried occupation horizon may be present at these depths. Sediments observed in shovel tests
consist of loamy sand, sand, and silty loam overlying sand, sandy clay, and clay loam. While
culturally sterile subsoil was encountered in a few shovel tests, it is Horizon’s opinion that the
depth of archeological deposits was not fully assessed via shovel testing across the majority of
the site and that more deeply buried cultural materials may be present.
Observed Cultural Features
One intact burned rock feature was observed in ST JL345 at depths of 60.0 to
70.0 centimeters (23.6 to 27.6 inches) below surface, and this shovel test was subsequently
expanded into a 50.0-by-50.0-centimeter (19.7-by-19.7-inch) test excavation unit to expose more
of this feature (no photograph of this feature appears to have been taken). The feature contained
several pieces of burned rock, lithic debitage, and charcoal, and the sediment within the feature
was notably darker than the surrounding matrix. No other intact features were observed on the

site, though the relative abundance of burned rocks and the presence of burned clay chunks in
shovel tests suggests that additional features may be present. The burned clay chunks appear
to represent burned soil associated with thermal features rather than clay balls used for boiling
food.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41GM481 consist of chert and petrified wood lithic
debitage, including approximately one primary flake, eight secondary flakes, and 66 tertiary
flakes; 50+ burned rocks; one undecorated, perforated, sandy paste ceramic sherd; burned clay
chunks; a possible hammerstone; charcoal; and 50+ burned rocks (Figures 6-36 to 6-40). The
ceramic sherd is a thick, undecorated, sandy paste sherd with a drilled hole possibly used to
repair a crack in the vessel or suspend the vessel. The former interpretation is favored as the
sherd snapped along a fracture during excavation that ran through the perforation. The sherd is
undecorated and generally consistent with plain utility wares associated with the Texas coastal
region during the Early Ceramic to Late Prehistoric periods (ca. A.D. 100 to 1500), though
insufficient diagnostic characteristics are present to allow a more specific typological assignment.
The majority of the lithic materials were manufactured from dark gray and yellowish-brown, finegrained chert, though one flake of petrified wood was also observed. Some of the lithic debitage
shows red discoloration, indicating the use of heat treatment. No temporally diagnostic lithic
artifacts were observed.
Summary and Recommendations
Site 41GM481 consists of a high-density, subsurface scatter of aboriginal lithic and
ceramic artifacts situated on a terrace adjacent to Dinner Creek interpreted as the remains of an
aboriginal campsite dating to the Early Ceramic to Late Prehistoric periods (ca. A.D. 100 to 1500).
Cultural materials were observed at depths ranging from 30.0 to 100.0 centimeters (11.8 to 39.4)
below surface; however, the highest density of artifacts appears to be around 60.0 to
70.0 centimeters (23.6 to 27.6 inches) below surface, suggesting that a buried occupation horizon
may be present at these depths. An intact cultural feature containing burned rocks, lithic debris,
and charcoal was also observed in a shovel test (ST JL345) at depths of 60.0 to 70.0 centimeters
(23.6 to 27.6 inches) below surface. Horizon was unable to fully assess the depth of archeological
deposits on the site with shovel testing, and it is possible that archeological deposits continue
deeper than 1.0 meter (3.3 feet) below surface. Aside from some limited surficial impacts from
erosion, archeological deposits on site 41GM481 appear to be largely intact. The presence of a
substantial assemblage of cultural materials, temporally diagnostic artifacts, preserved charcoal,
and intact cultural features suggests that site 41GM481 may have significant research potential.
Additional significance testing would be required to firmly establish the NRHP and SAL eligibility
of the site; as such, site 41GM481 is recommended as being of undetermined eligibility for
inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL.

41GM482
General Description

Site 41GM482 consists of the remnants of a small cluster of mid-20th-century farm
buildings, including a single-story building with a makeshift kitchen added to one end (possibly a
temporary dwelling, hunting cabin, or office), a collapsing outhouse, a small post-and-rail animal
pen, and a small equipment trailer in Grimes County (Figures 6-41 to 6-48; also see Figure 6-8).
The site is situated on the edge of a terrace that overlooks Dinner Creek to the west. The site is
accessed via an improved gravel oil and gas lease road that provides access to the Moody Ranch
to the south and then continues northward through TMPA property. The site is located on land
owned and managed by TMPA, though the site is located on a bonded portion of the property
situated to the west of the area included in former lignite mining activities. As such, the landscape
on and surrounding the site appears to be largely intact aside from some minor erosion. The site
is moderately overgrown, and vegetation consists of dense grasses and leaf litter with oak, elm,
yaupon, hackberry, cottonwood, and greenbrier. The terrace landform on which the site is located
slopes down gently to the west toward Dinner Creek, and elevations on the site range from
approximately 61.9 to 62.5 meters (203.0 to 205.0 feet) amsl.

Figure 6-48. Equipment Trailer on Site 41GM482 (Facing Northeast)

Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of structural remains standing on the site, site 41GM482
measures approximately 37.0 meters (121.4 feet) north to south by 53.0 meters (173.9 feet) east
to west. The site was investigated only within the current project’s linear survey corridor, though
the site does not appear to extend beyond the delineated boundaries.
A total of eight shovel tests were excavated on and near the site, none of which contained
any subsurface cultural materials. Sediments observed in shovel tests consist of sand and sandy
loam overlying clay. It is Horizon’s opinion that the depth of archeological deposits was fully
assessed via shovel testing and that more deeply buried cultural resources likely are not present
on the site.
Observed Cultural Features
Four cultural features were observed on site 41GM482, including a single-story building
with a makeshift kitchen added to one end (Resource A), a collapsing outhouse (Resource B), a
small animal pen (Resource C), and a small equipment trailer, though only the main building
(Resource A) and the outhouse (Resource B) appear to be of historic age.
Resource A is a wood-framed, single-story structure composed of two main sections
connected by a small hyphen (see Figures 6-44 to 6-45). The structure has a rectangular

H146-170124

127

Chapter 6.0: Results of Investigations: Jurisdictional Areas

floorplan, oriented northeast to southwest, and measures approximately 12.2 meters (40.0 feet)
in length by 4.6 meters (15.0 feet) in width. The shed-roofed building is supported on a concrete
slab foundation, though the foundation is covered in several inches of manure. Milled lumber
studs secured to a sill plate form the walls and support the shed-roof rafters. The roof extends
slightly over the exterior walls, exposing rafter tails. Corrugated metal clads the walls and serves
as roofing material. A hyphen connects the main area with a small addition attached to the
southwestern end that appears to have been used as a makeshift kitchen. Two one-over-one
metal frame sash windows are found on the southeastern side of the building adjacent to a singleentry door opening (the door is missing). An additional door opening is positioned on the
southeastern side of the small addition. Electrical conduits are found inside the building, though
there is no evidence of plumbing. It is not certain that the building was ever used as a dwelling
as the only remaining domestic evidence is a ca. 1960s metal refrigerator. Overall, the building
is in poor condition. The function of the building is undetermined, but the lack of architectural
style and details suggest that it served primarily utilitarian purposes in support of a larger farming
or ranching operation, perhaps as a makeshift dwelling for farm hands, an office space, or a
seasonal hunting cabin. It appears to have been most recently used to store manure.
Resource B is a small outhouse constructed of wood framing and corrugated metal
sheeting located approximately 20.0 meters (65.6 feet) west of the main building (see Figure 646). The outhouse is roughly square in footprint and is sheltered with a metal shed roof. A door
is no longer present on the structure. The outhouse is partially collapsed and in poor condition.
Resource C is a small, rectangular animal corral located approximately 25.0 meters
(82.0 feet) northeast of the main building in the northeastern corner of the site (see Figure 6-47).
The corral is constructed of dimensional lumber and round posts (possibly stripped hackberry
posts) and seems to be of relatively recent construction.
Also present on the site is a small, yellow pull trailer probably used to haul equipment (see
Figure 6-48).
Observed Cultural Materials
The only cultural materials observed on site 41GM482 consist of a surficial scatter of
machine-made glass bottles dating from the 1960s to present (Figure 6-49). No other domestic
debris was observed on the modern ground surface or in any of the shovel tests excavated on
the site.
Historical Research
None of the structures standing on site 41GM482 are clearly visible on historical aerial
photographs as dense vegetation obscures the view from above (NETR 2018). A gravel oil and
gas lease road passes north to south just east of the site that is visible as a two-track field road
on historical aerial photographs dating back to 1958 and on USGS topographic maps dating back
to 1960. On the 1958 aerial photograph, a small clearing is visible at the approximate location of
the site, and an ephemeral driveway or two-track turnaround is barely visible providing access to
the site from the main lease road, suggesting that this site was probably in use at that time. Earlier

imagery was not available for examination, and the area is too overgrown on subsequent aerial
photographs to make out any details.
Deed research conducted at the Grimes County Clerk’s office in Anderson, Texas,
indicates that the parcel on which site 41GM248 was original part of the J.C. Palmer Tract
Abstract 378) (Table 6-3). Though the deed research did not reveal a direct chain of title to the
current owner (TMPA), tracing the original abstract indicated that the parcel was in the Allen family
at least from 1952, and most likely prior to this date. The 1952 deed referenced an earlier partition
deed granted to the heirs of J.R. Allen. In 1952, the same deed grants the land from L.P. Allen
to L.P. Allen and his wife. In 1970, E.E. Allen (heir of J.R. Allen), granted additional acreage to
Leonard P. Allen in 1970. The parcel remains in the ownership of Leonard Allen through the mid1980s when it was granted to Threshold Energy and later to TMPA.
Summary and Recommendations
Site 41GM482 consists of the remnants of a small cluster of mid-20th-century farm
buildings, including a single-story building with a makeshift kitchen added to one end, a collapsing
outhouse, a small animal pen, and a small equipment trailer. The main structure on the site is a
rectangular, wood-framed, corrugated metal barn or shed that may have been used as a
temporary domicile, hunting cabin, or office at some point prior to being used to store manure. A
collapsing outhouse, an abandoned equipment trailer, and a small animal pen surround the main
barn/shed structure. Aerial photographs from the 1950s show a small clearing and driveway at

this location, though the structures themselves are obscured by foliage, and it would appear the
site was in use at that time. A few glass bottles represent the only cultural materials observed on
the site, and no artifacts were found subsurface within any of the shovel tests excavated on the
site. All of the structures are in poor condition and retain minimal architectural integrity, and only
the main building and the outhouse appear to date to the mid-20th-century timeframe. The corral
and equipment trailer appear to be more recent additions to the site.
The Allen family farmed and ranched this land through much of the 20th century. The
remaining structures identified on the property are consistent with resources that support
agricultural practices, livestock raising, and rural domestic living. The Allen family of Grimes
County is not known to be of particular historical importance, and the property is not known to be
associated with an important person or family. The historic-age resources on site 41GM482 are
typical examples of utilitarian agricultural structures found in rural areas of the county. The main
building (Resource A) is not constructed in a particularly unique or distinct architectural style or
design. The outhouse (Resource B) and corral (Resource C) are not unique in design and do not
embody distinct characteristics of a particular style. The structures remaining on the site are in
poor condition and lack integrity of design, workmanship, materials, and feeling, and do not
convey the significance of mid-20th-centry farming practices. The site may have included other
structures in the past, but no evidence of any additional structure locations was observed. Based
on the poor condition of the architectural remains, the absence of archeological deposits, and the
lack of any known associations with persons or events of historical note, site 41GM482 is
recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL.

41GM484
General Description

Site 41GM484 consists of a low-density, subsurface scatter of aboriginal lithic debitage on
a terrace remnant located on the eastern margin of the Navasota River floodplain adjacent to an
unnamed tributary of the Navasota River in Grimes County (Figures 6-50 to 6-52; also see
Figure 6-6). The site is located within the east-to-west-oriented ROW of a cleared two-track field
road, and the area surrounding the site was exceedingly wet. Vegetation on the site consists of
dense, short grasses, and dense stands of oak, elm, yaupon, hackberry, cottonwood, and
greenbrier line the sides of the field road. The terrace landform on which the site is situated slopes
down gently to the south toward the unnamed tributary of the Navasota River, though elevations
on the small site are relatively flat, averaging approximately 70.7 meters (232.0 feet) amsl.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of cultural materials observed in subsurface contexts in shovel tests
and backhoe trenches excavated on site 41GM484, the site measures approximately 45.7 meters
(149.9 feet) east to west by 30.5 meters (100.0 feet) north to south. A total of seven shovel tests
and two backhoe trenches were excavated on and near the site, and one of the shovel tests and
both backhoe trenches contained cultural resources at depths ranging from 20.0 to
168.0 centimeters (7.9 to 66.1 inches) below surface. Sediments observed in shovel tests consist
of deep sand deposits overlying dense basal clay. Sandy sediments potentially containing cultural
resources were not fully penetrated in shovel tests, though both backhoe trenches are capable of
reaching cultural sterile clay subsoil. It is Horizon’s opinion that the archeological deposits on site
41GM484 were fully assessed via backhoe trenching and that more deeply buried cultural
resources likely are not present on the site.
Observed Cultural Features
No cultural features or indirect evidence of cultural features (such as burned rocks) were
observed on the modern ground surface or in any of the shovel tests excavated on site 41GM484.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41GM484 consist exclusively of aboriginal lithic
debitage (Figure 6-53). One of the flakes exhibits a dark red coloration indicative of heattreatment. No temporally diagnostic artifacts were observed, and the site can only be dated to an
undetermined prehistoric timeframe based on the available evidence. No preserved floral or
faunal remains were observed on the site.
Summary and Recommendations
Site 41GM484 consists of a sparse, subsurface scatter of aboriginal lithic debitage on a
terrace remnant situated near the confluence of the Navasota River and one of its unnamed
tributaries. Cultural materials observed on the site consist of lithic debitage observed in a single
positive shovel test and two backhoe trenches at depths of 20.0 to 168.0 centimeters (7.9 to

surficial disturbances resulting from construction and use of a two-track field road and a nearby
fenceline. However, the ephemeral archeological deposits observed on site 41GM484 possess
minimal research value aside from the locational information already recorded. As such, Horizon
recommends that site 41GM484 is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

41GM485
General Description

Site 41GM485 consists of a low- to moderate-density, subsurface scatter of aboriginal
lithic debitage, small burned rocks, and one ceramic sherd on the southwestern slopes of a
prominent upland landform where it interfaces with a high terrace along the eastern margin of the
Navasota River valley in Grimes County (Figures 6-54 to 6-56; also see Figure 6-7). A two-track
field road passes through the site, and the modern ground surface appears to have been
somewhat disturbed by vegetation clearing and use of the field road. Vegetation on the site
consists of short- to medium-high grasses with thickets of oak, cedar, yaupon, and greenbrier
along the northeastern periphery of the site. The topography on the site slopes down gradually
to the southwest toward the unnamed tributary of the Navasota River, ranging from 59.4 to
62.5 meters (195.0 to 205.0 feet) amsl.

Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of subsurface cultural materials observed in shovel tests, site
41GM485 measures approximately 50.0 meters (164.0 feet) northeast to southwest by
15.0 meters (49.2 feet) southeast to northwest. The site was investigated only within the current
project’s linear survey corridor, and the site boundaries may continue farther to the northeast and
southwest. In fact, it is possible that at least some of the cultural materials observed have been
incorporated in colluvial deposits washing down from farther up the ridge to the northeast.
A total of eight shovel tests were excavated on and near the site, three of which were
positive for cultural resources. Cultural resources were observed at depths ranging from 40.0 to
80.0 centimeters (15.7 to 31.5 inches) below surface. Sediments observed in shovel tests consist
of sand, sandy loam, and sandy clay. Dense clay subsoil was encountered in several shovel tests
excavated on the site, and the same clay sediment is present on the modern ground surface
immediately northeast of the site. It is Horizon’s opinion that the depth of archeological deposits
was fully assessed via shovel testing within the investigated portion of the site and that more
deeply buried cultural resources likely are not present.
Observed Cultural Features
No intact cultural features were observed on the modern ground surface or in any of the
shovel tests excavated on site 41GM485. The presence of several small burned rocks in shovel
tests suggests that intact or deflated burned rock features potentially could be present on the site
(or were once present on the site).
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41GM485 consist of 30 to 40 chert and petrified wood
flakes, 10 to 20 small burned rocks, and one small, undecorated, sandy paste ceramic sherd
(Figure 6-57). No temporally diagnostic lithic artifacts were observed. The presence of one small
sandy paste ceramic sherd suggests an Early Ceramic to Late Prehistoric period occupation (ca.
A.D. 100 to 1500). The ceramic sherd observed on site 41GM485 was too small to make a
typological assignment. No preserved floral or faunal remains were observed on the site.
Summary and Recommendations
Site 41GM485 consists of a low- to moderate-density, subsurface scatter of aboriginal
lithic debitage and one ceramic sherd on the shoulder of a prominent upland landform where it
interfaces with a high terrace along the eastern margin of the Navasota River valley. The site
was investigated only within the current project’s ROW, and the site boundaries may extend
farther to the northeast and southwest. Observed cultural materials consist of aboriginal lithic
debitage, a few small burned rocks, and one sandy paste ceramic sherd encountered in shovel
tests at depths ranging from 40.0 to 80.0 centimeters (15.7 to 31.5 inches) below surface.
Sediments observed in shovel tests consist of sand, sandy loam, and sandy clay overlying a
dense clay subsoil. In fact, it is possible that at least some of the cultural materials observed on
the site have been incorporated in colluvial deposits washing down from farther up the prominent
ridge to the northeast. No intact cultural features or preserved floral or faunal remains were

observed. While one temporally diagnostic ceramic sherd was observed, the small size of the
site and the high likelihood that at least some of the observed cultural materials have been
redeposited in colluvial slopewash from farther uphill to the northeast suggests that the
investigated portion of the site possesses minimal research potential. As such, Horizon
recommends that the portion of site 41GM485 within the current project’s ROW is non-contributing
to the overall eligibility of the site for inclusion in the NRHP.

6.8

41GM486
General Description

Site 41GM486 consists of a low-density, subsurface scatter of aboriginal lithic debitage
located on a terrace remnant along the eastern margin of the broad floodplain of the Navasota
River in Grimes County (Figures 6-58 to 6-60; also see Figure 6-9). An improved gravel oil and
gas lease road passes northwest to southeast approximately 50.0 meters (164.0 feet) northeast
of the site, and existing subsurface pipeline and overhead transmission line ROWs pass through
the southwestern portion of the site. Vegetation within the existing pipeline and transmission line
ROW consists of dense, short grasses. The wooded fringe on either side of the cleared existing
utility corridor consists of dense stands of yaupon, live oak, hackberry, elm, and greenbrier.
Bioturbation associated with ant mounds and hog rooting was observed in numerous portions of
the site. The terrace remnant on which the site is situated slopes down moderately strongly to

the west toward the floodplain of the Navasota River, ranging in elevation from 61.0 to
67.1 meters (200.0 to 220.0 feet) amsl.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of subsurface cultural materials observed in shovel tests, site
41GM486 measures approximately 80.0meters (262.5 feet) northwest to southeast by
60.0 meters (196.9 feet) northeast to southwest. The site was investigated only within the current
project’s linear survey corridor, and the site boundaries may continue farther to the northeast and
southwest.
A total of nine shovel tests were excavated on and near the site, four of which were positive
for cultural resources. Cultural resources were observed at depths ranging from 30.0 to
100.0 centimeters (11.8 to 39.4 inches) below surface, with the majority occurring in the range of
50.0 to 60.0 centimeters (19.7 to 23.6 inches) below surface, suggesting that a buried occupation
horizon may be present at the latter depths. Sediments observed in shovel tests consist of sand,
and a dense clay subsoil was encountered in approximately half of the shovel tests excavated on
the site at depths ranging from 40.0 to 80.0 centimeters (15.7 to 31.5 inches) below surface. It is
Horizon’s opinion that the depth of archeological deposits was fully assessed via shovel testing
within the investigated portion of the site and that more deeply buried cultural resources likely are
not present.
Observed Cultural Features
No intact cultural features or evidence of cultural features (such as burned rocks) were
observed on the modern ground surface or in any of the shovel tests excavated on 41GM486.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41GM486 consist of six pieces of aboriginal lithic
debitage, including two secondary and four chert tertiary flakes (Figure 6-61). Two of the flakes
exhibit reddish coloration suggestive of thermal alteration. No temporally diagnostic cultural
materials or preserved floral or faunal remains were observed.
Summary and Recommendations
Site 41GM486 consists of a low-density, subsurface aboriginal lithic scatter located on the
western slope of a terrace remnant along the eastern margin of the broad Navasota River
floodplain. The site was investigated only within the current project’s ROW, and the site
boundaries may extend farther to the northeast and southwest. The southwestern portion of the
site lies within an existing, cleared ROW shared by a subsurface pipeline and an overhead
transmission line, and bioturbation from ant mounds and wild hog rooting was observed in many
areas of the site. Observed cultural materials consist only of a small assemblage of aboriginal
lithic debitage encountered in shovel tests at depths of 30.0 to 100.0 centimeters (11.8 to
39.4 inches) below surface, with the majority occurring in the range of 50.0 to 60.0 centimeters
(19.7 to 23.6 inches) below surface, suggesting that a buried occupation horizon may be present
at those depths. No intact cultural features or preserved floral or faunal remains were observed.

Chapter 6.0: Results of Investigations: Jurisdictional Areas

Figure 6-61. Aboriginal Lithic Debitage Observed on Site 41GM486

No temporally diagnostic artifacts were observed, and the aboriginal occupation can be dated
only to an undetermined prehistoric timeframe. Based on the low artifact density, the lack of
temporally diagnostic cultural materials, the absence of intact cultural features and preserved
floral and faunal remains, and the extent of prior disturbances, the site possesses minimal
research value. As such, Horizon recommends that the portion of site 41GM486 within the current
project’s ROW is non-contributing to the overall eligibility of the site for inclusion in the NRHP.

41BZ181
General Description

Site 41BZ181 consists of a moderate-density subsurface scatter of late 19th- to early 20thcentury domestic debris on a prominent upland ridge overlooking an unnamed tributary of Brushy
Creek to the north (Figures 6-62 to 6-64; also see Figure 6-5). The site is located in a rural area
east of College Station and is accessed indirectly via a gravel driveway that provides access to
other nearby farmsteads from Hardy Weedon Road to the northwest. The site was discovered
partially with the help of the landowner, Morgan Cook, Jr., who had knowledge of the locations of
several sharecropper farmsteads that once stood on his family’s land. The site is situated in an
open cattle pasture covered in short to medium hay grasses, and densely wooded copses of oak,
Ashe juniper, and yaupon surround the site. An overhead transmission line ROW passes near
the southwestern site boundary. Topography on this small site is relatively flat, ranging from
approximately 79.2 to 79.9 meters (260.0 to 262.0 feet) amsl.

Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of subsurface cultural materials observed in shovel tests, site
41BZ181 measures approximately 18.0 meters (59.1 feet) square. The site was investigated
primarily within the current project’s linear survey corridor, though the site probably does not
extend much farther beyond the delineated boundaries.
A total of 11 shovel tests were excavated on and near the site, five of which were positive
for subsurface cultural resources. Across the site as a whole, subsurface cultural resources were
encountered within shallow sandy clay loam extending to depths of 15.0 to 30.0 centimeters
(5.9 to 11.8 inches) below surface. However, a pit feature was discovered on the site that
contained a dense midden deposit of historic-age debris extending from depths of 20.0 to
85.0 centimeters (7.9 to 33.5 inches) below surface. Sediments observed in shovel tests consist
of a surficial veneer of sandy clay loam and sandy loam overlying dense clay subsoil at depths
ranging from 5.0 to 20.0 centimeters (2.0 to 7.9 inches) below surface in most areas. It is
Horizon’s opinion that the depth of archeological deposits was fully assessed via shovel testing
and that more deeply buried cultural resources likely are not present on the site.
Observed Cultural Features
No construction debris or aboveground manifestations of the former sharecropper
farmstead that reportedly formerly existed on site 41BZ181 were observed. However, four
shallow depressions were observed on the modern ground surface of the site (see Figure 6-64).
The majority of cultural materials observed on the site were observed in subsurface contexts
within these depressions. The southernmost depression contained an intact, subsurface pit
feature, and ST JL330 was expanded to expose the entirety of this feature. The depression in
which the pit feature was observed is roughly circular or slightly oval-shaped in plan view,
measuring approximately 4.0 meters (13.1 feet) east to west by 3.0 meters (9.8 feet) north to
south. The top of the feature was encountered at a depth of 20.0 centimeters (7.9 inches) below
surface, and the feature extended to a depth of 85.0 centimeters (33.5 inches) below surface
(Figures 6-65 to 6-66). The sediment matrix within the feature consists of a highly friable, mottled
light gray to light grayish-brown, ashy clay with abundant charcoal inclusions. Cultural materials
are abundant within the matrix of the feature. This feature may represent a fire pit filled with
domestic debris.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on the site were primarily encountered within the pit feature
observed in ST JL330, though a shallow subsurface scatter of artifacts was also observed in
shovel tests excavated in the other depressions on the site. Cultural materials included 50 to
60 whiteware ceramic sherds (Figure 6-67), 60 to 80 glass shards (including some amethyst glass
shards) (Figure 6-68), one whole brown glass snuff bottle (Figure 6-69), numerous pieces of metal
hardware and square nails (Figure 6-70), a brass rivet, three indeterminate copper or brass
objects, one indeterminate lead object, 40 to 50 pieces of indeterminate metal scrap, five to
10 pieces of burned faunal bone, and one burned brick fragment. The cultural materials are
generally diagnostic of a late 19th to early 20th-century occupation.

Historical Research
No structures appear at this location on historical aerial imagery dating from 1958 onwards
or on historical USGS topographic maps dating from 1956 onwards, so it appears that the
sharecropper farmstead mentioned by the landowner had been abandoned and
demolished/removed by the mid-20th century. No deed research was conducted at the Brazos
County Clerk’s office in Anderson, Texas, for this tract, though Mr. Cook indicated that the
property has been in his family for “about a hundred years or more.”
Summary and Recommendations
Site 41BZ181 consists of a moderate-density subsurface scatter of late 19th- to early 20thcentury domestic debris on a prominent upland ridge overlooking an unnamed tributary of Brushy
Creek to the north. According to Morgan Cook, Jr., the current landowner, the site was once the
location of a small sharecropper farmstead on his family’s land. He indicated that other
sharecropper cabins were once present on the ranch as well. Four large depressions are visible
on the modern ground surface that may represent cultural features associated with the former
farmstead, and a shovel test excavated in one of these depressions revealed a large pit filled with
burned soil and an abundance of late 19th to early 20th century domestic debris. Mr. Cook
indicated that the property has been owned by his family since at least the early 20th century,
though this was not corroborated by independent deed research.
While no standing farm buildings or other aboveground cultural features are present on
site 41BZ181, the site is associated with the agricultural development of Brazos County during
the late 19th and early 20th centuries. While the Cook family may have a long-standing history
of owning and ranching in Brazos County, the Cook family does not rise to the level of historical
significance. However, at least one cultural feature is present on the site, an apparently intact
trash pit, that contains an abundance of domestic debris dating to the time period of the historicage occupation, and the site may possess some research value regarding late 19th to early 20th
century ranching operations and rural living. Additional significance testing and historical
research would be needed to fully evaluate the NRHP eligibility of the site. As such, site 41BZ181
is recommended to be of undetermined eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP.

6.10

41BZ182
General Description

Site 41BZ182 consists of a low-density, subsurface scatter of aboriginal lithic debitage
located on the southeastern terrace of Thompson’s Creek in Brazos County (Figures 6-71 to 673; also see Figure 6-3). Existing subsurface pipeline and overhead transmission line ROWs
pass through the southwestern portion of the site. Vegetation within the existing pipeline and
transmission line corridor consists of dense, short grasses. The wooded fringe on either side of
the cleared existing utility corridor consists of moderately dense stands of dewberry, yaupon, oak,
honey locust, and greenbrier. A modern 1.5-story, wood-frame hay barn is located within the
investigated site area. While the barn does contain a few construction materials salvaged from
an older structure or structures, the barn is of relatively recent construction and does not appear
on historical aerial photographs until the early 2000s; as such, the structure is not of historic age.

The terrace on which the site is situated slopes down gradually to the northwest toward
Thompson’s Creek, ranging in elevation from 103.6 to 105.2 meters (340.0 to 345.0 feet) amsl.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of subsurface aboriginal cultural materials observed in shovel
tests and backhoe trenches, site 41BZ182 measures approximately 75.0 meters (246.1 feet)
northeast to southwest by 40.0 meters (131.2 feet) northwest to southeast. The site was
investigated only within the current project’s linear survey corridor, and the site boundaries may
continue farther to the northeast and southwest along the edge of Thompson’s Creek.
A total of 16 shovel tests and two backhoe trenches were excavated on and near the site.
Four shovel tests and one backhoe trench were positive for cultural resources. Cultural resources
were observed at depths ranging from 20.0 to 70.0 centimeters (7.9 to 27.6 inches) below surface
in shovel tests and from 0.0 to 77.0 centimeters (0.0 to 30.3 inches) below surface in BHT-13.
Sediments observed in shovel tests consist of sand, sandy loam, and sandy clay loam overlying
dense clay and sandy clay subsoils at depths ranging from 35.0 to 80.0 centimeters (13.8 to
31.5 inches) below surface. It is Horizon’s opinion that the depth of archeological deposits was
fully assessed via shovel testing within the investigated portion of the site and that more deeply
buried cultural resources likely are not present.
Observed Cultural Features
No intact aboriginal cultural features or evidence of cultural features (such as burned
rocks) were observed on the modern ground surface or in any of the shovel tests excavated on
site 41BZ182.
A modern hay barn is present within the investigated portion of the site. This 1.5-story
agricultural structure is constructed with wood framing and corrugated steel siding and roofing.
While a few construction elements may derive from older structures, the barn itself is of modern
construction and does not appear on historical aerial photographs until the early 2000s (NETR
2018). Two additional structures (a house and a second barn) and an artificial pond are visible
on modern aerial imagery southeast of the site off the northwestern side of Gopher Lane. As no
historic-age cultural materials or features were observed within the project area or within the
boundaries of site 41BZ182, these additional structures to the east were not investigated as they
fall outside the boundaries of the current project area, and it is unknown whether they are of
historic or modern age.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41BZ182 consist of a small assemblage of lithic
debitage, including 5 to 10 tertiary flakes and 2 to 5 secondary flakes from shovel tests (Figure 674) and an additional 11 tertiary flakes in BHT-13. No temporally diagnostic cultural materials or
preserved floral or faunal remains were observed.

Summary and Recommendations
Site 41BZ182 consists of a low-density, subsurface scatter of aboriginal lithic debitage
located on the southeastern terrace of Thompson’s Creek. The site was investigated only within
the current project’s ROW, and the site boundaries may extend farther to the northeast and
southwest along the southeastern terrace of Thompson’s Creek. The southwestern portion of the
site lies within an existing, cleared ROW shared by a subsurface pipeline and an overhead
transmission line, and a modern barn has been constructed within a wooded area just northeast
of the cleared utility corridor. Observed cultural materials consist only of a small assemblage of
aboriginal lithic debitage encountered in shovel tests at depths of 20.0 to 70.0 centimeters (7.9 to
27.6 inches) below surface and from 0.0 to 77.0 centimeters (0.0 to 30.3 inches) below surface in
BHT-13. No intact aboriginal cultural features, temporally diagnostic artifacts, or preserved floral
or faunal remains were observed, and the site can be dated only to an undetermined prehistoric
timeframe. Based on the low artifact density, the lack of temporally diagnostic cultural materials,
and the extent of prior disturbances, the site possesses minimal research value. As such, Horizon
recommends the portion of site 41BZ182 within the current project’s ROW is non-contributing to
the overall eligibility of the site for inclusion in the NRHP.

LITTLE WICKSON CREEK TRIBUTARY BRIDGE
General Description

The eponymously named Little Wickson Creek Tributary Bridge is a historic-age, concreteslab bridge that carries a dirt farm road over an unnamed tributary of Little Wickson Creek in
Brazos County (Figures 6-75 to 6-76; also see Figure 6-4). The dirt farm road connects Dilly
Shaw Tap Road to the south to Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 974 (a.k.a. Tabor Road) to the north
in a rural area northeast of College Station. The surrounding land is used as a cattle pasture, and
vegetation consists of short grasses. Elevations at the location of the bridge are relatively flat,
averaging roughly 100.6 meters (330.0 feet) amsl.
As no historic-age cultural materials or other cultural features were observed in
association with the bridge, this isolated engineering feature was recorded as a historic-age object
but was not documented as an archeological site or submitted for a permanent trinomial.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
No cultural materials, either aboriginal or historic-age, were observed in association with
the small field road bridge. As such, the boundaries of this resource are considered to be the
dimensions of the bridge structure, which measures 10.4 meters (34.0 feet) in length running
north to south (i.e., bank to bank) by 4.9 meters (16.0 feet) in width.
Observed Cultural Features
This cultural resource consists of a concrete-slab bridge that spans an unnamed tributary
of Little Wickson Creek. The deck slab is covered with a layer of asphalt. Concrete square curbs
line the deck. The substructure is composed of concrete wing walls and full-height abutments
that secure the bridge to the embankments, while two solid-wall concrete piers stabilize the bridge
within the waterway. A third pier has collapsed. The date of construction is estimated at ca. 1945
and was likely a privately sponsored endeavor as the bridge is not on a county or state road. A
manufacturer or date stamp was not identified, and the bridge is not listed on the US Department
of Transportation’s (USDOT) National Bridge Inventory (USDOT 2018) or on the Historic Bridges
of Texas (TxDOT 2018) database.
Observed Cultural Materials
No cultural materials, either aboriginal or historic-age, were observed in association with
the Little Wickson Creek Tributary Bridge.
Historical Research
Reinforced concrete bridges became popular following World War II as they were
relatively simple to design, required inexpensive materials to build, and could span relatively short
distances, making them an ideal structure to cross waterways in rural farm or ranch settings. By
1945, farmers and ranchers were dependent on trucks to transport livestock, supplies, and
agricultural projects to and from farming and ranching operations. In addition, deed research
conducted at the Brazos County Clerk’s office in Bryan, Texas, for the parcel on which the Little

Wickson Creek Tributary Bridge is located revealed that several mineral leases were signed over
the years. The bridge may have partially served to carry oil and gas equipment across the parcel.
In 1940, H.O. Boatwright transferred the parcel on which this bridge would be constructed
to First National Bank (Table 6-4). In 1943, R.W. Caldwell purchased the property from the bank.
The parcel was transferred to Charlie Patranella in 1948 and remained in the Patranella family
until 2010, when it was sold to the current landowners, Janice and JoAnn Albert. Caldwell is a
recognizable family name in Texas history. The city of Caldwell was named the county seat of
Burleson County, and Caldwell County was named for Matthew Caldwell, a signer of the Texas
Declaration of Independence. However, there is no known direct family tie between R.W.
Caldwell and Matthew Caldwell. The Patranella family owned the parcel through the latter half of
the 20th century.
The bridge constructed on the property is an example of a prolific type of bridge built during
the mid-20th century. Rural roads were improved all over the state during the 1940s. This bridge
may have been constructed at a time when FM 974 was improved, or at a time when the Caldwell

or Patranella families had a need for a shortcut across their farm to connect farming or ranching
operations with nearby roadways.
Examination of historical aerial photographs clearly depict the small road on which this
bridge was constructed on a 1960 aerial photograph (NETR 2018). This short road connected
Dilly Shaw Tap Road to the south and FM 974 (a.k.a. Tabor Road) to the north. On the 1961
aerial photograph, the road appears to be slightly overgrown, and this may reflect the date at
which the road fell out of regular use. Subsequent aerial photographs show the road becoming
less and less distinct, eventually evolving into the ephemeral dirt field road visible today.
Summary and Recommendations
The Little Wickson Creek Tributary Bridge is a concrete-slab field road bridge constructed
on a privately owned rural parcel northeast of College Station. The date of construction is
estimated at ca. 1945 and was likely a privately sponsored endeavor at a time when the parcel
was owned by either the Caldwell or Patranella families. The construction of concrete-slab
bridges on rural farms was typical practice during this time period. This type of bridge is found
throughout the state and is recognized as a post-World War II bridge type. The concrete-slab
bridge was vastly popular after 1945 and was widely utilized as a functional, economical watercrossing structure. This bridge is a typical, solid pier slab bridge with no notable architectural
details, unique construction methods, or materials. The resource is not a particularly good
example of a concrete slab bridge. This water crossing is not known to be associated with a
particular significant event in history.
This bridge is only generally associated with
farming/ranching practices in the mid-20th century in rural Brazos County and possibly with the
oil and gas extraction industry. Neither R.W. Caldwell nor the Patranella family of Brazos County
are known to be people of particular historical importance, and the resource is not known to be
associated with an important person or family. No archeological deposits are associated with the
bridge. As such, Horizon recommends that the Little Wickson Creek Tributary Bridge is not
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

41RT129
General Description

Site 41RT129 is a multiple-component, low-density, surface and subsurface, aboriginal
and historic-age artifact scatter situated on an upland ridge framed by Pin Oak Creek to the
northwest and one of its unnamed tributaries to the northeast (Figures 6-77 to 6-79; also see
Figure 6-2). The site is located in a rural area southeast of Hearne in Robertson County, and it
is traversed by US 190/SH 6 and by existing subsurface pipeline and transmission line ROWs.
Site 41RT129 was originally recorded by Daymond Crawford in 1980 in connection with a project
sponsored by the State Department of Highways and Public Transportation, one of TxDOT’s
former monikers. At that time, the site was described as an expansive scatter of aboriginal lithic
debris and one biface fragment in a formerly plowed field.

Chapter 6.0: Results of Investigations: Jurisdictional Areas

It is not clear whether or not any subsurface investigations were conducted on the site in 1980; in
any case, the depth of archeological deposits is not mentioned on the site form.
Horizon revisited site 41RT129 during the cultural resources survey for the current project.
The current project’s ROW passes through the northeastern end of the previously delineated site
boundary located northeast of and parallel to the US 190/SH 6 ROW along the northeastern edge
of an existing ROW shared by a subsurface pipeline and overhead transmission line. An improved
gravel road passes along the northeastern site boundary, providing access from the highway to
a farmstead located farther to the northeast. Vegetation within the portion of the site investigated
by Horizon consists of short, dense grasses, and wooded areas surround the site. The
investigated site area has been heavily bioturbated, as indicated by numerous ant mounds on
which patches of artifacts have been churned up from subsurface contexts. The upland landform
on which the site is located slopes downward moderately sharply toward Pin Oak Creek to the
northwest and one of its unnamed tributaries to the northeast, and elevations range from
approximately 85.3 to 93.0 meters (280.0 to 305.0 feet) amsl.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
At the time site 41RT129 was originally recorded in 1980, it covered an expansive area
across the crest and slopes of an upland ridge measuring approximately 500.0 meters
(1,640.4 feet) northeast to southwest by 300.0 meters (984.3 feet) northwest to southeast. The
majority of the previously documented area of the site is located on the southwestern side of
US 190/SH 6. At the time, artifacts appear to have been observed only in disturbed surficial
contexts, and no subsurface investigations appear to have been conducted.
As the current project’s ROW passes just barely within the northeastern margin of the
previously delineated site boundaries, Horizon’s investigations covered only a limited portion of
the overall site area. The site was investigated only within the current survey corridor, and Horizon
did not alter the originally delineated site boundaries.
A total of 15 shovel tests were excavated on and near the site, four of which were positive
for cultural resources. Aboriginal and historic-age artifacts were observed in mixed contexts
extending from depths of 30.0 to 50.0 centimeters (11.8 to 19.7 inches) below surface.
Sediments observed in shovel tests consist of sandy loam and sandy clay loam, and dense clay
subsoil was observed in the majority of shovel tests excavated on the site at depths of 30.0 to
65.0 centimeters (11.8 to 25.6 inches) below surface. Cultural materials were also observed on
the modern ground surface on top of ant mounds; these artifacts were most likely churned up
from subsurface contexts by insect activity. It is Horizon’s opinion that the depth of archeological
deposits was fully assessed via shovel testing and that more deeply buried cultural resources
likely are not present on the site.
Observed Cultural Features
No cultural features, either aboriginal or historic-age, were observed on the modern
ground surface or in any of the shovel tests excavated on the site during Horizon’s investigations.
Several standing structures are visible on modern aerial imagery on the part of the site located

southwest of US 190/SH 6; however, these structures fall well outside the boundaries of the
survey corridor and were not investigated by Horizon.
Observed Cultural Materials
Aboriginal and historic-age cultural materials were observed in mixed sediment contexts
completely lacking in any apparent stratigraphic separation. Aboriginal cultural materials consist
of exclusively of lithic debitage, including approximately 6 secondary and 12 tertiary flakes
(Figure 6-80). Debitage was manufactured from fine-grained, grayish-brown and yellowish-brown
chert, and several pieces showed signs of heat treatment. No temporally diagnostic aboriginal
cultural materials were observed, and the aboriginal component on the site can only be dated to
an undetermined prehistoric timeframe.
Historic-age artifacts consisted of two whiteware ceramic sherds, four square nails, one
olive green glass shard, one amber glass shard, two clear glass shards, and one heavily patinated
aqua glass shards (Figure 6-81). The presence of square nails is suggestive of a historic-age
occupation possibly dating as early as the late 19th century, though square nails have remained
available alongside their more commonly used counterparts, round wire nails, through the
20th and 21st centuries.
A small faunal bone fragment and a small piece of charcoal were also observed in one
shovel test; however, due to the mixing of aboriginal and historic-age deposits, it is not clear

whether these items are associated with the aboriginal or historic-age components. Given the
high degree of disturbance observed, it is likely they of historic age.
Summary and Recommendations
Site 41Rt129 consists of a low-density surface and subsurface scatter of aboriginal and
historic-age cultural materials derived from heavily disturbed, mixed contexts on a prominent ridge
overlooking the confluence of Pin Oak Creek and one of its unnamed tributaries. The site was
originally recorded in 1980 as an extensive, albeit low-density, scatter of aboriginal lithic debris
and one biface. Horizon’s current investigations covered only a very limited portion of the
previously delineated site area located northeast of US 190/SH 6. The investigated area of the
site has been heavily disturbed by prior construction of a subsurface pipeline and overhead
transmission line and by insect bioturbation. Aboriginal lithic artifacts and historic-age artifacts
were observed in mixed surficial and subsurface contexts to a depth of 50.0 centimeters
(19.7 inches) below surface. No temporally diagnostic aboriginal cultural materials were
observed, and the aboriginal component can only be dated to an undetermined prehistoric
timeframe. Historic-age artifacts generally consisted of domestic debris indicative of late 19th- to
20th-century domestic and/or farming activities on the site. Available historical aerial photographs
for this area extend back only to 1995, though historical USGS topographic maps dating back to
1964 indicate that there have been no standing structures within the investigated portion of the
site since at least the mid-20th century. It is possible a small late 19th- or early 20th-century
farmstead could have been located off the northeastern side of US 190/SH 6 within the

investigated site area at one time, though it is equally likely that the observed historic-age cultural
materials simply represent the remains of a historic-age dumping episode of general field scatter.
While historical deed research was not conducted for the parcel on which the investigated portion
of site 41RT129 is located, the investigated portion of the site does not contain any architectural
or cultural features that could convey any significance that the site may possess by virtue of any
association with persons or events of historical note. As such, Horizon recommends that both
the aboriginal and historic-age components of site 41RT129 located within the current project’s
ROW are non-contributing to the overall eligibility of the site for inclusion in the NRHP.

7.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS:
NON-JURISDICTIONAL AREAS

As discussed in the previous chapter, a total of 16 archeological sites and one historicage bridge (which was not recorded as an archeological site) were documented as a result of the
cultural resources survey of Magellan’s proposed East Houston to Hearne Pipeline ROW in
Grimes, Brazos, and Robertson counties. The previous chapter presented descriptions of cultural
resources located within portions of the overall ROW that are subject to regulatory jurisdiction via
Section 106 of the NHPA and/or the Antiquities Code of Texas. The current chapter presents
descriptions of archeological sites recorded during the survey that currently do not fall within
regulated portions of the overall ROW and therefore would not be subject to regulatory jurisdiction.
These sites were recorded as a result of the 100% survey methodology employed for the project,
which included survey of segments of the ROW that fall outside of regulated areas. While these
sites currently are not considered to fall within regulated portions of the pipeline ROW, NRHP
eligibility recommendations are offered in the event that the regulatory boundaries should change.
A total of five archeological sites were recorded during the survey that do not fall within
portions of the proposed ROW that are currently considered to be subject to regulatory jurisdiction
(Table 7-1; Figures 7-1 to 7-6). All six sites are newly recorded cultural resources discovered
during the current survey. Aboriginal cultural components consisting of surface and/or subsurface
scatters of lithic artifacts of undetermined prehistoric age were recorded on three of the sites
(41GM479, 41GM480, and 41RT610). Historic-age components dating from the late 19th to 20th
centuries were observed on four of the sites (41GM480, 41GM483, and 41BZ180). One of the
sites (41GM480) is a multiple-component site containing both aboriginal and historic-age cultural
components. Each site is discussed in more detail below.

7.1

41GM479
General Description

Site 41GM479 consists of a low-density, subsurface scatter of aboriginal lithic debitage on
the gentle south-facing slopes of a rolling upland landform between two unnamed tributaries of
Grassy Creek (Figures 7-7 to 7-8; also see Figure 7-6). The site is situated in an open cattle
pasture, and vegetation on the site consists of medium grasses with clusters of dewberry and
greenbrier. Topography on the site slopes down gently to the south toward an unnamed tributary
of Grassy Creek, and elevations range from 109.1 to 110.3 meters (358.0 to 362.0 feet) amsl.

Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Site 41GM479 consists only of three pieces of aboriginal lithic debitage observed within
two adjacent shovel tests, defining a site area of approximately 30.0 meters (98.4 feet) northwest
to southeast by 20.0 meters (65.6 feet) northeast to southwest. A total of eight shovel tests were
excavated on and near the site, two of which were positive for cultural resources at depths of
50.0 to 80.0 centimeters (19.7 to 31.5 inches) below surface. Sediments observed in shovel tests
consist of moderately deep sandy loam and sand overlying sandy clay and clay, and clayey
subsoil was encountered in most of the shovel tests excavated on the site at depths ranging from
50.0 to 100.0 centimeters (19.7 to 31.5 inches) below surface. It is Horizon’s opinion that the
archeological deposits on site 41GM479 were fully assessed via shovel testing and that more
deeply buried cultural resources likely are not present on the site.
Observed Cultural Features
No cultural features or indirect evidence of cultural features (such as burned rocks) were
observed on the modern ground surface or in any of the shovel tests excavated on site 41GM479.

Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41GM479 consist of three pieces of lithic debitage
manufactured from medium brown and gray chert (Figure 7-9). No temporally diagnostic artifacts
were observed, and the site can only be dated to an undetermined prehistoric timeframe based
on the available evidence. No preserved floral or faunal remains were observed on the site.
Summary and Recommendations
Site 41GM479 consists of a sparse, subsurface scatter of aboriginal lithic debitage on the
slopes of an upland landform situated between two unnamed tributaries of Grassy Creek. Cultural
materials observed on the site consist of three pieces of lithic debitage observed in two adjacent
shovel tests at depths of 50.0 to 80.0 centimeters (19.7 to 31.5 inches) below surface. No cultural
materials were observed in additional shovel tests excavated on the site surrounding the initial
two positive shovel tests. The three flakes observed on the site were moderately deeply buried
within a sand mantle overlying clay subsoil, and sediments appear to be largely intact. However,
the ephemeral archeological deposits observed on site 41GM479 possess minimal research
value aside from the locational information already recorded. As such, Horizon recommends that
site 41GM479 is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

41GM480
General Description

Site 41GM480 is a multiple-component site situated on the crest and northwestern
shoulder of an upland ridge that overlooks Turkey Creek to the northwest. The main cultural
component consists of a late 19th to mid-20th-century farmstead that includes a collapsed log
and frame structure, a partially collapsed wood-frame National Folk house, a wood-frame barn
with an attached animal corral, and two concrete cisterns (Figure 7-10 to 7-20; also see Figure 75). A minor aboriginal component is represented by two pieces of lithic debitage found in a single
shovel test excavated on the site. The site is accessed via a private gravel driveway from
FM 3090 to the southeast, though the road becomes an overgrown two-track path by the time it
reaches the site. The farmstead is abandoned, though a relatively modern equipment shed has
been constructed farther east on the parcel, well beyond the boundaries of the current project
area, that may still be in use. The site is situated in an open cattle pasture, and vegetation consists
mainly of dense, short grasses with scattered oak and hackberry trees. Elevations across the
site are relatively flat, though they begin to slope gently down to the northwest toward Turkey
Creek in the northwestern portion of the site, and elevations range from approximately 75.6 to
79.2 meters (248.0 to 260.0 feet) amsl.

Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of structural remains and cultural features on the site, site
41GM480 measures approximately 108.0 meters (354.3 feet) northwest to southeast by
82.0 meters (269.0 feet) northeast to southwest. The site falls largely to the southwest of the
project’s linear survey corridor.
A total of 11 shovel tests were excavated on and near the site, only one of which was
positive for cultural resources. One wire nail and two aboriginal chert flakes were found in the
single shovel test (ST JL409) at depths of 0.0 to 30.0 centimeters (0.0 to 11.8 inches) below
surface. Sediments observed in shovel tests consist of shallow sandy loam overlying clay and
marl subsoil at depths of 10.0 to 40.0 centimeters (3.9 to 15.7 inches) below surface. It is
Horizon’s opinion that the depth of archeological deposits was fully assessed via shovel testing
and that more deeply buried cultural resources likely are not present on the site.
Observed Cultural Features
Five cultural features were observed on site 41GM480, including a collapsed log and
frame structure (Resource A), a partially collapsed wood-frame house (Resource B), a woodframe barn with an attached animal corral (Resource C), and two concrete cisterns (Resources D
and E).
Resource A is a debris pile measuring approximately 9.1 meters (30.0 feet) by
10. 7meters (35.0 feet) in size that represents the remains of a collapsed log structure (see
Figures 7-11 to 7-14). The structure was constructed from large, split logs and square and wire
nails. An intact corner of the structure demonstrates hand-hewn saddle-notch and square-notch
joinery of the logs. Some of the wood construction material has holes consistent with peg holes
for mortise and tenon joinery. At the southern end of the same debris pile are remnants of what
appears to be a second structure constructed of wooden planks and a wood-frame roof with
wooden shingles. Though the function of the structure is undetermined, the material and
construction methods suggest a ca. 1880 construction date. Log houses were often constructed
as an initial domestic structure until a larger, more permanent structure could be built. Log
construction was also used for agricultural buildings, such as animal shelters, and the logs and
other building materials (including nails and stonework) were often salvaged from log structures
and reused or repurposed on farmsteads.
Resource B is a ca. 1910 National Folk house with multiple phases of additions and
modifications (see Figures 7-15 to 7-20). The house is supported on a pier-and-beam foundation,
with piers varying between concrete blocks and cut limestone blocks. The house is constructed
of board and battens (also known as “box strip” construction), in which the board and batten walls
are structural with framing members primarily limited to the window and door openings. The
house is 1.5 stories tall, with a side-gabled roof extending to a lower slope (i.e., shed roof) over a
partially enclosed porch on the northeastern side. Standing seam metal serves as roofing
material, though there are remnants of cedar shake shingles. The original part of the house is
sided with rolled asphalt shingle cladding. A six-over-six, wood-framed sash window is present
on the southern side of the house, and a fixed, four-light wood window is present on the enclosed

Cultural Resources Assessment of USACE Jurisdictional Areas and TMPA Property on the Proposed

section of the northeastern porch. A large, rectangular, one-story board and batten addition is
attached to the northern side of the house and extends to the west. The house measures roughly
15.2 meters (50.0 feet) square. Based on what remains of this part of the building, this addition
included four rooms separated by board and batten interior walls and wood-plank flooring. The
house is outfitted with electrical and plumbing systems. Some of the more recent additions to the
house, such as the bathroom addition, appear to have been constructed during the 1960s.
The house originally may have been constructed as a typical National Folk house with a
hall-and-parlor floorplan (i.e., two rooms wide by one room deep) and subsequently added onto
as family needs dictated. There may have been a small sleeping loft within the upper gables of
the house. Many farms in this area were occupied by tenant farmers and sharecroppers, and this
structure may have been constructed as a tenant farmer house. The lack of stylistic details, the
modest size, and the use of somewhat utilitarian construction materials suggest that this house
was constructed for functionality. The building is in poor condition.
Resource C is a livestock pole barn with an attached animal corral constructed of
dimensional lumber and wooden poles (Figures 7-21 to 7-24). The barn is rectangular in footprint,
measuring 17.0 meters (55.8 feet) northeast to southwest by 8.0 meters (26.2 feet) northwest to
southeast. The barn is sheltered with an end-gabled, corrugated metal roof, and the horizontal
plank wood walls are clad with corrugated metal siding. A vertical wood plank, single-entry door
is positioned on the northwestern wall of the barn. This door leads into a small room (possibly a
former tack room) with a wood plank floor. On the interior, a long, lap-jointed ridge beam supports
multiple notched rafters that extend over sills to support the roof. The interior space is roughly
divided into animal pens and has a dirt floor. A vertical plank, wood-fenced corral is adjacent to
the southeastern façade of the barn. The estimated construction date of the barn is ca. 1950,
though a portion of the structure either may be of earlier construction or could have included some
reused older construction materials.
Two formed concrete cisterns are located on the site. One of the cisterns, Resource D, is
located to the northwest of the barn (Resource C), and the other (Resource E) is located on the
other end of the site southeast of the collapsed log structure debris pile (Resource A).
The northwestern cistern, Resource D, measures 1.5 meters (5.0 feet) in diameter and is
mounted on a 2.4-meter- (8.0-foot-) square concrete pad (Figure 7-25). The concrete pad is
inscribed with a “1965” date along with several family names, including “Andrew Jackson
Hughes,” “Jasper Jackson Hughes,” “Charles Edwards Hughes,” and “Mama Katie.” The cistern
likely once had a circular concrete lid, though the lid was not observed on the site. This cistern
presumably dates to 1965 based on the inscription on the concrete pad.
The southeastern cistern, Resource E, measures 1.4 meters (4.5 feet) in diameter and is
surrounded by a small wooden fence (Figure 7-26). This cistern is primarily a below-ground
feature, with the concrete lid positioned vertically adjacent to the structure. This cistern may also
date from ca. 1965, though its location near the older, collapsed log structure (Resource A) may
suggest an earlier data of construction.

Observed Cultural Materials
Historic-age artifacts on site 41GM480 are sparse, including two red-cherry brick
fragments, one of which bears a “FERRIS” maker’s mark, and roughly five wire nails. Two pieces
of aboriginal lithic debitage were also observed in a single positive shovel test excavated on the
site that also yielded a wire nail. Both pieces of aboriginal lithic debitage were manufactured from
yellowish-brown, fine-grained chert.
Historical Research
Deed research conducted at the Grimes County Clerk’s office in Anderson, Texas,
indicates that the initial transfer of this parcel occurred on October 17, 1877, when it was
composed of 342.0 acres, from Joseph Pearson to William A. Steel (Table 7-2). The parcel is
part of the original William Holland Tract (Abstract 185), though the transfer of title from William
Holland to William Steel was not found (nor were any records of William Holland as a grantor in
the 1800s). The parcel that includes site 41GM480 passed through the ownership of the Pearson,
Steel, and Hughes families (through deed of sale or family wills) until 1978, when it was purchased
by John and Carolyn Pierce. In 1893, William and Elizabeth Steel’s estate was partitioned among
their heirs, including J.J. Steel, John Steel, Thomas Steel, and Edgar Steel to A.J. Hughes. A
portion of the original acreage was also transferred back to Joseph Pearson in 1898 and later in
1899. In 1913, A.J. Hughes sold 100.0 acres of the parcel to W.J. Hughes; later, in 1945, W.J.
Hughes transferred to the parcel to Jasper Hughes.
The historical resources identified on site 41WM480 have construction dates that span a
range of time and occupation periods. The remains of the log structure (Resource A) may date
to the occupation period between 1877 and 1893 when William Steel owned the land. This
structure may have served as an initial residence or possibly a support structure. The 1.5-story,
wood-frame, National Folk house (Resource B) has an estimated construction date of ca. 1910
and may have been constructed during the occupation of A.J. Hughes and his family. The
cisterns, constructed in 1965, bear the inscriptions of the Hughes family names, including Jasper,
who purchased/acquired the property in 1964 with his wife, Katie. In the 1980s, the property was
sold to the current owner, John Pierce.
Historical aerial photographs show that this farmstead was operational in 1958 and 1959,
though earlier images were not available (NETR 2018). Earlier historical USGS topographic maps
dating to 1914 and 1942 do not show any structures at this location, though these early maps
often do not depict individual structures, and it is likely that the farmstead had, in fact, been
established during the early 20th century based on other evidence. There is a substantial gap
between the 1959 aerial photograph and the next one in the series, which dates to 1995. It is
apparent on the 1995 image that the buildings had fallen into a state of disrepair, and it is likely
that the farmstead had been abandoned for some time by 1995.
Summary and Recommendations
Site 41GM480 is a multiple-component site situated on the crest and northwestern
shoulder of an upland ridge that overlooks Turkey Creek to the northwest. The main cultural
component consists of a late 19th to mid-20th-century farmstead that consists of a ca. 1880

collapsed log and frame structure (Resource A), a ca. 1910 partially collapsed National Folk
wood-frame house (Resource B), a ca. 1950 wood-frame barn with an attached animal corral
(Resource C), and two ca. 1965 concrete cisterns (Resources D and E).. Some of the more
recent additions to the ca. 1910 house (Resource B), such as a bathroom addition, appear to
have been constructed during the 1960s. A minor aboriginal component is represented by two
pieces of lithic debitage found in a single shovel test excavated on the site. Historical aerial
photographs show that this farmstead still functioned in 1958 and 1959, though it appears to have
been abandoned for some time by 1995, at which time the structures visible on aerial imagery
appear to have fallen into disrepair.
The historical resources identified on site 41GM480 reflect an occupation beginning in the
late 19th century and continuing through the mid-20th century and are consistent with domestic
and agricultural features found in rural areas of Grimes County. Following the construction of the
railroads (nearby Navasota had three separate lines by 1900), rural areas that once were
somewhat isolated now had access to mass-produced building materials, including sash
windows, milled lumber, and quarried stone. Frame houses replaced log-built houses that
provided shelter on early rural farmsteads. The post-railroad, minimalist house style is known as
National Folk and was a prolific style found throughout the region. The style is known for its ease
of construction, inexpensive materials, and efficient living suitable to warm climates. Resource B
on site 41GM480 retains some semblance of this style, though it has undergone what appear to
be numerous modifications and additions from its initial construction in ca. 1910 through the
1960s. Much of the historical fabric and footprint have been substantially altered, and the house
is in very poor condition. Overall, the house is not a particularly unique or distinct architectural
style or design, and the structure is not a good representative of the National Folk style due to the
poor condition and substantial alterations. The nearby collapsed log structure, Resource A, does
not convey any particular style and only minimally retains a reflection of log construction
techniques. The livestock barn, Resource C, is constructed in a typical form found throughout
the 20th century and does not represent a particular architectural style. The concrete cisterns,
Resources D and E, are not a unique type or style, nor are they representative of a significant
agricultural practice or technology.
The small community of Erwin, located approximately 0.8 kilometer (0.5 mile) east of site
41GM480 near the headwaters of Turkey Creek, was composed of cotton farmers and cattle
ranchers, and a cotton gin operated in the community by the 1890s (TSHA 2018b). A Methodist
chapel, recorded as Steel’s Chapel, was once located in Erwin, and the Steele Grove Cemetery
is located off of FM 3090 approximately 0.5 kilometer (0.3 mile) northeast of the site. Though it
is unknown if there was a direct connection between the Steel Chapel, the Steele Grove
Cemetery, and W.A. Steel and/or W.M. Steel, the late 19th-century owners of the parcel on which
site 41GM480 is located, there is a strong likelihood of a connection due to the close proximity of
this parcel to the Erwin community. The Pearson, Steel, and Hughes families contributed to the
overall agricultural development of the county and possibly the community of Erwin; however,
there are no known associations between these families and historically significant events, and
the architectural remains observed on site 41GM480 do not retain sufficient integrity to convey
any significance that these families may have had at the local level.

Chapter 7.0: Results of Investigations: Non-Jurisdictional Areas

Archeological deposits on site 41GM480 are ephemeral, consisting of two bricks, a wire
nail, and two pieces of aboriginal lithic debitage, observed in shallowly buried disturbed contexts.
Based on the poor condition of the architectural remains, the absence of archeological
deposits, and the lack of association with persons or events of historical note, site 41GM480 is
recommended as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

7.3

41GM483
General Description

Site 41GM483 consists of the remnants of a small mid-20th- to early 21st-century
homestead or farmstead located on a gently rolling upland ridge above the floodplain of Gibbons
Creek to the west (Figures 7-27 to 7-31; also see Figure 7-4). Currently, the site consists of a
square, poured concrete foundation that probably once supported a small structure, a metal well
head, and a round concrete slab that may once have covered a cistern (though no evidence of
the cistern was observed). The site is located on Moody Ranch and is accessed via an improved
gravel road that provides access from FM 190 to the south. The gravel road passes
northeastwards to the east of the site, and a smaller two-track or dirt road turnaround is dimly
visible branching off of the gravel road and providing access to the site. The site is somewhat
overgrown, and vegetation consists of dense, short grasses, weeds, and greenbrier with scattered
yaupon, live oak, elm, and hackberry trees. Topography within the site is relatively flat, averaging
approximately 73.2 to 74.7 meters (240.0 to 245.0 feet) amsl, and elevations begin to slope down
toward Gibbons Creek more strongly to the west of the site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of cultural features observed on the site and, to a lesser degree,
the extent of a sparse surficial scatter of historic-age artifacts, site 41GM483 measures
approximately 43.0 meters (141.1 feet) north to south by 47.0 meters (154.2 feet) east to west.
The site was investigated only within the current project’s linear survey corridor, though the site
does not appear to extend beyond the delineated boundaries.
A total of seven shovel tests were excavated on and near the site, none of which contained
any subsurface cultural materials. Sediments observed in shovel tests consist of a thin veneer of
sand and sandy loam overlying clay subsoil at depths of 25.0 to 30.0 centimeters (9.8 to
11.8 inches) below surface. It is Horizon’s opinion that the depth of archeological deposits was
fully assessed via shovel testing and that more deeply buried cultural resources likely are not
present on the site.
Observed Cultural Features
Two cultural features were observed on site 41GM483, including a square, formed
concrete foundation that probably once supported a small outbuilding and a metal well head
encased in a smaller concrete platform. The foundation is located in the southwestern portion of
the site and measures approximately 2.5 meters (8.2 feet) north to south by 2.0 meters (6.6 feet)
east to west. The foundation is heavily overgrown and lined with ornamental sandstone boulders

along its eastern side (see Figure 7-30). The metal well head is located toward the eastern side
of the site and is encased within a cracked, formed concrete platform measuring approximately
1.0 by 0.5 meter (3.3 by 1.6 feet) in size.
A circular, concrete cover was also observed that probably represents a cistern cover,
though a cistern was not observed on the site. A light fixture was also observed suspended from
a tree branch (see Figure 7-31).
Observed Cultural Materials
The only cultural materials observed on site 41GM483 include a red-cherry brick with a
“GROESBECK” maker’s stamp, a few scattered tile fragments, and scattered pieces of corrugated
metal sheeting. The sparse cultural materials observed are generally indicative of a 20th-century
occupation.
Historical Research
Examination of historical USGS topographic maps indicates that a house structure was
present on the site as early as 1962 (NETR 2018). An earlier 1956 USGS topographic map does
not show a structure at this location, and a 1959 aerial photograph is too indistinct to make out
whether or not the structure is present at this time, though the small driveway that provided access
to the site from the gravel road to the east is visible. Earlier images were not available for
inspection. The house remains visible on historical aerial photographs until 2014. The house
appears to have been relatively large and was located in the northwestern portion of the site. As
a concrete foundation was not observed in this area and only minimal construction debris was
observed on the site, it is likely the house had a pier-and-beam foundation and that the house
was moved sometime after 2014. No other outbuildings are evident on historical imagery.
Deed research conducted at the Grimes County Clerk’s office in Anderson, Texas,
indicates that the parcel on which site 41GM483 is located has been in the ownership of the
Moody family since at least the early 20th century (Table 7-3). As such, the small homestead or
farmstead that once stood on the site would have been associated with mid-20th- to 21st-century
ranching operations on the Moody Ranch but is not directly associated with any of the Moody
family’s homesteads. It may have served as a tenant farmstead or perhaps a small field office for
broader ranching operations.
Summary and Recommendations
Site 41GM483 consists of the remnants of a small mid-20th to early 21-century homestead
or farmstead located on a gently rolling upland ridge above the floodplain of Gibbons Creek to the
west. Currently, the site consists only of a square, poured concrete foundation that probably once
supported a small outbuilding, a metal well head, and a round concrete slab that may once have
covered a cistern (though no evidence of the cistern was observed). A house is also visible on
the site on historical aerial photographs dating from the mid-20th century until 2014, at which point
the house appears to have been removed from the site. The site is located on Moody Ranch and
would have been associated with broader ranching operations at the time of its occupation. While
the Moody family has a long-standing history of owning and ranching land in Grimes County and

is associated with the agricultural development of the county, the Moody family does not rise to
the level of historical significance. None of the standing architecture once present on site
41GM483 is currently present on the site, and all that remains are ephemeral cultural features.
Furthermore, the site does not contain any archeological deposits. Consequently, site 41GM483
does not possess sufficient integrity to convey the significance of a mid-20th century homestead,
and the site is recommended as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

7.4

41BZ180
General Description

Site 41BZ180 consists of a single architectural feature, an early to mid-20th-century
livestock barn situated on the southern slopes of a rolling upland located north of Bryan
(Figures 7-32 to 7-37; also see Figure 7-3). The barn is part of a larger complex of buildings
located to the east of the proposed project’s ROW that were not investigated during the current
survey. The associated farmstead includes at least one additional livestock barn and corral, an
equipment shed, possibly a garage, and a small house with a roof-plan consistent with a minimal
traditional or possibly a bungalow form. The larger farmstead is accessed via an unimproved twotrack driveway that provides access from FM 2223 to the northeast. The barn is located in a
moderately dense copse of oak, elm, hackberry, and yaupon with an understory of greenbrier and
dense grasses. The topography surrounding the barn is relatively flat, ranging only from
approximately 109.7 to 110.6 meters (360.0 to 363.0 feet) amsl.

Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
As documented during the current survey, the only cultural feature associated with site
41BZ180 that falls within the linear survey corridor is a livestock barn. For current purposes, the
site boundary was arbitrarily drawn surrounding the structure, and the site is considered to
measure approximately 28.0 meters (91.9 feet) northwest to southeast by 32.0 meters
(105.0 feet) northeast to southwest. Based on examination of modern aerial imagery, the larger
farmstead probably covers an area on the order of 125.0 meters (410.1 feet) in diameter, which
would encompass the additional structures present to the east of the barn.
A total of six shovel tests were excavated on and near the site, none of which contained
any subsurface cultural materials. Sediments observed in shovel tests consist of a moderately
thick mantle of sandy loam and loam overlying sandy clay and clay subsoil at depths ranging from
60.0 to 70.0 centimeters (23.6 to 27.6 inches) below surface. It is Horizon’s opinion that the depth
of archeological deposits was fully assessed via shovel testing and that more deeply buried
cultural resources likely are not present on the site.
Observed Cultural Features
The single cultural feature observed within the current project’s ROW on site 41BZ180
consists of a pole barn used to shelter livestock (see Figures 7-33 to 7-37). The structure is
rectangular in footprint, measuring approximately 12.0 meters (39.4 feet) northwest to southeast

H146-170124

199

Chapter 7.0: Results of Investigations: Non-Jurisdictional Areas

by 8.0 meters (26.2 feet) northeast to southwest. The pole barn is constructed of dimensional
lumber and cedar wooden posts, with wood planks forming the walls. Corrugated metal sheeting
clads the building, and wire nails secure the construction materials. A corrugated metal shed roof
supported by lap-jointed cedar poles and rafters shelters the barn. There is little evidence of
foundation material, with the exception of sill plates and posts secured in the ground in several
places. The southwestern façade is composed of three open bays supported by cedar posts. A
single-entry, vertical wood plank door leads to a small, wood-plank-enclosed room on the
southeastern end of the barn. Much of the barn is overgrown with brush, and the building is in
poor condition and not entirely accessible. The estimated construction date, based on the
construction methods and materials, is ca. 1950, but it could possibly date earlier within the
second quarter of the 20th century.
Observed Cultural Materials
No cultural materials were observed in association with the livestock barn.
Historical Research
According to historical aerial imagery, the barn and the associated farm buildings to the
east are visible as early as 1960, though earlier imagery was not available. Deed research was
conducted at the Brazos County Clerk’s office in Bryan, Texas, for the parcel on which site
41BZ180 is located (Table 7-4). The property was originally part of the Moses Baine tract
(Abstract 19). The property was traced back to the Echols family from 1928 to 1936, at which
time it was transferred to Emory and Allie Smith. Emory Smith’s estate was distributed in 1990,
when Lucille Hampton Smith acquired the property. The livestock barn, with an estimated
construction date of ca. 1950, was likely built during the tenure of the Smith family.
Summary and Recommendations
Site 41BZ180 consists of a single architectural feature, an early to mid-20th-century
livestock barn situated on the southern slopes of a rolling upland located north of Bryan. The

barn is part of a larger complex of buildings located to the east of the proposed project’s ROW
that were not investigated during the current survey. The associated farmstead includes at least
one additional livestock barn and corral, an equipment shed, possibly a garage, and a small house
with a roof-plan consistent with a minimal traditional or possibly a bungalow form. The estimated
date of construction of the livestock barn is ca. 1950, at which time the property would have been
owned by the Smith family.
Similar to many other families in rural Brazos County, the Smith and Echols families
occupied this property through much of the 20th century and likely raised cattle and possibly
sheep, which was a popular practice during this time period. The resource identified on the
property within the project area is consistent with livestock shelters found through the region
during this time period. The livestock barn is a support structure on a larger farmstead that was
not evaluated as part of this study. However, based on aerial photographs, the visible buildings
and structures on the parcel are associated with agricultural practices, livestock raising, and rural
domestic living and likely date around the same construction period within the 20th century. The
Smith and Echols families are not known to be of particular historical importance, and the property
is not known to be associated with an important person or family.
Overall, the livestock barn on site 41BZ180 is not reflective of a particularly unique or
distinct architectural style or design. Due to the poor condition and lack of distinctive architectural
details or notable features, it is not a good representation of a particular style. The livestock barn
is constructed in a typical form found throughout the 20th century. The integrity of workmanship,
design, materials, and feeling is compromised by the poor condition of the barn, and it does not
convey the historical sense of a mid-20th-century farm complex. No archeological deposits are
present surrounding the barn. As such, Horizon recommends that the livestock barn and the
portion of site 41BZ180 located within the current project’s ROW are non-contributing to the
overall eligibility of the site for inclusion in the NRHP.

41RT610
General Description

Site 41RT610 consists of a moderate-density surface and subsurface scatter of aboriginal
lithic debitage, a utilized blade, and burned rocks on a prominent hill top overlooking Spring Creek
to the north and west (Figures 7-38 to 7-39; also see Figure 7-2). A cleared utility corridor
containing an existing subsurface pipeline and an overhead transmission line passes through the
site, though the site extends beyond the utility corridor into the surrounding forest. Vegetation
within the cleared utility corridor consists of dense, short grasses, and the surrounding woodlands
are composed of oak, elm, yaupon, elm, dewberry, and greenbrier. Topography on the site slopes
down strongly in all directions away from the hill top in the approximate center of the site, ranging
in elevation from 112.8 to 119.5 meters (370.0 to 392.0 feet) amsl.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of cultural materials on the modern ground surface and in
subsurface shovel tests, site 41RT610 measures approximately 164.0 meters (538.1 feet) north-

west to southeast by 95.0 meters (311.7 feet) northeast to southwest. The site was investigated
within and a short distance beyond the current project’s linear survey corridor, and the site may
continue farther to the northeast and southwest.
A total of nine shovel tests were excavated on and near the site, six of which were positive
for cultural resources. Subsurface cultural resources were observed at depths ranging from
10.0 to 100.0 centimeters (3.9 to 39.4 inches) below surface, though the majority of the
subsurface artifacts were observed at depths of 30.0 to 50.0 centimeters (11.8 to 19.7 inches)
below surface, suggesting the presence of a buried occupation horizon at the latter depths. A
few artifacts were observed on the modern ground surface, though dense grass cover generally
obscured ground surface visibility.
Observed Cultural Features
No intact cultural features were observed on the modern ground surface or in any of the
shovel tests excavated on site 41RT610, though the presence of relatively abundant burned rocks
on the site suggests that cultural features potentially could be present (or once were present) on
the site.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41RT610 include 25 to 50 tertiary flakes, 30 to
40 secondary flakes, and 20 to 30 burned rocks (Figure 7-40). Some flakes show signs of

utilization, and one utilized blade was observed on the modern ground surface. All debitage was
produced from grayish-brown and yellowish-brown chert.
Summary and Recommendations
Site 41RT610 consists of a moderate-density surface and subsurface scatter of aboriginal
lithic debitage, a utilized blade, and burned rocks on a prominent hill top overlooking Spring Creek
to the north and west. Cultural materials were observed at depths ranging from 10.0 to
100.0 centimeters (3.9 to 39.4 inches) below surface, though the majority of the subsurface
artifacts were observed at depths of 30.0 to 50.0 centimeters (11.8 to 19.7 inches) below surface,
suggesting the presence of a buried occupation horizon at the these depths. No temporally
diagnostic artifacts were observed, and the occupation of site 41RT610 can be dated only to an
undetermined prehistoric timeframe. Prior disturbances from construction of a shared pipeline
and transmission line corridor likely have impacted some of the subsurface deposits within the
utility corridor, though sediments on the site appear to be relatively intact overall. No intact cultural
features were observed, though burned rock is relatively abundant on the site, suggesting that
cultural features may be (or once were) present. Additional significance testing would be required
to firmly establish the NRHP eligibility of the site; as such, site 41RT610 is recommended as being
of undetermined eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP.

8.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

8.1

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The archeological investigations documented in this report were undertaken with three
primary management goals in mind:



Locate all historic and prehistoric archeological resources that occur within the
designated survey area.



Evaluate the significance of these resources regarding their potential for inclusion in
the NRHP and for designation as SALs, as appropriate.



Formulate recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their
NRHP and/or SAL evaluations.

At the survey level of investigation, the principal research objective is to inventory the
cultural resources within the project area and to make preliminary determinations of whether or
not the resources meet one or more of the pre-defined eligibility criteria set forth in the state and/or
federal codes, as appropriate. Usually, management decisions regarding archeological
properties are a function of the potential importance of the sites in addressing defined research
needs, though historic-age sites may also be evaluated in terms of their association with important
historic events and/or personages. Under the NHPA and the Antiquities Code of Texas,
archeological resources are evaluated according to criteria established to determine the
significance of archeological resources for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as SALs,
respectively.
Analyses of the limited data obtained at the survey level are rarely sufficient to contribute
in a meaningful manner to defined research issues. The objective is rather to determine which
archeological sites could be most profitably investigated further in pursuance of regional,
methodological, or theoretical research questions. Therefore, adequate information on site
function, context, and chronological placement from archeological and, if appropriate, historical
perspectives is essential for archeological evaluations. Because research questions vary as a
function of geography and temporal period, determination of the site context and chronological
placement of cultural properties is a particularly important objective during the inventory process.

8.2

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION IN THE NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC
PLACES

Determinations of eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP are based on the criteria presented
in 36 CFR §60.4(a-d). The four criteria of eligibility are applied following the identification of
relevant historical themes and related research questions:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
a. [T]hat are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or,
b. [T]hat are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or,
c.

[T]hat embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual distinction; or,

d. [T]hat have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or
history.

The first step in the evaluation process is to define the significance of the property by
identifying the particular aspect of history or prehistory to be addressed and the reasons why
information on that topic is important. The second step is to define the kinds of evidence or the
data requirements that the property must exhibit to provide significant information. These data
requirements in turn indicate the kind of integrity that the site must possess to be significant. This
concept of integrity relates both to the contextual integrity of such entities as structures, districts,
or archeological deposits and to the applicability of the potential database to pertinent research
questions. Without such integrity, the significance of a resource is very limited.
For an archeological resource to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, it must meet legal
standards of eligibility that are determined by three requirements: (1) properties must possess
significance, (2) the significance must satisfy at least one of the four criteria for eligibility listed
above, and (3) significance should be derived from an understanding of historic context. As
discussed here, historic context refers to the organization of information concerning prehistory
and history according to various periods of development in various times and at various places.
Thus, the significance of a property can best be understood through knowledge of historic
development and the relationship of the resource to other, similar properties within a particular
period of development. Most prehistoric sites are usually only eligible for inclusion in the NRHP
under Criterion D, which considers their potential to contribute data important to an understanding
of prehistory. All four criteria employed for determining NRHP eligibility potentially can be brought
to bear for historic sites.

8.3

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR LISTING AS A STATE ANTIQUITIES LANDMARK

The criteria for determining the eligibility of a prehistoric or historic cultural property for
designation as an SAL are presented in Chapter 191, Subchapter D, Section 191.092 of the
Antiquities Code of Texas, which states that SALs include:
Sites, objects, buildings, artifacts, implements, and locations of historical, archeological,
scientific, or educational interest including those pertaining to prehistoric and historical
American Indians or aboriginal campsites, dwellings, and habitation sites, their artifacts
and implements of culture, as well as archeological sites of every character that are located
in, on, or under the surface of any land belonging to the State of Texas or to any county,
city, or political subdivision of the state are state antiquities landmarks and are eligible for
designation.

For the purposes of assessing the eligibility of a historic property for designation as an
SAL, a historic site, structure, or building has historical interest if the site, structure, or building:
1. [W]as the site of an event that has significance in the history of the United States or
the State of Texas;
2. [W]as significantly associated with the life of a famous person;
3. [W]as significantly associated with an event that symbolizes an important principle or
ideal;
4. [R]epresents a distinctive architectural type and has value as an example of a period,
style, or construction technique; or,
5. [I]s important as part of the heritage of a religious organization, ethic group, or local
society.

The Antiquities Code of Texas establishes the THC as the legal custodian of all cultural
resources, historic and prehistoric, within the public domain of the State of Texas. Under Part II
of Title 13 of the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26), the THC may designate a historic
building, structure, cultural landscape, or non-archeological site, object, or district as an SAL if it
meets at least on one of following criteria:
A. [T]he property is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to
the broad patterns of our history, including importance to a particular cultural or ethnic
group;
B. [T]he property is associated with the lives of persons significant in our past;
C. [T]he property embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, represents the work of a master, possesses high artistic values, or
represents a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack
individual distinction;
D. [T]he property has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in Texas
culture or history.

H146-170124

207

Chapter 8.0: Summary and Recommendations

Furthermore, the THC may designate an archeological site as an SAL if the site meets
one or more of the following criteria:
1. [T]he site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory
and/or history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
2. [T]he site’s archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and
intact, thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
3. [T]he site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or
history;
4. [T]he study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of
preservation, thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge; or,
5. [T]he high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur,
and official landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or
alternatively further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and
relic collecting when the site cannot be protected.

8.4

SUMMARY OF INVENTORY RESULTS

A total of 16 archeological sites and one historic-age engineering feature, a mid-20thcentury bridge eponymously designated as the Little Wickson Creek Tributary Bridge (which was
not recorded as an archeological site), were documented as a result of the cultural resources
survey of Magellan’s proposed East Houston to Hearne Pipeline ROW in Grimes, Brazos, and
Robertson counties (Table 8-1). Of the total of 17 cultural resources (16 archeological sites plus
the historic-age bridge), 11 resources are located in Grimes County, four resources are located
in Brazos County, and two resources are located in Robertson County. Four of the
16 archeological sites (41GM28, 41GM118, 41GM264, and 41RT129) are previously recorded
sites that were revisited during the current survey, and the remaining 12 archeological sites
(41GM479-486, 41BZ180-182, and 41RT610) plus the Little Wickson Creek Tributary Bridge are
newly recorded cultural resources discovered during the current survey. Aboriginal cultural
components consisting of surface and/or subsurface scatters of lithic and/or ceramic artifacts
were recorded on 12 of the archeological sites, including three sites with Early Ceramic to Late
Prehistoric period components and nine sites with undetermined prehistoric components.
Historic-age components dating from the late 19th to late 20th centuries were observed on seven
of the archeological sites, and the Little Wickson Creek Tributary Bridge dates to the mid-20th
century. Three of the archeological sites are multiple-component sites containing both aboriginal
and historic-age cultural components.
A total of 12 cultural resources, including 11 of the 16 archeological sites and the historicage bridge (41GM28, 41GM118, 41GM264, 41GM481, 41GM482, 41GM484, 41GM485,
41GM486, 41BZ181, 41BZ182, 41RT129, and the Little Wickson Creek Tributary Bridge), fall
within portions of the proposed ROW that are currently considered to be subject to state and/or
federal regulatory jurisdiction. Eleven of these 12 cultural resources (41GM28, 41GM264,
41GM481, 41GM482, 41GM484, 41GM485, 41GM486, 41BZ181, 41BZ182, 41RT129, and the
Little Wickson Creek Tributary Bridge) fall within jurisdictional buffers surrounding WOUSs that

are subject to USACE permitting; as such, these 11 resources fall under the jurisdiction of
Section 106 of the NHPA. Three of these 12 cultural resources (41GM118, 41GM481, and
41GM482) are located on property owned and operated by the TMPA; as such, these three sites
fall under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of Texas.
Based on the results of Horizon’s investigations, 10 of the 16 archeological sites
(41GM479, 41GM480, 41GM482, 41GM483, 41GM484, 41GM485, 41GM486, 41BZ180,
41BZ182, and 41RT129) and the Little Wickson Creek Tributary Bridge are recommended either
as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP as a whole or as non-contributing to the overall eligibility
of a larger site for inclusion in the NRHP (i.e., not eligible within the investigated ROW). Site
41GM482 is further recommended as not eligible for designation as an SAL. No further work is
warranted within the proposed ROW on these sites regardless of construction method.
The remaining six archeological sites (41GM28, 41GM118, 41GM264, 41GM481,
41BZ181, and 41RT610) are recommended to be of undetermined eligibility for inclusion in the
NRHP, and sites 41GM118 and 41GM481 are further recommended to be of undetermined
eligibility for designation as SALs. Five of these six sites (41GM28, 41GM118, 41GM264,
41GM481, and 41BZ181) fall within portions of the proposed ROW currently considered to be
subject to federal and/or state regulatory jurisdiction. Four of these five sites (41GM28, 41GM264,
41GM481, and 41BZ181) are located within jurisdictional survey buffers surrounding WOUSs
potentially subject to permitting by the USACE, and sites 41GM118 and 41GM481 are located on
TMPA property and therefore fall under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of Texas.
Site 41GM118 was originally located within the proposed ROW within a USACE
jurisdictional area; however, the proposed ROW has been rerouted at this location, and site
41GM118 no longer falls within the APE of the proposed undertaking. Site 41BZ181 is not located
directly within the proposed pipeline centerline or permanent workspace, but rather just barely
encroaches within an area of temporary workspace. Magellan proposes to avoid impacts to site

Cultural Resources Assessment of USACE Jurisdictional Areas and TMPA Property on the Proposed

41BZ181 by establishing a 15.2-meter (50.0-foot) avoidance buffer surrounding the site
boundaries within which no construction-related activities would occur. Magellan proposes to
avoid impacts to the remaining three sites of undetermined eligibility—41GM28, 41GM264, and
41GM481—by installing the pipeline underneath the documented site locations via horizontal
directional drill (HDD) or conventional bore and avoiding any other surficial ground-disturbing
impacts within the boundaries of these sites. As such, it is Horizon’s recommendation that no
additional cultural resources investigations are warranted on these five sites in connection with
the proposed undertaking. In the event that ground disturbances on the sites are unavoidable,
additional significance testing would be needed to fully determine the eligibility of the sites for
inclusion in the NRHP and/or for designation as SALs, as appropriate.
The remaining archeological site recommended as being of undetermined eligibility for
inclusion in the NRHP, 41RT610, does not fall within a portion of the proposed ROW currently
considered to be subject to regulatory jurisdiction; as such, no further work is warranted on this
site in connection with the proposed undertaking regardless of construction method.

8.5

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
significant cultural resources would be adversely affected by the proposed undertaking. In
accordance with 36 CFR) 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good-faith effort to identify
historic properties within the APE. As currently designed, it is recommended that the proposed
project would have no effect on historic properties in accordance with 36 CFR 60.4 and 13 TAC
26, and no further cultural resources investigations are recommended in connection with the
proposed undertaking. However, it should be noted that human burials, both historic-age and
prehistoric, are protected under the Texas Health and Safety Code. In the event that any human
remains or burial objects are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or
ongoing maintenance in the project area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work should
cease immediately at the location of the inadvertent discovery until a qualified archaeologist can
assess the find, and the THC should be notified of the discovery.
