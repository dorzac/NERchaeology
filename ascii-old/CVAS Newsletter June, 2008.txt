Bill Yeates to Present Program on
Rock Art Photography

Fort Chadbourne Update
Larry Riemenschneider

Bill Yeates will present the program he
gave to the Southwest Federation of Archeological Societies on techniques that he has developed to enhance photos of rock art, using
Adobe Photoshop.
Researchers and
amateurs alike can
use these techniques to increase
the clarity, contrast
and color, which at
times will produce
spectacular results.
Bill
will
also review a free
experimental program, DSTRETCH, which can bring out details
that are no longer visible in rock art..
Bill is a retired geophysicist, a photographer, pilot, and a past president of CVAS. He
will be presenting this program at the Center of
Big Bend Studies annual meeting at Sul Ross
State University at Alpine this November.

The manuscript on the archeological investigations of the Officers' Quarters (Ranch Headquarters) is now complete and going to press. Thanks again to
all of you who participated. As the
building is now being completed you can
be proud that you were a part of the rebuilding project that future generations
can enjoy.
The Butterfield Stage Station project is now complete. Excavations and
lab work were completed on May
17. Work is in progress on the manuscript and hopefully it will be finished by
the 150 anniversary of the Butterfield
Overland Mail. Thanks again for all the
many hours of volunteer work devoted to
this project. It is amazing how much
work was done in a little over a month.
Archeology Fair Update
Be sure to mark your calendars for

Archaeological Legacy Institute
Friends and colleagues: The remarkable cultural heritage of China, one of the world’s
great and most ancient civilizations, is manifest in numerous magnificent buildings and
architectural complexes, many of which are
threatened by modern development or are in
decay. The modern response to these threats
provides some reason for hope, as shown in
Saving Asia’s Treasures: Foguang Temple,
Shanxi, China, the latest video feature on our
nonprofit streaming-media Web site, The Archaeology
Channel
(http://
www.archaeologychannel.org).
The 1,200-year old Foguang Temple in
Shanxi Province, China, is one the most important remaining wooden architectural jewels of Chinese civilization. Built during the
Tang Dynasty, the temple is a tribute to the
peak of Buddhist art and architecture from
the 9th century AD. Without regular maintenance and conservation by successive Chinese dynasties, the structure has fallen into
dangerous state of disrepair. Global Heritage
Fund (GHF) of Palo Alto, California, will
provide funding and expertise for the investigation, planning and scientific conservation
of the site.
This and other programs are available on
TAC for your use and enjoyment. We urge
you to support this public service by participating in our Membership (http://

and
Underwriting

programs. Only with your help can we continue and enhance our nonprofit publiceducation and visitor-supported programming. We also welcome new content partners
as we reach out to the world community.

This is the day set aside for the archeology
fair. It's just five months away, but you
know how time flies. I will be contacting
you in the future about your exhibits,
demonstrations and activities.

Dear CVAS Members:
I would like to thank you for the
thoughtful and generous donation of
$200.00 to Fort Concho that was given to
assist us in our building and utility costs for
your meetings. We very much appreciate
the support.
The fort and CVAS have a very long
and mutually supportive history. We have
benefited from the expertise of the CVAS
in numerous archeological digs, public programs, and festivals. Indeed, the annual
fall fair is one of our more popular and better family events of the year.
I look forward to many more years
of activity with the CVAS. You have
played a major role in Fort Concho's
growth and development these many years,
and I trust that we all will be working with
one another for many years to come. With
all best wishes.
Sincerely,
Bob Bluthardt
Director

What is a Burin?
By Tom Ashmore
While looking around Dove Creek recently I found what appeared to me to be a scraper
in very good condition. It is bifaced and the edges are sharp all the way around. After doing a
little research, though, I found that it is more likely something I had never heard of before – a
burin. If you look up burin you will find the common description as a sharp edged stone tool
used for graving in wood or bone. There is not much discussion on more specific uses. Burins
are found all over the world. A good example of the one I found came from the Artifacts of
Kansas website (http://ksartifacts.info) which is where I got the comparison picture for this article.
I’ve developed a theory that the burin was probably used for making the V shape in the
atatl, arrow and knife foreshafts for attaching the stone points and knives. As an experiment I
made an atlatl foreshaft from chert flakes (also found at the creek) and the burin. Now I know
why the Indians prized their arrow and atlatl shafts more than the points. Making a foreshaft
and cutting a V into it has got to be the hardest work of all the pieces making up a dart or arrow. You must use hard wood (I used cedar) and you cannot afford to split the wood. So carving the V shape is a necessity. Because you must put so much pressure on a very small area a
knife with a handle would not work well. This is a job that must be done by hand using fairly
small and sharp stones. The burin was probably used at the end of the process. Sharp chert
flakes are better at starting the process and using the burin with the serrated edge is good for
completing the process.
