The Tuck Carpenter Site
And Its Relation to Other Sites
Within the Titus Focus
ROBERT L.

TURNER, JR.

ABSTRACT
The Tuck Carpenter Site (41 CP 5) was excavated on weekends
between May, 1963, and October, 1967 by the author and R.W.
Welsh. It was located on the west side of Dry Creek, approximately
three miles east of Pittsburg in Camp County, Texas. The site was a
Titus Focus cemetery which contained 44 graves. Two graves contained two individuals each; 40 graves contained only one person.
The remaining two graves contained no traces of bone. However,
from the quantity and location of the burial offerings, they probably
contained only one person. The skeletal material ranged from nearcomplete preservation to a complete absence in the graves. Usually,
the skull and major leg bones were present, and pelvic fragments
and arm bones appeared less frequently.
An analysis of the artifacts from the graves indicates that the
graves were not all placed by the same people, but that early and
late components were present.
The relationship of the Carpenter site graves to other Titus
Focus sites and cemeteries is discussed.

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
Camp County in Northeast Texas is within the Coastal Plain.
This region is crossed by several sizable creeks which eventually
empty into Caddo Lake and then the Red River near Shreveport,
Louisiana.
Most of Camp County is traversed by small streams or
branches, which over the years have developed bottomlands or

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

flood plains bordered by upland or terraces 25 to 50 feet higher.
The extreme eastern part of the county is hilly with occasional outcroppings of iron ore.
Camp County is in the area usually referred to as the Piney
Woods of East Texas. The entire county is wooded except where
land has been cleared for agricultural purposes. The predominant
tree is the pine, and many varieties of oak and gum are present.
Trees producing nuts are the oak, chincapin, hickory, pecan, and
black walnut. Wild plum, muscadine, persimmon, and mayhaws
may be found, and in the spring dewberries and blackberries grow
in abundance.
The people of the Titus Focus were part of the Fulton Aspect of
the Neo-American period and would mainly be placed in the Caddo
IV time period (Davis 1970), the last prehistoric period. They were
an agricultural people and lived in permanent villages. These villages, as far as is known, were located on the terraces above the
flood plains.
It is the author’s observation that small midden areas are
located on the terrace along the streams. Each midden may
represent one or two houses, and the entire group of middens probably composes the village. This observation applies to the environs
of the Carpenter Site as well as others. Fig. 1 shows the relation of
several middens to the Carpenter cemetery.
The cemetery is located on a projection or spur which
protrudes into the flood plain of Dry Creek The elevation of the
cemetery is 300 feet above mean sea level which is between that of
the flood plain and the upland. The sandy soil rests upon a red clay
base at depths of one to eight feet.
During periods of regular rainfall, which excludes the summer
months and early fall, the ground is soft and may easily be dug.
This characteristic of the soil probably was one reason why it was
selected as a cemetery by these people.
The region, formerly occupied by the people now defined as
Titus Focus, has as its axis Cypress Creek which lies between the
Sulphur and Sabine Rivers. Fig. 2 is a map of this region which
locates known Titus Focus and other sites that have been excavated. A few excavated sites are located on the major creeks,
both to the north and south of Cypress as indicated.
The Titus Focus was defined by Suhm, et al. (1954: 189-195)
using information obtained from excavations of cemeteries
during the 1930’s.

During the 1930’s, field parties under the direction of J. E.
Pearce of the University of Texas excavated many cemeteries in
Northeast Texas. Field foremen who did the actual work were
A. T. Jackson, Walter R. Coldschmidt, Burleigh B. Cardner, and
A. M. Woolsey (Davis 1970: 30-32). Among those excavated were
the following Titus Focus cemeteries as noted in Fig. 2: the
Russell, Caldwell, A. P. Williams, W. A. Ford, H. R. Taylor, Cash,
Riley, Cason, Joe Justiss, Atkinson, Reese, Culpepper, Candy, and
Galt Sites. The Starrett cemetery was represented by purchased
collection of artifacts and was not excavated by the field parties. All these cemeteries were used by Suhm, et al. (1954) to
define the Titus Focus traits.
Suhm, et al. (1954) characterized the people of Titus Focus
as producers of large quantities of pottery which they placed in
the graves. Included in some of the graves were groups of arrow
points primarily of the Talco type. Bassett and Maud points were

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

TUCK CARPENTER SITE

minor types in some areas. The most common vessel types that
serve as markers for this Focus are Ripley Engraved, Harleton
Applique, Taylor Engraved, Wilder Engraved, and Bailey
Engraved.
Subsequent to the Handbook publication, (Suhm, et al. 1954)
additional excavations of Titus Focus and other sites in the
Cypress Creek basin were conducted by professional archeologists. The specific area was in the Ferrell’s Bridge Reservoir
or Lake O’ the Pines which was then under construction.
The surveys and excavations which were carried out during
the late 1950’s were under the auspices of the River Basin
Surveys office located in Austin. This office was initially under
the Smithsonian Institution and later under the National Park
Service. Titus-related sites that were excavated are: The Dalton
Site (Davis and Gipson 1960), the Harroun Site (Jelks and Tunnell
1959), the Whelan Site (Davis 1958), and the McKinney Site
(Davis and Golden 1960). In addition to these, the Roberts Site in
Camp County was surveyed, and very brief excavations by Jelks
and Tunne!l were conducted. No formal report was submitted on
the Roberts Site. The locations of these sites are also noted in
Fig. 2.
Based on the findings at four of these sites (those above
except McKinney), E. Mort Davis (Davis 1970: 47-50; also Davis
1958) defined the Whelan Complex which he equates in time
with the Bossier Focus of the Fulton Aspect of the Caddo III time
period. Characteristics of the Whelan Complex which differ from
Titus Focus, as previously defined, are: (1) mounds built over the
burned remains of circular structures which show no signs of
having been lived in; (2) the presence of significant quantities of
Pease Brushed Incised sherds (a type characteristic of Bossier
Focus and absent in Titus as previously defined). Davis concluded that the Whelan Complex was ancestral to the Titus
Focus. Radiocarbon dates from Whelan Complex sites indicate a
principal overlap of 1450 A.D. to 1550 A.D. or possibly 1650 A.D.
(Davis 1970: 48).
Of the five Caddo Periods, Caddo I and II encompass the
Gibson Aspect, and III through V encompass the Fulton. The five
periods were first proposed by Webb (in Davis 1961) to better
differentiate the actual periods in the Caddoan sequence. This
period arrangement was again introduced by E. M. Davis at the
Eleventh Caddoan Conference in 1968.

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

It is emphasized that the various Caddo periods and the
Gibson and Fulton foci do not necessarily begin and end with the
turns of the centuries. As an example, recent samples from the
Davis Site (reported by Story at the Thirteenth Caddoan Conference) provided radiocarbon dates which extended from the
eighth into the thirteenth centuries.
During the late 1950’s, the same time period that Davis,
Jelks, Tunnell, Golden, and Gipson were working in the Lake O’
the Pines reservoir, several Titus Focus cemeteries were excavated, or partially excavated, by the late Ed German of Lone
Star, Ralph Nicholas of Daingerfield, and the author, formerly of
Pittsburg. These sites were: B. J. Horton, Guest, Chasteen, Alex
Justiss, Keith, and Harold Williams, which are also shown in Fig.
2. The Keeling Site was excavated by Mr. and Mrs. Roy Keeling
of Upshur County. The Rumsey Site is represented only by a
collection of artifacts, as is the Ellison Lake (Lone Star Lake)
Site. The Johns Site was excavated primarily by Tommy Johns
(formerly of Pittsburg, Texas) with the assistance of the author.
Although many Titus Focus cemeteries have been excavated,
only one report with general distribution has been published
about this specific type of site in northeast Texas (Scurlock,
1962: 285-316). As there is undoubtedly an end to these
cemeteries, it is the intent of the author that a major cemetery of
the Titus Focus people be reported. This paper is written to
fulfill that purpose.

BURIAL ARRANGEMENT
Fig. 3 is a map of the cemetery which shows the relation of
the graves with each other. The cemetery was arranged in
rather loose north-south rows. No pattern in the location of male
or female graves is apparent. That is, they seem to be intermingled.
Some of the graves shown in Fig. 3 have the skeleton and
grave offerings sketched in, while other graves are shown in
outline form only. This does not indicate any particular differences between graves. The areas outlined with dashed lines in
the figure represent excavations by an unknown person or
persons. The two holes just south of Grave 42 may represent
graves. Whether graves were actually found is not known. The

TUCK CARPENTER SITE

author does not believe the excavations shown in the top, righthand side of the figure uncovered any burials.
The small rectangle marked "28" in Fig. 3 does not
represent a grave, but the location of a single vessel. A concentration of sherds was found at a depth of 19 inches from the
surface. The sherds formed about three quarters of a nine-inch
diameter compound bowl. About a foot to the east of the pot was
one flint flake, a small fragment of burned bone, and several
small, ferruginous sandstone rocks. The broken pot shows use as
a cooking vesse!, which is unusual for this form of pot. The
burned bone fragment, flake, and sandstone rocks may not
represent purposely placed objects, but accidental groupings of
objects which occurred when the hole was filled. The
significance of the burial of this broken and incomplete vessel is
unknown. Fig. 4 and 5 are photographs of the site and of
selected graves.
Figs. 6-9 are examples of drawings made of each grave. At
the top of each figure is a plan view, or view looking down into
the burial. At the bottom of each figure is a side view, which
shows the depth from the present ground surface to the skeleton
and each artifact. The scale which shows depth is applicable to
all distances and dimensions in both the plan and side views of
each figure.
Various artistic liberties have been taken to provide a
clearer picture for the reader. First, the outline of the grave (in
both views) is shown outside and below the artifacts and
skeleton. Actually, the skeleton and many of the artifacts were
resting on the floor of the grave. Also, in the plan view, vessels
on the sides and ends of the grave were usua!ly against the
walls. Generally, the grave was no longer than necessary to
accommodate the skeleton and artifacts shown.
Numbers are assigned to each pot as seen in the plan view.
Letters are assigned to other types of artifacts, groups of artifacts, or special features.
The position of each vessel or artifact in the plan view
shown in Figs. 6-9 should be correct to within an inch or so. Side
view sketches are not as precise. To establish the relative
positions between the artifacts and the skeleton in each grave,
triangulation was employed. Two stakes were placed at the
surface beside the grave in an east-west line by compass
heading and at a measured distance apart, usually five feet.

Using a steel tape and plumb line, the horizontal distance of
each artifact from each stake was measured and recorded. The
field notes for each grave included a sketch that noted the
position on each artifact where the measurements were made,
i.e., center of base, junction of neck and body, etc. In addition,
the depth from the surface to the uppermost portion of each
artifact was recorded. The inclination of each vessel with
respect to the vertical and its direction of tilt were estimated,
sketched, and recorded. Based on the field sketch, notes,
measurements, and the artifacts after reconstruction, the grave
drawings were completed.
The sketches show the vessels as unbroken, except for
instances when incomplete vessels were placed in the graves.
Actually, about 55% of the vessels were broken to some degree.
This occurred most often when the grave floor was on, or into,
the clay. The clay provided no cushion, but rather a fixed
platform against which the vessels were crushed by the grave
fill. When sand extended below the grave floor, vessel breakage
was minimal. It is the author’s opinion, based on the above
observation, that the broken vessels were a result of crushing
and not of deliberate breaking or "killing."
The direction of each skeleton with respect to west is indicated beside the plan view of each grave drawing. The cardinal points, north and west, are true and not magnetic compass
headings.
In each grave the approximate quantity of skeletal material
that was found is shown in the drawing. The amount varied from
none, as in Grave 1, to almost complete preservation, as in Grave
18.

EARLY AND LATE COMPONENT GRAVES
An analysis of the artifacts from the cemetery indicates the
graves were placed at two different time periods. Thirty-five of
the graves are assigned to the early component or period, nine to
the latter. The late component graves are numbered 1, 3, 10, 19,
31, 32, 33, 34 and 36.
The major difference between the graves of the two components, which will be apparent to the reader after inspection of
the grave drawings, is the presence in the late component graves
of a distinctive decorative motif on many of the Ripley Engraved

lO

carinated bowls. This motif, which is widespread in the Titus
Focus, is characterized by small pendant triangles attached just
below the lip and similarly sized upright triangles at the
shoulder of the bowl. Four panels encircle the rim. Fig. 12 (a-c}
depicts typical bowls of this variety.
In addition to the vessels with the pendant triangle motif,
seven of the nine graves contained Talco arrow points. Only two
of the 35 graves assigned to the early component contained these
points. The two late component graves which did not contain
Talco points contained Maud points. Thus, all late component
graves had triangular arrow points as offerings.
A third distinguishing feature of the late component graves
is their location within the cemetery. All were on the outer
fringes which indicates their later arrival on the scene.
Five additional graves contained triangular arrow points but
did not include bowls with the pendant triangle motif. Graves 20
and 25 contained Talco points and graves 2, 23, and 44 Maud
specimens. Like the late component graves four of these five
were located on the outer edges of the cemetery. The one exception was number 23 which had one other grave between it
and the outside edge.
These five graves show a closer relationship to the late
component graves than do the others at the site. They are
related through the triangular point forms and through their
peripheral position within the cemetery.
The arrow points, from the interior graves which contained
points, were of the stemmed varieties, Bassett and Perdiz. These
graves and those among them which did not contain points were
the oldest graves at the site. Bassett and a very few Perdiz
points were also in some of the late component graves along with
the triangular point types.
In many of the early component graves, a major percent of
carinated bowls featured a triangular motif. In this design one to
three vertical lines extend from the shoulder to the lip at the end
of each design unit. A diagonal line connects one group of
vertical lines to the next. The triangular space above and below
the diagonal is filled with a smaller triangle that usually contains a semicircle or other simple shape set off by engraved
bands or excised areas. This design repeats four to eight times
around the rim. Fig. 12 (h, k, and m) pictures this motif. This, too,

TUCK CARPENTER SITE

11

may be classified as Ripley Engraved, but a motif that preceded
the pendant triangle in time.
Eight of the nine late component graves contained bottles of
Wilder Engraved. The ninth, Grave 3, contained a small bottle
with a simple untyped design. None of the late graves contained
the classic Ripley Engraved bottles of the first component. It
appears that at this site, the Wilder Engraved bottle design
survived from the earlier component to the late component, but
the classic Ripley Engraved bottle design did not.

CEMETERY LOCATION
The graves were located in a midden established by the
earlier component people, or at the same time the area was
occupied by them. This conclusion is based on the fact that
debris, typical of a midden area, was found both on the surface
and in the grave fill.
Artifacts from both locations included: bottle sherds of
Ripley, Wilder, and unidentified types; engraved, incised,
brushed, appliqued, red slip, plain, and base fragments from
other vessel types. In addition, flakes and chips, a few bone fragments, and small pieces of petrified wood were both in the grave
fill and on the surface. Two celt fragments were found in the
fills. Several ferruginous sandstone fragments, broken from
larger pieces such as metates or other tools, were also in the
grave fills. However, none were found on the surface.
Ripley Engraved bottle sherds from the same bottle were
found in the fill of Graves 12 and 13. No sherds from either the
surface or grave fills were of the pendant triangle type which is
a marker type of the late component graves.
In modern times the cemetery site had been cultivated
although at the time of excavation, the land was in pasture. As a
consequence, the surface had been disturbed by the deep
plowing. Therefore, no fire pits or other features were found.
In many cases the grave fill was difficult to distinguish from
the undisturbed sandy soil. If the grave was dug into the clay,
red clay fragments would be mixed with the sand of the fill
which, of course, helped in defining the grave shape. Even when
clay was mixed, it was usually much more evident in the lower
part of the grave. This would indicate that the last dirt removed

12

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

when the grave was originally dug was the first returned when
it was filled.
In graves which had not penetrated the clay, small flecks of
charcoal, along with the midden debris, were the only indications of a grave. The charcoal flecks most likely came from
the midden surface, as did the sherds, and became mixed with
the dirt when the grave was filled.

GRAVE DESCRIPTIONS
In the descriptions of the graves and their contents that
follow, the number that appears beside each vessel is its
identifying number that corresponds to the number in that
particular grave’s plan view. Letters are assigned to other types
of artifacts, groups of artifacts, and special features. They
correspond, in a like manner, to those objects lettered in the
same plan view.

Four beamers of deer cannon bone
Gouge of ferruginous sandstone
Roughly noded 6 oz. unworked fragment of iron ore
placed between teeth of skull (Fig. 32)

Remarks:
Noteworthy features of this grave are: the placement of the rock
between the teeth, the presence of the beamers, and the gouge in
association with the beamers.
Beamers have been reported from the Clark Site near Waco by
Watt (1965), the Pecan Springs Site near Ennis by Sorrow (1966),
and from the Sanders Site on Red River by Krieger (1946). These
locations are closer to the Carpenter Site than any other sites
where beamers have been reported.
The beamers and gouge are pictured in Fig. 10.

C, 25 arrow points: 10 Talco with eared base; one Maud

untyped point of grey flint. Four stemmed points near
Vessel 11 did not have a consistent orientation, nor did
the eight points by the right knee. One point by the right
ankle was disturbed, and its direction was not noted.
However, the remaining points were oriented as shown,
indicating former attachment to arrow shafts. A single
point was located in the pelvic area.
Remarks:
The cache at ’A’ included three items which indicated this cache
may include an arrow point-making kit. These items are the deer
ulna fragments, the flakes, and the petrified wood piece.
Artifacts from a grave cache at the Alex lustiss Site which probably included such a kit were the following:
’/2 lb. hematite stone, scraped all over, apparently to manufacture red paint;
10 deer ulnae;
15 pieces petrified wood, 1-4 in. long;
10-20 flakes;
2 dart points (nondesciript, may represent an additional flint
supply);
6 small Talco points;
2-8" long bones, ’/2" in diameter (probably deer);
5/8" length of tooth enamel (beaver?).
Artifacts pictured in Fundaburk and Foreman (1957: P1. 66) and

described as a Caddo flint working kit contained:
2 arrow points;
9 bone points;
16 antler tines;
10 ulnae;
2 bone pins;
1 twisted bone;
1 beaver tooth;
1 novaculite chip;
3 jasper pebbles.
Grave 19 was that of an important person as indicated by its
depth and the quantity of grave offerings. It was probably that of a
male. The large blade of the cache is an unusual artifact for a
Titus Focus grave. The only similar artifacts known to the author
from a Titus Focus cemetery were from the Gait Site. Grave 2 of
the Gait cemetery yielded two large ceremonial blades, both in
excess of 14" in length. The blade from Grave 19 is off-white in
color, resulting from a uniform layer of patination. A small flake
shows a grey color beneath its outer layer. The darker color probably represents the original coloration of the flint.

Remarks:
This grave is particularly unusual because it was a double
burial; that is, two individuals were buried simultaneously in the
same grave. The individual to the north was probably male and the
other, female. Grave 23 was also a double burial, Of 391 Titus
Focus graves from 32 different sites, the only other double burial
was Grave X-8 at the Ford Site.
Of the 17 vessels in Grave 21, four seemed to be associated with
the skeleton to the north and the remaining 13 with the one to the
south. All arrow points were associated with the northern
skeleton.
Vessel g3 contained a number of bone fragments about the size
of those that would come from a deer though they are not
positively identified as such. In order to get the drawing on the
page, both Vessels #1 and #17 were moved inward nine inches.
True distance across the grave to encompass these vessels would
be about 101/2 feet. Vessel #15 was inside vessel #2 as shown. The
grave floor was dug into the clay about 6 inches.

Remarks:
This grave was the second doable burial at the Carpenter Site.
The grave was dug very slightly into the clay. Extremely few bone
pieces remained. The skulls were crushed against the clay floor.
Arrow points were associated with both skeletons. Point groups D,
E, and G were aligned as if they had formerly been attached to
arrow shafts. Group F was not.
Vessel 9 is quite similar to bottles described by Skinner, et al.
(1969; 42 and 44) which were found in the shaft and multiple
burials at the Sam Kaufman Site (McCurtain Focus component) in
Red River County. Six of the seven bottles described were polished
red-slipped vessels with the marks of the polishing stone still
remaining. One vessel was not red-slipped. Five of the vessels were
decorated at the base of the neck with a distinctive four point
diamond applique. The Kaufman bottles were quite large. The
mean diameter and height were 27 and 33 cm., respectively. Their
paste contained shell temper and a gray core. Vessel 9 is not as
large as the Kaufman vessels nor does it contain shell temper. It
does have the gray core, smoothing-stone marks, a red slip, and a
diamond applique about the neck. The Carpenter vessel does have
a slight shoulder where the neck intersects the body that is not on
the Kaufman bottles. The applique found on both the Kaufman and
Carpenter bottles is a raised, smooth area above the body contour.
The Kaufman bottle type described above, as well as a deep
carinated bowl type with red slip, incurring rim, and slightly
scalloped lip were not given a type name in the Kaufman report.
Skinner has since designated this type as Avery Red. Vessel 9 of
Grave 23 is identified as this type.
The arrow points from this grave are pictured in Fig. 17.

D, Cache--A small jar, Vessel 3, contained green pigment
and was resting on tan potter’s clay beside lumps of
kaolin. Along with the clay was a piece of petrified
wood, a mussel valve, and a ferruginous sandstone
smoothing stone, polished on the convex portion. One
human tooth was close to Vessel 3. The human mandible
fragment was close by at A. Two extremely worn molars
were in the mandible. Whether the mandible, skull, and
pelvic fragments were accidental and mixed with the fill
dirt or purposely placed is impossible to ascertain. If an
earlier grave was disturbed when this one was dug, then
a few bones located between the skull and pelvis
probably would have been present in the fill dirt. Also,
the close grouping of the skull and pelvic fragment tend
to point to a placement, rather than to accident.
E, Deer mandible inside Vessel 1 near base;
F, Conch columella bead found in dirt stuck to skull after
removal from grave.
Remarks:
The effigy vessel, Fig. 29, is a unique form at the Carpenter Site
and in other Titus Focus sites as well. The vessel is hollow within
the head region; the wall thickness is no greater there than in the
bowl proper. Two suspension holes are on opposite sides of the
opening. Engraving consists of a single line around the opening,
three horizontally oriented, crosshatched diamonds on each side,
and hook elements similar to that of Wilder Engraved on the upper
surface of the tail.
The only similar vessel to this, known to the author, is pictured
in the Handbook of Texas Archeology (Subm, et el. 1954: 279). The
vessel described seems to represent a frog. Similarities between
the two vessels are the hollow head, two nodes which may
represent eyes, crosshatching of design elements (though the
elements are different), suspension holes similarly placed, and over
all similarity of form. The vessel pictured in the Handbook has the
tail missing; but from the break, it can be determined that it also
had a very broad tail. The Handbook vessel was found in Red
River County and was described as belonging to either the
Texarkana or McCurtain Focus.
Vessel 14 probably represents a human head in very abstract
form. The nose has nostrils clearly indicated. A small engraved
line in the expected position probably represents the mouth. No
eyes are apparent other than the two nodes.
Because of the similarity of the vessels, it is probable that Vessel
14 is a trade piece from McCurtain or Texarkana Focus people.

Remarks:
This grave was dug into the clay an average depth of about 18
inches. Because of the clay floor, most vessels were badly crushed.
The burned area beneath the upper body probably was the result
of a fire built on the grave floor prior to the body placement.
The cache at position "A" was beside the grave, not in the fill.
This may have been an additional offering or may have had no
relation to the grave at all. There were no similar caches or tools
associated with the other graves at the Carpenter Site.

Remarks:
This grave was completely in sand. Vessel 6 resembles a bottle

The grave floor was slanted downward approximately parallel
to the surface. The head was the lowest skeletal part. Vessels 3, 4,
and 5 were at higher elevations than the skeleton. This might mean
they were placed in the grave after filling had started. Or, it could
have represented their placement on a shelf in the side of the
grave which collapsed inward as settling occurred.

Remarks:
This grave was against a sand-clay layer but into it slightly at
the foot of the grave. Four teeth from the skull were spread over
six inches, This probably resulted from a normal disintegration
and collapsing of the facial structure. The most unusual feature of
Grave 33 is the stemmed vessel, Vessel 9, which will be discussed
in more detail in a later section.

B. Sandstone earspool with copper plate, (Fig. 21)
Remarks:
The grave floor was in the clay one or two inches. An extremely
unusual feature of this grave was the position of the two Talco
points at the skull, One is resting at about the position of the right
eye, and the other appears to be protruding, point first, from the
left side of the skull. On the side of the cranium opposite the
protruding point is a hole which could have been caused by the
penetration of an arrow. However, since the bone had disintegrated at both point locations, there is no absolute evidence that
this actually occurred.
The two points are at a higher elevation than the skull. Both
were pointing downward at an angle, as was the point near the
left knee. The over all impression was that after the body was
placed in the grave, arrows were shot at or near it. If such were
the case, the two points would probably have been shot after the

Remarks:
This grave was unusual because of the depression in the grave
floor in which the legs and three vessels were located. This might
have resulted when those digging the grave decided they had gone
too deep, so did not dig as deeply on the other end. On the other
hand, there might have been some unknown significance to the
arrangement.
The wooden ear ornaments are extremely unusual, No other
wooden artifacts were found in any of the Carpenter Site graves.
And, this is the only occurrence of artifacts of this type in the
Titus Focus so far as the author knows.

Remarks:
Several vessels in this grave are different in style and
decorative technique from most others at the site. For example,
compound Vessels 1, 2, and 10 are not turned as radically at the
shoulder as most other vessels of this type. The design on Vessel 1
features crosshatching and ladder-like elements in semicircular
form, which are similar to Avery Engraved. The triangular motif
on Vessels 2 and 10 are similar in concept to others at the site.
This may simply represent one potter’s slight deviation from the
norm.
Vessels 2 and 11 were higher than the grave floor. These vessels
may have been on a platform or shelf at the end of the grave.
However, no positive variation in the soil composition was
determined. The alternative, of course, would he that these were
placed in the grave after filling had started.
The only skeletal remains were teeth fragments.

Remarks:

except for a slight trace at the ankle position. The grave was
completely in sand.

THE GRAVE DIRECTIONS
All burials at this site in which skeletal material was found
indicated that the person was buried in an extended supine
position, usually with arms parallel to the sides. Sometimes the
elbows were bent, or the leg bones were somewhat askew. In all
cases the head was to the east, and the feet pointed westerly.
An inspection of the burial drawings will show this arrangement.
It occurred to the excavators that as the graves in this site
were all with feet pointing westward, but not exactly so, that
perhaps the position of the sun at sunset was the guide used in
fixing direction. To explore this possibility the direction at which
the sun sets at this site (33° N latitude) during the year was
calculated. The results of this calculation show that on the first
day of summer the sun would set at approximately 281/3° north
of due west and that on the first day of winter it would set at
281A° south of due west. At the fall and spring equinox the sun

5O

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

would set due west. The variation of direction with time at
which it sets, between these dates, will be that of a sine curve.
This variation with the time of year is shown in Fig. 13. Also
shown on this chart are the mean first and last calendar dates
of freezing and subfreezing weather in this area of Texas. The
numbered circles in this figure represent the number assigned to
particular graves and are located on the angle scale at the angle
the particular burial points.
Inspection of this figure shows that most burial directions
are at angles which are south of due west. If it is assumed
correctly that the burials were in fact made with feet toward the
setting sun, then this would indicate that 80% of the burials
occurred between September 21 and March 21, the autumnal
and spring equinoxes. Therefore, it should be possible to arrive
at a good guess as to what month of the year the persons may
have died.
As an example, Burial 6. shown in Fig. 13, has a direction of
15° south of west. If a line is drawn horizontally until it intersects the curve it would intersect twice, which would indicate
the individual may have died in either October or February. It is
readily apparent that there is no way of knowing which of these
two months is the correct one. However, it is probable that more
died in February than in October. Reasons for this would be
depletion of the stored food supply, the miserable weather (note
the temperature scales on the figure}, and more difficulty in
hunting and food gathering. October, on the other hand, usually
provides excellent weather with a large quantity of forest
products and a mean temperature of 66° F. In general, it is a
time of harvest and well-being. Usually, the fall weather from
mid-September to some time in November is mild. The bad,
uncomfortable, wet, cold period extends into March. Though
there is usually snow or sleet several times during the course of
a winter, snow would be a relatively small problem as the
average snow cover is only eight days. Recent weather conditions in this area are summarized by Blood (1960).
Fig. 14 shows in bar chart form the grave directions at the
Carpenter Site compared with those of the Johns Site, another

various angular increments as indicated, i.e. 0°-10% inclusive,
for example. The time periods when the sun sets at or between
the indicated angles is also show. The height of the bar indicates

the percent of graves which were oriented at or between the
ir~dicated angles.
Inspection of the figure shows the similarity of the grave
directions between the two sites. This similarity would be expected if the people died at the same time of year and the
position of the sun was the determining factor in grave alignment.
The east-west orientation of the Carpenter Site graves is not
unique in the Titus Focus. In fact this should be regarded as a
major diagnostic trait of the Titus Focus in northeast Texas.
All graves (from all northeast Texas Titus Focus cemeteries
listed in this report for which the grave directions are recorded)
were generally east-west oriented with head to the east and feet
to the west. However, no records concerning the grave direction
are available for Rumsey, Chasteen, Starrett, Keith (except for
one which was with feet to west) Keeling, and Ellison Lake.
In several of the sites excavated during the 1930’s, the
burial direction was noted as due east, north east, or south
east--a general direction rather than an exact one.
In only two sites, the A.P. Williams and the Taylor
cemeteries, were more graves oriented with feet north of west
than south of west.
Titus Related Sites, Toledo Bend Reservoir Area

The Bison "B" (Woodall 1969) and Salt Lick Sites (McClurkan et al. 1966) located in the Toledo Bend Reservoir yielded
both extended and flexed burials. The grave direction of the
extended burials was predominately with feet to northeast and
north, not westerly as in northeast Texas. The relation of these
sites to Titus Focus will be discussed in more detail in later
sections of this paper.
Allen and Frankston Foci

The east-west grave orientation is also probably a trait of
the Allen Focus (historic) and Frankston Focus (prehistoric focus
from which Alien derived).
Written records of burial customs of the Hasinai are
available from reports of the Spanish missionaries (Griffith 1954:
94-96). The Hasinai, who are identified archeologically as the
Allen Focus (Suhm, et al. 1954: 218-221) were located ap-

proximately 70 to 80 miles south of the northeast Texas Titus
Focus area.
Espinosa who entered the Hasinai country in 1715 was a
major chronicler. Espinosa (Swanton 1942: 204) had this to say
about burials and beliefs concerning the soul:
These Indians understand well and confess a belief in the immortality of the soul. This is evidenced by the burials and funeral
honors they pay as follows. They prepare the dead body for burial.
after first bathing it, by clothing it in the best clothes they have or in
fresh deer skins. With great lamentations, they keep it for several
hours in the home. They provide great quantities of pinole, corn and
other eatables. If it be a man, they collect his bows and arrows, his
knife, and the other things needed in life and. if it be a woman, all
her domestic utensils, canisters, grinding instruments, and earthenvessels, because they say the dead will have need of them where
they are going. When asked where the souls of those who die go. they
answered, that. as soon as the souls leave the body they travel
towards the west and from there they rise once more into the air and

54

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

go close to the presence of the great captain whom they call coddi
eyo. From thence they go to wait in a house located towards the
south called the House of Death,

In a letter dated August 15, 1691, to the Viceroy of Mexico,
Casanas, the first missionary to the Hasinai, provided much information about these people. Concerning the mortuary customs,
Casanas (Swanton 1942: 207) says:
For this function, there are two Indians who serve as priests. They
say their duties are to talk to God and that He speaks to them. These
two Indians order a coffin for the dead man. Their order is promptly
obeyed. When the coffin is finished, the two Indians put into it some
tobacco and some of the herb they call ocaxio, and also a bow and
arrows. All these things they move about over the coffin. They keep
talking in a low voice as if they were praying. Their mode of speaking is
so strenuous that they perspire even though it be cold. During this
ceremony, the two wear skins. The ceremonies around the coffin being
finished, the Indians go to the place of interment which is always near
the house. There they talk again to themselves; but the grave is not
opened until, with an axe, they have made a stroke at the place where
the head of the dead man is to rest and another where the feet are to lie.
While the grave is being dug, the two return to the house and give
directions for placing the dead man in the coffin.

Though Casafias did not record the direction of the grave
with respect to the compass or the reason for its particular
placement, it is clear that its orientation was a matter of importance to those directing the affair.
Swanton (1942: 210) states:
When I visited the Caddo in 1912, (in Oklahoma) I was given to
understand that they buried their dead at full length, feet to the
west, so that the bodies faced west, the way the soul goes. This may
have been an error but not certainly so, as the custom of laying
bodies head to the west came in with Christianity, and in aboriginal
times the sout was supposed to travel west, not east...

Although the writings of Espinosa and Casanas date from the
late 1600’s and early 1700’s and concern the people of the present
Allen Focus, the Hasinai, there is every reason to believe the same
burial practices were in effect with the people of the area
(Frankston Focus) for a considerable period prior to the historic.
The archeological evidence indicates the same burial practices
also belonged to the people characterized as Titus Focus as well.

TUCK CARPENTER SITE

The ability to place a grave in a particular direction, such as
toward the sun at sunset with any prevision, would be hampered
by various conditions. Cloudy or overcast skies on some fall or
winter days would have forced them to estimate the direction of the
sun. Additional problems would, of course, be the location of the
cemetery with respect to forests and hills that might obscure the
actual location of the sun at its setting. In addition, an error of six
inches in the placement of one end of a six foot grave with respect
to the other end would result in a 5 o error in direction.
Whether or not a grave was oriented to a certain degree of
precision such as 5° or 10° in our measurement system was surely
of little importance to the Indians. The ritual would be the important thing.

Other Caddoan Burial Practices
The Sanders Site

The oldest nearby cultural group in which the east-west grave
orientation predominated is that at the Sanders Site, the type site
of Sanders Focus.
Krieger (1946: 175), in describing the burials states:
The 21 graves were in two groups, one scattered over the highest
part of "mound 1" and the other along the eastern end of the eminence
where it levels out along the terrace edge. There were no distinctions in
placement or content between the two groups. They contained a total of
60 individuals. Twelve graves contained a single individual; the other
nine contained 48 with from three to eight persons each. Without exception the body was extended at full length, usually on the back but at
times on the side or twisted to one side.

Concerning the grave orientation, Krieger states:
Grave pits were all rectangular. One skeleton lay with head to the
west, the direction of another was uncertain, and the remaining 58 lay
with head due east or within about 15 degrees of east; i.e. within the
range of seasonal variation in the point of sunrise.

It may be noted that this is also within the variation of the
point of sunset.

Angelina Focus

The Angelina Focus, defined by Jelks (1965), which was
centered in the McGee Bend Reservoir in Southeast Texas, contained burials in four sites attributed to this focus. In these sites
were eleven burials--six were flexed in various compass orientations, and five were extended and supine. Of the latter, two
burials were with the head to the north, two with head to the south,
and one with head southeast. The east-west orientation did not
play a part with these people.
Belcher Focus

At the Belcher Site (Webb 1959) the two burial pits assigned
by Webb to the Haley Focus were oriented west-southwest to
east-northeast with the heads west-southwest. The skeletons
were extended and supine.
The remaining burials, which were assigned to the Belcher
Focus occupation, included one bundle burial and a disturbed
burial with pelvic region and legs remaining, (Burial 1) apparently extended and supine with feet pointing almost due west.
There were two additional disturbed burials, one with head
south. Also included were two infant burials for which direction
could not be determined and an infant burial with head to the
southeast. There were 11 graves with the skeletons all extended
and supine, oriented with heads between 5° and 21° east of
south. A group of three graves was located with heads between
15° and 23° west of south. One grave was oriented with head
39° east of south and one with head about 25° east of north.
One burial which contained seven skeletons was oriented southsoutheast to north-northwest. Webb notes that this is the only
burial at the site in which the burials were carelessly or
irregularly placed.
In this pit. however, one body was prone, another on the side, a third
lying transversely across the pit, and a fourth with the head directed
northwest, although most had the heads toward the southeast end of
the pit.

In other sites with components now assigned to Belcher
Focus--Foster Place, Friday Place,
and the McClure
Mound--Moore (1912) noted that individuals were placed with

TUCK CARPENTER SITE

head to south except for three at Foster Place which were with
heads to north, northwest, and northeast.
Except for the single disturbed burial at the Belcher Mound,
no other burials were oriented with feet westerly as in the Titus
Focus.
Texarkana Focus

Graves from cemeteries attributed to the Texarkana Focus do
not conform with the east-west orientation of Titus.
At the Paul Mitchell cemetery where the direction of 52 graves
was determined, 47, or 90%, were oriented with feet between true
north and 36° W of true north. An average direction for the 47 is
221/2 ° or exactly north-northwest. Three graves were oriented with
feet to the northwest, one with feet toward west, and one with feet
about 5° or 10° east of north. The direction of 5 burials was not
determined.
At the E. H. Moores plantation, where the direction of seven of
eight burials could be determined, four were oriented with feet approximately northwest, one with feet toward the south, one with
feet to the east, and one with feet to the west.
Two different burial plots were excavated near the Hatchell
Mound. In Plot I where the directions of seven graves were
determined, three were with feet between 9° and 34° north of
west, one with feet toward north-northeast, one with feet 9 o west
of south, and two oriented 11 ° west of north, one of which had feet
to the north and the other with feet to the south.
Plot II yielded six burials with notes on the direction of three.
All three were with feet toward the north.
Spiro Site
Bell and Baerreis (1951) in commenting on the burials in the
Craig Mound of the Spiro Focus stdte:
The Craig mound produced a variety of burials, single burials,
extended, flexed and semi-flexed burials; bundle burials and
cremations. Group burials are probably the most common and may
contain from two to thirty individuals. Grave goods were found with a
large number of the burials although not all graves contained artifacts.
Some burials were especially rich in grave goods while others produced
relatively litle, if any, associated material.

Brown (1966) in his description of the Craig Mound burials and
their contents has divided the burials into 16 different classes.
Although an occasional skeleton was oriented with head to east
and feet westerly, an east-west grave orientation was no trait of
importance at the Craig Mound.
Haley Site
A map prepared by Moore (1912: 529) indicates that at the
Haley Mound, type-site of the Haley Focus, seven skeletons were
oriented generally northwest-southeast with heads to the southeast. One skeleton was north-south with head to the north and
one northeast-southwest with head to the northeast.

GahaganMound
At Gahagan the skeletons were parallel to the walls of the
rectangular pits in which they were placed. All were extended
and on their backs. In Pit 1 the heads were to the northwest and
northeast; in Pit 2, northwest, southwest, southeast; in Pit 3 all
were north-northwest. These arrangements are noted by Moore
(1912: 513) for Pit 1 anal by Webb and Dodd (1939) for Pits 2 and
3.

George C. Davis Site
Mound C at the Davis site (type site of Alto Focus) was
partially excavated by Story from 1968-1970 (Story 1972).
Eleven pit burials were excavated during this period. Other
grave pits were located but were not excavated.
The grave pits were arranged in a sequence of Stages from
I to VI by Story. Stage I was represented by a single pit containing eight individuals. This pit, over which the mound was
built, originated at the ground surface. The following stages
were related to various stages of the mound construction which
occurred over the following centuries.
In grave pits of Stages I through IV, sufficient skeletal
remains were found to determine that the individuals had been
placed in a supine position, and in all cases with head to the
north and feet to the south. Soil acidity had caused the loss of all
skeletal material from the graves of Stages V and VI.

McCurtain Focus
Burials from McCurtain Focus sites appear mainly to have
east-west orientations like Titus Focus graves. Oklahoma sites of
this focus partially follow this trend.
Reporting on the E. Johnson Site, Wyckoff (1967) listed seven
burials which he attributed to the McCurtain Focus. Six graves
were east-west oriented, and one was northeast-southwest.
Enough skeletal material remained in four graves to determine
the skull position. In all four cases, it was to the east.
Reporting on the Sam Kaufman site in Texas, Harris (1953)
described eleven burials. Of these burials, four were east-west
oriented with head to east. Three were northeast-southwest
oriented with head to the northeast. Three were with head to the
north. One of these burials contained 28 blue glass beads. In the
remaining burial, a direction could not be determined. Perhaps
by historic times in this site, the east-west orientation was not
rigorously adhered to.
Skinner et al. (1969: 26) reported on additional excavations
at the Kaufman site which were conducted by salvage crews
from Southern Methodist University. During the excavations, 23
burials were found. Orientation was consistently east-west with
head to east. Skeletons were extended on their backs in individual graves except for one multiple burial containing four
individuals and a large shaft burial containing eleven individuals.
At the Eleventh Caddo Conference in March, 1968, Wyckoff
listed various sites which he equated with an early phase of the
McCurtain Focus and which he has grouped as the Mountain
Fork Complex. These sites are: Biggham Creek, Lamas Branch, E.
Johnson, Woods Mound Group, Bill Hughes, and Beaver.
Concerning burials at these sites he noted
single individuals, extended and supine with heads to east, north
east, or southeast. Association usually pottery, from 1 to 5 vessels
usually clustered around head and shoulders.

In summary, the east-west grave orientation of the Titus Focus
with head to east and feet to west also seems to be a trait of the
Frankston and McCurtain foci which were contemporaneous, of
the historic Allen Focus, and of the Sanders Focus which preceded
it in time. Contemporaneous foci which did not exhibit this trait

were: Texarkana, Belcher, and Angelina. Three Gibson Aspect foci

SEX IDENTIFICATIONS FOR BURIALS AT
THE CARPENTER SITE
The skeletal remains from the Carpenter Site graves were
analyzed as to sex by Duncan F. Wilson (who at the time of the
analysis was a student assistant in the Department of Anthropology at The University of Texas at Austin). Two separate
analyses were made by Wilson. The first was in December,
1967, and the second was in February, 1968. The second
analysis by Wilson was made without reference to the results of
the first.
The results of the two analyses are shown in the first two
columns of Fig. 16. The two analyses agree very closely, even for
the cases where the sex was questionable. The next column is
the author’s opinion as to the sex of the individual. It is based on
the two analyses and on the grave contents. Where the third
column differs from the first two, the author has weighed the
grave contents against the uncertainty of the skeletal analyses
and decided the sex on this basis.

Additional columns in this figure list arrow point types,
tools, ornaments, ceramics, and other items and traits. If an item
or trait is associated with a grave, a black dot was placed in the
appropriate square. The four shaded columns indicate traits or
artifacts that seemed to be almost completely associated with
only one sex. The shaded columns show that deer mandibles and
potters’ clay were associated with the female burials. Pipes and
evidence of fire were associated with male burials. Celts were
associated with both sexes, but mainly with the male at a ratio
of 5 to 2. Paint was more frequent in male graves by a ratio of
10 to 6, whereas the presence of mussel shell was more frequent
in female graves with a ratio of 8 to 3.
Arrow points were in both male and female graves.
However the quantity in the female graves was generally much
smaller than in those of males.
The two graves of young children and that of a juvenile
contained few offerings other than pottery vessels.
The late component graves, which are identified with an
asterisk, are emphasized because of the presence of Talco arrow
points and the pendant triangle motif on bowls.

62

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Late component graves, i.e, those that contain carinated bowls with
pendant triangle rim decoration and usually contain Talco points.

THE ARTIFACTS
Arrow Points

Of the 44 graves, 31, or 70%, contained one or more arrow
points. It is possible that some of the remaining graves may have
contained one or two which were missed. Fig. 16 itemizes the
number and type found in each grave. There were four distinct
point classifications in the graves. Stemmed points were Bassett
and Perdiz, and triangular points were Maud and Talco. Some
stemmed points had stems which seemed a little too long to be
classified as Bassett and a little too short to be Perdiz. Also,
some triangular points had basal concavities which were not
quite deep enough to fit the Maud type, but too deep to be
classified as Talco. Nevertheless, all were placed in one of the four
categories on a best-judgement basis.
An example of point types from a single grave is pictured in
Fig. 17. The letters under each group of points indicate the
location in the grave where they were found. Croup D includes
two Maud and two Perdiz points. Croup E is solely Perdiz points.
Croup F is classified as Bassett, though this is a case where the
stems seem a little long for Bassett. Croup C and Point H are
Maud.
Fig. 18 shows typical triangular points from several graves.
Points A through F in this figure are Talco points. Those shown
indicate the size range at the Carpenter Site. Point D is representative of the size of most Talco points found.
Points G through M are all from Grave 19. These points are
classified as Talco but have a different form in the base region.
They are identified by a straight or convex region in the basal
concavity, flanked by ear-like protuberances. This modification
of the basic Talco point has been noted as a minor type at three
other Titus Focus sites.
Points N through R are Maud points from several different
graves. Point S is gray flint and is an unidentified type. This was
the only point of this material and style in all the graves.
Fig. 19 shows short stemmed points which are classed as
Bassett. These are from various graves which are indicated in
the figure caption.
Fig. 20 illustrates points classed as Perdiz. These are also
from various graves.

64

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

There are no known flint outcrops in this portion of Texas.
As a consequence, the material utilized to manufacture a large
majority of the points at this site was a fine-grained quartzite
which was probably obtained locally. Nodules of quartzite,
which range in size from a few ounces to several pounds, erode
from the red clays of the area. It also occurs in the outwash of
ancient mountain ranges in Oklahoma, such as the Arbuckle
(Shafer 1973: 51). The colors of the local quartzite are various
shades of yellow-tan, gray, and pink-maroon.
In addition to the quartzite used for point manufacture,
various cherts were also employed. The cherts graded from
cream to brown in color with occasional shades of gray and red.
All Maud and Talco points were of the quartzite material.
Ninety percent of the Bassett points were of quartzite with ten
percent chert. The material of 56° of the Perdiz points was
chert, however, with the remaining 45% quartzite.
The use of chert (probably from stream pebbles) for many of
the Perdiz points and the virtual abandonment of chert as a
material for the Bassett and triangular point types seems to
indicate that at the Carpenter Site, the choice of material
changed with the change in point styles.
Quartzite was used in a large majority of the dart points
associated with the archaic period in this region of Texas.
A fragment of a single dart point the proximal end of an
Edgewood point was found in Grave 9. Since Grave 9 was a
child’s burial, the broken point may have been a toy or curiosity
belonging to him.
No other dart points were found in the graves or in the
grave fill. A single Gary point was found on the surface at the
southwestern extremity of the cemetery. A single Catahoula
arrow point, 21 mm long, was also found on the surface. This is
the only occurrence of this type point at the site.
Green Pigment
Green pigment was found in 12 graves. Usually it was
located in a very small pot or bowl, but sometimes it would be on
a fairly large potsherd used like a saucer. Occasionally, a few
small bits would be under a vessel or in the dirt as if sprinkled
or tossed into the burial. In some instances it would be in a
cache of items perhaps included in a perishable container. In
one instance a small cylindrical-shaped piece of green pigment

was found. Most examples of green pigment were usually in
small irregularly shaped lumps. The pigment did not have much
tendency to leach or dissipate into the surrounding sand but held
its original shape well.
No vessels were found with green pigment worked into the
engraved or incised lines of decorations. When wet, the green
pigment has the feel and consistency of wet clay. The color is
not a bright green, but an olive green.
A sample of material from a burial at the Keeling Site is
apparently the raw material used in the preparation of the green
pigment. This was identified by L. E. Garner, geologist with the
Bureau of Economic Geology, University of Texas at Austin, as
a glauconite sandy clay which is a complex silicate rich in iron.
Unweathered glanconite is green. Weathered glauconite is generally
reddish-brown because the iron has been altered to iron oxide.

When crushed, the sample from the Keeling Site formed a fine
powder, and when wet it yielded the same color and had the same
feel as the material from the Carpenter Site. The conclusion
concerning the green pigment found in the burials is that it is a
glauconitic sandy clay which had been crushed into a fine powder.
It is probable that the powder was then mixed with animal fat or
water by the Indians to give it the required body for easy application.

Red Pigment
Red pigment was in 10 graves. Like the green pigment it was
contained on sherds or in small vessels. However, unlike the green
pigment, the red pigment leached into the surrounding sand. Sometimes a reddish smear in the sand was the only indication of its
presence. On occasion, the location of a vessel containing red
pigment could be detected by the reddish color of the sand directly
above it even before the vessel itself was uncovered.
The red pigment is iron oxide and probably came from
scrapings from hematite. This particular region of east Texas
contains large quantities of iron ore, so wide varieties of hematite
or iron oxide rocks were readily available. However, the only
hematite found in the cemetery was in the cache of Grave 19.
Five graves contained both red and green pigment.

7O

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Ornamentation

Items of ornamentation were relatively scarce in the Carpenter burials.
The red, green and white pigment (kaolin) when suitably
mixed with water or grease probably served for painting on the
face and body.
Artifacts for ornamentation consisted of a single columnella
of a conch shell which was found in the neck region of the individual in Grave 27.
A rectangular mussel shell fragment with rounded corners
was in Grave 21. This could have been some type of inset but
cannot be positively identified as such.
Spool shaped ceramic ear plugs were in Graves 31 and 32.
A single, similarly shaped stone earspool with a copper plate on
one face was found in Grave 34. A major fragment of a soft
sandstone earspool was embedded in a lump of clay in Burial 38.
Two wooden disc-shaped objects were found on either side of the
skull in Grave 40. The one located on the left side of the skull
was nearly complete, and the other was just a fragment. (Fig. 21
shows these items as well as the ear plugs.) The larger piece is
contoured on its outward side like the cymbal-shaped copper
ornaments from the Coral Snake Mound (McClurkan, et al.,
1966).
On both objects a green powdery residue was present on
small irregularly shaped areas. A wet chemistry qualitative
analysis of this residue indicated it is probably a copper s~ilt.
The same test run on scrapings from the copper plate on the
stone earspool from Grave 34 gave the same result. This indicates that the wooden discs were once associated with a
copper sheath like the one on the stone earspool. Unfortunately,
the case is not that clear cut; in addition to the green areas,
certain areas have a reddish cast or appearance. Microscopic
examination shows a red pigment in the grains of the wood. One
explanation could be that the ornaments originally had a copper
cover that was removed. Then, red pigment could have been
smeared on the wood as a substitute. Whether this explanation
is valid or not, the main significance of the wooden ornament is
that it shows the cymbal shaped ornament persisted into Titus
Focus times from earlier cultures.
The ceramic earspool and the stone earspool with the

TUCK CARPENTER SITE

71

copper plate were all found against the skulls in positions that
definitely identified them as ear ornaments as opposed to lip or
nose ornaments. The wooden cymbal-shaped plate and fragment
were located at a lower level--more beside the jawbone of the
individual. This would indicate that they were suspended in
some manner.
The ceramic earspools are a known trait of the Titus Focus,
whereas the stone earspool with copper plate and the cymbalshaped wooden artifact have not been reported before.
Pipes

Fig. 22 pictures the pipes from the graves. Those identified
with letters "a" through "d" look as if a stem that extended past
the bowl folded up against the bowl while the clay was still
plastic. This pipe form was first pointed out by Moore (1912:
637) and has also been discussed by Hoffman (1967: 4).
Pipe "e" has a small keelqike protuberance which may
represent the vestigial remains of the stem as mentioned above.
Pipes "f", "g", and "h" have conical bowls. Pipe "h" has an
engraved ladder motif and small holes. Kaolin had been inserted
in these engraved areas.
Pipe "a" which was from a late component grave did not
differ in form from pipes "b" through "d" which belonged to
earlier component graves.
No uniform position for placing a pipe in the grave was
evident in this cemetery. The relation of the pipe to the skeleton
in Grave 1 is unknown, as the skeleton was completely absent.
However, it was probably on the right side of the body. In
Graves 23, 25, and 43, the pipes were in proximity to the skull
but at a higher level. In Graves 18, 24, and 26, the pipes were at
the same elevation as the skeleton. In Grave 18 it was beside the
right wrist, in Grave 24 it was probably near the left elbow, and
in Grave 26 it was near the left knee.
Pottery
The major Titus Focus pottery types have been defined as to
paste and vessel form by Suhm, et al. (1954). The vessels from
the Carpenter Site fall within their definitions
The average number of vessels per individual at the Carpenter cemetery was approximately 8.8. This average is neither

high nor low in relation to other Titus Focus cemeteries. At the
McKinney Site there was an average of 10.7 vessels for nine
graves. (There were two additional graves, but the exact number
of vessels for them was not available.) This represents the
highest average within the Titus Focus known to the author. At
the opposite end of the scale, there was an average of 4.4
vessels for 5 graves at the Atkinson Site.
Within the Carpenter cemetery, Grave 21, which was a
double burial, contained 17 vessels. Grave 35 contained only
three. These represented the extremes.
From an inspection of the grave drawings, it is apparent
that the carinated bowl was present in the greatest quantity.
These bowls rarely showed use as cooking vessels. Small vessels
of this type sometimes contained paint, but the larger ones give
no indication as to their actual use. Casanas, (Swanton 1942:
157) referring to the Hasanai, said that "the plates they use are
round earthen pans." Espinosa (ibid.) mentioned "earthen
vessels, some large and some small, in which to serve the old
and the young." From these brief descriptions and from a lack of
evidence to the contrary, it appears the carinated bowls may
have been used in this manner. Obviously, they could have been
used to hold most anything.
Large and small compound bowls were present in many
graves. Very small bowls sometimes contained paint, as did
small carinated bowls. Like the carinated bowls, these vessels
seldom showed use as cooking vessels, either. Occasionally, one
showed a trace of having been in a fire. Two large compound
vessels which were in Graves 27 and 29 contained a deer
mandible each. The large compound vessels would serve well for
storage of food, whether agricultural products such as corn or
beans, or that gathered from the forest.
The other major categories of vessels include the cooking
vessels, bottles, and jars. Effigy vessels were only occasionally
included, and rattle bowls were included in the grave offerings
even less frequently.
Figs. 12 and 23 picture selected Ripley Engraved carinated
bowl designs from the Carpenter Site and from other Titus Focus
sites. In Figure 12 vessels "a" through "c" are vessels which
exhibit the pendant triangle motif common to the nine late
component graves. This motif did not occur in the other 35
graves. Vessels "d" and "e" are decorated with the scroll motif.

TUCK CARPENTER SITE

75

This design was present in both the early and late component
graves. Vessels "f" and "g" were engraved with the horizontal
diamond motif. In addition, the diamonds on vessel "g" were
vertically bisected. Vessels "h", "k", and "m" feature the
triangular motif. Vessel "k" and "m" styles were most common
in the earlier component graves. Vessel "h", which has the small
engraved triangles appended to some of the diagonals, occurred
less frequently.
Fig. 23 pictures several carinated bowls from sites other
than Carpenter. Several of the motifs on these bowls were also
present at the Carpenter Site. Vessel "a" is a modification of the
scroll motif. In this variation the usual circles appear as
semicircles which alternately originate from the shoulder and
rim. The usual diagonal that connects the top of one circle to the
bottom of the next is more horizontal in this design. Vessel "c" is
also a special form of the scroll motif. The motif on vessel "b"
was not present at Carpenter but does appear in other Titus
Focus sites as well as in other Fulton Aspect foci. Vessel "e"
represents a combination of a scroll motif and inverted triangle
design. Vessels "d" and "k" are rectalinear designs that occur
in several sites. Vessel "i" from the Johns Site in unique. It
seems to portray stemmed arrow points as the filler under and
above the diagonal lines. Vessel "g" from the Rumsey Site is
Killough Pinched. Vessel "f" from the Harold Williams Site is a
spherical jar with the Wilder Engraved design. Vessel "m" is
one of several bottles from the Russell Site with this decorative
motif. A single identical bottle was in a grave of the Caldwell
Site and was probably a trade vessel from Russell. A slight
variation from this motif was on a vessel from the Starrett
collection.
Fig. 24 pictures several compound vessels. These vessels
"a" through "e" are all classified as Ripley Engraved. Vessels
"a", "b", and "e" exhibit scroll or modified scroll design motifs.
Vessels "c" and "d" have excised triangular areas with either
vertical or slanted lines between them. Small compound vessels
frequently have peaked rims. Several of these are shown in the
grave drawings. Vessel "f" of Fig. 24 is a very large vessel with
horizontal punctates below the lip and at the junction of body
and rim. Between these rows are roughly parallel, incised
slanted lines. The body is plain. No type-name has yet been given

76

vessels with this decorative motif. Vessel "g" is a large Bullard
Brushed cooking pot.
Fig. 25 pictures several Carpenter Site cooking vessel types.
Vessel "a" is La Rue Neck Banded, and "b" is Maydelle Incised.
Vessels "e" and "f" are Cass Appliques and "g", "h", and "k"
are Harleton Applique. Vessel "c" was unique at this site. The
body is covered with parallel rows of fingernail punctates, and
the rim is horizontally brushed. Vessel "d" is Bullard Brushed. It
is covered from the rim to near the base with vertical brushing,
while the rim is decorated with punctates. Vessels "c" and "d"
do not fit any defined type.
Most of the vessels pictured in Fig. 25 show a cleaner exterior near the base than higher on the vessel side. This appearance would be expected for vessels which were nestled in a bed
of coals. The more intense heat near the coals would burn away
the soot or grease while the cooler flame higher up would not.
In addition to the vessel types pictured (Bullard, Cass,
Harleton, Maydelle, and La Rue) many vessels with other combinations of decorations were present. There were many cooking
vessels with two to four rows of punctates around the rim. About
half of these vessels had the rim raised into four peaks. Most of
these vessels also had small nodes below each peak. Their
bodies were plain, had vertically incised lines, or were brushed.
Four vessels were decorated on the rim with geometric
punctate designs. On these vessels the bodies were plain, vertically incised, or brushed, too. Vessels with Maydelle incising on
the rim were also plain, vertically incised, or brushed on the
body.
Several cooking vessels had vertically incised or combed
lines on the rim with a plain, brushed, or vertically incised body.
Other combinations of rim and body decoration were present,
but are not described. These can be noted by the reader in the
grave drawings.
Cooking vessels at the Carpenter Site and in all Titus Focus
sites are decorated with appliques, nodes, brushing, punctating,
incising, and infrequently, combing. Engraving was not used on
vessels constructed for cooking. The rough exterior of cooking
vessels which resulted from brushing anv applique may have
facilitated handling of the vessels when they were hot or increased the surface area for heat absorption.

Fig. 26 pictures bottles and a spherical jar with Ripley
Engraved decorative motif. All vessels are from the Carpenter
early component graves. The bodies of vessels "a" and "b" are
formed into four points that give the bottle a square appearance
when viewed from above. These bottles are polished and nearly
black. Red pigment was worked into the engraved lines. Though
not identical in design, the workmanship of these vessels is so
similar that they might have been made by the same person.
Vessel "c" does not have a typical bottle design. However, it
does incorporate the ticked circle and one half the diamond
element of the bottles that have the classic, concentric circle and
diamond design. Vessels "d", "e", and "f" are all similar in
their designs, which have crosses inside the inner circles.
Vessels "e" and "f" have red pigment in the engraved lines.
Vessel "d" showed no pigment in the lines. Vessel "g" had slight
traces of white pigment, probably kaolin, in the engraving.
Fig. 27 shows additional bottles from the Carpenter graves.
Vessels "a" and "b" are undecorated, but "b" is covered with a
red slip. The design motif on vessels "c" through "h" is Wilder
Engraved. The Wilder Engraved bottles were in both the early
and late component graves, (8 out of 9 of the latter). Vessels "d",
"g", and "h" are from the late component. Vessel "c" is a
double bottle with a Ripley Engraved design on the square top
part and Wilder Engraved on the circular lower portion. Vessel
"f" is red slipped with the design cut through to the buff paste.
All other bottles have red pigment in the engraving, the vessels
shown are representative of the bottle shapes and sizes from the
Carpenter Site. However, vessel "h" is unique.
A study of bottle placement with respect to the skeleton in
the Carpenter graves has shown the following. Placement on the
right side of the body was favored over left side by a ratio of
two-to-one. Favorite specific locations in the order of descending
popularity were: right knee, 6 cases; right wrist or hip, 5; right
elbow, 4; between the feet, 4; right side of skull, 3; left side of
skull, 3; and left knee, 3. The remaining locations, represented
by only one or two cases, were: The ankles; midway on the left
tibia; midway on the right femur; midway on the right and left
radii; left elbow; the left shoulder; and midway on the right
humerus.

appear square in the plan view. Three graves contained vessels
of this type. Vessels "c", "d", and "e" are typical of the effigy
vessels from this site. All are small vessels with fiat tails
pointing outward from the bowl. The heads are on the opposite
side. In all cases the heads were abstract in form and no
identification with a particular animal, bird, or human head
could be made. Vessels of this type were in nine graves. Vessels
"f", "g", and "h" are rattle bowls. One node of vessel "f" came
loose after the vessel was removed from the grave. The node
contained several baked clay balls about the size of small peas.
Only three graves contained rattle bowls.
In Fig. 29, "a" through "f" picture probable trade vessels
which were in the Carpenter graves. Bottle "a" has an orangetan external coloration (not a slip) unlike all other bottles at the
site. The design consists of concentric semicircles and spur-like
elements. The drawing of Grave 18 shows this design in better
detail. These elements are common on Avery Engraved vessels of
the Texarkana and McCurain foci, and more often on bowls than
bottles. This bottle is probably a trade vessel from the north,
either from the Texarkana or McCurtain Focus.
Vessel "b" is classified as Avery Red (red slipped) and is
like those found in the pit and shaft burials at the Kaufman Site.
These graves belonged to the McCurtain component at that site.
The description of the artifacts from Grave 23 provides more
detailed information about this bottle type.
Vessel "c" from Grave 26 is Avery Engraved. It is covered
with a red slip and is engraved to expose the buff paste. No
pigment was used in the engraved lines. This is a trade vessel
from the Texarkana or McCurtain foci.
Vessel "d" is a Simms Engraved bowl from Grave 33, a late
component grave at the Carpenter Site. This vessel is also an
import from the Texarkana or McCurtain foci.
Vessel "e" is from Grave 37. This pot has several characteristics which point to a Poynor Engraved classification. Poynor
Engraved is a Frankston Focus type. The Frankston Focus area is
to the south of the Titus area. Further information concerning
this vessel is included in the description of the materials of
Grave 37.
Vessel "f" from Grave 27 is a large effigy which is completely different in form from those in the nine other graves that
contained effigy vessels. This vessel is described more fully in

Johns Engraved

Johns Engraved is a new pottery type proposed here. The
feature which differentiates it from other pottery types is the
design motif. This motif in its most easily identified form consists
of several bird heads. The engraved bird head is the only known
representation of a living creature (other than modeled effigies)
depicted on Titus Focus pottery. A variation of the motif employs
interlocking hooks, and a third design consists of a combination
of the two. These designs are shown in Figs. 30 and 31. The
vessels pictured are all lohns Engraved pots known at this time.
The definition for lohns Engraved is as follows:
PASTE-Temper: kaolin, bone, or none visible
Texture: compact, not crumbly
Color: shades of buff and gray, both on exterior and in core; fire
mottling
Surface finish: fairly smooth, both inside and out on the bowls and
just outside on the bottles
FORM-Wall thickness: 5-8 millimeters
Lip: rounded, rolled outward and smoothed, except on vessel "a",
Fig. 30, where it is rolled outward but not blended into the
body
Bases: flat to slightly convex
Vessel shapes: bottles, conical bowls, carinated bowls, and jars
DECORATION-Treatment: engraving; white kaolin may be inserted in the
engraved lines
Designs: bird head elements with hooked beak; lines which outline
beak may not close (Fig. 30, "d" and Fig. 31, "c"); These
elements may be either upright, suspended, or horizontally oriented as in Fig. 30, "b". A hook-like element as in
Fig. 31, "d" and "e". Bird .head may be used in conjunction with hook-like element Fig. 31, "b" and "c".
CULTURAL AFFILIATION-A Titus Focus type. So far recognized only in the Carpenter, Johns,
and Horton sites in Camp County and the Caldwell Site in Titus
County.

Bone and Shell
Deer ulnae appear to have been placed in the graves as
complete pieces. They are not shortened from wear as would be
expected if used as flaking tools. Ulnae were in three graves.
Deer mandibles were included as offerings in 10 graves. It has
been postulated by various authors that the mandibles may have
been used as corn shelling tools or as sickles. Mandibles were
found in large compound bowls in Graves 27 and 29 and one in a
large cooking vessel in Grave 45. If these vessels had contained
corn still on the cob when placed in the graves, presence of the
mandible would support the proposition that it was used as a
shelling tool. A deer mandible sickle is pictured in Swanton (1942:
Pl. 16). This was collected from the Caddo in Oklahoma in historic
times. The mandible very likely was used for both purposes.
A nearly rectangular piece of mussel shell from Grave 21 was
found at the neck region of the north skeleton of this double burial
and may have been mounted as an ornament. A columnella bead
from a conch was recovered in Grave 27. Both the mussel shell and
conch shell items were previously discussed under Ornamentation.

Stone Artifacts
Fig. 32 illustrates various stone artifacts from the Carpenter
graves. Items "a" through "g" are petaloid celts. All are pecked
and ground and show considerable battering on the butt end. The
bit is finely ground on all except "g". Celt "g" has a very dull bit,
apparently from use. The bit of celt "f" had been broken and then
reground resulting in the asymmetrical shape. A diagonal hinge
fracture which was probably a result of the break is visible in the
picture. The material of the celts, probably Ouachita sandstone, is
not locally available.
Item "h" is a quartzite stream pebble from Grave 10. It is
polished on one surface and shows some use as a hammer stone on
another side. Item "i", an abraiding stone of ferruginous sandstone, was associated with a deer ulna in Grave 45. Item "k" is a
roughly noded, natural ferruginous sandstone rock with two flat
breaks where protuberances had apparently been knocked off.
This rock had been placed between the teeth of the individual of
Grave 13. Item "m" from Grave 43 is either a utilized biface fragment or a small gouge. The edges and the bit show wear from use.
The material of this item is a tan, fine grained quartzite.

THE RELATION OF THE CARPENTER SITE TO OTHER
TITUS FOCUS SITES
A proposed temporal position of the Carpenter Site components with respect to other Titus Focus sites is indicated in
Fig. 33. In arranging the sites in this sequence, several factors
were considered. First, the assumption was made that some sites
were probably contemporary with others, some earlier in time,
and others later. In relating one site to another, pottery was
compared by classification, selected vessel shape, bottle type
and shape, selected carinated bowl decorative motif, and
selected design elements. Arrow point types were also used in
the analysis. These characteristics are all listed in Fig. 33.
The pottery types are grouped by the foci with which they
are primarily associated. Generally, at a given site, the presence
of pottery types other than those which are major Titus Focus
types, would indicate trade or contact between foci.
To establish which pottery types or vessel forms in Titus
Focus were the most recent, Titus Focus vessels were compared
with vessels from four historic and one proto-historic site. These
sites are the top five in Fig. 33. The top four are sites which
contained some artifacts of European manufacture in the graves.
The fifth, the Hunt Site, contained no European artifacts, only
those of Indian manufacture which were nearly identical to
those from the Clements Site. These two sites are discussed by
Suhm, et al. (1954: 225).
The Slade and Brown Sites (Webb, et al., 1969: 8) are
located in southern Harrison County and the Clements and Hunt
sites in Cass County. These sites are all near the Titus Focus
area in Northeast Texas. They are not part of the Titus Focus
but are Indian cemeteries of a later period. No historic cemetery
site or sites which contained artifacts of European manufacture
have been reported within the Titus Focus area proper.
The earliest known sites which can be included in the Titus
Focus are those of the Whelan Complex. These sites are near the
bottom of the list in Fig. 33. In the two bottom positions are the
Adkins #1 and W.O. Reed sites. These are Fulton Aspect
cemetery sites which are located in the Titus Focus area (Fig. 2)
but most likely precede or are contemporary with the Whelan
Complex. They do not exhibit enough Titus Focus characteristics
to be placed in the Focus.

92

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

In addition to establishing early and late pottery types to aid
in determining the relative temporal position of the Titus Focus
sites, a yardstick was needed to relate the arrow point types
from the sites. For example, some Titus Focus sites contained
only Talco points (triangular), some only stemmed points, and
some (like Carpenter) a mixture of point types. If one of these
styles (stemmed or triangular) is clearly older than the other in
the Titus Focus, and if it can be established what the relative
age is, then another means to place the sites in a temporal order
would be available.
To establish this relative age, percentages of arrow points
from graves, middens and other features of other caddo sites
were calculated. Detailed data on these analyses and
calculations could not be presented here, but are on file with the
author and the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory,
Austin. Those sites and foci studied include both the Gibson and
Fulton Aspect periods. Fig. 15 shows the geographical location of
the various foci with respect to the Titus. The data for arrow
point analysis also includes materials from the Davis Site (Alto
Focus); see Newell and Krieger (1949) and Story (1972). Information for Mound A at Gahagan was supplied by Dr.
Clarence H. Webb.
The reader may be unfamiliar with several of the arrow
point types from the Craig Mound of the Spiro Focus. All of these
points are stemmed, or side or corner notched with the exception
of one Fresno point.
At the opposite end of the time scale, during Caddo V or
historic times, the triangular points were much in evidence. The
Turney point was present in the Allen Focus and the Fresno
point was by far the most popular form with the peoples who
composed the Norteho Focus.
It is apparent from the analyses that in the Caddoan area
the stemmed and notched points precede the triangular points in
time. With this as a guide, it is then logical to assume that the
Titus Focus sites where stemmed points are present and
triangular points absent are older than those where the
triangular point was the predominant type.
Thus, early and late arrow point styles have been established. The Whelan Complex and its pottery styles have been
established as the lower boundary (or earliest sites) and nearby
historic sites and their pottery as the upper boundary.

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Therefore, the remaining task is to order the Titus Focus sites
within this framework.
To start site ordering, pottery types and vessel forms from
the historic sites were matched with similar types from Titus
Focus sites. In particular, Titus sites containing spool-necked
bottles and Taylor Engraved, Hodges Engraved, Simms Engraved,
and Clements Brushed pottery were placed at the top of the list.
This, then, established other similarities between these Titus
sites such as the Bailey Engraved bottle and the bottle with
extended base. The pendant triangle carinated bowl decorative
motif, the scroll motif, and the two motifs at the far right of the
"rim decorative style" section are other similarities. In addition,
the arrow points from the graves were nearly completely of the
Talco type except for the Bison "B" and Salt Lick sites which
will be discussed later.
It is the author’s belief that when an intricate design or
unique artifact form from one site appears as a minor type or
part of the assemblage of another, a close correlation in time between the two is implied. This is based on the assumption that
the design or artifact actually had to be seen before it could be
duplicated. Trade between groups of people would also account
for its spread. In either case, contemporaneity may be assumed.
Examples of this are: the four carinated bowl, decorative motifs
at the right of the panel; the bird head; the completely encircled
cross design elements; or the chalice vessel form.
In addition to working backward in time from the historic
pottery types, sites were correlated forward in time from the
Whelan Complex characteristics. Two main items used for
correlation were Pease Brushed Incised pottery and the earlier
arrow point types. This correlation then established the classic
round and square Ripley Engraved bottles, the triangular design
on carinated bowls, and Perdiz arrow points as continuing
characteristics.
With the early Johns and Carpenter site components, Bassett
and Maud points came into the picture with Perdiz. The Johns
site was divided into early and late components as was the
Carpenter Site. These components are noted on this chart (Fig.
33) as 1st and 2nd Johns or Carpenter.
The shaded strips are intended to emphasize the beginning
and end of various traits and the grouping of sites where these
traits were present (see Fig. 33).

TUCK CARPENTER SITE

95

In any comparison of this sort, it becomes apparent that
certain decorative styles, pottery types, or design elements
extend throughout the time span represented by these sites.
Some were limited in popularity, evolved somewhere along the
way, or were perhaps only regional in extent.
Examples of items other than pottery types that span most
of the Titus Focus time period are: large compound bowls;
bottles of Wilder Engraved; the scroll design on carinated bowls;
the encircled cross element (where the cross touches the circle};
the sun symbol element; and the "s" element.
The pendant triangle rim design on carinated bowls is an
example of a style which evolved and became more popular with
time. The encircled cross element where the cross does not
touch the circle is an example of a regional characteristic. The
sites where this element was present are on the western fringe
of the Titus area.
The Bison "B" and Salt Lick sites are reported by Woodall
(1969), and McClurkan, et al. (1966), respectively. These
sites were located in the Toledo Bend Reservoir area on
the Sabine River approximately 75-80 miles southeast of the
Northeast Texas Titus Focus area. Fig. 15 shows this location. In
the figure the encircled area is noted as Titus Related. In addition to these two sites that included graves, the Goode Site
(Woodall 1969} in the same reservoir area produced over 8000
sherds but no graves. Pottery types identified by Woodall included Ripley Engraved, Poynor Engraved, Hodges Engraved, and
Belcher Ridged. Three (possibly four) Perdiz points represented
the total number of arrow points. Among the Ripley Engraved
sherds from carinated bowls from the Goode Site are excellent
examples of the pendant triangle, scroll, and triangular motifs
common in the northeast Texas area.
Clearly, the Toledo Bend Reservoir sites are related to Titus,
even though there are many differences. In addition to differences in grave direction, (feet to the notheast to north in Toledo
Bend as opposed to westerly in northeast Texas), Toledo Bend
ceramics exhibit a much higher percentage of bone temper than
does the northeast Texas Titus Focus pottery (Woodall 1969: 11,
48). Still other differences include the cooking vessel types which
are more closely allied to Belcher Focus that to Titus. The Ripley
Engraved carinated bowls of the Bison "B" and Salt Lick sites
are consistently smaller in size than those in northeast Texas

96

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

although they incorporate several of the carinated bowl design
motifs. Both of these sites produced shallow burials with flexed
skeletons and numerous offerings. Flexed skeletons are a feature
held in common with several Angelina Focus sites (Jelks 1965).
The Wilder Engraved bottles of the Bison "B" site, small Taylor
Engraved bottles from the Salt Lick site, and one particular
Harleton Applique vessel from the Bison "B" Site are all indistinguishable from their counterparts in northeast Texas.
In placing these sites in the temporal sequence, the pottery
similarities were used and the arrow point types were ignored.
Justification for this is based on the belief that the arrow point
tradition in this area is akin to the Angelina and Belcher foci
where the point types were stemmed rather than to Titus where
a change to triangular occurred.
From inspection of Fig. 33, it may be noted that the Rumsey
Site is characterized by both Titus Focus and Gibson Aspect
pottery. In placing the site within the Titus Focus, only the Titus
Focus pottery types were considered. This site is represented
only with a collection of pottery, and no information rearding
the graves is available. Obviously certain graves at the Rumsey
Site represent an older time period than Titus.
In the site sequence it should be remembered that two
different types of sites are included. The cemeteries provided
complete vessels and arrow points in direct context. The Whelan
Complex sites did not contain graves except for the Harroun Site
where one was found. The artifacts, sherds and points, used in
the ordering of this complex’s sites were acquired from the
general site excavations. The Roberts Site, which included a
mound built over a burned structure, also produced Pease
Brushed Incised sherds. Both traits are found in the Whelan,
Harroun, and Dalton sites and characterize the Whelan Complex.
The artifacts from the Roberts Site were mostly surface
finds from a nearby midden area. They included triangular
arrow points and carinated bowl rims with pendant triangle
design. These indicate a later time period than the Whelan
Complex. The Roberts Site was placed in the sequence based on
these artifacts.
If the artifacts and the mound at the Roberts Site were
contemporary, this would imply that erecting mounds over
burned structures existed later in the Titus sequence than

TUCK CARPENTER SITE

97

originally thought. On the other hand, the artifacts, or at least
part of them, may represent a superposition of later artifacts
over those coeval with the mound. Additional excavation will be
needed to establish the real relation between mound and midden
at the Roberts Site.
At several Titus Focus sites, there were graves present
which differed in character from the norm. The Bison "B" and
Salt Lick sites contained shallow, flexed burials with few or no
grave offerings as well as the deeper graves with extended
skeletons. At the Salt Lick Site, it was postulated by the excavators (McClurkan, et al., 1966: 56) that these graves indicates a
"difference of social status: either a caste system within the
tribal unit or slavery."
At the Harold Williams Site, at least four shallow graves
contained extended skeletons and no grave offerings. The skeletons were oriented one each with head to the east and west and
two with head to the north. This is in contrast to the consistent
head to east and feet to west of the nearby (30-40 feet} Titus
Focus cemetery. As no artifacts were present in the shallow
graves, there was no way of determining whether they preceded,
were contemporary with, or followed the Titus Focus cemetery in
time.
At the Ford Site, shallow graves which contained no vessels
to three pottery vessels and/or crude stone work were at the
same location as the Titus Focus graves. One Titus grave had cut
through one of the shallow graves. These shallow graves were
described as Farrar type burials by the site excavator (Goldschmidt 1935}. The Farrar Site nearby {within a mile or so)
yielded similar graves. Apparently, these graves predated the
Titus Focus burials.
Also, the Rumsey Site included both Gibson Aspect and
Titus Focus vessels. Based on this fact, it may be inferred that
both Gibson Aspect and the later Titus Focus graves were
present. It is interesting to note that Indians of different time
periods chose identical locations for their graves.
A feature of the older sites in the arranged sequence concerns the infrequency of carinated bowls in the graves. The
single grave at the Harroun Site contained but two vessels, one a
bottle and one a compound bowl with peaked rim. At the A.P.
Williams Site, there was less than one carinated bowl per grave.
At the Chasteen Site, there was a total of only three carinated

98

TEXAS

ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

bowls in two graves. In both the Adkins #1 and W. O. Reed sites,
this form was represented by only a minor percent of the
vessels. The popularity of this vessel form as an offering increased as time passed.
DATING THE CARPENTER SITE
Two sources provide information for dating the Carpenter
Site late component graves. The first is a radiocarbon date of
A.D. 1590 +_ 60 years (Tx-666) which was provided by The University of Texas at Austin Radiocarbon Dating Laboratory. The date
was obtained from the three small charred logs of Grave 10.
The second source of information is based on inference and
concerns the "chalice"-like vessel of Indian manufacture of
Grave 33, Fig. 34. Fig. 34 shows two additional stemmed
vessels--one from the Johns Site and one from the Gandy Site.
The vessel from the Gandy Site was first pictured in an article
by A.T. Jackson (1938) entitled "Fire in East Texas Burial
Rites". The spoon-like artifact of pottery shown in the figure
came from the same grave at the Johns Site as the "chalice."
This is the only artifact of this type known by the author to be
associated with the Titus Focus.
A search in the published archeological literature concerning Texas and bordering states has failed to disclose vessels
with true stems like those of Fig. 34. Inquiries concerning similar
vessels in the collections of the Gilcrease Museum and the University of Arkansas have also failed to disclose duplicates. The
vessel from the Gandy Site is the only vessel of this type in the
collections of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory.
Stemmed vessels can be accounted for as either a spontaneous development within the Titus Focus or a duplication of
an existing form. The latter event is more likely since no other
vessel shapes appear to be unique to Titus Focus. As this vessel
form is apparently not a trait of contemporary or prior loci, the
possibility exists that the vessel or vessels which engendered the
idea were of European manufacture. It should be remembered,
however, that no Titus Focus sites have contained artifacts of
European manufacture.
After considering various possible contacts between the
Indians of this region and Europeans, the De Soto expedition led
by Moscoso into Texas appears the most likely contact. After

landing in Florida in 1539, the expedition wandered through the
present southeastern states. The group which entered Texas in
1542 consisted of approximately 350 Europeans (a decrease from
the 600 who started the expedition) and 500 or more Indian
slaves. Their entrada into Texas was an attempt by the surviving
members of the expedition to reach present day Mexico. After
penetrating deep into Texas, they gave up their plan to reach
"New Spain" by land and retraced their path to the Mississippi
River.
The stemmed vessel from the Carpenter Site has been called
a chalice because of its close resemblance to the chalice as used
in the Mass. However, it is unlikely the people of the Titus Focus
would see this object. Both Swanton (1939) and Castaneda (1936:
121) report that in a battle with the Indians in October, 1540, at
Mavilla (Mobile)
they lost all their clothes they brought with them, the pearls they intended
to send to Cuba, the bandages and appliances of their only surgeon, and,
worst of all, the chalices, the altar decorations, the priest’s robes, the wine,
and the wheat flour reserved for the service of the Mass and all their
powder.

Even if all the chalices of the Mass were lost, stemmed wineglasses, stemmed cups, or stemmed goblets were probably still in
the possession of individuals during their excursion into Texas and
it is assumed that these vessels were seen by the Indians. Also,
spoons belonging to the expedition members could have been seen
by the Indians.
Historians differ on the route followed by the De Soto expedition in Texas as well as in other states. Fig. 35 shows the
proposed routes in Texas as defined by Castaneda (1936) and
Swanton (1939). The Castaneda route actually passed through
present day Camp and Franklin counties where the Carpenter,
Johns, and Gaudy sites are located. Additional circumstantial evidence that the Castaneda route may be closer to the one actually
followed than the route proposed by Swanton is provided by a
major fragment of a chain mail gauntlet found near Dallas. It was
exhibited and discussed by W. W. Crook at the annual meeting of
the Texas Archeological Society in Fort Worth in 1957. Since 1957,
an additional artifact of European manufacture and several Indian
artifacts which could have been associated with this expedition
have been found in Dallas.

If the expedition led by Moscoso (who became the leader after
De Soto’s death) did, in fact, pass through the region occuped by
the Titus Focus people, and if the idea for the stemmed vessels did
originate from vessels carried on this expedition, an additional
time marker is available for the Carpenter Site late component

graves¯ Some form of marker must have been present such as depressions in the ground or small mounds marking their locations.
Wooden markers or piles of brush may have been employed. No
grave markers of any sort were found at the Carpenter Site. Therefore, markings, if present, must have been with material that eventually deteriorated. One grave at the Johns Site had a post m01d
near the right shoulder region of the person interred¯ Whether this
represented a marker or part of a structure unrelated to the gr~ve
is unknown at this time.
/
The time period between the early and late componenfs at
the Carpenter Site had to be long enough for the popularity of
the pendant triangle rim design to reach full flower and fdr the
Talco arrow point to become the most popular type. Jusi how
long this time period would be in years is impossible to sa) with
any accuracy. Based on what few clues are available it is
estimated that the early graves preceded the late component
graves by no more than 50 years, and probably less.

CONCLUSIONS
The Carpenter Site
1. The Carpenter cemetery is attributed to peoples of th~ Titus
Focus.
/
2. The graves were placed during two different time/periods
with an unknown member of years separating these ~eriods.
3. The individuals had been placed in the graves in a supine
position with head to east and feet to west. The position of
the setting sun may have been the determining factor in
grave alignment.
4. If the "chalice"-like vessel of Crave 33 was engendered by
stemmed vessels of the De Soto expedil
- ..
ponent graves would probably date ~i~om near A.D. 1542. i~:((
5. Perdiz and Bassett arrow points we~e placed in the~-efffiiest ~\~
grav,
points coming later in time, and Talco )

last. The stemmed points were not abandoned bu~U
continued into the latest period.
6. Carinated bowls with a pendantifriangle decg~tiv’e motff’-~
were popular during the time pCrio~f~o~th~te component ~)
graves. This style had apparently not yet developed during’
the time period of the early graves.

7. Male and female graves both contained arrow points. Male
graves usually contained larger quantities however.
8. Wilder Engraved bottles continued as a popular type from
the early to the late component period.
9. Classic Ripley Engraved bottles were popular in the early
period but were not present in late component graves.
10. Deer mandibles and potters clay were almost exclusively
associated with female graves, pipes and evidence of fire
with male burials.
11. Graves containing two individuals were present among the
early component graves.
12. Ear ornaments, though not common, were present in male
graves more frequently than in female burials. More were in
the late component graves than in the earlier.
13. Copper was present in the form of a copper plate mounted
on one face of a sandstone earspool. Traces of copper were
present on fragments of wooden cymbal shaped ear or headdress pendants.
14. Trade vessels from the Texarkana and/or McCurtain foci
were present in several graves. A single vessel of Poynor
Engraved, or a replica thereof, indicates contact with Frankston Focus people.
15. Beamers of deer cannon bone, which have previously been
considered a Plains Indian trait, were present in one grave
in association with a gouge.
The Titus Focus
Conclusions concerning the Titus Focus are, for the Whelan
Complex, based primarily on the Harroun Site report (Jelks and
Tunnell 1959), the manuscript report on the Whelan Site (Davis
1958), and the summary of the Whelan Complex by Davis (1970).
For the cemeteries: field notes, artifacts, or published reports
concerning each site have been studied.
1. The time span of the Titus Focus encompassed at least part
of both the Caddo III and IV periods.
2. The earliest presently known sites which may be included in
the Titus Focus, or as directly ancestral to it, are those of
the Whelan Complex of the Caddo III period.

3. Principal overlap of radiocarbon dates for the Whelan
complex sites was between A.D. 1450 and 1550 and possibly
1650. Based on the probable date of the late component
graves at the Carpenter Site (1540’s), the author believes the
Whelan Complex sites could not be as late as A.D. 1550.
4. Whelan Complex and other early Titus Focus sites contained
sherds or vessels of Pease Brushed Incised pottery, a type
associated with the Bossier and Haley foci. This vessel type
disappeared as a recognizable type in later sites.
5. One or more of the Whelan Complex type sites contained
sherds of Titus Focus pottery types: Maydelle Incised, La
Rue Neck Banded, Bullard Brushed, Ripley Engraved, and
Taylor Engraved. Titus Focus vessel types not identified in
the Whelan Complex type sites which were present in later
sites were Wilder Engraved, Cass Applique, and Bailey
Engraved.
6. The trait of erecting mounds over burned structures, as in
the Whelan Complex, may have persisted into later Titus
Focus times; this has not yet been demonstrated by archeological evidence.
7. During the time span of the Titus Focus, arrow point types
changed. During the Whelan Complex period, types included
only stemmed forms: Alba, Bonham, Hayes, Perdiz, and a
bifurcate-stem type. Following these came Perdiz and Bassett
with occasional Maud points. Triangular point types, Maud
and Talco, then increased in popularity as Perdiz disappeared. In the last period, Bassett and Maud decreased in
popularity as Talco emerged as by far the predominant type.
8. Titus Focus burials in Northeast Texas were with the individual supine, head to east, and feet to west with most
graves oriented south of west and within the range of
seasonal variation in the point of sunset.
9. Graves usually contained only one person. At only two sites,
Ford and Carpenter, were graves present with other than
one person. Graves containing two individuals were present
at these sites; two graves at Carpenter and one at Ford.
10. The Titus Focus people left northeast Texas before goods of
European manufacture reached the area. Through native
trade, easily carried material such as iron knives and glass
beads could have been expected to reach the region by the
early 1600’s (Suhm, et al. 1954: 218).

II. The presence of Titus related people in the Toledo Bend
area is the first archeological evidence of a dispersal pattern of those from northeast Texas.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The property where t)3e site was located was owned by the late
Mrs. Tuck Carpenter and was administered by her niece, Mrs. Alice
Parker. During the time of the excavations, the land was leased to Mr.
Oren Reeves. Permission granted by these individuals to conduct these
excavations is gratefully acknowledged.
Several people allowed study of their collections. Among these are
Mr. Ralph Nicholas of Daingerfield, Mrs. Mavis German of Lone Star,
and Mrs. Roy Keeling of Upshur County.
The author is indebted to the following people for their help and
advice. Mr. T. W. (Tommy) Johns loaned many of his artifcts for study
and photographing and provided accurate and up-to-date information
on the Johns Site (41 CP 12). Dr. Clarence H. Webb of Shreveport,
Louisiana, provided unpublished information concerning the Belcher
and Gahagan Sites. Dr. Dee Arm Story suggested methods of data
presentation, provided information regarding various sites and made
the records and collections of the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory available for study. Dr. E. Mort Davis of The University of
Texas at Austin loaned out-of-print reports to the author. In addition,
through his good office, he arranged for the radiocarbon dating of the
sample from Grave 10 and for the sex determination, by Duncan
Wilson, of the skeletal material from the site. Dr. E. B. Jelks loaned a
copy of his doctoral dissertation, which provided the information on the
Sam Rayburn Reservoir area and the Angelina Focus. Norma Hoffrichter conducted both library and museum searches for me at
Southern Methodist University and at the University of Arkansas.
Mr. R, W. (Bob) Walsh, my colleague, was responsible for more
than his share of the approximately 125 tons of earth removed by
shovel and trowel during the excavations. Furthermore, he loaned his
artifacts for drawing and study and was responsible for much of the
photography and most of the preparation of the enlargements for the
pictures. Without his continuous help and support, this report would be
lacking.
I wish to thank my daughter Nancy who spent many hours during
her vacation, and after returning to school, editing and typing the
original manuscript.
Finally, I especially wish to thank my wife Gloria for her patience
during four years of pottery washing and reconstruction in the kitchen
and breakfast room and an additional five years of drawings and
drawing instruments, artifacts, strip charts, graphs, maps, reference
materials, and notes scattered about the house, Without her understanding, this report could never have been prepared.
