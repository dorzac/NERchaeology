PREFACE

In 1978, Robert L. Turner, Jr., published "The Tuck Carpenter Site and Its
Relation to Other Sites Within the Titus Focus" in Volume 49 of the Bulletin of the
Texas Archeological Society. This useful article reported the excavations by Turner
and R. W. Walsh of a substantial late prehistoric Caddoan cemetery in Camp County,
Texas. As Turner noted in his paper on the Carpenter site, many "Titus Focus"
cemeteries have been excavated by amateur and professional archeologists over the
years; but as of 1978, only one small cemetery had been analyzed and the data
published. To quote Turner (1978). "As there is undoubtedly an end to these
cemeteries, it is the intent of the author that a major cemetery of the Titus Focus
people be reported. This paper is written to fulfill that purpose." J. Peter
Thurmond's studies of cemeteries in the Cypress Creek drainage of northeast Texas
are the only significant Titus Phase (as per current terminology) mortuary analyses in
the 14 years that have passed since 1978 (Thurmond 1983, 1990).
It is my opinion that Turner's article on the Tuck Carpenter Site stands as one of
the three best analyses of substantial Caddoan cemeteries in Texas, the others being
Dee Ann Story's analysis of the Mound C interments at the George C. Davis Site
(Story 1972) and Carolyn Good's analysis of the interments at the Deshazo Site
(Good 1982). Bob Turner obviously devoted a great deal of effort to describing the
site, the graves, and the recovered materials. Indeed, he took the additional steps of
exploring patterning among the graves in terms of location within the cemetery, age
and sex of the individual, as well as kind and number of offerings, a thorough analysis
with comparatively few equals in Caddoan archeology. Turner's comprehensive re­
search enabled him to place the site in a local and regional framework in a way that
greatly enhanced his analysis. In short, the report of the Tuck Carpenter Site was an
exemplary compilation and analysis that significantly improved our understanding of
Caddoan prehistory in northeast Texas. I should note here that Thurmond included
the Tuck Carpenter Site in his analyses and, in part, offered an alternate interpreta­
tion of the differences between the two groups of graves recognized by Turner
(Thurmond 1983, 1990).
Due to space limitations, only four of Turner's excellent plan and profile drawings
of each grave could be published in the paper in the 1978 Bulletin. We are glad to be
able to publish in this volume the whole set of drawings since they present detailed
information on the location of offerings in relation to the body of the deceased. Such
information, along with the descriptions of the graves and recovered artifacts, com­
prise the corpus of data on a site that archeologists should always rank first in
publication priority so it can be analyzed time and time again.
It is with pride, therefore, that the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
publishes here all of Turner's drawings of the graves at the Tuck Carpenter Site. With

Vl

the very kind permission of the Texas Archeological Society, an adaptation of the
original introductory text and grave descriptions from the 1978 article accompany
these drawings. In addition, the appendix in this volume presents the previously
unpublished results of a physical anthropological analysis of the human skeletal
remains conducted by Barbara Jackson at TARL in 1985. Researchers should consult
both sources because in some cases Jackson's sex identifications differ from those
reported in the 1978 paper. Together, this publication and the 1978 article from the
Bulletin will make readily available the important information from the Tuck Car­
penter Site.

PREHISTORIC MORTUARY REMAINS AT
THE TUCK CARPENTER SITE, CAMP COUNTY, TEXAS
Robert L. Turner,

fr.

INTRODUCTION

"The Tuck Carpenter Site And Its Relation to Other Sites Within the Titus Focus",
by Robert L. Turner, Jr., was published in Volume 49, of the Bulletin of the Texas
Archeological Society (Turner 1978). This site was a cemetery of the Titus Focus
people.
In the published report the contents of each of the 44 graves excavated were
listed, but because of space limitations the drawings of only four graves were in­
cluded. The purpose of this publication is to provide the drawings of all of the graves
of the Carpenter Site cemetery and to provide enough description so that a reader
unfamiliar with the 1978 article can place the cemetery in the proper context.
THE CEMETERY

The Tuck Carpenter site is located in Camp County in northeast Texas. The
county seat, Pittsburg, is noted by the black spot beneath the words "Titus Focus" in
Figure 1. Camp County is well within the Caddoan area of Texas as Figure 1 shows.
Figure 2 is a map of the cemetery which shows the relation of the various graves.
The dashed outlines on the map indicate excavations by parties unknown. The graves
are numbered 1 through 45 in the order they were excavated. There is no Grave 28;
what was originally thought to be Grave 28 turned out to be a major fragment of a
simple vessel at 19 inches below surface elevation.
The site was excavated between May 1963 and October 1967 by R. W. Walsh and
the author. The following paragraphs and the section on Early and Late Component
Graves have been extracted larely verbatim from Turner's 1978 article; but with some
reorganization to facilitate this presentation and minor changes to condense larger
grave descriptions to a single page.
A radiocarbon date, Tx-666, from charcoal associated with Grave 10 yielded a
date of A. D. 1590 + /-60 years. Based on the presence of a stemmed, Caddoan­
produced chalice or goblet from Grave 33, the author believes the cemetery's
terminal date may be a few years after the DeSoto expedition (led by Moscoso)
entered Texas in 1542.

EARLYAND LATE COMPONENT GRAVES /3

EARLY AND LATE COMPONENT GRAVES

An analysis of the artifacts from the cemetery indicated the graves were placed at
two different time periods. Thirty-five of the graves were assigned to the early
component or period, nine to the latter. The late component graves were numbered
1,3, 10, 19,31,32,33,34, and 36.
The major difference between the graves of the two components was the presence
in the late component graves of the Ripley Engraved carinated bowls with a distinc­
tive decorative motif. This motif, which was widespread during the Titus Focus, was
characterized by small pendant triangles attached just below the lip and similarly
sized upright triangles at the shoulder of the bowl. Four panels encircled the rim.
In addition to the vessels with the pendant triangle motif, seven of the nine graves
contained Talco arrow points. Only two of the 35 graves assigned to the early
component contained these points. The two late component graves which did not
contain Talco points contained Maud points. Thus, all late component graves had
triangular arrow points as offerings.
A third distinguishing feature of the late component graves was their location
within the cemetery. All were on the outer fringes which indicates their later arrival
on the scene.
Five early component graves contained triangular arrow points but did not in­
clude bowls with the pendant triangle motif. Graves 20 and 25 contained Talco points
and Graves 2, 23, and 44 Maud specimens. Like the late component graves, four of
these five were located on the outer edges of the cemetery. The one exception was
Grave 23 which had one other grave between it and the outside edge.
These five graves showed a closer relationship to the late component graves than
do the others at the site. They were related through the triangular point forms and
their peripheral position within the cemetery.
The arrow points, from the interior graves which contained points, were of the
stemmed varieties, Bassett and Perdiz. These graves and those among them which
did not contain points were the oldest graves at the site. Bassett and a very few Perdiz
points were also in some of the late component graves along with the triangular point
types.
In many of the early component graves, a majority of the carinated bowls featured
a triangular motif. In this design one to three vertical lines extended from the
shoulder to the lip at the end of each design unit. A diagonal line connected one
group of vertical lines to the next. The triangular space above and below the diagonal
was filled with a smaller triangle that usually contained a semicircle or other simple
shape set off by engraved bands or excised areas. This design repeated four to eight

times around the rim. These vessels, too, were classified as Ripley Engraved, but with
a motif that preceded the pendant triangle in time.
Eight of the nine late component graves contained bottles of Wilder Engraved.
The ninth, Grave 3, contained a small bottle with a simple untyped design. None of
the late graves contained the classic Ripley Engraved bottles of the early component.
It was concluded that at this site, the Wilder Engraved bottle design survived from
the earlier component to the late component, but the classic Ripley Engraved bottle
design did not.
GRAVE DRAWINGS AND DESCRIPTIONS

At the top of each figure is a plan view, or view looking down into the burial. At
the bottom of each figure is a side view, which shows the depth from the present
ground surface to the skeleton and each artifact. The scale which shows depth is
applicable to all distances and dimensions in both the plan and side views of each
figure. Numbers were assigned to each pot as seen in the plan view. Letters were
assigned to other types of artifacts, groups of artifacts, or special features.
Various artistic liberties have been taken to provide a clearer picture for the
reader. First, the outline of the grave (in both views) is shown outside and below the
artifacts and skeleton. Actually, the skeleton and many of the artifacts were resting
on the floor of the grave. Also, in the plan view, vessels on the sides and ends of the
grave were usually against the walls. Generally, the grave was no longer than neces­
sary to accommodate the skeleton and artifacts shown.
The position of each vessel or artifact in the plan view shown in Figures 3-46 was
accurately drawn to within an inch or so. Side view sketches are not as precise. To
establish the relative positions between the artifacts and the skeleton in each grave,
triangulation was employed. Two stakes were placed at the surface beside the grave
in an east-west line by compass heading and at a measured distance apart, usually five
feet. Using a steel tape and plumb line, the horizontal distance of each artifact from
each stake was measured and recorded. The field notes for each grave included a
sketch that noted the position on each artifact where the measurements were made,
i.e., center of base, junction of neck and body, etc. In addition, the depth from the
surface to the uppermost portion of each artifact was recorded. The inclination of
each vessel with respect to the vertical and its direction of tilt was estimated,
sketched, and recorded. Based on the field sketch, notes, measurements, and the
artifacts after reconstruction, the grave drawings were completed.
The sketches show the vessels as unbroken, except for instances when incomplete
vessels were placed in the graves. Actually, about 55% of the vessels were broken to
some degree. This occurred most often when the grave floor was on, or into, the clay.
The clay provided no cushion, but rather a fixed platform against which the vessels
were crushed by the grave fill. When sand extended below the grave floor, vessel

6/ TUCK CARPENTER SITE

breakage was minimal. It is the author's opinion, based on the above observation,
that the broken vessels were a result of crushing and not of deliberate breaking or
"killing,"
The direction of each skeleton with respect to west is indicated beside the plan
view of each grave drawing. The cardinal points, north and west, are true and not
magnetic compass headings.
In each grave the approximate quantity of skeletal material that was found is
shown in the drawing. The amount varied from none, as in Grave 1, to almost
complete preservation, as in Grave 18.

Noteworthy features of this grave are placement of the rock between the teeth, the presence of
beamers, and the gouge in association with the beamers. Beamers have been reported from the Clark
Site near Waco by Watt (1965), the Pecan Spring Site near Ennis by Sorrow (1966), and from the Sanders
Site on Red River by Krieger (1946). These locations are closer to the Carpenter Site than any other
sites where beamers have been reported. The beamers and gouge are pictured in Turner (1978 Fig. 10).

sandstone; unworked stone of ferruginous sandstone; three hematite fragments; flakes
and chips; petrified wood fragment; red stain; green pigment; charcoal under blade (mid­
point of blade to wrist); fragments of two deer ulna.
B, Red pigment in large rim sherd from Ripley Engraved carinated bowl; small lumps of
green pigment in Vessel 10.
C, 25 arrowpoints: 10 Talco with eared base; one Maud point; 11 Bassett points; two Perdiz
points; and one untyped point of grey flint. Four stemmed points near Vessel 11 did not
have a consistent orientation, nor did the eight points by the right knee. One point by the
right ankle was disturbed, and its direction was not noted. However, the remaining points
were oriented as shown, indicating former attachment to arrow shafts. A single point was
located in the pelvic area.
Remarks:
The cache at "A" included three items which indicated this cache may include an arrow point­
making kit. These items are the deer ulna fragments, the flakes, and the petrified wood piece.
Artifacts from a grave cache at the Alex Justiss Sitc which probably included such a kit were the
following: 1/2 lb. hematite stone, scraped all over, apparently to manufacture red paint; 10 deer ulnae;
15 pieces petrified wood, 1-4" long; 10-20 flakes; two dart points (nondescript, may represent an
additional flint supply); six small Talco points; 2-8" long bones, 1/2" in diameter (probably deer); 5/8"
length of tooth enamel (beaver?). Artifacts pictured in Fundaburk and Foreman (1957: PI. 66) and
described as a Caddo flintworkillg kit contained two arrow points; nine bone points; 16 antler tines; 10
ulnae; two bone pins; one twisted bone; one beaver tooth; one novaculite chip; and three jasper pebbles.

Grave 19 was that of an important person as indicated by its depth and the quantity of grave
offerings. It was probably that of a male. The large blade of the cache is an unusual artifact for a Titus
Focus grave. The only similar artifacts known to the author from a Titus Focus cemetery were from the
Galt Site. Grave 2 of the Galt Cemetery yielded two large ceremonial blades, both in excess of 14" in
length. The blade from Grave 19 is off-white in color, resulting from a uniform layer of patination. A
small flake shows a grey color beneath its outer layer. The darker color probably represents the original
coloration of the flint.

D, Celt
E,1\vo kaolin lumps in sherd
F, Green pigment in major fragment of small Ripley Engraved carinated bowl with scroll

Remarks:
This grave is particularly unusual because it was a double burial; that is, two individuals were buried
simultaneously in the same grave. The individual to the north was probably male and the other, female.
Grave 23 was also a double buriaL Of 391 Titus Focus graves from 32 different sites, the only other
double burial was Grave X-8 at the Ford Site.
Of the 17 vessels in Grave 21, four seemed to be associated with the skeleton to the north and the
remaining 13 with the one to the south. All arrow points were associated with the northern skeleton.
Vessel 3 contained a number of bone fragments about the size of those that would come from a deer
though they are not positively identified as such. In order to get the drawing on the page, both Vessels
1 and 17 were moved inward 9". True distance across the grave to encompass these vessels would be
about 10.5'. Vessel 15 was inside Vessel 2 as shown. The grave floor was dug into the clay about 6".

Remarks:
This grave was the second double burial at the Carpenter Site. The grave was dug very slightly into
the clay. Extremely few bone pieces remained. The skulls were crushed against the clay floor. Arrow
points were associated with both skeletons. Point groups D, E, and G were aligned as if they had
formerly been attached to arrow shafts. Group F was not.
Vessel 9 is quite similar to bottles described by Skinner, et al. (1969:42,44) which were found in the
shaft and multiple burials at the Sam Kaufman Site (McCurtain Focus component) in Red River County.
Six of the seven bottles described were polished red-slipped vessels with the marks of the polishing stone
still remaining. One vessel was not red-slipped. Five of the vessels were decorated at the base of the
neck with a distinctive four point diamond applique. The Kaufman bottles were quite large. The mean
diameter and height were 27 and 33 cm., respectively. Their paste contained shell temper and a grey
core. Vessel 9 is not as large as the Kaufman vessels nor does it contain shell remper. It does have the
grey core, smoothing-stone marks, a red slip, and a diamond applique about the neck. The Carpenter
vessel does have a slight shoulder where the neck intersects the body that is not on the Kaufman bottles.
The applique found on both the Kaufman and Carpenter bottles is a raised, smooth area above the body
contour. The Kaufman bottle type described above, as well as a deep carinated bowl type with red slip,
incurving rim, and a slightly scalloped lip were not given a type name in the Kaufman report. Skinner
has since designated this type as Avery Red. Vessel 9 of Grave 23 is identified as this type.

D, Cache - A small jar, Vessel 3, contained green pigment and was resting on tan potters' clay

and a ferruginous sandstone smoothing stone, polished on the convex portion. One human
tooth was close to Vessel 3. The human mandible fragment was close by at A. TWo extremdy
worn molars were in the mandible. Whether the mandible, skull, and pelvis fragments were
accidental inclusions in the fill or purposely placed is unknown. If an earlier grave was di
turbed when this one was dug, some post cranial bones should also have been present The
closeness of the skull and pelvis fragments suggest deliberate placement.
F, Conch columella bead found in dirt stuck to skull after removal from grave
Remarks:
The effigy vessel is a unique form at the Carpenter Site and in other Titus Focus sites. The vessel
is hollow within the head region; the wall thickness is no greater there than in the bowl proper. Two
suspension holes are on opposite sides of the opening. Engraving consists of a single line around the
opening, three horizontally oriented, crosshatched diamonds on each side, and hook elements similar to
that of Wilder Engraved on the upper surface of the tail. The only similar vessel to this, known to the
author, is pictured in Suhm, ct al. (1954: 279) and seems to represent a frog. Similarities between the
two vessels are the hollow head, two nodes which may represent eyes, crosshatching of design elements
(though the elements are different), suspension holes similarly placed, and overall similarity of form.
The vessel has the tail missing, but from the break, it can be determined that it also had a very broad tail.
It was found in Red River County and was described as belonging to either the Texarkana or McCurtain
Focus.
Vessel 14 probably represents a human head in very abstract form. The nose has nostrils clearly
indicated. A smal1 engraved line in the expected position probably represents the mouth. No eyes are
apparent other than the two nodes. Because of the similarity of the vessels, it is probable that Vessel 14
is a trade piece from McCurtain or Texarkana Focus people.

D, Ceramic earspools, inner surfaces most highly polished
E, Burned area, some charcoal pieces, several rib fragments imbedded in the matrix
F, Vessel 10 fragment was filled to the rim with the local red clay
Remarks:
This grave was dug into the clay an average depth of about 18". Because of the' clay floor, most
vessels were badly crushed. The burned area beneath the upper body probably was the result of a fire
built on the grave floor prior to body placement.
The cache at position "A" was beside the grave, not in the fill. This may have been an additional
offering or may have had no relation to the grave at all. There were no similar caches or tools associated
with the other graves at the Carpenter Site.

B, 13 Talco points: one by right shoulder; one inside Vessel 4 beside slight red stain; 11, 5" to
6" above right forearm. Points range in size from 16 to 28 mm. in length. The points above
the forearm varied in direction.
C, Ceramic earspools
D, Red pigment in Vessel 9.
Remarks:
This grave was completely in sand. Vessel 6 resembles a bottle resting inside a bowl. This technique
is rare but does occur infrequently in the Titus Focus.
The grave floor was slanted downward approximately parallel to the surface. The head was the
lowest skeletal part. Vessels 3, 4, and 5 were at higher elevations than the skeleton. This might mean
they were placed in the grave after the filling had started. Or it could have represented their placement
on a shelf in the side of the grave which collapsed inward as settling occurred.

B, One Talco point
C, Mussel valve
Remarks:
This grave was against a sand-clay layer but into it slightly at thc foot of the grave. Four teeth from
the skull were spread over six inches. This probably results from a normal disintegration and collapsing
of the facial structure. The most unusual feature of Grave 33 is the stemmed vessel, Vessel 9.

1, Wilder Engraved

A, Seven Talco points located as shown in sketch
B, Sandstone earspool with copper plate
Remarks:
The grave floor was in the clay 1" to 2", An extremely unusual feature of this grave was the position
of the two Talco points at the skull. One is resting at about the position of the right eye, and the other
appears to be protruding, point first, from the left side of the skull. On the side of the cranium opposite
the protruding point is a hole which could have been caused by the penetration of an arrow. However,
since the bone had disintegrated at both point locations, there is no absolute evidence that this actually
occurred.
The two points are at a higher elevation than the skull. Both were pointing downward at an angle,
as was the point near the left knee. The overall impression was that after the body was placed in the
grave, arrows were shot at or near it. If such were the case, the two points would probably have been
shot after the grave filling had commenced since they were at a higher elevation than the body.

Remarks:
The shape of the lip of Vessels 2, 5, and 6 is different from all other carinated bowls at the Carpenter
Site. The lips were rolled out and down but were not smoothed or blended into the rim. Vessel 6 is a
lighter shade than most at this site. It is yellow-brown with fire mottling present on the rim. This
coloration is typical of Poynor Engraved. The rim of Vessel 6 is slightly inverted, another characteristic
of Poynor Engraved. The rim design incorporates Poynor elements as well.
The grave was completely in sand.

Remarks:
This grave was unusual because of the depression in the grave floor in which the legs and three
vessels were located. This might have resulted when those digging the grave decided they had gone too
deep, so did not dig as deeply on the other end. On the other hand, there might have been some
significance to the arrangement.
The wooden ear ornaments were extremely unusual. No other wooden artifacts were found in any
of the Carpenter Site graves. This is the only known occurrence of artifacts of this type in the Titus
Focus.

C, Red clay smeared at several places on the body interior, approximately 1/4 lb.of red clay

Remarks:
Several vessels in this grave are different in style and decorative technique from most others at the
site. For example, compound Vessels 1, 2, and 10 are not turned as radically at the shoulder as most
other vessels of this type. The design on Vessel 1 features crosshatching and ladder-like elements in
semicircular form which are similar to Avery Engraved. The triangular motif on Vessels 2 and 10 are
similar in concept to others at the site. This may simply represent one potter's slight deviation from the
norm.
Vessels 2 and 11 were higher than the grave floor. These vessels may have been on a platform or
shelf at the end of the grave. However, no positive variation in the soil composition was determined.
The alternative, of course, would be that these were placed in the grave after filling had started.
The only skeletal remains were teeth fragments.

98/ TUCK CARPENTER SITE

APPENDIX

In the mid 1980s with grant funding from the National Science Foundation, the
human skeletal remains curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) were reorganized and reinventoried. During that process, all skeletal
remains were examined by physical anthropologist Barbara Jackson. One important
result of that effort was a modern assessment of the entire collection, including the
skeletal remains from the Tuck Carpenter Site. The detailed data from that analysis
are available at TARL, but here we present Jackson's age and sex data for each of the
Tuck Carpenter Site burials for which there are skeletal remains.
For Burials 4 and 34, Jackson identified two individuals from each grave rather
than the one reported by Turner (1978). In the case of Burial 23, TARL records do
not indicate which of the two individuals was on the north side of the grave and which
was on the south side. There are also three individuals at TARL that have no
recorded burial number at the Tuck Carpenter Site (Accessions 3067-3069); it is
likely that they are from three of the graves herein listed as having no bone at TARL.
The information on these three individuals is presented here for more general use in
demographic studies.
