ABSTRACT
An obsidian flake from site 41HX44 at the Medicine Mounds locality in
Hardeman County has been analyzed using precise x-ray fluorescence analysis.
The geologic source has been identified as Cerro del Medio, in the Jemez
Mountains some 650 km to the northwest. Studies of Pueblo-Plains trade networks suggest that this artifact may have reached Medicine Mounds ca. A.D.
1450-1750, perhaps through Apachean or Comanche groups.

A recent publication of the Texas Historical Commission (Kenmotsu et al.
1994) describes archeological and documentary research, along with oral interviews, designed to shed light on the importance of the "Medicine Mounds" of
Hardeman County. Located north of the Pease River in the Rolling Plains of
northern Texas, the "Medicine Mounds" are erosional remnants of the Permianage Blaine Formation, and stand out today as four distinct knolls in a flat prairie
setting. The research by the Texas Historical Commission staff has concluded
that these features were "once a sacred site for the Comanche" (Kenmotsu et al.
1994:3), an assessment based largely on interviews with local individuals, with
members of the Comanche tribe, and on an overall assessment of Comanche
belief systems.
During their archeological survey of the "Medicine Mounds," the Texas
Historical Commission team recorded 13 archeological sites, none of which
could be conclusively linked to the Comanche or any other historic tribe. Chipped
stone artifacts appeared to be mostly of Archaic and Late Prehistoric age.
However, at site 41HX44 (the Saddle Site), between "Big Mound" and
"Cedar Mound," a concentration of archeological remains was recorded (Figure
1). These include a possible rock cairn, a number of chert flakes and tools,
several quartzite and sandstone mano fragments, burned caliche fragments, and
two pieces of obsidian (Kenmotsu et al. 1994:73). The larger obsidian flake was
submitted to Hester by the Texas Historica! Commission for trace element

analysis at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. Analysis there was done by Frank
Asaro, Fred Stross, and Robert Giauque, using precise x-ray fluorescence
(PXRF), a technique recently described in detail by Giauque et al. (1993).
Analysis was part of the ongoing Texas Obsidian Project (TOP) and a specimen
number of TOP- 171 was assigned.

The artifact (Figure 2) is a medial section of a blade-like flake, pianoconvex in cross-section. Parts of the dorsal surface are opaque and are apparently
cortical remnants. It is translucent smoky-gray in color. Length of the fragment is
18.5 mm, maximum width is 19.5 mm, and maximum thickness, 8.5 ram.

With the use of PXRF, it has been possible to conclusively assign the
obsidian specimen to the Cerro del Medio source (Table 1), a well-known
obsidian outcrop in the Jemez Mountains 56 km north of Santa Fe, New Mexico.
As Table 1 indicates, the average deviation for eight of the most preciselymeasured trace elements is only 1.7 percent. This compares with the best analysis done by Asaro and Stross using neutron activation analysis. Thus, there is no
doubt of the attribution of this specimen to the Cerro del Medio source, approximately 650 km northwest of 41HX44.
Based on.studies reported in Hester (1993), Cerro del Medio is a fairly
common New Mexico obsidian in Texas, especially in the Panhandle region,
dating mostly to Late Prehistoric times. Additionally, Baugh and Nelson (1987)
suggest that the Jemez Mountain obsidians, including Cerro del Medio, were part
of a Pueblo-Plains exchange system (see also Spielmann 1983) dominant from
around A.D. 1450-1750. Our Texas research has shown that the Cerro Toledo
obsidian (or rhyolite), its source located very near the Cerro del Medio outcrop,
has a quite different distribution, found scattered widely across Texas and used
as early as the Archaic (e.g., the Late Archaic at Arenosa Shelter in the Lower
Pecos [Hester et al. 1991]).
It is impossible, of course, to link this piece of obsidian to an ethnic group.
However, it is conceivable that Apachean or even early Comanche groups

~Abundances and errors are given in ppm unless otherwise indicated after the
chemical symbol. Listed errors are counting errors for individual samples and the larger of
counting errors or standard deviations for groups of samples. When errors are not listed,
the counting errors or standard deviations are less than 1%, but the precisions may not be
that good. PXRF measurements were made with the computer program OBSID 26.
