Appendix 1: Laboratory and Numerical Methods of Sediment Analysis

LAB TECHNIQUES FOR GRAIN-SIZE ANALYSIS OF SEDIMENTS
The lab techniques employed for grain size analysis of the bench sediments were,
for the most part, the standard methods advocated by Folk (1980), employing dry sieving
for gravel and sand-sized fractions and pipette analysis of the fines (based on Stoke's Law
of settling velocity). However, the partially cemented nature of the sediments posed some
special difficulties, as did persistent sample loss during blender homogenization of the
fines. Some correction factors were introduced to try to counter these problems, and these
are discussed below. Laboratory methods for analysis of organic carbon content are
discussed elsewhere by Michael Marchbanks.
Because the sediments were partially cemented, they contain many carbonate
aggregates. These range in size from the large masses and tubular rhizoconcretions
discussed elsewhere in this report to small, irregular aggregates a millimeter or so across.
These latter were especially abundant and troublesome in the grain-size samples.
Ultimately, I devoted about four months to disaggregating and analyzing a series of
samples with what I considered to be acceptable precision. Sediment samples for grainsize analysis were removed from bulk matrix sample bags and therefore come from the
lower three centimeters of each five-centimeter level, in contrast to the organic carbon
samples, which were extracted from the pollen/phytolith samples and therefore come
from the one or two centimeters of fill above that; otherwise, the samples are comparable.
Grain-size samples were generally about 15 g of dry sediment. Two separate data forms
were used: a master data form to track various weights as well as the weights of pipette
1770

grades, and a separate form for dry sieving of the coarse fractions. Lab methods were as
follows:
1. About 15 g of dry sediment was extracted; snail shells, chert flakes, charcoal, or other
contaminants were picked out; the remaining sample was weighed on a triple beam
balance and the weight was recorded;
2. The sample was gently crushed with a rubber stopper (to avoid breaking sediment
grains);
3. The sample was placed in a sealed jar with dispersant solution and shaken for a while,
then allowed to stand from one to several days.
4. The settled sample was reshaken, then immediately washed with a squeeze bottle of
dispersant solution into a #230 sieve held over a 500 ml beaker; the coarse fraction
retained on the screen was then washed into another beaker with distilled water;
5. The pyrex beaker with coarse fraction was baked in an oven to drive off the water, then
allowed to cool to room temperature;
6. After adjusting to room temperature and humidity (which might take several days) the
coarse fraction was weighed, in the beaker, on an analytical balance and the weight
recorded;
7. The dry coarse fraction was saturated in 25% HCl until effervescence ceased (i.e., long
enough to disaggregate small diagenetically-cemented carbonate masses, but not long
enough to digest significantly any sand-sized carbonate clasts that might have been
present). The sample was then diluted and neutralized so that residual acid would not
alter the mesh size when the sample was rinsed on the #230 sieve;
8. The carbonate-free coarse fraction was rinsed with distilled water into a Pyrex beaker
and again baked to drive off water; after adjustment to room conditions, the sample
was weighed as before;
9. The difference in weights before and after the acid bath was taken as an approximation
of the carbonate loss from the coarse fraction. Actually, some fines are also liberated
as well by digestion of the carbonate masses, but these cannot practically be recovered
or measured because of acid contamination; this is simply taken as unavoidable error;
10. The carbonate-free coarse sediment was then sieved in nested, hand-tapped screens
for 30 minutes;
11. After sieving, some sediment passing the #230 sieve would inevitably be present; this
fraction was considered to be sufficiently acid-free to add to the beaker with the fines;
12. The coarse grade on each screen was collected and weighed separately and recorded;
13. Fines from the 500 ml beaker were washed with dispersant into a blender and
homogenized at high speed for 5 minute. Invariably some sample loss occurred in this
step, which had to be corrected mathematically as described below;
14. The blender contents were washed with enough dispersant into a labeled 1 liter
graduated cylinder to fill it exactly to the 1 liter mark; the cylinder was then allowed to
stand overnight;
15. Eleven 50 ml beakers were marked and preweighed to correspond to each cylinder;
16. The suspension in the graduated cylinder was stirred and then exactly 20 ml of
suspension for each beaker was withdrawn by pipette, as described by Folk, at timed
1771

intervals; when samples were occasionally missed, the sample was restirred and the
series repeated;
17. Samples were oven-dried, then allowed to adjust to ambient temperature and
humidity (this last factor proved to be critical), then weighed on an analytical balance.
In practice it proved advisable to let the samples stand uncovered in the balance room
for about three days before weighing;
18. Sample weights for the fines were checked for monotonically declining weights;
where violations were found, the series was repeated provided enough suspension
remained; if not, the entire sample procedure was repeated beginning at step 1.
Individual sieve fractions in the coarse grades were saved in labeled vials in case
any future microscopic studies should be contemplated. Baked mud samples, however,
were discarded.

COMPUTATIONAL TECHNIQUES AND SOURCES OF ERROR
Two main sources of potential error were encountered in the lab work. The first is
possible differential digestion of carbonate masses. The cessation of effervescence was
used as a timing standard, the assumption being that the carbonate in the sediment had
nearly neutralized the acid. Related to this problem is the fact that some fines are
inevitably trapped by the carbonate aggregates and are lost to the analysis when the
sample is rinsed. Since the acid goes with the lost fines, the difficulty of recovery was
considered to be too troublesome to justify the small increase in precision expected.
Carbonate loss from the coarse fraction was measured as a variable of interest in its own
right, and was also used as a correction factor to recompute the coarse grades, as
described below.

The other chief source of error lay in sample loss during blending. Eventually the
course of action chosen was to assume that enough homogenization occurred before
sample loss to justify treating the remainder as representative of the original sample.
1772

Enough sample weight was then added back in mathematically (using the cumulative
weight in the first pipette sample withdrawn as an estimator). The original weight of
sediment passing the #230 sieve was divided by the cumulative weight in the first pipette
grade to arrive at a correction factor for blender loss.

The final table of raw grade weights was keypunched in 1980 and used as input
for an SPSS program which simultaneously applied the correction factors mentioned as
recomputed the grade weights as percentages of the raw sample, so that sample-to-sample
variations in amount would not matter. This was done on the mainframe computer at the
Computation Center, University of Texas at Austin, but could as easily have been done
with a personal computer and spreadsheet program had such things been available in
1980. In 1986, the corrected data table was entered in a Lotus 1-2-3 worksheet in order to
produce the tables for this report.

The formulae used to produce the corrected data table are as follows:
1. [weight of raw sample] - [wt. of coarse fraction before acid]
2.

wt. of fines
cumulative wt. in pipette grade 1

= correction factor for blender loss

3. [wt. in each pipette grade] X [blender correction factor] = corrected pipette weights
4. [weight of raw sample] - [weight loss after acid] = sample weight minus carbonate
5. SAND GRADE PERCENTAGE =

sand grade
sample weight minus carbonate

6. SILT/CLAY GRADE PERCENTAGE =

corrected pipette weight
sample weight minus carbonate

1773

PHI TRANSFORMATION OF THE WENTWORTH GRADE SCALE
Measures of grain size used in this report are based on the phi (Ï) transformation
of the Wentworth metric grade scale. In the Wentworth scale each size grade is half the
size of the next coarser grade; for example, coarse sand falls in the range 1.0 to 0.5 mm in
diameter while very coarse sand is 2.0 to 1.0 mm in diameter. This scale is well-suited to
natural frequency distributions of particle sizes, which tend to be exponentially scaled
and to approximate a log-normal distribution. The derivation of the phi scale is given by
Krumbein (1978; original 1936) and is defined as
Ï = -log2X
where X is the grade limit in millimeters. This study uses grades measured at 0.5 phi
intervals. A concordance of the Wentworth and phi grades is given in Table 4.1.

NUMERICAL METHODS
Three statistics were computed for the grain size data. The mean grain size (M Ï,
the phi arithmetic mean) was used as a measure of central tendency, and the standard
deviation (sigma Ï) was used as a measure of dispersion or sorting. The standard
deviation (or more properly, the coefficient of variation, CV) is, of course, inversely
proportional to the degree of sorting (heterogeneous, poorly sorted sediments have large
coefficients of variation).

The computational method is essentially that of Folk (1980), which in turn is
closely similar to and based on the "method of moments" as advocated by Krumbein
(1978). The procedure is the same as that termed computation of the mean from grouped
1774

data by Blalock (1972:61 ff). This differs from more customary computational methods
in that it yields the average grade in phi units of a sample rather than the average
quantity of sediment in a grade, which would be of little interest.

The principal differences between the computational method of Folk and that
used here are that
1) the data used are percent in grade drawn from the data table corrected for carbonate
loss and blender loss rather than weight in grade. The percentages do not add up to 100%
as in Krumbein's (1978:Table II) example since varying amounts of the sample are
composed of clay grades finer than 9.0 phi for which we have no data.
2) the mean and standard deviation are only computed for grades up to 9.0 phi (i.e.,
coarser than .002 mm). No arbitrary "pan fraction" figure is used as was employed by
Folk (1980). The statistics computed here are, then, simply measures of that portion of
the sample for which we have grade-by-grade data.
The mean grain size is given as
M Ï = Î£ (f d)
Î£ (f)
where M Ï = mean grain size in phi units
Î£ = the sum of
f = the weight percent of sediment in a grade
d = the midpoint of a grade interval
The standard deviation is given as
Î£ Ï = SQR[ [Î£ [f(M Ï)2]] ]
Î£(f)
where Î£ Ï = standard deviation in phi units
SQR = square root
1775

The coefficient is given as
CV =

Î£Ï/MÏ

and is a dimensionless ratio in which the standard deviation is standardized by the mean,
so as to yield a measure of sorting which is not biased by the average grain size of the
sample.

Besides Krumbein (1978) and Folk (1980), the reader may wish to consult
McManus (1982) and Pierce and Graus (1981) on use of the phi scale and derivative
statistics.

Grain size statistics for samples discussed in this report were originally calculated
by hand in 1983, using a pocket calculator. In 1986 all the statistics were recalculated on
an IBM PC with a BASIC program (GRAIN) written specifically for this purpose. A
listing of the program is on file at the Center for Archaeological Research. Statistics
presented in this report are those calculated with the BASIC program.

Table A1.1 (following) lists the grain-size data for the bench and Lissie terrace
samples. The first 28 samples represent the composite grain-size column (three samples
from N109 E103, the remaining 25 from N110 E102). There are also two miscellaneous
samples from N109 E96, and a single sample from stratum 2E in the cutbank with all
grades analyzed (a second sample from stratum 2E was also analyzed, but only for gravel
and sand; it is not listed here).

Appendix 2: Laboratory Procedure for Determining Organic and
Carbonate Content of Sediment Samples

MICHAEL MARCHBANKS

SAMPLES SELECTED FOR ANALYSIS
Small sediment samples extracted from the phytolith/pollen sample columns in
N109 E103 and N110 E102 were used for this analysis. These were selected so as to
duplicate as nearly as possible the grain-size samples extracted from the matrix samples.
However, two samples at 91.85-91.80 m and 91.80-91.75 were unavailable for analysis,
and duplicate samples at the top of the column were unavailable for three levels, so three
samples at slightly different elevations were substituted. Except for these differences, the
grain-size and organic carbon/carbonate sample columns are comparable.
SAMPLE PREPARATION
Step 1: Visible rocks, snail shell fragments, and organic matter (roots and leaves) were
removed from the sediment sample.
Step 2: The sample was ground in a clean mortar and pestle and sifted through a 100
mesh screen. The ground sample was stored in a clean, labeled glass bottle.

1782

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE
Step 1: Initial weight. A single sheet of #42 filter paper was weighed on the analytical
balance and approximately one gram (1.0 g) of the sample was placed on it.
Combined weight of the paper and sample was determined.

Step 2: Carbonate removal. Approximately ten milliliters (10 ml) of one normal (1N) HCl
was added to the sample to remove carbonates. The HCl passed through the filter
paper and four five-milliliter rinses of distilled water were administered to remove
residual HCl.

Step 3: The sample was dried and left in a desiccator to cool to room temperature.
Step 4: A clean crucible was weighed. The sample was then transferred, with a camel hair
brush, into the crucible and the combined weight of the crucible and sample was
determined.
Step 5: Ashing. The soil sample was heated in a furnace at about 850Â° C for 1.5 hours to
burn out the finely divided organic matter. Samples were then placed in the
desiccator to cool.
Step 6: Final weight. Final weight of the ashed sample was determined by weighing the
cooled crucible and sample and subtracting the crucible weight. Color of the
ashed sample was also recorded.

1783

COMPUTATION AND REPLICABILITY
Three subsamples were run from each sample so that the results could be
averaged. In a few cases, some subsamples were ruined by laboratory mishaps so that
fewer than three subsamples were available. A computer program, termed ORG.BAS,
was written in BASIC to compute organic percentages from keyboard data entry, printing
both subsample percentages and averaged subsample percentages. In some cases a slight
film of sediment residue could not be removed from the filter paper, so a correction factor
(based on the difference between the clean and dirty paper weights) was built into the
program. The organic carbon content was initially computed as the weight loss after
ashing divided by the initial sample weight before acid treatment, but this method of
computation produced organic and carbonate curves with nearly perfect inverse
correlation. This should not be true, since carbonate entry is believed to be
postdepositional (diagenetic) and should be unrelated to original organic content of the
sediment. The program was later written so as to divide the weight loss after ashing by
the acid-rinsed, carbonate-free weight.

1784

Appendix 3: Magnetic Susceptibility Samples
ORIGIN OF THE SAMPLES
A total of 127 magnetic susceptibility samples was analyzed (Table A3.1). Ten of
these are from the upper deposits (strata 4 and 5) and the remaining 117 are from the
bench deposits. The 10 samples from the upper deposits (numbers 100-109) were
extracted from a series of sediment samples collected on April 17, 1981, by K. Brown
and J. DeCosta from the west wall of the abandoned blufftop excavation block, near the
southwest (N97 E96) corner. The original samples were about 2 cm or more thick, and of
variable width and depth. Magnetic susceptibility samples 100 and 109 correspond to
diatom samples 29 and 39, respectively.
With few exceptions, the samples from the bench sediments were extracted from
pollen\phytolith ("phytopol") samples, and therefore derive from the upper 2 cm of a 5
cm excavation level. Sample 42 came from a "phytopol" sample, but was extracted from
excess sediment returned by Rick Holloway after processing for pollen analysis. Sample
51 was extracted from a matrix sample ("CVS" sample) and therefore probably derives
from the lower 3 cm of the 92.70-92.65 m level. Samples 110 and 143A are from feature
fill. Samples 111, 145, 145A, 147A, 147B, 149A, and 149B are from special sediment
samples collected to investigate depositional units encountered in excavation. Samples
112-115 were extracted from bulk sediment samples of sand and gravel that were
collected (chiefly for grain-size analysis) from the cutbank exposure of stratum 2E. The
location is shown on Fig. 3.1 ("Stratum 2E sediment sample").

1785

SAMPLE EXTRACTION
Magnetic susceptibility samples consist of sediment packed in plastic cubes 2 x 2
cm square and either 1.8 cm or 2.4 cm high. Because I planned to archive these samples
in the cubes for other possible future studies, considerable care was taken to avoid sample
cross-contamination. Extraction tools were washed, first in tap water, then in
commercially produced distilled water after each sample extraction. Sample cubes were
weighed before and after packing, first on an electronic balance and then on a Mettler
analytical balance (to 0.00001 g). Most samples were passed through a coarse, 2.7 mm
nylon mesh before packing with a plastic tamper. Samples 49-81 were passed through a
number 6 geologic sieve (3.36 mm mesh) and tamped with iron tools. Large snail shell
fragments, rhizoconcretions, and chert or sandstone clasts retained on the sieve were
removed. Most analysts advocate using raw, unsieved sediment samples, but the
procedure used here prevents the chance inclusion of large clastic items that might
unduly influence the magnetic signature of the sediment.
SAMPLE MEASUREMENT
Samples were run in two batches, the first on April 24, 1996, and the second on
September 1, 1998 (Table A3.1), with only slight differences in procedure. The first
batch used 4-gram cubes holding about 7-8 g of sediment; the second batch used slightly
larger 6-gram cubes holding about 9.8 g of sediment. Measurements were done on a
Bartington MS2 system at the University of Texas Department of Geological Sciences.
Chi values are reported in Gaussian units, or cgs (centimeters/gram/second). The
measurement device has a resolution of 2 x 10E-7 cgs at low frequency. Four
determinations (two at low frequency and two again at high frequency) were run on each
sample. In the first batch, low frequency samples were run at 0.465 kHz for 1.2 seconds
1786

(0.1 sensitivity on the instrument), high frequency at 4.65 kHz for 12 seconds (1.0
sensitivity on the instrument). The second batch was run at a sensitivity of 1.0. The
measurement software automatically averages the two readings for each sample and
subtracts the background reading.
VALUES
Three values were computed for each sample:

Xlf = (low-freq reading * 7.36)/ sample wt in g

Xhf = (hi-freq reading * 7.36)/ sample wt in g

Xfd = ((Xlf - Xhf) * 100)/ Xlf
Xlf is the low-frequency chi value; Xhf is the high-frequency chi value. Xfd is the
coefficient of frequency determination, a measure of the extent to which changing the
measurement frequency changes the strength of the magnetic signal, and an indicator of
the presence of ultrafine grains of magnetic material (Dalan and Banerjee 1998:6; Gale
and Hoare 1991:207).

Chi values in SI (Systeme International) units can be converted to cgs units by the
formula
Xcgs = 4 n Xsi

Bulk matrix passing the 1/4-inch screen was collected from all levels in N109 E96 and later
sieved through fine mesh, but only a few levels have been picked for bones, snails, and chipping
debris. Of these, a preliminary snail inventory has been done for only three: 92.35-92.30 (stratum
2B), 92.15-92.10 and 92.05-92.00 (both stratum 2A). Note many Cincinnatia integra juveniles.

Appendix 6: Vertebrate Faunal Inventory
The following inventory represents vertebrate faunal remains identified to date
and includes all the bone found on the Â¼-inch screen and in situ. It is by no means a
complete inventory of animal bone from the bench deposits, however, because a
substantial amount of bone has been extracted from matrix samples but not yet identified,
and still more bone is known remain in matrix residue samples from N109 E96 that have
not yet been picked. See Chapter 10 for counts of bone fragments not yet identified, and
for explanation of identification and counting procedures.

Bones and bone fragments (numbering 3272 altogether) in this inventory are
listed by lot, grouped into two major divisions, the deposit associated with Feature 5 and
all the rest of the bone from the bench deposits. Individual lots list the total number of
fragments, regardless of whether breakage occurred before, during, or after excavation.
The two totals given for hearth-related and ambient material, however, are an estimate
of the number of fragments before post-excavation damage. Hence, fragments with
obvious recent

breakage representing specimens which broke during cleaning are

usually counted as one specimen. The summary totals given, therefore, are slightly
smaller than would be obtained by adding up the lot-by-lot counts and are probably a
more accurate estimate of the original number of bone fragments. This inventory is based
on one compiled by Boyce Cabaniss, later amended by Alisa Winkler, Bill McClure and
Ken Brown.

1.5 cm from distal end and is tentatively regarded as a butchering
mark made with a stone tool; appearance is different from marks
left elsewhere on surface during cleaning with a dental pick;
however, dirt and PVA obscure the scar.

PARTIALLY IDENTIFIED LOTS FROM N109 E96
Three lots of bone extracted from the coarse fraction of wet-sieved bulk matrix sample
from N109 E96 (passing the Â¼-inch screen) were sent to Bill McClure for identification
in 1989. These include both herpetofauna and non herpetofauna and are listed below;
completeness estimates were not done. Other lots of bone have been picked but not yet
identified, while still other samples have not yet been picked.
