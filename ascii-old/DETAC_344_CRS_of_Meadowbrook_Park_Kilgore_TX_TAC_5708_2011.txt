ABSTRACT
In July 2010 Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants (DETAC) conducted a cultural
resource management survey of the proposed modifications to Meadowbrook Park in
Kilgore, Texas. The improvements include building a trail around the perimeter of the
park and replacing existing goals with new portable goals for additional practice fields.
The cultural resources survey included a visual inspection of bare areas under trees and
shovel testing across the park under Texas Antiquities Permit #5708. A total of 46 shovel
tests across the property were all negative. No artifacts were collected. No further
investigations are recommended however, if any cultural material is recovered during
construction, than excavation should stop and a qualified archaeologist contacted to
evaluate the impact. DETAC is requesting concurrence with the determination of “no
effect” on NRHP eligible properties for the proposed project.

INTRODUCTION
In July 2010, Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants (DETAC) conducted a cultural
resources survey of the existing Meadowbrook Park in the City of Kilgore, Texas (Figure 1).
Cultural resource management was required because the park is administered by the City of
Kilgore and will undergo modifications. Texas Antiquities Permit #5780 was obtained and all
terms of the permit were carried out pursuant the Texas Antiquities Code and the National Historic
Preservation Act. The proposed project will develop the existing park by adding a trail around the
perimeter along with portable goals for additional practice fields.

The purpose of the survey was to locate, describe, and document cultural resources.

No

resources were recorded during the survey. The report was prepared using the short report
format outlined by the Council of Texas Archaeologists (CTA) (1995a) with additions suggested
by the Texas Historical Commission (Martin 1999).

DEFINITION OF THE STUDY AREA
The project area encompasses the perimeter of the 12 hectares (ha) (30 acres (ac) park. Boundaries
for the park area were defined by Houston St. to the south, Willow Spring Rd. to the east, and
Horseshoe Dr. to the west. The northern boundary is the edge of a wooded area not marked but
indicated on a map provided to DETAC at the time of the survey. Topographically, the project
area is limited to the Bighead Creek floodplain. No surveyor’s lathes or flagging tape were
visible on the ground for the park; however a map of parcel boundaries clearly indicated the park
boundaries.

PREVIOS INVESTIGATIONS AND CULTURAL HISTORY
Overall, Gregg County has been part of broad studies and investigated in both larger
examinations and numerous small surveys. The closest large-scale investigations to southern
Gregg County were conducted in nearby Rusk, Panola, and Harrison Counties. These
investigations were conducted primarily for the several strip mines under the Environmental
Protection Agency and Railroad Commission, e.g., Nash 1994 and Sherman 2001. Small-scale
surveys were conducted for several pipelines and road improvements throughout the area as
well, e.g., Drake 2000 and Perttula 2000.

In addition to the fieldwork referenced above, several documents have added significantly to
available information on the archaeological record in this region. The documents of primary
importance are D.A. Story's (1990) and J.A. Guy's (1990) discussions of the Gulf Coastal Plain.
Additionally, the Texas Historical Commission, Department of Antiquities Protection developed a
document for the eastern Texas portion of the Texas State Plan (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993).
This document includes several historic contexts, each of which deals with a particular facet of
northeast Texas prehistory. This plan serves to synthesize the current state of archaeological
research in the region and identify problems and objectives to be addressed in future research and
cultural resources management. Several weak areas in archaeological knowledge of the region are
identified in these studies. Cultural chronology, aboriginal settlement patterns and subsistence, and
historic continuities are some of the general research directions that these recent studies emphasize
as important for developing future archaeological research designs.

More recently, Perttula

(2004:370-407) describes the Caddoan archaeology of northeast Texas which encompasses the area
between the Red River in the north, the Trinity River in the west, and Angelina River in the south.

The occupation of the area ranges from the Paleoindian (ca. pre-7000 B.C.) to Archaic foraging
cultures (ca. 7000-200 B.C.), Early Ceramic Period groups (ca. 200 B.C. - A.D. 800), the
sedentary Caddoan occupation (A.D. 800 - 1680), and ends in the historic Euro American
settlement (Perttula and Kenmotsu 44:1993). The Paleo-Indian period (ca. 10,000-7000 B.C.) is
characterized by small, mobile bands of hunters and gatherers that consumed a variety of native
3

plants and animals (Story 1990). The Archaic (7000-200 B.C.) refers to hunter-gatherers who
implemented more regionally specialized approaches toward exploiting their environment (Story
1990). The Early Ceramic (200 B.C.-A.D. 800) stage, also referred to as the Woodland period,
represents an increasing utilization of the environment by local groups to include a greater
reliance on cultigens, prolonged occupations at specific locales indicating an increasingly
sedentary lifestyle, and the emergence of social and ritual ceremonies (Story 1990). The
prehistory of east Texas in the Late Prehistoric period essentially concerns the Caddoan culture
(A.D. 800-1600). This culture is an indigenous development strongly influenced by the
Mississippian tradition of the Lower Mississippi Valley (Story 1990). Larger aggregates of
people became sedentary and constructed villages with public ceremonial areas and cemeteries
found in association with large mounds. A stratified social structure developed, corresponding to
the chiefdom level as first defined by Service (1962, 1975). Extensive commercial networks
were also established.

The Historic period (1680-present) describes both the history behind the current cultural setting
of the area and marks a transition from the native populations domination of the area, to the
American immigrants establishment of farms, towns, and counties. The area that was to become
Kilgore was initially part of plantations and a growing timber industry. The city was not
founded until 1872 with arrival of the International-Great Northern Railroad (THA 2010) but
did not incorporate until 1931. Kilgore remained rural growing slowly but suffered during the
Great Depression. Kilgore’s population exploded in the 1930 with the discovery of oil but
stabilized with the end of the oil boom and the arrival of other industries. Today, the area
diverse with the addition of Kilgore College in 1935, agriculture, timber and other industries to
facilitate a still strong oil and gas exploration (Stallard 2010).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The investigations were preformed in compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act of
1966 (PL89-665), as amended in 1974, 1976, 1980, and 1992; the National Environmental Policy
Act of 1969 (PL91-190, 83 Stat. 915, 42 USC 4231, 1970); and the guidelines set forth by the CTA
(1995b), the Texas Antiquities Code, and the ethics standards of the Texas Archaeological Society
and the Society of Professional Archaeologists.

The program of site definition was conducted in accordance with the National Park Service
criteria (36 CFR, part 60.4) which present the guidelines for determining eligibility of a cultural
resource for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The objectives of
the survey were to locate prehistoric or historic cultural resources sites within the survey area. If
sites were found, then the investigations were to delineate the vertical and horizontal extent of
each site, determine each site’s integrity, and provide a preliminary evaluation of each site’s
potential for NRHP eligibility.

Before initiating fieldwork, DETAC conducted a records and literature review using the Texas
Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2010). The atlas contains an updated database with published and
unpublished data regarding cultural resource surveys, location maps, and cultural resources records
In addition, these records show State Archaeological Landmarks (SAL) and NRHP eligibility of
previously recorded sites.

DETAC conducted a 100 percent pedestrian survey of the area. To locate sites, the pedestrian
survey relied on shovel testing and visual examination of the project area. Shovel testing included
excavating an area approximately 30 cm in diameter in 10 cm (4 inch) levels down to the clay
substrate or 90 cm (35 inches). The excavated matrix was screened through a 0.635 cm (0.25
inch) wire mesh screen. Shovel tests were excavated at 60 m (196 ft) intervals where the
exposed subsurface was not visible and outside existing practice fields to avoid leaving
depressions which may cause injury to players. The depth of each shovel test was recorded and
notes about the soil type and color were made. Visual examination of the exposed subsurface
was a continuous effort between shovel tests. Exposed subsurfaces included cleared sewer pipe
easement, the profile along the drainage channel banks and other isolated areas.

RESULTS
The literature search and records review of the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (2010) revealed six
surveys within 5 km (3 miles) of the project area. These surveys include two by the Texas Water
Development Board in 1981 north and west of the project area along Rabbit and Bighead Creeks, a
survey for the FHWA in 1986 east of the project area, one by DETAC in 2002, one for private
development in 1992 along S.H. 349, and one by Corbin in 1977 for the initial 23 acres of
Meadowbrook Park (THC 2010). Of these surveys, only the FHWA survey in 1986 was successful
in documenting one site, 41RK162, as a historic homestead 4 km (2.5 miles) south of the project
area.

The closest site is 41RK80 recorded in 1975 by a private land owner. The site is located

along the Bighead Creek approximately 1.8 km (1.12 miles) to the south of the project area (Still
and Mayhew 1975). According to the site form, the land owner conducted an excavation in 1960’s
and the recovered materials were given to Dee Ann Story for cataloging. The site form does not
describe recovered materials but indicates the site as a Woodland affiliation.

The previous

investigation research found no evidenced of previously recorded sites in or near the project area.
The previously recorded sites were all found on sandy rises in the Rabbit Creek floodplain or on
prominent land forms overlooking the stream.

Given this information, and that the current

investigations focused on shovel testing in the flood plain, the chance of finding archaeological
sites in the project area is low.

The proposed park area encompasses Meadowbrook Park within the Big head creek flood plain .
The park is located north of Houston St. within the city limits of Kilgore (Figure 2).
Disturbances were noted in the initial visual inspection including straightening of Big Head
creek; three sewer line easements found along the western boundary of the project area and both
sides of Bighead Creek; and stockpiled material in the southeast corner of the project area.
Some erosion areas and areas void of grasses were noted throughout the project area. These
exposed surfaces were visually inspected for artifacts.

Topographically, the project area is divided into eastern and western portions by Bighead Creek,
and consists of the combined floodplain of Turkey and Bighead Creeks 750m south of their
confluence. Ridges with modern residences near the summits were noted on the eastern and
western edges of the Bighead flood plain. However, none of the toe slopes extended into the

current project area. Additionally, no elevated or mounded sandy rises within flood plain were
observed or discovered through shovel testing. Soil series within the project area was limited to
Mantachie loam (frequently flooded) (NRCS 2010). Mantachie soils consist of 20 cm (0-8 inches)
of loam over clay loam. This soil is typically found in flood plains and is formed in loamy
alluvium.

Vegetation consists of mowed grasses and interspersed hardwoods within the maintained park area.
A small unmaintained portion of the park was noted near the northern extent. This area was
largely overgrown and consists of mixed hardwoods with various vines shrubs and grasses.

Shovel testing in the park area confirmed the soil descriptions in the soil survey. A total of 46
shovel tests were excavated in the project area (Table 1). Shovel test depth in the project area
ranged from 10-50 cm in the floodplain. No cultural resources were found in the project area.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The project area will utilize the boundary and select areas within the existing Meadowbrook
Park in the Bighead Creek flood plain. A total of 46 shovel tests found soil 10 to 50 cm deep in
clay loam and clay over clay. No cultural materials were recovered from the shovel testing or
observed during the surface inspection.

In conclusion, the shovel testing and surface inspection did not recover cultural remains. Soils
were generally clay loam with shallow depth to clay. Based on the shovel test results and the
visual examination, there is little chance of encountering undiscovered cultural resources in the
project area. DETAC is requesting a concurrence with the determination of “no effect” on
NRHP eligible properties for the proposed park area as defined by the National Historic
Preservation Act.
