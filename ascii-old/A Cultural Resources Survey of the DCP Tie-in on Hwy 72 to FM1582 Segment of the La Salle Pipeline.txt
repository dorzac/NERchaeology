Abstract
Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, Ltd. of San Antonio, Texas contracted with Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations (TAAI) to conduct a cultural resources survey of a 11.2mile segment of the La Salle Pipeline to be installed in northwestern McMullen County, Texas.
The project was entirely privately funded, and the properties are privately owned; therefore, no
Texas Antiquities Permit was required.
A pedestrian survey with limited shovel testing of moderate and high probability areas along the
right-of-way was conducted by two archaeologists over two days in May, 2012. Approximately
98 percent of the pipeline right-of-way had been mechanically cleared and disturbed in the recent
past. Two newly discovered prehistoric open campsites (41MC677 and 41MC678) were
documented. These were assessed as heavily disturbed and non-significant.
As such, Tierras Antiguas recommended that the development of the pipeline be allowed to
proceed as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommended that if any additional,
undiscovered cultural resources are encountered during development, such finds should be
examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant.

Acknowledgments
There are mainly three individuals who are greatly appreciated, and whose efforts contributed to
the successful planning, organization, and completion of this project. They are Mr. David Black,
Ms. Judy Vader, and Mr. Ryan Debarros, Project Managers at Flatrock Engineering and
Environmental, Ltd. All were extremely amiable and helpful throughout, and their overall
knowledge of the project contributed significantly to our understanding of the project’s scope of
work.
In addition, I express my sincere gratitude to Tierras Antiguas staff archaeologist Belisario Silva,
who worked hard, long hours, and expressed an attitude and work ethic that ensured this survey
was conducted in a thorough and professional manner.

Introduction
Flatrock Engineering and
Environmental, Ltd., requested a
cultural resources survey of the 11.4mile DCP Tie-in to FM1582 Segment
of the TEAK La Salle McMullen
County, Texas (aka Bee Line), and
hereinafter occasionally referred to as
the Project Area (PA) (Figures 1 and
2). Tierras Antiguas Archaeological
Investigations (TAAI) conducted a
pedestrian survey of the pipeline rightof-way during two days in May 2012.

Modern Environmental
Setting
Climate and Vegetation
McMullen county is
located in south-central
Texas near its southern
border with Mexico (see
Figure 1). Its current
political boundaries
encompass 1,159 square
miles. The generally flat
to rolling terrain ranges
in elevation from about
150-450 feet above
mean sea level. Clayey
and loamy soils support
the growth of small
predominately mesquite
trees, and thorny scrub
brush with assorted cacti
and grassy understory.

With the semi-arid Figure 2. Location of the Project Area in McMullen County.
environment, the county
is generally frost-free
from mid-February through early December, allowing for about 290 growing season days. The
1

average annual rainfall is about 24
inches, with most rainfall occurring in
May and September. These peaks are
the result of thunderstorms bearing
moist air from the Gulf of Mexico to the
east, and the Pacific Ocean much farther
to the west. McMullen county is part of
what is known as the ‘Winter Garden
Region’ for the vegetables grown there
(Leffler 1996).
However, rainfall amounts vary
significantly from year to year, and the
high evapotranspiration effects in the
area effectively offset any beneficial
surplus of annual rainfall. This is
another reason irrigation systems are so
necessary, and commonly found in use
today throughout the area. Summers are
indeed hot and dry, with temperatures
consistently hovering above 1000F,
although humidity is generally low
compared to environments closer to the Figure 3. Physiographic regions of Texas
Gulf Coast. Overall, the climate can be (http://www.lib.utexas.edu/geo/pics/txphysio.jpg)
classified as subtropical steppe.
Hydrology
The Nueces River and the Rio Grande
are the major southeasterly trending
rivers draining the South Texas region.
A subtle divide through the county
causes numerous intermittent creeks to
flow south into the Nueces River, and
others to drain toward the north, and
into the Frio River. Many drainages
intermittently flow into both rivers
during infrequent seasonal periods of
abundant rainfall. Although there are
many springs in McMullen County, very
few are active due primarily to the dip
of the substrate shales which carry these
subterranean seeps to the south and
east. Ancient springs that may have Figure 4. Blair’s (1950) biotic provinces of Texas.
existed in the area at one time have likely
2

succumbed to overgrazing and irrigation pumping during modern times (Brune 1981).
Flora and Fauna
The Project Area lies within the South Texas Plain/Brush Country vegetation area as defined by
Gould (1975), and the regional flora of South Texas has been classified as being part of the
Tamaulipan biotic province extending out from northeast Mexico (Figures 3 and 4). This is the
only part of Texas where some vegetation exhibits growth throughout the year (Blair 1950; Map
2012). Thorny brush is the dominant vegetation today, but this is a relatively recent occurrence,
with a mix of woody and grassland species providing a savanna environment during prehistoric
times (Archer 1995; Black 1989; Hester 1980; Inglis 1964).
The original vegetation was an open grassland mixed with brushy chaparral. Oaks, pecan, and ash
were common along perennial streams. Due in part to overgrazing and the exclusion of fire, the
invasion of woody species has changed the vegetation into “Texas brush country” dominated by
mesquite, acacia, spiny hackberry, brazil, whitebrush, lotebrush, and others (Diamond et al.
1987:203-221). On sandy soils, the brush includes mesquite with mixed grasses. In contrast, clay
soils support mesquite (Proposis juliflora), various species of Acacia, and mimosa, granjeno or
desert hackberry (Celtis pallida), lignum vitae (Porliera angustifolia),lindheeimeri), tasajillo
(Opuntia leptocaulis), and species of Condalia and Castela (Blair 1950).
The South Texas Plains/Brush Country exhibits some of the greatest mammalian species diversity
in the state. Sixty-one species of mammals, 36 snakes, 19 lizards, and several species of turtles,
salamanders, and frogs are present in the region (Blair 1950). Approximately 50 species of fish
have been identified in the lower Rio Grande (Lee et al. 1980).

Paleoenvironment
The paleoenvironment of south Texas is as varied as the landscape, and the South Texas
Paleoclimatic record contains significant gaps primarily due to the scarcity of deep, finely
stratified, and well-dated deposits (Stahle and Cleaveland 1995:51). To date, the best record of
paleoenvironmental reconstruction in South Texas has been accomplished by Robinson (1982)
from analysis of phytoliths from three archaeological sites in Live Oak County. Overall, the data
there along with data from other sites in Texas suggest that the waning of the Pleistocene, or lateglacial period, marked a transition from a cooler, wetter environment to one that steadily grew
warmer and drier, and cenizo (Leucophyllum texanum), white brush (Aloysia texana), prickly
pear (Opuntia) more seasonal, with intermittent moist periods through about 6,000 years ago.
Most researchers then generally agree that the period between 6,000 and 3,000 years ago was
much warmer and drier than today. Since that time, intermittent moist and dry intervals have
occurred over the past 3,000 years.
It is unlikely that the climate has changed significantly in the past few thousand years in the area

3

that would significantly induce
vegetation changes. The greater
changes have been induced by
human intervention through the
clearing of wooded areas along
the river and streams for
construction purposes, pumping
more water for irrigation which
has lowered water tables, and
overgrazing by livestock.
Although there are still many
seeps, springs, and streams in
the area, they most probably
flowed with greater abundance
during wetter intervals than
exist at the present time,
providing an abundant resource
for prehistoric occupants.

Cultural Chronology
The Project Area lies within the
South Texas Archaeological
region as defined by Hester
(1980, 1995, 2004; Figure 6).
Refining a cultural chronology
for south Texas is problematic,
due to the compressed nature of
the archaeological record and
the scarcity of stratified sites
excavated within the region.
Hester
(1995:433)
acknowledges the paucity of
information that exists for south
Texas and as such offers only a
“general framework” for
prehistoric periods particular to
the region (Figure 6). All dates
are given as approximate years
before present (B.P.), i.e.,
before 1950.

Paleoindian (11,200 - 7950 B.P.)
This period is estimated at between ca.11,200–7950 B.P. in south Texas (Hester 1995). The
Paleoindian period began toward the close of the Pleistocene. Diagnostic artifacts of the early
Paleoindian interval include Clovis and Folsom projectile points. The wide distribution of Clovistype points across most of North America and even into Central America suggests a wide
dispersal and interaction of the people who made them. Other artifacts associated with the Clovis
culture include bifaces and prismatic blades, engraved stones, bone and ivory points, stone bolas,
ochre, and shaft straighteners. During the late Paleoindian interval, the first stemmed lanceolate
points, such as Angostura, Golondrina, St. Mary’s Hall, and Barber (among a few others) appear.
In general, the Paleoindian adaptation has been considered to be one of small bands of nomadic,
big-game hunters following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons,
bison, camel, and horse, across North America (Black 1989). More recently, emphasis has been
placed on the wide diversity of plants and animals used for subsistence by these early Americans,
such as turtles and tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons, although they undoubtedly
hunted the large animals as well (Collins 1995:381). Known Clovis sites include killsites, quarries,
caches, open campsites, ritual sites, and burials (Hester 1995:433–436). A Folsom interval
follows the Clovis. Folsom artifacts are fairly common in south Texas; however, no camp sites
or killsites have been found south of a large workshop, Pavo Real (41BX52), in Bexar County
(Hester 1995:434–435). Most Paleoindian finds in south Texas have consisted of surface lithic
scatters on upland terraces and ridges (Black 1989).
As the warming that marks the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene climates began to take
effect in Texas, prehistoric inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic shift is also
marked by the decline and extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant bison
(Bison antiquus). Large gregarious game animals were perhaps extinct in Texas. Human hunters
were forced to concentrate on deer, antelope, and other medium-size or smaller game. Changes
in the subsistence base required technological shifts that mark the beginning of a new cultural
period known as the Archaic.
Early Archaic (7950 - 4450 B.P.)
Hester (1995:436–438) identifies the Early Archaic, with Early Corner Notched and Early Basal
Notched dart points, as roughly dating between 7950 to 4450 B.P. The extinction of large herds
of megafauna and the changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene stimulated a behavioral
change by the Prehistoric inhabitants of south Texas (McKinney 1981). While the basic huntergatherer adaptation probably remained intact, an economic shift away from big game hunting was
necessary. In general, more intensive exploitation of local and smaller resources such as deer, fish,
and plant bulbs is indicated by greater densities of ground-stone artifacts, fire-cracked rock
cooking features, and more specialized tools. Weir (1976) speculates that Early Archaic groups
were small and highly mobile, an inference based on the fact that Early Archaic sites are thinly
distributed and that diagnostic projectile point types are seen across a wide area, including most
of Texas and northern Mexico. Story (1985) believes that population densities were low during
the Early Archaic, and that groups consisted of related individuals in small bands with “few
constraints on their mobility” (Story 1985:39). Their economy was based on the utilization of a
5

wide range of resources, especially such year-round resources as prickly pear and lechugilla, as
well as rodents, rabbits, and deer.
Middle Archaic (4450 - 2350 B.P.)
Hester (1995:438–441) suggests that the period between 4450 and 2350 B.P. reflects the Middle
Archaic in south Texas. The Middle Archaic appears to have been a time of increased population,
based on the large number of sites from this period (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125, 128). On the
South Texas Plains, exploitation of widely scattered, year-round resources such as prickly pear
continued (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13–15), as did hunting deer and rabbit. Weir (1976)
believes that the widely scattered bands prevalent in the Early Archaic now began to coalesce, at
least during the acorn-gathering season, into larger groups who shared the intensive work of
gathering and processing the acorn harvest (Weir 1976:126). Many researchers believe burned
rock middens are a result of this endeavor (Creel 1986; Prewitt 1991; Weir 1976). The common
presence of deer remains in burned rock middens encourages the view that deer processing took
place at burned rock midden sites. Bison bone is encountered in archaeological sites in south
Texas, at least occasionally, during all but the earliest part of the Middle Archaic (Dillehay 1974).
Cemeteries make their first appearance during this period, suggesting a movement toward less
mobility and perhaps territorialism. One of the earliest occurrences dating to the south Texas
Middle Archaic, is Loma Sandia in Live Oak County, which dates between ca. 2550 and 2750
B.P. (Taylor and Highley 1995).
Late Archaic (2350 - 1250 B.P.)
Hester believes the Late Archaic in south Texas may be defined as between 2350–1250 B.P,
Some researchers believe populations increased throughout the Late Archaic, while others feel
populations remained the same or fell during this period (Black 1989:30). Subsistence is assumed
to have become less specialized on acorns, in favor of a broad spectrum subsistence base (Black
1989:30). Story (1985:44–45) believes the presence of cemeteries indicates that Late Archaic
populations in central and south Texas were increasing and becoming more territorial. Although
inhabitants of the South Texas Plain near Brownsville and Rockport had begun to make pottery
by about 1750 B.P., the northern part of the plain was still “pre-ceramic” until 1,000 years later
(Story 1985:45–47). Late Archaic points tend to be much smaller than Middle Archaic points.
Transitional Archaic (2250 - 1250 B.P.)
A late subperiod or interval of the Late Archaic is frequently referred to as the Terminal Archaic
or Transitional Archaic. Turner and Hester (1999) cite data placing the Transitional Archaic as
2250–1250 B.P. Although Hester may lump current data into a Late Archaic period, he cautions
that more evidence will likely result in what may be termed as a “Terminal Archaic” period during
the latter part of the Late Archaic in south Texas. This Terminal Archaic period is represented
by diagnostics such as Ensor, Frio, and Matamoras points which appear to overlap the Late
Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods (Hester 1995:442). Weir (1976) believes this marked a
transition period to localized area sites, a disappearance of burned rock middens and bison, and
a reappearance of highly mobile hunters and gatherers. Others (Black and McGraw 1985; Peter
1982; Skelton 1977) argue that in some locations burned rock middens did not disappear and sites
were more intensely occupied during the Transitional Archaic period.
6

Late Prehistoric (1250 - 420 B.P.)
The term “Late Prehistoric” is commonly used to designate the period following the Late Archaic
in south Texas. Generally, the Late Prehistoric period is thought of as spanning the period
between A. D. 700 - 1530 ([1250 - 420 B.P.] [Hester 1995]). A series of distinctive traits mark
the shift from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period, including the technological shift to the
bow and arrow and the introduction of pottery to central Texas and the northern South Texas
Plain (Black 1989:32; Story 1985:45–47). Two distinct phases recognized within the Late
Prehistoric are the Austin and Toyah. During the Austin phase, there appears to be a subtle
transition from expanding stem projectile points that may have been used as dart points, as well
as early arrow points. The most prevalent point found in Austin phase sites is the Scallorn arrow
point. Settlement shifts into rockshelters such as Scorpion Cave in Medina County (Highley et
al. 1978) and Classen Rockshelter in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967) have been
noted. Cemeteries from this period often reveal evidence of conflict (Black 1989:32).
Beginning rather abruptly at about 650 B.P., a shift in technology occurred. The Perdiz arrow
point may best represent the appearance of a distinct culture in south-central Texas lasting for
about 300 years, which archaeologists have labeled the Toyah phase. Hester (1995:444)
recognizes this phase as the “best documented Late Prehistoric pattern” throughout south Texas,
with dates ranging between ca. 650/700 to 300/350 B.P. (A.D. 1250/1300 to 1600/1650).
In addition to Perdiz points, evidence of a Toyah culture is manifested as bone-tempered pottery,
bone spatulates, awls, and beads, stone endscrapers, beveled knives, and expediently utilized
flakes. Briefly, expedient lithic technology involves removing flakes from a core in a nonstandard
manner; the purpose is to knock off sharp flakes for immediate use, selecting the ones that best
suit the need at the time. This technology differs from formal, standardized core reduction and
the manufacturing of formal, usually bifacial tools. Expedient lithic technology is a continent-wide
phenomonon indicative of increased sedentism, and is observed in Toyah assemblages in Texas.
Whether the Toyah phase seen in the south-central Texas archaeological record is a result of a
group of people moving into the region, or adapted technologies from the region’s periphery is
a matter of conjecture. Steele and Assad-Hunter (1986) argue for the occurrence of a distinct
change in diet between the Late Archaic and the Late Prehistoric components in two sites in the
Choke Canyon Reservoir area in south Texas. Analysis of the number of identified specimens
(NISP) shows a marked increase in artiodactyla elements present during the later part of the Late
Prehistoric, an increase largely due to the addition of bison to the “menu” (Steele and AssadHunter 1986:468).
Whether or not agriculture was practiced during this period in south Texas has not been
documented. There simply is not enough evidence to postulate there was ever a significant
presence of maize in the area. The later arrival of the Spanish during the later
Protohistoric/Historic period brought significant cultivars to south Texas.
Protohistoric/Historic (420 B.P. - present)
The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period in south Texas is
7

characterized by written accounts of European contact with indigenous groups. The Protohistoric
period begins in 1528 when Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca traversed parts of southeast and
south Texas and left a diary of his five years spent traveling among the hunter-gatherers of Texas
and northern Mexico (e.g., Hallenbeck 1971). Cabeza de Vaca’s account of his stay with the
Miriami in 1533-34 indicates that groups of Native Americans would normally tether themselves
to the easily exploitable riverine environments in the fall, winter and summer, occasionally sending
a hunting party onto the grasslands to hunt deer. In the summer, many groups would live near
each other in the semiarid environs of South Texas to harvest prickly pear pads and other
succulents (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13-37).
Linguistically, early protohistoric accounts of the late 1500s indicate that a large group which
spoke Cohuilteco inhabited the area now known as south-central Texas. Coahuiltecan is a term
coined by Mexican linguists in the 1800s, and the name refers to the many small bands of Native
Americans who lived in northeastern Coahuila, Mexico and south Texas. The Coahuiltecans were
rapidly dispersed or killed during the Protohistoric period.
The period between de Vaca’s written account and the advent of Spanish missions in the late
1600s and early 1700s is referred to as the Protohistoric; a time when few, scant written
documents exist detailing Native American life outside the missions. The Historic period then, is
generally thought of as beginning in the 1700s.
Some 30 miles south of Eagle Pass, the Spanish established Mission San Juan Bautista in 1700
(now modern-day Guerrero). Early Spanish explorers then repeatedly traveled the Camino Real
enroute to newly established missions and settlements in today’s modern Texas throughout the
1700s and 1800s. Mexican families from across the river expanded into Texas, and these families
trace their roots to the early development of the area. In the ensuing years, lawlessness prevailed,
with saloons, gambling houses, outlaws, and slave hunters prevalent.

McMullen County Prehistory and History
Indian artifacts found in McMullen County indicate that the area has been occupied for about
11,000 years. Plentiful food sources such as wild game, fruits, seeds, and roots made the land
hospitable. Early technology included tools from wood and stone, woven basketry, sewed
rabbitskin robes, and a very effective weapon was the atlatl, a throwing stick that greatly
increased the deadliness of their spears (Leffler 1996a). Perhaps as early as 1,300 years ago, they
learned to make pottery and to hunt with bows and arrows. During the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, the Coahuiltecan Indians native to McMullen County were squeezed out by
other Indian who were migrating into the area and by the Spanish, who were moving up from the
south. Many of the Coahuiltecans were taken to San Juan Bautista in Coahuila. Apaches and
Comanches moved in to take their place (Leffler 1996).
“In the earliest of written accounts, no permanent Spanish settlements seem to have been
established in the area now known as McMullen County. In 1828, the land was assigned to John
8

McMullen and James McGloin, who contracted to settle the area with 200 Catholic immigrants.
By 1835 the Mexican government had issued perhaps fifteen grants of land in the area of present
McMullen County to colonists associated with the McMullen-McGloin project. None of these
grantees actually settled on the land assigned to them, however. By 1836, when Texas seceded
from Mexico, the area remained populated almost entirely by the Indian bands that roamed
through the area.
When William Bollaert, an English land speculator, traveled through the area between the Nueces
and Frio rivers in 1844, for example, the only people he encountered were convicts who had
escaped from a prison in Laredo. Even after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo definitively
assigned the Nueces Strip to Texas, outlaws and unfriendly Indians delayed development of the
area for years. By 1860, there were perhaps 100 settlers in the county. By the late 1860s and
early 1870s, a number of ranches had been established, mostly in the northern part of the county.
For protection, ranchers often grouped their dwellings together” (Leffler 1996a:437-440).
Without written or oral accounts before the 1700s, it is difficult or impossible to truly say what
bands or tribes were within the modern political boundaries of McMullen County before then.
Only cultural affiliations can be assigned to those groups, equating their technologies and
apparent lifestyles to the successive Paleo-Indian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods.
Archaeologists have documented an assundry of prehistoric archaeological sites, including large
open campsites that are most commonly located along stream or river terraces with numerous
campfires, where a wide variety of stone tools, grinding stones, pottery sherds, and butchered
animal remains are found. Where gravels outcrop, either along eroded streambeds, or on higher
terrain where more ancient gravels are sometimes exposed in isolated pockets, one can expect
stone chipping stations, or prehistoric quarries.
The earliest historic accounts of Native Americans in south Texas and perhaps the McMullen
county areas, are those of Cabeza de Vaca. In the 1500s, Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca
traversed parts of southeast and south Texas and left a diary of his five years spent traveling
among the hunter-gatherers of Texas and northern Mexico (e.g., Covey 1961). His account of
his experiences in 1533–34 indicates that groups of Native Americans would normally tether
themselves to the easily exploitable riverine environments in the fall, winter, and summer,
occasionally sending a hunting party onto the grasslands to hunt deer. In the summer, many
groups would live near each other in the semiarid environs of south Texas to harvest prickly pear
pads and other succulents (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13–37).
By the 1540s and 1550s, Spanish ranchers had established large ranches in northern Mexico with
thousands of cattle, and using Native Americans as slave labor. This encroachment by the Spanish
forced groups from northern Mexico to flee into south Texas. In the 1700s and 1800s, there are
documented accounts of Spanish entradas passing through the area, but none have been noted
to establish any sort of permanent bases in present-day Mc Mullen county (Chipman 1992).
It was not until about 1865, that the surrounding frontier hinterlands that are now politically
known as Mc Mullen county were considered safe enough for white settlers to begin establishing
9

smaller ranches and farmlands without complete annihilation by the many roving bands of angry
Comanche raiders from the north, as well as other displaced Native American groups (Leffler
1996b). In sum, there may be rare and isolated occurrences of early ranching activities along the
McKenzie South Lateral, but the expectations of encountering any archaeological site of
significance from the 1500s through the mid-1900s along the line were minimal.

Site Types That Could be Expected Along the Project Area
Prehistoric Open Campsites
Most numerous among the sites recorded in McMullen county are prehistoric open campsites
ranging in age from the Paleoindian period through the Historic period (see Figure 5). Some of
these represent a single campfire where a very small group of Native Americans may have camped
for one night. Others are very large, covering very extensive areas representing large groups of
people that stayed for long periods, perhaps seasonally, with ancestral groups returning to these
same campsites over a period of several thousands of years. Cultural remains to be found at these
large campsites include among other items, an abundance of fire-cracked rocks representing
multiple hearths, a wide variety of chipped stone tools and the lithic debris that results from
making them, ground and smoothed stones used to grind nuts and seeds, faunal remains from
terrestrial and aquatic animals consumed, bone tools, pottery sherds, and mussel and snail shells.
Open campsites occur in all types of environments, whether that be in a plush riverine
environment that offered a wide variety banquet of plant and animal foodstuffs, or in the uplands
away from flowing water sources. Seasonally, the upland grasses, shrubs, and cacti offered a
different food source that could be exploited such as various grass seeds, mesquite beans, prickly
pear pads and tunas, and agave hearts. In addition, at various times, bison were known to graze
on the northern South Texas Plains, and were highly sought after for use as food, hides, and bone
tools (Dillehay 1974).
Depending upon the integrity of these open campsites, archaeologists and the Texas Historical
Commission consider these as perhaps the most significant types of sites in regard to their ability
to contribute to our understanding of south Texas prehistory. A few of the desired ingredients
that can indicate significance include cultural material that is buried beneath the surface in a wellpreserved, stratified, and relatively undisturbed context. Although these situations most frequently
occur within stratified terrace deposits adjacent to streams, they can also occur in upland settings
where the landscape has been generally stable through time. Other ingredients that archaeologists
look for in potentially significant campsites include good organic preservation in the form of
charcoal and/or charred plant remains, faunal preservation, temporally diagnostic stone tools or
ceramics, and intact features such as hearths.

Prehistoric Lithic Scatters or Procurement Sites
Lithic scatters are the next most common type of archaeological site that could be expected
within the PA. These sites simply represent the chipped stone debris and broken tools that were
left behind when Native Americans made new tools or re-sharpened their old ones. The general
absence of fire-cracked rocks and other cultural material normally found at open campsites
10

suggest that they did not camp there, or remain there for any extended period of time (however,
small camp fires may have been used to heat-treat chert or quartzite cobbles to make them more
knappable). Yet, they were drawn to these isolated locales because of the natural outcroppings
or surface exposures of good quality raw material such as chert or quartzite cobbles. Examples
of chipped stone most commonly found at these sites include cobbles with one or two flakes
removed, called ‘tested cobbles’. That is, the Native Americans knew from experience the quality
of stone that could most easily be flaked and reduced for stone tool production, so they ‘tested’
the cobble to judge whether it was usable or not. If the quality was judged to be inferior, then the
cobble was tossed aside. That is why the majority of tested cobbles found on these sites are of
poor quality, coarse-grained material. While the finished stone tool products are carried away
from these sites, what remains are those tools broken during the manufacturing process, and the
thousands of pieces of debitage in the form of flakes and angular debris. Also unique to lithic
scatters where large cobbles are present are snapped ‘quarry blanks’. These are simply cobbles
flakes on both sides, reducing the cobble into a transportable ‘blank’ that can be used to further
reduce it and make finished stone tools from the flakes taken off of it. The unbroken quarry
blanks are usually not found on these sites because they have been carried off, presumably to
areas of south Texas where raw material is not readily available. The snapped or broken quarry
blanks are of little or no use, so they are discarded and left behind.
Lithic scatters range in age from the Paleoindian through the Historic periods and can be found
on any landscape setting where gravels or cobbles have been exposed. Notably, gravel outcrops
that were exposed to the surface a few hundred or thousand years ago could be deeply buried
today, and the opposite could also be true; it all depends on the terrain setting and the dynamics
of landscape evolution through time. Most lithic scatters in La Salle and McMullen counties have
been documented along upper stream terraces abutting the eroded upland slopes.
Prehistoric Quarries
Prehistoric quarries can also can range in age from the Paleoindian through Historic periods, but
differ from lithic scatters in that at those sites Native Americans exploited loose gravels, but at
times they specifically sought quarry sites where raw material such as cherts or quartzites were
not yet freed from their parent geologic formation, and they had to be ‘quarried’. These types
of sites are rare in south Texas for two reasons: 1) the geological exposures generally do not
present themselves, and 2) throughout Texas, even in central Texas, it is much easier to pick up
gravels from the surface than to try to mine them from hard rock. Quarried and chipped stone
remains likely to be found at these sites include large chunks of angular cherts or quartzites, as
well as parent material detritus, and flaking debris. Snapped quarry blanks can also be expected.
Although a handful of prehistoric quarries or procurement sites have been recorded in south
Texas, they are rare.
Prehistoric Burned Rock Middens
There are no documented burned rock middens in McMullen county. Burned rock middens result
from a series of multiple-use earth ovens that were constructed much like modern-day roasting
pits are dug into the earth for roasting a pig. With repetitive uses, as the larger rocks that serve
as heating elements in the earthen pit fracture and thus become less effective as a thermal source,
11

they are ‘pitched out’ around the edge of the pit. As the pit becomes unusable, another is dug
near by, and the procedure repeated. Over time, these multiple pits and the ‘pitched out’ firecracked rocks coalesce together, obscuring each pit as indiscernible. (For a full discussion of the
formation of burned rock middens and their documented presence in Texas, see Leach and
Bousman 2001; Leach et al. 2001; Mauldin et al. 2003).
Prehistoric Burial and Cemetery Sites
Although not common, isolated prehistoric burials and cemeteries have been documented in south
Texas. Individual and isolated burials have been found in association with open campsites in both
upland settings as well as in alluvial terraces along streams, but the largest prehistoric cemetery
found in proximity to the PA is 41LK28, in Live Oak County.
Historic Sites
As discussed above in the Cultural Chronology portion of this report, although Spanish ranchers
had established large ranches in northern Mexico by the mid-16th century, and Spanish entradas
began penetrating south Texas in the 1700s and 1800s, there is no record of any sort of
permanent structures in the area during those periods (Chipman 1992). The area was generally
not considered safe for settlement by whites until after the Civil War in 1865, and white settlers
then began establishing smaller ranches and farmlands (Leffler 1996).
Because of the vastness of the landscape and the relatively late settlement and development of
south Texas compared to east and central Texas and northern Mexico, historic sites are not
abundant, but they certainly do exist. The most common types to be encountered are related to
ranching and farming endeavors, or small communities from the 19th and 20th centuries. Site types
most commonly include farmsteads or ranches with corrals, cisterns, chimney and foundation
remains from both main houses and outbuildings, related trash dumps, an occasional family burial
or cemetery, school houses, churches, community buildings, and industry-related structures or
construction projects. In general, the area has been historically used predominantly as ranchland
pasture, with no development other than associated ranching activities such as windmills, stock
tanks, corrals, and sparsely scattered outbuildings. site of significance from the 1500s through the
mid-1900s along the line were minimal.

Results of A Cultural Resources Background Review
The research by TAAI included:
1) A review of the most current literature documenting the prehistory and history of the
immediate area
2) A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas to identify
what cultural resource surveys have been conducted, and what archaeological sites have been
documented within one mile of the project area
12

3) A search of various websites that offer old maps of the PA
4) A literature review of both published and unpublished reports and manuscripts that describe
the types of archaeological sites that have been documented, and thus provide insight as to the
types of sites that may be expected either in the PA, or immediately adjacent to it
5) A review of a local soils map in order to evaluate the potential for intact and buried cultural
materials either within or immediately adjacent to the PA.
Archaeological Atlas Site Results
McMullen County
As of the end of June 2012, there were 528 documented archaeological sites in McMullen County.
Of those, 378 are prehistoric open campsites with evidence that as a whole, open campsites in the
county have been occupied from the Paleoindian through the Historic periods. As with most of the
region, many campsites are situated on stream terraces, but there are also some in the uplands. 107
sites are classified as lithic scatters, and generally these are located in the uplands and along stream
cutbanks where gravels outcrop. They also exhibit evidence of being used for the past 11,000
years. Eighteen lithic procurement sites have been recorded in the county, as has a single sandstone
burned rock midden. Three prehistoric burials have been noted at three of the open campsites.
Historic sites consist of local family cemeteries with just a few burials in each, house sites and
farmsteads from as early as the 1850s, a possible Spanish Colonial presence from the 1700s, and
more modern trash scatters (Atlas 2012).
Surveys and Sites within One Mile of the Current Project Area
A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Atlas of Texas Archeological sites indicated that
there were five previously recorded archaeological sites within one mile (1,609 meters) of the DCP
Tie-in on Highway 72 to FM1582. They are briefly summarized below, and their locations shown
in Figures 6 and 7.

Although the Texas Atlas does not show previous privately funded surveys, shown in Figures 6
and 7 are surveys conducted by TAAI within one mile of the current project. In June through
August 2011, TAAI conducted a field survey of the Regency Cheyenne Pipeline, resulting in the
discovery of two prehistoric sites, but neither were within one mile of the proposed La Salle DCP
Tie-in to FM1582 segment (Nickels 2011a,b).
In May and June 2012, TAAI conducted an archaeological survey of the La Salle Pipeline, STS
North to DCP Tie-in segment. Although four archaeological sites were documented, none of the
four were within one mile of the proposed La Salle DCP Tie-in to FM1582 segment (Nickels
15

2012).
In addition, always of historical interest
are the surmised routes taken by the
earliest Spanish explorers in the region
(Figures 8-11). One of the leading
experts on tracing the many routes of
the Camino Real through the state of
Texas is Al McGraw. The following
excerpts are from Dr. McGraw’s
“Origin of the Camino Real in Texas”
(2012):
The old Spanish road called the Camino
Real has had many names since it first
entered Texas in the late 17th century.
But whatever it was called — Camino
Real de los Tejas, Camino Pita, Camino
Arriba, Camino de en Medio, King’s
Highway, Old San Antonio Road — it
was not an ordinary camino (road).
Though often little more than a mule
track, it was a camino real — a royal
road with special status. Our knowledge
of the Camino Real is incomplete. Our
understanding of the trail’s origins and
its changes grow as new information is
gathered and old information is
reassessed.
Figure 8. Projected routes of the Camino Real
The Camino Real was a network of (McGraw 2012).
Spanish roads that crossed the Rio
Grande into Texas from Mexico near San Juan Bautista mission and presidio at today’s
Guerrero, Coahuila, Mexico — about 35 miles downstream from present-day Eagle Pass. The
routes extended through San Antonio de Valero to the presidio at Los Adaes in Louisiana. The
route was developed to confront and counter French intrusion into the northeastern frontier of
the Spanish borderlands. It also became the first route of evangelization by Spanish missionaries
attempting to Christianize Indian groups from the Rio Grande to the Red River. Several decades
later, its path from the Brazos to the Trinity rivers helped defuse the threat of Indian nations
armed by and loosely allied to the French and transformed those groups into an uneasy buffer
between divergent cultures. Settlements established along the component roads were among the
state’s earliest cities and communities. And, in the 19th century, the trail became an important
route of immigration into the republic, and later the state of Texas.
Perhaps not surprisingly, sections of the route have been incorporated into or closely parallel
16

our modern system
of highways. The
Camino Real is not
a
d u s t y
anachronism; it is
a dynamic part of
present-day
culture. Not every

possessed charters
conferring royal privileges. The status granted to these villas, capitals and mining areas was
extended to the routes used by government officials, military troops and others traveling between
them on the business of the crown.
A search of the history of Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) granite markers reveals
that in 1915 the DAR arranged for the survey of the Old San Antonio Road from Louisiana to the
Rio Grande, and granite makers to be placed at approximately 5 mile intervals. “The location of
the road was verified by old Spanish land grants and other land records. Major V.N. Zively was
appointed by Governor Ferguson to survey the route. He accomplished this assignment during the
years 1915 and 1916. One hundred twenty-three markers were then placed, one approximately
every five miles, along the 539-mile route. The Texas DAR contributed $10,544, with an
additional $2,500 coming from the members, and the State Legislature appropriated $8,000 to
assist in this most worthy endeavor. The railroads contracted at 1/2 the regular portage rate to
transport the granite markers to their designated locations. On December 27 of that year, a
contract was let to Mr. A. L. Gooch for the sum of $4,300 for 123 markers installed at the stakes
left by Zively. Mr. Gooch placed 118 markers from the Sabine River to the town of Catarina --but
owing to the condition of the country west of Catarina, it was utterly impossible to set the
remaining 5 markers". The remaining markers were installed by local craftsmen. The Texas DAR
presented the Markers to the State of Texas in a ceremony on March 2, 1918 in San Pedro Park
in San Antonio” (Camino Real Markers 2012).
17

In 1995 through 2006, an effort was
made to re-locate and re-dedicate these
1918 granite markers. In general, the
effort was very successful, with 114 of
the 123
markers being found,
photographed, and GPSd. Figure 11
shows the Camino Real route as marked
by these 114 granite markers. According
to the recent re-location effort, there are
no granite markers located on the
proposed Highway 97 to FM1582
segment of the pipeline.

Historic Site Potential
A standard source of research is the
extensive collection of online maps and
aerial photographs available at the Perry
Castañeda Library at the University of
Texas at Austin. A second standard
research source consulted for old maps
and aerial photographs was a very
comprehensive and large compilation of Figure 10. Camino Real across Texas as marked by

compiled by the Texas Department of
Transportation from dozens of historic archives throughout the state of Texas. In this case, the
DCP Tie-in to FM 1582 Pipeline appears to be in a rural area of McMullen County that either
warranted little attention, or the area was void of historic structures. The only historic map located
was a 1942, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1:62,500' topographic map (Perry Castañeda Library
2012), which shows two structures along the proposed pipeline right-of-way. Both structures
appear to have been associated with the now-abandoned San Antonio, Uvalde, and Gulf (later the
Missouri Pacific) Railroad.
The southernmost structure is located in an area named “Zella Siding”, and the northernmost
structure is located in an area named “Prince Siding”. Both communities were developed in 1913
along the San Antonio, Uvalde, and Gulf (Sausage) Railroad. A linear portion of the remnants of
the San Antonio, Uvalde & Gulf Railroad bed has been designated as 41DM171. The rail line
began as the Crystal City & Uvalde, and following construction of its original line in 1909 between
Uvalde and Carrizo Springs, the line was expanded eastward to the Fowlerton area. In 1912, the
line was extended northward and helped create the communities of Zella, Prince, Hindes,
Charlotte, and Dobrowolski. The rail line was finally abandoned in the 1990s (Hemphill 2006).

18

In the heyday of
Zella, there was
an artesian, well,
a one-room
schoolhouse, a
post office, and a
hotel. Due to
lack of irrigation,
the community
never lived up to
its promise as a
farmer’s paradise,
and although the
railroad depot
operated through
1959, and the
hotel continued
in operation
through 1985
(Leffler 1996b),
nothing is left of
these remains
today. As for
Prince Siding,
little is known,

have also been a

agriculture. It is
unknown what

designated as the Zella Siding and Prince Siding areas.
Nevertheless, the lack of comprehensive historic map and aerial information, coupled with the
paucity of cultural resources surveys within the area is possibly, and perhaps probably, why no
information is available regarding the presence of historic structures, ranching or industrial
activities, or persons of historic significance to the immediate area. Historic sites recorded in
McMullen county consist of local family cemeteries with just a few burials in each, house sites and
farmsteads from as early as the 1850s, and trash scatters. Technically, any structures old than 45
years are now considered of interest by the Texas Historical Commission, and this should be
19

considered when
the Project Area
is developed.

their potential to contain deeply buried and intact cultural deposits. In sum, the DCP Tie-in to FM
1582 Pipeline right-of-way will pass through upland areas with soils and sediments that are
generally shallow, and if prehistoric archaeological sites do exist, they are likely in a palimpsest
(collapsed) or eroded state, and thus offer little in the way of scientific significance. However, the
right-of-way will also cross potential terrace deposits that have a moderate to high probability of
containing deeply buried and intact archaeological deposits that can be potentially significant to
our understanding of Texas prehistory.

Field Survey Goals, Methodology, and Levels of Effort
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey. The topics addressed were site type, distribution, density, size,
depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical framework is structured around patterns of settlement,
mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the South Texas region.
The goals of the project were to:
1)

locate and record cultural locations and sites in the project area using a systematic
survey methodology;
23

2)
3)

quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy; and,
place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

Methods and Levels of Effort
Two archaeologists conducted a general pedestrian survey of the pipeline, meandering back and
forth across the right-of-way. Surface visibility ranged from between 50 and 100 percent, and all
cutbanks, and push piles were thoroughly examined. A limited number of shovel tests were
excavated in high probability areas along the right-of-way, particularly in close proximity to
Rawhide Creek. In accordance with a general “no collection” policy, cultural material of a
redundant nature, both prehistoric and historic, were not to be collected. Instead, they were to be
fully documented via sketches, field photographs, and copious notes.
Exceptions were to be made for
diagnostic artifacts, particularly
those artifacts which could be
considered as significant to the
i n t e r p ret at i on of Te x a s
prehistory, such as Early
Archaic-Paleoindian transitional,
or Paleoindian diagnostics. These
were to be collected on a caseby-case basis, and that decision
was left up to the Principal
Investigator and/or the Project
Archaeologist. Historic buildings,
trash scatters, or other historic
occurrences adjacent to the
ROW were to be documented
with photographs and included in
this report of investigations.
A total of nine shovel tests were
dug in 20-cm levels, and all
sediments were screened through
1/4-inch wire mesh (Figure 15).
Following our designed research
plan, any artifacts observed on
the surface were to be left in
place; those recovered from re

shovel tests were not to be
collected, but were to be placed in the upper 10 cm of the backfilled shovel test. The results of

Archaeological Investigations office in Martindale, Texas.

24

Results of the Field Investigations
Our examination of the right-ofway revealed dense raw material
on the ridges that could be used
for manufacturing stone tools, as
well as areas where the right-ofway was either void of lithic
material, or was covered with
caliche nodules or large
fragments. Surprisingly, in those
areas that a desktop review
indicated that there were
potentially deeply buried and
significant archaeological
deposits, we found none (see for
example, Figure 16). Much of the
pipeline right-of-way had been
mechanically cleared and
disturbed in the recent past, and Figure 16. Mechanically disturbed and eroded cutbank at the

areas were less disturbed, and apparently had never been used for anything but rangeland.
The only evidence of cultural material was found on two newly discovered prehistoric open
campsites: 41MC677 and 41MC678. Descriptions of these sites follow.

25

41MC677
Description
41MC677 (Figures 17 and 18) is a
prehistoric lithic procurement site
situated on an upland sideslope on the
south side of Esparanza Creek, located
some 200 meters to the north, and a firstorder tributary of the Frio River. Surface
elevation across the site from south to
north ranges between 335-345 feet amsl.
Common chert gravels are predominant
across an eroded surface of Brundage
very fine sandy loam (BrB), with clay
hardpan exposed in both two-track roads
that course through the site. The
vegetation on the western portion of the
site is secondary growth consisting of
mesquite and other thorny bushes and
assorted cacti. This appears to have
grown in the not too distant past
following machine clearing and brush pile
burning of the area.

Site Summary, Conclusions, and
Recommendations
This site appears to have been an upland
prehistoric lithic procurement site where
an outcrop of fine-grained chert gravels
were exploited to fashion stone tools for
transport elsewhere. However, due to
the extremely mixed contexts and heavy
machine disturbance, it could be that the
site was occupied as an open campsite
for an unknown period (or periods) in
prehistory. In its current heavily
disturbed condition, the research value
of this site is considered minimal. As
such, Tierras Antiguas recommends that Figure 19. Examples of artifacts at 41MC677: left to

segment as currently aligned be allowed
to proceed with no further investigations at this site.
41MC678
Description
This prehistoric open campsite was
discovered on a northeasterly facing
sideslope above Rawhide Creek,
approximately 150 meters to the east, a
second-order tributary of the Frio River. The
western portion of the site lies in a cultivated
field that now is fallow hay pastureland.
Slope erosion has limited the vegetation so
that only sparse bunch grasses were present
during our documentation of the site in May
2012. Along a barbed wire fence through the
eastern portion of the site, mesquite and
other thorny brush, prickly pear and tasajillo
cacti have thrived (Figures 20 and 21).
Elevation at the site ranges from 369-372
feet amsl. Soils on this gentle slope are
comprised of Brundage very fine sandy loam
(BrB), with clay hardpan exposed in both
two-track roads that course through the site.
Figure 20. Site map, 41MC678.

27

Levels of Effort and Results
A thorough surface survey
revealed that the artifacts
observed were lying on an
eroded claypan surface along the
two-track road, and otherwise
mixed within the cultivated field.
As shown in Figure 21, surface
visibility ranged from 90 to 100
percent. Chert gravels were
prevalent in this immediate area,
on what appears to be a rather
distinct break in topography;
possibly an ancient terrace.

(Figure 22).
Site Summary, Conclusions, and
Recommendations
This site appears to be a
relatively small prehistoric open
campsite where chert gravels
exposed on an eroded upland
slope were exploited to fashion
stone tools. Without a
temporally diagnostic piece of
chipped stone or pottery sherd,
the period or periods during
which this site was occupied will
remain an unknown. In its
current heavily disturbed
condition, the research value of
this site is considered minimal. Figure 22. Selected artifacts found on the surface at

the La Salle Pipeline’s Hwy 97 to FM 1582 (aka Bee Line) segment as currently aligned be
allowed to proceed through this site, with no further investigations.

28

Survey Conclusions and Recommendations
A pedestrian survey with limited shovel testing of moderate and high probability areas along the
right-of-way was conducted by two archaeologists over two days in May, 2012. Approximately
98 percent of the pipeline right-of-way had been mechanically cleared and disturbed in the recent
past. Two newly discovered prehistoric open campsites (41MC677 and 41MC678) were
documented. These were assessed as heavily disturbed and non-significant.
As such, Tierras Antiguas recommended that the development of the pipeline be allowed to
proceed as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommended that if any additional,
undiscovered cultural resources are encountered during development, such finds should be
examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant
