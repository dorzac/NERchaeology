Chapter 9: Freshwater Mussels and Miscellaneous Invertebrates

INTRODUCTION
This chapter describes freshwater mussels (family Unionidae), sphaeriid clams
and peaclams (both family Sphaeriidae), and a complete mud dauber nest recovered from
the bench deposits. The mussels and the mud dauber nest are thought to be the result of
human harvesting, while the sphaeriid clams and peaclams were probably deposited by
flooding. I will also briefly review the freshwater mussels from the upper deposits, from
contemporary populations in the Berger Bluff catchment, and from the archeological
record in Texas and elsewhere. Only two species of freshwater mussels were found in the
bench deposits proper: Amblema plicata (Threeridge, a moderate-sized collection) and
Megalonaias nervosa (Giant Washboard, a single specimen), but a single example of
Quadrula apiculata (Southern Mapleleaf) was found somewhat over 20 meters
downstream from the excavation area, at about the same level as stratum 2A, and is also
considered part of the bench mussel assemblage. It is outside the limits of the bench area,
but inside the mapped extent of Berger Bluff as a whole. All three species are members
of the subfamily Ambleminae. Because the size and age of the mussels may be related to
the frequency and severity of catastrophic flooding, I will also discuss size and age
estimates for A. plicata.

CONTEMPORARY MUSSEL POPULATIONS IN THE BERGER BLUFF CATCHMENT
Some of the earliest scientific research on freshwater mussels in Texas was done
by Joseph D. Mitchell in the Victoria area and published in 1894. Probably collecting
1266

from near the confluence with the Guadalupe River, Mitchell lists only four species from
Coleto Creek: “Unio manubius” (now Uniomerus declivis), “Unio texasensis”
(Toxolasma texasensis), “Unio berlandieri” (Cyrtonaias tampicoensis), and “Unio
speciosus” (Quadrula apiculata; Mitchell n.d., 18-20). The only pelecypods reported
from the Coleto Creek drainage during the pre-impoundment survey of aquatic ecology
were five introduced Asian clams (Corbicula sp.) found at the Coletoville Road crossing
(Murray, Jinnette, and Moseley 1976:Table 13). Asian clams were fairly abundant in the
Coleto Creek bed sediments at Berger Bluff at the time of fieldwork

I also observed and collected flood-deposited shells at various locations in the
Berger Bluff catchment while collecting soil and water samples for diatom analysis in
1997-98. In 2002, these were identified by Robert G. Howells, Heart of the Hills
Research Station, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. For location, see Brown
(2002:Fig. 95). Mussels were collected from four diatom sampling localities, plus a stock
pond near Berger Bluff examined during the Flume No. 3 survey in 1983.

CONTEMPORARY FRESHWATER MUSSELS IN THE GUADALUPE RIVER
At least 12 species of mussels have been recorded by the Academy of Natural
Sciences of Philadelphia from the Guadalupe River near Victoria (Academy of Natural
Sciences of Philadelphia 1991:Tables IV-1 through IV-6) from 1949 to 1973. In addition,
there are a number of Megalonaias nervosa specimens from the Carlisle Creek locality
(see discussion below under that species). Table 9.1 shows the species list near Victoria.

FRESHWATER MUSSELS FROM HOLOCENE ARCHEOLOGICAL DEPOSITS
Freshwater mussel assemblages have been identified from two other archeological
sites in the Coleto Creek drainage, the Smith Creek Bridge site (41 DW 270) about 54.6
km upstream in De Witt County, and 41 GD 21 and 41 GD 21A, located about 7.5 km
away on the Sulphur Creek arm of the reservoir. Mussels from 41 GD 21/21A were
identified by Harold Murray (nine species), and those from the Smith Creek Bridge site
(seven species) by Robert Howells. Both assemblages are probably mostly late Holocene.
The Threeridge (Amblema plicata) is the most abundant species at both sites (Table 9.2).

FRESHWATER MUSSELS FROM THE UPPER DEPOSITS AT BERGER BLUFF
Two lots of freshwater mussels (six species) from David Brown’s excavations in
the upper deposits (levels 1 and 2 only) were identified in 1985 by Raymond Neck (n.d.),
at my request. Table 9.3 shows the taxonomic composition.

Neck, commenting on these lots of shell, remarks:
Quadrula petrina is usually found in streams with moderate current over a coarse
substrate, i.e. sand or gravel…In summary, the freshwater bivalves from the two
samples examined are indicative of a stream with a coarse substrate with possibly
somewhat greater flow than Coleto Creek during historical times. The uneroded
condition of the umbos indicates presence of alkaline water. As reported by
1271

Murray (1979), all specimens of all species are from small individuals. This
diminutive size was most pronounced in Quadrula petrina. The shells of Q.
petrina may indicate the past existence of a short-lived population in feeder
streams. Such populations may have periodically been extirpated as water flows
decreased during drought times. Permanent populations may have been present in
the lower reaches of Coleto Creek and possibly the mainstem of the San Antonio
River (Neck n.d.).
Amblema plicata is also the most abundant surface-collected species found at the nearby
site of 41 GD 31 (Brown 1986:7).

SHELL PRESERVATION AND TAPHONOMY
As would be expected, shell preservation is much better in the upper deposits than
in the bench deposits. Shells from the bench deposits are fragile, powdery, and subject to
delamination, although the larger and more complete specimens can be identified to the
species or generic level without difficulty. There are more shell fragments than complete
or nearly complete valves, in part because valves were sometimes struck by shovels or
trowels during excavation, or simply fragmented as the matrix was broken up. Much of
the mussel shell in the collection shows evidence of fresh breakage, making it difficult to
determine whether the shell was already broken when encountered, or simply broke
during exposure. In some cases, complete or nearly complete valves were exposed in situ,
but the thinnest part of the valve opposite the umbo was little more than a powdery stain
that broke away when the rest of the valve was extracted. As a result, the lab photos of
specimens from the bench included in this chapter show valves that are somewhat less
complete than when they were first exposed. Active groundwater movement during much
of the early history of the site has affected shell preservation, and although phreatic
carbonate has helped to buffer the potential acidity of the quartz sand matrix, it also made
it very difficult to expose and recover shells without damage.
1272

However, there are several shells that definitely had evidence of old breaks when
they were encountered. The best examples are a cluster of smashed Amblema plicata
valves in unit N109 E96, stratum 2D, associated with a debris scatter in the upper part of
the unit. Included are two Amblema plicata left valves that had been smashed with a hard
percussor, plotted in place at 92.69 m (Fig. 4.50, upper plan, item 2 and shown as Fig.
9.1) and at 92.68 m (Fig. 4.50, upper plan, item 4), both lying concave side down.
Slightly deeper are two smashed Amblema plicata right valve fragments, both plotted at
92.62 m and found lying concave side up (Fig. 4.50, upper plan, items 1 and 3). This
debris scatter is associated with radiocarbon assay AA 2831.
There are at least three additional examples with pre-excavation breakage. One is
an A. plicata right valve fragment from the stratum 2C/2D contact in N112 E99 (92.8992.60 m). Another is an A. plicata left valve that was apparently incomplete and missing
the umbo when exposed, plotted and photographed in place (N111 E101, 92.19 m,
stratum 2A, valve 2). In unit N109 E96, at 92.28 m, an unidentified shell fragment was
found and plotted in stratum 2B (near Feature 7, but below detection elevation). There are
also three Amblema plicata valves (two left, one right) removed from stratum 2A whose
status is ambiguous. These have extensive fresh breakage as a result of collection, but
may have old breakage as well. A single Megalonaias nervosa left valve removed from
stratum 2A in the cutbank was evidently incomplete when found, and the single example
of Quadrula apiculata collected somewhat over 20 m downstream from the excavation
area, probably from stratum 2A is very incomplete and has at least some old breakage,
although most of the incompleteness may be due to chemical dissolution.

1273

Figure 9.1. Closeup of Old Break on Amblema plicata Valve. N109 E96 (92.69 m), left
valve. No scale.
Along with this evidence of pre-burial breakage (most likely by human occupants of the
site), a number of complete valves were found, plotted, and photographed in place and
will be illustrated in the section on shell distribution.
A few specimens show evidence of heat alteration. One is calcined (lot B-133,
N109 E96, 92.60-92.55 m, unidentified lateral hinge tooth fragment). There are some
unidentified heat-discolored lateral tooth fragments (lot B-82, N111 E101, 92.25-92.20
1274

m), possibly from an Amblema left valve plotted in situ in the level, and another
discolored and heated lateral tooth fragment, unidentified but morphologically consistent
with Amblema (lot B-48, N110 E102, 92.35-92.30 m). In lot B-76 is another lateral hinge
tooth fragment (N111 E101, 92.55-92.50 m) that is only slightly discolored and has
probably experienced less intense heating. It is unidentified, but is from a left valve
comparable to a modern A. plicata. Finally, in lot B-134 is a small flake of unidentifiable
shell with mostly old breakage. It has a dark, iridescent color and may have been slightly
heated.

The presence of several valves, probably all from adult Amblema, with evidence
of heat discoloration and fragmentation of the hinge area suggests the interesting
possibility that heat may have been applied locally to the hinge area to relax the adductor
muscle (cf. Neck 1987:232). It is probably no coincidence that nearly all of the few heatdiscolored fragments discovered come from this same area of the valve.

Because the mussel shells from the bench are so fragmented, it is difficult to
compile an accurate specimen count. For example, a single excavation level might yield a
very large number of freshly broken, powdery, delaminated slivers of shell. Do they
represent a single shell broken during excavation, or two, or more? If there are many wall
fragments but no umbo present, then an MNI count of “one” must be recorded (and that
is the procedure that has been used here for the stratigraphic inventory), but it must also
be recognized that more than one valve might have been present. It is also clear that
counting only umbos would result in a substantial undercount of the sample size. Table
9.4 represents the best possible estimate of the number of specimens recovered from the
bench.

SPECIES ACCOUNTS
Amblema plicata (Threeridge), 16 definite and 5 probable specimens (Fig. 9.2)
A total (NISP) of 21 specimens can be assigned to this species. A “specimen” is
either a single valve or a shell fragment that is sufficiently isolated in space that it is
reasonably certain that it is not simply a fragment derived from a valve in an adjacent
level or unit. Normally, information on size and side would be used to compile an MNI
count since there are two valves per individual, but the bench specimens are too
fragmentary to allow this. In fact, there is no evidence that any of the valves are paired,
and it is likely that the MNI count is not much smaller than 21. In addition, it is very
likely that the five unidentified specimens represent additional A. plicata valves.
1276

“Probable” specimens are fragments that are morphologically compatible with Amblema
plicata but are too incomplete for definite identification. In some cases these can be sided
but not identified. Based on size, all specimens are adults except two which are probably
on the borderline between juvenile and reproductively mature (see Stein 1969).

The present range for Amblema plicata (also termed Amblema costata or
Crenodonta peruviana in some of the older literature) covers most of Texas except the
Llano Estacado, Rolling Plains, and the Rio Grande and Pecos River drainages (see map
in Howells, Neck and Murray 1996:35). At archeological sites within this area, it is
perhaps the most consistently recovered species of freshwater mussel of any, and when it
is present, it is very often the most abundant taxon. In other words, it ranks very high
both on “ubiquity” and “abundance” indices, probably because it is cosmopolitan in
geographic distribution and habitat preference, can tolerate drought, and is large enough
to serve as a good food resource. There are a few major archeological projects in south
Texas where other species ranked higher. For example, at Choke Canyon Reservoir,
Amblema was a very minor taxon and the collections from most of the major sites were
dominated by Cyrtonaias tampicoensis and, to a lesser extent, Lampsilis species (Murray
1982), but at most sites reported in the literature, Amblema seems to dominate the
collections. Beyond Texas, the species extends throughout the Mississippi River basin
into Canada. It also is often the most abundant species documented in contemporary
freshwater mussel surveys of water bodies such as the Navasota River (Littleton
1979:20), the Little Brazos River (Little and Gentner 1970:Table 1), the Blanco River
(Horne and McIntosh 1979:Table 10), and reservoirs in Tarrant County (Mauldin
1972:15), as well as rivers outside Texas (Cummins 1994:Fig. 5).

It should also be noted that Amblema plicata and Megalonaias nervosa are closely
related (Mulvey et al. 1997:Fig. 1), and A. plicata specimens closely resemble smaller
versions of Megalonaias. Juvenile Megalonaias individuals could easily be mistaken for
A. plicata (however, Raymond Neck has examined the mussels from the bench deposits
and checked my identifications). Morphological differences between the two species are
discussed by Howells, Neck and Murray (1996:82).
Habitat Preference: Cosmopolitan, occurs on most substrates except deep shifting sand, at
water depths of 2.5 cm to 1.5 m, current velocities 0-45.7 cm/second in creeks, rivers,
and lakes. This species is a habitat generalist. It can tolerate stranding (Waller, Rach and
Cope 1995), droughts and low water quality, but Horne and McIntosh (1979:125) found
it to have less tolerance for low dissolved oxygen levels than other mussel species in the
Blanco River. On the other hand Chen (1998) found that Amblema plicata was better able
to maintain oxygen consumption under poorly oxygenated conditions than other species
which are normally found in faster-flowing, better oxygenated water. Texas populations
are abundant in firm mud and mud-gravel bottom types (Howells, Neck and Murray
1996:34). Horne and McIntosh (1979:Table 1) found them most abundant in the Blanco
River in cobble, gravel and pebble bottoms, less so in sand, and still less so in silt and
mud, but they have been found in soft, thick mud in Minnesota (Imlay 1972) and
Oklahoma (Branson 1982:40). The shell is rather heavy and thick, and the characteristic
ridging adds strength. According to Starrett (1971:298), it is one of the more pollutiontolerant species found in the Illinois River. It was found at average depths of about 77 cm
and 99 cm (weighted by number of specimens) in Lake Gonzales and Lake Wood
(Arsuffi, Whiteside and Perry 1995:Table 1, 2). According to Murray and Leonard
(1962:48) it is found in 2-8 feet of water in Kansas. According to Parmalee (1967:26), it
1279

is usually found in 1-3 feet of water in Illinois, usually in sand and gravel, but tolerating
mud. In the Meramec River basin of Missouri,
A. p. plicata was found in every substrate encountered except shifting sand, and
was most often found in a silt or gravel and cobble substrate. This species was
found in 1 inch to 5 feet of water in standing (0.0 ft./sec. at bottom) to swiftlymoving (1.9 ft./sec. at bottom) water (Buchanan 1980:30).
According to Parmalee and Bogan (1998:63), it has been collected in 30 feet of
water. Miller and Payne (2004) found very high densities of A. plicata in a gravelly shoal
in the Big Sunflower River of Mississippi, a river that elsewhere is slow-moving and
turbid with a silty sand substrate. Density of all species was 235 individuals per square
meter, of which 90% were A. plicata (Miller and Payne 2004:148, 150). Hart (1995)
surveyed mussels in the Otter Tail River in Minnesota and collected 2432 A. plicata. He
reports
Threeridges showed a marked preference for fast (80 cm/s), deep waters (175 cm)
and were rarely found in slow, shallow areas…. Threeridges were found in all
substrate types, with the most suitable areas dominated by gravel substrates (Hart
1995:29).
Population Density: Howells (1996) reports average densities of 7.2 individuals per
square meter in the Guadalupe River between Gonzales and Lake Wood. Horne and
McIntosh (1979:Table 1) report densities of more than five individuals per square meter
in cobble, gravel, and pebble substrates, and less than one per square meter in silt-mud
substrates. Maximum range of density was zero to 6.8 individuals per square meter
(Horne and McIntosh 1979:Table 10). Little and Gentner (1970) report recovering 110
individuals from a pool 5-7 m wide and about 40 m long in the Little Brazos River,
Robertson County. That translates to roughly 0.46 individuals per square meter in a mud
1280

and loose sand substrate. Golightly (1982:Table 5) reports densities of 12.54, 11.31, and
1.51 individuals per square meter from two different sampling localities on the Little
Brazos River. Virginia Mauldin makes the following observation from artificial
reservoirs in Tarrant County:
In water approximately 0.75 meters deep, in an area no more than 2 meters
square, at the base of a small clump of reeds in Lake Worth, at least 300 living
specimens of A. plicata were collected. This density was not observed at any
other time or place, even though at the time this site was discovered, a rather
thorough search was made in the vicinity. I have not found references to similar
distributional patterns in the literature (Mauldin 1972:15).
Vanleeuwen and Arruda (2001) studied several creeks, tributaries of the Neosho
River in Kansas, and found low densities: 0.002 individuals/m2 on Canville Creek, 0.013
individuals/m2 on Flatrock Creek, and 0.021 individuals/m2 on Labette Creek
(Vanleeuwen and Arruda 2001:Table 3). Hart (1995:Table 3) found densities ranging
from zero to 23.48 per square meter in the Otter Tail River. Peltier (2002:Table 2) found
densities ranging from less than 10 to as much as 150-200 individuals per square meter in
the Sunflower River in Mississippi, at depths of one to 2-3 meters, with current velocities
ranging from 10 cm/second to 25-35 cm/second. Timed collections of A. plicata with
snorkel gear in Oklahoma have recovered anywhere from zero to 168 individuals per
hour ( Vaughn 2003:Table 1). In the Midwest, Amblema plicata has been classified into a
distinctly deepwater form, A. plicata peruviana, and a shallow-water form, A. plicata
costata (Murray and Leonard 1962:47-50, Plate 7) and Warren (1991:Table 1) follows
this classification in his quantitative analysis of habitat scores, but the distinction is not
recognized in Texas.
Size and Age of Contemporary Individuals: Maximum shell length reported for Texas is
14.8 cm but has been reported up to 18 cm in Missouri (Howells, Neck and Murray
1281

1996:34). Other maximum reported sizes are “seldom exceeds 170 mm” (Parmalee and
Bogan 1998:62); “to 17.2 cm” (Couch 1997:27); “adults commonly 1 to 7 inches long”
(17.8 cm, Buchanan 1980:30); “to 7 inches (17.8 cm)” (Cummings and Mayer 1992:40);
and 15.6 cm in Canada (Clarke 1973:35-36). Maximum length in Arkansas has been
reported at 13.80 ± 4.21 cm for the White River but only 8.70 ± 0.78 cm for the Ouachita
River (Christian et al. 2000:Table 2). Shells reaching the largest of these maximum sizes
represent exceptionally old individuals. An individual 14.8 cm long might conceivably be
well over 30 years old. The largest size for immature individuals is 4.40 cm according to
Haag and Staton (2003Table 1), or 3.40 cm for males (three years old), according to Stein
(1969). Females 5.20 cm long (four years old) were reproductively mature.
Table 9.5 shows length statistics for Amblema plicata from various parts of the
central United States. Length, width (“height”) and thickness (“depth” or “inflation” in
some of the literature) can all be measured, but most of the biological literature reports
only length. For fragmented archeological specimens, single-valve thickness is often the
only measurement that can be made accurately, but it is difficult to find any comparable
measurements in the biological literature. The upper part of Table 9.5 lists a few
individual specimens from the Berger Bluff catchment and the Guadalupe River. Most
are too damaged for meaningful comparison. The lower part of the table lists length
means, standard deviations, median, range, and sample size for various contemporary
populations. Some of these collections are from lakes, and others from rivers. Although
riverine species are said to be larger and heavier than those of natural lakes (Parmalee
and Bogan 1998:21), within a single species living in both habitats, freshwater mussels
from stable lakes perhaps live longer, grow to a larger size, and have lower mortality
rates than those from rivers, even rivers that are not flood-prone. Some collections have
1282

also been affected by commercial musseling activity, which tends to reduce average
length.

The largest mean lengths in the table are from Lake Gonzales, the Neosho River,
the Chippewa River and Red River of North Dakota and Minnesota, but the most useful
data sets in this table are the geographically close samples from Lake Gonzales, Lake
Wood, and the Guadalupe River between Lake Wood and the city of Gonzales (Arsuffi,
Whiteside and Perry 1995; Howells 1996). For Lake Wood and Lake Gonzales, the mean
length for the combined data sets is about 10 cm, with some old, large individuals
ranging up to 13 cm in length (Fig. 9.3). The mean length for Guadalupe River specimens
is 8.15 cm (with the largest examples over 10 cm long). All three of these populations
have experienced commercial mussel harvesting at some point in the past. The
Guadalupe River specimens are probably more representative of the size to be expected
in Coleto Creek than are the collections from lakes, even though the Guadalupe River is a
much larger stream than Coleto Creek.
There are limited data on average weight of the species. Chen (1998:22) reports a
mean individual weight of 192.44 ± 8.23 g (n = 15), evidently including the shell. Peltier
(2002:Table 3) reports average dry tissue weights of 11.32 ± 5.9 g, 14.62 ± 7.1 g, and
12.69 ± 4.5 g for Amblema from three different sampling stations on the Sunflower River.
Howard (1999:104-105) measured an average dry tissue weight of 22.6 mg per milliliter
of internal shell volume and an average caloric content of 4.48 x 103 cal/g.

ESTIMATED SIZE AND AGE OF AMBLEMA PLICATA FROM THE BENCH
Table 9.6 shows estimated lengths for Amblema plicata specimens from the bench
deposits. Three were extracted from the cutbank, and the rest derive from the
excavations. There are several intersecting levels of uncertainty built into this table. Some
specimens are definitely A. plicata, while others are probably A. plicata, but cannot be
definitely identified. Some lengths are based on field measurements (to the nearest half
centimeter) taken while the valve was still in situ and their accuracy depends on how
careful the fieldworker was. Some lengths are based on measurements of cleaned and
curated specimens in the lab, and their accuracy depends on how much edge loss
occurred during excavation and cleaning. Still others (and these include the largest
specimens) were obtained for badly fragmented specimens by comparing the remaining
part to a graded series of modern comparative specimens of known length. This last
technique has limited precision, but I feel it is about as accurate as the other two
techniques. In most cases, it was possible to obtain a fairly good match with a modern
specimen by carefully observing edge curvature and relative size of pseudocardinal teeth.
Field measurements of length are invariably greater than measurements repeated in the
lab, indicating some loss of specimen edge during excavation and removal.

Table 9.6 shows that all except two or three specimens are adults, and most are
rather large adults. About 11 specimens are above the median length for modern
Guadalupe River examples and at least six are about 11 cm long, which is larger than the
largest Guadalupe River specimens (but not those from Lake Wood or Lake Gonzales).
Clearly, these are large adults – not record length, but larger than the mean size for many
of the contemporary populations listed in Table 9.5.

1287

Allometric relationships for freshwater mussels are usually estimated with von
Bertalanffy growth curves of the form
Lt = L∞ - (L∞ - L0) * exp (-kt)
where
Lt = length at specified time
L∞ = maximum adult length
L0 = length at birth
k = a growth constant
These growth curves can be created for contemporary populations when both the
length and age (usually from counting growth rings, but sometimes from mark-andrecapture studies) of each individual in a large sample are known. In Figure 9.4, I have
created von Bertalanffy growth curves for Amblema plicata length using the parameters
L∞, L0, and k estimated by Christian and others (2000:Table 2) for Amblema plicata from
the White River and Ouachita River in Arkansas. As the figure shows, the growth
trajectories are different in the two river basins, with White River Amblema having faster
adult growth. Nevertheless, if the curves can be approximated to Coleto Creek, at least a
rough estimate of the ages of the bench specimens can be read from this graph. The
White River curve suggests that 11 cm long specimens should be about 19 years old (the
Ouachita River curve does not apply because it does not rise much over 8 cm).
Specimens 7 cm long should be 9-12 years old, depending on which curve is used. This
technique can be used to find estimated ages for all the specimens with known lengths
(Table 9.6).
Obviously, this procedure incorporates a lot of uncertainty, both in estimating the
length of the archeological specimens and in using modern growth parameters from
Arkansas. The parameters from Arkansas themselves have large uncertainties attached
1288

(for example, L∞ for the White River is 137.96 ± 42.10 mm). Another possibility would
be to use the data from the Guadalupe River, or Lake Wood and Lake Gonzales, and fit a
von Bertalanffy curve to those data, but I am not sure the results would be any more
applicable to Coleto Creek than the White/Ouachita River data. At best, the Arkansas
data applied to the archeological shells from Berger Bluff allow a rough ballpark estimate
of individual age. Figure 9.5 shows another set of allometric data from the Illinois River,
a large river with commercial musseling activity. The growth curve is almost identical to
that for the White River.

Megalonaias nervosa (Washboard), 1 specimen (Fig. 9.6, 9.7)
Also termed Megalonaias gigantea in the older literature, the Washboard (or
Giant Washboard) is the largest North American freshwater mussel. This specimen is a
fragment of a moderately large adult left valve. It was collected from stratum 2A in the
cutbank in the excavation area and evidently was fragmentary when found. The part that
survives is the umbo portion, the thickest-walled part of the shell. It is extraordinarily
thick, about 2.40 cm in wall thickness, which seems to be considerably thicker than
1291

modern valves estimated to be of comparable length collected from the Guadalupe River.
The much thinner posterior part of the shell is missing. From examination of what
survives, this appears to be a very massive, robust valve, even more so than
contemporary specimens. It seems to compare best to a recent specimen 17 cm long
collected from the Guadalupe River.

specimen (left valve) from Guadalupe River. B, fragment of left valve from
stratum 2A in cutbank, Berger Bluff bench.
1292

Figure 9.7. Lab Sketch of Megalonaias nervosa Valve.

This specimen seems out of place in the Coleto Creek drainage, because
Washboards are most often found in deep water in large rivers (although there are
exceptions -- see habitat data below). Perhaps because of this, they are less common in
archeological middens than many other species. Two of these (out of 701) were found at
the Smith Creek Bridge site (Howells 2002:Table 68). Because the Smith Creek Bridge
1293

site is much closer to the headwaters of the drainage system, it is very difficult to
envision Smith Creek supplying any pools large or deep enough to support Washboards.
At present, Smith Creek is only a few centimeters deep, and it cannot have been much
deeper prehistorically. A more likely scenario is that both specimens were imported
overland from the Guadalupe River by the site’s inhabitants. The same argument applies
to Berger Bluff, although here the site is much farther down the drainage and the
potential for deep pools is greater. The channel was deeper here in the Late Pleistocene,
and perhaps even until the Late Prehistoric (see discussion in Chapter 4), but was it deep
enough to sustain a population of Megalonaias nervosa, or was this specimen also packed
in from the Guadalupe River, either overland or upstream? The species has also been
reported from the Payton Branch site (Huebner 1997:20), located at the confluence of
Payton Branch and Perdido Creek on the south side of Coleto Creek Reservoir.
Post (1982) performed proximate analyses of M. nervosa tissue to evaluate it as a
meat source. His data indicate an average meat weight of 119.88 ± 34.89 g (range, 71.71185.44 g; Post 1982:Table F-1). The meat contained an average of 84.41% moisture,
6.29% protein, and 0.65% crude fat, but when converted to dried flour, contained
40.71% protein and 3.70% crude fat (Post 1982:128). He also analyzed fatty acids that
could possibly be used to recognize a signature for meat residues in archeological
deposits (dominant fatty acids were C16:0 and C16:1).

Because this is usually a deep-water species, it may sometimes be difficult to
collect live by wading or diving, but shells are sometimes exposed on sandbars by
flooding in larger rivers -- and because the shell is so massive, it was probably often
collected as raw material for artifacts by prehistoric foragers. Small numbers of
1294

Megalonaias shells in archeological sites distant from deep-water habitats may indicate
collection and long-distance transport as raw material, rather than food remains, and that
scenario may be relevant to the specimen from the bench deposits (see Theler 1991:325;
Shaw et al. 1998:1591). Long-distance transport of shellfish as foodstuff (rather than
artifact raw material) up to 12 km has been documented in Australia by McNiven (1992).
At Choke Canyon Reservoir, Megalonaias nervosa was recovered from 14 sites
investigated in Phase 1. Most sites produced only one or two specimens, but four were
recovered from 41 MC 72, and 13 from 41 MC 15 (Murray 1982:554). Small numbers of
the species have also been recovered from the Wilson-Leonard site (Shaw et al.
1998:Table 37-14), from five sites investigated at O. H. Ivie Reservoir (Treece et al.
1993:Table 9.10), from Bear Creek Shelter (Lynott 1978:Table 16), from the McKenzie
site (Neck 1987:Tables III.2, III.4, III.6), from 41 DT 59 (Fullington 1995; Todd
2000:Table 1), and from the Scott site in Oklahoma (White 1977:Table 1). A very
unusual and remarkable record of Megalonaias use comes from Early Archaic context at
two sites on the Concho River (215 valves, or MNI = 111 at 41 TG 307; 228 valves, or
MNI = 121 at 41 TG 307; Lintz 1996:Table 6). One of the Megalonaias specimens from
O. H. Ivie Reservoir comes from Cultural Unit 6 (thought to be Late Paleoindian in age
by the investigators) at the Turkey Bend Ranch site (Treece et al. 1993:231-232). The
contemporary distribution of the species is similar to that of Amblema plicata, except
restricted in Texas mostly to river reaches east of the Balcones Escarpment (see map,
Howells, Neck and Murray 1996:83). The early Holocene archeological specimens from
the Concho River/upper Colorado River area are far beyond the present range of the
species. This is undoubtedly a significant indicator of major hydrological changes since
the early Holocene. Metcalf (1982:46-47, 51, Table 1) reports finding this species in Late

1295

Pleistocene sites (including one with an assay of 13,620 ± 300 RCYBP on shell) in Eddy
County, New Mexico. The range also extends into Nuevo León.
Habitat Preference: Howells, Neck and Murray describe the habitat preference of M.
nervosa as follows:
Washboards typically occur in large, low-velocity, deep rivers on mud or
gravel…. Neck [1982b] indicated washboards require 6.1-22.4 m depths and
Murray and Leonard (1962) did not collect the species at depths less than 1.8 m.
However, several individuals were taken in Lake Wood and Lake Gonzales,
Gonzales County, Texas, at 0.9-1.2 m, and the species was found abundant in the
Little Brazos River at 0.3-0.9 m in depth, though such occurrences are atypical.
Though typically a large-river species, washboards can adapt to conditions in
some reservoirs. Buchanan (1980) reported the species from silt, gravel, cobble,
or mixed cobble and boulders in standing to moderately fast (45.7 cm/second)
waters. Williams and Schuster… found washboards in the Ohio River at depths
greater than 18 m (Howells, Neck and Murray 1996:81).
Murray and Leonard (1962:44) list the habitat as “quiet places in muddy bottoms in large
streams having deep water.” In the Meramec River basin, Buchanan (1980:25) reports
M. nervosa most commonly occurred in a silt, gravel and cobble or cobble and
boulder substrate or some combination of the three. This species was found in 1
inch to 5 feet of water in standing (0.0 ft./sec. at the bottom) to moderatelyflowing (1.5 ft./sec. at the bottom) water.
Post (1982:Table F-1) recovered specimens from the Tennessee River in 15-25
feet (4.6-7.6 m) of depth. Washboards can evidently be fairly abundant in favorable
habitats, but may be found in fewer places than other species. For example, Littleton
found them at only six of 37 stations on the Navasota River, in mud and gravel bottoms at
depths of a few centimeters to one meter (Littleton 1979:38, Table 2). In contrast, A.
plicata was found at 11 stations. A survey of Neosho River tributaries in Kansas yielded

1296

the species at only one out of 40 stations, compared to five for A. plicata (Vanleeuwen
and Arruda 2001:Table 2).
Population Density: Howells (1996) reports average densities of 2.0 individuals per
square meter in the Guadalupe River between Gonzales and Lake Wood. Golightly
(1982:Table 5) reports densities of 0.20 and 0.75 individuals per square meter from two
different sampling efforts at one locality on the Little Brazos River. Vanleeuwen and
Arruda (2001:Table 2) report a density of 0.002 individuals per square meter on Cherry
Creek in Kansas. Starrett (1971:Table 8) reports that significant numbers could be
retrieved in very short periods of fishing from boats with crowfoot dredges in the Illinois
River in 1966. Other reports from the upper Mississippi River suggest densities up to 7.6
per square meter. Dawley (1947) found them only in large rivers in Minnesota.

Size and Age of Contemporary Individuals: Specimens in Texas commonly reach lengths
of 20-23 cm (Howells, Neck and Murray 1996:81). Parmalee and Bogan (1998:160)
report 25 cm for Tennessee, and the largest confirmed length is apparently about 28 cm
(Cummings and Mayer 1992:24; Howells, Neck and Murray 1996:81). Very large
individuals like these would be very old, since Starrett (1971:Table A-11) reports an age
of 26 years for individuals 16.7 cm long. Woody and Holland-Bartels (1993:60) report
the following percentages of reproductively mature adults at various ages: 4 years (0%), 5
years (17%), 6 years (27%), 7 years (56%), and 8 years (93%).
Howells (1995) measured 18 specimens from the Guadalupe River between
Gonzales and Lake Wood, and found an average length of 13.26 ± 1.32 cm (range, about
11.4-15.2 cm). Table 9.7 shows measurements for individual specimens (mostly
unprovenienced) in the TARL comparative collection, from two lots collected at the
1297

confluence of Carlisle Creek and the Guadalupe River, near Cuero, De Witt County, and
for three specimens from Lake Gonzales. The few measured larger collections that I
could find listed are also shown. Most Texas specimens seem to average less than 15 cm
in length, usually ranging between about 11 and 18 cm for adults.

Woody and Holland-Bartels (1993) studied M. nervosa in the upper Mississippi
River and found individuals ranging in age from three to 34 years and ranging in length
from 3.1 to 16.1 cm. They defined the relationship
length = 6 + 30 * logn (age)
This function (Fig. 9.8, top) yields an age of almost 40 years for an individual 17
cm long, perhaps implying slower growth for these more northerly populations. A
logarithmic function fitted to Starrett’s Illinois River data (Fig. 9.8, bottom) yields an age
estimate of about 22 years for an individual 17 cm long. A von Bertalanffy curve (not
shown) fitted to parameters estimated from Ouachita River data (Christian et al.
2000:Table 2) yields an estimate of about 23 years for an individual 17 cm long.
If the length estimate (17 cm) for the very incomplete Berger Bluff bench
specimen (based on comparison with a modern valve) is reasonably accurate then it
probably represents an individual 22-23 years old or younger (but probably no younger
than 14) at death. Like the Amblema plicata specimens, this individual was probably
larger than the mean size for contemporary populations, but smaller than the
contemporary maximum length. If the growth rate for more northern populations (like
those shown in the top part of Figure 9.8) is more appropriate for a Younger Dryas-aged
specimen, then this individual may be even older.

Quadrula apiculata (Southern Mapleleaf), 1 specimen (Fig. 9.9)
Until recently, the Southern Mapleleaf has not been recognized as a separate
species. In the older literature, it was considered a subspecies of Quadrula quadrula, so
there are not many published descriptions relating specifically to this taxon. The exterior
surface of the shell is distinctive, as it is covered with small bumps (“pustules”). The
Berger Bluff specimen was found in the cutbank, possibly at the same level as stratum
2A, somewhat over 20 m downstream from the excavation area. The location is well
away from the bench area, but inside the limits of the site as mapped on the blufftop. This
specimen was identified by Raymond Neck as a Q. apiculata right valve.

Quadrula apiculata has been found in small numbers at various archeological
sites such as Rice’s Crossing (Howells 2003), 41 TR 174 (Lintz 2004:Table D-1), 41 DL
270 (Anthony 1994), the McKenzie site (Neck 1987), 41 ML 195 (Gardner 2002), 41
MM 340 and 41 MM 341 (Howells 2001), the Hurricane Hill site (Zimmerman 1999),
and various sites at Stacy Reservoir (Seay 1989) and Fort Hood (Gardner 2003). They
were recovered in moderate numbers at various sites at O. H. Ivie Reservoir, mostly in
Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric context (Treece et al. 1993:Table 9.10). Two
specimens were recovered from the Smith Creek Bridge (Howells 2002:Table 68) and as
noted earlier, one specimen was seen in the lots examined from the upper deposits at
Berger Bluff.

At present, the species is widely distributed across most of the eastern two-thirds
of Texas (see map in Howells, Neck and Murray 1996:107), extending into northern
Mexico and parts of the southeastern United States.
1301

Habitat Preference: Quadrula apiculata is sometimes an associate in beds of Threeridges
and Washboards. It occurs in either flowing or still water, in various substrates – mud,
mud/gravel, mud/sand, and mud/gravel/cobble – down to depths of 4.6 m, but often much
less (Howells, Neck and Murray 1996:106). Parmalee and Bogan (1998:210) report it is a
large-river and lake dweller. Densities up to 30 individuals per square meter were found
at Cedar Creek Reservoir (Howells, Neck and Murray 1996:106).

Falcon Reservoir; B, archeological specimen from cutbank at Berger Bluff.

According to Neck (1982a:173), both Quadrula apiculata and Amblema plicata
can survive well in poorly oxygenated water.

Sphaeriid Clams and Peaclams (24 specimens; Fig. 9.10)
Sphaeriid clams (or fingernail clams) and peaclams are diminutive bivalves only a
few millimeters in diameter. Although they look like juvenile freshwater mussels, both
are members of the family Sphaeriidae (or Pisidiidae in some sources) rather than the
family Unionidae. Because the adults are smaller than quarter-inch mesh, they are usually
recovered only when fine-mesh screening of alluvial sediments is done, and because they
are often associated with small aquatic and terrestrial snails in fine-screened matrix
samples, they are often more likely to be treated in the “snail chapters” rather than the
“mussel chapters” of archeological reports. None of the specimens from the bench
sediments have been identified beyond the family level, although I offer some possible
generic identifications in Table 9.8. Under conventional taxonomy, peaclams have been
represented by the genus Pisidium (five species in Texas) and tend to be even smaller
than sphaeriid clams, while fingernail clams are represented in Texas by two genera,
Musculium (three species) and Sphaerium (one species, Sphaerium striatinum). However,
Lee (2001) has recently revised the taxonomy and presumably the peaclams would now
be considered Cyclocalyx. Most of the specimens from the bench are well preserved and
could probably be identified to species level by a specialist, but correct identification
requires specialized knowledge. Specimens from the bench were recovered by three
methods: 1) occasional examples fortuitously found on the 1/4-inch screen, 2) specimens
picked from N109 E96 bulk matrix screened on fine mesh, 3) specimens recovered from
the N110 E102 snail matrix column and identified by Raymond Neck.

Figure 9.10. Peaclam (?) (Cyclocalyx?). Exterior and interior views of the same specimen
from N109 E96 (92.15-92.10 m), stratum 2A bulk matrix.
Because fine screening of archeological sediments is becoming more common,
fingernail clams and peaclams are now reported in some of the more recent literature.
Examples have been found at the Aubrey site (Neck 2001:Table 7.1), Lubbock Lake
(Pierce 1987:Table 6.2), Rex Rodgers (Fullington 1978:108-109), 41 DL 270 (Neck
1994:Table 18), Hinojosa site (Murray 1986), Rush site (Quigg and Peck 1995:Table
5.21), Headstream site (Boyd et al. 1993:75), and in Oklahoma, the Burnham site (Theler
2003a, b). Both the Leon Creek and Medina paleosols at the Richard Beene site have
produced a single example of Pisidium (Cyclocalyx) casertanum (Neck 1992:Table 3).

Habitat Preference: Sphaeriid clams live in ponds, swamps, creeks and larger
streams. Sphaerium striatinum is cosmopolitan, living in perennial water bodies in
various bottom types. Many of the peaclams can be found in deep water [up to 35-40 m
for P. (Cyclocalyx) casertanum] and on mud or sand bottoms. In Pennsylvania springs, P.
1305

casertanum is mostly confined to silty bottoms (Glazier and Gooch 1987:41). Sphaerium
occurs more often in faster current and coarser bottoms, while Musculium is intermediate
in preference (Dillon 2000:29), but in general, silty pools are preferred over riffles
(Dillon 2000:28-29). The Sphaeriidae have much shorter lifespans than the long-lived
unionid mussels. Thomas (1963) studied Sphaerium (Musculium) partumeium in a
temporary pond and found it had a lifespan of 12-13 months, with the population
persisting despite seasonal drying of the pond. She attributes this to environmental
hardiness, rapid growth under favorable conditions, and “precocious production of
young” (Thomas 1963:42; Way, Hornbach and Burky 1980). P. (Cyclocalyx) casertanum
normally produces one or two generations per year, but may perhaps live as long as five
years in cold, poorly oxygenated, unproductive habitats (Burky 1983:300-301. About 15
embryos on average are produced (Heard 1964). Densities as high as 10,000 per square
meter have been recorded for fingernail clams in the upper Mississippi River.
Peaclams and Sphaeriid Clams from the Bench Deposits: All of the Sphaeriidae are so
small and lightweight that they can easily be transported by floodwaters, even into the
distal parts of floodbasins. A flood event could be expected to disperse specimens widely
over the floodplain. Small numbers of specimens (usually one or two valves) were found
in most of the levels from N109 E96 for which bulk matrix was picked, suggesting that
these diminutive clams were probably widely dispersed as clasts throughout the site, but
not concentrated in any one area, unlike the unionid clams. Most of the bench specimens
look as though they may be examples of Cyclocalyx and have a shell length of 3 mm or
less, although that identification is tentative. Peaclams usually average about 2-4 mm in
length (Wu 1978:Tables 4-9). One specimen has been definitely identified as Pisidium
(Cyclocalyx) by Robert Howells. There are also a few examples that may be Sphaerium
1306

or Musculium. Table 9.8 lists known examples. Most come from strata 2B and 2D, but
that is chiefly a function of which lots have been examined. Picking of additional lots
from N109 E96 would undoubtedly add to this inventory.

THE SHELL-BEARING SURFACE IN STRATUM 2A
All along the cutbank in the bench area, scattered mussel shells are visible in
stratum 2A at an elevation of about 92.20 m (shown in Fig. 4.22, but at a scale that is
difficult to see). These clearly lie on a single buried surface whose elevation is fairly
consistent, although the upper contact of the stratum lies anywhere from 6-16 cm above
the surface. Observation of the cutbank profile suggests that the shells are spatially
clustered, with large gaps between clusters of shells, but the clusters occur at a consistent
elevation over a distance of more than nine meters.

Six excavation units penetrated this shell-bearing surface. Two of these units,
N109 E103 and N112 E97, produced no shells, but in the other four, shells were
encountered in the profile walls (Figs. 4.30, 4.33, and 4.34) and excavation floors. A
cluster of seven shells was found on the north side of unit N111 E101, mostly at 92.1792.19 m, and another cluster of five shells was found at the corner where units N112 E99
and N113 E98 adjoin (one shell was removed before it could be plotted). Figure 9.11
shows the distribution of these shells in four of the units and Figs. 9.12 and 9.13 show
some examples in situ.
Unit N109 E96, dug to 92.00 m, was deep enough to have encountered this shellbearing surface, but instead of shells, uncovered the small colluvial fans discussed in
Chapter 4.

1 in Figure 9.11) in southeast corner resting on shell-bearing surface. Scale
is ruled in centimeters.
Because of poor preservation and excavation damage, positive identification of all
these shells was not possible, but all of the specimens that could be identified are fairly
large examples of adult Amblema plicata (Table 9.4). There were no paired or articulated
valves. All but one of the valves shown in Figure 9.11 was found with the concave
interior (or ventral) surface up. Most of the shells drawn on the cutbank profile are also
1311

concave-up. Since this is the hydrodynamically unstable position for the shell (Fig. 9.13;
Brenchley and Newall 1970), it seems unlikely that these shell clusters were formed by
flood deposition. The species most susceptible to flood stranding are lightweight species
like Anodonta (Tucker 1996). Excavation damage also makes it nearly impossible to
determine if any perimortem damage to the shells was present. None of the valves seem
to show any evidence of heat discoloration, although some heat-discolored lateral tooth
fragments were found in the 92.25-92.20 m level of N111 E101. Nevertheless, it is
reasonably certain that this thin scatter of Threeridge valves on the former muddy surface
of the Coleto Creek floodbasin is the result of predation.
In Chapter 4, I pointed out that heavy clastic material had been thrown onto the
floodplain surface later in the history of the bench deposits by a major flood event, but
there are no heavy gravel deposits associated with the mussel shells. In addition to the
Amblema valves, a significant number of small bits and flakes of wood charcoal, some
charred bone, a fired clay nodule, two or three chert or quartz pebbles (possible
manuports), various small animal bone fragments, some Goliad sandstone clasts, a couple
of chert flakes, and a core were found at the same level. The evidence strongly suggests
that all of these shells are present as the result of human predation on a nearby Amblema
plicata shell bed.

Because it is now fashionable in archeology to attribute as many biological
remains as possible in archeological sites to natural rather than cultural origins (cf.
Erlandson and Moss 2001), it is worth asking whether a non-human predator could have
strewn these shells on the stratum 2A surface. Besides humans, the chief mammal
predators of freshwater mussels are rodents (muskrats),
1312

mustelids (minks, otters)

mephitids (skunks) and procyonids (raccoons). Size-selective predation of muskrats
(Ondatra zibethicus) on mussels is well-documented for the southeastern United States.
They are not members of the Carnivora, but are facultative carnivores. Muskrats forage in
mussel beds, taking species roughly in proportion to abundance (Neves and Odom
1989:938), but selectively consuming the larger species and individuals (Diggins and
Stewart 2000). In one study from Alberta, the mussels eaten were significantly larger and
older than those remaining in the mussel beds (Convey, Hanson and MacKay 1989:Figs.
1, 2; Dillon 2000:Fig. 7.1). In another study from Minnesota, muskrats showed a
preference for certain species and certain sizes within a species (medium-sized
individuals were preferred, and the smallest and largest individuals were rejected; Tyrell
and Hornbach 1998). In the Alberta study, muskrats took mostly mussels less than 7.5 cm
long, and in the Minnesota study, most were less than about 8 cm long (modal sizes were
about 3-7 cm). The muskrats pry the valves open with their incisors, scratching the
periostracum and leaving the unbroken valves attached by the hinge ligament (Neves and
Odom 1989:935), or sometimes breaking one of the valves (leaving gnaw marks) and
leaving the other intact (Convey, Hanson and MacKay 1989:655). According to Dillon
(2000:274), thick-shelled species remain unbroken, while thin-shelled species have one
valve broken. Muskrat shell middens (see Parmalee and Klippel 1984:Fig. 2 for a good
photo, in which most of the valves appear to be concave up) are created at the feeding
stations, located “at burrow openings, undercut banks, stumps, logs and snags” (Neves
and Odom 1989:935). The middens are sometimes dispersed by flooding and silted over.
They tend to be small in area, but dense. Muskrat middens recorded in Alberta by
Convey, Hanson, and MacKay (1989:655) were up to one square meter in size, some
containing over a thousand shells, with the local muskrat population consuming 228 ± 24
mussels per day. Neves and Odom (1989:938) recorded one feeding station on the Clinch
1313

River that produced 2080 mussels. Even though muskrats show preferences for certain
species, they do a reasonably good job of taxonomic sampling from shell beds: in the
study by Neves and Odom (1989), 16 species were found in the muskrat middens, and the
study by Tyrell and Hornbach (1998) 11-16 species were found (also see Bovbjerg 1956).
If we consider whether the shell-bearing surface in stratum 2A has the
characteristics of a buried muskrat midden, several factors should be considered. The
present distribution of muskrats is restricted to the northeastern part of Texas, the
Panhandle, and the Pecos and parts of the Rio Grande valleys. Goliad County is well
beyond the present range, although it seems quite plausible that muskrats might have
been present in the Coleto Creek drainage during the wetter, cooler climate of the
Younger Dryas. Raccoons (Procyon lotor), river otters (Lontra canadensis), American
minks (Mustela vison), and striped skunks (Merphitis mephitis) are known mussel
predators whose range includes the study area. Their mussel predation habits are not well
documented. While predation on crawdads and snails is much more common for
raccoons, otters and minks, they will occasionally eat unionid clams (Schoonover and
Marshall 1951:Table 1; Smith, Kennedy and Baumgardner 1987:Table 1; Melquist and
Hornocker 1983:Table 10), but food habits studies show these are very minor items.
Minks will also eat sphaeriid clams (Casson and Klimstra 1983:Tables 1, 2). Although
Amblema plicata is not a common species in areas where studies of muskrat predation
have been done, muskrats take species that are similar in size (such as various species of
Kidneyshell). Small numbers of A. plicata are taken in Minnesota (Tyrell and Hornbach
1998:Table 1). On the other hand, the shell scatter in stratum 2A is much more dispersed,
the shell count is much lower than is typical for muskrat middens, there is no clear
evidence for valve breakage or gnawing, and there are no obviously paired valves.
1314

Furthermore there is clear, if sparse, evidence of cultural debris closely associated on the
same buried surface. The single Megalonaias nervosa valve recovered probably comes
from the same surface. It is too large to have been muskrat prey and was probably broken
before burial.

In my opinion, the stratum 2A shell scatter is more likely to be the result of
human than muskrat predation. The close association of small amounts of cultural debris
is the most convincing argument, and there is also good evidence of human predation (in
the form of smashed valves and heat discoloration) on the same mussel species higher in
the section (mostly in stratum 2D).

MUD DAUBER NEST (1 SPECIMEN, FIG. 9.14)
During removal of overburden, a segment of a mud dauber nest in stratum 3 was
struck with a shovel and split into two halves. The location is shown on Figure 3.1 and is
approximately N113.63 E94.92 (93.20 m). The four-chambered nest segment is relatively
small (4.2 x 4.7 cm) and was evidently unopened and intact before it was struck by the
shovel; however, one side of the segment shows what appear to be four additional
chambers in section, filled with and largely obscured by sediment, so evidently the nest
had been partially broken open before burial. The original nest evidently contained at
least eight larval chambers (if not more), four of which were never exposed and four of
which had been broken open. It is a nest of a Sceliphron species, most likely S.
caementarium (Drury), the most common representative of the genus in Texas (Allan
Hook, personal communication). There is no evidence the adults had emerged from the
nest. This specimen is made of orange-beige silty clay (9YR 6/6) and probably has been
baked, based on the somewhat reddened color. Some areas have a dark gray, carbon1315

stained appearance. It is coated on the exterior with gray (10YR 7/2) carbonate-cemented
sediment and the chambers exposed on the outside (the back side of the section on the left
in Figure 9.14) are filled with gray-brown sediment, presumably from stratum 3.

Figure 9.14. Mud-Dauber Nest, Stratum 3.

Mud dauber nests are probably much more common in archeological contexts
than is generally appreciated. They are found in historic sites where structures were
present, such as Las Cabras in Wilson County (Anne Fox, personal communication) or
Fort Griffin (Olds 1969:95) and in prehistoric sites where structures either may or may
not have been present, like the Belcher Mound (Webb 1959:27), the Spiro site (Rogers
1982:154), the Weston site (Howard 1970), the Lee site (Richards 1971), the RobinsonSolesbee site (Bell et al. 1969:22), the Packard site (Wyckoff 1964:88, Plate XIVA, 1-2),
the Bug Hill site (Vehik 1982:112), the Soc site (Figley 1968:56), the Kersey site
1316

(Marshall 1965:136), the Lepold site (Lynott and Monk 1987:19, 21), the Moccasin Bend
site (Graham 1964:23, 35), the Cow-Killer site (Reynolds 1984:171), Deadman’s Shelter
and Deadman’s Terrace (Hughes and Willey 1978:185, 219), 41 LK 201 (Highley
1986:84; Hall, Black and Graves 1982:386), the Ham Creek site (Forrester 1964:33, Plate
21, H), Peggy Lake (Gadus and Howard 1990:309, Table 74), Coontail Spin (personal
observation of TARL collections, lots 81, 84, 155, 159, 187, 213, and 286), 41 VT 98
(Weinstein 1992:295), and two sites at Cooper Lake (Fields et al. 1993: 131, 216-218).
They have been recovered from some fairly early sites in Texas, such as Hearth 2 at the
Lewisville site (Crook and Harris 1957:58), and the Buckner Ranch site (Nash 2001:Fig.
24). Forty-one nests were recovered from the Wilson-Leonard site, most of them from the
Paleoindian levels (Collins 1998).
In cases where baked nests have been discovered at open sites, it has been
suggested that either they were inadvertently introduced into fires on firewood (Gadus
and Howard 1990:309) or else were intentionally baked and then broken open to extract
the cooked larvae (Wilson 1979). The ethnographic record lends some support to the
latter idea. The Nisenan of California are known to have roasted yellowjacket larvae
(Beals 1933:346). The Paiute cooked and ate yellowjacket and wasp larvae (Heizer
1954:7; Fowler 1989:61), and wasp remains have been found in a human coprolite from
the Tehuacan area of Tamaulipas (Marsh 1964:57).

Because nest construction depends on a ready source of mud, nests are most likely
to be found where springs, seeps, or muddy creek banks lie close to some sort of
protected overhang. Nests can be expected to contain diatoms introduced from the mud
source (Sides 1970), although no such analysis has been attempted here. They can also be
1317

dated by optically stimulated luminescence (OSL; Yoshida, Roberts and Olley 2003),
although that has not been tried, either.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS FOR CHAPTER 9
When the freshwater mussel assemblages from the bench deposits, the Late
Holocene midden in the upper deposits (and at the Smith Creek Bridge site), and the
present-day creek are considered, the differences are striking. The following comments
pertain mainly to the unionid mussels.

The bench assemblage has only three unionid species, dominated by large, old
adult Amblema plicata. All three species (A. plicata, M. nervosa, and Q. apiculata) are
often found in fairly deep water, and though they do not prefer sluggish or turbid water,
can tolerate muddy bottoms and fairly muddy water conditions. Likewise, the peaclams
are often characteristic of deep water and are perhaps more tolerant of turbid conditions
than the fingernail clams, which may be why the peaclams seem to greatly outnumber the
fingernail clams. This is consistent with the evidence presented in Chapter 4 for deeper
water, more equable flow, and higher suspended load characterizing the creek during the
Younger Dryas. Threeridges are particularly tolerant of high suspended loads. Howard
(1999) carried out laboratory research specifically to find out how well Amblema plicata
tolerates muddy water. He examined shell growth, tissue condition, filtering capacity, and
gaping behavior, and concluded that the species is quite tolerant of high suspended
sediment loads (Howard 1999:111).

Many of the mussels in the Berger Bluff bench deposits occur on a buried surface
just below the top of one of the muddy depositional units, presumably representing a
1318

period when the creek carried an especially high suspended load. The unionids, especially
the Megalonaias, are not headwater or temporary pond species – they are characteristic of
the middle or lower reaches of streams. Many of the Amblema plicata individuals may
have been as much as 18-19 years old when they were collected from the creek. This may
indicate that the recurrence interval for major floods was greater than 18-19 years, on the
assumption that severe flooding might disrupt or remove mussel beds and cause
temporary local extirpation. This is consistent with evidence presented in Chapter 4 that
severe flooding was absent until late in the history of the bench deposits [note that all of
the mussels from the bench underlie (and predate) the major flood event discussed in
Chapter 4].

The complete species list for the blufftop midden is unknown, because we only
have an inventory for a couple of lots, but there are at least six species, including two (A.
plicata and Q. apiculata) found in the bench deposits. There are many shells in the
UTSA-CAR collections that have never been washed or inventoried, and a tally of these
would probably add one or two more species to the list. The present list suggests mussels
were collected from more than one habitat. Amblema plicata and Quadrula petrina are
the most abundant species. The latter, restricted to the Guadalupe and Colorado River
basins, is found in mud, sand or gravel in water less than one meter deep (Howells, Neck
and Murray 1996:120). Cyrtonaias tampicoensis and Lampsilis teres are found in slow to
fast water in varying bottom types and can tolerate fairly turbid conditions. Toxolasma
texasensis is a pond, oxbow lake, or creek species found in mud or sand bottoms.
Raymond Neck judged that this assemblage represented “a stream with a coarse substrate
with possibly somewhat greater flow than Coleto Creek during historical times.”
Although the Smith Creek Bridge site is much closer to the headwater region of the
1319

catchment, the Late Holocene freshwater mussel assemblage there is much the same
(seven species), with the addition of Lampsilis hydiana, a characteristic East Texas
species.

The mussel assemblage in the blufftop midden at Berger Bluff is dominated by
small to medium-sized, relatively young individuals that had probably reached
reproductive age within the last year or two. Unfortunately, there are no metric data to
compare to the bench collection, but the difference is readily apparent when sorting the
material, and Raymond Neck confirmed this observation when sorting the two lots he
examined. In contrast to the bench deposits, where many of the Amblema plicata
individuals are up to 11 cm long and might be as much as 18-19 years old, the modal
length for the species in the blufftop midden might be about 4-5 cm long, and perhaps no
more than five years old. According to Neck, the diminution was even more pronounced
for Q. petrina. This same preponderance of small shells has been noted at other sites
(Anthony 1994:274-275; Irwin, Houk, and Drake 1999:77; Howells 2003:148; Peacock
2000:188-191; Peltier 2002:54). Klippel, Celmer and Purdue (1978:268) have also
suggested that A. plicata is dwarfed in lakes or streams with slow-moving water.

In summary, there are more species (and a wider range of habitats) in the Late
Holocene midden compared to the Younger Dryas-aged mussel population, but the
individuals are smaller and younger. What accounts for this difference? I believe there
are both cultural and environmental factors at work. I believe that all of these mussels are
present in the site as a result of human predation, but the collecting effort in the Younger
Dryas/Early Holocene was short in duration and small in scale, yet very selective. In
contrast, during the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric occupations of the site, the human
1320

community size was much larger, occupation of the site was much longer, and the site
was a base camp rather than a foraging locality. Collecting pressure was much more
intense, generating a larger and more diverse sample of

mussels, but preventing

Amblema plicata adults from living much past five years of age. This kind of pressure has
been styled “resource depression” (see discussion in Broughton 2002), and most of the
zooarcheological research concerning its effects on body size and diet breadth have dealt
with vertebrates or marine shellfish (see de Boer, Pereira and Guissamulo 2000;
Broughton 2002; Mannino and Thomas 2002:455). There is also the possibility that
major flood events were more common during the mesic Late Holocene, perhaps also
affecting recruitment of the local mussel populations, and limiting adult size of some of
the species. Flood washouts and intense collecting pressure by human populations may
have acted in concert to limit age and size. Unionid mussels have much longer lifespans
and proportionately much less energetic investment in reproduction than the short-lived,
prolifically reproducing sphaeriid clams, and therefore are more susceptible to localized
extirpation by flooding. The species richness in the midden is probably also inflated by
time-averaging. There is a very large quantity of shell in the upper deposits, representing
a lot of collecting effort, but it may well be that only three or four species were collected
at any one time. Freshwater mussel surveys done in the central and southeastern United
States in the last 50 years show that, on average, about two to seven species can be
expected at any one collecting station or mussel bed in a particular river or creek – but
the variability is very high, and species counts varying anywhere from none to about
three dozen are on record.

As for the modern creek, sampling has been unsystematic except for the preinundation ecological study. Seven species are known, mostly the same as in the Late
1321

Holocene middens at Berger Bluff and the Smith Creek Bridge site, but with the addition
of two thin-walled pond species, Ligumia subrostrata and Utterbackia imbecillis. Aside
from introduced Asiatic clams, Lampsilis teres, Cyrtonaias tampicoensis, and Toxolasma
texasensis appear to be the most common species in the creek today. A pair of Amblema
plicata valves was found on a sandbar at locality D-19 on Smith Creek. These retain most
of the periostracum, indicating that at least a small population of A. plicata survives in
the Smith Creek drainage. This individual is

5.45 cm long, which is probably

comparable to many of the valves in the blufftop midden at Berger Bluff. The appearance
of the pond-dwelling Toxolasma texasensis in both the Late Holocene middens and the
modern channel is interesting. It may indicate the development of deep pools separated
by riffles which largely dry up during the dry season.

The increase in species richness from the bench (three species) to the blufftop
midden (at least six) is significant, but does it register environmental change or cultural
change? When biologists survey aquatic fauna, they use appropriate methods (timed
collections, transects, or quadrats) designed to reveal all the species present, in proportion
to their natural abundance. Betty Meehan’s ethnographic research on Anbarra shellfish
foragers in Australia (Meehan 1982, 1983) shows that certain preferred species are
heavily targeted for collection. The frequency distribution by species resembles a Poisson
curve (Meehan 1982:Fig. 2). On the other hand, she found there was little in the way of
size biasing. Exceptionally small shells were discarded, but otherwise no effort was made
to collect the largest individuals (Meehan 1983:132-134). When extra species beyond the
preferred kind were collected, they were often gotten by children (who had not yet
absorbed the adult search image) or older women who were unable to enter deeper water.
In other cases, storms had washed up a windfall of mixed species, all of which were then
1322

collected. In still other cases, the targeted species was found to be unavailable, so
alternate species were used. Another study of shellfish collecting by Meriam children
also shows that children collect a broader range of shellfish, do less field processing, and
may be more likely to contribute shells to middens than adults (Bird and Bird 2000:471).
All of these characteristics displayed by aboriginal marine bivalve collectors might also
apply to the Late Holocene blufftop midden at Berger Bluff.

Freshwater mussels are very scarce in the archeological record for North
American Paleoindian sites. It is not clear whether this represents genuine lack of usage
or, more likely, poor preservation. There are few sites where mussel shell can easily
survive well for 10,000 years, except perhaps dry shelters. Shell clusters were found in
deposits dated 7000-9000 RCYBP at the Richard Beene site (Alston Thoms, personal
communication). Mussel shell was recovered from the 1959-60 excavations at Levi
Rockshelter; some of it was used for a radiocarbon assay. Lampsilis teres (formerly
Lampsilis anodontoides) was the only species identified (Alexander 1963:513). A single
example of the same species was also found at the Pavo Real site (Brown 2003:272-273).
Some of the most interesting evidence comes from the Lewisville site, where mussel
shell, some of it calcined, was found in or near the hearths (Crook and Harris 1957:28,
29, 34, 58). Amblema plicata, “Quadrula frustulosa (Lea)” (=Quadrula pustulosa?) and
“Fusconaia cf. undata (Barnes)” (=Fusconaia flava) were identified. Another possible
example is the Crockett Gardens site (41 WM 419), about which little is known
(McCormick 1982). A single unidentified mussel shell fragment was recovered from the
Late Paleoindian Occupation Zone 1 at the Armstrong site in Caldwell County
(Schroeder and Oksanen 2002:51). A small sample of mussel shell (six species, mostly
Lampsilis teres, some Toxolasma texasensis, and examples of Arcidens confragosus,
1323

Uniomerus tetralasmus, Potamilus purpuratus, and Quincuncina mitchelli; Shaw et al.
1998:Table 37-14) was recovered from Paleoindian levels at the Wilson-Leonard site.
The only examples of Amblema plicata and Megalonaias nervosa occurred in postPaleoindian deposits. At Dust Cave in Alabama, only a couple of valves are listed in a
preliminary report on the mussel shell (Parmalee 1994:Table 2). Beyond Texas, perhaps
the best record of Paleoindian usage of freshwater mussels comes from the Allen site in
Nebraska, where there are 25 identifiable valves representing six species. Two examples
were calcined and ten others heat-discolored, and one had use wear (Warren n.d.). The
mussel shell here was relatively well preserved, perhaps due to the calcareous nature of
the loessic sediments (Robert E. Warren, personal communication).

Regardless of whether the scarcity of freshwater mussels in Paleoindian sites is a
matter of economics or taphonomy, it is clear that even when mussels are found, at most
sites the samples sizes are small, species richness is low (no more than six species),
specimen condition is often poor, and it is difficult to determine whether cultural
modification of the shell is present. The Turkey Bend Ranch site (41 CC 112) at O. H.
Ivie Reservoir stands out as something of an exception. Here 146 shells representing at
least eight species (including all of the Berger Bluff bench species) were recovered in
Late Paleoindian context (Treece et al. 1993:Table 5.76). In contrast to many of the sites
already mentioned, which seem to emphasize thin-walled pond-dwelling species, this
assemblage includes some deep-water, large-stream species like Megalonaias nervosa,
and over 27% of the shell showed evidence of burning.

The density of mussel shell in alluvial sites varies on a spectrum ranging from the
thick shell middens of the Green River in Kentucky to the shells evenly scattered
1324

throughout the matrix of many Texas sites. The bench deposits lie somewhere toward the
latter end of the spectrum. Clusters or light “discard scatters” of shells on buried
floodplain surfaces have been found at a number of post-Paleoindian sites in Texas. Some
good examples were found at 41 TR 174, on the West Fork of the Trinity River in Tarrant
County. Feature 3 (90 valves, four species), Feature 6 (two clusters 20-25 cm and 40 cm
in diameter, 58 valves, three species), and Feature 8 (234 valves, six species) are
examples of thin scatters without much other associated debris except some charcoal,
baked clay, a few bone fragments, and an occasional hammerstone or debitage (Lintz et
al. 2004:Figs. 20, 21, 27-29). Three examples ranging from a small cluster to an incipient
sheet midden (with shells stacked three or four high) were found at the Gypsum Bluff site
in Coke County (Shafer 1971:Fig. 10). A number of examples were found at 41 DL 270
(straddling the Denton County-Dallas County line) including Feature 3 (one to two shells
thick, 221 valves, nine species), Feature 9 (1.25 by 1.9 m across, 78 valves, eight
species), Feature 10 (0.4 by 1.1 m across, 41 valves, four species), and Feature 29 [1.2 by
1.5 m across, 201 shells, six species (Anthony and Brown 1994:Figs. 54, 55, 58, 59, 64,
74; see also discussion in Anthony 1994)]. Features like these typically contain some
fragmentary bone from deer, turtle, or other species, and occasional debitage or tools.
They appear to be localized dumps for food remains. The examples mentioned, which
range in age from late Middle Holocene to Late Prehistoric, all have greater shell density
and species richness than the more sparse scatter in stratum 2A at Berger Bluff, reflecting
the higher human population sizes and collecting pressure experienced in the second half
of the Holocene. In contrast, I suspect the shell-bearing surface in stratum 2A represents a
single collecting event by a small number of people. Ethnographic studies show most
shellfish collecting is done by women (Claassen 1998:223; Meehan 1982) and children,
and that may well have been the case at Berger Bluff.
