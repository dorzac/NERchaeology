ABSTRACT
In February of 2004, Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) conducted a
Phase I archaeological survey of a drill pad (1.27 acres) and 2.6 miles (12.60 acres) of
pipeline and access road in compartments 70, 72, and 73 of the Sam Houston National
Forest in Walker County, Texas. The Principal Investigator was William E. Moore, and
James E. Warren was the Project Archaeologist. The United States Forest Service
(USFS) project number assigned to this project is 04-04-002. Based on proximity to
floodplain soils (300 meters or less) there are only three high probability areas for
prehistoric sites in the project area. Shovel testing in these areas was negative. One
historic site (41WA272), represented by a scatter of late 19th century historic ceramics,
was found in Area 2 within the project area right-of-way (ROW). The main site area, the
location of a former residence, is outside the ROW in a plowed field and was not
investigated. Ten historic ceramic fragments were collected and analyzed. That portion
of the historic site within the ROW was thoroughly examined and is not worthy of
additional work. The drill pad and most of the route of the pipeline was found to pass
through soils with firm clay at or near the surface. Only two locations contained deep
sandy soil, and one was permeated with gravels. It is recommended that the client be
allowed to proceed as planned. All artifacts found on forest property belong to the
Federal Government and were returned to the USFS for permanent curation.

INTRODUCTION
Prime Operating Company of Houston, Texas plans to construct a drill pad for the
Moneywort Well #1 plus an access road and pipeline in Walker County, Texas (Figure 1).
The project area is located within the Sam Houston National Forest on property owned by
the USFS. The Moneywort Well #1 is 1.27 acres in size and is located within
Compartment 70. It is also found within the N. Hart Davis Survey (A-165) and the Ben F.
Irvine Survey (A-294). The pipeline will connect the well with a proposed well pad and
pipeline 2.6 miles to the east. A 40 foot ROW is proposed. That portion of the pipeline
outside Compartment 70 is located within compartments 72 and 74. The project area is
covered by the 7.5' topographic maps Phelps (dated 1960 and revised by USFS 1997;
map number 3095-423) and Oakhurst (dated 1961 and revised by USFS 1997; map
number 3095-424). See Figure 2 for location of project area on topographic maps. This
project number assigned by the USFS is 04-04-002. The BVRA project number is 04-05.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Walker County is located within the Austroriparian biotic province as defined by
Blair (1950) and includes the Gulf coastal plain from the Atlantic Ocean to eastern Texas.
The western boundary of this province in Texas is approximated by a line running north
from western Harris County to western Red River County. The western boundary of the
Austroriparian is also the western boundary of the main body of the pine and hardwood
forests of the eastern Gulf coastal plain (Blair 1950:99). According to Thornthwaite
(1948), these forests are limited on the west by available moisture.
Flora
The Project Area is located within the loblolly pine, shortleaf pine, and upland
hardwood plant community as defined by the United States Forest Service for the four
National Forests in East Texas. According to Ippolito (1983:6-7), the major forest cover
types in this community include loblolly pine, shortleaf pine, slash pine, post oak, southern
red oak, white oak, black oak, blackjack oak, black gum, sweet gum, American elm, red
maple, hickories, and beech. Approximately 70 percent of East Texas is currently
occupied by the Piney Woods with Post Oak Savannah and Blackland Prairie in the rest
of the region (Boyd and Howard 1988:4). Keller (1974:139-156) believes that deciduous
trees may have been more numerous during most of the Holocene and were probably
more important resources to prehistoric populations than the modern flora would suggest.
Fauna
The vertebrate fauna of the Austroriparian is considered typical of that to the east.
Blair (1950:99) states that at least 47 species of mammals occur or have occurred there
in recent times. Known types include at least 29 species of snakes, 10 lizards, 2 land
turtles, 17 anurans, and 18 urodeles. Ippolito (1983:11) states that there is an inadequate
sample of faunal material for the area in an archaeological context. Therefore,
assumptions concerning prehistoric exploitation of animals must be based on historical
accounts and current populations.
A study by Keller (1974:78-81) of the paleoecology of the middle Neches region lists
those mammals most likely to have been hunted in the area. They are Whitetail deer,
Cottontail rabbit, Swamp rabbit, Grey squirrel, Fox squirrel, Flying squirrel, Raccoon,
Opossum, Red fox, Grey fox, Woodchuck, Bobcat, Spotted skunk, Striped skunk, Mink,
Otter, Long-tailed weasel, and Muskrat. According to Ippolito (1983:11), this list excludes
many species of birds, especially migratory fowl, and fish that can still be found in the
area. Species not found in the area today include Black bear, beaver, and wild turkey.
These were once numerous but were eradicated by uncontrolled hunting and timber
harvesting that irreparably altered their habitats.

The following climatic data were taken from McClintock et al. (1979). The weather
in Walker County consists of hot summers and cool winters. An occasional cold front
may cause temperatures to drop below freezing, sometimes quite suddenly. The average
winter temperature is 51 degrees Fahrenheit with an average daily minimum of 41
degrees. In summer, the average is 82 degrees with an average daily maximum of 94
degrees. The growing season has 234 days above freezing each year. Prevailing winds
are from the south-southeast. Rainfall is uniformly distributed throughout the year and
snowfall is rare.
According to the Soil Survey of Walker County (McClintock et al. 1979:sheets 47
and 48), the three high probability areas within the Project Area are located within two soil
types. They are Depcor-Huntsburg soils (9) and Depcor-Huntsburg-Gunter association,
gently rolling soils (10). Areas 1 and 3 are located within the 9 soils. Area 2 is located
mainly in the 9 soils, but a portion of the area is within the 10 soils.
Depcor-Huntsburg soils (9) are described by McClintock et al. (1979:9-10) as soils
in the uplands on interstream divides. This unit is about 54 percent Depcor soils, 31
percent Huntsburg soils, and 15 percent other soils. Depcor soils consist of loamy fine
sand overlying a sandy clay loam between 44 and 65 inches, while Huntsburg soils
consist of a loamy fine sand overlying a reddish-yellow clay from 22 to 32 inches.
Depcor-Huntsburg-Gunter association, gently rolling soils (10) are described by
McClintock et al. (1979:10) as being located on ridges and side slopes of upland
interstream divides. Slopes are 5 to 10 percent. The Depcor soil is on convex side
slopes between the ridgetops and the more sloping areas adjacent to streams. The
surface layer is a very friable, very strongly acid, brown loamy fine sand about 5 inches
thick. Between 5 and 30 inches is a very friable, very strongly acid, light yellowish-brown
loamy fine sand. From 30 to 35 inches is a firm, very strongly acid, yellowish-brown
sandy clay loam mottled with red. Beyond 35 inches, to 66 inches, is a clay loam. This
soil is moderately well drained, and permeability and runoff are slow. Available water
capacity is medium. The Huntsburg soil is found on plane to slightly concave side slopes
and in the less sloping areas adjacent to streams. It has a surface layer of a very friable,
slightly acid, brown loamy fine sand about 6 inches thick. Between 6 and 14 inches is
loamy fine sand, and from 14 to 22 inches is sandy clay. Beyond 22 inches, to 61 inches,
is clay. The Gunter soil is found in ridge tops and knolls. It has a surface layer of a very
friable, strongly acid, dark grayish-brown loamy sand about 4 inches thick. Between 4
and 48 inches is very friable, slightly acid, loamy sand. From 48 to 60 inches is a sandy
loam, and from 60 to 75 inches is a clay loam.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Although several significant studies involving prehistoric and historic sites have
been conducted in Walker County, most of the site data are based on survey level
studies with little or no subsurface testing. As a result, much of the information for Walker
County is taken from projects in surrounding areas such as Lake Livingston in Polk and
San Jacinto counties (McClurkan 1968; Ensor and Carlson 1988), Lake Conroe in
Montgomery County (McNatt 1978; Shafer 1968; Shafer and Stearns 1975), and the
Gibbons Creek Mine in Grimes County (Rogers 1993, 1994, 1995).
The potential for significant sites with stratified deposits is evidenced by the
presence of lamellae, an indicator of an alluvial entisol that were deposited during
occupation. Walker County sites known to contain lamellae are 41WA47, 41WA85,
41WA94, 41WA104, 41WA105, 41WA185, and 41WA218. Three of these sites have
layered lamellae in profiles of backhoe trenches or excavation units and deep sandy soils.
Four of these sites (41WA47, 41WA105, 41WA185, and 41WA218) appear to have
good artifact stratigraphy. Of these sites, the Storm site (41WA218) has been extensively
excavated, and is the best documented site in Walker County. Good cultural stratigraphy
is evidenced by four radiocarbon dates and a clear separation of artifact types.
Additional studies worthy of mention are Archeology in the Eastern Planning
Region, Texas: A Planning Document compiled by the Department of Antiquities
Protection (Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993); Roger G. Moore's (1995) Ph.D. dissertation
entitled The Mossy Grove Model of Long-Term Forager-Collector Adaptations in Inland
Southeast Texas; Volume 66 of the Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society which
reviews the current state of Archeology in Texas and contains a chapter devoted to
Southeast Texas (Patterson 1995); an archaeological study by the Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department at the Huntsville Fish Hatchery (Davis et al. 1994:20-33); a survey for
the Trinity River Authority by Moore Archeological Consulting (Moore and Moore 1995:612), and testing of the Storm site (41WA218) by Zone Archaeologist Walter Kingsborough
at the Sam Houston National Forest.
The work by Moore Archeological Consulting is particularly noteworthy because of
the database created from encoding site data for all known sites in Walker County at the
time of this project. This database was an attempt to define settlement rules specific to
Walker County through the application of an empirical analysis cross-tabulating site data
with environmental variables and was based, as stated above, on the computerization of
data from all of the existing TARL site records for the county. A total of 181 sites was
used for this study; however the analyses utilized only those sites with prehistoric
components since the sample size for historic sites is inadequate and the settlement
criteria for historic sites location are much different and currently more ambiguous than for
prehistoric sites.
6

This study found that prehistoric sites seem to be found throughout the county
where suitable landforms (sandy ridges and knolls) exist in close proximity to dependable
water sources. The only large concentrations of prehistoric sites are the result of large
area surveys. Single sites along major drainages should not be interpreted as sparse use
of an area; however, they are the type most often recorded by individuals.

7

METHODS
Prior to entering the field the Principal Investigator checked the site records at
TARL on the campus of The University of Texas at Austin for the presence of previously
recorded sites within the project area. No sites were found to be within the boundaries of
the drill site or in the path of the proposed pipeline. A discussion with USFS
archaeologist Walter Kingsborough provided useful information regarding the potential for
archaeological sites in the project area. According to his study, 90% of all recorded sites
within the Sam Houston National Forest occur within 300 meters of bottomland soils.
When the project area was superimposed over a map depicting bottomland soils in the
area, only three areas were determined to be likely settings (Figure 3). These are the
confluence of Boswell Creek and an unnamed tributary (Area 1), a hill overlooking
Boswell Creek (Area 2), and a hill overlooking Briar Creek (Area 3). Although the survey
crew walked the entire area the major emphasis was focused on these three high
probability areas. The subsurface was examined through shovel tests and probes. Six
tests were excavated at the well site (Figure 4), and six tests were excavated at Area 1
(Figure 5). In all, 28 tests were excavated within the project area. All shovel tests were
30 x 50 cm in size and excavated to basal clay or gravel lenses. All excavated earth was
passed through quarter-inch hardware cloth. A shovel test log was kept in the field
(Appendix I). Shovel probes are defined by BVRA as those areas where a shovel was
used to confirm the presence of shallow clay soils. Probes are smaller in size, not
screened, and not depicted on any of the maps in this report.
At Station 91+50, a scatter of historic ceramics within the ROW alerted the survey
crew to the presence of a historic site (Figure 2). They carefully examined the area and
found no foundations, features (i.e., wells or cisterns), or other artifact types. Bricks,
metal (cans), and glass were observed in a plowed field outside of the ROW. All visible
artifacts in the ROW (n=10) were collected for analysis, and the area was given the field
number TS-1. This site was awarded the trinomial 41WA272 by TARL. Following
analysis, the artifacts were returned to the USFS, Sam Houston Ranger District for
curation.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
No prehistoric archaeological sites were found to exist within the project area as
currently planned. The well site and most of the pipeline route was found to be within
soils containing very firm clay at or near the surface. Some areas are located on side
slopes, areas not likely to contain prehistoric sites.
Evidence of historic utilization of the project area was found in two areas. A bridge
with a metal frame and wooden deck was noted at the Boswell Creek crossing. This
bridge is in poor condition and is probably a recent trail bridge constructed by the USFS
(Walter Kingsborough, personal communication). At this point the pipeline will pass
beneath the creek through mechanical boring; therefore, the bridge will not be impacted.
At station 91+50 (Area 2), a scatter of historic ceramics was observed (see
Appendix III). This scatter represents the periphery of a historic site (41WA272) located
in a plowed field to the south. A thorough surface investigation of the ROW did not yield
additional artifacts typically associated with a house site. A cursory inspection of the
plowed field, however, revealed brick, metal, and glass. It is, therefore, believed that the
main site area is out of the ROW as currently planned. Based on a sample of ceramics
(n=10) collected from the surface, this site dates to the late 19th century. Ten vessels are
represented in this assemblage and, except for one all, are utilitarian ware (Appendix II).
It was estimated by the survey crew that the artifacts observed within the ROW represent
only 15% of the total site area. According to Kevin Mundorff, an environmentalist at
Raven Environmental Services, Inc., there was a historic house in the vicinity and is on
property recently acquired by the USFS.
Area 1 was selected as a high probability area based on its location within 300
meters from bottomland soil. It is an elevated landform rising above the confluence of
Boswell Creek and an unnamed tributary of that stream to the south and east. Six shovel
tests revealed very firm gray clay at or near the surface. Much of the area was still
saturated with water from recent rains. This is not a desirable location for a prehistoric
campsite.
Area 2 was selected as a high probability area based on its location within 300
meters from bottomland soil. Most of this area is on a west-facing slope rising above
Boswell Creek. Six shovel tests revealed a deep sandy soil that was still wet due to
recent rains. The deepest tests were terminated at 100 cm, and no artifacts were found
within the right-of-way; however, additional testing outside the right-of-way may produce
different results.

12

Area 3 was selected as a high probability area based on its location with 300
meters from bottomland soil. Most of this area is on an east-facing side slope rising
above Briar Creek. Five shovel tests revealed a deep sandy soil that was permeated with
small to medium gravels. Shovel tests were terminated at 70 cm. This area does not
appear to be a good setting for a prehistoric campsite.
In general, the project area is not a good setting for significant archaeological sites.
Only two areas contain deep sandy soils, and they are mainly on slopes. The best area,
due to its proximity to the confluence of Boswell Creek and a tributary contained only
shallow sand and clay at or near the surface.
The Archeological Survey Standards for Texas states that 16 shovel tests per mile
are considered the minimum number for linear projects. Based on this figure, 41 shovel
tests would be expected for the 2.6 mile pipeline as currently proposed. Because of the
nature of the project area a lesser number of tests was excavated. Factors influencing
this decision were the presence of clay at or near the surface over much of the project
area, past disturbance in some areas, a wet, low-lying area, and the presence of only
three high probability areas based on the model created by Walter Kingsborough.

13

RECOMMENDATIONS
Since no significant archaeological sites were identified within the ROW during this
investigation, it is recommended that Prime Operating Company be allowed to proceed
with construction of the well site and pipeline as planned. If the ROW is changed in the
vicinity of Area 2, additional shovel testing is recommended. If the ROW is moved to the
south at station 91+50 where site 41WA272 will be affected, Walter Kingsborough of the
Sam Houston National Forest must be consulted regarding a plan of action for this
historic site. The wooden bridge is not significant, and no avoidance is recommended for
this structure.
