Introduction

INTRODUCTION
Hicks & Company archeologists conducted pedestrian reconnaissance survey
along approximately 2.15 miles of proposed improvements to Brushy Creek
Road (formerly County Road 174), from Darkwoods Drive to Farm-to-Market
(FM) 734 (Parmer Lane), in the City of Cedar Park, Williamson County, Texas
(Figure 1). The City of Cedar Park, in cooperation with the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) and the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT)
Austin District, is proposing to separate travel lanes to increase travel safety
while improving overall traffic flow within this rapidly-developing area.
Approximately two-thirds of the project funding will come from the City of Cedar
Park, with the other third being provided by the FHWA, and construction will be
performed with TxDOT oversight. To complete the proposed project, the existing
roadway of two 11-foot travel lanes (one in each direction) with seven-foot outer
shoulders would be upgraded to a four-lane, divided major arterial roadway.
The entire project area was visually inspected and photographed and no cultural
resources were observed.

Definition of Study Area

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
In order to complete proposed improvements, the majority of construction will be
limited to Brushy Creek Road’s existing, publicly-owned right-of-way (ROW; see
Figure 1). The existing ROW width varies from 90 to 110 feet; over the full 2.15­
mile project corridor this equates to an area of approximately 26 acres. As part
of this project, 0.34 acres of proposed new ROW currently under private
ownership is required to expand an existing culvert to the north to accommodate
the expanded roadway, while a 10 x 2,500-foot strip of land (approximately 0.6
acres) along the northern ROW west of Vista Ridge Boulevard has been donated
to the project by a private landowner and will be graded and revegetated during
construction. Additionally, an 8 x 9-foot pad will be newly constructed within
an existing 25-foot-wide Public Utility Easement (PUE) on the northwest corner
of Lynnwood Trail and Brushy Creek Road. The City is currently in negotiations
with private landowners to include a 10 x 400-foot long (0.09 acres) proposed
PUE on the south side of the roadway in the vicinity of Vista Ridge Boulevard for
the construction of traffic signal utility lines and a 20 x 60-foot (0.03 acres)
permanent drainage easement immediately southwest of the Vista Ridge
Boulevard and Brushy Creek Road intersection.
Ground-disturbing
construction within the proposed easements is anticipated to be very minor.
The archeological Area of Potential Effect (APE) for the undertaking is defined as
all portions of land with the potential for direct impacts from construction of the
roadway including all portions of the existing and any proposed new rights-of­
way and any permanent or temporary easements utilized during construction.
According to construction schematics/plans available at the time of the permit
application, the APE would consist of the publicly owned, existing Brushy Creek
Road right-of-way (26 acres), the 0.34-acre culvert expansion, the 0.6 acre
donated strip, and the 0.12 acres of proposed easements currently under
negotiations, or a total area of approximately 27 acres. Based on typical
construction and practices design, it is estimated that the depth of impact will
not exceed 12 feet, which, based upon the prevailing physiographic setting (see
below) is well below the maximum depth of potential archeological resources.
According to project engineers, construction was initially planned to extend an
additional 0.38 miles east of Parmer Lane (Figure 1) (as described in the project
Environmental Assessment (EA) and the Texas Antiquities Code (TAC) survey
permit application) however, a reduction in construction budget has resulted in
its current, shorter project terminus at the western edge of the Parmer Lane
intersection.
Archeological survey for this project included only the
archeological APE which also terminates at Parmer Lane.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
Funding for this project is partially provided by the City of Cedar Park and
partially by the FHWA. Federal involvement in the proposed construction
project prompts oversight from the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of
1966, as amended (2004), requiring consideration of important historic,
cultural, and natural aspects of our national heritage. Important aspects of our
national heritage that may be present in the project corridor will be considered
under Section 106 of the NHPA. From a federal oversight perspective, all work
was conducted in accordance with the Programmatic Agreement (PA) among the
FHWA, TxDOT, the Texas Historical Commission (THC), and the Advisory

Definition of Study Area

Council on Historic Preservation. This project also falls under the purview of the
Texas Antiquities Code (TAC), because it involves lands owned or controlled by
the State of Texas or any city, county, or local municipality thereof (City of Cedar
Park). As the project would potentially involve city purchase of proposed
easements, under jurisdiction of the TAC, historic properties will also be
considered under provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
between the THC and TxDOT in support of a National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA) EA that is in production.
Archeological survey was conducted under TAC Reconnaissance Permit #4695.
Right-of-entry was permitted for the entire project APE at the time of survey.
The project area was visually inspected from the existing ROW and surveyed on
foot, supplemented with photographic documentation. No shovel tests were
excavated and no cultural resources were observed within the proposed project
area. The survey was conducted on July 14, 2008 by Hicks & Company project
archeologist Matthew C. Stotts and John Campbell with Mason Miller
functioning as Principal Investigator. Twenty man hours were utilized in
completion of the investigation. Report production took place immediately
following the conclusion of field work. Succeeding sections of the report include
sections on the research design, results of the reconnaissance survey, and
regulatory recommendations.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND RESEARCH
DESIGN
The Brushy Creek Road widening investigation included an initial archival
search to identify all previously recorded surveys, archeological sites, and
historic structures. Background research for this project was conducted using
the THC’s Online Sites Atlas as well as the THC Library and records on file at
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL). According to available
records, a total of six archeological sites lie within, or in very close proximity to,
the archeological APE for the proposed project.
Those sites, 41WM25,
41WM441, 41WM446, 41WM447, 41WM544, and 41WM662, are all located
within 700 feet of the proposed project area. Site 41WM913 is located adjacent
to the original project terminus but is slightly outside of the current study area.
According to available data, there are no State Archeological Landmarks,
cemeteries, or sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places within the
proposed project area.
Sites 41WM441, 41WM544, and 41WM913 are all diffuse prehistoric lithic
scatters identified on the ground surface. These sites have been severely
impacted by plowing, terracing, and subsequent erosion. Sites 41WM446 and
41WM447 are prehistoric campsites consisting of lithic debitage and burned
rock. Site 41WM25 is poorly documented, solely through an inventory listed at
TARL dating to before 1936. Although previous surveys have overlapped the site
boundaries, there is no mention of 41WM25 in documentation. Therefore,
neither the site boundaries nor its integrity are known. Site 41WM662 is a
historic site consisting of architectural elements and an associated artifact
scatter. The NRHP status of sites 41WM25, 41WM446, and 41WM447 has yet
to be determined. The remaining four sites, 41WM441, 41WM544, 41WM662,
and 41WM913, have been recommended as not eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP. Of these seven previously recorded sites, only one (Site 41WM441) is
located immediately adjacent to the current project corridor. The project APE

adjacent to this site area was inspected and the findings will be discussed in
greater detail in the Results of the Reconnaissance Survey section.
A total of eight previously performed archeological surveys were found to
intersect with, or overlap the current project, comprising approximately 96% of
the currently proposed APE. One of these surveys, performed by Lone Star
Archeological Services (LSAS) in 1998 for a previous road improvement project,
was an evaluation of the entire Brushy Creek Road corridor between Darkwoods
Drive and FM 734 (Parmer Lane) (Briggs 1998). Three of the surveys that
intersect the proposed project area preceded the 1998, LSAS evaluation. These
were large areal surveys, performed for the Texas Department of Water
Resources and TxDOT prior to residential development or roadway improvement
projects. Five of the archeological sites described above were located as a result
of these surveys (41WM441, 41WM662, 41WM446, 41WM447, and 41WM544),
conducted between 1980 and 1984 while a 1997 survey for a Lower Colorado
River Authority (LCRA) wastewater interceptor identified 41WM913. These
surveys all noted either eroded surfaces with shallow soils or heavy disturbance
from previous construction in their survey areas. The previously mentioned
LSAS evaluation of the Brushy Creek Road corridor did not identify any evidence
of the previously recorded sites within their survey corridor and documented no
new archeological sites (Briggs 1998). Extensive disturbance noted during this
survey was attributed to agricultural activities, fence building, buried utilities,
and the construction of the Austin and Northwestern Railroad in 1881, which
obliterated many archeological sites. Four later surveys, performed in 2000, and
2001 for the LCRA and the Leander Independent School District found no
archeological sites that could be affected by the currently proposed project.
Due to the large number of previous investigations, the documented
disturbance, and the fact that the required additional ROW is limited to 0.34
acres for reconstructing a culvert (directly within the drainage channel), a 10­
foot by 2,500-foot sliver (0.6 acres) along the northern ROW west of Vista Ridge
Boulevard (disturbed by waterline placement), and two possible easements
within non-site areas, an extremely low potential for intact archeological historic
properties was assumed within the APE for the undertaking. In addition, there
was little potential that archeological survey of the proposed APE would result in
the identification of cultural resources that would positively contribute to known
sites’ NRHP eligibility. Although an intensive, 100% archeological survey was
not warranted to complete Section 106 compliance requirements or
corresponding obligations under the TAC, TxDOT recommended that, given the
number of adjacent sites that could be impacted by the proposed construction,
the project area be inspected to assess the actual extent of disturbance and
minimal potential for impacts to significant historic properties. This would fully
account for the archeological resources that could be affected by the proposed
construction.
As such, Hicks & Company archeologists conducted a linear, reconnaissance
survey of the project area that included a visual assessment of the project APE
supplemented with photographs of typical upland landforms and evidence of
disturbance. Archeologists utilized a combination of windshield survey of the
road’s existing ROW (in non-site areas) and pedestrian inspection (within and/or
adjacent to known site boundaries) to visually assess the entire proposed project
APE and potential impacts to archeological resources. The two areas of
proposed expanded ROW and the proposed easements were visually inspected
on foot. No shovel tests were deemed necessary for thorough inspection of the
area. Survey investigations followed a modified no-collection policy, and more-

over, no historic or prehistoric cultural material was observed. All project
related documents will be permanently held on file at Hicks & Company.
This short report includes a summary of the field investigations, and regulatory
recommendations for further work or no further work based on the requirements
of 13 TAC 26.5(35), 13 TAC 26.20(1), and 13 TAC 26.20(2) and Section 106. Site
investigations and discussions are limited to statements of presence/absence
within the project APE and the overall potential for significant site components
within the construction area.

RESULTS OF RECONNAISSANCE SURVEY
Archeologists found that the entire project area has been disturbed due to the
initial construction of Brushy Creek Road.
Utilities routing, drainage
modification, and erosion have furthered impacts to the existing and proposed
ROW. Investigators began the survey at the eastern project terminus, at the
intersection of Brushy Creek Road and FM 734 (Parmer Lane). The ROW has
been graded and leveled for road construction (Figures 2 and 3). A drainage
ditch parallels the north side of Brushy Creek Road with reinforced concrete and
corrugated steel culverts at each driveway between Parmer Lane and Vista Ridge
Boulevard, approximately ¾ mile to the west. The area of this intersection has
been heavily disturbed and is currently under construction on the northeast
corner (Figure 4). Investigators inspected the proposed new 10-foot utility
easement and 20-foot drainage easement on the south side of Brushy Creek
road and saw no evidence of cultural material. Manholes, stoplight footings,
and the signals’ electrical housing unit are present within the existing ROW
adjacent to the proposed expansion and surface visibility ranged between 50 and
100%. Hardwood and cedar trees are found opposite the ROW fence, with short
grass along the roadside and tall reeds and grasses in the existing culvert
(Figures 5 and 6).

Utilities continue along both sides of the roadway, as evidenced by the
manholes, fire hydrants, transmission line poles, and buried cable warning
signs present (Figure 7). Additionally, the drainage ditch along the north side of
Brushy Creek Road is lined with concrete in this portion of the ROW (Figure 8).
From Vista Ridge Boulevard, the ROW is proposed to be expanded 10 feet to the
north, for a distance of 2,500 feet on land donated to the City of Cedar Park.
This area is on a rising upland hilltop that was cut into for the initial road
construction. Limestone bedrock is exposed over much of the surface and the
absence of soil accumulation is apparent (Figure 9). A cattle crossing at the
location of a paved (former) driveway onto the property, is located on the hilltop

within the proposed ROW expansion (Figure 10). Scattered grasses, cedar and
hardwood trees, prickly pear cactus, and yucca afforded good surface visibility,
between 70 and 100% throughout the area. At the creek crossing location, the
existing roadway has been built up approximately 20 feet. The embankment is
reinforced with concrete and large-diameter corrugated steel pipes direct the
flow of water underneath Brush Creek Road. Water flow has eroded steep cut
banks on the north side of the road (Figures 11 and 12). The cut banks were
directly inspected for cultural material and buried features, but investigators
found only shallow soil and limestone bedrock. The investigators walked
transects through the entire area of proposed expansion and did not observe any
cultural materials.

Approximately 1,750 feet west of the proposed expansion, investigators surveyed
a small existing PUE.
This area has been completely disturbed by the
excavation of an artificial drainage, buried utilities and commercial development
(Figure 13). At the western project terminus, just east of the Darkwoods Drive
and on the south side of the Brushy Creek Road right-of-way, Site 41WM441 is
recorded as another diffuse prehistoric lithic scatter. The ROW between the
southern edge of the roadway and the Southern Pacific Railroad track is covered
with gravel and asphalt, affording approximately 80 to 100% surface visibility. A
school and playground are located on the north side of the road, and industrial

(Figures 14, 15, and 16). Investigators traversed the area on foot, but found no
signs of the site within the project area.

Conclusions and Recommendations

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Hicks & Company archeologists surveyed approximately 2.15 miles of proposed
improvements to Brushy Creek Road (formerly CR 174), between Darkwoods
Drive and FM 734 (Parmer Lane), in the City of Cedar Park, Williamson County,
Texas. The reconnaissance survey involved pedestrian survey supplemented
with field notes and photographic documentation of the project area. No
cultural material was encountered on the surface and no shovel tests were
excavated. Surveyors documented gently rolling topography, characterized by
heavy disturbance and a general absence of soil within the project area. Much
of the area adjacent to Brushy Creek Road is significantly modified and
disturbed by previous road construction, railroad construction, utilities routing,
and residential and commercial development.
Based on the results of investigations, it is the opinion of the Principal
Investigator that the proposed undertaking will have no impact on archeological
historic properties within the project area. It is recommended that the proposed
project within the archeological APE (see Figure 1) should be allowed to proceed
to construction, relative to the requirements under Section 106 of the NHPA and
the Antiquities Code of Texas. Since this survey resulted in a “no find” of
cultural materials or sites, project-related documents will be maintained at
Hicks & Company offices in Austin. This report is offered in partial fulfillment of
TAC Permit #4965.
