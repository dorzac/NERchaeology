Dating the Upper Toyah Component at Rowe Valley
(41WM437) Or Establishing A New Temporal Context
for Subsistence and Site Use at Rowe Valley
Haley E. Rush, Elton R. Prewitt, C. Britt Bousman, and Leslie L. Bush

ABSTRACT
The Rowe Valley site (41WM437) is a large-scale Toyah phase campsite on the southern bank of the San
Gabriel River in eastern Central Texas. It has an artifact assemblage typical of Toyah sites that includes Perdiz
and other arrow points, unifacial scrapers, bifacial knives, ceramics, and bison remains. Although bison remains can dominate the faunal assemblages of Toyah sites, at Rowe Valley the majority of the faunal remains
examined are deer and antelope. Part of the dominance of the faunal assemblage by these ungulates is likely
due to differential hunting strategies employed for different-sized animals. Charcoal from eight features was
radiocarbon-dated; the results show there were at least two significant occupations pre-dating Spanish movement into Central Texas. These dates and the results of other limited studies combine with observations from
the excavations to support characterization of Toyah people as focused hunter-gatherers who often lived and
hunted in large groups.

INTRODUCTION
The latter part of the Late Prehistoric period of
Central Texas or the Toyah phase is distinguished
from the earlier Austin phase by a distinct set of
artifacts that appear at or near A.D. 1300 or 650
radiocarbon years before present (B.P.) and spread
rapidly across Central and South Texas (Arnn 2012;
Collins 2004; Johnson 1994; Kenmotsu and Boyd
2012a, 2012b; Prewitt 1981, 1985). The Toyah
phase continues until approximately 250 B.P. or
A.D. 1700. A unique lithic toolkit is part of the
distinct set of artifacts; this toolkit includes Perdiz
arrow points, beveled bifacial knives, unifacial
blade end scrapers, and the common use of blade
core technology for the production of flake blade
tools. Ceramics are also included in this distinct
artifact assemblage. Ceramics generally occur in
low numbers compared to other artifact types at
Toyah sites, but this is the first time pottery appears
in the archeological record in Central Texas and
its presence helps to distinguish the Toyah phase
from previous and coeval cultural entities. The
nature of this complete tool kit is believed to reflect
a heavier reliance on hunting than in the preceding Austin phase (Arnn 2012:52-56; Black 1986;

Johnson 1994:241-242; Ricklis and Collins1994:9;
Kenmotsu and Boyd 2012a). A widely held belief is
that the adoption of the Toyah lithic toolkit was due
to a shift in focus from hunting and gathering to a
greater reliance upon hunting. This supposition was
supported by the fact that during early excavations
of Toyah phase sites it was often noted that these
materials occurred with bison remains, which are
unknown in Austin phase contexts. Other notable
characteristics include rare maize remains (Jelks
1962; Harris 1985; Holloway 1988) and evidence
of living surfaces and possible structures (Black
1986; Johnson 1994; Kenmotsu and Boyd 2012a;
Prewitt 1981).
Dillehay (1974) was among the first who
assessed the presence and absence of bison at
archeological sites in Texas over nearly a 12,000
year period. His conclusions placed the Austin
phase in a bison absence period and the Toyah
phase in a bison presence period, thus supporting
the hypothesis that the change in technology from
the Austin phase to the Toyah was a response to
bison. Dillehay attributed the movements of bison
into Central and South Texas to climatic changes.
Others (Baugh 1986; Lynott 1979) found that
bison were present during the parts of the Late

Prehistoric period that Dillehay reported to be an
absence period and, indeed, this is the case from
the Red River valley northward. Huebner’s 1991
study confirmed Dillehay’s original hypothesis that
there was no definitive evidence of bison during the
Austin phase in Central Texas. This has led some
researchers to question whether the lithic tool kit
(and possibly other artifact types) that appears in
Toyah phase sites was indeed a reaction to the reintroduction of bison (Mauldin, et al. 2012).
Mauldin et al. (2012) recently hypothesized that
bison likely never left the Central Texas region, but
that there simply were periods of greater densities in
localized environments. However, if this is the case,
their remains simply are not archeologically visible
(Prewitt 2012). There is evidence that hunting was
becoming more important in the Austin phase than
preceding temporal periods and that, perhaps, the
lithic toolkit and the observation of bison remains
at Toyah sites suggests Toyah hunter-gatherers were
continuing on this trajectory, but their efforts were
even more focused on hunting (Prewitt 1981). In
their study, Mauldin et al. (2012:110) suggest that the
number of bison in Central Texas actually was diminishing during the Toyah phase and that bison would
have occupied patchier environments, and therefore
could not likely have been a resource that was always
counted upon to be available. Their conclusion is that
Toyah adaptations actually reflect a wide diet breadth
as opposed to a narrow one with a bison focus.
The presence and influence of bison on the
Toyah artifact assemblage is often stressed when
examining Toyah sites and the Toyah phase. There
is little doubt when reviewing the literature that
bison are present at many of these sites. There are,
however, many Toyah sites that do not contain bison bone and it has been argued that the importance
of bison has been overstated (Arnn 2012:57; Black
1986; Dering 2008; Gilmore 2007, 2012; Johnson
1994; Rush 2013).
The lithic toolkit particular to Toyah, however,
seems well adapted for aspects of systematic hunting, butchery, and other highly repetitive activities
associated with systematic and frequent, if not
specialized, bison procurement (Ricklis and Collins 1994:14). This toolkit’s appearance coincides
with what appears to be the expansion of the range
of bison, back into Central Texas (Mauldin et al.
2012:106), with some reaching the northern edges
of South Texas.
Although bison may never have been completely absent from Central and South Texas, they

certainly have greater archeological visibility,
and thus a presumed greater population density,
during the Toyah phase than the earlier Austin
phase (Prewitt 2012:188). However, Mauldin et
al. (2012:106-107) hypothesize that the creation
of a highly specialized lithic toolkit was due to the
unpredictable locations of bison during the Toyah
phase in order to maximize the productivity of bison acquisition. Other cross-cultural comparative
studies of technological adaptations suggest that
hunter-gatherers do develop specialized tools when
they undertake frequent, repetitive activities such
as would occur with frequent butchery of bison and
other large ungulates (Bousman 1993; Hayden and
Garrett 1988). We suggest, however, that the Toyah
folk could just as easily have borrowed the toolkit
(other than the Perdiz points) from their neighbors
north of the Red River rather than reinvent identical paraphernalia.
Irrespective of their cultural affiliation it is
likely that people would have added bison to
their diet when possible. Dering’s (2008:72-74)
study indicates that people continued to use flexible mobility strategies that focused on various
resources in the unpredictable environment of
Central and South Texas. Arnn (2012:75) hypothesizes that the reliance on bison as a primary
food source in the Central Texas region seems
unlikely because of the diverse environments
that comprise it, a concept that is supported by
the archeological record.
The importance placed on bison and the significant impact they had on the Toyah people and
their material culture has made understanding
Toyah economic strategies implicitly and explicitly
tied to understanding how bison were exploited.
This focus on bison by archeologists has overshadowed the fact that, although many large Toyah
sites contain bison remains, these sites also contain
significant quantities of deer and antelope remains.
Clearly, bison were utilized at many Central Texas
Toyah sites; however, the extent to which bison
served as a primary food resource is less certain
across the entire geographic region. Alternatively,
the fact remains that white-tailed deer remains are
more common at Toyah sites than bison and it has
been suggested this animal is the real focus of these
hunters (Arnn 2012). In light of these studies and
hypotheses, we undertook a detailed analysis of
the faunal remains at Rowe Valley (41WM437),
but first an overview of the site and excavation
methods is presented.

SITE SETTING AND
EXCAVATION CONTROLS

111

Area A (Figure 2) is oriented east-west and
extends from the right bank of a relict overflow chute
to near the mouth of an unnamed small creek. Area B
is adjacent to Area A on the south and southwest; it
is oriented southwest-northeast and situated between
the right bank of the overflow chute and a bend in
the unnamed creek on the east. Area C, oriented eastwest, is adjacent to the river on the left bank of the
overflow chute. At the time excavations began, about
35-40 percent of Area A had been removed by borrow
pit operations. The other two areas were intact.
Horizontal control at the site was imposed by
establishing a baseline oriented magnetic north with
key arbitrary grid reference points defined by rebar
set in concrete. The N1000/W1000 grid reference was
set a little south of the center of Area A. Grid values
increase to the north and to the west. A 60 d nail was
driven into the base of a large pecan tree; the protruding shaft was assigned an arbitrary elevation of 100
m. All elevations are in reference to this datum.
Logistical control was maintained by establishing Excavation Areas (XAs). Ideally, XAs were 10 x
10 m in size, but the ideal could not always prevail.
Eleven XAs (XA 1 through XA 11) were opened in
Area A; XA 9 was placed in the floor of the borrow

The Rowe Valley site (41WM437; Figure 1)
was recorded by Daniel J. Prikryl in 1982 and
subsequently excavated by Texas Archeological
Society (TAS) field schools under the direction
of Elton Prewitt in 1982, 1983, and 1984. It was
initially identified as a multi-component Late Prehistoric site with both Toyah and Austin phase occupations. These determinations were based upon
the visible stratigraphy in borrow pit walls and the
artifacts recovered by the recording party. The field
school excavations focused the majority of effort
upon the Upper Toyah deposits.
Rowe Valley is a large site whose known boundaries were delineated by systematic posthole tests
dug on a 10 m interval grid. Situated within the upper portions of an alluvial terrace approximately 11
m in depth, the site lies on the right (south) bank of
the San Gabriel River 0.9 km downstream from the
Williamson County Road 366 bridge. The cultural
materials were organized into three distinct areas, labeled A-C, of approximately equal extent (50 x 150
m) that constrained the main artifact distributions.

pit to sample Austin phase deposits and is not addressed in this article. One, XA 12, was placed in
Area B and also is not addressed here. As a rule, excavation areas were divided into 4 x 4 m quadrants,
and these into 2 x 2 m excavation units. Two-meter
wide N-S and E-W walk paths in each XA allowed
control of foot traffic during excavations. The
2 x 2 m units were divided into 1 x 1 m cells designated by their sub-cardinal directions: northwest,
northeast, southeast, and southwest. Notes were
recorded on the basis of the 2 x 2 m units with the
southeast corner taken as the unit designator. Excavation and artifact control, however, was by the 1 x 1
m cells and by level (10 cm) or sub-level (5 cm).
A total of 387 1 x 1 m cells was excavated that
contained Upper Toyah material at Rowe Valley. XAs
1 and 5 had 36 cells each; XAs 2, 3, 6, and 10 had
48 cells each; XA 4 had 69 cells; XA 7 had 26 cells;
XA 8 had 16 cells; and XA 11 had 12 cells. When
excavations began, 10 cm levels were used; field observations led to the distinction of two separate Toyah

components, an Upper and a Lower, during the 1982
field season. After that distinction was made, excavations were adjusted to 5 cm sub-levels and focused on
the Upper component. The smaller vertical excavation
increment was applied for the remainder of the excavations. Most of the data presented and discussed below concerning the artifacts recovered and the features
encountered are from the Upper Toyah stratigraphic
zone. The majority of the excavated matrix was water
screened with traditional 1/4-inch mesh screen. Many
of the artifacts recovered were piece plotted, including tools, large flakes, bones, and cultural materials
excavated in association with features.
SITE FORMATION PROCESS AND
ALLUVIATION FROM THE
SAN GABRIEL RIVER
As noted above, the identified features and
the recovered cultural debris are hosted in a

Rush et al.—Dating the Upper Toyah Component at Rowe Valley (41WM437)
thick alluvial terrace of the San Gabriel River.
Aggradation of the terrace is achieved through over
bank flooding. Such floods are intermittent, and
flood frequency varies through time. Most of them
result in gentle slack-water sediment deposition
as was observed at the nearby Loeve-Fox site
(41WM2330) during excavations conducted
between 1972 and 1978 (Prewitt 1982:16 and
Table 2). These types of over bank floods move
gentle currents across the higher terraces and
result in negligible displacement of either feature
components or artifacts and debris. Indeed,
they introduce small quantities of fine-grained
sediments that, over time, bury and seal the cultural
materials in undisturbed alluvial contexts.
Less frequent are major flood episodes such
as the famous Thrall flood that dumped over 38
inches of rain at Thrall and over 30 inches at other
nearby towns between September 8 and 10, 1921
(Scarbrough 1990; NOAA 2015). The Williamson
County Sun (WCM) reported that the waters of
the San Gabriel River reached the highest mark
known up to that time and reported over 23 inches
of rain in a 24 hour period (WCM 1921). These
types of floods introduce much greater quantities
of fine-to-coarse-grained sediments, and generate
entirely new terrace surfaces in some areas and
erode sediments in others. At Loeve-Fox evidence
of sediments deposited by the 1921 flood event
was easily observed by the quantities of early
20th century farm equipment debris encountered
in fluvial deposits (Prewitt 1982:16). This flood,
which was observed to be about 4.25 km wide
just downstream at Circleville, deposited about
12-15 cm of sediment over the Rowe Valley site.
We consider, then, that the features and materials
excavated at Rowe Valley are in primary association, albeit consideration of turbation generated by
plant roots and burrowing animals of various sorts
must be kept in mind.
CULTURAL MATERIAL SUMMARY
Cultural materials recovered include lithic
tools and debris, ceramic sherds, bone and shell
ornaments, burned rocks, and faunal remains. Most
of the lithic items recovered from Rowe Valley are
consistent with the artifacts normally expected at
a Toyah site. These include Perdiz and Cliffton
arrow points, beveled bifaces, end scrapers made
on flake blades, and unifacial flake drills. A large

113

quantity of non-tool lithic debitage (n=32,133) was
also recovered from Rowe Valley. One chipping
station alone contained over 6,000 pieces (for
distributions and density maps of artifact types see
Prewitt [2012] and Rush [2013]).
Items not necessarily diagnostic of Toyah but
that commonly are found associated with it include
Cuney, Lott, Guerrero, and untyped arrow points.
Cuney usually is associated with the Caddo in East
Texas and the Guerrero point with the Mission-era
Texas coastal plain, but the Lott type is associated
with the Garza Complex on the Southern High
Plains of western Texas. Recently Boyd (2012) has
included the Garza Complex within the umbrella
of a “Northern Toyah” that abuts the northwestern
margin of the “Classic” Toyah cultural area (Johnson 1994).
The ceramic assemblage recovered at Rowe
Valley is consistent with other Toyah assemblages,
both in type and paucity. The sherds appear to represent approximately eight different vessels that are
representative of three different cultural traditions
commonly associated with the Toyah cultural area
(Prewitt 2012:200). Three of the vessels are classified as Leon Plain, a type that is occasionally
created locally but examples have been sourced
to East Texas and the Texas Coast (Perttula et al.
2003; Prewitt 1981; see, however, discussion in
Creel et al. [2013:66-69]). A Patton Engraved jar
and a Bullard Brushed jar are both types generally
associated with the southern Caddo pottery tradition in East Texas. A burnished jar with tenoned
handles similar to Goliad Plain ware is usually
associated with the coastal region of Texas and
provides another link to the coastal Toyah groups.
Several ceramic sherds from Rowe Valley were
included in a petrographic study and Instrumental
Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) (Perttula et
al. 2003); these were incorporated later into a larger
study reported by Creel et al. (2013). Although the
petrographic analysis was inconclusive, the initial
INAA study placed the Patton Engraved, Bullard
Brushed, and one untyped vessel (“Leon Plain”)
into the Titus Cluster. The Titus Cluster covered
the area of the Titus phase, a post-A.D. 1430 East
Texas Caddo tradition. Only one sherd, from the
Goliad Plain vessel, was sourced to Central Texas;
however, its companions in the group are from
Coryell and McLennan counties to the northwest
(Perttula et al. 2003:Table 6). The study reported
by Creel et al. (2013:65) supports the Caddo
origin of the Bullard Brushed and Patton Engraved

vessels while placing the Goliad Plain vessel more
appropriately on the coastal plains.
FEATURE CONTEXT AND
CULTURAL STRATIGRAPHY
Three general categories of features were encountered: animal processing locations, tool manufacturing locations, and heating features (Prewitt
2012:198). Animal processing features tended to
be clustered on the northwestern outskirts of Area
A (Figure 3). The tool manufacturing features (or
chipping stations) consist of variously sized concentrations of lithic debris. Some appear to indicate
specific classes of tools were being manufactured
at particular locations. Heating features include
eight hot rock cooking stations, three probable
boiling stone dumps, one charcoal- and ash-filled
pit, and three burned clay pits (Figure 3). Two of
the hot rock cooking features are associated with
the Lower Toyah component while all the others
are in the Upper Toyah component.
To put the cooking features and cultural materials into context, it is instructive to look at their
vertical distributions. To do this, the raw waste
flake counts, including those in discrete chipping
stations, from XA 1 through XA7, XA 11, and parts
of XA 10 were collapsed to the W1000 grid line.
The raw counts were assigned density value ranges
and the corresponding cells shaded accordingly.
The distribution of identified projectile points
was then superimposed on the shaded cells. As is
clearly shown in Figure 4, the Upper Toyah component is about 25 cm thick and dips slightly from
north to south; it begins at elevation 99.45-99.20 m
in the north and slopes to elevation 99.40-99.15 m
in the south.
The Lower Toyah component also is about 25
cm thick and follows the same north-south dip;
it begins at elevation 99.20-98.95 m in the north
and slopes to elevation 99.15-98.90 m toward
the south. Some of the flake density variations
can be ascribed to the significantly less excavations carried out in the Lower Toyah as opposed
to the extensive excavations in the Upper Toyah.
However, a Lower Toyah chipping station shows
clearly at the N998-N1000 segment. Further,
the underlying Austin phase component shows
much greater density of flakes than the overlying
Lower Toyah. The Austin component is at least
35 cm thick; it begins at elevation 98.95 m in the

north and slopes to 98.90 m in the south. Whether
the excavations penetrated the full extent of the
Austin component is unknown but the presence
of a single Darl dart point indicates at least a
minor Late Archaic component near the base of
the excavations.
Superimposing the cooking feature locations
on the same vertical flake density chart is also
informative (Figure 5). Eleven of these features
are clearly associated with the Upper Toyah component, although Feature 3.3 does penetrate to
near the top of the Lower Toyah. Feature 3.1 and
Feature 3.3 occupy the same north-south horizontal
space, but Feature 3.3 extends about 5 cm deeper
than Feature 3.1. Two features, Feature 3.6 and
Feature 7.10, are comfortably in the Lower Toyah
component. No cooking features were encountered
in the underlying Austin component.
FAUNAL ANALYSIS
Approximately 33 percent of the over 10,000
specimen faunal assemblage was analyzed by
Rush (2013). All faunal remains analyzed were
from the Upper Toyah component as illustrated
above in Figures 4 and 5. In general, the condition
of the bone at Rowe Valley was poor. As a rule,
the bones were highly fragmented and the cortical
surfaces were quite rough. More detailed analyses
(see Rush 2103) demonstrated that much of the
fragmentation of bone at Rowe Valley was not
related to purposeful human activities (i.e., not
associated with marrow extraction or grease
production) but rather that trampling by humans,
animals, or later site formation processes are
likely the responsible agents. This conclusion
was largely based on assessing the Freshness
Factor Index (FFI) for analyzed faunal materials
following methods developed by Alan Outram
(Outram 1998, 2000, 2005) and then putting
each bone fragment into a size class following
others (see Ricklis and Collins 1994; Gilmore
2012). Generally, large mammal remains (deer
and antelope) dominate the assemblage, but a fair
amount of very large mammal remains (bison) are
included. Based on those faunal remains analyzed
the minimum number of individuals (MNI) for
identifiable large and very large mammals are
five deer and one bison (Table 1). We presume
the actual numbers of each species are higher
based on field observations of diagnostic bones

not included in our study and the fact that not all
butchery features or specimens were analyzed.
Field observations will be included below in
discussing patterns for the use of mammals.
Comparisons between bison remains and deer
(and deer-sized animals) demonstrated that there
were different hunting/butchery strategies practiced for large and very large mammals. Large
mammals (i.e., deer) were represented nearly
completely (including portions of the axial and
appendicular elements) in butchery features,
while most elements from very large mammal
remains (i.e., bison) were from appendicular
elements (Tables 2 and 3). More than half of
the identifiable deer bones were from the axial

skeleton. This is much higher than the percentage
of axial skeletal elements that were identified for
bison. The null hypothesis that each skeletal part
(skull, axial, limb) would be equally represented
by deer, bison, and unidentified remains can be
strongly rejected with a chi-square test at a <0.01
level of confidence (Table 4). This dichotomy
suggests that deer were hunted close to camp,
transported as complete carcasses, and butchered
at the site. Bison were apparently hunted at some
distance from camp, field butchered near the kill
location, and selected parts transported to camp
for final butchery.
When adjusted residuals are calculated, there
is further indication that bison and deer skeletal

elements are differentially represented in the assemblage (Table 5). The axial elements are extremely overrepresented for the deer while deer
limb bones are underrepresented. Axial elements
for bison do not deviate from the expected values,
although bison limb bones are overrepresented.
Skull elements are overrepresented for both deer
and bison.
Based on mature deer antler racks and a bison
calf maxilla, the faunal remains analyzed are likely
from a late fall or early winter occupation. Bison
generally begin giving birth in early April or May,
but are known to give birth as late as October or
November (Berger and Cunningham 1999:113118; McHugh 1972; Roe 1951). The seasonality
is further corroborated by the presence of mature
deer antlers still attached to the skull. Although
whitetail deer have highly variable mating seasons
based on environmental factors, mating season is
generally accepted to be from December to January (De Young and Miller 2011:324-331), and they
shed their antlers shortly afterward. During winter,
bison herds would have begun splitting into nursery and male herds (Roe 1951), making large herd
kills unlikely as the herds would tend to be more

2541

fragmented in the winter months. Likewise, deer
would have been hunted in small groups or individually during these seasons.
THE ASSAYED HEATING FEATURES
AND WOOD IDENTIFICATION
Feature designations are a combination of the
XA number and the sequence in which they were
encountered. All things comprised of more than a
single element or were otherwise not transportable
intact were labeled as a potential feature. Feature
2.1, then, is understood to be the first feature encountered in XA 2. Some “features” initially assigned numbers turned out to be rodent burrows or
rotted root strains, so there are gaps in the number
sequence due to the discounted “features.”
The 13 identified hot rock heating features
occur in four forms: stones placed into shallow
basins (seven examples; F-2.1, F-2.2, F-2.6a, F-3.1,
F-4.4, F-4.5, and F-6.7), stones placed on flat surfaces (two examples; F-7-10 and F-11.1), mounded
boiling stone dumps placed on flat surfaces (three
examples; F-2.2b, F-6.4, and F-4.8) and a charcoal

and ash-filled pit (F-3.3). All three of the boiling
stone dumps are located immediately adjacent to
shallow basin hearths. In two of these instances
another basin hearth is located 2-3 m distant. At
least two hearths (Feature 4.4 and Feature 6.7) are
accompanied by immediately adjacent discrete
areas of “clean out” comprised of charcoal, ash,
and small hearthstone fragments. Not all hot rock
cooking features are illustrated herein; Figures 6-8
(below) illustrate typical characteristics of each
form of hot rock cooking feature, basin hearths
with cleanout, and flat hearths.
Lump wood charcoal samples for AMS radiocarbon assay were taken from eight features:
four shallow basin hearths (Feature 2.1, Feature
2.2, Feature 3.1, and Feature 4.4), two flat hearths
(Feature 7.10 and Feature 11.1), one hearth clean
out (Feature 6.1 adjacent to the shallow basin
hearth Feature 6.7), and a charcoal- and ash-filled
pit (Feature 3.3). Charcoal from one lower Toyah
component feature (Feature 7.10) was selected by
Prewitt and submitted for assay before realizing
the error of that sample selection. The laboratory
performing the assays (Direct AMS, Seattle, Washington) requested that the samples be 0.3 g or more,
but not less than 0.1 g. Accordingly, single-lump
samples were selected where possible (D-AMS
5609 and D-AMS 5612), and in all cases the fewest lumps needed to achieve the desired threshold
were selected. Only one sample (D-AMS 5613)
was less than 0.3 g; this sample from F-3.3 was
0.09 g. Charcoal was identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level prior to sending the samples
for assay.
Plants identified in the Rowe Valley samples
are given in Table 6. All plant remains were wood
charcoal. The wood identified as elm is consistent
with the anatomical group that includes cedar
elm (Ulmus crassifolia). Given the site location,
the buckeye (Aesculus sp.) specimen is most
likely Texas buckeye (A. glabra var. arguta) or
red buckeye (A. pavia). Buckeyes, sumacs, and
hollies (yaupons) in Central Texas are shrubs or
small trees in contrast to elms and oaks, which are
taller canopy trees. The trees and shrubs identified
at Rowe Valley would have been available on or
near the floodplain of the San Gabriel River during
Toyah times.
Feature 2.1 is a circular cluster of burned
limestone cobbles situated primarily in the
southeast and northeast 1 x 1 m cells in unit
N988W10002. The tops of the uppermost stones

were encountered at 99.26 m elevation while the
tops of the lower stones were at 99.20 m; the lowest
stones rested at 99.18 m. The core of this feature
(at N988.6W1002.63) is about 75 cm in diameter.
Displaced stones adjacent to the perimeter extends
the diameter to about 1 m. The stones are set in a
shallow basin, and at least two of the cobbles near
the center were fractured in place. All of the component stones exhibit reddish to pinkish-gray color
and angular fractures common to burned limestone
cobbles and pebbles. Abundant burned clay and
charcoal lumps were noted in the gray ashy fill
of the basin. A canine mandible rested adjacent to
the northwest edge of this feature at an elevation
of 99.20 m.
Feature 2.2 is an oval cluster of burned
limestone cobbles in the northwest cell of unit
N988W1008. The uppermost stones were encountered at 99.31 m elevation; the tops of the lower
stones were at 99.19 m and they rested on a surface
at 99.16 m. The oval core of this feature is about 50
cm north-south and 60 cm east-west with the center
located at N989.57W1009.40. Displaced stones
around the perimeter form a larger oval about 65
cm northeast-southwest by 90 cm northwest-southeast. The cobbles were placed in a shallow basin.
The gray ashy fill contained numerous burned clay
lumps, and charcoal was abundant. The component
cobbles are pinkish-gray and exhibit the angular
fractures associated with heating elements.
Feature 3.1 is an oval cluster of burned
limestone cobbles situated primarily in the northwest cell of Unit N996W1006 (Figure 6). The
uppermost cobbles were encountered at 99.34
m elevation, the lower ones at 99.24 m, and
they rested on a surface at 99.18 m. The core of
this feature is about 70 cm northeast-southwest
and 60 cm northwest-southeast. The center is at
N997.70W1007.80. Displaced stones around the
perimeter increase the size of the oval to 80 cm
northeast-southwest and 1.10 m northwest-southeast. The shallow basin containing the cobbles has
gray ashy fill with burned clay and charcoal. Both
burned and unburned small bone fragments and
chert chips were also abundant in the fill. A bone
bead was adjacent to the southwest edge of this
feature, and a small concentration of chert flakes
and chips was adjacent to its northwest edge.
Feature 3.3 is a shallow pit that was only
partially excavated. The 1.60 m north-south axis
is centered at grid coordinate N997W1000 and
extends a maximum of 45 cm west of the W1000

line. Projected to its estimated size, this shallow
pit or basin is about 1.75 m in diameter and is
centered at N997W995.40. Unique among the
thermal features encountered at this site, this pit
was encountered at 99.26 m elevation and extended
only 10 cm in depth to 99.16 m. The gray ashy
fill contained abundant charcoal flecks and small
lumps of burned clay. There were relatively few
burned rock fragments present, and those observed
were small angular pieces of limestone burned to a
bright reddish cast. Field notes for this feature indicate a small charcoal twig from the fill exhibited
a cut groove around one end. Very few artifacts of
any sort, including chipping debris, were found
in or around this feature, unlike most of the areas
excavated. A notable exception is a Perdiz arrow
point found about 40 cm away from the southwest
edge of the pit.

Feature 4.4 is a large complex hearth that
extends over parts of 4 1 x 1 m cells in the western half of unit N1002W1002 and eastern half of
N1002W1004 (Figure 7). The tops of the uppermost stones encountered were at 99.32 m elevation
and the tops of the lowest stones were at 99.21 m;
they rested on a surface estimated to be at 99.18 m
elevation. The core is a circular cluster of burned
and fractured cobbles placed in a shallow basin.
It extends 75 m north-south and 70 cm east-west,
and is centered at coordinates N1003.42W1004.
While no distinct coloration of the fill was noted,
the matrix contained abundant small soft burned
clay nodules and charcoal flecks, and a fair number
of charcoal lumps. Extending southeast from the
core is an oval area of burned clay lumps and charcoal. This area is 70 cm wide southwest-northeast
and extends 40 cm to the southeast, presumably

representing clean out from the hearth proper.
The overall configuration of the two components
is kidney-shaped. A few burned rocks are scattered east-northeast of the hearth core, but greater
quantities are scattered around its west and south
sides. Chert flakes and chips were more common
on the eastern side.
Feature 6.1 is an irregularly shaped area
of clean out materials adjacent to the northwest
sides of the Feature 6.7 hearth and Feature 6.4
boiling stone dump. It is comprised of charcoal
lumps and flecks in gray ashy sediment interspersed with burned limestone cobble fragments
of varying sizes. It extends from coordinates
N994.55W1016.35 to the edge of Feature 6.7 at
coordinates N993.10W1015.35. The lens of burned
rocks and abundant charcoal was first encountered
at 99.32 m elevation. Its variable thickness ranged
from 2-7 cm, and it lapped onto the northwest lip
of Feature 6.7; that basin hearth was encountered
at an elevation of 99.29 m.
Feature 7.10 is a small circular group of
burned rocks centered at coordinates N1004W1014

and extended into four adjacent 1 x 1m cells (Figure 8). The tops of the uppermost stones were
encountered at 99.21 m elevation; they rest on a
flat sloping surface that dips from 99.16 m on the
east to 99.13 m on the west. Scattered charcoal was
present in this flat hearth, but was not abundant.
Small bone fragments, both burned and unburned,
were abundant and distributed in and around the
hearth. A flake blade was adjacent to the north
edge while a core chopper rested on the east edge;
flakes were scattered in and around the hearth, and
a very large cobble hammerstone rested at the same
elevation only 50 cm to the northeast. Over 60
percent of the small cobbles comprising this hearth
are friable conglomerates. The remainder consist
of typical fragments of burned stream-rolled limestone cobbles. The form and composition of this
feature compares well with the single Toyah hearth
reported at the Loeve-Fox site just a few kilometers
downstream (Prewitt 1974:72 and Figure 15c).
Feature 11.1 is a circular cluster of burned
limestone cobbles and fragments located in the two

uppermost cobbles were encountered at 99.42 m
elevation while the lower ones were at 99.35 m. This
is a flat hearth with the stones resting on a surface at
99.33 m elevation. The core of it comprises closelyplaced cobbles extending 70 cm north-south and 60
cm east-west. Many of the cobbles are fractured in
place and indicate no significant displacement subsequent to abandonment. Stones scattered around
the north and west sides of the core area extend
its size to 1.50 m north-south and 1.0 m east-west.
Charcoal lumps and flecks were moderately abundant in and around this hearth. A chert core rested
at the top of its northern edge while a ceramic sherd
rested near its center. Bone scraps, chert flakes, and
artifacts were scattered around this hearth.

missionaries, but the individual calibrations reflect
a wide age span at two standard deviations (95.4
percent probability).
After the initial ages were calibrated in OxCal,
various models were used to refine the calibrated
ages. First, all of the samples were input into OxCal to test whether these represented a single age
estimate for the Upper Toyah occupation. Initially,
the eight assays were summed (calibrated age
frequency distributions totaled). This produced
four modes that span the period from A.D. 1450 to
A.D. 1950 (Figure 9); the younger 200 years of this
range is an unlikely age estimate considering the
prehistoric artifact assemblage and the constrained
feature occurrences and stratigraphy, although this
provides one chronological hypothesis.
In order to more rigorously test the hypothesis
of radiocarbon sample homogeneity, all the assays
were combined (frequency distributions averaged) in OxCal. OxCal uses statistical procedures
known as Acomb and Chi-Square statistics. The
Acomb value (http://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/oxcal3/
math_ag.htm, accessed August 9, 2014) must be
equal to or greater than the An estimate for these
to be considered the same age. “An” is calculated
through the formula: 1/√(2n), and thus it is dependent on sample size. The combination statistics for
all the assays are: Agreement n=8, Acomb=0.8%
(An=25.0%), and the Chi-Square statistic (χ2)
=36.838, df=1, p value < 0.00001. Both results
suggest that the degree of variability is too great
to consider these assays as coming from a single
occupation. At that point we asked if any samples

DATING THE TOYAH

The eight radiocarbon samples were selected
because of their clear associations with the various
features (described above) and amount of available
charcoal. The charcoal samples were submitted to
Direct AMS in Bothell, Washington. The δ13C
corrected AMS age estimates are presented in
Table 7. Each of the individual radiocarbon ages
was calibrated in OxCal. A careful analysis of the
calibrated ages for the new Rowe Valley radiocarbon samples is justified, as these are very close in
age to the initial occupation of Central Texas by
a number of immigrant Native American groups
and by the first Spanish explorers and eventually

can be considered coeval, and we began to group
the dates and run combination statistics on all pairs,
building up to larger groupings with the goals of
arriving at the smallest number of temporal groups.
This procedure allows for a minimal age model
hypothesis to be constructed in contrast to the
summed calibration model discussed above and
illustrated in Figure 9. The results are discussed
below and illustrated in Figure 10.
Samples D-AMS 5608, 5610, 5611, 5612,
5613, and 5614 can be combined statistically using
the combination statistics in OxCal (Agreement n=6,
Acomb=40.0% (An=28.9%) and the χ2 = 10.717,
df=5, p value=0.0573), and we called these six
samples the Younger Age Group. When combined
(averaged) in OxCal, the 2 sigma (95.4 percent probability) age range is A.D. 1645-1664. This means

that statistically there is over a 95 percent chance
that all these samples date to this 19 year span in the
middle of the 17th century. While the Chi-Square
statistic is marginal, nevertheless we hypothesize
that these six samples may make up a very precise
age estimate for most of the dated features (Features
2.1, F2.2, F3.3, F4.4, F6.1, and F11.1) in the Upper
Toyah component at Rowe Valley.
Rowe Valley Samples D-AMS 5609 and 5615
should not be combined with the Younger Age
Group. However, these two samples, called the
Older Age Group, statistically can be combined
(averaged) in OxCal and the 2 sigma (95.4 percent
probability) range produced two age modes of
A.D. 1469-1525 (44.3 percent) and A.D. 15561632 (51.1 percent). The combination statistics
indicate that the sample ages are statistically

there are at least two sequential Toyah components
present in the site. It is unclear which of the two
age modes in the Older Age Group is the more accurate age estimate for Features 3.1 and 7.10.
This chronological hypothesis (Younger
and Older Age Groups) is in agreement with the
observed site stratigraphy and the artifacts recovered from Rowe Valley. The Younger Age Group

accords well with the Upper Toyah component and
distributions).

the various “exotic” artifact groups; that is, the imported ceramics and the arrow points from distant
external regions are well within their expected age
ranges. Within the Older Age Group, Feature 7.10
is precisely within the age range expected for the
Lower Toyah component. However, Feature 3.1
requires additional consideration. It is stratigraphically within the Upper Toyah, yet dates to the
Lower Toyah. Whether this anomaly is a function
of old wood being burned, older rings sampled
from the core in a younger sample selected for dating, undetected buried ground surface undulations,

Rush et al.—Dating the Upper Toyah Component at Rowe Valley (41WM437)
or other causes remains undetermined. The patterns
of fire wood selection in Toyah sites have yet to be
studied in detail beyond the identification of tree
species. This could be an important issue, but to
our knowledge fire wood selection has not be analyzed in detail in any region in the South Central
United States.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
The calibrated radiocarbon dating results support the observed vertical stratigraphy that shows at
least two separate occupations occurred during the
Toyah phase at Rowe Valley. Both the Younger and
Older Age groups clearly predate the entrance of the
Spanish into Central Texas. The “clean out” of features Feature 4.4 and Feature 6.7 demonstrate that
the site probably was visited at least twice during
the time represented by the Younger Age Group, but
it is likely that additional visits occurred based on
the quantity of materials present and the horizontal
distribution of cultural materials. The six features in
the Younger Age Group date to a 19 year span in the
middle 17th century, a time that appears to predate
the first appearance of Spanish explorers into the
eastern portion of Central Texas (Nickels and Bousman 2010:17-22; Wade 2003) unless one accepts the
possible foray of Luis de Moscoso Alvarado’s men
into Central Texas during his western trip from East
Texas in 1542 (Swanton 1985).
The Younger Age Group date suggests intensive use of the Rowe Valley locale near the end
of the Toyah phase; this is after the Spanish are
documented in more distant parts of Texas. However, the absence of direct Spanish contact at the
Rowe Valley site is supported by the fact that no
historic cultural materials were observed or collected (i.e., glass beads or metal artifacts) and no
European fauna such as horses, pigs, or goats were
identified. However, a complete analysis of faunal
remains would be needed to conclusively confirm
that. The data from the ceramics and arrow points
suggest that although those people who lived at
Rowe Valley did not have contact with the Spanish, they did have contact with peoples that lived
in the adjacent East Texas and Coastal regions as
well as the Southern High Plains to the northwest.
This conclusion is very much in keeping with the
Toyah phase mobility and social interactions discussed at length in Kenmotsu and Boyd (2012a)
and by Arnn (2012).

None of the analyzed faunal materials were
from the specific 1 x 1 m units where the dated
features were located. However, the focus on analyzing faunal materials recovered from the Upper
Toyah component of the site makes it possible
to associate the use of Younger Group thermal
features and the hunting and butchery strategies.
Further, the activity areas were covered with low
velocity alluvial deposits from the San Gabriel
River making the associations reasonably secure.
Bison were certainly utilized at Rowe Valley,
like other Toyah sites, but did not serve as the sole
economic pursuit. Deer are and have been ubiquitous in Central Texas and would have been widely
available, especially during the fall and winter
months. Whole deer carcasses can be transported
with relatively little effort and deer are shown to be
a more frequently utilized resource when compared
to bison (Arnn 2012; Black 1986). Bison in the area
surrounding Rowe Valley were possibly occupying specialty patches (Mauldin et al. 2012), and
their movements were focused in the upland black
prairie grasslands as opposed to the bottomlands
(i.e., where Rowe Valley is located). The presence
of bison remains, however, does suggest that bison
were indeed available and that the people that were
living at Rowe Valley utilized them. The ratio of
bison remains to deer remains suggests that bison
hunts occurred away from the main campsite.
Although it is difficult to know the level at which
field butchery takes place, conclusions regarding
which mammal resource was more utilized cannot
be firmly made since bones present in archeological contexts do not equate with meat use or how
intensively a resource was relied upon.
We conclude that Rowe Valley was a large
campsite whose location along the San Gabriel
River provided access to a wide variety of food and
other resources. Those that inhabited and utilized
the site did so intensively and returned to it multiple times. While this might suggest that the Toyah
occupants may have been somewhat more sedentary than those who lived there during the Austin
phase, they were still quite mobile. The presence
of ceramics from eastern and coastal Texas and arrow points from those areas and from the northwest
suggests cultural interactions with groups from
multiple adjacent—yet distant—regions during a
time of looming cultural upheaval. And finally,
it would be fruitful in the future to look at Rowe
Valley in the light of the “trade fairs” as suggested
by Creel et al. (2013:77) and the locations of an
