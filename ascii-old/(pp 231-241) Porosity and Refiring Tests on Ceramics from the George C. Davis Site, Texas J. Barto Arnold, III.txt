POROSITY AND REFIRING TESTS ON CERAMICS
FROM THE GEORGE C. DAVIS SITE, TEXAS
J. BARTO ARNOLD

ABSTRACT
Retiring experiments involving porosity and color change were performed on a sample of the pottery from the George C. Davis Site. The
technology of ceramic production at this site was elucidated through these
experiments the results of which are described in this paper.

INTRODUCTION
The George C. Davis Site (41 CE 19) is located on a Pleistocene terrace of the Neches River in Cherokee County, Texas, and is bisected
by Texas State Highway 21 approximately midway between the towns
of Crockett and Rusk. The site had been occupied by prehistoric Caddo Indians from about A. D. 700 to A. D. 1250 (Story 1972: i). Major
features of the site include two earthen temple mounds (Mounds A
and B), an earthen burial mound (Mound C), and an extensive village
area. The W.P.A. sponsored excavations at the site from 1939-1941
reported by Newell and Krieger (1949). From 1968 to 1970 excavations were carried out under the supervision of Dee Ann Story,
Director of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, The
University of Texas at Austin. The ceramic collection from this site
forms the body of data from which samples were taken for this
porosity and refiring study. A more extensive ceramic analysis of the
1968-1970 collection is available in Arnold (1973).

POROSITY AND REFIRING TESTS
The main coloring agents in clay are the naturally occurring impurities such as iron compounds and carbonaceous matter. The firing
atmosphere, temperature, and duration operate upon these impurities to produce the color the vessel will possess after firing
(Shepard 1968: 103). The firing atmosphere may be oxidizing, containing free oxygen, or reducing, containing gasses that take oxygen
from constituents of the clay. Oxidation produces clear colors, and
reduction produces gray (Shepard 1968: 103).
....
Grays and blacks can also be obtained if the firing temperature is
too low to drive out carbonaceous matter and to change iron compounds to iron oxide (Ibid.) Smudging is another means of intentionally producing grays and blacks by causing carbon to be
deposited on the vessel during firing. Smudging can be accomplished

when smoldering fuel comes in contact with the pottery at the end of
the firing process. Sooty smoke from such substances as wood chips
and saw dust or powdered dung can also produce smudging (Shepard
1968: 88).
The colors produced by the iron compounds depend upon a number
of variables. Colton (1939: 266) says the main variable is the percentage or iron content (Table 1). Shepard (1968: 103) points out that
there are other variables in operation such as iron compound particle
size and distribution. These factors reduce the level of confidence
which can be placed in Colton’s statements on color. Also it must be
remembered that grays and blac ks can be produced due to the simple
lack of oxidation of carbonaceous matter. Reduction is not the only
cause of blacks and grays.

Duration of firing can also affect the final color of the pottery. If a
high enough temperature is not reached and maintained for a sufficient period of time colors may not be clear, or if the surface is fully
oxidized there may be a dark core indicating residual carbonaceous
matter the carbon having been burned from the surface only
(Shepard 1968: 104). An oxidized surface and a dark core are a
frequent occurrence in this collection (Table 2).
Retiring tests can be helpful in determining original firing conditions. By retiring at a relatively high temperature in a controlled atmosphere and observing color change some aspects of the original
firing atmosphere may be inferred. A short retiring at relatively low
temperatures should clear the colors of sherds that have been
smudged (Shepard 1968: 105,217-220).

collection will be discussed below. Furthermore, comparing porosity
before and after retiring at a relatively high temperature may give
some idea of the potential of the paste under consideration. It is
possible to combine retiring for porosity and color in a single test.
All retiring tests were performed in an American Art Clay Company Standard Economy Electric Kiln, Type ECI5. The kiln is
equipped with a thermocouple-pyrometer system made by the same
company. The centigrade scale is marked in 250 increments.
Experiment No. 1

-- Color and Porosity Test

The combined color and porosity change retiring experiment was
carried out for a small sample of each of ten main pottery types
(Table 3) from the George C. Davis Site. In this way any variation between types as well as an average for all the types, can be observed.
Fifteen sh erds were drawn at random from each type. The porosity of
the sample of 150 sherds was determined before and after retiring by
means of the formula suggested by Shepard (Shepard 1968: 127).
Shepard’s formula, "recommended by the Committee on Standards
of the American Ceramic Society," (ibid.) was chosen over the alternate formula suggested by Nelson (1971: 143) because it was felt that

234

its allowance for the volume of the sherd added a dimension of accuracy not afforded by Nelson’s simple percentage weight increase.
Shepard’s formula derives the apparent percentage of porosity by
dividing the weight difference of the sherd before and after soaking in
water by the volume of the sherd and multiplying by 100.
The color of 100 sherds, ten randomly selected from each set of fifteen, was recorded using the Munsell Soil Color Chart (1954) both
before and after retiring. Since for the color change test no statistical procedures were to be applied, it was felt that the whole original
150 sherd sample need not be used. All the sherds were retired in an
electric kiln. The kiln was heated slowly and continuously over a
period of three hours to a maximum temperature of 11000 C, a temperature well above the high of 7000 - 8000 C that could be expected
from an aboriginal open air tiring [J.A. Neely, personal communication). The temperature of 11000 C was maintained for thirty minutes,
and then the kiln was turned off and allowed to cool overnight while
remaining closed.
The change in the color of the sherds retired was dramatic. From a
relatively broad range of rather dark brown, gray, reddish brown,
and reddish gray colors the retiring under the oxidizing conditions of
the electric kiln produced a remarkably narrow range of light red and
red colors. This applies to surface color and core color. In many cases
a light surface color had been present with a dark core. Note the tight
clustering of value, 4 - 5, and chroma, 7 - 8, in the "after" columns of
Table 4.
The porosity tests on the sherds before retiring yielded fairly
uniform results (Table 3). An analysis of variance inherent in these
porosity figures will help in their interpretation. Since the sample
sizes are equal, a F-maximum test -- a simple yet robust test for
homogeneity of variances
is applicable (Bruning and Kintz 1968:
110-111). The F MAX of 4.51 with fourteen degrees of freedom is not
significant at the .05 level, and therefore it is concluded that the
variances are homogeneous before tiring. The same is true of the
porosity measurements taken after retiring which yielded an F MAX
of 4.08 with fourteen degrees of freedom. There is no significant
difference betweentypes reflected in the porosity results.
The porosity percentages measured after retiring consistently
showed an increase for all types [Table 3). Interestingly enough, the
weight of the individual sherds decreased and their volume increased. Many of the sherds developed a network of shallow surface
cracks after retiring. Therefore, the clay involved, whether it was in
a natural state or modified before use, was suited only for a limited
firing range. If temperatures above that range were

pansion would cause surface cracks. There was also a notable
change in the ringing sound given by the sherds when dropped on a
table top. The sound this produced became distinctly higher and
clearer after refiring.

Experiment No. 2 -- Smudging Test
A separate sample of twenty-five black 0r dark gray sherds was
selected from Holly Fine Engraved, a type possibly intentionally
smudged. Test chips were broken off of these sherds for this refiring
experiment. According to Shepard (1968: 217,220) a short firing in air
(oxidizing atmosphere} at 500° C should be sufficient to clear a sherd
that has been smudged. If no significant Change in color is observed
then the dark color must be attributed to reduction during firing or
lack of oxidation or carbonaceous material in the clay.
The test chips were fired in the electric kiln used in the previous experiment at a temperature of 500° C for fifteen minutes.
In every case the refired test chip when compared to the sherd
from which it was removed proved to be a lighter color (Fig. 1). Further evidence of smudging can be seen in the presence of a few sherds
in the sample analyzed from the recent collection. These sherds have
a dark surface color and a light core color (Table 2}; two of the five
sherds with this characteristic are classified as Holly Fine Engraved.

CONCLUSIONS
The remarkable uniformity of the results of the porosity tests indicates that vessels of any or all of the various Davis Site pottery
types could have been made from similar batches of prepared clay
body or paste, and tiring conditions of time and temperature were not
greatly different for individual types. This indicates a striking homogeneity of technology and clay sources. By way of comparison of
the seventeen types of pottery from Pecos whose average apparent
porosity was tested by Shepard (1968: 128) the range of values was
about 1 - 24°/o after retiring and about 21 - 40°/o before. The range of
average apparent porosity of Davis Site pottery was 27 - 37% after
retiring and 19- 26%

before.

240

The fact that the retiring tests produced such similar colors indicates constituent clays used in the manufacture of the tested types
are similar in origin and chemical constitution. Since the retiring conditions definitely oxidized the test sherds, it is probably safe to use
Colton’s figures and to conclude that the iron content of the clay is
greater than three percent (Colton 1939: 226).
The colors produced by the retiring test show that one or more of
the following conditions was in operation:
i. The tiring temperature was not high enough for complete
oxidation.
2. The tiring duration was not long enough for complete
oxidation.
3. The tiring atmosphere did not possess sufficient free
oxygen for complete oxidation.

Although the Davis Site pottery has a fairly high porosity the paste
was well suited to the conditions of aboriginal tiring employed. The
tests showed thai if the higher temperature necessary for complete
oxidation and clear colors was reached the paste would develop
cracks and an even higher porosity.
The retiring test for smudging indicates that this process was indeed employed by the potters of the Davis Site.
