Abstract
Flatrock Enginering and Environmental, Ltd. of San Antonio, Texas contracted with Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations to conduct a cultural resources linear survey of a segment
of the Colorado City Mainline right-of-way through a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
jurisdictional crossing of the Colorado River in north-central Mitchell County, Texas. This
cultural resources survey was undertaken to satisfy the general requirements described as part of
Nationwide Permit 12, Sections C20 and C21, and Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act.
the river crossing is to be effected by boring under the channel. From bore hole entrance to bore
hole exit it is roughly 902 feet. The overall area of potential effect is thus 902 feet long x 80 feet
wide, for a total of 1.66 acres. Tierras Antiguas archaeologists conducted a thorough pedestrian
survey of the right-of-way, and excavated nine shovel tests on September 21 and 22, 2014,
resulting in the discovery of no evidence of cultural material either on or below the surface. As
such, Tierras Antiguas recommends that construction of the Colorado City Mainline should be
allowed to proceed as currently designed. The project should be considered as having “no effect”
on any properties considered as eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places
or inclusion in the State Archeological Landmarks Program, and as such, the project should be
allowed to proceed without further archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are
encountered during construction, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such
finds are examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and
the Texas Historical Commission.
No artifacts were collected and curated during this project.

LLC in turn
contracted with Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, Ltd. of San Antonio to ensure the
requirements for environmental and cultural assessments would be conducted in a professional
compliance manner. At the request of Flatrock, Tierras Antiguas Archaeological Investigations
(TAAI) conducted a cultural resources survey of the Project Area (PA) over a two-day period on
September 21 and 22, 2014 (Figures 1-3). The project is privately funded, however because the
properties are within the jurisdictional control of the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, the cultural
resources survey was subject to Section 106 review by the Texas State Historical Preservation
Office (SHPO). The survey was conducted under the guidelines of the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) and Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA). In addition to a surface survey,
Tierras Antiguas excavated nine shovel tests.

Project Setting
Geology, Soils, and Hydrology
The Project Area as shown in Figure 4 is located on Triassic-aged, Dockum Group (Trd)
sandstone, clay, shale, and conglomerate formed some 208-245 million years ago, and reaches
as much as 450 feet in depth. More specifically, the Dockum Group is comprised of
sandstones with fine to coarse-grained quartz that is micaceous, silty, thin bedded to massive,
crossbedded, well indurated, and greenish gray to brownish red in color. The shales are sandy
in texture, locally calcareous, and indistinctly bedded in shades of red, green, gray, and
yellow. The conglomerates in the Dockum Group are comprised of chert pebbles in various
colors, often underlain by quartz, sandstone slabs, and petrified wood (Barnes 1994; Judson
and Kauffman 1990; Spearing 1991; Stoesser et al. 2014).

As shown in Figure 5, there are three different soil types within the Project Area that offer
varying depths, resulting primarily from alluvial processes related to the overbank flooding
and subsequent downcutting of the Colorado River and its first-order tributaries. As such,
these various soil classifications otherwise imply the potential for the preservation of intact
cultural resources to exist (Holder et al. 1969 ; Websoil Survey 2014). Typical soil pedons of
these three classifications are synthesized below.

The Colorado River drains the county from the northwest to the southeast, fed by first-order
tributaries Big Silver Creek, Willow Creek, Beals Creek, Wildhorse Creek, Champion Creek,
Lone Wolf Creek, Hasting Creek, and Little Sulphur Creek. The Colorado River meanders
significantly in the southern portion of Mitchell County, as it has cut through the Callahan
Divide, a line of east-west trending hills (Amin and Leffler 1996).
Flora, Fauna, and Climate
The Project Area lies within the North Central Plains physiographic region of Texas (Figure 6).

valleys, and enter the Lower Plains region, encompassing generally rolling, low hills and ridges
(Boyd 1995; Parsons 1967; Carroll 1996). The topography of Mitchell county is typified by an
undulating nearly level to rolling landscape with predominately rangelands on loamy and dry
soils. Elevation in Mitchell county ranges from 2,004 feet to 2,616 feet above mean sea level
from the northwest to the southwest (Amin and Leffeer 1996).
The modern climate of the Project Area is classified as semi-arid, with an average annual rainfall
of less than 20 inches. Large fluctuations in temperature occur throughout the year, with average
daily maximum temperatures averaging about 960F in July, to around 300F degrees in January.
The combination of variable rainfall and temperature patterns results in frequent droughts as well
as sporadic periods of abundant moisture, resulting in a growing season of roughly 217 days
(Amin and Leffler 1996).

Cultural Chronology
The Project Area presumes cultural affinities both indigenous to the western edge of the northcentral Texas region as well as intrusive influences from the Southern Great Plains (Figure 7).
Several scholars have offered sound but differing arguments for cultural chronologies for the
Southern Great Plains extending into northern Texas. The cultural chronology, defined by
complex (in lieu of the terms phase, interval, or period) of the North American High Plains has
been synthesized by Hofman et al. (1989), and more recently, the Southern High Plains in Texas
by Johnson and Holliday (1995) and Boyd (1995). It should be noted that the Southern Great
Plains complexes are defined by shifts in climatic conditions and subsistence more so than
changes in point style, which are indicators of change in central and south Texas. The following
discussions are primarily derived from Johnson and Holliday (1986, 1995), Boyd (1995), and
Hofman et al. (1989). All dates are approximate and given as years before present (B.P.).
Pre-Clovis
Although humans may have inhabited the landscape before 11,500 B.P, solid evidence does not
support their existence. Although human behavior is inferred on stone artifacts from mammoth
bones at the Waco Site (Fox et al. 1992:51-73), all are problematic. At Lewisville Lake on the
Southern High Plains of north-central Texas, radiocarbon dates initially believed to be from
burned charcoal in human campfires, and approximating an antiquity of 40,000 years were later
disproved as dates on natural coal (Stanford 1982:208-209).
As Collins (1995:380-381) offers, eroded landforms are not likely to yield solid stratigraphic
proof of human occupation earlier than late Pleistocene, and if we do find earlier occupations on
stable landforms, what comprises the signature of a Pre-Clovis culture? The Gault Site in Bell
County, Texas has provided by far the largest Clovis assemblage in all of North America, and
with artifacts stratigraphically beneath the known Clovis component, likely has the best chances
of providing conclusive evidence for a pre-Clovis culture in Texas (Adavasio and Page 2002:292294; Collins and Brown 2000; Gault Site 2014).

Paleoindian
The Paleoindian period
began toward the close of
the Pleistocene. The
Southern Great Plains
were occupied by Clovis
(Llano), Folsom and
other complex peoples
between approximately
11500-8000 B.P.
(Hofman
etal.
1989:29-45). During the
Paleoindian interval,
Hurt (1980) suggests an
association with the
Southern Plains and
Trans-Pecos regions.
Diagnostic artifacts
include Clovis and
Folsom projectile points.

dispersal of the people who made them. Within Texas' political boundaries, Meltzer and Bever
(2007) have documented the presence of over 500 Clovis points. Other artifacts associated with
the Clovis culture include bifaces and prismatic blades, engraved stones, bone and ivory points,
stone bolas, ochre, and shaft straighteners.
In general the Paleoindian adaptation has been considered to be one of small bands of nomadic,
big-game hunters following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons,
bison, camel, and horse, across North America (Black 1989a). More recently, emphasis has been
placed on the wide diversity of plants and animals used for subsistence by these early Americans
(Black 1989a; Hester 1983), such as turtles and tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons
(Collins 1995:381), although they undoubtedly hunted the large animals as well (Dibble and
Lorraine 1968). Known Clovis sites include killsites, quarries, caches, open campsites, ritual
sites, and burials (Collins 1995: 381-383; Hester 1995:433-436). A Folsom interval follows the
Clovis, except perhaps in the Southern Great Plains where a transitional complex of artifacts with
dart points called “Goshen” may be present (Hofman et al. 1989:34; Irwin et al. 1973).
A well-documented Paleoindian Clovis site in the southern Great Plains is the McLean site in
Taylor County, west of Abilene (Ray and Bryan 1938; Sellards 1952). Folsom sites in the area
include the Scharbauer site in northwestern Midland County (Wendorf et al. 1955), and the
9

Adair-Steadman site in north central Nolan County (Tunnel 1977). A fourth site nearby
containing a Milnesand component is Lone Wolf Creek in northeastern Mitchell County
(Wormington 1957). By far, the most robust collection of Paleindian artifacts has been recovered
at the Gault Site in Bell County, Texas. Archaeologists estimate that over 2.3 million Paleoindian
artifacts have been recovered, with only about 3% of the site professionally excavated thus far
(Gault Site 2014).
As the warming that marks the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene climates began to take
effect in Texas, prehistoric inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic shift is
also marked by the decline and extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant bison
(Bison antiquus). With the possible exception of the Berclair Terrace site (Sellards 1940),
archaeological evidence suggests that after 8000 B.P., large gregarious game animals were either
extinct or otherwise extricated from Texas. Human hunters were forced to concentrate on deer,
antelope, and other medium-size or smaller game. Changes in the subsistence base required
technological shifts that mark the beginning of a new cultural period known as the Archaic.
Early Archaic
The Early Archaic on the Southern Great Plains is approximated at 8000-5000 B. P. (Hofman
etal. 1989), although Johnson and Holliday (1986) offer more fine-grained dates for the Llano
Estacado from the Lubbock Lake site of 8500–6400 B.P. The extinction of large herds of
megafauna and the changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene stimulated a behavioral
change by the Prehistoric inhabitants of South Texas (McKinney 1981). While the basic
hunter-gatherer adaptation probably remained intact, an economic shift away from big game
hunting was necessary. In general, more intensive exploitation of local resources in central Texas,
such as deer, fish, and plant bulbs is indicated by greater densities of ground-stone artifacts,
fire-cracked rock cooking features, and more specialized tools such as Clear Fork gouges and
Guadalupe bifaces (Turner et al. 2011). Weir (1976) speculates that Early Archaic groups were
small and highly mobile, an inference from the fact that Early Archaic sites are thinly distributed
and that diagnostic types are seen across a wide area, including most of Texas and northern
Mexico. Hurt (1980) suggests that the decline in the number of bison on the plains forced the
inhabitants to broaden their diets to pursue plants and animals which would produce the same
amount of calories and protein with the same or slightly more effort expended. Using projectile
points as temporal markers, Hurt (1980:vi) argues that the Taylor County area was used more
frequently in the Early Archaic than in the Middle and Late Archaic, probably due to “decline of
bison and other game animals on the Southern Plains.” Story (1985), however, believes that
population densities were low during this period, and that groups consisted of related individuals
in small bands with “few constraints on their mobility” (Story 1985:39). Their economy was
based on diffuse utilization of a wide range of resources, especially such year-round resources
as prickly pear and lechugilla, as well as rodents, rabbits, and deer (Story 1985:38).
Middle Archaic
The Southern Plains Middle Archaic complex as derived from changes in climate and subsistence
is recognized generally as the period between 5000–3000 B.P. (Hofman et al. 1989:45-47), and
more specifically as 6400–4500 B.P. on the Llano Estacado (Johnson and Holliday 1986:46). The
Middle Archaic appears to have been a time of increased population, based on the large number
10

of sites from this period in south and central Texas (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125, 128). The
reasons for this increase are not known, but the amelioration of a very dry period (Altithermal)
during the Early Archaic is often seen as the prime mover (Sollberger and Hester 1972:338; Story
1985:40). A wide variation in projectile point styles at the Jonas Terrace site suggest "a time of
ethnic and cultural variety, as well as group movement and immigration." (Johnson 1995:285).
Hurt (1980) posits that the quantity of diversified game animals on the Southern Great Plains
decreased, and thus lead to an intensified, less broad diet. On the South Texas Plains, exploitation
of widely scattered, year-round resources such as prickly pear continued (Campbell and Campbell
1981:13-15), as did hunting deer and rabbit. However, a shift to concentrated, seasonal nut
harvests in the riverine environments of the Balcones Escarpment seems to have occurred (Black
1989a). Weir (1976) believes that an expansion of oak on the Edwards Plateau and Balcones
Escarpment led to intensive plant gathering and acorn processing. He also believes that the
widely scattered bands prevalent in the Early Archaic now began to coalesce, at least during the
acorn-gathering season, into larger groups who shared the intensive work of gathering and
processing the acorn harvest (Weir 1976:126). Many researchers believe burned rock middens
are a result of this endeavor (Creel 1986; Prewitt 1991; Weir 1976). Other investigators doubt this
conclusion (e.g., Goode 1991), but the exact processes which formed the burned rock middens
are still a matter of controversy (Black 1989b:28; Black et al. 1997; Hester 1991; Leach and
Bousman 1998).
On the Edwards Plateau, they may have come together to gather acorns, and then built large
cooking ovens to steam the tanic acid out of them to make them edible (Weir 1976). The large
cooking ovens were apparently used over and over again. Whether they were repeatedly used
within just a few years or over several hundred years is still being debated, but the consensus
seems to be that they were used to cook not only deer, but also a great deal of tubers and other
plants (Black et al. 1997; Mauldin et al. 2003). These large cooking ovens which contain mounds
of accumulated fire-cracked rocks are called “burned rock middens” in the archaeological
community, but are sometimes referred to as “Indian mounds” by artifact collectors.
The common presence of deer remains in burned rock middens encourages the view that deer
processing took place at burned rock midden sites (Nickels et al. 2001; Black and McGraw
1985:278; Weir 1976:125). Bison bone is encountered in archaeological sites in central and south
Texas, at least occasionally, during all but the earliest part of the Middle Archaic (Dillehay 1974).
There has been a tendency to equate presence of burned rock middens with absence of bison
(Prewitt 1981); however, examinations of several recent faunal reports show that after about 4500
B.P. bison and burned rock middens are contemporaneous, though not at the same sites, at least
in the southern Edwards Plateau and northern South Texas Plain (Meissner 1993).
Late Archaic
Hofman's (1989:45) synthesis of the data places the Late Archaic on the Southern Plains as
3000–2000 B.P., and possibly later. Johnson and Holiday (1986:46) specify 4500–2000 B.P. as
the Late Archaic period on the Llano Estacado. Some researchers believe populations increased
throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985), while others feel populations remained the same or
fell during this period (Black 1989b:30). Prewitt (1981:80-81) asserts that the accumulation of
burned rock middens nearly ceased during the course of this period; however, excavations at the
11

Blue Hole site in Uvalde County (Mueggenborg 1994:1-74), the Honey Creek midden at 41MS32
(Black et al. 1997), the Jonas Terrace site in Medina County (Johnson 1995), a series of middens
at Camp Bowie in Brown County (Mauldin et al. 2003), and the Mingo site in Bandera County
(Houk and Lohse 1993:193-248) provide evidence that large cooking features up to 15 m in
diameter were still very much in use (see also Black et al. 1997). Subsistence is assumed to have
become less specialized and focused on acorns, in favor of a broad spectrum subsistence base
(Black 1989b:30). Hurt (1980) asserts that bison began returning to the Southern Great Plains
area, and we see an increase in intensive processing of bison, as well as mussel shells during the
Late Archaic. However, by about 1450 B.P., bison had again disappeared (Dillehay 1974).
The proliferation of distinguishable human cemeteries has been attributed to this period, with the
earliest occurrences dating to the south Texas Middle Archaic (Hester 1995:439-440). At Loma
Sandia, these date between ca. 2550 and 2750 B.P. (Taylor and Highley 1995). Story
(1985:44-45) believes the presence of cemeteries at sites such as Ernest Witte (Hall 1981),
Hitzfelder Cave (Givens 1968), and Olmos Dam (Lukowski 1988) indicates that Late Archaic
populations in central and south Texas were increasing and becoming more territorial. Hurt
(1980) further posits that population in the Taylor County area peaked during the Late Archaic
with groups moving into the area from Central Texas; before that the complex of artifacts found
in the region were more closely associated with those of the Trans-Pecos region.
Although inhabitants of the South Texas Plain near Brownsville and Rockport had begun to make
pottery by about 1750 B.P., the northern part of the plain was still "pre-ceramic" until 1,000 years
later (Story 1985:45-47). Late Archaic points tend to be much smaller than Middle Archaic
points. The most common are Ensor and Frio types (Turner et al. 2011), both of which are short,
triangular points with side notches. The Frio point also has a notched base (Turner et al. 2011).
Transitional Archaic
During the Early Neo-Indian period on the Southern Great Plains (ca. 950–1450 B.P.), Hurt
(1980) presents evidence for perhaps a decrease in bison processing; consistent with Dillehay's
(1974) contention that there are now less bison available in the area due to climatic changes,
which also lowered water tables to alkalinity levels.
Late Prehistoric/Plains Woodland
The term “Plains Woodland or Woodland” is commonly used on the Southern Great Plains. A
series of distinctive traits marks the shift from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period,
including the technological shift to the bow and arrow and the introduction of pottery to central
Texas and the northern South Texas Plain (Black 1989b:32; Story 1985:45-47). Two complexes
following the Late Archaic in the Southern Great Plains region are the Plains Woodland from
about 2000-1150 B.P., and the Plains Village from 1150-450 B.P. (Hofman 1989:61-90). Most
researchers agree the early Late Prehistoric period was a time of population decrease (Black
1989b:32). Though small burned rock middens associated with Scallorn and Edwards points have
been found (Goode 1991:71; Houk and Lohse 1993:193-248), they are rare. Settlement shifts into
rockshelters such as Scorpion Cave in Medina County (Highley et al. 1978) and Classen
Rockshelter in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967) have been noted (Shafer 1977;
Skinner 1981). Cemeteries from this period often reveal evidence of conflict (Black 1989b:32).

12

Huebner (1991:354-355) suggests that the sudden return of bison to south and central Texas
resulted from a more xeric climate in the plains north of Texas, and increased grass in the
Cross-Timbers and Post Oak Savannah in north central Texas, forming a “bison corridor” into
the South Texas Plain along the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau. However, according to Hurt
(1980), the Late Neo-Indian period on the Southern Great Plains (ca. 950 – 450 B.P.) is mirrored
in the archaeological record by an absence of bison and vegetal matter, most likely due to the
increased alkalinity in the region's water sources.
Protohistoric/Historic Period
The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period on the Southern Plains in
northern Texas should be characterized by written accounts of European contact with indigenous
groups, and is often labeled the “Protohistoric”. On the Southern High Plains, Hofman (1989:91)
agrees that “The Protohistoric period is encompassed by the time when there were limited
European contacts with the area and brief records of these journeys, but no proper history.” The
cultural context for the historic groups in the area of study is largely conditioned by the presence
of outside ethnic groups and regional power struggles. The numerous small groups of Jumanos
and Coahuiltecans encountered by the early explorers and later Spanish intrusions are addressed
in many sources (Campbell 1983; Campbell and Campbell 1985; Hester 1989; John 1975;
Newcomb 1961; Swanton 1952). The various later intrusive groups, such as Tonkawa, Lipan
Apache, and Comanche, are also described by numerous researchers (Ewers 1969; Hester 1989;
Jones 1969; Kelley 1971; Newcomb 1961, 1993; Sjoberg 1953a, 1953b).
At the beginning of the seventeenth century, many south Texas Indian groups were being pushed
northward by continual Spanish expansion. By the mid-seventeenth century, a new pressure on
the Indians indigenous to the area began to come from the north: a nomadic group, the Apache
adapted to a more Plains-lifeway style of bison hunting once they acquired horses from the
Spaniards (Campbell and Campbell 1985:27). Later, the Apaches were to be displaced by another
group of nomadic, bison-hunting Indians - the Comanches - from the high-lands of central Texas
(Campbell 1991:111).
A combination of migration, demoralization, inner-group conflict, disease, and death due to
warfare fragmented the native Indian groups, and forced continual mixing and re-mixing among
them (Bolton 1915; Campbell 1975, 1991:345; León et al. 1961). Most of the native languages
have been lost, although recent attempts at reconstruction are enlightening (e.g. Johnson 1994;
Johnson and Campbell 1992).

Archaeological Atlas Site Results
We preface this section by stating that although it presents the number of sites and their types
documented within Mitchell County, the results simply provide the data that is available. In
reality, the number of documented sites and their types are very heavily skewed based upon the
types of cultural resource surveys, and the limited areas of those surveys. To wit, a review of the
Texas Atlas indicated that there were no known archaeological sites within one mile of the
Project Area. That said, the data that is available on the Texas Atlas is only as good as the surveys
13

represent. The vast majority of Mitchell County has never been subjected to formal cultural
resource surveys, so it is conceded that the true character of the archaeological record is very
poorly understood. Nevertheless, the few surveys that have been accomplished provide at least
some aspect of what the area looks like from an archaeological perspective.
The earliest professional archaeological surveys conducted in Mitchell were those by legendary
archaeologist E. B. Sayles, in the 1930s. Even with his concerted effort, since that time, only 99
archaeological sites have been recorded within all of Mitchell County. In our opinion, this
minuscule number is a true reflection on the few archaeological surveys that have been conducted
in the county, and not at all a true representation of the number of archaeological sites that
actually exist. That said, a review of the Texas Atlas indicates that forty of these sites had been
used as open campsites from as early as the Paleoindian period, and through as late as the Late
Prehistoric periods. Mortar holes representing intensive food grinding were documented at three
of the campsites, and carved petroglyphs were found at one. Forty-four sites have been classified
as prehistoric lithic scatters. Other prehistoric sites within Mitchell County include a cutbank with
exposed bison bones, a bison killsite with associated Paleoindian points, and a crevice burial.
Seventeen historic components have been recorded in the county, including the 1880s Seven
Wells Settlement, a half-dugout and well, a series of early cattle brands etched into bedrock,
WWII bombing practice targets, multiple 1900s farmsteads and trash dumps, hand-dug wells, and
a 1900s quarry operation. The three State Archaeological Landmark (SAL) in Mitchell County
include two prehistoric open campsites along Morgan Creek, and one prehistoric open campsite
along Lone Wolf Creek (Atlas 2014).

Project Goals and Methods
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with limited shovel testing. The topics addressed were
site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The prehistoric theoretical
framework is structured around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems
for the regions.
The historic framework is structured around the 1800s and 1900s settlement in the area as
documented in the earliest written accounts by Spanish priests, government representatives, and
early Anglo-American settlers, through the Mexican and Republic of Texas sovereignty periods,
and into the Texas Statehood period.
The goals of the project were to:
1)

locate and record cultural locations and sites in the project area using a systematic
survey methodology;

2)

quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy; and,

14

3)

place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

Methods and Levels of Effort
The Survey
In accordance with Texas Historical Commission (THC) and Council of Texas Archeologists
(CTA) Archaeology Survey Standards, a systematic, thorough pedestrian survey of the Project
Area linear right-of-way was conducted. Normally, the Colorado River in the area is an
intermittent drainage, usually dry and crossable. However, because the survey was conducted
immediately after a rare, torrential rainfall that lasted for four days, the Colorado River was
swollen (Figure 8) so that the eastern and western approaches to the river were surveyed on
different days.

Figure 8. Colorado River; facing northeast.
Four archaeologists meandered back and forth across the 25-meter (80-foot) wide right-of-way
to ensure more complete coverage. Because of the generally steep and gulied slopes with heavy
erosion, and the fallow field pastures on the upper-most terraces, surface visibility was greater
than 80 percent (see for example, Figures 9 and 10). Particular attention was given to the few
shallow cutbanks, and exposed bedrock was examined for possible mortar holes.

As shown in Figures 3 and 11, a total of nine shovel tests were excavated on the western and
eastern approaches to the river.

Figure 11. Pipeline right-of-way across Colorado River on aerial photograph.
The results of shovel testing were fully documented on Shovel Test forms, and the summarized
results described in accordance with standard soil descriptions are shown in Appendices A and
B,. The shovel tests were dug in 20-centimeter (cm) levels, and all sediments were screened
through 1/4-inch wire mesh (see for example, Figures 12 and 13). All shovel test locations were
documented with a hand-held GPS. In accordance with a general “no collection” policy, cultural
material of a redundant nature, both prehistoric and historic, observed either on the surface or
within shovel tests were not to be collected. Instead, they were to be fully documented via
sketches, field photographs, and copious notes. Following that they were to be returned to the
surface if surface finds, or to the top 10 cm of the shovel tests.
Exceptions were diagnostic artifacts, particularly those artifacts which could be considered as
significant to the interpretation of Texas prehistory, such as Early Archaic-Paleoindian
transitional, or Paleoindian diagnostics. These were to be collected on a case-by-case basis, and
that decision was left up to the Principal Investigator and/or the Project Archaeologist. In this
case, no artifacts of any type or kind were collected during this project.

Results of the Investigations
Tierras Antiguas conducted a thorough pedestrian survey of the right-of-way at the Colorado
River crossing, and excavated nine shovel tests on September 21 and 22, 2014. Surface visibility
ranged from 80 to greater than 95 percent along selected portions of the right-of-way (ROW). No
prehistoric or historic cultural material was observed either on the surface, in any of the nine
shovel tests excavated, or in any of the shallow cutbanks or animal backdirt piles examined.

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A thorough pedestrian survey of the surface that offered up to greater than 95 percent surface
visibility within the Project Area was conducted, along with the excavation of nine shovel tests.
No evidence of cultural material was observed either on, or below the surface within or adjacent
to the proposed right-of-way. Developers for the project, Navigator Energy Services, LLC, have
ensured that the Colorado River will be deeply bored under so that any potential cultural deposits
that may exist below the depths of our shovel tests will not be impacted. As such, Tierras
Antiguas recommends that construction of the Colorado City Mainline should be allowed to
proceed as currently designed. The project should be considered as having “no effect” on any
properties considered as eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or
inclusion in the State Archeological Landmarks Program, and as such, the project should be
allowed to proceed without further archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are
encountered during construction, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such
finds are examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and
the Texas Historical Commission.

Appendix A. Results of Shovel Testing.
The following table presents the results of shovel testing (ST) in centimeters below the surface
(cmbs). Notably, no cultural material was found in any of the nine shovel tests excavated along
the right-of-way.
Table A1. Results of Shovel Testing.
ST 1

0-3 cmbs: Pale brown (10YR 5/2) silty loam; loose, blocky, fine, weak; rare
grass rootlets; abrupt lower boundary
3-30 cmbs: Weak red (10R 5/3) silty loam; prismatic, fine, weak; few
Rabdotus shell fragments; few calcium carbonate fines increasing with
depth; gradual, smooth lower boundary
30-60 cmbs: Red (10R 4/6) loam, loose; blocky, fine, weak; no inclusions

ST 2

0-5 cmbs: Pale brown (10YR 5/2) silty loam; loose, blocky, fine, weak; rare
grass rootlets; abrupt lower boundary
5-25 cmbs: Weak red (10R 5/3) silty loam; prismatic, fine, weak; few calcium
carbonate fines increasing with depth; gradual, smooth lower
boundary
25-60 cmbs: Red (10R 4/6) loam, loose; blocky, fine, weak; no inclusions

ST 3

0-22 cmbs: Weak red (10R 5/3) silty loam; prismatic, fine, weak; few calcium
carbonate fines increasing with depth; gradual, clear, sloping lower
boundary (eroded surface)
22-60 cmbs: Red (10R 4/6) clay loam, firm; blocky, fine, moderate; no
inclusions

ST 4

0-5 cmbs: Weak red (10R 5/3) silty loam; prismatic, fine, weak; few calcium
carbonate fines increasing with depth; abrupt, sloping lower boundary
(eroded slope)
5-60 cmbs: Red (10R 4/6) clay loam, firm; blocky, fine, moderate; no
inclusions

ST 5

0-5 cmbs: Grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loamy clay mud from recent river
flooding; clear smooth lower boundary
5-60 cmbs: Reddish brown (2.5YR 4/3) fine sandy clay; blocky, fine, weak;
small roots 1/8" to 1/4" in size between 20-25 cmbs; few snail shell
fragments throughout
