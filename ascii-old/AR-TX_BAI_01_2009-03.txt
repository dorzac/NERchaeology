On July 20, 2009, archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc., conducted an intensive archeological
survey of McCarty Lane from 1,000 feet east of IH 35 to 5,170 feet east of IH 35, which includes a
crossing of Cottonwood Creek, in the City of San Marcos, Hays County, Texas prior to proposed roadway
improvements sponsored by the City of San Marcos. Investigations discovered no archeological resources
and no artifacts were collected. Curation was unnecessary.

PROJECT TITLE: Archeological Survey of McCarty Lane at Cottonwood Creek in the City of San
Marcos, Hays County, Texas.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: At the request of KBR, and on behalf of the City of San Marcos, Blanton
& Associates, Inc (B&A) conducted an archeological records review and an intensive archeological
survey of McCarty Lane from approximately 1,000 feet east of IH 35 to 5,170 feet east of IH 35 prior to
proposed roadway widening and bridge replacement construction at Cottonwood Creek in the City of San
Marcos, Hays County, Texas. Construction would occur in existing and proposed right-of-way (ROW), as
well as a proposed utility easement.
The existing McCarty Lane ROW, following recent ROW acquisition along the south side of the road, is
approximately 195 feet wide and contains a two-lane undivided roadway. The proposed construction
would reconfigure McCarty Lane to a four-lane roadway with a raised median. Construction would
require a 125-foot wide by 400-foot long corridor of proposed ROW at the eastern end of the project area,
as well as a 25-foot wide and 4,170-foot long proposed utility easement paralleling the southern edge of
the ROW. Two existing 24-inch diameter concrete culverts at Cottonwood Creek would be replaced with
a 330-foot long and 97-foot wide six-span concrete slab bridge. Additionally, the proposed construction
would require an approximately 20-foot wide by 74-foot long drainage easement north of the northern
ROW boundary just east of Cottonwood Creek. The overall project area would be approximately 4,170
feet long, 195 feet wide, encompass 18.7 acres, and extend a maximum of three feet below the ground
surface for roadway construction and approximately 15 feet below ground surface for the proposed bridge
columns.
PROJECT LOCATION: The project area is in the City of San Marcos east of IH 35. McCarty Lane is
expected to become the southern section of Loop 110 (LP 110) around the eastern side of San Marcos that
would bypass traffic around the city east of IH 35. The study area is mapped on the San Marcos South,
TX (2997-332) USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle.
TOTAL ACREAGE: Approximately 18.7 acres.
DATE OF WORK: July 20, 2009
PURPOSE OF WORK: B&A is assisting the project sponsor in their compliance with the Antiquities
Code of Texas.
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Brandon S. Young
TEXAS ANTIQUITIES PERMIT NUMBER: 5320
NEWLY RECORDED SITES: None.
PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES: None.

COMMENTS: Based on extensive disturbances from plowing, surface and subsurface utilities, as well as
a lack of archeological deposits within the project area, B&A recommends that the proposed construction
be allowed to proceed as planned within the existing and proposed ROW and planned utility easement
without additional investigations, as the survey discovered no archeological sites eligible for formal State
Archeological Landmark (SAL) designation. Further, given these conditions, it is extremely unlikely that
any previously unknown SALs or archeological historic properties eligible for the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) would be discovered during construction. If the planned construction should
require additional work space outside of the survey area, then additional cultural resource investigations
may be necessary.

On July 20, 2009 at the request of KBR, and on behalf of the City of San Marcos, B&A conducted an
intensive archeological survey of McCarty Lane from approximately 1,000 feet east of IH 35 to 5,170 feet
east of IH 35 prior to proposed roadway widening and bridge replacement construction at Cottonwood
Creek in the City of San Marcos, Hays County, Texas (Figures 1 and 2).
Construction would occur in existing and proposed right-of-way (ROW), as well as a proposed utility
easement. The existing McCarty Lane ROW, following recent ROW acquisition along the south side of
the road is approximately 195 feet wide and contains a two-lane undivided roadway. The proposed
construction would reconfigure McCarty Lane to a four-lane roadway with a raised median. Construction
would require a 125-foot wide by 400-foot long corridor of proposed ROW at the eastern end of the
project area, as well as a 25-foot wide and 4,170-foot long proposed utility easement paralleling the
southern edge of the ROW. Two existing 24-inch diameter concrete culverts at Cottonwood Creek would
be replaced with a 330-foot long and 97-foot wide six-span concrete slab bridge (Figure 3). Additionally,
the proposed construction would require an approximately 20-foot wide by 74-foot long drainage
easement north of the northern ROW boundary just east of Cottonwood Creek. The overall project area
would be approximately 4,170 feet long, 195 feet wide, encompass 18.7 acres, and extend a maximum of
three feet below the ground surface for roadway construction and approximately 15 feet below ground
surface for the proposed bridge columns.
Because the planned construction would occur on property owned by the City of San Marcos, the
proposed project is subject to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas, now subsumed in Title 13,
Part II of the Texas Administrative Code. Protection of archeological sites under state law is tied to
eligibility for formal State Archeological Landmark (SAL) status pursuant to 13 TAC 26.8. This
legislation defines the necessary conditions for recognition and preservation of SALs and requires that
any state agency must identify potential SALs through survey of public lands prior to actions that could
potentially damage those SALs. The Texas Historical Commission (THC) Division of Archeology
administers the codeâs provisions. Archeological surveys must be conducted under a Texas Antiquities
Permit issued by the THC in accordance with the provisions of the code. This project was conducted
under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 5320 issued to Principal Investigator Brandon S. Young.
The intent of the survey was to identify and describe all archeological resources discovered within the
project area, evaluate their potential eligibility for formal SAL designation and should significant cultural
resources be located, make recommendations for future cultural resource management options such as
avoidance, preservation, or further investigations.

The proposed construction area is Blackland Prairieâa rolling upland grassland covering approximately
11.5 million acres from Grayson and Red River Counties in northeast Texas to Bexar County in the
southâcentral region of the state. The area covers approximately 44,500 square kilometers. Elevations
range from 300 to 800 feet above mean sea level. Blackland Prairie soils are so named for the ubiquitous,
dark-colored calcareous clays throughout the area (Jordan et al. 1984). Land use adjacent to the project
area is agricultural (Figure 4).

Figure 4. Typical project area land cover
G E OL OG Y
Geology of the project area consists of Upper Cretaceous Pecan Gap Chalk that is described as chalk to
chalky marl with some clay. There is no Holocene alluvium mapped along Cottonwood Creek (Barnes
1974).
SOI L S
Soils in the study area belong to the Heiden-Houston Black General Map Unit. This unit consists of
primarily upland soils that developed in situ from clayey sediments and shale. Individual soils within the
project area include Branyon clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes; Heiden clay, 3 to 5 percent slopes; Houston
Black clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes; and Tinn clay, frequently flooded (Batte 1984).
Branyon series soils developed in place from clayey sediments found on ancient terraces and exhibits a
profile consisting of 100 centimeters plus of calcareous clay. Tinn clay, frequently flooded, is found on
floodplains, developed from clayey alluvium, and has a representative profile that exhibits 100
centimeters plus of dense calcareous clay.

Heiden soils are on uplands, developed in situ from clay and shale, and exhibit a typical profile of 100
centimeters plus of dense clay. Soils of the Houston series are also found in the uplands and developed in
situ from clay and shale. Heiden and Houston Black soils occupy the majority of the proposed
construction area.
Based on the above data, the geology and soil conditions throughout the majority of the study area are not
conducive to the preservation of intact buried archeological deposits except for potential alluvial soil
along Cottonwood Creek.

The existing ROW supports typical maintained roadside grasses while the adjacent existing ROW south
of the existing roadway consists of agricultural fields. Land use is the same on the north side of McCarty
Lane.

A review of data available on the THCâs online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) was conducted
to determine the presence of any previously recorded sites and/or previous project areas surveyed for
cultural resources in or adjacent to the study area. The background review indicated that there are three
previously recorded archeological sites (41HY336, 41HY403 and 41HY409) and three previous surveyed
project areas adjacent to the study area.
41H Y 336
Site 41HY336 was recorded during a 2002 survey for the City of San Marcosâ Cottonwood Creek
Wastewater Interceptor (Jones and Oksanen 2002). As mapped on TASA, the site is approximately 130
meters south-southwest of the McCarty Lane crossing of Cottonwood Creek and should not be impacted
by the proposed construction. The site consists of debris of an early 20th century homestead structure that
appears on a 1906 map. The debris consists of various structural components (e.g., sheet metal roofing
material, wooden support beams, and metal supports) that had apparently been burned. Approximately 10
concrete supports for wooden beams were noted in proximity to the structural debris. Cattle guards,
fences, and holding pens were noted immediately south of where the structure would have stood and
appear to have been constructed over some portions of the site. The soils in the area where the structure
once stood was ashy in appearance with moderate amounts of charcoal. The site was not recommended as
eligible for inclusion to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for formal SAL designation
(Jones and Oksanen 2002).
41H Y 403 A ND 41H Y 409
Site 41HY403 is a multi-component prehistoric and historic site consisting of a historic well and
associated domestic scatter (sparse), as well as four chipped-stone debitage specimens recorded during the
survey for the proposed LP 110 corridor north of, and adjacent to, McCarty Lane on the south bank of
Cottonwood Creek. There currently is no record of a survey report (TASA 2009). Given a lack of intact
structural features, lack of prehistoric materials, and soil and geologic contexts, the site was not
recommended as eligible for inclusion to the NRHP or formal SAL designation (TASA 2009).
Historic site 41HY409 consists of structural remains of a wooden house with a surface and subsurface (0
to 15 centimeters below ground surface) scatter of pieces of wood (some with wire nails), unidentified
wire fragments, tile, and miscellaneous glass and metal fragments. A small concrete driveway leads onto
McCarty Lane. Given a lack of intact structural features, few prehistoric materials, and soil and geologic
contexts, the site was not recommended as eligible for inclusion to the NRHP or formal SAL designation
(TASA 2009).
The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) sponsored a cultural resources survey of an existing
transmission line prior to proposed re-construction. The northeast to southwest trending transmission line
crosses McCarty Lane approximately 700 feet east of Cottonwood Creek (TASA 2009).

B&A conducted an intensive 100 percent pedestrian archeological survey of McCarty Lane with
subsurface investigations as necessary. During the previous 2008 survey for parts of LP 110,
archeologists examined the area north of, and adjacent to, the northern ROW boundary of McCarty Lane
(TASA 2009). This included the location of the planned drainage easement and, as such, B&A limited
investigations there to surface examinations.
Surface investigations consisted of an inspection of the ground surface within existing and proposed
ROW and utility easement, as well as areas visible from the proposed ROW on adjacent private property.
Given a lack of alluvium and terrace development on Cottonwood Creek, as well as previous disturbances
within existing ROW from utilities and roadway construction, as well as plowing in proposed ROW,
backhoe trenching was unwarranted and subsurface investigations were accomplished with judgmental
shovel testing. Shovel tests were 30 to 40 centimeters in width and excavated with a square-head shovel
to a maximum depth of 50 centimeters below ground surface or until soil conditions prohibited further
excavation. Deeper shovel tests were deemed unnecessary in the upland clay soils of the study area that
developed in situ. All sediments removed from shovel tests were screened through 0.25-inch wire mesh
and shovel test data was recorded on B&A shovel test form and plotted with hand-held GPS receivers.
The survey was designed to comply with appropriate archeological survey methods as defined in the
Department of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the Guidelines of the Council of
Texas Archeologists (1987), and survey standards developed by the THC in conjunction with the Council
of Texas Archeologists (THC n.d.).

R E SUL T S OF I NV E ST I G A T I ONS
Intensive surface and subsurface investigations on McCarty Lane and Cottonwood Creek discovered no
archeological resources, including any traces of nearby previously recorded sites 41HY336, 41HY403,
and 41HY409 within existing and proposed ROW and the planned utility easement (Figure 5).
Subsurface investigations consisted of judgmental shovel test (ST) excavations. A total of eight STs
(1 through 8) were excavated to test for buried archeological deposits and confirm consistent soil
conditions throughout the survey area (Table 1). Shovel tests extended to a maximum depth of 50
centimeters below ground surface and yielded no buried archeological materials, only dense blackland
clay with an approximately 15- to 35-centimeter thick plow zone overlying dense clay subsoil.
Cottonwood Creek exhibits no terrace development or recent alluvium so backhoe trenching was deemed
unnecessary (Figure 6).
Given the lack of recent alluvium along Cottonwood Creek, the project areaâs dense blackland clay that
developed in situ from ancient marine sediments, previous surface and subsurface impacts from plowing,
utilities (in the existing roadway), and roadway construction, it is the opinion of B&A that there is little to
no potential for the study area to contain intact archeological deposits.

SUM M A R Y A ND R E C OM M E NDA T I ONS
Intensive archeological survey of the McCarty Lane at Cottonwood Creek discovered no archeological
resources, including traces of nearby previously recorded historic sites 41HY336, 41HY403, and
41HY409. Soils in the study area are primarily upland soils that developed in situ and are not conducive
for containing buried intact archeological deposits. Cottonwood Creek exhibits no terrace development or
recent alluvium in the study area so backhoe trenching was unwarranted. Further, the project area has
experienced surface and subsurface disturbances from plowing, buried utilities, drainage improvements,
and roadway construction.
The above data suggest that there is little to no potential for the proposed and existing McCarty Lane
ROW, as well as the proposed utility easement, to contain previously unidentified SALs (13 TAC 26.12).
B&A recommends therefore that because no archeological deposits were discovered within and the
geology, soils, and levels of disturbance within the project area are not conducive to the preservation of
archeological deposits, the proposed construction should not affect any SALs and should be allowed to
proceed as planned without additional investigations.
If it is determined that additional ROW or utility easement is required, then additional archeological
investigations may be necessary in those areas. In the event that previously unidentified cultural materials
are discovered during construction, work in the immediate area of discovery would cease and the THC
will be contacted to initiate accidental discovery procedures.
