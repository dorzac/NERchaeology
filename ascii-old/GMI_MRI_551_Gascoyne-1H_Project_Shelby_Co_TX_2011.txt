MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

This report presents the results of a cultural resources survey for the proposed Gascoyne #1H well
pad location in southeastern Shelby County, Texas. This cultural resources investigation was
conducted by Geo-Marine, Inc., under subcontract to Titanium Environmental Services, LLC, for
XTO Energy, Inc. The purpose of this document is to provide data for use in the management of
cultural resources in partial fulfillment of obligations under Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966 (P.L. 96-515), as amended, and other cultural resources legislation.
Cultural resources investigations consisted of a records search to identify previous cultural
resources surveys conducted in the area and the archeological and historic sites recorded by those
efforts, visual inspection of the project area, and subsurface investigations via the excavation of
screened shovel tests and the examination of exposed soil profiles. Fieldwork for this project was
conducted on 28 June 2011. A total of 17.2 acres was investigated during this survey effort. Site
41SY362, an early-to-mid-twentieth-century domestic site, was documented as part of this
cultural resources survey. The site is recommended as not eligible for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places. This survey encountered no significant cultural resources in the
project area. Construction of the Gascoyne #1H well pad will have no adverse effect on any
significant cultural resources. Provided the project is carried out as proposed, no further cultural
resources investigations are recommended.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

This report presents results of a cultural resources survey for the proposed Gascoyne #1H well
pad and associated lease road, conducted by Geo-Marine, Inc., (Geo-Marine Project No.
30563.02.26) under subcontract to Titanium Environmental Services, LLC, for XTO Energy, Inc.
The proposed project area is located on a fluvial terrace above North Bayou Blue in southeastern
Shelby County, Texas (Figure 1). The community of Dreka, Texas, is located approximately 2
kilometers (km; 1.2 miles [mi]) to the southwest.
The Gascoyne #1H project area consists of a 5.5-acre well pad and 646 feet (ft; 197 meters [m])
of lease road right-of-way (ROW). The landscape encompassing the proposed project area
consists of agricultural operations, managed timberlands, and energy resources extraction
infrastructure. This proposed infrastructure will be constructed on private property owned by
Donald and Lois Orear of Shelbyville, Texas. A previously proposed well to be drilled from this
location was to target geology with federal mineral rights and thus required Bureau of Land
Management (BLM) permitting. Therefore, this cultural resources survey was conducted as per
BLM guidelines for review by that agency. As per BLM cultural resources survey requirements,
a 10-acre survey buffer around the proposed well pad and a 15-m (50-ft) buffer along the
proposed lease road resulted in an intensive cultural resources survey of approximately 17.2 acres
for this project. Fieldwork for this project was conducted on 28 June 2011 by Geo-Marine
Project Archeologist Christopher Goodmaster and Staff Archeologist Lindsey Skelton. Melissa
Green served as the project Principal Investigator throughout the process of this investigation.
The proposed well has since been modified to avoid federal minerals. This infrastructure, as it is
currently proposed, does not require any federal oversight.

CHAPTER 2
NATURAL ENVIRONMENT

The proposed project area is located on a terrace above North Bayou Blue in the southeastern
portion of Shelby County in East Texas. The project area is situated in the Tertiary uplands of the
South Central Plains (Griffith et al. 2004). The soils of the region are derived from in situ
weathering of the underlying Wilcox Formation (Griffith 2006). This area is located within the
Austroriparian biotic province (Blair 1950; Dice 1943). Often referred to as the Pineywoods
(Gould et al. 1960), this region once supported a diverse variety of flora and fauna.

GEOMORPHOLOGY
Shelby County is located within the South Central Plains physiographic region of Texas. This
region is characterized by rolling or hummocky plains underlain by the stratified shales and
sandstones of the Wilcox Formation (Bureau of Economic Geology 1993). The project area is
located within the Tertiary Uplands subregion of the South Central Plains in the Sabine River
basin. Situated on a fluvial terrace above North Bayou Blue (Figure 2), the proposed project area
occupies an elevation range of 79–83 m (259–272 ft) above mean sea level (amsl) on slopes of 0–
2 percent.

HYDROLOGY
The project area is within the Sabine River basin. Numerous unnamed, small-order drainages
extend across the floodplains and rolling uplands of the area, creating a complex network of
streams, swamps, and sloughs. The proposed project area is located on a fluvial terrace to the
north of North Bayou Blue (see Figure 2). North Bayou Blue continues to flow in a northeastern
direction for approximately 6.1 km (3.8 mi) to its confluence with South Bayou Blue before
entering Toledo Bend Reservoir.

SOILS
The Gascoyne #1H project area is situated within the Gallime soil series (Table 1; see Figure 2).
All information regarding the soils of the project area has been synthesized and summarized from
data provided by the Soil Conservation Service (Griffith 2006) and the Natural Resources
Conservation Service (2011).

Description

Gallime series

Terraces

Fine sandy loam, well-drained, moderately permeable

Gallime series soils are classified as Glossic Paleudalfs and tend to be well-drained, moderately
permeable soils formed on Pleistocene terraces. Gallime soils typically exhibit a brown fine
sandy loam Ap horizon, approximately 25 centimeters (cm; 10 inches [in]) thick, overlying a light
yellowish brown fine sandy loam E horizon. A series of yellowish brown sandy clay loam Bt/E
horizons typically extend from a depth of 70–158 cm (28–62 in).

FLORA AND FAUNA
This region is located within the Austroriparian biotic province (Blair 1950; Dice 1943) and
supports a variety of flora and fauna. The environs encompassing the project area consist of an
array of subtropical terrestrial communities. These ecosystems support a diverse range of fauna,
including several endangered or threatened species. The Sabine and Angelina rivers support a
diverse biotic community, characterized by hydrophilic vegetation and numerous aquatic
vertebrates and invertebrates that include 32 varieties of mussel (Unionidae) and 104 species of
freshwater fish (Dahm et al. 2005). Mammal species in the area, either presently or historically,
include deer (Odocoileus virginianus), cougar (Puma concolor), feral hogs (Sus scrofa), black
bear (Ursus americanus), squirrel (Sciurus spp.), rabbit (Sylvilagus spp.), opossum (Didelphis
virginiana), and raccoon (Procyon lotor).
Once blanketed by oak-hickory-pine forests, the area now supports loblolly and shortleaf pine and
is locally referred to as the Pineywoods (Gould et al. 1960). As the name implies, coniferous
forest ecosystems dominate much of the region, although variations in soil types, topography, and
drainage allow for areas of native hardwoods such as oaks (Quercus sp.), elms (Elmus sp.),
hickories (Carya sp.), pecan (C. illinoinensis), black walnut (Juglans nigra), tupelo (Nyssa sp.),
sweetgum (Liquidambar sp.), and others. Shortleaf (Pinus echinata), longleaf (P. palustris), and
loblolly pine (P. taeda) are the three native species of southern yellow pine. Uplands may harbor
certain hardwoods, such as post oak (Q. stellata) and blackjack oak (Q. marilandica).
Bottomlands near rivers and other major drainages are most often dominated by native
bottomland hardwoods such as water oak (Q. nigra), cherrybark oak (Q. pagoda), nutall oak (Q.
nuttallii), black hickory (C. texana), bitternut hickory (C. cordiformis), black tupelo (N.
sylvatica), and sweetgum. Dense understory growth may often be found in forest areas in the
form of woody shrubs and small trees such as yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), wax myrtle (Myrica
5

cerifera), American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), rusty blackhaw viburnum (Viburnum
rufidulum), and other species. In recent years, invasive species such as Chinese tallow (Triadica
sebifera), Japanese climbing fern (Lygodium japonicum), and soda apple (Solanum viarum) have
become well established throughout the Pineywoods as well. Much of the general area is
managed coniferous timberlands.

CLIMATE
The climate of the project area is humid and subtropical. The weather typically consists of hot
summers with high humidity and short winters because of the influence of the Gulf of Mexico.
Average annual precipitation measures approximately 135 cm (53 in), primarily as rainfall
distributed uniformly throughout the year. The average summer temperature recorded in nearby
Center, Texas, is around 27 degrees Celsius (°C; 80°Fahrenheit [F]), and the average winter
temperature is 8°C (47°F), with temperatures seldom dropping below 0°C (32°F).

CHAPTER 3
CULTURAL CONTEXT

The following chapter presents a brief synopsis, based on regional archeology, of Native
American cultural chronology and Euro-American history of Northeast Texas. Given the size of
the region and the depth and breadth of cultural complexity that has developed in the area, this
chapter must necessarily be limited in scope. References are provided to supplement the
information summarized here.

NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY
The earliest known inhabitants of the Pineywoods of Northeast Texas were the broad-spectrum
hunter-gathers loosely referred to as the Paleoindian culture. Over several thousand years, these
nomadic people adopted more-restricted territories and targeted the abundant game and other
resources in the region, typically moving in seasonal rounds to procure various foods and raw
materials. The subsequent period of prehistory is generally referred to as the Archaic period.
Given the abundant nature of resources in the Pineywoods region, the local populations continued
this way of life for several millennia. By the Middle Archaic period, the people of Northeast
Texas began cultivating starchy and oily seed plants and, in the Late Archaic period, became
active in expansive intraregional social networks based on trade and shared religious beliefs.
Gradually, the Archaic lifestyle became increasingly sedentary, due in part to increased reliance
on horticulture and the development of ceramics. By the Woodland period, the manufacture and
use of ceramics became widespread. The Woodland period continued to expand in cultural
complexity for at least a millennia, resulting in an increase in settled villages, the expansion of
extensive long-distance trade networks, the construction of burial mounds and the development of
elaborate ritual practices, the domestication and cultivation of native plants with starchy and oily
seeds, and the rise of societies led by hereditary leaders. From these roots developed the
foundation of the Caddo culture. Over the last millennia, the Caddo settled in permanent villages
and continued the development of maize agriculture and other effective methods of food
gathering, processing, and storage, elaborate ritual life, ranked societies, mound-building,
ancestor veneration, ritual and political centers, long-distance exchange, warfare, competition,
and sophisticated craft production.

HISTORIC EURO-AMERICAN ERA
The period of European exploration and settlement and the subsequent Euro-American and
African-American development of Northeast Texas is briefly discussed in the remaining portions
of this chapter to provide a historic context for the evaluation of site 41SY362. For more
extensive treatments of this period in Northeast Texas, see Peter and Cliff (1990:Chapters 3 and
7) and Peter et al. (1991:Appendix J).

Spanish and French Colonization (A.D. 1542–1803)
The initial European penetration into the general area of North Texas occurred in the middle of
the sixteenth century (ca. 1542) when the survivors of the Hernando de Soto entrada, led by Luís
de Moscoso de Alvarado after de Soto’s death, entered Texas in their attempt to reach New Spain
by land (Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1991; Weddle 1985). Although Moscoso’s exact route is
unknown, archeological studies indicate that he apparently traversed the Red River valley
8

somewhere between present-day Shreveport, Louisiana, and Texarkana, Texas. The party
crossed the Red River and journeyed through northcentral Texas to present-day Wichita Falls
before returning to the Mississippi River to travel to the Gulf of Mexico.
In the late 1600s, the Spanish introduced the first of their missions into East Texas. The goal of
these missions was to eradicate the indigenous religions and to Christianize the native
populations. The Spanish established missions—San Francisco de los Tejas and Santísimo
Nombre de María—in the Hasinai area in 1690, but abandoned them in 1693 when failing to
convert and control the local population (Swanton 1942:46–49).
The French, led by René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, first ventured across eastern Texas
when establishing Fort Saint Louis in 1685 along the central Texas coast in present-day Victoria
County (Davis and Bruseth 2000; Fort St. Louis 2009; John 1975:182), and in 1714, Louis
Juchereau de St. Denis set up a trading post at Natchitoches, in present-day Louisiana. Spanish
fear of an increased French presence in Texas led to the decision in 1716 to try again to establish
a series of missions and presidios in present-day East Texas—this time a second Mission San
Francisco de los Tejas near the Neches River, Nuestra Señora de la Purísima Concepción (later
relocated to the San Antonio area in 1731) on the Angelina River, the Nuestra Señora de
Guadalupe at present-day Nacogdoches, and San Jose de los Nazonis in northwestern present-day
Nacogdoches County—as well as Nuestra Señora de los Ais and San Miguel de Linares de los
Adaes in present-day Louisiana as a buffer against further French encroachment into that region
(Cooper et al. 2003; Pool 1975:28; Swanton 1942:46–49). When France and Spain went to war,
the French at Natchitoches attacked the Spanish settlement of Los Adaes, forcing the Spanish to
abandon the area once again (Newcomb 1961:288). After the truce in 1721, Spanish
representative Marques de Aguayo persuaded the French to withdraw from Texas. He
reestablished the missions and set Los Adaes as the capital of the Province of Texas.
In the Red River area, the French established Le Poste des Cadodaquious in present-day Bowie
County in 1719, and explored what is now Franklin County (Harper 2002). Bénard de la Harpe’s
1719 trading post (which became known as the Nassonite Post) on the Red River north of
present-day Texarkana was the first European settlement in the Great Bend (Cooper et al. 2003;
Kelley and Coxe 1996:21). Another effort by Spain to curb French influence occurred in 1760
when Fray Jose Francisco de Calahorra y Saenz led an expedition to present-day Rains County to
make peace with the Native American tribes in Northcentral Texas. These trading posts
eventually served as illicit trading centers between the two European colonies: modern-day
archeological investigations have yielded artifacts of both Spanish and French origin that would
suggest that the different cultures interacted at the trading sites. After briefly regaining control of
the area, the French sold it as part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803.

American Immigration (A.D. 1806–1830)
Following the sale of Louisiana to the United States in 1803, Anglo-American immigration into
North Texas intensified, although for a number of years it was not clear who actually owned the
area south of the Red River. The United States considered it (and indeed, most of Texas) to be
part of the Louisiana Purchase and encouraged settlement of the area (Chandler and Howe 1939).
Spain (and later Mexico), on the other hand, was violently opposed to this view, and at several
times during the first few decades of the nineteenth century the dispute nearly led to war (Smith
1991). The first official Anglo-American penetration of the region was by the Freeman-Custis
9

Expedition of 1806, which was turned back at Spanish Bluffs, along the Red River, by a Spanish
military force (Flores 1984). Early on, the area of Shelby County became known as a refuge for
outlaws and fugitives for its proximity to the “neutral ground,” a disputed area between Spanish
and American territories until 1806 (Coleman et al. 1984; Neill 1950).
By 1818, John Latham, the first Anglo-American resident of Shelby County, settled in the
southeastern portion of the area (Harper 2009). However, during that time, Mexico restricted
settlements near the boundary of Texas, curtailed legitimate settlements, and encouraged
squatters, resulting in violence and low population of the area (Harper 2009). In addition, the
already existent population of outlaws and fugitives was not a positive in attracting settlers to the
area (Coleman et al. 1984). The Mexican government first organized Shelby County as a
Tenehaw Municipality, which was part of the Nacogdoches Municipality, and established
Nashville as the county seat in 1824 (Coleman et al. 1984; Harper 2009).
Despite Spain’s claim, North Texas was too close to the United States not to fall into the AngloAmerican sphere of influence, and settlement continued. The earliest settlements were confined
to the areas immediately adjacent to the Red River, but after 1818, settlement pushed into the
prairies along river tributaries and early roads such as Dayton’s Road and Trammel’s Trace, the
present western boundary of Panola County (LaGrone 2008). Trammel’s Trace, a popular
immigrant route into Texas after 1813, crossed the Sulphur River at Epperson’s Ferry and
continued southwestward through Cass County to Hughes Springs, founded in 1839, and then
south to cross Cypress Creek 2 miles west of modern Jefferson (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:793–
794). Dayton’s Road was a major east–west overland route that ran along the divide between the
Sulphur and Red rivers.
The original Anglo-American settlers in Texas were largely subsistence farmers residing on small
holdings, with an economy based on grain and livestock production (Peter and Cliff 1990:36).
The commercial production of cotton apparently was not introduced until the 1830s (Fehrenbach
1968), a shift that was accompanied by increasing numbers of slaves into the region.

Texas Independence (A.D. 1836–1846)
As settlers began to move into Texas, they remained initially under Spanish and later under
Mexican control until the struggle for Texas independence in 1836. For the most part, North
Texas was beyond the direct sphere of the conflict associated with the fight for Texas
independence: that conflict played out primarily in South and Central Texas in 1835 and 1836.
The most significant change thereafter involved decrees by President Mirabeau Lamar, the
second president of Texas, to make the settlers of the Texas Republic safe from marauding Native
Americans by adopting an Indian removal or extermination program. Active efforts to drive off
or exterminate the Native Americans in North Texas had been under way for some time. In one
instance in 1837, a group of Texas Rangers under the command of Lt. A. B. Van Benthuysen
camped on Turtle Creek after conducting raids on Indians to the north (Maxwell 2002).
Subsequently, many native groups who used the Trinity River basin relocated north of the Red
River.
In 1836 the Congress of the Republic of Texas officially named the county after Isaac Shelby,
who was a Revolutionary War hero and governor of Kentucky (Coleman et al. 1984:19; Harper
2009). The town of Center officially became the county seat in 1866 and currently retains this
10

title (Harper 2009). From 1840 to 1844 a series of small, armed conflicts
Regulator-Moderator War occurred as a result of fraudulent land transactions
(Coleman et al. 1984:19; Harper 2009). Although the war caused a great deal of
the economy, the county was able to recover, and by 1847 the population
approximately 3,500 residents (Harper 2009).

Early Texas Statehood (A.D. 1846–1861)
Texas traded its independence for U.S. statehood on December 29, 1845, entering the union as
the twenty-eighth state. The majority of the settlers moving into Shelby County came from other
Southern states and thus introduced large-scale agriculture, livestock raising, and slavery into the
area (Harper 2009). Because slave ownership was not as predominant in Shelby County, it was
primarily restricted to white upper-class Anglo-Americans (Harper 2009). During the antebellum
period, the county was, for the most part, rural and agricultural, with most of the county’s
residents living on farms (Harper 2009). The largest crop of any kind and the most important
food crop was corn (Harper 2009). However, continuing with the Southern tradition, cotton was
grown and sold, making it the largest cash crop for the county (Harper 2009). Additionally,
farmers grew oats, raised cattle, sheep and hogs, and sold wool for profit (Harper 2009).
Texas, however, did not remain a state for long. Sectarian politics were raised to a fever pitch
during that period, and after the presidential election of 1860, Texas began to consider secession.
The sympathies of most of the Anglo-American residents of North Texas lay with the secessionist
southerners; after all, a majority of them had immigrated from the South, the region as a whole
had a substantial slave population, and the cash economy of the area was built on slave-based
agriculture even though most of the individual farmers could not afford to own slaves. In most of
Northeast and Northcentral Texas, anti-Union feelings ran high (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:306),
and nearly all the counties in the area voted to secede—though some, like Delta County, did
support Sam Houston’s Unionist forces during the early part of the war (Hervey 1951). On
February 1, 1861, Texas became a part of the Confederate States of America. Shelby County's
white inhabitants overwhelmingly supported the secession movement during the winter of 1860–
1861 (Harper 2009). When the secession ordinance was submitted for popular approval in
February 1861, county voters approved the measure by a vote of 333 to 28 (Harper 2009).

Civil War (A.D. 1861–1865)
The white residents of Shelby County wholeheartedly supported the war effort of the
Confederacy (Harper 2009). One county source estimated that as many as 750 men from Shelby
County served in either Texas or Confederate army units (Harper 2009). Shelby County was
never occupied by Union forces and thus escaped the destruction that devastated other parts of the
South. However, the people and the economy still suffered with drops in demand, fluctuations in
currency, an increase in competition for resources, and loss of friends and loved ones (Harper
2009).
Northeastern Texas escaped serious, direct effects from the Civil War, being too far west of
centers of fighting to the east and south to be affected by Union forces, and too far east of
frontier to be affected by the resurgence of Native American problems that accompanied
withdrawal of U.S. and Texas military forces (Pool 1975:110–113). The defeat of

Confederacy in 1865 brought with it the end of slavery in Texas, the breakdown of the old slavebased plantation system, and the presence of a Union army of occupation.

Postbellum Texas (A.D. 1865–1920)
The end of slavery brought many changes in the economy of rural Northeast Texas. Lacking the
cheap and dependable labor resources provided by slavery, the large plantations of the prewar
period ceased to be economically feasible and many were broken up and partially sold off. Most
of the land put on the market found its way into the hands of speculators and investors, with the
result that a new system of sharecropping or tenant farming replaced the old plantation system.
Productive land was now often held by absentee landlords, with the labor supplied by AfricanAmerican or poor Anglo-American sharecroppers or tenants. Although most former slaves
remained in the county, many left the farms seeking better working conditions or establishing
their own farms (Harper 2009). Unfortunately, the majority of former slaves became
sharecroppers, a situation that did not leave much room for improvement from their former
condition (Harper 2009). Gradually, however, a small portion of the black population
accumulated enough capital to move into the class of landowning farmers (Harper 2009). In 1870
one black farmer owned his land, but by 1910 almost one-third of all black farmers were
landowners (Harper 2009). In addition to losing the main source of labor, white farmers also
faced serious plummets in property values. In 1859 slaves constituted 50 percent of all taxable
property in the county, but with the end of slavery and the reduced status of the South, property
values decreased by almost 40 percent, creating serious economic loss (Harper 2009). Although
this system failed to improve the lot of the sharecroppers and tenants, it was a successful
replacement for the prewar system, and by the beginning of the twentieth century, the bulk of the
rural farms in Northeast Texas were operated by sharecroppers or tenants.
After 1870, the population of North Texas began to increase, and the region began to recover
from the worst effects of the war and the subsequent recession. One of the most important factors
in this recovery was the increasing role of the railroad in the regional economy. Before the Civil
War, Shelby County had been predominantly rural, using waterways, mainly the Sabine River, to
export crops to the larger market centers (Coleman et al. 1984:19; Harper 2009). A small amount
of railroad construction had occurred prior to the outbreak of the war, when more than 50 miles of
track had been laid westward from Texarkana in 1857 by the Memphis, El Paso, and Pacific
Railroad. Following the end of the war, construction did not resume for four more years. When
it finally did, though, it continued at a relatively steady rate. In 1871 and 1872, the Texas and
Pacific Railroad went through the southern corner of Upshur County and the eastern portion of
Cass and Marion counties. In 1876, the East Line and Red River Railroad (later part of the
Louisiana and Arkansas), building west from Jefferson, crossed western Marion County and the
southwestern portion of Cass County. In the Pineywoods of northeastern Texas, the Houston, East
and West Texas Railway from Houston to Shreveport was completed in 1882, quickly followed by
the Kansas and Gulf Short Line; the Texas Southeastern; the Groveton, Lufkin and Northern; the
Texas and New Orleans; and the Angelina and Neches River railroads. With the completion of a
local railroad line from Longview into the county in 1885, the already important logging industry
intensified, and continued to do so as the rail line was upgraded and extended to Carthage in 1888
and eventually became part of the Gulf, Colorado, and Santa Fe Railway (LaGrone 2008). The
Houston East and West Texas Railway was built through the northern portion of the county, and
in 1904 the Gulf, Beaumont and Great Northern Railroad was completed, crossing through the
center of the county from north to south (Harper 2009). New towns emerged along these railroad
12

routes and developed as important shipping centers (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:306). With the
arrival of the railroad, several towns, including Timpson, Tenaha, and Joaquin, were established
and became quite prominent in Shelby County (Coleman et al. 1984:19; McCoy 1981). As a
result, the lumber business began to grow, providing new job opportunities in industry (Coleman
et al. 1984:19; Harper 2009).
The continuing expansion of the railroads after 1870, and the improved communications they
brought, spurred the development of other local industries as well. During this period, lumbering
assumed its place as an important industry in many areas of the Pineywoods of northeastern
Texas (Chandler 1937). The Houston, East and West Texas Railway and the Gulf, Beaumont,
and Great Northern Railroad allowed transportation of lumber from timber-rich Polk, Angelina,
San Augustine, San Jacinto, Shelby, Trinity, and Nacogdoches counties. Sawmills to process this
lumber also sprang up throughout these East Texas counties, especially in the town of Lufkin and
Angelina County, which led to innovations for lumber and paper production and provided another
major source of employment (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:824). All of these mills helped supply
raw material to factories located in Texarkana and in other large towns (Webb and Carroll
1952:1:198).
In spite of the steady growth in nonagricultural industries during these years, farming continued
to be important in East Texas, with the small, owner-operated farm still prominent. Despite the
inequities of the sharecropper and tenant systems, the participants were not locked into the system
as had been the case under slavery, and in the last three decades of the nineteenth century
increasing numbers of African-Americans achieved the status of small landowners. Regardless of
their status, they often settled in dispersed rural communities separate from those of their white
neighbors.

Modern Texas (A.D. 1920–Present)
After the Civil War, agriculture and population began a slow, steady increase, and by 1940 the
number of farms and people had increased six-fold since 1870, but the percentage of farm
landowners had decreased from 77 percent in 1890 to 30 percent by 1930 (Harper 2009). Cotton
and corn were still the main crops being harvested by 1940, but most farmers still used the same
old methods used during the antebellum period (Harper 2009). Although there were increases in
crop production and population, prosperity was still limited (Harper 2009). By 1940,
approximately 90 percent of farmsteads were still without electricity and phone lines. Even as
agriculture formed the economic base of the county, manufacturing and industry provided some
jobs and a portion of the income in Shelby County.
After World War II, the population in Shelby County began to decline. By 1940, two major
highways crossed the county: U.S. Highway 96, which traverses the center of the county from
north to south, and U.S. Highway 84, which traverses the northern portion of the county from east
to west. In 1950, the Sabine River Authority was created, and in 1960, Toledo Bend Reservoir
was dedicated (Coleman et al. 1984:22). By 1970, the population was on the rise again; however,
the majority of the inhabitants were between the ages of 35 and 64, indicating that the youth of
the area were still moving out of the county (Harper 2009). Leading industries of Shelby County
included sawmills, poultry and egg processing, road construction, agribusiness, general
construction, and the manufacture of hardwood flooring, hardwood veneer, and plywood.
Mineral resources included lignite coal, sand, oil, and gas. Pine and hardwood production in
13

1981 totaled 14,867,416 cubic feet, the overwhelming majority of which was pine production
(Harper 2009). The Sabine National Forest also currently contributes to attracting tourists and
providing lumber, grazing, oil production, hunting, and recreation (Harper 2009; Miller and Tull
1984).

CHAPTER 4
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS AND METHODOLOGY

The cultural resources survey recorded in this document was designed to identify both prehistoric
and historic archeological sites along with important architectural resources located within the
proposed project area. This work was undertaken with two primary management goals in mind:
1. To locate cultural resources occurring within the designated survey areas
2. To assess the significance of those resources in regard to their potential for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
The first of these goals was accomplished by a program of background and archival research,
intensive pedestrian survey, and shovel test excavations undertaken using the field methods
described in this chapter. The second goal consists of assessment and evaluation based on
National Register criteria defined in 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) §60.4 (National Park
Service 1990).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS IN THE PROJECT AREA
To determine previous cultural resources survey efforts as well as the locations of previously
recorded historic or archeological resources in the project area, the Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas online database maintained by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) was consulted.
Review of THC records indicated that four previous cultural resources surveys have been
conducted within a 1.6-km (1-mi) radius of the project area. One of these surveys was conducted
within the Sabine National Forest by the U.S. Forest Service in 1982. The additional three
surveys were conducted by Deep East Texas Archeological Consultants between 2005 and 2008
for well pads and their associated lease roads constructed by Ellora Energy, LP. No archeological
sites have been previously recorded within the 1.6 km (1 mi) search radius; however, two
historic-period cemeteries are located in this vicinity (Table 3). The Duncan Cemetery,
established in 1864 with the burial of Benjamin H. Schooler, is located 1 km (0.6 mi) southeast of
the proposed project area. The Latham Cemetery, established in 1855 with the interment of John
Latham, Jr., is located 1 km (0.6 mi) to the northwest. Neither of these cemeteries will be
adversely affected by the proposed undertaking.

Although no previously recorded prehistoric archeological sites exist within the immediate
vicinity of the proposed project area, prehistoric sites are not uncommon across the region. These
sites tend to be located along second- and third-order streams, where the availability of water and
food resources was typically reliable in the past. Given its location on a terrace above North
Bayou Blue, the project area was considered to have at least a moderate probability of containing
prehistoric cultural remains. Various sources of historical and geographic data were consulted to
ascertain the likelihood of historic-era cultural resources existing within the proposed project
area. These materials include historic highway maps, topographic maps, and soil surveys (which
often record cultural resources such as cemeteries, houses, and related features) and aerial
photography. Based on a review of these historic records and previously recorded archeological
site locations, it is evident that the area has experienced a dynamic history. Evaluating these
sources with more recent records, however, indicates that the substantial development has
occurred in recent years, altering much of the historic landscape. Historic period habitation
within the region was minimal during the nineteenth century, but settlement increased markedly
during the twentieth century and several structures are indicated on historic-period topographic
and highway maps of the area. Therefore, the project area is considered to have at a moderate to
high probability of containing historic sites.

METHODOLOGY

Survey Methods
Based on the background and archival research conducted, it was determined that the proposed
Gascoyne #1H well pad project area had a moderate to high probability of containing cultural
resources. Given the amount of groundcover and the nature of archeological sites in the region, it
was assumed that ground visibility in the project area would not be conducive to visual inspection
and that subsurface excavation via shovel testing would be necessary to adequately survey the
area.
Shovel tests consisted of hand-excavated units 30–40 cm (11.8–15.7 in) in diameter excavated in
20-cm (7.9-in) levels, with the excavated soil passed through a 0.64-cm (0.25-in) hardware mesh
screen to recover artifacts. Shovel tests were excavated systematically across the proposed
project area to depths of 1 m (3.3 ft), to the extent of Holocene deposits, or until an obstruction
such as the water table or fragipan was encountered. The location of each shovel test was
recorded with a submeter-accurate Trimble® GeoXT™ global positioning system (GPS) unit,
and the exposed soil profile documented. Each shovel test was backfilled upon completion of the
recording process. Areas that were completely disturbed by features such as roads, stock ponds,
or other construction were systematically investigated and documented, but not shovel-tested.
16

Areas of exposed soil, either on the surface or in profile (e.g., cutbanks), were also examined for
cultural materials as they were encountered during survey. As per BLM cultural resources survey
requirements, a buffer area of 10 acres around the proposed well pad location and a 15-m (50-ft)
buffer along the proposed lease road was surveyed. This resulted in the cultural resources survey
of approximately 17.2 acres for this project.

Archeological Site Definition
An archeological site is typically considered to be a spatially discrete area containing cultural
resources. The definition of a “site” is therefore contingent on the basis of content and extent.
Content may refer to artifacts recovered from surface or subsurface contexts, architectural
features, or other manifestations of past human activity. The extent of a site is based on the
horizontal and vertical spatial arrangement of these cultural remains. When only surficial
materials are encountered, a site is defined as five or more cultural artifacts or features of at least
two different materials or functional classes located within the same vicinity (typically a 400-m2­
area [0.1 acre]); the extent of the surface material is then defined as the site boundary. When
artifacts are encountered in buried contexts, a site is defined within the extent of the culturally
positive excavations. In cases where a shovel test yields cultural materials, additional delineation
shovel tests are excavated to define the boundary of the site. Shovel tests used to define and
delineate a site are typically placed at intervals of 10 m (33 ft) in a cruciform pattern (in each of
the cardinal directions) around the positive shovel test until two negative shovel tests, or the
project area boundaries, are reached. In general, if two or more positive shovel tests are
encountered and contain at least five artifacts of at least two classes of cultural materials, a site is
then defined within the extent of positive shovel tests. Sites may also be defined within an area
of surface artifacts or features and culturally positive excavations, when both are present.
Cultural remains meeting these criteria are designated as a site, recorded on a Texas
Archeological Site Data Form, and submitted to the Texas Archeological Research Lab (TARL)
to be included in the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas database. Conversely, the discovery of
cultural materials that do not meet these criteria are considered isolated occurrences of past
human activity and are simply documented by location and content; likewise, modern material
representing an obvious single-event trash dump is not considered a site, with only location and
content documented.
Depending on depositional integrity and cultural content, archeological sites can be eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP. Isolated artifacts are not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP because of
their failure to meet the site definition and their lack of significance in contributing important
information to the archeological record.

Artifact Treatment and Analysis
Each artifact is thoroughly examined in order to identify and determine, to the extent possible, its
function or role and cultural or chronological affiliation within the identified contexts. All
artifacts recovered during this survey were historic period materials. These artifacts were
examined for particular attributes and diagnostic traits using morphological and/or functional
classification systems developed by South (1977). Analysis of the recovered materials assigned
artifacts to one of four functional primary categories—Activities, Architectural, Domestic
(including Furnishings), and Personal. The Activities category includes nonhousehold items,
17

transportation items, farm-related equipment, tools, and firearms. The Architectural category
includes all items related to buildings such as brick, mortar, plaster, nails, window glass, and
electrical items. The Domestic category designation is used for items related to food service
(tableware) and food storage (including food preparation and tin cans); a Furnishings
classification, a subcategory of Domestic, encompasses household items such as furniture, stove
parts, and lamp glass. The Personal category generally contains items of individual use such as
clothing, buttons, shoes, dolls, and smoking pipes. Those artifacts such as unidentifiable pieces
of glass and metal that cannot be specifically placed in one of the above major functional
categories are classified as Indeterminate.

NRHP ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
The assessment of significance of a cultural resources property is based on federal guidelines and
regulations. The criteria (36 CFR Part 60.4 [a–d]) for evaluating properties for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places are codified under the authority of the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation has set
forth guidelines to use in determining site eligibility. Based on Advisory Council guidelines, any
resource that is included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register is a “historic
property.” Federal regulations state that “The term ‘eligible for inclusion in the National
Register’ includes both properties formally determined as such by the Secretary of the Interior
and all other properties that meet National Register listing criteria” (36 CFR §800.2 [e]).
Subsequent to the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions, the
following four criteria for eligibility are applied:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design,
setting, material, workmanship, feeling, and association and
(a) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of
our history; or
(b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant
and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
(d) that have yielded or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history [36 CFR
Part 60.4 (a–d)].

The principal research objective is to determine whether a cultural resources property possesses
the potential to meet to one or more of the above-defined criteria. Therefore, adequate
information on site function, context, and chronological placement from both archeological and,
if appropriate, historical perspectives is essential for cultural resources investigations. Because
research questions vary as a result of geography, temporal period, and project design,
determination of site context and chronological placement of cultural properties is a particularly
important objective during the inventory process. The objective of this current project was to
locate and define both horizontally and vertically any cultural resources, document and describe
those resources, and then, when adequate data were present, evaluate each for NRHP eligibility.

CHAPTER 5
RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

This chapter presents the results of the cultural resources survey and assesses the effects of the
proposed Gascoyne #1H project on cultural resources in the vicinity. Management considerations
and recommendations based on the findings of this survey are presented in the final chapter.

BACKGROUND AND ARCHIVAL RESEARCH RESULTS
Review of THC records indicated that four previous cultural resources investigations have been
conducted within a 1.6-km (1-mi) radius of the project area and two cultural resources are located
within the search radius. The Duncan and Latham cemeteries are each located 1 km (0.6 mi)
from the proposed project area and will not be adversely affected by the construction of the
Gascoyne #1H infrastructure. Archival research focused on the historic period settlement in the
immediate vicinity of the project area. The 1863 von Rosenberg map of the Sabine River valley
indicates that the Jones and Payne homestead existed to the northwest of the proposed project
area along Old Haley’s Ferry Road. By the early twentieth century, Old Haley’s Ferry Road had
become part of modern-day Farm-to-Market Road 139, as evidenced by the 1937 Sabine National
Forest 1:126,000-scale topographic map. A primary structure is depicted near the northwest
corner of the proposed project area on the 1944 United States Geological Survey (USGS) Patroon
15-minute (1:62,000-scale) topographic map. By the mid-twentieth century, this structure had
either been removed or collapsed and is not visible on 1952 Army Map Service aerial
photographs or depicted on the 1956 USGS Patroon 15-minute topographic map. A review of
modern aerial photography indicates that little development, aside from residential, agricultural,
and energy resources extraction development, occurred in the vicinity of the project area in the
mid-to-late-twentieth century.

CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY RESULTS
The proposed Gascoyne #1H project area was intensively investigated to determine the presence
of cultural resources using a combined technique of systematic visual reconnaissance and the
excavation of screened shovel tests. All areas not intensively investigated due to prior
disturbance were documented. Investigations adhered to BLM cultural resources survey
19

requirements pertaining to minimum buffer areas, resulting in the cultural resources survey of
approximately 17.2 acres (Figure 3). Thirty-four shovel tests were excavated as part of this
cultural resources survey. These 30-cm-diameter (11.8-in) screened shovel tests were excavated
in 20-cm (7.9-in) levels across the proposed project area, with the final location of each
excavation situated to avoid low-lying, inundated, or disturbed areas and in favor of
microtopographic rises and undisturbed contexts, when possible.
The Gascoyne #1H project area is located on terrace above North Bayou Blue. The topography is
generally level across the project area (Figure 4). Vegetation consists primarily of pasture grasses
with mixed hardwoods along an ephemeral drainage channel extending southward from the
southeast corner of the project area (Figure 5). Soils encountered in the majority of shovel test
excavations typically consisted of very pale brown (10YR 7/4) fine sandy loam that gradually
transitioned to yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) fine sandy loam to depths of approximately 60 cm
(24 in). These fine sandy loams overlie a brown (10YR 5/3) sandy clay loam subsoil.
Artifacts were encountered on the ground surface and in four shovel tests in the northwestern
portion of the survey area (see Figure 3). These artifacts are indicative of an early-to-mid­
twentieth-century rural domestic occupation. Based on these findings, site 41SY362 was
recorded.

SITE 41SY362
Site 41SY362 consists of an early-to-mid-twentieth century domestic site. Although the site is
largely outside of the area proposed for the Gascoyne #1H infrastructure, it is within the
prescribed BLM survey buffer. Site 41SY362 occupies approximately 0.55 acres across a slight
rise to the northwest of the proposed well pad location (Figure 6). The site measures roughly
65 m (213 ft) north-to-south by 50 m (164 ft) east-to-west at an elevation of approximately 84 m
(276 ft) amsl. The site is covered by pasture grasses with little surface visibility (Figure 7).
Domestic and architectural artifacts observed on the ground surface and recovered in four shovel
tests. Surface artifacts observed at the site (n=20) consist primarily of machine-made bricks and
brick fragments bearing the mark “ATHENS BRICK & TILE COMPANY / ATHENS. TEXAS.
U.S.A.” The Athens Brick and Tile Company was incorporated in 1917 and sold to HarbisonWalker Refractories Company in 1940 (Anonymous 1941; Steinbomer 1982).
Two
concentrations of these mortared bricks were designated as Features 1 and 2. Feature 1 consists
of four courses of mortared bricks that appear to be a portion of a fire box or hearth due to their
offset and stepped arrangement (Figure 8). Feature 2 consists of several courses of mortared
bricks that appear to be remains of a chimney (see Figure 8). Feature 2 is adjacent to a metal rod,
which may have grounded a lightning rod. In addition to these bricks and brick fragments, two
fragments of colorless bottle glass and one steel sanitary food (post-1904) can were observed on
the surface of the site.
Shovel tests were excavated along the north-south axis of the rise (see Figure 6). Four of these
shovel tests (Shovel Tests [STs] 7, 8, 16, and 19) yielded subsurface artifacts (n=56). Of the
subsurface artifact assemblage recovered at the site, nine artifacts are Architectural in nature, and
39 Domestic artifacts and four Personal items are represented (Table 4; Appendix A). The
remaining four artifacts could not be positively identified and were classified as Indeterminate.
Architectural materials consist of eight wire nails (post-1890) and one piece of window glass.
Domestic artifacts consist solely of glass items. The undistinguished body sherds include 20

colorless glass fragments (post-1880); five ash-tint fragments (post-1915); and one opaque milk
glass fragment that likely represents a jar or table glass. The remaining artifacts contain more
diagnostic elements. A fruit jar lip with lightning/bail closure (post-1880) was found in four
fragments that refit. Another small fragment of a fruit jar exhibited an interrupted thread screw
finish (post-1911). Finally, 10 pieces of colorless table glass (post-1880) were recovered. The
largest element is composed of three smaller fragments that refit, forming a large portion of a
bowl with a deeply embossed checkerboard pattern on the exterior and a sunburst pattern on the
base. The remaining nine fragments appear consistent in design with the larger fragment, but did
not refit with it. The single Furnishings-related artifact is a piece of colorless lamp glass (post­
1880). The four Personal items recovered from the site all derived from footwear: two pieces of
leather shoe upper, one piece of a rubber sole, and a small shoe nail. The Indeterminate artifacts
include one colorless angular glass fragment (post-1880) and three pieces of iron or steel wire.
All artifacts encountered at site 41SY362 were located either on the ground surface or within
depths of 20 cm (6 in). Surface artifacts were limited to the southern portion of the site (see
Figure 6). Although nearly 60 percent (n=32) of the artifacts recovered from the subsurface of
the site were located in ST 16, many of these were highly fragmented glass pieces that could have
originated from relatively fewer artifacts. Likewise, the glass artifacts recovered in ST 19 (n=10)
are all likely to have come from the same decorative glass bowl.
Site 41SY362 represents an artifact scatter or midden associated with an early-to-mid-twentieth­
century rural residence. A primary structure is depicted at this location on the 1944 USGS
Patroon 15-minute topographic map (Figure 9). By the mid-twentieth century, this structure had
either been removed or collapsed and is not visible on 1952 Army Map Service aerial
photographs or depicted on the 1956 USGS Patroon 15-minute topographic map. Given the site’s
minimal, fragmentary, and redundant artifact content, and the lack of additional features or intact
architectural remains, site 41SY362 is considered to have little research potential. As such, this
portion of the site is not likely to preserve information important to understanding community and
regional development in Shelby County during the early-to-mid-twentieth century. Thus, it is
recommended that 41SY362, as it is currently defined, is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP
under the criteria enumerated in 36 CFR 60.4. The site has been documented and recorded with
TARL. No further investigations are recommended.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This cultural resources survey was conducted to document and assess cultural resources within a
17.2-acre area for the proposed Gascoyne #1H infrastructure and to provide adequate and relevant
information for use in the management of cultural resources within the project area. Four
previously recorded cultural resources are located in the vicinity (i.e., within 1.6 km [1 mi]) of the
proposed project area. The Duncan and Latham cemeteries are located at least 1 km (0.6 mi)
outside of the proposed project area and will not be adversely affected by the construction of the
Gascoyne #1H infrastructure. This cultural resources survey resulted in the excavation of 34
shovel tests and the documentation of 41SY362, an early-to-mid-twentieth-century rural domestic
site, within the prescribed BLM cultural resources survey buffer area.
Site 41SY362 has been adversely affected by demolition and agriculture. The artifact assemblage
associated with this site is sparse and consists of highly fragmentary items typical of twentiethcentury domestic refuse. Given the minimal information potential associated with this site, it is
unlikely that it will provide any additional information relevant to understanding community and
regional development in Shelby County during the twentieth century. Thus, site 41SY362 is
recommended to be not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, under criteria enumerated in 36 CFR
60.4. The location of this site has been recorded with TARL. No further investigations are
recommended within the proposed project area at this site. It is recommended that construction
of the Gascoyne #1H well pad and associated lease road be allowed to proceed. No historic
properties (i.e., cultural resources eligible for inclusion in or listed on the NRHP) will be affected
by the construction of this well pad or its associated lease road. Provided the project is carried
out as proposed, no further cultural resources investigations are recommended within the
surveyed project area.
