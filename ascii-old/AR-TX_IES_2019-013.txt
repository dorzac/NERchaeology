ABSTRACT
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of
archeological monitoring conducted by Integrated Environmental Solutions, LLC (IES)
during the Gilbert House Foundation Stabilization Project. IES was contracted by the City
of Farmers Branch to perform archeological monitoring during foundation stabilization and
installation of a drainage pipeline at the Dr. Samuel H. and Julia Ann Gilbert House. The
Gilbert House is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and is located
within the City of Farmers Branch Historical Park. As the project transpired on property
owned by the City of Farmers Branch, which is a political subdivision of the State of Texas,
the project required compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT).
The purpose of archeological monitoring was to identify and record artifacts, features, and
subsurface architectural elements exposed during the foundation stabilization effort.
Archeologists Anne Gibson, Christopher Goodmaster, and Kevin Stone conducted
archeological monitoring during construction activities that occurred between 16 April to
21 May 2018. During the project, the historic-period archeological component of the
Gilbert House was recorded as archeological site 41DL541. The house was also reevaluated under NRHP Criterion D and the necessity for construction monitoring efforts
during future projects was assessed.
During this project, over 1,800 artifacts were identified and recorded through soil samples
taken from construction excavations along the exterior and interior walls of the house.
Although the house was constructed in the 1850s, the majority of diagnostic artifacts
encountered during the project dated from the 1890s through the first half of the 20th
century. Only unique artifacts were collected for further analysis and curation. All records
and collected artifacts will be temporarily stored at the IES McKinney office and
permanently curated at The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) Center for
Archeological Research (CAR).
Based on this investigation, IES recommends that the Gilbert House Foundation
Stabilization Project resulted in no adverse effects to the NRHP-listed historic property. In
addition, if future improvements or stabilization efforts are required in undisturbed areas
within or near the Gilbert House, it is recommended that additional archeological
investigations or monitoring would be required to maintain compliance with the ACT. In
addition, IES recommends that the Gilbert House remains eligible for the NRHP under
Criterion D.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

This report presents the results of archeological monitoring conducted by Integrated Environmental
Solutions, LLC (IES), under contract to the City of Farmers Branch. The purpose of this investigation was
to identify and document artifacts, features, and any additional cultural resources associated with the Dr.
Samuel H. and Julia Ann Gilbert House (Gilbert House) that were exposed during the Gilbert House
Foundation Stabilization Project. This investigation was conducted in accordance with Code of Federal
Regulations, Title 36, Section 800 (36 CFR 800) and the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT; Texas Natural
Resources Code, Title 9, Chapter 191 [9 TNRC 191]) and associated state regulations (Texas
Administrative Code, Title 13, Chapter 26 [13 TAC 26]), which outline the regulations for implementing
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and the ACT, respectively. This report
documents the archeological monitoring conducted in support of the foundation stabilization project.
Prepared in accordance with the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA 2002) guidelines, this report satisfies
the NHPA Section 106 and the ACT requirements of the proposed project. A description of the proposed
project area, pertinent regulations, environmental and historical contexts, field and analytical methods,
results of the investigations, and recommendations regarding the identified cultural resources are provided
in this document.

1.1 Project Description
The Gilbert House was constructed in the mid-1850s by Dr. Samuel H. and Julia Ann Gilbert. The house
is widely recognized as being one of the oldest standing structures in the region and one of the few 19thcentury structures that remains at its original location. The Gilbert House is a Recorded Texas Historic
Landmark (RTHL) and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in November 1988.
The Gilbert House is presently within the Farmers Branch Historical Park, located southwest of the
intersection of Farmers Branch Lane and Ford Road in the City of Farmers Branch, Dallas County, Texas
(Figures 1.1 and 1.2).
As the City of Farmers Branch is a political subdivision of the State of Texas, it is required to comply with
the ACT. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the distribution and types of artifacts and
features associated with the Gilbert House, assess the validity of the NRHP Criterion D eligibility of the
site, and determine if additional monitoring will be necessary for future work. In addition, the project
allowed for the observation and documentation of subsurface construction methods and buried architectural
features.
1.2 Regulatory Framework
The City of Farmers Branch is a political subdivision of the State of Texas and the project will therefore be
subjected to the provisions of the ACT. The ACT was passed in 1969 and requires that Texas Historical
Commission (THC) staff review actions that have the potential to disturb historic and archeological sites
on public property. Actions that require review under the ACT include any project that include grounddisturbing activities greater than 5 acres (ac) or involving 5,000-cubic feet (ft) of ground disturbance on
land owned or controlled by a political subdivision of the State and include easements on private property.
However, if the activity occurs within a designated historic district, affects a previously recorded
archeological site, or requires onsite investigations, project review by the THC is required regardless of
project size. This investigation was conducted in accordance with 13 TAC 26, which outlines the
regulations for implementing the ACT, under Antiquities Permit No. 8386.

1.3 Area of Potential Effects
The proposed project Area of Potential Effects (APE) encompasses a 0.19-ac area under and surrounding
the Gilbert House located within Farmers Branch Historic Park. The engineering designs for the project
entailed stabilization of the Gilbert House foundation using a grade beam construction method under the
original exterior walls of the house (Appendix A). To install the grade beam, portions of the enclosed
dogtrot floor, front porch, exterior stone steps, flagstone walkway, and exterior Americans with Disabilities
Act (ADA) access ramp were removed. All removed framing, walkway stones, and steps were labeled and
reinstalled to match the pre-stabilization conditions. The grade beam was installed along approximately
208 linear ft of exterior walls. Soil was hand-excavated along the house perimeter walls by the construction
contractor to a depth of approximately 30 inches (in; 80 centimeters [cm]) to ensure that the grade beam
was free of loose or wet substrate materials. The project also included drainage improvements to the
northern and western portions of the structure through the installation of a 75-ft-long polyvinyl chloride
(PVC) drainage pipe along the west side of the original structure. A new ADA ramp was constructed on
the north side of the structure.

CHAPTER 2: ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

2.1 Environmental Setting
2.1.1 - Climate
Dallas County is located in the north central portion of the State of Texas. This region has a humid
subtropical climate and an average annual precipitation ranging from approximately 35 to 40 in (89 to 102
cm). About half of the precipitation usually falls as rain between April and May, with July and August
being the two driest months of the year. The subtropical region tends to have a relatively mild year-round
temperature with the occasional exceedingly hot and cold snaps (Estaville and Earl 2008).
2.1.2 - Topographic Setting
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Carrollton 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle map illustrates that the
project area is located on an upland terrace separating Farmers Branch and Rawhide Creek (see Figure
1.2). Rawhide Creek flows generally southwest and joins Farmers Branch approximately 1.27 miles (mi)
to the southwest. The Gilbert House is situated on the southwestern shoulder of the generally-level terrace
with an elevation range of 471 to 474 ft above modern sea level (amsl).
2.1.3 - Vegetation, Geology, and Soils
The APE is located within the Northern Blackland Prairie subregion of the Texas Blackland Prairie
ecoregion (Griffith et al. 2007). The Northern Blackland Prairie is characterized by a gently undulating
landscape mantled by dark, calcic, clay-rich soils and prairie vegetation (Griffith et al. 2007). Historical
vegetation included little bluestem, big bluestem, yellow Indiangrass, and tall dropseed. Most of the
Blackland Prairie has been converted to cropland, non-native pasture, and expanding urban uses around
Dallas, Waco, Austin, and San Antonio. Much of the surrounding region is underlain by the Cretaceousage Eagle Ford (Kef) and related geological formations (Figure 2.1), which are typically comprised of
chalky and sandy limestones, shales, and marls that weather into the vertic soils of the region (McGowen
et al. 1987; USGS 2018).
Vertisols dominate the Blackland Prairie and consist of high clay content soils with significant shrink and
swell potential. According to the Soil Survey of Dallas County, Texas, the Gilbert House is situated within
one identified soil map unit (Coffee et al. 1980; Figure 2.2). Soils data was reviewed from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Web Soil Survey
(Web Soil Survey 2018). The Houston Black-Urban land complex, 0 to 4 percent slopes, is characterized
by clay weathered from calcareous shale and is located on ridges. This soil type is typically characterized
as moderately well drained and has a depth to a root restrictive layer or bedrock of more than 80 in. Upland
areas immediately adjacent to the Gilbert House contain soils of the related Wilson and Lewisville soil
series, with frequently flooded soils of the Frio series along the Farmers Branch stream channel and the
relatively more sandy soils of the Silawa series restricted to localized alluvial terrace landforms along
Farmers Branch.

CHAPTER 3: BACKGROUND RESEARCH

3.1 Previous Investigations
A file search within the Texas Archeological Site Atlas (TASA) and Texas Historic Sites Atlas (THSA)
database, maintained by the THC, identified that the area surrounding the Gilbert House has not been
formally surveyed for archeological resources. However, TASA records do identify three archeological
surveys that had been conducted within 1 mi of the project area (TASA 2018; Table 3.1; Figure 3.1). In
addition, vocational survey and site-recording activities by early members of the Dallas Archeological
Society have also occurred in the local area. As a result of these previous survey efforts, three prehistoric
archeological sites have been identified in the vicinity of the Gilbert House (TASA 2018; Table 3.2).

While the APE has not been previously surveyed for archeological sites, an informal pedestrian
reconnaissance assessment of the site was performed in 1987 by historical archeologist Randall Moir of
Southern Methodist University in preparation for the nomination of the Gilbert House to the NRHP.
According to the NRHP nomination form, Moir observed an artifact assemblage consistent with mid-tolate 19th century rural homestead sites of the region. Moir identified artifacts exposed on the ground surface
within areas surrounding the Gilbert House. These artifacts included pottery fragments (including
stoneware, ironstone, and whiteware), hand-finished bottle glass, pressed table glass, cut nails, wire nails,
window glass, animal bone, architectural remains, and various personal items. Moir observed several
artifacts dating to the early occupation of the property by Dr. Gilbert, including an applied bottle neck,
molded ironstone, locally-produced stoneware, and British brown stoneware. Moir concluded that there
was strong evidence that many of the subsurface artifact deposits associated with the Gilbert House were
likely still intact.

3.2 Historical Background
3.2.1 - Regional History
The first presence of Europeans in north central Texas may have occurred in 1542 when the remnants of
the de Soto expedition, led by Luis de Moscoso de Alvarado, entered the area in an effort to find a land
route to New Spain. Some researchers believe that the expedition crossed north central Texas (Lebo and
Brown 1990:61), although others place the route much farther to the east and south (Bruseth and Kenmotsu
1991; Chipman 1992; Hudson 1986; Schambach 1989; Weber 1992). The manner in which many Native
American populations responded to contact with Spanish explorers and their cultural trajectory following
this contact is not precisely known, and the exact locations of their sites and detailed ethnohistoric data are
almost nonexistent. Although European trade items (Sollberger 1953) appear on a limited number of
archeological sites, no Protohistoric site has been thoroughly investigated and characterizations of the
Native American adaptations during this time period are conjectural at best.
By the 18th century, immigrant Plains Indian groups had moved into and beyond north central Texas, and
their documentation by traders and explorers marks the beginning of the Historic period in the region
(Prikryl 1993). Unfortunately, because reliable historical documentation is very sparse for the upper Trinity
River basin during the early Historic period, it is uncertain which specific aboriginal groups were residing
in the present-day region. Clearly, the early Historic period in north central Texas was a time of indigenous
population fluctuation, movement, and amalgamation (see Newcomb 1993). Documentary sources suggest
that the Tonkawa, Apache, Comanche, Wichita, Kitsai, Yojaune, Caddo, Delaware, and Kickapoo traversed
the region at various times during the period (Campbell 1983; Newcomb 1961; Newcomb and Campbell
1982). At the beginning of the 19th century, the physical presence of Europeans on the Southern Plains
became commonplace. This was the result of increasingly peaceful relations between the Spanish in Texas
and the Plains Indians to the north and the acquisition of the Louisiana Territory by the United States in
1803. By 1840, American explorers began to settle the north central Texas region. Settlers found rich soil,
ample water, useful trees, and an abundance of wild game (Maxwell 2016).
Reoccurring conflicts with Native American tribes caused many of these settlers to seek protection at Bird’s
Fort, located near present-day Arlington (Maxwell 2016). To recruit settlers to the area, the Republic of
Texas granted land to the Texas Emigration and Land Company, known as Peters Colony in 1841. After
continuing attacks on outlying settlements by Native Americans, Sam Houston signed a treaty with tribal
chiefs at Bird’s Fort in 1843 (Maxwell 2016). Over time, the Texas Emigration and Land Company
acquired three additional land contracts, encompassing most of north central Texas. By the mid-1840s,
several new communities were formed in the region.
Farmers Branch was the location of the first office for Peters Colony (Maxwell 2010). Throughout the
1840s, grants for land within and near the small settlement, known then as Mustang Branch, were widely
advertised in other parts of the country and Europe (Maxwell 2010). In 1842, settlers Thomas Keenan,
William Cochran, and Isaac B. Webb received land grants and established the community of Farmers
Branch the next year (Jackson 1908; Maxwell 2010). The first blacksmith shop, gristmill, and cotton gin
within the county were constructed in Farmers Branch (Jackson 1908; Maxwell 2010).
Texas was annexed by the United States in 1846, and the First Legislature of Texas established Dallas
County that year. The county was probably named for George Mifflin Dallas, Vice President of the United
States under James K. Polk. In the 1850s and 1860s, the county’s economy was dominated by crops of
corn, cotton, and wheat and livestock of hogs, cattle, and sheep (Maxwell 2016). Though the fertile
Blackland Prairie soils attracted settlers, prior to the 1870s poor transportation, limited markets, and lack
of mechanized farm equipment prevented the large-scale plantation agriculture characteristic of many parts
of the South, and most settlers at this time were subsistence farmers living near reliable water and timber
supplies along major streams. Despite the exodus of soldiers during the American Civil War, the population
of Dallas County increased as it attracted refugees and slave owners from other southern states (Maxwell
Gilbert House Foundation Stabilization Project
Cultural Resources Report

IES Project No. 03.013.003
Page | 15

2016). In the 1870s and 1880s, construction of railroad lines connected Dallas and many of the towns
within Dallas County, including Farmers Branch, to the rest of the state and nation (Maxwell 2010). In
Farmers Branch, the community had grown by 1890 to include 100 residents, a school, several stores, and
two blacksmith shops (Maxwell 2010).
During the 20th century, Dallas County gradually became less rural and agricultural as manufacturing
became more prevalent. Manufacturing became increasingly significant during and immediately after
World War II (WWII), providing employment for young people coming from rural areas and creating
economic growth (Maxwell 2016). By 1950, approximately 90 percent of Dallas County was classified as
being urban. During the following four decades, the population of the county tripled from 600,000 to
1,800,000. Major industries included manufacturing, retail trade, wholesale trade, and the service industry.
The City of Farmers Branch experienced similar growth rates. During the 20th century, the city became the
location for several manufacturers including producers of steel, ceramic tile, pharmaceutical drugs,
cosmetics, and food products. As a result of local manufacturing and the spread of urbanization from the
City of Dallas, the city’s population increased from 300 residents in the late 1910s to 28,616 citizens in
2010 (Maxwell 2010; U.S. Census Bureau 2010).
3.2.2 - History of the Gilbert House
Dr. Samuel H. Gilbert, a young professional physician, moved from his home state of Tennessee to Cass
County, Texas around 1850 and soon relocated to Dallas County. The 1852 Dallas County tax roll lists a
S. H. Gilbert, whose only taxable property was a horse and books. After marrying Julia Ann Ritchey in
1853, Dr. Gilbert bought 307 ac of the 320-ac John L. Pulliam survey in 1855 (Land Bond 24 April 1857
between Samuel Gilbert and E. Fyke; Dallas County Deed Record Volume K, Page 406). In 1855 or 1856,
Dr. Gilbert constructed a Greek Revival style dogtrot house on his property near the community of Farmers
Branch. After moving into the house, Samuel and Julia Ann expanded their family with the birth of their
two daughters, Mary (b. 1857) and Isabelle “Belle” (b. 1862).
Originally, the house featured four rooms, known as pens, bisected by an open hallway or breezeway called
a dogtrot. The two largest rooms were located on the eastern side of the house and the smaller, shed rooms
on the west side. The northeast room functioned as the bedroom and sitting room for Samuel and Julia Ann
Gilbert and the adjoining northwest room served as the bedroom for their two daughters. The southeast
room was the parlor and the southwest room functioned as an area for storage and food preparation. Later
accounts by those who resided in the house stated there was a lean-to kitchen outside of the southwest room.
The dogtrot served primarily to cool the house on warm days by allowing breezes to flow through the center
of the building. The dogtrot of the Gilbert House also served as a dining room, a guest bedroom, and
lodging for boarders. In an interview conducted by park director Ron Harmon in the late 1980s, Dr.
Gilbert’s granddaughters recall his buggy parked in the dogtrot to keep thieves from stealing it (Lister
1988).
Dr. Gilbert kept a collection of diaries, two of which have survived to the present. Diary entries often
included observations about the weather, patients he saw and their ailments, community happenings,
farming activities, and information on goods he sold or bought. The diary of Dr. Gilbert mentions he grew
crops such as wheat, corn, cotton, oats, turnips, green peas, onions, melons, and Irish potatoes. Because he
was often on-call to treat patients in the community, it appears he hired laborers and rented parts of his
property to sharecroppers. These workers often would aid in the planting and harvesting of grains and
cotton. During the summer, multiple diary entries mention him cutting and drying peaches with his family,
which they would occasionally sell or trade. Dr. Gilbert and his wife would pick dewberries and post oak
grapes together and often “robbed” bee gum (a bee hive found in a hollow section of a black gum tree).
Dr. Gilbert also raised livestock on his property. According to the 1859 Dallas County tax roll, he owned
two horses, 19 head of cattle, a wagon, and hogs. When sheep were included as a taxable livestock category
in 1860, Dr. Gilbert is reflected as owning 200 sheep. By the middle of the Civil War period (1861 to
Gilbert House Foundation Stabilization Project
Cultural Resources Report

IES Project No. 03.013.003
Page | 16

1865), he owned as many as 555 sheep on his 275-ac property. After the war, he gradually reduced his
flock in favor of raising horses, mules, dairy cows, beef cattle, and hogs. A diary entry dating to 23 August
1872 mentions he owed a man 20 dollars, which he paid with dairy cows and beef steer. Although he
owned cattle, he often bought at least 10 pounds of beef every few days. By the end of his lifetime, Dr.
Gilbert had sold all of his livestock.
Historical records of Dr. Gilbert indicate he was a respected physician in the small rural community. The
doctor was mostly on-call during the day but would occasionally see patients at night and on major holidays.
He often visited patients at their homes. If he could not make the trip, he would send someone with a
prescribed medicine. Sick or injured patients came to the Gilbert House for treatment and occasionally
were allowed lodging. As one of the few men with medical knowledge at the time, Dr. Gilbert also
delivered babies and performed dentistry, which usually consisted of removing problematic teeth. On slow
days or when he was not feeling well, he would remain at home to read or attend to his crops.
When low on supplies, Dr. Gilbert would often travel to Dallas or send one of his tenants to buy various
medicines or ingredients for producing his own medicine. These trips would also include the purchase of
household items like coffee, tobacco, sugar, salt, spices, matches, paper, and books for Dr. Gilbert’s
collection. On a few occasions, he would buy items for his wife or daughters such as shoes, fabric, ribbons,
thread, hats, and hair accessories.
Julia Ann Gilbert died in the winter of 1881. Dr. Gilbert continued to reside in his home until his death in
the spring of 1890 at the age of 61. The house was acquired by his youngest daughter Belle and her husband
William Hughes from Mary Gilbert Langley, the eldest daughter (Dallas County Deed Record Volume 167,
Page 52). Because the Hughes family resided in the Oak Lawn area of Dallas, the house was rented to local
families. Interviews with Gilbert family decedents and former tenants recall the dogtrot was used for parties
and dances, but the large exterior doors for the dogtrot had rotted off by the 1920s. A kitchen was
constructed on the southwest side of the house and a smokehouse was located a few feet west of it. There
was also a root cellar, but the exact location of it is unknown. Later tenants indicate the kitchen was moved
to the northeast room of the house. In the 1920s, the house was used as a bunk house for Boy Scouts.
After Belle Gilbert Hughes passed away in 1921, the house was eventually sold to Roy McKee. Roy McKee
and his wife remodeled the house and expanded it with a rear wing addition in 1939. Ownership changed
again when the 8.83-ac property was conveyed by the McKees to Wallace M. Skinner and his wife Lillian
Earle in 1952 (Dallas County Deed Record Volume 3631, Page 306). Six years later, the property was
conveyed to Hugh E. Wilson, his wife, and Arlo B. Wilson (Dallas County Deed Record Volume 4879,
Page 236). In 1981, the Wilsons sold the property to the City of Farmers Branch and the house was
repurposed as a museum. The Gilbert House is currently part of the Farmers Branch Historical Park. After
the house was purchased by the City, the Gilbert House was extensively restored to its original condition
and the rear wing was renovated to become park administration offices.

3.3 Cultural Resources Potential
In addition to the TASA and THSA database reviews, several additional sources were referenced to
determine the overall potential for encountering cultural resources within the APE. These sources included
USGS topographic maps, the Soil Survey of Dallas County, Texas, the USDA NRCS digital soil database
for Dallas County, the Geologic Atlas of Texas (Dallas Sheet), the National Archives and Records
Administration’s (NARA) 1940 Census Enumeration District Maps for Dallas County, the Texas Historic
Overlay (THO) georeferenced maps, the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Potential
Archeological Liability Map (PALM) for Dallas County, the NRHP nomination form for the Gilbert House,
archival documents associated with the Gilbert House, and both past and current aerial photography of the
project area.

3.3.1 - Prehistoric Resource Potential
The TXDOT PALM for the Dallas District indicates the area surrounding the Gilbert House contains a low
potential for shallow buried and moderate potential for deeply buried prehistoric cultural materials.
However, as the APE has been the location of a domestic dwelling since the mid-19th century, the APE
likely does not contain a reasonable context for the preservation of prehistoric archeological deposits. As
such, the APE contains a negligible potential for encountering intact prehistoric archeological sites.
3.3.2 - Historic-Period Resource Potential
The APE contains the Gilbert House, which was built by Dr. Samuel H. Gilbert between 1855 and 1856
(Appendix B, Photographs 01 through 07). The Gilbert House was once part of a 307-ac farm on which
Dr. Gilbert grew various crops and raised cattle and sheep. The farm contained multiple log barns, stables,
a root cellar, a summer house or cabin, a windmill, a pig pen, and a corn crib (Appendix C, Figure 1). A
photograph taken of the front of the Gilbert House in the 1939 shows part of the original fence adjacent to
the northwest corner of the house (Appendix C, Figure 2). The Greek Revival style house originally
featured a symmetrical floor plan of four rooms with two rooms on either side of an open hall or dogtrot.
The walls were constructed of limestone rubble that supported a shingle hipped roof. The house also had
two fireplaces on opposing sides of the house and a full-width colonnaded front porch. In 1939, new owners
of the Gilbert House remodeled the original house and constructed a two-story rear wing addition that
extended from the southwest room of the original house. The addition featured four bedrooms with
bathrooms and a garage. It appears most of the buildings and structures associated with the original farm
were demolished during or shortly after the 1939 renovation. No above-ground evidence of these structures
remains on the property. After the house was purchased by the City of Farmers Branch in 1981, the Gilbert
House was extensively restored, and the rear wing was renovated to become administration offices.
Floor plans of the house created for the NRHP nomination form show the extent of changes to the house
and surrounding grounds (Appendix D). The illustrations of the conjectured layout of the original house
and after the 1939 remodel show that the dogtrot was enclosed and the northern wall of the southeast room
was demolished to create a large living room and formal entryway. An exterior kitchen was originally
located at the southwest corner of the house; however, this kitchen feature was removed during construction
of the 1939 rear wing addition, which likely disturbed or destroyed any associated artifact deposits. The
main entrance to the house was moved from the east side of the house to the west side of the house. The
western window opening of the northwest room was enlarged for a new exterior doorway after the
southwest doorway was converted into an interior opening into the rear wing addition. On the exterior of
the house, the original wood plank porch was replaced with a concrete slab, which was extended along the
south side of the house. A photograph included in the NRHP nomination documentation confirms the
presence of the eastern and southern concrete porch area. Another concrete slab porch was added along the
north side of the rear wing addition and west side of the original house.
When the house was restored in the 1980s, the windows enclosing the dogtrot were replaced with double
doors at each entrance. The northern wall of the southeast room was rebuilt and the western window of the
northwest room was restored. The concrete slab front porch along the eastern wall was replaced with wood
planks to restore the original façade. The southern concrete porch extension was also removed and the area
was covered with sod. An ADA ramp leading to the front porch was added along the south wall. Exterior
modifications associated with the rear wing addition included removal of the bedroom adjacent to the
original southwest room to form a breezeway between the two buildings. The breezeway included a
flagstone walkway that extended to the western dogtrot entrance. The concrete porch west of the house
was demolished and replaced with sod except for a slab adjacent to the rear wing. These documented
modifications to the east, west, and south walls of the house and dogtrot area may have impacted surficial
and subsurface artifact deposits, but it is unknown to what degree. However, artifacts dating to the 19th
century and early 20th century were still visible on the surface when archeologist Randall Moir visited in

1987. At present, the house is within the Farmers Branch Historical Park and functions as a historic house
museum and administrative facility.
A site map provided with the nomination shows the location of several features associated with the house
outside of the APE. Notable identified features include a midden west of the rear wing addition that
contained ceramics and glass dating from the 1880s to the 1920s, an activity area and artifact scatter dating
to the 1860s and 1930s near a children’s playhouse southwest of house, and the location of a bottle neck
fragment dating to 1860 collected northwest of the house. The author indicated multiple wells or cisterns
were observed adjacent to the western boundary of the property.
Artifacts were observed and collected from under the Gilbert House when it was restorated in the 1980s.
The most notable of these artifacts include a metal eyeglasses case, two thimbles, a skeleton key, a 1903
“V” nickel, a metal dress button, a “Texas” Confederate brass button made by the Waterbury Button
Company, and a lapel pin featuring a clock and the slogan “Dallas: The City of the Hour.”
During an inspection of the house in 2016, park and museum staff removed part of the flooring in the
dogtrot between the doorways of the eastern rooms. Staff members collected several artifacts from the
surface and stored them in boxes at the museum. These artifacts include peach pits, bones, a pig mandible
fragment, textiles, architectural debris, mirror glass, large fragments of a decorated pressed glass bowl or
basket, a small lock manufactured by the Fraim Lock Company (1879-1959), a porcelain doll’s arm, a
stamped brass button, the backing of a lapel pin, a wooden thread spool, a hair pin, a pocket knife with
decorative brass bolsters and shield and imitation antler covers, a clear glass bottle base produced by the
Illinois Glass Company (1915–1929), and an intact clear medicine bottle marked “Wyeth” for the John
Wyeth and Brother Chemists of Philadelphia, which dates to the late 19th or early 20th century. Modern
trash left from the house restoration was also observed.
Unlike many houses dating to the same period in the region, the Gilbert House remains at its original
location and is often considered to be the oldest stone building in Dallas County with integrity of location.
Compared to the few other surviving houses constructed during the same period within Dallas County, the
Gilbert House was a large home and unusual for its stone construction rather than use of logs or a wood
frame. According to the NRHP nomination documents, the house would have been indicative of prosperity
at the time. Also, the large hipped roof and inset porch was more typical of architectural styles found in
Louisiana than the Texas frontier of the same period.
In 1988, the house was listed on the NRHP under Criterion C for the significance of its architectural design
as an example of early Texas stone construction. The house was also listed under Criterion D, the potential
to yield information important in history, based on Moir’s documentation concerning the presence of
artifacts and potential for intact archeological deposits. According to the NRHP evaluation sheet, the
artifacts identified by Moir provide insight and contribute to a deeper understanding of early Texas
homesteads. A letter to the THC dated 20 September 1988 indicates that the recommendation of NRHPeligibility under Criterion D was made with the assumption that historic-aged archeological deposits
associated with the house were present but would be formally investigated in the future to determine if
Criterion D is valid for the Gilbert House (see Appendix D).
Despite potential historical and modern ground disturbances within and surrounding the Gilbert House,
artifacts associated with the early homestead period have been observed on the property. Therefore, based
on the history of the house, its integrity of location, and past archeological assessments, the APE possess a
high potential for encountering historic-period cultural resources.

CHAPTER 4: METHODOLOGY

4.1 Archeological Methods
4.1.1 - Archeological Monitoring
Through preliminary coordination with the THC, it was determined that archeological monitoring of the
foundation stabilization and drainage improvements would be sufficient to satisfy the City’s responsibilities
under the ACT. The goal of the monitoring was to gather information on the nature and types of artifacts
and features within the project area. Because the previous archeological evaluation presented in the NRHP
nomination document offered limited information on the composition, location, and spatial extent of
archeological deposits associated with the house, IES developed a methodology to more thoroughly assess
the research potential of the Gilbert House under Criterion D. Excavation within and surrounding the house
would also allow archeologists to analyze the utilization of space through the observed artifact assemblage
as well as the potential to identify and document architectural features and construction methods of the
unique stone structure.
A crew of one to two archeologists were present and visually monitored all occurrences of ground
disturbance during construction until project completion. The archeological monitors observed and
recorded the extent and depth of excavation, soil characteristics, and any encountered artifacts. The
foundation grade beam was installed in alternating 4-ft-long sections along the original exterior walls of
the structure. During the first stage of construction (Stage 1) sections of unexcavated soil served to support
the exterior walls of the structure while each section of the foundation grade beam was excavated.
Following soil excavation, the wooden concrete forms were installed, leveled, reinforced, poured, and
allowed several days to cure. During Stage 2 of construction, the soil pedestals were excavated, and the
alternating sections of grade beam were installed to form a continuous beam along the original exterior
walls of the structure. A sample of soil systematically excavated from each construction area was screened
through 0.25-in wire mesh to facilitate artifact recovery. The volume and interval of the soil samples varied
depending on the construction activity being monitored. For each 4-ft section of foundation grade beam
installed, approximately 56.8 to 75.7 liters (three to four 5-gallon buckets) of soil were screened. For each
10 ft of drainage pipe installed, approximately 56.8 liters (three 5-gallon buckets) of soil were screened.
As soil was excavated by construction crews during structure stabilization activities, the provenience of
encountered artifacts could not be assigned and cataloged using standard archeological units and methods.
Thus, proveniences were assigned and recorded based on observations of construction activities.
Provenience for encountered artifacts were catalogued by each 4-ft section of grade beam (to coincide with
construction excavations) and each 10-ft section of drainage pipe. A total of 57 excavation units were
defined during this study. Exterior wall units were labeled by cardinal direction of the adjacent wall and
number of units from the eastern or northern corners of the house. For example, Unit S3 was excavated
along the southern wall and was the third unit from the SE corner of the house. Interior units were identified
by an “I” followed by the cardinal direction of the adjacent wall and unit number from eastern house
entrance. For example, IN5 was along the interior north wall and fifth unit from eastern entrance. All
locational information was plotted on construction plans. Provenience of artifacts encountered during any
required surface disturbance or grading were documented near their encountered location, if possible.
During construction monitoring, encountered artifacts were documented, to the most specific level possible,
by functional class, material type, and provenience. Encountered artifacts were quantified and
representative samples were photographed. Unique artifacts that were identifiable personal items, related
to past diet, pertained to 19th century medical practices, or contained maker’s marks, were collected for
further documentation and analysis. All other artifacts were documented and returned to the context from
which they were recovered.

4.2 Site Evaluation
The Gilbert House was nominated to the NRHP under Criterion C for its significance as an early example
of stone architecture in Texas and under Criterion D based on the presence of artifacts that provide
important information and contribute to a historical understanding of mid-to-late 19th century Texas
homesteads. The house was deemed to be significant at the local level with a period of significance
spanning from 1855 to 1938. The Gilbert House was listed in the NRHP on 10 November 1988. To more
adequately document and record the archeological component of the Gilbert House and provide an
evaluation of its NRHP significance under Criterion D, the portion of the property investigated during this
project was formally recorded as archeological site. A State of Texas Archeological Site Form was
completed and submitted to the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The University of Texas at
Austin and was assigned the archeological site trinomial designation 41DL541.
NRHP Evaluation Criteria
The assessment of significance of a cultural resource is based on federal guidelines and regulations. The
criteria for evaluating resources for inclusion in the NRHP are codified under the authority of the NHPA of
1966, as amended (36 CFR 60.4 [a–d]), and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation has set forth
guidelines to use in determining site eligibility. Federal regulations indicate that “[t]he term ‘eligible for
inclusion in the National Register’ includes both properties formally determined as such by the Secretary
of the Interior and all other properties that meet National Register listing criteria” (36 CFR 800.2[e]). Based
on Advisory Council guidelines, any cultural resource that is included in or eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP is a historic property.
Subsequent to the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions, four criteria
for eligibility are applied. The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology,
engineering, and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity
of location, design, setting, material, workmanship, feeling, and association and:
Criterion A:
Criterion B:
Criterion C:

Criterion D:

that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad
patterns of our history; or
that are association with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic
values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components
may lack individual distinction; or
that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or
history [36 CFR 60.4(a–d)].

The principal objective is to determine whether a cultural resource possesses the potential to contribute to
one or more of the above-defined criteria. Adequate information regarding site function, context, and
chronological placement from both archeological and, if appropriate, historical perspectives is essential for
cultural resources investigations. Because research questions vary as a result of geography, temporal
period, and project design, determination of site context and chronological placement of cultural resources
is a particularly important objective during the inventory and evaluation processes. Criterion D is generally
associated with prehistoric, but also historic-age, archeological sites. Criteria A, B, and C typically reflect
association with historic-age resources, rarely with prehistoric sites. The objective of the current project
was to locate and define both the horizontal and vertical extents of any cultural resources, document and
describe those resources, and then, when adequate data were present, evaluate each for NRHP eligibility.
State Antiquities Landmark Evaluation Criteria
For purposes of implementing the ACT, the THC is the statutorily created body responsible for protecting
and preserving State Antiquities Landmark (SALs) under the 9 TNRC 191. A SAL is an archeological site,
Gilbert House Foundation Stabilization Project
Cultural Resources Report

IES Project No. 03.013.003
Page | 22

archeological collection, ruin, building, structure, cultural landscape, site, engineering feature, monument
or other object, or district that is eligible to be designated as a landmark or is already officially designated
as a landmark. Some archeological sites may not possess sufficient research value to warrant long-term
preservation or investigations beyond survey level documentation, and some historic buildings and
structures retain minimal integrity due to damage or deterioration. Therefore, the issue of whether cultural
resources are significant and warrant preservation, and/or further research (such as archeological testing
and data recovery level investigations), is addressed through official landmark designation, permit issuance,
and rules associated with enforcement of the ACT. TNRC Sections 191.091 and 191.092 indicate that
archeological sites and historic buildings and structures on lands belonging to state agencies or political
subdivisions of the state of Texas are landmarks or may be eligible to be designated as landmarks. Also
protected under the TNRC (Section 191.094) are specially designated landmarks on private property [above
information compiled from 13 TAC 26.2].
Under the ACT at the state level, archeological sites may be considered significant and be recognized or
designated as a SAL. The THC uses one or more of the following criteria when assessing the
appropriateness of official landmark designation, and/or the need for further investigations under the permit
process:
Criterion 1:
Criterion 2:
Criterion 3:
Criterion 4:
Criterion 5:

the site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory and/or history
of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
the site’s archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and intact,
thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
the site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or history;
the study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of preservation, thereby
contributing to new scientific knowledge;
there is a high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur, and
official landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or alternatively,
further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and relic collecting when
the site cannot be protected [13 TAC 26.10].

Buildings, structures, cultural landscapes, and non-archeological sites, objects, and districts may be
designated as landmarks provided that the following conditions are met:
Condition 1: the property fits within at least one of the following criteria:
(a) the property is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad
patterns of our history, including importance to a particular cultural or ethnic group;
(b) the property is associated with the lives of persons significant in our past;
(c) the property embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, represents the work of a master, possesses high artistic value, or represents a
significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinctions
(d) the property has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in Texas culture
or history;
Condition 2: the property retains integrity at the time of the nomination, as determined by the executive
director of the commission; and
Condition 3: for buildings and structures only, the property must be listed in the National Register of
Historic Places, either individually, or as a contributing property within a historic district as
determined by the Keeper of the National Register or the executive director of the commission
[13 TAC 26.19].

4.3 Curation
Per the ACT, any artifacts that could contain historical, cultural, or scientific value are worthy of collection
during a permitted project. Encountered artifacts of these types were collected for further analysis and
documentation. In addition, field notes, forms, photographs, and other project-related documentation were
included in the curation package. All field-generated documents and any collected artifacts were

temporarily stored at the IES office and permanently curated at CAR. These documents and artifacts were
organized and catalogued according to CAR curation standards.

5CHAPTER 5: RESULTS
The excavation of 57 units were monitored during construction activities for the foundation stabilization
and drainage improvements around the NRHP-listed Gilbert House. Over 1,800 artifacts associated with
the Gilbert House were encountered during these excavations. The historic period archeological component
of the site was documented as site 41DL541 within the 0.19-ac APE. All photographs are located in
Appendix B and a site location map is in Appendix E.

5.1 Archeological Monitoring and Observations
5.1.1 - Foundation Stabilization
Stage 1
During Stage 1 of the Gilbert House Foundation Stabilization project, 22 grade beam units were handexcavated along the foundations of the house (Figure 5.1). Grade beam unit measurements averaged 4 ft
in length, 2 ft in width, and 2.5 to 3 ft in depth (Appendix B, Photographs 08 through 10). Units could
not extend more than 4 ft in length without compromising the structural integrity of the overlying stone
walls. Construction crews excavated soil to depths that extended below and under the foundation (see
Appendix A). Wooden forms and steel reinforcement bars were then placed within the excavated cavities
below the walls and filled with concrete to form sections of the grade beam (Appendix B, Photograph
11).
Soils exposed within units excavated along the exterior walls of the Gilbert House revealed a typical profile
that transitioned from medium to dark brown (10YR 3/2 to 10YR 3/3) sandy clay near the surface to reddish
orange (7.5YR 4/4) sandy clay beginning at 20 cm below surface (cmbs; Appendix B, Photographs 12
through 14). Interior unit soil profiles revealed light brown (10YR 5/2) sand at the surface overlaying
medium brown (10YR 3/2) sandy clay loam that extended to 20 cmbs. The soil transitioned to dark reddish
orange (7.5YR 3/3) sandy clay from 20 to 40 cm and to medium reddish orange (7.5YR 4/4) sandy clay
between 40 cm to the base of the units, which were excavated to depths ranging from 80 to 95
cmbs(Appendix B, Photograph 15). Deposits of sand, gravel, potting soil, and landscaping fabric were
encountered within the upper 5 cm of units along the northern and southern walls of the structure. Soils
near the northern wall of the house have been further disturbed by the installation of a perforated drainage
pipe and utility pipes (Appendix B, Photograph 16).
Archeologists collected approximately 56.8 liters of excavated soil from each unit located along the exterior
walls. Based on initial observations of vertical artifact distributions and frequencies, samples were
generally taken from the uppermost 20 cm of the soil profile. Samples along the southern half of the western
wall were taken at a lower depth due to disturbances associated with the installation of the flagstone
walkway (Appendix B, Photograph 17).
After the floorboards within the dogtrot area were removed, the ground surface below the floor was
inspected for artifacts (Appendix B, Photographs 18 through 23). To prevent loss of provenience or
potential destruction of artifacts during the excavation and foundation repair processes, the location of
observable artifacts on the surface were recorded and the items were removed for further analysis. During
Stage 1, six units were excavated within the dogtrot area. For each interior wall unit, approximately 75.7
liters of soil were removed from the upper 10 cm for screening samples. The increase in sample size was
a result of both a higher concentration and better preservation of artifacts within the dogtrot area. Artifacts
encountered by construction workers or others associated with the project were documented by location
and depth found and were collected if deemed to have potential analytical significance.

Excavation of the units revealed the subsurface portions of the limestone rubble walls. Above the modern
ground surface, the exterior walls consisted of irregularly-shaped, angular to subangular stones set in a thick
layer of light beige mortar (Appendix B, Photograph 24). Corners were constructed of larger, rectangular
hewn limestone blocks (Appendix B, Photograph 25). Approximately 1 ft above the ground surface along
the north, south, and west walls, the pattern of stone transitioned to courses of flat limestone pieces placed
tightly together in horizontal layers. This section of horizontal stones was also visibly covered in a residue
or had been slightly stained by previous house modifications or weathering (see Appendix C, Figure 2 for
1939 photograph that shows this staining on the north wall). Subsurface portions of the structure walls
exposed within excavation units showed this matrix of thin horizontal layers overlaying a basal course of
larger, irregularly-shaped stones (Appendix B, Photograph 26). As a result of the house being located on
the slightly sloping surface, the east wall was constructed on a slightly higher elevation than the rest of the
house; thus, it did not extend as deep into the subsurface.
The interior walls feature a similar construction of irregularly-shaped stones separated by a dense layer of
beige mortar. Below the flooring, it appears round stones were placed closer together and larger stones
form the base of the walls. Because of past remodeling projects, the eastern half of the interior southern
wall of the dogtrot area was reconstructed to have the same appearance as the north interior wall (Appendix
B, Photograph 27).
Stage 2
Thirty units were excavated during Stage 2 of the project. Because units from Stage 1 were not back-filled
until completion of the overall foundation stabilization project, the Stage 2 units were left as columns of
soil between the previously-excavated Stage 1 units (Appendix B, Photograph 26). The Stage 2 units
were typically shorter in length than those of Stage 1 but were uniform in width and depth with previous
units. Exceptions occurred adjacent to the eastern and western dogtrot entrances. To maintain structural
integrity and support for the dogtrot flooring, four consecutive units were excavated along each entrance
(two at the foundation corners and two under the door frame) to create a trench extending the entire width
of the eastern and western entrances. By the end of Stage 2, each exterior wall and the interior dogtrot
walls were lined with a trench (Appendix B, Photographs 27 through 34).
During excavation of Unit W3, excavators encountered a step composed of limestone rocks and concrete
under the northwestern window (Appendix B, Photograph 35). The step measured approximately 4 ft 9.5
in long by 2 ft 3.5 in wide and was located 1 ft below the ground surface. According the NRHP nomination
form, the northwest window was converted into an exterior doorway from the northwest room in the 1930s.
It appears the step was part of a staircase constructed for the doorway. The doorway and upper steps were
removed during the 1980s restoration of the Gilbert House, when the window and surrounding wall was
restored. Concrete beams from a previous attempt to stabilize the house foundations were observed on the
west side of the house near the dogtrot entrance (Appendix B, Photograph 36).
5.1.2 - Drainage Pipe Installation
The drainage pipe was installed after the completion of the foundation stabilization portion of the project
(Appendix B, Photograph 37 through 39). Much of the pipe extended along the flagstone walkway on
the west side of the Gilbert House before turning to the southwest to drain into a manicured lawn setting
south of the 1939 addition. Although the entire alignment was hand-excavated, archeological monitoring
focused on the southern half of the drain where there had been significantly less disturbances. Five units
were excavated in 10-ft intervals to collect samples. Approximately 56.8 liters of excavated soil were
screened from each sampling interval to maintain consistency with the previously excavated units along the
exterior foundation.

5.2 Excavation Monitoring Results
During this project, the historical archeological component of the site was documented as site 41DL541
(Figures 5.2). Excavations pertaining to the foundation stabilization and drainage improvements produced
over 1,800 artifacts associated with the Gilbert House. Approximately 43 percent of the artifacts observed
were nails including cut nails (n=244), which generally date to the late 19th century, and wire nails (n=538),
which were manufactured beginning in the 1890s and continue to be produced. Due to past renovations,
restoration efforts, and the removal of the dogtrot floorboards and front porch planking for this project,
nails identified as modern wire nails were removed before final artifact counts were tabulated for each unit.
Colorless glass, comprising both window and bottle glass, comprised the next largest group of artifacts with
approximately 374 shards (20.7 percent of total artifacts). Of the organic materials, faunal bones and bone
fragments (n=135) constituted approximately 7.5 percent of observed artifacts. Overall, the assemblage
contained fewer ceramics than anticipated (n=31) and were mostly concentrated within the dogtrot area.
5.2.1 - Exterior Walls
North Wall
The artifact assemblage of the north wall was mostly characterized by wire nails, cut nails, shards of clear
window glass, miscellaneous pieces of metal, undecorated whiteware sherds, and segments of string or
twine (Appendix B, Photograph 40). Black plastic landscape sheeting was encountered within Unit N3.
Excavations revealed a copper-clad twisted steel rod. The rod measured approximately 2 ft (63 cm) in
length and featured a green patina commonly found on objects made of copper (Appendix B, Photograph
41). This rod appears to have been part of a lightning or grounding rod system. During preparation for
pouring the foundation under the north wall, a worker uncovered a metal file and a dark-colored ceramic
marble or bottle stopper (Appendix B, Photograph 42). The marble/bottle stopper was the only artifact
collected for further analysis from the north wall area.
East Wall
The east elevation of the Gilbert House features the main entrance of the home with a porch extending the
entire length of the house. At the beginning of the project, the porch planking was removed, which revealed
modern trash, the recent skeletal remains of an opossum, and an active opossum nest. Most of the modern
human- and animal-related debris was removed from the porch area prior to excavation. A few bones
associated with the observed skeletonized opossum were scattered across the northern portion of the porch
area and additional elements were identified within Units E1 and E2. These bones were removed during
screening of the excavation samples.
Of the exterior wall areas, the east wall produced the largest number of artifacts. Archeologists identified
over 450 artifacts, most of which were concentrated near the main house entrance. The majority of the
artifact assemblage was comprised of wire nails (n=221), cut nails (n=56), clear window glass shards
(n=72), light bulb glass shards (n=22), and miscellaneous pieces of ferrous metal (n=50) including remnants
of metal cans. Other artifacts identified included pieces of lead hardware, a bottle cap, clear bottle glass,
green beverage bottle glass, lamp glass, whiteware sherds, bone fragments, peach pits, and a metal ring
possibly from a horse saddle or bridle (Appendix B, Photographs 43 through 45).
A small piece of red glass, a marine shell fragment, and a shard of decorative pane glass were encountered
in Unit E10. The piece of decorative glass appears to have been part of the glass casing for a gingerbreadstyle kitchen or parlor clock (Appendix B, Photograph 46). A lead fishing weight was found in Unit E9
(Appendix B, Photograph 47). Unit E3 contained the most unique artifacts along the east wall including
a small whiteware sherd with a gilded pattern, a mother-of-pearl button, and two, four-hole white glass
buttons (Appendix B, Photographs 48 and 49).

revealed a past paint scheme of pastel pink with black stripes or edging. No additional temporally or
functionally diagnostic artifacts were encountered.
In addition to artifacts, excavation along the east exterior wall revealed a series of bois d’arc posts used to
support the western edge of the front porch (Appendix B, Photograph 50). These posts were
systematically labeled and removed for the installation of the foundation grade beam. The posts were
restored to their original locations before the excavation units were refilled.
South Wall
Archeologists observed brick and limestone rubble along the south exterior wall, which may be associated
with the collapse of the original southern chimney after the house became a museum. The south wall units
contained the fewest number of artifacts of any of the areas associated with the house foundation. IES
archeologists recorded 72 artifacts, of which most were glass. Notable glass artifacts included the lip
fragment of an aqua colored beverage bottle, shards of a white opaque or milk glass teacup, and an intact
clear glass prescription bottle made by the Owens-Illinois Glass Company from Unit S2 (Appendix B,
Photographs 51 through 53). The bottle dates to around 1931 based on the date code to the right of the
logo and similar identified examples from the same period (Lockhart and Hoenig 2015). The base of
another Owens-Illinois Glass Company bottle was found in Unit S6 and was manufactured around 1949 as
indicated by the date code (Appendix B, Photograph 54).
Of the exterior wall areas, the south wall featured the highest frequency of ceramics. Six sherds of unglazed
coarse earthenware were found near the southwest corner of the house. These sherds were decorated with
a molded or stamped geometric pattern and appear to have been part of a flower pot dating to the 20th
century (Appendix B, Photographs 55 and 56). In Unit S4, a single stoneware sherd was collected. This
stoneware featured a medium brown exterior with a thin layer of salt glaze, a light gray body paste with
pale yellow clay inclusions, and an unglazed interior with a light reddish-brown wash (Appendix B,
Photographs 57 and 58). Based on these characteristics, this stoneware was probably produced in the
United States, and likely locally-produced, during the latter half 19th century (Greer 1981; Lebo 1992). Unit
S2 also contained a stoneware vessel sherd, which featured a buff colored clay body with a creamy white
Bristol glaze that generally dates to the 20th century for American-made stoneware (Lebo 1992; Appendix
B, Photograph 59). The artifact’s surface has several imperfections and inconsistent glazing. The same
unit also contained an undecorated fragment of ironstone china and a white ceramic marble or bottle stopper
(Appendix B, Photograph 60). Several units along the south exterior wall produced glazed stoneware
wastewater or drainage pipe fragments.
A lightning rod segment nearly identical to the one found along the north wall was removed from the
southeast corner of the house. This segment measured approximately 1 ft 9 ¼ in (54 cm) in length. Other
metal artifacts identified included a chisel or railroad spike, a shotgun cartridge, and part of a fork.
West Wall
The west exterior wall featured the most disturbance from the 1939 renovation and two-story addition to
the Gilbert House. Despite these disturbances, over 162 artifacts were recovered, including a high
concentration from under the stone and concrete walkway. Of the 12 units along the west wall, only seven
were sampled.
The majority of artifacts documented were metal (n=117) or glass (n=33) artifacts (Appendix B,
Photographs 61 and 62). Glass artifacts included clear bottle glass, the lip of an aqua colored canning jar
(see Section 5.2.3), and two shards of solarized purple glass, which resulted from the addition of manganese
to glass manufacturing from around 1890 to 1920 (Lindsey 2018a). Unit W10 contained an intact ambercolored Owens-Illinois Glass Company medicinal bottle. The bottle featured a metal screw cap, glass
molded in a vertical ribbed pattern, and contained some of its original liquid content (Appendix B,

Gilbert House Foundation Stabilization Project
Cultural Resources Report

IES Project No. 03.013.003
Page | 30

Photograph 63). The date code on the base of the bottle is “8,” which could date the bottle from the 1930s
to the 1960s. In the same unit, small pieces of green and white patterned linoleum flooring were observed.
The west wall area produced four different types of ceramics: coarse earthenware, whiteware, ironstone,
and porcelain. Both the coarse earthenware and whiteware were undecorated and lacked any diagnostic
features. A solid white ironstone sherd appears to have been part of a small plate or bowl rim featuring a
molded edge pattern (Appendix B, Photograph 64). Solid white ironstone was most popular in North
America from the 1850s to beginning of the 20th century (Miller 1991). The only ceramic north of the
western dogtrot entrance was a gilded porcelain fragment of a figurine or small decorative container. The
most distinguishable detail is a gilded letter “H” either at the beginning or end of word; however, this detail
did not provide enough information to identify the manufacturer or determine a date for the piece
(Appendix B, Photograph 65).
Multiple pieces of string, twine, or yarn were observed in the northern units along the west wall.
5.2.2 - Interior Walls within Dogtrot Area
Surface Inspection of Dogtrot Area
Following the removal of the interior dogtrot flooring, the ground surface of the dogtrot area was inspected
for the presence of artifacts prior to excavations. Fragile or unique artifacts were collected from the surface
to avoid breakage or destruction during construction activities.
5.2.2.1.1 - Ceramics
The broken remnants of a porcelain tea cup were collected near the middle of the north interior wall. The
porcelain was decorated with a decal depicting a repeating pattern of a white swan floating through pink
water lilies (Appendix B, Photographs 66 and 67). A fragment of the base of the cup is marked with the
second half of a light blue maker’s mark. The partial mark features the last letters of a word ending in
“KE,” the edge of a flower or wreath, and the letters “ON.” The mark appears to be a wreath with an M
(for Morimura) made by the Nortiake Company in Nippon (Japan). The Nortiake Company, which was
formed from a trading company known as Morimura Brothers, began producing porcelain wares to be
marketed in the West in 1904 (Noritake 2018; Nilsson 2018). Noritake products were shipped from Japan
to the United States around 1910. The company used several marks, including the wreath encircling a M
logo from the company’s inception until the 1940s (Nilsson 2018). As a result of the McKinley Tariff Act
of 1890, all porcelain was to be marked in English with its country of origin (Nilsson 2018). Early Nortiake
porcelain featured the word “Nippon,” which was the original formal name of the islands that constitute
what is now known as Japan. In 1921, the United States required the western name “Japan” be used on
marks instead of “Nippon” (Nilsson 2018). Noritake cups and matching saucers with a similar swan pattern
to the artifacts recovered from the Gilbert House appear to have been part of a promotion for the White
Swan Coffee company based in Dallas. In the 1920s, the dishes were included as prizes within the brand’s
coffee tin containers (McCollam 2011). Based on the makers mark and known association with a local
product brand, the porcelain tea cup sherds from the Gilbert House most likely date to the early 1920s.
Fragments of a refined earthenware cup or bowl were found in the same general area of the porcelain tea
cup sherds (Appendix B, Photograph 68). These sherds have the same texture and density as whiteware
ceramics, but with a blush or light rose colored clay paste. The paste color is the dominant color of the
vessel due to a clear glaze covering both the exterior and interior of the ceramic. Decoration includes a
floral motif decal with spots of blue overglaze and silver colored gilding around the rim of the dish. A
fragment of a cup from the same dish set had an intact base but did not have an identifiable maker’s mark
(See Section 5.2.2.2).
A fragment of a porcelain doll head was located in the center of the dogtrot area near the southern wall.
The porcelain is unglazed and painted in a light beige color. Notable features include the right ear of the
doll, a circular opening at the top of the head for hair inserts, and a partial maker’s mark on the back of the
Gilbert House Foundation Stabilization Project

head (Appendix B, Photograph 69). Visible characters include a “3” and a “N”. More fragments of the
doll head were uncovered in Unit IS5 (See Section 5.2.2.3). Two pieces of unglazed, hand-painted
porcelain fragments were also collected from the dogtrot (Appendix B, Photograph 70). However, these
fragments appear to have been part of a figurine rather than a doll based on forms and colors used.
A small sherd of white-bodied refined earthenware was recovered from fill excavated from the dogtrot
(Appendix B, Photograph 71). The fragment features a transferware style known as flow blue, which is
a result of cobalt blue-colored dye bleeding outside of its intended pattern. Flow blue was created in the
1830s as an error of the transferware printing process (Monet 2016). Despite pieces being rejected by
manufacturers, flow blue became increasingly popular within the emerging American middle and working
classes and was in highest demand during the Victorian period from the late 19th century to early 20th century
(Monet 2016).
5.2.2.1.2 - Glass
Three intact medicinal bottles were collected from the northwest corner of the dogtrot. The smallest of
these bottles (2 5/32 in by 1 3/8 in [5.5 by 3.5 cm]) is amber glass with a rectangular body, side mold seams,
and an external thread finish (Appendix B, Photographs 72 and 73). The top surface of the finish was
ground flat, indicating the bottle was mold blown. The bottle base is marked with a patent date of April
21, 1896. A small cork was found at the bottom of the bottle. During processing, the bottle broke into four
pieces.
Another bottle was a clear, round vial measuring approximately 3 11/32 in (8.5 cm) in length and 19/32 in (1.5
cm) in diameter. The bottle has two vertical mold seams, and a tooled finish with a cork closure (Appendix
B, Photograph 74). The base has a raised “O” that is either a pontil scar or a potential maker’s mark for
the Owens Bottle Company (1919 through 1929). On the Historic Glass Bottle Identification & Information
Website hosted by the Society for Historical Archaeology (SHA), Bill Lindsey indicated this type of vial
was mostly associated with homeopathic medicine (2018b). Most existing examples of this type lack mold
seams with the exception of machine-made bottles with vertical side seams that were produced from the
1920s to the 1940s (Lindsey 2018b).
The third bottle is the largest of the group, with dimensions of 4 11/32 by 1 9/16 in (11 by 4 cm). The bottle
features clear glass, a cork closure, side mold seams, and an embossed panel (Appendix B, Photograph
75). One panel of the bottle is marked with graduated volumetric scales for ounces (indicated by the
apothecary symbol ℥) and cubic centimeters (CC) with U.S.P. (U.S. Patent) near the base. The bottle base
is marked with a stylized S-like symbol. The shape of the bottle is known as a Philadelphia oval, which is
characterized by a rounded back panel, rounded sides, and a flat front panel to present label information.
This style was produced by most major bottle manufacturers from 1876 to the 1910s (Lindsey 2018b).
In addition to complete bottles, shards of a large aqua colored glass jug, two types of lamp glass, and a
fragment of decorated pressed glass were observed on the surface. The fragment of decorated press glass
consisted of clear glass that was approximately 0.4 in (1 cm) thick (Appendix B, Photograph 76). Two
larger fragments with the same pattern were recovered from the dogtrot during the 2016 excavation. The
piece appears to have been part of a serving bowl or platter.
5.2.2.1.3 - Metal
Centrally located near the north wall of the dogtrot was a hat or brooch pin. The Victorian period (1837 to
1901) pin features an oval-shaped piece of dark iridescent glass set within a decorated brass fixture
(Appendix B, Photograph 77). The hat pin measures approximately 2 ¾ in (7 cm) long. There are no
markings on the pin to indicate the maker or artist.
Another Victorian-age metal artifact is a hinged frame and clasp for a handheld coin purse found in the
center of the dogtrot (Appendix B, Photograph 78). The frame consists of three frame pieces connected
by two opposing hinges. The center frame piece appears to have supported fabric for a divider within the
Gilbert House Foundation Stabilization Project
Cultural Resources Report

IES Project No. 03.013.003

purse. The exterior frame pieces have visible rivet or tack heads around the perimeter of the frame and
each has a brass kiss lock style clasp. Analysis of the inside of the frames revealed small fragments of
leather held within the frame by the rivets or tacks. During the late Victorian period, small leather purses,
were popular among women for daytime traveling and social visits (Sessions 2018). Online searches
revealed similar Victorian leather coin purses with the same frame and clasp configuration.
Several 20th century artifacts were identified on the surface including a bottle cap, a marketing or advertising
button, and a label for an appliance. The cork-lined bottle cap is labeled “JAX” for the Jackson Brewing
Company located in New Orleans, in operation between 1890 and 1970 (Tulane University 2018; Appendix
B, Photograph 79). The company was named after the City’s famous Jackson Square and became locally
known as Jax Beer. Based on the history of the company and similar identified bottle caps, it appears the
cap dates from the 1940s to the 1960s. The advertising item is a 1-in (2.5-cm) diameter disc-shaped
celluloid button with a straight pin backing. The button design depicts a simplified wheel design
background with the slogan “Ship by Truck” in the foreground (Appendix B, Photograph 80). The
Firestone Tire and Rubber Company launched the “Ship by Truck” campaign in 1918 to promote the
commercial freight shipping industry and the development of the U.S. interstate highway system (Firestone
Tire and Rubber Company 1919; Weddell 1919). An aluminum disk labeled “Sears Homart” was found
near the southern wall among scraps of newspaper dating to the 1970s (Appendix B, Photograph 81). The
disk appears to have been part of a dial glued to the front of a thermostat discovered during the 2016
investigation by park staff. The shape, colors, and style of font indicates the artifact dates to the mid-20th
century.
Non-diagnostic metal artifacts from within the dogtrot area include a pair of scissors, two safety pins, a 5
by 4 cm rectangular brass frame, and a metal handle for a cup or mug.
5.2.2.1.4 - Other
Four animal bone fragments were encountered near the eastern and western entrances to the dogtrot. A
bone two-hole button was observed in the dogtrot backfill and collected (Appendix B, Photograph 82).
The dogtrot backfill also contained a large bottle cork measuring 1 ½ in (4 cm) in length and 1 in (2.5 cm)
in diameter and a boot heel (Appendix B, Photographs 83 and 84). The boot heel was marked with a label
indicating it was produced by the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and patented on 1 June 1915. Along
the southern wall, a scrap of newspaper was collected. The newspaper appears to date to the late 1960s or
1970s based on font style and an article on the Dick Cavett Show.
Interior North Wall Units
The units along the north wall within the dogtrot area produced the most artifacts of the project (Appendix
B, Photographs 85 through 87). A total of 597 artifacts were recorded from six units (Units IN2 through
IN7). Cut nails (n=121), both original to the house and reproduction, constituted the largest artifact
category. The interior north wall was the only area of the project to contain more cut nails than wire nails
(n=93). Clear bottle and window glass collectively numbered approximately 120 shards. Of organic
materials, investigators encountered 59 bones or bone fragments, most of which came from rodents or other
small mammals that inhabited the space below the house floor. Fragments of hickory, pecan, and peanut
shell found in some of the units are likely related to rodent activity. Peach pits (n=25) were identified in
nearly every interior north wall unit. The following subsections discuss unique or diagnostic artifacts
collected from the interior north wall units for further analysis.
5.2.2.2.1 - Ceramic
Ceramic sherds were encountered in only two units: IN2 and IN4. Both units contained fragments of the
rose-colored refined earthenware observed on the surface (See Section 5.2.2.1.1). The largest fragment was
of a teacup with an intact base (no maker’s mark present), part of a handle, and part of the side featuring a
floral motif (Appendix B, Photograph 88). The tea cup fragment indicates the vessel was octagonal in
Gilbert House Foundation Stabilization Project

shape. Unit IN4 contained another sherd of a Noritake porcelain cup with the White Swan Coffee decal
and a small fragment of unglazed painted porcelain from a figurine (Appendix B, Photograph 89).
A small clay marble was recovered from Unit IN2 (Appendix B, Photograph 90). The marble measured
approximately 0.39 in (10 millimeters [mm]) in diameter. The marble consists of unglazed earthenware
that was dyed red. Dyed clay marbles were generally mass produced from 1890 to 1914 (Gartley and
Carskadden 1998).
5.2.2.2.2 - Glass
Most glass encountered in the excavation units lacked any distinguishing characteristics. No intact bottles
or marked bottle bases were observed in these units. Units IN6 and IN7 contained the pieces of an aqua
colored canning jar, most likely produced by Ball Brothers Glass Manufacturing Company (1884 to
present). Unit IN6 also contained several shards of clear lamp glass including a pressed glass rim piece and
a piece with an etched pattern (Appendix B, Photograph 91).
A glass marble measuring approximately ¾ in (20 mm) in diameter was recovered from Unit IN5
(Appendix B, Photograph 92). The marble is of the “cats eye” style, characterized by a red and white
helix encased in clear glass. Due to damage of the exterior, the method of manufacture (handmade or
machine-made) and specific core pattern could not be determined. From the same unit, archeologists also
observed a milk glass rim shard with a visible “S.” This piece appears to have been the vessel base or a lid
for a cosmetics, ointment, or cream jar. These milk glass jars were generally produced from the 1890s to
mid-20th century (Lindsey 2018a). Unit IN6 also contained two milk or opaque glass shards; however,
these shards lacked any discernable features.
5.2.2.2.3 - Metal
Most of the unique metal artifacts collected from the dogtrot north wall were associated with sewing and
textiles. In the central units (IN3, IN4, and IN5), archeologists observed a copper alloy dressmaker pin, a
brass safety pin with small fragments of plain cloth attached, a modified safety pin with an attached loop
for a medal, and a brass fastener with a hook and prong for a strap (Appendix B, Photographs 93 through
95).
The westernmost unit, IN7, contained two dressmaker pins (Appendix B, Photograph 96). A 5 mm
grommet and a molded round eyelet and stem were also recovered in the unit (Appendix B, Photograph
97). The centimeter-long molded eyelet appears to have been part of another object. Other notable metal
artifacts included a pair of scissors, a wire loop fragment, part of a can, a 0.22 bullet casing, and 13 corklined bottle caps, one of which was marked “JAX” (See Section 5.2.2.1.3).
5.2.2.2.4 - Bone
Of the 59 faunal remains, only a few bone and teeth fragments were collected for further analysis. The
northeast corner contained three bones that were possibly from a pig or cow. Two of these bones were
clearly butchered as indicated by the clean cut through the bone, revealing a section of cancellous bone
within the outer compact bone layer and a central cavity that once contained bone marrow (Appendix B,
Photograph 98).
At the western end of the dogtrot, Unit IN7 contained three animal teeth from unknown species and a partial
lower mandible. The mandible measured 6 cm in length and featured sharp, teeth-like ridges, a partial
cavity along the length of the mandible interior, and a scale-like texture on the mandible interior (Appendix
B, Photograph 99). The mandible represents a species of waterfowl known as a common merganser
(Mergus merganser). Common mergansers have serrated-edged bills used for catching and eating fish,
hence giving them the collective vernacular name “sawbills”. The common merganser is found mostly in
riverine habitats or along lakes (National Audubon Society 2018). Unlike other species of waterfowl with
plant-based diets, the common merganser is typically not considered appetizing for human consumption
due to a fish-based diet giving its meat a distinct flavor, but it can be prepared with heavy seasoning.

5.2.2.2.5 - Textiles, Leather, and String
Fragments of cloth were observed throughout the dogtrot. Examples in fairly good condition were collected
from the samples taken from Units IN3 and IN6. One example features a synthetic cloth dyed royal blue
with white polka dots (Appendix B, Photograph 100). According to an article titled “A Brief History of
Polka Dots” by Chloe Pantazi, polka dots became popular in the mid-to-late 1920s after Miss America
contestants began wearing polka dot swimsuits and the Walt Disney Company introduced the animated
Minnie Mouse character, with her iconic red polka dot dress (2013).
Another piece of fabric was made of a synthetic material, possibly Rayon. The small swatch of fabric had
a soft, fluid pattern of black dotted lines and continuous red lines over a beige background (Appendix B,
Photograph 101). Based on the colors and style of pattern, the fabric most likely dates to the 1940s.
However, similar styles were recycled in the 1970s and 1980s. A third fabric fragment does not feature a
distinguishable color or pattern. The synthetic material is a dark gray and reddish brown that has color in
patches (Appendix B, Photograph 102).
A fabric label was found in Unit IN3. The label measures approximately 2 in by 1 3/8 in and has holes at
each corner indicative of attachment to another textile by thread (Appendix B, Photograph 103). The
label has a printed geometric border, a stamped number, and two sets of hand written characters that are
not discernable. Unit IN3 also contained seven segments of string of various sizes, colors, and threading
(Appendix B, Photographs 105 and 106).
Two pieces of leather were identified in the western unit samples. One piece had been roughly cut into a
teardrop shape measuring 1 in by 2 in (Appendix B, Photograph 104). A button hole extending
approximately ½ in was cut into the leather. The other leather artifact is a strip of leather, 4 in long and ½
in wide, with no other discernable characteristics.
5.2.2.2.6 - Paper and Wood
The most significant paper artifact found in the interior north wall units was a tag. The tag measures
approximately ½ in by 13/32 in. The front of the tag depicts a red cross and the words “2ND WAR FUND”
within a navy-blue border (Appendix B, Photographs 107 and 108). The back of the tag is marked with
a patent date of “May 16th, 1905” and the manufacturer identified as “Bastian Bros. Co., Rochester, NY.”
The tag was part of a lapel pin produced by the Bastion Brothers Company, which was known for making
badges, buttons, emblems, and pins. This particular lapel pin was given to Americans who contributed
money to the American Red Cross during World War I (1914 to 1918). According to the American Red
Cross, the second war fund drive occurred from 20 through 27 May 1918 with total contributions estimated
to be over 175 million dollars from 43 million people, with Texans responsible for approximately 1.9
percent of the total contributions for both war funds (American Red Cross 1919).
Unit IN2 contained a piece of wood that had been whittled (Appendix B, Photograph 109). The piece
appears to have been shaped into a pestle with a long handle for grinding substances in a mortar. The
artifact measures approximately 6 in long and 1 in wide. The wood appears to be pine as evident by its
weight, color, and texture. Pieces of bark from a pine or bois d’arc tree were observed in adjacent Unit
IN3.
Three unidentified artifacts of the same material were found in Units IN2 and IN6. These artifacts consist
of rolled up paper or thin shavings from a soft wood (Appendix B, Photographs 110 and 111). Each strip
measures approximately 1 in width. There are no visible written markings on the surface of each roll. None
of the material has black spots or stripes indicative of birch bark. Multiple faint dark lines are visible along
the length of each rolled strip.
5.2.2.2.7 - Other
The interior north wall artifact assemblage included six buttons composed of various materials. Three of
these buttons are made of shell (Appendix B, Photographs 97 and 112). The shell button from Unit IN7
Gilbert House Foundation Stabilization Project
Cultural Resources Report

IES Project No. 03.013.003
Page | 35

appeared to have been handmade as indicated by imperfections in overall shape and irregular size of the
holes. The other two shell buttons, found in Unit IN2, were machine manufactured examples. In the United
States, shell buttons began to be manufactured for domestic markets in 1892 (Marcel 1994). Unit IN6
contained a 1-in-diameter, round, fabric-covered button (Appendix B, Photographs 113 and 114). The
button is composed of a metal core covered with fragments of fabric that have been discolored by oxidation.
Fabric buttons began to be produced in the early 19th century and are still manufactured today (Marcel
1994). The remaining two buttons, both from Unit IN4, were made of plastic (Appendix B, Photograph
115). One of these buttons was composed of a dark brown plastic and the other button is black with a
textured dome shape and a wire shank on the back. According to research compiled by Sarah Elizabeth
Marcel (1994), plastic buttons were first produced in 1869 using celluloid.
Unit IN4 also contained a unique seed pod from a native Texas plant known as Devil’s Claw (Proboscidea
louisianica; Appendix B, Photograph 116). The plant derives its vernacular name from the manner in
which its curved fruit dries and splits into ‘claws’ that catch on the legs of wild animals and livestock.
Devil’s Claw has historically been used for culinary purposes and for crafting.
Interior South Wall Units
A total of 397 artifacts were recorded from the interior south wall units (Appendix B, Photographs 117
through 119). Nails comprised the largest category of artifacts (n=120). Clear bottle and window glass
numbered 76 shards with a few shards of aqua colored glass, lamp glass, light bulb glass, milk glass, and
pieces of a mirror. Of the organic materials encountered, there were 66 bones or bone fragments, 16 peach
pits, and 12 pieces of hickory, acorn, pecan, and peanut shell. The following subsections discuss unique or
diagnostic artifacts collected from the interior south wall units for further analysis.
5.2.2.3.1 - Ceramic
Only five ceramic artifacts were observed within the interior south wall units. The oldest ceramic identified
from the Gilbert House during the project is a sherd of pearlware from Unit IS2. Pearlware is a type of
refined earthenware developed in England in the 1770s. This ceramic type is mainly identified by a bluish
tint created by the addition of cobalt blue to the glaze to mimic the appearance of Chinese porcelain. The
pearlware sherd from the dogtrot features a hand-painted green leaf sprig pattern under a blue-tinted glaze
(Appendix B, Photograph 120). Sprig-painted wares were generally produced from the 1830s until the
1860s (Esary 1982:185; Maryland Archaeological Conservation Lab 2018).
Unit IS5 contained three sherds of unglazed, painted porcelain identical in color, texture, and body paste to
the doll head fragment collected from the dogtrot surface (See Section 5.2.2.1.1). None of these sherds
contain distinct features indicative of a doll (Appendix B, Photograph 121). Because none of the doll
head fragments from the dogtrot area had intact markings, it is unknown when the doll was made.
An undecorated, glazed porcelain button was also within the sample from Unit IS5. The four-hole button
had a diameter of approximately 19/32 in (Appendix B, Photograph 122). Also known as China buttons,
porcelain buttons began to be manufactured in the 1840s and are still produced today (Marcel 1994).
5.2.2.3.2 - Glass
The dogtrot south wall units contained two clear glass bottle stoppers (Appendix B, Photographs 123 and
124). These stoppers are commonly known as club sauce type stoppers due to their function of sealing
glass bottles containing sauces (Lindsey 2018c). The molded glass stoppers featured a flat, disk-like finial
and a shank fitted with a cork sheath. Although the glass stopper from Unit IS2 had lost its cork fitting, the
stopper from UNIT IS4 retains an intact cork sheath on the shank just below the finial. These glass and
cork combination bottle stoppers generally date from the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century (Lindsey
2018c).
Multiple glass beads were recovered from the central and eastern dogtrot units. Unit IS4 contained an intact
string of round glass beads (Appendix B, Photograph 125). The string was approximately 4 ½ in long
Gilbert House Foundation Stabilization Project
Cultural Resources Report

IES Project No. 03.013.003
Page | 36

with a total of 65 beads, each measuring 2 mm in diameter. The beads were a translucent cream color with
some spots of pearl-like iridescent paint. An opaque red bead was collected from the same unit sample.
The 3-mm red bead was round and faceted (Appendix B, Photograph 125). From Unit IS5, a clear, tear
drop shaped 1-in-long glass bead with seams from a mold was observed (Appendix B, Photograph 126).
A 7-mm, round, purple faceted bead was collected from Unit IS6.
A milk glass lid fragment was found on the western side of the dogtrot. The partial lid featured molded
milk glass detailed with roses, scalloped edges, and traces of paint (Appendix B, Photograph 127). The
artifact was once part of a Victorian jewelry or trinket box.
5.2.2.3.3 - Metal
A metal cap for a shaving cream tin was found in Unit IS3 (Appendix B, Photograph 128). The cap has
a diameter of 1 in. The exterior is covered with a black and white printed logo with an inscription of
“Ingram’s Therapeutic Shaving Cream / Sample Box / Relieves Razor Rash / Cooling / Soothing /
Antiseptic.” This artifact is identical to caps used on small product sample tins. According to early 20th
century newspaper advertisements, the Frederick F. Ingram Company was established in 1885 and based
in Detroit, Michigan. In 1929, the company was acquired by Bristol-Myers (Bennett 2018).
Five crown closure bottle caps were encountered along the south wall. Two of these bottle caps had solid
cork liners and another had a composition cork liner. One of the solid cork lined caps was marked with the
red and silver logo for Coca Cola (Appendix B, Photograph 129). Based on the style of logo, it appears
the Coca Cola bottle cap dates to the 1950s or 1960s.
One of the most unique artifacts identified is a pocket watch case from Unit IS4. The watch case was brass
plated with a diameter of almost 2 in (Appendix B, Photographs 130 and 131). The watch was missing
all of the interior mechanisms, dial crystal, watch face, dials, exterior lid(s), hinges, the bow for attaching
a watch chain, and the decorative crown. In North America, the pocket watch was in high demand during
the second half of the 19th century until the 1930s or 1940s, when wrist watches became the popular form
of personal timekeeping (Thompson 2014). Based on aesthetic characteristics and use of brass, the watch
case appears to have been mass-produced in the 20th century as a cheaper alternative to gold or silver
watches. Because maker’s marks were often placed on the inside of the watch cover or interior mechanism,
the precise age and make of this pocket watch could not be determined.
Unit IS4 contained the base fragment of a tin can. The base fragment was 2 in in diameter and embossed
with a central “H” within a circle. Outside of the embossed circle, the artifact was marked with “SNUFF”
and a partial word beginning with “HO…”. Similar logos indicate the tin can was the Honest Scotch brand
of dry snuff manufactured by the American Snuff Company (1900 to present). The same unit also yielded
an intact tin can with a screw top lid. The can appears to be an unmarked tin for dry snuff measuring 2 3/8
in in height and 1 9/16 in in diameter. A similar intact snuff tin with a threaded lid was identified from Unit
IS2. The can is smaller in size at approximately 2 in in height and 1 3/16 in in diameter (Appendix B,
Photograph 132). No visible markings were identified on the can. Both intact cans from IS2 and IS4 still
contain some of their original contents.
Other metal artifacts include a four-hole brass button, an iron ring, part of a paper shotgun cartridge, and a
brass strap buckle with fabric remnants. In addition, Unit IS3 contained two brass dressmaker pins and a
small metal pin or clothing snap featuring a dog (Appendix B, Photograph 133).
5.2.2.3.4 - Bone
The interior south wall units contained 66 animal bones comprising both domesticated animals and rodents.
Many of the larger bones have cuts and marks indicative of butchering (Appendix B, Photograph 134 and
135).
During excavation of Unit IS4, a worker encountered the lower mandible of a boar (Sus scrofa)
approximately 20 to 30 cm below surface near the western end of the unit (Appendix B, Photograph 136).
Gilbert House Foundation Stabilization Project
Cultural Resources Report

IES Project No. 03.013.003
Page | 37

The most predominant feature of the mandible is a 2.5 cm long tusk or canine tooth protruding from the
side of the bone. The shape of the ramus and size of the teeth indicate the boar was domesticated rather
than wild. A fragment of the upper jaw of a pig was found in Unit IS7 (Appendix B, Photograph 137).
The fragment contains one premolar and a large canine tooth.
Another mandible from a common merganser was identified in Unit IS6 (See Section 5.2.2.2.4). The bone
is less than 5 cm in length, indicating it is from a smaller individual than the one encountered in Unit IN7
(Appendix B, Photograph 138).
5.2.2.3.5 - Wood
A wooden handle was observed near the surface of Unit IS4. The wooden handle was 5 ½ in long with a
½ in diameter. The artifact was made of carved wood covered with a woven fabric grip (Appendix B,
Photograph 139). A piece of iron, either a nail or remnant of a pole, was located at only one end of the
handle. The handle appears to have been part of a fishing pole or golf club.
5.2.2.3.6 - Other
Unit IS3 yielded a piece of crocheted string, which appears to have been part of a border for clothing or
linens (Appendix B, Photograph 140). Other fiber artifacts include a beige-colored swath of cloth, three
pieces of string, and yarn made from spun natural fibers (plant or animal based).
Unit IS2 contained two small fragments of a marine shell (Appendix B, Photograph 141), likely a scallop
(Pectinidae sp.) or cockle (Cardiidae sp.). Marine shell was also observed in the remnants of a midden
containing 19th and early 20th century artifacts at the western end of the 1938 Gilbert House addition.
Both Units IS3 and IS4 contained shoe heels from women’s footwear (Appendix B, Photograph 142).
The heels were composed of layers of rubber bound together by nails or screws.
5.2.3 - Drainage Pipe Installation Area
The drainage pipe installation area yielded the fewest artifacts of the project. From the five units sampled,
only 28 artifacts were observed. These artifacts included wire nails (n=14), clear bottle glass (n=4), aqua
bottle glass (n=2), undecorated porcelain (n=2), decorated whiteware (n=1), a metal bracket, a piece of steel
wire, a machine-made, red-paste brick fragment, a white plastic pony bead, and an unidentified piece of
plastic. The large shard of aqua glass from a canning jar was found in Unit DT1. The shard was inscribed
with “Ball” in cursive script (Appendix B, Photograph 143). Based on the distinct style of the logo (tripleL) and aqua color found in early Ball glass jars, the canning jar was manufactured between 1896 and 1910.
No additional diagnostic artifacts were observed in the area.
5.2.4 - Architectural Debris
During removal of the flagstone walkway along the west side of house, construction staff encountered
bricks bearing the “ACME FERRIS” stamp, indicating they were manufactured by the Acme Brick
Company in Ferris, Texas factory between 1934 and 1968. It appears these bricks were added during the
1938 renovation to create a support wall for the western floor beam under the dogtrot entrance. Bricks with
the same mark were observed within a sidewalk southwest of the house.
The dogtrot area contained a large amount of architectural debris. Limestone fragments were scattered
across the area with higher concentrations found along the walls and corners of the dogtrot. It appears most
of these stones are byproducts of structural modifications during previous renovations and alterations to the
house walls. When utility pipes and electricity lines were installed under the house in the 20th century, parts
of the limestone walls were removed to create access between adjacent rooms. Archeologists also observed
pieces of lumber, burned limestone fragments, and wood trim, which was painted a mint green. Pink
painted plaster chips and small chunks of wall were also observed.

5.2.5 - Miscellaneous Artifacts from Undocumented Locations
Throughout the project, several artifacts were collected from undocumented locations by personnel
associated with the project when archeologists were not present on the site (i.e., before or after normal work
hours, during periods devoted exclusively to pouring and curing concrete, etc.), but were presented to IES
archeologists at a later time. Artifacts collected included animal bones (n=4), small iron spikes (n=2),
unidentified metal hardware (n=1), a wire nail, and a green glass marble (Appendix B, Photograph 144).
5.2.6 - Site Summary
IES conducted archeological monitoring during construction activities for the Gilbert House foundation
stabilization project. Over 1,800 artifacts were identified from within and immediately around the house,
which was designated as historic-age archeological site 41DL541. Other than the cut nails ubiquitous at
the site, only three artifacts were ascertained to have production date ranges that coincide with the mid-tolate 19th century (1855/1856 to 1890) component of the site, related to the occupation of the house by Dr.
Gilbert and his family. These artifacts consist of a single a pearlware fragment (1820 to 1870; Moir 1987),
a piece of flow blue transferware (1840 to 1870), and a salt-glazed stoneware sherd (1850 to 1875; Greer
1981). The majority of diagnostic artifacts observed by past park staff and encountered by IES
archeologists date from the 1890s to the 1930s, when the house was owned by Isabella Gilbert Hughes and
her family. These artifacts include highly stylized objects of the late Victorian period, marked glass bottles,
and unique personal items.
The scarcity of 19th century artifacts observed within the site, especially the dogtrot area, might be attributed
to either refuse management practices by the Gilbert family or historical disturbances in and around the
house. Based on field observations and the absence of sizeable artifacts after the mid-20th century, it appears
the hardwood flooring currently in the dogtrot was added during the 1939 remodel. Identified artifacts
dating after 1939 generally consisted of lighter materials (newspaper, fabric) found near rodent nests. The
dogtrot area also contained 20th-century architectural debris including plaster from the 1939 remodel and a
Sears Homart dial for an electronic thermostat found in the 2016 investigation.
Because the dogtrot was used in the past as a dining and social area, archeologists encountered artifacts
related to food preparation and serving. Artifacts related to foodways include butchered bones, peach pits,
nut shells, and food container fragments. The northeast and southwest corners of the dogtrot contained
bone segments that had been saw cut to create steaks or chops. In addition, remains of hogs were
encountered in the central units, including a mandible discovered 30 cmbs. Considering its depth and size,
it is unlikely this hog mandible was dropped on the ground. At the western end of the dogtrot, archeologists
encountered two common merganser mandibles belonging to different specimens. Although it is
ambiguous if these mandibles relate to foodways, this species of waterfowl is edible despite having a poor
taste. If common merganser was consumed at the site, it may indicate an inhabitant of the house had to
resort to local wildlife to compensate for loses in diet.
During the 2016 investigation, large fragments of a pressed glass serving dish were collected. These
fragments may verify past use of the dogtrot as a social space for parties and dances. However, the majority
of artifacts associated with consumable goods, such as bottle caps, glass beverage bottles, and snuff cans,
appear to date to the mid or late 20th century when the house was remodeled and later restored.
The dogtrot also contained numerous artifacts related to sewing and crafting. These artifacts include brass
dress pins, two pairs of scissors, safety pins, thread, yarn, buttons, beads, scraps of cloth, and leather pieces.
The dogtrot is likely to have served as a place for crafting; however, differential preservation is likely an
issue in the preservation of these items. Additionally, artifacts related to fashion accessories were
encountered within the dogtrot. Based on stylistic details, a few of these fashion accessories dated to the
Victorian period such as the brass hat pin inset with iridescent glass, the frame and clasp for a leather coin
purse, and a fragment of a pressed milk glass lid for a dresser box. Most of these artifacts were observed

in the central units but may have been displaced by staff during the 2016 investigation. Three lapel pins
relating to political or military paraphernalia were found between the eastern room doorways.
In addition to foods and crafts, children’s toys were observed within the site. Both the exterior and interior
units contained marbles, which were made of dyed clay, glazed ceramic, and glass. Considering the long
history of marbles, the manufacturing dates of these marbles are unknown. Within the dogtrot, four
fragments of a porcelain doll head were observed along the south wall. An intact porcelain arm of a doll
was recovered by park staff in 2016 in the center of the dogtrot. The coloration and size of the arm indicates
it is from a different doll than the one found during archeological monitoring.
The exterior wall units contained fewer artifacts than the dogtrot area. Background research and field
observations indicate there are have been disturbances caused by past construction activities, installation of
utilities, and park-related pedestrian traffic. The south and west wall units were the most disturbed as a
result of the 1939 remodel and subsequent attempts to stabilize the house. Despite these disturbances,
fragments from various glass bottles and ceramic vessels were still encountered. During excavation,
evidence of ground disturbance was observed within the north wall units. Construction workers
encountered at least two different utility lines and the remnants of a French drain. A photograph of the
house in the 1997 shows the wall was once lined with overgrown shrubs (Appendix C, Figure 3).
Photographs and information provided by the museum curator indicate a large oak tree fell on the north
side of the house after it was restored. Nails and window glass from the north units and adjacent east and
west wall units might be related to damage and repairs of the house from this event.

CHAPTER 6: SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

During the course of monitoring the Gilbert House Foundation Stabilization Project from 16 April to 21
May 2018, 57 units were excavated and sampled from the interior and exterior of the NRHP-listed Gilbert
House. Archeologists observed and recorded over 1,800 artifacts, including nails, glass, ceramics, and
bone. The highest concentration of artifacts was within the dogtrot area and the lowest was in the samples
taken during the installation of the drainage pipe near the house.
Although the house was inhabited by Dr. Gilbert from its construction in 1855 to 1890, only cut nails and
a few ceramic sherds date to this period. Instead, the majority of identified diagnostic artifacts, with the
exception of nails, were produced from 1890 to the 1930s. These artifacts include intact glass bottles with
maker’s marks, a Victorian hat or brooch pin, a Victorian leather coin purse, a paper tag for a WWI war
fund lapel pin, a labeled shaving cream sample tin lid, and a decorated porcelain cup once part of a
promotional give away. Significant artifacts that are not datable but give insight into daily life in the 19th
and 20th centuries include items relating to food, crafts, and toys. Over the course of the project, multiple
historic and modern modifications of the house were observed by IES. Despite known disturbances to older
artifact deposits, some of these modifications appear to have also preserved deposits such as the addition
of hardwood flooring to the dogtrot in the late 1930s, which encapsulated late 19th and early 20th century
artifacts.
The IES investigation of the NRHP listed Gilbert House validated Criterion D by verifying the presence of
a historic-aged site (41DL541). The site was mostly concentrated within the footprint of the home, but
other areas outside the APE or beyond the scope of the project may contain buried deposits and/or features.
Areas of potential future investigations include under the flooring in other interior rooms of the house, an
artifact scatter observed behind the rear wing addition, and a well or cistern indicated on a map that has
been covered with landscaping. As investigation of the site was limited to the footprint of the house and
the drainage pipe installation project area, the site boundaries remain unknown outside of the project APE.
Because Criterion D is valid for the Gilbert House, additional archeological monitoring and THC
coordination will be required for any future projects involving sub-surface disturbances within and near the
house.

The G i l b e r t Homestead i s a rare s u r v i v a l , a mid-19th Century farmhouse i n the
Dallas suburb of Farmers Branch. Surrounded by mid-20th Century suburban
residences and a c i t y park, the G i l b e r t Homestead i s an Early Texas stone b u i l d i n g
demonstrating modest Greek Revival i n f l u e n c e . A rear wing added i n 1939 i s
considered compatible, and the house has r e c e n t l y undergone a sympathetic
r e h a b i l i t a t i o n . No s u r v i v i n g h i s t o r i c o u t b u i l d i n g s remain, although a r t i f a c t s
dating from the 1850s through the 1930s are scattered over the property.

The main block of the G i l b e r t Homestead i s a 1-story, rectangular, loadbearing masonry (rubblestone) b u i l d i n g approximately 28 f e e t wide and 48 feet
long. The entrance (east) f r o n t i s seven bays wide arranged i n an a-b-a-c-a-b-a
rhythm. The "a"s represent 6-over-6 pane double-hung windows; "b"s are doors w i t h
two v e r t i c a l panels; and "c" i s the c e n t r a l , wide two-panel double doors w i t h a
seven-light transom. The e x t e r i o r of the main block i s of uncoursed limestone
rubble. The f r o n t g a l l e r y extending the length of the house i s supported by e i g h t
square posts; these are symmetrically placed, except f o r a s l i g h t l y wider, center
opening. The house i s surmounted by a wood shingle hipped roof.
The n o r t h and south elevations of the main block are m i r r o r images. Each
features a centered b r i c k i n t e r i o r chimney r i s i n g out of the r o o f , the inset of
the f r o n t g a l l e r y t o the east and two 6-over-6 windows t o the west. The rear
(west) of the main block has c e n t r a l , wide double doors w i t h a sjoranetrically
placed 6-over-6 window t o the n o r t h and door t o the south.
An open breezeway connects the main block w i t h a 1939 frame wing extending
west from the o r i g i n a l s t r u c t u r e . The west wing i s i r r e g u l a r i n i t s shape, massing
and m a t e r i a l s . Somewhat rectangular i n shape, i t extends westward approximately 80
feet from the main block. Much of the ground f l o o r i s covered by very rough
brickwork, some b r i c k s p r o j e c t i n g s l i g h t l y t o create various shadow l i n e s . The
center second f l o o r extension and areas behind the garage and servants' quarters
are clad i n wood s i d i n g . Windows are generally 6-over-6 sash. The gabled roofs of
the f r o n t and rear sections of the west wing are s l i g h t l y staggered. A small
belvedere r i s e s above the garage/servants' quarters.
The i n t e r i o r of the main block i s i n a basic four room, c e n t r a l h a l l plan,
the c e n t r a l h a l l being the d o g t r o t . Square rooms at each side of the entrance have
center doors on the east, west and dogtrot w a l l s , and f i r e p l a c e s centered on the
outside end w a l l s . Rear rooms are shallower w i t h a door or window centered on each
w a l l . Walls are plastered and c e i l i n g s are clad w i t h board-and-batten lumber.
Floors i n the o r i g i n a l four rooms are chestnut. O r i g i n a l doors and mantels i n the
main block were removed many years ago. Old, salvaged, four-panel doors and
simple, period mantels were selected f o r the recent r e s t o r a t i o n .

c o n f i g u r a t i o n of the o r i g i n a l f i r e p l a c e s were revealed w i t h the 1939 mantels were
removed i n 1985.
I n the 1939 remodeling of the G i l b e r t House, the dogtrot was glazed i n on the
east w i t h a 2-pane, p l a t e glass window and f l a n k i n g 12-pane s i d e l i g h t s . The w a l l
between the dogtrot and the southeast room was removed t o create a large l i v i n g
room, and the northwest room was converted i n t o a kitchen. A concrete slab f r o n t
g a l l e r y f l o o r and west terrace was also constructed. These changes were a l l
reversed i n t h e 1983 r e s t o r a t i o n , as may be seen i n nomination photographs.
As b u i l t i n 1939, the rear wing contained four bedrooms, four baths and a
two-car garage. These were modified f o r other uses i n the 1983 r e h a b i l i t a t i o n : the
east bedroom was transformed i n t o an open breezeway t o d i s t i n g u i s h the older main
block, p u b l i c restrooms were created, and the three remaining bedrooms and garage
were adapted f o r operational purposes. The wing has retained an e s s e n t i a l l y
unchanged e x t e r i o r appearance. I t s rooms generally have hardwood f l o o r s , p l a s t e r
or gypsum board walls and simple a r c h i t e c t u r a l d e t a i l i n g .
The house i s s i t e d on an f l a t , 2.2 acre t r a c t . A p a i r of cedar trees grow i n
f r o n t of the house, as was common w i t h 19th Century Texas farmhouses. Ancient post
oak trees are found on the property as w e l l as f u l l y mature pecan and American elm
trees.
An on-site v i s i t was made t o the s i t e by h i s t o r i c a l archaeologist Randall
Moir of Southern Methodist U n i v e r s i t y i n September, 1987. He reported
Surface a r t i f a c t s i n d i c a t e a broad but l i g h t s c a t t e r
of mid-19th and l a t e - 1 9 t h century a r t i f a c t s consistent
w i t h expectations f o r a r u r a l homestead of t h i s period
i n North Central Texas. Excavations by S.M.U. of s i m i l a r
homesites w i t h i n 100 miles of the G i l b e r t House have
generally encountered from 100,000 t o 300,000 a r t i f a c t s
i n the yardscapes of houses occupied between 1850 and
1930. We have no reason t o exclude the G i l b e r t homesite
from t h i s p a t t e r n and surface evidence observed t o date
supports our p o s i t i o n . Notable a r t i f a c t s observed include
fragments of l o c a l l y produced stoneware crocks/jugs
(ca. 1860-1890), imported stonewares (both B r i t i s h and
non-Texan types), p l a i n and molded b l u i s h t i n t i r o n stones (ca. 1850-1910), common ironstones (ca. 18401910), whitewares (ca. 1890-1940+), and i v o r y t i n t e d

whitewares (ca. 1910-1940+), which cover the e n t i r e
spectrum of h i s t o r i c occupations. Also observed were
sherds of hand-finished b o t t l e glass (post-1902),
pressed t a b l e glass (both 19th and 20th century
v a r i e t i e s ) , cut n a i l s (1840-1900), wire n a i l s (1890present), e a r l y window glass, animal bone, personal
items, a r c h i t e c t u r a l remains, and other a r t i f a c t s .
Items noted from Dr. G i l b e r t ' s e a r l y occupation
included an applied b o t t l e neck, molded ironstone,
l o c a l stoneware, and imported B r i t i s h brown stoneware, a l l predating 1870. [Randall Moir t o Peter

Statement of Significance (in one paragraph)
The Samuel and J u l i a G i l b e r t House i s perhaps the oldest recognizable house
s t i l l on i t s o r i g i n a l s i t e i n Dallas County. A remarkable and w e l l - r e s t o r e d Early
Texas rock house, i t was the home of Dr. Samuel H. G i l b e r t and h i s w i f e J u l i a Ann.
A sympathetic 1939 a d d i t i o n t o the rear of the house i s considered the major 20th
century component i n the a r c h i t e c t u r a l e v o l u t i o n of the house. A r t i f a c t s and s i t e
features dating from ca. 1850 through 1930 are found on the surrounding grounds of
the property, which meets C r i t e r i o n C f o r i t s a r c h i t e c t u r a l and C r i t e r i o n D f o r i t s
archaeological s i g n i f i c a n c e .

Samuel H. G i l b e r t (1828-1890), a n a t i v e of Tennessee, i s documented i n the
1850 census as a resident of Cass County, Texas. I n 1852 he married J u l i a Ann
R i t c h i e (c.1836-1882), a f e l l o w Tennessean, and three years l a t e r purchased 307
acres of John L. Pulliam's 1842 Peters' Colony headright. The Colony was the f i r s t
major Republic of Texas c o l o n i z a t i o n e f f o r t i n the region. Because of Colony l e g a l
problems. Dr. G i l b e r t d i d not receive clear t i t l e t o the land u n t i l 1868.
The G i l b e r t s constructed t h e i r home apparently i n 1855 and 1856. The s c a r c i t y
of s u r v i v i n g mid-19th Century houses i n Dallas County makes e s t a b l i s h i n g an
a r c h i t e c t u r a l context d i f f i c u l t . From what we do know, i t appears t h a t t y p i c a l l y
houses were smaller and of log or frame c o n s t r u c t i o n , as b e f i t t e d a f r o n t i e r
settlement. The plan of the G i l b e r t House i s perhaps representative of more
prosperous homes of the period: i t features two 3-bay blocks w i t h a c e n t r a l dogtrot
and f r o n t g a l l e r y . The G i l b e r t Homestead, however, as a rock house was of more
durable construction m a t e r i a l than most contemporaneous area houses, and i t was
l i k e l y more a r c h i t e c t u r a l l y pretentious than the t y p i c a l Dallas County house of the
period. The l a r g e , hipped gable roof i s unusually prominent; such roofs and inset
porches are found i n Louisiana houses of the period, but are less l i k e l y i n the
Texas f r o n t i e r .
Dr. G i l b e r t was c l e a r l y a person of influence i n the area. As a medical
doctor, h i s a r r i v a l was doubtless a welcome event. His d i a r y i s f i l l e d w i t h notes
describing t r i p s taken t o a i d the s i c k or i n j u r e d , and of p a t i e n t s seeking him a t
home f o r treatment. A d d i t i o n a l l y he had h i s own farming and l i v e s t o c k operations;
his d i a r y mentions growing wheat, corn, c o t t o n , oats, dewberries, melons and
potatoes, while l i v e s t o c k included c a t t l e ( f o r which he received a registered
earmark i n 1860) and sheep ( h i s herd numbered 555 by 1862). He apparently h i r e d
slave labor t o a s s i s t i n the development of h i s property i n i t s e a r l y days.

Dr. G i l b e r t remained a c i v i l i a n but c o n t r i b u t e d t o the war e f f o r t during the
C i v i l War years. I n 1861, he and one R. M. Cook held a meeting at the Union
Schoolhouse t o help r a i s e a m i l i t i a t o "defend our coiintry and southern r i g h t s , "
and the two also raised money f o r the Dallas Coxmty Soldiers Aid Society. I n May,
1863, the Dallas Herald l i s t e d Dr. G i l b e r t as one of the c i t i z e n s of the county
authorized t o c o l l e c t the names of persons who were the dependents of o f f i c e r s and
c h i l d r e n , and thus were e n t i t l e d t o buy cotton cards at the s t a t e p r i c e . This was
part of a campaign t o encourage the production of c l o t h through carding cotton by
hand.
I n 1866, Dr. G i l b e r t was elected J u s t i c e of the Peace i n Precinct 4 and i n
1874 he was named a school board t r u s t e e w i t h i n the Precinct. That same year he
sold a r i g h t of way through h i s property t o the Dallas and Wichita Railroad ( l a t e r
p a r t of the Missouri-Texas system) f o r one d o l l a r . I n 1885 he purchased one of the
f i r s t l o t s of Farmers Branch a t the corner of Main Street and P a c i f i c Avenue.
The G i l b e r t s had two daughters, Mary (Mrs. B. W.) Langley and I s a b e l l G i l b e r t
Lenthicum Hughes, who w i t h her second husband W i l l i a m acquired the homestead a f t e r
Dr. G i l b e r t ' s death i n 1890. " B e l l e " Hughes died i n 1925; the property was sold t o
Roy McKee and W i l l i a m Dodson i n 1929.
McKee and h i s w i f e Wynona remodeled and added t o the G i l b e r t Homestead i n
1939. The dogtrot was glazed i n and a p o r t i o n of one i n t e r i o r w a l l removed. A rear
wing was added t o the west of the house t o provide four bedrooms and baths and a
two-car garage. The a r c h i t e c t i s not known, but the a d d i t i o n was designed i n a
pleasant, r a t h e r picturesque mode popularized i n Dallas by a r c h i t e c t s Charles
D i l l b e c k , O'Neil Ford and others. While very d i f f e r e n t from the o r i g i n a l design
concept, i t blends w e l l and has an i n t e g r i t y of i t s own. The McKees sold the
property i n 1952. I t changed hands twice more, and i n 1981 was acquired by the C i t y
of Farmers Branch as p a r t of i t s Farmers Branch H i s t o r i c a l Park.
Farmers Branch has r e c e n t l y grown from a sleepy, country town w i t h a 1950
population of 915 i n t o a prosperous Dallas suburban w i t h an estimated 29,410
inhabitants i n 1986. The northern t h i r d of Dallas County, arguably one of the
f a s t e s t growing areas i n the United States i n recent decades, has very few 19th
Century b u i l d i n g s of any s o r t , and the a n t i q u i t y and s i g n i f i c a n c e of the G i l b e r t
Homestead f o r t u n a t e l y was f u l l y appreciated by both the c i t y administrators and the
people of Farmers Branch.

Accordingly, the main block of the G i l b e r t Homestead was restored as
accurately as possible, using primary sources, o r a l h i s t o r i e s and s t r u c t u r a l
evidence. The dogtrot i n f i l l was removed and i t s e a r l y c o n f i g u r a t i o n restored. The
rear wing added by the McKees was considered compatible and r e h a b i l i t a t e d f o r
operational purposes, but i t s easternmost room was converted i n t o a breezeway as a
means of separating i t from the main block. The house i s now a successful h i s t o r i c house museum and a source of p r i d e t o the people of Farmers Branch and Dallas
County.
The G i l b e r t Homestead i s also proven t o be a r c h a e o l o g i c a l l y s i g n i f i c a n t . I t
was v i s i t e d by h i s t o r i c a l archaeologist Randall Moir of the Southern Methodist
U n i v e r s i t y I n s t i t u t e f o r the Study of Earth and Man; Moir i s also a member of the
Texas State Board of Review. Moir observed
The house stands on i t s o r i g i n a l house l o t and has
a comparatively i n t a c t archaeological yardscape cont a i n i n g a r t i f a c t s , archaeological features, sheet
refuse, and l o c a l i z e d yard middens based on v i s i b l e
remains observed i n September, 1987. A r t i f a c t s noted
during a walk over of the 2.2 acre house l o t ranged
from the 1850s t o the 1930s. Surface remains included
a l i g h t s c a t t e r of a r t i f a c t s dating from Dr. G i l b e r t ' s
f i r s t two decades of occupation and provide m a t e r i a l
support f o r s u b s t a n t i a l buried sheet refuse and d i s c r e t e
features, should archaeological excavations be conducted.
Surface evidence suggested large p o r t i o n s of 19th Century
yardscape have remained unaltered and have considerable
p o t e n t i a l f o r high i n t e g r i t y . These deposits o f f e r an
important h i s t o r i c a l asset f o r f u r t h e r developing the
s i t e and can provide t a n g i b l e evidence of some of the
G i l b e r t s ' household possessions (e.g. ceramic and glass
vessels, c l o t h i n g p a r t s , consumable goods and food s t u f f s ,
personal and l e i s u r e items, e t c . ) , foodways ( f a u n a l consumpt i o n and packaged foods), yardscape layout ( o u t b u i l d i n g s ,
fences, pathways, e t c . ) and c e r t a i n outdoor a c t i v i t i e s (work
areas, refuse areas, animal pens, w e l l s , e t c . ) Consequently,
the absence of major or broad scale disturbance of large
portions of the yard, couple w i t h the strong surface evidence
of i n t a c t yard deposits and l o c a l i z e d yard middens, make the
archaeological component of the G i l b e r t s i t e an important
h i s t o r i c a l asset r e q u i r i n g r e c o g n i t i o n , p r o t e c t i o n , and
eventually p r o f e s s i o n a l development. [Moir t o Maxson]

Dear Carol:
Enclosed i s the National Register nomination f o r the Samuel and
J u l i a G i l b e r t House i n Farmers Branch, Dallas County, Texas.
Because o f the necessity o f j u s t i f y i n g every Area o f Significance
claimed and d i f f i c u l t y w i t h archaeological nominations i n the past,
our i n c l i n a t i o n was t o sidestep H i s t o r i c Archaeology as an Area
i n t h i s nomination. But State Board o f Review member Randall Moir
Southern Methodist U n i v e r s i t y took an i n t e r e s t i n t h i s nomination.
He has attended John Knoerl's nomination workshops, and f o r the
G i l b e r t Homestead has come up w i t h what we hope i s an acceptable
l e v e l o f documentation t o include H i s t o r i c Archaeology. I f you concur,
we would l i k e t o nominate s i m i l a r p r o p e r t i e s i n the f u t u r e using
roughly the same format.
Accordingly, we request t h a t the nomination be i n t e n s i v e l y reviewed.
I f you do not f e e l an adequate case has been made f o r H i s t o r i c Archaeology, we would ask t h a t t h a t Area be deleted. We would appreciate
you sending us copies o f the Reviewer's Comments e i t h e r way.
Thank you very much f o r your consideration, and l e t us know i f you have
any questions.
Regards,
