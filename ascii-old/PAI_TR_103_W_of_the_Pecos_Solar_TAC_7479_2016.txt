abstract
In November and December 2015, personnel with Prewitt and Associates, Inc., conducted
a Phase I archeological survey of the proposed 716-acre West of the Pecos Solar Project area in
northern Reeves County, Texas. The survey resulted in the identification of six previously unrecorded
archeological sites. The four Native American sites are an open campsite (41RV87) and three open
campsites and lithic procurement localities (41RV89, 41RV90, and 41RV91) characterized by stone
hearth remnants and sparse scatters of chipped stone and occasional ground or battered stone
artifacts. No temporally diagnostic artifacts were identified at these sites. The two twentieth-century
historic sites are a work camp or staging area and adjacent water control feature (41RV88) and a
roadway with adjacent utility pole remnants (41RV92). All six sites have no potential to contain
important information and are considered ineligible for designation as State Antiquities Landmarks
(13 TAC 26.2, 8).
No diagnostic Native American artifacts were found, and the few diagnostic historic artifacts
at 41RV88 were not collected, so the project resulted in no artifacts that will be curated. The records
generated by the project are curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory of the University
of Texas at Austin.

introduction
This report presents the results of a Phase I archeological survey conducted
for West of the Pecos Solar, L.L.C., and Energy Renewal Partners, L.L.C., on two
parcels of range land owned by the State of Texas to be utilized for construction
of the proposed West of the Pecos Solar Project in northern Reeves County, Texas
(Figure 1). These parcels are between U.S. Highway 285 and the Pecos River,
roughly 0.8 km south of County Road 440 and 56 km northwest of the Pecos, Texas.
The west parcel is just east of the highway, has maximum north-south and eastwest dimensions of ca. 1.3 and 1.4 km, and encompasses 344 acres. The east parcel
is along the valley margin, has maximum north-south and east-west dimensions
of ca. 1.3 and 1.6 km, and encompasses 372 acres. The horizontal area of potential
effects for this project consists of 716 acres of land controlled by the Texas General
Land Office. Fieldwork was conducted in November and December 2015 under
Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7479 to satisfy the requirements of the Antiquities
Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resources Code of 1977, Title 9, Chapter 191, as
amended). Six archeological sites identified during this effort (41RV87â41RV92)
are evaluated for designation as State Antiquities Landmarks under the âRules of
Practice and Procedure for the Antiquities Code of Texasâ (Texas Administrative
Code, Title 13, Part IV, Chapter 26). No federal funds or permitting were involved
in this project.
Specific development plans for the two parcels are not yet available, but it is
anticipated that both tracts will be impacted by the construction of various kinds of
improvements typical for a solar electric generating facility, including solar panels
and their mounting systems; underground conduit, communication cables, and
electrical collection system wiring; multiple combiner boxes; one or more substations;
inverter boxes on concrete or gravel pads; an operations and maintenance facility; a
telephone system; and access and service roads. It is anticipated that many impacts
will extend to a depth of 4 ft or less, but the support pilings for the solar panels will
be 6â12 ft deep.
Environmental Setting
The project area is in the northeastern portion of the Chihuahuan Desert
on the east edge of the Texas Trans-Pecos Region, broadly referred to as the TransPecos Basin and Range physiographic province. The lower-elevation terrain in
the eastern third of the Trans-Pecosâstretching between the Pecos River and a
series of northwest-southeast mountain ranges to the westâis physiographically
distinct from the rest of the province and includes the dissected Stockton Plateau
to the south and the broad, arid Toyah and Delaware basins to the north. Surface
topography in the low-lying sediment-filled basins is characterized by nearly level
to gently sloping or undulating gravelly plains with occasional low hills, playas,
salt flats, sand sheets, and dune fields. This terrain is incised by drainages that
flow into the Pecos River. The dissected west valley wall of the Pecos is defined by
gradually to moderately sloping landforms and low bluffs in some areas (Griffith et
al. 2004; Mallouf 1985; McMahan et al. 1984; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004; Richardson

1905). The project area is 1.3â5.9 km west of the Pecos River. Named Pecos River
tributaries in the vicinity include Sand Bend Draw 0.8 km to the northwest and
Fourmile Draw 3.7 km to the southeast.
Geology and Geomorphology
The project area is in a segment of the Pecos River valley that formed
through large-scale solution-subsidence associated with the dissolution of Permian
evaporites of the Delaware basin, channel incision and migration, and valley slope
retreat starting in the Miocene and continuing to the present (Bretz and Horberg
1949; Hawley 1993). Throughout this period, this segment of the valley filled with
clastic sediments, locally up to 580 m thick, primarily derived from erosion of uplifted
highlands to the west (Hawley 1993:266).
A portion of this valley fill is known as the GatuÃ±a Formation, which the
Pecos River incises and flows on along its course from the New Mexico-Texas state
line to Pecos, Texas (Kelley 1980:216). Outcrops of the GatuÃ±a Formation form
discontinuous low bluffs primarily along the east side of this segment of the Pecos
River (Bureau of Economic Geology 1976; Kelley 1980:213). They also occur along
Fourmile Draw just south of the project area. The formation consists of fine- and
coarse-grained alluvial and eolian deposits capped by well-developed calcretes
(Hawley 1993; Kelley 1980). These deposits rest on Permian, Triassic, and Cretaceous
rocks (Kelley 1980:213) and thus represent the initial filling of the Pecos River valley
after maximum erosion (Lang 1938:84â85). Initially described by Lang (1938:84â85)
as âan assemblage of rocks of various kinds that were laid down in the Pecos Valley
in post-High Plains [Ogallala Formation] time,â there currently is no consensus on
the age of the GatuÃ±a Formation. It is at least Pliocene to middle Pleistocene in age
(Bachman 1976, 1980, 1981; Lang 1938; Vine 1963), although basal deposits could
be as old as late Miocene and correlative to the Ogallala Formation (Kelley 1980;
Reeves 1972). The lack of consensus on the age of the GatuÃ±a Formation largely
relates to the lack of detailed mapping, subsurface control, and identification of
contacts between the GatuÃ±a and Ogallala Formations and correlative units (Hawley
1993:264; Kelley 1980).
Outside exposures along Fourmile Draw and the Pecos River, late Quaternary
alluvial and eolian deposits bury much of the GatuÃ±a Formation in and around the
project area. These overlying deposits are mapped as âOther Quaternaryâ (Qao) and
âHolocene alluviumâ (Qal) (Bureau of Economic Geology 1976) and together form a
broad two-tiered landscape with an overall eastward-dipping surface in the project
area that stands 15 to 40 m above the Pecos River channel.
The Qao deposits form the higher of the two surfaces and are more prevalent
south of the project area. These deposits consist of fine-grained sediments and an
array of small subrounded to rounded sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous
gravels exhibiting coats of secondary carbonate. The gravels often appear as a lag
on the higher surface due to millennia of eolian deflation. The highly dissected
nature of the Qao deposits, along with the stage II carbonate morphology, suggest

4

a late Pleistocene age. The lack of carbonate rocks in the gravel assemblage, rock
types that are prevalent throughout the basin, also testify to the great antiquity of
the deposits mapped as Qao. The presence of metamorphic and igneous gravels in
these deposits indicates that the sources of these materials are not the Delaware and
Guadalupe Mountains ca. 80â90 km to the west, as these ranges and their flanking
foothills consist of Permian evaporites, carbonate rocks, sandstones, and mudstones
(Bureau of Economic Geology 1976). The nearest upstream source of igneous and
metamorphic rocks in the basin is in the northern Sacramento Mountains of New
Mexico some 240 km northwest of the project area (New Mexico Geological Society
1982). Hence, the deposits forming the higher surface most likely represent a
highly dissected alluvial terrace of the Pecos River that is tens of thousands if not
100,000 years old and that is unrelated to the current eastward-flowing network of
intermittent streams that drain the broad pediplain west of the river and eastern
slopes of the Delaware and Guadalupe Mountains. While Qao gravels are typically
small to medium-sized pebbles, these locally available raw materials were utilized
for the production of chipped and ground stone tools.
Surfaces in areas mapped as Qal or Holocene alluvium are generally one to
a few meters lower than the surfaces of Qao deposits. Qal deposits predominately
consist of sands and silts delivered by a network of eastward-flowing intermittent
streams and unconfined surface flow that have coalesced into a widespread sandy
to silty outwash plain mantling much of the broad pediplain west of the Pecos
River. Qal surfaces are extensively modified by sheetwash and eolian processes as
evidenced by sheets of alluvial sediments and coppice dunes. Geologic processes
and bioturbation have incorporated small pebbles into the Qal deposits from nearby
higher Qao deposit surfaces.
Soils
Although the Qao and Qal deposits differ in age and lithology, their mapped
distributions show little spatial correlation with the distributions of the three soil
associations mapped in the project area (Bureau of Economic Geology 1976; Jaco
1980; Soilweb Earth 2015). The soil series in these associations are Aridisols or
Entisols, and many display calcic and gypsic horizons. Nearly level Monahans
association and Reakor association soils are depicted across most of the project
area, and both associations overlap Qao and Qal deposits. Monahans and Reakor
soils are nearly level to gently sloping, very deep, and well drained. Monahans soils
consist of thin surface veneers of fine sandy loam over basal zones of fine sandy loam
and sandy clay loam; they formed in ancient alluvium with high levels of gypsum
and calcium carbonate and are found on upland plains and fan skirts on upland
piedmonts. Reakor soils consist of thin surface veneers of loam over basal zones of
heavy loam and clay loam; they formed in loamy alluvium derived from limestone and
small amounts of eolian material and are found on broad uplands and alluvial fans.
The extent of the nearly level Hoban-Reeves-Holloman association mapped
across the northern part of the west parcel loosely correlates with the distribution
of Qal deposits there. These soils are nearly level to very gently sloping and range
from very shallow to very deep. Hoban soils have moderately thick surface layers

5

of silty clay loam over basal zones of calcareous silty clay loam; they formed in
calcareous loamy and clayey alluvium on broad valleys, alluvial outwash plains,
and broad basins. Reeves soils have shallow loamy surface layers over basal zones
of calcareous and gypsiferous clay loam; they formed in fine-textured alluvium
derived from gypsum beds and are found on basin floors, hill slopes, and plateaus.
Holloman soils have shallow and very shallow loamy surface layers over basal
zones of calcareous and gypsiferous loam and interbedded gypsum and calcium
carbonate; they formed in loamy, calcareous, and gypsiferous sediments and are
found on basins, valley floors, and adjacent terraces (U.S. Department of Agriculture,
Natural Resources Conservation Service 2015).
Climate
The climate of the project area is considered semiarid with hot summers and
cool winters, prevailing winds from the south-southwest, high evaporation rates, and
an average annual rainfall of 9.1 inches. Springs are typically dry and windy. The
heaviest rainfall is derived from localized, high-intensity thunderstorms that occur
during a southwestern monsoonal pattern rainy season that usually starts in July
and ends in September. Snowfall is rare, generally light, and typically short lived
at lower elevations. Temperatures can be widely variable and seasonally extreme.
Mean monthly temperatures in the vicinity can range from 27ÂºF in January to
97ÂºF in July, with documented extremes of 9ÂºF and 118ÂºF (Bryan 2002; Miller and
Kenmotsu 2004; El-Hage and Moulton 1998; Jaco 1980).
Biota
The project area is in the Chihuahuan Basins and Playas subregion of the
Chihuahuan Desert ecological region (Griffith et al. 2004). The mapped vegetative
regime west of the Pecos River consists of Creosotebush-Tarbush Shrub. Aside
from creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) and tarbush (Flourensia cernua), commonly
associated plants include mesquite, whitethorn acacia, catclaw, fourwing saltbush,
false broomweed, range ratany, jimmyweed, sotol, cholla, lechuguilla, alkali sacaton,
chino grama, and gyp grama. The historic riparian habitats of native cottonwoods,
willows, and grasses that once lined the Pecos River have been infiltrated or largely
replaced by mesquite and invasive species like salt cedar, Australian saltbush,
Russian thistle, Bermuda grass, and Johnsongrass. These modern vegetative
regimes are believed to be primarily a result of livestock overgrazing and periods
of drought during the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Native plants that
would have been important resources for Native Americans in the region include
honey and screwbean mesquite, sotol, agave, yucca, prickly pear, and other species
of cacti (El-Hage and Moulton 1998; Frye et al. 1984; McMahan et al. 1984; Miller
and Kenmotsu 2004).
The project area is in the eastern portion of the Chihuahuan biotic province
of Texas, which has greater faunal diversity than any other biotic province in
the state due in part to its physiographic variability. Blair (1950:107, 108) notes
the occurrence of 83 mammal species in recent times, together with 38 species of
snakes, 22 lizard species, 1 land turtle, and 14 species of amphibians. A total of

6

244 nesting bird species have been documented in the various environmental regimes
of Trans-Pecos Texas (Bryan 2002). Extirpated and extant faunal resources found
in the desert basins and grasslands include bison, mule deer, pronghorn antelope,
black-tailed jackrabbit, desert cottontail, wild turkey, and various rodents, reptiles,
and fish (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).
Archeological background
Evidence of Native American occupation in the Trans-Pecos region extends
back nearly 12,000 years and continues up into the 1800s. This section presents
a brief summary of indigenous utilization of the region with specific focus on the
eastern Trans-Pecos to provide context for the Native American sites identified during
the survey. The cultural history sequence used here is based largely on a temporal
framework of the Trans-Pecos presented by Miller and Kenmotsu (2004:205â265) and
Mallouf (1985). Additional sources of information include Perttula (2004), Turner et al.
(2011), and information presented in the Trans Pecos Mountain & Basins exhibit on
the Texas Beyond History web site (www.texasbeyondhistory.net/trans-p/index/html).
The Paleoindian period (10,000â6,500 b.c.) has frequently been characterized
as having low-density populations of small, highly mobile bands of foragers who
were specialized hunters of Pleistocene megafauna. This oversimplified view has
given way to consideration of a Paleoindian way of life that utilized a wider array
of resources. Accurate understanding of this time period is hindered by a scarcity
of isolable Paleoindian components and an absence of chronometric dates from
unquestionable contexts. Identification of Paleoindian remains is typically dependent
on the presence of known projectile point styles and other diagnostic tool forms, and
thus it is possible that many archeological deposits dating to this time period are
unrecognized. A sequential cultural sequence established in surrounding regionsâ
the Clovis, Folsom, and Plano/Cody Complexesâhas been applied to the Paleoindian
period in the Trans-Pecos (Kenmotsu and Miller 2014:212, 213; Mallouf 1985:95â98).
Isolated projectile points have been reported in the Guadalupe Mountains to the
west-northwest and on the Stockton Plateau well to the southeast (Boisvert 1980;
Katz 1978; Sommer 1974), but only a few habitation sites have been identified in
the vicinity of the project area, and these are technically outside the Trans-Pecos
physiographic province. Site 41LV3, an open campsite about 14 km east-northeast
of the project area, included a Folsom point fragment and several channel flakes
mixed with later Archaic artifacts in moderately thick eolian deposits (Ackerly et
al. 1987). The Shifting Sands site (41WK21), roughly 90 km to the east-northeast,
is a Folsom-Midland campsite dating to the early and middle Paleoindian period
(Hoffman et al. 1990).
The Archaic period (6,500 b.c.âa.d. 200/900) encompasses thousands of
years of seasonally mobile, broad-spectrum hunter-gatherer subsistence strategies
and settlement adaptations in an increasingly arid environment. Archeological
data from rockshelters and open-air sites indicate that this period saw increased
populations and associated restrictions in range and mobility, seasonally driven
land use patterns and land use intensification in an increasing diversity of
environmental zones, increased diversification and intensification in use of plant

7

resources and plant processing, and changes in subsistence technologies. The first
archeological evidence for the widespread use of rocks and caliche in thermal features
and habitation structures dates to the first half of the Archaic period. Cultigens
appeared in the archeological record between 1500 and 1000 b.c. in the western
Trans-Pecos. The available substantive archeological data varies considerably
across this lengthy span of time, and temporal subdivisions are primarily based
on projectile point typologies and sequences developed in surrounding regions. The
subsistence practices, settlement patterns, and group mobility strategies established
and reinforced during the Late Archaic were affected by a series of cultural changes
starting around a.d. 200 in the western Trans-Pecos, whereas a traditional Archaic
way of life persisted until at least a.d. 900 across most of the eastern part of the
region (Mallouf 1985; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). A few archeological sites with
Archaic components in the eastern Trans-Pecos include the Phantom Springs site
(41JD63 [Charles 1994]), the Ramâs Head site (41PC35 [Young 1982]), Shelby Brooks
Cave (41CU7 [Ward 1992]), and Granado Cave (41CU8 [Hamilton 2001]).
The following period of prehistory is marked by distinct differences in
subsistence strategies and settlement adaptations in the western and eastern TransPecos. This span of time is referred to as the Formative period (a.d. 200â1450) in
the west and the Late Prehistoric period (a.d. 900â1450) in the east. The Formative
period saw a relatively rapid series of changes in subsistence, technology, settlement
structure and mobility, land use, and architectural form. Increased reliance on
cultigens climaxed with sedentary Puebloan farmers around a.d. 1250â1450.
Significant technological developments include the adoption of ceramics and the bow
and arrow, changes in chipped stone and ground stone technologies, changes in use
of thermal features, and increased prevalence of formal storage features. Many of
the changes in the west do not appear in the archeological record in the east until
a.d. 1000. Aside from universal adoption of the bow and arrow in the eastern TransPecos, many of the other changes in the west were variously adopted by indigenous
groups in the east. Rather, the archeological record indicates a persistence of Late
Archaic subsistence practices, settlement patterns, and mobility strategies across
most of the eastern Trans-Pecos during this time (Mallouf 1985; Miller and Kenmotsu
2004:236â238, 255â258; Riggs 2014).
The presence of cultigens, ceramics, and nonlocal lithic materials and
shells at sites in the east indicates interaction with populations to the west and
southwest, and in some instances, sufficient knowledge of new subsistence practices
and technologies for local production (Hamilton 2001; Hedrick 1989; Hines et al.
1994; Jackson 1937; Roney 1995; Schroeder 1983; Smith 1938). Exceptions to this
general pattern in the eastern Trans-Pecos are found in the La Junta district in the
Presidio Bolson along the Rio Grande around modern-day Presidio, Texas, and in the
Salt Flat Basin on the west side of the Guadalupe and Delaware Mountains. Native
American populations in these areas lived in sedentary and semisedentary villages,
manufactured ceramics, and cultivated crops (Miller and Kenmostsu 2004; Riggs
2014). Diagnostic Late Prehistoric arrow point types for the eastern Trans-Pecos
include Livermore, Toyah, Perdiz, Fresno, and the recently defined Diablo, Means,
and Alazan types (Mallouf 2012, 2013; Riggs 2014; Turner et al. 2011).

8

The Cielo Complex (a.d. 1300â1680) encompasses a settlement pattern and
material culture that are not found together outside the Big Bend region of the
eastern Trans-Pecos, northeastern Chihuahua, and northwestern Coahuila (Miller
and Kenmostu 2004). Mallouf (1985) defined the complex and suggests it could be
the remains of one or more indigenous hunter-gather groups perhaps ancestral
to the protohistoric and historic Jumano (Mallouf 1999). This manifestation is
characterized by oval to circular stone-based, wikiup-type structure remnants on
elevated, easily defended landforms, the absence of ceramics, predominance of the
Perdiz arrow point style (with Garza and Soto points appearing later), and use of
blades, blade drills, formal end scrapers, beveled knives, and prismatic blade cores.
Turquoise and shell ornaments have been recovered at some Cielo Complex sites
(Mallouf 1999; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004; Riggs 2014).
The archeological record suggests that regional reorganization and
abandonment of the Puebloan system occurred in the western Trans-Pecos after
a.d. 1450, although similar agricultural groups in the east appear to have been
little affected by the events that led to that cultural collapse. The majority of
eastern Trans-Pecos residents continued to follow well-established hunter-gatherer
lifestyles throughout the Protohistoric period (a.d. 1535â1700) and into the Historic
era (after a.d. 1700). The centuries after the collapse of the Puebloan system saw
the first Spanish entradas in the sixteenth century and intrusion of Athabascan
speakers from the north. These interactions precipitated a breakdown of traditional
subsistence and settlement practices and material culture, cultural assimilation,
and eventual extirpation of the distinct indigenous cultural groups that traditionally
inhabited the Trans-Pecos region (Cloud 2004; Mallouf 1999; Miller and Kenmotsu
2004; Riggs 2014). Spanish settlement gave way to successive periods of Mexican,
Euro-American, and American settlement and land use in the region.
historical background
This summary of Reeves County history is largely specific to the project area
and provides a general context for the historic archeological sites identified during
the survey. The first ranchers herded cattle onto open range in the northern part of
Reeves County in 1885, and ranching remained a key focus of the area economy into
the twentieth century. Settlement in the vicinity of the project area was encouraged
by construction of the Pecos River Railroad in 1890 on land patented by the Texas
and Pacific Railway company in the 1870s. The 54-mile-long railroad extended north
from the town of Pecos to the state line on the west side of the Pecos River and
facilitated the transport of local agricultural products. Now the Atchison, Topeka,
and Santa Fe Railroad, this line passes east of the project area.
The community of Orla, at the intersection of U.S. Highway 285 and County
Road 652 about 5 km north of the project area, was established as a section house on
the railroad line in 1890, and a post office was opened there in 1906. U.S. Highway
285, which passes just west of the project area, was commissioned along its present
route from Sanderson, Texas, in 1936. Orla grew steadily in the first half of the
twentieth century, reaching its zenith as a rural oil supply center with a population
of 250 in the 1960s. The small town still has a post office and continues to serve as

9

a busy hub for nearby oil and gas production (Smith 2010a, 2010b; Texas General
Land Office 2015).
Area ranching and farming were impacted by restrictions on public use
of state-owned land in 1900, but state-sanctioned sale of school-owned land at
generous terms to the buyer over the next five years prompted an influx of new
settlers to Reeves County and other parts of west Texas. Many new residents left
the area during a 1916 drought, however. The drought and the Great Depression
of the 1930s had a negative impact on agricultural production and increased farm
tenancy in the area. Livestock production dominated the agricultural industry by
1940 but was overtaken by crop production in the 1950s; the values of the two sides
of the agricultural industry consistently traded places through time according to
variations in the national market (Smith 2010b).
Local oil exploration in the Delaware basin in the 1920s, the discovery of
the Ford Geraldine oil field northeast of Orla in 1956, and the development of three
oilfields in the 1970s (Athens, Chapman Deep, and San Martine) each served to boost
the Reeves County population and economy, at least temporarily. Oil development in
the 1970s preceded the significant west Texas oil boom of the 1980s (Smith 2010b).
The Ford Geraldine field northwest of the project area remains an important locus
for oil and gas production.
previous investigations
Review of the Texas Historical Commissionâs Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
in November 2015 revealed eight archeological investigations and 15 previously
recorded archeological sites within 25 km of the project area (Tables 1 and 2).
A. T. Jackson (1938) from the University of Texas at Austin conducted the earliest
documented archeological investigation as part of a larger regional investigation
in the 1930s. Most of the subsequent investigations were spurred by development
in the oil and gas industries. The segment of the All American Pipeline corridor
that passes less than 1 km north of the project area was surveyed in the mid 1980s
(Plog et al. 1989). Most of the investigations associated with the energy industry are
small, localized linear or area surveys conducted in the last three years (Carlson
and Walborn 2014; Dowling and Justen 2013; McCormack and Boggess 2013; Walth
et al. 2015). Other recent projects include surveys of a proposed cell tower facility
(Turner 2013), and for proposed road improvements north and south of the town
of Mentone (Dayton 2014).
The list of previously documented sites within 25 km of the project area is
nearly evenly split between Reeves and Loving Counties on either side of the Pecos
River. Jackson (1938) recorded Petroglyph Site 190 (41LV1), a small rockshelter with
petroglyphs, in the 1930s. The site is now at the east edge of Red Bluff Reservoir.
The remaining 13 archeological sites with prehistoric components consist
of 4 lithic procurement localities with scatters of chipped stone artifacts (including
the closest site to the project area, 41RV16), 2 lithic procurement localities and open
campsites, and 7 open campsites. All of these primarily consist of scatters of chipped
stone artifacts. The distinction between open campsites and lithic procurement

sites in this sample is typically based on the presence of burned rocks or ground
stone artifacts. Five campsites (41LV4, 41RV14, 41RV17, 41RV49, and 41RV58)
contained rock hearths, possible hearths, or scattered burned rocks. Aside from
prehistoric ceramics at 41LV2, projectile points serve as the diagnostic artifacts
at the 5 sites with broadly definable prehistoric temporal components. Identifiable
prehistoric components in this sample range from Paleoindian (Folsom point at
41LV3) to Late Prehistoric/Late Formative. One lithic procurement site (41LV7) is
overlain by a historic/modern trash dump, and 1 prehistoric campsite (41RV17) is
also the location of an early-twentieth-century ranch habitation or camp. The final
site in the study area (41LV21) is a twentieth-century gypsum mining locality with
structural remains and debris potentially derived from habitation.

methods of investigation
Prefield Review
In addition to consulting pertinent geology and soils maps and review of
information on the Texas Historical Commissionâs Archeological Sites Atlas, prefield
investigations included examination of the most recent topographic quadrangle
for the project area (U.S. Geological Survey 1961), modern aerial photographs
(Texas Orthoimagery Program 1996, 2008, 2015), Google Earth satellite imagery,
and relevant information available on the Texas State Historical Associationâs
Handbook of Texas Online. The Atlas review indicated that prehistoric sites could
be expected on nearly level to gently sloping uplands and desert floors, on top of
and along the footslopes of elevated topographic features and valley walls, and on
areas of lower relief with dunes that may harbor greater floral diversity, as long
as water is reasonably accessible. Aside from the perennial Pecos River just east
of the project area, locally available water sources could consist of one or more of
the following at different times of the year: springs, intermittent tributaries, shortlived water impoundments along ephemeral wet-weather surface drainages, and
rainwater catchments in interdunal blowouts. Given the proximity of the Pecos
River and several intermittent tributaries and the presence of a number of smaller
surface drainages, prefield review suggested that prehistoric sites could be present
anywhere in the project area with the greatest potential along the valley margin
overlooking tributaries in the east parcel. The age of the subsurface geology and
characteristics of the mapped soils indicated any prehistoric archeological deposits
in the project area would be at or near the modern surface or suspended within thin
dune deposits, and thus potentially susceptible to occupational overprinting and
natural processes like deflation and dune movement.
Review of Google Earth satellite imagery and modern aerial photographs
showed some subsurface pipeline alignments, a cell tower facility, and occasional
dirt roads in the area, but the extents of these disturbances were limited. A
prominent track that crosses the west parcel is depicted as a road on Google Earth
and is mapped as an improved light-duty road on the 1961 topographic quadrangle.
Subsequent review identified the same roadway on a 1940 Reeves County highway
map (see 41RV92 description below; Texas State Highway Department 1940). No
buildings or other structures are depicted along the road within the project area
on the quadrangle or the earlier highway map. Visible stock tanks, feed troughs,
and trails in and adjacent to the area confirmed that the property still served as
range land for stock grazing, but no indications of modern or historic farming were
evident. The distance of most of the project area from clearly reliable sources of
water and major roadways and evidence of limited development within it suggested
the potential for historic archeological sites was low.
Field Survey
Archeological fieldwork was conducted by a team of three archeologists who
completed pedestrian survey of the 716-acre project area in NovemberâDecember
2015. Excluding travel time, the survey required 15 person-days of effort, for an

14

average survey rate of 48 acres per person-day. Survey transects typically ran
north-south along Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) easting coordinate lines,
since geodetic (true) north, grid north, and the north-south alignments of the survey
parcels all varied by less than a degree in this location and the vegetation offered
no physical obstruction to survey. Survey transects were generally spaced 30 m
apart (sometimes less) due to typically excellent surface visibility, and transect
spacing was maintained with hand-held Garmin GPS units. Survey included careful
visual inspection of sparsely vegetated surfaces, animal backdirt piles, two-track
roads, pipeline corridors, and other disturbances. Shovel tests were not excavated
outside identified archeological sites due to excellent ground surface visibility
(40â100 percent) on landforms that had little to no potential for buried archeological
deposits because of their ancient age and limited Holocene deposition. Likewise,
superior surface visibility at the documented archeological sites allowed for clear
site delineation without shovel testing. Seven shovel tests and one shovel probe
were excavated at the four documented prehistoric sites to assess local sediments
and check the potential for subsurface deposits. These tests confirmed that the
archeological remains are largely restricted to the surface.
Shovel tests were approximately 30 cm in diameter and excavated in
arbitrary 20-cm levels when sediments allowed. Most tests were excavated to depths
where steadily increasing secondary carbonate or gypsum or increasing carbonatecoated gravels were encountered. One test was excavated to a layer of sandy clay
loam with prevalent carbonate flecks. Test depths varied from 60 to 85 cm below
the surface. Removed sediments were screened through 1/4-inch-mesh hardware
cloth and inspected for archeological materials. Shovel Test Record Forms were used
to record brief sediment descriptions, test depths, and recovery. None of the tests
revealed subsurface artifacts. The one shovel probe (also about 30 cm in diameter)
exposed tightly packed gravels below a 15-cm-thick mantle of surface sediments.
The removed sediment was visually inspected for artifacts but was not screened.
The locations of isolated surface artifacts, artifact scatters, and prehistoric
features encountered were recorded with hand-held GPS units and revisited for
additional evaluation and documentation after survey of a particular parcel was
completed. Instances of one or a few adjacent artifacts were documented but not
recorded as archeological sites. Aside from the documented historic road segment,
site definition was loosely based on the occurrence of five or more artifacts or one
or more features within a 20-m-diameter area. In every instance, site boundaries
were defined by the extents of artifact scatters or the distribution of features on
the surface. While one prehistoric site (41RV87) clearly extends outside the project
area and another (41RV91) may, no effort was made to delineate the full extents
of these sites outside the project boundaries. The documented segment of historic
roadway 41RV92, which extends well beyond the limits of the west survey parcel,
marks the length of the track traversed during survey.
All archeological features were photographed, and the horizontal and vertical
dimensions were recorded for each. Additional descriptive information such as clast
count and composition and overall feature integrity were noted as well. This survey
was conducted under a limited-collection policy in which only temporally diagnostic

15

artifacts (dart points, arrow points, prehistoric ceramics, and diagnostic historic
artifacts) would be retained for curation. No temporally diagnostic prehistoric
artifacts were found, however, and a handful of diagnostic very late historic artifacts
observed at 41RV88 were described but not collected.
The locations of shovel tests and the one shovel probe, archeological features,
some specific artifacts, and the outside edges of artifact scatters were recorded with
hand-held Garmin Etrex GPS units. Garmin points and tracks were uploaded to
Google Earth daily to back up the points data and to check survey area coverage.
Site-related points were plotted on survey block map sheets bearing (UTM) grid
intersects and coordinates. GPS data were later converted to shape files to display
the various spatial data within a geographic information system (GIS) environment,
which allowed the overlay of spatial information onto digitized project maps at the
end of survey.

Project Area Description
West Parcel
Most of the west parcel is a nearly level to gently sloping upland alluvial
outwash plain that drops gradually from southwest to northeast. Surface elevations
mostly range from 2,855 to 2,825 ft. The only notable landform is the west end of
a 3â4-m-high gravelly ridge at the southeast corner of the tract that probably is a
segment of a relict Pecos River alluvial terrace (Figure 2). This feature, which is not
depicted on the most recent topographic quadrangle, has an estimated maximum
surface elevation of 2,860 ft.
Figure 2

Figure 2. View southeast across 41RV87 on gently sloping alluvial outwash plain toward low gravelly ridge at the
southeast corner of the west survey parcel.

16

Surfaces across much of the west parcel have been impacted by eolian
deflation and to a lesser degree sheetwash and channelized flow. Carbonates are
exposed at the surface in the central portion of the parcel, and animal backdirt piles
indicate calcic horizons are only a few centimeters below the surface in much of the
surrounding area. Fields of low, vegetation-stabilized coppice dunes and adjacent
sand sheets are present in the western and southern parts of the tract (Figure 3).
The dunes are typically 1 m or less in height, although occasional exceptions are
1.5 m tall. Low dune fields flank what appear to be two wide, shallow, ephemeral
surface drainages that trend southwest to northeast across the parcel. Likely the
upper reaches of the intermittent Sand Bend Draw tributary depicted north of
the tract on the 1961 topographic quadrangle, these features would be difficult to
recognize on the ground were it not for the belts of denser-than-normal vegetation
that grow along them. Although ephemeral, it is clear from observations at the two
historic sites (see 41RV88 and 41RV92 below) that these drainages are capable of
channeling large volumes of water during periods of heavy rainfall. Also noteworthy
are a series of shallow, oval surface depressions scattered primarily along these two
drainage alignments. These features range from 10 to 130 m across, are typically
less than 50 cm deep, and also serve as magnets for localized vegetation growth.
Similar but smaller surface features are scattered north of the drainages. These
drainage segments flanked by dune fields are essentially depositional interdunal
areas dominated by small-scale aggradational processes derived from intermittent
alluvial sheet flooding and occasional channelized runoff. The oval depressions may
be derived from periodic water impoundment along these channels. Likewise, the
smaller surface depressions away from the drainages may be interdunal blowouts
stabilized by plants, moisture, or both (Waters 1992). Some of these features may
have been enlarged (or perhaps created) through overgrazing during episodic wet
periods over the last 140 years.

Survey identified a number of recent disturbances that are not evident on the
latest Google Earth satellite imagery. An east-west, ca. 25-m-wide subsurface pipeline
corridor now parallels an earlier corridor (which is visible on satellite images), and
both extend through the small rectangular area off the northeast corner of the
tract. A well-built gravel road and adjacent overhead utility line extend south from
the double pipeline corridor, crossing the same part of the survey tract. Occasional
discrete equipment- and vehicle-related surface disturbances may be associated with
drilling test wells (water) and the erection and removal of associated above-ground
tanks, core sampling, or both. Several acres of flat upland plain on the east side of
the parcel were mechanically cleared of desert shrubs and other xeric vegetation
in recent years to foster the growth of forbs and grasses for cattle grazing (Figure
4). Other previously cleared areas (now in various stages of regrowth) are scattered
around the west parcel. Natural disturbances aside from those associated with the
drainages described above are widely scattered and include impacts derived from
stock grazing, animal burrowing (insects, rodents, badgers, and coyotes), predatory
digging (badgers and coyotes), and near-surface root growth.
Figure 4

Figure 4. View north across a mechanically cleared area on the east side of the west survey parcel.

East Parcel
About a mile distant from the west survey parcel, the east parcel encompasses
most of a large interfluve, segments of sloping valley wall, and part of a nearly level
outwash plain. In general, the terrain falls gradually from west to east toward

18

the Pecos River, and surface elevations vary from a high point of 2,829 ft on the
interfluve to 2,785 ft on the valley wall. Most of the parcel consists of the tread and
dissected margins of an ancient Pecos River alluvial terrace (Figure 5). Nearly level
to gently sloping and gently rolling surfaces on the west and north sides of the tract
culminate in a prominent hill characterized by moderately sloping terrain at the
east end of the interfluve. A ridge or bench slopes gradually from the hilltop to the
southeast corner of the parcel. Lower, nearly level terrain along the southern and
eastern edges of the tract consists of younger alluvial outwash deposits around the
toe of the relict terrace.
Figure 5

Figure 5. View north-northeast across the nearly level surface of the relict alluvial terrace at 41RV89. The cell tower on
the right in the distance is on the summit of the interfluve that crosses the north side of the east survey parcel.

Higher surfaces in the west and north halves of the parcel are capped by
sand sheets and low coppice dunes, and these areas have been reworked by wind and
water-derived erosion and limited sedimentation. Surfaces across the lower half of
the bench extending southeast from the interfluve are lightly to severely deflated,
and surfaces on this landform and the interfluve summit have been impacted more
than other areas by channelized surface runoff. The north and south sides of the
interfluve are dissected by a series of shallow, poorly defined drainages and narrow,
slightly incised drainages (all wet-weather features) that trend toward intermittent
Pecos River tributaries north and south of the project area.

19

The northernmost part of the parcel is crossed by the same double pipeline
corridor that impacted the north edge of the west parcel. Installation of a north-south,
ca. 35-m-wide subsurface pipeline across the west side of the parcel destroyed an
unknown portion of 41RV89 (see site description below), and installation of a cell
tower, associated access road, and overhead utility line on the interfluve summit
adversely impacted portions of 41RV91 (Figure 6). Recent surface disturbance in the
northwest quadrant of the tract is associated with installation of a surface water line
(Figure 7). A downed barbed-wire fence crosses 41RV89 in the southwest quadrant,
and acreage on several parts of the terrace in the west side of the parcel has been
mechanically cleared of vegetation at various times in the past. Animal-derived
surface disturbance is more common in the east parcel than in the west. Stock
traffic has pitted large areas in the southwest quadrant and left deeply rutted trails
in some areas. Javelinas have disturbed surfaces across the parcel; these impacts
are rampant over the southern ca. 40 percent of the tract. Animal burrowing and
predatory digging are also widespread, with extensive rodent disturbance in some
areas on the west half of the parcel and on the north half of the low bench that
extends southeast from the interfluve.

Site Descriptions
The survey resulted in the documentation of six previously unrecorded
archeological sites, three in each parcel (Figure 8). Four are Native American
sites (41RV87, 41RV89, 41RV90, and 41RV91), and two are historic sites dating
to the first half of the twentieth century (41RV88 and 41RV91). Several isolated
prehistoric artifacts and one historic artifact found on the surface were not
recorded as sites. Two ground stone fragments (a mano and burned bifaceted
tool fragment) and two burned limestone fragments were found at the foot of a
vegetation-stabilized coppice dune in the west parcel about 200 m west-northwest
of 41RV88. No other artifacts or burned rocks were observed in the vicinity. An
isolated flake was roughly 200 m northeast of the ground stone fragments. Two
widely distributed flakes and a ground stone fragment were found on the flat
alluvial plain 155â200 m north of 41RV87; another isolated flake was observed
nearly 600 m north of the site. In the southwest portion of the west parcel, a flake
and a core were observed 110 m northeast and 240 m north of 41RV89; a uniface
was identified ca. 110 m east-southeast of the site. On the opposite side of the parcel,
a mano/hammerstone and hammerstone were roughly 150 and 300 m southeast
of 41RV91, and fragments of a solarized glass bottle (manganese dioxide-induced
colorless glass) were found 90 m south of the site.

Site 41RV87
Site 41RV87 is an open campsite and lithic procurement locality in
unimproved range land at the southeast corner of the west survey parcel. It is
1.4 km east of U.S. Highway 285, 2.0 km south of County Road 440, and 4.8 km
west-southwest of the closest point along the Pecos River. Surface elevations are
2,860â2,850 ft. The south end of the site includes the west end of a 3â4-m-high
gravelly ridge top that probably is a segment of a relict Pecos River alluvial terrace.
The site extends down slope to the north to include a lower, geologically younger
segment of alluvial outwash plain (Figure 9) The ridge consists of an array of small
rounded to subrounded igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary fluvial gravels and
fine-grained sediments with coats of secondary carbonates. Ridge side slopes are
slightly dissected by shallow gullies and washes, and translocated gravels mantle
the younger, lower surface to the north. Deflated sand sheet or low dune remnants
are present in the northern part of the site.
The nearly level Monahans association and Reakor association soils mapped
at this site do not correspond to localized variations in surface topography (SoilWeb
Earth 2015). Both associations are very deep and well drained fine sandy loam
or loam over clayey substrates. Observed surface sediments consist of gravelly
fine sandy loam on the ridge top and thin layers of fine- to medium-grained sand
over loamy sand on the flat below. The nearest potential water sources are a very
ephemeral, wet-weather surface drainage about 350 m northwest of the site and
an intermittent tributary of Sand Bend Draw ca. 2 km to the northwest. Sparse to
moderately dense vegetation in the site area consists of scattered yuccas, creosote
bush, low mesquites and acacias, saltbush, Mormon tea, prickly pears, and various
forbs and grasses. The densest vegetation is on the ridge top in the southern part
of the site. Surface visibility is 70â100 percent.
Site 41RV87 includes two loci that are 90â100 m apart. The north locus is
on the deflated alluvial flat and encompasses four exposed burned rock hearths
(Features 1â4) and a group of large sandstone cobbles (Feature 5; Table 3). The
cobbles do not retain any recognizable pattern of arrangement, likely because of
postabandonment disturbance, but they once may have braced the ends of supports
like those used in a small structure such as a wikiup. All of these features are
seated on or only centimeters below the surface. The south locus includes a lithic
procurement area at the west end of the ridge top that is likely part of a larger
procurement area that follows the ridge to the east. Survey efforts documented
archeological materials just outside (east) of the survey area in both loci.
Aside from the features, the surface has a sparse scatter of chipped and
battered or ground stone artifacts, widely dispersed burned rocks (north locus
only), and sparse to abundant unmodified gravels. No diagnostic artifacts were
identified. Observed artifacts include chert and rarely chalcedony debitage,
several chert cores, one chert or chalcedony unifacial scraper, one limestone cobble
chopping tool, one quartzite hammerstone/mano, and one fine-grained igneous
metate fragment. Artifacts are present in about the same frequencies in both loci
but are more easily identified in the north locus due to meager vegetation and

low-density surface gravels in that area. Very occasional artifacts were observed
on the surface between the loci. Burned rocks primarily consist of limestone with
some sandstone and rare quartzite.
The site extends approximately 300 m north-south by at least 100 m eastwest. It extends east beyond the project area, but no effort was made to delineate
its true eastern boundary. A shovel test (ST-1) in a sand sheet remnant at the north

26

end of the site revealed 1â2 cm of sand over two zones of loosely to moderately
consolidated loamy sand with very rare fine gravels and occasional carbonate flecks
in the lowest 30 cm. Sediment at the base of the test (80â85 cm below the surface)
consisted of moderately to well-consolidated sandy clay loam with abundant small
carbonate masses. No artifacts were recovered from the test. A shovel probe (SP-1)
on the ridge top at the south end of the site revealed 15 cm of gravelly sandy loam
over tightly packed gravels. No artifacts were found. The ancient age of the ridge, the
degraded character of the alluvial flat below, the characteristics of the features on
the flat, and the absence of artifacts in the excavated shovel test and probe indicate
that the archeological deposits are restricted to the modern surface or extend only
a few centimeters below it at most.
The site has been impacted by channeled runoff, sheetwash, colluvial
processes, and eolian deflation. Other natural disturbances include animal
burrowing, predatory digging (coyotes), near-surface root growth, and stock grazing.
The northern part of the site probably was subjected to mechanical vegetation
clearing in the past. The 1961 topographic quadrangle depicts a two-track road ca.
25 m west of the site, and an unmapped modern gravel road passes 95â110 m to its
east. The proximity of both make the site accessible to additional recent impacts
such as vehicle and pedestrian traffic and surface collection.
Site 41RV88
Site 41RV88 is a surface scatter of twentieth-century artifacts and a
mechanically excavated ditch in unimproved range land in the center of the west
survey parcel, 1.0 km due east of the U.S. Highway 285-County Road 437 intersection
and 1.8 km due south of County Road 440. The site is in the center of Section 40 of
the original Texas and Pacific Railway Company Survey (Texas General Land Office
2015, Abstract 2527), on the northeast side of an existing two-track road that is the
remnant of an earlier improved roadway (see 41RV92 below).
Site 41RV88 is at an average elevation of 2,840 ft on a broad, nearly level
alluvial outwash plain. Surfaces dip gradually from southwest to northeast along
a wide, ephemeral wet-weather surface drainage that passes about 25 m south of
the artifact scatter. Surfaces in the site area have been extensively reworked by
eolian and recent alluvial processes. The nearly level Monahans and Reakor soil
associations mapped for the area are Aridisols characterized by accumulations
of gypsum and carbonate (SoilWeb Earth 2015), and caliche is exposed at or just
below the surface across much of the site. Surface sediments are light brown
loamy fine sand. The nearest reliable water source is a stock well along the twotrack road 1.4 km southeast of the site, and Sand Bend Draw is 1.5 km to the
northwest. Vegetation consists of creosote bush, tarbush, low mesquites, various
yuccas, broomweed, and various forbs and grasses. Vegetation is thickest along
unmodified portions of the surface drainage. Surface visibility in the artifact
scatter is 90â100 percent.
The low- to moderate-density artifact scatter is about 20 m northwest of
the ditch, with its wider end along the two-track road (41RV92; Figure 10). The

27

70x70âm scatter is primarily metal artifacts and pieces of glass. Metal items include
two small barrel hoops with small wire nails (from wooden kegs), scattered sardine
cans, upright hinged-lid pocket tobacco tins, tin snuff can lids (external friction
cans), aluminum rings (the type that might have joined the tops or bottoms and
sides of larger cans), paint cans, sanitary cans (several opened by church key),
metal hardware (bolts, nuts, and washers), bottle caps (crown and threaded), wire
segments, and unidentifiable metal fragments. One circular can cap is embossed
with âEST 22.â The largest metal artifacts are a possible crushed exhaust pipe
segment (with crimped sides) and a large factory-made metal panel, possibly off of
mechanical equipment. Tobacco and snuff tins, food-related cans, and hardware items
are the most common metal artifacts in the scatter. Glass includes translucent to
opaque white flat glass, bright green bottle glass, and four small pieces of manganese
dioxide-induced colorless glass. Some of the green bottle glass fragments are warped
from heat exposure. Three small whiteware sherds along the south edge of the
scatter are probably derived from flatware; each has molded decorative elements
on one side. Three cylindrical graphite battery cores were observed; these are less
than 2 inches in diameter and about 8 inches long. No structural remains or other
diagnostic features were identified.
The few temporally diagnostic artifacts suggest that the scatter dates to
the first half of the twentieth century. Aside from the embossed can cap, other
temporal indicators include the simple external friction lids observed on several of
the pocket tobacco tins. This lid type was used on tobacco tins for most of the first
half of the twentieth century and was replaced with more airtight internal friction
closures in about 1950 (Kirkpatrick and Duran 1981; Rock 1989). Diagnostic glass
includes the four pieces of manganese dioxide-induced colorless glass. This glass type
transitions from clear to shades of lavender and eventually purple with prolonged
ultraviolet light exposure and is often referenced as solarized, amethyst, or purple
glass. Manganese was used as a glass decolorant from about 1880 to 1915 (Gillio et
al. 1980; Society for Historical Archaeology 2015).
The mechanically excavated ditch south of the surface artifact scatter follows
the alignment of an ephemeral surface drainage on the downslope side of the twotrack road. The southwest-northeast cut is ca. 280 m long, 7 m wide and 60â70 cm
deep at the southwest end, and 3 m wide and only 30 cm deep at the northeast end.
The end of the cut is ringed by denser-than-normal vegetation.
Potential agricultural functions can be ruled out for this feature, since it does
not appear to have been capable of delivering water to adjacent flat areas, and soil
composition along the floor of the cut suggests it was incapable of holding water for
any length of time. The fact that the cut is in the alignment of an existing surface
drainage on the downslope side of the two-track road suggests it was excavated to
channel water away from the once-improved roadway during wet periods. It is not
certain that the ditch and artifact scatter are associated with one another, but the
latter could represent an equipment staging area or short-term camp used during
ditch excavation.

Site 41RV89
Site 41RV89 is an open campsite in unimproved range land on the east side
of a ca. 35-m-wide pipeline corridor near the southwest corner of the east survey
parcel. It is 3.4 km due east of U.S. Highway 285, 2.0 km due south of County Road
440, and 2.8 km west-southwest of the nearest point on the Pecos River. It is at an
average elevation of 2,816 ft on a nearly level relict terrace surface that falls almost
imperceptibly from west to east. Soils are mapped as nearly level Reakor association
(SoilWeb Earth 2015), and surface sediments consist of fine sandy loam over gravelly,
very fine sand. The nearest potential water sources include the upper reaches of
small intermittent Pecos River tributaries 1.1 km northeast and 1.4 km southeast
of the site. A larger intermittent tributary of Fourmile Draw is about 3.2 km to
the southeast. Vegetation is dispersed and sparse, consisting of low mesquites and
acacias, Mormon tea, yuccas, tasajillo, prickly pears, broomweed, various forbs, and
bunch grasses. Surface visibility is 80â90 percent.
Site 41RV89 consists of six disturbed burned rock hearths (see Table 3) in a
roughly 30-m-diameter area in the south-central portion of a sparse, widely dispersed
surface artifact scatter (Figure 11). Four of the hearths are along a shallow, northsouth, 20-m-long arc just east of the pipeline corridor (Features 1â3 and 5), and
the remaining two hearths (Features 4 and 5) are 10â15 m to the east. Most of the
features are on the surface, but some of the rocks in Features 1 and 4 are seated
up to 5 cm below the surface. Other scattered burned rocks are undoubtedly from
these and potentially other extensively disturbed or destroyed thermal features.
The surface scatter also includes cores and flakes (chert, jasper, chalcedony, quartz,
and various fine-grained igneous rocks), one fine-grained igneous bifacial core or
chopping tool, one sandstone mano, and two pieces of mussel shell. Unmodified
gravels are also present in low to moderate densities across the site surface. No
diagnostic artifacts were observed.
The site extends over an area of about 100x65 m. No prehistoric artifacts
or features were observed on the west side of the pipeline corridor opposite the
defined site area. Two shovel tests (ST-1 and ST-2) in the south half of the site
revealed 20â25 cm of fine sandy loam over very fine sand with many small gravels
with carbonate pendants. Basal layers exposed at 45â60 cm below the surface in
both tests consisted of fine sand with few to common small gravels with carbonate
pendants and common soft to hard masses of secondary carbonate and gypsum.
No artifacts were recovered in these tests. The ancient age of the landform, shovel
test results, and results of subsurface probing at several features indicate that the
archeological deposits are primarily restricted to the surface and extend only a few
centimeters below it at most.
Surfaces in the site area have been reworked by sheetwash and eolian
deflation resulting in a patchwork of soil loss in some areas and minor deposition
in others. Other natural disturbances include animal burrowing, near-surface
root growth, and stock grazing. An unknown portion of the site was destroyed by
installation of the pipeline and subsequent surface grading, and the eastern part of
the site was minimally impacted by barbed wire fence installation. The proximity

of these disturbances raises the possibility that site features and the surrounding
artifact scatter were impacted by vehicle and equipment traffic, pedestrian traffic,
and surface collection.
Site 41RV90
Site 41RV90 is an open campsite and lithic procurement locality in
unimproved range land near the southeast corner of the east survey parcel. It is
4.6 km due east of U.S. Highway 285, 1.8 km due south of County Road 440, and
1.7 km southwest of the nearest point on the Pecos River. The site is at an average
elevation of 2,795 ft on the crest of a low, northwest-southeast gravelly ridge at the
toe of an ancient, highly dissected Pecos River alluvial terrace segment (Figure 12).
Surfaces drop gradually to the north, south, and east from the ridge crest toward
a younger, lower, nearly level alluvial surface. The ridge deposits are fine-grained
sediments and an array of small subrounded to rounded sedimentary, metamorphic,
and igneous gravels with coats of secondary carbonates. Surfaces across much of the
landform have been deflated by wind and sheetwash, leaving a light to moderately
dense mantle of gravels. Vegetation has maintained discrete patches of thicker
sandy surface deposits in some areas. Soils are mapped as nearly level Monahans
association (SoilWeb Earth 2015), and surface sediments are fine sand over loamy
fine sand with many small gravels. The landform is on the north valley wall of a
small, intermittent, northeast-trending Pecos River tributary that passes ca. 0.6 km
southeast of the site. A larger intermittent tributary of Fourmile Draw is about
3 km to the south. Dispersed vegetation is dominated by whitethorn acacias with
scattered creosote bush and other acacias, occasional low mesquites, Mormon tea,
yuccas, tasajillo, prickly pears, various forbs, and bunch grasses. Surface visibility
is 80â100 percent.
Site 41RV90 consists of five deflated burned rock hearths (see Table 3) and
a sparse surface scatter of chipped stone artifacts and burned rocks. The hearth
remnants are distributed across the site. Features 1â3 are along a shallow, northsouth, 25-m-long arc in the west half of the site. Feature 4 is in the central part of
the site 25 m east of Feature 3, and Feature 5 is on the east side of the site nearly
110 m east-northeast of Feature 1. Subsurface probing indicated that most of these
are seated on or only a few centimeters below the surface, but Features 2 and 5
each contained buried rocks. Probing revealed a nucleus of subsurface rock in the
northwest portion of widely dispersed Feature 2. Partial exposure identified a tight
group of rocks that is 60x50 cm across and seated 5â7 cm below the surface. Observed
surface artifacts include cores and debitage of microcrystalline materials (cherts,
jasper, chalcedony, and quartz), quartzite, and fine-grained igneous materials. All of
these lithologies are available among the lag gravels found across the site surface,
and chipped stone artifacts are slightly more prevalent in the east half of the site
where these gravels are densest. No diagnostic artifacts were observed.
The artifact scatter and features define a site area of 105x175 m. Two shovel
tests (ST-1 and ST-2) in vegetation-stabilized sediments along the ridge in the
central part of the site revealed 15 cm of fine sand with few to common small gavels
over loamy fine sand with many small gravels. Excavation was stopped at 60 cm

because of an increasing frequency of gravels with carbonate pendants. Neither
test contained artifacts. Shovel test results and feature probing indicate that the
archeological deposits are primarily restricted to the surface, with archeological
materials extending no more than 10 cm below it in two features. The ancient age
and geomorphological character of the ridge support the conclusion that the site
has little to no depth.
The common to abundant lag gavels across the site indicate area surfaces
are relatively stable and primarily impacted by wind deflation and water-derived
erosion. Other natural disturbances include animal burrowing, near-surface root
growth, and stock grazing. No artificial impacts were identified, although previous
vegetation clearing is a possibility.
Site 41RV91
Site 41RV91 is an open campsite and probable lithic procurement area on
the summit of a large interfluve near the north edge of the east survey parcel. It
is 4.7 km due east of U.S. Highway 285, 1.0 km due south of County Road 440, and
1.7 km west-southwest of the nearest point on the Pecos River. The interfluve is
composed of ancient, dissected Pecos River alluvial terrace deposits consisting of
fine-grained sediments and an array of small subrounded to rounded sedimentary,
metamorphic, and igneous gravels with coats of carbonates. The landform stands
above discrete deposits of younger alluvium along intermittent tributaries to the
north and south. Surface elevations are 2,829â2,810 ft. Gently to moderately sloping
surfaces around the interfluve summit transition to nearly level to gently rolling
surfaces on a broad saddle west of the site. Localized degraded sand sheets and
low dune remnants are present on some parts of the landform, and surfaces have
been reworked by eolian and sheetwash processes. Soils are mapped as nearly level
Monahans association (SoilWeb Earth 2015), and surface sediments are loamy fine
sand with typically small gravels. The head of a small, intermittent Pecos River
tributary is about 0.8 km northwest of the site; another is 1.3 km to the southeast.
A series of small, wet-weather surface drainages trend down the north and south
sides of the interfluve toward both tributaries. Most of the site area encompasses
unimproved range land. Moderately dense vegetation in and around the site
includes scattered low mesquites, acacias, and creosote bush, as well as Mormon
tea, yuccas, allthorn, various forbs, and abundant grasses. Vegetation cover on top
of the interfluve is more diverse and noticeably thicker than is the case across much
of the rest of the survey area. Surface visibility is 40â80 percent.
Site 41RV91 consists of three widely separated burned rock hearths (see
Table 3), another possible hearth remnant marked by a discrete scatter of burned
rocks, and a sparse to very sparse surface scatter of chipped and battered stone
artifacts and burned rocks (Figure 13). Trowel probing at the most-intact features
suggests that the central portion of Feature 2 may have some depth; all other feature
clasts were on or only centimeters below the surface. Sparse to moderate-density
fine to small gavels mantle the surface, and many of the chipped stone artifacts are
easily lost among these. Chipped stone artifacts are rare but appear to be slightly
more common upslope to the east and southeast of Feature 1. Observed artifacts

34

include one igneous cobble hammerstone, one fine-grained igneous bifacial core
or chopping tool, and debitage composed of locally available chert, jasper, quartz,
chalcedony, and fine-grained igneous material. The presence of some microcrystalline
and fine-grained igneous gravels large enough for tool production suggests the
landform also served as a lithic procurement locality. No diagnostic prehistoric
artifacts were observed.
The artifact scatter and prehistoric features define a site area that is
approximately 320x370 m. Two shovel tests (ST-1 and ST-2) in the central portion
of the site revealed 20 cm of loamy fine sand with few small gravels over the same
sediment with higher frequencies of small gravels (many with carbonate coats) and
soft masses of secondary gypsum. Test excavations were stopped at 60 cm due to
increasing frequencies of carbonate and gypsum. Neither test contained artifacts. The
ancient age of the terrace deposits, the prevalence of landform-degrading processes,
shovel test results, and feature probing indicate that the archeological deposits are
mainly restricted to the surface and extend no more than 10 cm below it.
Surfaces in the site area have been impacted by eolian and sheetwash
processes, surface gullying, and colluvial processes. Other natural disturbances
include faunal turbation (by rodents, coyotes, javelinas, and livestock) and nearsurface root growth. Construction of a cell tower on the high point of the landform
between 1997 and 2005 (Google Earth satellite imagery) extensively disturbed
the archeological deposits in some areas and largely removed or destroyed any
indication of them in others. Associated disturbances included earthmoving and
surface grading, construction of the tower foundation, installation of six large guywire anchors, construction of a gravel access road, and overhead utility installation.
Site 41RV92
Site 41RV92 is a 3.8-km-long segment of a historic road that extends
southeast from County Road 440, passes through the west survey parcel, and ends
about 0.7 km southeast of the project area (Figure 14). The recorded segment crosses
Sections 32, 33, 40, and 45 of the original Texas and Pacific Railway Company Survey
(Texas General Land Office 2015, Abstracts 2213, 592, 2527, and 598). The recorded
segment is part of a roughly 11-km-long road mapped as an improved âmetal surfaced
roadâ (rock and gravel-surfaced) on a 1940 Reeves County highway map (Texas
State Highway Department 1940). The feature is depicted as a light-duty road and
an unimproved road on the most-recent topographic quadrangles (U.S. Geological
Survey 1961, 1968). Still visible on Google Earth satellite imagery, this road splits
from U.S. Highway 285 north of Orla, bypasses the community and parallels the
highway for about 6.3 km, and curves to rejoin U.S. Highway 285 roughly 2.4 km
south of the project area.
The road segment crosses a broad, nearly level, alluvial outwash plain
where surfaces dip gradually from southwest to northeast. Surface elevations
vary from a high of 2,855 ft at the southeast end to a low of 2,825 ft near the
northeast end. Sediments are primarily fine-grained materials, and area surfaces
have been extensively reworked by sheetwash and eolian processes as evidenced

by sheets of alluvium, sand sheet remnants, coppice dunes, and deflated areas
(some with calciferous or gypsiferous sediments at the surface). The northwest
end of the recorded road segment crosses a shallow valley incised by Sand Bend
Draw. Ephemeral, wet-weather drainages to the south of the draw are indicated
by vegetation changes and barely perceptible dips on the landscape. The mapped
vegetative regime for this area consists of Creosotebush-Tarbush Shrub (Frye et
al. 1984). In addition to these species, vegetation adjacent to the site area includes
low mesquites and acacias, various yuccas, allthorn, occasional cholla, broomweed,
and various forbs and grasses.
In most places, the road is now little more than an unmaintained 2â3-m-wide
two-track path. The largely washed out and channelized segment that crosses Sand
Bend Draw is a rough track maintained by periodic vehicle traffic. Segments of the
road surface on more-elevated terrain south of the draw (in and south of the project
area proper) retain variable amounts of unsorted gravel and rocks and appear to
represent the once gravel-paved road within a 10-m-wide vegetation-free corridor.
Road gravels have been redeposited northeast of the historic road by sheetwash
and channelized flow in the vicinity of ephemeral wet-weather drainages. Utility
pole remnants in two places about 10 m southwest of the track indicate that an
overhead utility line paralleled the roadway for an unknown distance. The utility
pole locality inside the project area, ca. 100 m southeast of the north boundary,
includes two wood cross bars and numerous clear glass insulator fragments. The
other locality, about 60 m northwest of the project area, includes two utility poles,
three wood cross bars, and scattered clear glass insulator fragments.

assessments and recommendations

Native American Sites
The four previously unrecorded Native American archeological sites
documented during the survey lack the capacity to contain important information
and are considered ineligible for designation as State Antiquities Landmarks
(13 TAC 26.2, 8). These are one open campsite (41RV89) and three open campsites
associated with lithic procurement localities (41RV87, 41RV90, and 41RV91).
All four are on ancient degrading landforms where the archeological deposits
are primarily restricted to the surface. These sites contain three to six disturbed
burned rock hearths, and a group of sandstone cobbles at 41RV87 may be the basal
supports for a wikiup-type structure. The surrounding artifact scatters are sparse
to very sparse and primarily composed of chipped stones. No temporally diagnostic
artifacts were identified at these sites, and hence their ages are unknown. Intrasite
feature distributions suggest single brief occupations by an extended family group
or a small number of repeated occupations. The general paucity of lithic materials
suitable for stone tool manufacture in the area, however, suggests that the lithic
procurement localities were visited numerous times throughout prehistory. The
geomorphological characteristics of the landforms suggest that the archeological
deposits are palimpsests of repeated site use. All of these sites have been disturbed

38

by eolian deflation and sheetwash, stock grazing, and other forms of faunal turbation.
Given the generally poor conditions of the prehistoric features and the degraded
conditions of the surfaces on which they sit, the sparse character and uncertain
depositional history of the surrounding artifact assemblages, and the apparent
absence of temporally diagnostic artifacts, the remaining archeological deposits
cannot be interpreted in any meaningful way. While identification of these sites builds
on existing site distribution data that is useful in a gross sense for understanding
Native American utilization of the eastern portion of the Trans-Pecos Basin and
Range physiographic province, the aforementioned limiting factors indicate that the
archeological deposits at these four sites do not retain the capacity to contribute
additional important information. No further work is recommended at them.
Historic Sites
The two historic archeological sites documented during the survey (41RV88
and 41RV92), both dating to the first half of the twentieth century, also lack the
capacity to contribute important information and are considered ineligible for
designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (13 TAC 26.2, 8). Site 41RV88 consists
of a low- to moderate-density artifact scatter on a deflated, stable surface and an
adjacent mechanically excavated drainage ditch. The few temporally diagnostic
artifacts indicate that it dates to the first half of the century. The site may be tied to
maintenance activities along the adjacent historic road (41RV92), but the character,
context, and age of the remaining archeological deposit indicate it has no potential to
provide important archeological information regarding area history. Site 41RV92 is
a segment of a longer, once rock-and-gravel-surfaced roadway, possibly constructed
in association with the local oil and gas industry, that split from U.S. Highway 285
north of Orla, bypassed the community to the east, and rejoined the highway south of
the project area. The road segment is now an unmaintained, degraded, infrequently
used two-track path. Historical features associated with it (e.g., utility poles) have
been dismantled. Given the siteâs minimal archeological footprint and adverse
impacts to the road over the past 50â60 years, the existing physical manifestation of
41RV92 has no potential to provide important archeological information regarding
area history. No further work is recommended at these two sites.
