ABSTRACT
In December 2009 Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultant (DETAC) conducted a
cultural resource management survey of the proposed Hallsville Sanitary Sewer system
Improvements #R729210. The improvements include expanding a lift station to a 9x9 m
(30x30 ft) area and replacing roughly 915 m (3000 ft) of pipeline. The cultural resources
survey included shovel testing the lift station and pipeline as well as excavating a trench
adjacent to the Hallsville Cemetery. The pedestrian survey was conducted with a
combination of visual examination and shovel testing. A total of 16 shovel tests along
the pipeline and lift station were all negative. The visual examination and excavation of
the trench found no evidence of unmarked graves through coffin hardware, burial pits, or
bones. No artifacts were collected. No further investigations are recommended however,
if any cultural material is recovered during construction, than excavation should stop and
a qualified archaeologist contacted to evaluate the impact. DETAC is requesting
concurrence with the determination of “no effect” on NRHP eligible properties for the
proposed project.

INTRODUCTION
In December 2009, DETAC (Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants) conducted a
cultural resources survey of the proposed lift station and replacement sewer line in
Hallsville, Texas (Figure 1). Because Hallsville is a subdivision of the State of Texas, the
survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit #5470. The report was reviewed
by the Texas Historical Commission.

The purpose of this survey was to locate, describe and record any cultural resources
within the project area boundaries. The report was prepared following the short report
format outlined by the Council of Texas Archaeologist (CTA) (1995a) with modifications
requested by the THC (Martin 1999). No cultural resources were found during the
survey. Based on fieldwork, DETAC recommends a determination of “no effect” to
cultural resources for the proposed lift station and pipeline.

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The project included a 9 x 9 m (30 x 30 ft) lift station and 915 m (3000 ft) of force main
sewer pipeline. The lift station is an addition to an existing facility adjacent to and west
of an intermittent drainage while the pipeline is a replacement line north of and adjacent
to Willow Street. Of major concern is the proximity of the existing and new pipelines to
the Hallsville Cemetery. Based on the general pipeline cross-section (Figure 2), the
potential for both the previous and replacement pipelines impacting unmarked graves is
high. Backhoe trenches were excavated by city personnel under the supervision of the
engineer in charge of the project to insure proper location near the cemetery and the
remainder of the project area centerline was delineated surveyor’s lathes and flagging
tape at the time of the survey.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND CULTURAL HISTORY
Overall, Harrison County has been part of broad studies and investigated in both larger
examinations and numerous small surveys. The closest large-scale investigations were
conducted for Lake O’ Pines to the northwest and the Longhorn Army Ammunition
Plant, Karnack Mini-Mine, Hallsville, and Darco Strip Mines to the south and west (Cliff
et al. 1995; Espy, Huston, and Associates 1984; Gadus et al. 1988). Small-scale surveys
were conducted for several oil and gas pipelines and road improvements throughout the
area as well (SDHPT 1975; Perttula 1998).

In addition to the fieldwork referenced above, several documents have added significantly
to available information on the archaeological record in this region. The documents of
primary importance are D.A. Story's (1990) and J.A. Guy's (1990) discussions of the Gulf
Coastal Plain. Additionally, the Texas Historical Commission, Department of Antiquities
Protection developed a document for the eastern Texas portion of the Texas State Plan
(Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). This document includes several historic contexts, each of
which deals with a particular facet of northeast Texas prehistory. This plan serves to
synthesize the current state of archaeological research in the region and identify problems
and objectives to be addressed in future research and cultural resources management.
Several weak areas in archaeological knowledge of the region are identified in these
studies. Cultural chronology, aboriginal settlement patterns and subsistence, and historic
continuities are some of the general research directions that these recent studies emphasize
as important for developing future archaeological research designs. More recently, Perttula
(2004:370-407) describes the Caddoan archaeology of northeast Texas which encompasses
the area between the Red River in the north, the Trinity River in the west, and Angelina
River in the south.

The occupation of the area ranges from the Paleoindian (ca. pre-7000 B.C.) to Archaic
foraging cultures (ca. 7000-200 B.C.), Early Ceramic Period groups (ca. 200 B.C. - A.D.
800), the sedentary Caddoan occupation (A.D. 800 - 1680), and ends in the historic Euro
American settlement (Perttula and Kenmotsu 44:1993). The Paleo-Indian period (ca.
10,000-7000 B.C.) is characterized by small, mobile bands of hunters and gatherers that

4

consumed a variety of native plants and animals (Story 1990). The Archaic (7000-200
B.C.) refers to hunter-gatherers who implemented more regionally specialized approaches
toward exploiting their environment (Story 1990). The Early Ceramic (200 B.C.-A.D. 800)
stage, also referred to as the Woodland period, represents an increasing utilization of the
environment by local groups to include a greater reliance on cultigens, prolonged
occupations at specific locales indicating an increasingly sedentary lifestyle, and the
emergence of social and ritual ceremonies (Story 1990). The prehistory of east Texas in
the Late Prehistoric period essentially concerns the Caddoan culture (A.D. 800-1600). This
culture is an indigenous development strongly influenced by the Mississippian tradition of
the Lower Mississippi Valley (Story 1990). Larger aggregates of people became sedentary
and constructed villages with public ceremonial areas and cemeteries found in association
with large mounds (Perttula 2004:379).

A stratified social structure developed,

corresponding to the chiefdom level as first defined by Service (1962, 1975). Extensive
commercial networks were also established.

The Historic period (1680-present) describes both the history behind the current cultural
setting of the area and marks a transition from the native populations domination of the
area, to the American immigrants establishment of farms, towns, and counties. Harrison
County was taken from Shelby County in 1839 but not organized and named until 1842 for
Jonas Harrison. The area was sparkly settled and, as a result, Fort Crawford was built in
1839 roughly 1.6 km (1 mile) west of modern Hallsville by W.C. Crawford for protection
against raiding Indians. Later, the fort served as a post office, a public building, a church
and a Masonic hall between 1839 and 1873 (Spier 2007). Marshall, the county seat since
inception, was the hub of commerce with the terminus of the Texas and Pacific Railway
line. The core of early Harrison County economy was cotton farmed on plantations;
however, Marshall also provided the Confederate Army with manpower, gunpowder, and
other necessities until the end of the war. After the Civil War Harrison County changed
little as former slaves became tenant farmers. With the war over, the now Southern Pacific
railroad extended the terminus to Hallsville in 1869 after Elijah Hall (Little 1984:189). The
town prospered with the addition of a saloon, post office, railroad general office, and
machine shops (Tiemann and Belew 2008:7).

5

Hallsville incorporated in 1870 with

businesses in cotton, wool, and hides; however, Hallsville lost population and the
government became insolvent with the extension of the rail road to Longview and the
removal of the railroad offices. Cotton production through share cropping retained its
dominance throughout the remainder of the century and well into the next. The Great
depression forced the population of Harrison County to seek employment in manufacturing
around Marshall instead of remaining disbursed in agriculture (THA 2009). Hallsville
remained small eventually re-incoperating in 1935. The population of Hallsville slowly
grew as World War II brought much needed manufacturing jobs to the area. While the
emphasis has shifted to coal mining, oil and gas exploration, and lumber, the area continues
to prosper with a mixture of agriculture, siviculture, and industry today.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The investigations were preformed in compliance with the National Historic Preservation
Act of 1966 (PL89-665), as amended in 1974, 1976, 1980, and 1992; the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL91-190, 83 Stat. 915, 42 USC 4231, 1970); and the
guidelines set forth by the CTA (1995b), the Texas Antiquities Code, and the Register of
Professional Archaeologists.

The program of site definition was conducted in accordance with the National Park
Service criteria (36 CFR, part 60.4) which present the guidelines for determining
eligibility of a cultural resource for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP). The objectives of the survey were to locate prehistoric and historic cultural
resources sites within the survey areas. If sites were found, then the investigations were
to delineate the vertical and horizontal extent of each site, determine each site’s integrity,
and provide a preliminary evaluation of each site’s potential for NRHP eligibility.

Before initiating fieldwork, DETAC acquired a Texas Antiquities Permit, conducted a
record and literature review using maps and files at the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas
(THC 2009).

The site location maps and cultural resources records at TARL were

consulted to identify the location, types, and both State Archaeological Landmarks (SAL)
and NRHP eligibility of previously recorded sites within or in close proximity to the project
areas. The Site Atlas was consulted for published and unpublished data regarding cultural
resource surveys.

DETAC conducted a 100 percent pedestrian survey of the area. To locate sites, the
pedestrian survey relied on visual examination and shovel testing. Visual examinations
were conducted in areas with exposed soil surfaces in a continuous effort between shovel
tests. Shovel testing was conducted in accordance with the Texas Historic Commission’s
guidelines for cultural resources surveys. According to these guidelines, linear project
areas require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per 1600 m (5280 ft); therefore, a total of 10
shovel tests were required for the 915 m (3000 ft) pipeline and 9x9 m (30x30 ft) lift station.

7

Shovel testing included excavating an area approximately 30 cm (12 inches) in diameter in
10 cm (4 inch) levels down to the clay substrate or 90 cm (35 inches). The excavated
matrix was screened through a 0.635 cm (0.25 inch) wire mesh screen. The depth, soil
type, and color of each shovel test were recorded.

Excavations adjacent to the cemetery include identifying those areas with the oldest
graves and monitoring a backhoe, with a smooth edge bucket, excavating trenches down
to within 30 cm (12 inches) of the existing pipeline. The existing lines were found by the
earlier trench disturbance and inserting a rod to determine the depth to the pipe. Pipes
were not exposed as these are in service and any damage would be catastrophic to
neighborhoods and the school in the area. DETAC archaeologists examined excavated
material as well as trench walls and floors for either previously impacted grave or new
impacts. Several sections of the trench walls and floor were cleaned and photographed.
A representative soil profile was prepared showing the impacts by the proposed
excavation and replacement pipeline. If a grave was found, than excavation were to stop
and a decision will be made with city officials to either rerouted or apply for a burial
excavation permit.

RESULTS
The closest documented cultural resources survey was by Leach-Palm (1996) for a
pipeline roughly 100 m (330 ft) north of the project area adjacent to Hwy 80 on the north
side of railroad tracks and the cemetery. One site, 41HS575, was recorded as a lithic
artifact scatter. The site was not considered eligible for NRHP nomination; however, the
report recommended reevaluation of any future impacts to the site outside the surveyed
area. The next closest survey was by Whitsett and Jurgens (1995) of roughly 6.5 ha (16
acres) expansion to the waste water treatment plant expansion for the Texas Water
Development Board (TWDB) 1.8 km (1.2 miles) to the east for Hallsville.

No

archaeological sites were documented. The closest documented archaeological site was
Fort Crawford, 41HS908, roughly 650 m (2130 ft) southwest of the current project area
(Speir 2007). The site form documents a cemetery in association with the fort, but
several graves were reinterned in the Hallsville cemetery which was established in 1875;
the date of the reinternments is unknown. Closest to the project area, the Hallsville
Cemetery, Marker 10171 (THC 2009), states that three acres of land were secured by
railroad developers. The earliest internment is Mrs. G.C. Russell 1875 while older grave
markers are for internments from Ft. Crawford and the Ash Springs community.

Soils in the project area were described as Sacul very fine sandy loam and Cuthbert fine
sandy loam on the uplands and slopes, with Iuka fine sandy loam frequently flooded in
the flood plains (NRCS 2009). Sacul soils (1-5% slope) are described as 15 cm (6
inches) of very fine sandy loam over clay. Typically found at interfluves, Sacul soils
cover the major extent of the project area including the uplands near the Cemetery.
These soils are formed from clayey marine deposits. Cuthbert soils (5-15% slope) are
described as 15 cm (6 inches) of fine sandy loam over clay. Also found at interfluves,
this soil is encountered more on the slopes at the eastern end of the project area. This soil
is also formed from clayey marine deposits. Iuka soils are described as up to 2 meters (6
feet) of fine sandy loam. Iuka soil is frequently flooded and found only near drainage on
the western end of the project area. This soil is formed from a loamy alluvium.

9

The pedestrian survey found the Hallsville project area to consist of an upland ridge and
adjacent slopes and drainages (Figure 3). The western end of the project area, near the
proposed lift station, consists of the headwaters of an unnamed drainage. The central
portion of the pipeline includes a ridge summit with the city cemetery on the ridge
summit. The eastern half of the project area consists of a gentle upland slope. The east
end is a paved parking lot. Vegetation consisted of pasture grasses near the cemetery and
adjacent slopes, with areas of mature pine on the eastern half of the project area.

A total

of 16 shovel test were excavated along the right of way at 30 m intervals. Shovel testing
found soil conditions similar to the soil survey with varying depths of sandy loam over
clay. Shovel test results are presented in Table 1.

Backhoe trench excavation near the cemetery began with a visual examination of the
graves closest to the project area. Those graves within 10 m (30 ft) of the right-of-way
with death dates earlier than 1950 were recorded with a GPS and notes were made of the
name, birth date, and death date. Photographs were made of each grave and the location
of grave makers across the cemetery older than 1900 were recorded with a GPS. The
locations of the grave makers within 30 m (100 ft) of the right-of-way are depicted in
Figure 4.

The visual inspection of the graves close to the right-of-way found the oldest internments
were on or near the summit of the ridge, some within 3 m (10 ft) of the proposed
excavations. The general setting near the cemetery from south to north includes the road
surface, as little as 90 cm (36 inches) gap between the road surface and a steep slope
roughly 40 cm (16 inches) high, a hedge row, and grave markers (Figure 4a). The visual
examination also found two vertical cement markers with “TPRW” between the
hedgerow and graves (Figure 4a). These markers delineate the initial 3 acres set aside by
the Texas & Pacific Railway company for the cemetery in 1875. Graves earlier than
1875 are burials from either Ft. Crawford cemetery or the Ash Springs community
cemetery; none were found within 30 m (100 ft) of the right-of-way. The earliest marker
close to the pipeline was for a grave from 1878; however, the marker, and many of a
similar age, were new, e.g., within the past 80 years. The oldest grave and maker from
the same period was from 1894 on the summit of the ridge (Figure 4d). The earlier dated
graves with more recent markers were further down slope.

Trench excavations began at the ridge summit and extended east and west to the edge of
the cemetery. The trench excavations revealed the previous pipeline trench and extended
to the north into undisturbed soil. Excavations revealed disturbed trench fill next to light
red/gray mottled clay overlain by a dark brown gravely loam (Figure 4c). The gravel was
from the adjacent road. The profile on the south side of the trench was similar with the
sand and asphalt from the road bed replacing the loam on the north wall. Monitoring
excavated material as well as trowel-cleaning the wall and floor found no evidence of
grave hardware, burial cavities or pits, or bones.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The proposed lift station and replacement sewer pipeline will impact the slope and
summit of an upland ridge in the City of Hallsville. Much of the impacted area is
disturbed by existing facilities and pipelines along with an adjacent road. The proximity
of the city cemetery suggest early unmarked graves may be found adjacent to the
previously excavated sewer line. The pipeline right-of-way outside the cemetery was
shovel tested at 30 m (100 ft0 intervals. No cultural material was found in any of the test
or during the surface inspection.

Visual examination of the cemetery and the right-of-way found the surface disturbed by a
road bed to 30 cm (12 inches) below the ground surface. Adjacent to the road surface the
ground slopes up to a hedgerow and the edge of the cemetery. The initial cemetery
boundary from 1875 was found along the hedgerow. Graves from 1878 to 2009 are
found within 30 m (100 ft) of the proposed pipeline. Two internments from 1878 and
1894 were found within 3 m (10 ft) of the proposed pipeline. Excavation of trenches
from the summit of the ridge to the edge of the cemetery found no evidence of unmarked
graves and none of the marked graves will be impacted by the proposed replacement
pipeline.

In conclusion, the investigations did not document any cultural resources in the survey of
the pipeline and no unmarked graves were found in trench excavations near the cemetery.
Based on the investigations, there is little chance of encountering cultural resources or
unmarked graves in the project area. DETAC is requesting a concurrence with the
determination of “no effect” on NRHP eligible properties for the proposed project areas.
