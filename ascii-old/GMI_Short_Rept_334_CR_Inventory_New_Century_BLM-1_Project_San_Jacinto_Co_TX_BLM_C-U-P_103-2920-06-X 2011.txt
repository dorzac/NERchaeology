MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

This report presents the results of a cultural resources survey for New Century Exploration’s
proposed BLM #1 well pad and associated lease road in southeastern San Jacinto County, Texas.
This cultural resources investigation was conducted by Geo-Marine, Inc., under subcontract to
Titanium Environmental Services, LLC, for New Century Exploration, Inc., and the Bureau of
Land Management. The purpose of this document is to provide data for use in the management
of cultural resources in partial fulfillment of obligations under Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (P.L. 96-515), as amended, and other cultural resources
legislation. Cultural resources investigations consisted of a records search to identify previous
cultural resources surveys conducted in the area and the archeological and historic sites recorded
by those efforts, visual inspection of the project area, and subsurface investigations via the
excavation of screened shovel tests. Fieldwork for this project was conducted on 11 August
2011. This survey encountered no cultural resources in the project area. Construction of the New
Century BLM #1 well pad and its associated lease road will have no adverse effect on any
significant cultural resources. Provided the project is carried out as proposed, no further cultural
resources investigations are recommended.

INTRODUCTION
This report presents results of a cultural resources survey conducted by Geo-Marine, Inc., (GeoMarine Project No. 30563.00.09) under subcontract to Titanium Environmental Services, LLC,
for New Century Exploration, Inc., for the proposed BLM #1 well pad and associated lease road
(Bureau of Land Management [BLM] Lease No. TXNM 60921). The proposed project area is
located on a dissected upper terrace near the confluence of Winters Bayou and the East Fork of
the San Jacinto River in southeastern San Jacinto County, Texas (Figure 1). Farm-to-Market
Road (FM) 1725 is located to the west of the project area. The city of Cleveland, Texas, is
located approximately 4 miles (mi; 6.4 kilometers [km]) to the southeast.
The New Century BLM #1 project area consists of a 2-acre well pad and 900 feet (ft; 274 meters
[m]) of lease road right-of-way (ROW). The landscape encompassing the proposed project area
is composed of agricultural operations and managed timberlands within the Sam Houston
National Forest. This proposed well pad infrastructure will be constructed on private property
owned by John Stockton of Cleveland, Texas. The mineral rights targeted by the proposed well,
however, are the possession of the BLM, and this project is therefore under the oversight of that
agency. This work was conducted under BLM Cultural Use Permit #103-2920-06-X for review
by the BLM Field Office in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Fieldwork for this project was initially conducted
on 11 August 2011 by Project Archeologist Christopher Goodmaster with assistance from Chris
Taylor and Charles DeCurtis. Melissa Green served as the Principal Investigator throughout the
process of this investigation. As per BLM cultural resources survey requirements, a minimum
buffer area of 10 acres around the proposed well pad location and a 50-ft (15-m) buffer along the
proposed lease road was surveyed. This resulted in the cultural resources survey of
approximately 12.1 acres for this project area.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The proposed New Century BLM #1 project area is located along the East Fork of the San Jacinto
River, which bisects the Tertiary uplands of the South Central Plains physiographic region in
southeastern San Jacinto County, Texas (Griffith et al. 2004). This region is characterized by
rolling or hummocky plains underlain by the sands of the Late Pleistocene-age Deweyville
Formation (Bureau of Economic Geology 1993). The project area is situated on a dissected
terrace near the confluence of Winters Bayou and the East Fork of the San Jacinto River at an
elevation of approximately 165 ft (50 m) above mean sea level on a slope of 0–2 percent (Figure
2). The confluence of these two streams is located approximately 1.2 mi (2 km) to the northeast.
The soils of the proposed project area consist of the Dallardsville series. The Dallardsville series
is classified as a coarse-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Oxyaquic Paleudults (McEwen et
al. 1988; Natural Resources Conservation Service 2011). Dallardsville soils tend to be very deep,
moderately well drained fine sandy loams and loamy very fine sands formed in eolian deposits on
Pleistocene terraces. These soils typically exhibit a yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very fine sandy
loam A horizon to a depth of approximately 7 inches (in; 18 centimeters [cm]) overlying a pink
(7.5YR 7/3) very fine sandy loam E horizon to a depth of 7 to 21 in (18 to 53 cm) underlain by a
series of pink (7.5YR 7/3) and reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) mottled very fine sandy loam E/Bt
horizons.

The project area is located within the Austroriparian biotic province (Blair 1950; Dice 1943).
Once blanketed by oak-hickory-pine forests, the area now supports loblolly and shortleaf pine and
is locally referred to as the Pineywoods (Gould et al. 1960). This region supports a diverse biotic
community. Mammal species in the area, either presently or historically, include deer
(Odocoileus virginianus), cougar (Puma concolor), feral hogs (Sus scrofa), black bear (Ursus
americanus), squirrel (Sciurus spp.), rabbit (Sylvilagus spp.), opossum (Didelphis virginiana),
beaver (Castor sp.), and raccoon (Procyon lotor). Hydrophilic vegetation, such as water oak (Q.
nigra), elm (Ulmus sp.), and black tupelo (N. sylvatica), and numerous aquatic vertebrates and
invertebrates are also common in the area. The climate of the project area is humid and
subtropical, characterized by hot summers and mild winters.

CULTURAL CONTEXT
This section presents a brief synopsis, based on regional archeology, of Native American cultural
chronology and Euro-American history of Southeast Texas. Given the size of the region and the
depth and breadth of cultural complexity that has developed in the area, this discussion must
necessarily be limited in scope. References are provided to supplement the information
summarized here.

NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY
The earliest known inhabitants of Southeast Texas were the broad-spectrum hunter-gathers
loosely referred to as the Paleoindian culture. Over several thousand years, these nomadic people
adopted increasingly restricted territories and targeted the abundant game and other resources in
the region, typically moving in seasonal rounds to procure various foods and raw materials.
During the subsequent cultural period referred to as the Archaic, populations generally continued
this way of life, based on the abundant nature of resources in the Pineywoods region, for several
millennia. By the Middle Archaic period, the people of Southeast Texas began cultivating
starchy and oily seed plants and, in the Late Archaic period, became active in expansive
intraregional social networks based on trade and shared religious beliefs. The addition of the bow
and arrow and the development of ceramic technology mark the Late Prehistoric period in the
region; although few changes in subsistence strategies are evident. Detailed synopses of
Southeast Texas prehistoric chronology are provided in other sources and will therefore not be
discussed in this report. For additional information, see Aten (1983), Kenmotsu and Perttula
(1993), Ricklis (2004), and Story et al. (1990).

HISTORIC EURO-AMERICAN ERA
The earliest European presence in Southeast Texas was led by René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La
Salle, who established Fort Saint Louis in 1685 along the Texas coast in present-day Victoria
County (Davis and Bruseth 2000; Fort St. Louis 2009; John 1975:182), followed later by Louis
Juchereau de St. Denis, who in 1714 set up a trading post at Natchitoches in present-day
Louisiana, and by Bénard de la Harpe, who in 1719 began his trading post, Le Poste des
Cadodaquious, in present-day Bowie County (Harper 2002). Spanish fear of an increased French
presence in Texas led to the decision in 1716 to try again to establish a series of buffer missions
and presidios in present-day East Texas and Louisiana (Cooper et al. 2003; Pool 1975:28;
4

Swanton 1942:46–49). When France and Spain went to war over the issue, the French forced the
Spanish to abandon the area (Newcomb 1961:288). However, after the truce in 1721, the French
withdraw from Texas, and the Spanish reestablished the missions and set Los Adaes as the capital
of the Province of Texas. After briefly regaining control of the area, the French sold it to the
United States in 1803 as part of the Louisiana Purchase.
Following the sale of Louisiana in 1803, the United States considered most of Texas to be part of
the Louisiana Purchase and encouraged settlement of the area (Chandler and Howe 1939). Even
though considered to be part of the United States, Texas was formally a part of Mexico. Texas
won its independence from Mexico in 1836 and functioned as the Republic of Texas for nine
years. Texas traded its independence for U.S. statehood on 29 December 1845, entering the
union as the twenty-eighth state. After the presidential election of 1860, Texas began to consider
secession, since the sympathies of most of the Anglo-American residents of Texas lay with the
South. On 1 February 1861, Texas became part of the Confederate States of America. The defeat
of the Confederacy in 1865 brought about the end of slavery in Texas, the breakdown of the old
slave-based plantation system, a distressed economy, and the presence of a Union army of
occupation (Harper 2009). The Texas legislature established San Jacinto County with Coldspring
as the county seat on 13 August 1870, out of parts of Liberty, Montgomery, Polk, and Walker
counties. After 1870, as the population began to gradually increase and the railroads arrived, the
region began to recover from the worst effects of the war. The lumber industry began to grow
(Coleman et al. 1984:19; Harper 2009) as railroads allowed transportation of lumber from timberrich Polk, Angelina, San Augustine, San Jacinto, Shelby, Trinity, and Nacogdoches counties. The
national forest system in Texas was established by a legislative act in 1933 that authorized the
purchase of lands for preservation and management. President Franklin D. Roosevelt proclaimed
these purchases on October 15, 1936.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS AND METHODOLOGY
The cultural resources survey recorded in this document was designed to identify both prehistoric
and historic archeological sites along with important architectural resources located within the
New Century BLM #1 project area. This work was undertaken with two primary management
goals in mind:
1. To locate cultural resources occurring within the designated survey areas
2. To assess the significance of those resources in regard to their potential for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
The first of these goals was accomplished by a program of background and archival research,
intensive pedestrian survey, and excavations undertaken using the field methods described in this
section. The second goal consisted of assessment and evaluation of any cultural resources
identified, based on National Register criteria defined in 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)
§60.4 (National Park Service 1990).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS IN THE PROJECT AREA
To determine previous cultural resources survey efforts and the locations of previously recorded
historic or archeological resources in the project area, the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas online
database maintained by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) was consulted. Review of THC
records indicated that one previous cultural resources survey has been conducted within a 1-mi
(1.6-km) radius of the project area; the survey was conducted within the Sam Houston National
Forest in 2007 in preparation for a seismic survey (Moore and Baxter 2008). Although several
archeological sites were recorded during that survey, none was located within the search radius.
Various sources of historical and geographic data were consulted to ascertain the likelihood of
historic-era structural resources existing within the proposed project area. These sources include
topographic maps (which often record cultural resources such as cemeteries, houses, and related
features) and aerial photography. Based on a review of these historic records and previously
recorded archeological site locations, it is evident that the region in general has experienced a
dynamic history. Evaluating these sources with more recent records, however, indicates that the
substantial development has occurred in recent years, altering much of the historic landscape.
Furthermore, cross-referencing the locations of nearby previously recorded cultural resources
with geomorphic features such as landforms and soils suggests that prehistoric occupation of the
region was typically confined to upland escarpments and areas adjacent to perennial streams.
Historic period habitation within the region was minimal during the nineteenth century; however,
settlement increased markedly during the twentieth century.

METHODOLOGY

Survey Methods
Based on the background and archival research conducted, it was determined that the proposed
New Century BLM #1 project area had a moderate probability of containing prehistoric cultural
sites based on the presence of well-drained, sandy soils and its location near the confluence of
two major streams. Given the amount of groundcover and the nature of archeological sites in the
region, it was assumed that ground visibility in the project area would not be conducive to visual
inspection and that subsurface excavation via shovel testing would be necessary to adequately
survey the area. Shovel tests consisted of hand-excavated units 30–40 cm (11.8–15.7 in) in
diameter excavated in 20-cm (7.9-in) levels, with the excavated soil passed through a 0.64-cm
(0.25-in) hardware mesh screen to recover artifacts. The location of each shovel test was
recorded with a submeter-accurate Trimble® GeoXT™ global positioning system (GPS) unit,
and the exposed soil profile documented. Each shovel test was backfilled upon completion of the
recording process.

SURVEY RESULTS
This section presents the results of the cultural resources survey and assesses the effects of the
proposed New Century BLM #1 project on cultural resources in the vicinity. Management
considerations and recommendations based on the findings of this survey are presented in the
final section.

BACKGROUND AND ARCHIVAL RESEARCH RESULTS
Review of THC records indicated that one previous cultural resources investigation has been
conducted within a 1-mi (1.6-km) radius of the project area; however, no archeological sites have
been previously recorded within the search radius. Archival research focused on the historic
period settlement in the immediate vicinity of the project area. No structures or other historic
period developments are indicated in the vicinity of the project area. A review of historic aerial
photography indicates that little development, aside from residential and agricultural
development, occurred in the vicinity of the project area in the mid-to-late-twentieth century.

CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY RESULTS
The proposed New Century BLM #1 project area was intensively investigated to determine the
presence of cultural resources using a combined technique of systematic visual reconnaissance
and the excavation of screened shovel tests. Approximately 12.1 acres were investigated, with 12
shovel tests excavated as part of this cultural resources survey (Figure 3).
The New Century BLM #1 project area occupies a dissected Pleistocene terrace near the
confluence of Winters Bayou and the East Fork of the San Jacinto River. The proposed project
area supports a mixed pine-hardwood forest (Figure 4) and is adjacent to the managed
timberlands of the Sam Houston National Forest. Groundcover within the project area consisted
primarily of leaf litter; however, several portions of the survey area have been cleared,
presumably due to timber management (Figure 5). Several push piles are evident in the southern
portion of the survey area, where clearing activities were most prominent (Figure 6). The
topography is gently undulating, with several localized rises. Soil profiles exposed within shovel
tests typically consisted of a very thin (4–6 cm [1.5–2 in]) light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine
loamy sand overlying a very pale brown (10YR 8/4) very fine loamy sand, often with quartz and
sandstone gravels increasing with depth (Table 1). No artifacts were encountered on the surface
or in any of the shovel tests excavated within the proposed New Century BLM #1 project area.
This cultural resources survey encountered no cultural resources, as defined under 36 CFR 60.4.
The area affected by the proposed New Century BLM #1 project holds a very low probability of
containing significant cultural resources.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This cultural resources survey was conducted to document and assess cultural resources within
the proposed New Century BLM #1 project area and to provide adequate and relevant
information for use in the management of cultural resources within the project area. No
previously recorded archeological sites are located within 1.6 km (1 mi) of the project area. All
shovel tests excavated within the proposed project area were found to be negative for artifacts or
other cultural materials, and no cultural materials were observed on the surface of the project
area. No historic properties as defined under 36 CFR 60.4 were identified during this cultural
resources investigation of the project area. The area affected by the New Century BLM #1
project holds a very low probability of containing significant cultural resources.

Based on the results of this survey, there is a very low potential for deposits containing
archeological materials within the proposed project area. Given the lack of cultural resources in
the project area, it is recommended that the proposed construction will not adversely affect any
significant cultural resources. In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4(d)(2), it is recommended that no
further cultural resources investigation is necessary. Consequently, it is recommended that
construction be allowed to proceed.
