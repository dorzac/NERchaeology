Paleo-Indian Artifacts from Sites Along
San Miguel Creek: Frio, Atascosa and
Nlcl\!Iullen Counties, Texas
THOMAS RoY HESTER

ABSTRACT

A number of probable late Paleo-Indian projectile points have been
collected from eight sites along San Miguel Creek, in Frio, Atascosa, and
McMullen counties. These artifacts are described and illustrated in this
paper; the Angostura, Plainview, Plainview golondrina, Meserve, and
Milnesand types appear to be represented. Archaic and other non-PaleoIndian artifacts from these sites are tabulated and briefly described.

INTRODUCTION
San Miguel Creek is formed by the confluence of Black Creek and
Cat Creek in east-central Frio County, about 50 miles southwest of
San Antonio, Texas. From its headwaters, it flows over a 45-mile
course through eastern Frio, southwestern Atascosa and northern
McMullen counties; it roughly parallels the Frio River, which it joins
near Calliham in McMullen County (see Fig. 1). While the entire
creek has not been systematically surveyed, a number of sites have
been recorded along the central part. In 1954, Dr. T. N. Campbell's
Anthropology 340 class (from The University of Texas) recorded
several sites in southeast Frio and southwest Atascosa counties, most
of which were exposed by gullying and sheet erosion along both sides
of San Miguel Creek. The collections gathered at that time are stored
at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (T.A.R.L.) at Austin.
In recent years, William Stanton, Jr. (of Corpus Christi) has collected
from site 41 AT 10, on San lVIiguel Creek in southwest Atascosa
County; he has graciously made materials from this site available for
study. In McMullen County, Mr. and Mrs. J. L. Tunnell located a
large site ( 41 l\1C 1) near the town of Cross, along the southern side of
San Miguel Creek. The collection made by Mr. and Mrs. Tunnell is
also stored at T.A.R.L., and a detailed report on it is in preparation
(Hester, MS, "Archeological Materials from Three Areas of Southwestern Texas").
The sites thus far recorded along San Miguel Creek have predominantly Archaic artifact assemblages. The various classes of artifacts found at the sites are discussed briefly and are listed in Table 1.

In addition to the Archaic materials, a number of possible late PaleoIndian projectile points have also been found. It is the purpose of this
paper to describe these probable Paleo-Indian materials and to discuss
some of the problems posed by them.
DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIMENS

b'

b

d

d'

Twenty-three Paleo-Indian projectile points are described and both
faces are illustrated. While most of them fit rather easily into previously described types, they have been sorted into descriptive groups,
each of which has been given a letter designation. Within each group,
the specimens are described, and the dimensions, material of manufacture, workmanship, and provenience are given; there is also a discussion of the type each group most closely resembles. Detailed measurements (in millimeters) are given for each specimen, using these
symbols: L: length; MW: maximum width; BW: basal width; and,
MT: maximum thickness. The abbreviation "PROV." is used to indicate the site provenience of the specimens. Incomplete measurements
are enclosed in parentheses; if the measurement is an estimate::! one,
the abbreviation "est." will appear. Some of the sites are designated
according to the trinomial system employed by The University of
Texas; for example, the site designation 41 AT 10 indicates that the
site is in Texas ( 41), in Atascosa County (AT), and is the tenth site
recorded in the county. Other sites, where detailed location and descriptive data are lacking, retain the quadrangle designations formerly
used by The University of Texas; 71 A4-1 is an example.

ndicate extent of smoothing.

No. of specimens: 9 (all fragmentary)
Outline form: Most are basal fragments; the more complete specin1ens have lanceolate outlines. Bases are concave on six specin1ens,
and straight on the others. The distal end of one specimen may have
been alternately beveled, but it is damaged and this cannot be determined with certainty. Another specimen has been reworked into a
drill (Fig. 5, c,c'); its lateral edges are somewhat damaged. Lateral
edge smoothing (near the base) is present on seven of the specimens,
and the extent of smoothing is indicated in Figs. 2 and 5.
Materials: All are made from flint (or chert). Colors include
translucent brown ( 2), light tan to cream ( 4), mottled gray ( 1),
and light brown (2).
Workmanship: Horizontal flaking is present on four, with finely
executed oblique flake scars on another. Flaking is irregular on the
other four specimens. Marginal retouching is evident on six of them.

Basal thinning has been accomplished by the removal of short, vertical
flakes on all specimens.
Discussion: These specimens fall within the range of the Angostura
type, as defined by Suhm, Krieger and Jelks ( 1954: 402). Some could
be included in the type as described by Hughes (1949: 270), ·wheeler
( 1954: 4) and Wormington ( 195 7: 269).
GROUP B
No. of Specimens: 5 ( 1 complete, 1 nearly complete, 3 fragments)
Outline form: They are lanceolate, with edges almost parallel near
the base, and then curving toward the distal encl. On all specimens,
the widest part is near midsection. The basal edges are markedly concave on tvvo specimens, and only slightly so on the others. The lateral
edges near the proximal ends are smoothed on all specimens, and the
basal edges are smoothed on two.

Materials: All are made of flint, with colors varying from light

Workmanship: Three exhibit very skillful chipping, with horizontal
to slightly oblique flake scars. The other two also show some parallel
chipping, but are less well-made, perhaps due to the quality of flint
used. Short vertical flakes, often crescentic or arc-shaped, have been
removed in thinning the base of each specimen. Fine marginal retouch
is present along the lateral edges of most specimens. One specimen,

corners are slightly flared on three specimens, and are more widely
flared on the other two. Basal thinning was accomplished through the
removal of short, vertical flakes forming a lunate pattern of flake scars
(see Johnson, 1964: 49). Maximum width occurs at midsection on
one specimen and at the base on the others. Edges are well-dulled near
the base.

* Maximum width of the blade. On these specimens, the actual maximum width
occurred at the base.

l\!Iaterial: Flint of the following colors was used in the manufacture
of these specimens: tan, pinkish-tan, mottled gray, mottled graybrown, translucent mottled brown.
Workmanship: Neat horizontal flake scars are present on two specimens, while flaking on the others is irregular. The blade on one specimen has been reworked to a crude point (Fig. 4,c,c'). A burin-like
facet is present at the break on one edge of another specimen (Fig.
4,a,a'), but this seems to be the result of impact, rather than an intentional blow. One specimen has been damaged by thermal-fracturing.
Discussion: Johnson ( 1964: 47-52) has defined the golondrina
variety of the Plainview type, and the specimens described here appear
to be good examples of that variety. He attributes the golondrina
specimens found at the Devil's Mouth Site (in Val Verde County,
Texas) to a "Late Paleo-Indian" occupation. Johnson also presents
some cli:;tributional data on golondrina (pp. 49-52).

Outline form: They have lanceolate outlines, with straight (nearly
parallel) edges near the base. The basal edges are deeply concave.
The parallel edges at the proximal end extend approximately onethird of the way up the blade (maximum width occurs at that point),
where they then converge toward the distal tip. The blade edges on
all three specimens are alternately beveled along the right edge. The
basal corners flare slightly on two specimens (as in the case of Group
C), but are not flared at all on the third. Lateral edges near the base
are smoothed.

Materials: The specimen illustrated in Fig. 5 (a,a') is made from a

other two specimens are made from tan and grayish-white flints.
Workmanship: Flaking near the base is good, but the blades are
rather crudely chipped, having a reworked appearance on two specimens. Flake scars are irregular. The bases on two are thinned in the
manner of Group C; short, vertical flakes have been removed from
the base of the third.
Discussion: The Meserve type, described by Davis (1953: 384),
Suhm, Krieger and Jelks (1954: 450) and Wormington (1957: 265)
include3 specimens similar to the ones described here. Two of the
projectile points described here (Fig. 4,f,f'; Fig. 5, a,a') might represent variants of the Plainview golondrina type; the other (Fig. 4,e,e')
may be a reworked Plainview specimen.

Workmanship: Oblique flake scars cover both faces. There seems
to have been an attempt at reworking the distal tip after it was broken.
The base is thinned by a series of short, vertical flakes on both sides,
making the base almost wedge-shaped in cross section.
Discussion: This specimen bears much resemblance to the Milnesand type, as described by Wormington (1957: 265) and Bell (1958:
54), though it seems to be somewhat more narrow than specimens
from the type site (Sellards, 1955: Figs. 98-100).

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

OTHER ARTIFACTS FROM SAN MIGUEL CREEK SITES
The author has briefly studied the non-Paleo-Indian artifact assemblages from eight San Miguel Creek sites. There are a variety of dart
points represented, including stemmed types reminiscent of Edwards
Plateau and Trans-Pecos cultures (Suhm, Krieger and Jelks, 1954:
53, 108) and unstemmed forms found commonly in southwest Texas
(Weir, 1956: 62-72); Nunley and Hester, 1966: 249). Tortugas occurs
at all of the sites; other major types include: Abasolo, Bell, (Sorrow,
Shafer and Ross, 1967: 12-14), Ensor, Fairland; Langtry, Lerma-like,
Pedernales, and miscellaneous unclassified expanding stem dart points.
Minor types found at the sites are listed in Table 1. Arrow points are
very rare; Perdiz 'Was found at one site, Scallorn at another, and
Fresno-like (triangular) at still another.
However, projectile points are a small part of the artifact assemblages examined from these sites. When all eight sites are compared,
there seems to be a great deal of uniformity in the assemblages, and
this is reflected primarily by the non-projectile point artifacts. Unifacial gouge-scrapers, called Clear Fork Planer-Gouges by Ray ( 1941:
154), and by the local name of Dimmit scrapers by Nunley and
Hester (1966: 238) were found at the sites as were bifacial gougescrapers (Ray's Clear Fork Gouge 1, 1941: 153). Often these tools
were found in large numbers. Other common items are heavy crude
choppers and core-choppers, triangular knives, a type of gouge with
the local name of Guadalupe or Attwater, ovate knives, unifacial
scrapers made on cortex flakes, lanceolate knives, and a series of
thick lanceolate, bipointed tools exhibiting both bifacial and unifacial
flaking. Several scrapers with trapezoidal outlines, bifacial flaking and
a single steeply-beveled edge were found at two sites. The name of
Nueces scraper has been suggested for this tool (Hester, unpublished
manuscript) .
While most of the dart points probably represent Archaic occupations, and the arrow points possible Neo-American habitation, it is
impossible to determine with certainty the age or cultural affiliation
of the non-projectile point artifacts with our present data. We can
speculate that the bulk of these artifacts might be attributable to
Archaic peoples, but some may be representative of earlier cultures.
Foremost among those of possible Paleo-Indian age are the unifacial
and bifacial gouge-scrapers. Epstein (ms.) has presented evidence that
at least some Clear Fork-like gouge-scrapers appeared "during terminal
Pleistocene times in North America". However, both the bifacial and
unifacial varieties occur widely on Archaic sites in southwest Texas
(Weir, 1956: 62; Nunley and Hester, 1966: 249; Hester, 1967b: 6-7)

and it seems probable that they were used during much of the Archaic
period.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Five groups of projectile points have been described and illustrated.
The groups appear to be stylistically representative of the follow.ing
Paleo-Indian types: Angostura, Plainview, Plainview golondnna,
Meserve, and Milnesancl. These specimens occurred on the surface at
sites along San Miguel Creek in Frio, Atascosa and McMullen Co1~nties
in southwestern Texas; they were accompanied by numerous artifacts
primarily attributable to Archaic occupations.
.
The possible late Paleo-Indian affiliation of the types ment10n~d
above has been suggested by many sources (Hughes, 1949; Davis,
1953; Wheeler, 1954; Suhm, Krieger and Jelks, 1954; Sellards, 1955;
Wormington, 195 7; Johnson, 1964) . Since the specimens discussed
here did occur in what seem to be predominantly Archaic sites, several
questions are posed. Do the Paleo-Indian projectile points represent
earlier (late Pleistocene) groups who camped at or near the same spot
later occupied by Archaic peoples? Diel the Archaic inhabitants pick
up the Paleo-Indian points as curios or as sources of i_naterial? Or,
were these late Paleo-Indian forms made and used clurmg the early
stages of the Archaic period in this area? These ~uestio1;1s and. other
problems pre3entecl by the presence of Paleo-Indian art1fa~ts m Archaic contexts have been discussed at length by Suhm, Krieger and
Jelks (1954: 104-106) in regard to central Texas. In southwest Texas
(which includes Frio, Atascosa, and McMullen Counties).' the author
has recorded numerous Plainview (and Plainview golondrma), Angostura and Meserve specimens (Hester, 1967a: 3-8; ms., "A Distribution~l Study of Paleo-Indian Projectile Points in Texas"). Most ~f
these occurred at large Archaic sites. Interestingly, Folsom and Clovis
points found in the same region also generally occur in an Archaic
context (Weir, 1956: 72; and, Hester, 1968: 117; "Paleo-Indian"
ms.). Since these early Paleo-Indian styles are found in this situation,
it would seem that either the Archaic peoples camped at (or near)
previous Paleo-Indian camping areas, thereby causing their .m~teria~s
to become mixed through erosional processes, or the Archaic mhabitants were occasionally picking up the Paleo-Indian points and bringing them to their camps. The latter suggestion may account for the fact
that some of the Paleo-Indian specimens in the area have been reworked into drills.
The non-Paleo-Indian assemblages at the San Miguel Creek sites
contain artifacts found in both central Texas and southwest Texas

Archaic site~ (Suhm, Krieger and Jelks, 1954: 108, 139, 141; Weir,
1956: 61-72; Nunley and Hester, 1966: 294). Tortugas is the dominant dart point type, but nun1erous stemmed and unstem1ned points
are also found. The greatest uniformity is found among the nonprojectile point implements. Unifacial and bifacial gouge-sc.rapers are
abundant, as are various forn1s of knives and scrapers.
At the pre3ent, the author doe3 not know of an isolated Paleo-Indian
camp3ite in southwe:;t Texas (as described by Suhm, Krieger, and
Jelks, 1954: 134, and 'Which consists of the counties of Frio, McMullen,
Atascosa, LaSalle, Zavala, Maverick, Dinnnit, Live Oak, Jim Wells,
Jim Hogg, Brooks, Starr, Hidalgo, Zapata and Webb); the PaleoIndian specimens re1Jorted from the area thus far were found either
at random or on Archaic site3. Since discrete Paleo-Indian components
have been found in adjoining regions (Alexander, 1963; Johnson,
1964; Dibble, 1968), it is to be expected that they will eventually be
found here.
