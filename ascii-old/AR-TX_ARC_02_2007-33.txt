ABSTRACT

The Brazos Valley Solid Waste Management Agency is proposing to
construct a landfill on a 609 acre tract that is located in west central
Grimes County. An archaeological survey of the tract located two
archaeological sites that had buried deposits which were considered
possibly significant. Testing was carried out at these two sites. The first
site (41GM410) is the location of a one-room frame house that was built
in the 1870s and abandoned sometime before 1900. The house had a rock
chimney and opposite it is a serpentine-shaped walkway made of
sandstone slabs. Besides an extensive nail rain and glass scatter in the
midden around the house foundation, other time-sensitive artifacts
included a Granite Ware cooking pot, a clay marble, and a Union Eagle
button. Archival research indicates that the house may have belonged to
Warren Goodin who owned the property between 1848 and 1877. Goodin
sold the property to Pru Stickney who owned it until 1901. Site 41GM410
is recommended for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places
and as a State Archeological Landmark.
Testing revealed that site 41GM412 was occupied during the Middle to
Transitional Archaic and that the ground surface was aggrading during this
period. No datable organic materials were found and no evidence of
cultural stratigraphy or features or of meaningful geologic stratigraphy
was uncovered in the 60-70 cm of the sandy mantle at the site. Due to the
absence of datable stratigraphy and the lack of features and preserved
organic materials, no further investigation is recommended and the site is
not recommended for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places.

INTRODUCTION
During April 2002, AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) conducted a pedestrian archaeological
survey of the proposed Twin Oaks Landfill site which is located in west central Grimes
County, Texas. The landfill site is included in a 609-acre tract that is owned by the
Brazos Valley Solid Waste Management Agency (BVSWMA) of College Station, Texas.
BVSWMA is a joint venture of the cities of College Station and Bryan and as such is a
public entity. The landfill site is located in the uplands of west central Grimes County
approximately 1.9 miles [3.1 km] east of the State Highway 30 [SH 30] crossing of the
Navasota River.
Four sites were recorded within the landfill site, and of these two, 41GM410 and
41GM412, were recommended for testing in order to determine their eligibility for
inclusion on the National Register of Historic Properties and as State Archeological
Landmarks (Skinner and Plumb 2002). The other two sites were not recommended for
testing and these recommendations were endorsed by the Texas Historical Commission.
Site 41GM410 is an historic residential site that was first recognized by an attractive
setting on a hill overlooking Alum Creek. An untraveled dirt road and a rusted out 1956
Pontiac station wagon body are on the west side of the site. No clear evidence of house
foundation stones was noted and only a few artifacts were on the slightly eroded surface.
A chimney hearth of shaped limestone rocks was present but no chimney rock fall was
apparent. A 4 cm in diameter metal rod is located in the center of the western edge of the
hearth. Testing uncovered a few square-cut nails and a Granite Ware pot was found
nearby. Based on this information, the site was tentatively dated to about AD 1870 and
was interpreted as a log cabin.
Site 41GM412 is a prehistoric site that was discovered when the original survey crew
found two flakes in a two track road between a deer feeding area and the fence line along
the eastern edge of the landfill property. The site sits on a level area that slopes down to
the north and east. Eight shovel tests were excavated in the process of site definition
Negative tests were excavated to the north, west and south and the site may extend
beyond the property fence to the east. Bedrock was encountered in each of the negative
units, but cultural materials mixed with pebbles were found in the five positive tests
which are in an east-west row across the center of the site area. The site area was defined
as being 40 meters east-west by 24 meters. Shovel tests encountered artifacts from the
surface to as deep as 60-70 cm below, but failed to find any evidence of vertical
stratification or of a distinct cultural deposit. In addition to lithic debris, part of what was
believed to be a slab-lined hearth made of poor quality sandstone was encountered in one
of the shovel tests. No evidence of datable materials was recovered and no diagnostic
artifacts were recovered.

The purpose of this investigation was to determine the significance of both sites which
will be destroyed during landfill construction and if significant to make recommendations
about how to mitigate their loss. The study is appropriate for state and federal permitting
for application for the creation of a solid waste landfill site. In addition, the Texas
Antiquities Code applies since BVSWMA is a public entity. This report has been
prepared for reviewed by the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission as
part of their Section 106 review process. The relevant federal legislation includes the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), and the Archeological and Historical
Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291).
This report was written in accordance with report guidelines adopted by the Texas
Historical Commission, Archeology Division, and developed by the Council of Texas
Archeologists (ND). The following report presents a brief description of the natural and
cultural environmental resources of the area. The research design and methodology and
then the results of the field testing follow. A section which offers recommendations
concludes the body of the report. A list of references cited follows. Exact site locations
are shown on the maps in this report and additional location information will be provided
to the Texas Historical Commission, the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory and
BVSWMA.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The study area is located in the Post Oak Savannah of Coastal Texas (Diamond, Riskind
and Orzell 1987:Figure 1). The topography of the area is mostly rolling uplands dissected
by numerous generally small and intermittent tributaries which ultimately flow into Alum
Creek on the north or Dinner Creek to the south and then into the Navasota River. The
post oak savannah encompasses the landfill site. Virtually all of the area is covered with a
sandy mantle which ranges in thickness from a few centimeters to more than two meters.
In most areas, the sandy mantle is less than a meter thick.
The Eocene-age Wellborn Formation which underlies the entire landfill tract (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1974) consists of sandstone and clay, and ranges up to 150+ feet in
thickness. The sandstone is composed of medium-grained quartz and is indurated and can
be massive and forms ledges in some places. Throughout the rest of the formation,
sandstone lenses are present along with clay and lignite. Gravel deposits are present on
top of the bedrock formation and probably correspond to Nordtâs (1983) fifth terrace. The
high gravels are fluviatile deposits dated to the Pleistocene. No Pleistocene sediments are
mapped in the landfill site by the Bureau of Economic Geology.
Site 41GM412 is situated on Burlewash fine sandy loam soils which formed in tuffaceous
shale and sandstone bedrock. The soil typically has a 6â thick A-horizon of dark grayish
brown fine sandy loam which rests on B-horizons that extend to thinly bedded tuffaceous
sandstone bedrock below 25â (Greenwade 1996:107). The B-horizons are brown to light
brown clay with moderately medium subangular blocky structure.
Shiro loamy fine sand underlies site 41GM410 and formed from tuffaceous sandstone
bedrock and has a pedon similar to Burlewash. The A and E-horizons are the same
thickness and extend to twelve inches. Both are pinkish gray in color and have no
structure. The Bt1-horizon is yellowish red clay that has faint light brownish gray
mottles. The underlying Bt2 and 3 horizons are a light gray clay that have a coarse and
subangular blocky structure. Sandstone bedrock is typically encountered below 31 inches.
All the drainages in the area, excluding Alum Creek, are mapped as intermittent
tributaries of Panther Creek. No evidence of reliable year-round springs was found but
seasonal springs where apparent at the time of the study.

CULTURE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Grimes County is included within the Southeastern Region of Texas (Moore 1989). The
earliest occupation expected in the county was probably during the Paleo-Indian period
and is expected to have been by ancient Native Americans who made very distinctive
Clovis points. However, very little evidence of Late Pleistocene occupation has been
reported from anywhere in the county or in the surrounding area.
Subsequent occupation during the Archaic period is characterized as a hunting and
gathering way of life practiced by mobile bands which occupied recognized group
territories. Dart points, grinding stones, and accumulations of burned rock characterize
Archaic site deposits. The fauna hunted and gathered by these early people was a truly
modern animal population. Habitation sites have been reported from settings in the
county that are along major drainages, while upland surveys have tended to find fewer
and smaller sites which are described as lithic procurement sites or temporary camps. An
abundance of Late Archaic sites is known from the Gibbons Creek area just to the east.
The Early Ceramic follows the Late Archaic and is distinguished regionally by the
appearance of pottery by about AD 100. The sandy paste pottery is found to be associated
with Gary and Kent dart points and ultimately with Scallorn arrow points. At Gibbons
Creek, numerous hearth features and stone tools were found with a small sample of sandy
paste pottery at site 41GM224 (Rogers 1995). The site was concluded to be a seasonally
occupied location and was dated at AD 710Â±70 using charred nut shells.
The Late Prehistoric period follows the Early Ceramic and is signaled by the presence of
pottery and arrow points which first appeared about AD 700 and continued in use into the
historic time period. Cemeteries are known to occur at some sites in the region, but none
have been reported in Grimes County. There is no evidence of major change in life style
that was brought about by the adoption of pottery and the bow and arrow, but the limited
investigations in the region limit any summary of the way of life.
Numerous historic Native American groups are known to have occupied this area, but the
archaeology of these indigenous peoples is virtually unknown. The area was first settled
by Europeans under the authority of Mexico in 1834 and was part of one of the original
Republic of Texas counties. Farming was the major means of support in the nineteenth
century. A more definitive description of the culture history of the area and of previous
investigations in adjacent Brazos County is contained in âPrehistoric and Historic
Occupation in Central Brazos County (Dering and Mason 2001). For Grimes County, the
reader is referred to the numerous references by Robert Rogers (1992, 1993, 1995) and
others involved with investigations at the Gibbons Steam Electric Station and Mine.
These sources provide a comprehensive review of these subjects.

Paleoclimatic research in the region has revealed a long, probably punctuated, warming
and/or drying trend over the last 10,000 years. The overall results of this climatic trend
was a decrease in trees, except for the oaks, and an increase in grasses and herbaceous
plants. Palynological data from bogs in the Post Oak Savannah have been interpreted as
showing that the present-day, oak-savannah vegetation regime was probably established
about 3,000 years ago (Thoms 1997). Based on historic accounts and archaeological data,
deer and wild root foods probably provided the bulk of the Native American diet
throughout the years of occupation, although bison were probably a regular supplement
to the diet when available.
The earliest inhabitants of the area that were recorded historically were the Bedai Indians.
They first appeared in the records of the Spanish explorers after 1691 and they also
traded with the French in the late 18th century. Disease reduced their population to less
than 100 in the early 19th century and records of their existence eventually disappeared by
the mid-19th century. The Tonkowa Indians were also in the area at the time the white
man settled in the County. The Tonkowa lived peacefully with the white man and may
have been helpful in reducing the number of raids on the white man by the Apache and
Comanche Indians. The last, fatal Indian raid in the County occurred in 1841. In 1854,
the U. S. established forces to curtail Indian raids and oust the Indians from Texas. This
ultimately resulted in only six Indians being recorded in the 1860 U.S. Census for Grimes
County (Jackson 2001).
Spanish explorers recorded coming through the area in 1767 and 1788 touring the
Spanish frontier and searching for better routes between San Antonio and other sites in
what was to become Texas and Louisiana (Jackson 2001).
Stephen F. Austin began the first Anglo settlement near the confluence of the Brazos and
Colorado Rivers in 1821. Andrew Millican settled in the area now known as Grimes
County along Holland Creek. By 1824, seven of Austinâs âOld Three Hundredâ had
claimed land in Grimes County. By 1836 and the Texas Revolution, 64 settlers had laid
claim to land in the area. Jared E. Groce in Austinâs Colony planted the first cotton in
Texas in 1822 and established the first cotton gin in 1825 near Hempstead in neighboring
Waller County (Jackson 2001).
In 1830, Grimes County was incorporated into the new Viesca District and in 1835
became a part of the newly organized Washington Municipality. The first post office
established in Grimes County was at the Fanthorp Inn in Anderson. Between March and
April 1836, many of Grimes Countyâs settlers fled eastward joining other settlers in the
âRunaway Scrapeâ to avoid the advancing Mexican Army. The Republic of Texas was
subsequently established and the area was quickly re-occupied after the Battle of San
Jacinto. The Republic of Texas organized Montgomery County in 1837 (Jackson 2001)
and the area that is now Grimes County was a part of it.
The Congress of the Republic of Texas voted for annexation to the United States on July
4, 1845, (Atkins 2001) and the U. S. Congress admitted The Republic of Texas to the
United States of America as the 28th State. A petition signed by local residents was
________________________________________________________________________

submitted to the First State Legislature requesting that Grimes County be established.
The petition was accepted and the County was established on April 6, 1846. Anderson
had been recently plated at the center of the County and was designated the County Seat.
Other counties that were later carved out of Grimes County included Madison from the
northern portion in 1853 and Waller from the southern portion in 1873 (Jackson 2001).
âOld Southâ plantation agriculture was practiced during the years following statehood
and the Civil War as most of the settlers were from the deep South and previously many
owned slaves. The 1850 Census showed a county population of 4,008: 2,326 white, 1,680
black slaves, and 2 free blacks. Cotton and corn were the crops under cultivation and
2,202 bales of cotton were produced that year. Large herds of cattle, hogs and sheep
along with 231 mules and 1,193 oxen (a ratio of less than 20%) were also reported. Less
than 20% of the land was reported to be farmland. This would indicate that the land was
still being broken for cultivation. By 1860, the Census showed a county population of
10,320 with 52.9% being black. However, the ratio of oxen to mules had dropped to 40%
and more than half of the County was reported as farmland. Cotton and corn were still the
most significant crops with 18,303 bales of cotton produced. There were 39,000 head of
cattle, a total that would not be achieved again for 80 years. Sheep were at an all-time
high of 18,000 head (Jackson 2001).
Spas were located in Kellum Springs and at Piedmont Springs in 1850. Piedmont Springs
built an opulent 100-room hotel in 1860 to accommodate the guests frequenting the spa.
The first railroad (the Houston & Texas Central) arrived in Navasota in September 1859
(GCHC 1982). However, with the turmoil of the approaching Civil War, prosperity was
halted in Grimes County for several years. A vote was held in February 1861 to
determine if Texas should secede from the Union. The vote was 907 to 9 in favor of
Secession and hundreds of Grimes County volunteers joined Confederate forces. (GCHC
1982).
The Civil War brought changes to many cities and counties in the South. An ammunition
factory was built for the war effort in 1861 near Anderson. The war brought the first
telegraph lines to the County through Navasota for use by the Confederate Government
and the railroad in 1862. In 1863, General Magruder established his Headquarters in the
Piedmont Springs Hotel. The population of blacks in the county had grown to 7,005 by
1864 due to black refugees seeking protection from Northern aggression. The elegant
ballroom of the Piedmont Springs Hotel was converted for use as a hospital in 1865.
Additionally, after the defeat of the Confederacy in 1865, disgruntled confederate
veterans raided a cotton and munitions warehouse in Navasota, which resulted in an
explosion and fire that nearly destroyed the entire downtown commercial district.
Although the war was over, trials and tribulations did not cease. Most landowners and
farmers in the South lost great sums of money after the war. Grimes County landowners
were no exception as no farm retained the 1860 values for fifty years. Epidemics of
cholera and yellow fever killed hundreds of county residents in 1866 and 1867, and
Federal troops were garrisoned in Millican, Brazos County over Brazos, Grimes, and
other surrounding counties to control the lawlessness. Not all was bad, however. In June
1866, The Freedmanâs Bureau established educational institutions for blacks in Anderson

and Navasota. The 1870 Census reported a county population of 13,218. Sixty percent of
the county residents were black and many had been refugees that stayed in the County
after the war (GCHC 1982).
Cattle and livestock population in the decade between 1870 and 1880 was half of that in
1860, but by 1890 had exceeded the 1860 number. Cattle for beef and milk production
have been an important part of the Grimes County economy since the mid-19th Century.
From 1890 through 1940, the cattle population was fairly stable at around 40,000 head.
The peak of cattle population was reached in 1969 with 79,094 head. By 1987, the cattle
population was just over 50,000 head. In 1982, there were 650 dairy farms in the County
and the cattle and dairy industries accounted for 93% of the Countyâs agricultural
income. By the 1970âs, cattle had all but replaced the cotton industry in Grimes County.
Hog and sheep production has remained fairly constant since the 1920âs.
Cotton production in 1900 yielded 30,809 bales. The 1926 agricultural figures showed
90,000 acres in cultivation and a cotton yield of 31,000 bales (GCHC 1982). By 1930,
there was a record 81,937 acres in cotton production alone. Cotton gins were located
throughout the County with a high of 25 gins reported in the 1920âs (GCHC 1982). By
1940, the acreage had been reduced by 53% to 38,726 acres with a yield of only 16,031
bales, slightly more than half of the 1900 figure. The Countyâs most important crop since
the decline in cotton production is corn (Jackson 2001).
The primary industry in the County during the 1800âs was agriculture. Lumbering has
been a part of the countyâs economy since the mid-19th century as forty percent of Grimes
County is covered in forests. Sawmills have been in the County since that time and much
of the timber production since the Civil war has been cordwood. Sawmills are second
only to the cotton gin in industrial development in Grimes County (Jackson 2001).
Previous Investigations
From 1993 to 1994 numerous sites were excavated at the Gibbons Creek Lignite Mine in
Grimes County, Texas. Investigations conducted between May and December of 1993
were done at sites 41GM166, 41GM281 and 41GM282. Between January and March of
1994 investigations at sites 41GM370 and 41GM374 were conducted. In May of 2006
archaeological testing of a prehistoric site 41GM416 south of the Gibbons Creek Lignite
Mine was conducted.
Site 41GM166 is located on a toe-slope, back-slope and summit of a south-trending
interfluve above Peach Creek (Rogers 1995: 20). The site has a Paleo-Indian component
that was based upon several Dalton points that were recovered. Overlying the paleocomponent are prehistoric occupations of Archaic and Early Ceramic ages. The intension
of the excavation was to isolate the Paleo-Indian occupation but this was not possible due
to post-depositional events related to bioturbation (Rogers 1995: 56).
Site 41GM281 is a Late Prehistoric site located on a toe-slope along the lower reaches of
Peach Creek about 1.4km upstream from its confluence with Gibbons Creek (Rogers

1995: 57). Occupation dates between A.D. 1150 and 1400. The arrow point assemblage is
dominated by Perdiz points with approximately 100 complete or almost complete
specimens recovered along with large amounts of pottery (Rogers 1995: 143).
Site 41GM282 is located on a toe-slope about 100 m from the main channel of Peach
Creek (Roger 1995: 144). The site was excavated to isolate the Early Ceramic component
previously discovered in testing of the site but failed to do so. However, the site produced
3,530 prehistoric artifacts including 13 Perdiz and an Ellis point. With the location of the
site so close to 41GM281, the similar occurrence of similar-aged materials strengthens
their argument for short term occupation at both sites (Rogers 1995: 164).
Site 41GM370 is located on nearly level terrain on the lower back-slope of a south-facing
interfluve about 100 m northwest of an unnamed tributary of Peach Creek. Excavated
from the site were 589 prehistoric artifacts including one Perdiz and numerous prehistoric
Goose Creek Plain ceramic sherds. Excavation at the site discovered that twentieth
century activities severely affected the integrity of the deposits (Rogers and Foster 1994:
29). All units displayed evidence of disturbance.
Site 41GM374 contained prehistoric deposits attributed to Late Paleo-Indian and Late
Prehistoric periods. The site is located on a slope of a south trending interfluve that
terminates on a projection which is bound on east and west sides by an intermittent
tributary of Peach Creek (Rogers and Foster 1994: 43). The siteâs composition was
altered due to post-depositional forces related to bioturbation. Artifact density at the site
was relatively low to moderate with four complete dart points and several fragments
recovered. The only identifiable points within the assemblage were Gary and San Patrice.
Site 41GM416 is located on a knoll that is what remains of a finger ridge that was cut
down by the construction of FM 3090 and a railroad line. The site yielded several dart
points dating to the Late Prehistoric period along with two earlier dart points but no
discrete Archaic component was identified (Skinner et al. 2006:10-21). The sites matrices
were also mixed and bioturbated.

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY

The purpose of the research design outlined below was to insure that the investigation
would determine the significance of the two sites and at the same time make a
contribution to a better understanding of prehistoric and historic settlement in west
central Grimes County within the lower Navasota River Watershed.
It was our opinion that site 41GM412 was possibly a Late Archaic residential camp
occupied repeatedly by small task groups during the fall season for hunting deer and
harvesting nuts. The site is located at considerable distance from the Navasota River
floodplain and water may have been available in Alum Creek. The site was described as
being 40 m E/W by 24 m in area and having a buried deposit that extends from the
surface to as deep as 60-70 cm. At least one slab-lined hearth was located during the
original survey. Occupation apparently occurred on a slowly aggrading surface and
features such a rock or clay hearths, rock accumulation from hearth cleaning, or storage
pits were expected to have occurred at depths which mark occupation surfaces or in
deposition zones where stone tools and other artifacts will be concentrated. We expected
that occupation surfaces/zones would yield a limited variety of stone tools and lithic
debris representing either the manufacturing or the repair of chipped stone tools.
It was our opinion that site 41GM410 is what remained of a log cabin that was built or
lived in during the 1870âs. The site is described as being 30 m E/W by 45 m in area. The
base of a chimney constructed with sandstone blocks is all that remains on the surface. A
half-gallon Granite Ware cooking pot which dates to the 1870âs was encountered
adjacent to the site. We expected to find more sandstone blocks as piers in the corners of
the cabinâs original location. Historic debris in the form of nails, glass and ceramics was
expected within the cabin floors and/or surrounding the cabin and was expected in
association to a possible cistern or outhouse.
In order to evaluate these hypotheses, the following methodology was followed
throughout the investigation with minor modifications.
A 1 meter grid system was established at each site and extended beyond the site limits. A
base map was prepared at the beginning of each field investigation, and was then updated
throughout the field season. Excavation was done using 1 m square units that were
excavated in 10 cm levels. Excavated matrix was screened through 1/4â (6.25 mm) mesh,
except when selected samples were washed through fine window screen at 41GM412.
These techniques were designed to recover micro-debris, seeds, nuts, and faunal
fragments, and it was anticipated that they would be used in conjunction with excavation
of occupation surfaces and cultural features. After drying, the matrices were sorted into
appropriate analytical categories.

At site 41GM410, a metal detection survey of the site area was conducted. It was
anticipated that locating metal artifact concentrations would help in determining the
limits of the structure and exterior work/discard areas. The tall grasses in the site area
were cleared for the purpose of exposing sandstone on the surface.
At site 41GM412, additional shovel tests were excavated before unit excavation was
conducted. It was anticipated that this would further define the limits of the site and
provide added information on the artifact density of the site. Prior to testing a thick grove
of yaupon hollies that covered the eastern half of the site was cleared. Several geologic
test units were hand dug without screening to investigate the occurrence of degraded
sandstone above the sandstone bedrock. Backhoe trenching was not conducted due to the
shallow depth of the archaeological deposits and the presence of sandstone bedrock.
All recovered material was bagged and labeled by unit and level. A small label with
provenience data was placed in each zip lock bag. Features were recorded on site level
forms along with profiles and photographs. Collected cultural materials were initially
washed and labeled. Besides providing basic descriptive data for site comparisons, the
analysis procedures provided information directly relevant to the research questions
outlined above.
Stone tools were separated from lithic debris as the first step in the analysis. Tools were
categorized using formal tool types and were individually analyzed. Raw material is one
of many variables that was recorded. Lithic debris analysis separated cores from flakes,
and shatter. The terms primary [debitage pieces with 100% cortex coverage of the dorsal
surface], secondary [debitage pieces with greater than 0% and less than 100% cortex
coverage of the dorsal surface], and tertiary [interior] flakes [debitage pieces with 0%
cortex coverage of the dorsal surface] were used to evaluate the reduction process.
Using the same basic model that was utilized by Skinner (1971) in the De Cordova Bend
excavations, tool making stages were interpreted by the percentages of primary,
secondary and interior lithic debris recovered from the site. An assemblage that is
composed of 5 to 15 % primary, 60 to 70 % secondary and 20 to 40 % interior flakes and
chips would represent the initial steps of cortex removal (Skinner 1971:159). If the
assemblage were to have had an increased number of interior flakes and chips with 5%
primary, 55% secondary and 40% interior, than it could be assumed that finer core
reduction took place. An assemblage that has as many interior flakes as secondary flakes
with few primary flakes would represent a more advanced stage of thinning and
reduction.
Using Randall Moirâs model (Moir 1988: 263-271) on distinguishing window glass from
bottle glass, the glass assemblage was separated into window, bottle and chimney glass.
According to Moir, the small flat glass (less than 20 mm in length) does not exhibit any
measurable differences in thickness in cross section. Nearly all window glass is tinted
with a slight green, grayish green, or bluish green hue rather than absolutely clear. The
glass was then separated by color and examined for rims or any other glass features.

RESULTS
Introduction
In the original survey report for the SH30 Landfill, two prehistoric (41GM409,
41GM412) and two historic sites (41GM410, 41GM411) were discovered. AR
Consultants recommended further testing be done at sites 41GM410 and 41GM412.
Testing of site 41GM410 began with a metal detector survey and continued with
excavation of 13 test units. Test units [TU is used as an abbreviation throughout] were
excavated to a depth where artifact density showed a dramatic decrease, to bedrock or to
expose a feature. Bedrock was encountered at a shallow depth (20 cmbs) close to the
hearth but was encountered at a depth of 38 cm nine meters north of the hearth on the
surface 15 meters north of the hearth. A sandstone rock chimney base that is almost
square in plan view was the only feature recognized within the site but several pieces of
sandstone located primarily north of the chimney base may be remnants of foundation or
footing stones.
Fifteen additional shovel tests were first excavated at 41GM412 and then six test units
and three geologic test units were dug. Ten of the shovel tests were augured to bedrock.
Fill from the three geologic test units were excavated to bedrock but were not screened.
Profiles were recorded of the units.

Site 41GM410
The archival history of the property on which site 41GM410 rests is first reviewed below
and this is followed by a description of the findings of the subsurface metal detection
survey and then by excavation. Artifacts are mentioned in the excavation text but are then
described in detail in the following section. The significance of the site deposit is then
discussed and placed into the context of mid-late nineteenth century Grimes County
archaeology. Recommendations are presented in the following chapter.
Historic Land Use
The archival history of the property was research by going to the Grimes County
Courthouse in Anderson, Texas. The Courthouse itself was constructed in 1893 and
withstood two fires which damaged some of the records. The County records are now
housed in a small three room structure a block from the courthouse. The deed/title
records were well maintained easily followed and is presented below. However the tax
assessment records prior to the mid 1900âs were in poor condition with pages burned,
missing and scattered. Only the 1897 and 1898 tax assessment records were found to be
clearly readable. Probate message records from the late 1800âs and early 1900âs were
checked to see if there were any comments made over a house on the property.

Unfortunately there was no census information found to be in the archive, but the 1850
and 1860 census information for Grimes County is available online.
Deed/Title records
The site of the proposed land fill is comprised of 29 tracts of land that are located within
three Grimes County surveys: The George W. Seaton Survey, A 409, The J. T. Robinson
Survey, A 390, and The G. A. Mason Survey, A 342. The majority of the 29 tracts were
most recently owned by Mr. Harold Trant, who acquired the land from his fatherâs estate.
He was awarded 35 tracts of land totaling approximately 471 acres in a partition suit that
divided his fatherâs land holdings (GCDR 1991). The majority of the 471 acres are
located in Grimes County and the tracts of particular interest are located in the J. T.
Robinson Survey, A 390 (GCDR 1991). Some of the tracts have been leased by members
of the Trant family since the late 19th and early 20th centuries (Trant 2002). Much of that
land was used for cotton production during that time (Trant 2002) and there was a cotton
gin on the property in the late 1800âs (Trant 2002; GCHC 1982), which was likely owned
by Phillip Trant (GCHC 1982). The land has been primarily used for cattle production
since the 1920âs, but the land has also been leased for petroleum production and
transmission since the 1970âs (Trant 2002).
The tract within the site that is of particular archaeological interest is a 20-acre tract that
was most recently owned by Colby S. Muth (GCDR 1994). The history of this tract
began when Joseph T. Robinson originally surveyed the 4,428-acre land grant in 1839
(GCDR 1839) and The Republic of Texas conveyed the land to Francis Zellner that same
year. On July 24, 1846, Francis Zellner sold 500 acres of the land to George Patillo
(GCDR 1846/1901). It is within this 500-acre tract that the Muth 20-acre tract is located.
Patillo sold this 500-acre tract to Warren Goodin in 1848 (GCDR 1848). Goodin may
have lived on the land and farmed it, or had family members or workers living on it and
farming it during the 29 years that he owned it (Trant 2002). Goodin sold 100 acres of the
land to Pru Stuckey in 1877 (GCDR 1877). The Stuckey family owned the land for nearly
24 years and may have also lived on the land and farmed it during that time (Trant 2002).
Stuckeyâs descendantâs sold the property to James G. McDonald in 1901 (GCDR 1901).
The McDonaldâs owned the land for nearly 40 years and they may have also lived on the
land and farmed it during that time (Trant 2002). McDonaldâs descendants sold forty
acres to R. P. Trant in 1940 (GCDR 1940). Trant used the property for cattle production
(Trant 2002). Twenty of the 40 acres were sold Fryxell in 1987 (GCDR 1987). The
property was used for cattle production at this time as well (Trant 2002). The 20 acretract was sold in 1994 to Muth (GCDR 1994) who used it for cattle production.
Tax Assessment/Probate messages/Census
The tax assessment records were in poor condition as mentioned above. The 1897 records
showed that a member of the Stuckey family owned 98 acres and a value was assessed
for the land (GCTR 1897). Unfortunately the records for the next year (1898) had no
mention of the Stuckey family and it is believed that a portion of this record is missing or

damaged according to the County Clerk. With no other land values to compare, the tax
assessment records are not useful in this case. The County Clerk suggested that the
Probate message records might have information over structures on the land that was left
after someone died. So these records were checked by search for any member of the
Stuckey, Goodin or McDonald families. Several messages were found in regards to
James McDonald and L.M. Stuckey but there was no mention of a house in either
message.
The County Clerk could not locate any Census information dating from the mid to late
1800âs to the early 1900âs but suggested that some of this information might be online.
The access genealogy website has the 1850 Census for Grimes County which has Pru
Stuckey listed as a 15 year old Male that was born in Mississippi along with his two
brothers 29 year old Robert and 12 year old Tad Stuckey (Census 1850). Mahaly
Stuckey, a 33 year old woman is presumed to be Pruâs mother and Daniel Stuckey, a 50
year old farmer is presumed to be his father. Pru would have been 42 years of age when
he bought the 100 acres from Goodin in 1877 (Census 1850).
Additional Sources
An article was discovered that documents the many descendants of Christopher Chaney,
Texas Patriot. In this article Christopher Chaneyâs youngest daughter Ellen marries Prue
Stuckey, the son of Daniel Stuckey in 1855 (Ports Nd). This confirms what the 1850
census suggests that Prue is the son of Daniel Stuckey. Prue later serves as a private in
Captain George Freemanâs Cavalry Company, Pedernales Home Guard, 31st Brigade of
Texas Militia in 1861 (Ports Nd). On March 19, 1862, Prue joins the Confederacy as a
private in Company C, 16th Texas Infantry. The Infantry first saw combat in northeastern
Louisiana in 1863. Prue was captured at Pleasant Hill in 1864 and exchanged at Blairâs
Landing later that year. Prue disbanded in later 1865 and returned to Grimes County. It
was during or soon after the war that Prue divorced his wife Ellen and was finalized in
1871 (Ports Nd). Based upon the deed records Prue Stuckey purchased 100 acres of the
land where this historic residential site is located in 1877 from Warren Goodin and lived
and farmed it till the early 1900âs (GCDR 1877).
While this information does not determine that this residential site was indeed Prue
Stuckeyâs residence it does present a viable argument for Prue being the builder of the
site. However, it is possible that the structure could have been built by Warren Goodin
even though he does not show up in the 1860 Census for Grimes County Texas.
Metal detection
Metal detection was utilized at site 41GM410 to discover if metal artifact concentrations
exist at the site. These concentrations could help in identifying areas of nail fall which
might indicate where a structure had been. A White Promaster 6000 metal detector
provided by Sonny Wheeler was used for the metal detection survey. Metal detection was
conducted on five meter transects sweeping the ground from south to north. Individual
anomalies were then excavated and when artifacts were located they were mapped,

collected, the location flagged and the depth recorded (Figure 2). All of the artifacts were
excavated from between 5 and 23 centimeters below the surface (cmbs).
A total of 17 metal artifacts were recovered during the survey (Table 1). Recovered were
three square-cut nails, two hoe heads, an axe head, a mule shoe, part of two 12 gauge
shotgun shells, a two-ring bullet, a Dutch-oven lid and six miscellaneous pieces of metal.

Figure 2.

Sketch map showing the locations of metal detection artifacts.

A complete Dutch oven-lid was recovered from the metal detection. The top of the lid
was too corroded to make out the manufacture marking. The head of a western style
felling axe was recovered (Barlow 2003:27) and it appears to have been manufactures

after 1877 (Sloane 2002). Two different heads to a hoe were also recovered from the
metal detection. The first head of a hoe has a round hole for the wooden handle attached
to the blade. The end of the blade has rusted away leaving only a small portion of it
intact. The second head of a hoe is much larger and has a long spike where the wooden
handle was attached. The blade is significantly larger than the other hoe, but both are
presumed to be common garden hoes.

Both of the shotgun shells were identifiable with the letters âU.M.C. Coâ written across
the top and âCLUBâ across the bottom. The number 12 was also written across the center
of the shells making both shells Union Metallic Cartridge Company 12 Gauge. The
Union Metallic Cartridge Company was organized in 1867 and merged with Remington
Arms Company in 1910 as Remington-UMC (Fontana and Greenleaf 1962: 80,
Remington 2007). Thus the shells were manufactured between 1867 and 1910.
All three square-cut nails are common cut nails (Lovelady 1983). Two of the three are 6d
sized nails and one is a 9d nail. Common cut square nails were utilized primarily from the
mid- to late 1800âs to the early 1900âs. It was around 1902 that wire nails became a
standard with cut nails continuing to be made for special purposes only (Fontana and
Greenleaf 1962: 50).
The two-ring bullet has been flattened with one side of the bullet have two
distinguishable rings encircling the bottom half. The opposite side of the bullet is
indistinguishable. This bullet is believed to be a .54 caliber carbine two ring bullet.

Metal detection provided general information about where metal concentrations are
located. The results indicated that concentrations exist north as well as southeast of the
hearth. This information assisted in determining where to test.
Testing
As mentioned above, a meter grid system was established over the site and a temporary
datum was set at the southeast corner of the existing hearth (Figure 3). Test units were
designated with a N/S and E/W number based on the site being entirely within the NE
quadrant. A 15 meter area surrounding the hearth was cleared of tall grasses using a weed
eater and blower. Rock exposed on the surface was flagged and mapped.

Figure 3.

Plan map of site 41GM410.

The first test unit (125N, 125E) was placed directly south of the hearth to determine if a
wall foundation extended out from the chimney or if chimney rock fall was present below

the surface. The unit was excavated to a depth of 30 cmbs where a very dark grayish
brown (10YR 3/2) loamy sand was encountered with chimney rock fall covering the
entire unit floor. The stones were the same relative size of those left exposed on the
surface, so it became apparent that a portion of the chimney had collapsed. Another TU
(126N, 123E) was placed west of the hearth (Figure 4) to see if chimney fall was present
or if a wall foundation could be discovered. The unit exposed more chimney fall but no
foundation stones. Although the chimney fall clearly fell to the south and west,
insufficient rock was present to have been from a chimney higher than three feet tall. It is
probable that some rock was scavenged after the structure was abandoned. Test unit
126N, 127E was placed a meter east of the hearth to see if the chimney fall extended in
that direction and explore the possibility of there being a foundation wall present. The
unit exposed sandstone bedrock at around 20 cmbs in well over half the unit but no
foundation was found. Square-cut nails and small glass and ceramic pieces were
recovered in each of these units.

Figure 4.

Looking north across the site. Test unit 126N, 123E is to the left of the
rock hearth.

In clearing vegetation from the northeast part of the site, a row of flat rock extending
E/W was exposed five meters north of the hearth (Figure 5). It was first believed to be a
wall foundation. Test units were placed east (134N, 128E) and west (134N, 125E) of the
rock row and exposed more of a rock feature. TU 134N, 125E was excavated to 10 cm
but found that the rock did not continue into this unit. The unit was then excavated
another two levels to a total depth 30 cmbs (Figure 6) in which the artifact count

decreased dramatically and sandstone bedrock was encountered. The northeast corner of
the unit was then excavated to bedrock at 38 cmbs. TU 134N, 128E was excavated to 20
cmbs but the surface rock did not continue to the east (Figure 7). The test unit
encountered a much more compact cemented sandy loam matrix at the beginning of the
second level. The unit was terminated based upon the lack of surface rock, and the
presence of the cemented matrix.

The two units that separated 134N, 125E and 134N, 128E were opened to further expose
the surface rock feature. Both test units 134N, 126E and 134N, 127E encountered flat
rocks just below the surface. Both were excavated to 10 cmbs. Unit 134N, 126E
encountered flat rock primarily in the southeast corner of the unit, while in TU 134N,
127E the flat rock covered the majority of the unit. While these rocks present an
undulating surface, they are all lying with a relatively smooth flat surface facing up; the
undulating is attributed to the sand matrix and gopher holes. A unit (135N, 127E) was
opened north of 134N, 127E. Only two flat rocks were noted in this unit along with a
large portion of degrading sandstone exposed in the center of the unit. Two more test
units (133N, 126E and 133N, 127E) were opened to continue to explore the rock surface
feature. Both units exposed more of the same rock but in 133N, 127E rock was only
found in the northwest corner of the unit with a few pieces extending west. An elongated
piece of petrified wood was utilized as a part of this rock surface in unit 133N, 126E and
was approximately 20 cm in length and 10 cm wide. No other petrified wood was found
in the rock surface feature. Fragmentary bottle glass and occasional cut nails were found
in and around the stones.

The rock surface appeared to continue to the west so an adjacent unit (133N, 125E) was
opened. This unit revealed more of the flat rock surface. The rock seemed to end between
10 and 15 cm from the west wall and continued to progress south into the next unit which
was opened (132N, 125E). The rock surface continued into the northeast corner of the
unit showing that it might continue east and possibly west but appeared to stop 10+ cm
from the south wall. A large stone was uncovered in this unit measuring 50 by 35 cm
making it one of the largest stones present and possibly being a stepping stone into the
house. It appeared as though the rock possibly continued to the west, so half a unit was
placed west of 132N, 125E but found there to be a single flat rock that might not be
associated with this rock surface. It was concluded that this feature represents a
serpentine walkway which may have led up the front door of the house.
Several other flat and rounded rocks were noted on the surface of the site. Two such
rocks were located 4 meters west of the hearth. The two rocks were in line with each
other so a unit was placed directly north of the two rocks to see if these might be
associated with a foundation or another rock surface. Test unit 128N, 121E was
excavated to a depth of 20 cmbs and six large rocks were uncovered but none were laying
flat or formed a wall. A brass Union Eagle button was excavated from this unit along
with numerous pieces of glass and nails.
No evidence of a subterranean cistern or other buried features was discovered at the site.
While none of the test pits exposed a foundation wall, the flat rock surface feature (Figure
8) is presumed to be a walkway that indicates the original house was located between the
walkway and the chimney base. Thus the house is estimated to have been 12-14 feet wide
and was probably somewhat longer east-west.

Identifiable metal objects recovered from site 41GM410 included nails (both square-cut
and wire), two hoe heads, an axe head, a mule shoe, four 12 gauge shotgun shells, a tworing bullet, a Dutch-oven lid. Various pieces of unidentifiable oxidized metal were also
recovered.
A total of 245 nails were recovered from the site. The assemblage consists of 127 squarecut nails, 2 wire nails and 116 nail fragments [most of which are from cut nails]. The
majority of the square nails-cut are 6, 7, 8 and 12 penny nails (Table 3). One of the wire

nails measured 1 Â¼â and the other measured 3 3/8â in length. At John Wardâs Ranch in
southern Arizona, the authors concluded (Fontana and Greenleaf 1962) that the presence
of less than twenty percent wire nails indicated construction around the 1880âs -1890âs.
This is amplified by Nelson (1968) and discussed by Richner (1992:41) and others (Gillio
et al 1980). This date was further refined by Walker (1980:352) who presents a date of
1888 when less than 20% wire nails are present. This being the case, site 41GM410 dates
before 1888. Jurney (1987:90 and Figure 6-2) indicates that these dates are not old
enough for Richland Creek sites and should be five to fifteen years older, this further
pushes occupation at site 41GM410 closer to or into the 1870s.

The nail rain from the site consists primarily of 6-8 penny nails which measure 5.1 to 7.0
cm in length as shown on Jurneyâs conversion chart (1987:84). Nails this size were used
primarily for holding wall board and wall battens on a structure. They would not have
been used as shake roofing nails (Jurney 1987:83). Based on the Richland Creek study, it
is most likely that the structure at site 41GM410 was a frame structure and may have had
a covered wood roof rather than a shake shingle roof.
The metallic lower portions of two more shotgun shells were recovered during testing.
Three of the four shells have âU.M.C. Coâ written across the top and âCLUBâ across the
bottom. The final shell has âU.M.C. Coâ written across the top but âNEW CLUBâ across
the bottom. All four are Union Metallic Cartridge Company 12 Gauge shotgun shells that
have a relative date between 1867 and 1910 (Remington 2007).
A total of 149 pieces of glass were recovered. Using Randall Moirâs model for
distinguishing between flat/window glass and vessel/bottle glass, the assemblage
produced 137 pieces of bottle glass, 4 pieces of window glass and 8 pieces of chimney
glass. The four window glass pieces had thicknesses of 2.9 mm, 2.7mm, 1.5 mm, and 1.3
mm. According to Moirâs predictive model for dating lower to middle class rural
dwellings, the 2.9 and 2.7 mm pieces would date from 1920 to 1980+ (Moir 1988:271).

The glass measuring 1.5 mm in thickness dates to 1840 while the 1.3 mm piece dates to
the 1830âs. The later two have relative dates comparable to the general dates taken from
the site. When analyzing the two thicker pieces of window glass it became apparent that
they could have been bottle glass. Both pieces were smaller than 20 mm in length and
both were flat with a slight greenish hue, which fits Moirâs model for flat glass. But the
dates do not match with anything excavated at the site. The previous owner of the land,
Harold Trant was quoted saying that he had no recollection that evidence of a house was
ever present nor that his father told him that a house had once been present (Skinner and
Plumb 2002:30). So it seems unlikely that the glass found in excavation was from the
middle to late 1900âs.
The glass assemblage consists of aqua, amber, black/dark olive, brown, clear, light green
and violet colored glass. The amount of each of these colors in the assemblage is shown
on table 4. The colors are important in that some can be used for dating purposes. The
violet colored glass indicates a strong manganese content that was used to decolorize the
glass and was used primarily during the late nineteenth century and early twentieth
century. Manganese was replaced by selenium to decolorize glass around the 1920âs
which is identified by its amber color. Black/dark olive glass was primarily used for wine
and champagne bottles between 1850 and 1890. Brown glass used for bottles became
popular in the mid- to late 1800âs. The assemblage shows an abundance of brown and
clear glass colors including 8 pieces of clear chimney glass, which suggest a general midto late 1800âs time frame.
The glass assemblage contained no clearly identifiable bottle necks or bottoms to bottles.
Also no bottles with two piece molds were recovered. The glass fragments were all fairly
small throughout the assemblage.

A total of 68 ceramic sherds were recovered from the site. The majority of sherd types
were stoneware and a variety of white, fine earthenware. Both types are typically dated
from the mid-18th into the 19th century (Potter, Pantermuehl and Fox 2006; Rosenberg
and Kvietok 1981). The stoneware sherds have two different glazes, the first a grey salt
glaze and the second a brown salt glaze to the interior and exterior of the sherds. The
types of fine earthenware sherds are whiteware, ironstone, and semi-porcelain. Only two
sherds were decorated, the first being a small rim sherd with a blue transferware design

that probably dates between 1850-1880, and the second was a stoneware body piece that
has an incised mark âT(?)XAâ on the exterior, presumed to be âTEXASâ.
There were 18 diagnostic rim and base sherds. The vessel types that may have been
present would have been stoneware storage jars, crocks, jugs and bottles. The diagnostic
sherds of fine earthenware appear to have been cups, saucers, bowls and plates. Within
the assemblage there was one narrow porcelain rim sherd which could have been from a
small bottle.
Testing recovered four buttons, half of a bead and a marble (Figure 9). The first button
recovered is a mother-of-pearl shell button (Figure 9d). The button is 18.8 mm in
diameter and 3.3 mm thick. The four holes in the center of the button appear uniform,
suggesting that the button was machine-made. Machine-made shell buttons were
introduced in Birmingham around the mid-nineteenth century (Epstein 1990:60). The
second button is a small glaze covered porcelain button (Figure 9b). This button was
hand-made based upon the dimpling around the center holes on the back side. The
dimpling occurred when the button was held while covering its surface with a glaze. The
button is 10 mm in diameter and 2.3 mm thick. Porcelain buttons were made from the
eighteenth century to the present and eighteenth century porcelain buttons are scarce. A
much wider variety of these buttons were produced during the mid-nineteenth century
(Epstein 1990:50). A shoe button was recovered from the site. The shoe button (Figure
9a) is 10 mm thick and has a small metal loop on the back. The shoe button was typically
sewed on leather and fabric top shoes for fastenings (Luscomb 1992:183).

The fourth button excavated from the site is a brass Union Eagle button (Figure 10). The
button is 18.7 mm in diameter and 5.1 mm thick. The front of the button shows an eagle
with a shield in the center of the eagle. The back of the button has âExtra Qualityâ written
with âExtraâ across the top and âQualityâ across the bottom with three stars separating
the two words on either side. The trademark is common and does not specify the
manufacturer, so a specific date for the button could not be determined (Albert 1976:4041). However, the button is a Civil War/Indian War era general service button. A similar
button was found at the Camp Ford site in Smith County, Texas. The button has the same
eagle design with âExtra/Qualityâ written across the back (Thoms 2000:141). The only
difference between the one recovered from 41GM410 and the one from Camp Ford is
that two stars separate the words as opposed to three stars.

A wooden bead was recovered from excavation (Figure 9c). The bead has been split with
roughly 60% of the bead still intact. The bead is 10.4 mm in diameter and has a 2.5 mm
wide hole running through it. The outside appears to have been painted or had some sort
of glazing. It appears to be larger than those typically used for jewelry and its function is
unclear. A ceramic marble (Figure 9e) was also recovered from the site. The marble is
18.2 mm in diameter and doesnât appear to have been painted or if it had been the paint
has worn away. Clay marbles were manufactured mainly in the last part of the nineteenth
century and into the early part of the twentieth century (Baumann 1987:28; Zapata
1997:108).
A total of 9 pieces of bone were recovered from the site. Two pieces of rib bone, a
fragmented piece of a tooth, a bison metatarsal (Tawater 2007), a piece of burned bone
and three unidentified fragments. Several of the bones appear to have been broken to get
to the marrow. The metatarsal has a saw cut across the distal end with two additional cut
marks on the underside of the bone. The two rib bones and the fragmented tooth were
from a large mammal. The burned piece of bone could have been from being cooked or
could have been tossed into a trash pile where it was burned. The rest of the bone is small
and fragmentary but were also probably from large mammals.

Conclusions
Testing at site 41GM410 has confirmed that the slightly elevated rock hearth is
associated with a collapsed chimney and thus must have been part of a residence that had
a wooden floor that was supported on rock or wooden post piers. Based on the limited
presence of chimney rock and the absence of stick impressed fired mud mixed with the
chimney rock, it appears that the chimney was made of rock and that rock from the
collapsed chimney was scavenged after the house was abandoned. No piers were evident
on the surface nor were any found during testing; however the outline of a structure may
be evident below the present ground surface. The south end of the serpentine walkway
terminates at what appears to be a stepping stone that may be just outside the residential
structure and is directly north of the hearth base. Due to the number of nails recovered
and their spread outside the chimney and along the walkway, we have concluded that a
single room structure was present and that it was a frame building rather than a log
building. The low density artifact scatter outside the estimated limits of the structure
attests to a relatively impoverished occupation and to a relatively short period during
which the house was lived in. The absence of a subterranean cistern may be attributed to
the presence of reliable water nearby in Alum Creek or may be due to the use of an
elevated water tank (Speck 1979:230) and this may be an issue that can not be
determined archaeologically.
Site dating relies primarily on the presence of a rusted 2 Â½ gallon Granite Ware cooking
pot recovered during the survey (Skinner and Plumb 2002:30) and the abundance of
square-cut nails and bottle glass recovered from testing which demonstrate occupation
prior to 1888 and in the 1870s according to Greguire (1990:11). Other artifacts including
buttons and the clay marble also confirm occupation in the second half of the 1800s.
Site 41GM410 is similar to several historic sites recorded during survey and testing at the
Gibbons Creek Lignite Mine project. Two of these sites, the Peterâs log cabin
(41GM155) and the Piedmont Springs hotel and resort (41GM44) were placed on or
determined eligible for the National Register of Historic Places and site 41GM164 was
considered for inclusion but was avoided by mining and not nominated (Rogers
1993:125-132). Site 41GM410 appears to be similar to site 41GM164 in that it too is a
1800s residential site, however site 41GM410 has not suffered from the disturbance that
site 41GM164 is described as having and the occupation at GM410 appears to be shorter
in time and confined to the 1870s. Furthermore, site 41GM410 clearly has buried features
as shown by the walkway and chimney fall that were uncovered during testing but not
initially visible. Although numerous historic sites dating in the twentieth century were
recorded at Gibbons Creek and elsewhere in the county, no well-preserved sites with
buried features and midden deposits and dating in the 1870s have been thoroughly tested,
excavated, or preserved in Grimes County. Thus the site appears to be unique and worthy
of further investigation.

Site 41GM412
The site was described as being 40 m E/W by 24 m in area and having a buried deposit
that extends from the surface to as deep as 60-70 cm. At least one slab-lined hearth was
located during the original survey. Occupation apparently occurred on a slowly aggrading
surface where rock features were expected to have occurred and where artifacts might be
concentrated. We expected that occupation surfaces/zones would yield a limited variety
of stone tools and lithic debris representing either the manufacturing or the repair of
chipped stone tools.
Site Definition
The east side of the site was covered by a narrow but dense grove of yaupon holly
intermixed with saw green briar. The grove was cleared before excavation began and the
open site area was cleared using a weed eater to remove tall grass. Sixteen additional
shovel tests (Figure 11) were placed at site 41GM412 to refine the site limits (Table 5).

Shovel tests (STâs) were placed on the grid system at 5 meter intervals and were
excavated to a depth of 70+ cmbs in 20 cm levels. Out of the 15 additional shovel tests, 8
were positive and produced 10 pieces of lithic debris. Nine of the ten pieces were flakes
and one was a chip. Half of the lithics were recovered from between 0-20 cmbs. Four
were recovered from 20-40 cmbs and one was encountered between 40-60 cmbs. No
artifact concentrations were apparent either vertically or horizontally but the site limits
were clearly defined despite the small sample. After the shovel tests were complete and
refilled, it was decided that auguring to bedrock would help to determine just how deep
the clay line and underlying sandstone bedrock are across the site. Ten of the shovel tests
were then augured to the underlying sandstone bedrock. Shovel test 304 was not augured
due to the placement of TU 1 adjacent to the ST. Shovel test 309 was not augured but
instead was expanded to be a geological test unit. The remaining STâs (312-315) were not
augured because information about the bedrock depth had been mapped.
The additional shovel testing confirmed that the site is primarily located on a small rise
that slopes to the north and to the east. The amount of artifacts recovered from the shovel
testing did not however resemble the original artifact counts recovered from the 2002
survey. Five of the eight original shovel tests recovered a total of 54 flakes, 12 core
fragments, a biface and 23 fire-cracked rocks (Skinner and Plumb 2002: 33). It is not
certain why a larger artifact count was found in 2002 as opposed to the more recent lower
count.
When the site was first recorded (Skinner and Plumb 2002: 31), ST 61 was reported to
have had a buried sandstone-lined hearth. Shovel test 304 was placed a meter north of
this reported hearth and was excavated to a depth of 75 cmbs. Degrading sandstone was
noted from 20 to 70 cmbs where dark grayish brown clay was encountered. Only two
pieces of lithic debris were recovered from the shovel test, one from 20 cm and the other
from 50 cm.

Testing
With the site limits defined, two contiguous 1 m square units were established adjacent to
shovel test 61 in order to further explore the reported hearth (Figure 12). The north test
unit which was placed adjacent to the âhearthâ is TU 1 and the southern test unit is TU 2.
The northwest quarter of TU 2 was bagged in ten centimeter levels for subsequent fine
screening to determine if Â¼â screening was missing artifacts in the form of lithic debris,
plant and animal remains, or other small artifacts.

Figure 12.

Figure showing the test units and geological test pits.

Test unit 1 encountered degraded sandstone at 30 cmbs on the east wall where the
âhearthâ had been reported. The sandstone was not burnt and there was no evidence of
burned material or of fire-cracked rock in the level. As the unit was excavated to 40 cm,
more sandstone appeared along the east wall and in the northwest corner of the unit. The
sandstone remained confined to these areas to a depth of 70+ cmbs when clay subsoil was
encountered. TU 2 encountered fewer pieces of degrading sandstone about 30 cmbs along
the east wall and one large piece was noted in the southeast corner about 65 cmbs

(Figures 13 & 14). With no charcoal staining, no burned material, or fire-cracked rock, it
was determined that the original shovel test had encountered degrading sandstone and
misinterpreted it as a hearth. A possible Marshall dart point base was recovered from TU
2 at a depth of 40-50 cmbs. A complete Fairland dart point made of Edwards chert was
recovered between 50-60 cmbs. Both units encountered gravels in the upper sandy matrix
and even a few pieces in the underlying sandy clay. No gravels or artifacts were present
in the clay subsoil that occurs just above the sandstone bedrock. The southeast corner of
TU 2 was augured to the underlying sandstone bedrock which was reached at 103 cmbs.
During excavation the northwestern quarter of TU 2 was bagged in 10 cm levels to be
used for fine screening. The seven levels produced 18 pieces of lithic debris, 463 pieces
of sandstone and 1258 pieces of gravel (Table 6). The gravel and sandstone was divided
into four groups based upon the size in millimeters (i.e. 0-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60+). The
results indicate that the amount of gravel remained fairly constant throughout all seven
levels with a slight decrease in the lower two levels. However, the amount of sandstone
increased throughout the seven levels with a significant jump in level 7 (60-70 cmbs).
Over half of the gravels and sandstone were 40 mm in length or less. These gravels are
typically too small to be worked, so the gravels seen throughout the site are obviously not
the source material for the lithic debitage and tools recovered at the site.

TU 3 was placed a meter west of TU 2 and just over a meter east of positive shovel test
305. TU 3 encountered mostly gravels intermixed with lithic debris in the first several
levels. Degrading sandstone began to appear in the unit at the top of level 4 (30-40 cmbs).
At the bottom of this level, more sandstone began appearing and a thin charcoal stain
running along a root was uncovered. Just below the charred root in the western half of the
unit was several pieces of sandstone that appeared charred. The charred sandstone was
only found in a 30 x 40 cm area within the unit with no other burned materials or bone
noted. At a depth of 40-50 cmbs a large petrified wood biface was uncovered in the
northwestern corner of the unit. The next level 50-60 cmbs produced no lithic debris but
did however produce an Ensor dart point close to the beginning of the level. With no
other lithic debris recovered from the level the unit was terminated.
Test unit 4 was placed between TU 1 and positive ST 311. Because this unit is located in
the cleared yaupon holly grove, it contained numerous roots. The unit encountered
numerous pieces of degrading sandstone beginning at the bottom of level 3 (20-30 cmbs).
The degrading sandstone was found within the sandy matrix with gravels and lithic
debitage above and below. The unit was terminated upon reaching sandstone bedrock at
40 cmbs (Figure 15). Nine pieces of lithic debris were the only cultural materials
recovered from the unit.

The next test unit (TU 5) was placed just north of positive ST 305 and south of positive
ST 310 (Figure 16). Test unit 5 produced gravels intermixed with lithic debris to a total
depth of 60 cmbs. Some widely scattered sandstone pieces were encountered in level 5
(50-60 cmbs). The southeast corner of the unit was augured to sandstone bedrock at 102
cmbs. No diagnostics, charred materials or bone were recovered from the unit.

Figure 16.

Site overview looking northeast. TU 5 is to the left and TU 4 is to the
right. TUs 1 and 2 are in the center of the picture.

TU 6 was placed a meter to the east of positive shovel test 301. The test unit was
excavated to a depth of 60 cm. It was noted that pea-sized sandstone was encountered
between 30-40 cm which and intermixed with small gravels and lithic debitage.
Degrading sandstone was encountered between 50-60 cm in the southeast corner of the
unit.

Stratigraphy
Three geological test units (Figure 12) were excavated to examine the subsurface geology
but also to further examine the degrading sandstone layer discovered in TUs 1 & 2 but
also seen sporadically in TUs 3, 4 and 6 and in auguring. The sandstone was friable and
reddish/yellow in color that was typically encountered in conglomerations of numerous
small golf ball-sized pieces to fist-sized and larger pieces. All three of the test units were
shoveled out and not screened as they were placed to specifically look at the geology.

The first geological test unit was placed on the eastern edge of the two track road that
runs through the site. The test unit was excavated as a block that is 70 cm N/S by 110 cm
E/W (Figure 17). The test unit went to a depth of 80 cmbs where the sandstone bedrock
was encountered. Only a few small pieces of sandstone were noted in the fine sandy
matrix above the clay. The upper 60 cm is composed of a grayish brown 10YR5/2 fine
sand that grades to clay at about 58 cmbs. From here down to bedrock is a dark grayish
brown 10YR4/2 sandy clay with scattered mottles of strong brown 7.5YR5/6 clay.

Figure 17.

Profile of geological test unit 1.

The second geological test unit was placed two and a half meters southeast of TU 2
adjacent to shovel test 303 which was expanded to 0.5 x 1 m. The top 30 cm was
comprised of loose brown 10YR4/3 sandy matrix with an abundance of roots. Beginning
about 30 cm and continuing down to 87+ cmbs were some small but mostly large pieces
of degrading sandstone. Sandstone bedrock was encountered at 110 cmbs.
The third geological test unit was placed adjacent to shovel test 309 five meters to the
east of geological test unit 2. The upper 40 cm of the unit was comprised of loose dark
grayish brown 10YR4/2 sand with numerous pieces of degraded sandstone. The further
the test unit was excavated the more degraded sandstone was encountered.
The site is located on a small rise that slopes to the north and east. Approximately the top
30 centimeters is comprised of gravel ranging in size from dime-sized to half-dollar sized
pebbles mixed in a loose sandy matrix. Between 30 to 50 cm a discontinuous formation

of reddish degrading sandstone occurs and is intermixed with gravels in the sandy matrix.
The degrading sandstone occurs in small clusters with pieces ranging from golf ball size
to fist size and bigger in several of the test units. The sandy matrix continues below the
sandstone and begins to grade into clay. A clay subsoil layer is typically found above the
sandstone bedrock that seems to undulate across the site. The bedrock was recorded a
meter deep in the western part of the site but the surface drops to the east the bedrock
appears around 60 cmbs as shown in TU 4.

Analysis
A total of 277 artifacts were recovered from 41GM412; these include 2 dart points, a dart
point base, 2 bifaces, 2 cores, a scraper, 2 utilized flakes and 267 pieces of unmodified
lithic debitage (Table 7).

Two complete dart points (Figure 18) and one dart point base were recovered from the
site. The base to a possible Marshall point was recovered from TU 2 at a depth of 40-50
cmbs. The base measures 22.2 mm wide, 4.2 mm thick and weighs 2.0 g. Marshall
projectile points are Middle Archaic in age and date between 2500-1000 B.C. (Turner
and Hester 1999:149). One of the complete points was identified as a Fairland dart point
(Figure 18b) and was found in TU 2 between of 50-60 cmbs. Fairland dart points are
Transitional Archaic in age and date between 300 B.C. â A.D. 700 (Turner and Hester
1999:117). The last point is an Ensor dart point (Figure 18a) that was recovered from TU
3 at a depth of 50-60 cmbs. Ensor dart points are also Transitional Archaic in age and
date between 200 B.C. â A.D. 600 (Turner and Hester 199:114).

Two bifaces were recovered. The first biface was found in TU 2 at a depth of 0-10 cmbs.
The biface is composed of chert and measures 28.2 mm in length, 24.5 mm wide, 5.9 mm
in thickness and weighs 6.3g. The second biface is made of petrified wood and was
recovered from TU 3 at a depth of 40-50 cmbs. The biface is 85.4 mm in length, 36.1 mm
wide, 23.7 mm thick at its center and weighs 72.2 g. The biface has a crude appearance
suggesting that it is incomplete possibly representing a discarded projectile point
preform. One small chert scraper was recovered from TU 2 at a depth of 0-10 cmbs. The
scraper exhibits a smooth polished edge but appears to have been extensively rolled.
Testing recovered 269 pieces of lithic debitage (Appendix A). Lithic debris sources
include 43.6% chert, 28.2% petrified wood, 25.5% quartzite and 2.7% petrified palm
wood. All of these sources seem to come from nearby upland gravel deposits such as
those found at 41GM409 (Skinner and Plumb 2002:21). Flakes constitute 64.5% of the
lithic debris assemblage, while chips make up 13.5% and shatter makes up 21.9%.
Primary debitage makes up only 10.4% of the sample, while 70.1% are secondary and
19.5% are interior. Average weight between these categories differs with interior
debitage averaging 0.71g, secondary debitage averaging 3.01g and primary averaging
1.84g. The significant percentage of cortex bearing debitage suggests that the site was
primarily an early stage reduction site where initial cortex removal took place.
Although a few debitage pieces exhibit some edge breakage, no clearly retouched flakes
were recovered. Two flakes had polished and worn edges which show signs of possible
utilization.

Conclusions
It had been postulated that site 41GM412 was a Late Archaic residential camp occupied
repeatedly during the fall season. The results of the testing suggest that it was Middle to
Transitional Archaic site where early stage reduction of upland gravels was taking place.
The Ensor and Fairland dart points are both Transitional Archaic points and both were
recovered from the same depth (50-60 cmbs) in separate test units. A Middle Archaic dart
point base was found in the same unit (TU2) as the Fairland point but at a shallower
depth (40-50 cmbs) and is likely due to bioturbation caused by burrowing animals.
With no evidence of charred remains, fire-cracked rock or bone, and a fairly low artifact
count suggests that this was an ephemeral site and not a residential camp and it is
impossible to more accurately date the deposit or determine the season of occupation.
There is no evidence of a hearth or any other cultural features. The site does have a
puzzling geologic occurrence of discontinuous sandstone in which its origins are
unknown. It could be that the sandstone was brought to the site, but based on the very
low artifact numbers and small size, the presence of sandstone and gravel through out the
deposit, the sandstone appears to be a geological anomaly and there is no evidence that
the site represents a anything more than a very marginal occupation which resulted no
definable cultural deposit.

RECOMMENDATIONS

The purpose of this investigation was to determine if sites 41GM410 and 41GM412
contain intact deposits with features and artifacts useful for dating site occupation and
reconstructing the natural environment.
41GM410 is a small and relatively shallow midden deposit that includes the hearth, rock
chimney fall, and a serpentine-shaped walkway that define the north and south walls of a
one room frame residence that was occupied in the 1870s. It is likely that rock alignments
defining wall locations are buried under the present ground surface. The presence of a
Union Eagle general service button in the midden when combined with the nail rain that
appears to be concentrated outside the structure along with bottle glass and ceramics
serve to pinpoint the age of the structure. There is virtually no evidence that the site was
occupied or even present in the 1900s.
The property and the house site were owned from 1848 to 1877 by Warren Goodin who
may have lived there and may have cleared it for cotton farming. In 1877, Goodin sold
the land to Pru Stuckey who owned it until 1901. As with Goodin, we do not know if he
lived on the property or farmed it but it is apparent archaeologically that a house was
present at that time and was being occupied by the owner or by a tenant.
With regard to site significance, the site is not believed to have been associated with
significant events (Criterion A) or the lives of persons significant in history (Criterion B).
The lack of architecture precludes its consideration under Criterion C, but it is our
opinion that the site will yield information of importance to local and possibly regional
history (Criterion D). Thus in the opinion of the Principal Investigator the site should be
judged eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places or as a State
Archeological Landmark. We further recommend that the site be thoroughly excavated
since it is included within the landfill footprint and will be destroyed.
Site 41GM412 has a small site deposit that is less than a meter deep. The original survey
claimed to have found a hearth, but this turned out to be a discontinuous sandstone
deposit. The primary site occupation appears to be Middle to Transitional Archaic in age
based upon two complete dart points and a dart point base. The site does little to
contribute to a better understanding of prehistoric settlement in Grimes County, Texas.
Due to the absence of distinct features, a dispersed occurrence of artifacts, and a lack of
datable and identifiable organic materials or developed soils, 41GM412 does not have the
potential to be eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places or as a State
Archeological Landmark.
