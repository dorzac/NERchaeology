abstract and management summary
In May 2014, personnel with Prewitt and Associates, Inc., conducted an intensive
pedestrian archeological survey along portions of the proposed route of the extension of
State Highway (SH) 249 in Montgomery (CSJ 0720-02-073) and Grimes (CSJ 0720-02-072)
counties under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 6798 for Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc., and
the Texas Department of Transportation, Houston District. The project area extends 14.9
miles northwest from existing SH 249 just southeast of Pinehurst in Montgomery County
to Farm to Market Road (FM) 1774 about 1.8 miles north of Todd Mission in Grimes
County. The project will consist of construction of a four-lane, controlled-access toll road
with auxiliary lanes on mostly new location, typically within a 400-foot-wide right of way.
The horizontal Area of Potential Effects for the road route is approximately 720 acres, of
which 676 acres will be new right of way. The project also may require up to 98 acres for
as many as four runoff detention ponds. Thus, the Area of Potential Effects for the entire
project could encompass up to approximately 818 acres.
Project personnel consisted of Ross C. Fields (principal investigator), Aaron R. Norment
(project archeologist), and Rob Thrift and Jennifer Anderson (archeological technicians).
Fieldwork was conducted on May 5â9 and 19â23, 2014, and entailed approximately 24
person-days of effort. The pedestrian survey with shovel testing succeeded in covering 2.8
miles (127 acres) of the 14.9-mile route. Lack of right of entry prevented coverage of 4.3
miles and a 31-acre potential detention pond. Very dense vegetation and debris from the
2011 Magnolia wildfire prevented pedestrian coverage of the remaining 7.8 miles of the road
route and three potential detention pond sites totaling 67 acres. Four archeological sites
were recorded in the segments surveyed. Three sites (41GM464, 41MQ319, and 41MQ320)
are low-density scatters of Native American lithic artifacts; the fourth site (41GM465)
is a historic house site probably dating to the mid twentieth century. Artifacts recovered
from them and records of the project will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin. The eligibility of these four sites for inclusion
in the National Register of Historic Places and designation as State Antiquities Landmarks
is considered undetermined, pending completion of the survey and inventory of sites that
potentially will be affected by the project.
The results of the survey done to date, observations made of areas that could not
be surveyed, and results of the background research indicate that the original plan for
fieldwork in the remaining unsurveyed areas should be modified. Based on the low likelihood
of either Native American or historic sites, it is recommended that survey is not warranted
along about 4.7 miles of the road route and on 20 acres in one potential detention pond.
Of the remaining unsurveyed lands, about 7.2 miles of the road route and 78 acres in four
potential detention ponds should be surveyed with shovel testing, and 0.2 miles of the road
route should be surveyed with backhoe trenching. This additional survey should be done
after sufficient clearing of vegetation and wildfire debris has been done to enable systematic
and safe pedestrian coverage.

introduction
This report presents the results of intensive archeological survey conducted along the
proposed route of the extension of State Highway (SH) 249 in Montgomery (CSJ 0720-02073) and Grimes (CSJ 0720-02-072) counties in the Texas Department of Transportationâs
(TxDOT) Houston District (Figure 1). Prewitt and Associates, Inc., performed this work for
Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc., and the TxDOT Houston District under Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 6798. The project area extends 14.9 miles northwest from existing SH 249
just southeast of Pinehurst in Montgomery County to Farm to Market Road (FM) 1774
about 1.8 miles north of Todd Mission in Grimes County. The alignment will overlap about
0.9 miles of the existing SH 249 corridor and continue northwestward past the SH 249/
FM 1774 intersection and the adjacent Missouri Pacific Railroad right of way. From there,
the alignment trends north of a similarly aligned segment of FM 1774, skirting residential
areas in the towns of Pinehurst and Magnolia before terminating at a north-south segment of
FM 1774 south of Plantersville. The proposed alignment will cross, from east to west, FM 149,
FM 1488, and FM 1486. Aside from the above-noted highways and railway, development along
the alignment includes many improved and unimproved roadways, the Pinehurst Gas and
Oil Field, some sand and gravel operations, and municipal and residential development in
and on the edges of Pinehurst and Magnolia. Between FM 1486 and FM 1774, the alignment
traverses a large area that was affected by the September 2011 Magnolia wildfire.
The proposed project will consist of construction of a four-lane, controlled-access toll
road with auxiliary lanes on mostly new location. The horizontal Area of Potential Effects
(APE) for this part of the project is 14.9 miles long, has a typical right of way width of
400 feet, and encompasses approximately 720 acres, of which approximately 44 acres are
existing highway and railroad rights of way; hence, about 676 acres of the project area will
be new right of way. Overpasses ranging from approximately 350 to 1,750 feet in length
will carry the new SH 249 main lanes over FM 1774, the Missouri Pacific Railroad right
of way, Circle Lane Drive, FM 149, FM 1488, and FM 1486. Ramps and service roads will
connect SH 249 with FM 149, FM 1488, FM 1486, and FM 1774. Bridges will be constructed
to carry the main lanes over Mill and Clear Creeks and four Mill Creek tributaries. Service
road bridges will be constructed in advance of the FM 1774 intersection at a second Mill
Creek crossing. Culverts will be installed on at least three other tributary crossings. The
project also may require up to 98 acres for as many as four runoff detention ponds that may
be as deep as 30 feet. Thus, the horizontal APE for the entire project could encompass up
to approximately 818 acres. The vertical APE may vary from a minimum depth of 3â5 feet
for general roadway improvements and highway construction (with deeper impacts along
new highway cut sections) to an approximate maximum depth of 100 feet where shafts will
be drilled for bridge supports.
Project personnel consisted of Ross C. Fields (principal investigator), Aaron R. Norment
(project archeologist), and Rob Thrift and Jennifer Anderson (archeological technicians).
Fieldwork was conducted on May 5â9 and 19â23, 2014, and entailed approximately 24
person-days of effort. The pedestrian survey with shovel testing succeeded in covering only
2.8 miles of the 14.9-mile route. Lack of right of entry prevented coverage of 4.3 miles and
a 31-acre potential detention pond. Very dense vegetation and debris from the Magnolia

wildfire prevented pedestrian coverage of the remaining 7.8 miles of the road route and three
potential detention pond sites totaling 67 acres. Four archeological sites were recorded in
the segments surveyed; artifacts recovered from the sites and records of the project will be
curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin.
The remainder of this report consists of sections presenting information on the
environmental setting, previous archeological investigations nearby, methods used and
work accomplished, and results of the survey.

environmental setting
The project area is along the transition between the Austroriparian and Texan biotic
provinces and along a boundary between the Pineywoods and Post Oak Savannah ecological
regions of the state (Blair 1950; McMahan et al. 1984:Figure 1). The southernmost 1.6 miles
of the alignment traverses the ridge between the Mill Creek and Decker Branch watersheds.
The next 5.7 miles cross numerous intertributary ridges, interfluves, and sections of south
valley wall before reaching Mill Creek within a narrow, poorly developed floodplain. After
crossing the creek, the route extends 0.4 miles across a ridge between Mill and Clear Creeks.
North of Clear Creek, the route runs north and then west for 2.6 miles across a series of
interfluves drained by intermittent tributaries of Mill and Clear Creeks. Beyond that, it
turns northwest and traverses uplands for 4.2 miles before crossing the narrow (0.2 miles)
floodplain of the upper reach of Mill Creek. The northwesternmost segment of the route
occupies the valley wall west of Mill Creek.
The short segment on the Mill Creek floodplain near the northwest end of the
route, just east of FM 1774, crosses land mapped as undifferentiated Holocene alluvium.
Lower Pleistocene-age Willis Formation deposits are mapped along the remainder of the
proposed alignment (Bureau of Economic Geology 1992). Mapped soil associations include
Conroe in Montgomery County (McClintock et al. 1972) and Depcor-Fetzer-Huntsburg and
Conroe-Depcor in Grimes County (Greenwade 1996). Conroe association soils are deep,
somewhat poorly to somewhat excessively well-drained soils characterized by mantles of
sand, loamy sand, and sandy loam 60â80+ centimeters (cm) thick over sandy clay loam
and clay containing indurated ironstone concretions and plinthite. Blanton series soils in
this association can have fine sands that extend to more than 230 cm in depth. Soils in the
Grimes County segment of the alignment are very deep and somewhat poorly to moderately
well drained. Representative profiles consist of 25â70-cm-thick loamy sand underlain by
clay loam, sandy clay loam, sandy clay, and clay with occasional plinthite nodules.
About 85 percent of the alignment is in Montgomery County, which is included
in the Houston District Potential Archeological Liability Map (PALM) model coverage
developed by Abbott (2001). Almost three-quarters of the Montgomery County segment (and
approximately 44 acres in three potential detention ponds) is in areas identified as Map
Unit 2, for which surface survey typically is recommended (Figures 2â4). Twenty-one percent

3

of the Montgomery County segment (and approximately 14 acres in one potential detention
pond) is in areas designated as Map Unit 4, where survey usually is not recommended. Areas
mapped as the latter include upland landforms on both sides of Mill Creek and developed
areas around the existing FM 1774-SH 249 intersection. Three percent of the Montgomery
County segment (and approximately 15.4 acres in one potential detention pond) is in areas
of Map Unit 1, where surface survey and deep reconnaissance usually are recommended.
These include the Mill Creek crossing northeast of Magnolia and a tributary crossing south
of the creek between FM 149 and FM 1488. Three percent of the Montgomery County
segment crosses the floodplain of a perennial tributary (Clear Creek) north of Mill Creek,
which is designated as Map Unit 3. Typically, no surface survey is recommended in Map
Unit 3 areas, but deep reconnaissance is needed in anticipation of deep impacts.
Most of the 2.2-mile-long segment of the alignment in Grimes County crosses upland
terrain east and west of Mill Creek. Based on PALM map unit designations on similar
landforms in Montgomery County, most of the Grimes County segment (and 25.2 acres in
one potential detention pond) probably can be classed as Map Unit 2 with scattered areas
identifiable as Map Unit 4 (including the FM 1774 highway corridor). Low-lying terrain at
the upper Mill Creek crossing (about 0.2 miles) would be included in Map Unit 1.
Most of the project area is wooded with pines and hardwoods and is used for timber
production, accounting for 56 percent of the road route and 74 percent of the potential
detention pond areas; the vegetation in most of these areas is very dense, and ground surface
visibility is nonexistent. Most of the remainder of the area, 32 percent of the road route and
26 percent of the detention pond areas, was timber land before it was devastated by the
September 2011 Magnolia wildfire. This area, extending from FM 1486 westward almost all
the way to FM 1774, is covered with debris from the fire and dense recent vegetation, along
with isolated stands of trees that escaped the fire. Surface visibility in parts of this upland
area is excellent because the fire, probably firefighting equipment traffic, and subsequent
sand and gravel mining have denuded the ground, but fire debris hinders accessing much
of the area. Land uses for the remainder of the project area are as follows, with all having
ground surface visibility of less than 10 percent: (1) existing road (mainly SH 249) and
railroad rights of way (7 percent of the road route), where disturbance is abundant; (2)
improved pasture (2 percent of the road route); (3) residential lots (2 percent of the road
route), which vary from open grassy areas to dense woods; and (4) a single church lot
(1 percent of the road route), which is extensively disturbed.

previous investigations
Review of the Texas Historical Commissionâs Archeological Sites Atlas prior to
fieldwork revealed no recorded archeological sites and three previous archeological
investigations within 1.0 kilometer (km) of the alignment. The closest recorded sites are
41MQ214 and 41MQ219, which are 1.8 to 1.9 km southwest.

Prehistoric sites 41MQ214 and 41MQ219 were recorded in 2006 and 2007 during
surveys by Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc., on two five-acre tracts on the south side of
Mill Creek (Driver 2010:18). These investigations were conducted in anticipation of permit
application submission to the U.S. Corps of Engineers, Galveston District, for construction of
a proposed wastewater treatment plant. Site 41MQ214 is at the end of a low ridge forming
a sharp bend in Mill Creek, and 41MQ219 is upslope on the same landform. Shovel testing
recovered lithic debitage at 20â60 cm below the ground surface at 41MQ214 and one
sandy paste prehistoric ceramic sherd and lithic debitage at 0â110 cm below the surface at
41MQ219. Driver (2010:18â19) recommended further archeological investigations at both
sites to assess their National Register of Historic Places and State Antiquities Landmark
eligibility prior to any future construction impacts. Gulf Coast Archaeology Group, LLP,
conducted test excavations at 41MQ214 in 2008. This effort involved the excavation of three
1x1-meter (m) units to depths of 70â90 cm below the surface, which yielded the distal tip
of a projectile point, 3 microblades, 115 flakes, a scraper, a hammerstone, and a piece of red
ochre. No diagnostic artifacts were recovered, and no cultural features were identified. The
authors surmised that 41MQ214 is a Middle Archaic campsite and recommended that the
site is not eligible for National Register listing or State Antiquities Landmark designation
(Garcia-Herreros and Enderli 2008:31â32).
Three archeological surveys overlap parts of the project area. A 1992 survey along
the existing SH 249 alignment, south of its intersection with FM 1774 in Pinehurst, overlaps
the south end of the alignment. In 2005, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted two
archeological surveys for TxDOT along FM 1774 between the community of Todd Mission
and FM 149 in Pinehurst. The southeast ends of these survey areas are within 1 km of the
alignment. These three surveys identified no new archeological sites.

Project design, methods, and work accomplished
Survey Plan
Based on the results of the prefield background research, most of the project area was
considered to have a moderate to high potential for Native American archeological sites, with
only about one-fifth of it being in settings where the Houston PALM typically does not call
for archeological survey (i.e., Map Unit 4). Areas considered most likely to contain Native
American sites included the floodplains of Mill and Clear Creeks and especially interfluves
close to these creeks; floodplains were likely to contain deeply buried sites, while shallowly
buried sites were more likely on interfluves. Areas where the SH 249 route crosses unnamed
small tributaries of Mill Creek also were considered to have some potential for sites, but
less so than areas proximate to the larger water courses. Because less attention had been
given to modeling historic archeological site locations for the region, it was hard to identify
areas where historic sites were most likely. However, research suggested that the project
area never was densely settled historically, with maps and aerial photographs indicating
widely scattered improvements and occasional concentrations of buildings in Magnolia,
Pinehurst, and other communities along area highways (Texas State Highway Department
1939, 1940, 1961a, 1961b; U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Stabilization and

8

Conservation Service 1952a, 1952b, 1958, 1967, 1968; U.S. Geological Survey 1962a, 1962b,
1962c, 1962d, 1964, 1967, 1979). The areas judged to have the highest potential for historic
archeological sites were along the existing FM 1774/SH 249 intersection in Pinehurst, along
FM 149 between Pinehurst and Mill Creek, and along FM 1488 in the vicinity of the extant
Missionary Church and cemetery.
These expectations led to development of a survey plan that called for pedestrian
survey of 100 percent of the project area, including the potential detention pond areas as
well as the 400-foot-wide road route. Because about 93 percent of the road route was in
settings where any archeological sites present would be shallowly buried (Houston PALM
Map Units 2 and 4; see Figures 2â4), survey with shovel testing was considered to be
the appropriate methodology for most of the project area, and the original scope of work
estimated that 600â700 shovel tests would be required to provide effective coverage of
these areas. It was determined that trenching to look for deeply buried sites would be the
appropriate survey strategy in the remainder of the road route, since they were in Map
Units 1 and 3, and perhaps in the potential detention pond areas as well. It was estimated
that 20â25 trenches would be needed to cover the road route and another 20â25 would be
required for the detention ponds.

Survey Methods and Work Accomplished
Archeological survey was done by crews of two or three archeologists on May 5â9
and 19â23, 2014. The initial task entailed identifying parcels where right of entry had not
been obtained and thus where survey could not be done (amounting to about 4.3 miles of
the road route and a 31-acre potential detention pond; Figures 5â7) and determining how
to access those parcels for which right of entry had been obtained. Dense vegetation and
debris from the 2011 Magnolia wildfire hindered fieldwork, so much so that many areas
(about 7.8 miles of the road route and three potential detention ponds totaling 67 acres)
could not be covered using pedestrian transects. After consultation with Jacobs Engineering
Group personnel, it was determined that survey of these areas would have to be delayed
until they had been cleared of vegetation and fire debris sufficiently to permit effective and
safe field survey.
The pedestrian survey with shovel testing succeeded in covering only 2.8 miles of
the 14.9-mile road route and none of the four detention pond areas. About 0.9 miles of the
surveyed route is on public land (existing SH 249 right of way), and 1.9 miles is on private
land. The eight areas covered were surveyed using pedestrian transects spaced no more
than 30 m apart. The ground surface and existing exposures were examined for evidence of
archeological remains, but ground surface visibility typically was very poor. One hundred
seven shovel tests measuring approximately 30 cm in diameter were excavated to look for
shallowly buried archeological remains. Fifteen tests were on public land within existing
SH 249 right of way at the southeast end of the project area; the other 92 tests were on
privately owned lands. The intensity of testing (1 test per 1.2 acres) exceeds that required
by the Texas Historical Commissionâs Archeological Survey Standards for Texas for areas

of this size (1 test per 3 acres). The tests were dug in 20-cm levels to depths ranging from 2
to 110 cm (average = 59 cm), and the sediments removed were screened through 1/4-inchmesh hardware cloth. Sixty-four tests reached sandy clay bedrock at an average depth of
48 cm. Twenty-four tests did not reach bedrock because they were in areas with thick sands
(80â110+ cm). The other 19 tests were stopped at depths of 60 cm or less for a variety of
reasons, including obstruction by roots, concrete chunks, and a plastic pipe.
Table 1 summarizes the work accomplished, starting at the southeast end of the
project area and moving northwest. In addition to containing parcel numbers and ownership
information, it indicates where right of entry had been obtained, the condition of the land,
where survey was completed and not completed, and sites recorded. The southeasternmost
0.9 miles of the road route is mostly existing SH 249 right of way, with occasional narrow
slivers of new right of way on adjoining private lands (see Figure 5). The northwest end of
this segment is where SH 249 transitions to FM 1774, south of the Missouri Pacific Railroad
tracks. SH 249 is a divided four-lane highway with a wide, mostly wooded median bordered on
both sides by storm drains. Between highway and railroad construction, placement of buried
utilities, and development on adjacent private lands, most of this segment is so disturbed
that it has no potential for archeological sites with good integrity. All of this segment was
surveyed, and 15 shovel tests were excavated in less-disturbed portions of the median and
along the west edge of the existing right of way; no archeological sites were found.
After crossing the Missouri Pacific Railroad tracks just north of FM 1774, the road
route extends 1.3 miles across privately owned land to FM 149 (see Figure 5). All of this
segment is wooded or has been recently logged. Two areas were surveyed, accounting for
40 percent by length and 42 percent of the acreage. Thirteen shovel tests were excavated on
three adjoining parcels near the south end, and 9 shovel tests were on a parcel at the north
end; no archeological remains were found in either area. The surveyed areas exhibit some
surface modification from recent and past logging but do not show evidence of extensive
disturbance that would have compromised the integrity of archeological sites. Two parcels
at the south end were not surveyed because of a lack of right of entry, and the much larger
central portion was not surveyed because of very dense vegetation.
After crossing FM 149, the road route extends 3.7 miles across privately owned
land to FM 1488 (see Figures 5 and 6). The vast majority of this distance is wooded and
undeveloped, although the southern end crosses a lot containing a church, and the southern
portion traverses a residential neighborhood; in most of this neighborhood, the proposed
right of way will clip the back parts of the lots. Just four parcels in this segment were
surveyed, accounting for 9 percent by length and 5 percent by area. The Believers Fellowship
Baptist Church parcel on the west side of FM 149 was surveyed and found to be extensively
disturbed by building and parking lot construction and land leveling, and thus no shovel
tests were dug. The other three surveyed parcels are in the residential neighborhood; four
shovel tests were dug. No archeological remains were found in these tests or on the surface.
The residential lots exhibit some surface modification from residential use but do not show
evidence of extensive disturbance that would have compromised the integrity of archeological
sites. Most of the land that was not surveyed (including a potential detention pond) is on
large wooded tracts or small residential lots where right of entry had not been obtained.

Four areas with right of entry were not surveyed because they are inaccessible back edges
of residential lots; each encompasses only 0.1â0.3 acres.
From FM 1488, the road route extends northwest, north, and then west 3.7 miles
across privately owned land to FM 1486, crossing Mill and Clear Creeks in the central northsouth section (see Figure 6). Virtually all of this segment is wooded and undeveloped. Two
adjacent parcels between Mill and Clear Creeks and north of Clear Creek were surveyed,
accounting for 14 percent of this segment of the road route by both length and area. Thirty
shovel tests were excavated, and two sites were found (41MQ319 and 41MQ320). The tests
were on the ridge between the creeks and on both sides of Clear Creek; the floodplain of
Mill Creek held standing water and was too wet for shovel testing. Parts of the northern
surveyed tract have been disturbed extensively by gravel and sand quarrying, but most
of the surveyed area does not show evidence of extensive disturbance that would have
compromised the integrity of archeological sites. Most of the areas that were not surveyed
have right of entry, but dense vegetation prevented pedestrian coverage (2.5 miles of road
route and 42 acres in two potential detention ponds). One large tract containing 0.6 miles
of the road route lacks right of entry and also was not surveyed.
From FM 1486, the road route extends west and then northwest 5.2 miles across
privately owned land to FM 1774, crossing the upper reach of Mill Creek just east of the
northwest end (see Figures 6 and 7). All but the northwesternmost 0.5 miles of this segment is
undeveloped land that was affected to varying degrees by the 2011 Magnolia wildfire. Wildfire
debris is extensive, and some areas exhibit abundant surface disturbance from earthmoving
and erosion. Right of entry had been obtained for all of these burned-over areas, but most
of it, including a 25.2-acre potential detention pond, could not be surveyed safely because
of the wildfire debris. The single area that could be surveyed is a 0.2-mile-long segment of
the road route in the southeast part that is accessible because multiple two-track roads
cross it; 12 shovel tests were excavated here, exposing generally thin gravelly sediments
and no archeological remains. This surveyed section has been substantially disturbed by
vehicle traffic, wildfire-related surface modification, and erosion, such that it has a very low
potential for archeological sites with good integrity. Of the two parcels at the northwest end
that were not burned over, one is mostly in pasture, and the other is wooded. The pasture
parcel, accounting for 0.3 miles of the route, was surveyed; 24 shovel tests were excavated, and
two sites were found (41GM464 and 41GM465). This surveyed section shows no evidence of
extensive disturbance that would have compromised the integrity of archeological sites. The
0.2-mile-long wooded parcel just to the east was not surveyed because of lack of right of entry.

Site Descriptions
Site 41GM464
Site 41GM464 is a scatter of Native American artifacts situated at an elevation of
275 feet above mean sea level at the base of the upland slope just west of Mill Creek near
the northwest end of the proposed road route (Figure 8). The land currently is used as a

cattle pasture and supports thick Bermudagrass. The site is along the pastureâs eastern
fence line, and a dense stand of pines, mixed hardwoods, and thorny brush grows along the
stream channel to the east. No artifacts were observed on the ground surface, but artifacts
were found in and collected from 3 of the 12 shovel tests excavated on the lower slope. The
materials recovered consist of five lithic flakes, one possible burned rock, and three bone
fragments. The latter came from a depth of 0â20 cm and could be of recent origin. The other
artifacts came from depths of 0â80 cm, with single items from 0â20 and 60â80 cm and two
items each from 20â40 and 40â60 cm. The 12 tests reached depths of 25â110 cm, averaging 84 cm. Three tests reached clay subsoil at 25â54 cm, but the other 9 tests extended to

18

90â110 cm without encountering subsoil. Sediments consisted of grayish brown loam in
the upper 10 cm underlain by pale yellowish brown sandy loam. The three positive tests
suggest that the site measures approximately 60x40 m.

Site 41GM465
Situated at an elevation of 280â295 feet above mean sea level in an upland setting
within a cattle pasture along FM 1774 at the northwest end of the project area, 41GM465 is a
historic house location evidenced by a concrete building foundation measuring approximately
54 feet east-west by 44 feet north-south surrounded by trees that likely mark the yard
area (see Figure 8). Currently, a single cattle feeder and hay ring occupy the old home site,
and the ground surface is blanketed by Bermudagrass. The site measures approximately
200 m east-west by 50 m north-south, with the house foundation at the western end and a
barbecue pit at the eastern end. The barbecue pit is made of standard 16x8x8-inch concrete
blocks and measures 64 inches long by 48 inches wide and 32 inches tall. Much of the pit
has fallen apart. No historic artifacts were noted on the surface, but four artifacts were
found in and collected from 3 of the 12 shovel tests excavated on and around the site: an
unmarked whiteware fragment at 0â20 cm, a piece of clear glass and single wire nail at
20â40 cm, and a piece of clear glass at 40â60 cm. These artifacts are not very diagnostic
temporally, although the wire nail certainly postdates approximately 1890 (Wells 1998:87).
Also encountered in 2 shovel tests were a concrete block and a section of plastic pipe, both
of which are consistent with occupation in the mid twentieth century or later. The 12 tests
reached depths of 20â80 cm, averaging 61 cm. Nine tests reached clay subsoil at 50â80 cm,
while the other 3 tests were stopped above the subsoil at 20â45 cm. Sediments encountered
consisted of grayish brown loam in the upper 10 cm underlain by yellowish brown sandy
loam. The remains observed suggest that this is a house site dating to the mid twentieth
century, and the 1962 U.S. Geological Survey map and county highway maps dating to 1940
and 1961 show buildings at this location. Archival research to identify who lived here and
a more precise date of the occupation will be done once fieldwork for the full project area
is complete.

Site 41MQ319
Site 41MQ319 is a scatter of Native American artifacts occupying the sloping upland
margin at an elevation of 220 feet above mean sea level on the north side of Clear Creek in
the central part of the project area (Figure 9). Clear Creek flows west to east approximately
125 m south of the site at an elevation between 205 and 210 feet, and the intervening area
consists of marshy floodplain and a culturally sterile floodplain rise. The site environs is
dominated by pine and mixed hardwood forest containing gravel and sand quarry pits,
which may have disturbed the original site area. The site is within a local Old Westâthemed
shooting range, and erection of structures for the range also may have disturbed the site.
No artifacts were observed on the ground surface, but artifacts were found in and collected
from two of the seven shovel tests excavated on the landform. The materials recovered

19

consist of two small lithic flakes from 40â60 cm and a single flake from 80â100 cm. All but
one of the tests reached a depth of 100 cm without encountering clay subsoil; the seventh
test was stopped above subsoil at 55 cm. Sediments consisted of grayish brown loam in the
upper 20 cm underlain by pale yellowish brown sandy loam. The two positive tests suggest
that the site is small, measuring less than 30 m across.

Site 41MQ320
Site 41MQ320 is a scatter of Native American artifacts at an elevation of 215â220 feet
above mean sea level on the upland slope south of Clear Creek in the central part of the
project area (see Figure 9). Clear Creek flows west to east approximately 105 m north of the
site at an elevation between 205 and 210 feet; the intervening area consists of a culturally
sterile upland slope. The landform rises to the top of the ridge between Clear and Mill
Creeks at an elevation of 230 feet approximately 125 m south of the site. The area is heavily
wooded with dense pine trees and mixed hardwoods and supports a variety of underbrush
filling in the open spaces at ground level. No artifacts were observed on the ground surface,
but artifacts were found in and collected from two of the seven shovel tests excavated in
the immediate area. The materials recovered consist of a small lithic flake from 0â20 cm
and a battered chert pebble from 40â60 cm. Five of the seven tests encountered clay subsoil
at 50â90 cm; the other two tests stopped at 100 cm without reaching subsoil. Sediments
consisted of grayish brown sandy loam in the upper 5 cm underlain by brown sandy loam
with numerous gravel inclusions throughout. The two positive tests suggest that the site
is small, measuring less than 25 m across.

Site assessments and recommendations
Given that much of the SH 249 project area remains to be surveyed archeologically,
it is considered prudent to delay assessment of the four sites recorded in terms of their
eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places under Criterion D (36
CFR 60.4; 36 CFR 800.4, 5) and designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (13 TAC 26.2,
8) until a complete inventory of sites that will be affected by the project is made. This will
ensure that all site assessments are consistent and supported by the sum of the evidence.
Based on the results of survey done to date, observations made of areas that could
not be surveyed, and results of the background research, recommendations are offered here
for completing the survey of the proposed road route and potential detention ponds. These
recommendations are presented from southeast to northwest (Table 2; Figures 10â12). Between
the Missouri Pacific Railroad tracks and FM 149, it appears that only the north half (1,900 feet)
of the road route on Tract R43394 warrants survey with shovel testing (no trenching should
be needed; see Figure 10). The other half of this tract and all of the smaller two to the south
(totaling 2,100 feet of road route) are in upland settings where Native American sites are
unlikely and where historical research yielded no indications of historic sites.

Between FM 149 and FM 1488, survey is warranted along most of the road route
(15,200 feet) and in the 31-acre potential detention based on proximity to Mill Creek or
its tributaries; it appears that survey here can be accomplished with shovel testing with
no need for trenching. Survey is unnecessary on about 2,600 feet of Tract R41698 because
of its upland setting. Survey also is unnecessary on 10 small residential tracts (totaling
1.7 acres), as survey of 4 other larger tracts (totaling 7.1 acres) interspersed among them
(and survey already completed of 3 lots totaling 4.0 acres with negative results) should be
adequate for determining whether there are any sites in this area.

Between FM 1488 and FM 1486, survey is warranted along much of the road route
(10,100 feet), in all of the 15-acre southeastern detention pond, and in the eastern quarter
of the 26-acre northwestern detention pond based on proximity to Mill and Clear Creeks
or their tributaries; survey over most of this area can be accomplished with shovel testing,
but trenching may be needed on the narrow Mill Creek floodplain (approximately 400 feet).
Survey is unnecessary on about 3,400 feet of the southeast end of the road route, 3,700 feet
of the western part of the road route, and the western three-quarters of the northwestern
detention pond because they are in upland settings removed from creeks and tributaries.
Survey also should be unnecessary on two small residential tracts (totaling 1.0 acre), since
the adjacent segment of the road route will be surveyed.
Between FM 1486 and FM 1774, survey is warranted along about half of the road
route (11,500 feet) and in all of the 25-acre potential detention pond based on proximity to
Mill Creek or its tributaries or suspected historic sites; survey over most of this area can
be accomplished with shovel tests, but trenching may be needed for approximately 725 feet
where the road route crosses Mill Creek. Survey is unnecessary on about 14,800 feet of the
road route because they are in upland settings where Native American sites are unlikely
and where historical research yielded no indications of historic sites.

Conclusions
In May 2014, personnel with Prewitt and Associates, Inc., conducted intensive
pedestrian archeological survey along portions of the proposed route of the extension of
SH 249 in Montgomery (CSJ 0720-02-073) and Grimes (CSJ 0720-02-072) Counties under
Texas Antiquities Permit No. 6798. The project area extends 14.9 miles northwest from
existing SH 249 just southeast of Pinehurst in Montgomery County to FM 1774 about 1.8
miles north of Todd Mission in Grimes County. The project will consist of construction of a
four-lane, controlled-access toll road with auxiliary lanes on mostly new location within a
typically 400-feet-wide right of way. The horizontal APE for the road route is approximately
720 acres, of which 676 acres will be new right of way. The project also may require up to
98 acres for as many as four runoff detention ponds. Thus, the horizontal APE for the entire
project could encompass up to approximately 818 acres.
The pedestrian survey with shovel testing succeeded in covering 2.8 miles of the
14.9-mile route. Lack of right of entry prevented coverage of 4.3 miles and a 31-acre potential detention pond. Very dense vegetation and debris from the 2011 Magnolia wildfire
prevented pedestrian coverage of the remaining 7.8 miles of the road route and three
potential detention pond sites totaling 67 acres. Four archeological sites were recorded in
the segments surveyed. Three sites (41GM464, 41MQ319, and 41MQ320) are low-density
scatters of Native American lithic artifacts; the fourth site (41GM465) is a historic house
site probably dating to the mid twentieth century. Artifacts recovered from them and
records of the project will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory,
The University of Texas at Austin. The eligibility of these four sites for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places and designation as State Antiquities Landmarks is

27

considered undetermined, pending completion of the survey and inventory of sites that
will be affected by the project.
The results of survey done to date, observations made of areas that could not be
surveyed, and results of the background research indicate that the original plan for fieldwork
in the remaining unsurveyed areas should be modified. Based on the low likelihood of
either Native American or historic sites, it is recommended that survey is not warranted
along about 4.7 miles of the road route and on 20 acres in one potential detention pond (see
Figures 10â12). Of the remaining unsurveyed lands, about 7.2 miles of the road route and
78 acres in four potential detention ponds should be surveyed with shovel testing, and 0.2
miles of the road route should be surveyed with backhoe trenching (see Figures 10â12).
This additional survey should be done after sufficient clearing of vegetation and wildfire
debris has been done to enable systematic and safe pedestrian coverage.
