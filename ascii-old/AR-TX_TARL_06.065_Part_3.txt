ABSTRACT
The treatment of the flora of the Mcqregor Range has been
developed with regard to its importance in interpreting the
environmental factors in the investigation of the area's cul­
tural resources.
It is structured as a three-faceted study,
and focuses on various botanical and botanically-related aspects
of the McGregor Range natural resources.
The following objectives
tives have been pursued: (1) the compilation of a baseline
summary of the major vegetation areas of the Range and a check
list of the plant species and their distributions; (2) a pre­
liminary investigation of the vegetation changes in the area
and a partial reconstruction of the vegetation pattern shifts
during the past hundred years; (3) an overview of the potential
floral resources of recorded use by aboriginal populations,
including information regarding plant parts used, how they may
be used, and their seasonal availability and distribution.
FLORA OF THE McGREGOR RANGE:
A SUMMARY AND CHECK LIST
STUDY AREA
The McGregor Range lies within the arid Basin and Range
physiographic region of southern New Mexico; its boundaries
enclose physiographic features of mountain ranges, mesa plateau,
and low desert valley flats.
The total area of the Range covers
approximately 1000 square miles with elevations varying from
4000 feet in the southwestern valley floor to 7200 feet along
the northern boundary in the Sacramento Mountains.
The bound­
aries stretch from the Texas-New Mexico state line and the
border-straddling Hueco Mountains in the south to the middle
reaches of the southern Sacramento Mountains in the north.
The
eastern limit runs along the elevated expanse of Otero Mesa,
and the western boundary, Highway 54, cuts through the broad

arid lowlands of the Tularosa Basin.
Such diversity of land
forms offers a variety of local habitats for floral development.
REGIONAL PROVINCIALITY AND CLIMACTIC PHASE
With emphasis on its floral constituents and distribution
characteristics, the Range is included in the northern sector
of the Chihuahuan Biotic Province, as defined by Blair (1950)
and Dice (1943).
However, classification of the vegetation of
southern New Mexico has been a long-standing difficulty, a
situation which may persist on the Range as well.
Some have
considered the climax vegetation form of southern New Mexico to
be grassland (Whitfield and Beutner 1938; Gardner 1951), and
there are others who would consider it desert scrub (Shreve 1917,
1939, 1942; Livingston and Shreve 1921).
This may arise from
its regional position as a transitional area with a transitional
climate falling between the vast short grass plains to the north­
east and the Chihuahuan desert to the southwest (Lowe 1967).
Presently, the Range is shrub-dominate on the valley floor and
mountain areas, with the mesa tableland maintaining a grassland
form.
ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
Climatic Factors
The climate is arid with the evapo-transpiration rate ex­
ceeding rainfall; an average annual rainfall of less than 10
inches in the lowlands and about 12 inches in the upland, mon­
tane areas results in a serious deficiency of available moisture
for plant productivity and development.
Some snowfall may occur
but does not fall in significant amounts to affect overall
moisture availability.
Humidity is low with radical day-night
temperature fluctuations occurring.
In an arid-land ecosystem the available moisture to plants
is heavily dependent on the seasonal and distributional aspects
of the annual rainfall.
On the McGregor Range most of the an­
nual rainfall is in the form of widely scattered summer thunder­
storms with much of the moisture being lost through rapid r~n­
off and rapid evaporation in the summer heat.
Perennial winds
(seldom under 10 mph), originating from the southwest, further
induce the evaporation of soil moisture and the desiccation of
life-forms.
Edaphic Factors
The understanding of soil conditions is basic to an eco­
logical understanding of the vegetation.
The highly varied

FLORA SUMMARY AND CHECK LIST

soils of the Range have been generally treated in a soil survey
of Otero County, New Mexico (Maker et aZ. 1972) and have been
described in a recent ecological study of the Range (Wyatt
1976).
In addition, a map and geologic study of pedogenesis of
this Range is summarized by J. Pigott (see page 115).
Soils
information used for the present report is essentially derived
from field observation and from a Soil Conservation Service
reconnaissance survey of McGregor Range and the write-up sheets
available in the district office of the United States Soil
Conservation Service, Alamagordo, New Mexico.
Some of the soil factors of greatest concern to the
botanist are such profile characteristics as general composi­
tion (rock, sand, clay), structure (loosely single-grained to
highly aggregated), depth (shallow to deep), and permeability.
All of these factors influence the soil's water retention
capacity and general water availability to plants.
A brief
summary of the area soils follows.
Generally, the soils of the western McGregor Range valley
floor are deep reddish-brown sands and sandy loams occurring as
medium and coarse textured dunes and interdune areas.
The cop­
pice dunes are partially stabilized by mesquite (Prosopis
gZanduZosa var. Torreyana) , but are constantly subject to ero­
sion by aeolian deflation of the dunes' windward sides.
Perme­
ability is rapid, except for certain interdune areas where the
subsoils (sandy-clay loams) allow for moderate permeability but
a low available water capacity nonetheless.
The soils are
moderately to strongly calcareous and moderately alkaline
throughout the profile.
Progressing to the east of this expanse of coppice dunes,
fine textured silty loams are found in elongated patterns along
the valley apron.
Occupying the basin bottomlands and a term­
inal fan position adjacent to the high-energy alluvial fans to
the east, the fine silt loams are derived from the fluvial re­
working of alluvial gravels.
The surface layers are shallow
but are underlaid with a silty-clay loam to depths below 60
inches.
Generally lacking in protective vegetative cover, the
soils, like all McGregor Range soils, are easily eroded.
The
soils possess a relatively high available water capacity and are
moderately alkaline and calcareous throughout.
The soils of the alluvial fans and pediment toeslopes at
the base of the mesa and mountain escarpments are composed of
outwash materials of highly calcareous, coarse-textured sedi­
ments from weathered limestone.
The varied soil mixtures of
sand, silt, clay and gravel are cut with numerous small drain­
ways which expose an increase in gravel content with greater
soil depth.
The available water capacity of the soil is low and
permeability is moderate as water percolates through the
gravelly soil.

THE BOTANICAL RESEARCH

On the level to rolling tableland of Otero Mesa the cal­
careous, generally shallow surface soils consist of varied
mixtures of sand, silt and clay.
The shallow surface layer is
a fine sandy loam.
A hard layer of carbonate cemented material,
restricting root development and water movement, underlies much
of the soil surfaces.
Above this indurated layer, however, the
soils are well drained and possess a moderate available water
capacity_
Due to the fine surface textures, erosion may be a
potential hazard for these soils if vegetation cover were lost,
but unlike soils of the basin, the mesa soils are presently
stabilized by a protective grass cover.
Along the mesa escarpment and mountain slopes, the soils
are shallow and overlie limestone bedrock.
The silty clay loams
are mixed with gravels and only exist as thin mantles in eroded
areas.
On steep slopes rapid runoff has accelerated erosion
and exposed the rock surfaces.
It is not uncommon to find large
colluvial accumulations and partially buried boulders on cat­
step escarpments and at the base of slopes.
Soil accumulations
are best developed along the ephemeral canyon drainages and
arroyos, where deposits of sediments and moisture runoff flow
from the adjacent slopes.
MAJOR VEGETATION AREAS
Based primarily on major variations in topography and/or
plant associations, five relatively discrete vegetation areas
are recognized on McGregor Range.
The area designations given
below indicate the major and/or significant species occurring
in an area and are indicative of the plant associations' import­
ance in the overall plant community.

Range.
The vegetation areas to be discussed in the present
report are closely correlated with the five ecozones outlined
in a recent ecological analysis of the Range (Wyatt 1976).
(A)

The Mesquite - Saltbush - Broom Snakeweed Association

This plant community occurs on the heavily-duned western
portion of the McGregor Range valley floor.
This is the sand
dune-mesquite ecozone of Wyatt and falls in the Lower Sonoran
Life Zone as defined by Bailey (1913).
The flora of the area
is typified by a mesquite-saltbush association atop the coppice
sand dunes. with mixed populations of broom snakeweed, soaptree
yucca (Yuoaa elata) , and sand sage (Artemisia filifoZia) occupy­
ing the interdune deflations.
The soils of this area are subject
to severe erosion by the perennial southwesterly winds.
With
dune stability primarily achieved througb the mesquite root
system, gradual erosion of the dune's windward side may expose
portions of the lateral roots.
This leads to moisture and pos­
sible vegetation losses.
However, in light of slow dune shifts
and leeward accumulations of wind-blown sand, vegetative growth
may continue on the dune's leeward side.
This constant dune
movement and the gradual deposition of sands in the ,interdune
"blow-outs" may eventually lead to dune reversal (Wyatt 1976).
The vegetation complex over this large area is rather homo­
geneous.
The sample data presented in Table 111-1 reflects the
shrub dominance found throughout this region.
Within the sam­
pled areas, the relative plant cover of shrubs and half-shrubs
exceeds 90%, with forbs and grasses accounting for the rest of
the cover.
The figures presented in Table III-I(A) are general­
ly representative of the floral composition for shrubs and half­
shrubs over most of the duned portion of the Range.
Regarding
relative plant cover dominants, the mesquite-saltbush-broom
snakeweed association accounted for over 75% of the total plant
cover.
While such an overwhelming figure could not be obtained
from any given sample, a predominance of these species could be
generally expected almost throughout this vegetation area.
Of
these species, mesquite is of greatest abundance.
Its success
in the community may be due to its dwarf, vine-like habit and
generalized root system, composed of taproot and laterals.
These attributes can give the plant a competitive advantage,
particularly during periods of low available moisture ..
Despite the ubiquitous nature of the mesquite-saltbush­
broom snakeweed association, a number of variations of this basic
template of floral dominants, were observed occurring over large
areas.
Representing no radical departure from the basic species
composition, these areas are of note for their lack of abundance
or absence of the three major species.
The first of these
variants (Table 1II-l[B]), located in the proximity of the North
McGregor Access Road, may be termed a Soaptree Yucca-Sand Sage

THE BOTANICAL RESEARCH

Association.
With one of the densest accumulations (relative
density>40%) of Yucca eZata found on the valley floor, this
area is almost devoid of mesquite and the associative dunes.
The yucca and sand sage (Artemisia fiZifoZia) growths account
for most of the total plant cover (relative cover>90%).
Al­
though these species are normally expected in the early stages
of Prosopis. (mesquite) sand dunecsuccession (CamphelL L929~"
this may indicate a retardation in the rate of mesquite spread.
Another area, considered a variant of the mesquite-salt­
bush-broom snakeweed association, is located at the northern­
most portion of this large vegetation area.
With saltbush
(Atriplex canescens) being of greatest abundance (Table 1II-I
[e]) and showing greatest areal cover, this may be considered
a "saltbush flat." However, unlike the situation one might
normally expect, the soils are only moderately saline.
As is the problem with any description of large vegetation
areas, a number of small populations and individual occurrences
of species may be overlooked.
Generally, the occurrences of
the minor shrubs, forbs and grasses were localized and scat­
tered.
Of note in the interdune areas were the sometimes dense
forb populations of pepperweed (Lepidium spp.), desert baileya
(BaiZeya muZtiradiata), and spectaclepod (Dithyrea ~isli2enii
var. wisliaenii).
Scattered shrub communities of mormon tea
(Ephedra trifurca), Russian thistle (SalsoZa kaZi), creosote
bush (Larrea tridentata) and tarbush (Flourensia cernua) are
fairly common and occur more frequently than those of hoary
rosemary mint (Poliomintha incana) and broom dalea (Dalea
scoparia).
Saline sites support populations of saltbush and
alkali sacaton (Sporobolus airoides), a salt-tolerant grass spe­
cies.
Other less frequent grass species include plains lovegrass
(Eragrostis intermedia), sand dropseed (Sporobolus cryptandrus) ,
and California cottontop (Trichachne californica).
Occasionally,
balloon-sepal maurandya (Maurandya wisli2ennij~ a perennial herb
with a vine-like habit, can be found climbing on the mesquite
shrubs and sprawling over dunes.
Additional herbaceous species
include buffalogourd (Cucurbita foetidissima) , sacred datura
(Datura !J1rif]htii), winged sand verbena (Abronia carnea) , thread­
leaf groundsel (Senecio longiZobus) , many-bristle pectis (Pectis
papposa) and desert verbena (Verbena w~ightiiJ.
Other species
occurring in this area, as well as those of the other veget~tion
areas, can be found listed in Table 111-5.

TheCreosotcebl,J.sh -Ta:Fbush Association

Amid the sand, silts and gravels of the alluvial fans and
fine-textured loams of the valley apron, the Creosotebush
Tarbush (Larrea-Flourensia) Association dominates.
It falls in
the Lower Sonoran Life Zone and includes Wyatt's alluvial fan­
creosotebush eeozone...
Creosotebush appears dominant: on

FLORA SUMMARY AND CHECK LIST

gravelly alluvial soils almost throughout, while tarbush
becomes more prominent in the plant community on the fine­
textured soils of the bottomlands.
The abundance of high-crowned shrubs has contributed little
to soil stability on the fans.
Generally lacking in protective
ground cover, as would be afforded by grasses, the soils have
been severely eroded.
What is left is a gravelly "erosion
pavement" with numerous small, dissecting drainages.
Accounting for over half of the total relative plant cover
in the sample (Table 1II-2[A] ,.relative cover>50%),~creos9te~
bush shows dominanc~ over the better part of the fans, its
widespread distribution noticeable in varying degrees of abund­
ance throughout the McGregor Range.
The presence of creosote­
bush on various soil textures is a phenomenon that has drawn
the attention of investigators in many parts of southern New
Mexico (Anderson 1956; Gardner 1951; Buffington and Herbel
1965).
While its occurrence seems almost unrestricted, edaphic
differences may cause variations in its density, biomass and
cover (Burk and Dick-Peddie 1973). A number of special attri­
butes enable the creosotebush to cope with.a~variety of-environ­
mental factors.
Among these plant characteristics are a "highly
specialized wood" (Metcalfe and Chalk 1950) with numerous
diffuse-porous vessels and many horizontal and vertical rays, a
generalized root system with both vertical and horizontal growth
potential (Cannon 1911; Chew and Chew 1965; Ludwig 1975), and
leaf resin providing an integrated antidesiccant and anti­
herbivore substance (Rhoades, in press) .
Within the sample areas and the Range in general, a major
difficulty sometimes faced in the analysis of the perennial
shrub associations was the close aggregations of individual
shrubs with respect to their overlapping canopies and indiscrete
stems.
Among both pure and mixed creosotebu~bstands, fbr.
example, the shrubs may occur in clumps, closely associated
between single individuals of the same species and between indi­
viduals of different species.
This clumping may lead to
erroneous judgements of the number of individual plants actually
present, even giving the misleading appearance of being a single
plant.
The aggregation of creosotebush shTubs has~been~attrir­
buted to root sprouting and crown splitting (Wright 1970).
The occurrence of other shrubs on the gravelly alluvial
soils in the sample (Table 1II-2[A]) accounts for approximately
20% of the total plant cover.
The tarbush is the most abundant
of these, a reflection of its competitive success with the
creosotebush.
Mesquite, exi1:ibit1.ilg a more.c e·r-e'ct· haldt_ relative
to the growth on the duned area, and broom snakeweed are also
present on the gravelly portion of this gently sloping plain.
Areas of grass development are found infrequently, but drop­
seeds (SporoboZu8 spp.) and bush muhly (MuhZenbergiaporteri)
occasionally cover substantial portions of local areas along

THE BOTANICAL RESEARCH

10

the fans.
The dropseeds are restricted to areas of moist soil
accumulations, and the bush muhly grows successfully under the
creosotebush and tarbush shrubs.
----Other ~prominent species occurring on the alluvial fans,
sometimes showing local dominance, are whitethorn acacia (Aaaaia
aonstriata), mariola parthenium (Parthenium inaanum), ocotillo
(Pouquieria splendens) and prickly pear ca~ti (Opuntia spp.).
Grass species include poverty threeawn (Aristida divariaata) ,
various gramas (Bouteloua spp.), burrograss (Saleropogon brevi­
folius) , feather fingergrass (Chloris virgata) and plains bristle­
grass (Setaria maarostaahya).
At the most distal portions of the fans and flats of the
valley apron, fine-textured soils support an interesting flora
containing elements of both the duned area and the gravelly por­
tions of the alluvial fans.
Plant species of both these vegeta­
tion areas are represented in this mixed community situated be­
tween the two major biomes (Table 1II-2[B]).
Tarbush (Plourensia
aernua) becomes co-dominant with creosotebush on the 10
flats
but both species must compete wi
e mes
ing pockets of sand dune.
The flora associated with the sand
dunes generally becomes more prominent in this "transitional"
area.
Of interest in the sample is the occurrence of Coulter
conyza (Conyza couZteri).
This erect, tap-rooted annual herb and
the closely related horseweed (Conyza aanaden8is) occur in low
deflations, areas of disturbance, and similar places of moisture
accumulation.
Other herbaceous species include narrowleaf globe­
mallow (SphaeraZcea angustifolia) , slender gaillardia (Gaillardia
pinnatifida), wooly sumpweed (Iva dealbata) and silverleaf night­
shade" (So tanum e leagnifo lium) .
Shrub spec ies s ca t ter ed through­
out are represented by the leafless allthorn (Koeberlinia
spinosa), lotebush (Ziziphus obtusifolia) and knifelead condalia
(CondaZia spathulata) , in addition to the plants previously men­
tioned.
(C)

Grassland:

Gramas - Dropseeds - Vine Mesquite

The Grassland portion of the McGregor Range occupies the vast
expanse atop Otero Mesa and the isolated upland plains just east
of the Hueco Mountains.
Essentially the mesa-grassland eco?one
described by Wyatt, this vegetation area exhibits more soil-plant
stability than that evident on the valley floor.
Occurring on the
perimeter of a major grassland association, this formation may
perhaps be a minor faciation or natural sub-division of the vast
Short-Grass Plains discussed by Carpenter (1940).
Covering the gently undulating landscape, the grass develop­
ment of these areas is almost impressive in light of the dominance
of xeric shrubs found on the valley floor.
A number of grass
species are prominent in the grassland areas of McGregor Range,

FLORA SUMMARY AND CHECK LIST

11

principally grama grasses (BouteZoua spp.), dropseeds (SporoboZus
spp.) and vine mesquite (Panieum obtusum).
While small shrub communities and scattered individuals do
appear on the soils of the grassland areas, their abundance and
distribution is restricted, in~part, by the presence of an indur­
:ated layer of calcium carbonate under much of the soil surface.
Occurring at sometimes shallow depths, this stratified layer of
calcareous hardpan, or caliche, restricts root development and
water movements.
Shrub taproots are unable to penetrate the hard
caliche, thereby reducing the distribution of the shrubs.
Only
those plants with an adapted root system or vertical growth
'potential can successfully establish" themselves in the community.
Oreosotebush, as was indicated earlier, _i$ one such shrub~
e presence of a caliche layer and the depth of its occur­
rence are important variables in regard to drought effects on a
grassland ecosystem.
Generally, the occurrence of a caliche
layer at shallow depths improves water relations during drought
(Herbel et al. 1972).
Grasses utilize moisture more readily from
surface area soils.
They are assisted in this by the presence of
a caliche layer in sh~llow soils since the almost impermeable
nature of caliche enables it to hold moisture at more readily ob­
tainable depths for use by the grasses.
The grass communities of the mesa and Hueco Mountain regions
occur in both mixed and pure stands.
The blue grama (BouteZoua
graailis) has been reported to be dominant (Wyatt 1976), but
judging from the observed variations in species composition, it
would be reasonable to assume local dominance of various species.
The great variety of grass species includes side-oats grama
(BouteZoua eurtipenduZa) , tobosa (HiZaria mutiea) , bush muhly,
vine mesquite, mesa dropseed (SporoboZus fZexuosus) , sand dropseed
(SporoboZus eryptandrus) , as well as others.
Large shrub communities are generally restricted to the
gravelly alluvial soils along the mesa perimeter and along the
upper banks of arroyo drainages.
Isolated shrub communities also
occur widely scattered throughout the mesa.
Creosotebush is a
major shrub component, with broom snakeweed, mariola parthenium
(Parthenium inaanum) and saltbush also occurring. Along the
arroyo banks, little-leaf sumac (Rhus mierophyZZa) and skeleton
goldeneye (Viguiera stenoloba) become prominent, with desert
willow (Chi Zopsis Zinearis) , spli t 1 eaf bri c kellbush (Br,iake Zlia
laainiata) and apache plume (FaZZugia paradoxa) comprising the
riparian association of the ephemeral drainages.
Of note is the rather extensive distribution of soaptree
yucca (Yuaaa eZata) over the rolling landscape.
Perhaps reaching
its highest density in the area of El Paso Draw, the soaptree
yucca is mixed in a "savanna-like" association with dropseeds and
grama grasses.
Other shrub species include cane cholla (Opuntia
imbriaata var. imbricata) , reaching heights over 3 meters, and

widely scattered individuals of javelina bush (CondaZia eriaoides)
and allthorn (KoeberZinia spinosa).
Herbaceous species, to name a
few, include white pricklepoppy (Argemone aZbiflora) , tansy mus­
tard (Desaurainia pinnata) , leatherweed croton (Croton pottsii var.
pottsii), desertholly perezia (Perezia nana) , wooly paperflower
(Psilostrophe tagetina) and plumed thistle (Cirsium texanum).

Sotol - Ocotillo - Agave (Mixed Scrub) Association

The Mixed Scrub community on McGregor Range covers an exten­
sive area of the mesa escarpment and mountain ranges.
It includes
portions of Wyatt's foothill, draws-yucca, grasslands and the un­
described areas of the mountain ranges.
The flora is diverse;
species generally associated with both the Upper and Lower Sonoran
Life Zones (Bailey 1913) occur.
Xeric species dominate the slopes
and ridges while more mesic elements are introduced into the com­
munities along the ephemeral drainages.
A number of interacting factors influencing plant development
in this area have produced a complex arrayal of plant distributions
not evident in the previously discussed vegetation areas.
Not only
is vegetation dependant on geology, erosional topography and their
influence on soil development, but also on the aspects of slope
orientation, elevation and runoff rates.
While determination of
the relative importance of these factors in affecting plant pro­
ductivity is not within the scope of this report, it is well to
consider these variables in an examination of plant communities and
their distributions in this area.
Soil development on the rugged slopes is generally slight, due
to the erosion of soil materials by wind and runoff.
On steep
slopes, accelerated erosion has exposed large barren areas of the
limestone bedrock surfaces.
Such conditions effectively reduce the
area of possible plant establishment.
The slope vegetation of the
uplands is dominated by xeric shrubs and grasses.
As are demon­
strated in the samples (Table 111-3), small and generally scattered
populations of creasotebush, mariola parthenium, ·odotillo (Fouqui­
eria spZendens) , sotol (Dasylirion wheeleri)~ broom snakeweed, and
mescal (Agave parryi) occur in varying densities and cover, depend­
ing on soil accumulation and runoff pattern.
Other prominent
shrub species, sometimes showing local dominance, include skeleton
goldeneye (Viguiera stenoloba), spanish dagger (Yuaaa torreyi),
tarbush, lechuguilla (Agave leaheguilZa) and shaggy mountain maho­
gany (Ceraoaarpus montanus var. pauaidentatus).
Of these species,
the lechuguilla is restricted in its distribution to the Hueco
Mountains where it appears more abundant than the closely-related
mescal (Agave pa~pyi).
.
Grass species, while rarely dominant on the slopes, are
represented by thteeawns (Aristida spp.), grama grasses, princi­
pally side-oats grama (Bouteloua aurtipendula) , and fluffgrass
(Erioneuron pulahellum).
Other common species occurring mostly

FLORA SUMMARY AND CHECK LIST

as isolated clumps or individuals include green sprangletop
(LeptochZoa dubia), wolf tail (Lycurus phZeoides), indian rice­
grass (Oryzopsis hymenoides) and burrograss (ScZeropogon brevi­
foZius) .
Minor woody species scattered on depositional cracks and
shelves and other areas of slight soil accumulation include
agar ito (Berberis trifoZioZata), feather dalea (DaZea formosa),
rock-spiraea (Petrophytum caespitosum), mormon tea (Ephedra spp.)
and aloysia (AZoysia wrightii).
Sometimes growing densely along
slope runoffs, populations of ocotillo, mountain mahogany and
whitethorn acacia occur in mixed or pure stands.
Ferns are
commonly found sheltered under ledges and large boulders.
Lip­
fern (CheiZanthes spp.) and star cloakfern (NothoZaena standZeyi)
are restricted to such places, while the wavy cloakfern (Notho­
Zaena sinuata) may also occur on exposed portions of the slopes.
The peaks and ridges support a sparse vegetation cover.
Sotol and ocotillo are widely scattered, with mescal (Agave
parryi) fringing the mountain ridges.
The rolling or level
summits of the hills can be characterized as having "open" vegeta­
tion.
With only a few shrubs present, this area provides habitat
for the wild onion (AZZium spp.).
Turning to a consideration of the vegetation on the lower
depositional slopes and arroyo terraces, many of the same species
occurring on the mid and upper slopes are present here also.
However, the densities and cover of these species increase
(Table III-4) due to the deposition of soil material washed from
the local highlands.
Generally, an increased vigor of plant
individuals appears evident due to the improved moisture status.
The incidence of more mesic species is also noted on these
narrow bands of accumulated soil.
Among shrub species, creosotebush is dominant, in both
pure and mixed stands.
Mariola parthenium and broom snakeweed
are important shrub components, along with lesser numbers of
tarbush, skeleton goldeneye, mesquite, and allthorn.
Slightly
more mesic shrubs occurring mostly as scattered individuals
include littleleaf sumac (Rhus microphyZZa) and skunkbush (Rhus
aromatica var. piZosissima), with fragrant ash (Fraxinus cus­
pidata), oaks (Quercus spp.), and netleaf hackberry (CeZtis
reticuZata) appearing along the banks of the drainages.
The ash,
oaks, and hackberry have assumed a shrub and small tree habit in
response to the moisture levels afforded by the ephemefal drain­
ages and moisture runoff from the adjacent slopes.
Cacti, both
prickly pears and chollas (Opuntia spp.), may form dense growths
in local areas.
Grasses may comprise a substantial portion of the vegetative
cover along the arroyo terraces.
Side-oats grama and bush muhly
form the shrub understories, while bluestems (BothriochZoa spp.
and Schizachyrium scoparium) and dropseeds (SporoboZus spp.) may
occur in small, isolated clumps.
Other important grasses include

14

THE BOTANICAL RESEARCH

threeawns, tanglehead (Heteropogon contortus), New Mexico feather
grass (Stipa neomexicana) , and black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda).
Along the margins of the drainages, in the arroyos, and out
on alluvial islands, desert willow (Chilopsis linearis), seep­
willow (Baccharis glutinosa) , apache plume (Fallugia paradoxa),
burrobrush (Hymenoclea monogyra), and splitleaf brickellbush
(Brickellia laciniata) form the riparian vegetation of this region.
The shrub growths of fragrant ash, oaks, and netleaf hackberry are
also considered part of this association.
Other species, not
considered riparian, have extended out from the adjacent slopes
and terraces onto the gravelly depositional bars of the ephemeral
streams.

Pinyon -

Juniper Association

While not covering an extensive area of the McGregor Range,
the Pinyon - Juniper (Pinus edulis - Juniperus monosperma) Associ­
ation represents the lower limit of the dense pinyon - juniper zone
lying just outside the Range perimeter in the Sacramento Mountains.
Considered indicator plants of the Upper Sonoran Life Zone, these
species provide an arboreal element not previously encountered in
the other vegetation areas of the Range.
Elevation must be considered a major factor influencing the
occurrence of the pinyon pine and one-seeded juniper in this mon­
t an e region .
Generally , below 600 0 feet,. x era. c s P Ii c i e s 0 f the'
Mixed Scrub Association comprise the plant community.
Above this
area, scattered individuals of pinyon and juniper commonly occur
mixed with xeric species on gentle slopes.
In isolated areas, rolling, "intra-montane meadows" are found
covered by luxuriant growths of grasses.
These grassy fields,
such as in the area known as "Crest Gardens," are surrounded by
low, rolling limestone hills which provide moisture and sediments.
The thick carpets of grama grasses, plains bristlegrass (Setaria
macrostachya) , and bush muhly are interspersed with scattered
shrubs.
Mountain mahogany, red barberry (Berberis haematocarpa) ,
cane cholla, and yuccas are the most common of these shrubs.
Pinyon and juniper are represented by open stands on the surround­
ing hills.
While the vegetation of McGregor Range can be readily cate­
gorized into relatively distinct zones, an overlap in species dis­
tribution is common.
However, the relative abundance of the plants
varies considerably within each of the major vegetation areas.
A
list of plant species and their areas of occurrence can be found
in Table 111-5.

FLORA SUMMARY AND CHECK LIST

TABLES
Methods of vegetation analysis vary with the nature of the
vegetation and the study goals.
Any modification of methodology
and application depends on the composition and structure of the
floral elements.
Generally, a synthesis of different methods is
utilized, and techniques best suited to a plant community are
applied (cf. Curtis and Cottam 1962; PPillips 19~9).
The sampling approach to the vegetation of McGregor Range
involved use of both transects and the line-intercept method.
The transects consist of elongated sample plots of 50 square
meters (50 x 1 m.) in which the data are recorded sequentially
in a series of segmented, contiguous sub-plots.
This procedure
of recording plant data as it is encountered and the sub-plot
segmentation allow for the same statistical treatments as can be
performed with the more popular square-shaped quadrats.
The sub­
plots are 5 square meters (5 x l m.) in size and are termed'
"quadrats fl for their use in this report.
In application, multiple
transects were placed in adjacent positions to one another, so as
to best indicate transitions in vegetation distribution and be­
tween plant associations.
Both frequency and density measures
can be derived from the use of the transects.
In an effort to circumvent problems arising from the use of
transects in grassland and low shrub communities, the line­
intercept method was implemented to provide additional plant data.
Invariably, crown-splitting and the lack of discrete stems among
shrubs and grasses make it difficult to obtain reliable figures
and to interpret their values.
The use of the line-intercept
makes it possible to avoid these difficulties.
In use, one or
more 50-meter tapes are stretched at ground level across a plant
community.
The length of line intercepting the individual spe­
cies is computed in terms of actual total area covered by that
species.
It is assumed that the area of above-ground parts of
each species is an adequate measure of its importance in the
community.

Flora of the McGregor Range
The following list of plant species is essentially based on
specimens collected on the McGregor Range during the field period
(July, September, and October, 1975).
While it is incomplete,
most of the prominent species are included.
The order is phylo­
genetic by family, following a modified Engler and Prantl system;
genus and species are listed alphabetically.
Preferred vernacu­
lar names are listed in parentheses.
In addition, plant occur­
rences in the various vegetation/distribution areas are indicated
by letter codes.
Species not observed during the field period,
but reported in a recent study of McGregor Range (Wyatt 1976) are
marked with an asterisk.
The following reference keys were consulted: Correll and
Johnston 1970; Gould 1973; Vines 1960.

VEGETATION CHANGES DURING THE PAST ONE-HUNDRED YEARS
Given the importance of the environmental factors to cultur­
al development and subsistence pattern interpretation, it is
necessary to understand the dynamic character of the vegetation
in the area.
Radical shifts in plant distribution and pattern of
occurrence between past and present must be considered in any
final analysis of the area's cultural resources.
Presently, the vegetation of the study area is diverse,
varying from a mesa grassland formation, a complex of xeric
species and a savanna-like pinyon-juniper zone in the montane
regions, and a desert scrub dominance on the basin lowlands.
Similar to other parts of southern New Mexico, the flora of the
basin portion of the McGregor Range has formed in a Prosopis
(mesquite) dune field on the lower valley areas and a Larrea­
FZourensia (creosotebush-tarbush) association on the gravelly
alluvial fans (Wyatt 1976; see page 8).
The wide-spread occurrence of these plant associations in
other areas of southern New Mexico and the study of climax condi­
tions prior to the establishment of the associations have
attracted the interest of a number of investigators (Gardner
1951; Buffington and Herbel 1965; York and Dick-Peddie 1969).
The findings of these studies generally indicate a great reduc­
tion in the areal cover of grama grass (BouteZoua sp.) and an
expansion in the populations of-woody species, primarily creosote­
bush, mesquite, and juniper during the past hundred years.
In­
tensive grazing of domestic livestock is considered the causative
factor for this shift.
While it may be generally assumed that this pattern of
vegetation change is consistent throughout much of southern New
Mexico, little information directly related to the Range area is
available in previous writings.
In an attempt to verify the fact
of these vegetation changes within the study area, this research
was focused, in part, toward developing a preliminary interpreta­
tion of the nature of these changes and a partial reconstruction
of the vegetation pattern shifts that have taken place on the
McGregor Range during the past hundred years.
Drawing from the method employed in the York and Dick-Peddie
st~d~, records of the New Mexico Territorial Land Surveys~ per­
formed on the area currently occupied by the McGregor Range, were
examined.
The original survey handbooks are stored in the office
of the Bureau of Land Management in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
Largely evaluating the land in terms of its agricultural poten­
tial, the early surveyors noted the dominant vegetation forms
along the various survey lines of every township, and provided
additional information regarding the vegetation in a short sum­
mary of the entire township.

THE BOTANICAL RESEARCH

While it was not possible to examine the records for each
line of all sections within a township, information gleaned from
the township boundary surveys and the township summaries provides
preliminary evidence for the presence of a radically different
vegetation type during the late 1800's.
The presence of a luxur­
iant grassland~ which from previous studies was assumed to have
occurred~ is verified by the survey records as having been esta­
blished on the McGregor Range area. Moreover, a number of un­
expected shrub forms are reported to have occurred in scattered
to dense populations.
As is graphically illustrated in Figures
III-I, -2, -3, -4, the current vegetation pattern of mesquite
dune field and creosotebush-tarbush dominance in the basin was
preceded by a mosaic of relatively pure grassland and mixed
populations of oak, mesquite, and juniper.
The following excerpts from the township summaries are indi­
cative of the descriptions used in the reconstruction of the
vegetation patterns of the presett1ement period.
The surveyors'
names and survey dates are included.
(a) Township 22 South~ Range 9 East
S. R. Biggs; March, 1884
"The land is generally rolling to broken.
Soil is
usually sandy and produces a fine growth of grass
which is occasionally cut for hay.
A dense growth
of mesquite, scrub cedar, and oak covers a large
portion of the township."
(b) Township 22 South, Range 10 East
S. R. Biggs; March, 1884
"Land in eastern portion of the township is mountainous.
The western portion is much smoother and is generally
covered with a dense growth of scrub oak.
Grass in
some instances is very fine and grows in great abund­
ance."
(c) Township 23 South, Range 9 East
S. R. Biggs; February 1884
"[Soil is] generally of sandy nature and produces a
fine crop of grass.
[The township is] best adapted to
grazing purposes, with grasses sufficientty good for hay
in places."
(d) Township 23 South, Range 10 East
S. R. Biggs; March 1884
"Soil is sandy and grass is first rate, well suited to
grazing.
Portions of township are covered with a dense
undergrowth of mesquite, cedar [juniper], and scrub
oak."
(e) Township 24 South, Range 8 East
L. M. Lampton; January - February 1884
"The land is general;t:y level and is covered with a fine
growth of grass.
Quite dense growths of mesquite,
scrub oak, and juniper are found in places."

VEGETATION CHANGES

43

(f) Township 25 South, Range 8 East
L. M. Lampton; January 1884
"Generally sandy and covered with a fine growth of
grass.
Soil is quite good and with water could be
made productive.
Excellently adapted to grazing,
being of a gently rolling nature and producing ex­
cellent grasses.
Generally covered with a scattered
growth of mesquite and oak brush."
From the given descriptions, it is apparent that a dramatic
shift in vegetation distribution and dominance has occurred
during the past hundred yea~s.
The present lack of substantial
grass populations and the total absence of oak and juniper on
the basin floor attest to the extent of the change.
Addition­
ally, it is interesting to note that the oaks are presently
restricted to riparian mountain habitats and that the junipers
only occur as scattered individuals in the mountainous regions
and in the higher elevations of the pinyon-juniper zone of the
Sacramento Mountains.
Unlike the situation encountered in other
areas of southern New Mexico (York and Dick-Peddie 1969), this
represents a reduction in the population and areal distribution
of juniper.
Turning to a consideration of the period of transition
between past and present vegetation, it is necessary to review
the descriptions of townships occurring adjacent to those al­
ready examined.
A number of townships, sharing similar contempo­
rary plant, so i1, and to po graphic c ondi t ions wi th thos e_-,o f: the
illustrated areas and having been surveyed at later dates,
serves as a basis of comparison in establishing a probable period
of transition.
(g) Township 21 South, Range 9 East
F. G. Dorman; January 1917
"Mostly level, with the exception of a -streak of low,
rolling sand hills about 3 miles wide in the eastern
half of the township and along a strip in the northern
portion.
The rest of the township is a hard sandy 1aom.
No grass in the sand hills, but a fair growth [occurs]
<'e1sewhere-±n the township.
The sand hills are covered
with a dense growth of chamiza, mesquite,aand~soapweed;
. hard sandy loam with scattered greasewood, soap­
weed, and scrub mesquite."
(h) Township 24 South, Range 7 East
T. D. Daley; November - December 1924
"
. rolling sand dunes covered with growths of
mesquite and soapweed.
Soil is mostly sandy and raises
very good forage grasses."
(i) Township 25 South, Range 7 East
C. W. Devendorf and H. D. Voight; March 1915
"Township lies nearly level and is a typical desert.
[Would be] fair for grazing if there was a water supply.

THE BOTANICAL RESEARCH

Where there are no sand hummocks, there is considerable
grass and an abundance of mesquite, yucca, and sage
throughout, [with the] undergrowth more plentiful in
the dunes."
With the exception of the mention of "good," "fair," and
"considerable" grass, the preceding summaries are highly descrip­
tive of the floral and soil conditions presently found on these
townships.
The major shrub dominants comprising the communities
today are noted in the later surveys.
These include the chamiza
or fourwing saltbush (Atriplex aanesaens) , the soapweed or soap­
tree yucca (Yucca elata), the greasewood or creosotebush, and
sage or sand sage (Artemisia filifolia).
Although these townships share similar environmental factors
with the earlier-surveyed areas, no mention of oak or juniper is
made.
This may indicate a loss of the basin populations of these
plants during a period prior to 1915.
It is possible that this
may have been the resultant impact of early settlers in the area.
The lack of useable timber for building and fuel may have placed
these woody plants at a premium.
Grasses, while reduced in abundance, are seemingly thriving
during the period of the surveys.
The diminished importance of
grasses in the overall cover is nonetheless apparent from these
accounts.
Today little or no grasses are found in these areas,
and certainly are not sufficiently abundant for forage or grazing
purposes.
One aspect of the McGregor Range environmental conditions,
as yet untreated, is the encroachment of the highly unstable sand
dunes.
While the soil was considered "sandy" in the earlier
1880's survey, sand dunes were no~ mentioned or described.
Given
the ubiquitous nature of the dunes today, it is highly unlikely
that their existence would have gone unmentioned had the same
situation existed at the time of the surveys.
The lack of an
extensive dune phenomenon during the late 1880 surveys greatly
contrasts with the accounts given in the later surveys.
The
later surveys, conducted in the early 1900's, all indicate and
refer to the presence of dunes through such expressions as "sand
hills" and "sand hummocks." Apparently the dune field had
largely established itself prior to 1915, which may be expected
given the relationship between soil stability and vegetation
shifts from grassland formation to desert scrub.
However, ~t
must be noted that small pockets of sand dunes were present as
early as the 1880's (Figure III-I).
Perhaps covering an area too
small to deserve mention in the township summaries, these pockets
were noted along a line of a township boundary survey and may
represent a source area of dune expansion.
The preceding examination of survey reports and the discus­
sion of the findings have been largely consistent with the find­
ings of previous studies of other areas of southern New Mexico.
Based on these early records, the lack of an extensive dune field

VEGETATION CHANGES

47

development and the absence of creosotebush are striking. More­
over, the "pristine" grassland formation on the valley floor was
broken by sometimes dense growths of scrub oak and juniper brush
during the 1880's.
These plants are no longer represented on
any portion of the valley floor, having been reduced in areal
distribution and displaced to the mountainous regions.
The findings of this report are restricted to the period of
the past hundred years.
However, the implication is inescapable
that floral composition and, subsequently, floral resources,
during the era of aboriginal occupation greatly contrasted with
the composition and distribution patterns of the contemporary
flora.
Extensive study of the paleo-environment and ecological
dynamics in the area is necessary for a final analysis and
definitive insight into their influences on cultural development.

AN ETHNOBOTANICAL OVERVIEW
OF THE FLORA OF McGREGOR RANGE
To those familiar with the arid southwestern United States,
the desert is a land of striking contrasts.
The spectacular
beauty of its sunsets, the enchantment of its rough, broken
mountain ranges, and the overwhelming fragrances after a sudden
summer thunderstorm can only be rivaled by the landts challenge
to human survival.
The lack of surface water, the intense inso­
lation, and radical day-night temperature fluctuations can only
be overcome by a strong will and a very thorough understanding
of the desert environment.
For simple survival, one of the most
important aspects of this understanding is the knowledge and
ability to exploit the natural floral resources.
Plant potential is immeasurable as a source of foodstuffs,
medicine and raw material for the manufacture of cultural goods.
The early native inhabitants adapted to this region by making
ample use of the available flora.
Not until the late nineteenth
century, however, did travelers and ethnographers begin to docu­
ment the information.
These early recorders (Havard 1895, 1896;
Newberry 1887) focused on species inventory and use, while later
treatments probed more extensively the floral significance to
cultural structure (Swank 1932; Whiting 1939).
In addition,
other ethnobotanists have contributed excellent works (Castetter
1935; Castetter, Bell and Grove 1938).
Largely collected through
first-hand transmission of information from Indians to -observer,
these works form the foundation of our knowledge of southwestern
ethnobotany and are impossible to replicate.
Given the probable importance of the McGregor Range flora on
past subsistence patterns, data regarding plants used by south­
western aboriginal groups have been compiled from existing
studies.
Necessarily a narrow overview of southwestern ethno­
botany and restricted to the McGregor Range flora, the investiga­
tion nonetheless illustrates the high resource potential of
desert plants and their importance to desert cultures.
It must be emphasized that this treatment is not intended as
a statement of certainty regarding plant uses by the various
populations which occupied McGregor Range.
It is meant to pro­
vide an insight into the native plant resource potential and
possible uses of the plants available to them.
.
The wide variety of patterns in cultural developments among
Indian populations within a relatively small area (the American
Southwest) led to the wide variety of uses of many of the same
plant species.
However, due to the diversity of cultural pat­
terns, different portions of the biotic environment were exploited
by different groups or similar portions were exploited in dif­
ferent ways (Burgess 1965).
The use of the fruit of a given plant
for food by one group might be contrasted to the use of only the
49

50

THE BOTANICAL RESEARCH

leaves for medicinal purposes by another group.
This is largely
responsible for the generalized treatment of the McGregor Range
flora.
However, the emphasis on the flora and its potential uses
precludes need for specific reference to individual groups.
Of 220 taxa identified from McGregor Range, over half have
-been recorded to be of direct use to people.
An analysis is possible
by subdivision of the 116 plant taxa into multiple "resource
elements." Resource elements are defined by identifying a plant
structure (derived from general nomenclature; i.e' 3 roots, stems,
flowers, etc.) in association with a specific cultural use (e.g' 3
food, medicine, material cultural goods).
Accordingly, multiple
uses of a plant part yield multiple resource elements.
Where a
plant part was reportedly used in similar ways by different popu­
lations, that part was considered a single element.
Arrangement of these items in general categories of cultural
use shows interesting correlations to their major distributional
areas on McGregor Range (Table 111-6).
Selected for optimal
flexibility and simplicity, the categories of use cover the broad
range of resource elements within generally recognized classes of
cultural needs.
Nutritive, medicinal, ceremonial, and other
material goods resources are analyzed both on the basis of their
overall relative occurrences throughout the McGregor Range and
their relative occurrences within each of the major vegetation
(distribution) areas.
In addition, attention is given to the
distribution area showing the greatest abundance of resource
elements.
Given the priority of food needs in human survival, it is not
surprising that the bulk of resource elements should be of nutri­
tive use.
The relatively high percentage (40%) of the total
elements used for food is almost twice that of any other category
of use (Table 111-6, ATi and %ATi).
This assignment of priority
is supported by the internal analysis of use within each of the
various distribution areas.
In every area, the elements of nutri­
tive value proved to be dominant (Table 111-6, Ti and %U) and,
except for Area A (mesquite - saltbush - broom snakeweed associa­
tion), the elements of nutritive value reflected the striking pro­
portion of dominance that was mentioned for the composite food
item total of the entire study area.
Among the major food items
are the fruits of the datil (Yucca baaaata) , the seeds of the
var ious grasses, the young shoots of Chenopodium spp., and, -of
course, the heart of the monocarpic Agave Pappyi, a source of
"mescal."
Next in importance are the elements serving the narcotic!
medicinal needs of desert peoples.
Some of the species used
pharmacologically have a scientific basis for their reported cura­
tive effects.
For example, the effective narcotic and anaesthetic
use of the sacred datura (Datupa Wpightii) was due to the powerful
alkaloid, atropine.
However, the effectiveness of other species

ETHNOBOTANICAL OVERVIEW

51

can be attributed to placebo effects.
Regardless of their physio­
logical effect, medicinal applications of the flora were certainly
a major concern of desert cultures as over 20% of the composite
total of all resource elements is related to this use.
The category of ceremonial/folk-belief related elements is
undoubtedly broad and complex.
However, the significance of such
elements can only be meaningful within a specific cultural con­
text and, as such, its applicability to the McGregor Range flora
is limited.
It would be reasonable to say that, even given
information concerning the cultural context, the association
between certain species and a particular belief or ceremony is
not readily understood, and that only rarely is the association
seemingly obvious.
For example, it is not apparent why wolf­
berry (Lyaium sp.) is involved in the Niman Kachina dance among
the Hopi (Whiting 1939), while rushes (Juncus spp.), a highly
mesic species, appear in Hopi ceremonies as water symbols.
It was intended that the method employed in the compilation
and subsequent treatment of the resource elements with a cere­
monial use would transcend need for in-depth ethnographic under­
standing of specific cultures.
The writer recognizes that the
approach may in some way play a part in the consistently low
figures derived for this use.
However, the 10% total resource
element figure for ceremonial uses may very well be reasonable
in light of its importance relative to such important concerns
as food, medicine, and shelter.
Lastly, the category of plant resources for other items of
material culture acts as a catch-all or miscellaneous category
for the great number of uses of 6ther native "desert plants.
Included are sources of building materials, weapons, fibers,
ornamentals, dyes, soap, and other necessary goods not appro­
priately aligned under previous headings.
The percentage of the
total resource elements in all areas included in the other
material goods category (24.61%) is only slightly more «1.%)
than that for medicinal uses.
Somewhat difficult to compare
with the more specifically defined (former) categories of use,
this broad category includes resource elements much too important
to chance their being overlooked in smaller subdivided categories.
Turning to a consideration of distribution areas (see page 4)
and the area importance, a review of Table 111-6 indicates that
the greatest number of elements occurred in Area D (So~ol­
Ocotillo-Agave Association or Mixed Scrub Association).
The 35%
total-element figure represents a considerable margin of greater
occurrences when compared to the <20% total element occurrences
of Area B (the Creosotebush-Tarbush-Broom Snakeweed Association),
the area of second greatest abundance in total element occur­
rences.
The Mixed Scrub Association covers a large area of the
McGregor Range, including the pediment slopes of mountain ranges
and deeply dissected canyon stream;beds.
The greater proportion

THE BOTANICAL RESEARCH

52

of resource elements available in such an area is undoubtedly due
to both the areal size and, more importantly, the presence of
more diverse habitats for floral development.
A greater diversity
of xeric and more mesic species would obviously give rise to more
resource elements available for exploitation.
It is not herein intended to compile a lengthy review of the
floral resources; rather a table of plant species and recorded use
has been prepared for the interested reader.

tionon availability and distribution within the study area is

Distribution Areas
(A)

Mesquite - Saltbush - Broom Snakeweed Association

(Prosopia gZanduZosa var. Torrevana - AtripZex canescens XanthocephaZum Sarothrae):
Occupying the western portion of the McGregor Range valley floor,
this area is typified by a mesquite - saltbush association atop
the coppice dunes.
A stabilizing vector, the low, scrub mesquite
spreads atop the dunes, its adventitious roots contributing to
additional dune stability.
The inter-dune vegetation is pre­
dominately broom snakeweed, sand sage (Ar·temisia fiZifoZia) , and
soaptree yucca (Yucca eZata).
(B)

Creosotebush - Tarbush - Broom Snakeweed Association

(Larrea tridentata - FZourensia cernua - XanthocephaZum
Sarothrae) :
the Larrea­
How­
ever, it is not unusual for creosotebush to be co-dominant with
whitethorn acacia (Acacia constricta), bush muhly (MuhZenbergia
Porteri) , or broom snakeweed in local areas along the fans.
Vegetation of lesser importance include ocotillo (Fouquieria
spZendens) , mariola parthenium (Parthenium incanum), Spanish
dagger (Yucca Torreyi) , sotol (DasyZirion sp.), and various
cacti.
Amid the sand, silt, and gravel of the alluvial fans,

Flourensia Desert Shrub (creosotebush-tarbush) dominates.

(C)

Grassland:

Primarily, atop the mesa, a rolling to level grassland of gramas
(BouteZoua spp.), dropseeds (Sporobolus spp.), and vine mesquite
(Panicum obtusum) comprises the maj or I if e-form. This. is broken
by occasional shrub communities and the riparian associations
along arroyo cuts.
(D)
Sotol - Ocotillo - Agave Association or Mixed Scrub
Association (Dasylirion sp. - Fouquieria splendens - Agave
sp. ) ;
This is a conglomerate of portions of both mountain ranges and
the mesa escarpment.
Slope, drainage, exposure, and other factors

54

THE BOTANICAL RESEARCH

at work here drastically affect the distribution of plant communi­
ties.
The presence of both mesic and xeric habitats results in
greater floral diversity.
The slopes and pediments are covered
with scattered ocotillo, sotol, Agave lecheguilla (Hueco Mountains
only), and tree cholla (Opuntia imbpicata).
Riparian communities
consist of desert willow (Chilopsis linearis), splitleaf brickell­
bush (Bpickellia laciniata), and apache plume (Fallugia papadoxa).
(E)
Pinyon - Juniper Association (Pinus edulis - Juniperus
monospepma):
In the Sacramento Mountains elevation is a major factor affecting
plant distribution.
Generally, below 6000 feet, xeric species
are predominately found.
Yuccas, broom snakeweed, ocotillo, and
sotol are common on slopes with Parry agave fringing the mountain
ridges.
It is not uncommon for grasses, particularly side-oats
grama (Bouteloua curtipendula) , to show co-dominance on the moister
slopes.
Above this area, upward to the McGregor Range boundary, a
mixture of xeric species, grasses, pinyon pine, and one-seeded
juniper becomes prevalent.
It represents the lower limit of the
dense pinyon-juniper zone that lies outside the range perimeter.

THE BOTANICAL RESEARCH

POTENTIAL CULTURAL USES OF THE PLANTS OF McGREGOR RANGE
A cursory understanding of the resource potential within a
vegetation area can be obtained through the review of past and
recorded uses of the flora by Southwestern abor
inal populations.
The following is a compilation of such plant-use data as related
to the plants of McGregor Range.
It must be emphasized that the
information presented is merely intended as an insight into plant
resource potential and possible uses and not intended as an ex­
haustive, encyclopedic treatment of Southwestern ethnobotany.
The list is arranged alphabetically by genus and species with the
common names in parentheses.
It should be noted that, while not
observed during the field period, a few species have been included
on the basis of their high probability of occurrence.
Generally self-explanatory, the various headings focus on
1) economically valuable portions of the plants, 2) their use and,
whenpQssible, ,method of preparation, 3) seasonal availability,
and 4) distribution.
Availability reflects the period of possible
harvesting for maximum exploitation of useful plant parts.
Dis­
tribution analysis is based on the observed occurrence of a spe­
cies within the biomes associated with major topographic features
of McGregor Range.

THE BOTANICAL RESEARCH

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I would like to thank Dr. M. C. Johnston of the Department of
Botany, University of Texas at Austin, and Dr. Richard Spellenberg
at the Department of Biological Sciences, New Mexico State Univer­
sity, for their assistance and cooperation in allowing me access
to the excellent collections and facilities in their respective
herboria.
I am also indebted to Mary Butterwick, botanist for the
Natural Areas Survey, University of Texas at Austin, for her con­
tribution to the floral checklist of McGregor Range.
I would also like to thank Phil Derr and the staff of the Soil
Survey party at the district Soil Conservation Service office in
Alamagordo, New Mexico, for supplying soils data.
Much appreciation goes to the library system at the University
of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico.
I was allowed access to
the ethnobotanical and ethnographic literature stored in special
collections.
The report on the vegetation changes could only be possible
with the information gleaned from the Territorial Survey Records
kept by the Bureau of Land Management, Santa Fe, New Mexico.
I
am indebted to their helpful staff for making the task much simpler.
I would like to thank Kim Hale for deciphering my original
handwritten manuscripts and preparing and typing them for submittal
to the Texas Archeological Survey, editorial staff.

RECONNAISSANCE GEOLOGY: IMPLICATIONS FOR THE
ANALYSIS OF HUMAN OCCUPATION
John D. Pigott

ABSTRACT
The geology and geomorphic processes of the Holocene exhibit
a dramatic effect upon prehistoric site distribution in the region
of McGregor Range.
The following parameters appear to affect the
distribution of defined aboriginal sites: 1) suitable geologic and
pedologic setting for occupation;, 2) occupation and human modifi­
cation of the environment according to the habits and necessities
of particular cultures;, 3} intensity and kind of modifying geo­
morphic processes which influence the preservation or erosion of
archeological evidence;, 4} favorable geomorphic-setting for dis­
covery.
When numbers of archeological sites per unit-area of
mapped geologic or pedologic partitions (formations or great groups)
are subjected to regression analyses;, the significance of physical
control and deviations is determined by the construction of con­
fidence limits.
The variants that fall outside the 95% confidence
boundaries are then further evaluated under additional geologic
and pedologic constraints.
The petrography and x-ray diffraction of both ceramics and
lithics provide clues to provenance (see Part II;, page 83) and
firing temperatures.
After clay sources are determined~ those
ceramics imported from outside the Range are designated.
Such an
analysis of El Paso BrownWare from recorded sites shows that clay
sources from outside as well as within the Basin were utilized 3
with intrusive types probably originating from fine-grained Rio
Grande fluvial facies.
A paleosol map for McGregor Range is constructed for the
period ca. A.D. 600-800.
Paleoclimatic data from this and other
investigations indicates significant droughts ca. AAD. 1100 3 1300
and 1890.
The most significant time of late Holocene soil in­
stabiZity appears to be a result of factors initiated after 1890
which climaxed in coppice dune initiation and gullying on the
Basin floor.
Climatic instability of major proportions is
indicated by buried and relict series of petrocalcic horizons 3

INTRODUCTION

probably related to Pluvial-Interpluvial events.
Climatic recon­
structions for the past 2000 years show~ generally~ an overall
rainfall distribution similar to that which exists today with only
short periods of intense precipitation deviations.
INTRODUCTION
Reconnaissance geology is geology in its fleetest form, often
consisting of sprinting rather than walking out the geology, es­
sentially scanning many rocks rather than studying only a few and
covering a lot of ground as quickly as possible.
My strategy,
under such constraints, has been not to ignore those features
which might otherwise have been too quickly glossed over if the
delineation of major trends had been the only investigative goal.
Certain particulars with archeological implications required more
time than others, such as x-ray diffraction and petrography of
ceramics.
And only with thorough, careful inspection could such
factors as paleoclimatology and ceramic provenance be studied.
Excellent studies of archeological sites through reconnaissance
geology with a similar approach have been made by Folk (1973,
1975).
Methods used in this study involved analysis of Apollo space­
photographs, low-altitude oblique photography, x-ray diffraction,
scanning electron microscopy, x-ray flourescence, sieving, and
field geological techniques.
PHYSIOGRAPHIC SETTING
McGregor Guided Missile Range occupies about 2790 square
kilometers in the southern part of the Tularosa Basin in south­
central New Mexico (Fig. 111-5).
It spreads across two physio­
graphic subdivisions of the Basin and Range Province-the Mexican
Highlands Section and the Sacramento Section defined by Hawley
(1975).
The local physiography of the Range is shown in Figure
111-6, an Apollo space photograph, and diagramatically in Figure
111-7.
The topography is illustrated in Figure 111-8.
One of the most impressive geomorphic features of McGregor
Range is the Sacramento Mountain cuesta complex in the northern
part of the Range.
This north-striking escarpment rises abruptly
from the Basin floor (slightly over 4000=feet above-mean sea
level [m.s.L]) to about 74,000 feet m.s.l. in elevation, with a
bajada draping the west side.
The structurally controlled drain­
age from these Paleozoic carbonate and shale units is principally
unidirectional, to the west.
Otero Mesa merges southward, a
gently eastward sloping homocline with a similar north-south
trending escarpment and pediment on the western side.
Drainage
on the Otero Mesa Permian carbonate units is bidirectional, east­
west.
Otero Mesa grades into the Hueco Mountain complex, which

FIGURE 111-6

PHYSIOGRAPHIC SETTING

101

is a series of Pennsylvanian and Permian carbonate cuestas
similar to the Sacramento Mountains but reachas a maximum
elevation of only about 5700 feet m.s.l.
The Hueco Mountain
complex additionally differs in lacking the bajada, in having
smaller alluvial fans and in having a radial drainage.
Figure
111-7 shows that the western part of the range is made up pre­
dominately of the Tularosa Basin, a bolson complex with an
interior closed centripetal drainage, interrupted by the radial
drainages of a few minor isolated hogback and cuesta ridges.
Just barely within the western boundary of McGregor Range is
part of the Jarilla Mountain complex, an inlier of igneous and
carbonate rocks characterized by a radial drainage.
The climate of McGregor Range is typical of the arid
Southwest.
Rainfall on the valley floor is sporadic and
occurs predominately during the late summer months as cloud­
bursts.
In contrast, rainfall in the Sacramento Mountains
is orographic and more evenly distributed than that on the
vally floor.
Present meteorologic data provided by the National
Weather Bureau in E10Paso is summarized in FigureIII-9,
which shows the mean annual rainfall to be 8.32 inches.
Annual
evaporation from nearby Las Cruces is 92.4 inches (Gardner
1951).
Dougherty (1975) determined the annual evaporation, at
a station 2~8 miles northwest of EI Paso, to be 102.57 inches.
Thus evaporation for this area is about an order of magnitude
greater than its precipitation.
The Holocene geomorphology
and present-day geoscape is a direct consequence of these en­
vironmental factors.
SURFACE GEOLOGY AND STRATIGRAPHY OF McGREGOR RANGE
The geologic map shown in Figure 111,10 ~illustrates that
the bedrock of McGregor Range is as varied in lithology as
it is in age.
This geologic map was compiled using data from
Dane and Bachman (1965), Pray (1961), Hardy (1958), N.A.S.A.
space photographs, gravity lineament analysis of Decker et
aZ. (1975), low altitude oblique photographs taken during
this project with a Nikon F-2 55 mm. camera, and by standard
geological field techniques.
The areal extent of the surface geology is indica~ed in
Table 111-8, compiled gravimetrically from the geologic map
- whlch sbows the outcrop to a 1arg~ degree, although thin
colluvial mantles are ignored.

Much of the stratigraphy of the Paleozoic sections in the
Sacramento Mountains has been excellently described by Pray (1961).
Additions to my own interpretations were made using this data and
from Bachman and Hayes (1958) for work in the Cu1p Canyon area,
Hardy (1958) and King et aZ. (1945) for geology of the Hueco
Mountains, Schmidt and Craddock (1964) and Beane et aZ. (1975) for
studies of the Jarilla Mountains and Black (1975) for subsurface
correlations.
Classifications of sandstones and carbonates are
according to Folk (1974) and of igneous rocks according to the
I.U.G.S. (1973).
Thicknesses of sections were determined by
standard geologic methods using the Jacob staff and Brunton com­
pass.
Stratigraphically, the oldest rocks are late Precambrian
quartzarenites, siltstones, and shales which crop out on the
western side of the Sacramento Mountains.
Although this section
was measured to be 145 feet thick, these rocks have the most
limited areal extent within the Range, occupying only about 0.01%
of the total bedrock.
Unconformably overlying these Precambiran
rocks is the Bliss Sandstone, a Late (1) Cambrian burrowed
SeoZifix sp. glauconitic quartazrenite. Medium-scaled crossbeds
are common throughout the 145 feet section.
Comformably overly­
ing the Bliss is the El Paso Formation, dolomites and dolomitic
quartz arenites of about 450 feet in thickness.
Above this is the
Montoya Formation which unconformably overlies the preceding form­
ation and is made up of about 200 feet of dark massive dolomite
which becomes lighter and increases in chert content upwards.

Gradational to the Montoya is the Valmont dolomite which is much
lighter and more thinly bedded.
It was measured to be about 100
feet of finely crystalline dolomite.
A more cherty darker gray
dolomite of the Fusselman Formation disconformably overlies the
Montoya, about 80 feet in thickness.
Altogether, these Cambrian,
Ordovician, and Silurian rocks cover only about 0.07% of the
total bedrock area of McGregor Range.
The unconformably overly­
ing Mississippian and Devonian strata occupy a slightly greater
area, about 0.13% of the Range.
These include the Devonian
Fusselman Dolomite, Onate Formation, and Sly Gap Formations which
together comprise only about 100 feet of section.
They become
less dolomitic and increase in terrigenous material upward.
Mississippian rocks conformably overlie these and consist of about
4S0 feet of algal biolithites, chert lenses, coral biomicrudites,
and shalestones.
Pennsylvanian rocks in the area, unlike the
preceding rocks which are restricted to the western part of the
Sacramento Mountains, crop out in substantially greater areas in
both the northern and southern parts of McGregor Range, covering
approximately 3.41% of the surface geology.
These rocks are of
the Magdalena Group, cherty algal biolithites, and laterally vary
tremendously in thicknesses, totaling over 2000 feet in thickness.
Covering the second greatest amount of bedrock area are
Permian rocks.
Totaled they occupy 41.14% of the surface bedrock
of the Range, the most significant carbonate exposures.
The Hueco
Limestone, a Fusulinid biomicrudite, predominates in the southern
part of the Range with a thickness of approximately 1200 feet.
Northward it becomes less massive and more terrigenous grading
into three members which are easily distinguishable on the western
part of Otero Mesa (Fig. 111-10).
The Lower Abo sandstone member
is a coarse intramicrudite which grades upward into a hematitic
calcareous siltstone which is named the Pendejo member.
About
150 feet of the Pendejo separates the lower from the upper Abo
sandstone member near N.M.S06.
The upper Abo member is grada­
tional with the middle unit and is composed of hematitic mud­
stones, siltstones, and a fine sandstone: immature quartzarenite.
Bachman and Hayes (1958) investigated some of the stratigraphic
problems between the Abo and the Hueco Formations, and Black (1975)
has discussed the subsurface equivalents.
Their findings are in­
conclusive for positive correlation.
Within McGregor Range the
lower Abo covers 0.41%, the Pendejo 0.53%, and upper Abo 0.15% of
the total area.
The conformably overlying Yeso Formation occupies
21.98% of the bedrock of the Range, the greatest extent of the
carbonate formations.
It can be divided into two members, the
lower Meseta Blanca member and the San Yesidro member.
Together~
they make up approximately 1,500 feet of section in the southern
Sacramento Mountains.
The Meseta Blanca member is a red limonitic
gypsumniferous siltstone which grades upward into a more calcareous
and resistant sandy brachiopod biomicrudite of the San Yesidro.
The Meseta Blanca ceyeys 1.36% and the San Yesidro 20.62% of the

110

RECONNAISSANCE GEOLOGY

Range bedrock area.
The massive unit which caps the Sacramento
Mountains in the Range is the conformably overlying San Andres
Limestone.
The thickness of this dolomitic calcarenite within
the Range is approximately 100 feet.
No Mesozoic strata occur
within the Range boundaries; Pray (1961) and. Black (1975) consi­
der this to be the result of erosion of a thin Cretaceous section
since deposition over this region.
This is supported by Creta­
ceous rocks resting on Permian strata just a little over 2 miles
east of the southern Range boundary, the Lower Cretaceous Campa­
grande Formation.
Intrusive igneous bodies occur in the Hueco Mountains,
Jarilla Mountains, and as minor sills in the Sacramento Mountains
(Fig. III~lO).
Cross-cutting relationships show these to be post
Permian in relative age.
They are probably related to Tertiary
intrusives of the Rio Grande rift (Chapin and Seager 1975).
The
Tertiary intrusives of the Sacramento Mountains have been petro­
logically studied by Asquith (1974) and have been dated by K/Ar
to be 44.2 ± 2.2 million years old.
These dikes and sills within
the Lower Paleozoic strata were classified by Asquith to be dio­
rites and camptonites, but, according to the new I.U.G.S. classi­
fications they are now termed foid diorites and quartz diorites.
The igneous intrusives of the Jarilla Mountains have not yet been
dated but are presumed to be similar in age to the other Tertiary
intrusives in the area.
These Jarilla rocks have been studied
recently by Beane et at. (1975), who note that most range between
granodiorites and monzonites, with the exception of a more recent
very small basalt lava flow at the extreme northern end of the
mountain range.
Erosion has not yet been significant enough to
destroy these rocks, but calichification of the scoria has result­
ed.
Bettis (1976b) found hydrogrossular and andradite garnets in
the Jarilla Mountains which indicate low temperature and pressure
metamorphism during the Tertiary.
In the southern part of the
Range, extrusive syenites and extrusive trachytes occur in the
Texas part of the Hueco Mountains south of the Range.
Totaled,
these igneous rocks occupy only 0.28% of the total bedrock area
on the Range.
Fluvial, lacustrine, eolian, and colluvial deposits are in­
cluded in the Quaternary Alluvium mapped in Figure 111-10.
These
bolson sediments predominate on the downthrown side of the large,
northward-striking fault system, and have been drilled to as deep
as 6,015 feet (McLean 1975) in the Tularosa Valley 4 miles north­
east of the White Sands Missile Range headquarters.
These deposits
cover 37.06% of the surface area and interfinger with piedmont­
slope alluvium.
A thin veneer of sand dune accumulation, desig­
nated here as the Quaternary Newman Sand, covers an additional
17.91% of the Range, predominately occurring in the western part.
Totaled, Quaternary deposits spatially encompass over half of
McGregor Range, 54.97% of the area.

GEOLOGIC HISTORY

III

GEOLOGIC l:fISTORY OF McGREGOR RANGE
Pray's classic study of the Sacramento Mountains (Pray 1961)
contributed greatly to an understanding of the Paleozoic rocks of
south-central New Mexico.
He describes alternating shallow
carbonate seas interrupted by occasional terrigenous accumula­
tions from a paleo-high surrounding a continually deepening de­
pression termed the Orogrande basin. Many of the smaller-scaled
fault and fold structures of the Sacramento Mountains were formed
during late Pennsylvanian and early Permian time.
Post-Permian
deposition was 'probably minimal in the area wi th perhaps only a
thin veneer of Cretaceous sediments.
The major uplift of the
Sacramento Mountains fault block is believed to have begun in
late Tertiary time with fault scarps in Recent alluvium indicating
the uplift is continuing (Pray 1961).
In the Hueco Mountains
algal biolithites are common in the Pennsylvanian Magdalena Form­
ation but not on the scale of those in the Sacramento Mountains.
During Tertiary time crustal tension initiated by the Rio Grande
rift downfaulted a thick sequence of Paleozoic carbonates and
clastics (Chapin and Seager 1975), with the McGregor Range area
becoming structurally a graben complex and physiographically a
bo1son complex.
A Bouguer anomaly map of this area from Ramberg
and Smithson (1975) illustrated several irregular gravity anoma­
lies which were interpreted as several fault blocks within the
Tularosa Basin.
The gravity highs and lows were produced by
shallow density contrasts associated with horst and graben struc­
tures, while maximum gravity gradients coincided with major normal
faults (Decker et al. 1975).
Data from this study aided in the
delineation of the faults shown in Figure 111-10.
Silica-poor intrusives accompanied this tectonic activity,
yielding in the Tularosa Basin rich metallic sulfide ores in the
Jarilla Mountains, Organ Mountains, and Hueeo Mountains (Schmidt
and Craddock 1964; Dunham 1935; Hardy 1958).
Along with silver,
turquoise, and galena ores in the Jarilla Mountains, several
interesting varieties of hydrogrossular and anhydrous garnets
provide additional clues to the tectonic history (Bettis 1976a;
1976b). Metamorphism in the Jarilla Mountains occurred at low
temperatures and pressures.
This graben infilled with thick accumulations of Tertiary­
Quaternary lacustrine and alluvial sediments, setting ~he stage
for the Quaternary evolution and subsequent landforms.
By middle
Cenozoic time, Strain (1969) believes the Hueco Bolson and the
Mesilla Bolson, respectively on the east and west flanks of the
Franklin Mountains, were the prominent basins of deposition.
Initially these basins filled separately, but, by early Pleisto­
cene time, their floors had merged, and a continuous sheet of
lacustrine deposits extended between the Franklin and Organ
Mountains.
The formation of Lake Cabeza de Vaca, which existed

During
Kansan time, outle t cutting drained Lake Cabeza de Vaca, closing
the lacustrin e de p ositional environment in which the Fo r t Hancock
Formation formed , and intro d uced a fluvial e n vironment for the
de p os i tion of the Camp Rice Forma t ion ( S tra i n 1 9 69) .
Strain (1969) de s cribes the F ort Hancock F or mation as bein g
comp osed o f horizo n tal strata of f ine sand, silt, siltstone, and
b e ntonitic claystone.
In contrast, he describes t h e overlying
Camp Rice as an accumulation of gravel, sand, silt, volcanic ash,
a nd caliche.
The northern boundary of these two disconformable
formations is obscure; however, lacustrine and fluvial deposits
n e ar Culp Canyon ( F ig . III ~ ll) can be tentativel y correlated wi t h
the F ort Hancock and Camp Ri ce formations.
These lacustrine
deposits migh t be p art of an ancestral Lake Otero whic h Hawley
(1975) has described as occu p yin g several hu n dred square miles
durin g at least one g lacial-pluvial substa g e ,
Th u s, these two
lakes--Lake Cabeza de Vaca and Lake Otero--might have been coeval
or e v en physically related .
However , the evidence p resently is
not conclusive.

PEDOLOGY
Soils presently covering McGregor Range are shown
in Figure 111-12.
These were mapped using N.A.S.A. Apollo
Space photographs, photointerpretive field techniques,
and the soil classification of the Soil Survey Staff's
7th Approximation (1967).
Similar photointerpretive
mapping from space photographs of Quaternary geomorphic
features and soil associations was pioneered by Morrison
(1969) for a portion of northern Chihuahua and adjoining
New Mexico and Texas.
Like his soil map, the one for
the Range is a pedologic~ not an engineering~ soil map.
The small scale utilized in mapping from space photo­
graphs precludes the differentiation of individual soil
series.
In selecting map units, primary emphasis is
placed on color of ground surfaces and on topographic­
geomorphic relationships (Morrison 1969). Agricultural
investigations of these soils have been studied by Maker
et al. (1972).
Two orders on McGregor Range are recognized: the
aridisols and the entisols.
A spatial analysis for the
Range is tabulated below.

horizon (Birkeland 1974). Approximate equivalents in the
older, more genetic classifications are: Desert, Redish
Desert, Sierozem, Solonchak, Brown, Brown Forest, and Humic
Gley (Soil Survey Staff 1960).
Lithic paleorthids are some
of the oldest soils on the Range, as they occupy the crests
and slopes of mountains and pediment surfaces.
This great
group occupies 14.70% of the real soil cover of the Range,
shown in Figure 111-12 to extend from the Hueco Mountains
north along the western edge of Otero Mesa to the Sacra­
mento Mountains.
Petrocalcic horizons are often exposed
in the soils at the surface and are laminated in texture.
I interpret this structure to be the result of calcium
carbonate precipitation from supersaturated soil waters
laterally conducted along rock bedding planes of the R
horizon.

caliche beneath cobbles as described by Gile et aZ. (1966)
often occur. These cements show varve-like accretion
laminae which are probably controlled by climatic oscil­
lations.
It is suggested that Carbon 14 dating and strati­
graphic correlation among such caliches might prove to be
of great importance in Pleistocene-Holocene climatic inter­
pretations.
The origin of petrocalcic horizons is in part
the result of ground-water deposition, and in part the
result of surface-water deposition; in low calcium-content
sediments, the source of carbonate is eolian dust that
falls on the ground surface, is dissolved and transferred
downward, and is precipitated in a subsurface zone (Ruhe
1967).
In high calcium-content sediments the caliche
source is derived from the dissolution of proximal lime­
stones.
The paleorthids are deeper soils than the lithic
paleorthids and have usually deeper A horizons.
This
soil is distinguished by the presence of a well-indurated
petrocalcic horizon within 1 meter of the surface (Soil
Survey Staff 1967).
These soils occupy the second
greatest areal extent of any soil on the Range, 27.77% of
McGregor Range.
A major portion of Otero Mesa is covered
by these soils (Fig. III-12).
Multiple petrocalcic hori­
zons shown in Figure 111-13 illustrate how paleorthids have
been common, reoccurent soils through recent climatic in­
stabilities.
These buried paleosols each developed under
periods of soil stability and climates when pedogenic
processes were similar to those that produce present petro­
calcic horizons.

If clay content is significant, the argillic B horizon
determines the soil to be a Haplargid (Birkeland 1974).
On
McGregor Range these soils today cover only 3.42% of the area
and are located proximal to the Jarilla Mountains (Fig. 111-12).
The absence of significant carbonate parent material enables
good argid development (Gile and Hawley 1972).
This is further
enhanced on the Range by a nearby feldspathic source for the
montmorillonite clays, the Jarilla Mountains.
The gypsiorthids cover only a minor part of the Range,
approximately 0.25%.
These gypsum sands are derived from Lake
Lucero sediments to the west.
These soils have a characteris­
tically high albedo which enables them to be mapped easily on
a space photograph.
Compare the soil map of Figure III-12 with
the space photograph in Figure III-6.
Entisols are soils in wh~ch pedologic processes have only
slightly modified the parent material; only a weakly developed
surface horizon is present infrequently.
The previously de­
scribed aridisols are often dissected by arroyos depositing
torrifluvent sands and gravels.
Playa lakes, more numerous.
overlying the relatively impermeable haplargids, form torri­
aquent soils.
These two entisols, the torrifluvents and the
torriaquents, cover 0.97% and 0.89% of the Range respectively.
A third entisol covers a considerable portion of the western
part of the Range, torripsaments.
These quartzarenite sand.
dunes cover 17.97% of the area.
Permeability is high on these
dunes and Prosopis g~andulosa var. Torreyana (mesquite) with

codominate (see Part III, page 7).
Torrisaments formed from the
leeward wind accumulation of sand are significant near Culp Canyon
and on the Hueco limestone forming the hill of Range Command.
These are much older than the coppice sand dunes.
The climatic
implications of these entisols are significant and can best be
approached by a stratigraphic study, coupled with an understanding
of basic geomorphic processes.
SOIL STRATIGRAPHY, PALEOPEDOLOGY, AND CLIMATIC RECONSTRUCTION
Although Tertiary tectonism is the regionally controlling
factor influencing the geomorphic evolution of McGregor Range,
the cyclic changes in climate represented by Quaternary glacia­
tions and interglaciations (pluvial-interpluvial times) exert a
major controlling effect upon landscape stability, fluvial pro­
cesses, and pedogenic accumulations.
The probable dynamics of
Quaternary hydrologic patterns have been studied by Schumm (1965)
for closed interior basins such as the Tularosa Basin.
For a
change from the interpluvial to pluvial times, the climate changes
from an overall hot, dry condition to cooler and wetter times.
Fluvial processes are aggradational during the late interpluvial
and early pluvial.
This changes to conditions favoring stability
during full pluvial.
Erosion occurs during late pluvial into the
early part of the next pluvial.
During the middle pluvial, the
trend is toward stability.
The cycle may then repeat itself.
These cyclic shifts in hydrologic regimes were accompanied by
vegetational changes.
These are shown by pollen diagrams by
Martin (1970) and by Freeman (1972) with arboreal pollen generally
higher during wetter, cooler periods.
Subsequent to the extensive Quaternary faulting and associated
grabens, the Tularosa Valley has been undergOing aggradation from
sediments derived from alluvial fans, blind fluvial systems, eolian
sands, lacustrine fines, and bolson dust fall.
The alternating
fluvial and lacustrine deposits are illustrated in Figure III-II.
This photograph taken near Culp Canyon illustrates vividly the
periodicity of environments.
Prismatic lacustrine muds (NM-47)
are sharply cut above and below by fluvial gravels.
Sieving of
,these muds by Davis (1976) demonstrates the exceedingly poor
'sorting of this unit (Fig. III-14).
In this figure the cumulative
percent mean-grain size is compared to known lacustrine 'Lake
Cabeza de Vaca sediments obtained south of E1 Paso.
This reveals
that these deposits are lacustrine in poor sorting characteristics.
The lateral continuity in outcrop of these fine silt units, to­
gether with root traces of playa (?) vegetation, and varve-like
laminations further substantiate the playa characteristics.
The periodicity of alternating lacustrine and fluvial
facies through time is shown to have occurred many times by
electric log profiles of Knowles and Kennedy (1956) for the

southern part of the Range.
These also probably indicate hydrologic
trends controlled by pluvial and interpluvial times.
Periods of
soil stability are indicated by the development of petrocalcic hori­
sons as shown in Figure 111-13.
The pedologic stratigraphy of McGregor Range is infrequently
revealed by present-day arroyo incisions such as that shown in
Figure III-15A.
This particular site is north of New Mexico State
Highway 506 and just west of Culp Canyon.
The archeological sig­
nificance of this site, labeled as M4ll, was discovered by Dr.
Victor R. Baker, who found an early "Brownware" site, a charcoal
horizon, and an Indian burial all at this location.
Sediments from
these units were texturally analyzed by sieving and settling tube
procedures outlined by Folk (1975) through the help of Davis (1976).
This outcrop is composed of three major sedimentary units.
Basally,
a massive reddish hematitic clay-rich quartzarenite is exposed
which weathers in a prismatic pattern.
This unit (NM-38) has poor
sorting characteristics (Fig. 111-16).
Distinct channel deposits
cut out this massive unit in some places, and laternates from coarse
channel lag (NM-43) and large-scaled festooned sands (NM-46)
which fine upwards in structure and texture to small-scaled cross­
bedded fine grained sands and coarse silts (NM-44).
A typical
fluvial exposure is illustrated in Figure III-15B.
I interpret
these deposits as bolson fine-grained pedogenic accumulations for
the most part, with laterally coeval fine-grained fluvial streams
perhaps of a less ephemeral nature due to possibly greater pre­
cipitation/evaporation ratios than are present today.
Above this red massive unit is a unit composed of gray laminae
(NM-29) with poor sorting (Fig. 111-16) such as that produced by
either bolson sheet wash of fines or by overbank fluvial deposits.
Charcoal, cultural pits, pottery and a burial within this horizon
point to the occupation of the underlying soil which can be classi­
fied as a paleo-argid.
Carbon 14 dates from this horizon range
from A.D. 660±200 (TX2405) to A.D. 770±50 (TX2404) (see Part II,
pages 28-30).
Some of the charcoal has been washed and has under­
gone minor transportation by the sheet wash and/or fluvial over­
banking.
Within one of the laterally associated exposed stream
deposits was a sherd of pottery which had accumulated along with
other similar-sized bedload material.
This unit was subsequently
covered by a torripsament sand.
These observations reveal that

occupation of this site occurred on a stabilized soil,
fine-grained stream which during one or more flood
events reworked parts of this settlement.
Kottlowski et
al.. (1965) indicate that in much of the Southwest aggra­
cational periods prior to A.D. 1100 occurred which indi­
cate humid times and that stream cutting dated around
A.D. 1100, 1300 and 1850, suggests that erosion occurred
during drought or times of sporadic precipitation.
This
fluvial reworking of EZ Paso Brohlnhlare in an older drain­
age is then possibly related to either the A.D. 1100 or
the A.D. 1300 stream cutting episode, if degradation oc­
curred at equivalent times in the Southwest.
Above this occupation horizon shown in Figure 111-15A
is a stabilized sand dune (NM-30) with characteristic high
sorting (Fig. 111-16).
Sand dunes do not occur on the
northeastern side of the arroyo, demonstrating that the
sand field has not yet made it across the incision.
Petrographically, the dune sands are made up of fine,
percussion-frosted quartz and chert grains.
These are
easily traced southwestward from the dunes and underly­
ing sandy soils of the Range to Holocene and older Rio
Grande fluvial sands which are also percussion-frosted
volcanic quartz and chert grains.
If the sands of these
dunes on McGregor Range were derived instead from border­
ing formations, limestone, feldspar, and chert grains
would dominate instead of the quartz and chert.
Differ­
ing characteristics of the sands are texturally revealed
by Figure 111-16.
The fluvial Rio Grande sands (NM-13)
have a mean grain size of 2.5¢ (fine sand), a standard
deviation of O.48¢ (well sorted), a near symmetrical
skewness of -0.056, and a slight leptokurtosis of 1.16
(Davis 1976).
In contrast, eolian prmcesses have trans­
ported the RiO Grande m~terial northeastward and they
have the following characteristi~$ in dune sands: a mean
grain size of 2.38¢ (fine sand), a standard deviation of
O.98¢ (moderately sorted), a near symmetrical skewness
of 0.01, and a platykurtic of 0.86 (Davis 1976).
Thus, the
greatest difference appears to be in kurtosis, with the
fluvial sands having a leptokurtic distribution and the
eolian dunes having a tendency toward platykurtosis.
This
suggests that the Rio Grande material has undergone some
addition to its tails in both the fine and coarse fraction of
grain size from dust fall and physical ablation during its
saltation acrDSS the Tularosa Valley in alternating phases of
mobile sand dunes and stable soils.
One can verify this direc­
tion of sand transport by looking at the predominate wind
directions observed at White Sands and at El Paso, Texas.

127

SOIL STRATIGRAPHY

Shown in Figure 111-17 are two rose-diagrams for wind speeds
over 15 knots or 17 m.p.h., which McKee (1965) states is the
minimum velocity effective in dune development.
For both El
Paso, just south of the Range, and Holroman Air Force Base,
just northwest of the Range, the predominate year-round wind
direction is from the southwest.
Thus, after initiation, the
sand dunes began to be transported in a north-easterly direc­
tion.
Thdse dunes which are formed by wind in conflict with
bunch or clump vegetation are termed "coppice dunes" after
Melton (1940).
As earlier mentioned, the sand dunes on the
Range are usually inhabited by Prosopis and Atriplex. Although
some nucleation occurs around vegetation clumps, a study of
cross-sections through the dunes as shown in Figure tII~18.
readily demonstrates that the roots now cut across older ava­
lanche bedding planes with subsequent lee deposits.
This
indicates that, after the sand initiated into sand dunes above
the older soils, stabilization by Prosopis and Atriplex has
occurred during more recent times.
Dune growth continues but
mobility has decreased.
That the Prosopis domination is a
relatively recent phenomenon for southwestern New Mexico is
suggested by studies of Buffington and Herbel (1965), who show
from old land surveys, that since 1858 the mesquite has increased
at the expense of the grass in the Las Cruces area.
They fur­
ther state that IIseed dispersal, accompanied by heavy grazing
and periodic droughts, appeared to be the major factor affecting
the rapid increase in shrubs." For the Las Cruces area, Gi1e
(1966) concluded that the coppice sand dunes originated between
1885 and 1922.
Tree ring data from the Guadalupe and Sacramento Mountains
from 1655 to 1935 (Schulman 1956) show ten-year averages for
relative growth indexes.
This data indicates a significant and
major drought beginning in the area in 1855 and ending about
1875 with the next signifiaant low occurring in 1935.
If the data
from the U.S. Weather Bureau for the annual rainfall since 1878
are plotted (Fig. 111-9), cycles df drought frequencies appear.
The data show a major drought for the El Paso area occuring in
1891 and 1894.
Supporting1y, Willett (1951) has declared that
most of the middle latitudes of the northern hemisphere experi­
enced a severe drought beginning in about 1880 which he says
lasted about 20 years.
According to the rainfall data, it is
not until 1934 and 1957 that the El Paso area had almost equi­
valent droughts.
This corroborative evidence suggests that sand
dune initiation probably occurred shortly after the 1891 and
1894 droughts.
How much of the post-l890 .soil ~nstabilit:y was due to drought
and how much was due to overgrazing is problematical.
Hunt (1975)
describes how the development of coppice sand dunes and arroyo
entrenchment occurred shortly after overgrazing in separate
bolsons throughout the southwest, after each valley was occupied

When these are contrasted with present distributions, some
of the greatest differences occur in the torripsaments, haplargids,
and torriaquents.
The paleosols are much more extensive as
haplargids and torriaquents.
The haplargid difference is for the
most part due to their being covered today by torripsaments (con­
trast Fig. 111-12 with Fig. 111-19).
The playas have somewhat
receded within their older boundaries probably more a result of
soil development and dune encroachment on perimeters rather than
climatic changes.
These playas have been subjected to severe and
persistent deflation since that time with only intermittent shal­
low flooding which created the sand-covered areas and broad flat
playas similar to that described by Reeves (1969) for Chihuahua.
The other great groups underwent essentially no change, reflecting
the longer periods of time necessary for petrocalcic development
in the aridisols than the shorter periods of time needed for enti­
sol development.
This relative stability of caliche soils for the
past 2000 years is supported by the findings of Gile and Hawley
(1972) which concluded that similar soils in the Las Cruces area
are older than late or mid-Holocene,
Additionally, they found
that the argids can be even several thousand years old.

and recent past distribution of the lacustrine and fluvial soils,
the torriaquents and the torrifluvents, respectively.
The
association between haplargids and playa deposits is not entirely
coincidental.
The relatively impermeable argids serve to retain
the saline waters which are concentrated even more by evaporation
in these ephemeral lakes forming torriaquents.
Torrifluvent
distributions are very significant on the Range.
The Sacramento
River in the northeastern past of the Range is the most perennial
of the drainages and is an extremely significant source of potable
water.
Springs in the upper part of the Sacramento River provided
about 250 gallons per minute of water to the Sacramento River­
Orogrande pipeline in 1956 (Mourant 195~).
The Grapevine drainage to the west is more ephemeral, with
extremely great sediment and water discharge periodically occur­
ring as evidenced by the large accumulation of sorted cobbles
within its reaches.
Interestingly, Pray (1961) noted that the
stream capture of the upper part of the Sacramento River by the
headwaters of Grapevine Canyon is imminent.
This piracy will
greatly change the present day distribution of alluviation for
these two streams.
Some of the springs which feed these two drainages ( and
others), as evidenced by travertines, occur at different strati­
grap c eve s
n
e Sacramento Mountains but head predominately
at the San Andres-Yeso contact (Fig, 111-10).
Here ground water
is joint-controlled in the overlying massive unit and then flows
out along the impermeable clays of the uppermost Yeso (Pray 1961).
Travertines found throughout the Range indicate that spring-fed
waters have been significant at some time in the past (Fig. 111­
20).
Carbon 14 dates of these might prove to be particularly
useful in determining dates of stream discharges.
Travertines
found at the bases of alluvial fans correspond to the findings in
other areas of the Tularosa Valley for the discharge of springs
near toes of fans (McLean 1975).
Another significant drainage occurs in the eastern part of
the Hueco Mountains.
Today this drainage is in a process of
downward incision into a thickly aggraded deposit and pediment.
Petrog1yphs on the underlying pediment, which have only recently
been uncovered, testify to the changing equilibrium of this
drainage since occupation.
During aboriginal occupation, a
time of incision was present.
Subsequently, aggradation filled
this drainage and covered the petroglyphs.
.
Aquicludes predominate in the Hueco Mountains.
Small
shallow water accumulations are formed by the occlusion of
fracture-controlled drainages by horsts.
Additional significance
of joint-controlled hydrology is the control of rock shelters.
These small caves predominate along fault escarpments of the
Sacramento Mountains, Hueco Mountains, and Otero Mesa, where
fractures have been enlarged by solution and spalling.
Groundwaters within the Range sediments occur in both fluvial

a nd l acustr ine rlepos i ts.
The qualit y and quantity of water for
the s e bolson sediments g e n erally decrease with de p th (Cliett
19 69 ).
Cliett (1969) has reported the amount of dissolved solids
within the fluvial gravels in the su b surface to range from 300
to 1500 p.p.m., but the underlying lake sediments with extremely
low per meability have total dissolved solids ranging as high as
50,000 p.p. m .
A study of the Tularosa Basin was conducted by
McLea n (1975), in which he substantiates much of Clie t t's find­
i ng s to the south.
McLean finds ~ in the basin zones, transition
between the freshwater in the alluvial fans and the moderately to
h ighly saline water in the center of the basin.
He states that
the bo l son fill aquifer is primarily recharged by ephemeral
~

Although much of the bolson subsurface waters are too high

142 0 F.
According to Dorfman and Keh1e (1974). temperatures in
excess of 30 0 F above ambient temperature are considered to be
potential indicators of geothermal reservoirs.
Thus McGregor
Range has some very promising possibilities as potential geo­
thermal resource prospects.
However, neither these prospects nor
the potential hydrocarbon reservoirs are discussed, as this was
neither the expressed purpose nor intention of this particular
geological research.
CERAMIC AND LITHIC ANALYSIS
The ceramics collected on McGregor Range represent either
pottery made from sources within the Tularosa Valley or intru­
sives, pottery made from sources from outside the Range.
To
discern the provenance of a pottery source one must initially
find possible sources of the clays (both under the strict min­
eralogic sense and as a size term of smaller than 2 microns)
available during the time of fabrication and then analyze the
pottery for clay mineralogy and for sediment tracers diagnostic
of particular sources.
However, one must note the transformation
of some of these minerals at high temperatures.
Clay sources for the fabrication of pottery are many on
McGregor Range.
They include:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.

Lacustrine-playa deposits
Fluvial overbank deposits
Pedogenic accumulations
Paleo-sedimentary deposits
Igneous weathering biproducts proximal to
igneous sources
Biomechanical
Imports (kaolinite from the north, bentonites
from the south, fluvial overbanks from the
Rio Grande, etc.)

Distributions of these sources can be discerned by observing occur­
rences of torriaquents, haplargids, and torrif1uvents.
Some of
the paleo-sedimentary deposits potentially available to prehistoric
man are revealed by alluvial incision into lacustrine clays near
the Culp Canyon area as shown in Figure III-II.
Lithic sources on the Range were also diverse.
Some 1924
chipped stone artifacts of 12 major varieties were analyzed
(see Part II, Table 11-2).
Diorites from the Jarilla Mountains
made excellent lithic sources for metates.
Other igneous rocks
from the Hueco Mountains apparently were less well utilized.
The
most utilized lithic material was chert, which on the Range varies
from formation to formation.

RECONNAISSANCE GEOLOGY

Light gray chert occurs as seams and sporadic nodules in the
E1 Paso Formation (Fig. 11-10).
Chert increases in amount up­
ward in the Montoya and occurs as thick seams and nodules which
range in color from nearly black to very light gray.
Chert in
the Valmont is only of minor importance, but layers and nodules
of partially silicified light brown dolomite are common.
Chert
is a major constituent of the Fusselman Formation. Much of the
chert ranges from gray to grayish brown with a porcelaneous tex­
ture.
Chert within the Devonian occurs in nodular yellow and
gray cherts.
The Mississippian cherts are dark gray and nodular
and occur sporadically.
Within the Pennsylvanian, chert nodules
are generally light gray and occur as nodules which appear to be
more fractured in the southern Magdalena Formation.
Permian
cherts are the most varied, often replacing fusulinids, but pre­
dominate in the Hueco Formations and are, for the most part, ab­
sent in the Yeso.
Peculiar reddish silica-cemented mudstones
occur only within a very restricted part of the Hueco Mountains
toward the southeast of the Range.
As shown in the lithologic
description of chipped-stone artifacts (see Part II, page 86)
these make a diagnostic, provenance indicator and occur in 13.5%
of the total lithic collection.
Imports of some local importance
are black obsidian, turquoise possibly from the Jarilla Mountains
or elsewhere, and other exotics.
Additionally the flat-lying
calcarenites of both the Hueco Formation and lower Paleozoic for­
mations were utilized extensively for metates.
Two potential clay sources just outside the Range are mont­
morillonites (bentonites) found in Fort Hancock sediments south
of the Range and overbank deposits of Rio Grande fines to the
west.
All of these sources as well as extraneous ones have to
be considered when analyzing ceramics of the three major types
found: EZ Paso Brown, El Paso Polychrome and Chupadero Blaok on
White.
Dulaney and Pigott (Part II, page 265ff.) analyze certain
anthropological-geological problems associated with these ceramics.
Of the thirty sherds analyzed, the predominant type was El Paso
Brown.
It precedes the other pottery types in time and is the
most common type found on the Range; for this reason it was deemed
of primary importance in attempting to interpret aboriginal pre­
ferences for clay sources. However, less extensive analyses of
the other two types show significant results.
Petrographic and x-ray diffraction analyses compliment each
other in ceramic analyses.
Though x-ray diffraction can determine
exact mineralogic components, the distributions, abundances and
textures of minerals as well as rock fragments can only be done
petrographically. When such parameters as sorting, vacuolization,
rounding, etc. are determined according to the methods of Folk
(1974), paleoclimatic data can often be inferred petrographically,
whereas only the basic mineral identification can be determined
by x-ray diffraction.
Both aid in provenance determination.

CERAMIC AND LITHIC ANALYSIS

137

One interesting use of x-ray diffraction is in the analysis
of firing-temperature range.
Certain minerals form from a melt
at particular temperatures along with particular physical changes
which take place.
For instance, Lawrence (1972) describes the
changes in kaolinite which occur when heat is applied.
The re­
moval of free water occurs at 100-200°C, followed by the removal
of chemically combined water with a resultant loss of crystal­
linity at 4S0-600°C at which kaolinite disappears and metakao1in
forms.
At higher temperatures other minerals form.
At 980°C
spinel forms with the disappearance of metakaolin.
At lOSO-lIOO°C
spinel changes to mullite, and at 1200-l400oe more mullite
forms.
Stable cristobalite forms at l250 o e.
With components
other than kaolinite different changes occur at different temp­
eratures.' Heating orthoclase to l1500e converts it to leucite,
which then forms cristobalite at l520 o e.
Albite upon heating to
1118°e forms a glass phase.
At 898°e calcium carbonate is
converted to lime, CaO.
The mineralogical changes in a 40%-kaolinite!30%-quarts!30%­
feldspar that occur upon heating are derived from the data of
Brindley and Ougland (1962) and summarized by Lawrence (1972).
In the IOO-200oe range drying is completed with removal of
absorbed and interlayer water.
Between 450-600 o e the chemically
combined water leaves as the kaolin changes to metakaolin.
At
573°e the quartz changes from the low to the high temperature
variety.
Between 300 and 700 0 e an oxidation period occurs during
which organics are oxidized.
Metakaolin changes to spinel at
980°C.
Between 10SOoe and 11000e the spinel formed begins
changing to mullite.
The feldspar starts to melt and its de­
crease is associated with an increase in the glassy phase.
At
1200°C mullite crystals continue to increase slightly and very
little further development occurs.
'
The addition of other materials to a clay controls many of
these temperature conversions of minerals, some beneficial, other
detrimental (Lawrence 1972).
Quartz has the effect of reducing
clay plasticity and the firing and drying shrinkage; this mineral
additionally increases the fired strength with an increase in
refractoriness.
However, associated aluminum compounds. such as
feldspars and micas reduce refractoriness and the vitrification
temperature of clay.
And with the increase in glass formation at
lower temperatures, the strength is increased.
Iron minerals such
as magnetite, hematite, limonite, goethite, pyrite, and ,siderite
differ in effects due to heating as they are very susceptible to
different degrees of oxidation-reduction reactions.
Magnetite
with silica ~tarts glass formation at l455°e, but if more
reduced iron, such as pyrite, is heated, glass formation starts at
l180oe.
The iron content of pottery, such as that studied here,
yields an approximate indicator of the oxygen availability of the

firing environment, with reds indicating oxidation and dark colors
and grays indicating reducing conditions of high organic contents
below 700°C of firing.
When carbonates are added, as previously
mentioned, thex decompose to lime at 898°C.
This reduces vitri­

ingredients to form anorthite.
Thus, with these mineralogic tools and with the knowledge
gained from phase diagrams such as those listed by Ehlers (1972),
one can, within certain constraints, determine maximum and minimum
firing temperatures of ceramics.
When this was done, most of the
brownware ceramics from the McGregor Range sample were found to
have been fired at less than 898°C.
However, a few have maximum

Dulaney and Ptgott--(see Part IIIJP~E:l169)--­
elaborate on firing temperature analysfS-1::nroughrefiring tech­
niques and comparison with techniques pioneered by Shep~rd (1971).
Most of the El Paso Brown sherds indicate that the provenance
is both from within and from outside the Tularosa Basin.
The
evidence for this is the following: the effective mineralogy of
the native sherds reflects proximal Tularosa sources, i~e., ortho­
clase, plagioclase, chorite-biotite, calcite, oxyhornblende, chert,
and predominately illite as the major clay mineral.
Petrograph­
ically, plutonic rock fragments similar in composition to the
Jarilla Mountains were found to be common.
Also endemic to the
McGregor Range and surrounding Tularosa Basin are the following
items found within the sherds: limestone-rock fragments, perthi­
tic feldspars, and angular to subrounded quartz.
A microphoto­
graph of an EZ Paso Brown sherd displaying many of these grains
is shown in Figure 1II-21A.
Figure_ 1II-2lB shows the same sherd
under polarized light.
The extremely fresh nature of many of the
feldspars indicates either or both an arid climate and high relief
for the feldspars to not be weathered.
Clay sources for these
arkosic clays were probably proximal to the Jarilla Mountains:
haplarglids or torriaquents.
The angular quartz and abundant
limestone-rock fragments suggest very little fluvial transport,
typical of this bolson setting.
Bimodal sand-sized quartz and
textural inversions of well-sorted sand in a clay matrix in many
of the sherds are common in environments where eolian and lacus­
trine processes mix, such as playa-deserts.
Unfortunately, be­
cause of the textural peculiarity of this bolson setting, t~e
biomechanical manufacture of clays which would introduce similar
angularity of minerals and poor sorting is difficult if not im­
possible to discern.
There are, however, significant departures from this normal
valley assemblage in EZ Paso Brown sherds.
For instance, the
fluvially sorted samples (i.e., NM-6, 14, 25) have volcanic rock
fragments and, clearly, are from outside the area, probably from
fluvial clays draining volcanics such as the nearby Rio Grande.
Samples such as NM-4, which lack any fluvially derived quartz

temperatures,

CERAMIC AND LITHIC ANALYSIS

139

grains, are probably from volcanic/pedogenic clays without signi­
ficant fluvial influence, such as the northern Jarilla Mountains.
Interestingly, the Po~ych~ome sherd also has a substantially
higher number of volcanic rock fragments (Fig. 1II-2IC), which
again points to a source area outside the Range.
Figure 1II-2ID
shows the same sherd under polarized light.
This suggests a
common provenance for some sherds of these two styles.
The
Chupade~o sherds have a clay content, dolomitic rhombs, chert,
montmorillonite, and only a trace of quartz which suggests a
source outside of the Tularosa Basin.
Thus, these two sherd styles
are clearly intrusives.
However, more samples of E~ Paso Poly­
chrome and Chupadero Black on White need to be analyzed in order
to statistically compare them with E~ Paso Brown and make more
intra-sherd comparisons.
When the temperature data is compiled for these different
sherds together with mineralogic percentages in a cluster program,
the trends result as shown in Figure 111-22.
Here, certain sherds
are grouped together by similar characteristics.
Interestingly,
NM-4 and -6 with volcanic-rock fragments are grouped together
using other characteristics than rock fragments.
And the E~ Paso
Polychrome NM-2 stands out greatly from the other sherds by a
distance coefficient of greater than 16.
The distance coefficient
is simply the distance between the sherds in Euclidean m-space
(Davis 1973).
Firing temperatures appear to make most differences
in this cluster correlation.
In the lithic analyses the major mineralogies of each site's
sample are listed along with provenances where they were deter­
mined (see Part II, Table 11-2).
Most of the ceramics can
be identified very accurately by their make-up and by referal to
the geologic map (Fig. 111-10).
Most portable metates were formed
out of Jarilla diorites and most chert tools were frabricated out
of Permian cherts with minor exception of obsidian from the Organ
Mountains and novaculites from the Sacramento Mountains.
The red
mudstones from the Hueco Mountains were extensively utilized for
scrapers and projectile points.
A few other artifacts of interest­
ing and somewhat uncommon occurrences are: turquoise, hematite and
collaphane.
GEOLOGIC AND PEDOLOGIC ANALYSIS OF SITE DISTRIBUTIONS
In the determination of prehistoric site distribution a major
variable is the geology of the Range.
We have already discerned
the geologic setting of the area, its bedrock, soils and modify­
ing geomorphic processes, especially during times of occupation.
Although a definitive anthropological explanation for settlement
patterns are beyond the purpose of this investigation, physical
constraints are easily studied.

has been discussed elsewhere (see Part I, Research Design). A test for
uniformity of sites for the various quadrats using chi-square
methods (Davis 1973) reveals that the quadrats do not have a ran­
dom distribution of sites; they are clumped (X 2 for all quadrats,
for the degrees of freedom of each is accurate to the .05 level).

Thus, each of these quadrats, except for Quadrat V which
lacked enough sites for data, are non-uniformly occupied.
An archeological site for this study is an arbitrarily de­
fined unit, a spatial cluster of cultural features (see Part I,
Research Design).
Included for this particular analysis are all
defined prehistoric sites of variable age, complexity and
size, as differentiation among these would yield numbers
too low for a statistical study.
A site has physical
boundaries limited only by the observer who discovered
them, but normalized to a degree by Dr. David Dibble at the
outset of exploration. What was considered a site by one
person was, for the most part, considered a site by others.
Historic sites are not included in this analysis.
When the number of sites per geologic partition are
graphed as a function of the area of each respective geo­
logic partition, as shown in Figure 111-23, a significant
regression is formed with a correlation coefficient of
0.89, which for 23 degrees of freedom has a probability of
much less than 0.01 that the regression is due to chance.
The coefficient of determination is 0.79, showing that the
area of each geologic partition accounts for approximately
79% of the variation in the number of sites.
When the 95%
confidence limits of the regression line are constructed,
certain particular site frequencies are outside these
limits.
Those above the line have site densities consider­
ably above the average and those below the line have site
densities considerably below the average.
Thus, the Penn­
sylvanian Magdalena Formation sites in the Sacramento
Mountains have densities considerably above average, with
the Hueco alluvium, and San Yesidro of Otero Mesa having
especially low densities.
Geologically, this can be ex­
plained as a function of the hydrology of the Magdalena
Formation in the Sacramentos; it is far superior to the
other formations and has more springs and tributaries,
thus enhancing the probability of human occupation.
Incidentally, only a minor number of these sites are
rock shelters, and thus direct bedrock control is mini­
mal.
The alluvium, on the other hand, with its pre­
dominant aggradation, yields fewer sites as only those
sites deflated are visible and are not covered by bolson
deposits.
The shallow soils of the San Yesidro would
offer excellent visibility for site discovery but for
the fact that there were probably naver many sites on
this part of Otero Mesa due to the extreme aridity and
ephemeral nature of surface water of the formation.
Only
scattered temporary and seasonally occupied sites should
be expected.

Although the spatial coverage of the soil types within the
quadrats studied do not exactly represent the spatial extent of
~-···--s-oi:fS- of the entire Range, a significant analysis of the site
densities with relation to the soils is presented in Figure 111-24.
Similarly, when the number of sites per pedologic partition of
the A.D. 600-800 soils are graphed against the areas of the soil
partitions another highly significant regression results. Holo­
cene soils would not be as correct an analysis as most sites
occured on and before the A.D. 600-800 surfaces.
The correla­
tion coefficient of 0.935 is highly significant with less than
0.01 chance of the regression due to accident.
The coefficient
of determination is 0.87, thus the areal distribution of soill
partitions accounts for approximately 87% of the site distribu­
tion.
Those sites outside the constructed 95% confidence limits
indicate frequencies signifioantly higher and lower than average.
High densities on two partitions on the lithic paleorthids in the
Sacramento Mountains are principally due to shallow soils, easy
site visibility, and substantial surface moisture.
The paleor­
thids of Otero Mesa, on the other hand, had significantly less
inhabitation than the average, explained, similar to the explana­
tion for the geologic partition of the same area, by high erodi­
bility and little initial inhabitation due to aridity ~nd ex­
tremely e~hemeral surface waters.
Thus statistically, the site distributions can be shown to
be non-uniformly distributed with spatial limitations being a
significant restraint.
However, there are significantly ideal
and less ideal geologic and pedologic areas of inhabitation.
A
complete analysis of settlement patterns, however, requires
ancillary anthropological research.

CONCLUDING STATEMENT
The reconnaissance geology of McGregor Range has defined a
few rather significant parameters which affect the occurrence
and observation of prehistoric sites.
Discovered sites are ap­
parently related closely to their geologic and pedologic settings;
the detection of these prehistoric residues is heavily a function
of the geomorphic processes that have been able to modify the evi­
dence of these sites since their occupation.
Sacramento Mountain
sites have abundant surface moisture and shallow soils for high
potential settlement and site visibility.
In contrast, Otero
Mesa sites have low surface moisture presently and as well as for
the past 200a years, the period of most intense human use of the
study area.
This and the erosional deflation on these lithic
paleorthids probably contribute to the lack of cultural evidence.
Greater site frequencies on the torripsament sand flats are likely
due to other parameters (depending on subsistence modes): good
paleo soils for agriculture, moderate surface water from playas
and alternating preservation and erosion by previous sand dune
migration.
Those sites found in heavily aggraded areas, such as
found proximal to alluvial fans with high surface and shallow
water potential, are somewhat less easily observed if alluviation
is particularly substantial; i.e' 3 the very recent exposure of
the petroglyphs on the Hueco Mountain pediment.
Ceramic and lithic analysis have indicated that particular
mineral assemblages are good indicators of provenance.
When
petrography is coupled with x-ray diffraction, additional informa­
tion concerning clay mineralogy and firing temperatures can be
derived.
These methods, when enjoined with a little geologic
"common sense,1I are helpful in relating depositional environments
and climates to sherd provenance.
Paleopedologic reconstruction within reasonable temporal
frames has shown to be extremely helpful: settlement frequencies
on particular pedons are more accurately determined as an adjunct
to anthropological or ethnobotanical studies.
Soil stratigraphy
has been particularly useful in the reconstruction of the Range
geochronology and paleoclimatology.
However, one should not pre­
sume that geology offers the answers, only anthropological re­
search can assess the cultural controls upon settlement pattern­
ing.
For instance, the correlation of the curious disappearance
of ceramic sites aa. A.D, 1300 and an episode of gulleying pre­
sumed to be due to extreme droughts may only be spurious.
Any
of a number of other reasons for the lack of these residues could
offer explanations.
Therefore, one must be particularly careful
in the geologic study, as well as in any other specialized study,
of spatial analyses of settlement patterns.
Only when all the
observations are summed can hypotheses be rigorously tested.
"Numberless in short are the ways, and sometimes imperceptible,
in which the affections (emotions) colour and infect the under­
standing " (Francis Bacon, Novum Organum, 1620).

Mexico; the Technology Application Center, Albuquerque, New
Mexico; and the U.S. Weather Bureau at El Paso, Texas.
I am also
particularly appreciative of the discussions and information
provided by geomorphic work and sieve analyses by Susan Davis of
The Department of Geology, Louisiana State University, Baton
Rouge, Louisiana, in the Culp Canyon area and by Patricia Bettis,
Department of Geological Sciences, The University of Texas at
Austin, for garnet petrology of the Jarillas.
Both Grant
Ferguson, who helped substantially with early perspiration as my
field assistant and Arthur Busbey, who furnished a program for
cluster analYSiS, are also of this Department and receive my
thanks.
Dr. Robert L. Folk of this Department has contributed
greatly in discussions of statistical analyses and in my petro­
graphic training.
