MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Sandy Creek Energy Associates, L.P. (SCEA) is proposing to construct a water intake
pipeline that will be associated with the proposed Sandy Creek Energy Station (SCES) located
near Riesel in McLennan County, Texas. The proposed intake pipeline will utilize a 24-meter(m) (80-foot- [ft]) wide temporary construction easement with only 9 m (30 ft) being permanently
impacted. While the proposed intake pipeline is located on private property and is privately
funded, the crossing of areas under the jurisdiction of the US Army Corps of Engineers
(USACE) will require a Section 404 and 10 permit issued by the USACE. As such, the areas
within the purview of the USACE along the proposed intake pipeline right-of-way (ROW) fall
under the regulations of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966,
as amended. Prior to the field effort, Mr. Skipper Scott and Mr. Brent Jasper of the USACE
were consulted, and additional cultural resource investigations were determined necessary at a
total of five USACE jurisdictional areas within the proposed intake pipeline ROW.
SCEA contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc (Horizon) to conduct an
intensive cultural resources survey of the five USACE jurisdictional areas determined to require
additional investigation. These surveys were conducted in compliance with the regulations of
Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any cultural resources
were located within the USACE jurisdictional areas, and, if so, to determine their eligibility for
inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
Horizon conducted the intensive survey on 18 to 20 April 2007. As all five of the
jurisdictional areas appeared to be located within alluvial settings (i.e., the floodplain of the
Brazos River), mechanically excavated backhoe trenching investigations were initially requested
by the USACE in order to adequately assess the potentially deep sands located within the
USACE jurisdictional areas. In accordance with the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS), 14 to 18 trenches were required in the event that the five USACE
jurisdictional areas were found to possess the potential to contain buried, intact deposits. In
some cases, trenching was deemed unnecessary due to substantial prior impacts or the
presence of shallow argillic sediments. Shovel testing therefore constituted an adequate survey
technique for identifying cultural resources in these areas. In all, a total of ten trenches and six
shovel tests were excavated within the five USACE jurisdictional areas.

Management Summary

In general, the intake pipeline is proposed to traverse a primarily rural region dominated
by agricultural fields, pasturelands, and gravel mining areas. Substantial modifications to the
landscape are evidenced by the presence of artificial irrigation channels, stock ponds and water
treatment facilities, and improved pastureland. Of the five USACE jurisdictional areas
investigated, one is located in the lowland floodplain directly adjacent to a bend in the Brazos
River, three are situated in upland settings adjacent to small drainages, and one borders the
banks of a relic channel of the Brazos River. Soils varied throughout the investigated areas
from extremely dense clays observed at the surface to very deep fine sands. The survey
resulted in the documentation of no new archeological sites within the USACE jurisdictional
areas along the proposed ROW. No cultural resources of any kind, including prehistoric or
historic archeological sites, isolated occurrences of artifacts, or historic structures or objects,
were identified as a result of intensive survey activities.
Based on the results of these investigations, it is Horizonâs opinion that the construction
of the proposed intake pipeline will have no effect on any significant cultural resources within the
USACE jurisdictional areas. Horizon recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted
for the five USACE jurisdictional areas within the proposed intake pipeline ROW.

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of Five USACE Jurisdictional Areas Impacted by the Proposed
Water Intake Pipeline Associated with the Sandy Creek Energy Station, McLennan County, Texas

1.0 INTRODUCTION

Sandy Creek Energy Associates, L.P. (SCEA) is proposing to construct a water intake
pipeline that will be associated with the proposed Sandy Creek Energy Station (SCES) located
near Riesel in McLennan County, Texas (Figures 1 and 2). The proposed intake pipeline will
utilize a 24-meter- (m) (80-foot- [ft]) wide temporary construction easement with only 9 m (30 ft)
being permanently impacted. While the proposed intake pipeline is located on private property
and is privately funded, the crossing of areas under the jurisdiction of the US Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE) will require a Section 404 and 10 permit issued by the USACE. As such,
the areas within the purview of the USACE along the proposed intake pipeline right-of-way
(ROW) fall under the regulations of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA) of 1966, as amended. Prior to the field effort, Mr. Skipper Scott and Mr. Brent Jasper of
the USACE were consulted and additional cultural resource investigations were determined
necessary at a total of five USACE jurisdictional areas within the proposed intake pipeline ROW.
The cultural resources investigation consisted of an archival review, an intensive
pedestrian survey, backhoe trenching, and the production of a report suitable for review by the
State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commissionâs (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council
of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. SCEA
contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) to conduct an intensive cultural
resources survey of the five USACE jurisdictional areas in compliance with the regulations of
Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any cultural resources
were located within the USACE jurisdictional areas, and, if so, to determine their eligibility for
inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Abigail Peyton (Horizon staff
archeologist) and Jared Wiersema (Horizon field technician) conducted the field investigations
on 18 to 20 April 2007.
As all of the five jurisdictional areas appeared to be located within alluvial settings (i.e.,
the floodplain of the Brazos River), mechanically excavated backhoe trenching investigations
were initially requested by the USACE in order to adequately assess the potentially deep sands
located within the USACE jurisdictional areas. In accordance with the Texas State Minimum
Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS), 14 to 18 trenches were required in the event that
the five USACE jurisdictional areas were found to possess the potential to contain buried, intact
deposits. The Horizon field crew set out to excavate two to four backhoe trenches at each
USACE jurisdictional area, preferably two on each bank. In some cases, however, trenching
was deemed

unnecessary due to substantial prior impacts or the presence of shallow argillic clayey
sediments. Shovel testing therefore constituted an adequate survey technique for identifying
cultural resources in these areas. In all, a total of ten trenches and six shovel tests were
excavated within the five USACE jurisdictional areas.
In general, the intake pipeline proposes to traverse a primarily rural region dominated by
agricultural fields, pasturelands, and gravel mining areas. Substantial modifications to the
landscape are evidenced by the presence of artificial irrigation channels, stock ponds and water
treatment facilities, and improved pasturelands. Of the five USACE jurisdictional areas
investigated, one is located in the lowland floodplain directly adjacent to a bend in the Brazos
River, three are situated in upland settings adjacent to small drainages, and one borders the
banks of a relic channel of the Brazos River. Soils varied throughout the investigated areas
from extremely dense clays observed at the surface to very deep fine sands. The survey
resulted in the documentation of no new archeological sites within the USACE jurisdictional
areas along the proposed ROW. No cultural resources of any kind, including prehistoric or
historic archeological sites, isolated occurrences of artifacts, or historic structures or objects,
were identified as a result of intensive survey activities.
Based on the results of these investigations, it is Horizonâs opinion that the construction
of the proposed intake pipeline will have no effect on any significant cultural resources within the
USACE jurisdictional areas. Horizon recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted
for the USACE jurisdictional areas within the proposed intake pipeline ROW.

Water Intake Pipeline Associated with the Sandy Creek Energy Station, McLennan County, Texas

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The proposed water intake pipeline right-of-way (ROW) associated with the SCES is
located in McLennan County southeast of Waco, Texas (see Figure 1). The proposed pipeline
begins on the southern banks of the Brazos River at the Waco Metropolitan Area Regional
Sewerage System (WMARSS) water treatment facility and follows an easterly direction crossing
the Brazos River. At that point, the proposed pipeline turns abruptly southeast and continues
for approximately 10 km (6 mi), traversing Tehuecana Creek, Shaw Creek, Dead River, several
unnamed tributaries, and a series of agricultural fields and gravel mining pits. This pipeline
investigation terminated at the discharge point located on the eastern banks of the Brazos River
opposite from the Lake Creek Reservoir.
The proposed intake pipeline will traverse areas
typical of the Brazos River floodplain and associated terraces. The majority of the soils in this
area are alluvial in derivation and belong to the Weswood-Yahola-Ship soil association (USDA
2001).
For consistencyâs sake, each USACE jurisdictional crossing maintained its original
nomenclature assigned during the initial layout of the proposed pipeline ROW. Starting with the
northernmost USACE jurisdiction area and moving southeast towards the discharge point, the
five USACE jurisdictional areas consist of the following:
S2: USACE jurisdictional area S2 consists of approximately 300 m (1000 ft) of the
proposed intake pipeline located in the lowland gravel wash directly adjacent to the western
bank of the Brazos River. This area was found to be dominated by a combination of thick
riparian vegetation and open grasslands underlain by dense argillic clays. Specifically, soils
within USACE jurisdictional area S2 consist of Yahola loam, rarely flooded (Ya). Yahola loam,
rarely flooded (Ya) occurs within Holocene-age alluvium along the Brazos River. The surface
layer consists of 0-25 centimeters (cm) (0-10 inches [in]) of pale brown very fine sandy loam,
which transitions into reddish-yellow very fine sandy loam to a depth of 66 cm (26 in). A
reddish-yellow very fine sandy loam extends to a depth of 107 cm (42 in) followed by a
yellowish-red loamy fine sand to a depth of 165 cm (65 in). Topography ranges from 110 to 113
m (360 to 370 ft) above mean sea level (amsl). Overview photographs of USACE jurisdictional
area S2 are provided in Figures 3 and 4.
SHAWCR1/SHAWCR2: The second USACE jurisdictional area is located on an upland
terrace east of the Brazos River. In this area, the proposed intake pipeline will traverse Shaw

Creek, which meanders through a series of agricultural fields and has been considerably
modified in order to facilitate irrigation and water run-off. According to the landowner, Shaw
Creek used to be flanked by a wide riparian corridor. However, recent clearing episodes have
stripped the corridor in order to make room for crops. Presently, only a thin strip of short
grasses underlain by loamy soils lines the banks of the creek. Specifically, soils within the
USACE jurisdictional area consist of Ships clay, rarely flooded (Sh), and Weswood silty clay
loam, rarely flooded (We). Topography ranges from 113 to 116 m (370 to 380 ft) amsl.
Representative photographs of the USACE jurisdictional area associated with Shaw Creek are
provided in Figures 5 and 6.
Ships clay, rarely flooded, consists of very deep, nearly level clayey soils on floodplains
along the Brazos River. The surface layer is from 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in) and consists of brown
clay followed by reddish-brown clay to a depth of 188 cm (74 in). Underlying material (188 to
203 cm [74 to 80 in]) is a reddish-brown silty clay loam.
Weswood soils occur within Holocene-age floodplains along the Brazos River. The
surface layer is from 0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 in) and consists of reddish-brown silt loam. The subsoil
layer is 15 to 46 cm (6 to 18 in) and consists of reddish-brown silt loam, and 46 to 112 cm (18 to
44 in) is yellowish-red silt loam. Underlying material (112 to 203 cm [44 to 80 in]) is reddishyellow silt loam.

Figure 6. Overview of Shaw Creek, facing east
R2: USACE jurisdictional area R2, consisting of approximately 290 m (950 ft) of the
proposed pipeline ROW, is located north of a large up-swing of the Brazos River within a
historically gravel-mined region. USACE jurisdictional area R2 is bordered on the west by a
shallow pond that supports a sprawling herbaceous wetland to the east. Specifically, the area is
underlain by Ovan silty clay, frequently flooded (Ov). Ovan soils occur within Holocene-age
floodplains along local streams. The surface layer is from 0 to 51 cm (0 to 20 in) and consists of
dark grayish-brown silty clay. The subsurface layer ranges from 51 to 90 cm (20 to 35 in) in
depth and consists of grayish-brown silty clay. The subsoil is 90 to 203 cm (35 to 80 in) in depth
and consists of pale brown silty clay. Topography ranges from 113 to 116 m (370 to 380 ft)
amsl. An overview photograph of USACE jurisdictional area R2 is provided in Figure 7.
TF4: USACE jurisdictional area TF4 consists of a small stream that meanders through
an open pasture adjacent to a large stock pond in an upland setting east of the Brazos River.
Presently, the stream is bordered to the north by a large artificial berm associated with the
nearby stock pond. Additionally, a localized stand of herbaceous wetlands occupies a bend in
the stream, which is likely maintained by water leaching out of the pond. The southern bank of
the creek is rather flat and backs up to a 2-track farm road bordered on the far shoulder by a
series of cattle corrals. The northern bank has been obviously impacted by the construction of
the nearby stock pond as it rises dramatically in elevation to the north. The area was found to
be underlain by dense clays belonging to the Ships soils group (see Ships clay, rarely flooded,
[Sh] soil description above). Topography ranges from 113 to 119 m (370 to 390 ft) amsl.
Overview photographs of USACE jurisdictional area TF4 are provided in Figures 8 and 9.

TF2: USACE jurisdictional area TF2 is located on the banks of a relic channel of the
Brazos River known as the Dead River. The Dead River in this area is bordered to the north by
expansive improved pastures interspersed with shallow pools of water likely swelled by recent
storm activity. The area south of the crossing is dominated by large grassy fields that extend
westward to the banks of the nearby Brazos River. The Yahola-Gaddy soil complex
characterizes the soils north of the Dead River and Ships clay, rarely flooded (see Ships clay,
rarely flooded [Sh] soil description above) characterizes the soils located to the south of the
Dead River. Topography ranges from 113 to 116 m (370 to 380 ft) amsl. Representative
photographs of USACE jurisdictional area TF2 are provided in Figures 10 and 11.
The Yahola-Gaddy complex soils occur within Holocene-age floodplains along the
Brazos River. The Yahola soil surface layer ranges from 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in) and consists of
pale brown, very fine sandy loam. The underlying material consists of a layer 25 to 107 cm (10
to 42 in) in depth and is reddish-yellow very fine sandy loam, as well as a layer ranging from
107 to 203 cm (42 to 80 in), which is yellowish-red, loamy fine sand with common strata of fine
sandy loam.

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The general temporal framework for most prehistoric archeological sites in Texas is
based on the seriation of projectile point types originally established by Suhm et al. (1954) and
later revised by Suhm and Jelks (1962), Prewitt (1981, 1985), and Turner and Hester (1985).
This temporal framework, consisting of a tri-partite system based on technological changes in
diagnostic artifacts that occurred as a result of indigenous adaptation to changing environments
and subsistence strategies, is broken down into 3 main periods: the PaleoIndian (pre-8500 BP),
the Archaic (8500 to 1250 BP), and the Late Prehistoric (1250 to 250 BP). The Archaic period
is further subdivided into the Early Archaic (8500 to 6000 BP), the Middle Archaic (6000 BP to
3500 BP), and the Late Archaic (3500 to 1250 BP).

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. PRE-8500 BP)

The PaleoIndian period is characterized by highly mobile groups hunting over large
areas. Although now-extinct megafauna such as mammoth and bison are often found
associated with sites of this time period, smaller game, such as deer and turtles, were also likely
utilized as food items. Undoubtedly, plant foods made up a portion of the diet as well. Based
upon the low number of diagnostic artifacts recovered from sites of this period, as well as the
low frequency of sites, population densities are considered low and probably consisted of small
family groups. An increase in projectile point frequency toward the end of the period may
suggest an increased population density or, perhaps, an increase in macro-band aggregation
for the purpose of communal hunts. Sites from this time period are found mostly in upland
tributary and spring settings, as well as deeply buried in floodplain alluvium. Clovis and Folsom
points are indicative of Early PaleoIndian occupations, while Plainview, Golondrina, Scottsbluff,
Meserve, Eden, Dalton, San Patrice, and Angostura points are characteristic of the later span of
the period.

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8500 TO 1250 BP)

3.2.1

Early Archaic (8500 to 6000 BP)

Like the PaleoIndian period, Early Archaic population densities remained low, still
consisting of small, mobile bands. However, a more generalized hunting-and-gathering strategy
is evidenced by the use of river mussels. Early Archaic sites are typically located on terraces
along tributary watercourses, but are also often found deeply buried in floodplain alluvium. Site
locale and an increased use of river mussels possibly indicate a shift in subsistence strategies

HJN 050072 AR

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

in order to exploit the bottomlands of major waterways during this period of wetter climates.
Split-stemmed points such as Gower, Martindale, and Uvalde, as well as Big Sandy, Hardin,
and Hoxie, are diagnostic of Early Archaic occupations.
3.2.2

Middle Archaic (6000 to 3500 BP)

During the Middle Archaic, the trend toward bottomland exploitation increases, with
fewer sites found along minor tributaries. Population density remained relatively low, but
obviously increased over prior periods, with broad-spectrum hunting and gathering represented
at larger sites where food sources were more abundant.
3.2.3

Late Archaic (3500 to 1250 BP)

In contrast to earlier time periods, the Late Archaic represents a period of increased
population and site density. Subsistence is focused on hunting and gathering within the
bottomlands of major creeks and rivers. Deer remains are quite common at Late Archaic sites,
and the exploitation of plant foods (nuts) seems to have increased during this period, based
upon an increase in plant-processing tools. Late Archaic sites are typically found on sandy
terraces along tributaries, as well as on clayey floodplains.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1250 TO 250 BP)

The Late Prehistoric, in general, is characterized by the advent of the bow and arrow, as
well as ceramics, in Texas. Hunting and gathering continued with an emphasis on deer and
other small game. Horticulture also became evident in some areas. As in the Late Archaic,
sites continue to be located on sandy terraces along major creeks and rivers. In fact, the
majority of Late Prehistoric sites contain some traces of Late Archaic occupations. A marked
population increase is highly evident, and increased territorial conflicts possibly explain the
recovery of burials with indications of violent deaths. Furthermore, differentiated burial practices
also suggest the development of non-egalitarian societies.

3.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 250 BP TO PRESENT)

The Historic period, which began with the arrival of Europeans into the region, can be
divided into 3 subperiods: early, middle, and late. Only a brief overview of the period is given
here. For a more detailed essay, see Newcomb (1993:1-63).
The first documented arrival of Europeans into Central Texas dates to the early
18th century (Newcomb 1993). Their influence, however, preceded their arrival. In the late
17th century, natives from northern Mexico and southern Texas began migrating into Central
Texas. This was done in part to escape forced occupation and labor in the Spanish mines and
on Spanish ranches. During the same time, horses stolen from the Spanish had become an
integral part of the Apache way of life. These mounted, nomadic bison hunters of the High
Plains enjoyed a tremendous advantage over their pedestrian enemies. They terrorized native
groups to the east and southeast of their High Plains homeland, forcing many to flee, some into
Central Texas (Newcomb 1993:2). Thus, the first Europeans in the region encountered native
groups fragmented by the growth of the Spanish missions, the raids of the Apache, and the

18

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of Five USACE Jurisdictional Areas Impacted by the Proposed

diseases that swept before the physical presence of Europeans. When these aboriginal groups
found they had nowhere else to go for protection from the forced labor or to get protection from
some of the more hostile and aggressive groups, they often turned toward the protection the
missions had to offer as a last resort. The accounts of missionaries documented the Native
American groups that they encountered and their attempts to convert; however, these accounts
do not suggest direct analogs to prehistoric lifeway patterns but rather represent a time of
drastic cultural change (Collins 1995). A few indigenous cultural patterns may have prevailed
through time. Along with large, diffuse encampments composed of peoples with mixed ethnic
affiliations, small band-sized residential camps, both dating to this particular period, are found in
Central Texas (Collins 1995:386). These latter sites may represent indigenous groups.
The middle Historic subperiod began about 1730 and ended about 1800 as the mission
system was failing (Collins 1995:386; Hester 1989). Historic documents of this period make
reference to remnants of native groups living in the missions, primarily in Bexar County (Collins
1995). Toward the end of this subperiod, the Comanche began to move into Northwestern
Texas from the High Plains. Records of their presence in Central Texas at this time tend to be
highly biased since they are provided mostly from the hostile perspective of Anglo settlers
(Collins 1995).
The late Historic subperiod is composed of small numbers of mission Indians, âfar flung
nomadic native groups (primarily the Comanche),â and an archeological record of the European
presence (Collins 1995:387). The earliest known historic Native American occupants in
McLennan County were the Tonkawa. The Tonkawa were considered friendly toward the early
settlers of McLennan County. The Tonkawa, the Cherokee, and the Comanche, however, were
decimated by European disease and removed from Texas by 1850. Settlement of the county
increased with communities developing along Brazos River.
According to the Handbook of Texas (2005):
McLennan County was established by the Texas legislature on January 22, 1850, and
named for Neil McLennan, one of the early settlers. The county government was
organized in August 1850 with Waco as its county seat. The county originally included its
present area, as well as the land to the northwest as far as the northern boundary of the
Robertson colony; it was reduced to its present size in 1854, when Bosque County was
established. Although McLennan County was organized too late to be included in the
1850 census, its population at that time has been estimated at several hundred. Rapid
growth was possible because, within two years of the establishment of Waco Village, the
frontier was pushed well to the northwest of the area. The Indians who had lived there
were moved to a Texas reservation in 1854 and then to Oklahoma in 1859. Aside from
Waco, the earliest communities in the county were at Bosqueville and Bold Springs (later
called West). Most of the settlers who came to the county before the Civil War were
Americans of English, Scottish, and Irish descent who moved from other parts of Texas
or from the southern United States. Many of them were well-educated, well-to-do people
with money to invest in the establishment of new towns, schools, and churches. The
county was divided into school districts in 1854. Early public schools were located near
the center of their district and generally carried the same name as the nearby settlement.
Districts usually charged tuition to raise money to pay their teachers. Population growth
made redistricting necessary in 1867 and again in 1884. Large-scale consolidation of
common school districts into independent school districts took place in the 1930s and

1940s. Several private schools, such as the Bosqueville Male and Female College and
the Trinity River High School (later Waco University) added to the educational
opportunities in the county. Paul Quinn College moved to Waco from Austin in 1881.
Waco was also chosen as the site of Baylor University when Waco University and Baylor
University at Independence were consolidated in 1886. McLennan Community College
was established at Waco in 1965. As in many Texas counties, extensive schooling was
for many children a luxury that took second-place to helping on the family farm. As late
as 1940, only 14 percent of the population over the age of twenty-five had completed
high school. As the job market expanded during the next forty years, so did the
percentage of residents who finished school. By 1960 more than 21 percent were high
school graduates, and by 1980 the number represented nearly 60 percent of the
population over twenty-five.
The Baptist and Methodist churches were among the earliest to be organized in the
county. A Methodist church was built in Waco in 1850, and a Baptist church followed in
1851. Episcopal services were held in Waco as early as 1854, but the church was not
formally organized until 1868. A Presbyterian church was organized in 1855. Few
Catholics lived in McLennan County until after the Civil War, when German and Czech
immigrants moved to the area; a Catholic church was built in Waco in 1870. Jewish
ceremonies in Waco were celebrated in rented rooms or private homes prior to the
establishment of a synagogue in 1871. In the early 1980s the county's 229 churches had
an estimated combined membership of 133,771; Southern Baptist, Catholic, and United
Methodist were the largest denominations. The 1860 census showed the county's free
population to be 3,811; 270 of this number were slaveholders, who owned a total of 2,395
slaves. The land near the Brazos River lent itself well to the establishment of large cotton
plantations, while the surrounding prairie land was used primarily for livestock. The 1860
production of the county's 379 farms included 2,300 bales of cotton, 187,800 bushels of
corn, 39,200 bushels of wheat, 46,600 cattle, and 22,000 sheep.
Richard Coke represented McLennan County at the Secession Convention in January
1861, and voted for secession; McLennan County voters accepted the ordinance later
that year by a margin of 586 to 191. Nevertheless, in spite of the overwhelming support
of the county for secession, the mayor of Waco from 1862 to 1866 was a Unionist.
Approximately 1,500 men from McLennan County served in the Confederate Army,
including six generals: Jerome Bonaparte Robertson, Felix Huston Robertson, Lawrence
Sullivan Ross, William H. Parsons, Allison Nelson, and Hiram Bronson Granbury. A
company raised by Peter F. Ross served in the Sixth Texas Regiment, and the Lone Star
Guards became Company E of the Fourth Texas Infantry of Hood's Texas Brigade. The
city of Waco was occupied by federal troops for a short time in 1868, and as in many
instances in the South, clashes between federal soldiers and local residents led to
considerable ill-feeling. During the Reconstruction period, the district judge and the
county commissioners arrested each other, the judge citing the commissioners for
contempt, and the commissioners charging the judge with lunacy; all charges were
dropped. Election returns for 1869 showed McLennan County voters choosing Edmund
J. Davis for governor over Andrew J. Hamilton by a vote of 797 to 606, but in the
Congressional election held two years later, the Democratic candidate, Dewitt C.
Giddings, carried the county by a vote of 1,520 to 1,162. Waco lawyer Richard Coke was
elected governor in 1873 (Handbook 2007).

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Archival research conducted online via the THCâs Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
indicated that no archeological sites are located within 1.6 km (1 mi) of the proposed intake
pipeline ROW (2007). Additionally, no previously recorded sites have been recorded within or
immediately adjacent to the proposed ROW. Based on the Atlas maps, no formal cultural
resources surveys have been conducted within the boundaries of the proposed intake pipeline
ROW.

Water Intake Pipeline Associated with the Sandy Creek Energy Station, McLennan County, Texas

5.0 METHODOLOGY

Due to the varying soil types, physiographic settings, and disturbances along the
proposed intake pipeline route, a variety of survey strategies were utilized during the field effort.
In accordance with the TSMASS, 14 to 18 trenches were required in the event that the five
USACE jurisdictional areas were found to possess the potential to contain buried, intact
deposits. The Horizon field crew set out to excavate two to four backhoe trenches at each
USACE jurisdictional area, preferably two on each bank. In some cases, however, trenching
was deemed unnecessary due to substantial prior impacts or the presence of shallow argillic
clay sediments. Shovel testing therefore constituted an adequate survey technique for
identifying cultural resources in these areas. In all, a total of ten trenches and six shovel tests
were excavated within the five USACE jurisdictional areas.
For consistencyâs sake, each USACE jurisdictional crossing maintained its original
nomenclature assigned during the initial layout of the proposed pipeline ROW. All investigations
at each of the USACE jurisdictional areas utilized the corresponding number when collecting
field data. For example, backhoe trenches at each jurisdictional area were assigned the
corresponding name as well as a specific backhoe trench number (e.g., backhoe trenches in
jurisdictional area TF4 were labeled TF4-1, TF4-2, etc.). Similarly, notes and photographs were
labeled in regard to the respective jurisdictional areas from which they were gathered. The
survey strategies used for each USACE jurisdictional area are described separately below.
USACE jurisdictional area S2, located on the western banks of the Brazos River, was
first visually inspected to determine if, 1) a backhoe would be capable of accessing the area,
and, 2) if potential existed for deeply buried deposits. Upon visual inspection of the area, it was
determined that the region lacked the potential for deeply buried deposits due to the extremely
dense clayey nature of the sediments observed on the surface. Shovel testing therefore
constituted an adequate survey technique for identifying cultural resources in this area. A total
of four shovel tests (AP 1 to 4) were excavated along the proposed pipeline ROW in this area.
USACE jurisdictional area SHAWCR1/SHAWCR2 extends through an active agricultural
field and is bisected by Shaw Creek, which has been considerably modified to facilitate irrigation
and water run-off. Investigations at this location consisted of the excavation of one backhoe
trench (SHAWCR1-1) on the northern bank of Shaw Creek. Due to restricted access and
extremely muddy conditions, backhoe trenching was not feasible on the southern bank of Shaw

HJN 050072 AR

Chapter 5.0: Methodology

Creek. As such, shovel testing investigations were implemented in order to test the deposits on
the southern banks of Shaw Creek. A total of two shovel tests (AP 5 and 6) were excavated
directly south of trench SHAWCR1-1 within the undisturbed vegetative corridor that flanked the
stream course.
USACE jurisdictional area R2 is located in an upland setting surrounded by large gravel
mining pits, ponds, and artificial and diverted channels. Upon visual inspection of the area, it
was determined that the northern portion of the segment had been previously disturbed by
mining activity. Shallow pools of water have subsequently formed, creating a marshy
herbaceous wetland underlain by dense clayey deposits. As such, no backhoe trenches were
excavated in this area. The southern portion of the segment appeared to have been less
impacted by the gravel mining operations, and two backhoe trenches (R2-1 and R2-2) were
excavated in this area.
USACE jurisdictional area TF4 is bisected by a small stream bordered to the north by a
large artificial berm associated with a nearby stock pond and to the south by undulating
pastures. A total of four backhoe trenches were excavated in this area with two (TF4-1 and
TF4-2) located on the southern banks of the unnamed stream and two (TF4-3 and TF4-4)
located on the upland terrace adjacent to the northern banks of the stream.
USACE jurisdictional area TF2 is traversed by the Dead River, a relic channel of the
Brazos River. The area north of the Dead River is dominated by large improved pastures with
lowland marshy areas located directly adjacent to the stream course. In contrast, the area
south of the Dead River is flanked by a steep sandy terrace that levels out to form a large
grassy upland. These grassy fields have likely been modified recently for agricultural purposes
as the grasses were observed to be extremely uniform in type and height. A total of three
trenches were excavated within this area, one south of the Dead River (TF2-1) and two on the
northern banks of the Dead River (TF2-2, and TF2-3). Further trenching efforts were not
pursued on the southern banks of the Dead River due primarily to the presence of a barbed-wire
fence, which prevented the backhoe from accessing areas directly adjacent to the river.
The excavation of each trench was closely monitored, and the dumping of the resulting
spoil matrix was observed for the presence of cultural material. These trenches only served to
establish positive/negative findings and to give a reference as to the vertical position of any
cultural deposits found. Only temporally diagnostic artifacts (projectile points, ceramics, etc.)
were to be collected, if present. All other artifacts (such as debitage, burned rock, historic glass,
metal scrap, etc.) were to be tabulated and assessed in the field and left where they were found.
Field notes were maintained on location, length, and depth of each trench, soils observed,
archeological sites recorded, etc.
Shovel tests measured 30 cm in diameter and were excavated to a target depth of 1.0 m
(3.3 ft) below surface, to the top of pre-Holocene deposits, or to the maximum depth practicable.
In practice, shovel tests were often terminated prematurely due to the presence of near-surface
deposits of compact, nearly impenetrable clayey sediments. All sediments were screened
through 6.35-millimeter (mm) (0.25-inch) hardware cloth and subsequently replaced in the

shovel test hole from which they were excavated. None of the shovel tests contained any
subsurface cultural resources, so no archeological site delineation shovel tests were excavated.
A handheld global positioning system (GPS) unit utilizing the Universal Transverse
Mercator (UTM) coordinate system and North American Datum (NAD) 27 was used to mark the
location of trenches and shovel tests. Digital photos were taken of trench wall profiles as well
as the general vicinity of each trench and recorded on a photograph log. The locations of the
backhoe trenches and shovel tests conducted within the five USACE jurisdictional areas are
presented in Figure 12. Backhoe trench data are presented in Appendix A, and shovel test data
are presented in Appendix B.

6.0 RESULTS

Horizon conducted the intensive survey on 18 to 20 April 2007. As all five of the
jurisdictional areas appeared to be located within alluvial settings (i.e., the floodplain of the
Brazos River), mechanically excavated backhoe trenching investigations were initially requested
at most of the locations by the USACE in order to adequately assess the potentially deep sands
located within the USACE jurisdictional areas. The Horizon field crew set out to excavate two to
four backhoe trenches at each USACE jurisdictional area, preferably two on each bank. In
some cases, however, trenching was deemed unnecessary due to substantial prior impacts or
the presence of shallow argillic clayey sediments. Shovel testing therefore constituted an
adequate survey technique for identifying cultural resources in these areas.
In all, a total of ten trenches and six shovel tests were excavated within the five USACE
jurisdictional areas. The survey resulted in the documentation of no newly recorded
archeological sites within the boundaries of the investigated five USACE jurisdictional areas.
No cultural materials were observed upon the surface, within any shovel test, or within any
trench wall profiles or excavated matrices. A brief description of each trench is provided below.
SHAWCR1-1 (Figure 13; see also Figures 5 and 6)
The trench was excavated within the native vegetative corridor that flanked the northern
bank of Shaw Creek so as not to impact the nearby cornfields. The trench was oriented eastwest and measured 5 m (16 ft) in length by 0.6 m (2 ft) in width. It was excavated to a depth of
2 m (7 ft) and consisted of a surface layer of mottled brown clay loam underlain by loose sandy
loam. Frequent plowing has likely dispersed the clayey alluvium evenly across the landscape,
resulting in a uniform surface layer that effectively caps the deep sandy alluvial deposits below.
No cultural materials were observed during the excavation of the trench. The resulting profile is
described below.
0-30 cm:

- Mottled brown clay loam
- No artifacts

30-130 cm:

- Dark reddish-brown sandy loam, very loose

TF4-3 (Figure 18, see also Figures 8 and 9)
Trench TF4-3 was located on the northern banks of the unnamed stream on an
undulating terrace that rose dramatically in elevation as one continued to progress northward.
The trench was oriented east-west and measured 5 m (16 ft) in length by 0.6 m (2 ft) in width. It
was excavated to a depth of 0.8 m (2.6 ft) and was found to consist primarily of dense black
clay. No cultural materials were observed during the excavation of the trench. The resulting

TF2-1 (Figure 20, see also Figures 10 and 11)
Trench TF2-1 was located on the southern banks of the Dead River within the confines
of a fenced upland grassy field. The trench was oriented east-west and measured 5 m (16 ft) in
length by 0.6 m (2 ft) in width. It was excavated to a depth of 2.1 m (7 ft) and was found to
consist of a surface layer of brown clay loam underlain by deep sandy alluvial deposits. No
cultural materials were observed during the excavation of the trench. The resulting profile is
described below.
0-30 cm:

- Brown clay loam
- No artifacts

- Blocky brown clay loam
- No artifacts

60-100 cm:

-Loose brown sandy loam
-No artifacts

100-210+ cm: -Pale brown sand
-No artifacts
TF2-2 (Figure 21, see also Figures 10 and 11)
Trench TF2-2 was situated in a lowland floodplain north of the Dead River. Small pools
of accumulated water were observed directly adjacent to the stream course with dense clayey
sediments present at the surface. Muddy conditions made backhoe access difficult in this area
and trenches were excavated as near to the banks as possible. The trench was oriented eastwest and measured 5 m (16 ft) in length by 0.6 m (2 ft) in width. It was excavated to a depth of
1.2 m (4 ft) and was found to consist of a surface layer of black clay followed by a succession of
thin layers of reddish-brown silty loam interspersed with pockets of dark brown clay. The prolific
stratigraphy within trench TF2-2 is likely the result of periodic flooding events. No cultural
materials were observed during the excavation of the trench. The resulting profile is described
below.

Trench TF2-3 was located north of trench TF2-2 on a small rise north of the Dead River.
The stratigraphy was found to be very similar to that of trench TF2-2, consisting of a series of
thin layers that were likely formed by flood action associated with the nearby Brazos River. The
trench was oriented east-west and measured 5 m (16 ft) in length by 0.6 m (2 ft) in width. It was
excavated to a depth of 1.2 m (4 ft). No cultural materials were observed during the excavation

7.0 RECOMMENDATIONS

Each of the five USACE jurisdictional areas within the proposed intake pipeline ROW
that were recommended for additional investigation were field-inspected or surveyed utilizing
the most effective means as deemed by the conditions of the area. No cultural materials were
recovered from any of the excavated shovel tests or backhoe trenches, revealed in any of the
resulting trench profiles, or observed upon the ground surface during the field efforts.
In general, the intake pipeline is proposed to traverse a primarily rural region dominated
by agricultural fields, pasturelands, and gravel mining areas. Substantial modifications to the
landscape are evidenced by the presence of artificial irrigation channels, stock ponds and water
treatment facilities, and improved pasturelands. Based on the results of these investigations, it
is Horizonâs opinion that the construction of the proposed intake pipeline will have no effect on
any significant cultural resources within the USACE jurisdictional areas. Horizon recommends
that cultural resources clearance be granted for the five USACE jurisdictional areas within the
proposed intake pipeline ROW.
