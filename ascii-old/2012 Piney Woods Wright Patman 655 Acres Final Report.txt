This report documents a cultural resource inventory conducted on 655 acres near Wright Patman Lake in Bowie County,
East Texas for the Piney Woods Project Office of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District
(USACE) which has proposed timber harvesting within the parcels. In compliance with Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act, the inventory was undertaken to ensure that any cultural resource sites would be considered
in planning and conducting the undertaking. Archeological fieldwork was conducted from March 21–30, 2012 and
included a 100 percent pedestrian inventory accompanied by intensive and systematic shovel testing. Archeologists
manually excavated 266 shovel tests as a discovery tactic and placed an additional 52 shovel tests on sites and around
positive shovel tests. Of these 318 total shovel tests, only ten tests were positive, returning prehistoric flakes and
ceramics. All subsurface artifacts were collected and will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory.
Five prehistoric archeological sites were discovered and documented (41BW775, 41BW776, 41BW777, 41BW778,
41BW779. None of the sites have potential for further research and all five sites are considered ineligible for nomination
to the National Register of Historic Places. No further work is recommended.

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 655 Acres, Bowie County, East Texas

Abstract
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of a cultural
resource inventory conducted on two tracts of land, totaling 655 acres in Bowie County in East
Texas. The two inventory parcels are near Wright Patman Lake. Work was conducted at the
request of the Piney Woods Project Office of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort
Worth District (USACE). The USACE has proposed timber harvesting within the parcels and,
in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, the inventory was
undertaken to ensure that any cultural resource sites located on the parcels would be considered
in planning and conducting the undertaking.
Archeological fieldwork was conducted from March 21–30, 2012. Fieldwork included a
100 percent pedestrian inventory accompanied by intensive and systematic shovel testing.
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra) archeologists manually excavated 266 shovel tests
as a discovery tactic and placed an additional 52 shovel tests on sites and around isolated
positive shovel tests. Of these 318 shovel tests, ten tests were positive, including eight positive
tests on sites and two isolated positive tests. AmaTerra archeologists recovered artifacts such
as prehistoric flakes and prehistoric ceramics in the positive tests. All subsurface artifacts were
collected and will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory.
Five archeological sites were discovered and investigated during the survey. All five sites were
fully documented. All five sites, 41BW775, 41BW776, 41BW777, 41BW778, and 41BW779
are considered not eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
and no further work is warranted.

Chapter 1

Project Description
1.1	The Undertaking
The United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District (USACE) is responsible for
managing certain federally-owned lands in East Texas in association with lakes, reservoirs
and navigable waterways. These management responsibilities include 45,063 acres at Wright
Patman Lake (acreage is outside conservation pool). Much of this acreage is forested by mature
pine and pine-hardwood stands. In conjunction with the existing management plans for the
several reservoirs and in accordance with accepted silviculture methodologies, the USACE
has planned certain management areas for selective timber thinning. Commercial thinning
removes marketable trees in uneven-aged stands (not clear-cut) through single tree selection.
Removal of crop trees often disturbs the ground surface, but extensive subsurface disturbance
is not common.
While planning and conducting undertakings that have the potential to affect historic properties,
the USACE must take such resources into account, and in compliance with Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 as amended through 1992 (P.L. 89–665
et seq.), the inventory was authorized by the USACE to identify any archeological sites,
buildings, structures, or other resources that may be eligible for nomination to the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP). All inventories were conducted on lands owned by the
federal government and managed by the USACE.

1.2 	Location
The project area is composed of two separate parcels located at Wright Patman Lake in Bowie
County, Texas. Together, the two parcels total 655 acres. The smaller parcel, Dam Area,
encompasses 157 acres, while the Kelly Creek Park parcel totals 498 acres. Both parcels are
on the Wright Patman Lake, Texas USGS 7.5’ topographic quadrangle.
Wright Patman Lake is located on the Sulphur River about 18 kilometers (km) southwest of
Texarkana in Bowie and Cass counties (Figure 1-1). The far upstream portions of the reservoir
extend into Morris, Titus, and Red River counties. Initially known as Texarkana Reservoir,
the lake was renamed in the late 1970s in honor of the East Texas congressman (Breeding
2002). The dam was constructed between 1948 and 1957 for flood-control, conservation, and
recreational purposes. Elevation of the conservation pool typically varies seasonally; normal
elevation in winter is 220.6 feet (ft) above mean sea level (amsl), or 67.2 meters (m) amsl, and
227.5 ft amsl (69.3 m amsl) in summer. Flood storage capacity is 259.5 ft amsl (79.1 m amsl).
During the summer, the lake can cover 33,750 acres; the normal winter conservation pool is
20,300 acres. Both parcels totaling 655 acres are currently planned for timber thinning.

1.2.1 Dam Area Parcel
The Dam Area parcel is located in Bowie County north of the Sulphur River, about 8 km
southwest of Texarkana, 18 km east of Maud, and 23 km north of Atlanta (Figure 1-2). Totaling
157 acres, this parcel is situated just under the Wright Patman Lake dam, on a terrace west
the Aiken Creek Floodplain. The triangular tract measures approximately 2,100 m north—
south by 650 m east—west. It is located on the Wright Patman Lake USGS 7.5’ topographic
quadrangle. Elevation varies from 235 ft amsl (71.6 m amsl) at the floodplain on the western
boundary to above 265 ft amsl (80.8 m amsl).

1.2.2 Kelly Creek Park Parcel
The Kelly Creek Park parcel is Bowie County north of the Sulphur River, about 10 km southeast
of Maud, 17 km southwest of Texarkana, and 19 km north of Atlanta (Figure 1-3). Totaling 498
acres, this parcel sits on the north shore of the Kelly Creek arm of Wright Patman Lake. The
tract measures approximately 2,500 m east-west by 1,700 m north-south. It is located mostly
on the Wright Patman Lake USGS 7.5’ topographic quadrangle with the western portion falling
on the Maud quadrangle. Elevation varies from 230 ft amsl (70.1 m amsl) at the lakeshore to
above 270 ft amsl (82.3 m amsl).

1.3 	Natural Environment
The project area is located in the Piney Woods region of East Texas. Forested areas in the
region include secondary growth and mature pine and pine-hardwood stands. Pine stands
observed during the field inventory typically consisted of loblolly (Pinus taeda), shortleaf
(Pinus echinata), and longleaf (Pinus palustris) pines. Hardwood trees were predominantly
various oaks, including southern red oak (Quercus falcate) and white oak (Quercus alba),
and the American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) (Diggs et al. 1999). Figure 1-4 illustrate
typical landscape views for the project area.

Wildlife species common to the area include whitetail deer (Odocoileus virginianus), red fox
(Vulpes vulpes), bobcat (Felis rufus), squirrel (Sciurus spp.), raccoon (Procyon lotor), opossum
(Didelphus virginiana), nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), nutria (Myocastor
coypus), river otter (Lutra canadensis), and mink (Mustela vison) (Davis and Schmidly
1994). Lake habitats support a variety of turtles, frogs (Figure 1-5), and snakes, as well as
largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides salmoides), flathead (Pylodictis olivaris) and channel
(Ictalurus punctatus) catfish, white bass (Morone chrysops), white (Pomoxis annularis) and

black (Pomoxis nigromaculatus) crappie, and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and other
sunfish (Thomas et al. 2007). Bird species include the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker
(Picoides borealis), bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), osprey (Pandion haliaetus),
bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), white pelican (Elecanus
erythrorhynchos), common loon (Gavia immer), heron (Ardea spp.) and egret (Egretta spp.)
(Bull and Farrand 1996).

1.4 	Geology and Soils
1.4.1 Underlying Geologic Formations
The geologic formations of the project area consist of the Wilcox groups undivided of the
Eocene, and Alluvium of the Pleistocene. Within these groups, varying formations compose
the underlying bedrock.
The underlying bedrock of the two parcels consists mainly of the Wilcox group undivided
of the Eocene, with Alluvium of the Pleistocene at the western edge of the Anderson Creek
parcel. The Wilcox group undivided consists of sandy, lignitiferous, littoral clays that are crossbedded with river sands, compact non-calcareous clays, and stratified deltaic silts. The basal
beds of this formation “mark the transition from marine muds and silts of the underlying Wills
Point formation to coarser, littoral, deltaic, and non-marine deposits of the Wilcox” (Sellards et
al. 1990:573). This formation has a thickness of approximately 1,260 ft (384 m).

1.4.2 Soil Formations
Soils within the survey areas include Adaton-Muskogee, Annona, Ashford, Blevins, Sardis,
Sawyer, Thenas, Wooodtell, and Wrightsville-Rodessa series, and an additional unnamed series
(Soils Survey Staff 2011). All soil descriptions are from the Natural Resources Conservation
Service (Soil Survey Staff 2011).
Soils within the Dam Area parcel include Adaton-Muskogee complex, Eylau, Ruston, Sacul,
Sawyer, and Woodtell series, as well as an unnamed Udorthents series (Table 1-1). The Woodtell
series is shallow with clay at 15 cmbs and sandy loam above. The unnamed Udorthents series
is completely disturbed, with no original ground surface remaining. The remaining soils are
silty or sandy loams to a depth below 80 cmbs.
Soils within the Kelly Creek Park parcel include Adaton-Muskogee complex, Blevins, Bryarly,
Ruston, Sawyer, Thenas, and Woodtell series (Table 1-1). The Bryarly and Woodtell series are
shallow with clay at 10 to 15 cmbs. The remaining are silty or sandy loams to a depth below
80 cmbs.

Cultural Context
2.1 	Previous Investigations
A map and records search was conducted on March 5, 2012, using the Texas Archeological
Sites Atlas online database, maintained by the Texas Historical Commission (THC). This
search determined that no previously recorded archeological sites are plotted within the 655
acres surveyed but 36 sites are located within one mile of the two survey parcels.

2.1.1 Dam Area
The 1949 River Basin (RBS) and the 1970 Lake Texarkana Enlargement (LTE) surveys both
came near the Dam Area parcel, but neither of the surveys are marked in their entirety on the
THC Atlas. The RBS resulted in at least four sites being recorded northeast of the project
area. The LTE survey resulted in eight sites documented to the west across the dam, and to
the northeast, but it is unknown how many of these were initially recorded during the RBS.
The THC Atlas only has data from the LTE but the trinomials suggest that the sites were
recorded earlier. In 1976, the Rural Electrification Administration (REA) conducted a survey
along US 59 south of the project area in which no sites were recorded within one mile of the
parcel. In 1997, Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI) conducted a survey to the northwest of the parcel
in which eight sites were recorded within one mile of the parcel. Ecological Communication
Corporation (EComm) surveyed the 43 acres directly north of the parcel in 2002 in which
two sites were recorded (Trierweiler et al., 2002). In 2010, EComm conducted surveys of two
parcels, straddling the dam, just under one mile south of the parcels, recording no sites. Since
there are sites not covered by survey shapefiles on the THC Atlas more surveys were likely
conducted within a mile of the project but the data for these survey shapes is not available. In
total, 25 sites are recorded within one mile of the project area and are listed in Table 2-1.

2.1.2 Kelly Creek Park
The 1949 RBS and 1970 LTE surveys both came near the Kelly Creek Park parcel, with the
latter actually marked as crossing a portion of the parcel. The RBS resulted in one site being
recorded within one mile of the project area. The LTE survey crosses the parcel at the far
eastern end and covers 1.5 acres. The LTE survey resulted in four sites recorded within one
mile of the parcel. Neither the RBS or LTE surveys are marked in their entirety on the THC
Atlas and could have covered more acreage within one mile of the parcel. In 1969, the Fort
Worth District of the Army Corps of Engineers conducted a small survey just south of the
project area near the Kelly Creek Marina. In 2004 EComm conducted a survey directly to the
west of the project area in which four sites were recorded. This survey included two additional
parcels in which portions are within one mile; these three parcels together were 742 acres total

2.2 	Cultural Framework
The prehistoric cultural framework in the Northeast Texas region has been recorded by many
archeological investigations and includes the Paleoindian period, Archaic and Woodland
periods, and periods of Caddo horticultural adaptation. The cultural framework discussed
below has been adapted from Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993) and Perttula (1993a, 1993b, 1995,
2004).

2.2.1 Paleoindian Period
Generally, there is a lack of data relating to the Paleoindian period (ca. 9500–7000 BC) in
Northeast Texas. While many projectile points such as Clovis, Plainview, Dalton, Scottsbluff,
and San Patrice have been recovered, most were isolated, mixed, or surface finds or found in
excavations of later contexts (Perttula 2004). The distribution of artifacts suggests that most
sites occur within the valleys of major stream basins and resource-rich areas.

Cultural Context

Despite the paucity of evidence, generalizations have been made regarding settlement mobility
and subsistence patterns during the Paleoindian period in Northeast Texas. Evidence suggests
that groups occupied small camps and used a generalized toolkit, and that they were more
likely to be highly mobile hunters and gatherers rather than specialized large-game hunters
(Perttula 2004).

2.2.2 Archaic Period
The Archaic period (ca. 7000–200 BC) is subdivided into the Early (ca. 7000–4000 BC),
Middle (ca. 4000–2000 BC), and Late Archaic (ca. 2000–200 BC), although in the Northeast
region of Texas, reliable dating is not yet available to unequivocally substantiate these different
periods. During the Early Archaic, sites are much smaller and more widely distributed,
suggesting high group mobility within large territories. Archeological data also suggest a
generalized hunting and gathering subsistence strategy that is focused on the exploitation of a
wide variety of resources. Although most Early Archaic sites are only briefly used, they are apt
to be concentrated in the larger drainage areas in the region (Perttula 2004).
The Middle Archaic is characterized by considerably larger sites within major basins in the
region, a more diverse hunting toolkit, the use of ground and polished stone tools, and the
increased use of plant foods as indicated by grinding implements and burned rock features.
Possible hearths, ovens, and burned rock concentrations in the region suggest processing and
cooking of plant resources was important (Perttula 2004).
Throughout Northeast Texas, Late Archaic-period sites are relatively common along major
streams and springs in the uplands and on tributary drainages. Population density may have
peaked during the Late Archaic, as evidenced by the apparent increase in the number of sites and
greater distribution of sites over the landscape. The large number and widespread distribution
of sites also suggests limited group mobility, the possible use of more defined territories, and
regular exploitation of localized food resources (Perttula 2004).

2.2.3 Woodland/Early Ceramic Period
The Woodland period (ca. 200 BC–AD 800) is not well defined but is largely identified by
plainware ceramics tempered with clay/grog or bone and Gary projectile points. At sites near
the Red River, artifact assemblages are largely made up of ceramics, while at other sites in
Northeast Texas, such as near the Sulphur and Sabine rivers, ceramics are not as common. One
explanation for this difference may be possible regional differences in food processing and
diet during this time, all of which may have had an effect on the degree of sedentism between
regions (Perttula 2004).
To date, archeological evidence suggests Woodland populations were hunters and gatherers
who lived in larger groups and settled for longer periods of time in certain locations than
they had in the Archaic period. In some cases, such as at the Ray site, small settlements with
structures and middens suggest a more concentrated occupation, but these sites are not as
12

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 655 Acres, Bowie County, East Texas

permanent as those seen at later Caddo-period sites in the region (Perttula 2004). With the
exception of those in the Sulphur and Neches-Angelina river basins, Woodland sites are not
very common throughout much of Northeast Texas. No Woodland-period burial mounds have
been documented in the region.

2.2.4 Formative Caddo Period and Early Caddo Period
Sites dating to the Formative Caddo period (ca. AD 800–1000) and Early Caddo period
(ca. AD 1000–1200) are located primarily in the uplands just adjacent to major streams and
smaller tributaries and springs. Settlement locations with fertile soils and good drainage were
primarily chosen for habitation and cultivation of maize, squash, and native plants. Permanent
settlements including structures, middens, pits, cemeteries, and artifacts such as tools and
ceramics were widespread. Common settlements in the region include hamlets and farmsteads
with rectangular and circular structures, many with associated cemeteries. In addition to small
farmsteads, larger communities such as the George C. Davis site on the Neches River are also
encountered. These villages are more common during the Early Caddo period and continue
through the Middle Caddo period, and include large groups of many structures, mound
centers, and elite burial pits. Distinctive artifacts such as celts, ceramic pipes and earspools,
and diversely decorated ceramic bowls and jars are commonly recovered from Formative and
Early Caddo sites (Perttula 2004).

2.2.5 Middle Caddo Period
Most archeological sites in Northeast Texas date to the Middle Caddo period (ca. AD 1200–
1400). These sites continue the trend of diverse ceramic artifacts and larger settlements with
mounds seen at the end of the Early Caddo period. One example of such a site is the Oak Hill
Village (41RK214), a large village with mounds, middens, and public structures. Cultivation of
maize and squash continued, but there is no evidence of dependence on maize and other crops
until after AD 1300 (Perttula 2004).

2.2.6 Late Caddo Period
Archeological sites that date to the Late Caddo period (ca. AD 1400–1680) are abundant in
Northeast Texas. Late Caddo sites are predominantly found in river basins such as the Red,
Cypress Creek, and Neches River basins. Smaller groups of sites are present in the Angelina,
Attoyac, middle and upper Sabine, and lower Cypress Bayou basins. Most Late Caddo-period
archeological sites are either large permanent communities or smaller farmsteads, both with
associated cemeteries. Late Caddo-period earthen mounds were constructed and primarily used
between AD 1400 and 1540, except in the Red River, where mound construction continued
until 1650 or 1700 (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993). Stable isotope and bioarcheological evidence
from the region indicate that at this time Caddo peoples were heavily dependent on maize as
their main dietary staple.

Cultural Context

The Late Caddo Titus phase (ca. AD 1430–1680) refers to the archeological remains of Caddo
peoples living in the northeastern Texas Piney Woods between the Sulphur and Sabine rivers.
These Caddos lived in a hierarchical and elite-controlled society. They constructed both
small settlements with family cemeteries and large settlements with status-ranked community
cemeteries, and made culturally distinct and diverse ceramics. Titus-phase sites usually are
found on valley terraces and upland slopes, projections, and basins, and permanent settlements
are usually located near freshwater springs (Perttula 2004).
The period after which European contact occurred (ca. AD 1540) is commonly referred to as
the Protohistoric period. In 1542, the De Soto-Moscoso entrada entered the region from the
Mississippi River valley and a number of different Caddo groups were probably encountered
by Spanish explorers. Within 100 to 150 years after the entrada, the area occupied by the
Titus-phase Caddo was mostly abandoned (Perttula 2004). While the archeological evidence
of Caddo-Spanish contact is sparse in Northeast Texas, intermittent contact probably had
considerable effects on Caddo groups, including exposure to a variety of infectious diseases
like smallpox to which they had no immunity (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993).

2.2.7 Historic Period
Historic Caddo Period
The Historic Caddo period (ca. AD 1680–1860) is defined as the sustained European presence
in and occupation of the Caddo area by Europeans in the region. It is during this period that
the Caddo and all other Native American groups except the Alabama and Coushatta were
eventually moved from Texas to the Indian Territory. Most Historic Caddo settlements in the
region were small farmsteads and hamlets with associated household cemeteries. Communities
were composed of many of these farmsteads spread out over large territories. Artifacts
recovered from these sites include a wide variety of Caddo ceramics, basketry, ornaments,
and bone, stone, and wooden tools. European goods are commonly found on Historic Caddo
sites after ca. AD 1740 and include guns and gun parts, glass beads, and metal items such as
kettles, hatchets, knives, hoes, lead balls, and silver, brass, and copper ornaments (Kenmotsu
and Perttula 1993).
European Exploration and Historic Periods
The first likely European expedition into the area around Wright Patman Lake was led by Luis
de Moscoso Alvarado in 1542. Moscoso was a member of the Hernando de Soto expedition into
the southeastern US and took over after he died in 1539. Looking for an overland route back
to New Spain, he crossed into the territory that became Bowie County, and used existing trails
established by the Caddo to move further into the interior of Texas before turning around and
traveling back to the coast (Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1993). French visitors to the area included
Henri Jountel, who was part of the LaSalle expedition, and Henri de Tonti, who went to the
area to look for survivors from Fort St. Louis (Harper 2002b). Permanent European presence
began in 1719, when Le Poste des Cadodaquious was established by the French at a location
just to the northwest of Texarkana. Although a fort in name, the establishment served more as
14

AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 655 Acres, Bowie County, East Texas

a trading station and supply base for further expeditions. The fort was abandoned a few years
after the Louisiana cession to Spain in 1762. The fort was reestablished in 1770 by the Spanish,
under the name San Luiz de los Cadodachos, but the Nasoni tribes with whom they were trying
to foster a relationship left the area soon after (Britton 2002). Finally, the Americans explored
the area in 1806 when the Red River Expedition, launched by Thomas Jefferson, traveled up
the Red River to Spanish Bluff, where they were forced to turn back by Spanish soldiers.
Immigration and settlement of the areas that would become Bowie and Cass Counties began
in the 1820s and 1830s. Both Anglo-Americans and members of the Shawnee, Delaware, and
Kickapoo Indians settled there, but the Native American tribes moved on within ten years.
By 1846, the establishment of separate counties had been made and county lines had been
resolved. The white settlers were primarily from the South and set up slave-operated cotton
plantations as well as raised corn, hogs, and some cattle. Just before the Civil War, the slave
population outnumbered the white population in Bowie County, and numbered just under half
in Cass County (Harper 2002a; Harper 2002b). The white population strongly supported the
secession movement and the Confederate war effort. Although no battle took place in the area,
federal troops occupied Bowie County in 1867 on behalf of the Freedmen’s Bureau to assist
black residents in obtaining their legal and political equality. This enflamed white residents,
who had lost much of their capital once the slaves were freed, and secretly supported anti-black
movements such as Cullen Baker’s gang and the Ku Klux Klan.
By the 1870s, the Texas and Pacific Railway was being built and several towns sprouted up
in the area. Texarkana was founded in 1873, at the site of an abandoned Caddo village, where
two major railroads would soon meet (Chandler and Howe 1939). It immediately became the
largest trading and manufacturing center in the area. Maud was formed in 1870. Atlanta was
founded in 1871, and it, along with Douglassville, was an economic center for the surrounding
rural community (Hazlewood 2002; Harper 2002c).
The entire area remained primarily rural with an agricultural economy, but small manufacturing
also employed some of the local population. The Depression had a devastating effect on the
area, but World War II brought the establishment of the Red River Army Depot and the Lone
Star Army Ammunition Plant, which increasingly employed many of the local residents from
that point forward (Harper 2002a). Changes in the economic market drew many people away
from farming and into manufacturing and trade. However, populations grew slowly, if at all,
and the inhabitants remained relatively poor. Wright Patman Lake was completed in 1957 and
provided recreation facilities as well as flood control measures.

Methods
The archeological field inventory was conducted in one field session from March 22–29, 2012,
by a crew of four persons. Thirty-two person-days were spent in the field. Methods and density
of shovel testing complied with, or exceeded, the minimum requirements for field tactics
stipulated by the USACE (2007).

3.1	Pedestrian Survey
For each parcel, a logistical plan was prepared in advance using ArcGIS to determine the
minimum number of shovel tests per transect needed to obtain the coverage goal. Each field
archeologist was given a copy of a USGS topographic view of the parcels and was assigned
a transect line and a targeted number of shovel tests. Transect lines were designated with an
alpha-numeric prefix, and individual shovel tests along each transect line were numbered so
that shovel test “7E-4” identified the fourth test along the seventh transect of the fifth day of
the project. In general, each crew member followed his/her own transect, walking parallel with
the other crew members. Each transect was spaced 20 meters from the next across the entire
project. Occasionally, for logistical reasons, two crew members doubled up with one person
digging the shovel tests and another screening and recording the field forms, or two or more
surveyors would “leapfrog” along one transect, each digging alternating shovel tests. Surveyors
were given flexibility to place their shovel tests in likely locations such as topographic rises,
rather than at set intervals.
Recent debris such as aluminum cans, beer bottles and plastic detritus was commonly observed,
but no further attention was paid to such items clearly less than 50 years old.
At all shovel tests, GPS readings were taken to verify transect and shovel test locations. Tests
were selectively placed on landforms shown by previous research to be preferred site locations,
such as ridge lines, knolls, and promontories. In some cases, shovel tests could not be dug due
to erosion, or steep slopes, these locations were individually recorded on the shovel testing log.
Positive shovel tests were flagged with pink-glo flagging tape while negative shove tests were
flagged with orange-glo tape.
All shovel tests were 30–35 cm in diameter and were dug to the bottom of the Holocene
deposits as indicated by clay or to 80 cmbs if no clay was present. Tests were individually
recorded with regard to depth, soil type and color, and cultural material present. Tests were
dug in natural stratigraphic levels not exceeding 20 cm in thickness, and all excavated material
was screened through ¼-inch (6.4 mm) stainless steel mesh. All cultural material was collected
with the exception of recent objects such as bottle glass shards, nails, and aluminum pop-tabs.
These were assumed to indicate recent disturbance and were not collected. All shovel tests
were backfilled.

Chapter 3

Methods

Once in the field it was found that the parcels contained numerous small mounds less than
a meter high and ranging from three to 15 meters in diameter, covering most of the parcels.
Special effort was made to test on mounds where possible due to the deeper soils. Areas off of
the mounds typically had clay at shallower depths and were much wetter than the soils on the
mounds. More than 200 of these small mounds were tested over the course of the survey.
Each positive shovel test was further investigated by excavating additional shovel tests in
the immediate vicinity at 5–15 m distances, or spread around nearby mounds, up to ten tests
in an area. If more than one of these tests were positive or if more than two artifacts were
found in any single test, then the location was designated as a site. Otherwise, the positive
test was designated as an isolated occurrence. The UTM coordinates of isolates were plotted
and the artifacts were collected, but these were not further recorded. The recorded locations of
previously recorded sites were similarly investigated using multiple shovel tests.

3.2

Density of Shovel Testing

The contractual scope of work issued by the USACE specified that at a minimum, one shovel
test was to be excavated per three acres (equivalent to 0.33 tests per acre). Using this rate of
coverage, a total of 219 shovel tests was the minimum required to inventory the 655 acres
(Table 3-1). In an attempt to ensure greater coverage than this minimum, 266 transect shovel
tests were actually excavated or over 20 percent more than the contractual minimum. For the
project as a whole, final coverage averaged about 0.41 tests per acre. In addition, 52 shovel
tests were dug on sites, or around isolated occurrences. Appendix B provides maps of shovel
test locations by parcel, and the data from all 318 shovel tests are presented in Appendix C.

3.3 	Evaluation of Significance
The NHPA of 1966, as amended, [16 USC 470 et seq.] created the NRHP to preserve and
protect important aspects of our nation’s cultural heritage. Among other actions, the Act directs
federal agencies to assume responsibility for the preservation of historic properties located
on their land or controlled by them, and further stipulates that such agencies must take into
account the effects of their actions on cultural resources. Pursuant to this direction, agencies
are required to locate, inventory, and nominate to the Secretary of the Interior all properties
18

AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 655 Acres, Bowie County, East Texas

owned or under their control that appear to qualify for nomination to the NRHP. Eligibility for
nomination to the NRHP is restricted to properties that are significant and possess integrity as
defined in 36 CFR §60.4:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering and
culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association (36 CFR §60.4).
Significance is further defined in four criteria. Cultural resources are considered significant if:
a) they are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or
b) they are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
c) they embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period or method
of construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high
artistic values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
component may lack individual distinction; or
d) they have yielded, or may be likely to yield information important in prehistory
or history (36 CFR §60.4).
Cultural resources may qualify for inclusion on the NRHP under any of the four evaluation
criteria. Methods developed prior to the current field work specified that prehistoric sites were
to be evaluated for significance with respect to NHPA Criterion D. The demonstrated data
content of each site was to be compared to important research contexts. Sites in good condition
and state of preservation and having several data types bearing on one or more of the research
contexts were to be evaluated as significant under Criterion D. Those sites that were observed
to be in poor condition or state of preservation and/or sites with no data types bearing on one
or more of the research contexts were to be evaluated as not significant. Finally, sites whose
expression could not be satisfactorily investigated using the survey level tactics employed by
this study were to be classified as being of unknown significance.
Historic sites, in addition to being evaluated under Criterion D as described above, were also
to be evaluated with respect to Criteria A, B, and C. Archival research was to be conducted to
determine whether any historic sites are associated with important historical events or persons.
Criterion C was to be applied only for historic sites that retain architectural elements.

Results
Two parcels totaling 655 acres were investigated at Wright Patman Lake. Within the two
parcels five new archeological sites were discovered and documented. In addition, two isolated
occurrences were encountered and investigated. No standing structures or engineering features
were encountered.

4.1

Dam Area

The Dam Area parcel totaled 157 acres and was inventoried using 63 shovel tests, for a density
of 0.40 shovel tests per acre. No new cultural resource sites were documented. Soils in the
parcel were deep when tests were excavated on mounds. Tests not excavated on mounds were
quickly inundated or encountered shallow clay. A small drainage runs west and east through
the southern half of the parcel (Figure 4-1) and several areas of the parcel are completely
inundated (Figure 4-2). The western border of the parcel is the cut line of the barrow pit that
was created in the making of the Wright Patman Lake dam. Appendices A and B plot the
locations and results of all shovel tests excavated within the Dam Area parcel.

4.2 	Kelly Creek Park
The Kelly Creek Park parcel totaled 498 acres and was inventoried using 203 shovel tests,
for a net density of 0.41 shovel tests per acre. Five newly discovered cultural resource sites
(41BW775, 41BW776, 41BW777, 41BW778, and 41BW779) were investigated, along with
two isolated occurrences. See Appendices A and B for the locations and results of all shovel
tests excavated within the Kelly Creek Park parcel. A report on the analysis of recovered
prehistoric ceramics by Tim Perttula is presented as Appendix C. Maps showing the locations
of archeological sites and the State of Texas Archeological Data Site Forms are presented in
Appendices D and E; as they contain sensitive information, they are distributed on CD-ROM
for restricted access only.

4.2.1 41BW775
41BW775 is a prehistoric site of undetermined age measuring an estimated 20 x 20 m. It is
on a low mound, about half a meter high, on the side slope of a peninsula leading into Wright
Patman Lake. The mound is about 239 ft amsl (72.8 m amsl). The site has moderate tree
cover, little secondary growth and some deadfall. The overstory is sweetgum and oak while the
understory is Carolina buckthorn. Soils within the site are Sawyer silt loam. Surface visibility
is near zero percent due to leaf litter (Figure 4-3).
In addition to pedestrian survey, ten shovel tests were excavated to assess the nature of cultural
resource deposition and assist in delineating site boundaries. Three of the shovel tests were
excavated on the same small mound, two of which were positive; two more tests were excavated
on nearby mounds but returned nothing (Figure 4-4). The initial positive test (4C-1) encountered
two flakes between 40 and 60 cmbs, and two flakes and one lithic shatter between 60 and 80
cmbs. In ST7 approximately seven m west of 4C-1 one piece of lithic shatter was recovered

between 20 and 40 cmbs. Six of the
ten shovel tests were excavated to
full depth of 80 cm, two tests were
terminated between 60 and 70 cmbs,
and two tests were terminated at
40 cmbs due to basal clay. In total,
only two of the ten shovel tests were
positive, for a ubiquity measure
of 20 percent, yielding four lithic
flakes and two pieces of lithic shatter
between 20 and 80 cmbs. No other
artifacts were recovered.

41BW777

41BW777 is a prehistoric site dating
to the Caddo period measuring
an estimated 20 x 20 m. It is on a
mound on a slope leading into
Wright Patman Lake. The mound is
less than a meter in height and about
10 m across; it is situated 238 ft amsl
(72.5 m amsl). The site has moderate
tree cover, and little secondary

is vines and Carolina buckthorn.
Soils within the site are Woodtell
very fine sandy loam. Surface
visibility is near zero percent due to
leaf litter (Figure 4-7).
In addition to pedestrian survey,
nine shovel tests were excavated to
assess the nature of cultural resource
deposition and assist in delineating
site boundaries. Five of the shovel
tests were excavated on the same
low mound, with only one positive
(Figure 4-8). Two more tests were
excavated upslope from the mound
and two downslope. The initial
positive test (16D-1) encountered
two plain ceramic sherds and one
flake between 20 and 40 cmbs, and
one more sherd between 40 and
60 cmbs which refits with a sherd

from the above level. The ceramic
sherds date to the Caddo period and
are further described in Appendix C.
Shovel test 6 was excavated within
one meter of the positive but still
returned negative results. Five of the
shovel tests reached terminal depth at
80 cmbs; the remaining four shovel
tests encountered clay between 30
and 60 cmbs. In total, only one of
the nine shovel tests was positive,
for a ubiquity measure of 11 percent,
yielding one lithic flake and three
prehistoric ceramic sherds between

4.2.4 41BW778
41BW778 is a prehistoric site of
undetermined age measuring an
estimated 20 x 20 m. It is on a low
mound about 20 cm high on the side
slope of a peninsula leading into
Wright Patman Lake. The mound is
about 12 m across and 240 ft amsl
(73.2 m amsl). The site has moderate
tree cover, and little secondary
growth. The overstory is pine and
oak while the understory is sweetgum
and Carolina buckthorn. Soils within
the site are Woodtell very fine sandy
loam. Surface visibility is near zero
percent due to leaf litter (Figure 4-9).
In addition to pedestrian survey,
ten shovel tests were excavated to
assess the nature of cultural resource
deposition and assist in delineating
site boundaries. Six of the shovel
tests were excavated on the same
small mound, two of which were
positive; four more were excavated
on four other nearby mounds (Figure
4-10). The initial positive shovel

test (18D-2) encountered two
flakes between 40 and 60 cmbs.
Approximately three meters to the
west in ST 5 two flakes were found
at 40 to 60 cmbs and two flakes and
one shatter were recovered from
60 to 80 cmbs. Only two of the ten
shovel test reached terminal depth of
80 cm with the remaining eight tests
stopping between 35 and 65 cmbs.
In total only two of the ten shovel
tests were positive, for a ubiquity
measure of 20 percent, yielding six
lithic flakes between and one piece
of lithic shatter between 40 and
80 cmbs. No other artifacts were
recovered.

41BW779

41BW779 is a prehistoric site dating
to the Caddo period measuring an
estimated 20 x 20 m. It is on a low
mound on a terrace over Wright
Patman Lake. The mound measures
about 15 m by 10 m by 1 m high at
253 ft amsl (77.1 m amsl). The site
has moderate tree cover, and little
secondary growth. The overstory is
pine, and oak, while the understory
is sweetgum and other small trees.
Soils within the site are AdatonMuskogee complex with sandy loam
texture. Surface visibility is near
zero percent due to leaf litter (Figure
4-11).

In addition to pedestrian survey,
nine shovel tests were excavated
to assess the nature of cultural
resource deposition and assist in
delineating site boundaries. Two
of the shovel tests were excavated
on the same mound, with only one
positive. The other seven tests were

each excavated on adjacent mounds
(Figure 4-12). The initial positive test
(22E-2) encountered two ceramic
sherds between 40 and 60 cmbs and
two more sherds just below between
60 and 80 cmbs. Three of these four
sherds refit, and all date to the Caddo
period and are further described in
Appendix C. Shovel Test 3 was
initially thought to be positive, but
in the lab, it was determined that
the artifacts recovered were flat
sandstone. Eight of the nine shovel
tests reached terminal depth of 80
cmbs or deeper, only ST 7 on a
lower mound encountered water at
60 cmbs. In total, only one of the
nine shovel tests was positive, for
a ubiquity measure of 11 percent,
yielding four prehistoric ceramic
sherds between 40 and 80 cmbs. No
other artifacts were recovered.

4.2.6 Isolated Occurrences
A thumbnail scraper (Figure 4-13)
was recovered from ST 2C-2. Eight
shovel tests were excavated around
the positive test, including one
within a meter. All eight shovel tests
were negative.
One tertiary flake was recovered
from ST 21C-1. Seven shovel tests
were excavated around the positive
test, including one within a meter.
All seven shovel tests were negative.

Conclusions
5.1 	Summary of Work
This cultural resources inventory investigated two parcels near Wright Patman Lake in Bowie
County, East Texas. The sample consisted of 655 total acres including 157 acres within the
Dam Area parcel and 498 acres within the Kelly Creek Park parcel. Field methods included a
pedestrian survey accompanied by excavation of 266 shovel tests. Tests were approximately 30
cm in diameter and were dug to either the clay horizon or to 80 cmbs. Shovel testing density
for tests excavated on survey transects was 0.41 tests per acre.
The inventory investigated five newly discovered archeological sites. Of the 318 shovel tests
dug, only ten tests were positive, for an overall yield of three percent (Table 5-1). Eight of
the ten positive tests were on newly recorded sites. Two of the positive shovel tests were
isolated occurrences that were not associated with any site. The remaining 308 shovel tests
were negative, including 256 negative tests that were dug on transects and 52 negative tests
that were dug off transect around positive shovel tests which were used to delineate sites
(n=37) or around isolated positive shovel tests (n=15).

Management Recommendations

The eligibility of any given archeological site for nomination to the NRHP is determined by
evaluating the site’s significance, or its potential to contribute meaningfully to future scientific
research. Research potential is assessed by comparing the types of data that are known—or are
suspected—to exist at the site, together with their provenience, context, and integrity, against
a set of research questions that have been previously recognized for similar sites in the region.

Conclusions

For the current project, these research questions are discussed in the planning document for
East Texas (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993).
All five sites that were investigated during this survey are evaluated as not eligible for inclusion
into the NRHP. Each of the sites is discussed below and a tabular summary is presented in
Table 5-2.

41BW775—Ten shovel tests were excavated; four lithic flakes and two pieces of shatter were
recovered between 20 and 80 cmbs in two of the shovel tests. Based on the overall lack of
features, diagnostics, and low artifact yield, this site offers little or no potential to answer
significant questions regarding regional or local archeology. As a result, it is recommended as
not eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and no further research is recommended.
41BW776—Seven shovel tests were excavated; three lithic flakes were recovered between
20 and 80 cmbs. Based on the overall lack of features, diagnostics, and low artifact yield,
this site offers little or no potential to answer significant questions regarding regional or local
archeology. As a result, it is recommended as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and no
further research is recommended.
41BW777—Nine shovel tests were excavated; three prehistoric ceramic sherds and one lithic
flake were recovered between 20 and 60 cmbs in one shovel test. The ceramic sherds date
to the Caddo period. The site has an extremely low density of cultural material; therefore, it
is unlikely that further investigations of the site would yield significant data and the site is
recommended as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP.
41BW778—Ten shovel tests were excavated; six lithic flakes and one piece of shatter were
recovered between 40 and 80 cmbs in two of the shovel tests. Based on the overall lack of

Analysis of Prehistoric Ceramic Sherds from 41BW777
and 41BW779, Bowie County, Texas
Timothy K. Perttula
Introduction
Recent archeological investigations at Lake Wright Patman recovered prehistoric ceramic
sherds from 41BW777 (n=2) and 41BW779 (n=2). The analysis of these sherds follows the
recently developed Council of Texas Archeologists Ceramic Protocol for East Texas Woodland
and Caddo sites (Perttula 2010).
Analytical Approach
The initial sorting procedure involved an examination of each sherd to identify any sherds that
could be joined together and determined to be part of the same vessel (i.e., fitters). When fitters
were identified, they were treated as single sherds for purposes of analysis. Treating conjoined
sherds as single sherds avoids skewing the analysis toward attributes over-represented by
multiple fragments of a single vessel. Next, the detailed analysis of the ceramic sherds was
based on differences in temper, type of sherd (i.e., rim, body, or base), rim and lip form (cf.
Brown 1996: Figure 2-12), decoration (if present, including the identification of motifs and
elements), surface treatment (smoothing, burnishing, or polishing; see Rice 1987), and firing
conditions (cf. Teltser 1993). Sherd cross-sections were inspected macroscopically and with a
10X hand lens to determine the character of the paste and its inclusions. Determining the firing
conditions was based on the identification of the firing core in the sherd cross-sections and the
identification of oxidation patterns as defined in Teltser (1993:535-536 and Figure 2a-h).
Attributes employed in the analysis of Caddo ceramic sherds included: (a) temper, the deliberate
and indeterminate materials found in the paste (Rice 1987:411), including a variety of tempers
(grog or crushed sherds, burned bone, etc.); (b) observations on ceramic sherd cross-sections
permitted consideration of oxidation patterns (Teltser 1993:Figure 2), namely the conditions
under which a vessel was fired and then cooled after firing; and (c) finally, wall thickness was
recorded in millimeters (mm), using a vernier caliper, along the mid-section of the sherd.
With respect to interior and exterior surface treatment on the Bowie County sherds, the primary
methods of finishing the sherds on Woodland and Caddo sites in East Texas are smoothing, and
burnishing; polishing of vessel surfaces is rare. Smoothing creates “a finer and more regular
surface…[and] has a matte rather than a lustrous surface” (Rice 1987:138). Burnishing creates
an irregular lustrous finish marked by parallel facets left by the burnishing tool (perhaps a
smoothed pebble or bone).

Analysis of Prehistoric Ceramic Sherds

41BW777 Ceramic Sherds
The sample of sherds from 41BW777 consists of two body sherds. One body sherd each from
ST 16D-1, 20-40 cm and 40-60 cm bs can be conjoined, and are counted as one sherd, while a
second sherd is from ST 16D-1, 20-40 cm bs (Table 1).

The two plain sherds are from two different vessels, one tempered with grog and the other
tempered with grog and burned bone. The body wall thickness of the two sherds (ranging from
7.3-8.2 mm) suggests they are from moderately thick-walled jars, as does the absence of any
form of surface treatment. One sherd is from a vessel that was incompletely oxidized during
firing (see Teltser 1993:Figure 2e), while the second sherd is from a vessel that was fired in a
reducing or low oxygen environment, but cooled in the open air (see Teltser 1993:Figure 2g).
This method of firing left a thin oxidized lens along one side of the vessel core.
41BW779 Ceramic Sherds
There are also two plain sherds from 41BW779. These are a body sherd (comprised of three
conjoined sherds from 40-60 and 60-80 cm bs in ST 22E-2) and a body-base sherd (Table 2),
both from one shovel test.

The conjoined body sherds are from a grog-tempered vessel that was fired in a reducing
environment, but then pulled from the fire to cool in the open air (see Teltser 1993:Figure 2g).
Body wall thickness ranges 6.5–6.7 mm. The body-base sherd is from a second vessel, one
tempered with grog, burned bone, and crushed pieces of hematite. This vessel has moderately
thick vessel walls (7.2 mm) and a thick (13.5 mm) flat base. This vessel was also fired in a
reducing environment and cooled in the open air.
Summary and Conclusions
A total of four plain sherds have been recovered at 41BW777 and 41BW779. They are from
four separate vessels tempered with grog, bone, and/or hematite. Three of the four vessels
represented in the sherds were fired in a reducing environment, then cooled in the open air; this
is a common method of firing vessels used by prehistoric Caddo potters in East Texas (Perttula
2010). Vessel walls range 6.5–8.2 mm in thickness, and combined with the absence of any
form of surface treatment, this is consistent with the sherds being from plain jars and bowls
or the undecorated portions of utility ware jars. The one thick base sherd (13.5 mm) from
41BW779 is likely from a durable and substantial vessel, likely a large jar.
The few plain sherds from the two Bowie County sites provide few clues as to their age.
For several reasons, it seems probable that the sherds are from post-A.D. 800–850 Caddo
occupations at the sites rather than being Woodland (ca. 550 B.C.-ca. A.D. 800–850) period
in age because of : (1) moderately thick vessel walls in the body sherds, unlike Williams
Plain, the principal Woodland period ceramic type in the lower Sulphur River basin that has
thick body walls and very thick bases (see Schambach 1982, 1998); (2) the base sherd from
41BW779 is not from a Woodland period flowerpot-shaped jar with a square and stilt base, but
a jar with a circular and flat Caddo-style base form; and (3) the firing methods detected in the
sherds from the different vessels is consistent with a prehistoric Caddo focus on reduced or low
oxygen firing by potters.

Discussion of Site
41BW775 is a prehistoric site of undetermined age measuring 20 x 20 m. It is on a low mound on the side slope of
a peninsula leading into Wright Patman Lake. The mound is about 239 ft amsl (72.8 m amsl). The site has
moderate tree cover, little secondary growth and some deadfall. The overstory is sweetgum and oak while the
understory is Carolina Buckthorn. Soils within the site are Sawyer silt loam. Surface visibility is near zero percent
due to leaf litter.
In addition to pedestrian survey, ten shovel tests were excavated to assess the nature of cultural resource deposition
and assist in delineating site boundaries. Three of the shovel tests were excavated on the same small mound, two
of which were positive, two more were excavated on nearby mounds but returned nothing. In total only two of the
ten shovel tests were positive, for a ubiquity measure of 25 percent, yielding four lithic flakes and two pieces of
lithic shatter between 20 and 80 cmbs. No other artifacts were recovered.

Discussion of Site
FS271 is a prehistoric site of undetermined age measuring 20 x 20 m. It is on a low mound on the side slope of a
peninsula leading into Wright Patman Lake. The mound is about 231 ft amsl (70.4 m amsl). The site has
moderate tree cover, and little secondary growth. The overstory is sweetgum and oak while the understory is vines
and poison ivy. Soils within the site are Sawyer silt loam. Surface visibility is near zero percent due to leaf litter.
In addition to pedestrian survey, six shovel tests were excavated to assess the nature of cultural resource deposition
and assist in delineating site boundaries. Two of the shovel tests were excavated on the same low mound, both
positive; three more were excavated on upslope from the mound and two down slope. In total only two of the six
shovel tests were positive, for a ubiquity measure of 33 percent, yielding three lithic flakes between 20 and 80
cmbs. No other artifacts were recovered.

Discussion of Site
FS272 is a prehistoric site of (as yet, waiting on ceramic analysis) undetermined age measuring 20 x 20 m. It is on
a mound on a slope leading into Wright Patman Lake. The mound is about 238 ft amsl (72.5 m amsl). The site
has moderate tree cover, and little secondary growth. The overstory is pine, oak, and sweetgum while the
understory is vines and Carolina Buckthorn. Soils within the site are Woodtell very fine sandy loam. Surface
visibility is near zero percent due to leaf litter.
In addition to pedestrian survey, nine shovel tests were excavated to assess the nature of cultural resource
deposition and assist in delineating site boundaries. Five of the shovel tests were excavated on the same low
mound, with only one positive; two more were excavated on upslope from the mound and two down slope. In total
only one of the nine shovel tests was positive, for a ubiquity measure of 11 percent, yielding one lithic flake and
three prehistoric ceramic sherds between 20 and 60 cmbs. No other artifacts were recovered.

peninsula leading into Wright Patman Lake. The site is about 240 ft amsl (73.2 m amsl). The site has moderate
tree cover, and little secondary growth. The overstory is pine and oak while the understory is sweetgum and
Carolina buckthorn. Soils within the site are Woodtell very fine sandy loam. Surface visibility is near zero percent
due to leaf litter.
In addition to pedestrian survey, ten shovel tests were excavated to assess the nature of cultural resource deposition
and assist in delineating site boundaries. Seven of the shovel tests were excavated on the same small mound, two
of which were positive; three more were excavated other nearby, with two of those on mounds. In total only two of
the ten shovel tests were positive, for a ubiquity measure of 25 percent, yielding six lithic flakes between and one

Discussion of Site
FS274 is a prehistoric site of (as yet, waiting on ceramic analysis) undetermined age measuring 20 x 20 m. It is on
a mound on a terrace over Wright Patman Lake. The mound is about 253 ft amsl (77.1 m amsl). The site has
moderate tree cover, and little secondary growth. The overstory is pine, and oak, while the understory is sweetgum
and other small trees. Soils within the site are Adaton-Muskogee complex with sandy loam texture. Surface
visibility is near zero percent due to leaf litter.
In addition to pedestrian survey, nine shovel tests were excavated to assess the nature of cultural resource
deposition and assist in delineating site boundaries. Two of the shovel tests were excavated on the same mound,
with only one positive; the other seven tests were each excavated on an adjacent mound. In total only one of the
nine shovel tests was positive, for a ubiquity measure of 11 percent, yielding three prehistoric ceramic sherds
between 40 and 60 cmbs. No other artifacts were recovered.
