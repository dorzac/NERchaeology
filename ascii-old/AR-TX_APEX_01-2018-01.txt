ABSTRACT
ONE Gas, Inc./Texas Gas Service (One Gas) is proposing to construct and operate the
approximate SH 130 5.2-mile natural gas pipeline along the east side of State Highway 130 (SH
130) in the north, the west side of SH 130 in the south, the south side of Moore Road, and the
east side of Blocker Lane in Travis County, Texas. This proposed Project may require permitting
through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (Section
404). In the Desktop Review, Apex biologists identified four potential waters of the United States
as part of One Gas’ compliance with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. However, all four
crossings will be avoided via boring.
Most of the proposed Project is located on Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) right-ofway (ROW) and will be regulated under the Antiquities Code of Texas (TAC). The Texas Historical
Commission (THC) reviewed the scope-of-work and assigned TAC Permit No. 8984 to the
portions of SH 130 5.2-mile natural gas pipeline project that are adjacent to known cultural
resource sites with undetermined boundaries or areas that had not been previously surveyed,
hereafter referred to as the Area of Potential Effect (APE) for the cultural resources investigation
(Apex Project No. 453242). Locational data of the proposed Project is presented in Attachment
A, Figures 1 and 2 on aerial and topographic maps, respectively. See Attachment A, Figure 3
for the survey boundaries (APE), previously recorded sites, and shovel tests locations.
Between January 23 - 24, 2017, Apex Companies, LLC (Apex), at the request of One Gas,
conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the APE. A cultural and environmental
literature review was followed by the cultural resources survey to identify archeological and
historical resources within the APE. The survey methodology followed the Survey Standards of
Texas developed by the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) and THC. Moderate to significant
impacts associated with agricultural practices, animal burrows, and surface erosion were
observed within and adjacent to the APE. Erosional features were walked in an attempt to identify
cultural resources. Shovel tests were excavated in areas lacking subsurface exposure due to
previous clearing, erosion, and/or burrow mounds. All were negative for cultural materials.
The pedestrian survey and shovel testing in the areas adjacent to sites 41TV2162 and 41TV2166
and the areas that had not been previously surveyed were negative for cultural resources.
However, the investigation resulted in the extension of site boundaries at two prehistoric sites
(41TV150 and 41TV2163). Although both sites had been previously determined ineligible for
inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or listing as State Antiquities
Landmarks (SAL), it was established that the sites likely extended beyond their original
boundaries.
Site 41TV150 is a prehistoric and historic multicomponent site located on a level to sharply sloping
surface and the top of a small hill; it measures approximately 20-acres. The boundary of the
prehistoric component, a quarry site, has been extended approximately 872 feet to the north and
likely extends beyond the proposed Project to the north. Site 41TV2163 was documented as a
prehistoric lithic scatter located on the western slopes of a large hilltop to the east; the boundary
of this small site has been extended approximately 276 feet to the south and 385 feet to the north.
Both sites consist of quarry materials of mainly raw chert cobbles with a small percentage of
cobbles broken in half or showing one flake scar. A few primary flakes were observed, along with

one large biface blank and one worked chunk of glass. Shovel tests were not conducted at these
two sites as exposures were available within the erosional gullies and animal burrow mounds.
Due to the surficial nature and lack of features or diagnostic cultural material, the extended
boundaries of sites 41TV150 and 41TV2166 are recommended as ineligible for listing as SALs or
inclusion in the NRHP. Apex recommends that the proposed Project proceed without further
cultural resources investigation as the proposed Project would have no effect on cultural
resources with the potential for listing as SALs or inclusion in the NRHP.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

PROJECT TITLE: Cultural Resources Survey, One Gas, Inc’s Proposed SH 130 5.2-mile Natural
Gas Pipeline, Travis County, Texas.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: On behalf of One Gas, Apex conducted a cultural resources
pedestrian survey of the APE within Travis County, Texas (Apex Project No. 453242). The
pedestrian survey of the APE consisted of a 50-foot wide corridor plus a 25-foot buffer on each
side of the corridor for cultural resources.
PROJECT LOCATION: The proposed Project is located along the east side of State Highway
130 (SH 130) in the north, the west side of SH 130 in the south, the south side of Moore Road,
and the east side of Blocker Lane in Travis County, Texas. It is located southeast of the city of
Austin with the northern terminus of the proposed Project located just southeast of the intersection
of SH 130 and Pearce Lane. The southern terminus is located approximately 0.29 mile south of
the intersection of Moore Road and Blocker Lane.
DATE OF FIELD WORK: January 23 – 24, 2018
PURPOSE OF WORK: Apex assisted One Gas in their due diligence under the TAC and NRHP.
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Debra L. Beene
TEXAS ANTIQUITIES PERMIT: TAC No. 8284
NEWLY RECORDED SITE: Site boundaries at existing sites 41TV150 and 41TV2162 have been
extended.
PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES: 41TV150, 41TV2162, 41TV2163, and 41TV2166
COMMENTS: The cultural resources investigation resulted in the expansion of site boundaries at
41TV150 and 41TV2162. Both are prehistoric quarry sites consisting of expanses of raw chert
cobbles with a small percentage of cobbles broken in half or showing one flake scar. A few primary
flakes were observed, along with one large biface blank and one worked chunk of glass.
.
Due to the surficial nature and lack of features or diagnostic cultural material, sites 41TV150 and
41TV2166 are recommended as ineligible for listing as SAL or inclusion in the NRHP. Apex
recommends that the proposed Project proceed without further cultural resources investigation
as the proposed Project would have no effect on historic properties.

INTRODUCTION

One Gas is proposing to construct and operate an approximately 5.2-mile SH 130 Natural Gas
Pipeline. Locational maps of the proposed Project are provided in Appendix A, Figures 1 and 2,
on aerial imagery and topographic maps, respectively. Survey boundaries, site areas, and shovel
tests locations are provided in Appendix A, Figure 3. Site details at 41TV150 and 41TV2163 are
provided in Appendix A, Figure 4.
The APE for the cultural resources survey consists of the portion of the proposed Project adjacent
to known cultural resource sites with undetermined boundaries or that had not been previously
surveyed, measuring approximately 1.30 miles (Apex Project No. 453242). The northern terminus
of the APE occurs approximately 137 feet east of the intersection of the SH 130 northbound
access road and Pearce Lane and the southern terminus is located on Blocker Lane
approximately 0.29 mile south of the intersection of Blocker Lane and Moore Road. The proposed
Project extends south along the east side of SH 130 from Pearce Road for approximately 4.1
miles where it crosses to the west side of SH 130 and continues south for approximately 0.50
mile. It crosses Moore Road and continues west on the south side of Moore Road for
approximately 0.42 mile to Blocker Lane and continues south on the east side of Blocker Lane for
approximately 0.29 miles.
The pedestrian survey of the APE consisted of a 50-foot wide corridor plus a 25-foot buffer on
each side of the corridor for the cultural resources investigation.
This proposed Project may require permitting through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (Section 404); however, there will be no impacts to potential
waters of the United States. In a Desktop Review, Apex biologist identified four potential waters
of the United States; however, all four crossings will be avoided via boring the draw.
The proposed Project is located on Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) ROW and is
regulated under the Antiquities Code of Texas (TAC). The Texas Historical Commission (THC)
reviewed the scope-of-work and assigned TAC Permit No. 8984 to the investigation of the APE,
described as portions of the SH 130 5.2-mile natural gas pipeline project that are located adjacent
to known cultural resource sites with undetermined boundaries or located in areas that have not
been previously surveyed. See Attachment A, Figure 3 for the survey boundaries, previously
recorded sites, and shovel tests locations.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The proposed Project is in southeastern Travis County southeast of the city of Austin, Texas; it is
located within the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau Section of the Gulf Coastal Plains
Physiographic Province and bordered by the Balcones Escarpment to the east. It lies in the
Blackland Prairie ecological region characterized by tall grasses. Hydrology, topography,
vegetation, and soils within the proposed Project are detailed below.
3.1 Hydrology
The proposed Project is located in the Carson Creek-Colorado River (120902050409) and Red
Gully Creek-Dry Creek (120903010109) subwatersheds, which are located within the larger (HUC
8) Austin-Travis Lakes (12090205) and Lower Colorado-Cummins (12090301) watersheds (EPA
2017). Aerial imagery, United States Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps, USGS
National Hydrography Data (NHD), and the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) database indicate
that there are four USGS blue-lines, one isolated USGS pond, and one area of ponded water
depicted in aerial imagery intersected by the proposed Project. Two of the USGS blue-line
tributaries are associated with NWI freshwater emergent wetlands. There are no NWI freshwater
forested/shrub wetlands or ponds intersected by the proposed Project.
3.2 Topography
Elevation of the proposed Project ranges from 452 feet above mean sea level (msl) at the northern
terminus to 580 feet above msl approximately 0.2 mile north of the proposed Project’s intersection
with Moore Road. The topography of the proposed Project gently increases in elevation moving
from the north to the south (Attachment A, Figure 2).
3.3 Vegetation
The proposed Project is located within the Crops (44) vegetation type according to McMahan et
al. (1984). This vegetation type consists of cultivated cover crops or row crops that provide food
and/or fiber for man or domestic animals. This type may also portray grassland associated with
crop rotation. Review of aerial imagery indicates the vegetation intersected by the proposed
Project was primarily agricultural fields or rangeland prior to the construction of SH 130 and is
now disturbed roadside, herbaceous communities.
3.4 Soils
Six soil units are intersected by the proposed Project alignment. Table 1 lists the soil units within
the 50-foot corridor along the proposed Project (NRCS 2016).

CULTURAL HISTORY AND PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

The traditional cultural sequence of central Texas includes the Paleoindian period (11,500 to 8800
BP) followed by the Early (8800 to 6000 BP), Middle (6000 to 4000 BP), and Late (4000 to 1300
or 1200 BP) Archaic periods; the latter Late Prehistoric period (approximately 1200 to around 250
BP) is followed by the Historic period (250 BP into the mid-to late 19th century) (Collins 2004).
These temporal divisions are reflected in changes in technologies and subsistence adaptations.
Archeological site types range from lithic scatters and isolated heaths to open camps, burned rock
middens, hearth fields, lithic procurement/quarries, rockshelters and cemeteries. Within the
general area of the proposed Project, most of the prehistoric sites are open camps situated on
alluvial terraces near streams or rivers. The cultural assemblages may include fire cracked rock
(FCR), lithic debitage, lithic tools (hammerstones, unifaces, bifaces, diagnostic projectile points),
ground stones, and ceramic sherds. Historic site types range from Mexican period ranchos, early
Anglo farmsteads and settlements to the Camino Real de los Tejas, a network of roads linking
outposts and supply towns. Most of the historic sites, within the general area of the proposed
Project, are homesteads and tenant farms dating to the late 19th century.
A preliminary review of the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
Database (ATLAS) was conducted to assess known cultural resources and previous surveys
conducted within a 1.0-mile radius study area (0.5 mile in each direction of the proposed Project).
Nineteen archaeological sites have been recorded and segments of twelve previous cultural
resource surveys are located within the study area (ATLAS 2018); these are presented below.
Previous cultural resource surveys:
An area survey for the Moore’s Crossing Municipal Utility District was conducted by Alton Briggs
in 1988 under TAC permit number 707 (ATLAS 2018). Sites 41TV1399, 41TV1400, and
41TV1401 are located within the boundaries of this survey as well as the boundary for a 2001
survey for the Federal Housing Administration by PBS&J in 2001 (ATLAS 2018). Both surveys
overlap the proposed Project; see site discussions below.
A small linear survey for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) was conducted by
TAS, Inc. for the Longhorn Pipeline project (unknown date); no sites were recorded, and no further
investigations were warranted (ATLAS 2018). The survey boundary crossed perpendicular to the
proposed Project north of Mc Angus Road.
A small linear survey for TxDOT was conducted in 2006 by Hicks and Company under TAC permit
number 3001. Site 41TV2000 was recorded during this survey north of Mc Angus Road and west
of SH 130 (ATLAS 2018). It is discussed below.
A linear survey conducted for the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) was reported to
the Texas Historical Commission (THC) in 2005 under Texas Antiquities Code (TAC) permit
number 3001 (ATLAS 2018). The survey of 145 parcels were investigated within ‘Additional
Properties’ of the SH 130 ROW. The survey boundary overlaps the northern extent of the
proposed Project; site 41TV540 was recorded at the northern edge of the proposed Project. This
site is discussed below.
A survey conducted in 1993 includes the proposed Project from Linda Vista Drive extending north
beyond Pearce Lane. There is no data regarding the survey on the ATLAS; however, nine sites

ONE Gas, Inc.

have been recorded within its boundary, including site 41TV540 (ATLAS 2018). Cultural resource
sites 41TV541, 41TV2160,41TV1399, 41TV1400, and 41TV1401, 41TV2160, 41TV2161,
41TV2162, and 41TV2349 are located within or overlapping the survey boundaries. These sites
are discussed below.
A small linear survey for TxDOT was conducted in 2006 by Hicks and Company under TAC permit
number 3001 (ATLAS 2018). Site 41TV2000 was recorded during this survey north of Mc Angus
Road and west of SH 130; it is discussed below.
A small survey for the Federal Housing Administration was conducted in 2001 by PBS&J under
TAC permit number 2692 (ATLAS 2018). It is located approximately 850 feet east of the proposed
Project on the opposite side of SH 130.
Another small survey for the Federal Housing Administration was conducted in 2001 by PBS&J
under TAC permit number 2692 (ATLAS 2018). It is located south of the proposed Project along
SH 130. Portions of site 41TV150 were recorded during this survey; it is discussed below.
A southern segment of a SH130 TxDOT survey, conducted under TAC permit number 3001 by
Hicks and Company, overlaps the proposed Project south of Mc Angus Road and north of Moore
Road (ATLAS 2018). Sites 41TV2166, 41TV2170, and 41TV2071 were recorded during this
survey; the sites are discussed below.
A large area survey was conducted under TAC permit number 1306 and overlaps the proposed
Project from Farm to Market (FM) 812 to north of Moore Road. It includes sites 41TV2163,
41TV2164, 41TV2165, and 41TV2166 (ATLAS 2018); these sites are discussed below.
The survey of the southern segment of the SH 130 was conducted in 2006 by Hicks and Company
under TAC permit number 3001 (Campbell et al. 2007). It is located within the SH 130 ROW along
Moore Road and overlaps a portion of the proposed Project. Site 41TV150 is located within a
large area of the proposed Project; it is discussed below.
Previously recorded cultural sites:
41TV150, a prehistoric and historic multicomponent site, is located on a level to sharply sloping
top of a small hill; the approximately 20-acre site was in pasture at the time of its documentation
and some of the area was terraced and may have been cultivated in the past (ATLAS 2018). It
was originally recorded as a probable prehistoric quarry site in 1968 and consisted of very crude
dart points, gouge like tools, blades, a few bifaces that may be choppers or heavy blades, and
several heavy, very large bifacially worked implements (ATLAS 2018). It was revisited in 2001
and expanded to include a historic stable, deteriorating house, and some lithic debitage; further
testing was recommended (ATLAS 2018). A 2002 investigation of the area north of Moore Road
resulted in the documentation of lithic debitage, and 5 historic agricultural wooden buildings with
corrugated metal roofs. Heavily deteriorated farm equipment debris filled the interior of the
buildings. Rogers and Russell (2008) noted that 70 negative shovel tests were excavated in this
area and the buildings were not considered significant and no further investigations were
recommended. The site was further defined in 2003; it includes the prehistoric lithic scatter,
historic structures, and remnants of a historic cemetery (ATLAS 2018). The Moore Road
Cemetery at 41TV150, located on a small ridge nose in the southeast corner of the site, north of
Moore Road and east of SH 130, was defined by backhoe trenching of the suspected cemetery

area. The remains of a wooden coffin and limited removal of a small segment of the coffin/casket
exposed the partial remains of one individual at 140 centimeters below surface (cmbs); it was
photographed and recorded in situ. Additional grave sites may be located in the nearby area but
outside of the 2003 ROW per Rogers and Russell (2008). The site was revisited by Hicks and
Company in 2007 under TAC permit number 3001; backhoe trench scraping was carried out to
identify potential graves in a project area located along Moore Road, east of SH 130, extending
to the south (Campbell et al. 2007). No graves or structural remains were identified within the
2007 ROW, it had been severely affected by agricultural turbation, and has a low probability for
intact buried cultural material. The prehistoric and historic components within the previous
surveyed areas were determined NRHP ineligible by the Texas SHPO (ATLAS 2018). A segment
of the current Project is located north of the surveyed area and further investigations were
warranted to determine whether site 41TV150 extends to the north.
41TV540 is a very large prehistoric open camp on an old terrace of Onion Creek. South of Pearce
Lane, the assemblage consists of primarily quarry debris: cores, quarry blanks, large flakes, and
tested cobbles (ATLAS 2018). The portions investigated as part of the SH 130 project contained
very few artifacts, no features, and did not contain significant deposits to warrant inclusion in the
NRHP or listing as a SAL; this includes the proposed Project which slightly overlaps a few feet of
the site within the SH 130 ROW.
41TV541, a prehistoric quarry/workshop with lithic debitage and unmodified and tested chert
cobbles, is located on the toe slope of an upland ridge extending into the Onion Creek floodplain.
It was investigated in 1981 by David Brown and again in 2003 by PBS&J under TAC permit
number 2692. In 2005, it was revisited by Hicks and Company under TAC permit number 3001
and determined NRHP ineligible within the SH 130 ROW (ATLAS 2018). It is located
approximately 662 feet west of the proposed Project on the opposite side of SH 130 and no further
investigations are warranted.
41TV1399, the historic Engler Murder House site, is located in the middle of SH 130 and has been
destroyed. It was investigated by Hicks and Company in 2007 under TAC permit number 3001
(ATLAS 2018). The site location is approximately 365 feet west of the proposed Project in the
middle of SH 130 and no further investigations are warranted.
41TV1400, a prehistoric open campsite and historic cistern, is located on the slope of a large
ridge overlooking Onion Creek to the north. It was investigated by PBS&J in 2002 and determined
NRHP ineligible by the Texas SHPO (ATLAS 2018). It is located approximately 657 feet west of
the proposed Project on the opposite side of SH 130 and no further investigations are warranted.
41TV1401, an upland prehistoric lithic scatter and possible open camp, is located on a prominent
ridge top southeast of Onion Creek. It was investigated by PBS&J for the Texas Turnpike Authority
in 2002 under TAC permit number 2693 (ATLAS 2018). The site location is approximately 816
feet west of the proposed Project on the opposite side of SH 130 and no further investigations are
warranted.
41TV2000, a historic artifact scatter, is located on a broad upland terrace overlooking an
intermittent drain. It was recorded by Hicks and Company under TAC permit number 3001 in
2007. The site was determined NRHP ineligible by TxSHPO in 2007 (ATLAS 2018). It is located

ONE Gas, Inc.
Proposed 5.2-mile SH 130 Natural Gas Pipeline

Page 7

approximately 805 feet west of the proposed Project on the opposite side of SH 130 and no further
investigations are warranted.
41TV2160, a historic scatter located on the edge of a hilltop overlooking Onion Creek to the
northwest, was determined NRHP ineligible by the Texas SHPO (ATLAS 2018). A small portion
of the site is located within the proposed Project and has been determined ineligible.
41TV2161, a prehistoric Archaic period open camp was determined NRHP eligible and subjected
to data recovery/mitigation. A sample of the site was investigated under TAC permit number 4064
prior to its destruction by the planned construction of SH 130 (ATLAS 2018). TRC Environmental
Corporation’s (TRC) conducted geoarchaeological documentation and data recovery excavations
in 2016. The investigations were restricted to a 70 centimeter (cm) thick target zone between 220
and 290 cm below surface (bs) on the western side of site. The site has been fully mitigated
within the proposed Project (ATLAS 2018).
41TV2162, a prehistoric Archaic period campsite, quarry, workshop, and burned rock midden,
was investigated in 2005 under TAC permit number 3001; it was later tested in 2006 under TAC
permit number 4082 by Hicks and Company for TxDOT (ATLAS 2018). It was subjected to shovel
testing followed by backhoe trenching and controlled test units/feature focused-excavation within
the SH 130 ROW; this portion of the site was determined NRHP ineligible. However, the site
extends east, beyond the edge of the SH 130 ROW, and the Texas SHPO states that this portion
of the site warrants further investigation prior to any future ground disturbing activities (ATLAS
2018). Although the site is not described as extending south into the proposed Project, the area
may require an assessment to confirm the status within the APE.
Sites 41TV2163 (prehistoric lithic scatter), 41TV2164 (a large prehistoric and historic scatter),
41TV2165 (prehistoric lithic scatter), and 41TV2166 (a prehistoric lithic scatter) were recorded
within a large aerial survey; all four were determined NRHP ineligible; however, their full
boundaries are not known, and further work may be warranted (ATLAS 2018). Sites 41TV2164
and 41TV2165 are located on the opposite side of SH 130 of the proposed Project and would not
be impacted; no further work would be necessary. However, sites 41TV2163 and 41TV2166 are
located within the proposed Project and would require further investigations to determine if they
extend into the current project area.
41TV2167, prehistoric lithic procurement area and lithic scatter, is located east of SH 130. It has
been SHPO determined NRHP ineligible; however, its NE/SW site boundaries are not known, and
further work may be warranted (ATLAS 2018). However, the site is located east of the proposed
Project on the opposite side of SH 130 and would not be impacted; no further work would be
necessary.
41TV2168, a small prehistoric lithic scatter, is located on a gently sloping, gravelly hillside; it has
been SHPO determined NRHP ineligible (ATLAS 2018). The proposed Project parallels the edge
of the site; however, its full boundary was well defined and determined ineligible; no further
investigations are warranted.
41TV2170, a small prehistoric lithic scatter, has been SHPO determined NRHP ineligible (ATLAS
2018). The small corner of the site located in the proposed Project has been determined ineligible
and does not require any further investigations.

41TV2171, a sparse prehistoric lithic scatter located on the side of a gradual slope, has been
SHPO determined NRHP ineligible (ATLAS 2018). The proposed Project parallels the edge of
this site; however, its full boundary was well defined and determined NRHP ineligible; no further
investigations are warranted.
41TV2349, a widely scattered prehistoric lithic scatter and historic trash scatter, was recorded by
the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) under TAC permit number 5073 in 2009 (ATLAS
2018). It is located adjacent to and just south of SH 130 in a combination of old pasture and
cultivated land. This a very large site and fills the entire 1-kilometer width of the Onion Creek
floodplain which at this location fills the inside meander of an upland ridge system that rises about
50 feet above the valley floor (ATLAS 2018). The assemblage includes lithic flakes, cores, few
tools, historic ceramics, glass, and bricks. However, items were observed only occassionally
across the surface without any patterning. The portion of the site located in the SH 130 ROW and
the electric transmission line has been SHPO determined NRHP ineligible; this includes the
proposed Project and no further investigations are warranted.
Four sites (41TV150, 41TV2162, 41TV2163, and 41TV2166), located adjacent to or within the
proposed Project, warrant further investigation to determine whether they extend beyond their
known boundaries into the proposed Project. As well, areas not previously surveyed required
further investigations; this includes approximately 1.30 mile of the proposed Project which is in an
area considered to have a moderate to high probability of containing cultural resources.

METHODOLOGY

Because the survey area is located on State Public Land, TxDOT, a TAC permit was acquired
prior to the cultural resources survey. TAC permit number 8284 was assigned to the Principle
Investigator on January 10, 2018.
Prior to the survey, the THC’s restricted use ATLAS database (ATLAS 2018) and the Texas State
Library and Archives Commission’s (TSL 2016) historical county maps for Travis county were
reviewed to identify significant cultural resources within the 0.5-mile study area of the proposed
Project.
The survey was conducted by the Principal Investigator, who meets the U.S. Secretary of the
Interior’s Professional Qualification Standards for Archeology (NPS 1983) and the requirements
for Principal Investigator defined in Title 13, Part II of the Texas Administrative Code, Chapter 26;
and one cultural resources field technician. The intensive pedestrian survey of the proposed
Project met the Archeological Survey Standards for Texas (THC n.d.). The pedestrian survey was
conducted in 15-foot (4.6 meter) transect intervals and was augmented with judgmental shovel
testing to a minimum of 2 feet to 3.3 feet (60 cm to one meter) in depth or as restricted by bedrock.
The shovel tests were to be used to assess the subsurface for cultural deposits and extensive
distributions of surficial cultural materials defined the extended boundaries of known archeological
sites. Shovel test soil descriptions, along with Munsell color designations, were collected for
shovel tests that varied from their predecessor. Existing ground disturbances associated with
agricultural practices, mechanical clearing, fence lines and fire breaks, animal burrows, and
surface erosion were examined within and adjacent to the APE in lieu of shovel testing, allowing
for larger exposures than those provided by shovel tests. The locations of archeological sites, and
shovel tests were entered into the GPS unit. New boundaries for two archeological sites were
recorded utilizing the TexSite Archeological Data Collection Software (TexSite), a product of the
THC.
The purpose of the investigation was to identify cultural resources within the proposed Project
and make recommendations about their significance. The extended boundaries of two existing
sites were defined by the distribution of the surface artifacts. The artifacts observed during the
survey were recorded and analyzed in the field. The results of the analysis were used to support
the overall and site-specific recommendations in the technical report. The draft technical report
meets the Council of Texas Archeologists Guidelines for Cultural Resource Management Reports
(CTA 1987). The report describes the natural and cultural history of the project area, discusses
the methodology and results of the survey, and concludes with recommendations about site
eligibility and whether further archeological work should be conducted in the project area.
The project records will be curated at a Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) per
THC requirements. The draft report will be submitted to the THC for review and comments; copy
to be provided to the client and TxDOT as requested. Once approved, the final report completion
requirements of the THC will be met; this will include curation of records at TARL. The curation
form from the certified curatorial facility will be forwarded to the THC. One hard copy of the final
report will be submitted to TxDOT and the client, as requested. One hard copy report will be
furnished to the THC and one to the Texas State Library and Archives Commission. Two tagged
formatted PDF electronic copies on CD, along with the Abstracts in Texas Contract Archeology

RESULTS

The APE included four segments of the proposed Project that had not been previously surveyed,
and areas adjacent to four prehistoric cultural sites that may extend beyond their original
boundaries, measuring approximately 1.30 mile in length. The sites, 41TV150, 41TV2162,
41TV2163, and 41TV2166, were determined as ineligible for listing as SALs or inclusion in the
NRHP; however, this determination was made for the portion of each site within previous survey
boundaries which did not include some areas of the proposed Project. Information from the
previous site forms suggested that the site boundaries likely extend beyond their recorded
boundaries.
Additional sites in or near the proposed Project did not warrant further investigation as they were
either determined NRHP ineligible, had been fully mitigated, or are located a sufficient distance
from the proposed Project. These are discussed in Chapter 4.0, Cultural History and Previous
Investigations.
The APE was subjected to a systematic pedestrian survey supplemented with shovel testing, as
needed. Based on field observations, the proposed Project was significantly impacted by highway
construction, electric utility corridor construction, past pasture and agricultural practices; clearing
and blading; animal burrows; fence lines; sheet wash; and minor erosional gullies. The abovelisted erosional exposures, measuring between two and three feet in depth in many places, were
walked in an attempt to identify cultural resources. Some of the APE has been partially cleared
and modified and was determined to have low probability for intact cultural resources. However,
when natural cobbles and occasional artifacts were observed, the surrounding area was
systematically surveyed along with shovel testing and/or investigation of existing subsurface
exposures, as described above. See Table 2 for shovel test data, Appendix A, Figure 3 for
survey boundaries, existing site areas, and shovel test locations, and Appendix B for
photographs of the shovel tests locations and sites 41TV150 and 41TV2163 within their expanded
boundaries.
The four previously unsurveyed areas within the APE were investigated prior to the site revisits;
these survey boundaries are plotted in blue on Appendix A, Figure 3. The boundary includes
approximately 1.30 mile of the pipeline route consisting of the east side of Blocker Lane (from
Moore Road approximately 0.29 mile to the south), the south side of Moore Road (from Blocker
Lane approximately 0.31 mile to the east), the western side of SH 130 immediately north of site
41TV150 (approximately 0.27 mile including the crossing of SH 130 to the east), and the eastern
side of SH 130 (from McAngus Road north approximately 0.43 mile).
The survey was initiated at the southern terminus of the APE along the east side of Blocker Lane;
the southern 2/3rds of the Blocker Lane ROW had been bulldozed and developed in association
with adjacent commercial properties. One small area along this ROW is vegetated and one
negative shovel test (ST 1) was excavated in this area. Immediately to the north at the intersection
of Blocker Lane and Moore Road, an abandoned modern residence consists of a house,
asphalted driveways, fences, parking lots, modern debris (plastics, insulation, wooden posts,
stacks of wooden fence segments, metal, degraded animal pens, toys, and car parts). One
negative shovel test (ST 2) was excavated at the edge of the yard within the Blocker Road ROW.
Another negative shovel test (ST 3) was excavated near the northeastern boundary of the
residential property along the south side of Moore Road. A negative shovel test (ST 4) was placed
east of the residence and west of large commercial developments that extend between 245 feet

and 0.34 mile east of the SH 130 ROW. The ROW in the area of these developments consists of
drainage ditches along the southern edge of Moore Road and was not shovel tested. See
associated photographs in Appendix B (B-1 through B-6).
We surveyed the APE west of SH 130 and discovered that it is one large prehistoric quarry site,
an extension of site 41TV150. We decided to move to the next survey area with plans to return
the following day to document the revised boundary of site 41TV150. We moved to the
northernmost survey segment starting at McAngus Road and surveyed north approximately 0.43
mile. Four negative shovel tests (STs 5-8) were excavated along this segment between the
upward steep slopes to SH 130 and associated drainage ditches to the west and an electrical
transmission line to the east. A few natural chert cobbles and gravels were noted on the surface;
several animal burrow mounds and erosional slopes were investigated along with the shovel tests.
The area was negative for cultural resources. See associated photographs in Appendix B (B-7
through B-10).
The following day, we began our survey in the area of the known sites with the potential to extend
into our APE (41TV150, 41TV2162, 41TV2163, and 41TV2166). We began immediately south of
site 41TV2162, located north of Elroy Road. Site 41TV2162 was described as a multicomponent
historic and prehistoric site including historic household debris on the hilltop with a dumpsite on
the northwest slope. Prehistoric lithic debitage was found across the entire site with deeply buried
occupational deposits in the floodplain (Campbell et al. 2007). The cultural assemblage included
lithic debitage, fire cracked rock, hammerstone, mano, bifaces, ceramic, glass, wire nail, metal
fragments. The site landscape was described as extending northwest from Elroy Road
approximately 350 meters, across the hilltop and down into the Onion Creek floodplain to the west
and northwest. The site was determined ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP or listing as an SAL
in 2006 and 2007; but was thought to extend east of the ROW and therefore outside of our APE.
However, the site boundary looked suspicious as it abruptly ended at Elroy Road. Two shovel
tests (STs 9 and 10) were excavated south of Elroy Road within the APE in mixed clays and fill
dirt without any evidence of cultural resources. Erosional cuts and animal burrows were
investigated for cultural material with negative results. The site does not extend into the APE
south of its original boundary and was determined ineligible within the ROW to the north. See
associated photographs in Appendix B (B-11 and B-12).
During the survey of the area adjacent to site 41TV2166, three negative shovel tests (STs 11
through 13) were excavated along the APE. The site was described as a sparse lithic scatter
extending 175 feet north from Mason Creek into the floodplain. The site landscape was described
as a large open field that has been plowed and used for hay cultivation and possibly cattle grazing
(Campbell et al. 2007). A few pieces of lithic debitage had been recorded at this site along with
one hammerstone and one biface collected from the creek bed. The site was determined to have
low research potential and no further work was recommended. The site was SHPO determined
ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP or listing as an SAL in 2006 and 2007; however, the site
boundaries were not fully known (ATLAS 2018). No cultural materials were observed during the
current investigation and the shovel tests were negative; site 41TV2166 does not extend west
into the APE. As the landscape is moderately sloped in this area, the cultural materials recorded
in 2006 and 2007 may have eroded downslope from the large hilltop to the north northwest beyond
the APE. See associated photographs in Appendix B (B-13 through B-15).

During the survey of the area adjacent to site 41TV2163, one negative shovel test (ST 14) was
excavated immediately south of the known site boundary. The site was described as a lithic
scatter adjacent to a large hilltop to the east and the lithic debitage was collected in 2005. The
survey was confined to the SH 130 ROW and the researchers suggested that the cultural material
was washing down from the higher elevations of the large hilltop and the site likely extended
beyond the survey boundary (Campbell et al.2007). Within the SH 130 ROW, the site was SHPO
determined ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP or listing as an SAL in 2006 and 2007; however,
the area to the north of the site could not be surveyed at the time of the SH 130 investigation.
During the current investigation, we determined that the entire area was covered with large
numbers of natural chert cobbles and numerous modified cobbles and cores with a few primary
flakes, one large biface blank, and several very large fossilized oyster shells. These cultural
materials extend a significant distance to the south approximately 240 feet (0.6 acres total) and
to the north approximately 382 feet (1.2 acres total) beyond the previously identified site
boundary. However, the northern extension of the site is located on steep slopes and has been
impacted by bulldozing, fence lines, and downslope erosion. Natural and a few modified chert
cobbles were observed within the bulldozer berms. Large numbers of raw lithic material were
observed across the site; however, it appears that less than 10 to 20 percent were minimally
modified with only a few showing moderate flake removal. The exception is one large biface blank
with significant flake removal. See associated photographs in Appendix B (B-16 through B-24).
The final survey area consists of an extensive prehistoric quarry located north of the previously
determined boundary of 41TV150. It was determined that shovel testing was not warranted as
the site boundary is easily defined by the distribution of surficial cultural material and erosional
gullies; as well, numerous animal burrow mounds were investigated for evidence of subsurface
materials.
The site was originally recorded by C.K. Chandler in 1968 as a prehistoric quarry site; two dart
points, two knife blades, a few bifaces, and crudely worked bifaces were reported (ATLAS 2018).
The site has been investigated numerous times between 2002 and 2007 by PBS&J (Rogers and
Russell 2008) and Hicks and Company (Campbell et al. 2007). A historic 1910 house and barn
along with numerous historic artifacts (glass fragments of a multitude of colors, intact glass
bottles, decorated and plain ceramics, cut and wire nails, coins, and shell buttons) were
documented. A 1946 structure replaced the 1910 house and five additional wooden agriculturalrelated structures and parts of farm equipment was observed across the site. The diagnostic
artifacts included various ceramics (dating between 1820 and 1900), glass (dating between 1890
and 1920), a bottle dating to the 1940s, and a 1942 penny (ATLAS 2018). The structures were in
severe disrepair and were not architecturally significant; the prehistoric and historic components
were not recommended for inclusion in the NRHP or listing as SALs. At a later date, PBS&J
investigated reports of a historic cemetery in the southeastern part of the site in an area with a
wooden and wire fence and planted irises. A single wooden coffin with human remains was
recorded at 1.4 meters below the ground surface and left in place. The burial was later removed,
and DNA testing of possible descendants did not result in matches. The burial was reinterred at
the Onion Creek Memorial Park. No further work was recommended at this site (Rogers and
Russell 2008). The historic burial site is located approximately 0.45 mile southeast of the current
project on the opposite side of SH 130. In total, PBS&J excavated 43 shovel tests (including 16
positive tests, composed mainly of historic artifacts) in 2002, 69 negative shovel tests were
excavated later in 2002, mechanical excavations were carried out in 2003 in the area of the
historic burial, and the burial was excavated in 2004. In 2007, Hicks and Company excavated 14

shovel tests in the area immediately south of the current investigation; four positive tests included
a few lithics in the upper four inches and large numbers of glass and plastic in the upper four to
eight inches. Hicks and Company later excavated 68 negative backhoe trenches in the area of
the historic burial and monitored construction activities in and around Moore Road with negative
results.
Site 41TV150 was eventually recorded as a multicomponent prehistoric and historic site that
encompassed approximately 20 acres with its southeastern corner located east of SH 130
immediately north of Moore Road, the southwestern boundary located west of SH 130 and south
of Moore Road, and extending approximately 0.43 mile to the north.
During the current investigation, located north of the 20-acre site 41TV150 boundary, the
systematic pedestrian survey resulted in the documentation of hundreds of natural chert cobbles
and numerous modified cobbles and cores with a few primary flakes. Most of the modified cobbles
consist of cobbles broken in half or have one or two flake removals; these were occassionally
observed without any patterning or clustering. The site boundary extends approximately 0.17
linear mile (approximately 4 acres in total) to the north of the previously identified site; the western
boundary is the fence line (eastern boundary of private property) and the low-lying drainage ditch
at the base of the steep upward slope to SH 130. Several deeply entrenched gullies were
observed eroding into the drainage ditch; all were negative for cultural resources. Numerous
animal burrow mounds were investigated with negative results. One interesting artifact, a rounded
piece of clouded glass was flaked on three sides to create steep bits, was observed while
traversing across the northern portion of the previously recorded site in the area of the removed
historic structures. It is most likely associated with the historic site component. No diagnostic
artifacts, features, or concentrations were observed during the investigation. See Appendix A,
Figure 4 for the revised site boundary and Appendix B (B-25 through B-40) for associated
photographs.

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The pedestrian survey and strategically placed shovel tests, within the areas that had not been
previously surveyed, were negative for cultural resources except in the area of sites 41TV150 and
41TV2163. The revised boundaries of sites 41TV150 and 41TV2163 have been greatly
expanded; however, the cultural materials at both sites were occassionally observed and lacked
patterning or clustering. Due to the lack of features/concentrations, intact buried deposits,
diagnostics, or a diverse cultural assemblage, sites 41TV2163 and 41TV150, within the APE, lack
research potential to interpret the site function or date of occupation other than prehistoric.
Therefore, Apex concurs with the original determination that the sites are ineligible for listing as
SALs or inclusion in the NRHP and no further investigations are warranted.
Apex recommends that the proposed Project proceed without further cultural resources
investigation as the proposed Project would have no effect on cultural resources with the potential
for listing as SALs or inclusion in the NRHP.
If it is determined that the planned construction requires additional workspace beyond the
currently proposed infrastructure, then further archeological investigations may be necessary in
those areas prior to any construction. If evidence of intact archeological and historic resources is
identified during construction, work in the immediate area should cease until the in advertent
discoveries are assessed by a professional archeologist.
