Abstract

T

his document describes the results of
Phase I cultural resources survey of the
proposed Texas Eastern Transmission, LP,
Sites 1, 2, and 3 MEXI-STFE Project, in Hidalgo
County, Texas. The project entailed examination
of a 4.5 km (2.8 mi) long pipeline replacement,
0.6 ha (1.4 ac) of additional temporary workspace
and 1.5 km (0.9 mi) of proposed project access
roads. Together these project items totaled 21.6
ha (54.1 ac) in area. This investigation was completed on behalf of Texas Eastern Transmission,
LP, by R. Christopher Goodwin & Associates,
Inc. between October 30 and November 1, 2018.
Fieldwork included intensive pedestrian survey augmented by the excavation of 104 shovel
tests throughout the limits of the various project
items. No cultural material or evidence for intact cultural deposits was identified within the

R. Christopher Goodwin & Associates, Inc.

limits of the proposed project area. A portion of
the MEXI-STFE Site 1 project item (i.e., Locus
1-01), does fall, however, within the limits of the
Louisiana-Rio Grande Canal Company Irrigation
System National Register District. The replacement of the current pipeline with the installation
of the newly proposed pipe within Texas Eastern
Transmission’s existing ROW will not have an
adverse effect on that district. Two additional irrigation ditches, not associated with the LouisianaRio Grande Canal Company system, also were
recorded within the Sites 2 and 3 project corridors. These ditches also will not be affected by
the planned construction activities. No additional
cultural resources were identified as a result of
this investigation, and no additional testing of the
Texas Eastern Transmission, LP, MEXI-STFE
Sites 1, 2, and 3 Project is recommended.

Project Description and Research Design
Texas Eastern Transmission, LP, a natural
gas transmission company based in Houston,
Texas plans to replace approximately 4547 m
(14,918 ft) of its existing 30-inch Line 16 natural gas transmission pipeline in Hidalgo County,
Texas. In an effort to comply with minimum
federal pipeline safety regulations and standards
regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation and codified in 49 CFR 192, Texas Eastern
must replace a portion of its existing pipeline.
Ground disturbance activities associated with
the construction of the new project will be limited to the currently maintained pipeline right-ofway (ROW), per the Natural Gas Act of 1938.
Since the project is regulated by the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission under 18 CFR
Section 157.208, subpart F, a cultural resources
investigation is required prior to the initiation of
any construction activities.

his document describes the results of a
Phase I cultural resources survey of the
proposed Texas Eastern Transmission, LP,
Sites 1, 2, and 3 MEXI-STFE Project, in Hidalgo
County, Texas (Figures 1.1 and 1.2). The project
entailed examination of a 4.5 km (2.8 mi) long
pipeline replacement, 0.6 ha (1.4 ac) of additional
temporary workspace and 1.5 km (0.9 mi) of proposed project access roads. Together these project items totaled 21.6 ha (54.1 ac) in area. This
investigation was completed by R. Christopher
Goodwin & Associates, Inc. (RCG&A) on behalf
of Texas Eastern Transmission, LP (Texas Eastern) in October and November of 2018.
The goal of this investigation was to identify
and to evaluate preliminarily all historic properties, archeological sites, cultural resources loci,
standing structures, and/or cemeteries that may
be impacted adversely by the proposed project.
All work was performed in accordance with the
procedures outlined in the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended; the Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act of 1974;
the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of
1979, as amended; and Title 36 of the Code of
Federal Regulations, Parts 60-66 and 800, as appropriate. Additionally, this survey effort abided
by the standards set forth in the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, Office of Pipeline Regulation’s Guidelines for Reporting on Cultural Resources Investigations (1994:11-13), the Archeology and Historic Preservation: The Secretary
of the Interior’s Guidelines, and with guidelines
contained within the Texas Historical Commission’s Preserving Our Heritage: A Statewide Plan
for Texas. Information provided by the Council
of Texas Archeologists, the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory, the Antiquities Code
of Texas, and the Texas Historical Commission’s
Rules of Practice and Procedure for the Antiquities Code of Texas.
R. Christopher Goodwin & Associates, Inc.

Summary of Results and Recommendations
Pedestrian survey augmented by the excavation of 105 shovel tests failed to identify any
cultural material or evidence for intact cultural
deposits within the limits of the project area. A
portion of the MEXI-STFE Site 1 project item
(i.e., Locus 1-01), however, falls within the limits of the Louisiana-Rio Grande Canal Company
Irrigation System National Register District. The
replacement of the current pipeline with the installation of the newly proposed pipe within
Texas Eastern Transmission’s existing ROW will
not have an adverse effect on that district. Two
additional ditches, not associated with the Louisiana-Rio Grande Canal Company system, were recorded within the Sites 2 and 3 project corridors.
These ditches will not be affected by the planned
project activities. No additional cultural resources were identified as a result of this investigation,
and no additional testing of the Texas Eastern

Environmental Setting

his chapter includes a brief overview of the
Quaternary landscape, flora, fauna, and climate of the south Texas environment. The
environment strongly influenced prehistoric settlement patterns throughout this portion of coastal
Texas. Over time, those same variables helped to
cover or subsequently expose the archeological
evidence associated with the prehistoric peoples
that once occupied the area.
Geoarchaeology refers to the application of
concepts and methods of geosciences to the study
of archeological site deposits, landscape evolution, and formation processes involved in the
creation, alteration, burial, and destruction of the
archeological record (Collins 2004:106; Mandel
2000:3; Waters 1992:3-4). Landscape-scale studies rely on geoarcheological methods to identify
landforms that have the potential to contain archeological sites as well as identify processes
that affect the distribution of archeological sites
across the landscape. One objective of such studies is to formulate sampling guidelines, which
aid in the identification of areas with a relatively
high probability to contain archeological sites. A
review of the environmental setting as well as the
examination of known archeological site distribution within the proposed project area, provided
the foundation for developing an archeological
sensitivity model that could be used to classify
the survey corridor into areas of high, low, or
indeterminate potential to guide the survey protocols used to identify archeological sites within
and immediately adjacent to the Area of Potential
Effect. .

expression of the Balcones Fault, which marks
the transition from the coastal plain to Texas Hill
Country. In Texas, the Coastal Plain is subdivided into the Coastal Prairies, the Interior Coastal
Plains, and the Blackland Prairies subprovinces
(Bureau of Economic Geology 1996a). The proposed project is located in the Coastal Prairies
subprovince, which includes the shoreline zone
and barrier islands; it extends approximately 80
km (50 mi) inland to the Interior Coastal Plain.
Throughout the project region, the topography is relatively flat and elevations measure less
than 46 m (150 ft) above mean sea level (amsl).
The proposed MEXI-STFE Sites 1, 2, and 3
project items are situated within the Floodplains
and Low Terraces subdivision (Level IV) of the
Western Gulf Coastal Plain ecoregion (Griffith et
al. 2004). This subdivision primarily covers the
Holocene floodplain and low terrace deposits and
exhibits Bottomland forests consisting of pecan,
water oak, southern live oak, and elm (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1996a; Griffith et al. 2004).
Hydrology
The proposed project corridor is within the
Nueces-Rio Grande Coastal Water Basin, a drainage basin bounded on the north by the Nueces
River Basin and on the west and south by the
Rio Grande Basin (Bureau of Economic Geology 1996b). On the east it is bounded by the
Laguna Madre estuary, barrier islands, and the
Gulf of Mexico. The Nueces-Rio Grande Coastal
Basin drains an area that measure 10,442 square
miles in extent (Texas Water Development Board
1997:3-199). The Gulf Coast Aquifer System
underlies this basin (Parsons Engineering Science, Inc. 1999:3-199). Other streams found in
the vicinity of the proposed project items in Hidalgo County include the Arroyo Colorado and
La Joya Creek. River and stream valleys offer the
highest potential to contain archeological sites in

Physiography
The project area lies within the West Gulf
Coastal Plain physiographic section of the Coastal Plain province (Fenneman 1938). The Coastal
Plain province extends from the Gulf of Mexico
inland to the Balcones Escarpment, the surface

buried context. Buried sites are expected to occur
on floodplain rises, alluvial terraces, and natural
levees. Sites in these settings may be significant
since they can yield important chronological information needed for addressing prehistoric settlement patterns (Perttula 2004).

provided below; these species are present not only
in the project region, but also the larger Central
Coast subarea (Burt 1980; Mercado-Allinger and
Ricklis 1996). The distribution of some of these
species prior to historic European development
of the area is difficult to assess. Additionally, certain species appear to thrive in disturbed habitats
(Collins 1981). Although these species were present prehistorically and may have been adapted to
clearings created by Native American and subsequent historic European populations, they probably were less numerous than suggested by modern species distributions (Mercado-Allinger and
Ricklis 1996).

Geology
Surface geology throughout the project area
consists of relatively recent Quaternary (Pleistocene and Holocene) deposits. The Pleistocene
Beaumont Formation can be found in the flood
basins, coastal lakes, and former stream channels
throughout much of Hidalgo County (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1974, 1975; USGS 2015).
The Beaumont Formation consists of clay that
is poorly bedded and marly and contains interbedded lenses of sand and massive accumulations of caliche (calcium carbonate) (Chowdhury
and Turco 2006:43). It has low permeability and
overlies the Lissie Formation. The majority of
the Beaumont Formation was deposited by rivers
as their levees and deltas shifted along the coast;
however, marine and lagoonal water deposited a
minority of the sediments (Chowdhury and Turco
2006:44).

Terrestrial Fauna
The Central Coast subarea supports a wide
variety of reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals. Reptiles present in this subarea include
aquatic and terrestrial turtles, lizards, snakes, and
the American alligator, while amphibians are represented by several species of frogs and toads.
Birds include the Canada goose and snow goose,
sandhill and whooping cranes, the brown pelican,
the great blue heron, the little blue heron, gulls
and terns, and the various avian fauna that inhabit
the prairies and riverine floodplains. The smaller mammalian species include both rodents and
lagomorphs. The collared peccary, also known as
the javelina, currently is present, but it may not
have inhabited the region prehistorically in the
numbers found today. Prior to the historic occupation of the area, there is evidence that black bear,
wolf, and puma inhabited the region, although
these species are absent from the region at this
time. Carnivorous mammals common to the area
include the bobcat, gray fox, coyote, raccoon,
and opossum (Shew et al. 1981). Mammals commonly found in the archeological record include
white-tailed deer (still present in the area) and bison; both of these species were abundant during
the Early Historic period (Mercado-Allinger and
Ricklis 1996).

Soils
Soils data discussed in this section were
extracted from the National Resources Conservation Services’ online soils database (Natural
Resources Conservation Service [NRCS], United
States Department of Agriculture [USDA] 2018).
NRCS (2018) provides series level descriptions
for all soils associated with the proposed project
items. Soils mapped in the survey corridor in Hidalgo County are mostly well drained and occur
in coastal plain and coastal terrace environments;
they include Brennan sandy loam, Comitas loamy
fine sand, Delfina loamy fine sand, Hargill fine
sandy loam, Hidalgo sandy clay loam, Racombes
sandy clay loam, the Raymondville complex, and
Willacy fine sandy loam. All these types are well
drained (Figure 2.1; Table 2.1).

Flora
The natural vegetation generally associated
with the nearby coastal area is grassland; however, older inland plains exhibit forest or savannatype vegetation potentials (Griffith et al. 2004). In

Fauna
The project area supports a diverse array of
animals. A brief discussion of the mammal, bird,
fish, and reptile species common to this area is

the terrestrial floodplains, more dense vegetation
such as hackberry, anaqua, huisache, elm, and pecan can be found. During the Early Historic period, the Rio Grande floodplain supported large
palm trees and floodplain forests; however, these
were cleared more than a century ago and today
only small pieces of the floodplain forest remain
(Griffith et al. 2004). Now, like most of the coastal prairie region, this land has been converted
for agriculture and urban development. Various
grasses also thrive on the floodplain, and, in seasonally inundated areas, lotus, cattail, and sedges
are present.
As the floodplains give way to prairie lands,
traditional prairie grasses, including silver bluestem, little bluestem, plains bristle grass, and Texas wintergrass, can be found in addition to forbs
(i.e., prairie coneflower and western ragweed),
while chaparral vegetation is dominated by acacia,
lotebrush, Mexican persimmon, and lime prickly
ash (Mercado-Allinger and Ricklis 1996).

Climate also may influence the timing and extent
of seasonal movements and/or migrations made
by hunting and gathering groups within an area.
The climate of Hidalgo County area is humid subtropical and it is characterized by warm
summers and mild winters. The Gulf of Mexico
has an ameliorating effect on temperature and
prevailing southeasterly winds from the Gulf of
Mexico help to regulate temperature. Rainfall
peaks in the spring and fall, as does the possibility of tropical storms. During the summer months,
tropical storms threaten the Texas coast infrequently with hurricanes, although the risk of the
storms making landfall at any particular location
is slight. The growing season in south Texas is
long, averaging between 310 and 330 days (Shew
et al. 1981:326). Historically, this long growing
season has allowed for a variety of crops, including cotton, vegetables, and citrus, to be grown in
this region; however, a lack of available surface
water has been a limiting factor in raising crops
(Knight 2009).
Annual precipitation in the McAllen, Texas
area during the period between 1981 and 2010
averaged 22.2 inches (usclimatedata.com 2018).
Most of the rain in this area falls in spring (May)
and fall (September and October). Despite this
amount of rainfall, evapotranspiration (i.e., moisture that is lost through evaporation and plant
transpiration) commonly exceeds rainfall in this
area (Black 1989a:9). Both short term (a few

Climate
The climate of an area is especially important as it relates to the subsistence strategies employed and adapted by prehistoric and historic
cultural groups. The climate dictates the type and
the extent that agriculture can be practiced in a region. For example, in an area that contains prime
agricultural soils, an absence of sufficient rainfall
may prevent certain crops from being harvested.

months) and long term (a year or more) droughts
are common in this area (Black 1989a:9). These
climatic water shortages impacted both prehistoric and historic inhabitants of the region. For
example, droughts, along with freezes created
significant problems for the agriculture industry
in this region in the late 1920s-1930s and again in
the late 1940s-1950s (Knight 2009).

During the mid to late twentieth century, average annual temperature ranged from about 64ºF
in the northern portion of the West Gulf Coastal
Plain to approximately 75ºF in the south (Black
1989a:9). The average winter temperature in this
region was 58º-60ºF while the average summer
temperature was 82º-85ºF (Jacobs 1981).

rcheological manifestations in Texas
are defined broadly by a number of diverse cultural-ecological regions (Ricklis 2004:6-7). The MEXI-STFE Sites 1, 2, and 3
project items are situated in Hidalgo County, Texas and fall within the lower Texas coastal zone,
which extends from the southern margin of Baffin
Bay to the Rio Grande. The lower coast straddles
two distinct physiographic subareas: the Texas
Sand Sheet and the Rio Grande Deltaic Plain.
Archeologically, the Texas Sand Sheet region
is virtually unknown. The few recorded sites in
this subarea tend to be associated with freshwater sources, including playas and riverine settings
(Ricklis 2004:177).
The dominant landform south of the Texas Sand Sheet is the Rio Grande Deltaic Plain,
which formed from Pleistocene fluvial-deltaic
sediments and Holocene alluvium deposited at
the mouth of the Rio Grande (Ricklis 2004:177178). The dry subtropical climate supports grasses, cacti, thorny trees and shrubs. The delta and
modern floodplain of the Rio Grande have been
extensively modified by historical and modern
land-use practices, including the development of
large-scale drainage, flood control, and irrigation
systems. Prehistorically, this area was covered by
floodplain forest. To the east, the hypersaline Laguna Madre is a shallow marine lagoon rich in
marine resources. Archeologically, the Brownsville Complex (circa A.D. 1000-1700) coincides
with the Rio Grande Deltaic Plain subarea of the
lower Texas coast (Ricklis 2004:178-179).
The cultural-historical framework for these
areas includes the Paleoindian, Archaic (Early,
Middle, and Late), Late Prehistoric, and Protohistoric periods. In general, the earlier portions of
the chronological continuum, encompassing the
Paleoindian and Early Archaic periods, are poorly understood since few deeply stratified sites
have been excavated. In addition, there is a pauR. Christopher Goodwin & Associates, Inc.

city of radiocarbon dates for this region because
preservation of dateable floral and faunal remains
is poor. This leaves archeologists little choice but
to infer patterns of subsistence, settlement, and
tool use from similar data collected in adjacent
regions. From the Late Archaic period onward,
the culture history is better understood, likely
because the size of the prehistoric population increased through time, the sites are more visible
on the landscape, and more sites from later time
periods have been studied through extensive excavation.
When possible, the archeological data discussed herein is specific to the vicinity of the
project corridor (i.e., Hidalgo County) and of the
coastal plain, but this information is supplemented with data collected from adjacent regions (i.e.,
from South Texas region, the Savanna and Prairie region, the central Texas Edwards Plateau, the
upper Texas coast, and northeast Texas). Since
prehistoric chronologies differ somewhat among
these regions (and generally among many regions
statewide), the age ranges presented below closely follow Ricklis et al. (2012:21).
Paleoindian
While pre-Clovis investigations are underway in Texas (Waters, Forman, et al. 2011), for
this study the Paleoindian period begins with the
Clovis era, approximately 13,500 years cal B.P.
and extends to Scottsbluff and other Late Paleoindian cultures (i.e., to approximately 11,000 to
10,000 years cal B.P.). This period is recognized
by cultural adaptations associated with the rapidly changing environmental milieu that characterized the late Pleistocene climatic era. In Texas
and elsewhere in North America, the Paleoindian
period is marked by a distinctive set of stone tools,
most notably finely crafted lanceolate projectile
points/knives and hafted unifacial tools. Chipped
stone projectile points like the Clovis and Folsom
18

Chapter III: Prehistoric Context

forms exhibited a distinctive “flute” or channel
on one or more basal faces that was part of the
hafting configuration. In the part of Texas under
consideration here, Clovis, Golondrina, Plainview, Angostura, and Scottsbluff are recognized
as the best temporally diagnostic markers of the
Paleoindian period; however, nearly all examples
of these points known from the region were recovered from surface contexts (Bousman et al.
2004, Hester 2004; Mercado-Allinger and Ricklis
1996:63-64).
During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM),
approximately 13,500 years ago, water tables
were lower. Some approximations place sea level
as much as 48 m (157 ft) lower and 136 km (85
mi) farther seaward than it is today (Stright et al.
1999). As a consequence, the configuration of
Texas’s east coast shoreline was vastly different
and river deltas extended much farther out into
the Gulf of Mexico when compared to today’s
geography. At the close of the Pleistocene, lower
sea levels exposed a shoreline that extended for
an additional 150 to 200 km (93 to 124 mi) seaward. In other words, the Late Pleistocene shoreline inhabited by early Paleoindian populations
now is submerged; therefore intact subsurface
Paleoindian components actually are associated
with terrestrial and riverine adaptations and not
coastal adaptations (Ricklis 2004:156; Stright
1986).
A potentially important Paleoindian site, the
La Paloma Mammoth Site (41KN78), is located
along the Palo Blanco River in Kenedy County
(Suhm 1978, 1980). There, bones of mammoth
and Bison antiquus were recovered, as well as a
possible fluted lanceolate point and other tools;
however, the artifacts were found in secondary
context and not in direct association with the
Pleistocene faunal remains. The submerged site
at McFaddin Beach (41JF50) on the upper Gulf
Coast has produced artifacts spanning the entire
spectrum of Texas prehistory, with astonishing
numbers of Paleoindian and Early Archaic projectile points having been recovered. Significant Paleoindian sites include Buckner Ranch
(41BE2), Johnston-Heller (41VT15), Berger
Bluff (41GD30), Falcon Reservoir (multiple
sites), and Petronila Creek (41NU246) (Brown
1983, Hester 1980, 1995). Although these sites
R. Christopher Goodwin & Associates, Inc.

have produced Paleoindian assemblages from
great depths (>4.5 m [>15.0 ft]), the material has
not necessarily originated from intact contexts.
Late Paleoindian projectile point types, such as
Golondrina, Plainview, Wilson, Angostura, and
Scottsbluff, are more prevalent across the landscape, but again, few sites have been excavated
extensively. The Johnston-Heller and Willeke
(41VT16) sites in Victoria County perhaps represent “the best opportunity in southern Texas to
find the Late Paleoindian [projectile point] forms
in context” but these sites have not been explored
fully (Hester 2004:136). Paleoindian sites in the
central and lower Texas coast are represented
by occasional surface finds of projectile points
with no intact subsurface assemblages (Ricklis
2004:156). Furthermore, due to rising sea levels
and coastal inundation at the end of the LGM,
most of these surface finds do not necessarily characterize coastal Paleoindian occupations.
Submerged artifact assemblages along the former
coastline would be more likely to indicate Paleoindian coastal adaptation.
Well-stratified Paleoindian sites on or near
the Balcones Escarpment of central Texas, such
as Wilson-Leonard (41WM235) (Bousman et al.
2002; Collins 1998), Gault (41BL323) (Waters,
Pevny et al. 2011), and Pavo Real (41BX52)
(Collins et al. 2003), document a Clovis, FolsomMidland, Plainview, Early Stemmed, San Patrice,
Scottsbluff, Golondrina-Barber, and AngosturaThrall sequence for this region. These sites have
contributed much towards an understanding of
Paleoindian subsistence and settlement, which
was perhaps more similar to early Holocene adaptations than previously believed. For instance,
Clovis hunter-gatherers had a more generalized
diet, one that emphasized more than just the
hunting of large game (i.e., megafauna) and these
populations do not appear to be as highly mobile
as later Folsom bison hunters (Bever and Meltzer
2007; Waters, Pevny et al. 2011).
Archaic
Following the onset of the Holocene, the
Early Archaic period (11,000/10,000 to 8000
years cal B.P.) began a long period of cultural adaptation to the post-Pleistocene environment. In
many if not most of the major river drainages of
19

Chapter III: Prehistoric Context

eastern North America, the Archaic witnessed a
trajectory of change, which resulted in long-term,
seasonal reuse of sites, an economy focused on
the exploitation of seasonally available foods,
refinements in technology developed in response
to diversification in subsistence patterns (e.g., use
of groundstone), and an increase in population.
The warm interglacial climate of the Holocene
was much more stable after about 11,500 years
cal B.P. The end of the Younger Dryas interval
brought a rapid shift to warmer conditions, apparently followed by relatively slow warming over
the next several thousand years.
A distinctive innovation in subsistence technology, which developed at the beginning of the
Archaic period in other parts of the continental
United States, was the notching of the haft element
on projectile points. Some investigators (Gardner
1974; Morse et al. 1996) argued that this trait
reflects the replacement of spear-throwers and
detachable-shaft lances with the use of the atlatl.
While there is some evidence for the use of atlatls
by Paleoindians, the development of notching at
least signals the elaboration and widespread use
of a throwing as opposed to a thrusting technique.
This change may reflect the exploitation of more
solitary game species, an adaptation to changing
environmental conditions that began during the
Paleoindian period. At the Wilson-Leonard Site
in Wilson County, the corner-notched Wilson
point (classified as Paleoindian and referred to
as “stemmed”) dates from between 11,400 and
10,800 cal B.P. (Stafford 1998); the older dates
are comparable to dates from early side- and corner-notched points recovered from other parts of
the southeastern and central United States at sites
like Page-Ladson, Florida (8JE591) (Webb 2006)
and James Farnsley, Indiana (12HR520) (Stafford
and Cantin 2009).
For the current study area, the distribution
of Early Archaic sites is poorly understood and
settlement patterns are virtually unknown because of the paucity of sites that date from this
period. The Richard Beene Site (41BX831) in
southern Bexar County near San Antonio (Thoms
and Mandel 2007) is one of the few sites on the
Coastal Plain with occupations spanning the
last 10,000 years with corner-notched bifurcate
Martindale/Bandy-like and Baker points. Hester
R. Christopher Goodwin & Associates, Inc.

(2004) speculated that Early Archaic hunter-gatherers in south Texas formed small highly mobile
bands, which ranged across more area because of
the arid climate of the region. Hester divided the
Early Archaic Period (11,000–8000 years ago)
for South Texas into two horizons: an early corner-notched point horizon followed by an early
basal-notched point horizon. Corner-notched
points include Martin, Uvalde, Baker, and Bandy points, while basal-notched points are represented by Bell and Andice points (i.e., Calf Creek
horizon). Bell points have been recovered from
the McKinzie Site (41NU221) at the mouth of the
Nueces River (Ricklis 2004:164), while Andice
points have been recovered from Site 41VT17 in
Victoria County (Fox and Hester 1976).
At the beginning of the Early Archaic almost
continent-wide, gouge or adze-like tools likely
associated with woodworking appear in great
numbers compared to the few identified in Paleoindian contexts. For instance Guadalupe tools,
prevalent in the San Antonio and Guadalupe river
basins, seem to be associated with the earliest
corner-notched horizon, while Clear Fork tools
are associated with the basally notched point horizon (Hester 2004:137-138).
Multiple radiocarbon dates on stratigraphically discrete accumulations of shellfish in Nueces Bay, Nueces and San Patricio counties, have
Early Archaic dates that range from 7500 to 4200
B.P. (Ricklis 2004:161-165). At sites such as
McKinzie and Means (41NU184), bivalve shells
overwhelm all other artifact types, but debitage
and lithic tools, including projectile points, were
present. Some oyster and sunray venus clam
shell specimens exhibited edge modification or
perforation. Fish exploitation appears to have
increased in popularity over time, and sites also
became more numerous. These data may indicate
population expansion, although earlier sites could
have been removed by erosion during the Early
and Middle Holocene.
Recently reported (Ricklis et al. 2012) evidence from the Buckeye Knoll Site (41VT98) in
Victoria County provides new data on Early Archaic coastal adaptations for this region of Texas.
Located near the banks of the Guadalupe River

and included nets, hide bags, baskets, and projectile points, such as triangular Tortugas, Abasolo,
Lange, Morhiss, and Pedernales types, in addition to gouges, flakes, cores, marine shell, tabular
pieces of sandstone, and tubular sandstone pipes.
The Choke Canyon sites and Loma Sandia are
both inside the South Texas Plains, just outside
the border of Coastal Texas (Pertulla 2004).
Current evidence for Middle Archaic occupation of the lower and central Texas coast is
minimal (Ricklis 2004:165). Vertically controlled
radiocarbon dates from multiple stratified sites in
the region suggest that this is not due to sampling
bias; the region does not seem to have been occupied from 4200 to 3100 B.P. A scant accumulation of oyster shell in the lower levels of 41SP177
on the north shore of Nueces Bay had dates ranging from 3835 to 3643 B.P., but these may have
been naturally deposited on a relict beachline.
In most parts of the United States, the Late
Archaic (6000/5000 to 4000/3200 years cal B.P.)
represents cultural adaptation to modern environmental conditions (Watts and Stuiver 1980). In
Texas, the principal Late Archaic diagnostic markers are Shumla, Ensor, Frio, Marcos, and Montell
points, along with Olmos bifaces and corner-tang
knives (Black 1989b; Hester 2004:1401). Sea
level stabilized to its modern position during the
Late Archaic period, and barrier islands formed;
sites became larger, middens became thicker,
and artifacts became more abundant and diverse.
These phenomena have been hypothesized to be a
result of population increase and/or more frequent
and intense occupations (Ricklis 2004:165). Such
changes are exemplified by the extensive Ingleside Cove occupations at 41SP43 and 41SP120
on the northeastern shore of Corpus Christi Bay
(Ricklis 2004:167). Estuarine resources are more
extensively exploited, and the relative quantities
of otoliths and number of sites indicate a dramatic increase in fishing after ca. 2000 B.P. (Ricklis
2004:165, 167). Diagnostic projectile points may
be present, but other lithic tools are scarce, presumably because workable shell was more abundant and accessible than riverine chert from distant sources. Oyster and sunray venus clam shell
edge-flaking and perforation continued from the
Early Archaic. Other shell tools such as whelk
body whorl adzes, awls, perforators, hammers,

cemetery resulted in the identification of over 75
individuals. Radiocarbon dates place this cemetery between ca. 7000 and 6200 years ago (ca.
5000-4200 B.C.). Analysis of stable isotopes in
the tooth pulp (15N and 13C) documents a diet
consisting of terrestrial, riverine, and marine food
resources, suggesting that these individuals must
have moved between the interior and the coast as
part of their subsistence strategy. A part-time use
of coastal resources (e.g., fish and shellfish) by
peoples living in the adjacent interior environment fits with evidence suggestive of the use of
short-term camps on the shoreline.
The Middle Archaic period (8000 to
6000/5000 years cal B.P.) coincided with the
mid-Holocene climatic event referred to variously as the Hypsithermal, Altithermal, Atlantic,
or Climatic Optimum. Technologically this cultural period was marked by the introduction of
stemmed projectile points. In Texas, the Middle
Archaic is recognized by projectile point types
such as Tortugas, Abasolo, Carrizo, Pedernales,
Lange, Langtry, and Morhiss. Tortugas, Abasolo,
and Carrizo types dominate Middle Archaic assemblages in the region. Diversification of lithic
technology is well documented for Middle Archaic sites in comparison to earlier occupations,
including a notable increase in the use of ground
stone technology. Distally beveled unifacial tools
are abundant in Middle Archaic assemblages and
may have been used for woodworking tasks. Tubular sandstone pipes appear in assemblages also
dating from this period.
Middle Archaic open camp sites can be
found along present or former stream channels
(Hester 2004:139). By the late Middle Archaic,
these sites are located on the floodplains, low terraces, and natural levees of present day stream
courses. Again, paleoenvironmental data are meager except at locations like Choke Canyon, where
the beans and nuts of mesquite, acacia, oak, and
hackberry have been recovered from multiple
sites. Heavy utilization of plant resources is reflected by an increase in hearths, earth ovens,
and burned rock middens. Disposal of the dead
entailed burial in formal cemeteries like the 205
burials identified within the Loma Sandia Site
(41LK28) in southeast Texas. Clusters of grave
goods were associated with many individuals,

and possible fishing tools made from conch shells
appeared. Awls and possible flaking tools from
deer bones have been recovered in addition to
geometrically engraved bone pins and cylindrical
bird bone beads. Basket impressions have been
found in burned clay and in asphaltum specimens
at the Tucker Site (41NU46) near Corpus Christi,
associated with a radiocarbon date of ca. 3000
B.P. (Ricklis 2004:169).The Late Archaic also
appears to be the first period in which cemeteries
appear on the central and lower Texas coast, at
locations such as the Blue Bayou Site (41VT94)
in Victoria County, and at Oso Bay (41NU2) in
Corpus Christi (Ricklis 2004:169).

Island, shellfish remains constitute only small
portions of the site matrix (Ricklis 2004:174).
Bison bones indicate more relative importance
than deer at sites interpreted to be Late Prehistoric hunting camps. People continued to be
seasonally mobile as evidenced by the seasonal
behaviors of fish and game (Ricklis 2004:165175). The year A.D. 1700 approximately marks
the time by which native cultures of central Texas
began to be affected by European colonization.
Most likely, the processes of group displacements
and depopulation caused by the introduction of
Old World diseases began as early as the middle
of the seventeenth century in the area (e.g., Collins and Ricklis 1994).
On the lower Texas coast, the Brownsville
Complex represents Late Prehistoric occupation
in the area of the Rio Grande delta. In addition
to shell tools, lithic microtools, and unstemmed
arrow points, Huastecan pottery from northeastern Mexico occurs in small quantities and may
indicate exchange with peoples further down
the coast. Generally, Late Prehistoric sites in the
area are small and do not produce much material, although sites in Cameron County near the
coast tend to be larger. It is possible that coastal
sites represented congregation points for multiple
family groups during the late fall through spring
months, while inland sites were occupied by
smaller groups during warmer parts of the year.
A few human burials have been found in the area,
including one at Site 41WY113 that produced
a radiocarbon date of 1088 B.P., and another at
the Horse Island Site (41CF29) that produced a
1-sigma calibrated date range of 1352 to 1261
B.P. (Ricklis 2004:178-180).

Late Prehistoric
The Late Prehistoric period, from A.D. 1000
to 1700, has been studied extensively, shares cultural patterns with central Texas to some degree,
and is represented by such temporally diagnostic
markers as Fresno, Scallorn, and Perdiz projectile points (Ricklis 2004:171-172). At the Blue
Bayou Site (41VT94), a Scallorn point was found
in a Late Prehistoric cemetery (Huebner and
Comuzzie 1992). Points similar to Scallorn and
Edwards types are widespread in south Texas,
where they co-occur with Perdiz points, pottery,
and straight-stemmed arrow points. Technological innovations such as the bow and arrow, shaft
straighteners (made from limestone and used to
straighten arrow shafts), and ceramics appear at
this time.
On the central Texas coast, Ricklis (2004:156)
further defined the Late Prehistoric based on the
distribution of Rockport phase sites, which have
been delimited by the distribution of distinctive
artifact assemblages, including Rockport ceramics and the use of asphaltum for decoration and
for finishing vessel surfaces. Other lithic tools—
such as unifacial end scrapers, bifacial knives,
chert drills, and prismatic blades and cores—are
Late Prehistoric diagnostics on the coast. Fresno,
Scallorn, and Perdiz are the dominant projectile point types in Late Prehistoric assemblages.
Fishing continued to be important, although the
emphasis appears to have shifted from collecting
shellfish to exploiting bony fish. At major Rockport sites such as Kirchmeyer (41NU11) on Oso
Bay and Packery Channey (41NU219) on Padre

Protohistoric
The Protohistoric period in the study region is
short and researchers have had difficulty associating known historic Native American groups with
their pre-contact ancestors (Mercado-Allinger
and Ricklis 1996). Limited and often conflicting ethnohistoric records exist for the region,
and disease and assimilation eventually stripped
many groups of their unique cultural identities.
Historically, the central Texas coast was occupied
by the Karankawa Indians, and the Rio Grande
delta was occupied by diverse groups who collec22

tively have come to be known as Coahuiltecans
(Newcomb 1961:29). The area between Corpus
Christi and the delta was remote from Spanish
administrative centers, and thus scant historical
documentation is available. What information is
available suggests the area between Baffin Bay
and the delta was sparsely populated during the
mid-eighteenth century (Salinas 1990:72).

Coahuiltecans
Protohistoric Native American populations
were densely concentrated in the Rio Grande delta,
with estimates ranging from 49 (Salinas 1990:69)
to upwards of 200 individual groups (Newcomb
1961:30). These groups spoke diverse dialects
and languages, including Comecrudo, Cotoname,
Aranama, Solano, Sanan, and Coahuilteco. Coahuiltecan is term used to encompass diverse Native Americans groups with distinct languages and
cultural identities based on a historical geographic
association with the South Texas Plains (Kenmotsu et al. 2006; Newcomb 1961:29). Salinas (1990)
provides a detailed account of the identities of the
named Indian groups of the Rio Grande delta as
documented in historic records.
The area occupied by these groups was
bounded by the Edwards Plateau to the north,
the Sierra Madre Oriental Mountains to the west,
and the Gulf of Mexico to the east (Kenmotsu et
al. 2006). Europeans noted dense Native American populations around the Rio Grande Delta.
In contrast, in the area immediately north of the
Rio Grande Delta, these same Europeans noted
very few Native American encampments (Salinas
1990). This is most likely due to limited fresh water caused by a lack of perennial streams.
During the Spanish Colonial Period, Coahuiltecan groups were displaced by Spanish from
the south and by retreating Apaches from the
north. Intragroup cultural and linguistic subtleties were largely ignored by the Spanish, and
little effort was made to classify distinct cultural
Coahuiltecan groups. Coahuiltecan history was
further obscured during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as their culture was fragmented
by epidemics, warfare, infant mortality, and resulting large-scale demoralization, in addition
to coalescence with other groups. Due to these
many factors, by the time Anglo-Americans began settling south Texas in the nineteenth century,
the Coahuiltecans of south Texas had all but disappeared (Newcomb 1961). Those who survived
the Mission era were assimilated into Catholic
Mexican communities (Kenmotsu et al. 2006).
Archaeological investigations in the region have
revealed little, if any, information regarding the
protohistoric Coahuiltecans (Campbell 1977;
Texas State Historical Association 2016).

The Karankawa Indians
The Karankawa Indians, a name used by
Spanish colonial officials to identify at least five
bands of coastal hunter-gatherers, spoke different dialects of the same language, shared kinship
ties, and occupied regions north of the Project
area (Aten 1983; Ricklis 1996). Some archeologists believe the Karankawas can be identified
by specific cultural assemblages from the Late
Prehistoric period such as the preceding Rockport phase. Sites that yield artifact assemblages
marked by Perdiz projectile point types, the use
of shell for tool-making, and ceramics wares
coated, decorated, and repaired with asphaltum
typically are attributed to the Karankawa (Ricklis
1996).
The Karankawas first entered the European
historical record in 1528 in Álvar Núñez Cabeza
de Vaca’s written account of the Spanish expedition of Pánfilo de Narváez. Cabeza de Vaca’s
account remains a key primary account of indigenous coastal lifeways of south Texas. The
next written account of the Karankawas is based
on French transcripts of 1698 testimony about
the 1685 expedition led by René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle. By the early eighteenth
century, Spanish-French rivalry over the Texas
coast led to numerous Catholic missions to civilize and Christianize the Karankawas in order to
claim them as loyal Spanish subjects. By 1821,
the end of Spanish rule in Texas, the Karankawa
population had been greatly reduced by epidemic
diseases, warfare, and other effects of European
invasion. The influx of Anglo-American settlers and hostile tribes into Karankawa territory
increased confrontations that forced the remaining population into Mexico, then back into Texas
during the late 1850s. In 1858, the last known
band of Karankawas was annihilated by a Texan
force near Rio Grande City (Lipscomb 2016).

Historical Overview of
Hidalgo County, Texas

I

ntroduction
The three project items (i.e., MEXI-STFE
Sites 1, 2 and 3) are located in south-central
Hidalgo County, generally east of the county seat,
Edinburg. Prior to its establishment as a U.S. governmental district, Hidalgo County successively
formed part of a Spanish colonial province, a
Mexican province and state, and the Republic of
Texas. This chapter presents a general historical
overview of Hidalgo County, from colonial settlement to the present day.

Nuevo Santander for his home province in Spain.
By 1749, the northern boundary of the district
had been adjusted southward to the Nueces River
(Chipman 2016; García 2010; Weddle 2010).
Between 1748 and 1756, Escandón founded
or recognized nearly two dozen settlements in
Nuevo Santander; however, most were situated
south of the Rio Grande and none within presentday Hidalgo County. The first settlement within
the future county bounds was La Habitación,
also referenced as Rancho San Luis or San Luisito, which was established in 1774, nearly two
decades after the Escandón settlements were created. This community, or ranch settlement, was
located along the north bank of the Rio Grande at
the site of the present-day town of Hidalgo (Garza 2016; Longoria 2001; Weddle 2010).
During Spain’s occupation of present-day
Texas, the colonial government dispensed title
to “about 170 porciones [portions] grants and
33 larger land grants” located north of the Rio
Grande (Texas General Land Office 2018:3). The
porciones grants have been described as “narrow long-lots fronting when possible on watercourses, the only reliable source of water, and extending back several miles for quantity” (Texas
General Land Office 2018:3). During the Spanish and, later, Mexican colonial jurisdictions, an
estimated 80 porciones situated within 19 larger
land grants were issued in the region that became
Hidalgo County. Most of these early grantees became cattle and sheep ranchers – typical of the
“frontier ranching province” of Nuevo Santander
(Garza 2016; Weddle 2010).
Prior to the arrival of the Spaniards, the
Nuevo Santander province had been occupied
by Native Americans. The groups living in future Hidalgo County included the Coahuilteco,

Spanish Colonization: Nuevo Santander
Province, 1746-1821
European nations had explored the Texas
region since the early sixteenth century; however, it wasn’t until the mid-eighteenth century
that colonization began along the Rio Grande.
Hidalgo County once was part of Costa del Seno
Mexicano, the coastal section of New Spain situated between Tampico (Mexico) and Matagorda
Bay (Texas) that the Spanish authorities regarded
as particularly susceptible to British and French
incursion. In order to bolster Spanish dominion,
the viceroy of New Spain designated the region
between Tampico and the San Antonio River as
a colonial province called Colonia de la Costa
del Seno Mexicano on September 3, 1746, and
he charged military leader José de Escandón with
reconnaissance of the district. In January of 1747,
Escandón dispatched seven expeditions from different locations in existing provinces, with orders
to survey the new province and record their observations en route to their common convergence
point at the mouth of the Rio Grande. On June 1,
1748, the viceroy appointed Escandón as military
commander and governor of Colonia de la Costa
del Seno Mexicano, which he then rechristened

Karankawa, Lipan Apache, and, by the early
nineteenth century, the Comanche – nations
long-associated with southern Texas. As Spanish settlement expanded, the Native Americans
fled (from both European encroachers and hostile
Native Americans), died of disease, intermarried
with the Spanish colonists, or were absorbed by
other indigenous groups. By the mid-nineteenth
century, the Nuevo Santander region was virtually devoid of a Native American population, other
than occasional raiding parties (Garza 2016; Garza and Long 2016).
During the early nineteenth century, Nuevo Santander province became caught up in the
Mexican War of Independence (1810-1821), “a
series of revolts that grew out of the increasing
political turmoil both in Spain and Mexico” (De
la Teja 2016). Hostilities began on September 16,
1810. There apparently were no major actions
that occurred within the limits of present-day Hidalgo County; however, the guerrilla actions and
local revolts over the next several years resulted
in the seizure of resources and the depopulation
of Spanish Texas (Chipman 2016; Fehrenbach
1991:121-131; Weddle 2010). Ultimately, the
Spanish colonial authorities came to terms with
the Mexican reformists and drafted a proposal for
independence on February 24, 1821. The Plan de
Iguala “offered three guarantees – preservation of
the Catholic Church’s status, the independence of
Mexico as a constitutional monarchy, and equality of Spaniards and criollos [Creoles]” (De la
Teja 2016). On August 24, 1821, the treaty was
signed, and Mexico became an independent nation (De la Teja 2016).

diate need to populate their northern provinces,
realizing that settlements in those districts would
improve defenses against hostile Native Americans and would provide a buffer zone against
the expanding United States. Anglo-American
colonists of good character were welcome, provided they pledged loyalty to Mexico and to the
Catholic Church; however, the Mexican government particularly encouraged the immigration of
European Catholics and the migration of Mexican citizens north of the Rio Grande (De León
2016; Fehrenbach 1991:137, 155-157, 164-165;
Graham 1994:23).
In 1824, the Mexican government redesignated the Tamaulipas province as the State of
Tamaulipas (Figure 4.1). Although the new state
government offered a very generous colonization
law, few foreign settlers took advantage of its
terms. Tamaulipas maintained a largely Spanish
and Mexican population (Graham 1994:23; Texas
General Land Office 2018:8).
Future Hidalgo County was affected only
peripherally by the Texas Revolution of 18351836. There apparently were no actions of note
that occurred in the immediate area during hostilities; however, it was part of disputed territory
during that period. On December 19, 1836, the
First Congress of the new Texas government declared that the Rio Grande marked the southern
and western boundaries of the Republic of Texas;
however, the Mexican government insisted that
the territory between the Nueces River and the
Rio Grande remained part of the State of Tamaulipas. Because neither government effectively
regulated the district, the region, referred to as
the Nueces Strip or the Wild Horse Desert, became a “No Man’s Land” for the next dozen years
(Figure 4.1). Although many residents abandoned
their ranches due to Native American hostilities
and the political turmoil of the times, the Mexican government continued to issue grants in the
region. The ranchers who remained ranged their
herds through the district, particularly the Rio
Grande Valley. In addition, both Mexican and
Texas traders conducted illegal commerce in the
region (Garza 2016; Garza and Long 2016; Texas
State Historical Association 2010).
On December 29, 1845, the U.S. Congress
accepted the state constitution for Texas, and the

Following the recognition of Mexico’s independence, the Spanish colonial province of
Nuevo Santander became the Mexican province
of Tamaulipas (Figure 4.1). In 1821, the new
district began independence with an economy in
disarray, depopulation as thousands of the unemployed sought work elsewhere, loss of agricultural productivity, serious divisions among the social
classes, tensions between Church and State, and
lack of governmental experience among its leaders. Mexican authorities recognized the immeR. Christopher Goodwin & Associates, Inc.

official transfer of government was made on February 16, 1846, at a joint meeting of members of
both the former republic and the new state governing bodies. Despite the continued Mexican
claims, the new state included southernmost Texas in its territory. This border region between the
Nueces River and the Rio Grande was added to
existing San Patricio County. Shortly thereafter,
on April 11, 1846, most of southern Texas below
the Nueces River, including present-day Hidalgo
County, was carved from San Patricio and organized into Nueces County (Guthrie 2016; Long
2016; MAPofUS.org 2018).
During the 1845 negotiations leading to the
U.S. annexation of Texas, President James Polk
ordered General Zachary Taylor and a small
American army to Corpus Christi, where they remained for several months as “protectors” during
the deliberations. On February 4, 1846, Taylor
received orders to march southward to the Rio
Grande in order to ensure the establishment of
that waterway as the southern boundary of the
new state. His troops marched overland, arriving
at the Rio Grande near present-day Brownsville
on March 26, 1846. The subsequent hostilities in
that district between Mexican forces and American troops touched off the Mexican War of 18461848 (Bauer 2016; McLean 2017:28-29).
None of the major events of the Mexican
War occurred in present-day Hidalgo County;
however, Taylor’s victory over the Mexican army
in the May 9, 1846, Battle of Resaca de Palma –
to the east, in future Cameron County – secured
the Texas side of the Rio Grande for the United
States. The remainder of the Mexican War was
fought beyond the Texas boundaries. Hostilities
ended in September 1847. The Mexican War officially came to an end with the signing of the
Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo on February 2,
1848, followed by its ratification in July of that
year. Through its terms, the Mexican government
recognized the U.S. annexation of Texas and the
Rio Grande as the boundary separating Texas and
Mexico (Bauer 2016; McLean 2017:29).

four years later, Hidalgo County was carved from
the southwestern portion of Cameron County
on January 24, 1852 (Garza and Long 2016;
RAOGK 2018). The new county was christened
in honor of Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, “the priest
known as the ‘father of Mexican independence,’”
executed as a rebel by the Spanish in 1811 (Texas
State Historical Association 2017). The first Hidalgo County seat was Edinburgh – the site of
La Habitación. The old colonial settlement was
renamed Edinburgh by area settler John Young,
who had emigrated from his native Scotland
(Garza 2010, 2016).
Although much of coastal Texas developed
rapidly during the last years of the antebellum era,
the region between the Nueces River and the Rio
Grande did not evolve as quickly. This remained
a fairly isolated district, and the area continued to
suffer attacks from hostile Native Americans. The
Rio Grande settlements were stopping points for
fortune seekers traveling the Old Military Road
to join the 1849 Gold Rush westward to California; however, relatively few interrupted their
journeys to stay and settle the trans-Nueces region. In 1860, the first census year that Hidalgo
existed as a U.S. county, its aggregate population was only 1,192, a number that consisted of
1,155 whites, 34 free people of color, 2 Native
Americans, and 1 slave (Garza 2016; Geostat
1998-2004; Lowe and Campbell 1987:11-13, 2427; McLean 2017:29; U.S. Bureau of the Census
2018 [1860]).
Like the rest of Texas, Hidalgo County was
overwhelmingly agricultural in the years before
the Civil War. When the county was established
in 1852, Hidalgo reported an estimated 40 to 45
ranches. In the northern part of the county, most
ranchers raised livestock, while the populace
closer to the Rio Grande worked primarily as
farmers or farm laborers. A few Hidalgo residents
labored in transportation and trade across the
Mexican border. By 1860, there were 190 farms/
ranches recorded in Hidalgo County, with no
statistics available for manufacturing establishments. Crops included corn, squash, citrus fruit,
and other vegetables and fruit, and they were
grown largely for subsistence, rather than as cash
harvests (Garza 2016; Geostat 1998-2004; U.S.
Bureau of the Census 2018 [1860]).

Chapter IV: Historical Overview of Hidalgo County, Texas

The agricultural schedule of the 1860 federal census provides evidence that the most
valuable antebellum money “crop” of Hidalgo
County was livestock. In 1860, the census reported 190 farms or ranches in the county, with
an aggregate total of 4,947 improved acres and
459,005 unimproved acres. These statistics, averaging 26 improved acres and 2,416 unimproved
acres per farm or ranch, reflect the importance at
that time of pastureland over cultivated land. In
addition, there were long-established land incentives in Texas for those farmers who were classed
as stock raisers. In 1860, Hidalgo County recorded 10,695 cattle and 3,330 sheep. The total livestock value in that census year was $109,765.00,
with the value of slaughtered animals recorded at
$10,965.00. These figures are a clear indication
that grazing cattle dominated the local economy
by that time (Garza 2016; Geostat 1998-2004;
Silverthorne 1986:19).

exports from La Sal del Rey. Remarkably, the
Confederate government employed camel caravans – “each camel carrying 600 pounds” – to
“rush” the salt to specified destinations; however,
freight thefts became problematic, resulting in
abandonment of the camel transport endeavor
(Campbell 2010).
Because Federal forces could not blockade
the coast of neutral Mexico, the Lincoln administration directed Major General Nathaniel P.
Banks to break up the trade between Texas and
Mexico. On November 2, 1863, the U.S. Thirteenth Corps landed a 6,000-troop invasion force
at Brazos Santiago, on Brazos Island in southeasternmost Cameron County (southeast of Hidalgo
County). The Confederates evacuated the region
as the Union soldiers moved over the next several
weeks up the coast beyond Corpus Christi to Port
Lavaca and upriver along the Rio Grande past
Brownsville and Edinburgh to Rio Grande City. A
few months later, General Banks withdrew over
half of the Union invasion force in advance of
his spring 1864 Red River Campaign in Louisiana, leaving Federal troops only in the vicinity of
Brownsville and other ports in southeasternmost
Cameron County (Figure 4.2) (Marten 2010).
On April 9, 1865, General Robert E. Lee
surrendered his Confederate forces to General
Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House;
however, the military situation in southern Texas remained unstable. During May 12-13, 1865,
over a month past the surrender of the Confederacy, Union and Confederate forces clashed in the
final land action of the Civil War – the Battle of
Palmito Ranch in southeastern Cameron County.
Although it was a Confederate victory, the win
was pointless because the South already had
surrendered (Hunt 2011; National Park Service
2014).
The Civil War had only an indirect impact on
Hidalgo County. Although hostile actions occurred
in adjacent Cameron County, there is no evidence
of significant military activity in Hidalgo County,
other than troop movements along the Rio Grande
and camp sites along the salt transport routes between La Sal del Rey and the Rio Grande (Figure
4.2) (Garza 2016; McAllen and McAllen 2010).
The county’s major troubles during this period resulted from cattle rustlers and bandit strikes. Since

The Civil War
Concerned over the Union threat to the bordering states of Missouri and Arkansas and convinced that Confederate “success cannot be secured without the assistance of Texas,” Governor
Francis “Frank” R. Lubbock issued a statewide
call to arms in the summer of 1861 (U.S. Secretary of War [OR] 1997, Series I:4:95). Numerous
companies of troops were raised throughout the
state to support the Confederate cause outside
of Texas. According to one historian, “The one
great contribution of Texas to the Southern cause
was men” (Fehrenbach 1991:354). Residents of
Hidalgo County enlisted in various Confederate
units, as well as the 32nd Brigade of Texas State
Troops, a regional volunteer force organized to
defend the home territory (Brothers 2015).
Besides providing men to support “the
Southern cause,” Hidalgo County supplied salt to
the Confederacy. La Sal del Rey was (and still is)
a shallow salt lake located in east-central Hidalgo
County (Figure 4.2). Since at least the eighteenth
century, Spaniards, Mexicans, and Texans had
“mined” and hauled salt blocks or rock salt from
the lake to Mexico – reportedly, the first export of
the region. During the Civil War, the enormous
demand for salt prompted the Texas state government to assume control of the salt operations and

the 1850s, isolation from population centers and
“ineffective law enforcement led to general chaos
and lawlessness, mostly in the form of cattle raids
and shootouts” (Garza 2016). Rustling thrived in
cattle-rich Hidalgo County during the Civil War
– Mexican and Texan rustlers were joined by deserters from both Confederate and Union forces. In
addition, as previously noted, outlaws raided the
Confederate salt caravans. In at least one instance,
“Mexican bandits crossed [the Rio Grande] into
Los Ebanos [in southwestern Hidalgo County],
captured a Confederate wagon train, and killed
three teamsters” (Garza 2016). There probably
were other such incidents during the Civil War,
and the dangers continued after the end of hostilities (Garza 2016).

control of the county by using the pachanga or
block vote, which entailed rounding up men, filling them with food and liquor, and paying their
poll tax” (Garza 2016). It was during this time
that South Texas politicians began using the red
and blue color classification system to identify
political parties as a means “to assist illiterate or
Spanish-speaking voters to use English-language
ballots” (Orozco 2010). Unfortunately, as Republicans – primarily “Anglo farmers, businessmen,
and professionals – mobilized to “clean up” local
politics, their efforts included ending the pachanga system, which resulted in disenfranchising
Hispanic voters and increasing racial strife. In
1890 and again during the late 1920s, U.S. officials had to step in, investigate, and end boss rule
in Hidalgo County (Garza 2016).
Because southernmost Texas had not relied
exclusively on a plantation economy, agriculture
in the region recovered more quickly from the
effects of the Civil War than did other areas of
the South. In 1870, Hidalgo County recorded 75
farms or ranches. In that census year, the majority of the area farms were less than three acres
in size; however, a decade later, large farms and
ranches (over 500 acres) dominated the landscape. The next two decades continued to see a
steady increase in farm and pasture land in the
county. By the turn of the century, the farm/ranch
sizes in Hidalgo County were more balanced. In
1900, the census reported 490 farms and ranches
in the county – 264 farms (the majority) under
50 acres in size and 78 ranches of 1,000 acres or
more (Table 4.1) (Geostat 1998-2004).
Corn was the leading crop in the district after the Civil War, largely due to its usage in livestock feed; however, livestock values, particularly for beef cattle and sheep, far outweighed crop
values in Hidalgo County throughout the last
decades of the nineteenth century. In 1870, the
county reported 18,141 cattle and 11,270 sheep.
Two decades later, the livestock industry reached
its peak, with a record 71,176 cattle and 20,906
sheep, the latter yielding 41,074 pounds of wool
(Garza 2016; Geostat 1998-2004).
Hidalgo County remained thinly populated
through the remainder of the nineteenth century.
In 1870, the county population was recorded at
2,387 – double the count of the 1860 census;

Postbellum Era
Because Hidalgo County experienced no
sustained military campaigns during the Civil
War, the district was spared from the terrible
physical destruction that much of the South endured during the conflict. Nevertheless, the social consequences of the war, such as the losses
in lives and property and the collapsed Southern
economy, were significant here as elsewhere. It
was not until the late nineteenth century that the
regional economy began to recover from the effects of the Civil War (McLean 2017:34).
Conflict and violence were rampant in Hidalgo County during the Reconstruction years.
Many events were politically-motivated as former Confederates and Republicans grappled for
leadership of southern Texas; however, other
incidents apparently occurred due to sheer lawlessness. As one historian has written: “Hidalgo
County had become a haven for outlaws from
both sides of the [Rio Grande] by the middle
of the nineteenth century” (Garza 2016). Cattle
rustling, bandit raids, and Texas/Mexico border
troubles added to the struggle to recover during
this troubled postwar period (Garza 2016; Long
2016).
Hidalgo County also was noted for its turbulent local politics. From the late 1860s through
at least 1930, the county was run by “boss rule.”
The Democratic Party dominated Hidalgo County
politics during much of this period (Anders 2010;
Garza 2016). Political bosses reportedly “kept

*46 of these 47 farms measured under three acres in size

however, except for a few settlements along the
Rio Grande, these residents were scattered across
hundreds of square miles. Through the end of
the century, Hidalgo County maintained a fairly
steady climb in population, reaching a total of
6,837 inhabitants in 1900. Throughout the late
nineteenth century, the populace of this border
county maintained a Hispanic majority, either
Mexican-born or native-born of Mexican ancestry (Geostat 1998-2004).
The sparse population was a factor in the
continued cattle rustling that had plagued Hidalgo County since before the Civil War. After all,
as one historian wrote: “In 1870 rustlers were attracted to a county with 18,141 cattle and 11,270
sheep and a population of only 2,387” (Garza
2016). During the 1870s, the county sheriff “repeatedly wired Washington requesting troops to
curtail cattle rustling and end the ‘Cattle Wars,’
but his efforts were in vain” (Garza 2016). In
1875, the Texas Rangers sent a unit to help stop
the rustlers; however, it wasn’t until the mid1880s that Hidalgo County law officers finally
gained control over the situation (Garza 2016;
McKenna 2013).
By the late nineteenth century, changes in
agriculture were introduced in Hidalgo County.
Farming on a large scale was introduced at this
time. Oranges and other citrus fruits were among
the first successful commercial crops, followed
later by sugarcane and cotton. Political boss and
large landowner John Closner was an advocate
of diversified farming, and he promoted the idea
of irrigation in Hidalgo County. In 1884, he began buying acreage along the Rio Grande for his
San Juan Plantation, which reached 45,000 acres
during the early twentieth century (Garza 2016;
McKenna 2010, 2013). As one biographer has
written:

R. Christopher Goodwin & Associates, Inc.

By 1895 Closner had installed a pumping plant
and constructed a network of canals and laterals for the first irrigation system from the Rio
Grande in the area. .... Closner was the first in
the area to raise alfalfa, of which he had 700
acres flourishing under several cuttings a year;
the first to experiment with tobacco crops; the
first to experiment with sugarcane by crossplanting hybrid cane seed from Mexico with
seed from Louisiana; and the first to experiment
with commercial crops of vegetables, fruits,
melons, and nuts. .... Sugarcane from the plantation won the gold medal at the 1904 Exposition
in St. Louis for the finest sugarcane in the world
[sic throughout] (McKenna 2010).

Closner also raised cotton and bananas on San
Juan Plantation. By 1921, sugarcane had been
phased out as a regional cash crop; however,
citrus fruits, vegetables, and cotton continued
to thrive as commercial crops (McKenna 2010,
2013).
Twentieth Century to the Present
The early twentieth century brought further
changes to Hidalgo County. During the mid1880s, the county seat, Edinburgh, had been
washed away, moved two miles inland, and renamed Hidalgo. The second location also was
flood-prone; therefore, in 1908, the county seat
was transferred again – this time, northward 17
miles to the new community of Chapin, named
for one of its developers. When scandal involved
developer Chapin in 1911, the town was rechristened Edinburg (a spelling variation on the original Edinburgh), and it has remained the governmental seat of Hidalgo County to the present day.
Incidentally, further flooding and changes in the
course of the Rio Grande forced the move of the
town of Hidalgo even farther inland (Garza 2010,
2016; Miller 2010).

Chapter IV: Historical Overview of Hidalgo County, Texas

The most significant event in Hidalgo
County during the early twentieth century probably was the introduction of the railroad. During
1903-1904, the St. Louis, Brownsville & Mexico Railway was constructed between Robstown
(north-central Nueces County) and Brownsville.
Extensions were built over the next several years,
including a branch that extended westward from
Harlingen in Cameron County through the southern Hidalgo County communities of Mission
and Sam Fordyce. In 1912, the railway company
bought the San Antonio & Rio Grande Valley
Railway, a short unincorporated line connecting
the Hidalgo County seat of Edinburg with the
community of San Juan. During 1912-1913, another local rail line, the San Benito & Rio Grande
Valley Railway (completing work started in 1910
by the St. Louis & San Francisco Railroad Company), constructed two disconnected track segments totaling 65 miles through Cameron and
Hidalgo Counties. The latter branch connected to
the St. Louis, Brownsville & Mexico Railway at
Mission, in southwestern Hidalgo County. Both
the St. Louis, Brownsville & Mexico Railway
and the San Benito & Rio Grande Valley Railway
expanded during the early twentieth century, and
they eventually became part of the Missouri Pacific network (Garza 2016; Kalmbach 2000:259262; Werner 2010a, 2010b).
The rail connection to Northern markets
“opened the area for settlement of Midwestern
[and Eastern] farmers …. The new settlers cleared
the land of brush, built extensive irrigation systems and roads, and introduced large-scale truck
farming” (Garza and Long 2016). The settler influx and land boom in South Texas spawned new
towns along the railroads, accompanied by a significant population increase (McLean 2017:38).
An unfortunate consequence, though, was the
escalation of segregated communities in Hidalgo
County, where the majority populace remained of
Hispanic origin. According to one local historian:

McAllen] were fully segregated. .... The wall
between the races became increasingly impenetrable. Between 1912 and 1915 border raids
claimed at least thirty Anglo lives and several
hundred Mexican lives, converted the area into
a combat zone, and brought settlement to a halt.
Though the raiders disrupted lives and stole
cattle, law-enforcement officers were also accused of excessive violence and unjust practices
(Garza 2016).

By the late 1920s, the volatile situation had subsided, settlement had resumed, and, regrettably, “segregation had become the norm” (Garza
2016).
By 1930, beef cattle no longer were the
mainstay of the Hidalgo County economy. Stock
raising – cattle, sheep, and poultry – continued
primarily in northern Hidalgo County; however,
truck farming became the overall agricultural focus of the district. The principal cash crop was
cotton, followed by corn. In 1912, Nebraska native John H. Shary began buying thousands of
acres in Hidalgo County, including most of the
older citrus groves, particularly grapefruit. During the early 1920s, he co-founded the Texas Citrus Fruit Growers Exchange and established the
first commercial citrus packing plant in Hidalgo
County. Shary generally has been credited with
developing the county’s citrus industry (Garza
2016; Hart 2013).
The farmers and ranchers of Hidalgo County were aided by the establishment of irrigation
projects, initiated on a small scale in the Lower
Rio Grande Valley during the late nineteenth century. The development of efficient pumping systems, together with the expansion of rail transport
through the area, contributed to the agricultural
boom in the region after the turn of the century.
The Texas legislature authorized the earliest irrigation districts in 1905, then superseded that law
with a new irrigation act passed in 1913 (Bloodworth and Gillett 2013; Jasinski 2010). Following World War I, irrigation control in the Lower
Rio Grande Valley transferred “from private
companies to publicly owned irrigation districts”
(Knight 2009:8). A number of irrigation companies were established in Hidalgo County during
the early twentieth century, including the Hidalgo Canal Company (1902), the American-Rio
Grande Land & Irrigation Company (1903), the

These [new] settlers, unlike their ranching predecessors, were not willing to adapt to Hispanic
culture and considered themselves superior
to Mexican Americans. Consequently, all the
new towns that developed along the St. Louis,
Brownsville and Mexico Railway during the
first twenty years of the twentieth century [e.g.,

Louisiana-Rio Grande Canal Company (1906),
the Mission Canal Company (1907), and the Edinburg Canal Company (1919). These and several
other private systems constructed between 1902
and 1927 were consolidated into a series of Hidalgo County irrigation districts by 1930 (Knight
2008:31-32).
Although agriculture remained a major local force in the county throughout the twentieth
century, the economic and physical landscape of
the region began to change with the discovery of
oil and natural gas in South Texas. Several major
petroleum fields were developed throughout the
trans-Nueces region during the early twentieth
century; however, production did not reach Hidalgo County until September 1934. Despite the
relatively late development of the industry in the
area, oil production in Hidalgo County has totaled
millions of barrels since the beginning of petroleum exploitation in the region – 134,639,218
barrels as of January 1, 2017. Although not among
the top oil producing counties in Texas, Hidalgo
County ranks fifth in the production of natural
gas. Its 1,300 gas wells produced 5,046,262,538
MCF (thousand cubic feet) during 1993-2017
(Alvarez 2018:326, 649, 651, 654; Garza 2016).
Today, Hidalgo County remains part of a
largely agricultural region. In 2012, the county
reported a majority percentage of its farm acreage as cropland, 58.5 percent, and 31.1 percent
as pastureland. Beef cattle remain important to
the local economy, but goats, sheep, and poultry
also are raised for market. In addition, Hidalgo
County ranked fifteenth in the state in numbers
of bee colonies in 2012. Crop farming has continued to be a significant economic factor, as well.
Principal cash crops today include sorghum for
grain, upland cotton, sugarcane, corn for grain,
vegetables, and citrus fruits. In fact, Hidalgo
County ranked first in the state for harvested vegetable acreage and first in both Texas and the U.S.
for grain sorghum acreage in 2012. In that year,

R. Christopher Goodwin & Associates, Inc.

Hidalgo County also ranked first in the state for
overall crop market value and for sales values of
two commodity groups: vegetables, melons, potatoes, and sweet potatoes; and fruits, nuts, and
berries. In 2012, Hidalgo County rated twelfth
among Texas cotton producing counties, but
dropped to twenty-fifth place in 2017 (Alvarez
2018:326; National Cotton Council of America
2018; USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service 2018).
Besides agribusiness and the petroleum
industry, the Hidalgo County economy has
branched into other enterprises, particularly in
the towns and communities near the Rio Grande.
Major industries include food processing and
shipping, vegetable processing and packing, varied manufacturing, boot-making (in the town of
Mercedes), and mineral operations (besides petroleum) – stone, sand, and gravel. With its Rio
Grande frontage and multiple crossing access
points into Mexico, Hidalgo County has become
an important international trade zone. Relatively
recent exploitation of its cultural and recreational
resources also has brought a thriving tourist industry to the county (Alvarez 2018:326; Garza
2016).
Summary
Hidalgo County is located within a region
traditionally dependent upon agriculture and natural resources. Although the district falls within
lands ranched by Spanish and Mexican settlers
during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
centuries, records indicate that the county remained relatively sparsely settled until the late
twentieth century. Historically, beef cattle and,
later, cotton, citrus, and truck farming were the
economic mainstays of the locale; however, the
twentieth/twenty-first century growth of industries along the Rio Grande has enhanced the modern development of the county.

ackground Research
A review was undertaken to identify all
previously completed cultural resources
investigations, previously recorded archeological
site locations, previously recorded historic standing structures, and cemeteries situated within 1.6
km (1 mi) of the proposed project items (i.e., the
MEXI-STFE Sites 1, 2 and 3). The review, conducted by R. Christopher Goodwin & Associates,
Inc., included examination of the electronic data
stored in the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas Database maintained by the Texas Historical Commission. Three previously recorded archeological
sites, six previously completed cultural resources
surveys, and a single NRHP property were identified within 1.6 km (1.0 mi) of the proposed project
items. Since limited data were available regarding the previously completed archeological surveys, they were cross-checked against the Texas
Historical Commission’s online archeological
abstracts database, which unfortunately provided
very little additional data. In addition, the online
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) database indicated that the project items fall within
the boundary of the Louisiana-Rio Grande Canal
Company Irrigation System National Register
District. A description of these previously identified resources occurs below.

Previously Identified Archeological Sites Situated within 1.6 km (1.0 mi) of the Proposed
Project Areas
Three previously recorded archeological sites were identified within 1.6 km (1 mi)
of the proposed project area. All three of these
sites were prehistoric in age, and were characterized as lithic scatters. Two sites were of an unknown prehistoric affiliation and were described
as destroyed by landscaping activities (41HG40
and 41HG41), while a single site was assigned
an Archaic period affiliation (41HG196). Site
41HG196 was assessed as not eligible for listing
on the National Register of Historic Places, while
the National Register status of Sites 41HG40 and
41HG41 remain undetermined.
Properties Listed on the National Register of
Historic Places Situated within 1.6 km (1.0 mi)
of the Proposed Project Areas
As mentioned above, a portion of the MEXISTFE Sites, 1, 2, and 3 project area lies within the
bounds of the Louisiana-Rio Grande Canal Company Irrigation System National Register District
(see Figures 1.1 and 1.2). The system was constructed between 1910 and 1913 to irrigate approximately 18,211.5 ha (45,000 ac) of farmland
in Hidalgo County. The installation of the system
allowed for further expansion of land formerly
dedicated to ranching, to be converted to viable
farming lands, allowing for the expansion of the
burgeoning citrus industry in southern Texas.
The construction of the First-Lift Pumphouse in
1910, allowed for water to be siphoned from the
Rio Grande River to irrigate previously arid land
via the construction of approximately 100 miles
of canal and 200 miles of drainage ditches. The
newly fertile land attracted an influx of new set-

tlers, leading to the founding and development of
eight new towns throughout the area. While the
system at first was used to irrigate fields of sugar cane, the canals soon fed orange, lemon, and
grapefruit orchards, leading Hidalgo County citrus production to rival that of counties in California and Florida. Hard freezes in 1949 and 1951,
however, severely curtailed the industry, leading
to crop diversification (Meyers and Weitze 1995).
The system was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995, and was determined to be significant under Criterion A at the
state level for its contribution to early twentieth
century farming. Further, the First-Lift Pumphouse was found to be significant under Criterion
C since it represents an outstanding industrial interpretation of Mission Revival architecture and

Phase I Cultural Resources
Survey and Archeological
Inventory Field Methodology

F

ollowing the completion of the background
research summarized in Chapter V, a Phase
I cultural resources survey was completed
of the MEXI-STFE Sites 1, 2, and 3 project areas.
This investigation conformed to survey guidelines promulgated by the Texas Historical Commission and the Council of Texas Archeologists
Guidelines for Cultural Resource Management
Reports, and was based on methodologies that
provided for consistency, quality control, and for
the precise recordation of any cultural resources
that might be identified during survey.
This cultural resources survey was comprehensive in nature and resulted in a thorough examination of each project item. Fieldwork included both on-the-ground inspection and systematic
shovel testing throughout each project item. Within those portions of the proposed pipeline replacement right-of-way characterized as having a high
probability for containing cultural resources, shovel tests were excavated at 50 m (164.0 ft) intervals.
Within areas characterized as having a low probability for containing archeological sites, shovel
tests were excavated at 100 m (328 ft) intervals.
Shovel testing typically occurred along a single
survey transect. Additional, judgmentally placed
shovel tests were excavated in area to ensure complete survey coverage and to test particular landforms that seemed to represent likely locations for
containing archeological sites.
The access roads examined for this project
generally measured approximately 7.6 m (25 ft) in
width. Within the existing roadways, archeological survey consisted of the visual examination of
the entire length and width of each access road.
This investigation also included systematic shovel testing at 100 m (328 ft) intervals in all areas
R. Christopher Goodwin & Associates, Inc.

of the roadbed, except where man-made impediments (i.e., hard-packed gravel fill or subsurface
utilities) prevented shovel testing. Visual reconnaissance encompassed both the road surface and
the sidewall of the road. In all instances, data describing the survey methods employed, changes in
vegetation and topography, evidence of natural or
artificial features, and locational information were
compiled on access road recordation forms.
All excavated shovel tests excavated measured approximately 30 cm (11.8 in) in diameter
and each was excavated to a minimum depth of 50
cm (19.7 in) below surface. Shovel tests were excavated at 50 m (164.0 ft) or 100 m (328 ft) intervals, and all shovel test fill was screened through
0.64 cm (0.25 in) hardware cloth. Each shovel test
was excavated in 10 cm (3.9 in) artificial levels
within natural strata, and the fill from each level
was screened separately. Munsell® Soil Color
Charts were used to record soil color; texture and
other identifiable characteristics were recorded using standard soils nomenclature. All shovel tests
were backfilled immediately upon completion of
the archeological recordation process.
Site Recordation and Delineation
No cultural material or evidence of intact
cultural deposits was identified during survey.
No site delineation was required. Three irrigation
ditches were recorded during the Phase I survey
of the MEXI-STFE Sites 1, 2, and 3 project items.
Each of these items were photographed and GPS
points were taken at each location. While three
irrigation ditches were recorded as a result of this
investigation, only the ditch identified as Locus

ultural resources investigations of the
three pipeline replacement areas that
comprised the MEXI-STFE Sites 1, 2 and

and November 1, 2018. The following sections
are organized by project area (i.e., Sites 1, 2 and

ft) north to a fenceline (Figure 7.1). Vegetation
consisted of a mixture of manicured lawn within
a residential neighborhood and recently mowed
hay field (Figure 7.2). Ground surface visibility
averaged 30 per cent and the entirety of the Site
1 ROW corridor was described as nearly level (0
to 3 per cent slope). Numerous modern houses
and mobile homes were noted within the general
vicinity of Site 1 (Figure 7.3).
Prior to survey, the entirety of Site 1 was
classified as having a low probability for containing cultural resources. Both pedestrian survey
and shovel testing were conducted throughout
this survey segment. Shovel tests were excavated
at 100 m (328 ft) intervals along two parallel survey transects, one transect placed to either side
of the existing ROW. A total of 12 shovel tests
were excavated across this segment and all failed
to produce any cultural material; two shovel tests
could not be excavated due to the presence of
earthen levees.
A typical shovel test profile for Site 1 extended to a depth of 50 cm below surface (cmbs)
(19.7 inbs) and was comprised of a two strata
(Figure 7.4). Stratum I was present from 0-30
cmbs (0-11.8 inbs) and it was characterized as a
dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy clay loam.
Stratum II, a brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, extended from 30-50 cmbs (11.8-19.7 inbs).

MEXI-STFE Site 1
The Phase I cultural resources investigation
of MEXI-STFE Site 1 was completed by RCG&A
on October 30, 2018. This portion of the project
consisted of the examination of 2.3 ha (5.7 ac) of
proposed pipeline abandonments and the associated replacement corridor. Survey resulted in the
examination of one pipeline ROW segment and
associated workspaces, and one temporary extra
workspace (Figure 7.1). Site 1 was located between Curry Road and East Texas Road in eastern
Edinburg, Hidalgo County, Texas. The proposed
pipeline abandonment and replacement corridor
at Site 1 measured 32 meters (104 ft) to 60 meters (198 ft) in width and 589 meters (1932 ft) in
length; it encompassed an area that measured 2.3
ha (5.7 ac) in extent. The temporary extra work
space measured 0.34 ha (0.83 ac) in size. The single cultural resource identified during the survey
of Site 1 was a historic earthen irrigation ditch,
which was designated as Locus 1-01. The survey
items examined for the MEXI-STFE Site 1 are
discussed in more detail below.

Locus 1-01
The single cultural resource identified during the cultural resources survey of the MEXISTFE Site 1 ROW was a historic irrigation
ditch located immediately north of Curve Road
(Figures 7.1 and 7.5). This irrigation ditch was
designated as Locus 1-01; it extended east-west
across both the existing and proposed ROW and
the ditch measured 20 m (67 ft) in width and
approximately 4.5 m (15 ft) in depth. Heavy
machinery was conducting active disturbance/

time the survey was completed. This irrigation
ditch is associated with the NRHP-listed Louisiana-Rio Grande Canal Company Irrigation
System. The proposed construction activities
at the location of the irrigation canal associated
with the NRHP property found along the north
side of Curve Road will entail an in situ replacement of the extant pipeline. A corrugated pipe is
situated underneath the Texas Eastern pipeline
at that location. The fill surrounding the replacement pipeline segment will be excavated, the
pipe cut and removed, and the new pipe placed
within the original trench. The spoil excavated
during the removal of the pipeline segment will
be stored away from the banks of the canal and
within the adjacent project workspace. Once the
pipe is replaced, the trench will be backfilled
and compacted. Flow within the canal will not

will not affect the resource and the area will be
returned to its original appearance, no further
examination of Locus 1-01 is recommended.
Temporary Extra Work Space 1-01
Temporary Extra Work Space 1-01 (TWS
1-01) was located immediately south of Curve
Road and overlapped the proposed pipeline replacement corridor (Segment 1A) that was surveyed concurrently with TWS 1-01 (Figure 7.1).
This irregularly shaped area measured 60 m
(196.9 ft) in width and 107 m (351 ft) in length
and encompassed 0.34 ha (0.83 ac). TWS 1-01
was situated within a recently mowed hay field;
ground surface visibility approximated 30 per
cent (Figure 7.6).

MEXI-STFE Site 2
The Phase I cultural resources investigation
of the MEXI-STFE Site 2 project area consisted
of the examination of 10.8 hectares (26.7 acres)
of a proposed pipeline abandonment and replacement corridor and included two segments of pipeline ROW and associated workspaces, twelve access roads, and one temporary extra work space
(Figure 7.1). MEXI-STFE Site 2 was located
between Brushline Road and Mile 20 Road in
Hidalgo County, Texas. The proposed pipeline
abandonment and replacement corridor at Site 2
was surveyed in two contiguous survey segments
that varied from 32 meters (104 ft) to 70 meters
(229.7 ft) in width and measured 2338 meters
(7670.6 ft) in total length. The twelve access
roads each measured 7.6 m (25 ft) in width but
varied from 11 m (36.1 ft) to 367 m (1204.1 ft) in
length. An additional temporary workspace also

Temporary Extra Work Space 1-01 was
classified as having a low probability for containing cultural materials. Pedestrian survey
was conducted at 10 m (32.8 ft) intervals across
the entirety of TWS 1-01. Additionally, a single
judgmentally placed shovel test was excavated
within TWS 1-01. This shovel test was excavated to a depth of 60 cmbs (23.6 inbs) and
exhibited two strata in profile (Figure 7.7).
Stratum I, from 0 to 40 cmbs (0 to 15.7 inbs),
consisted of a dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2)
sandy clay loam. Stratum II, a brown (10YR
5/3) sandy loam, extended from 40 to 60 cmbs
(15.7 to 23.6 inbs).
No cultural resources were identified during the survey of TWS 1-01 and no cultural
material was recovered. No further examination of Temporary Extra Work Space 1-01 is
recommended.

and adjacent to Segment 2A, i.e., in a residential
neighborhood positioned south of Cove Lane.
Prior to survey, the entirety of Segment 2A
was examined and classified as having a low
probability for cultural resources. This investigation included both pedestrian survey and shovel
testing throughout the limits of the survey segment. Shovel tests were excavated at 100 m (328
ft) intervals along two parallel survey transects,
each transect placed on either side of the existing
ROW. A total of eight shovel tests were excavated within this segment, no cultural material or evidence of intact cultural deposits were identified.
A total of four shovel tests could not be excavated
due to the presence of earthen levees and marked
utilities. A single cultural resource – Locus 2A01, an irrigation ditch, was recorded.

was investigated, it measured 0.22 ha (0.55 ac)
in extent. The single cultural resource identified
during the cultural resources survey of Site 2 was
classified as a historic earthen irrigation ditch and
designated as Locus 2A-01. The survey items for
the MEXI-STFE Site 2 project area are discussed
in more detail below.
Survey Segment 2A
The cultural resources survey of Site 2 included the examination of two survey segments,
designated Segments 2A and 2B. Segment 2A
originated at the southern terminus of the Site 2
ROW at Brushline Road, and it extended 470 m
(1542 ft) north to Cove Lane. Vegetation noted
throughout the segment consisted of a mixture
of manicured lawn within a residential neighborhood, grassland, and mesquite trees (Figure 7.8).
Ground surface visibility averaged 10 per cent and
the entirety of Segment 2A was characterized as

A typical shovel test excavated within Segment 2A was terminated at 55 cmbs (21.7 inbs)
and it exhibited two strata in profile (Figure 7.9).
Stratum I, a brown (10YR 5/3) sand, extended
from 0 to 45 cmbs (0 to 17.7 inbs). Stratum II, a
light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) fine sand, continued from the base of Stratum I to a depth of 55
cmbs (17.7 to 21.7 inbs).

at 100 m (328 ft) intervals for the initial 1381 m
(4531 ft) of the segment, one survey transect placed
to either side of the existing ROW. From 1381 m
(4531 ft) to 1870 m (6135 ft), the ROW passed
through a residential neighborhood positioned
along the east side of Sharp Road. Because the
corridor was located in close proximity to private
homes; survey included pedestrian survey along
transects spaced 5 m (16.4 ft) apart. In addition 13
judgmentally placed shovel tests were excavated
in areas that appeared to retain some integrity. The
existing Texas Eastern pipeline crossed the front
yards of numerous residences, and a number of unmarked utilities were noted in the vicinity of these
residences as evidenced by water spigots, sprinkler
heads, and several utility signs with no accompanying flags or marking paint (Figure 7.13). A total of 39 shovel tests were excavated across this
segment, including 13 judgmentally placed shovel
tests; none of the excavated shoved tests produced
cultural material. Three planned shovel tests could
not be excavated due to disturbance associated
with the installation of roads, utilities, and residences.
A typical shovel test excavated within Segment 2B extended to a maximum depth of 50
cmbs (19.7 inbs) and it exhibited two strata in
profile (Figure 7.14). Stratum I, a yellowish
brown (10YR 5/4) sand, extended from 0-40
cmbs (15.7 inbs). Stratum II, a light yellowish
brown (10YR 6/4) fine sand, continued from 4050 cmbs (15.7-19.7 inbs). No cultural resources
were identified during the survey of Segment 2B.
No further examination of survey Segment 2B is
recommended.

Locus Segment 2A-01
The single cultural resource identified during the cultural resources survey of Site 2, Segment 2A was an irrigation ditch (see Figures 7.1,
7.10). This irrigation ditch was designated as Locus 2A-01; it extended east-west across the existing and proposed ROW and measured 32 m (105
ft) wide and approximately 6.1 m (20 ft) deep.
A modern levee with an associated concrete gate
mechanism was located along the centerline of
the existing Texas Eastern pipeline. A borrow pit
was identified immediately north of Locus 2A01. This irrigation ditch does not appear to be
associated with the NRHP-listed Louisiana-Rio
Grande Canal Company Irrigation System. No
further examination of survey Segment 2A is recommended.
Survey Segment 2B
Survey Segment 2B originated at Cove Lane
and extended 1870 m (6135 ft) north to its terminus within a grassy field. Vegetation noted
throughout the area included a mixture of manicured lawns in a residential neighborhood, grassland, mesquite trees, and orange trees (Figure
7.11). Ground surface visibility varied but averaged approximately 30 per cent. The entirety of
Segment 2B was characterized as nearly level (0
to 3 per cent slope). Numerous modern houses
and mobile homes were observed in the vicinity
of Segment 2B; residential neighborhoods were
present near both the origin and terminus of this
portion of the Site 2 ROW (Figure 7.12). Additionally, modern irrigation features were noted
immediately west of Sharp Road.
Prior to survey, the entirety of Segment 2B
was examined and classified as having a low probability for cultural resources. Both pedestrian survey and shovel testing was conducted throughout
this survey segment. Shovel tests were excavated

Access Road 2-1
Access Road 2-1 (Site 2-AR01) was situated along the southern end of the Site 2 project
item. The access road consisted of an existing dirt
two-track road situated along the southern levee
of the irrigation ditch designated as Locus 2A-01.
Access Road 2-01 originated at Brushline Road
and terminated 36 m (118 ft) east of the existing
Texas Eastern pipeline ROW. Vegetation in the
vicinity of the access road consisted mainly of
grasses. Ground surface visibility approximated
50 per cent and slope was described as nearly
level (0 to 3 per cent) (Figure 7.15).

Survey Segment 3A
Survey Segment 3A originated at the southern end of the Site 3 ROW and extended 447 m
(1466.5 ft) north to Highway 2812. The corridor
width for Segment 3A ranged from 32 m (104 ft)
to 70 m (229.7 ft). Vegetation consisted of grassland and mesquite trees (Figure 7.31). Ground
surface visibility averaged 10 per cent along the
entirety of Segment 3A and slope was described
as nearly level (0 to 3 per cent).
Prior to survey, the entirety of Segment 3A
was characterized as having a low probability for
cultural materials. Both pedestrian survey and
shovel testing were conducted throughout this
survey segment. Shovel tests were excavated at
100 m (328 ft) intervals along two parallel survey
transects, with one transect placed to either side
of the existing ROW. A total of 10 shovel tests
were excavated across this segment. None of the

of Segment 3B along survey transects spaced
4m (16.4 ft) apart; no shovel tests were excavated in this portion of the segment due to modern
residences and numerous unmarked utility lines.
Multiple septic systems and water lines were observed with no accompanying flags or marking
paint. From 270 to 400 m (886 to 1312 ft), shovel
test were excavated at 100 meter (328 ft) intervals along two survey transects, with one transect
placed to either side of the existing ROW. Shovel
tests excavated in the vicinity of Site 41HG196
were spaced 50 m (164 ft) apart (from 400 to 800
m along this survey transect). This previously reported site was located approximately 100 m (328
ft) west of the proposed project corridor (Figure
7.1, Sheet 7). From 800 to 1171 m (2625 to 3842
ft), shovel tests were excavated at 100 m (328 ft)
intervals across a recently plowed agricultural
field and through a small mesquite forest. A total
of 31 shovel tests were excavated within Segment

mixture of manicured lawn and species common
to fallow agricultural fields. Ground surface visibility varied according to vegetation and ranged
from 30 to 95 per cent (Figure 7.33). Slope along
the entirety of Segment 3B was nearly level (0 to
3 per cent slope). Numerous modern residences
and mobile homes were observed in the vicinity
of the Site 3 ROW within Segment 3B.
Prior to survey, the majority of Segment 3B
was characterized as having a low probability for
containing cultural resources due to the presence
of residential structures and subsurface utilities
within the area. A portion of the proposed ROW
was in close proximity to previously reported
prehistoric Site 41HG196; this area was assigned
a high probability for containing cultural resources. Pedestrian survey augmented by shovel
testing was conducted throughout this portion of
the survey segment. Pedestrian survey was conducted along the southern-most 270 m (886 ft)

Summary and Management Recommendations
In all, 21.6 ha (54.1 ac) were investigated for
the presence of cultural resources prior to initiating construction within the proposed Texas Eastern Transmission, LP, Sites 1, 2, and 3 MEXI-STFE Project items, in Hidalgo County, Texas. The
project entailed examination of 4.5 km (2.8 mi)
of pipeline replacement as well as 0.6 ha (1.4 ac)
of additional temporary workspace and 1.5 km
(0.9 mi) of project access roads. A total of 105
shovel tests were excavated, and three cultural
resources loci were identified.
The MEXI-STFE Site 1 project item measured 2.6 ha (6.54 ac) in extent. Survey included
a combination of pedestrian survey and systematic shovel testing throughout the limits of the
proposed project item. In all, 13 shovel tests were
excavated and one cultural resource was identified. Locus 1-01 was a historic earthen irrigation
ditch associated with the NRHP-listed LouisianaRio Grande Canal Company Irrigation System
district resource. Because construction activities planned in the vicinity of this resource are
not anticipated to impact the irrigation ditch, no
additional investigation of the irrigation ditch or
the proposed MEXI-STFE Site 1 Pipeline Project
area is recommended.
For the MEXI-STFE Site 2 portion of the
MEXI-STFE pipeline project, 10.8 hectares (26.7
acres) were surveyed for cultural resources. This
investigation included pedestrian survey and systematic shovel testing throughout the limits of the
proposed project item. The survey effort included the excavation of 47 shovel tests within the
MEXI-STFE Site 2 project items and one cultural
resource was identified. Locus 2-01, an irrigation
ditch, does not appear to be associated with the
NRHP-listed Louisiana-Rio Grande Canal Company Irrigation System. No additional investiga-

Locus 3B-01
The single cultural resource identified during the survey of Segment 3B was an earthen irrigation ditch located 22 m (72 ft) east of Access
Road 3-01 (Figure 7.35). This cultural resource
was designated as Locus 3B-01; it extended east
22 m (72 ft) from the access road and measured
8.5 m (27.9 ft) in width and approximately 3
m (9.8 ft) in depth in the vicinity of the project
area. Locus 3B-01 does not appear to be associated with the NRHP-listed Louisiana-Rio Grande
Canal Company Irrigation System; further, it
appears to be actively maintained and a large
amount of modern trash was observed within the
vicinity of this agricultural feature. No further examination of the Segment 3B or Locus 3B-01 is
recommended.
Access Road 3-1
Access Road 3-1 (Site 3-AR01) consisted of
an existing dirt two-track road that extended 312
m (1023.6 ft) north from the east end of Jackpot
Boulevard (Figure 7.36). Vegetation noted in the
vicinity of this access road included grasses and
species common to fallow agricultural fields. The
entirety of Site 3-AR01 was described as nearly
level (0 to 3 per cent slope); the access road measured 7.6 meters (25 ft) in width.
Prior to survey, Access Road 3-1 was characterized as having a low probability for containing cultural resources. A total of four shovel tests
were excavated at 100 meter (328 ft) intervals to
test thoroughly this portion of the project. None
of the excavated shovel tests produced cultural
