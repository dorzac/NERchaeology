Projects on General Land Office Property in Reeves County, Texas

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

During the 2016 calendar year, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon)
conducted intensive cultural resources surveys for 26 proposed Anadarko Petroleum
Corporation (Anadarko) projects located on property owned by the Texas General Land Office
(GLO) in Reeves County, Texas (Project Areas). These projects included well pads, access
roads, and pipeline rights-of-way (ROW). All 26 projects were privately funded and did not
require any federal permitting or coordination. However, as the GLO is considered to be a
political subdivision of the state, the portions of the 26 projects on GLO property all fell under
the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). At the request of Whitenton Group, Inc.
(Whitenton), Horizon conducted the cultural resources surveys of the Project Areas on behalf of
Anadarko in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the surveys was to determine if any
archeological sites were located within the 26 Project Areas and, if any existed, to determine if
the projects had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for
formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). The cultural resources surveys were
conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) annual permit number 7646.
The cultural resources surveys of the 26 Project Areas resulted in the documentation of
3 new archeological sites (41RV96, 41RV97, and 41RV107). Site 41RV96 was documented as
a historic-era debris scatter on Anadarko’s Block 3 Header System Gas Pipeline ROW and
Sawback Surface Site project. This site appeared to represent several distinct dumping
episodes rather than a homestead or farmstead. Because the materials composing site
41RV96 extended beyond the boundaries of the Project Area, the full extent of the site was not
assessed. However, based on (1) the surficial nature of the observed cultural deposits; (2) the
lack of buried, stratified cultural deposits; and (3) the assessment that the materials represented
an early to mid-20th-century refuse dump, it was Horizon’s opinion that the portion of site
41RV96 within the Project Area was a noncontributing element to the overall SAL eligibility
status of the site. With this in mind, Horizon recommended that no additional investigations
were warranted on site 41RV96 in connection with the Block 3 Header System Gas Pipeline
ROW and Sawback Surface Site project. The Texas Historical Commission (THC) concurred
with this assessment on 19 May 2016.
Site 41RV97 was documented as an extensive prehistoric lithic procurement area on
Anadarko’s Block C19-22 to C19-20 Jumper Gas Pipeline ROW project. This site was
evidenced by an abundance of tested lithic cobbles, cores, and flaking debris. Because the

Management Summary

materials composing site 41RV97 extended beyond the boundaries of the Project Area, the full
extent of the site was not assessed. However, based on (1) the surficial nature of the observed
cultural deposits; (2) the lack of buried, stratified cultural deposits; and (3) the lack of any
temporally diagnostic materials on the site, it was Horizon’s opinion that the portion of site
41RV97 within the Project Area was a noncontributing element to the overall SAL eligibility
status of the site. With this in mind, Horizon recommended that no additional investigations
were warranted on site 41RV97 in connection with the Block C19-22 to C19-20 Jumper Gas
Pipeline ROW project. The THC concurred with this assessment on 19 May 2016.
Finally, site 41RV107 was documented as a prehistoric campsite on Anadarko’s
Shoshoni 55-4-43 Gas Pipeline ROW project. This site was evidenced by an abundance of
surficial lithic flaking debris as well as buried fire-cracked rock (FCR) and preserved, charred
floral remains. While the site initially appeared to possess the ability to answer certain
questions about the prehistory of the area, it was unclear how widespread the subsurface
deposits extended across the site, and the vertical integrity of the deposits had not been
determined. With this in mind, it was Horizon’s opinion that the SAL eligibility status of site
41RV107 was undetermined and that additional SAL testing investigations were necessary to
formally determine its SAL eligibility status. In order to avoid and protect the deposits on site
41RV107, Anadarko indicated that they intended to install the proposed pipeline beneath the
north/south limits of the site via a horizontal directional drill (HDD). To ensure the site’s
protection, Horizon prepared an Avoidance Plan that included the use of an on-site
archeological monitor during all construction activities in the immediate vicinity of site 41RV107.
The THC concurred with the site assessment and Avoidance Plan on 7 November 2016.
The cultural resources surveys conducted on the remaining 23 projects all produced
negative results. Based on the negative survey results, it was Horizon’s opinion that the
construction of the remaining 23 projects would have no adverse effect on significant cultural
resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs. Horizon therefore
recommended that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the construction of these projects
relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. The THC concurred with these recommendations.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of intensive cultural resources surveys conducted
during the 2016 calendar year for 26 proposed Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko)
projects located on property owned by the Texas General Land Office (GLO) in Reeves County,
Texas (Project Areas) (Figure 1-1). All 26 projects were privately funded and did not require
any federal permitting or coordination. However, as the GLO is considered to be a political
subdivision of the state, the portions of the 26 projects on GLO property fell under the
regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). At the request of Whitenton Group, Inc.
(Whitenton), Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted the cultural resources
survey of the Project Areas on behalf of Anadarko in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of
the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the 26 Project Areas
and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any adverse impacts on
sites considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). The
cultural resources surveys were conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) annual
permit number 7646.
The 26 Anadarko projects assessed by Horizon in 2016 included well pads, access
roads, and pipeline rights-of-way (ROW) that were located in whole or in part on tracts of land
owned by the GLO. Only the portions of each project situated on GLO land were assessed
under TAC annual permit number 7646. These included the entirety of certain projects and only
portions of others. Each of the 26 projects is listed in Table 1-1 along with its map identifier in
Figure 1-1. The individual interim reports prepared for each project, as well as the individual
responses from the Texas Historical Commission (THC) are presented in Appendix A.
The cultural resources investigations for each of the 26 projects consisted of an initial
archival review, an intensive cultural resources survey of each Project Area, the production of
interim reports submitted for review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), and the
production of a final report for review by the SHPO in accordance with the THC’s Rules of
Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA)
Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Russell Brownlow (Horizon’s cultural
resources director) served as the project’s principal investigator, while Stefan Barker, Jacob
Lyons, Samuel McLellan, Andrew Milam Briana Smith, and Jared Wiersema conducted the field
investigations at various times in 2016.

The cultural resources surveys of the 26 Project Areas resulted in the documentation of
3 new archeological sites (41RV96, 41RV97, and 41RV107). Site 41RV96 was documented as
a historic-era debris scatter on Anadarko’s Block 3 Header System Gas Pipeline ROW and
Sawback Surface Site project. This site appeared to represent several distinct dumping
episodes rather than a homestead or farmstead. Because the materials composing site
41RV96 extended beyond the boundaries of the Project Area, the full extent of the site was not
assessed. However, based on (1) the surficial nature of the observed cultural deposits; (2) the
lack of buried, stratified cultural deposits; and (3) the assessment that the materials represented
an early to mid-20th-century refuse dump, it was Horizon’s opinion that the portion of site

Chapter 1.0: Introduction

41RV96 within the Project Area was a noncontributing element to the overall SAL eligibility
status of the site. With this in mind, Horizon recommended that no additional investigations
were warranted on site 41RV96 in connection with the Block 3 Header System Gas Pipeline
ROW and Sawback Surface Site project. The THC concurred with this assessment on 19 May
2016.
Site 41RV97 was documented as an extensive prehistoric lithic procurement area on
Anadarko’s Block C19-22 to C19-20 Jumper Gas Pipeline ROW project. This site was
evidenced by an abundance of tested lithic cobbles, cores, and flaking debris. Because the
materials composing site 41RV97 extended beyond the boundaries of the Project Area, the full
extent of the site was not assessed. However, based on (1) the surficial nature of the observed
cultural deposits; (2) the lack of buried, stratified cultural deposits; and (3) the lack of any
temporally diagnostic materials on the site, it was Horizon’s opinion that the portion of site
41RV97 within the Project Area was a noncontributing element to the overall SAL eligibility
status of the site. With this in mind, Horizon recommended that no additional investigations
were warranted on site 41RV97 in connection with the Block C19-22 to C19-20 Jumper Gas
Pipeline ROW project. The THC concurred with this assessment on 19 May 2016.
Finally, site 41RV107 was documented as a prehistoric campsite on Anadarko’s
Shoshoni 55-4-43 Gas Pipeline ROW project. This site was evidenced by an abundance of
surficial lithic flaking debris as well as buried fire-cracked rock (FCR) and preserved, charred
floral remains. While the site initially appeared to possess the ability to answer certain
questions about the prehistory of the area, it was unclear how widespread the subsurface
deposits extended across the site, and the vertical integrity of the deposits had not been
determined. With this in mind, it was Horizon’s opinion that the SAL eligibility status of site
41RV107 was undetermined and that additional SAL testing investigations were necessary to
formally determine its SAL eligibility status. In order to avoid and protect the deposits on site
41RV107, Anadarko indicated that they intended to install the proposed pipeline beneath the
north/south limits of the site via a horizontal directional drill (HDD). To ensure the site’s
protection, Horizon prepared an Avoidance Plan that included the use of an on-site
archeological monitor during all construction activities in the immediate vicinity of site 41RV107.
The THC concurred with the site assessment and Avoidance Plan on 7 November 2016.
The cultural resources surveys conducted on the remaining 23 projects all produced
negative results. Based on the negative survey results, it was Horizon’s opinion that the
construction of the remaining 23 projects would have no adverse effect on significant cultural
resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs. Horizon therefore
recommended that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the construction of these projects
relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials
(including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during
construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the various Project Areas, even in previously
surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should cease immediately, and the
THC and GLO should be notified of the discovery. The THC concurred with these
recommendations.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

The 26 Anadarko projects on GLO land that were assessed in 2016 are all located in
northwestern and north-central Reeves County, Texas. Several are located in the vicinity of
Orla, Texas, and can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute Orla and Orla
SE, Texas, topographic quadrangles. The majority are located southwest of Mentone, Texas,
on the USGS 7.5-minute Anderson Ranch, Halamicek Ranch, Mentone SW, and Sand Lake,
Texas, topographic quadrangles (see Figure 1-1; also see individual interim reports in
Appendix A). The 26 projects include 19 pipeline/flowline ROWs and 7 well pads with
associated access road ROWs. Each of these 26 projects are summarized in Table 2-1.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The 26 Project Areas are located within desert settings in West Texas. They are
typically found in relatively flat to gently undulating desert hills that are dissected by a variety of
drainages and draws, including Arroyo Bonito, Horsehead Draw, Smith Draw, Halamicek Draw,
and tributaries of the Pecos River. Representative images of the Project Areas are presented in
Figures 2-1 through 2-4.
Hydrologically, all 26 of the Project Areas are situated within the Pecos River basin. All
are located to the west or southwest of the Pecos River and are drained to the east or northeast
by the various water channels listed above.

2.3

CLIMATE

Winters in Reeves County are generally cool, with an average temperature of
46.0 degrees Fahrenheit (°F). The summer months are hot, with an average temperature of
83.0°F. The average annual total precipitation is about 8.6 inches (21.8 centimeters [cm]), with
roughly 70% of it falling between April and September (NRCS 1980).

2.4

FLORA AND FAUNA

The 26 Project Areas are located in the Chihuahuan Biotic Province, which includes all
of Trans-Pecos Texas except for the Guadalupe Mountains (Blair 1950). Blair notes that

portions of Culberson and the surrounding counties were once part of an old bolson now
drained by the Pecos River. Also located within the Chihuahuan Basins and Playas of the
Chihuahuan Deserts ecoregion, the Project Areas are situated on geologic formations
comprised of sand sheet and caliche deposits (Griffith et al. 2007). Three native plant
communities dominate the Chihuahuan Basins and Playas: saline flats and alkaline playa
margins, gypsum land, and desert shrubland. The dominant species associated with the saline
flats and alkaline playa margins plant community include fourwing saltbush (Atriplex
canescens), seepweed (Suaeda spp.), pickleweed (Salicornia spp.), and alkali sacaton
(Sporobolus airoides). The dominant species associated with the gypsum land plant community
include gypsum grama (Bouteloua breviseta), blazingstar (Mentzelia spp.), and Torrey’s jointfir
(Ephedra torreyana). The dominant species associated with the desert shrubland plant
community include creosote bush (Larrea tridentate), American tarwort (Flourensia cernua),
yucca (Yucca spp.), sand sagebrush (Artemisia filifolia), blackbrush (Acacia rigidula), Christmas
cactus (Cylindropuntia leptocaulis), lechuguilla (Agave lechuguilla), and cenizo (Leucophyllum

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The general temporal framework for most prehistoric archeological sites in Texas is
based on the seriation of projectile point types originally established by Suhm et al. (1954) and
later revised by Suhm and Jelks (1962), Prewitt (1981, 1985), and Turner and Hester (1999).
This temporal framework, consisting of a tri-partite system based on technological changes in
diagnostic artifacts that occurred as a result of indigenous adaptation to changing environments
and subsistence strategies, is broken down into 3 main periods: PaleoIndian (pre-8500 BP),
Archaic (8500 to 1250 BP), and Late Prehistoric (1250 to 250 BP). The Archaic period is further
subdivided into the Early Archaic (8500 to 6000 BP), the Middle Archaic (6000 BP to 3500 BP),
and the Late Archaic (3500 to 1250 BP) subperiods.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN (PRE-8500 BP)

The PaleoIndian period is characterized by highly mobile groups hunting over large
areas. Although now-extinct megafauna, such as mammoth and bison, are often found
associated with sites of this time period, smaller game, such as deer and turtles, were also likely
utilized as food items. Undoubtedly, plant foods made up a portion of the diet as well. Based
upon the low number of diagnostic artifacts recovered from sites of this period, as well as the
low frequency of sites, population densities are considered low and probably consisted of small
family groups. An increase in projectile point frequency toward the end of the period may
suggest an increased population density or, perhaps, an increase in macro-band aggregation
for the purpose of communal hunts. Sites from this time period are found mostly in upland
tributary and spring settings, as well as deeply buried in floodplain alluvium. Clovis and Folsom
points are indicative of Early PaleoIndian occupations, while Plainview, Golondrina, Scottsbluff,
Meserve, Eden, Dalton, San Patrice, and Angostura points are characteristic of the later span of
the period.

3.2

EARLY ARCHAIC (8500 TO 6000 BP)

Like the PaleoIndian period, Early Archaic population densities remained low, still
consisting of small, mobile bands. However, a more generalized hunting-and-gathering strategy
is evidenced by the use of river mussels. Early Archaic sites are typically located on terraces
along tributary watercourses, but are also often found deeply buried in floodplain alluvium. Site
locale and an increased use of river mussels possibly indicate a shift in subsistence strategies

in order to exploit the bottomlands of major waterways during this period of wetter climates.
Split-stemmed points such as Gower, Martindale, and Uvalde, as well as Big Sandy, Hardin,
and Hoxie, are diagnostic of Early Archaic occupations.

3.3

MIDDLE ARCHAIC (6000 TO 3500 BP)

During the Middle Archaic, the trend to bottomland exploitation increased, with fewer
sites found along minor tributaries. Population density remained relatively low, but obviously
increased over prior periods with broad-spectrum hunting and gathering represented at larger
sites where food sources were more abundant.

3.4

LATE ARCHAIC (3500 TO 1250 BP)

In contrast to earlier time periods, the Late Archaic represents a period of increased
population and site density. Subsistence is focused on hunting and gathering within the
bottomlands of major creeks and rivers. Deer remains are quite common at Late Archaic sites,
and the exploitation of plant foods (nuts) seems to have increased during this period, based
upon an increase in plant-processing tools. Late Archaic sites are typically found on sandy
terraces along tributaries as well as on clayey floodplains.

3.5

LATE PREHISTORIC (1250 TO 250 BP)

The Late Prehistoric, in general, is characterized by the advent of the bow and arrow, as
well as ceramics, in Texas. Hunting and gathering continued with an emphasis on deer and
other small game. Horticulture also becomes evident in some areas. As in the Late Archaic,
sites continue to be located on sandy terraces along major creeks and rivers. In fact, the
majority of Late Prehistoric sites contain some traces of Late Archaic occupations. A marked
population increase is evident, and increased territorial conflicts possibly explain the recovery of
burials with indications of violent deaths. Furthermore, differentiated burial practices also
suggest the development of non-egalitarian societies.

3.6

HISTORIC (250 BP TO PRESENT)

The history of Reeves County is not well documented due to its remoteness and low
population. The Antonio de Espejo expedition was one of the first Spanish expeditions to cross
into West Texas. According to Smith (2017), this expedition encountered a group of 3 Jumano
Indians near Toyah Lake in eastern Reeves County in 1853. The Jumanos are said to have
irrigated crops of peaches and corn near Balmorhea (Smith 2017). Later visitors to the region
noted groups of Mescalero Indians growing corn along Toyah Creek. It wasn’t until the 1870s
that the first Anglo farmers and ranchers began to settle the area.
Named for Confederate colonel George R. Reeves, Reeves County separated from
Pecos County in 1883 and was organized 1884. Around the turn of the 20th century, state law
permitted sale of school lands in West Texas. This led to a rush of new settlers in the region.
By 1910, the population of the county had doubled to 4,392, with most residents living in the
numerous small towns that had sprung up, including Orla and Balmorhea, which were the only

2 towns with remaining post offices in the 1990s (Smith 2017). The 1920s and 1930s saw the
expansion of oil exploration in the region, and the population increased to 6,407 residents. By
the 1990s, the Reeves County economy was primarily based on oil and agriculture. In the early
2000s, the population had increased to 14,349.

4.0 METHODOLOGY

4.1

DATABASE AND MAP REVIEW

Prior to all field survey efforts, a Horizon archeologist conducted archival research via
the Internet on the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) website and via the National
Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer to
ascertain the number, type, and significance of any previously recorded archeological sites,
cemeteries, and historic properties within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of each of the 26 Project
Areas. Given the remoteness of the Project Areas and the general lack of prior surveys in the
area, most of the 26 Project Areas had no documented cultural resources within the 1.0-mile
(1.6 km) review perimeters. The results of the archival research conducted for each of the
26 projects is presented within the associated interim reports in Appendix A.

4.2

FIELD METHODS

A 2- to 3-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed each of the 26 separate
Project Areas at various times in 2016. The survey efforts typically entailed intensive surface
inspection and subsurface shovel testing within each Project Area. For projects between
3.0 and 10.0 acres in size, which includes most of the well pads, the Texas State Minimum
Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 2 shovel tests per acre. For
linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide, which included all of the assessed
pipeline and access road ROWs, the TSMASS require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile.
Horizon met or exceeded the TSMASS on all of the 26 Project Areas. The number of shovel
tests excavated within each Project Area is presented in Table 4-1. The specific methodology
for each of the 26 projects is presented within the associated interim reports in Appendix A. All
excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.3-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or
were trowel-sorted if the dense clay soils prohibited successful screening.
For each project, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms,
shovel tests, and cultural materials observed (if any). Standardized shovel test forms were
completed for every shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and
notations on any artifacts encountered. For any new archeological sites recorded, standard site
forms were completed and filed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) for
permanent housing. Similarly, for any previously recorded archeological sites that were
assessed, updated site forms were completed and filed at the TARL.

A selective collection strategy was utilized during the survey efforts wherein only
diagnostic cultural materials were to be collected for eventual curation at an approved facility.
Non-diagnostic artifacts were to be tabulated and assessed in the field and placed back where
they were found. Digital photographs with a photo log were also completed as appropriate. The
locations of all shovel tests were recorded via handheld global positioning system (GPS) units
utilizing the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system and the North American

5.0 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The cultural resources survey of the 26 Project Areas resulted in the documentation of
3 new archeological sites (41RV96, 41RV97, and 41RV107). The results for each of the
26 separate Project Areas are summarized in Table 5-1. Formal site descriptions, maps, and
other relevant data are presented within the individual interim reports prepared for each of the
26 projects in Appendix A.
The cultural resources surveys of the 26 Project Areas resulted in the documentation of
3 new archeological sites (41RV96, 41RV97, and 41RV107). Site 41RV96 was documented as
a historic-era debris scatter on Anadarko’s Block 3 Header System Gas Pipeline ROW and
Sawback Surface Site project. This site appeared to represent several distinct dumping
episodes rather than a homestead or farmstead. Because the materials composing site
41RV96 extended beyond the boundaries of the Project Area, the full extent of the site was not
assessed. However, based on (1) the surficial nature of the observed cultural deposits; (2) the
lack of buried, stratified cultural deposits; and (3) the assessment that the materials represented
an early to mid-20th-century refuse dump, it was Horizon’s opinion that the portion of site
41RV96 within the Project Area was a noncontributing element to the overall SAL eligibility
status of the site. With this in mind, Horizon recommended that no additional investigations
were warranted on site 41RV96 in connection with the Block 3 Header System Gas Pipeline
ROW and Sawback Surface Site project. The THC concurred with this assessment on 19 May
2016.
Site 41RV97 was documented as an extensive prehistoric lithic procurement area on
Anadarko’s Block C19-22 to C19-20 Jumper Gas Pipeline ROW project. This site was
evidenced by an abundance of tested lithic cobbles, cores, and flaking debris. Because the
materials composing site 41RV97 extended beyond the boundaries of the Project Area, the full
extent of the site was not assessed. However, based on (1) the surficial nature of the observed
cultural deposits; (2) the lack of buried, stratified cultural deposits; and (3) the lack of any
temporally diagnostic materials on the site, it was Horizon’s opinion that the portion of site
41RV97 within the Project Area was a noncontributing element to the overall SAL eligibility
status of the site. With this in mind, Horizon recommended that no additional investigations
were warranted on site 41RV97 in connection with the Block C19-22 to C19-20 Jumper Gas
Pipeline ROW project. The THC concurred with this assessment on 19 May 2016.

Finally, site 41RV107 was documented as a prehistoric campsite on Anadarko’s
Shoshoni 55-4-43 Gas Pipeline ROW project. This site was evidenced by an abundance of
surficial lithic flaking debris as well as buried FCR and preserved, charred floral remains. While
the site initially appeared to possess the ability to answer certain questions about the prehistory
of the area, it was unclear how widespread the subsurface deposits extended across the site,
and the vertical integrity of the deposits had not been determined. With this in mind, it was
Horizon’s opinion that the SAL eligibility status of site 41RV107 was undetermined and that
additional SAL testing investigations were necessary to formally determine its SAL eligibility
status. In order to avoid and protect the deposits on site 41RV107, Anadarko indicated that
they intended to install the proposed pipeline beneath the north/south limits of the site via a
horizontal directional drill (HDD). To ensure the site’s protection, Horizon prepared an
Avoidance Plan that included the use of an on-site archeological monitor during all construction
activities in the immediate vicinity of site 41RV107. The THC concurred with the site
assessment and Avoidance Plan on 7 November 2016.
The cultural resources surveys conducted on the remaining 23 projects all produced
negative results. Based on the negative survey results, it was Horizon’s opinion that the
construction of the remaining 23 projects would have no adverse effect on significant cultural
resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs. Horizon therefore
recommended that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the construction of these projects
relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials
(including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during
construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the various Project Areas, even in previously
surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should cease immediately, and the
THC and GLO should be notified of the discovery. The THC concurred with these
recommendations.
