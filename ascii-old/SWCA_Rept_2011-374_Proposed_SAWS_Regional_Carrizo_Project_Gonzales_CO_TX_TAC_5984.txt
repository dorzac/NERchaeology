ABSTRACT
SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted an intensive cultural resource survey of the Regional Carrizo Project (RCP) Buckhorn Supply pipeline on behalf of Black & Veatch Corporation (B&V)
and the San Antonio Water System (SAWS) in Gonzales County, Texas. The proposed RCP Buckhorn
Supply pipeline would run in a generally east-to-west direction beginning east-northeast of Smiley, Texas
and terminate due north of Nixon. The proposed project corridor traverses nearly exclusively privatelyowned agricultural lands in a rural setting. The SAWS RCP Buckhorn Supply pipeline is a long-term water supply project that will help provide water from the Carrizo Aquifer in portions of Gonzales County
and eventually into Bexar County. As defined by current construction plans, the proposed project area
consists of a 60–120-foot corridor centered on the roughly 8-mile long RCP pipeline. Thus, the Area of
Potential Effects (APE) is 8.1-miles long, 120-feet wide, and nine feet deep for a total area of 117.81
acres. Notably, concurrence for this project was given by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) on
November 5, 2011. Subsequent to this concurrence, several reroutes were added to the project, which
was investigated and reported upon in the two addendums to this report. The addendum reports located in
Appendices B and C of this document received THC concurrence on February 2013 and August 2012,
respectively.
Work was done to comply with the Antiquities Code of Texas due to SAWS’ status as a political subdivision of the State of Texas. Additionally, investigations were performed to satisfy anticipated application
requirements for a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)-Fort Worth District, Section 404 permit in
accordance with 33 Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) Part 325, Appendix C. As such, the investigations
were to identify all historic or prehistoric cultural resources located within the proposed RCP Supply
Pipeline alignment, establish vertical and horizontal site boundaries as appropriate within the project area,
and evaluate the significance and eligibility of any site recorded for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) or for designation as a State Archaeological Landmark (SAL). Work was conducted in accordance with the guidelines set forth by the Council of Texas Archeologists (1995) and under the terms and conditions of Texas Antiquities Permit #5984 with Ken Lawrence acting as Principal
Investigator.
Investigations included a background literature and records review and an intensive pedestrian survey
with subsurface investigations. The background literature review determined that a previously conducted
linear survey intersects the proposed RCP Buckhorn Supply pipeline three times east of State Highway
(SH) 80, and that no previously recorded archaeological sites are within the APE.
The field survey included 126 shovel tests placed in areas that had the highest potential for containing
buried cultural materials with good integrity. Investigations determined that much of the APE contains
extensive prior disturbances, which include grading and clearing associated with agricultural land modification, numerous roadways, buried and overhead utilities, and constructing fences. No cultural material
was encountered in any subsurface investigation and, besides those artifacts associated with site 41GZ235
or isolated brick fragments, none were observed on the surface of the APE.
One archaeological site (41GZ235) was identified during the cultural resource survey, which is an historic
agricultural complex containing 1940–1950s-era activities. This site contains various features (e.g., water
wells and windmill foundations) and debris associated with mid-twentieth century ranching. SWCA evaluated site 41GZ235 according to the criteria in 36 CFR 60.4, specifically, Criterion D. SWCA recommends that site 41GZ235 is not eligible for listing on the NRHP. Likewise, the site is not recommended
eligible for designation as an SAL, and SWCA recommends no further work at this location. No artifacts
were collected during this survey; therefore, none was curated.

i

In accordance with 33 CFR 800.4, SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify archaeological historic properties within the survey area portion of the APE. As no properties were identified
that may meet the criteria for listing in the NRHP according to 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as an SAL,
according to 13 TAC 26.12, SWCA recommends no further archaeological work within the proposed
APE.

This study consisted of a background literature review followed by intensive pedestrian inspection.
The purpose of the background review was to determine if the project area has been previously
surveyed for cultural resources or if any archaeological sites have been recorded within or near the
project area. Pedestrian inspection supplemented
with shovel testing was then conducted along the
entire alignment. These investigations were to
identify all historic or prehistoric cultural resources located within the proposed RCP Buckhorn Supply pipeline, establish vertical and horizontal site boundaries as appropriate within the
project area, and evaluate the significance and eligibility of any site recorded for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for
designation as a State Archaeological Landmark
(SAL). SWCA’s investigations were performed in
compliance with the Texas Antiquities Code and
the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of
1966, as amended through 1992. Work was conducted in accordance with the guidelines set forth
by the Council of Texas Archeologists (1995) and
under the terms and conditions of Texas Antiquities Permit #5984 with Ken Lawrence acting as
Principal Investigator.

INTRODUCTION
On behalf of San Antonio Water System (SAWS),
SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted cultural resource investigations for Black &
Veatch Corporation (B&V) on the SAWS Regional Carrizo Project (RCP) Buckhorn Supply pipeline in Gonzales County, Texas. The SAWS RCP
Buckhorn Supply Pipeline is a long-term water
supply project that will help provide water from
the Carrizo Aquifer in portions of Gonzales County and eventually into Bexar County. SAWS has
been granted permits from the Gonzales County
Underground Water Conservation District for Carrizo Aquifer wells that would annually produce
11,687 acre-feet of water.
In 2010, SAWS obtained the required permits to
extract and export 11,689 acre-feet per year from
the Carrizo Aquifer in western Gonzales County.
Instead of building a series of pump stations and
pipelines from Gonzales County to the Twin Oaks
WTP in Bexar County, SAWS has created a partnership with Schertz-Seguin Local Government
Corporation (SSLGC) to utilize some of their existing infrastructure to treat and convey SAWS
water. The partnership consists of SAWS pumping
the water from the Buckhorn Well Field through
the Water Supply Pipeline (WSP) to the existing
SSLGC WTP in Gonzales County. SSLGC will
expand their existing plant to accommodate the
treatment of the SAWS water. Once the water has
been treated, SSLGC will pump the SAWS water
through an existing pipeline into western Guadalupe County. SSLGC will then drop off the
SAWS water at SAWS Water Delivery Pump Station (WDPS) and SAWS will pump the water
through the Water Delivery Pipeline (WDP) to an
integration point in northeast San Antonio where it
will enter the SAWS distribution system.

Notably, concurrence for this project was given by
the Texas Historical Commission (THC) on November 5, 2011. Subsequent to this concurrence,
several reroutes were added to the project, which
were investigated and reported upon in the two
addendums to this report. The addendum reports
located in Appendices B and C of this document
received THC concurrence on February 2013 and
August 2012, respectively.

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The roughly 8.1-mile-long RCP Buckhorn Supply
pipeline is located in western Gonzales County
near the intersection of State Highway (SH) 80
and SH 97 (Figure 1). As defined by current construction plans, the proposed project area consists
of a 60–120-foot corridor centered on the approximately 8-mile long RCP pipeline. Thus, the Area
of Potential Effects (APE) is 8.1-miles long, 120feet wide, and nine feet deep for a total area of
117.81 acres.

Due to SAWS’ status as a political subdivision of
the state of Texas, work was done to comply with
the Antiquities Code of Texas. Additionally, investigations were performed to satisfy anticipated
application requirements for a U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE)-Fort Worth District, Section
404 permit in accordance with 33 Code of Federal
Regulation (CFR) Part 325, Appendix C.

Miles
Kilometers

The Rosanky fine sandy loam (1–5 percent slopes)
composes about 24 percent of the APE. This series
consists of very deep, well-drained, moderately
slowly permeable, upland soils that formed in residuum weathered from weakly consolidated sandstone and that are found on convex gently sloping
to moderately sloping ridgetops (NRCS 2011). A
typical pedon for Rosanky series consists of eight
inches of brown fine sandy loam, underlain by
four inches of pale brown fine sandy loam. The
subsoil beneath is 15 inches of red clay, 24 inches
of red clay loam, six inches of red clay loam, and
24 inches of reddish yellow clay loam. The underlying material includes 13 inches of yellow sandy
clay loam and 10 inches of light brownish gray,
weakly cemented sandstone (NRCS 2011).

The eastern terminus of the proposed alignment is
located just east of County Road (CR) 123 near
the headwaters of the Long Hollow drainage.
From this point, the proposed alignment runs
roughly due west to its terminus at the SAWS
Sleepy Meadow Facility, approximately 5.25
miles north of Nixon, Texas. Broadly defined, the
route traverses rural low lying agricultural fields
and the headwaters of several southeast-trending
drainages. These drainages feed into Sandies
Creek and eventually the Guadalupe River, which
is approximately 25 miles southeast of the project
area near Cuero, Texas.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
GEOLOGY

The Luling clay (1–5 percent slopes) composes
roughly 23 percent of the APE. This series consists of well-drained and very slowly permeable
soils that are deep or very deep to weathered shale.
These soils are found on nearly level to moderately sloping erosional uplands (NRCS 2011). A typical pedon for Luling series consists of five inches
of grayish brown clay, underlain by nine inches of
grayish brown clay. The subsoil beneath is six
inches of brown clay, 22 inches of grayish brown
clay, 11 inches of light olive brown clay, and 10
inches of light yellowish brown clay. The underlying material is 17 inches of yellow shale with a
clay texture (NRCS 2011).

Geologically, the proposed alignment is mapped
almost entirely within Eocene-age formations with
recent alluvium indicated only along the margins
of Sandies Creek. From east to west the alignment
crosses the Cook Mountain Formation, Sparta
Sand, Weches Formation, and Queen City sand
(Fisher 1974). These formations are generally
characterized as clay, quartz sand, and sandstone
with marine fossils to depths ranging from 30–250
feet. The recent alluvium along Sandies Creek includes floodplain and low terrace deposits of clay,
silt, sand, gravel, and organic matter that are subject to frequent flooding.

The Silstid loamy fine sand (1–5 percent slopes)
composes about 15 percent of the APE. This series
consists of very deep, well-drained, moderately
permeable soils that formed in residuum weathered from beds of sandy or loamy materials and
interbedded sandstones. These nearly level to sloping soils are found on the uplands (NRCS 2011).
A typical pedon for Silstid series consists of 26
inches of brown loamy fine sand, underlain by
four inches of light yellowish brown loamy fine
sand. The subsoil beneath is 17 inches of brownish
yellow sandy clay loam, seven inches of yellow
sandy clay loam, and 26 inches of mottled yellow,
brownish yellow, and red sandy clay loam (NRCS
2011).

SOILS
A total of 17 different soils are traversed by the
8.1-mile APE, however, five of these comprise 76
percent of the survey area: Rosanky fine sandy
loam, Luling clay, Silstid loamy fine sand, Crockett fine sandy loam, and Chazos loamy fine sand
(Table 1; NRCS 2011). The remaining 24 percent
of the APE is divided among ElmendorfDenhawken complex, Kurten fine sandy loam,
Styx loamy fine sand, Benchley clay loam, Tabor
fine sandy loam, Padina loamy fine sand, Tremona
loamy fine sand, Dimebox clay, frequently flooded
Waelder loam, Wilson clay loam, Normangee
sandy clay loam, and Edge fine sandy loam
(NRCS 2011). The principal soil types are discussed in order of prevalence below.

The Crockett fine sandy loam (1–3 percent slopes)
composes about 8 percent of the APE. This series
consists of moderately well-drained, and very

The archaeological record of the Central Texas
region is known from decades of investigations of
stratified open air sites and rockshelters throughout the Edwards Plateau, its highly dissected eastern and southern margins, and the adjoining margins of physiographic regions to the east and south
(see Collins [2004] for review). Traditionally, the
Central Texas archaeological area has included the
Balcones Canyonlands and Blackland Prairie—
that is, north of San Antonio (e.g., Prewitt 1981;
Suhm 1960). These two areas are on the periphery
of the Central Texas archaeological area, and their
archaeological records and projectile point style
sequences contain elements that suggest influences
from and varying degrees of contact over time
with other areas such as the Lower Pecos and Gulf
Coastal Plain (Collins 2004; Johnson and Goode
1994). For more-complete bibliographies concerning archaeological work done in the region, see
Black (1989), Collins (1995), and Johnson and
Goode (1994).

slowly permeable soils that are deep to weathered
shale. These soils are found on nearly level to
moderately sloping uplands and formed in alkaline
residuum derived from shales and clays (NRCS
2011). A typical pedon for Crockett series consists
of seven inches of brown fine sandy loam, underlain by 14 inches of yellowish red clay, 14 inches
of light yellowish brown clay, 12 inches of light
olive brown clay, and 12 inches of brownish yellow clay loam. The underlying material is 13 inches of pale yellow interbedded shale that has a clay
loam texture and 8 inches of light gray clay
(NRCS 2011).
The Chazos loamy fine sand (1–3 percent slopes)
composes about 6 percent of the APE. This series
consists of very deep, moderately well-drained,
slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy and
clayey sediments. These soils are on nearly level
to moderately sloping Pleistocene stream terraces
(NRCS 2011). A typical pedon for Chazos series
consists of 13 inches of dark brown loamy fine
sand, underlain by six inches of brown loamy fine
sand, 16 inches of grayish brown clay, 9 inches of
light brownish gray clay, six inches of light gray
clay loam, and 30 inches of light gray sandy clay
loam (NRCS 2011).

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD
Surficial and deeply buried sites, rockshelter sites,
and isolated artifacts represent Paleoindian
(11,500–8,800 B.P.) occupations of the Central
Texas region (Collins 2004:116). The period is
often described as having been characterized by
small but highly mobile bands of foragers who
were specialized hunters of Pleistocene
megafauna. But Paleoindians probably used a
much wider array of resources (Meltzer and Bever
1995:59), including small fauna and plant foods.
Faunal remains from Kincaid Rockshelter and the
Wilson-Leonard site (41WM235) support this
view (Bousman 1998; Collins 1998; Collins et al.
1989). Longstanding ideas about Paleoindian
technologies also are being challenged.

PREVIOUS DISTURBANCES
Known disturbances within the project area consist
of agricultural land modification, including grading and clearing, construction and maintenance of
numerous roadways, buried and overhead utilities,
and fence line construction.

CULTURAL SETTING
The proposed project area falls within Central
Texas Archeological Region (Perttula 2004). Although the archaeological regions are not absolute,
they do generally reflect recognized biotic communities and physiographic areas in Texas
(Perttula 2004:6). The Central Texas Region, as its
name implies, is in the center of Texas and covers
the Edwards Plateau and portions of the Blackland
prairie east of the Edwards Plateau. The following
synopses provide basic culture histories of the
Central Texas region.

Collins (2004) divides the Paleoindian period into
early and late subperiods. Two projectile point
styles, Clovis and Folsom, are included in the early subperiod. Clovis chipped stone artifact assemblages, including the diagnostic fluted lanceolate
Clovis point, were produced by bifacial, flake, and
prismatic-blade techniques on high-quality and
oftentimes exotic lithic materials (Collins 1990).
Along with chipped stone artifacts, Clovis assemblages include engraved stones, bone and ivory
points, stone bolas, and ochre (Collins 2004:116;
5

the eastern and southwestern United States and on
the Great Plains, development of horticulturalbased, semisedentary to sedentary societies succeeds the Archaic period. In these areas, the Archaic truly represents a developmental stage of
adaptation as Willey and Phillips (1958) define it.
For Central Texas, this notion of the Archaic is
somewhat problematic. An increasing amount of
evidence suggests that Archaic-like adaptations
were in place before the Archaic (see Collins
2004:118, 1998; Collins et al. 1989) and that these
practices continued into the succeeding Late Prehistoric period (Collins 1995:385; Prewitt
1981:74). In a real sense, the Archaic period of
Central Texas region is not a developmental stage,
but an arbitrary chronological construct and projectile point style sequence. Establishment of this
sequence is based on several decades of archaeological investigations at stratified Archaic sites
along the eastern and southern margins of the Edwards Plateau. Collins (1995, 2004) and Johnson
and Goode (1994) have divided this sequence into
three parts—early, middle, and late—based on
perceived (though not fully agreed upon by all
scholars) technological, environmental, and adaptive changes.

Collins et al. 1992). Clovis points are found evenly
distributed along the eastern edge of the Edwards
Plateau, where the presence of springs and outcrops of chert-bearing limestone are common
(Meltzer and Bever 1995:58). Sites within the area
yielding Clovis points and Clovis-age materials
include Kincaid Rockshelter (Collins et al. 1989),
Pavo Real (Henderson and Goode 1991), and San
Macros Springs (Takac 1991). A probable Clovis
polyhedral blade core and blade fragment was
found at the Greenbelt site in San Antonio (Houk
et al. 1997). Analyses of Clovis artifacts and site
types suggest that Clovis peoples were welladapted, generalized hunter-gatherers with the
technology to hunt larger game but not solely rely
on it.
In contrast, Folsom tool kits—consisting of fluted
Folsom points, thin unfluted (Midland) points,
large thin bifaces, and end scrapers—are more indicative of specialized hunting, particularly of bison (Collins 2004:117). Folsom points have been
recovered from Kincaid Rockshelter (Collins et al.
1989) and Pavo Real (Henderson and Goode
1991).
Postdating Clovis and Folsom points in the archaeological record are a series of dart point styles
(primarily unfluted lanceolate darts) for which the
temporal, technological, or cultural significance is
unclear. Often, the Plainview type name is assigned these dart points, but Collins (2004:117)
has noted that many of these points typed as
Plainview do not resemble Plainview type-site
points in thinness and flaking technology. Nonetheless, it has become clear that the artifact and
feature assemblages of the later Paleoindian
subperiod appear to be Archaic-like in nature and
in many ways may represent a transition between
the early Paleoindian and succeeding Archaic periods (Collins 2004:118).

The use of rock and earth ovens (and the formation of burned rock middens) for processing
and cooking plant foods suggests that this technology was part of a generalized foraging strategy.
The amount of energy involved in collecting
plants, constructing hot rock cooking appliances,
and gathering fuel ranks most plant foods relatively low based on the resulting caloric return (Dering 1999). This suggests that plant foods were part
of a broad-based diet (Kibler and Scott 2000:134)
or part of a generalized foraging strategy, an idea
Prewitt (1981) put forth earlier. At times during
the Late Archaic, this generalized foraging strategy appears to have been marked by shifts to a specialized economy focused on bison hunting
(Kibler and Scott 2000:125–137). Castroville,
Montell, and Marcos dart points are elements of
tool kits often associated with bison hunting (Collins 1968). Archaeological evidence of this association is seen at Bonfire Shelter in Val Verde County (Dibble and Lorrain 1968), Jonas Terrace (Johnson 1995), Oblate Rockshelter (Johnson et al.
1962:116), John Ischy (Sorrow 1969), and Panther
Springs Creek (Black and McGraw 1985).

ARCHAIC PERIOD
The Archaic period for Central Texas dates from
ca. 8,800 to 1,300–1,200 B.P. (Collins 2004:119–
121) and generally is believed to represent a shift
toward hunting and gathering of a wider array of
animal and plant resources and a decrease in group
mobility (Willey and Phillips 1958:107–108). In

6

exploits and suggestions of a kingdom of gold, the
Coronado expedition was formed to search for a
northern Cuzco or Teotihuacan, and by 1540 it
crossed into New Mexico, and into Texas
(Fehrenbach 2005).

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD
Introduction of the bow and arrow and, later, ceramics into Central Texas marked the Late Prehistoric period. Population densities dropped considerably from their Late Archaic peak (Prewitt
1985:217). Subsistence strategies did not differ
greatly from the preceding period, although bison
again became an important economic resource
during the late part of the Late Prehistoric period
(Prewitt 1981:74). Use of rock and earth ovens for
plant food processing and the subsequent development of burned rock middens continued
throughout the Late Prehistoric period (Black et al.
1997; Kleinbach et al. 1995:795). Horticulture
came into play very late in the region but was of
minor importance to overall subsistence strategies
(Collins 2004:122).

The following historic discussion focuses on
Gonzales County and significant events near the
project area during the historic period and the
creation of Texas independence, sovereignty and
statehood.
The project area falls within a large area
established as DeWitt’s Colony in the Mexican
state of Coahuila y Tejas in 1825 (Roell 2011).
Confident that he would receive a land grant from
the Mexican government, Missouri native Green
DeWitt sent James Kerr to survey the colony and
its capital in January 1825 (Baumgartner and
Vollentine 2011). A location was chosen by Kerr
near the confluence of the San Marcos and
Guadalupe rivers and a nearby camp was set up
with cabins while the prospective capital was
surveyed. This location, approximately 16 miles
northeast of the project area, became the westernmost Anglo-American settlement at that time and
remained so through the end of the Texas
Revolution, although it was temporarily
abandoned in 1826 following two attacks by the
Waco and Tonkawa Indians (Baumgartner and
Vollentine 2011; Hardin 2011b). Many retreated
to the mouth of the Lavaca River, and attempted to
establish a permanent settlement, however, this
request was denied by the Mexican government
due to its location within the forbidden ten leagues
of the coastline. DeWitt and 40 settlers returned to
the Gonzales community and by 1831, the
population of the town had grown to 532
(Baumgartner and Vollentine 2011). The number
of residents and their proximity to permanent
Indian villages, prompted the Mexican
government to supply the town with a small
cannon for defense against Indian attacks.

In Central Texas, the Late Prehistoric period generally is associated with the Austin and Toyah
phases (Jelks 1962; Prewitt 1981:82–84). Austin
and Toyah phase horizon markers, ScallornEdwards and Perdiz arrow points, respectively, are
distributed across most of the state. Violence and
conflict often marked introduction of Scallorn and
Edwards arrow points into Central Texas—many
excavated burials contain these point tips in contexts indicating they were the cause of death
(Prewitt 1981:83). Subsistence strategies and technologies (other than arrow points) did not change
much from the preceding Late Archaic period.
Prewitt’s (1981) use of the term “Neoarchaic” recognizes this continuity. In fact, Johnson and
Goode (1994:39–40) and Collins (2004:122) state
that the break between the Austin and Toyah phases could easily and appropriately represent the
break between the Late Archaic and the Late Prehistoric.
HISTORIC PERIOD
The historic period in Texas began in 1528 near
Galveston Island with the encounter between the
Pánfilo de Narváez expedition and a Karankawa
group. After disaster befell the expedition, one of
the members, Cabeza de Vaca, spent six years of
wandering through Texas in the 1530s. Cabeza de
Vaca traversed coastal Texas and parts of the
interior and recounted in great ethnographic detail
the peoples he encountered. Based in part from his

By September 1835, mounting tension between
Antonio López de Santa Anna's Centralist
Mexican government and Texans, prompted the
dispatch of 100 dragoons from San Antonio de
Béxar to retrieve the cannon, which the colonists
refused to surrender (Hardin 2011a). Unable to

against native Indian groups.

ford the Guadalupe River directly across from the
fortified settlement due to high waters and
militiamen, Mexican troops led by Francisco de
Castañeda, set up camp opposite the river from
Gonzales. As many as 150 Texan volunteers
arrived as reinforcement and Castañeda marched
his troops upriver in search of an easier crossing
point. The Texan forces, however, also went on
the move and on October 2, 1935, advanced on
Castañeda’s dragoons on the west side of the river.
As he was outnumbered, ordered not to use force
unless necessary, and admittedly opposed to Santa
Ann’s policies, Castañeda withdrew his troops to
San Antonio de Béxar.

Before and following the American Civil War, the
cattle industry played a large role in Gonzales
County, and in 1866, extensions of the Chisholm
Trail were brought through (Baumgartner and
Vollentine 2011). With an 1870 human population
of around 9,000, there were approximately 75,300
head of cattle, 35,700 hogs, and 27,500 sheep
roaming the county. The importance of the cattle
herds remained through subsequent years, while
hog and sheep numbers steadily declined. The City
of Gonzales was incorporated in 1880, at which
time it “had six churches, daily mail service, four
schools, a courthouse, two banks, an opera house,
library, gas and water works, several lodges,
gristmills, cotton gins, [and] several stores”
(Hardin 2011b). Through the turn of the century,
the population of Gonzales County continued to
rise to approximately 28,882 people, 4,297 of
which were located in the City of Gonzales, and
one-third of which were blacks (Baumgartner and
Vollentine 2011; Hardin 2011b).

Although it was brief, this skirmish between
Texan militiamen and Mexican troops marked the
first armed conflict of the Texas Revolution,
thereafter known as the Battle of Gonzales
(Baumgartner and Vollentine 2011; Hardin
2011a). Emergent Texan troops marched on San
Antonio de Béxar from Gonzales in what became
the first major campaign of the revolution against
Santa Anna’s forces. Ultimately, Mexican forces
in San Antonio were overcome, and by early
December, all troops had surrendered their
equipment and weapons and retreated (Barr 2011).
Due to its location as the westernmost AngoAmerican settlement and the nearest town to San
Antonio, Gonzales served as the center of much of
Texas revolutionary activity (Hardin 2011b).

Though city populations waxed and waned
through the late nineteenth through early twentieth
centuries, the overall Gonzales County population
continued to grow, assisted by the passing
railroads and subsequent farm-to-market road
construction. On the heels of an already increasing
importance of poultry farming in the area, the
establishment of the Texas A&M Poultry
Experiment Station in Gonzalez solidified it an
economic mainstay in Gonzales County. As
recently as 1982, as much as 96 percent of the
county’s income was attributed to agriculture,
largely poultry and beef sales, with only 12
percent of county lands under cultivation
(Baumgartner and Vollentine 2011).

Gonzales County was established in 1836 and
organized the following year in the new Republic
of Texas (Hardin 2011b). Following the 1845
annexation of Texas to the United States, Gonzales
Caldwell, Comal, DeWitt, Fayette, Guadalupe,
Jackson, Lavaca, and Victoria were also
established from the lands originally defined as
DeWitt’s colony. A county court was also
established in 1837 and beginning in the 1940s,
reconstruction efforts concentrated on the original
settlement of Gonzales. The early Gonzales
County economy was based on the production of
cotton, corn, potato, sugarcane, rye, oat, and
barley crops along with significant numbers of hog
and sheep (Baumgartner and Vollentine 2011). As
the population steadily returned and grew,
infrastructure was expanded to include a church,
schoolhouse, and a county newspaper. As was

ords search of the proposed RCP Buckhorn Supply
pipeline alignment. For this research, an SWCA
archaeologist searched the Nixon and Smiley,
Texas USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle
maps and site files, records, and maps files housed
at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) and the Texas Historical Commission
(THC) Library. Additionally, an SWCA archaeologist searched the THC’s Texas Archeological
Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database for any previously recorded surveys and historic or prehistoric
archaeological sites located in or near the project
area. In addition to identifying previously recorded
archaeological sites, the Atlas review included the
following types of information: National Register
of Historic Places properties, State Archeological
Landmarks (SAL), Official Texas Historical
Markers, Registered Texas Historic Landmarks
(RTHL), cemeteries, and local neighborhood surveys. Finally, SWCA utilized historic maps in the
Texas Department of Transportation’s (TxDOT)
Historic Overlay program and other resources to
assess the presence of potentially historic resources in or near each alignment.

From late 1994 to early 1995, a linear archaeological survey was conducted by SWCA on behalf of
the MIDTEXAS Pipeline Company for a 130-mile
long natural gas pipeline (Miller 1996). The
MIDTEXAS pipeline route trends from the southeast to the northwest and intersects and partially
parallels the proposed RCP Buckhorn Supply
pipeline beginning at SH 80. The 1994–1995 investigations by SWCA focused on waterways
along the MIDTEXAS route, three of which (i.e.,
Crossings 27–29) are within a mile of the currently
proposed alignment (Miller 1996:71–77).
The Crossing 27 study area focused on a tributary
of the Salt Branch drainage and is located about
0.8 miles northwest of the western terminus of the
currently proposed alignment. The Crossing 28
study area focused on an ephemeral tributary of
the Red Branch drainage that is about 0.2 miles
east of SH 80 and roughly 0.18 miles south of the
currently proposed alignment. The Crossing 29
study area focused on an ephemeral tributary of
Sandies Creek and is located just west of Farm-toMarket (FM) 2922 and about 0.85 miles south of
the currently proposed alignment. No archaeological sites or cultural materials were encountered at
these three study areas (Miller 1996:71–77).

FIELD METHODS
SWCA conducted an intensive cultural resources
survey of 100 percent of the SAWS RCP Buckhorn Supply pipeline alignment. These investigations consisted of an intensive pedestrian survey
with subsurface investigations including shovel
testing. Archaeologists performed pedestrian survey examining the ground surface and erosional
profiles for cultural resources. Shovel testing was
employed in undisturbed areas with a potential for
shallowly (less than 1 meter) buried sites. Where
performed, shovel tests were systematically excavated in 20-cm arbitrary levels to culturally sterile
deposits. The matrix was screened through ¼-inch
mesh and each test was recorded on appropriate
project field forms. The location of each shovel
test was plotted using a GPS receiver.

In 2000, a linear cultural resource survey was conducted by TAS, Inc. and sponsored by Shiner,
Moseley, and Associates, Inc. on behalf of the
Schertz-Seguin Local Government Corporation
(SSLGC) for a planned water supply system (Turpin 2000). These investigations were conducted at
the western end of the proposed RCP Buckhorn
Supply pipeline project area, which overlaps the
existing Sleepy Meadow facility and intersects the
proposed project alignment in three locations east
of SH 80 (Atlas). These investigations did not en-

counter any archaeological sites within a mile of
the proposed project area.
A series of linear archaeological surveys were
conducted on behalf of B&V and SAWS for the
Gonzales County Carrizo Aquifer (GCCA) project
in 2005 by SWCA (Lawrence et al. n.d.). These
investigations were conducted at the eastern end of
the proposed project area. The investigations examined sections situated north, east, and south of
the proposed RCP Buckhorn Supply pipeline APE,
but not intersecting the proposed project alignment.

FIELD SURVEY
SWCA conducted intensive survey investigations
for the approximately 8.1-mile SAWS RCP Buckhorn Supply pipeline on July 19–22, 2011. Based
on a review of the soils, geology, and aerial photographs, recorded archaeological sites, and the
results of previously conducted surveys in the area, SWCA determined that the entire project area
had a moderate to high potential of containing cultural resources. In general, the route traverses low
lying agricultural fields and the headwaters of several southeast-trending drainages, which feed into
Sandies Creek and eventually the Guadalupe River
(Figures 2 and 3).

Site 41GZ222 was discovered during the GCCA
project and is situated approximately 0.43 miles
(700 m) north of the proposed project alignment
near the confluence of O’Neil and Sandies Creeks.
The site was recorded as a prehistoric lithic scatter, possibly utilized as a small campsite, containing a sparse quantity of diffusely scattered chert
debitage, fire-cracked rock fragments, and an Ensor projectile point. Due to disturbances and
sparseness of the assemblage, site 41GZ222 was
not recommended for further investigation or
avoidance (Lawrence et al. n.d.:6-11–6-14). The
site is not considered significant or eligible for
NRHP nomination or for SAL designation (Lawrence et al. n.d.:6-11–6-14).

A total of 126 shovel tests were excavated between 10–105 cm below surface (cmbs), averaging
46.5 cmbs (Figures 4a–4c and Appendix A). Most
shovel tests encountered sand or sandy loam over
sandy clay or clay. Some encountered shallow clay
and most terminated at basal clay, while the remainder terminated at depth, compact soil, bedrock, or disturbance. One historic livestock watering station was identified and recorded as archaeological site 41GZ235 during the survey, while isolated brick fragments and well features were noted
in three other locales.

Also discovered during the 2005 GCCA SWCA
surveys is the second previously recorded archaeological site within a mile of the proposed project
area. Site 41GZ219 is situated approximately 264
feet due east, of the eastern terminus of the proposed project alignment. The site consists of an
early twentieth century historic farmhouse including various features, such as a small residence
structure and a cistern with a date of 1925. The
historic site was interpreted to be a tenant farmstead occupied circa 1925. Due to the condition
and ubiquity of this resource, site 41GZ219 was
not recommended for further investigation or
avoidance. The site does not warrant inclusion to
the NRHP or designation as an SAL (Lawrence et
al. n.d.:6-1–6-7).

The survey area traverses 16 tracts, of which 14
were available for survey. Right of entry (ROE)
was not granted for Parcel 1 at the eastern terminus of the project belonging to Larue Manford
Cook and Parcel 6, near SH 97 and belonging to
Phyllis A. Stone. Both of these parcels contain
very short segments (less than 300 feet combined)
of the ROW, and based on the results of investigations on adjacent properties, no further work is
recommended for either Parcel 1 or Parcel 6.
From east to west, the survey encountered varying
soils across the APE, including moderate-toshallow clays, deep sands, rocky clays, and shallow soils with basal clay just below the surface.
The finger of a sand sheet appears to occupy the

In addition to the previously recorded archaeological sites, the Union Hill cemetery (cemetery number GZ-CO24) is located approximately 0.82 miles

intersection with CR 123. The site is an historic
agricultural complex consisting of 1940–1950s-era
water wells and windmill foundations, a cistern,
livestock pen, and fences (Figure 9). The landscape is level to gently sloping, with a mesquite
forest and small open grassy areas. The fence line
and the CR 133 ROW form the southern site
boundary and are immediately south of wooden
livestock pens or corrals, wooden fencing, and a
metal cattle chute. These features along with a water tank and a scatter of surficial artifacts comprise
the site assemblage (Figure 10). Two shovel tests
(GS42 and JB26) were excavated at site 41GZ235,
which encountered a strong brown (7.5YR5/6)
clay loam overlying a shallow basal clay at less
than 20 cmbs. Both of these shovel tests were
negative for cultural materials.

central part of the proposed route where deep
sands were consistently encountered along with
dunes and pimple mounds. Extensive dumping of
modern construction material and household garbage along the edges of two-track roads is evident
within the proposed ROW in the western end of
the project area (Figure 5). More modern and historic-age trash was encountered on Tract 10 near
the APE’s intersection with SH 97, including a
1947–1950-era Jeep and numerous vehicle tires
and household appliances (Figure 6). Neither of
these trash dumps was considered a significant
cultural resource and no further archaeological
work is recommended.
Similar to the variation in the soils across the APE,
vegetation varied from mature mesquite forest in
the east to cleared and leveled agricultural fields in
the west. There were two distinct areas of mesquite forest that seemed relatively undisturbed,
including approximately 1.3 miles of the eastern
end of the APE that also exhibited extensive feral
hog activity. A transmission line intersects the
APE near its eastern terminus (Figure 7). The other area of mesquite forest is between SH 80 and
CR 113, where the tree canopy is mostly undisturbed, but contains large cleared area where the
soil has been churned, either from vegetation removal or by feral hogs.

Also present at 41GZ235 are multiple, relatively
small, brick foundations or footings that may be
associated with windmills or water tanks. A concrete cistern and water well are at the northwest
side of the site; the well collar has “1947” engraved twice on top (Figure 11). The remnants of
steel footings, presumably for a windmill, are cut
close to the ground around this well (Figure 12). A
second possible windmill, made of wood over a
second well along the east side of the site, is indicated by three inward slanting cut wood posts
amongst the brick scatter and brick foundations.

Isolated cultural material was encountered in three
locales across the APE, including a brick fragment
near shovel test (ST) JB28, another brick fragment
between STs GS40 and GS41, and an abandoned
well in association with a defunct cattle feeder
near ST GS18 (Figure 8). No subsurface cultural
material was encountered at any of these locales
and no features or other cultural material was noted on the surface surrounding these isolated artifacts and features. Therefore, archaeological sites
were not recorded at these locations. None was
considered a significant cultural resource and no
further archaeological work is recommended for
these isolated cultural materials.

Site 41GZ235 exhibits no evidence of residential
buildings or household debris. Artifacts observed
include two soda bottles, a “Sun Crest” soda bottle
with a 1951 Duraglass imprint on the base, and a
fragment of a Coca Cola bottle base, with no legible markings. All scattered bricks appear machinemade, with SECO brand being the most common,
along with Corsicana brand and one unlabeled
brick. The site measures 90 m north-south by 40 m
east-west and appears to have been cleared of vegetation in the past and bulldozed in the 1947-well
area. Additionally, severe erosion and feral hog
activity have rendered the site about 75 percent
intact.

SITE 41GZ235

SWCA recommends that site 41GZ235 is not eligible for NRHP listing based on the ubiquitous
nature of this type of ranching site during the
twentieth century and in this south-central region

Site 41GZ235 is a mid-twentieth century ranching
and watering facility for livestock north of the CR

The one archaeological site identified during the
cultural resource survey 41GZ235 is an historic
agricultural complex containing evidence of 1940–
1950s-era activities. Specifically, the site contains
several features including water wells and windmill foundations along with scattered debris,
which are associated with mid-twentieth century
ranching. SWCA evaluated site 41GZ235 according to the criteria in 36 CFR 60.4, specifically,
Criterion D. SWCA recommends that site
41GZ235 is not eligible for listing on the NRHP or
for designation as an SAL. Consequently, SWCA
recommends no further work at 41GZ235. No artifacts were collected during this survey; therefore,
none was curated.

of Texas. Likewise, site 41GZ235 is not recommended eligible for designation as an SAL, according to 13 TAC 26.12, and SWCA recommends no further work at this location.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of B&V, SWCA conducted an intensive
cultural resources survey of the 8.1-mile SAWS
RCP Buckhorn Supply pipeline in Gonzales County, Texas. The work was conducted as part of
SAWS’s compliance with NHPA and the Texas
Antiquities Code. Notably, concurrence for this
project was given by the THC on November 5,
2011. Subsequent to this concurrence, several reroutes were added to the project, which were investigated and reported upon in the two addendums to this report. The addendum reports located
in Appendices B and C of this document received
THC concurrence on March and August 2012,
respectively.

THC/Council of Texas Archaeologists’ survey
standards for projects of this size requires 154
shovel tests. The current survey did not meet this
requirement. However, due to the extensive prior
disturbance encountered throughout the APE severely limited the amount of undisturbed areas that
warranted shovel test excavation.

These investigations included a background literature and records review as well as an intensive
pedestrian survey with subsurface investigations.
The background literature review determined that a
previously conducted linear survey intersects the
proposed RCP Buckhorn Supply pipeline in three
locations east of SH 80, but no previously recorded archaeological sites are within the proposed
APE. Additionally, two archaeological surveys
and two archaeological sites (41GZ219 and
41GZ222) are within a mile radius of the proposed
project.

In accordance with 33 CFR 800.4, SWCA has
made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify
archaeological historic properties within the survey area portion of the APE. As no properties
were identified that may meet the criteria for listing in the NRHP according to 36 CFR 60.4 or for
designation as an SAL, according to 13 TAC
26.12, SWCA recommends no further archaeological work within the proposed APE.

The field survey included 126 shovel tests placed
in areas that had the highest potential for containing buried cultural materials with good integrity.
Investigations determined that much of the APE
contains extensive prior disturbances, which include grading and clearing associated with agricultural land modification, constructing and maintaining numerous roadways, installing buried and
overhead utilities, and constructing fences. No
cultural material was encountered in any subsurface investigation and, besides those artifacts associated with site 41GZ235 or isolated brick fragments, none were observed on the surface of the
APE.

INTRODUCTION

FIELD SURVEY

On behalf of Black and Veatch Corporation
(B&V) and the San Antonio Water System
(SAWS), SWCA conducted an intensive archaeological survey of 8.1 km of alignment
adjustments on the RCP Buckhorn Supply
Pipeline (Figure 1). The proposed collection
lines have a permanent easement of 60 feet,
with proposed impacts to a depth of eight feet
(10 feet at drainage crossings). Access roads
are to be constructed of crushed limestone that
is 15 feet wide at the base and 12 feet wide at
the top surface. The entire width of the easement may be disrupted during construction,
therefore the survey corridor for current collection line reroutes and access roads was 100
feet. The currently proposed reroutes are associated with the SAWS Buckhorn Supply Pipeline Project (under Antiquities permit #5984)
and, as such, the survey methods and results
of a background review of this area are discussed in the final report for this project,
which is the primary report at the front of this
document. This addendum report in Appendix
B solely regards the results of investigations
of several pipeline route adjustments and access roads. Notably, the results and recommendations of this addendum report received
THC concurrence on February 19, 2013.

In early February 2012, three SWCA archaeologists conducted an intensive pedestrian
survey along four proposed reroutes of the
SAWS Buckhorn Supply Pipeline (Figure 2).
Two of these areas are alignment adjustments
to gathering pipelines (A and B) and two are
associated access roads (C and D). These areas are located within five miles southwest of
the small town of Bebe, Texas and on the
southeast side of Highway 97. Overall, SWCA
archaeologists investigated 8.1 km of reroutes,
excavated 35 shovel tests, and documented
one new historic site (41GZ238).
The general project area consists of open grazing pasture with surface disturbance as a result
of vegetation clearing. The topography is gently undulating and varies little within the project routes (Figures 3, 4, and 5). Vegetation
consisting of oak and mesquite trees was present primarily near drainage crossings, with
grass and clover covering most of the open
pastures. Drainages crossed along the four
proposed routes include Sugar Creek, one unnamed Sugar Creek tributary, and two headwater drainages of Buckhorn Creek. At the
proposed pipeline crossing, the Sugar Creek
channel is approximately 150 cm deep and 3–
5 m wide. Shovel tests on either side of Sugar
Creek terminated at ancient clay subsoil at
depths of 30–70 cmbs. This drainage was the
most significant of the four and none displayed the potential for deep alluvial sediment
(Table 1). Shovel tests were excavated
throughout each route, with increased frequency on either side of drainage crossings.

RESULTS
BACKGROUND REVIEW
Between 2005 and 2011, SWCA conducted
survey level investigations on behalf of the
SAWS RCP Buckhorn Supply Pipeline. Two
sites, 41GZ219 and 41GZ235, were documented near the project area as a result of this
project. Located 800 m and 650 m south and
west the current project area, respectively,
both are historic sites that will not be affected
by the proposed adjustments (Stotts et al.
2013).

Access Road C was recently bladed at the
time of survey and a construction crew was in
the process of covering the surface with truckloads of imported gravel (Figure 6). Shovel
tests were placed within the 100-foot proposed
corridor, directly adjacent to the bladed roadway. Although relatively intact along the mar-

three shovel tests excavated on the site were
negative for cultural material (Table 1).

Access road D is a gravel road from start to
finish that will not likely require any additional improvement prior to SAWS’ utilization
(Figure 7). For this reason, the roadway was
visually inspected, with minimal emphasis on
subsurface investigations. Site 41GZ238,
however, was documented along this access
road. This site is a historic homestead and agricultural complex dating to the 1920s, which
will be discussed in detail below.

The house has a square plan with a front gabled roof (Figure 9). The roof is clad in metal
and has exposed rafter tails. The foundation is
pier and beam, created with local cedar posts.
No skirting is present. The wooden frame is
clad in board and batten siding. Two singledoor entries are found on the south-southeast
elevation or front façade of the house. The
building is a two-by-two bay with an almost
full-width porch on the front of the building.
A smaller, half-width porch is located along
the back of the building. Both porches have
dropped metal shed roofs with cedar post supports. All windows are vinyl and have been
replaced. Due to the exposed rafter tails and
form, coupled with the roughness of the board
and batten siding, the house has a rustic bungalow appearance and it appears to function as
a hunting cabin. It is currently in fair to poor
condition.

The THC/CTA survey standards require a
minimum of 81 shovel tests within a project of
this size. In this case, the survey standards
were not met due to previous disturbance including roadway improvements and vegetation clearing within a large portion of the project area. Soils within the shovel tests were
found to consist of silty loam to clay loam underlain by dense yellowish to reddish clays at
an average depth of 40 cm below the surface
(cmbs). All shovel tests were negative for cultural material.
SITE 41GZ238
Site 41GZ238 is an historic-age house and agricultural complex that likely dates to the
1920s or 1930s. Straddling the proposed access road (Area D), the structures and surface
scatter cover a total area of approximately 550
feet northwest to southeast by 300 feet northeast to southwest (Figure 8). Artifacts observed across the site include whiteware, blue
glass, clear glass (window and bottle), metal
drums, a ceramic toilet, bricks, PVC pipes,
glass jars, car parts, rubber hose, barbed wire,
cast iron fragments, air duct tubes, as well as
1995 and 1996 wall calendars hanging inside
the house. Furniture inside the house consisted
of two beds, a stove, refrigerator, chairs, and a
free-standing wood/coal burning heater installed to vent through the brick chimney. All

A barn is located approximately 200 feet
northwest of the house. The layout consists of
a central alley under a front gable roof,
flanked by two shed portions (Figure 10). The
roof cladding is of metal. The barn framing is
of rough cedar logs and all wall cladding is
board and batten. The barn is currently is
poor condition and is partially collapsed.
The larger agricultural landscape is dotted
with concrete water tanks, both historic-age
and contemporary, along with an historic-age
windmill and a metal clad, shed-roofed pump
house. These features are primarily located to
the southeast and across the access road from
the house and barn.
While the house and larger agricultural complex are historic, and appear to retain integrity
of location, setting, design, and association,
the house and larger property are not associated with any persons or events of significance,

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of B&V and SAWS, SWCA conducted an intensive cultural resources survey
of 8.1 km of reroutes and access roads in support of the SAWS RCP Buckhorn Supply
Pipeline Project. Cultural resource investigations were conducted to satisfy the requirements of the Antiquities Code of Texas (Permit No. 5984). These investigations included
a background review and an intensive pedestrian survey with subsurface investigations.
The currently proposed reroutes are associated
with the SAWS Buckhorn Supply Pipeline
Project, which is the primary report at the
front of this document. This addendum report
in Appendix B solely regards the results of
investigations of several pipeline route adjustments and access roads. Notably, the results and recommendations of this addendum
report received THC concurrence on February
19, 2013.

low, silt loam to clayey soil. The nature of the
disturbances along both access roads (C and
D) has greatly reduced the potential for encountering any intact, significant cultural resources. The THC/CTA survey standards for
this project necessitated the excavation of 81
shovel tests along the 8.1 km of alignment reroutes. SWCA excavated a total of 35 shovel
tests, due to the high level of disturbance encountered. No artifacts were recovered from
any of the 35 shovel tests.
One new site, 41GZ238 was documented
along access road D. It consists of an earlytwentieth century house, barn, and associated
agricultural structures. Due to various factors
including the prevalence of this site type, site
41GZ238 is not considered eligible for inclusion on the NRHP. Based on the result of the
current survey effort, no significant archaeological or historic resources will be affected
by construction activities and SWCA recommends no further archaeological investigations
within the SAWS RCP Buckhorn Supply
Pipeline project area.

The background review determined that the
project area had not been previously surveyed
for cultural resources and no previously recorded archaeological sites located within or
immediately adjacent to the project area. Two
historic-age sites were documented by SWCA
within a mile of the project area (41GZ219
and 41GZ235), neither of which will be effected by the proposed construction project.
Overall, the project area traverses gently undulating uplands with fairly minor stream
crossings and no evidence of deep alluvial
sediment. Much of the project area is disturbed by road preparation and/or vegetation
clearing and undisturbed areas display shal-

INTRODUCTION
On behalf of Black and Veatch Corporation
(B&V) and the San Antonio Water System
(SAWS), SWCA conducted an intensive archaeological survey of one alignment adjustment on the RCP Buckhorn Supply Pipeline
(Figure 1). The RCP Buckhorn Supply Pipeline is a roughly 8.1-mile-long pipeline located in western Gonzales County near the intersection of State Highway (SH) 80 and SH 97.

RESULTS
BACKGROUND REVIEW
Between 2005 and 2011, SWCA conducted
survey level investigations on behalf of the
SAWS RCP Buckhorn Supply Pipeline. One
archaeological site (41GZ222) is documented
near the currently proposed reroute. Site
41GZ222 is a prehistoric campsite consisting
of a sparse lithic scatter on the terrace of
O'Neil Creek. However, 41GZ222 is located
1.67 miles northeast of the current project area
and will not be affected by the proposed route
adjustment (Stotts et al. 2013).

This addendum details the findings of the additional archaeological survey of the proposed
reroute. Located northwest and southeast of
the intersection of SH 97 and Farm-to-Market
(FM) 2922, the reroute extends a total of 0.88
mile. The proposed collection line will have a
permanent easement of 60 feet, with proposed
impacts to a depth of 8 feet (10 feet at drainage waterway crossings). The entire width of
the easement may be disrupted during construction; therefore the survey corridor for the
current collection line reroute was 100 feet.
The current reroute totals 10.66 acres.

FIELD SURVEY
In late June 2012, two SWCA archaeologists
conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of
the 0.88-mile reroute. The reroute is located
six miles northeast of the town of Nixon, Texas and on the northwest and southeast sides of
SH 97. Overall, SWCA archaeologists investigated a 0.88-mile-long stretch, excavated 12
shovel tests, and recorded no new sites.

SWCA’s cultural resource investigations were
designed to identify, inventory, and evaluate
cultural resources in the Project’s Area of
Potential Effects (APE) to comply with the
Antiquities Code of Texas and the National
Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and its
implementing regulations (36 Code of Federal
Regulations [CFR] Part 800). The currently
proposed reroute is associated with the SAWS
Buckhorn Supply Pipeline Project (under
Antiquities permit #5984) and, as such, the
survey methods and results of a background
review of this area are discussed in the final
report for this project, which is the primary
report at the front of this document. This
addendum report in Appendix C solely
regards the results of investigations of one
pipeline route adjustment. Notably, the results
and recommendations of this addendum report

The current project area extends northwest
and southeast of the intersection of SH 97 and
FM 2922. The general project area northwest
of the intersection consists of open grazing
pasture with surface disturbance as a result of
heavy vegetation clearing (Figures 2 and 3).
No shovel tests were excavated at the far west
terminus of the reroute due to these disturbances (Figure 4). Past this point, the topography is gently undulating and varies little within this portion of the route. Vegetation consisting of oak and mesquite trees is present only
along fence lines, with low grasses covering
most of the open pastures. No drainages (i.e.,
waterways) are present within this segment of

the reroute, and shovel tests were placed opportunistically atop low rises.
Seven shovel tests were excavated northwest
of the intersection, revealing moderately deep
sandy loam atop pre-Holocene clay subsoil at
depths of 20–100 cmbs (Table 1). Shovel tests
were negative for cultural resources. Two
modern residences were noted near the intersection of SH 97 and FM 2922, but both remain well outside the current project area.

The currently proposed reroute is associated
with the SAWS Buckhorn Supply Pipeline
Project, which is the primary report at the
front of this document. This addendum report
in Appendix C solely regards the results of
investigations of one pipeline route adjustment. Notably, the results and recommendations of this addendum report received THC
concurrence on August 31, 2012.

The portion of the reroute located southeast of
the intersection of SH 97 and FM 2922 parallels an existing fence line through moderate to
dense vegetation and terminates at a large,
open pasture (Figure 3). Topography is similar
to the northwest portion with gently undulating low rises. Vegetation consisting of various
hardwoods, high shrubs, and vines becomes
dense in low-lying areas but thins near the
eastern terminus of the reroute. No drainages
(i.e., waterways) were encountered, and shovel tests within this portion of the reroute were
also placed atop minor rises. Five shovel tests
were excavated and encountered the same
sandy loam atop pre-Holocene clay subsoil at
depths of 40–100 cmbs (Figure 4; Table 1).
No cultural materials were recovered from any
of the five shovel tests.

The background review determined that the
project area had not been previously surveyed
for cultural resources and no previously recorded archaeological sites are located within
or adjacent to the reroute area.
Overall, the project area traverses gently undulating uplands with no stream crossings.
The westernmost portion project area has been
disturbed by vegetation clearing and undisturbed areas display moderately deep sandy
loams atop basal clay. The THC/CTA survey
standards for this project necessitated the excavation of 14 shovel tests along the 0.88mile-long reroute. SWCA excavated a total of
12 shovel tests, due to the disturbance encountered. Soils within the shovel tests were found
to consist of fine sandy loam underlain by
dense, pre-Holocene reddish clays at an average depth of 60 cm below the surface (cmbs).
No artifacts were recovered from any of the
12 shovel tests.

The THC and Council of Texas Archeologists
(CTA) survey standards require a minimum of
14 shovel tests within a project of this size.
The survey standards were not met due to disturbance including vegetation clearing at the
westernmost portion of the project area.

Based on the result of the current survey effort, no significant archaeological or historic
resources will be affected by construction activities and SWCA recommends no further
archaeological investigations within the
SAWS RCP Buckhorn Supply Pipeline project
area.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of B&V and SAWS, SWCA conducted an intensive cultural resources survey
of a 0.88-mile-long reroute in support of the
SAWS RCP Buckhorn Supply Pipeline Project. Cultural resource investigations were
conducted to satisfy the requirements of the
