A Preliminary Report on Archeological Resources
in Southern Culberson County in the Vicinity of
Van Horn, Texas
John A. Hedrick
ABSTRACT
This paper reports results of an ongoing survey of sites in six study areas
in southern Culberson County, Texas. The region appears to have been occupied from the Paleo-Indian period through Late Prehistoric times.
INTRODUCTION

The locus of this study of archeological resources in the region around Van
Horn, in southern Culberson County, Texas is a 3,500-km2 area comprising six
study areas. The study focuses on (1) surveying and recording sites and (2)
cataloging private projectile point collections, particularly those with known
proveniences. In conjunction with documenting the collection of Harold O.
(Hock) Haynes, both Haynes and the late R. K. Wylie greatly furthered the
survey by securing access to private property and assisting in recording the
sites--described in this report from which the projectile points were collected.
THE AREA

The 3,500-km2 region (Figure 1) encompasses Salt Flat, Michigan Flat,
Lobo Valley, and adjacent mountain ranges of southern Culberson County,
southeastern Hudspeth County and western Jeff Davis County. The area is part
of a broad corridor of classic basin and range topography that extends from the
Guadalupe Mountains and Salt Basin in the north to the Davis Mountains in the
south. It is bordered on the west by the Sierra Diablo, Baylor, Beach, Carrizo,
and Van Horn mountains, and on the east by the southern Delaware, Apache,
and northern Davis mountains. The Wylie and Chispa mountains divide the
southern basin into the Lobo Valley and Michigan Flat. Elevations range
between 1,110 meters (3,700 feet) at Salt Flat and more than 1,800 meters
(6,000 feet) in the Sierra Diablo and Davis Mountains.
The topography is typical of the Trans-Pecos region, varying from rugged
mountains with deep canyons, flat-topped mesas, alluvial fans, slopes, and
terraces to volcanic cones and lava flows. In the survey area are alluvial valleys,
large dune fields, flatlands, and alkaline flats.
Water resources include large draws that carry runoff from the mountains
into the basin and eventually into Salt Flat to the north. There are also many
arroyos, springs, seeps, and tinajas (bedrock pools) in the hills and mountains,
and playas in the flatlands.

The basin and mountains contain enormous quantities of lithic resources. In
addition to very fine grades of chert, these resources include limestone, sandstone, schist, shale, rhyolite, felsite, conglomerate (puddingstone), basalt, vesicular basalt, quartz, quartzite, talc, soapstone, agate, jasper, chalcedony, petrified wood, and small obsidian nodules.
To the north are the salt deposits of the Salt Basin and Salt Flat (Henry and
Price 1986; Price et al. 1986).
The basin is part of the north-central Chihuahuan Desert and has the flora
and fauna usually associated with the district. Annual average precipitation is
239 mm, about half of which falls as thunderstorms during July, August, and
September (Foster and Kelley 1987:1).
Archeological reports on the region are few; the first is by Joe Ben Wheat in
Lehmer’s (1960:122) A Review of Trans-Pecos Texas Archeology. Other investigations have been reported by Hedrick (1968, 1975, 1986), and additional
work in the region has been in conjunction with construction of a floodwater
diversion channel between Three-Mile and Sulphur draws (Skinner and Bousman
1973, Banks 1975, Gerald 1978, Cliff and Fifield 1980, Foster and Kelley 1987).
The peripheral areas of the study region, particularly those in the Guadalupe
Mountains and Guadalupe Mountains National Park, have been studied more
thoroughly (Clark 1974, Katz and Katz 1974, Phelps 1974, Katz, P. 1978,
Boisvert 1980, Katz and Lukowski 1981, Katz, S. 1983).
THE SURVEY
The focus of the survey is toward establishing an overview of the kinds of
sites that can be expected in the region. It is hoped that this phase will be
followed by intensive, controlled follow-up surveys of selected areas and recording of all sites.
Site data have been recorded on specifically designed survey forms, with
close attention to key informational categories such as site and feature description, cultural material density and description, land forms, soil types, vegetation,
and water resources. Sites were plotted on U. S. Geological Survey 15-minute
quadrangles. Surface collections were selective, with emphasis on lithic and
diagnostic samples. Most, but not all, sites were photographed. Trinomial site
numbers have been assigned by the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory.
No subsurface testing or excavation has been undertaken.
For the purposes of this survey, four ecological zones have been defined:
1. Flatlands and dune areas, with amaranth, beargrass, creosote, dock,
flowers, grasses, mesquite, mormon tea, sage, salt bush, snakeweed, and yucca.
2. Hills and slopes, with agave, cholla, ocotillo, prickly pear, sotol, and
Yucca baccata.
3. Canyons and watercourses, with allthorn, catclaw, desert willow, and
sumac.
4. Mountains, with buckeye, juniper, and scrub oak.

The six study areas in the region are:
Study Area 1---The Plateau complex (Figure 3).
Study Area 2---Central and southern Wild Horse Draw (Figure 4).
Study Area 3 ,,ran Horn Mountains Area 1 (Figure 4).
Study Area 4--Van Horn Mountains Area 2 (Figure 4).
Study Area 5---Carrizo Mountains Area 1 (Figure 5).
Study Area 6---Carrizo Mountains Area 2 (Figure 5).
SURVEY RESULTS

The Sites
One hundred twenty-seven sites are reported here (Table 1). Sixteen had
been reported previously (Hedrick 1975), and three already had been assigned
site numbers by the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. A tabulation of
data for all sites is presented in the Appendix.
Base Camps
Base camps are the second largest category of sites. They are extensive
areas of cultural debris and associated features that may include multiple,
separate, or overlapping rock hearths, burned rock scatters, fire-blackened sand,
lithic work areas, and, occasionally, ring middens. Moderately dense to very
dense cultural debris at these sites consists of chipped stone debitage, chipped
stone tools, and ground stone tools. Artifact assemblages include, in addition to
very few ceramics, projectile points, scrapers, choppers, knives, bifaces, retouched and utilized flakes, cores, manos, and metates in all stages of manufacture and use. Base camps appear to be multiuse sites that may have been either
seasonally or continuously occupied, and seem to be associated with hunting,
food processing, and tool manufacture.
Twenty-three base camps were recorded in the survey area. All but two are
in the Plateau Complex Study Area (Table 1), but their absence cannot be
assumed in other areas. The average area of the sites is 18,930 m2; all are near
water resources (Table 2).
Campsites
The largest category of sites recorded is campsites. Campsites are similar to
base camps but they are smaller and have a lower density of cultural debris.
Features may include multiple--sometimes overlapping--hearths, scattered
burned rock, and areas of fire-blackened sand areas. Cultural material is scattered throughout the site in light-to-moderate density but may be concentrated
around hearths. Artifact assemblages are similar to those at base camps and
include, in addition to ceramics, projectile points, scrapers, choppers, knives,
bifaces, retouched and utilized flakes, cores, manos, and metates in all stages of
manufacture and use. Campsites appear to be hunting, food processing, and tool
manufacture sites.

the white chert quarries (41CU349, CU372, and CU379) have been reported by
Hedrick (1975:58-60; 1986:17).
The Purple-Tan Chert quarry (41CU449) covers about 390,000 mz on the
ridge and slopes of a range of Cretaceous limestone hills in the eastern part of
the Plateau Complex. The chert, exposed in nodules, is extremely dense, and
has a fine, glossy texture. It produces an excellent concoidal fracture andthin,
translucent flakes. Predominant colors are grayish orange (10YR7/4), very pale
orange (10YR8/2), grayish red-purple (5RP4/2). pale red (5R6/2) and pinkish
gray (5YR8/1) (Rock Color Chart Committee 1984). The entire area of the
quarry is densely covered with evidence of removal from matrix, testing, and
trimming of the chert.
Three white chert quarries (41CU349, CU372, and CU379) are on ridges
and slopes of three separate cretaceous limestone hills in the Plateau Complex
Study Area. The sites range in size between 4,800 and 70,000 mz. Colors range
between white (N9) and medium light gray (N6)--some have fossil inclusions-and pinkish gray (5YR8/1) (Rock Color Chart Committee 1984). The
chert is coarse to fine grained and has good conchoidal fracture. The three sites
are densely covered with debris from testing and preparation of material.
The Van Horn Mountain quarry (41CU389) is on a mesa in Study Area 4,
the Van Horn Mountains, Area 2. The material is scattered over an area of about
9,000 mz and consists of broken nodules that have eroded out of the limestone
cap. The raw material is spotted and/or marbled combinations of moderate
red(5R5/4) to grayish red (5R4/2) and very pale orange (10YRS/2) (Rock Color
Chart Committee 1984). It has a medium- to fine-grained, matte texture and
excellent conchoidal fracture. Debris from testing and preparation of material is
scattered over the area.
Pebbles and boulders of a felsite quarry (41 HZ397) are scattered among the
pediment gravels in Study Area 6, Carrizo Mountains, Area 2. The coarse- to
fine-grained material is extremely hard and dense. Colors are dark reddish
brown (10YR3/4), dark red (5R3/4), moderate red (5R5/4), and grayish red
(5YR4/1 and 5R4/2). Activity areas are easily recognized by the remnants of
pebbles and boulders that have been broken in the initial stages of tool
manufacture.
Two more felsite quarries (41CU441 and CU443) are on terraces 300
meters and 500 meters east of 41HZ397. The materials and preparation areas
are like those at site 41HZ397.
Tumbled fragments of agate, jasper, and chalcedony are found in the gravels, which are identical to those at the three felsite quarries.
An additional source for raw material in the north end of the Wylie
Mountains has been described by Joe Ben Wheat (personal communication
1988), and by Garry and Sally Elder (personal communication 1987). The
precise location has not been recorded because of lack of access to the property,
but a type site, 41CU424, has been identified about 3,200 meters from the area
pointed out by Wheat and the Elders. About 60 to 75 percent of the lithics on the

136

Texas Archeological Society

site are of the distinctive agate that looks like butterscotch taffy. Colors vary
from light brown (5YR5/6) and dark yellowish brown (10YR6/6) to moderate
brown (5YR4/4) (Rock Color Chart Committee 1984). This agate is found
throughout the basin.
Ring Middens
Five ring midden sites were recorded. Greer (1968:127) defines a ring
midden as a "doughnut-shaped structure appearing as a ring of mounded hearthstones, ash, or a combination of these surrounding a depression of almost rockfree gray ash." Creel (1981:175) reported that 170 such features in the Eagle
Mountains were 8 to 10 meters in diameter with rings 2 to 3 meters wide, and
were only rarely more than 30 cm high.
Site 41CU416 has five ring midden features, apparently partially buried,
ranging between 5 and 11 meters in diameter with central depressions ranging
between 3 and 8 meters in diameter; heights vary from 10 to 20 cm. The
middens are on the flatlands below and on a saddle in the limestone hills west of
the Apache Mountains in the Plateau Complex Study Area. Associated cultural
debris is light and scattered and consists, in addition to a single mano, of chips
and flakes.
Site 41HZ396 has two ring middens and one piled rock hearth. The
middens have outside diameters of 7 and 8 meters and central depression
diameters of 2.8 and 3.5 meters; heights are 10 to 20 cm. Diameter of the hearth
is 1.5 meters. The partially buried site is on a gravel terrace in the Carrizo
Mountains, Area 1. Associated cultural material consists of chips and flakes.
Rock Circle
Two rock circle sites were recorded. Site 41CU378 is on top of and on
ledges near the top of a limestone hill east of Michigan Draw in the Plateau
Complex Study Area. The site has 18 rock circle features 1.2 to 3 meters in
diameter (Figure 2). The location provides an unobstructed view for at least 60
km (about 40 miles) in all directions. There appear to be no interior features or
stratigraphy, and the purpose of the circles is unknown. Mallouf visited the site
in 1985 and determined that these features are not the same as the circular stone
enclosures of the Cielo complex (Mallouf 1985:Figure 58). Similar rock circles
are found in the Jornada del Muerto of southern New Mexico and may be
observation posts of the historic Apache Indians (Jay Sharp, personal communication 1988). The site is on the same hill as 41CU349, one of the white chert
quarries.
Site 41CU384 is on a small hill of volcanic tuff in the southern Wild Horse
Draw area of the Lobo Valley. The four rock circle features, lying directly on
bed rock, are 3 to 5 meters in diameter. The circles are similar in construction to those at 41CU378 and also afford an unobstructed view in all directions.

Rock Art

Two rock art sites were recorded. Site 41CU446 is on sandstone boulders in
a canyon of the Van Horn Mountains. The petroglyphs are mainly a series of
random straight and wavy lines. Identifiable elements are a sunburst, several
circles, and one handprint.
The second rock art site (41CU259) was recorded originally by Jackson
(1938). It is on conglomerate sandstone boulders near a small range of hills in
the eastern part of the Plateau Complex Study Area. The petroglyphs consist of
straight and wavy lines, and circles.
Lithic Concentrations and Scatters
Lithic concentrations and scatters are defined in this report as areas of
chipped stone debris and chipped stone tools that have no discernible associated
features. Lithic concentrations have moderate to heavy density; scatters have
light to moderate density. Cultural materials may include cores, flakes, chips,
tools, and projectile points. Five of these sites were recorded, averaging 2,500
mz in size.

138

Texas Archeological Society
Isolated Hearths

Three isolated hearths--single hearths with or without associated cultural
material--were recorded. Cultural material, which, when present, is of light to
moderate density and scattered, may include chipped stone debris and artifacts.
These hearths apparently are single or short-term occupation areas that were
used for food preparation, for keeping warm, or in hunting and gathering
activities.
Cairns
The only cairn site, 41CU442, comprises five distinct piles of large rocks on
a gradual slope below the terrace between the felsite quarries, 41CU441 and
CU443. The most concentrated pile of rocks measures about 80 by 200 cm and
is 30 to 40 cm high. The remaining four are scattered in more or less circular
patterns 1.5 to 3 meters in diameter. These features are similar to a cache
reported by Betancourt and Ralph (1981b:105, 106, Figure 19) on a high saddle
in the Hueco Mountains.
Isolated Finds

The only isolated find (a single artifact with no associated features or
evidence of activity) of the survey, recorded as site 41CU373, is a Folsom point
fragment. The point, which has a broken base, measures 30 mm long and 23 mm
wide; it is made from butterscotch agate. Three tiny flakes of different materials, possibly unrelated to the point, were nearby.
Study Areas

Study Area lmPlateau Complex
Study Area 1--Plateau Complex is the best known of the study areas. It has
been the focus of attention for many years (Hedrick 1968, 1975, 1986), and
about 80 percent of it has been surveyed. The area lies between the eastern
slopes of the Wylie Mountains and the western and southern slopes of the
Apache Mountains (Figure 3). Water resources are Michigan Draw, China
Draw, Plateau Draw, and the northern part of Wild Horse Draw. A chain of
mesquite-stabilized, aeolian dune fields on packed sand extends northward from
the southern end of Michigan Draw, near its intersection with Bunton Draw, and
then northwestward across the basin to North Wild Horse Draw. The dune field
is moderately covered with mesquite and yucca of Zone A, and the dune fields
on the eastern side of Michigan Draw have been partially destroyed by the
introduction of watermelon and cotton fields. A series of limestone hills to the
west of the Apache Mountains have a moderate cover of Zone B vegetation-sotol, agave, prickly pear, cholla, and ocotillo.
The Plateau complex includes 69 sites; 38 (55 percent) are campsites, and
21 (30 percent) are base camps. Four of the quarries--the Purple-Tan chert

quarry (41CU449) and the white chert quarries (41CU349, CU372, CU379)-are also in the complex. The other six sites are a lithic scatter, a ring midden, an
isolated hearth, a rock circle, a rock art display, and an isolated find. Most of the
sites are eroded and are covered and uncovered depending on climatic conditions. This covering and uncovering has caused a mixing of components;
however, the cultural remains at several of the sites have not been subjected to
this erosion-caused blending.

140

Texas Archeological Society

Campsites and Base Camps
Campsite and base camp features include many multiple--sometimes overlapping--hearths, scattered burned rock, and areas of fire-blackened sand.
Density of cultural debris is moderate in general and moderate to heavy around
hearths.
Artifacts include chips, flakes, utilized flakes, retouched flakes, choppers,
hammerstones, knives, scrapers, bifaces, cores, gravers, mano and metate fragments, and ceramics. Dart points and arrowpoints are complete, broken, and in
all stages of manufacture. Most of the finer artifacts such as projectile points,
chips, and flakes were made of raw material from the Purple-Tan and white
chert quarries. Many larger artifacts such as choppers, large knives, and hammerstones were made of stone from the felsite quarry across the basin in Study
Area 6, the Carrizo Mountains, Area 2.
Site 41CU348 is a base camp measuring 120 by 60 meters on a mesquitestabilized dune terrace east of Michigan Draw. Features include rock hearths 50
to 80 cm in diameter, burned sand areas, and a ring midden of burned limestone
7 meters in diameter and 30 to 40 cm high. The rocks in the midden apparently
were brought in from the limestone hills about 500 meters to the east. Cultural
materials include chipped stone tools and debris. Fragments of ground stone
tools were also noted. The site is on the edge of a draw, 500 meters from
a quarry.
Site 41CU361 is a base camp measuring 275 by 80 meters on an isolated
dune terrace on the edge of Michigan Draw. The terrace is apparently eroded
and has become isolated from the other dune ridges. Below the mesquitestabilized dunes is a hard-packed sand deposit that apparently was the original
formation of the terraces along the draw.
Features include many isolated and overlapping hearths 50 to 80 cm in
diameter in strata stair-stepped from the erosion of the dunes, and several areas
of concentrated lithic debris may be work areas. Cultural debris is dense and
includes chipped stone tools and debris and ground stone tool fragments.
Another base camp (41CU370), measuring 150 by 50 meters, is also on the
dune terrace on the edge of Michigan Draw. The site slopes from east to west
providing protection from the extensive erosion and sand movement that occur
on most of the dune sand sites. Features include rock hearths, burned rock
scatters, and a ring midden 7 to 8 meters in diameter. Cultural debris is dense
and, in some areas, is concentrated around the hearths.
Base camp 41CU444, measuring 200 by 100 meters, is on a sand-covered
limestone hill and saddle about 2 km northeast of Plateau Draw. Features
include rock hearths, burned rock scatters, lithic debris, a ring midden 7 meters
in diameter, and an 80-by-150-cm rock caim. Cultural debris is dense.
Study Area 2---Central and Southern Wild Horse Draw
Spot surveys in Study Area 2--Central and Southern Wild Horse Draw
(Figure 4) have been conducted near the community of Lobo and in the area east

Hedrick-- Culberson County

141

of Van Horn. Wild Horse Draw drains the western slopes of the Chispa and
Wylie mountains and the eastern slopes of the Van Horn Mountains. The area is
a combination of bench terraces--some with low sand dunes--and flatlands,
and there is a small volcanic hill in the center of the area near Lobo. Large areas
of the Lobo Valley around Wild Horse Draw are under cultivation or are
abandoned fields. Vegetation in uncultivated areas includes creosote, mesquite,
and grasses characteristic of Zone A.

Texas Archeological Society

The 12 sites in this study area consist of seven campsites, one base camp,
one lithic scatter, two isolated hearths, and one rock circle. Sites are on low
dune terraces and in eroded, exposed flatlands. The cultural debris, scattered in
all sites and ranging between light and moderate in density, consists of chips,
flakes, hammerstones, cores, and complete and fragmentary dart points and
arrowpoints. Mano and metate fragments were observed in the campsites and
base camp. Some moderate concentrations were found around hearths in the
base camp. Chipped stone tools are of material from a variety of sources, about
half of which are identifiable.
Campsites and base camp are smaller and their concentrations of cultural
materials are less dense than in sites in Study Area 1, the Plateau complex. The
remaining sites are small, scattered, and isolated along the draw.
Study Area 3mVan Horn Mountains Area 1
Study area 3--Van Horn Mountains Area 1 is in the western and northern
drainages of the Van Horn Mountains (Figure 4), an area that includes mountain
canyons, deep arroyos, alluvial and colluvial gravel ridges and terraces, and
mountain slopes. Vegetation zones vary from the agave and sotol of Zone B to
oak and sumac of Zone C.
At this time, only a few parts of Study Area 3--Van Horn Mountains, Area
1 have been surveyed. Eight sites have been recorded--five campsites, one base
camp, and two rockshelters. Cultural materials consist of chips, flakes, utilized
flakes, bifaces, complete and fragmentary projectile points, knives, scrapers,
choppers, cores, and core fragments. A predominance of heavy tools, i.e.,
choppers, knives, large scrapers, and large bifaces, primarily of felsite, apparently were made for food processing.
Lithic sources for the artifacts in Study Area 3--Van Horn Mountains Area
1 include felsite quarry materials, exotics such as chalcedony, agate, and jasper,
and materials from unknown sources. Purple-Tan, white, and butterscotch quarry
sources are represented, but much less frequently than in basin sites.
Study Area 4--Van Horn Mountains Area 2
Study Area 4--Van Horn Mountains, Area 2 (Figure 4) is on the upper
plateaus and mesa tops of the central part of the mountains. Vegetation is
primarily the agave, sotol, cholla, and prickly pear of Zone B with occasional
oak and juniper of Zone C.
From occasional brief surveys that have been conducted in this study area,
five sites---one rockshelter, one quarry, two lithic scatters, and one rock art
site-- have been recorded. The quarry (41CU389) and rock art site (41CU446)
have been described above. Lithic samples from all sites indicate a preponderance of felsite and the spotted material from quarry site 41CU389, but lesser
quantities of materials from other quarries are also present.
The rockshelter 41CU294, variously known as Lodge Cave, Lookout shelter, or Blue Finger shelter, is one of the sites that previously had been reported to

Hedrickm Culberson County

143

the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. It is in the conglomerate tuff
formation of the central part of the Van Horn Mountains. The shelter is 25
meters across at the opening, 7.5 meters deep, and 6 meters high at the drip line.
It has a large, steep, dark-colored talus-slope midden in front. The cultural
deposits at both sides of the interior have been vandalized, but the central part of
the shelter appears to be undisturbed. Fragments of cordage and two dart points
were recovered from the surface of the disturbed area, and a dart point was
recovered from the surface of the exterior talus midden.
Study Area 5--Carrizo Mountains Area I
Study Area 5--Carrizo Mountains, Area 1 (Figure 5) encompasses the
western slopes of the Beach Mountains, the basin between the Beach and
Carrizo mountains, and the eastern slopes of the Carrizos. Eroded sandstone
formations have formed hills, steep terraces, benches, high mesas, and deep
canyons. Hackberry and Carrizo creeks form canyons and eventually flow into
Three-Mile Draw. Vegetation is primarily of Zones C and D: agave, sotol,
prickly pear, cholla, ocotillo, oak, sumac, white thorn acacia, and stands of
juniper; mesquite, and yucca are also found.
Recorded sites are 15 rockshelters, 9 campsites, 4 ring middens, and 1 lithic
scatter. At least one shelter midden has evidence of stratigraphic deposits as
deep as 1.5 meters in eroded areas. Identifiable quarry resources are represented
fairly evenly among the lithic samples from all sites, and there are some exotics
and unknowns.
A rockshelter (41CU406) with interior cultural deposits is in a bench- or
ledge-forming fracture in a contact zone in layered sandstone on the western
slopes of the Beach Mountains. The shelter measures 40 meters across the
opening and is 6 to 12 meters deep. Occupational areas are under the southeastfacing overhang, and apparently undisturbed cultural debris is under the overhang, across the exterior, and down the talus slope.
There are a few very faint rock art elements on the back walls of the shelter.
Several red and yellow pictographs are in such poor condition that no elements
are discernible, but four white pictographs appear to be anthropomorphic and
zoomorphic figures.
Deer shelter (41CU408) is in a steep side canyon in the western Beach
Mountains. This overhang shelter was formed by erosion and weathering of the
Van Horn conglomerate sandstone formation. The overhang is 24 meters wide at
the opening, 4.5 meters deep, and 2.5 meters high. There are no stratified
cultural deposits, but three bedrock mortars are in the floor below the overhang,
and a few flakes and chips of cultural material are scattered about.
On the ceiling of the southwest-facing shelter is what appears to be a prepared charcoal-colored background measuring 3 by 4 meters on which a tannishwhite deer (Figure 6) is painted. The deer is 1.7 meters long and has a body
thickness of 46 cm.; the painting is in excellent condition, showing only slight
weathering. This figure conveys the sense of being early historic Indian in origin.

could be the resource area for these materials. Vegetation is primarily Zone A
grassland with creosote and occasional mesquite, yucca, and ocotillo.
This study area is another that has received only superficial examination.
The three felsite quarries (41HZ398, CU441, and CU443) and one cairn
(41CU442), discussed earlier, are the only sites recorded.
Diagnostic Artifacts
Ceramics
Two hundred eighty-nine sherds were recorded from 55 (43 percent) of the
127 surveyed sites. The frequency ranges from a single sherd to a maximum of
39 sherds on a Plateau complex base camp. Ceramics represent a mixture of
cultural associations and are found throughout the region (Table 4). Because
most of the recorded sites are in the Plateau complex and Carrizo Mountains,
Area 1, it is not unexpected that most of the sherds are from those two areas.
Specifically, they are from the base camps and campsites of the Plateau complex
and the middens associated with shelters in the Carrizo Mountains, Area 1.
Ceramics represent varied origins, primarily the Jornada Branch of the
Mogollon culture and northern Mexico. They are apparently considerably less
dense in the Plateau complex and the Carrizo Mountains Study Areas than in the

Guadalupe Mountains to the north ~helps 1974:136,147); this supports Mallouf’s
theory (1985:130) that "ceramics become more rare as one progresses southward."
Projectile Points

Ninety-one projectile points were recorded during the survey; 58 percent
are made of local quarry material (Table 5).
Projectile points that could be assigned to recognized types include 32
arrowpoints and 28 dart points (Table 6).
Many dart points and arrowpoints made of local material do not fit into any
established typology. They may be variants of recognized types or they may be
undescribed types peculiar to the Trans-Pecos or a part of it.
DISCUSSION

The study region, situated as it is in a natural basin and range corridor,
provides a north-south passageway from the Davis Mountains northward to the
Guadalupe Mountains and Salt Basin. The density of sites and cultural debris in
the region indicates that it was inhabited extensively through time; it is reasonable
to presume that migrating animal and human populations followed this corridor.
Establishment of northern Chihuahua desert-shrub communities began
around 8000 B.P. (Van Devender and Spaulding 1979). This provided a stable
and diverse plant community in the basin, hills, slopes, and mountains--a
substantial resource base for hunting and gathering. Features and artifacts
reflect these activities, as well as those of tool manufacture and repair.
Salt, extensively available cherts, felsites, and other lithic resources undoubtedly contributed to the attractiveness of the corridor, and uplifted, fractured, and eroded limestone and sandstone mountain and canyon formations
provided numerous shelters. Sandstone fragments were readily available as
raw materials for one-handed wedge manos and basin and slab metates
(Hedrick 1975).
Base camps, campsites, and shelters are situated near plant communities
and lithic and water resources. Cultural materials indicate occupation from
Archaic to Late Prehistoric times and therefore point to an efficient, successful
adaptation to a relatively stable environment.
Resources of the quarries in the region were used extensively through time
and appear in all forms of artifacts and in all parts of the area. There is evidence
of preference for specific resource materials for specific tool types, i.e., felsite
was used for heavier and larger tools; the finer cherts and exotics (agate, jasper,
and chalcedony) were used for projectile points and smaller tools. Projectile
points from the survey and private collections show this to be particularly true in
all Archaic through Late Prehistoric periods.
From the density of the debitage, tools, and projectile points recorded at
sites, it can be inferred that prehistoric populations occupied the area long
enough to locate and make extensive use of the enornous quantities of local
lithic resources.

Many Livermore and Toyah arrowpoints made of local material indicate
that this is a core area for Kelley’s (1957) Livermore focus. There also appears
to be interaction between prehistoric populations in the Late Prehistoric as
evidenced by the presence of Jornada and northern Mexican ceramics. However,
contact with the Jornada does not appear to have been in a settlement situation
but rather in forays or trade. There simply is not enough ceramic evidence to
indicate that the Jornada presence in the area was more than transient.
A large percentage of projectile points from the eastern Trans-Pecos, Big
Bend, and Lower Pecos areas in both the survey and private collections are made
of local materials. They provide the strongest affirmation of continuous occupation of the corridor from Paleo-Indian through Late Prehistoric times. A predominance of points of temporally diagnostic types made from local materials
indicates that the area was occupied more intensely from Middle Archaic through
the Late Prehistoric times and possibly into the early historic era. The highest
density of occupation appears to be in the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric
periods.
