MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) was selected by BIO-WEST, Inc. (BIOWEST) on behalf of CPB Water, LLC (CPB) to conduct an intensive cultural resources inventory
and assessment for the proposed Desert Hills Pipeline Project in Reeves County, Texas. The
overall proposed undertaking would involve constructing approximately 10.6 kilometers
(6.6 miles) of subsurface water pipeline in Culberson and Reeves counties, Texas. The majority
of the proposed project is not subject to regulatory jurisdiction; however, a 0.8-kilometer (0.5-mile)
long segment of the proposed pipeline in Reeves County crosses lands owned and operated by
the Texas General Land Office (GLO). The portion of the project area located on Texas GLO
lands is situated near the Reeves-Culberson county line approximately 6.4 kilometers (4.0 miles)
south of the Texas-New Mexico state line and approximately 16.9 kilometers (10.5 miles)
northwest of the community of Orla. For purposes of the cultural resources survey, the project
area was considered to consist of the 0.8-kilometer- (0.5-mile-) long proposed right-of-way (ROW)
on Texas GLO lands within a 30.5-meter- (100.0-foot-) wide linear corridor, covering an area of
2.6 hectares (6.5 acres).
The proposed project is being sponsored by CPB, a privately owned company, on a parcel
that is owned and operated by the Texas General Land Office (GLO); as such, the project would
fall under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of Texas (Natural Resources Code, Title 9,
Chapter 191). No federal permits, licenses, or funding have been identified for the project at this
time. As the project represents a publicly sponsored undertaking, the project sponsor is required
to provide the Texas Historical Commission (THC), which serves as the State Historic
Preservation Office (SHPO) for the state of Texas, with an opportunity to review and comment on
the project’s potential to adversely affect historic properties listed on or considered eligible for
designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL) under the Antiquities Code of Texas.
On August 1, 2018, Horizon archeological technicians Jacob Lyons and Jared Wiersema,
under the overall direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, performed an intensive
archeological survey of the project area to locate any cultural resources that potentially would be
impacted by the proposed undertaking. The survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities
Permit no. 8513. Horizon’s archeologists traversed the tract and thoroughly inspected the modern
ground surface for aboriginal and historic-age cultural resources. The proposed ROW traverses
a relatively remote desert upland setting. Vegetation includes mesquite, yucca, creosote, prickly
pear, ephedra, with short, sparse clump grasses and thorny underbrush.

Management Summary

In addition to pedestrian walkover, the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per 1.6 kilometers (1.0 mile) of linear
survey corridor per 30.5-meter- (100.0-foot-) wide transect. As such, a total of eight shovel tests
would be required within the 0.8-kilometer- (0.5-mile-) long by 30.5-meter- (100.0-foot-) wide
linear project area. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of nine shovel tests.
Large chunks of decomposing bedrock were observed on the modern ground surface in the
northern portion of the project area, and sediments within the project area typically consist of
shallow to moderately deep deposits of silty loam overlying limestone or caliche bedrock at depths
ranging from 10.0 to 80.0 centimeters (3.9 to 31.5 inches) below surface. Shovel testing was
capable of fully penetrating sediments with the potential to contain subsurface archeological
deposits, and it is Horizon’s opinion that the pedestrian walkover with surface inspection and
systematic shovel testing was adequate to evaluate the cultural resources potential of the project
area.
No cultural resources, prehistoric or historic-age, were recorded within the project area
during the survey.
Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
potentially significant cultural resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking. In
accordance with 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable
and good-faith effort to identify historic properties within the project area. No cultural resources
were identified within the project area that meet the criteria for designation as SALs according to
13 TAC 26. Horizon recommends a finding of “no historic properties affected,” and no further
cultural resources investigations are recommended in connection with the proposed undertaking.
However, human burials, both prehistoric and historic, are protected under the Texas Health and
Safety Code. In the event that any human remains or burial objects are inadvertently discovered
at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance in the project area, even in
previously surveyed areas, all work should cease immediately in the vicinity of the inadvertent
discovery, and the THC should be notified immediately.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The project area is located in a remote desert setting in West Texas. While no natural
waterbodies traverse the project area, China Draw flows northeastward to the southeast of the
study area, discharging into the Pecos River to the northeast and of the project area. In this area,
the Pecos River has been artificially impounded Red Bluff Reservoir. Physiographically, the study
area is situated on alluvial flats within the Pecos River watershed, and a prominent knoll arises in
the approximate center of the project area.

2.2

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

Geologically, the study area traverses a mosaic of Quaternary deposits of Late
Pleistocene and Holocene age (Qal and Qao) (BEG 1975, 1983). The older (Pleistocene-age)
deposits are composed of alluvium colluvium, caliche, and gypsite on surfaces dissected by
modern drainages, and the younger (Holocene-age) deposits consist of alluvium and low terrace
deposits. The project area is situated on the Holoman-Reeves Association, gently undulating
(20), which consists of shallow loam and clay loam sediments overlying gypsiferous bedrock
(Table 1; Figure 4).

Desert Hills Pipeline Project, Receipt Points B and C Segments, Reeves County, Texas

In West Texas, aboriginal cultural resources are commonly encountered on alluvial flats
and terraces adjacent to prominent streams, washes, and playas, as well as in upland settings.
The relative antiquity of the upland setting suggests that any aboriginal cultural resources that
may be present within the project area would be constrained to the modern ground surface and/or
in shallowly buried contexts in erosional settings lacking integrity and depth.
Historic-age cultural resources may be present in virtually any physiographic setting,
though they are most common in urban areas and in rural settings suitable for agriculture. The
relative remoteness of the project area from any historical population centers and the absence of
standing structures on modern aerial imagery and on historical US Geological Survey (USGS)
topographic maps and aerial photographs suggests that the project area has a low potential for
historic-age architectural or archeological resources.

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The project area falls within the Trans-Pecos region of West Texas, which extends from
El Paso on the west to the Pecos River on the east, with the Rio Grande and New Mexico defining
its southern and northern boundaries, respectively (Miles and Kenmotsu 2004). Included within
this region are El Paso, Hudspeth, Culberson, Brewster, Presidio, Jeff Davis, Pecos, and Reeves
counties.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 10,000 TO 6000 B.C.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 12,000 B.P. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists have historically discounted claims of much earlier human
occupation during the Pleistocene glacial period. However, recent investigations of the Buttermilk
Creek Complex in Bell County, Texas, have raised the possibility that a pre-Clovis culture may
have been present in North America as early as 15,500 years ago (Waters et al. 2011).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in West Texas is represented by
the PaleoIndian period (10,000 to 6000 B.C.). This stage coincided with ameliorating climatic
conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that witnessed the extinction of herds of
mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing various periods within this stage are
characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often fluted, lanceolate projectile points.
These points are frequently associated with spurred end scrapers, gravers, and bone foreshafts.
PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized into egalitarian bands consisting of
a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic subsistence and settlement pattern. Due
to poor preservation of floral materials, PaleoIndian subsistence patterns are known primarily
through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence focused on the exploitation of plants, small
animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the PaleoIndian period. There is little evidence in this
region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as has been documented elsewhere in North America.
Rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern appears to have been practiced throughout all
prehistoric time periods. In most regions, the PaleoIndian stage is divided into two periods based
on recognizable differences in projectile point styles. These include the Early PaleoIndian period,

H011-180187

11

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

which is recognized based on large, fluted projectile points (i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San
Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late PaleoIndian period, which is characterized by unfluted
lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview, Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 6,000 B.C. TO A.D. 900/1000)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend marks the beginning of the Archaic period
(6000 B.C. to A.D. 900/1000). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant
reorientation of lifestyle throughout most of North America. The changing climatic conditions and
corresponding decrease in the big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a
diversified resource base composed of smaller game and wild plants. In West Texas, notable
developments include the first archeological evidence for agriculture, habitation of residential
pithouse or hut structures, and the widespread use of rock or caliche in the construction and use
of thermal features. The appearance of a more diversified tool kit, the development of an
expanded groundstone assemblage, and a general decrease in the size of projectile points are
hallmarks of this cultural stage. Material culture shows greater diversity during this broad cultural
period, especially in the application of groundstone technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
Changes in projectile point morphology are often used as markers differentiating these three
subperiods, though other changes in material culture occurred as well. In addition, the increasing
density of prehistoric sites through time is often considered to constitute evidence of population
growth, though differential preservation probably at least partially accounts for the lower numbers
of older sites.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. A.D. 900/1000 TO 1550)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric (or Formative) period (A.D. 900/1000 to 1550)
encompasses several important transitions in prehistoric settlement adaptations. In the TransPecos region, a relatively rapid succession of changes in architectural forms, settlement structure,
subsistence, and technology occurred, including a decrease in mobility and a corresponding
increase in agricultural dependence and specialization. While the agriculturally based Puebloan
occupations of the Jornada and La Junta regions have received the most attention, the aboriginal
occupants of the Trans-Pecos region were affected to some degree by these significant cultural
changes. The Late Prehistoric period in West Texas is generally divided into three phases—
Mesilla (A.D. 900 to 1100), Doña Ana (A.D. 1100 to 1200), and El Paso (A.D. 1200 to 1400)
(Lehmer 1948). Commonly cited characteristics of the Mesilla phase include insubstantial
pithouse architecture, El Paso brownware ceramics, and nonlocal ceramic wares such as
Mimbres whiteware. Architectural forms during the subsequent Doña Ana phase expanded to
include pithouses as well as surface rooms and the presence of a wider variety of nonlocal
ceramic wares, including bichrome and polychrome ceramics. The El Paso phase, considered to
be the apex of cultural development in the region, was marked by habitation in pueblos by
agriculturally dependent populations, a more restricted settlement pattern focused on well
watered landforms, and greater levels of social complexity.

3.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1550 A.D. TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when Alonso
Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Álvar Núñez
Cabeza de Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near
Galveston Bay. However, European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until
after 1700. The first half of the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission
system, as well as the first effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native
culture and social systems. By the time that heavy settlement of Texas began in the early 1800s
by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous Indian population was greatly diminished.
When the expedition of Antonio de Espejo arrived near Toyah Lake in what is now
northeastern Reeves County in 1583, they were guided by Jumanos Indians to La Junta1. Settlers
of Mexican descent farmed in the county’s Madera Valley from early times. In 1849, John S. Ford
traveled along Toyah Creek and noted the productive land upon which the Mescalero Indians
cultivated corn. Farmers of Mexican descent who irrigated from San Solomon Spring in the last
half of the 19th century found a lucrative market for grains, vegetables, and beef at Fort Davis.
The first Anglo farmers arrived in Toyah Valley in 1871, when George B. and Robert E. Lyle began
irrigating crops from Toyah Creek. Open-range ranching first attracted white settlers to the Davis
Mountains in 1875.
By 1881, the Texas and Pacific Railway built tracks through Reeves County. At that time,
section houses were constructed at Pecos and Toyah, which opened a post office that year and
later became a shipping point for local ranchers. Pecos was named the seat of government when
Reeves County was separated from Pecos County in 1883 and organized in 1884. Pecos
constructed a three-room school in 1883 and opened a post office in 1884. The county was
named for Confederate colonel George R. Reeves. The name of the first community was
Saragosa, which opened a post office in 1884. The name was changed to Lyles in 1891 and to
Toyahvale in 1894. By 1885, when several ranchers herded cattle on the northern range of the
county, Pecos reported 150 residents and Toyah had 60. By 1890, the county population had
expanded to 1,247, including seven African Americans, 15 Chinese, and 351 foreign-born
residents. In that year, a second railroad, the Pecos River, constructed 86.9 kilometers
(54.0 miles) of tracks from Pecos to the New Mexico line along the river, providing transportation
for local agricultural products. In 1894, a post office was established at Brogado, 14.5 kilometers
(9.0 miles) southeast of Pecos, and Toyah built its first school. By 1899, Toyahvale had a public
school district with three schools. During the 1899 to1900 school term, the Pecos school had
111 students and three teachers. A second school was added for the 1900 to 1901 term with
148 pupils and four teachers. A second community called Saragosa, located in the southernmost
part of the county, was designated as a post office in 1900. In that year, the census reported a
total of 1,847 county residents, including 474 foreign-born, 12 African Americans, and 10 Chinese.
In 1902, Toyah organized its first church. Reeves County reported five manufacturing
establishments that employed 16 workers at wages totaling $8,835 and made products worth

$30,085 in 1900. Manufacturers increased to nine by 1920, with 62 employees earning just over
$88,000 and producing $187,000 worth of goods. From 1940 to 1967, the number of
manufacturers grew from five to 17, but that number declined to 11 in 1982. The values of
production over those years increased from $165,807 in 1940 to $3.6 million by 1977, but
manufacturing remained secondary to agriculture and petroleum in the county economy.
The census of 1900 showed 63 farms countywide, of which 41 were operated by owners
and 22 by tenants. Farms comprised nearly 900,000 acres and had 51,000 cattle. In that year,
the agricultural economy of Reeves County was affected when the state ended free use of its
land. Agents were sent across West Texas to collect rents from ranchers on public land. Between
1901 and 1905, however, state law permitted sale of school lands in West Texas, allowing
individuals to purchase four sections of land on generous credit terms. Reeves and other West
Texas counties experienced a rush of new settlers, which continued even after the law was
changed in 1905 to award land to the highest bidder. Between 1903 and 1913, several new
communities developed, but most were ephemeral. Both Alamo, renamed Pera in 1905, and
Dixieland opened post offices in 1903. Other towns receiving post offices included Panama in
1904, Orla in 1906, and Hermosa and Arno in 1907. Balmorhea began operation of both a school
and a post office in 1908, and post offices were organized in 1910 at Pyle, Mont Clair, and
Angeles; the latter moved to Orla some time later. Hoban received a post office in 1911 and
Crystal Water in 1913. By the 1990s, however, only the post offices at Orla and Balmorhea were
still in existence. The 1910 census reflects the effects of the school-land rush after 1901, showing
the population had more than doubled in a decade to 4,392, including 408 foreign-born,
13 Chinese, and 82 African American residents. Though the value of farms in the same period
doubled to reach $4.4 million, only 12 bales of cotton and small grain crops were harvested on
more than 15,000 acres of farmland as most Reeves County farmers continued to operate
subsistence farms. Although the number of farms climbed to 225, and most were owneroperated, improved acres dropped below 600,000. Cattle herds were reduced to less than
7,000 head, and only milk cows and chickens increased in numbers.
In 1911, the Pecos Valley Southern Railway completed tracks from Pecos to Toyahvale,
allowing improved transportation of agricultural products. A drought swept across the county in
1916, however, and many families who had come during the school-land rush gave up their farms
and moved away. By 1920, the population had grown only slightly to 4,457, including 17 African
Americans, four Chinese, and 666 foreign-born residents. While farms decreased to only 206,
operated by 140 owners and 66 tenants, farm value increased to $7.1 million. Numbers of range
cattle increased to nearly 37,000, and sheep climbed to almost 2,500. More than 16,000 acres
were farmed, and 1,846 bales of cotton and 16,000 tons of hay led production of a wide variety
of grain and vegetable crops. In the early 1920s, Pecos became the focus of Delaware Basin oil
exploration and received substantial publicity, though little oil and gas were found in paying
quantities. By 1930, however, oil excitement had brought a larger and more diversified population
to the county. Of a total of 6,407 residents, 178 were African American and 56 foreign-born from
15 countries.
Reeves County felt the impact of the Great Depression and the earlier drought, as
cultivation of crops continued to decline into the 1930s. In 1930, the number of farms had risen

14

180187_arch_survey_report

Intensive Cultural Resources Inventory Survey for the Proposed
Desert Hills Pipeline Project, Receipt Points B and C Segments, Reeves County, Texas

slightly to 327, but farm tenancy increased. Only 114 farms were operated by owners, and 213 by
tenants. Cotton remained a strong crop with 3,200 bales harvested, and over 7,000 tons of forage
was produced on nearly 3,000 acres. Overall numbers of livestock decreased, and the value of
livestock fell to half of its earlier total, though cattle numbers remained at nearly 24,000 head. By
1940, the county population climbed to 8,006. Farms fell to 277, and tenant farmers continued to
outnumber owners. Livestock production, valued at over $1 million, dominated agriculture, with
only $376,031 produced by crops. By 1950, the population increased sharply to 11,745, including
280 non-white residents. Educational levels in that year were reflected by 1,015 high school and
415 college graduates in the county’s population. The Toyah field, a gas-producing area, was
discovered in 1952, and the Geraldine-Ford field began production in 1956. Although neither field
was a giant, both added to the economy of the county. In the 1950s, crop values soared to
$224 million, overtaking livestock production, which climbed to $2.5 million. By 1954, a total of
322 farms operated on 1.5 million acres, of which 81,000 were devoted to cropland. By 1959,
however, agriculture had declined, and the number of farms dipped to 261. Livestock values fell
to $2.5 million and crops to $19 million. In 1960, the Reeves County population reached an alltime high of 17,644, including 634 non-white residents. High school graduates represented 9%
of the residents, and 669 were college graduates. The value of livestock rose over the decade,
reaching $12 million by 1969, but the number of farms declined to only 231 in that year, with only
26% of operators living on their farms. By 1970, the population dropped to 16,526. High school
graduates climbed to 37%, and college graduates included 6% of the population. In the 1970s,
Reeves County witnessed the development of three oilfields that added significantly to its
economy—the Athens, Chapman Deep, and San Martine fields. Between 1939 and 1973, the
county produced 37 million barrels of oil. The value of livestock soared to $83 million by 1978 but
dropped to $68 million in 1982, by which time the number of farms had fallen to 149, and 34% of
owners lived on their land.
Although by 1980 West Texas experienced a dramatic oil boom with greatly increased
drilling activity and an influx of new people to fill blue-collar jobs, the population of Reeves County
fell to 15,801 in that year, of which 3% were African American and 62% were Hispanic. In 1982,
the county ranked 27th in the nation in highest percent of residents of Spanish origin. High school
graduates increased to nearly 45% of the population, and college graduates to about 9%. As the
1980s continued, the oil industry declined due to the falling price of crude oil. Primary crops in
the decade included barley, along with cotton, hay, and wheat; farmers also raised significant
numbers of onions, bell peppers, peaches, and pecans. Business establishments in the county
numbered 341, and most workers were employed in tourism, oil and gas extraction, sulfur mining,
cottonseed oil mills, or agribusiness. By 1990, the population was 15,852, of which 347 were
African American, 36 Native American, 36 Asian, and 11,545 Hispanic. The county was served
by two school districts, consisting of seven elementary, two junior high, two senior high, and one
ungraded school. Thirty-seven churches reported a combined membership of nearly 12,000. The
largest denominations were Catholic and Southern Baptist. In the early 1990s, the Reeves
County economy continued to be based on oil and agriculture, supplemented by tourism. As of
2014, 14,349 people lived in the county. Incorporated cities included Balmorhea (population:
504), Pecos (8,870); and Toyah (92); unincorporated communities included Brogado, Orla (80),
Red Bluff, Saragosa (185), Toyahvale (60), and Verhalen.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Prior to initiating fieldwork, Horizon performed background archival research on the THC’s
online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) and the Texas Department of Transportation’s
(TxDOT) Historic Bridges of Texas or Historic Districts & Properties of Texas online databases
for information on previously recorded cultural resources sites and historic properties in and near
the project area as well as previous cultural resources investigations conducted in the vicinity.
Based on this archival research, no known archeological sites, cemeteries, or historic properties
listed on or considered eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or
for designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL) are located within a 1.6-kilometer (1.0-mile)
radius of the project area (THC 2018; TxDOT 2018a, 2018b).
Examination of historical aerial photographs and US Geological Survey (USGS)
topographic maps indicates that the project area has remained undeveloped aside from oil and
gas exploration activities in the surrounding area (NETR 2018).
No prior cultural resources surveys have been conducted within the project area.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

On August 1, 2018, Horizon archeological technicians Jacob Lyons and Jared Wiersema,
under the overall direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, performed an intensive
archeological survey of the project area to locate any cultural resources that potentially would be
impacted by the proposed undertaking. Horizon’s archeologist traversed the tract and thoroughly
inspected the modern ground surface for aboriginal and historic-age cultural resources. The
proposed ROW traverses a relatively remote desert upland setting. Vegetation includes
mesquite, yucca, creosote, prickly pear, ephedra, with short, sparse clump grasses and thorny
underbrush, and ground surface visibility was excellent (effectively 100%) (Figures 5 to 7).
In addition to pedestrian walkover, the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per 1.6 kilometers (1.0 mile) of linear
survey corridor per 30.5-meter- (100.0-foot-) wide transect. As such, a total of eight shovel tests
would be required within the 0.8-kilometer- (0.5-mile-) long by 30.5-meter- (100.0-foot-) wide
linear project area. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of nine shovel tests
(Figure 8). Large chunks of decomposing bedrock were observed on the modern ground surface
in the northern portion of the project area, and sediments within the project area typically consist
of shallow to moderately deep deposits of silty loam overlying limestone or caliche bedrock at
depths ranging from 10.0 to 80.0 centimeters (3.9 to 31.5 inches) below surface. Shovel testing
was capable of fully penetrating sediments with the potential to contain subsurface archeological
deposits, and it is Horizon’s opinion that the pedestrian walkover with surface inspection and
systematic shovel testing was adequate to evaluate the cultural resources potential of the project
area.
All sediments excavated from shovel tests were screened through 6.35-millimeter (0.25inch) hardware cloth. The Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates of all shovel tests
were determined using hand-held Garmin ForeTrex Global Positioning System (GPS) devices
based on the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). Specific shovel test data for all nine
shovel tests excavated during the survey are summarized in Appendix A.
During the archeological field survey, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation,
soils, landforms, survey methods, and shovel test results. Digital photographs were taken, and a
photographic log was maintained. Horizon employed a non-collection policy for cultural
resources. Diagnostic artifacts (e.g., projectile points, ceramics, historic materials with maker’s
marks) and non-diagnostic artifacts (e.g., lithic debitage, burned rock, historic glass, and metal

same location in which they were found. As no cultural materials were observed during the
survey, the collection policy was not brought into play.
The survey methods employed during the survey represented a “reasonable and goodfaith effort” to locate significant archeological and historic-age sites within the project area as
defined in 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800.3.

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The archeological investigations documented in this report were undertaken with three
primary management goals in mind:



Locate all historic and prehistoric archeological resources that occur within the
designated survey area.



Evaluate the significance of these resources regarding their potential for designation
as SALs.



Formulate recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their SAL
evaluations.

At the survey level of investigation, the principal research objective is to inventory the
cultural resources within the APE and to make preliminary determinations of whether or not the
resources meet one or more of the pre-defined eligibility criteria set forth in the state and/or federal
codes, as appropriate. Usually, management decisions regarding archeological properties are a
function of the potential importance of the sites in addressing defined research needs, though
historic-age sites may also be evaluated in terms of their association with important historic events
and/or personages. Under the Antiquities Code of Texas, archeological resources are evaluated
according to criteria established to determine the significance of archeological resources for
designation as SALs.
Analyses of the limited data obtained at the survey level are rarely sufficient to contribute
in a meaningful manner to defined research issues. The objective is rather to determine which
archeological sites could be most profitably investigated further in pursuance of regional,
methodological, or theoretical research questions. Therefore, adequate information on site
function, context, and chronological placement from archeological and, if appropriate, historical
perspectives is essential for archeological evaluations. Because research questions vary as a
function of geography and temporal period, determination of the site context and chronological
placement of cultural properties is a particularly important objective during the inventory process.

7.2

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR LISTING AS A STATE ANTIQUITIES LANDMARK

The criteria for determining the eligibility of a prehistoric or historic cultural property for
designation as an SAL are presented in Chapter 191, Subchapter D, Section 191.092 of the
Antiquities Code of Texas, which states that SALs include:
Sites, objects, buildings, artifacts, implements, and locations of historical, archeological,
scientific, or educational interest including those pertaining to prehistoric and historical
American Indians or aboriginal campsites, dwellings, and habitation sites, their artifacts
and implements of culture, as well as archeological sites of every character that are located
in, on, or under the surface of any land belonging to the State of Texas or to any county,
city, or political subdivision of the state are state antiquities landmarks and are eligible for
designation.

For the purposes of assessing the eligibility of a historic property for designation as an
SAL, a historic site, structure, or building has historical interest if the site, structure, or building:
1. [W]as the site of an event that has significance in the history of the United States or
the State of Texas;
2. [W]as significantly associated with the life of a famous person;
3. [W]as significantly associated with an event that symbolizes an important principle or
ideal;
4. [R]epresents a distinctive architectural type and has value as an example of a period,
style, or construction technique; or,
5. [I]s important as part of the heritage of a religious organization, ethic group, or local
society.

The Antiquities Code of Texas establishes the THC as the legal custodian of all cultural
resources, historic and prehistoric, within the public domain of the State of Texas. Under Part II
of Title 13 of the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26), the THC may designate a historic
building, structure, cultural landscape, or non-archeological site, object, or district as an SAL if it
meets at least on one of following criteria:
A. [T]he property is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to
the broad patterns of our history, including importance to a particular cultural or ethnic
group;
B. [T]he property is associated with the lives of persons significant in our past;
C. [T]he property embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, represents the work of a master, possesses high artistic values, or
represents a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack
individual distinction;
D. [T]he property has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in Texas
culture or history.

Desert Hills Pipeline Project, Receipt Points B and C Segments, Reeves County, Texas

Furthermore, the THC may designate an archeological site as an SAL if the site meets
one or more of the following criteria:
1. [T]he site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory
and/or history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
2. [T]he site’s archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and
intact, thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
3. [T]he site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or
history;
4. [T]he study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of
preservation, thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge; or,
5. [T]he high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur,
and official landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or
alternatively further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and
relic collecting when the site cannot be protected.

SUMMARY OF INVENTORY RESULTS

On August 1, 2018, Horizon archeological technicians Jacob Lyons and Jared Wiersema,
under the overall direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, performed an intensive
archeological survey of the project area to locate any cultural resources that potentially would be
impacted by the proposed undertaking. Horizon’s archeologists traversed the tract and
thoroughly inspected the modern ground surface for aboriginal and historic-age cultural
resources. In addition, Horizon excavated nine shovel tests within the project area, thereby
exceeding the TSMASS requirements for a project area of this length. Large chunks of
decomposing bedrock were observed on the modern ground surface in the northern portion of
the project area, and sediments within the project area typically consist of shallow to moderately
deep deposits of silty loam overlying limestone or caliche bedrock at depths ranging from 10.0 to
80.0 centimeters (3.9 to 31.5 inches) below surface. Shovel testing was capable of fully
penetrating sediments with the potential to contain subsurface archeological deposits, and it is
Horizon’s opinion that the pedestrian walkover with surface inspection and systematic shovel
testing was adequate to evaluate the cultural resources potential of the project area.
No cultural resources, prehistoric or historic-age, were recorded within the project area
during the survey.

7.4

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
potentially significant cultural resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking. In
accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good-faith effort to identify
historic properties within the project area. No cultural resources were identified within the project
area that meet the criteria for designation as SALs according to 13 TAC 26. Horizon recommends
a finding of “no historic properties affected,” and no further cultural resources investigations are
recommended in connection with the proposed undertaking. However, human burials, both

prehistoric and historic, are protected under the Texas Health and Safety Code. In the event that
any human remains or burial objects are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction,
use, or ongoing maintenance in the project area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work
should cease immediately in the vicinity of the inadvertent discovery, and the THC should be
notified immediately.
