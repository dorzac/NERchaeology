ABSTRACT
Between January 26, 2009 and February 6, 2009, archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc. (B&A),
at the request of Melden and Hunt, Inc., and on behalf of McAllen Public Utility, conducted an intensive
non-collection archeological survey of a proposed 70.6-acre raw water reservoir and 2.5 miles of
associated pipeline infrastructure within Hidalgo County Water Improvement District #3 (HCWID#3) in
the City of McAllen. The planned construction would replace the existing Boeye Reservoir and establish
a new pipeline system for the delivery of raw water to existing treatment facilities. Investigations
discovered historic archeological site 41HG225, a section of the McAllen Main Canal and associated substructures (41HG225.1 through 41HG225.5). B&A recommends that 41HG225 is not eligible formal
State Archeological Landmark (SAL) designation as the main canal and sub-structures are contributing
elements of the larger HCWID#3, which has not been sufficiently evaluated for formal SAL designation.
It was beyond the scope of this project to evaluate the entire HCWID#3. No artifacts were collected and
curation was unnecessary for this project.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
PROJECT TITLE: Archeological Survey of a Proposed Raw Water Reservoir and Associated Pipelines
in the City of McAllen, Hidalgo County, Texas.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The project involved an archeological records review and intensive
archeological survey with backhoe trenching prior to the proposed construction of a 70.6-acre raw water
reservoir to replace the existing Boeye Reservoir, as well as roughly 2.8 miles of proposed pipeline
infrastructure for the delivery of raw water from the Rio Grande to existing treatment facilities. As the
proposed construction would be sponsored by McAllen Public Utility and occur on property owned or
administered by the City of McAllen, the project is subject to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of
Texas (ACT). Further, because the construction would be funded in part by the Texas Water
Development Board (TWDB), the project is subject to the provisions of the Memorandum of
Understanding between the TWDB and the Texas Historical Commission (THC). At this time there are no
federal permits or funding involved with the proposed construction so Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act is not applicable.
PROJECT LOCATION: The project area is located in Hidalgo County in the City of McAllen, Texas.
The study area is located on the Pharr, Texas, USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle.
TOTAL ACREAGE: Approximately 97.5 acres.
DATE OF WORK: Between January 26, 2009 and February 6, 2009.
PURPOSE OF WORK: Blanton & Associates, Inc. is assisting the project sponsor in their compliance
with the ACT.
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Brandon S. Young
TEXAS ANTIQUITIES PERMIT No.: 5137
NEWLY RECORDED SITES: 41HG225 (and associated sub-structures 41HG225.1–41HG225.5).
PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES: None.
COMMENTS: Investigations discovered historic archeological site 41HG225, a section of the McAllen
Main Canal and associated sub-structures. Although the proposed construction is not affiliated with the
Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), a July 26, 2004 coordination letter between TxDOT and
THC discussing historic irrigation systems in the Rio Grande valley is applicable. The letter concluded
that “… because these extensive irrigation canal systems established historic development patterns in the
region,…determinations of their eligibility for listing in the NRHP (National Register of Historic Places)
should be based on an understanding of entire systems.” Thus, irrigation districts should be treated as
eligible for inclusion to the NRHP and for formal SAL designation unless “extensive changes occurred
such as those wrought by conversion to pipelines.” Thus, although 41HG225 contains elements dating
from 1903–1904 through the 1950s that retain their historical integrity, not enough of the HCWID #3 has
ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF A PROPOSED MCALLEN PUBLIC UTILITY RESERVOIR AND ASSOCIATED PIPELINE

been evaluated at this time to make a determination of eligibility for the entire district. From the same
letter between TxDOT and THC, it was determined that individual components of an irrigation system
such as main canals, laterals, and pumps are not individually eligible for formal SAL designation or
inclusion to the NRHP. As such, B&A recommends that 41HG225 is not eligible for formal SAL
designation. Extensive backhoe trenching and pedestrian survey throughout the remainder of the project
area discovered no other archeological material.

INTRODUCTION
The McAllen Public Utility proposes to relocate its existing Boeye Reservoir, used for raw water storage,
to a new location south of the existing facility. The existing reservoir covers approximately 50 acres and
is located in south central McAllen within the boundaries of HCWID #3. The project location is shown on
Figures 1 through 3.
Water supply for the existing (and proposed) reservoirs is (would be) delivered by the McAllen Main
Canal, which extends alongside the existing and proposed reservoirs. The canal draws water from the Rio
Grande near Hidalgo, and conveys it northward roughly 5.5 miles to Boeye Reservoir (see Figure 3). The
canal system extends further north and also provides irrigation water between the river and McAllen
through a series of lateral canals and subsurface pipes.
The proposed reservoir would be constructed approximately 1.7 miles south of the existing location and
would occupy 70.6 acres. Triangular in shape, it would be created by excavating fill from the central
portion of the reservoir to create levees. Associated with the new reservoir would be approximately
11,695 linear feet of new raw water transmission pipeline: roughly 1,545 feet of 36-inch pipeline, about
2,475 feet of 54-inch pipeline, and approximately 7,675 feet of 60-inch pipeline. These pipelines would
link the new reservoir with the McAllen Main Canal water supply and treatment facilities. Most of the
new pipeline construction would be located adjacent to the existing McAllen Main Canal and at the
existing reservoir as can be seen in Figures 2 and 3.
Seven subsurface bore sections totaling approximately 4,000 linear feet are proposed to avoid existing
infrastructure (e.g., McAllen-Miller International Airport, the Main Floodway levees and channel, the
McAllen Main Canal, and drainage ditches). The existing reservoir would be demolished and the land
reclaimed for new development. Pipeline construction would require a permanent 30-foot wide easement
and temporary 50-foot wide construction easement on property not owned by the City of McAllen. The
project area is approximately 15,000 feet (2.8 miles) long, a maximum of 80 feet wide and, with the 70.6acre proposed reservoir, encompasses about 97.5 acres. The depth of vertical impacts for the proposed
pipelines and reservoir would be 10 to 15 feet below the existing ground surface on average. Bore
sections would be substantially deeper.
As the proposed construction is sponsored by McAllen Public Utility and would primarily occur on
property owned by the City of McAllen, the project is subject to the provisions of the Texas Antiquities
Code. Because the construction would be funded in part by the TWDB, the project is subject to the
provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the TWDB and the THC. Section 106
of the NHPA is not applicable, as no federal permits or funding is involved with the proposed
construction.
Field investigations were designed to comply with appropriate archeological field methods as defined in
the Department of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the Guidelines of the Council of
Texas Archeologists (1987), and the survey standards developed by the THC in conjunction with the
Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA n.d.).

The primary intent of the survey was to identify and describe all archeological resources discovered
within the study area, evaluate their eligibility for formal SAL designation and, should archeological
historic properties or sites be located, make recommendations for future management options, such as
avoidance and preservation or further investigations.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is located in the lower Rio Grande Valley in south-central Hidalgo County. This area lies
within Fenneman’s (1938) West Gulf Coastal Plain section of the Coastal Plain physiographic province.
Locally, it lies within the Pleistocene to Holocene aged Rio Grande Delta. The project area north of the
Main Floodway has been urbanized and consists of the McAllen-Miller International Airport, city streets,
substantial and often concrete lined drainage ditches, and a mix of commercial and residential properties.
South of the Main Floodway (and within the Main Floodway south of the pilot channel) is agricultural
land currently or very recently cultivated. The proposed reservoir location is agricultural land that, at the
time of investigations, was covered with grain sorghum that had been harvested but not plowed under.
G E OL OG Y
The project area north of the Main Floodway is underlain by the Pleistocene Beaumont Formation that
consists of clay, silt, sand, and gravels. In the immediate project area this formation is dominantly mud
and clay with a high water-holding capacity that includes interdistributary muds, abandoned channel-fill
muds, and fluvial overbank muds (Barnes 1976). From just north of the Main Floodway—itself based
upon a fossil channel (was known as the Sardinas Resaca) of the Rio Grande meanderbelt—to the
proposed reservoir is Holocene alluvium that is dominantly mud or silt. Aronow (in Jacobs 1981) notes
that most of this area is lower than the current course of the Rio Grande and has served as a flood basin
that has been covered with a fairly uniform veneer of floodbasin deposits.
SOI L S
Soils correspond closely with the geology. North of the floodway are Hidalgo soils that are deep,
moderately permeable soils that have a grayish brown silty clay loam surface. These developed on the
Beaumont Formation terrace that skirts the Floodway. South of the Floodway and associated with the
Holocene floodbasin deposits are the deep, silty clays and silty clay loams of the Harlingen-RunnReynosa association.
The project area encompasses three soils: Harlingen clay, Harlingen-Urban land complex, and Runn silty
clay. From the existing Boeye Reservoir to the north bank of the Main Floodway is Harlingen-Urban land
complex. This complex contains Harlingen clay, a dense clayey soil that formed on ancient stream
terraces in thick alluvium, and urban land that has been impacted by a variety of human causes, such as
construction of the McAllen-Miller International Airport (Jacobs 1981). The northern half of the Main
Floodway between the north levee and the pilot channel is mapped as Harlingen clay. South of the Main
Floodway pilot channel to the proposed reservoir Runn silty clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes is present. Runn
silty clay is a deep, dense clayey soil (Jacobs 1981).
F L OR A
The project area lies within the Tamaulipan biotic province as described by Blair (1950). Within this
province, Jahrsdoerfor and Leslie (1988) recognize several biotic communities. Plant communities tend to
follow old flooding patterns and are influenced by weather conditions that become more xeric from east

to west (Vora 1992). Prior to modern settlement, alluvial soils supported dense riparian forests whereas
drier uplands tend to be dominated by spiny shrubs and stunted trees (Blair 1950).
The project area may once have encompasses portions of the mid-valley riparian woodland, mid-delta
thorn forest biotic communities. These biotic community designations have been devised in a conceptual
manner based on geology, soils, hydrology, and small, scattered remnants of undisturbed plant
communities (Vora 1992). Current vegetation consists of agricultural fields most recently used for grain
sorgum and maintained canal right-of-way, airport runway areas, and drainage ditch margins largely
covered with mown bufflegrass and bermudagrass,

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
A review of records at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and data available on the
Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) was conducted prior to field investigations to determine the
presence or absence of previously recorded archeological resources in or adjacent to the project area. The
review indicated that there are no previously recorded archeological sites or prior surveys within or
immediately adjacent to the study area. However, the Ayala Site (41HG1) is approximately 300 meters
west of the project area on the west side of SH 115/23rd Street, along the north bank of the Main
Floodway. This site, along with the Floyd Morris site in Cameron County, led to the definition of the Late
Prehistoric Brownsville Complex (Hester 1969, Hester and Rodgers 1969, Collins, et al. 1969).
It is worth noting that both upstream and downstream from the project area prior surveys in settings
geomorphologically similar to this project area have resulted in few prehistoric archeological sites being
recorded (Whitsett 1992, Whitsett and Jurgens 1992, Kibbler and Freeman 1993, Jurgens and Whitsett
1994, Hubbard 1995, Jones 1995). Most of the sites recorded by these efforts were sparse, surficial, and
disturbed.
Two historic era resources are near the project area. La Piedad Cemetery is adjacent to the southeast
corner of the existing Boeye Reservoir at 1800 Wichita Street (THC designation: Hidalgo County
Cemetery 17). This approximately 12-acre Historic Texas Cemetery contains interments dating from 1895
to the present (TASA).
Also according to TASA, the proposed project area is encompassed by the Louisiana-Rio Grande Canal
Company Irrigation System (L-RGCCIS)/Hidalgo County Irrigation District #2 NRHP District (NRHP
No. 95001284). However, a review of the NRHP nomination form and supporting documents at the THC
indicates that there is a mapping error and the NRHP District is too broadly drawn. The project area is
actually within HCWID #3, which shares a common boundary with Hidalgo County Irrigation District #2
but is west of the NRHP District. Construction of elements associated with the proposed project would
not affect the NRHP District.

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Founded in 1904 when the Hidalgo and San Miguel Extension of the St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico
Railway reached the Santa Anita Ranch, the City of McAllen was not formally incorporated until 1911, at
which time there was a population of approximately 1,000 people in what was then known as West
McAllen (Myers 2005:5). The community that would become part of the City McAllen was called West
McAllen. West McAllen was primarily a tent city, although it did have a general store and restaurant
(Garza 2008). By 1907, a post office was established in West McAllen.
A competing community, East McAllen, was two miles away from West McAllen. By 1908, east
McAllen possessed an irrigation canal, two taverns, five stores, and two lumber yards. It also had the first
brick building (a bank) and the first local newspaper, the McAllen Monitor. By 1911, 5,000 acres were
under cultivation and East McAllen applied for a charter of incorporation. At that point, West McAllen
had ceased to exist and the community of East McAllen became the City of McAllen, eventually
absorbing the former West McAllen area (Garza 2008).
The early economy around nascent McAllen was primarily agricultural and included sugar cane and
citrus, as well as other vegetables and fruits. Farmers from the American Midwest were attracted to the
area because of the long growing season and the possibility of raising a variety of crops, all of which was
possible through the establishment of irrigation systems throughout the region. This, along with the
arrival of the railroad to South Texas allowed farmers to export their goods to larger markets (Vigness
2008). As a result of the railroads and a good climate, more people settled the region and towns sprang up
along the rail lines.
Prior to the construction of the various irrigation canals, the north bank of the Rio Grande River was
considered a wasteland because of the semi-arid landscape due primarily to the high bank on the north
side. This topographic feature necessitated the construction of pump houses for each irrigation district,
and they are considered a necessary component to these districts. The first irrigation districts were
primarily constructed between 1903/1904 and about 1911. Canals were hand excavated, including the
McAllen Main Canal, and led from the Rio Grande River north away from the river.
During the Mexican Revolution, 20,000 American troops were stationed in McAllen so that by 1920, the
population had increased from slightly over 1,000 persons to nearly 6,000 (Garza 2008). As more
Midwestern immigrants settled Hidalgo County during the early 20th century, the Hispanic community
experienced increased difficulties through segregation and limited opportunities (Garza 2008). By the
1930s, an improved economy, which included canning factories, wood-working plants, and oil
exploration, led to a population increase and included over 9000 people (Garza 2008). By the 1940s, a toll
bridge was constructed between the cities of McAllen and Reynosa, thereby increasing trade within the
region and attracting more tourists to the area, particularly during the winter (Garza 2008). Oil was
discovered by the late 1940s, resulting in a significant population increase of Interior Mexicans to the area
(Garza 2008).
By the mid-20th century, agriculture remained a significant portion of the economy, and the irrigation
canals and systems underwent modifications as technology improved. While the main canals remained

CITY OF MCALLEN, HIDALGO COUNTY, TEXAS

open, most laterals were buried underground to help reduce evaporation loss. Standpipes were added to
help maintain water pressure and became a common feature throughout the Valley. Other changes
included routine maintenance (e.g., dredging of canals to remove silt and vegetation) to the various
components and replacements of mechanical parts wherever necessary.
As the 20th century continued, the Valley continued to grow and develop. By the 1970s, McAllen had a
population of approximately 38,000, and by the 1980s, McAllen was one of the three top ports of entry
into Mexico from the US. By the beginning of the 21st century, the population of McAllen was
approximately 106,000 and remained a popular destination for Winter Texans.

METHODS
Investigations consisted of an intensive archeological survey with surface and subsurface investigations to
determine the nature, extent, and if possible, the significance of any archeological resources within the
APE. The survey adhered to THC survey standards (n.d.), as well as the guidelines of the CTA (1987) and
the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983).
Surface investigations consisted of two B&A archeologists conducting a 100 percent pedestrian survey of
the project area. Archeologists utilized 30-meter or less transect intervals to systematically examine the
ground surface for archeological remains. Ground surface visibility within the proposed reservoir average
65 percent as stubble of the last grain sorghum crop had not been plowed under. Elsewhere surface
exposure ranged from zero (due to impervious cover) in the most urban portions to 100 percent along the
proposed 60-inch pipeline route south of the Main Floodway. A 0.9 mile section of proposed 60-inch
pipeline within Miller International Airport was covered by pedestrian survey because of safety, security
and buried airport utilities. As expected given the presence of soils from the Harlingen-Urban land
complex, this area proved to be extensively disturbed.
Because of deep Holocene alluvium from just north of the Main Floodway to the proposed reservoir,
shovel testing there was deemed impractical and subsurface investigations utilized backhoe trenching to
search for buried archeological deposits. Systematic backhoe trenching was conducted south of the Main
Floodway within the proposed reservoir and along the proposed raw water pipelines at bore hole
locations. Backhoe trenches were approximately four meters long, one meter wide, and 1.5 meters deep.
Following excavation, archeologists cleaned and examined trench walls to locate any in situ artifacts,
features, and/or soil anomalies in the trench profiles. Stratigraphy was recorded and all trenches were
plotted with a hand-held Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, photographed, and backfilled.
Several trenches were extended to the maximum practical depth obtainable by the backhoe but
investigators did not enter those trenches. All field investigations were thoroughly photo-documented
with digital cameras. No cultural materials were collected during the survey.
Site documentation involved the recording of the horizontal and vertical extent of discovered
archeological sites within the APE. Collected site data included a description of the site’s environment,
cultural materials noted within the APE, and observations on the continuance of any site that extends
outside of the APE. Six-inch resolution aerial imagery provided a detailed base map for field
investigations that allowed for precise in-the-field delineation (in conjunction with GPS data) of site
boundaries relative to the APE, the location of all backhoe trenches, and the location of any surface
artifacts and/or cultural features.
All sites discovered during fieldwork within the APE were recorded on a Texas Archeological Site Data
Form and then submitted electronically to TARL via the TEXSITE recording system to be assigned a
trinomial. All recorded sites were evaluated with respect to their eligibility for inclusion to the NRHP (as
per 36 CFR 60.4.) or for formal designation as a SAL (Chapter 26.8 of the Texas Antiquities Code). If
site eligibility was uncertain, then a program of further archeological investigations was recommended to
determine eligibility, if any.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
The entire project area has experienced extensive surface and subsurface impacts from urban
development and large scale agricultural practices (Figure 4). The northern segment of the project area—
from the north bank of the Main Floodway to the existing Boeye Reservoir—consists of highly disturbed
soils typical of urbanized areas. The Main Floodway area itself has experienced substantial modification
due to channelization and levee construction. South of the Main Floodway the project area has been
extensively utilized for agricultural purposes. Major disturbances in this segment include the McAllen
Main Canal and its levees, laterals, and underground pipelines. Over 90 percent of the project area
occupies property owned by the City of McAllen, including the proposed impoundment.
A total of 24 backhoe trenches were excavated throughout the study area, with 17 in the proposed
impoundment and seven at or near proposed bore holes along the 36-inch, 54-inch, and 60-inch raw water
pipelines (see Figure 4). Plow zones extending between 30 and 60 centimeters below ground surface were
ubiquitous in the trench profiles, descriptions of which are available in Appendix A. Backhoe trenching,
at the request of Melden & Hunt, was not conducted on the west side of Bore Section 1 (see Figure 4) to
avoid an existing overhead transmission line ROW where there was no right-of-entry. Trenching efforts
discovered no buried archeological material, only deep silt clays of the Rio Grande delta. However, the
project area is not without archeological resources. Present within the project area is a section of the
historic McAllen Main Canal and associated water distribution sub-facilities.
41H G 225, M C A L L E N M A I N C A NA L (A ND A SSOC I A T E D F A C I L I T I E S)
This historic site consists of a section of the McAllen Main Canal and associated water distribution
system infrastructure near and within the agricultural field where the new reservoir is planned (Figure 5).
This primarily linear site extends approximately 6,124 feet from the southwest corner of the proposed
reservoir to just north of the Main Floodway’s North Levee on airport property. The northern site
boundary was delineated there as the remainder of the canal north of the airport was not part of the project
area. Similarly, the site’s southern boundary is defined by the southern limits of the study area near the
southwest corner of the proposed reservoir.
The McAllen Main Canal extends from the Rio Grande (just north of the City of Hidalgo) to the existing
Boeye Reservoir, a distance of approximately 5.5 miles (see Figure 3). Astride the western boundary of
the proposed impoundment facility, the surface canal traverses about 2,880 feet before entering a pipeline
siphon at the South Levee of the Main Floodway (see Figure 3). The canal reemerges just north of the
North Levee and continues 2,035 feet north before being conveyed underground again by pipe beneath
the runways of Miller International Airport to Boeye Reservoir and on to the vicinity of Nolana Loop
approximately 3.4 miles north of the project area. The main canal and other associated water distribution
infrastructure continue north and south beyond the study area boundaries and, accordingly, could not be
investigated and are not included as part of the site (see Figure 3).

The main canal occupies a 200-foot wide HCWID#3 right-of-way (ROW). In and immediately adjacent
to the study area, the McAllen Main Canal is approximately 140 feet wide and rises about 10 feet above
the adjacent ground surface. It is constructed of soil and contains an unlined channel approximately
30 feet wide at its bottom to 40 feet wide at the top with an average depth of about eight feet. The tops of
the canal berms are approximately 24 feet wide and crowned with a single-lane dirt and gravel service
road (Figure 6). These measurements are approximate as the canal was full of water at the time of the
survey. Figure 7 provides a plan and cross section of the eastern half of the canal as well as the proposed
gate valve for the 54-inch pipeline connecting the canal and new reservoir. The proposed tie-in area
between the 54-inch pipeline and the McAllen Main Canal can be seen in Figure 8. In addition to the
main canal, the site encompasses five associated sub-structures/features consisting of two lateral canals
and the remains of three small inactive pump stations.
Figure 9 is a map of HCWID#3 infrastructure in the central and southern parts of the study area. The map
indicates that there are two existing lateral canals (G and G-1) in the proposed reservoir. Because the
various sub-structures historically functioned together with the main canal over the past 40 to 100 years
(depending upon the time of construction), those elements were encompassed in the overall site
description, with the McAllen Main Canal as the focal point and the ancillary pump station remains and
laterals identified as sub-areas 41HG225.1 through 41HG225.5.
41H G 225.1, L I NE D A B OV E G R OUND L A T E R A L
In the southwest corner of the proposed reservoir facility is an active, above ground lateral canal
extending east from the east side of the McAllen Main Canal (see Figure 5). The HCWID#3 designation
for this canal is Lateral G (see Figure 9). The lateral extends approximately 700 feet east then turns to the
southeast and continues about 1,000 feet to the southern boundary of the planned reservoir. The lateral
rises between two and five feet above the surrounding ground surface, is roughly three to 3.5 feet wide
and 2.5 feet deep, and is a cement and brick lined canal occupying a 65-foot wide ROW (Figures 10 and
11). It continues south and east of the project area for approximately 1.5 miles. According to the current
president of HCWD#3 (Othal Brand, Jr., personal communication), a number of lateral canals were added
to the water distribution system in the 1930s and 1940s. During that same time the new laterals and
previously constructed unlined laterals were concreted to reduce water loss from seepage. The section of
this lateral in the project area will be destroyed and removed by the planned construction.
41H G 225.2, B E L OW G R OUND L A T E R A L
This structure is identified as “Lateral G-1” by HCWID#3 (see Figure 9). The sub-feature/structure is an
inactive underground canal about which little information is known other than its general location in the
proposed reservoir, its approximate length (1,500 feet), and that it occupies a 15-foot wide HCWID#3
ROW. Based on field observations and discussions with Mr. Brand, this underground lateral is associated
with pump station sub-feature 41HG225.3 (see below). This lateral would be destroyed and removed by
the planned construction.

The three pump stations are affiliated with underground concrete irrigation and/or drainage pipelines
installed by individual land owners (not HCWID#3) during the mid- to late 1950s (in response to that
decade’s drought) and 1960s. The surface expressions of these consist of the pump station remains and
concrete standpipes. The pump station remains consist of a concrete slab approximately 8 feet by 8 feet
square with a built up concrete motor mount and assorted piping. None within the project area are in use
or have been in use in recent times. When functioning, the slab would have supported a pump and related
piping, a V-8 or similar industrial motor and a fuel supply tank, all of which was presumably covered by a
wood and corrugated metal shed.
Sub-feature 41HG225.3 is located on the west boundary of the planned reservoir and adjacent to the east
side of the McAllen Main Canal (Figure 12; see Figure 5). A “Well” is indicated on the topographic map
encompassing the project area at the location of this sub-feature/structure. Conversations with Mr. Othal
Brand, Jr. indicated that the well was most likely dug in the 1930s (Othal Brand, Jr., personal
communication). In fact, such wells throughout the area were used to fill the McAllen Main Canal during
periods of low rainfall. This pump station is inactive.

41HG225.4 is in the approximate center of the planned impoundment roughly 800 feet southeast of
41HG225.3 and 150 feet south of 41HG225.2 (Figure 13; see Figure 5). There are no adjacent standpipes
as there is with 41HG225.3. Two concrete motor mounts remain, as does the concrete slab foundation. No
wood or corrugated metal remnants are on or around the slab and mounts, but metal pipe and valve
remnants and a concrete stand pipe are visible.
41HG225.5 is situated near Bore Section #2 and the South Levee of the Main Floodway (Figure 14; see
Figure 5). Similar to 41HG225.3, this pump station is associated with a “Well” that is visible on the
topographic map encompassing the project area. This structure is not in use but the most intact of the
three pump stations discovered in the study area. The V-8 engine and support structure remains on the
motor mounts and the pipeline, pipes, and valve are in place. The approximately eight- to 12-inch
diameter cast iron pipe is extending toward the South Levee (visible in the background) and a concrete
valve box.
SUM M A R Y
Site 41HG225 is a typical example of local early to mid-twentieth century agricultural water distribution
system infrastructure in the lower Rio Grande valley that is maintained and remains in use. The early
history of the McAllen Main Canal is somewhat ambiguous, but a 1930s newspaper article found on page
82 of the Ruth Clark Scrapbook (a digitized collection of local newspaper articles pertaining to the City of

McAllen and the Lower Rio Grande Valley during the first half of the twentieth century) suggests its
origins began with the Tijon Water Company (Tijon) in 1903–1904 (Ruth Clark was secretary of the
McAllen Chamber of Commerce in the 1930s and 1940s). At that time, the company constructed a small
pumping plant to serve 600 acres in and around McAllen. The 1903–1904 date coincides with dates
provided by the current president of HCWID #3 (Othal Brand, Jr., personal communication) for
construction of the main canal.
In 1907 the Hidalgo Canal Company assumed control over the system built by Tijon and by 1914 it
served approximately 6,000 acres. At this point the company went into receivership and was taken over
and operated by R. E. Horn until 1917. In 1917 an agreement was reached between the developers of
McAllen and local farmers served by the system to have the farmers take over the irrigation and water
distribution system. Local farmers subsequently formed the Mutual Irrigation Company, which operated
the system until HCWID#3 was organized in 1921 (Clark).
Mr. Othal Brand, Jr. (personal communication) indicated that the active above ground lateral and inactive
below ground lateral within the proposed reservoir were completed in the 1930s, while the Main
Floodway and its North and South Levees were constructed during the 1940s. Mr. Brand also stated that
in the 1930s water wells, like the ones displayed on the project area topographic map at 41HG225.1 and
41HG225.3, were completed and often used to fill the McAllen Main Canal for redistribution during
periods of low water. During the 1950s and 1960s, individual pump stations were constructed for

communication).
C ONC L USI ON
The McAllen Main Canal would be directly impacted by the construction of the 54-inch intake pipeline
tie-in with the main canal. A total of approximately 2,080 square feet (0.5 acre) would be impacted by the
tie-in construction. When completed, the bulk of the intake structure and pipeline would be underground
or underwater, with only a concrete pad and gate valve exposed (see Figure 7). This arrangement is very
similar to the existing gate valve visible in Figure 6. Additionally, the entire bottom of the canal would be
cement lined. Although the main canal/54-inch pipeline tie-in would not be constructed of in kind
construction materials (e.g., the existing earthen canal would be cut to accommodate the 54-inch pipeline
and its associated foundation and gate lift while the canal bottom would be lined with cement), the
alteration of the existing canal would not impair or impede the function of the water distribution system.
The main canal was routinely dredged until recent years (grass eating carp are now stocked in the main
canal to maintain grass and weed levels), resulting in the gradual widening of the canal from its original
dimensions. The laterals continue to be dredged on a regular basis. Since the 1940s many sections of the
main canal were lined with cement or changed from a surface feature to a piped subsurface feature.
Concrete lined segments include the approximately five-mile long segment extending north/south from
near the southeast corner of the existing Boeye Reservoir into the center of McAllen. In the 1940s, the
section of the main canal traversing the North and South Levees of the Main Floodway (between BHT 16
and BHT 20) was reconfigured from an unlined surface canal to a piped subsurface facility. In the 1980s,
an approximately four-mile long section of the main canal from airport property (outside of the project
area) north to Nolana Loop was also reconfigured to a piped subsurface facility (Mr. Othal Brand, Jr.,
personal communication).
The two laterals (41H225.1 and 41HG225.2) and three inactive pump stations (41HG225.3 through
41HG225.5) within the proposed reservoir will be completely destroyed by the planned construction.
Given the relatively small area of impact at the planned 54-inch intake pipeline/main canal tie-in and the
series of facility changes during the 1930s, 1940s, and 1980s that have altered the original design (e.g.,
surface canal versus subsurface pipes) and appearance (e.g., unlined versus concrete lined and the gradual
widening of the main canal from dredging), B&A do not feel that the construction impacts proposed for
41HG225 warrant preservation and protection.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Between January 26 and February 6, 2009 archeologists from B&A completed an intensive survey for the
proposed relocation of the Boeye Reservoir on behalf of the City of McAllen, Texas. Investigations
revealed a significantly disturbed project area resulting from a century of extensive commercial
agricultural activities and associated landscape modifications (e.g., canals, levees, and floodways), as well
as urban and industrial development (e.g., McAllen-Miller International Airport). Extensive systematic
backhoe trenching throughout the study area discovered no buried prehistoric or historic archeological
deposits, just deep silty clay of the Rio Grande delta. Examinations of the ground surface throughout the
proposed construction area discovered no prehistoric archeological remains, though the survey did
document previously unrecorded historic site 41HG225 (McAllen Main Canal). In addition to the main
canal, the site encompasses five associated sub-structures/features consisting of two lateral canals
(41HG225.1 and 41HG225.2) and the remains of three small inactive pump stations (41HG225.3 through
41HG225.5).
Although the proposed construction is not affiliated with TxDOT, a July 26, 2004 coordination letter
between TxDOT and THC addressing historic irrigation systems in the Rio Grande valley is applicable.
The letter concluded that “… because these extensive irrigation canal systems established historic
development patterns in the region,…determinations of their eligibility for listing in the NRHP should be
based on an understanding of entire systems.” Thus, irrigation districts should be treated as eligible for
inclusion to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and for formal State Archeological
Landmark (SAL) designation unless “….extensive changes occurred such as those wrought by conversion
to pipelines.” Thus, although 41HG225 contains elements dating from 1903–1904 through the 1950s that
retain their historical integrity, not enough of the HCWID #3 has been evaluated at this time to make a
determination of eligibility for the entire district. From the same letter between TxDOT and THC, it was
determined that individual components of an irrigation system such as main canals, laterals, and pumps
are not individually eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.
Based on the above data, B&A recommends that 41HG225 and its sub-structures are not eligible for
inclusion to the NRHP (30 CFR 800) or for formal SAL designation (13 TAC 26.12), as they represent
contributing elements of the larger HCWID#3 (which has not been evaluated for inclusion to the NRHP
or for formal SAL designation as it was beyond the scope of this project to evaluate the entire HCWID#3)
and the proposed construction should be allowed to proceed as planned without additional archeological
investigations.
