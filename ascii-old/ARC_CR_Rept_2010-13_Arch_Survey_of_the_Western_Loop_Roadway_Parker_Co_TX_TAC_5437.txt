ABSTRACT
Parker County intends to construct approximately 5.7 miles of road that
will constitute the proposed Western Loop roadway on the western and
northern periphery of the Weatherford, in Parker County, Texas. It
consists of five distinct projects – three roadway sections and two highway
interchanges. The roadway segments include IH 20 to US 180, US 180 to
FM 920, and FM 920 to FM 51. The one grade separated interchange is to
be located at IH 20 with at grade crossings at all other cross streets. The
Western Loop will cross US 180 via a bridge with ramps coming off the
loop to US 180. AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) conducted an intensive
pedestrian archaeological survey of the 259.6 acres comprising the project
right-of-way (ROW) in November of 2009 for Freese and Nichols, Inc.,
who is managing the environmental permitting. No prehistoric
archaeological sites were found on the ground surface or in any of the 97
shovel tests excavated within the ROW. However, one historic site,
41PR123, which consisted of a cut limestone dam situated in a horseshoe
bend of Pogue Branch, was recorded during survey. Examination of the
dam and its architectural character suggest that it was built in the early to
mid-20th century, possibly by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC).
Additionally, the properties that had no secured right-of-entry (ROE) were
similar to the surveyed sections and also have a very low potential for
prehistoric and historic sites. However, 6 historic-aged structures were
located on properties 22, 79, 80 and 81 within the ROW. These structures
were evaluated by Cornerstone Heritage Preservation Services for
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) eligibility. The results of the
reconnaissance historic-aged structure survey revealed that none were
eligible of the NRHP. ARC recommends that no further archaeological
investigations are warranted and the project should proceed as planned. If
cultural resources are encountered during construction, work should
immediately cease in that area and the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission should be notified. Work should not continue until
discussions with the proper agency have been concluded.

INTRODUCTION
The proposed Western Loop is located in Parker County on the western and northern
periphery of the City of Weatherford, Texas and consists of five distinct projects – three
roadway sections and two highway interchanges. The roadway segments include IH 20 to
US 180, US 180 to FM 920, and FM 920 to FM 51 (Figure 1). The one grade separated
interchange to be located at IH 20 with at grade crossings at all other cross streets. The
Western Loop will cross US 180 via a bridge with ramps coming off the loop to US 180.
Signalized intersections will be at FM 920, FM 2421, and FM 51. The total length of the
roadway projects is 5.70 miles and will be located within a proposed 200-foot right-ofway (ROW) with additional ROW required at the interchanges and at other fill locations.
For this bond program, the Western Loop will be a two-lane rural section with turn lanes
at the intersections. The typical roadway section includes two 12 ft wide lanes with 10 ft
shoulders on both sides. Open drainage along the roadway will carry runoff to culverts at
the major channel crossings. The future rural section (4-8 years out) will include a fourlane divided section with open drainage in the median and outside the roadway. The
ultimate section (15-20 years out) will be a six-lane divided urban roadway. The
interchanges with IH 20 and US 180 will require environmental studies in accordance
with federal guidelines. The entire project will conform to standards set by Texas State
Department of Transportation (TxDOT) and the Texas Commission for Environmental
Quality (TCEQ). The proposed Western Loop crosses Town Creek and Pogue Branch
near the Union and Pacific Railroad (UPRR) crossing. Nave Engineering is performing
the hydrology and hydraulics and FEMA coordination for these two creek crossings.
Bridges are proposed to span Town Creek and the railroad. Nave Engineering will be
reviewing the Pogue Branch crossing to determine the needed bridge size versus culvert
size.
AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) conducted an intensive archaeological survey of the
roadway sections for Freese and Nichols, Inc. (FNI), which is managing the
environmental permitting of this project for Parker County. The purpose of the
archaeological survey was to determine if cultural materials were present, and, if so,
make recommendations about their significance and how they might be impacted by
construction. Cornerstone Heritage Preservation Services (CHPS) conducted a
reconnaissance survey of historic-age resources in December 2009 and January 2010 to
document structures within the proposed Western Loop, specifically those located
between Ranger Highway (SS312) and Greenwood Road (Figure 1.) During the survey,
ARC identified six historic-age structures within the ROW in Section C, between SS 312
(also known as SH 80 or Ranger Hwy) and Greenwood Road. These structures were
evaluated by CHPS for National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) eligibility.
The cultural resource investigation was required because Parker County is a political
entity of the State of Texas. Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5437 was issued for the
archaeological survey. In addition, since this roadway is in Parker County, the Fort Worth

District of the (TxDOT) also has jurisdiction, but only on the interchanges at IH-20 and
US 180. All other portions of the project are completely funded by Parker County.
Relevant federal legislation includes the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as
amended (PL-96-515), the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), the
Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291), the
Clean Water Act, as amended PL92500 and the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. The
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission (THC) will review this report.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Parker County is located in North Central Texas. The county consists mainly of
undulating to hilly land with vegetation that includes tall grasses and various species of
trees such as mesquite, elm, oak, pecan and walnut. The sandy loams in the Western
Cross Timbers portion of the county, in which the study area lies, drain into two different
river basins. The northern half of the proposed route drains southeast into the Clear Fork
of the Trinity River and southern half below US 180 drains into the Brazos River
(Dyksterhuis 1948:Figure 1).
Weatherford is located on a level ridge that is at an elevation above 1100’ msl and is
located east of the study area. The bedrock underlying Weatherford and the study area
consists of the Lower Cretaceous-aged Paluxy Formation and the Walnut Clay
Formation. The Paluxy consists mainly of sandstone, but limestone and mudstone beds
are present (Bureau of Economic Geology 1972). The Walnut Clay consists of clay and
limestone bedrock. These formations contain no knappable chert resources but it is
possible that Uvalde Gravels have deflated onto the upslope ridge and could have draped
down the slope to the study area.
Soils in the study area belong to the Windhorst-Duffau-Weatherford association
according to the Soil Conservation Service (Greenwade et al. 1977:General Soils Map).
These soils are gently sloping to sloping, deep, loamy or sandy and over overlay weakly
cemented sandstone or clay. Specific soils within the study area range from Brackett and
Maloterre soils with 3 to 12 percent slopes to Windthorst fine sandy loam with 1 to 8
percent slopes and Venus clay loam with 1 to 3 percent slopes (Greenwade et al.
1977:Sheets 29, 30, 36, 37 and 42). All soil types encountered along the route are shown
on Figure 2. The expected deepest depth to the B horizon is 50 inches (127 centimeters)
below the ground surface (cmbs) (Greenwade et al. 1977:38).
Gunnar Brune (1981:352-353) lists several springs in the Weatherford area, but none are
located within the study area. The northern half of the route crosses two tributaries, a
first-order intermittent stream named Pogue Branch and a second-order tributary named
Town Creek that is mapped as perennial on the USGS map but as intermittent on the Soil
Survey Map for Parker County, Texas (Greenwade et al. 1977:Sheet 37). The southern
portion of the route crosses two unnamed intermittent first-order tributaries of Sanchez
Creek. Based on the intermittent drainages and the absence of springs upslope, it is
unlikely that springs were ever active in the study area
The study area is at the eastern edge of the Western Cross Timbers, which is mapped by
Dykersthuis (1948:Figure 1) as being adjacent to savannahs and the western edge of the
Fort Worth Prairie. Oak trees are the most common trees in the study area and hardwood
forest containing pecan, walnut, and oaks is present along Town Creek. Animals hunted
by inhabitants consisted of deer, squirrel and turkey, which fed on the mast from these
trees. Other prey consisted of raccoon, turtle, mussels, fish and a variety of birds such as

duck that lived in or adjacent to perennial streams. Nearby prairies would have supported
quail, rabbits, bison and antelope.

CULTURAL HISTORY
Culture History
Prehistoric occupation within North Central Texas dates before 8500 BP, and is identified
in the archaeological record by distinctive spear points such as Clovis, Dalton and
Plainview. These types of artifacts have been recovered from deeply buried floodplain
deposits within the Trinity River watershed in North Central Texas (Crook and Harris
1957; Ferring 2001).
The Early Archaic period 8500-6000 BP coincides with the onset of a drying period in
North Central Texas that marks the termination of the Pleistocene period, and isolated
Early Archaic components have been reported in the area. The Middle Archaic period
6000-3500 BP saw environmental stabilization that is reflected in current climate
conditions of the oak-savannah and grasslands that are present as the Cross Timbers.
The population in North Central Texas as shown by site numbers saw a significant
increase during the Late Archaic 3500-1250 BP. A wetter environment contributed to
growth in the Cross Timbers woodlands, and sites from this period are typically found on
perennial tributaries with a small density along major drainages. During the Late Archaic,
there was a significant increase in the use of quartzite for the manufacture of projectile
points, which indicates an increase in the use of localized natural resources (Prikryl
1990:76).
Sedentary life ways increased during the Late Prehistoric I period from 1250-750 BP.
The appearance of ceramics, the bow and arrow and houses in the archaeological record
coincided with a drier climate shift. Site density decreased overall and along tributaries
during this period. The percentage of quartzite tools decreases from the Late Archaic, and
diagnostics from this period include expanded stem arrow points such as Scallorn and
Alba (Prikryl 1990:79-83). By the Late Prehistoric II 750-250 BP, there is an increase in
buffalo bones in site deposits and a shift in the tool kit with the appearance of Harrell,
Fresno and Washita arrow points, along with scrapers and flake drills.
Very little archaeological evidence of historic Native American occupation has been
found in North-Central Texas. This is a pattern seen throughout much of Texas and is
possibly due to the Native Americans migrating out of the area because they were unable
to adapt to the changing climate (Skinner 1988:103). Yet archival documents and historic
accounts in North Central Texas demonstrate that some Native Americans were still
present in the area into the middle 19th century.
Beginning in the 1830s and continuing into the 1840s the aboriginal inhabitants of North
Central Texas continued to play an infamous if not important role in the history of the
region. Garrett, a well-respected Fort Worth historian, has stated that "Indian hostilities
almost depopulated North Texas [of Anglo settlers] after 1839. It dwindled to less than

half" (Garrett 1972:24). According to tradition at least, many Indians of several tribes
roamed Tarrant County until the 1860s.
Accounts of the Battle of Village Creek provide give the impression of a high Native
American population. On May 24, 1841, a scout for General Edward Tarrant spotted
fresh tracks and an Indian village, whereupon General Tarrant, Captain John Denton, and
Captain Bourland, seeking reprisal for earlier raids, led a charge. The surprise was
complete in the first village, but chasing down fleeing Indians led to a second and third
village with still another in the distance. Denton himself was killed during the fighting.
Coming from a different background of dealing with Indians, President of the Republic of
Texas, Sam Houston, realized rapprochement was a preferred tactic. In the summer of
1843, a council with the Indians was called, and in September of that year ten tribes
signed a treaty which was approved by the Senate the following January. The treaty
provided the needed impetus for settlement of several counties in the North Central Texas
area.
Parker County, in which the survey area lies, was controlled by Kiowas and Comanches
in the late 1840s when the first European settlers arrived. The Texas state legislature
formed Parker County from portions of Bosque and Navarro counties in 1855. By 1860,
the economy was based on raising cattle and sheep and growing corn, wheat, rye,
potatoes and sweet potatoes. In 1870, hogs began to be raised in the county. During the
first part of the twentieth century, the cultivation of cotton was added to the growing
economic base. By the 1950s however, raising peanuts and hay became major
components of the county’s economy, and by the 1950s, Parker County was one of the
state’s leading producers of non-citrus fruit as well as vegetables and livestock. The
construction of Interstate Highway 20 through Parker County allowed people to live in
Parker County and work in Fort Worth; therefore, the county’s population increased. The
discovery of oil and gas in 1966 also added to the county’s growth spurt. By 1965, major
economic pursuits consisted of the dairy industry, goat and sheep ranching and poultry
production. Today, light industries are found in the county and the population is
increasing steadily (Echeverria 2009).
Historic Context of Survey Area
The historic-age resources within Section C are in an area of Parker County known
historically as the Greenwood Community. The area was formed in the 1880s on land
bought by T.D. Wythe and W.J. Fain primarily for farming. Located approximately four
miles west of the county seat of Weatherford, residents named the settlement after a live
oak tree near the one-room schoolhouse (Minor 2009).

Article from the Weatherford Democrat of the Greenwood School students
and teachers, 1924.

Parker County was formed in 1855. Many of the early settlers came from the upper
south-Tennessee, Missouri, Kentucky and some from Georgia. David Harry moved to
Texas from Jackson County, Missouri and received a land grant of 640 acres in the
Greenwood Community area on February 12, 1873. Harry sold the land grant to T.D.
Wythe and W.J. Fain, subsequently long time residents of Greenwood. Fain and other
residents of Greenwood, donated land for a school for the Greenwood children. Built in
1883, the one-room schoolhouse and was soon expanded into a two-room building. It was
torn down in 1917 to make way for a new building that included lighting, two
cloakrooms, a water fountain and a large front porch that was used for an outdoor stage.
In 1937, the school began serving hot lunches often provided by ladies of the community.
Each student was responsible for his or her own table service. The school was closed in
1962 when the area was incorporated into the Weatherford ISD. The building was sold to
the Greenwood Baptist Church for use as an educational building and was eventually torn
down (Mainard 2007; Weatherford Public Library Vertical Files 2010).

surviving institution from the early years of the Greenwood Community is the Methodist
Church built in 1906 and located across from the cemetery. The United Methodist Church
Conference sold the church to a few members in 1967 and they renamed it Greenwood
Memorial Chapel. In 2001, the building was restored and is now available for weddings,
meetings and other events (Mainard 2007). A Recorded Texas Historic Landmark
(RTHL) marker for Greenwood Community is located at the site.

Agriculture was the main occupation of the residents of Greenwood Community. In
particular, watermelon was the area’s most noted crop with Weatherford claiming to be
the watermelon capital of Texas. A news report in the Dallas Morning News, September
7, 1943, announced that the largest Tom Watson watermelon ever grown in Parker
County weighed 107 pounds and was grown by Dale Roark. It sold for $15.00 and was
shipped to New Jersey.
Today the Greenwood Community retains many aspects of rural country life with several
horse and cattle ranches. The area is part of the City of Weatherford ETJ and last year an
attempt to incorporate the area within the City of Weatherford boundaries failed.
Previous Investigations
According to the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (2009), no sites are recorded along or
near the proposed Western Loop route. In order to conduct the archaeological survey, the
surveyors first reviewed the information about the study area found in the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas. In addition, the 1936 General Highway map of Parker County
published by the Texas State Highway Department and 1959 USGS topographic maps for
the study area were examined for historic structures mapped in the study area. Both maps
showed several structures along and within the proposed ROW. The major archaeological
survey conducted in Parker County was of the Texas Army National Guard’s Fort

Wolters Facility (Brownlow et al. 1999; Brownlow 2001) and at Lake Mineral Wells
State Park. During the survey, archaeological sites ranging from the Late Archaic to the
Late Prehistoric as well historic sites, many related to the construction of Fort Wolters,
were recorded. Testing at four sites revealed buried deposits containing stone-lined hearth
features, dateable charcoal, and faunal remains from the Late Archaic and Late
Prehistoric periods. More recent investigations by Johnny Byers (2007) for his thesis at
the Carr site (41PR26) uncovered a prehistoric occupation that lasted from the
Paleoindian to Late Archaic periods. In addition, a mammoth was recovered but was not
associated with the site.
Very few archaeological surveys have been conducted in the general area south of
Weatherford. Skinner (1999) conducted an archaeological survey of several proposed
pipeline routes for the Parker County Water Supply Corporation southwest of the study
area. The pipeline routes ranged from north of IH-20 south almost to the Brazos River.
Drainages crossed include Sanchez Creek, Little Grindstone Creek and Grindstone Creek.
No archaeological sites were found. ARC surveyed on 55 acres for the Weatherford
Landfill expansion (Todd 2004), one mile south of the western terminus of the Western
Loop route and uncovered no cultural materials. Additionally, ARC (Todd 2005)
conducted a pipeline survey that crossed tributaries of East Sanchez Creek and Sanchez
Creek but no cultural materials were recorded.
Geo-Marine, Inc. (Tiné 2006) investigated the reroute of a section of FM 2552
approximately a mile northwest of the study area. No archaeological sites were
discovered. Todd (2008) conducted an archaeological survey of approximately 4,200 feet
of pipeline route along Three Mile Branch about 1.5 miles southeast of the study area. No
archaeological sites were found on the ground surface or uncovered in 11 shovel tests.
Additionally, ARC (Todd 2009) conducted a survey of a pipeline that crossed Town
Creek and one of its tributaries, yet uncovered no archaeological sites.
In addition to cultural resource management work performed in Parker County, much has
been learned about the area from the studies by numerous avocational archaeologists such
as Homer Norris. In a 2006 publication, Norris related the discovery of a ceremonial
burial of a presumably albino, and therefore sacred, buffalo, in a residential backyard in
Parker County. Additionally, Norris presents a portion of a newspaper article, sketches
and descriptions of the recording of site 41PR12 (Norris 2006:5-6). The site consisted of
the prehistoric flexed burial of an adult woman located on a loamy terrace south of
Burgess Creek near the town of Annetta. A ring of fossilized Lower Cretaceous-aged
Texigryphia shells framed the grave, and the body was painted with red ochre. No
additional grave goods were recovered.

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY
Archaeological Research Design
The records review indicated no recorded prehistoric or historic archaeological sites in
the survey area. Yet based on the known prehistoric and historic archaeology of the area,
we proposed the following two research questions to address the archaeological potential
of the area.
The first research question concerns the prehistoric occupation of the study area. It was
predicted that the upland prairie portions of the route had little likelihood of having been
occupied prehistorically because rainwater runs off the cross timbers rapidly and would
not allow for permanent occupation. Secondly, the Western Cross Timbers is biotically
diverse, which could have provided perennial food resources. Prehistoric sites could be
found on terraces above drainages, but would be limited to temporary campsites. Uvalde
gravel fields have been recorded on upland divides in Parker County (Trask 2006),
therefore if present within the study area these locations may have been utilized as lithic
procurement sites.
The second question concerns the historic occupation of the study area. It was predicted
that historic sites were likely to be located along roads that the Western Loop route
crosses or parallels. Many structures shown the 1959 and 1979 Weatherford North and
Weatherford South, TX USGS maps as well as modern aerial photographs appear to be in
the ROW. Some of these structures will be removed for the project, but the route will
avoid many. However, it was expected that evidence of historic occupation might be
limited to trash scatters near drainages, isolated artifacts, or collapsed field structures.
Methodology for Archaeology
The field team walked four parallel transects spaced 30 meters apart and made notes
about the ground exposure, surface artifacts, soil types and disturbed areas where subsoil
was exposed. Photographs were taken along the route using a Canon PowerShot SD600
6.0 mega pixel digital camera. Shovel tests were excavated on an average of every 100
meters per transect following the Texas Historical Commission survey standards (n.d.).
Shovel tests were excavated to the bottom of the Holocene deposit and averaged 30 cm in
diameter, and were supplemented by an auger to explore deeper. The clay fill from the
shovel tests was inspected visually and broken into smaller chunks in order to determine
if cultural materials were present. Sandy soils from the shovel tests were screened
through ¼” hardware cloth. Shovel test matrices were described on the basis of texture
and color. The Munsell Soil Color Chart was used to identify the specific soil colors in
each test. The shovel test locations were determined with a handheld Garmin GPSmap76
receiver.

HISTORIC-AGE STRUCTURES SURVEY GOALS AND
METHODOLOGY
Goals
In December 2009, CHPS was contacted by ARC and FNI to provide a reconnaissance
level survey of historic-age resources associated with the Parker County, Texas proposed
Western Loop. The purpose of the study was to satisfy compliance requirements under
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA), as amended; and
the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.
This results herein are intended to provide a reconnaissance level historic-age resources
survey of the study area defined as Section C, located between SS 312 (Ranger Highway
and SH 80) and Greenwood Road. Previous surveys of Parker County include one
conducted by students from UTA in the mid-1980s. The boundaries for this survey are
primarily within the city limits of Weatherford, Texas. The most recent study of historicage resources within the study area was for a RTHL marker for the Greenwood
Community and the Greenwood Community Cemetery in 2007.
In December 2009 and January 2010, CHPS team surveyed the study area. The findings
detailed in the following chapter are intended to provide a basis of identifying historicage resources in the project area, derive preliminary indications of the age, extent, and
level of integrity of any identified resources, and where possible evaluate significance in
terms of NRHP eligibility in accordance with 36 CFR 60. This was achieved through: (1)
evaluating all resources built prior to 1965 and identifying them, (2) assess the potential
of historic-age resources for NRHP eligibility, and (3) consider indirect impacts to
historic-age resources adjacent to the area of potential effect (APE) including potential
historic districts.
Methodology
The reconnaissance level survey of historic-age resources along within Section C was
conducted by an architectural historian meeting the Secretary of the Interior’s
qualifications. The survey fieldwork was conducted during the weeks of December 2131, 2009 and January 25-30, 2010. All historic-age resources (including any buildings,
structures, or objects constructed before 1965) were inventoried, photographed, and
evaluated. Field forms for resources recorded during the investigation can be found in
Appendix C of this report.
The APE of Section C within the ROW included nine structures identified by ARC and
four structures that are outside the ROW. Of these, six were selected for intensive
research and documentation to assess eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP. Following the
field investigation, information was obtained from a variety of sources and repositories
including historical maps, deed records, tax appraisal records, vertical files at the
Weatherford Public Library, Dallas Morning News archive, and publications relating to
the history of Parker County.

RESULTS
This chapter is separated into three portions with the description of the study area
followed by the survey results. The route will be described according to three roadway
sections of the project (Figure 8). The two grade highway intersections at IH 20 and US
180 have been lumped into their respective sides. Shovel tests are described briefly in the
text and are detailed in Appendix A. The third portion of this chapter discusses structures
that were over 50 years old and were encountered during the survey. More detailed
descriptions and photos are in Appendix B and C. Conclusions end the chapter.

Survey Area
Section A
The first part of the study area route (Section A) runs west from FM 51 to FM 920, and is
approximately 1.2 miles long (Figure 9). This portion of the line was narrowed to the 200
foot wide ROW, since it had been largely finalized as the route. Small sections of the
route were surveyed at 400 feet, to provide room to readjust the line if necessary. The
first portion of the route west of FM 51 runs approximately 115 meters through Property
73 (P73), a vacant lot amid residential properties. Knee- to waist-high prairie grasses and
weeds dominate the area, and a thick line of oaks mark the property line. Proceeding west
into P72, no rights-of-entry (ROE) were granted so the section was only visually
examined. The next portion of the route ran through P68-71. The portion in P68 from FM
2421 contained 125 meters of undulating, improved pasture that has been heavily
terraced, and then through 450 meters of heavily wooded, undulating upland. Vegetation
included knee-high prairie grasses, green briar, live oaks, elms, cedar elms and some
pecans. Moving east through P69 and P71, this area became densely wooded and the
landscape took on a more pronounced upland setting, characterized by numerous cedars
and more dramatically undulating topography. The final 400-meter stretch of Section A
was situated between FM 2421 and FM 920, and has been more developed. No survey
was conducted in P65, but P64 and P63 were dominated by improved pasture with kneehigh prairie grasses. The final 100 meters through P58, 59 and 62, have been developed
into a parking lot, residential plots and the site of an abandoned filling station (P58),
which sits on the east side of FM 920. Ground visibility in Section A was universally
poor, generally ranging between 0 and 20 percent.

Section B
The second part of the study area route (Section B) runs in a generally southwest
direction, and is situated between FM 920 and US 180 and is approximately 2.1 miles
long (Figure 10). Starting in P57, the first approximate 120 meters was unimproved
pasture dominated by waist-high prairie grasses and weeds, and sparsely distributed
pecan and oak, then the route moves into a densely wooded area that constitutes the
floodplain of the northern fork of the Pogue Branch of Town Creek. Vegetation in the
ROW included pecan, occasional live oak, cedar elm, honey locust, bois d’arc and green
briar. The terrain of the area was marked by a gentle western slope toward the drainage,
and exhibited gentle undulations consistent with flooding erosion. Two tributaries of
Pogue Branch were encountered in this wooded area. The first has an approximately 10
meters wide and 4 meters deep channel, with no running water at the time of survey. The
second tributary channel possessed drastically alternating dimensions, with width ranging
between 5 and 15 meters, and depth that ranged from 3 to 5 meters. Running water was
present in the channel at the time of survey due to recent rain, with depths that ranged
from 25 to 50 cm. Immediately beyond the second Pogue Branch tributary, the route
moves into P55 and P56 through a steep slope rising away from the drainage. Atop this
slope, the wooded area abruptly opened to reveal a level 350-meter expanse of improved
pasture. The pasture was dominated by ankle- to knee-high prairie grasses, and was
roughly bisected by the UPRR line.
South of the UPRR line into P54, more improved pasture was encountered. Past this, the
route again crosses a densely wooded area that marked the floodplain of Town Creek.
The channel was far larger than that of the Pogue Branch, approximately 15 meters wide
and 5 meters deep. Between 0.5 and 1.5 meters of water was flowing in the channel.
Bedrock was exposed at an approximate depth of 2 meters below the surface.
Immediately beyond the drainage, the trees again cleared, revealing a broad expanse of
rolling unimproved pasture that the route crossed for roughly 300 meters. This stretch of
unimproved pasture was dominated by knee- to waist-high prairie grasses and weeds,
though isolated stands of cedar, cedar elm, oak and mesquite are present. Ground
visibility in this section of the route was poor, between 10 and 20 percent. The route then
crosses into P53 and no ROE were secured so the section was only visually inspected
from P51. The terrain and vegetation are consistent with the terrain in PO51. The west
side of P53, the next 200 meters of the pastureland was marked by signs of heavy
erosion, particularly arroyos and gullies, indicative of intermittent flooding in the area.
West of the unimproved pasture, the route in P51 moves through approximately 300
meters of sparsely wooded, rising upland towards Garner Road. Ground visibility is
excellent in this area, between 60 and 80 percent, with eroding limestone bedrock gravels
on the surface. On the southwest side of Garner Road, the route passes through P43 to
P59, most of which contained occupied homes and manicured lawns and sparsely
wooded areas in an undulating upland setting. A distinct southern slope from these
uplands characterizes the remainder of Section B. P46, P47 and P50 were not surveyed as
no ROEs were secured. Additional residential development was present to a certain
degree for the remainder of Section B. Several homes situated on large plots are present

to the north of Old Mineral Wells Highway, though the area contained moderately
wooded areas. The final 170 meters of Section B, situated in P36, between Old Mineral
Wells Highway and US 180 was dominated by gently southern sloping improved pasture.
Livestock was present at the time of survey. Additionally, the US 180 ROW will be
widened on both sides, and these properties contain numerous structures, which are
discussed more thorough in the survey results and in Appendix B.

Section C
The third section of the study area route (Section C) runs generally south between US
180 and IH 20 and is approximately 2.5 miles long (Figure 11). Immediately south of US
180, the ROW runs approximately 440 meters through generally level to rolling stretches
of improved pasture utilized as grazing land in P27, which continued to Greenwood
Road. Livestock was present in the ROW at the time of survey in all properties. Anklehigh prairie grasses dominated the landscape with occasional cedar present particularly
along property lines, and along an unnamed, intermittent tributary of Sanchez Creek, that
crosses the ROW approximately 85 meters north of Greenwood Road. The tributary
channel was approximately 1 to 2 meters wide and 50 cm deep, and contained water at
the time of the survey. From Greenwood Road south to Ranger Hwy (also known as SH
80 and SS 312), the properties contained gently rolling terrain, but were less well
maintained. Survey was not conducted on properties 19 through 22, since ROEs were not
secured at the time. The ROW ran through predominantly residential areas immediately
south of the road, the route contained numerous oak, cedar elm and pecan. South of the
residential property, was a heavily disturbed portion of land that contained a large pipe
manufacturer, which consisted of a large warehouse and numerous outbuildings, and was
generally paved. The manufacturer abutted the north side of Ranger Hwy. Numerous
structures were situated on the north and south sides of Ranger Hwy.
South of Ranger Hwy, the ROW runs through a residential area similar to that to the
north and then crossed a property fence into a rolling expanse of improved pasture.
Ground cover consisted of ankle- to knee-high prairie grasses. Ground visibility was
approximately 0 to 20 percent, and remained so for the remainder of Section C. To the
south of the initial improved pasture, the ROW entered a heavily disturbed area that was
crossed by numerous pipeline corridors, and had been cut and filled to build a large,
berm-rimmed stock pond, which was wreathed by oak, elm and pecan. The route then
moved south into a further disturbed area that has been extensively terraced (P10), and
this exaggerated the area’s already rolling, gently southward sloping terrain.
South of this terraced pasture, the terrain began a steady rise to a more pronounced
upland setting that culminated in a densely wooded upland area approximately 265
meters north of IH 20. As the terrain climbed, the tree cover density increased, with
numerous cedar elms, cedar, oak and pecan present in the ROW. Situated atop a hill in
the uplands was an alpaca farm on P5 and P6. South of this apex, the route then followed
a steep southward slope toward the highway. This sloping area’s vegetation consisted
almost entirely of waist-high prairie grasses and weeds. South of IH 20, the terrain
became more dramatically undulating, and numerous mesquite, oak, cedar elm and pecan
trees were present.

relation to the ROW. Structures younger than 50 years of age are addressed briefly in this
section and structures over 50 years are addressed in the following portion of this chapter.
Section A
Survey began in the small, cleared lot situated on P73 on the southwest side of the
intersection of Hawkins Lily Rd. and FM 51. The terrain featured an even and perceptible
rise to the west, which was reflected in the soil profile of the shovel tests excavated in
this area. Shovel test 001, excavated 50 meters southwest of the intersection revealed a
soil profile that featured very dark grayish brown loam which transitioned into dark
yellowish brown loams to a depth of 155 cmbs, at which depth brown sandy clay subsoil
was encountered (Figure 12). Shovel test BI1, excavated further up the rise, revealed a far
shallower profile, which featured only 13 cm of sandy loam topsoil overlaying loamy
clay subsoil with gravels.
Starting at FM 2421 (Zion Hill Road), the survey proceeded west to east. Two shovel
tests (002 and BI2) were excavated in the undulating, improved terraced pasture adjacent
to the roadway, revealing a similar, yet shallower soil profile than that encountered in
P73. Brownish yellow clay subsoil was encountered at 90 cmbs. An occupied home and
outbuildings were encountered on the edge of the ROW and were photographed. The
structures were determined to be less than 50 years old, since they were not mapped on
either the 1959 or the 1979 USGS topographic maps. Thus, they are not eligible to be
recorded as a site or for the NRHP.

Survey then continued east through a less maintained, wooded upland area for 250
meters. Shovel tests 003 through 004 and BI3 through BI5 revealed a shallow soil profile,
with eroded bedrock encountered between 30 and 45 cmbs. Approximately 300 meters
east of FM 2421, seven circular depressions were noted in the ROW (Figure 13). All of
these depressions were roughly 1 meter in diameter and 40 cm deep, and were caused by
the harvesting trees, probably bois d’arcs as one had been recently removed and was
lying near a depression with wire bound roots.

Figure 13.

One of the several depressions created by harvesting of trees.

As mentioned previously, ROE had not been secured for P65, so no survey was
conducted on this property. Aerial photography shows that several structures were within
the ROW of the route, yet none of these appeared on the 1959 or the 1979 USGS maps.
The survey continued from FM 920, east towards P65. On the north side of FM 920 the
route crosses through properties containing structures and was largely an asphalt parking
lot. On P58, there were three structures, an abandoned filling station and two residential
mobile homes, none of which were shown on any historic maps. The majority of P59 and
P62 was covered in a gravel parking lot and contained numerous cars and other stored
items belonging to the storage unit facilities next to the ROW. Shovel testing resumed on
P59 on the north side of the gravel parking lot in a cleared stretch of improved pasture
rising to the north. Shovel tests 005 and 006 were excavated in this area, the first
revealing brown sandy loam topsoil overlaying very dark grayish brown loamy clay
subsoil at 40 cmbs, and the second revealing the same subsoil at the surface. No cultural
resources were recovered or observed in the Section A shovel tests. Additionally, no
cultural material was observed on the ground surface during the pedestrian survey.
Likewise, no historic structures were encountered within the ROW.
Section B
Survey south of FM 920 began with the excavation of shovel tests 007 and BI6 in an area
of semi-improved pasture that preceded a densely wooded area to the south that led to a
small tributary of Pogue Branch (Figure 14). The shovel tests revealed a soil profile,
consisting of alternating strata of yellowish red and reddish brown sandy clays to a depth
of 100 cmbs. Within the wooded area, 12 shovel tests (008 through 012 and BI7 through
______________________________________________________________________________________

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF THE WESTERN LOOP ROADWAY

23

BI13) were excavated along the meandering, eroded banks of Pogue Branch and its small
northern tributary. These shovel tests revealed widely disparate soil profiles with topsoils
of numerous shades from black to grayish brown and yellowish red to reddish sandy
loams and depths ranging from roughly 15 to 150 cmbs. Subsoils fluctuated between very
compact sand, sandy clay and clay, and some contained eroding bedrock. On the northern
tributary of Pogue Branch, a pile of concrete debris was observed. The concrete was
modern fine grain and of no recognizable structure (Figure 15).

Figure 14.

Shovel test locations and structures in Section B, near or within in the
ROW shown on a portion of the 1959 Weatherford North, TX 7.5’ USGS
topographic map.

A limestone dam was recorded as the only archaeological site (41PR123) of the project
on the main tributary of Pogue Branch on P56 (Figure 16). This dam was constructed
using cut limestone and situated within a horseshoe bend of the creek at a relatively wide
portion of the channel (Figure 17). The dam was 44’ long by 2’8” wide and averaged 6’
in height. The cut limestone blocks averaged in size 16” wide by 5” inches thick and 20”
wide. The cut stones were mortared together and coarse aggregate concrete was used to
cover the surface, at present approximately one third to one half of the exterior façade
had eroded away. The dam is similar in style and construction methods to Civilian
Conservation Corps (CCC) dams built elsewhere in Texas. For example, the CCC dam
recorded in Brownwood, by ARC (Skinner and Skinner 1997). The dam is constructed
out of partially shaped limestone and sandstone blocks and held together with concrete.

The CCC was in Parker County in the mid to late 1930s working on agricultural and rural
projects, including land terracing and construction of dams (Echeverria 2009). The
limestone dam probably dates to the early to mid 20th century and could possibly be a
CCC structure. The dam will be avoided by this project. Adjacent to the dam, exposed
limestone was visible in the channel’s banks approximately 2 meters below the ground
surface demonstrating the shallow nature of the soils in this floodplain (Figure 18).
Additionally, by avoiding the dam, the route will be pushed back farther from the only
structure near the locations of the proposed bridges for this project. On P56, one
industrial building is situated near the south edge of the property near the railroad tracks.
This building belongs to the American Nutrition Company and is a modern industrial
building with sheet metal siding that does not appear on the 1959 USGS map (Figures 10
and 16).

After documenting the limestone dam, the survey continued to the southwest out of the
Pogue Branch treeline, and moved into level improved pasture bisected first by an access
road for a factory just east of the ROW, and then the UPRR line. Five shovel tests
(013,014, BI14 and BI15) were excavated in this stretch of improved pasture. The shovel
tests were excavated immediately south of the railroad tracks and then on the north bank
of the Town Creek, and revealed considerably differing soil profiles. South of the
drainage however, shovel tests 015 and BI116 revealed black clay and loamy clay at the
surface to depths of 86 to 95 cmbs, below which lay similarly colored clay subsoil with
eroding bedrock.
South of Town Creek, the ROW continues through a moderately wooded and slightly
more undulating area of unimproved pasture for approximately 250 meters. Shovel tests
in this area (016, 017, BI17 and BI18) initially revealed a continuation of the soil profile
immediately south of the drainage, but soon encountered a more stratified soil profile that
began with approximately 40 cm of loamy sand, and then graded to brighter and more
compact sandy clay subsoil, encountered at generally at a depth of 110 cmbs.
Approximately 300 meters southwest of the drainage, surveyors encountered P53 for
which access had not been granted, and had to walk around to continue survey on the
west side of the property line. To the west of this property, the ROW entered disturbed,
undulating and wooded areas that showed signs of extensive terracing. Shovel testing in
this area (shovel tests 018, 019, BI20 and BI21) revealed varying soil profiles that
generally featured sandy loam topsoil, which became increasingly brighter and contained
more clay with depth, eventually grading into sandy clay subsoil. Heading west, the
ROW crosses rising uplands, which are marked by erosional gullies and arroyos,
indicative of episodic flooding. Reflecting this, the soil profile became increasingly
shallow. In shovel test 022, bedrock was encountered at 40 cmbs, and farther west,
eroding bedrock gravels were observed on the ground surface.
West of Garner Road, access was not secured for three properties (P46, P47 and P50)
within the ROW. However, field observations were made and the properties were
photographed as best as possible (Figures 19, 20, 21 and 22). The properties generally
consisted of maintained residential tracts, untended wooded areas, or improved pastures.
Livestock was present within some of the properties. Four shovel tests were placed on
P48 and P49. Shovel tests BI24-BI27 revealed very dark grayish brown sand over
degrading bedrock between 10 and 20 cmbs. Numerous structures were observed, though
few appear to have been built more than 50 years ago. The small strip of land between
P46 and P47 had ground visibility between 50 and 80 percent with some exposures of
bedrock. A structure was mapped on the 1959 USGS map in the ROW, however the
structure was no longer there. The 1959 USGS map also shows a structure on the
northeast corner of P46, however a large fence and dense vegetation prevented crews
from visually confirming that the structure there was 50 yrs old. This will be discussed
more in the following section on structures and in Appendix B.

The survey continued moving north from Old Mineral Wells Highway on properties P43,
P44 and P45, all of which contained structures. Only two of which were mapped on the
1959 USGS maps and they are west of the ROW on P45. One was a collapsed residence
and the other was a barn (Figure 23). The occupied homes that are within in the ROW do
not appear on the 1959 or the 1979 USGS maps.

Figure 23.

Collapsed structure north of Old Mineral Wells Hwy. View is to the west.

The terrain rose considerably to the north, and shovel tests revealed an increasingly
shallow soil profile. Shovel test 023, excavated just north of the highway, contained
sandy clay loam to a depth of 100 cm, at which depth sandy clay subsoil was
encountered. 150 meters north of shovel test 023, shovel test 024 encountered mottled
clay and bedrock at 50 cmbs. North of shovel test 024, the elevation within the ROW
continued to rise, with bedrock visible on the surface. In this area, building materials
have been gathered and dumped consisting of tile and rock, though it is unclear if these
were taken from a structure that had been demolished in the area, or are simply being
stored there (Figure 24).

The survey continued south to the properties between Old Mineral Wells Highway and
US 180. Two shovel tests (025 and BI30) were excavated in the southward sloping
improved pasture south of Old Mineral Wells Highway. These shovel tests revealed a soil
profile that darkened and deepened with the slope of the landscape. Shovel test 025
encountered increasingly brighter sandy clay overlaying pale brown compact clay subsoil
at 60 cmbs. Shovel test BI30, excavated further down the slope, encountered brown
sandy clay that lightened with depth overlaying dark yellowish brown clay at 75 cmbs.
No cultural materials were observed in any of the 41 shovel tests excavated in Section B.
Likewise, no artifacts were observed on the ground surface. The structures encountered
along US 180 are discussed in the section on structures.
Section C
Survey south of US 180 began with shovel testing in an agricultural plot owned by
Weatherford College (P27) (Figure 25). The property is utilized primarily as grazing
land, and livestock was present at the time of survey. Shovel tests 026, 027, BI31 and
BI32 were excavated on the property, revealing a soil profile that consists of various
shades of clays and sandy clays overlaying clays with eroded bedrock at depths between
90 and 140cmbs.
The ROW then moved south of P27 onto private properties P23-26, which consist mostly
of improved pasture, and terminates at Greenwood Road. Ten shovel tests (BI47-56)
were excavated in this area, revealing a mixture of soils in the profile consistent with
agricultural terracing similar to that seen in the northern half of the property. Farther
south, the shovel tests revealed a more uniform soil profile, featuring brown to dark
grayish brown loamy clay and sandy clay topsoil overlaying sandy clay subsoil with
degrading bedrock encountered between 75 and 100 cmbs. Along the southern border of
P24, within a wooded area that surrounds a manmade lake, a corrugated steel barn was
observed. The barn was a recent addition to the property. A final shovel test, BI56, was
excavated immediately to the north of Greenwood Road, which revealed black loamy
clay topsoil to a depth of 73 cm, which overlay very dark grayish brown loamy clay,
which became too compact for excavation below 85 cm.
Access had not been secured for the properties south of Greenwood Road (P19-22), so
the area was not surveyed. However, a historic structure was observed just inside the
fence line on P22. The house was mapped on the 1959 USGS map.
The properties immediately to the north of Ranger Hwy, (P18, P80 and P81) had
developed into residences and a small business. P18 contained a home, a pipe factory and
multiple outbuildings. No shovel tests were excavated on the property due to ground
visibility between 40 and 80 percent in addition to the disturbances caused by the parking
lots and machinery. However, the area was photographed. P80 and P81, as well as the
properties on the south side of Ranger Hwy all contained homes mapped on the 1959
USGS map in the ROW. These are discussed in the following section.

South, TX 7.5’ USGS topographic map

South of the residential property, the ROW ran roughly alongside a small dirt road, and
ran through an undulating area of improved pasture in P13 and P12. Shovel testing in this
area revealed heavily disturbed soil profiles resulting from the presence of numerous
pipeline corridors running south through the properties, and substantial cut and fill
activities that were employed to construct a large, berm-lined stock pond on P12. South
of the property line, the ROW entered a rolling expanse of semi-improved pasture
marked by extensive agricultural terracing on P11 and P12 (Figure 26). Shovel tests (03133 and BI35-38) revealed a markedly disturbed soil profile in the northern half of the
property.

Extensively terraced area of improved pasture in P10. View is to the south.

The remainder of the ROW north of IH 20 ran through a dramatically undulating upland
setting, dominated by increasingly less maintained pasture as the route moves south. The
soil profiles encountered in the 14 shovel tests (034 through 040 and BI39 through BI45)
revealed a heavily stratified succession of brown, yellowish brown, reddish brown and
dark grayish brown sandy clay soils that became steadily more compact with increasing
depth. The topography in the area featured a general rising slope as the route moved
south, eventually cresting at a steep rise located approximately 225 meters north of IH 20.
Shovel test 040, excavated at the apex of this rise, terminated at sandstone bedrock
encountered at 75 cmbs of steadily brightening brown clay. A small alpaca farm was
located atop the rise within the ROW (Figure 27). The livestock was present at the time
of survey.

The ROW then ran south down a steep southern slope for the remaining 225 meters to IH
20. Two shovel tests were excavated south of IH 20 in an undulating and densely wooded
area. Shovel testing encountered brown sandy loam topsoil to a depth of approximately
30 cmbs, overlaying reddish brown very sandy clay subsoil. No cultural materials were
collected or observed in any of the shovel tests excavated in Section C. Likewise no
cultural materials were observed on the ground surface throughout the pedestrian survey.
Structures
Numerous structures were noted throughout the survey either near or within the ROW of
the route. Many were modern homes and structures, such as barns, built in the last 30
years. However, several structures were at least 50 years old and could have been
potentially be eligible for the NRHP. Appendix B contains a list of structures encountered
and summarizes what is known about them. The following section of the report
summarizes structures by section and addresses properties that show on the 1959 USGS
map that are near or within the ROW.
Section A contained numerous structures none of which were shown on either the 1959
and the 1979 USGS maps. At the southern end of Section B, between Garner Road and
US 180, ten structures are mapped on the 1959 USGS map that are either within or near
the ROW (Figure 28). The properties containing these structures are P49, 46, 45, 31, 32,
34, 35 and 42. The small strip of land between P46 and P47 also shows a structure, yet
field survey confirmed that this structure was gone and no physical evidence of it was
found. On P46, structure mapping by FNI shows structures in the relative location of the
one shown on the map, yet according to the Parker County Appraisal District records, the
home currently on the property was built in 2005. However, since no ROEs were granted
the structure from the 1959 map could not be confirmed as to its current condition or
even if it was still there. The remainder of these structures are on the edge or are outside
of the ROW and will not be affected or removed by the project.
Section C contains seven structures that are mapped within or adjacent to the ROW on
the 1959 USGS map and 4 that are outside the ROW (Figure 29). The first structure south
of Greenwood Road on P22 contains a home that will be removed for the project and will
be discussed in more detail in the following section. P18 contains two structures on the
1959 map, a home and an outbuilding. Currently the property is a home and a pipe
company, which has multiple new structures and outbuildings. Since these structures are
on the edge of the ROW, they will be avoided by construction and the narrowing of the
surveyed 400-foot ROW to the 200-foot ROW that will be obtained for the project. P80,
which is east of P18, contains three structures, of which only one, the home at the front of
the lot, is on the 1959 map. Additionally, structures on P81, are within the ROW, and are
both on the 1959 map. Immediately south of Ranger Hwy, directly across from these
homes in P80 and P81 there are two structures on P79 that are within the ROW. All four
of these and the home at the front of P80 will be removed by the project and have been
assessed for eligible for inclusion on the NRHP in the following section. The final
structure shown on the 1959 map is on P15, which had no ROE. However, the entire

property was well maintained and open visually, so survey crews walked next to it on
P13 and the structure was no longer there and a new home had been built south of it on
the property. The few historic structures outside of the ROW will not be affected by the
project.

Historic-aged Structure Survey Results
The reconnaissance survey of historic-age resources within the APE of Section C of the
Western Loop includes six structures that were built prior to 1965 (Figure 30). Of these
six, one structure dates to approximately 1925, Field Number 3. Built in the Craftsman
style, this house has been abandoned, is in poor condition and is currently used to house
livestock. The Craftsman style was popularized in the early 20th century in the United
States and can be identified by the low-pitched gabled or hipped roofs and the exposed
______________________________________________________________________________________

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF THE WESTERN LOOP ROADWAY

35

rafters that are usually visible along the rooflines of residences. A common feature
among Craftsman homes is the porch supports, which typically have square posts resting
on massive piers or a balustrade. A one-story Craftsman home is often referred to as a
“bungalow” or the Bungaloid style
The other historic-age houses in the area are in the Minimal Tradition style. These
include field numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 with 6 being a Ranch style house. Structures built
beginning in 1935 and through the 1960s are recognized as Mid-Century Modern and
include the styles Minimal Traditional (ca. 1935-1950), Ranch (ca. 1935-1975), Split
Level (ca. 1955-1975), and Contemporary (ca. 1940-1980). Structures in the Minimal
Traditional style are usually devoid of decorative detailing and influenced by many
different architectural styles. The Minimal Traditional style commonly features front
facing gabled roofs with a lower pitch.
The historic-age structures within the APE and ROW do not possess enough NRHP
integrity criteria as evident in many of the homes in Weatherford’s historic
neighborhoods, such as the Loving Neighborhood and along Lee Street.
Research failed to yield any significance of importance as to the location of these historic
-age structures. The settings of the historic-age structures is inconsistent from block to
block, and provides evidence of urban growth of Weatherford particularly following the
housing boom after World War II.
Construction materials are typical of the eras in which the houses were built, but
deterioration and unsympathetic renovations and alterations have led to the loss of
integrity of most of the structures. The workmanship of the historic-age structures is
simple and does not reflect that of an architect or master craftsman or builder except
Field Number 6 which is a Ranch style house.
In summary, it is the recommendation of the author of this report that no NRHP eligible
historic-age resources are located within the APE or ROW. No additional research or
field investigation appear to be necessary at this time

Built during the post World War II boom period, the house at 1705 Ranger Highway on
property 79, displays architectural elements typical of the minimal traditional style,
particularly seen in the structure’s lack of ornamentation and asymmetrical design.
Located on less than an acre, the house appeared on deed records by 1953, which lists the
presence of a residence and principal buildings on the property. The one-story house was
constructed with pier and beam foundation, including a stone skirting and a wood frame.
Characteristic of minimal traditional design, the building features a side-gabled roof,
comprised of composition shingles and restrained ornamentation, with an exception seen
in the exposed rafters. The one-bay front porch includes a front-gabled roof with wood
post supports, brackets, and a concrete deck. A prominent feature of the house is the
double-hung windows with vinyl inserts and a light composition of 6/6.
A carport was added to the east side of the house at a later date and is sympathetic with
the materials of the main structure. The carport includes a concrete deck; however, the
driveway up to the house appears to be comprised of dirt and grass. The large trees
dominate the property’s landscape, which also includes sparse shrubs, grass, and a wire
fence. While in fair condition, the house still retains the basic craftsmanship of its
original state and has undergone little apparent alteration.
The outbuilding, which is situated in the rear of the property, has wood lap siding and a
composition shingle roof. The structure most likely serves as a shed and has undergone at
least one addition apparent through the irregular roofline. The structure, which is in fair
condition, features exposed rafters and a shed porch roof without any supports.

NRHP Status: Not Eligible
Address: 1703 Ranger Highway
Parker County
Legal Description: .744 acres, TR 90 x 360, Benjamin Thomas Survey
Geo Reference Number: 21563.002.000.00
Built: 1945 estimated
Style: Minimal Traditional
Condition: Good
Located on 0.744 acres at 1703 Ranger Highway, the one-story structure on property 79
was built in the post World War II period and exhibits elements of the minimal traditional
style, which was an outgrowth of the depression period of the 1930s, reflected in its
emphasis on a lack of detail. The wood frame house retains much of its original design
and features a side-gabled roof comprised of composition shingles and false-bevel drop,
wood siding. Although the house lacks ornamentation, typical with its style, it does,
however, include a gable-end vent and ornamental wrought iron supports and balustrade
for the inset front porch. While the house is symmetrical, not typical of the style, the front
entrance, a wood panel door with glass inserts, is off center, a characteristic of the
minimal traditional style. Prominent elements of the house include the double-hung
windows with vinyl inserts and the interior red brick chimney. The property’s landscape
includes several large trees, bedding plants, bushes, and a chain link fence.

Integrity of Field Numbers 1 and 2.
Location: The two structures identified as Field Numbers 1 and 2 are situated in property
79, sit side-by-side on two tracks of land purchased in 1945 by the L. L. Bantau family
from John W. and Abbie Todd. The Bantaus were early settlers in the Greenwood
Community. According to Parker County deed records, the Bantaus built the houses
sometime after 1945. They retained the properties until 1950, when they were sold to
A.W. and Lona K. Johnson. In 1953, D.C. and Bertie Lou Anderson purchased the
residence and land of Field Number 1 and in 1958, purchased the residence and land of
Field Number 2. Bothe properties are currently owned by Bertie Lou Anderson.
The two structures are located on Ranger Highway formerly called WWII Veterans
Highway. The main occupation of residents in the Greenwood Community was farming.
The houses are rental properties and may have been since the early 1960s. No significant
events were found to have occurred on these properties. A mixture of residential,
commercial, agricultural and industrial uses is evident in this area of Greenwood
Community along Ranger Highway.
Design, Setting and Workmanship: The two structures are similar in design and
workmanship as both have features indicative of Minimal Traditional houses built after
World War II. The houses lack decorative elements of the Craftsman period with plain
facades and simple massing of the structures. Better examples of this style can be found
throughout Parker County and in particular the City of Weatherford. Both houses are set
back from the highway and do not have sidewalks nor paved driveways. The setting of
the houses evokes a sense of a rural community that lacks zoning as light industrial
businesses are allowed to operate near residences and churches.
Feeling and Association: The houses were built in what was once a rural community, yet
newer buildings nearby, that are a combination of light industrial and commercial
businesses, deter from the former bucolic setting. Association with historical events or
persons was not found for these two properties.

Field Number: 3
NRHP Status: Not Eligible
Address: 1889 Greenwood Road
Parker County
Legal Description: 2.687 acres. T&P RR Co. Survey
Geo Reference Number: 21453.006.002.00
Built: 1925 estimated
Style: Craftsman
Condition: Poor
The one-story, wood frame house located on property 22 on the south side of Greenwood
Road at 1889 is situated on the 2 ½ acre property since around 1925. The house retains
the original wood clapboard siding and features a multi-leveled, side-gabled roof.
Although the structure is in poor condition, the house displays the basic fabric of its
original state in the wood sash windows and clapboard siding. Built in the Craftsman
style, which became popular after the turn of the century, the house characterizes its
design with a low-pitched, gabled roof, exposed rafters, and multiple roof planes. The
front façade of the house displays a prominent fixed window flanked by two double hung
windows, typical of its style, while the other windows are double hung in style and vary
in light composition, including 6/6 and 1/1. Other elements of the house include a gableend vent, a shed roof and a corner porch supported by wood posts. The deck of the porch
is in poor condition; however, the structure’s original two front entrances are still
accessible from the porch. There is a rear entrance to the house, located on the east
façade, which is now inaccessible due to its missing steps. It is apparent that the house
has undergone additions in the rear portion of the home, noticeable in the irregular
roofline and siding. While the house retains much of its original design and materials, it
is in an increasingly poor condition. The landscape of the property includes several large
trees and grass and is delineated by a metal and chain link fence. The property also
includes an outbuilding located in the rear of the house, which appears to have been used
as a barn. The wood frame structure includes a metal, gabled roof and corrugated metal
siding, but is in very poor condition.

Location: This house is situated in the Greenwood Community. The land was bought by
L.H. and Hazel Frysinger in 1943 from Merchants & Farmers State Bank. The Frysingers
assumed a mortgage on the property and house. The Frysingers are listed in the 1952 City
Directory for Weatherford and Parker County. The house was inherited by the Frysingers
daughter and son-in-law, Rodney C. and Fonda Phillips in 1978 from the estate of Hazel
Frysinger. Left to neglect, the property was sold to David Hamilton in 2001. The house
has been abandoned and is currently used to shelter goats and sheep raised by the
Hamiltons.
Design, Materials and Workmanship: The house appears to have been well constructed
and displays elements of Craftsman period design as well as Neo-Classical elements.
After many years of neglect, the farmhouse has lost all architectural integrity.
Setting, Feeling and Association: The house sits on a hill surrounded by mature trees. No
historic events or persons are associated with the house or land. The Frysingers lived in
the Greenwood Community for many years. The house is east of the historic Greenwood
Community Cemetery and historic Methodist church that is located at Greenwood Road
and Greenwood Road Cut-Off.

Parker County
Legal Description: 1.139 acres, Thomas Brown Survey
Geo Reference Number: 20133.009.000.00
Built: 1950 estimated
Style: Craftsman and No Style
Condition: Fair
This one-story house, which was constructed around 1950, is located at 1738 Ranger
Highway on a 1.139 acre lot on property 80. The structure appears to lack a particular
architectural style as a result of several additions to the home and the implementation of a
variety of elements. The majority of the house consists of replacement particle or pressed
board siding, while the front porch has retained its original wood clapboard siding.
Supported by wood posts, the wide, shed roof porch, an element of the Craftsman style,
has undergone renovations in what appears to be an attempt to enclose it. As a result, the
front porch features one enclosed wall that includes double hung aluminum windows.
Typical of the minimal traditional style is the low-pitched, cross-gabled roof, comprised
of composition shingles and featuring a gable-end vent. The rear of the house was also
under renovation, leaving the garage unenclosed and without a garage door. The windows

on the house are double hung, and varying in light composition. The property’s landscape
includes several trees, shrubs, large hedges, grass, and a stone wall, and is bordered by a
chain link fence. The structure does not retain much of its original materials or
workmanship, and appears to be a combination of vernacular styles that result in a lack of
architectural design. In the rear of the property, an outbuilding was constructed with
several additions and served as the garage to the main residence. The structure is
comprised of several sidings types, including vertical wood lap, wood clapboard and
synthetic replacement siding. The building is neither original nor sympathetic to the main
residence, and features four distinct additions seen in the irregular roofline and different
claddings. The outbuilding features a shed and gabled roof, exposed rafters, and double
hung windows that have been boarded up.

Location: The two structures are located on Ranger Highway, set back from the road.
Next door to the west, is a new residence and commercial business. A paved lane
separates the two properties. As with Field Numbers 1, 2, 5, and 6, commercial,
agricultural and industrial businesses are interspersed among houses and churches. There
is no cohesive planning of properties along Ranger Highway. No significant events were
found to have occurred on the properties.
Design, Materials and Workmanship: The house has many alterations and incomplete
renovations with no particular regard to the design elements of the original house.
Setting, Feeling and Association: The house sits back from the road and is enclosed by a
chain link fence. No historic events or persons are associated with the house or land.
Research of past property owners failed to yield any information of significant persons.
The property was owned by Joseph and Dorothy Hutchins from 1982 until 2007 when it
was purchased by Jean Grimm.

Field No. 5
Built around 1950, the one-story structure was built in the minimal traditional style with a
modified-L plan. The house appears to be comprised of a faux brick siding and features a
side-gabled roof with composition shingles. The inset, front porch is supported by
ornamental wrought iron and features a concrete deck. While the building lacks much
ornamentation, typical of the minimal traditional style, it does feature exposed rafters and
lentils on the double hung windows. Although in relatively good condition, the house has
little to offer in terms of architectural elements and design. An outbuilding is located to
the east side of the house, and most likely serves as a shed. The metal building is
unsympathetic to the main house and is characterized by its flat, metal roof, corrugated

metal siding, and wood paneled entrance. The property is devoid of much landscaping,
except for sparse grass and trees, which diminishes the overall feeling of the house.

Field No. 6
This Ranch-style structure was built around 1958, and represents its design with a onestory layout and low-pitched roof. Comprised of stone veneer siding, the structure
features a side-gabled roof with composition shingles and a moderate eave overhang.
Typical of the ranch style, the wide front porch is supported by ornamental wrought iron
posts, with ornamental metal brackets serving as corbels, and a concrete deck. Indicative
of homes built during the latter half of the 20th century, the building features double hung
windows, with brick sills, built close to the eave. The landscape of the property is
dominated by the trees, and also includes a stone wall and potted plants. The property
includes three outbuildings, a well house, a garage, and a shed. The well house is located
on the west side of the property and features a gabled roof and wood siding. The
sympathetic garage has been attached to the house via a carport and features a front
gabled roof. Located to the east of the house, the garage is comprised of brick veneer and
features a decorative garage door. Located directly behind the garage, the metal shed
appears to have a clipped, side-gabled roof.

Integrity of Field Numbers 5 and 6
Location: The two structures are located on Ranger Highway, set back from the road.
Number 5 is located at the front of the property and is a rental property. Number 6 is set
back and to the east of Number 5. No significant events were found to have occurred on
the property.
Design, Materials and Workmanship: Number 5 is a simple structure exhibiting
characteristics of houses built during the post WWII building boom. The house is leaning
on its foundation and may have some structural issues. Number 6 appears to be a well
built house with an interesting use of hewn stone for the façade. A rock wall near the
entrance is another interesting feature of the house.
Setting, Feeling and Association: The property is associated with the Guerry family, long
time residents of Parker County. F.I. Guerry is listed in the 1934 Parker County City
Directory. Several members of the family lived in Weatherford and other locals in Parker
County. Deed and tax records indicate the F.I. Guerry family has owned the property
since the mid1920s.

Conclusions
No prehistoric sites were encountered during the pedestrian survey despite 97 shovel tests
excavated along the route. Prehistoric sites were expected to be temporary campsites near
drainages and anywhere Uvalde gravels had deflated onto the surface of upland divides.
The route crosses Town Creek and Pogue Branch in the Section B, however this is very
high up in the watershed and no knappable gravels were noted anywhere on the route.
Properties that were not shovel tested during the survey were visually evaluated from
fence lines and roadways. Given the negative results of the shovel tests and the similar
settings that these properties compared favorably to the neighboring properties, it is
unlikely that prehistoric sites would be located on any of these properties.
One historic archaeological site was recorded during the project, 41PR123, the limestone
dam on Pogue Branch in Section B, and is potentially eligible for listing on the NRHP.
This is an early to mid 20th century dam constructed with cut limestone blocks and
covered with a concrete façade. This structure will however be avoided by the
construction of the project, work on the stream will take place 500 feet upstream and the
property where the dam is located will not be purchased for the project. Additionally, as
stated in the research design historic structures were likely to be encountered anywhere
the route crossed transportation routes. Historic trash scatters or isolated artifacts were
expected to be found near drainages or abandoned transportation routes. No trash dumps
were located, but numerous structures were identified in the field. The majority of them
will be avoided by the narrowing of the 400-foot wide survey ROW to the 200-foot wide
construction ROW. However, the 6 structures on properties 22, 79, 80 and 81 would be
removed for the construction of the route. All of these structures appear on the 1959
USGS map and are at least 50 years old; yet based upon the historic-aged structure
survey none were eligible for inclusion on the NRHP.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Given the results of the pedestrian survey, ARC recommends that the properties that were
shovel tested are clear of any prehistoric archaeological sites. Additionally, the properties
that had no secured ROE; were similar and also have a very low potential for prehistoric
and historic sites. Additionally, the historic-aged structure survey revealed that all 6
structures with ROE were ineligible for the NRHP. Site 41PR123, is considered
potentially eligible for listing on the NRHP, but will be avoided by the project and is
located on property that will not be acquired by the County. ARC recommends that no
further archaeological investigations are warranted and the project should proceed as
planned. If cultural resources are encountered during construction, work should
immediately cease in that area and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission should be notified. Work should not continue until discussions with the
proper agency have been concluded.
