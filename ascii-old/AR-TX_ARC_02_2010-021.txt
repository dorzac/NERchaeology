ABSTRACT
The North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD) is proposing to
replace the Plano West Side Pipeline, which is located along the north side
of Renner Road in southern Collin County, Texas. The entire route is
approximately 3.7 miles long and extends from Shiloh Road to Custer
Road. AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) conducted the intensive pedestrian
archaeological survey of those parts of the route where it crosses under
Spring Creek and one of its intermittent tributaries to the east. Shovel
testing was conducted in these areas along the creeks and recovered no
cultural materials. The portion of the pipeline from the west side of Spring
Creek to the east side of the DART Rail will be bored under. Virtually all
of the other parts of the route are located in the Blackland Prairie uplands,
which dominates the landscape and where it has been determined that
there is a low archaeological potential. Based on the negative results of the
survey, ARC recommends that the NTMWD be allowed to construct the
3.7 miles of pipeline, without the need for further cultural resource
investigations. If cultural resources are encountered during construction,
work should immediately cease in that area and the Archeology Division
of the Texas Historical Commission should be notified. If cultural material
is found within Spring Creek, the Fort Worth District of the US Army
Corps of Engineers also should be notified.

INTRODUCTION
The North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD) is proposing to replace the Plano
West Side Pipeline, along the north side of Renner Road just north of the Dallas County
line in Collin County, Texas (Figure 1). The entire route is approximately 3.7 miles long
and follows Renner Road between Shiloh Road and Custer Road. NTMWD has
contracted with Freese, and Nichols, Inc. (FNI) to conduct the environmental permitting
and FNI has contracted with AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) to conduct the intensive
pedestrian archaeological survey. ARC conducted a comprehensive archaeological
survey of those parts of the pipeline route where it crosses under Spring Creek and an
intermittent tributary of Spring Creek that is situated to the east. Portions of the pipeline
from Custer Road to US75 and from Plano Road to Shiloh Road will be installed under
Renner Road. The temporary construction easement combined with a new permanent
easement for the pipeline will be generally 100 feet wide. Reduced widths are used in
select sections to protect existing structures, trees, and ornamental fencing. The pipeline
will have three bore crossings: US75, Spring Creek and the Dart Rail (previously the
Southern Pacific Railroad and the Central Texas Railroad). The bore across Spring Creek
will be at a minimal depth of 6 feet below the creek bottom in the bedrock. The
intermittent tributary crossing east of Plano Road will be open cut trenched, removing
and replacing the existing headwall that was installed on the drainage culvert crossing
Renner Road to the south.
The remaining parts of the route are located in the Blackland Prairie upland which
dominates the landscape and where it has been determined that there is a low
archaeological potential. These upland areas were farmed until the late 20th century and
some farming continues. The unfarmed areas have been converted into commercial and
residential properties. These areas have been substantially disturbed and have a low
potential for archaeological sites that the Texas Historical Commission (Ed Baker,
personal communication) indicated that survey is unwarranted.
The survey was necessitated because NTMWD is a political subdivision of the State of
Texas. The Antiquities Code of Texas is applicable for this investigation, and since
Spring Creek, a water of the United States will be impacted, the Texas Historical
Commission will not only act as the State Review Agency but also will act as the Section
106 review agency for the US Army Corps of Engineers. Texas Antiquities Permit
Number 5575 was issued for the archaeological survey. The purpose of this survey was to
locate cultural resources, make recommendations about their significance and describe
how they might be impacted by construction. Relevant federal legislation includes
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as
amended (PL-96-515), the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), the
Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291),
Executive Order No. 11593 “Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural Environment,”
and Procedures for the Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties (36CFR800),
Appendix C.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The study area is situated on Houston Black-Austin soil association (Hanson and Wheeler
1969: General Soils Map). The Houston Black-Austin association is characterized by
being gently sloping to sloping on uplands, with clayey soils that are deep over marl and
chalk. Houston Black clay is found along the majority of the route along with some
Austin silty clay and Lewisville silty clays. These soils have 1-5 percent slopes and are
eroded. The clay content causes these soils to have a high shrink/swell capacity and
promote rapid water runoff. Other types of soils include Houston Black clay with 1-3
percent slopes, and Austin silty clay with 1-3 percent slopes. There are floodplain soils
mapped along the Spring Creek, which consist of occasionally flooded Trinity clay.
There are no floodplain soils mapped at the unnamed tributary that the route also crosses.
On the 1959 and 1960 USGS maps, Spring Creek and the tributary are shown as
perennial, while the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) shows them as both intermittent
(Hanson and Wheeler 1969: Sheet 59).
The underlying geology comprises Upper Cretaceous age Austin chalk undivided, with a
thickness of about 600 ft (Bureau of Economic Geology 1967). The upper and lower
parts include chalk and light gray massive calcareous clay. The middle part includes thinbedded marl with interbred of massive chalk and light gray. Austin chalk is highly
fractured, faulted, and jointed (Allen and Flanigan 1986).
Collin County lies in the Texan biotic province determined by Blair (1950:98). Clay soils
originally supported a tall-grass prairie, but these are now mostly cultivated (Blair 1950).
The Texan biotic province sits between a water surplus and a water deficiency zone,
which characterizes the entire fauna and flora of the area. The principal type of
vegetation encountered in Collin County is Blackland Prairie (Schmidly 1983). The only
riparian environment on the route is that in the immediate vicinity of Spring Creek. The
rest of the route is prairie. Blackland soils are fairly uniform dark-colored clays
interspersed with some gray acid sandy loams. Grasses include various species of
Bluestem and Grama. Precipitation in the north of this zone averages 115 cm and
temperatures reach an average of 28 degrees centigrade. Forty-nine species of mammals
have occurred in recent times, including various species of squirrels, rabbits, mice, and
armadillo. Other animals include 16 different species of lizards as well as 39 different
species of snakes.
Fields of Uvalde Gravel (Byrd 1971) have been recorded in upland settings between the
valleys of the Elm Fork and West Fork on upland divides (Menzer and Slaughter
1971:217). Mapped locations of previously recorded beds of Ogallala gravels are on
upland divides to the south, east and southwest of the study area (McGregor 1995:Figure
4). These gravels are likely to be an eastward extension of Ogallala gravels (Banks
1990:56) and similar gravel fields may be present in the study area, although not shown
by McGregor.

CULTURE HISTORY
The history of the Collin County region can be traced to as early as 8-9000 B.C. and
since that time, Collin County appears to have been continuously occupied (Crook n.d.).
The physical evidence of past occupation in the county has been termed "cultural
resources," and many of these resources have been of such significance that they have
been recognized, recorded and in many cases preserved (RMA/Texas 1986).
Prehistoric Native American settlement in Collin County began at least 10,000 years ago
as attested to by the presence of distinctively shaped dart points. No very early prehistoric
sites have been recorded in the county but Paleo-Indian sites have been reported from
Denton County to the west in the valley of the Elm Fork of the Trinity River (Crook and
Harris 1957; Ferring 2001). Nevertheless, artifact collectors report the presence of
Folsom, Scottsbluff and other Paleo-Indian points from the surface of sites in the region.
The presence of exotic, i.e., non-local, lithic resources indicates that these early people
traveled a territory where higher quality lithics were available or were involved in a
system of raw material trading. These early people hunted now extinct large game but
probably also foraged off the land.
The subsequent period, the Archaic, lasted from 7,000 to 6,000 B.C. to possibly as late as
A.D. 700 or 800. The Archaic peoples lived throughout the county but particularly along
the major and minor stream valleys where they were able to hunt animals and gather wild
plants (Lynott 1977). Dart points, grinding stones, fire-cracked rock and scrapers are
common artifacts found on Archaic sites. The earliest Archaic peoples continued making
and using exotic cherts for dart points, but as time passed, there was a shift toward the
use of local lithics for chipped stone tools. These local materials are described as Uvalde
Gravels (Menzer and Slaughter 1971; Byrd 1971). Small scatters of lithic debris have
been recorded in upland areas throughout the county (Lynott 1974; Hughston and Lynott
1974; Peter 1990; Hunt, Peter and Allday 1991). These sites appear to be Archaic in age
but none have been thoroughly studied and their relationship to the Lake Lavon sites is
uncertain.
About A.D. 700 or 800, a major change is found in the artifacts and settlement patterning
of the prehistoric sites. Sites tend to congregate along the main stem of the East Fork of
the Trinity River. This is attributed to the drying up of the smaller tributaries. During this
period, which is known as the Late Prehistoric, Caddoan pottery from East Texas appears
as trade material along with the indigenous Nocona Plain pottery. It has been suggested
that farming may have been practiced. Arrowheads appear about this same time and
apparently, the bow and arrow had been added to the hunting tools. The other interesting
thing is the appearance of large, circular pits constructed at sites along the East Fork and
its tributaries. No good explanation has been posed about the function of these features
although various authors have offered their interpretations (Stephenson 1952; Lynott
1975; Bruseth and Martin 1987).
At the end of the Late Prehistoric period, there appears to have been a general
abandonment of the Collin County and the north central Texas area based on an absence

of sites with trade goods that might have been obtained from French, Spanish or English
traders (Skinner 1988). This simplistic interpretation is tied to a general drying trend and
attempts to factor in negative information generated by professional and avocational
archaeologists who have conducted numerous site surveys throughout the region. There is
very little evidence of historic era Native American occupation anywhere in the county
until historic accounts indicate that groups were present in the early 1800's.
European settlement in Collin County began in the mid-1800s with the establishment of
the Peter's Colony after Texas independence. The colonists cultivated the prairie lands for
their livelihood. The county was established in 1846 and the county seat was at Buckner
until 1848 when it was moved to McKinney. Settlement has continued to the present. By
the turn of the century, all of the major communities had been established and some had
passed away.
Previous Investigations
Surveys in the Blackland prairies of Collin County (La Vadera and Geister 1988; Hunt,
Peter and Allday 1991; Skinner 1996, 1998; Skinner and Trask 1996; Skinner and
Whorton 1996a, b and c; Hunt Peter, Largent and Shanabrook 1997; Skinner and Kent
1998; Todd and Skinner 2002) indicate that unless a permanent water supply such as a
spring or perennial stream is present, the prehistoric archaeological potential is low. The
uplands of the Blackland Prairie usually lack water and biotic diversity; therefore, the
native people who visited the area probably did not stay long, possibly only long enough
to hunt buffalo or antelope. However, historic sites have been recorded along roads and
railroad routes (Skinner and Skinner 1996). Site 41COL96, consists of a limestone dam
with a pump foundation and a limestone foundation to a water tank that was associated
with the Houston and Texas Central Railroad, just north of the study area in Allen
(Skinner and Skinner 1996). A review of historic maps show that there were structures
mapped along the north side of Renner Road and near the railroad tracks as early as 1930,
as shown on the Collin County soil map (USDA 1930).
The Texas Archeological Society Atlas (TASA) lists no site directly adjacent to the
proposed survey sections of the study area. However, along Spring Creek south of
Renner Road, three sites have been recorded. The first two were recorded as part of the
Spring Creek Nature Area. 41COL82 is a prehistoric lithic scatter and 41COL83 is a
farmstead and cemetery (Skinner 1991; Green, James and Hunt 1997). 41COL82 consists
of an early archaic site with various kinds of imported cherts. The site is situated outside
of the floodplain on a bedrock bench overlooking Spring Creek. 41COL83 is the Historic
Routh Family Farmstead with two associated cemeteries, all of which date to the between
the mid to late 19th through the 20th century. Both sites are considered to have research
potential and could possibly be eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP). Site 41DL372 is located on an intermittent tributary of Spring Creek.
The site is also a late 19th century farmstead near the railroad tracks, now the DART Rail,
and is considered to have potential for inclusion on the NRHP.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Research Design
A records review indicated no evidence of prehistoric or historic occupation in the survey
area. Based on the known prehistoric and historic archaeology of the area, we proposed
the following two research questions.
The first research question concerns the prehistoric occupation of the study area. It was
predicted that the upland prairie portions of the proposed pipeline route had little
likelihood of having been occupied prehistorically based on the absence of permanent
water, low biotic diversity, and lack of knappable gravels. However, buried
archaeological sites might be present along Spring Creek and the unnamed tributary that
the route crosses under as prehistoric sites are recorded along Spring Creek south of the
study area. Due to the small size of these water drainages, such sites are more likely to be
temporary hunting camps and would consist of artifact scatters of lithic debris of
imported cherts or local quartzite gravels, as well as fire cracked rock.
The second question concerns the historic occupation of the study area, which is near a
historic transportation route that has residences plotted along Renner Road, as shown on
the 1930 Collin County soil map and 1959 and 1960 USGS topographic maps. Historic
sites could consist of structures and trash scatters. Since the study area has been
continuously occupied since the 19th century, historic structures are likely to be located
on the uplands above the creek or near the railroad tracks. Additionally, historic artifact
scatters are likely to be located along any drainages.
Methodology
The field teams walked parallel transects spaced 20 meters apart and made thorough field
notes about ground exposure, soil types and disturbed areas. Shovel tests were excavated
in relatively undisturbed areas approximately every 50 meters, with ground visibility less
than 30 percent and locations with a slope less than 20 percent. Each one was excavated
to the bottom of Holocene deposit according to THC standards (n.d). Shovel tests
averaged 30 cm in diameter, and were supplemented by an auger. The clay fill from the
shovel tests was inspected visually and broken into smaller chunks in order to determine
if cultural materials were present. Sandy soils from the shovel tests were screened
through ¼” hardware cloth. Shovel test matrices were described on the basis of texture
and color. The Munsell Soil Color Chart was used to identify the specific soil colors in
each test. Photographs were taken throughout the survey area using a Fuji FinePix J38
12.2 mega pixel digital camera. The shovel test locations were recorded with a handheld
Garmin Colorado 400t GPS unit.

RESULTS
This chapter is separated into three sections with the description of the survey area for the
proposed pipeline route first, and then followed by the survey results. Shovel tests will be
described briefly within the text and are detailed in Table 1. Conclusions end the chapter.
Survey Area
The survey area consists of two east/west running sections of pipeline situated
immediately to the north of Renner Road (Figure 2). The eastern section runs west
approximately 370 meters from the intersection of Renner Road and Owens Boulevard,
and crosses an unnamed, intermittent tributary of Spring Creek. The western section runs
west from the DART Rail to SH 75, and crosses under Spring Creek. The terrain in both
sections of the study area was relatively level, but features sloping topography within the
drainage channels.

The eastern section begins in a cleared, maintained pasture west of the intersection of
Renner Road and Owens Boulevard. Ground visibility along the route was between 15
and 70 percent, with the better ground visibility in the pastures surrounding the wooded
areas. The route runs west through this area of mown grass cover for approximately 40
meters before entering a densely wooded area that marks the tributary drainage, and
which features oaks, hackberries, bois d’arcs and scattered cedars. The ground slopes
steadily toward the drainage channel, which is roughly 4 to 5 meters wide and 2 to 3
meters deep, but contains only approximately 10 cm of running water in a meandering
channel. Limestone gravels were observed in the channel bottom, though they likely
washed in. The west bank of the channel is significantly higher than the east, and the
ground is relatively level moving west out of the wooded drainage area into an expanse
of improved pasture.
The western section begins in a cleared pasture immediately west of the DART Rail. The
route then runs approximately 85 meters to the Spring Creek channel. The channel is 5 to
7 meters wide, with a steeply sloping bank on the east side, and a short gradual bank on
the west side. The east bank is 5 to 7 meters high, while the west bank is roughly two
meters high. However, bedrock is visible in both banks at a depth of approximately two
meters (Figure 3 and 4). However, the channel bottom is composed almost entirely of
exposed bedrock. The terrain rises gently to the west of Spring Creek, before
encountering a raised and level building pad of fill that sits immediately to the east of SH
75.

Survey Results
Survey began at the eastern terminus of the eastern survey section. To the north of the
pipeline route, a rubble scatter was observed, which consisted of brick and concrete
debris. It was initially believed that the rubble might have been associated with one of
three structures depicted on the 1958 USGS map of the area; however, closer
examination of the rubble revealed it to be modern building material. This conclusion
was buttressed by the presence of a hot tub and other decidedly modern trash in the area,
indicating present day dumping activity. The location of the structure on the map was
explored and no evidence of a foundation or other structural elements was located.
The first shovel test was excavated just to the east of the wooded area that traces the
tributary (Figure 5). It revealed brown loamy clay topsoil overlaying light yellowish
brown loamy clay subsoil, which was on top of bedrock at 60cm below the surface
(cmbs). Calcium carbonate was encountered at 25cmbs, and was present all the way to
bedrock. This soil profile was repeated in shovel test 2 (PR2), though bedrock was
encountered deeper, at 90cmbs. The remaining shovel tests excavated in the eastern line
were located within a few meters on either side of the tributary, and encountered very
dark gray clay to depths between 100 to 160cmbs. No cultural remains were observed in
any of the five shovel tests excavated in the eastern line, or anywhere on the ground
surface. The route was thoroughly examined for remains of three structures mapped on
the 1958 USGS map, though none were present.

Survey sections shown on a recent aerial photograph.

Survey began in the western survey section with three shovel tests excavated in the
cleared pecan orchard east of Spring Creek (Figure 6). Shovel tests were placed
approximately 50 meters apart. PR6 is close to the railroad track, as shown in Figure 6.
PR7 is approximately located near the mapped structure on the USGS map and PR8 is
approximately 3 meters east of the steep drop into Spring Creek’s Channel. These
revealed a heavily mottled and stratified soil profile, which consisted generally of grayish
brown loamy clay topsoil overlaying steadily darkening layers of clay. In PR6, bedrock
was encountered at 95cmbs, though in PR7 and PR8, bedrock was not reached. However,
eroding bedrock was observed in the bank profile at a depth of two meters below the
surface. No cultural materials were observed in any of these three shovel tests.
Additionally, because bedrock occurs between 20cm and 2 meters below the surface and
since this section will be bored, deep testing was not warranted. As in the eastern route, a
structure was plotted on the 1958 USGS map between the DART Rail and Spring Creek
near the proposed pipeline route. However, no remnants of the structure were observed
anywhere on the ground surface or in the shovel tests.

West of Spring Creek, two shovel tests were excavated in a narrow, wooded area that
traces the western edge of the drainage that was bounded by silt fencing. Both
encountered dark grayish brown loamy clay topsoil overlaying very dark grayish brown
clay subsoil. Calcium carbonate was present in the entirety of both shovel tests. West of
the wooded channel, the route enters an area that has been filled, raised and leveled for a
building padsite that was never developed (Figure 7). Measuring approximately 165
meters east/west and 200 meters north/south, the pad was raised as high as 10 meters
above ground level. As such, this portion of the route from Spring Creek west to SH 75
was not surveyed. The bore location is also located within this portion of the route. Deep
testing was also not warranted in this location due to the disturbance and fill activity and
because there appeared to be only 2 meters of sediment on the channel edge resting on
bedrock. Additionally, this creek floods very regularly and the sediments are frequently
and regularly washed out.

Conclusions
No prehistoric or historic cultural resources were located on the surface or in any of the
10 shovel tests. Spring Creek is shown on the USGS maps as a perennial stream, but the
SCS maps it as an intermittent tributary. Additionally, the route crosses Spring Creek
high in the watershed in the Blackland Prairie. Given the depth and width of the channel,
it could have been a good water resource. The previous investigations demonstrate that
the area surrounding the study area could contain knappable Uvalde gravels, but none
were seen in any shovel tests or in the creek channels. Additionally, the area has been
developed extensively and it is reasonable to conclude that no recognizable prehistoric
occupation occurred in the area of the pipeline route along Spring Creek and its tributary.
The absence of historic sites along the pipeline route may simply be due to the fact that it
is situated in a floodplain setting. Four structures were shown on the earlier maps along
the routes and the area was farmed historically. However, recent development in that area
has removed all remains of the structures. Historic trash scatters along the drainages were
also expected, yet none were observed. In conclusion, it appears that the survey area was
farmed from the late 19th through the 20th century but all evidence of these activities has
been lost to development.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the above information, it is AR Consultants, Inc.’s recommendation that the
North Texas Municipal Water District be allowed to construct the 3.7 miles of pipeline,
without the need for further cultural resource investigations. If cultural resources are
encountered during construction, work should immediately cease in that area and the
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission should be notified. If the
cultural material is found within Spring Creek, the Fort Worth District of the US Army
Corps of Engineers also should be notified. Work should not continue until discussions
with the proper agency have been concluded.
