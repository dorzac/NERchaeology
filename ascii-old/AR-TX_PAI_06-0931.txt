ABSTRACT
On November 14–15, 2018, personnel from Prewitt and Associates, Inc., conducted
an intensive archeological survey of 54 acres of land in Friesenhahn Park, in northeastern
San Antonio, for the City of San Antonio under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8634. The field
investigations consisted of pedestrian transect survey and the excavation of 22 shovel tests.
The survey did not identify any new historic sites or prehistoric Native American archeological
sites. However, previously recorded prehistoric site 41BX933 was revisited to assess its present
condition and extent within the park. The site is a surface and near-surface scatter of lithic
artifacts that likely mark intermittent camps situated on the upland edge overlooking the
small stream that bisects the park. The site does not have the capacity to contribute important
information and thus is considered ineligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places
or designation as a State Antiquities Landmark. As no sites were found elsewhere in the park,
it is concluded that the proposed park development will not impact significant archeological
resources, and it is recommended that development can proceed without additional archeological
investigations.
The archeological survey did not recover any artifacts. Notes on the artifacts observed
on the surface and found in shovel tests were recorded by the project archeologists in the field.
As such, this project does not require artifact curation. Project records currently housed at the
offices of Prewitt and Associates, Inc., will be transferred to the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin.

INTRODUCTION
On November 14–15, 2018, personnel from Prewitt and Associates, Inc.,
conducted an intensive archeological survey of Friesenhahn Park, in northeastern
San Antonio, for the City of San Antonio under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8634. The
park location is south of Loop 1604 between Interstate Highway 35 and U.S. Highway
281, just southwest of McClain Park and northwest of the Union Pacific Railroad
tracks (Figure 1). All of the survey work done complies with the requirements of the
Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resource Code of 1977, Title 9, Chapter
191, VTCS 6145-9) and the City of San Antonio’s Historic Preservation and Design
Section of the Unified Development Code (Article 6 35-360-634).
The September 2018 Concept Plan for park development includes an 8-ftwide concrete trail extending westward across the park from existing trails and
other development at the northeast end of the park. The new development will
mostly be on the south side of a small unnamed intermittent stream that flows
southwest though the middle of the park and is presently marked at its eastern
head by a water tank and dam. A single box culvert would cross this stream at
the west end of the trail. In addition, there are three areas along the trail where
benches and trash and recycle bins may be installed, and one area where exercise
stations may be installed. The horizontal area of potential effects for the project
is 54 acres, while the vertical area of potential effects will be less than 1 ft in
most places.
As detailed below, the Texas Historical Commission’s Archeological Sites
Atlas shows eight documented archeological sites within 1.1 km of the project area.
All of these sites, but one, are historic and include four limestone buildings, four
cisterns, a root cellar, and two cemeteries, all of which date to the late nineteenth
or early twentieth century. The only prehistoric site, 41BX933, is within the
survey boundary at the northwest corner of the park. The Atlas shows the site as
being in a residential subdivision that is adjacent to the park, but the site form
indicates that it is within the high-voltage transmission line corridor that forms
the northern edge of the park. The site was revisited by this survey and found to
be in that corridor.
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The Friesenhahn Park project area is near the edge of the Balcones
Escarpment in north-central Bexar County along the boundary between the
Blackland Prairie to the southeast and the Edwards Plateau to the northwest
(Arbingast et al. 1973:6; Griffith et al. 2004; McMahan et al. 1984:Figure 1). This
portion of the Blackland Prairie is characterized by rolling to nearly level tall-grass
plains underlain by soft interbedded marls, chalks, limestones, and shales. The scarp
along the edge of the Edwards Plateau is a rugged dissected landscape of limestone
hills and canyons created by extensive stream downcutting and headward erosion.
According to the Geologic Atlas of Texas (Bureau of Economic Geology 1983), the
project area is mapped as Upper Cretaceous Pecan Gap Chalk; no Holocene alluvium
is mapped in or near the project area. Soils are mapped mostly as Trinity clay, Austin

silty clay, Lewisville silty clay, and Trinity and Frio soils, frequently flooded (Taylor
et al. 1991). Austin soils occur in uplands, while the others are alluvial soils that
occur on terraces and floodplains. These alluvial soils reflect the fact that a small
unnamed stream flows from northwest to southeast through the project area on its
way to Salado Creek 6.5 km to the south-southwest. Vegetation in the park ranges
from a mowed lawn with scattered oak, mesquite, and huisache trees in the developed
northeastern end to dense second-growth woodland with oak, mesquite, hackberry,
and huisache trees and a moderate to thick understory of privet, greenbrier, and
grasses along both north and south sides of the unnamed stream (Figure 2). Tall
grasses mark the course of the stream and its wet and marshy floodplain.
RESULTS OF FILE SEARCH
Review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Archeological Sites Atlas
in October 2018 revealed two previous archeological investigations and seven
documented archeological sites within 1 km of the project area, with one additional
site just a bit farther away. The Atlas shows that the southmost corner of the
current project area was surveyed in 2012 for Bexar County in connection with a
drainage improvement project that extended 0.9 km southwest of the project area.
No sites were found (Dayton 2013). The other previous investigation was a survey
of a residential subdivision 0.4–1.4 km west of the current project area. It was done
in 1984 by the Center for Archaeological Research, The University of Texas at San
Antonio (Cox 1984). Two sites (41BX623 and 41BX624) were recorded.
Site 41BX623, 0.6 km northwest of the project area, is a nineteenth-century
limestone house and associated artifact scatter consisting of ceramics, cut nails, and
glass; archival research indicated it was built in the 1870s. Site 41BX624, 0.9 km
west of the project area, is a partially collapsed limestone building believed to date
to the late nineteenth or early twentieth century. Site 41BX908, 0.4 km north of
the project area, is a historic limestone house and two stone-lined cisterns recorded
in 1990. Site 41BX910, 0.7 km southwest of the project area, is a historic cistern
recorded in 1990. Site 41BX912, 0.5 km west of the project area, is a historic cemetery;
when recorded in 1990, 11 marked graves dating to 1895–1946 were present. Site
41BX933 was recorded in 1990 as a sparse lithic scatter consisting of flakes, bifaces,
Guadalupe gouges, and unidentified dart points; the Atlas shows it as being in a
residential subdivision immediately northwest of Friesenhahn Park, but the site
form indicates that it is within the high-voltage transmission line corridor that
forms the north edge of the park. Site 41BX935, 1.1 km north of the project area,
is a historic cemetery (Tampke Cemetery) that reportedly dates as early as 1877.
Site 41BX951, 0.9 km north of the project area, consists of the remains of a historic
stone house and associated cistern and root cellar that was recorded in 1991.
In addition to review of the Archeological Sites Atlas, the potential for historic
archeological sites was assessed using maps obtained from the Texas Department
of Transportation’s Texas Historic Overlay and historic aerial photographs. None of
the maps and aerials reviewed (1953 USGS map; 1938 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
map; and 1952 and 1963 aerials) depict improvements within the immediate project
area, although the 1938 map does show a now-defunct road passing through it.

METHODS OF FIELD INVESTIGATION
The archeological survey consisted of 100 percent pedestrian coverage of
the 54-acre project area by a team of two archeologists. As per the Texas Historical
Commission’s minimum survey standards, the team walked the project area on
transects spaced no more than 30 m apart examining surface exposures such as
erosional rills, dirt tracks, and pathways for evidence of prehistoric and historic
artifacts and features. The transects were placed on the upland edge north and
south of the stream channel and its wet marshy floodplain. A total of 22 shovel
tests were excavated where the ground surface was obscured by vegetation and in
settings with the potential for buried archeological deposits (Figure 3). This is 5
tests short of the Texas Historical Commission’s standard of 1 test per 2 acres for
project areas of this size, with the shortfall due to the facts that the already developed
northeast part of the park is clearly disturbed and thus does not warrant testing and
a central swath along the small unnamed stream is too wet and marshy for testing.
Five of the tests helped determine the extent and depth of revisited site 41BX933.
Shovel tests were 30 cm in diameter and typically shallow, ranging in depth from
10 to 55 cm with an average of 20 cm, due to the rocky and clayey nature of the
sediments. Sediments removed from the tests were carefully sorted with a trowel,
as they were too clayey and wet to screen. A shovel test record form was used to
record brief sediment descriptions and notes about artifact recovery for each test.
All shovel test locations were recorded with handheld GPS units.
Information concerning the condition and location of revisited site 41BX933
was recorded on a temporary site form so that it could be entered into a site update
form on the TexSite database. In addition, photographs were taken of survey
conditions across the project area and disturbances to 41BX933. A photograph log
and a daily journal of project activities, discoveries, and observations were also kept
by the project archeologists.
RESULTS OF THE SURVEY
The archeological survey of the 54-acre Friesenhahn Park project area
identified no previously unknown sites and revisited one previously record site. The
revisited site, 41BX933, is in the northwest corner of the park in a high-voltage
transmission line corridor that forms the northern edge of the park. The Archeological
Sites Atlas shows the site as being in a residential subdivision that is adjacent to the
park and the transmission line corridor, but the site form states that it was found
within the corridor. This survey found that the site form is correct; the site is in the
transmission line corridor. It is bounded on the north by the housing development
and on the south by the drop-off to the head of the stream that bisects the park. On
the east, it is bounded by the park parking lot off of O’Conner Road. On the west,
it is bounded by a wide drainage ditch the runs from the housing development to
a water tank also at the head of the stream. In a few areas along the ditch, it is
evident that sediment removed from the ditch was spread on either side effectively
burying the original ground surface. So bounded, the site dimensions are 60 m northsouth by 200 m east-west. The site was found by this survey because of an oval ATV
track that provides 100 percent surface visibility within an otherwise grass-covered

corridor (Figure 4a). Scattered primary and secondary lithic reduction flakes were
observed across the surface of the track, but no concentrations of material that
could be considered features were noted. Five shovel tests were placed in the grass
around the edges of the track, and only one test (ARN11) produced two lithic flakes
in Level 1 (0–20 cm). This test was excavated to 45 cm below the surface in a dark
grayish brown loamy clay and was stopped when gravel was encountered. Based on
these observations, the site can be considered a surface or near-surface scatter of

lithic artifacts that may mark the remains of small intermittent camps. Temporally
diagnostic artifacts recovered or observed during the initial site recordation were
noted as dart points and Guadalupe gouges. These tools suggests that the site dates
to the Archaic period of Texas prehistory.
Survey across the remainder of the park, on either side of the central
intermittent stream with its marshy floodplain, noted dark gray clay loam rocky
soils and moderately dense vegetation broken by pathways, erosional features,
and other disturbances that provided 25 percent surface visibility or better,
even within some of the grass-covered areas. On the north side, limestone rock
push-piles are present along the slope to the stream. The dam for the water tank
at the head of the stream is the largest of these disturbances. Several drainage
channels, in addition to the one that bounds the west end of 41BX933, were cut
from the housing development across the highline corridor toward the stream.
Some of these channels are cut to bedrock, which is not more the 30–50 cm below
the surface (Figure 4b). The maintenance road for the highline also provided
good surface exposure along the northwest section of the park. Railroad tracks
and a drainage ditch that follows the length of the railroad mark the southern
edge of the park. Sediment removed from the ditch has been spread into the park
forming a wide low berm along it. Erosional rills cutting downslope from the
berm toward the stream and marshy floodplain also provided surface exposures,
as did animal and human tracks through this part of the park. Modern trash
was noted in these exposures, but no historic or prehistoric materials were
observed. In addition, shovel tests in the more-vegetated areas failed to produce
any cultural materials.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Archeological survey of Friesenhahn Park found no new historic or
prehistoric sites within its boundaries. One previously recorded site was re-located
at its northwest corner. The site, 41BX933, is a prehistoric surface and near-surface
scatter of primary and secondary flakes that may mark intermittent camps situated
on the upland edge overlooking the small stream that bisects the park. Temporally
diagnostic artifacts recovered or observed during the initial site recordation suggest
that the site dates to the Archaic period. The site does not have the capacity to
contribute important information and thus is considered ineligible for listing in
the National Register of Historic Places or designation as a State Antiquities
Landmark. This assessment is based on the following: (1) it is restricted to surface
and near-surface sediments atop a very old landform and thus has no potential for
isolable components; (2) no cultural features were observed in the extensive surface
exposure afforded by the ATV track, suggesting only occasional nonintensive use by
Native Americans; and (3) it has been disturbed by transmission line construction,
excavation of drainage ditches, and ATV use. As no sites were found elsewhere
in the park, it is concluded that the proposed park development will not impact
significant archeological resources, and it is recommended that development can
proceed without additional archeological investigations.
