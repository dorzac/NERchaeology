ABSTRACT
At the request of the South Texas Electric Cooperative (STEC) Burns & McDonnell performed a
Phase I archaeological survey of approximately 42 miles of transmission line corridor in
Atascosa and McMullen Counties, Texas. STEC needed the survey to satisfy the Section 106
requirements of a Corps of Engineers permit. Eighteen archaeological sites and five isolated
finds were recorded during the survey. None of the eighteen archaeological sites are
recommended eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) within the proposed
construction corridor. Nine previously recorded archaeological sites were either in the proposed
right-of-way or were close to the proposed right-of-way. The survey attempted to locate these
sites to determine if they were in the right-of-way even though they had been recommended not
eligible for the NRHP. Four of the nine previously recorded sites were relocated and within the
proposed right-of-way this investigator agrees with the previous evaluation that the sites are not
eligible for the NRHP. No remains of the other five previously recorded sites were found within
the proposed construction right-of-way. It is recommended that the project be allowed to
proceed.

INTRODUCTION

At the request of the South Texas Electric Cooperative (STEC) Burns & McDonnell performed a
Phase I archaeological survey of approximately 42 miles of 345-kV transmission line corridor in
Atascosa and McMullen counties, Texas. The survey is required to satisfy the Section 106
requirements of a Corps of Engineers permit. All work was performed in accordance with the
requirements of the State of Texas and the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines
for Archaeology and Historic Preservation (48 FR 447416-44742), the Secretary’s Standards for
Identification (48 FR 44720-44723).
1.1

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The Project consists of building a new 345-kV transmission line in Atascosa and McMullen
counties, Texas (Project). The Project begins at the existing San Miguel Substation in Atascosa
County and terminates near the McMullen County LaSalle County line. The transmission line is
approximately 42 miles long and traverses the area in a southwest direction (Figure 1-1). It is
currently planned for construction to begin in January 2009 with scheduled completion in May
2010. The construction corridor is expected to be 150-feet wide.
1.2

BACKGROUND RESEARCH

Background research for the Project was conducted online at the Texas Historic Commission
(THC) Texas Atlas website. Twenty-two archaeological sites are in or within ½ mile of the
Project corridor. Table 1-1 was created using the online site forms and by reviewing the online
abstracts and reports. Six of the known sites appear to be bisected by the proposed right-of-way.
Of the six sites two have been recommended not eligible and the recommendation for the other
four is that no further work is needed or required.
A check of historic maps and plats did not reveal historic structures within ¼ mile of the
proposed right-of-way. A similar check of the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
revealed no listed properties within or near the proposed right-of-way. One historic rail line
passes through the area but no evidence of the rail berm was observed during the survey. There
may be historic trails that cross the proposed right-of-way but the scale of the historic maps make
it difficult to be sure. No trails were observed during the survey.

ENVIRONMENT

The Project is located in the south Texas archaeological region. The physiographic zones of
Texas closely mirror the vegetation and archaeology zones with the Texas plains being the
physiographic zone and the vegetation area of the state identified as the Tamaulipan-thorn-scrub
area. This area is typically referred to as the brush country of south Texas. The following is a
discussion of the current and paleo-environment of the Project area.
2.1

SOILS AND CLIMATE

The soils that were encountered during the survey in Atascosa County are described in the Soil
Survey of Atascosa County, Texas a publication of the United States Department of Agriculture
Soil Conservation Service 1977. No soil survey has been undertaken for McMullen County at
the time of this survey. The survey crew did encounter Soil Conservation Service personnel
while doing the archaeological survey and they were in the process of surveying McMullen
County but did not expect to publish their findings until 2010-2011. There were two major soil
types encountered in Atascosa County. They are the Cambellton Series and the Monteola Series.
Both of these soil series are high in salinity and are not considered suitable for agriculture
(USGS/SCS 1977).
The Cambellton Series soils are typically deep, well drained, loamy soils on uplands. The soils
were formed in calcareous loamy and clayey sediment. The A horizon is normally a dark
grayish brown and is approximately 12 inches deep. The B horizon is a grayish brown loam that
extends to approximately 37 inches below and the surface and gradually becomes a gray loam
(USGS/SCS 1977).
The Monteola Series soils are typically deep, moderately well drained, clay soils on uplands.
These soils formed in thick clay and shaly clay. These soils were only encountered in pockets
and even those pockets were rare. It would appear that the Cambellton Series soils are the
predominant soils in the Project area (USGS/SCS 1977).
While it is unknown what the actual soils are in McMullen County, because no soil survey has
been completed for the county, they appear to be much the same as the soils encountered in
Atascosa County with the exception of appearing to contain more caliche and being heavily

2-1

San Miguel Phase I

STEC

eroded over much of the survey area. The areas near permanent or semi-permanent streams held
deeper soils but these all appeared to be loamy soils that were well, to moderately well-drained.
At no point during the survey did the investigator feel that deep testing was warranted based
upon the soils that were observed and because there were always deeply eroded areas within the
right-of-way that could be observed. No cultural material was observed in the cut banks
examined during the survey.
Atascosa County is a nearly level county with a few hilly slopes that run from the southeast to
the northwest. The elevation in the southeastern part of the county is approximately 200 feet
while in the northwester part it is approximately 800 feet. The majority of the drainages flow to
the southeast. The summers are hot averaging 96 degrees and the winters are fairly warm
averaging 55 degrees. Snowfall is rare and the rain fall in the county is heaviest in spring and
early fall. While the average rainfall is 28 inches, in two of every 10 years the rainfall is less
than 5 inches. It is not uncommon for drought to affect the area (USGS/SCS 1977). It is
assumed that the climate and topography is much the same for McMullen County.
In the past, the entire survey area was likely more of a grassland than can be observed today.
Overgrazing and drought are the likely causes of what has led to the invasive brush communities
taking over the landscape. It is likely that areas where landowners have attempted to control the
brush and where grass now grows do approximate the prehistoric environment of the area and
approximate what was observed by the first Europeans that traveled in south Texas (Inglis 1964).
2.2

FAUNA

South central Texas hosts a limited diversity of mammals. They include the opossum, eastern
mole, shrew, bat rabbit, squirrel, plains pocket gopher, mouse, rat beaver, river otter, ninebanded armadillo, and nutria (their taxonomic names can be found in (Porter et al. 2002). Small
carnivores include the raccoon, long-tailed weasel, skunk, badger and fox. Larger carnivores are
the coyote, ocelot, mountain lion, and bobcat. There are also white tailed deer, and collared
peccary in the area. Species that were once in the area but are no longer in the area include the
black bear, red wolf, jaguar, margay, pronghorn and the bison (Porter et al. 2002; Davis and
Schmidly 1994).

2-2

San Miguel Phase I

STEC

Non-indigenous species include feral pigs and exotic species such as axis deer, sika deer, and
blackbuck antelope. The non-indigenous species were brought in for sport hunting and ranching.
The survey crew also observed zebra in one of the high fenced areas (Porter et al. 2002; Davis
and Schmidly 1994).
Reptiles, birds and other wildlife found in the area include wild turkey, bobwhite quail, scaled
quail, waterfowl, crane, and diamond back rattlesnake. Land snails are also common to the area
and were observed throughout the survey. It has been suggested that the snails were a protein
source for prehistoric groups, but this has yet to be proven conclusively (Porter et al. 2002; Davis
and Schmidly 1994; Malof n.d.)
2.3

FLORA

The Project area lies within the South Texas Plains vegetative region of Texas within the
Tamaulipan biotic province. The Tamaulipan biotic province is a hot, semiarid province that
extends into Mexico, and is dominated by thorny brush vegetation. Major species include
mesquite, granjero, clepe, coyotillo, white brush, brasil, cenizo, bisbirinda, afindor, gochnatia,
torchwood, acacia, prickly pear, and sensitive plant (Blair 1950; Correll and Johnson 1979).
In the past, the region was described as short grass rangeland but this has changed over time and
thorny brush now dominates the region. Many attempts have been made to restore the short
grass rangeland and eradicate the thorny brush but most of these efforts have not been successful
over the long run. Root plowing, spraying and bulldozing have been tried and this has in some
cases destroyed surface and subsurface cultural resources. The grasses that are common to the
region but in a minority include seacoast bluestem, silver bluestem, coast sanbur, Arizona
cottontop, curly mesquite, gulf cordgrass, sacaton, Indian grass, switchgrass, grama, crinkle-awn,
bristlegrass, pappusgrass, crowngrass, and windmill grass (Correll and Johnston 1979).
The exception to the observed vegetation is the Briscoe Ranch which was root plowed reportedly
to a depth of 4 feet within the last 10 years (Figure 2-1). During this modification of the
landscape windrows that are approximately 4 to 5 meters wide and 1 to 2 meters tall are evident.
Most of the area surveyed was dominated by acacia, mesquite, and prickly pear. The dominate
species on the rocky uplands with shallow soils was dominated by thick stands of acacia while
the flat uplands with deeper soils was dominated by mesquite and prickly pear.

Prickly pear was dominate only south of the Frio River for approximately ¼-mile in most other
areas mesquite again was the dominate species with prickly pear a close second.

CULTURE HISTORY

The environment diversity of Texas has created a complex and divergent culture history when
the entire state is considered. Because of this diversity the state is divided into physiographic
zones and into archaeological regions. There are 10 physiographic zones and 16 archaeological
regions in the state according to Perttula 2004. This overview of culture history will consider the
Physiographic zone of the South Texas Plains and the archaeological region of south Texas in a
generalized form, as the goal is to demonstrate an understanding of the cultural development of
the locality by reviewing the local sequence within a regional context. Nightengale et al. (1988
and 1989) synthesized previous work in the south Texas region. There are also numerous reports
generated during surveys and testing of the San Miguel Mine and a nine volume report on the
investigations at Choke Canyon Reservoir east of the Project area in McMullen County.
Portions of these reports were used to summarize the culture history of the area along with
Perttula’s 2004 compilation.
The cultural sequence of south Texas is divided into four periods; Paleoindian (9000 to 6000
B.C.), Archaic (6000 B.C. to A.D. 900), Late Prehistoric (A.D. 900 to 1650), and Historic A.D.
(1528 to present). The cultural sequence has further been divided into early, middle, and late
stages for the Archaic period.
3.1

PALEOINDIAN

Although there is some hotly debated evidence that earlier human occupations exist, the earliest
accepted manifestation of the human occupation of North America is considered to be the Clovis
culture. Often labeled big game hunters, these people were highly mobile, roaming in small
bands. Evidence from Aubrey and Lubbock Lake Clovis sites suggest a very diversified
subsistence base for the paleoindian culture. Some of the identified faunal assemblage at these
sites include; fish, box turtle, water snake, alligator, bird shrew, eastern mole, rabbit, prairie dog,
squirrel mouse, rat, canid, mammoth, horse and white tailed deer (Perttula 2004). Clovis points
have been securely dated to 11,200-10.900 years Before Present (BP), particularly in the
southwestern United States (Southwest) and the plains states (Plains).
Recent discoveries that suggest Pre-Clovis occupations occurred in the Americas perhaps as
early as 30,000 BP. Archaeological sites attributed to the Pre-Clovis horizon that show promise
3-1

San Miguel Phase I

STEC

of containing Pre-Clovis evidence include Monte Verde, Chile (Dillehay 1984:100-109; Quivira
and Dillehay 1988:177-191); Meadowcroft Rockshelter, Pennsylvania (Adovasio et al.
1983:163-189); Pendejo Cave, New Mexico (Chrisman et al. 1996:357-376); Selby/Dutton and
Lamb Springs, Colorado (Stanford 1979; Stanford et al. 1981); the Big Eddy Site, Missouri (Ray
1998); the Topper Site, South Carolina (Goodyear 2005); and Shriver, Missouri (Reagan et al.
1978). These sites are, in most cases, controversial and have yet to be fully accepted by the
professional community as evidence for a Pre-Clovis occupation.
The most diagnostic artifact of the Paleoindian period is the characteristic fluted point. Other
identified stone tools include end scrapers, large unifacial side scrapers, keeled scrapers on large
blades, flake knives, some back (dulled on one edge) worked blades, gravers and perforators,
bone points, foreshafts, shaft straighteners, and atlatls (Wormington1957; Lahren and
Bonnichsen 1974; Frison and Zeimens 1980; Hofman and Graham 1998; Blackmar and Hofman
2006; Harrington 1971; Baker and Kidder 1937; Perttula 2004). Textiles, wood, and bone have
been identified in sites with optimal preservation.
The Clovis culture is followed by the Folsom which in turn is followed by time diagnostic stone
tools such as Plainview, Scottsbluff, Golondrina, and Angostura projectile points. These
Paleoindian cultures followed Clovis but their subsistence pattern remained essentially the same.
In the Project area paleoindian is reflected in surface finds from several sites and there is an
abundance of paleoindian artifacts in the hands of local collectors who collect along San Miguel
Creek (Hester 1968). Paleoindian surface finds have been documented during surveys for the
San Miguel lignite mine and during the surveys of Choke Canyon which is east of the current
Project area (Robinson et al. 1992).
3.2

EARLY ARCHAIC

In south Texas, the Early Archaic is an ill-defined period in cultural development. Although
there are sites such as the Richard Beene (41BX831) site and 41LK51 at Choke Canyon which
have been dated to the Early Archaic very little is known about the subsistence or settlement
pattern. Story (1985) speculated that the Early Archaic was a time of population decline in south
Texas because of dryer and warmer conditions. Holloway (1996) suggests the climate was
relatively stable. Both views or only one may be true but too little is known to be sure. The

3-2

San Miguel Phase I

STEC

Early Archaic is also a time when the subsistence patterns would have had to change due to the
extinction of the megafauna causing the people to modify their hunting and gathering strategies.
Lanceolate projectile points were replaced by dart point styles such as Andice and Bell (Calf
Creek horizon) Bandy, and Early Triangular. Distally beveled tools such as Clear Fork and
Guadalupe are also present.
3.3

MIDDLE ARCHAIC PERIOD

The Middle Archaic is characterize by increasing population, cemeteries, increased reliance on
vegetative matter, and possibly territorialism. Settlement patterns gathered at Choke Canyon and
Chaparrosa and at East Chacon (McGraw and Knepper 1983) seem to make a case for open
camps to be near streams or rivers (Perttula 2004). It appears that they also moved toward
utilizing the beans and nuts of the mesquite, acacia, oak, and hackberry and groundstone tools
are common. There is also an increase in burnt rock features that were likely used as ovens or
hearths. The presence of cemeteries in the Middle Archaic led Story (1985) to speculate that
territorialism was a part of the Middle Archaic. Burial goods included tabular stone pipes and
small pieces of unmodified sandstone. Tortugas and Abasolo triangular projectile points
dominate but stemmed varieties are also in the tool kit (Perttula 2004; Robinson et al. 1992).
3.4

LATE ARCHAIC PERIOD

The Late Archaic tool kit included stemmed projectile points or dart points such as Ensor, Ellis,
Frio, Marcos and Fairland along with triangular points. They tended to settle or leave evidence
of camps in all of the environments niches. This would seem to indicate an expansion of their
exploitation of the environment. Metates and manos are common as are extensive deposits of
fire cracked rock indicating a greater reliance on mesquite and acacia beans. Evidence at some
sites indicate an increased reliance on mussels and increased gathering of ground snails. Small
animals, snakes, and lizards along with deer were exploited. There are also indications of
increased trade as evidenced by a cache of fifty Edwards chert bifaces found in Frio county
(Perttula 2004; Hester and Barber 1990).
3.5

LATE PREHISTORIC

The settlement pattern of the Late Prehistoric again changes as reported in Choke Canyon and
Zavala County, with the preference being major stream channels and tributaries along natural
3-3

San Miguel Phase I

STEC

levees (Hall et al. 1986; Hester 1978; Perttula 2004). The period is most known for the
introduction of the bow and arrow and pottery (Ricklis 1995). There is a change in the tool kit
and subsistence pattern and an increase in the faunal remains from a variety of species (Black
1995; Black 1989b). Late prehistoric sites in south central Texas typically yield Edwards,
Scallorn, and Perdiz projectile points (Ricklis 1995) Sites excavated during the Choke Canyon
investigations revealed several sites with bone tempered pottery (Black 1989b).
3.6

PROTOHISTORIC

The Protohistoric can be defined as a period in prehistory that was a transition period between
the prehistoric and historic periods when there are some European trade goods and influence but
not enough to really change the economy of the prehistoric people. In south Texas, this period
can be said to begin after Cabeza de Vaca’s shipwreck in the 1600s, while not having a
noticeable lasting effect on the prehistoric cultures it did introduce European diseases that would
devastate the population of the local cultures in the 1800s. There are few if any written records
of this period but it is a period that is important to our understanding of the cultures of south
Texas (Perttula 2004).
3.7

HISTORIC

The discussion of the historic period in this report will focus on the history of Atascosa and
McMullen Counties since they are the two counties traversed by the current project.
3.7.1 Atascosa County
A comprehensive history of Atascosa County is presented by Robinson et al. 1992. A summary
of that and other resources is presented for this report. Atascosa County was first visited by
Europeans in the 17th and 18th centuries. Two of the earliest trade and exploration routes in
Atascosa County are the El Camino Real and Laredo Road, while the earliest know reference to
the general area may be by Aloso de Leon in 1689 when he crossed what is today known as the
Atascosa River near Christine, Texas. It is also believed that the Espinosa, Olivares, Aguirre
Expedition may have traveled through the northern portion of Atascosa County (Robinson et al.
1992).

3-4

San Miguel Phase I

STEC

By the mid 18th century most of the county was dominated by the missions of San Jose y Miguel
de Aguayo and San Franscisco del la Espada. One of the mission ranches is pertinent to this
Project study area. The mission ranch was the Rancho de San Miguel located in southwestern
Atascosa County or near the Loredo Road crossing of San Miguel Creek near Franklin (which is
in northern McMullen County).
By 1794, the era of the missions was coming to an end and mission lands were claimed by early
settlers. One such settler was Lt. Col. Ygnacio Perez and one of his corrals was on San Miguel
Creek. These corrals were used to round up cattle, horses, and sheep. By the 1820s more and
more settlers were granted large tracts of land in Atascosa County with over 75,000 acres of
grants being made however, settlement remained sparse until the 1850s. Many of these
Spanish/Mexican grants were disallowed by the Republic of Texas who confiscated the land and
granted them to Anglo-American settlers.
The county of Atascosa was legally formed in 1855 by the Sixth Legislature of the State of
Texas. By the 1860s Atascosa was a target of Indian raids because of the success of the residents
in raising cattle. Raids by the Kickapoo in 1865 and 1873 are said to have forced most residents
into San Antonio. Cattle ranching, as it is today, became even more active after the Civil War.
One example is from 1873 when 43,000 longhorn cattle were gathered near Pleasanton, Texas
and driven to the northern markets.
In 1881 the Great Northern Railroad entered the county followed by the Artesian Belt Railroad
in 1908 and the San Antonio, Uvalde & Gulf Railroad in 1912. Many of the towns in Atascosa
County sprang up along these rail lines. These rail lines made cattle drives to the north
impractical. Ranching continues to be important to the economy of the County with large
numbers of cattle being produced by the area ranches. Many of the ranches are long lived and
there are at least 14 on the Department of Agriculture’s Family Land Heritage Program list
which honors those families who have owned and operated their ranches for at least 100 years.
3.7.2 McMullen County
In many ways McMullen Counties history parallels the history of Atascosa County and in fact
the county was formed by parts of Bexar, Live Oak and Atascosa Counties in 1858. According
to Smelley (http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~txmcmull/history/countyhistory.htm) and
3-5

San Miguel Phase I

STEC

Leffler (http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/MM/hcm9.html) and Hester 1980
the county was named for John McMullen, an Irish Empresario.
Leffler quotes “In 1825 the Mexican state of Coahuila granted a colonization contract to
Benjamin Drake Lovell” and John G. Purnell for a tract of land that included all of present-day
McMullen County north of the Nueces River. In 1828, after Lovell and Purnell had failed to
fulfill the terms of their contract, the same land was assigned to John McMullen and James
McGloin, who contracted to settle the area with 200 Catholic immigrants. By 1835 the Mexican
government had issued perhaps fifteen grants of land in the area of present McMullen County to
colonists associated with the McMullen-McGloin project. None of these grantees actually
settled on the land assigned to them, however. By 1836, when Texas seceded from Mexico, the
area remained populated almost entirely by the Indian bands that roamed through the area.
While there were Spanish holdings in the county in the early 1800s, few if any settlers other than
outlaws and thieves lived in the county north of the Nueces River until the towns of Yarbrough
Bend and Rio Frio were established. The first town established in McMullen County was
Yarbrough Bend in the Northeastern part the county along the Frio River in 1858. Another
settlement called Rio Frio was established the same year as Yarbrough Bend. This community
was approximately 10 miles west of Yarbrough Bend at the confluence of Leoncita Creek and
the Frio River. Rio Frio would later become Dogtown then Colfax and finally Tilden. Tilden
remains the only town and the county seat of McMullen County.
While raising sheep was important in McMullen County in the past by 1887 there were only
37,000 sheep in the county due to drought, a drop in wool prices, and overgrazing. By the turn
of the century the county was dominated by ranching. In the early 1900s, the oil and gas
industry started to play an important part in McMullen County’s economy. While in the past
agriculture has played an important part in McMullen County economics, it is today mostly in
the northeast part of the county with cattle ranching being the dominate part of the county’s
income. The county remains sparsely populated today with the 2000 census reporting only 851
residence. The people of McMullen County appear to be fiercely independent ranchers and
farmers who cherish their isolation and heritage.

METHODS

The research design used for the proposed construction of a 345-kV transmission line for the
STEC San Miguel-Lobo line in Atascosa and McMullen County, Texas is simple but thorough.
The research design was guided by the diverse, yet interrelated, variables that are inherent in the
practice of cultural resource management. These variables include contract requirements and
objectives as outlined in the scope of work, topographic and vegetational conditions in the study
area, and the level of the proposed effort. The present cultural resources investigation, using
NRHP criteria of significance, focused on the location and preliminary assessment of all cultural
resources found within the Project areas. The level of effort used on this project is typically
referred to as a cultural resources inventory survey with preliminary NRHP site evaluation or a
Phase I survey.
4.1

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE DEFINITION

Archaeological sites are the most difficult spatial units for archaeologists to define. A cultural
site may be defined as “a spatial cluster of cultural features, or items, or both” (Binford 1972:46).
This definition applies to both prehistoric and historic sites. Archaeological context may be
defined by the inclusion of any of the following: soil staining, associated fire-cracked rock,
ceramics, features, or a concentration of materials within a reasonably defined spatial boundary.
The term “archaeological site” has been defined by Willey and Phillips (1958:18) as any
reasonably definable spatial unit that contains features or is fairly continuously covered with
artifacts that are indicative of an occupation fifty years or older.
Other studies of spatial units have concentrated on siteless surveys, recording human occupation
of a landscape by the residue left behind (Dancey 1973; Dunnell 1971; Ebert 1992; Dent 1995).
These researchers view sites as “inherently unreliable units of observation and analysis”
(Wandsnider 1998). Sites are viewed only as peaks of concentration across the cultural
landscape. Site archaeology is often viewed by some anthropologists/archaeologists, Native
Americans, and other interested parties as purely arbitrary boundaries of artifact density imposed
upon the landscape to allow archaeologists and state and Federal agencies to manage the modern
landscape more efficiently.

4-1

San Miguel Phase I

STEC

Researchers at Burns & McDonnell are aware of the inaccuracies inherent in the arbitrary
boundaries of site archaeology; however, the need for boundaries around residue of past
occupations are necessary to evaluate these depleting resources based on the criteria of the
NRHP. Thus, as a general rule for this Project, prehistoric and historic components are not
identified as sites unless they had two or more artifacts, or the presence of at least one surface
feature over 50 years old. Those spatial units that contain fewer than the allotted artifacts are
identified as isolated finds or site leads. Isolated finds are recorded in much the same manner as
sites, but are judged to be isolated based on artifact density and diversity, soil stratigraphy,
ground surface visibility, or evidence of disturbance.
For this Project, site boundaries were defined using variety of means, with the most common
being the lack of artifacts or features in areas with ground surface visibility above 50 percent.
Other means of defining site boundaries included steep slopes exceeding 20 degrees, streams,
and/or areas of extensive disturbance. A combination of these criteria may have defined a site
boundary.
4.2

FIELD METHODS

A variety of field methods were employed during the cultural resources survey. These methods
were designed to identify all cultural resources and obtain data needed to identify age, function,
and other characteristics of each site investigated. This approach provided information on
artifact density and distribution across each site and was used to infer feature types and activity
areas. The survey crew also relied on those landowners who were willing to provide additional
information about the sites on their property.
For this survey pedestrian transects were walked in a zigzag pattern at approximately 30-meter
intervals. Those intervals were reduced to five meters when a site or an isolated find was
encountered and at the discretion of the Principal Investigator (PI) were again reduced to two
meters on some of the sites. Shovel test were excavated on the site if there was any indication of
soils being present to determine the depth of the cultural deposit and the depth of the soils. No
collections were made on the majority of the sites at the request or demand of the landowners. In
many cases the survey crews were confined to the proposed right-of-way or Area of Potential
Effect (APE) which is 150 feet wide. In those cases, the survey crews used the terrain or other

4-2

San Miguel Phase I

STEC

natural barriers to estimate the extent of the site if that was possible. Only two artifacts were
collected during the survey and both will be returned to the appropriate landowners as soon as
practical.
One property near Highway 16 in the northern part of the survey area was not surveyed because
no access was granted by the landowner and will not be surveyed as it is considered to have a
low probability for containing cultural material. Near the southern end of the survey there was
extensive ground disturbance documented on the aerial photographs and further documented by
the land agent in communication with the landowner. This property is the Briscoe Ranch where
only areas near water sources were surveyed because of the prior disturbance and because most
of the ranch has a low probability for containing cultural resources. The areas surveyed are
depicted in Appendix A and low probability areas that were not surveyed are also depicted.

SURVEY RESULTS

Eighteen archaeological sites were recorded during the Phase I survey of the Project area. All of
the sites were prehistoric with no historic sites being encountered. There were also five isolated
finds which were also all prehistoric. No trails or historic rail berms were encountered during
the survey. Only two artifacts were collected because the landowners were very united in their
desire to not have anything taken off of their property. Even the two that were collected will be
returned to the landowners as soon as it is practical. The landowners were equally united in their
desire to confine the survey crew to the proposed right-of-way. This did not allow the survey
crew to determine site limits on many of the sites but when possible estimates based upon terrain
and observed disturbances were used to approximate the site limits. Diagnostics or sample
artifacts observed during the survey were photographed in the field. Because we did not know
the landowners would not allow collection before we went to the field, the survey crews used
expedient methods to provide scale when a scale was not available. The following sections will
discuss each archaeological site and each isolated find.

end of the site were positive. The positive tests produced material within the disturbed first 10
centimeters with the exception of a secondary flake found in a krotovina. All other shovel tests
were negative.
5.1.4 Artifacts
A thin scatter of a dozen primary and secondary cobble flakes with one tested cobble. One
subsurface secondary cobble flake between 11 and 23 centimeters in a krotovina, and two other
flakes in shovel tests that were less than 10 centimeters below the disturbed surface and both
were secondary flakes.
5.1.5

Horizontal and Vertical Extent of Cultural Deposit

The site appears to be confined to the surface. Although one flake in a krotovina was found
during shovel testing the other positive shovel tests only produced two secondary flakes within
the first 10 centimeters of the disturbed surface. Erosion and rodent activity could easily account
for the shallow deposits. None of the other shovel tests were positive.
5.1.6 Site Integrity
Site does not appear to retain its integrity due to root plowing, rodent burrowing, and erosion.
No subsurface features were observed.
5.1.7 Site Function
The thin scatter and the low density and diversity of artifacts would appear to indicate a
temporary camp.
5.1.8 Cultural Affiliation
The site is considered to be an unknown prehistoric occupation.

Summary Data
Site Type: Lithic scatter.
Component: Unknown Prehistoric.
Site Location: UTM Zone 14 easting 544870 northing 3168600.
Approximate Site Area: 12,500 square meters.
Topography: Gently sloping terrain.
Elevation: 330 to 340 feet (Above Mean Sea Level) AMSL
Soil Series: No soil survey available for McMullen County, cobbles and thin soils on
eroded landscape.
Nearest Water: 300 meters west of Jarita Creek.
Survey Method: 30-meter survey transects reduced to five meter transects on the site.
Site Condition: Site is confined to an eroded cobble surface with little or no soil deposition
and has been previously disturbed by root plowing, fence, and road construction, and
erosion.
5.2.1 Description
Site is on terrain that is gently sloping to the east toward Jarita Creek (Appendix A and B). The
area has been heavily eroded with cobbles exposed at the surface. Mesquite, acacia, and prickly
pear dominate the vegetation but it is sparse over most of the site with small dense areas
(Photograph 5-3). A few widely scattered artifacts were found over a large area. Because of the
exposed cobbles and obvious heavy erosion no shovel tests were excavated.
5.2.2 Previous Investigations
No previous investigations have been done in this area.
5.2.3 Current Investigation
The current investigation was confined to the 150-foot-wide right-of-way corridor at the
landowner’s request. The site may extend either east or west but that could not be determined
with the restrictions placed upon the survey. The site was discovered while walking 30-meter
pedestrian transects within the right-of-way. These transects were reduced to five meters in an
effort to define the site area. Observation of the conditions outside the right-of-way would seem
to indicate that the eroded terrain observed in the right-of-way extends both to the east and west.
No shovel tests were excavated because of the obvious lack of soil deposition.

5.2.4 Artifacts
The artifacts were sparse on the landscape with only seven primary and secondary cobble flakes
and two tested cobbles observed within the right-of-way. No other cultural material and no
features were observed.
5.2.5 Horizontal and Vertical Extent of Cultural Deposit
The horizontal extent of the site appears to be approximately 250 meters along the proposed
right-of-way and is confined to the highly eroded cobble strewn surface. The site may extend to
the east and the west but the survey was confined to the proposed right-of-way by the landowner.
5.2.6 Site Integrity
Site does not appear to retain its integrity in the right-of-way and represents a deflated lithic
scatter. The site may retain integrity outside the right-of-way but observations of the areas to the
east and west from the right-of-way would seem to indicate that the terrain remains much the
same.
5.2.7 Site Function
The site appears to be a lithic procurement area that was not heavily used.

Summary Data
Site Type: Lithic scatter.
Component: Unknown Prehistoric.
Site Location: UTM Zone 14 easting 544870 northing 3166587.
Approximate Site Area: 10,000 square meters.
Topography: Level with disturbances from gravel borrow.
Elevation: 320 feet (Above Mean Sea Level) AMSL.
Soil Series: No soil survey available for McMullen County, sandy loam with heavy biomass
to 15 centimeters, sandy loam to 38 centimeters, compact gravel and sand below 38
centimeters.
Nearest Water: Large pond or tank 250 meters East.
Survey Method: 30-meter survey transects reduced to five meter transects on the site
supplemented with shovel tests.
Site Condition: Site has been 80 percent destroyed by gravel borrow. Only a few pockets
of soil remain mostly within 50 meters north and south of RR791. The remainder of the
site may contain intact deposits but has been impacted by road, borrow, root plowing and
erosion.

5.3.1 Description
The site is on nearly level terrain with the only relief provided by intrusive activities such as road
construction and a gravel borrow area (Appendix A and B). It appears that most of the site has
been destroyed but some of it may be intact within 10 meters north and south of RR791
(Photograph 5-4). Shovel tests within this area indicated approximately 40 centimeters of sandy
loam over a dense gravel and sand layer. Secondary cobble flakes were discovered up to 38
centimeters below the surface. The rest of the site had been destroyed by the gravel borrow area.

5.3.2 Previous Investigations
Background research did not indicate any previous investigations of this area.
5.3.3 Current Investigation
The current investigation was of the proposed 150-foot-wide right-of-way proposed for a
transmission line. Thirty meter pedestrian transects were walked within the right-of-way and
these were reduced to five meter transects upon discovery of the site. Shovel testing was
confined to the relatively undisturbed portion of the site. Most of the area had been heavily
impacted by gravel borrow activities and road construction. It is estimated that approximately 80
percent of the site has been destroyed by these previous activities.
5.3.4 Artifacts
The site is a light to moderate lithic scatter on the surface. Primary and secondary cobble flakes
and a few tested cobbles were observed. No collections were made because of the landowner’s
request. Shovel testing within the areas that appeared to be intact revealed a moderate density of
tan, red, and banded secondary flakes scattered throughout the matrix to 38 centimeters. No
features were encountered. No diagnostic artifacts were observed on the site.
5.3.5 Horizontal and Vertical Extent of Cultural Deposit
Shovel testing on the areas that appeared to retain their integrity indicated that cultural deposits
are confined to the first 40 centimeters of the landscape. Below 40 centimeters the soils are a
compact gravel and sand. The intact portions of the site appears to be a narrow band

5-7

San Miguel Phase I

STEC

approximately 25 to 30-meters wide within the proposed right-of-way 10 to 15 meters north and
south of RR791. Gravel borrow and road construction have destroyed the remainder of the site.
5.3.6

Site Integrity

The site has been impacted by a gravel borrow area and road construction. Only a small portion
of the site appears to be intact. Site integrity would appear to be fair to poor.
5.3.7 Site Function
41MC475 appears to have been a lithic procurement area and possibly a campsite.
5.3.8 Cultural Affiliation
Because no diagnostics were found during the survey the site is classified as unknown
prehistoric.
5.3.9 Recommendation
A revisit to the site in February 2009 revealed that the landowner had done more gravel mining
on his own without STEC’s knowledge. Excavation of gate posts near RR791 were monitored to
determine if the site was intact at the edge of the TXDOT right-of-way. Rebar was excavated at
approximately 4 feet in one of the post holes making it highly unlikely that any of this site
remains intact. The site appears to have been completely destroyed by gravel mining and road
construction.

Site Type: Lithic scatter.
Component: Unknown Prehistoric/Archaic?
Site Location: UTM Zone 14 easting 534380northing 3157310.
Approximate Site Area: 5,000 square meters.
Topography: Upland site with shallow soils and dense vegetation that is nearly level.
Elevation: 330 feet (Above Mean Sea Level) AMSL.
Soil Series: No soil survey available for McMullen County, shallow sandy loam.
Nearest Water: 130-meters southwest to an unnamed intermittent stream.
Survey Method: 30-meter survey transects reduced to 2 meter transects on the site.
Site Condition: The site is nearly level on thin sandy loam soils with dense mesquite, acacia
and prickly pear. The landowner who has lived there for over 70 years indicated that the
site was root plowed 40 years ago. Currently the site has been impacted by fence and ranch
road construction. Shovel tests revealed a thin (less than 10 centimeter) rooty sandy loam
over a dense sandy clay. There is little deposition and all of the artifacts were observed on
the surface. The landowner accompanied the survey crew and would not allow the crew to
survey outside the proposed right-of-way and did not allow artifacts to be collected. The
site has been impacted by erosion, ranch road construction, root plowing and cattle
ranching.

5.8.1 Description
41MC480 is on nearly level terrain above an unnamed intermittent stream that may have had
permanent water in the past (Appendix A and B). The landowner indicated that many projectile
points had been collected over the years but did not allow the crew to see the collection. The
owner did not say whether or not projectile points had been collected on this site or if they were
from other areas of the property. The site was initially found on the ranch road that parallels the
boundary fence of the property. Some artifacts were observed in the dense mesquite, acacia and
prickly pear that abuts the road to the northwest. Shovel tests indicated a root filled sandy loam
of less than 10 centimeters with a dense sandy clay following. No artifacts were observed in the
shovel tests, which were all negative, for cultural material.

The site may extend to the northwest and southeast but the crew were confined to the proposed
right-of-way.
5.8.2 Previous Investigations
Background research indicated that this area has not been previously surveyed.
5.8.3 Current Investigation
The site was found during a pedestrian survey of the proposed 150-foot-wide corridor. This
corridor was surveyed in 30-meter transects which were reduced to five meters upon discovery
of the site.
5.8.4 Artifacts
A thin scatter of primary and secondary flakes numbering less than twenty was observed but not
collected while on the site. All of the flakes appeared to be from the local cobble chert and were
tan, reddish and banded cherts.
5.8.5 Horizontal and Vertical Extent of Cultural Deposit
On this site it appears that the cultural material is confined to the surface in a scatter that extends
throughout the width of the right-of-way and may extend northwest and southeast outside the
right-of-way.
5.8.6 Site Integrity
The site appears to be confined to the surface and with the reported root plowing, erosion, road
and fence building it is unlikely that the site retains its integrity within the proposed right-ofway.
5.8.7 Site Function
The site is a light lithic scatter and may represent either a procurement area or a campsite.
5.8.8 Cultural Affiliation
No diagnostic artifacts were found during the survey; therefore the site is classified as unknown

Site Type: Lithic scatter.
Component: Middle Archaic.
Site Location: UTM Zone 14 easting 531845 northing 3155897.
Approximate Site Area: 20,000 square meters.
Topography: Site is on nearly level terrain on the east side of the headwaters of Leoncita
Creek.
Elevation: 320-330 feet (Above Mean Sea Level) AMSL.
Soil Series: No soil survey available for McMullen County, sandy loam soils to 40
centimeters followed by dense sandy clay mixed with gravel.
Nearest Water: 130-meters southwest to an unnamed intermittent stream.
Survey Method: 30-meter survey transects reduced to 2 meter transects on the site.
Site Condition: The site is on nearly level terrain that has been root plowed and cleared by
bulldozer in the last ten years according to the landowner Mr. Hundley. Mr. Hundley
accompanied the survey crew and required us to remain within the proposed right-of-way.
The vegetation is sparse within the right-of-way and heavily eroded with large open spaces
of eroded bare ground with exposed cobbles and gravel. There were clumps of mesquite
and prickly pears but acacia was sparse. Little or no grass covered the ground offering
excellent ground visibility. The site has been adversely affected by root plowing, road
construction, fence construction, cattle ranching and erosion.

5.9.1 Description
The site is on eroded terrain with sparse vegetation and likely extends outside the proposed rightof-way (Appendix A and B). Mr. Hundley the landowner talked of burn rock concentrations, fire
hearths and many projectile points in the area. He did not allow us to view the projectile points
or any of the features he described. The landowner further stated that the root plowing, road
construction, bulldozing and clearing for fence construction had essentially destroyed the
features he had told us about. Within the right-of-way shovel testing indicated that there was 40
centimeters of sandy loam over a dense sandy clay. No artifacts were found during shovel
testing but this may be a sampling error. We did not observe any burnt rock or hearth features
within the proposed right-of-way. The scatter of lithics and tools extended from approximately

5.9.4 Artifacts
The entire site area contained a moderate scatter of primary and secondary cobble chert flakes
and a few tested cores. Some of the flakes appear to have been utilized as expedient tools. A
Tortuga projectile point and a broken triangular biface that may have been a knife or a projectile
point were the only formal tools that were observed. Mr. Hundley indicated that he had collected
many projectile points from this area but did not allow us to observe his collection. All of the
artifacts appeared to be from the local cobble cherts with some showing indications of thermal
alteration (Photograph 5-13 and 5-14).

All of the observed artifacts were on the surface but shovel testing indicated that soils capable of
containing cultural material extend to at least 40 centimeters below the surface. Given the report
of the landowner the site likely extends beyond the proposed right-of-way to the northwest and
southeast. Also based upon the landowners report it is possible that there are cultural features on

recorded by this survey on Mr. Hundley’s adjacent property. The brush is more dense on
this side of the headwaters of Leoncita Creek but still afforded excellent ground surface
visibility that ranged from 50 to 100 percent. The site has been impacted by road and fence
construction and like many of the properties has been root plowed in the past. The site has
also been impacted by cattle with numerous trails throughout the site. Erosion of the site
was evident with small washes throughout the site area. The owner did not allow collection
and limited the survey crew to the proposed right-of-way.

5.10.4 Artifacts
A moderate to dense lithic scatter of primary, secondary and tertiary flakes were observed on the
surface with some eroded areas having more flakes exposed (Photograph 5-16). There were also
numerous tested cobbles, a Tortugas projectile point, a triangular projectile point/knife, broken
biface fragments, utilized flakes both uniface and biface. All of the flakes and tools appear to
have been made using the local cobble cherts. Some of the flakes appeared to have been
thermally altered.

5.10.5 Horizontal and Vertical Extent of Cultural Deposit
The survey was confined to the proposed right-of-way and the site extended southwest for 300
meters and was 50 meters wide. Shovel testing revealed flakes and cobbles to 20 centimeters
and sandy loam soils to 35 centimeters.
5.10.6 Site Integrity
Although the site has been adversely affected by root plowing, road construction, fence building,
cattle, and erosion it is possible that there are buried features and there may be exposed features
outside the limits of our survey. Site integrity is estimated to be fair.
5.10.7 Site Function
Site appears to be a large multiple occupation campsite and procurement area.
5.10.8 Cultural Affiliation
The presence of a Tortugas projectile point indicates a Middle Archaic occupation but further
investigation of the site may reveal other occupations.
5.10.9 Recommendation
The portion of the site within the APE is recommended as not significant but the site has not
been fully accessed because the survey was confined to the APE.

Component: Unknown Prehistoric.
Site Location: UTM Zone 14 easting 529491 northing 3153254.
Approximate Site Area: 18,000 square meters.
Topography: Site is on a small hill in the uplands near an unnamed headwater tributary of
Rockaway Creek.
Elevation: 330-350 feet (Above Mean Sea Level) AMSL.
Soil Series: No soil survey available for McMullen County, a cobble strewn eroded
landform with little or no soil deposition.
Nearest Water: 150 meters southwest to an unnamed intermittent headwater tributary of
Rockaway Creek.
Survey Method: 30-meter survey transects reduced to 2 meter transects on the site.

San Miguel Phase I

STEC

Site Condition: The site is on a heavily eroded hillside with a large tank to the east and the
headwaters of Rockaway Creek to the southwest. Vegetation is sparse in mesquite, acacia,
and prickly pears with little or no grass. Ground surface visibility is excellent on this site
but there is little or no soil deposition. No features were observed during the survey.

5.11.1 Description
The site is a thin scatter of primary and secondary flakes and tested cobbles over a large area of a
cobble strewn hillside (Appendix A and B). There is no evidence of any soil deposition beyond
what has collected around the base of the mesquite and acacia. Flakes were widely scattered as
were the cobbles and only one biface perform was found during the survey. A rocky clay loam
is at the surface and shovel testing was not done after attempting and abandoning the effort.
Most of the flakes were found in the road that parallels the fence and it is possible that some of
those may have been created by clearing and construction of the road and fence. Other flakes
and tested cobbles were found outside the construction disturbance and appeared to be the same
as those found in the roadway (Photograph 5-18 and 5-19).

corridor was surveyed in 30-meter transects which were reduced to five meters upon discovery
of the site.
5.11.4 Artifacts
Primary and secondary flakes of cobble chert and tested cobbles were observed on the site in a
thin scatter. All of the flakes appeared to be from the local cobble chert. One biface perform of
tan chert was found with some of the cobble cortex visible on one side of the perform. No
formal or informal tools other than the perform were found.
5.11.5 Horizontal and Vertical Extent of Cultural Deposit
The site is a lithic scatter over a large area but is confined to the surface on this deflated eroded
landform.
5.11.6 Site Integrity
The site does not appear to retain its integrity due to erosion, road and fence construction and
ranching activities.
5.11.7 Site Function
The site appears to be a lithic procurement area with a light lithic scatter over a large area.

Summary Data
Site Type: Lithic scatter.
Component: Unknown Prehistoric.
Site Location: UTM Zone 14 easting 528813 northing 3152618.
Approximate Site Area: 240,000 square meters.
Topography: Site is on gently sloping terrain in the uplands near unnamed headwater
tributaries of Rockaway Creek.
Elevation: 310-330 feet (Above Mean Sea Level) AMSL.
Soil Series: No soil survey available for McMullen County, a cobble strewn eroded
landform with little or no soil deposition the thin soils present were sandy loam.
Nearest Water: Two unnamed tributaries of Rockaway creek go through the site on the
east and west.
Survey Method: 30-meter survey transects reduced to 2 meter transects on the site.
Site Condition: The site is an eroded landform that has been root plowed and now has
sparse grass growing on the thin soils. Shovel testing was tried but abandoned due to the
dense cobble and rock. A few sparsely scattered mesquite, acacia and prickly pear were
observed. The site also has a road and a fence bisecting the site from east to west. Cattle
trails were also observed.

5.12.1 Description
This site like the ones observed near San Miguel Creek during this survey appears to be a large
lithic procurement area that was likely revisited on a regular basis for hundreds of years
(Appendix A and B). One seemingly unique observation at this site was that they seemed to
prefer a tan cobble chert over other colors with approximately 70 percent of the artifacts being
made from this cobble chert. The site is heavily eroded with little or no soil deposition. Shovel
tests were attempted but abandoned because of the dense rock, cobble, and gravels that were
encountered. There is also a road and fence with a wide cleared area that bisects the site. No
diagnostic artifacts were observed during the survey (Photograph 5-20).

mesquite, acacia and prickly pear along with some sparse grasses. All of the artifacts were
confined to the surface.

5.17.1 Description
The site is located between two drainages on a small knoll (Appendix A and B). The soils are a
loamy sand that is compact and extends to 40 centimeters below the surface. No artifacts were
found below the surface. Push piles and a double cleared lane and road were dominate. The site
may extend outside the proposed right-of-way but the landowner did not grant permission to

5.18.1 Description
The site is a sparse lithic scatter between two unnamed tributaries of the Frio River (Appendix A
and B). Shovel testing on the site outside the road and fence construction which takes up most of
the proposed right-of-way revealed a compact silt loam to 35 centimeters with some gravels
mixed in the matrix (Photograph 5-26 and 5-27). No artifacts were observed in the shovel tests.
The landowner accompanied the survey crew and indicated that the area floods rather frequently
and that he had found arrowheads on the property. He declined to allow the survey crew outside
the proposed right-of-way and also declined to show the crew his collected artifacts. Only one
flake was observed below the surface in a rodent burrow at eight centimeters below the surface
but could have easily washed in or eroded into the burrow. All of the rest of the artifacts
observed were on the surface and appeared to be cobble cherts. The site may extend outside the
right-of-way to the west but no investigations were done in this area (Photograph 5-26 and 5-27).

The site was found during a pedestrian survey of the proposed 150-foot-wide corridor. This
corridor was surveyed in 30-meter transects which were reduced to five meters upon discovery
of the site.
5.18.4 Artifacts
The artifacts consisted of approximately 18 primary and secondary chert cobble flakes. A few of
the flakes appeared to have been thermally altered showing a patina and color change. The one
flake found in the rodent burrow was a tan secondary flake of cobble chert. No diagnostics were
observed. Two tested cobbles were also observed.
5.18.5 Horizontal and Vertical Extent of Cultural Deposit
The site appears to be confined to the surface but there are soils to 35 centimeters before a B
horizon is encountered. One flake was observed in a rodent burrow at eight centimeters below
the surface.

5.18.6 Site Integrity
The integrity of the site has been affected by erosion, root plowing, road and fence clearing and
construction and cattle and ranching activities. Most of the proposed right-of-way is a wide
cleared area used as a road with a fence in the middle. Only an area approximately 10 meters
wide on the west side was not a road or cleared area and this area had been root plowed in the
past.
5.18.7 Site Function
It is likely that the site is a temporary hunting or lithic procurement camp.
5.18.8 Cultural Affiliation
No diagnostic artifacts were observed therefore the site is classified as unknown prehistoric.
5.18.9 Recommendation
The portion of the site within the APE is recommended as not significant but the site has not
been fully accessed because the survey was confined to the APE.

Revisited Existing Archaeological Sites

Five previously recorded archaeological sites were revisited during the survey. There were five
other sites (41AT77, 41AT78, 41AT79, 41AT91and 41AT93) that appeared to be in or close to
the proposed right-of-way but the survey crew was unable to relocate these sites. All were
reported as light lithic scatters. No evidence of these sites were found within the 150 APE
during this survey. The sites may still exist but no evidence was found. All had been previously
recommended not eligible. All of the sites listed below were revisited south of San Miguel
Creek and all have been previously recommended not eligible for the NRHP. The sites are
41MC100, 41MC146, 41MC147, 41MC145, 41MC148, 41MC 400, 41MC 401, 41MC402, and
41MC403. With the exception of man made heavy erosion and a gravel pit between 41MC100
and the rest of the sites to the west this area appeared to this investigator to be one large camping
and procurement area. Cobble cherts were evident throughout the proposed right-of-way and
with the exception noted above appear to be continuous. A revisit in February 2009 to the area
confirmed the previous observations. During this visit the landowner allowed inspection outside

5-44

San Miguel Phase I

the proposed right of way and because of this it is recommended that the sites be combined into
one large site that was used as a procurement site with numerous temporary campsites. It is
likely that this area was visited by prehistoric people over many years. Local collectors noted
that they had been collecting in this area for over 30 years and did so after almost every heavy
rain. Only a few broken biface fragments were observed during the survey but there were
concentrations of cobble chert flakes with light scatters between the concentrations all along this
high ground above San Miguel Creek. A map is included showing the recommended new site
boundaries (Appendix A). It is recommended that none of these sites are eligible.
5.19 ISOLATED FINDS
Five isolated finds were recorded during the survey (Appendix A and B). All of the isolated
finds were cobble flakes and their location was noted. Additional pedestrian transects and shovel
tests around each isolated find were negative. None of the isolated finds are recommended
eligible. The following is a brief description of each isolated find.

5.19.2 Isolated Find ISO-2
Summary Data
Site Type: Isolated find.
Component: Unknown Prehistoric.
Site Location: UTM Zone 14 easting 541574 northing 3161649.
Approximate Site Area: 5 square meters.
Topography: The isolated find is south of Far Live Oak Creek.
Elevation: 350 feet (Above Mean Sea Level) AMSL.
Soil Series: No soil survey available for McMullen County, silt loam.
Nearest Water: 300 meters north northeast to unnamed tributary or drain of Far Live
Oak Creek.
Survey Method: 30-meter survey transects reduced to 2 meter transects on the site.
Site Condition: The isolated find is in a cobble strewn upland area with little or no soil.
The flake is a secondary flake of reddish brown cobble chert with some cortex on the
ventral side. A search of the immediate area which was densely covered with acacia and
little else did not reveal any additional artifacts. No shovel tests were excavated because of
the lack of soil

5.19.3 Isolated Find ISO-3
Summary Data
Site Type: Isolated find.
Component: Unknown Prehistoric.
Site Location: UTM Zone 14 easting 525567 northing 3152813.
Approximate Site Area: 5 square meters.
Topography: The isolated find is southwest Rockaway Creek.
Elevation: 310 feet (Above Mean Sea Level) AMSL.
Soil Series: No soil survey available for McMullen County, silt loam.
Nearest Water: 50 meters northeast Rockaway Creek.
Survey Method: 30-meter survey transects reduced to five meter transects on the site.
Site Condition: The isolated flake is a light pink secondary flake of what appears to be
thermally altered cobble chert. This may be a continuation of the light scatter observed at
41MC485 and 41MC486, but was recorded as an isolate because it was at least 50 meters
from any other finds. The area has been severely impacted by fence construction, road
construction, clearing and root plowing with little or no vegetation. No additional artifacts
were observed.

5.19.4 Isolated Find ISO-4
Summary Data
Site Type: Isolated find.
Component: Unknown Prehistoric.
Site Location: UTM Zone 14 easting 524791 northing 3145100.
Approximate Site Area: 5 square meters.
Topography: The isolated find is on the uplands north of Muerto Creek.
Elevation: 320 feet (Above Mean Sea Level) AMSL.
Soil Series: No soil survey available for McMullen County, silt loam.
Nearest Water: 300 meters south to Muerto Creek.
Survey Method: 30-meter survey transects reduced to five meter transects on the site.
Site Condition: The isolated tan secondary flake from a chert cobble was found within an
existing cleared transmission line right-of-way that had recently been disked. No other
artifacts were observed in the area to the southeast that had not been cleared and no other
artifacts were observed in the existing right-of-way. Three shovel tests were negative with
the soils being a sandy loam to 30 centimeters followed by a dense gravel and sand layer.

5.19.5 Isolated Find ISO-5
Summary Data
Site Type: Isolated find.
Component: Unknown Prehistoric.
Site Location: UTM Zone 14 easting 524807 northing 3142833.
Approximate Site Area: 5 square meters.
Topography: The isolated find is west of an unnamed tributary of Galinda Creek.
Elevation: 300 feet (Above Mean Sea Level) AMSL.
Soil Series: No soil survey available for McMullen County, silt loam.
Nearest Water: 50 meters east to unnamed tributary or drain of Galinda Creek.
Survey Method: 30-meter survey transects reduced to five meter transects on the site.
Site Condition: The isolated tan secondary flake from a chert cobble was found within an
existing cleared transmission line right-of-way. No other artifacts were observed Three
shovel tests were negative with the soils being a sandy loam to 10 centimeters followed by a
dense gravel and sand layer.

All of the isolated finds were found in severely eroded or disturbed contexts. They could have
easily been transported from actual archaeological sites to where they were found by graders,
tires, foot traffic, cattle, running water, or any number of other means of artifact transport.
Because they are ephemeral and because they were all found in disturbed contexts none of the
isolated finds are considered eligible for listing on the NRHP.

RECOMMENDATIONS

The purpose of this section is to present a summary of the cultural resource investigation,
including conclusions and site recommendations based on the NRHP criteria of significance (36
CFR 60.4) and the requirements of Section 106 and 36 CFR 800. The 18 archaeological sites
and five isolated finds investigated within the Project corridor are presented in tabular form in
this section in reference to the NRHP criteria of significance. As stated earlier, the NRHP
criteria are:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archaeology, engineering,
and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess
integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association and
a. that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to
the broad patterns of our history; or
b. that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
c.

that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high
artistic values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity
whose components may lack individual distinction; or

d. that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in
prehistory or history.
Criteria considerations: Ordinarily cemeteries, birthplaces, or graves of historical
figures, properties owned by religious institutions or used for religious purposes,
structures that have been moved from their original locations, reconstructed historic
buildings, properties primarily commemorative in nature, and properties that have
achieved their significance within the past 50 years shall not be considered eligible for
the National Register (36 CFR § 60.4).
Typically, the most applicable criterion for evaluating archaeological properties is criterion d. In
general, prehistoric sites containing subsurface deposits in the form of features or middens
normally make the site eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. Site integrity is a key factor in
evaluating significance.

Description of Location:
Sloping sides both north and south of Jarita Creek approximately 100 meters east of Highway 16 and approximately
20 meters south of the Atascosa/McMullen county lines in McMullen county along Jarita Creek. Cleared areas along
fence lines used as roads on the property. Shovel test were all negative except for one on the north side of Jarita
Creek where a secondary chert flake was observed between 11 and 23 centimeters. Positive shovel test was full of
krotovina.

Environmental/Topographical Setting:
Cleared areas along fence lines used as roads on the property. Shovel test were all negative except for three on the
north side of Jarita Creek where a secondary chert flake was observed between 11 and 23 centimeters. Shovel test
was full of krotovina which could explain the buried flake and the other negative shovel tests. While the site appears
to be relatively undisturbed it appears to be a surface manifestation. The other two positive shovel tests were within
10 centimeters of the surface and all three positive shovel tests were in the southern 1/4 of the site.

only three positive shovel tests and these tests found flakes in the top 10 centimeters except for a solitary flake in a
krotovinia between 11 and 23 centimeters and only in a small area on the southern end of the site it is the opinion of the
investigator that the site is not eligible for the NRHP.

Description of Location:
Site is relatively flat at the headwaters of an unnamed intermittent creek. Most of the artifacts were found in a two
track fence road but also found some in the dense mesquite, acacia, and prickly pear. All of the observed artifacts
were on the surface with none being found in shovel tests. Shovel tests revealed a thin layer of topsoil that was loamy
and root filled to less than 10 centimeters then a hard compact clay.

Environmental/Topographical Setting:
Dense mesquite, acacia and Prickly Pear. The vegetation for the fence ranch road parallels and is within the
proposed right of way. Most of the artifacts were observed in the road which was created by bulldozing and root
plowing. Two flakes and the broken biface tool were found in open areas within the dense brush. We were not
allowed outside the right of way by the landowner who was present during the survey. It is likely that the site extends
outside the right of way. The landowner indicated that they had found many "arrowheads" in the same area but did
not allow us to view the collection.

Discussion of Site:
The site appears to be a deflated site with little or no topsoil remaining. Parts of the sites within the right of way have
been disturbed by fencing, road building, and root plowing (40 years ago for the root plowing according to owner Ms.

Wheeler). Ms Wheeler also indicated that many "arrowheads were on her property but refused to say where. She does
not allow anyone to collect "arrowheads". The vegetation was dense in parts of the site with mesquite, acacia, and
prickly pear being dominant. There was good to execellent ground surface visibility on the roads, fence lines, erosion
areas and within the dense brush were many pockets where surface visibility was 100 percent. The broken biface
fragment was found in one such opening. Site likely extends outside of the right of way but no permission was granted
to determine the extent of the site.

Description of Location:
Site is on a flat area from Mr. Hundley's eastern property line along the eastern bank of the headwaters of Leoncita
Creek. Mr. Hundley's property is heavily managed and he indicated that the entire area had been root plowed to four
feet in the past. He also indicated that they used to find fire hearths with burnt rock along the east side of the creek
but that most of those had been destroyed. We did not observed any hearths but did observe broken bifaces, and a
moderate scatter of flakes. Shovel testing did not produce any subsurface artifacts but this may simply be a sampling
error. The artifacts observed appeared to all be from cobble chert. A tortuga ppt and what appears to be a fragment
of a large triangular ppt or knife were also observed and photographed. Mr. Hundley also indicated that they had
collected a large number of "arrowheads" from this and other sites on the property but was unwilling to show them to
us.

Environmental/Topographical Setting:
Site is on a gently sloping area with moderate vegetation of mesquite, acacia, prickly pear. Fairly large eroded open
areas with gravel and cobbles exposed among the artifacts that were observed. The site from just inside Mr.
Hundley's high fence property line southwest in the right of way to the drain/stream (intermittent). It is likely that the
site extends along the drain/stream to the northwest and the southeast but the landowner would not allow survey
outside the proposed right of way.

secondary flakes, and tertiary flakes were observed some in concentrations. Biface fragments and flake tools were
noted. One tortugas projectile point and one broken biface that may be a portion of an early triangular projectile point.
No pottery was observed.
Discussion of Site:
We were confined to the right of way but there was a light to moderate lithic scatter from just southwest of the road
ringing the property to the drain/stream to the southwest. It is likely that the site is wider but the landowner insisted that
we stay in the right of way as much as possible. The site is level to gently sloping and has moderate vegetation of
mesquite, acacia, and prickly pear. The GSV was excellent ranging from 60 to 90 percent.

Site is on a genle slope above the intermittent upper reaches of Leoncita Creek. A two track road runs through the
site providing excellent ground surface visibility. The vegetation is moderate with mesquite, acacia, and prickly pear.
Numerous cattle trails and eroded areas in the site. Shovel tests indicated at least 35 centimeters of sandy loam
before encountering compact sand and clay. Some concentrations but because these were found in eroded areas the
concentrations may be artificial. Appears to be a procurement and camping area.

flakes both uniface and biface, primary, secondary, and tertiary flakes.
Discussion of Site:
Shovel tests found cobble secondary and tertiary flakes at 25 centimeters below the surface. No features were found
but this may be due to a sampling error. There is at least 35 centimeters of soil over a compact sand clay subsoil. Site
has been disturbed by erosion, road and fence construction and root plowing (landowner information) in the past. Site
appears to be a procurement and campsite.

Discussion of Site:
A large lithic scatter that is likely a procurement area based upon the artifacts observed. Site is on a gentle slope with
the eastern part of the site on both sides of the upper intermittent reaches of Rockaway Creek. Vegetation is sparse
grassland that has been created by root plowing. A few mesquite, acacia and prickly pear but mostly grass pasture with
excellent GSV. No concentrations were observed and the site appears to be deflated by erosion.

A light scatter of tested cobbles and primary and secondary flakes. All shovel tests were negative but did observe a
small tan secondary flake at 8 centimeters in the wall of a rodent burrow.
Discussion of Site:
Site appears to be a shallow lithic scatter on a slightly raised area near a unnamed tributary of the Frio River. The
flakes observed appeared to be from the local cobble chert but some appeared to have been thermally altered. No
diagnostics were observed. Shovel tests were all negative with a dense compact loamy clay encountered at
approximately 35 centimeters.
