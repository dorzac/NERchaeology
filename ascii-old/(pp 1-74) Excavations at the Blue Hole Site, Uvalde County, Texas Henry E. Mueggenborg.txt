Excavations at the Blue Hole Site,
Uvalde County, Texas, 1990
Henry E. Mueggenborg

ABSTRACT
The Blue Hole site (41UV159) was recorded by a University of Texas at Austin
1989 Summer Archaeological Field School survey team. Located in the upper
Sabinal River Valley, about 13 km south of Utopia, Texas, the large alluvial
terrace evidenced occupations dating from Early Archaic to Late Prehistoric
periods. The site was excavated as a part of the Texas Archeological Society’s
1990 Summer Field School. The goal of the excavation was to define the
stratigraphy of the site in relation to the prehistory of the Sabinal Canyon.
Excavations focused on 1 meter units along intersecting lines, which extended
through a concentrated burned rock midden and into adjacent occupation areas.
Artifacts recovered consisted primarily of lithics dating from the Late Prehistoric to the Middle Archaic period. Detailed information regarding burned rock,
lithic debitage, land snails, and the general stratigraphy of the site have created a
vivid visualization of cultural deposition at the site.

INTRODUCTION
The Blue Hole site (41UV159) is a prehistoric occupation site located on
the Mary K. Kindred Ranch about 13 km south of Utopia, Texas, in northeastern
Uvalde County (Figure 1). Here, the upper Sabinal Valley narrows and the
Sabinal River leaves the Balcones Escarpment, the southernmost limit of the
Edwards Plateau region. The alluvial terraces in this section of the valley contain
numerous prehistoric remains, and the burned rock middens scattered in the area
have long been a favorite source for local artifact collectors.
The University of Texas at Austin (UT) 1989 Summer Archaeological Field
School, directed by Dr. Thomas R. Hester, included daily surface surveys of the
upper Sabinal Valley area that were oriented toward site identification and
recording. Local collections were documented and collectors were interviewed
by Paul Maslyk (1993), who led the survey teams. One of the most popular
collection areas was identified as the burned rock middens adjacent to the "Blue
Hole," a deep, broad pool at a bend in the Sabinal River on the Kindred ranch.
Maslyk obtained permission to survey the area and record the sites. Several days
were spent on general reconnaissance, surface collecting, and recording the
several sites on the ranch. Many sites were associated with burned rock middens,

and the artifacts collected included Early Archaic to Late Prehistoric period lithic
projectile points.
The Blue Hole site was originally recorded as an individual burned rock
midden on a deep alluvial terrace about 100 m east of the Blue Hole. Numerous
collector potholes remained around the perimeter of the site and we later learned
that the southern and western edges of the site had been mechanically (Bobcat
loader and mechanical screen) excavated between 1986-1988.
When the upper Sabinal Valley was selected for the Texas Archeological
Society (TAS) 1990 Summer Field School, Mary K. Kindred granted permission
to excavate the Blue Hole site as a major focus of the field school. The main goal
of the Blue Hole excavations was to define the temporal occupations of the
midden itself, and the adjoining occupation areas, in an attempt to clarify the
local chronology and to further examine the burned rock midden phenomenon in
Central and South Texas archeology.
This paper will first set forth the physical environment at the site, discuss
the archeological background of the general area, and give an account of the field
and laboratory methods employed in the investigation. Since archeology reconstructs the accumulation of cultural deposits, the natural, geologic processes
which contributed to the formation of the site are of particular interest.
These natural processes are then related to the artifacts recovered from the
excavations to establish a relative site chronology consistent with that generally

established for South and Central Texas. The artifacts, consisting primarily of
lithics, are then described and the interrelationships between the burned rock
accumulations, lithic artifacts, and molluscan remains are examined. Finally, the
features are discussed and placed within the site’s temporal framework.

ENVIRONMENT
Physical Setting
The upper Sabinal Valley follows the southerly flow of the Sabinal River
through the Balcones Escarpment. The escarpment’s position at the edge of the
Edwards Plateau region places it between two of the grand physiographic divisions of North America, the Great Plains province to the west and the Coastal
Plains to the east and south (Jordan et al. 1984). In Central Texas, this major
physiographic break is denoted by the change from the Hill Country on the
westward side of the escarpment to the Blackland Prairie on the east. With the
Blue Hole site situated at the southern edge of the Balcones Escarpment, the
South Texas Coastal Plain spreads immediately to the south, while the area to the
north is in the Edwards Plateau.

Hydrology
The Sabinal River, because of its position with respect to other streams of
the region (the Frio River to the west and the Medina to the east) and the positions of their head streams, obtains very little of its discharge from the limestone of the Edwards Plateau. Most of its water comes from rainfall runoff and
seep springs in the Glen Rose formation. Consequently, the flow of the Sabinal
River is relatively slight and is subject to rapid fluctuations. The relatively small
flow of the river is further lost into fissures and fault planes near the Blue Hole
where the Sabinal crosses the Balcones fault zone (Mear 1953). Thus, during
the drier summer months, with the exception of unusual precipitation, the
Sabinal River ceases to flow. However, it does maintain large quantities of water
in the deeper entrenchments, such as the Blue Hole, that occur in the main river
channel.
The Sabinal has many asymmetrical meanders which are separated by long
straight portions of the river, and these meanders create rich alluvial terrace
deposits with the sudden and short-lived floods characteristic of the river (Mear
1953). These terrace deposits result in an enriched environment with more productive floral species, but they would further have provided the prehistoric inhabitants with elevated habitation sites adjacent to a water source.

Geology

The Geologic Atlas of Texas depicts the entire upper Sabinal Valley as
"Quaternary deposits undivided" including "slope wash, alluvial fan deposits,
alluvium, colluvium, and locally older Quaternary deposits; mostly in the size
range of cobbles to silt derived from Cretaceous limestone, dolomite, and chert"
(Barnes 1983). The entire watershed is bounded by the Glen Rose Formation,
consisting of about 122 m thick beds of "limestone, dolomite, and marl as
alternating resistant and recessive beds forming stairstep topography." The Glen
Rose formation, which extends several miles from the central valley region and a
few hundred meters at the southern confluence, is then bounded by the Edwards
Limestone, specifically Devil’s River Limestone. Acording to Barnes (1983),
this is a "limestone and dolomite, hard, miliolid, pellet, rudistid, shell fragment
biosparite and lime mudstone; locally dolomitized, brecciated, and chert bearing;
rudistid mounds more common in upper part; nodular limestone in basal part;
thickness about 700 feet (213 meters)."
Selection of sites for early human habitation was at least partially influenced by a quality source of chert raw material for tools. Banks (1990) identified
the Devil’s River formation as one of the three principal chert-bearing units in
the Edwards Group. In addition, the Uvalde gravel, composed of pebbles and
cobbles of chert with some limestone in a calcareous mix, occurs naturally in the
low rolling hills that outcrop below the Balcones Escarpment, but 61-91 m
above modern stream levels (Mear 1953). However, it is generally accepted that
the better quality chert was obtained from the upper Edwards areas or from
Edwards gravels in the river bottom.
The general soil map from the Soil Survey of Uvalde County, Texas
(Stevens and Richmond 1976:5), describes the floodplain of the upper Sabinal
valley as "nearly level to gently sloping and undulating to hilly, very shallow to
shallow and stony, clayey and loamy soils." The alluvial terrace which encases
the Blue Hole Site consists entirely of"young but not recent Conalb loam, a fineloamy, carbonatic, hyperthermic Inceptisol" (Stevens and Richmond 1976:97).

Flora and Fauna
Blair (1950) placed the upper Sabinal Valley at the southern limit of the
Balconian, or Edwards Plateau, biotic province, with the Tamaulipan province
immediately to the south. The most characteristic plant association in the
Balconian is the scrub forest of Mexican cedar, Texas oak, and stunted live oak,
interspersed with less numerous species. To the south, thorny brush, including
mesquite and prickly pear, predominates in the Tamaulipan. The vertebrate fauna
of the Balconian is an intermixture of species found generally to the north, west,
and south of the province whereas the Tamaulipan species are more representative of provinces to the east of the Balconian. While both provinces contain vast
floral and faunal resources, it is significant that the upper Sabinal Valley is

Henry E. Mueggenborg ~ Excavations at the Blue Hole Site

located at a natural ecotone, or transitional zone; human populations are able to
exploit the faunal and floral resources common to each respective province.
The floodplain of the present day upper Sabinal Valley characteristically
has been cleared, and is either cultivated or improved grassland, or has been
reclaimed by low mesquite and low shrubs, prickly pear cactus, and native
grasses. The lower areas nearer the rivers and streams have concentrations of
large pecan, oak, and elm trees while the rockier elevations support rather dense
populations of live oak, mesquite, and cedar. The Blue Hole site itself sits upon a
partially cleared alluvial terrace, with the lower slopes supporting numerous
large native pecan, elm, and oak trees (Figure 2).

Climate
Uvalde County has a subtropical climate with dry winters and hot, humid
summers. The present day upper Sabinal Valley receives an annual average of
59.6 cm of rainfall and enjoys a 255 day growing season (Texas Almanac 1989).

During the Wisconsin glacial period (20,000-12,000 B.C.), the area "was
considerably cooler and more humid than today" (Bryant and Holloway 1985:50),
and was covered with grasslands, woodlands, and parklands including species of
spruce and pine. Faunal records contain extinct species--such as the long nosed
peccary and the mastodon-- generally thought to inhabit cool, humid forests
(Graham 1976). A slow climatic deterioration, with drier and warmer conditions,
probably occurred between 12,000-8000 B.C., as the spruce and pine gradually
gave way to grasslands (Black 1989:13). The Pleistocene and the accompanying
Ice Age came to an end somewhere between 8000-7000 B.C.
Following what appears to have been a relatively long, gradual trend toward
warmer temperatures and drier conditions (Bryant and Shafer 1977), the vegetation communities are believed to have become generally similar to those of today
by about 550 B.C. By that time, the grasslands and oak savannas of South
Central Texas had been established. Along with the plentiful food source of the
acorn, bison proliferated in the region by around 1000 B.C. (Dillehay 1974). This
gradual increase of floral and faunal resources, and the year-long reliability of
the white-tailed deer and smaller game species as food sources, resulted in the
growth of human populations and their expansion into more diverse geographical
regions (Hester 1980).

ARCHEOLOGICALBACKGROUND
South Central Texas Chronology
While the division of human prehistory into time frames, and the naming
and calibration of these time frames, has caused considerable debate among
archeologists, the basic periods as used in Texas are divided by changes in
lifeways, subsistence patterns, settlement, and technology. Consequently, the
division between these "periods" is most often transitional in one aspect (for
instance, technology), while other aspects of culture appear to remain relatively
constant. The commonly accepted periods or stages are listed below for South
Central Texas (Turner and Hester 1985:47-53):

When studying certain parameters of Central Texas archeology, particularly
temporal assignments of site occupations, projectile points and other tools are
common and reliable indicators. Consequently, any archeological investigation
relies heavily upon established projectile point typologies for understanding
chronology. While point typology is not necessarily indicative of cultural change,
the ability to link projectile point types to a particular period and area, and their
validation in this regard by absolute and relative dating methods, makes this
chronology particularly useful. Toward this goal, Suhm et al. (1954) published a
widely accepted taxonomy of Texas stone artifacts, which has been subsequently
refined by Suhm and Jelks (1962), Weir (1976), Prewitt (1981), and Turner and
Hester (1985). Continuing archeological investigations will help to more closely
define the temporal and regional typological associations of projectile points (see
Johnson and Goode 1994), especially with the collation of radiocarbon dates in
association with these lithic artifacts (e.g., Prewitt 1985; Black and McGraw
1985:324). Consequently, this paper will generally follow the South Central
Texas point typology in establishing the vertical stratigraphy of the site, and in
comparing those occupational patterns with other relevant site excavation data.

Comparative Studies
Prior to the 1970s, little had been published pertinent to the archeology of
Uvalde County and immediately adjacent counties. However, several reports
have since appeared, and recent excavations have been undertaken, and these
have helped clarify and define the prehistoric occupation of the general area.
The Paleoindian period remains relatively undocumented, but Archaic cultural
remains are much more common, as evidenced by the number of burned rock
middens and terrace sites present in the proximity of the Blue Hole site itself.
The burned rock midden phenomenon, discussed below, is a common Central
Texas occurrence particular to the Middle and Late Archaic periods. The Late
Prehistoric period is marked primarily by the introduction of the bow and arrow, and arrowpoints are extensively represented in area surface collections and
stratigraphically above earlier Archaic occupations in excavated assemblages.
The following excavations are representative of the recent studies from the area,
and are thus of particular relevance in placing the Blue Hole site in its regional
context.

Kincaid Rock Shelter
Generally, the earliest human occupation in the area is represented by
occasional surface finds of Late Paleoindian projectile points. However, Collins
et al. (1989) reported a stone pavement lens clearly associated with a Clovis
occupation at the Kincaid rockshelter, about 24 km downstream from the Blue
Hole site in Uvalde County. Collins (1990) further reported six distinct geological

8

zones at the shelter which included some Late Prehistoric artifacts, the complete
Archaic sequence, and both Folsom and Clovis Paleoindian occupations.

La Jita Site (41UV21)

About 8 km up the Sabinal River from Blue Hole, the burned rock middens
and adjacent occupation areas of the La Jita site were excavated in 1967 (Hester
1971). Although occupations from the Early Archaic through the Late Prehistoric periods were represented, the Middle and Late Archaic occupations are of
particular relevance to the Blue Hole site, because of geographic proximity, the
artifact assemblages, and their relationships to the burned rock middens. Eighteen radiocarbon dates were obtained from the Late and Transitional Archaic
through the Late Prehistoric period occupations. The most recent La Jita excavations (1989 UT Field School and 1990 TAS Field School) concentrated on
the Late Prehistoric occupations, and recovered primarily Toyah phase Perdiz
arrowpoints, beveled bifaces, and end scrapers, as well as an assortment of
sherds from Leon Plain pottery in association with bison bone (Huebner 1990).

Smith Site (41UV132)
The 1989 excavations of the burned rock midden and adjacent occupation
areas at the Smith site on the west bank of the Sabinal, about 1.5 km upstream
from the La Jita site, revealed substantial Early Archaic occupations. Charcoal
in association with an in situ hearth was radiocarbon dated and calibrated to
6307 + 90 B.P. or 4357 + 90 B.C. (Hester 1990; calibrated following Stuiver
and Reimer [1986]), and a number of associated Early Archaic projectile points
were found in the strata underlying the Middle Archaic occupations. A major
Middle Archaic component was excavated in association with the burned rock
midden, but the Late Archaic occupation was sparse and no Late Prehistoric
artifacts were recovered. The 1990 TAS Field School excavations at the Smith
site were directed at the deeper Early Archaic deposits and hearth complexes
(Smith 1990).

Leona River Watershed, Four Sites in Uvalde County
Located about 40 km southwest of the Blue Hole site, the four sites included five burned rock middens and a quarry area (Lukowski 1987). Based on
intersite comparisons of the five burned rock middens, and the associated radiocarbon dates, Lukowski proposed that the burned rock middens extended into
much later temporal periods than was initially believed. Certain projectile point
types similarly appeared to extend temporally beyond generally accepted time
ranges.

Luce Middens (41UV20, 22, and 23 )

These three burned rock middens, located in the northwestern corner of
Uvalde County adjacent to the Nueces River, contained artifacts attributable to
the Middle Archaic period. The zones above the burned rock deposits yielded
Late and Transitional Archaic through Late Prehistoric period artifacts (Hester
1970). The sites had been heavily disturbed by collectors, and the zone strata and
chronologies were established from the visual inspection of the sites, as well as
from the collected artifacts and their reported approximate proveniences.

Salado Creek Watershed Site (41BX300)
Situated at the southeastern perimeter of the Balcones Escarpment, about
105 km due east of the Blue Hole site, 41BX300 was excavated in Bexar County
in 1978 (Katz 1987). The excavations yielded diagnostic projectile points that
clearly placed the burned rock midden in the Late Archaic period, with a substantial Transitional Archaic occupation in the strata above the burned rock midden.
No conclusive absolute dates were obtained, however, to substantiate either the
relative dating of the artifacts or the burned rock midden.

Panther Creek Springs Site (41BX228)
The 1979 excavations at Panther Creek Springs, located about l0 km southWest of 41BX300, indicated its intermittent occupation over at least 5,000 years,
beginning in the Early Archaic period (Black and McGraw 1985). The deposits
and artifacts were placed into an 11-phase local chronology, and radiocarbon
dates were obtained from the Early, Middle, and Late Archaic periods, as well as
from Late Prehistoric period deposits, to support the chronology.

The Burned Rock Midden
There is continued discussion regarding the origin of burned rock middens
(BRMs) in Centra! Texas, although there is general consensus that they date
primarily to the Middle and Late Archaic periods. These middens are large
accumulations of fire-cracked and discolored limestone (Hester 199!). Early
theories explained the BRM as an accumulation of abandoned hearths, but Hester
(1971) reported that the accumulation at La Jita appeared to be a "rubble dump"
where the broken-up hearth stones were cleared and dumped on a conveniently
placed pile. It appears that prehistoric populations congregated repeatedly at
favored locations to engage in a cooking process that used limestone which was
then abandoned or discarded in piles.
Although Weir (1976) defined four types of BRM that occur in Central
Texas, the excavations at the Blue Hole site involve a midden of Weir’s Type 1, a

10

Texas Archeological Society

dome-shaped accumulation from 0.45-2 m or more in maximum thickness. In
addition, several other BRMs were recorded near the Blue Hole site but they
were not excavated.
Artifacts and other cultural remains vary in BRMs from site to site. As with
most of the BRMs in Central Texas, the acidic soils of the upper Sabinal Valley
prohibit preservation of most of the associated food items, but the occurrence
of charred acorns at 41BN63 (Thomas R. Hester, personal communication
1990), deer bones, mussel shells, and a variety of snail shells at other BRM sites
support the "cooking location" theory. Projectile points and other lithic tools
are sometimes found within the concentration of burned rocks and black soil
matrix, whereas other middens produce only burned rock.
The most popular theory regarding the formation of the BRM revolves
around utilization of acorns. Black (1989:19-20) discussed the positive distributional correlation of BRMs to that of the oak savannah (see also Creel 1991),
and argues that the rock accumulations are a result of the processing of acorns
(to remove the tannic acid and!or enhance preservation) by stone boiling or other
cooking methods. Turner (1989) examined ethnohistoric data from aboriginal
cultures in other areas of North America to propose that similar use of the acorn
as a staple was likely common in Central Texas in Middle through Late Archaic times. Goode (1991) has demonstrated that BRMs are now known to have
been used into the Late Prehistoric period.
Regardless of the specific or varied purpose of the BRM, their abundance
in the upper Sabinal Valley, and the general Central Texas area, and their use
over 1,500-3,000 years, substantiates the proliferation of human populations
during the Middle through Late Archaic periods. It is this indication of increased
population density that prods us to continue exploring the BRM for more definitive reconstructions of the cultures of these early inhabitants of the region.

FIELD METHODS
The 1989 UT Summer Field School survey teams recorded the Blue Hole
site as a single BRM and adjacent occupational area perhaps 100 m wide (north
to south) and 200 m long (east to west). While no shovel tests or test excavations were performed either in 1989, or in advance of the TAS Field School, the
surface scatter of burned rocks, the partially exposed potholes, and the location
of the artifacts that were recovered in 1989, gave us a relatively reliable definition of the horizontal and vertical limits of the site.
In 1990, a week prior to the commencement of the TAS Field School, a
crew of eight graduate students from The University of Texas at Austin went to
the Blue Hole site, and other sites selected for TAS excavations, to inspect, map,
and prepare the sites for excavation. Heavy and consistent rains in March and
April of 1990 created a dense grass and weed cover over the site. A tractor and
shredder were hired to mow the site and perimeter; the site was cleared of brush,

and low overhanging branches were removed. Permanent horizontal and vertical datums were established along with a site grid, and the entire terrace encompassing the site was mapped using a transit (Figure 3).

As our excavation plan, and eventual interpretation of the site, would rely
heavily on geomorphological interpretations of the deposits themselves, a crew
of UT students began a test unit at N 113W102 (S 1 in Figure 3), proceeding down
the north slope of the terrace to N116W102, in 1 meter wide units. The excavation methods employed, and the findings of this and subsequent units excavated
for geomorphological purposes, are addressed later in this paper.
Since the TAS Field School would involve excavations at four prehistoric
sites, and a number of historic investigations, a detailed Technical Procedures
Manual (Mueggenborg 1990) had been prepared for distribution to all field
school participants upon arrival. While the excavation techniques varied somewhat from site to site depending on the excavation goals, uniform bagging,
recording, and laboratory procedures were set forth to control the anticipated
volume of data and artifact recovery. The discussion below describes the specific
procedures used at the Blue Hole site.
The basic metric grid system was used at the site for horizontal control, with
units progressing to the north and west from the primary datum (see Figure 3).
Grid North was set at Magnetic North. Vertical measurements were stated as
distances above or below the primary datum set arbitrarily at 100 m. Elevation
reference stakes were designated for each unit, and string lines were used to
measure vertical levels and the provenience of all significant artifacts and features. Crews were assigned to 1 m units and all 10 cm levels were dug to even 10
cm elevation readings (i.e., bottom of each level was 99.60 cm or 99.50 cm, for
example). This uniformity is important when evaluating the computer-generated
reconstructions of site deposition presented later in this paper.
Crews consisted generally of five individuals, one of whom was designated
as the recorder for each level. Standard level forms insured consistency in
information and format. All matrix was screened using a 1/4-inch screen, and
artifacts (lithic debitage, land snails, bone, charcoal, mussel shell, etc.) were
bagged by level. All projectile points or other particularly meaningful artifacts
were provenienced and recorded and bagged separately. None of the typologically diagnostic projectile points were washed, either in the field or laboratory, to
facilitate possible future residue analysis. Burned rocks were weighed, recorded,
and discarded.
Crew Chiefs were supervised by four Area Supervisors, who monitored the
overall progress and consistency of the excavations. The method of excavation
varied somewhat with the circumstances and personnel involved but, generally,
careful shoveling or trowelling was employed until particularly significant artifacts or concentrations were found in the screen, or features were identified, at
which time more meticulous care was used. Two Site Secretaries issued and
controlled all level bags and artifacts recovered.
TAS Site Directors Dr. E. Mott Davis and James H. Word met with the
author and Dr. Hester on June 8, and we selected areas for excavation as well as
general goals and strategies. Hester (1971:127) had suggested that the excavation
of BRMs should concentrate not only on the BRM proper but also on peripheral

Henry E. Mueggenborg ~ Excavations at the Blue Hole Site

13

areas outside the BRM. Black (1989:19-20) similarly suggested implementing
more comprehensive research designs than the standard approaches of either
mining the midden for large collections of artifacts, or scattering test pits within
and around the midden. Toward this end, our main strategy was to excavate 2 m
units along two intersecting lines that extended from beyond the perimeter of the
midden accumulation into the midden proper. This broad view of the site deposits, as evidenced in the exposed profiles of the units, was to meet our primary
objective: the reconstruction of the BRM cultural deposits.
Excavations commenced on June 9, 1990, at 7:30 A.M., by the approximately 150 individuals assigned to the Blue Hole site. It became obvious that
there was a degree of disturbance in certain areas (based on the chronological
intermixture of recovered projectile point types), but excavations continued since
certain surficial disturbances had been anticipated at the site.
As work was finishing for the day, a local collector arrived who had
mechanically excavated portions of the site. He indicated that certain units were
within the confines of his previous excavations. Although the site had been
subjected to pothunting, the heavy vegetation on the terrace had made it impossible to delineate the bounds of any disturbance other than the remaining potholes. The collector indicated that he had used a Bobcat loader to excavate
portions of the site to depths of 3 m and that he had backfilled and smoothed the
surface of the site over a year prior to the UT 1989 survey. He was very
cooperative and interested in our scientific approach to the reconstruction of the
site, and he detailed the horizontal confines and approximate depths of his
excavations. The net result of the first work day was the misdirection of the
entire excavation force. In retrospect, it was fortunate that the local collector
defined the limits of his potholes when he did. Otherwise, controlled tests would
have been needed to define the limits of the disturbed area before further TAS
excavations could have continued.
The Site Directors met with Dr. Hester, and the excavation plan was adjusted to exclude the previously disturbed areas. Excavations commenced again,
early on June 10, concentrating on 2 m wide units along north-south lines to
intersect at grid coordinate N106W110. The N106 line was staggered at W100 to
keep the excavations close to the perimeter of the terrace while maintaining its
east-west orientation (Figure 4). The artifact recovery rate was intense as the
excavations progressed through Monday, June 11. A tremendous amount of time
was consumed in delays to log all bifacial lithic artifacts as "unique items," the
designation for any artifact which required proveniencing and might become
particularly relevant in later analysis. The Site Directors and Crew Chiefs met
that Monday evening and decided on a "semi-unique" category for non-diagnostic projectile points and other artifacts which, in a less productive site, would rate
a higher priority. We continued to provenience any "semi-unique" items found in
situ, with the Area Supervisors approving the classifications as to "unique" or
"semi-unique." The "semi-unique" items were then expediently bagged together
by unit level. As the week progressed, the number of excavators decreased

somewhat, and by Wednesday, June 13, all excavations were concentrated in 1 m
wide lines at N106 and W110, eliminating the complementary 1 m units which
had previously made up the 2 m wide excavation plan.
The excavations continued on the N106 and W110 lines through Saturday,
June 16, the final day of the TAS Field School. Certain of the 1 m units had
been completed to near-sterile depths while others were barely started (Figure
5). Plans had been made for a number of volunteers to return over the Labor
Day weekend to continue excavations. Several crew members stayed over
through Monday to complete wall profiles and photographs in the event of dis-

turbance prior to our return; the units were covered and protected with tarps and
plywood covering.
The TAS operated a field laboratory at the Utopia camp area, and the lab
processed the unit bags, to the extent possible, including washing and counting
the lithic debitage, counting the land snails, and confirming the field identifications of projectile point types. The daily feedback from lab personnel was
invaluable in limiting and correcting inconsistencies in procedures, and for monitoring the progress of the excavations. The unit bags not completed at the TAS
Field School were completed by UT students during the summer of 1990.
Mr. Bob Vernon, a TAS member who now resides in Massachusetts and
who had excavated at the Blue Hole site throughout the field school, volunteered
his computer expertise and services in plotting data charts for analysis and planning purposes. Prior to the Labor Day effort, his charts helped graphically reconstruct the field school excavations by showing concentrations of burned rock,
land snails, and lithic debitage in cross-views of the units. These data, together
with the location of features and other artifact concentrations, were the basis
for the selection of units for further excavations over Labor Day.
Approximately 60 TAS members returned for Labor Day excavations between August 31-September 2. A great deal of additional progress was made
during the three days but, as is commonly the case, not all excavation goals were
met (Figure 6). Again, profiles were drawn and photographs of each unit wall
were taken. Core samples were taken to 3 m below excavated levels in selected
units for possible future analysis. Plastic liners were placed in the units and they
were mechanically backfilled.

TERRACE GEOMORPHOLOGY
Methods
Since archeology relies on the physical location of artifacts and their spatial relationships to other cultural remains to establish their significance, it is
paramount that any excavation be planned in relation to the site’s geomorphological depositional framework. Proper interpretation of depositional processes,
and the relative position and age of the site strata, independent of occupational
debris, permits the formulation of more scientific excavation objectives and
strategies.
The Upper Sabinal River Valley was the subject of Mear’s (1953) master’s
thesis. He identified the alluvial terrace formations of the valley with numerical
assignations as follows: Q0, Q1 and Q2 (Holocene alluvium); and Q3 and Q4
(Pleistocene gravel terraces). Describing the deposits by their composition and
color, Mear noted that the alluvial deposits created a stair-step sequence down to
the present river channel, with the higher terrace deposits generally being older.
Using not only environmental data evident in the deposits, but also temporally

diagnostic cultural artifacts found in association, the Q2 and Q1 deposits were
thought to span the Middle and Late Archaic periods.
To improve the definition of these Holocene geologic strata, an initial
geomorphological test was conducted at the Blue Hole Site in advance of the
TAS Field School excavations. This test (S-I), proceeding in 1 m units down the
north slope of the terrace at N113W102, was excavated in 50 cm levels using
shovels. The matrix was screened using a 1/4-inch screen, and the artifacts
recovered were bagged and logged using regular procedures.
Basic records were maintained regarding the general location of the burned
rock. concentrations and the recovered artifacts, but our primary goal was to
expose the vertical profile of the test. In addition to the geomorphological
profile, the preliminary evaluation of the artifacts recovered, and their relative
location, helped define and clarify initial excavation strategies. The profile of
this test unit (Figure 7) was:

The initial geomorphological interpretation of Unit S-1 was performed by
Gene Mear, Dr. Michael B. Collins, and Michael D. Blum. They found the
terrace deposits consistent with Mear’s Q2 and Q1 depositional episodes, with
the more recent Q0 lying on the lower terrace between the site and the Sabinal
River.
Coincident with the TAS excavations on the N106 and W110 lines, additional geomorphotogical tests were excavated at N113W102 (S-I), at a 1 m unit
(N 120W148, S-2), and a lx2 m unit (N233W244, S-3). These units were selected
by the visiting geomorphologists to evaluate depositional variation across the
terrace, but moving away from the river. The recovered artifacts and stratigraphic profiles of these test units confirmed the initial horizontal definition of
the BRM proper, but, generally, no additional information was discovered to
warrant any change in site excavation strategies. After the profiles were recorded
and interpreted by the geomorphologists, tests S-2 and S-3 were backfilled at the
completion of the regular TAS Field School.
To facilitate more complete geomorphological interpretations of the terrace,
11 backhoe trenches were excavated at the site on July 6th (see Figure 3). Each
unit was dug as a narrow trench at least 50 cm into the Q2 alluvium. No
screening or other artifact recovery methods were used since the goal was to
expose the unit profiles for geomorphological interpretation (Table 1). On July
13, Blum returned to the site, reviewed the units, and recorded his geomorphological interpretations of the terrace (Blum 1990).

Interpretations
According to Blum (1990), the main body of the Blue Hole site sediments,
which extend vertically at least 5 m below the surface, consists of the Q2
alluvium. This alluvium was deposited as a constructional floodplain surface
during the Early to Middle Holocene period. Radiocarbon dates from other
drainages of the Balcones Escarpment area of the Edwards Plateau indicate these
Q2 deposits date from 10,000-5000 B.P. After deposition ended, the river
downcut slightly and abandoned the floodplain and began to deposit the Q1
alluvium, which makes up the terrace nearer the present river channel to the
south of the Blue Hole site. These Q1 deposits probably date from 4500-1000
B.P. Each of these two major stratigraphic units of the Holocene represent long
periods of time when the river was migrating laterally and aggrading vertically,
constructing the floodplain laterally from the channel.

Figure 7. Geomorphological Test S I at N113W102. The profile shows the burned rock
accumulation of the main excavation area overlying the Q2 alluvium.

Due to the periods of time involved, each of these depositional units contains a wide variety of facies, or environmentally specific types of deposits.
Depending on the duration and severity of flood episodes, older deposits were
overtopped with thin veneers of alluvium from the latest episodes. Similarly,
the older Q2 deposits were implaced with thin veneers of Q1. This more naturally occurs near valley confluences or constrictions, such as the Blue Hole
location, where flood waters back up and attain a higher level than they would
in an open valley.
The earliest archeological remains from sites in the Sabinal Valley are
found, in terms of their geologic context, within Q2 deposits. Although

~Relative to site’s primary vertical datum at 100 meters.
2At 150 cm, more recent Q1 depositions were still evident.
3Gravel facies exposed at 90 cm.

Paleoindian habitation debris is occasionally recovered in the valley, the major
floodplain accumulations from 10,000 to 5000 B.P. lessen the likelihood of
identifying a discrete Paleoindian occupation. However, the Early Archaic
peoples who visited or resided in the area did so on the still active floodplain.
The record of their activities remains vertically segregated within these facies
as the deposition of Q2 deposits gradually diminished in the Early Holocene.
The boundary between the Q2 and the Q1 terrace veneer facies is generally
marked by a soil profile that developed in Q2 sediments during a period of
landscape stability. It is this partially buried soil that was the surface upon which
the BRMs accumulated at Blue Hole. During this period of stability, the Middle
through Late Archaic, there was only minor sedimentation. The period of stability
is marked by soil development, and this soil development is accelerated in the
BRMs themselves, due to the anthropogenic nature of the matrix derived from
processing plant foods and other such activities. Thus, the Q2 terrace at the Blue

Henry E. Mueggenborg ~ Excavations at the Blue Hole Site

21

Hole site became a reasonably discrete soil comprised of thin, periodic, veneer
sediment deposits and the cultural debris of the inhabitants.
Of particular importance to the BRM atop the Q2 terrace is the Q1 terrace
adjacent to, and below, the site toward the river. Gully exposures into this Q 1
terrace indicate it contains major gravelly facies. Thus, the Middle Archaic
peoples had a source for limestone cobbles about 40 m away.
After sorting through the discarded burned rock piles, we determined that
all of the limestone cobbles used in the BRM were rounded and tumbled from
flood deposition. The only angular edges on the discarded rocks appeared to be
from heat fracture. This differs from many BRM sites in the Edwards Plateau
where the prehistoric occupants appeared to favor proximity to bluffs with a
good exposure of thin bedded limestone as the source material. The limestone in
the bluffs to the east of the Blue Hole site is relatively thick bedded, and would
need to be broken up prior to use to be suitable for campfires and hearths.
The earliest record of human occupation at the Blue Hole site, at depths that
we were able to reach, is buried in the deeper facies of the Q2, where the Early
Archaic campers sought the concentrated resources at the valley confluence. As
the terrace land surface stabilized in the Middle Archaic, a BRM accumulated
over a long period of time, with only occasional, thin alluvial deposits interrupting the anthropogenic soil development. As the river channel continued to aggrade, increased surface stability at Blue Hole compressed the Transitional
Archaic and Late Prehistoric archeological record into a palimpsest, or very thin
layer, atop the terrace surface.

SITE STRATIGRAPHY
Except for occasional instances of rodent or surficial disturbances, the
projectile points recovered from Blue Hole are indicative of excellent temporal
stratification, according to the generally accepted South Central Texas chronologies (cf. Black and McGraw 1985). Although no obvious stratigraphy or clearly
defined occupation floors were evident, the burned rock concentrations, the
geomorphological deposition, the recovery of diagnostic projectile points, and
other temporally significant artifacts show a well defined vertical sequence from
the Late Prehistoric through the Middle Archaic. Cultural material was still being
recovered through the deepest excavated levels, but restrictions on the length of
time we could pursue the excavations prevented continuing the excavations into
possible earlier occupation periods. However, the core samples taken to 3 m
below the floor of selected excavated units displayed no marked color changes
within the Q2 alluvium. The radiocarbon date associated with the hearth in
Feature 6 (discussed below) also substantiates the stratigraphic record.
To visually reconstruct site deposition patterns, the data regarding the
burned rock, chert debitage, and Rabdotus (the predominant, large land snails)
recovered from levels in units on the designated N106 and W110 lines were

22

Texas Archeological Society

plotted by computer onto cross-sections of the units.~ Concentrations of these
artifacts in the units or levels which were not excavated (those not excavated
are shaded in the plot of diagnostic artifacts in Figures 9, 11, and 13) were interpolated from the immediately adjacent units. In addition, the 268 diagnostic
projectile points, and all of the "semi-unique" items, were plotted onto similar
cross-sections to examine changes through time in each of the excavation areas
by artifact type. The left column of the following plots designates the 10 cm
levels measured relative to the site’s primary vertical datum. The burned rock
scattergrams (4 dots = 1 kg), and the unique item plots, are shown as follows:
N106 - W86-W98 (Figures 8-9); N106 - W98-W110 (Figures 10-11); and W110
- N94-N106 (Figures 12-13). Table 2 indexes each of the diagnostic point types
to the figures.
Based on the plotting onto the cross-sectional views of the diagnostic
projectile points (see Figures 9, 11, and 13), the burned rock accumulations (see
Figures 8, 10, and 12), and the soil color changes noted in the unit level records,
lines were drawn onto the cross-views to segregate the undefined strata of the site
into the following chronological/cultural levels:

Late Prehistoric (after A.D. 700): this period is represented by the
cultural materials extending downward from the ground surface to the
first (uppermost) solid line (A) drawn across the profiles. No historic
artifacts were recovered in the uppermost deposits of the site.
Late Archaic (A.D. 700 through 1000 B.C.): this period is represented
by the area between lines A and B. The Transitional Archaic (A.D.
700 through 300 B.C.) was not considered in establishing Line A since
the predominant points attributed to the Transitional Archaic in this
geographic area are the Frio/Ensor types, which are the focus of a
separate analysis later in this paper. These Frio and Ensor types displayed much variation within the otherwise clear site stratigraphy.
Middle Archaic (1000 B.C. through 2500 B.C.): this period is represented by the area below line B. A few Paleoindian and Early Archaic
points were recovered in these Middle Archaic deposits.

Units on the designated lines NI06 and W110 were subjected to in-depth laboratory
and interpretational analysis since these units were the focus of the excavations. All other
artifacts recovered from the first day’s excavations of the disturbed areas, from units
adjacent to the N106 and W! 10 units, or from the geomorphological units, were retained
unprocessed and are stored at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory for future
research purposes.

To define lines A and B, paramount consideration was given to the
diagnostic projectile points, since they most clearly define the temporal
occupations. There is ambiguity in the placement of line A, because the primary
Transitional Archaic markers (Ensor (E) and Frio (F) types) displayed temporal
variation. Using transparencies of Figures 8, 10, and 12, the burned rock
scattergrams were then superimposed over those of the diagnostic projectile
points, and the lines were adjusted slightly at various places to distinguish:
o Lighter accumulations of burned rock in the Middle Archaic with occasional
heavier concentrations due to hearth formations.
¯ The main burned rock accumulation in the Late Archaic, virtually uninterrnpted by alluvial deposition.
o Some scattered burned rock in the Late Prehistoric period.
The lines, A and B, thus established were then compared to similar charts
denoting the matrix color at the bottom of each unit level, and the hand drawn
profiles of the unit walls (on file at TARL). Other than minor strata with light
Q1 or Q0 facies deposition, or root or rodent disturbances, no additional
differences were noted to warrant further adjustment of the A and B lines.

There were a few anomalies noted in the otherwise consistent stratigraphy.
In the N106 line at W106-108, three dart projectile points (Plainview (S), Nolan
(O), and La Jita (N)) were recovered in Late Prehistoric deposits. The level notes
indicate a high degree of rodent disturbance in this area and at depths that were
characterized by very little burned rock and a fine loamy soil. Conversely,
N106W106 yielded three Late Prehistoric projectile points from level 6 (99.4099.30). The unit level records, however, clearly indicate two major animal burrows, with radii of approximately 15 cm, extending vertically through the unit,
intermixing lighter Q2 matrix with Late Prehistoric deposits.
In the W110 line at N97-99, two Pedernales (K) and a Uvalde (Q) are
clearly transposed into or near the Late Prehistoric strata. While the unit level
records mention no major rodent disturbances at these levels, it is possible they
were intermingled with the later strata by animals, or people, during later periods. The Perdiz (A) found in level 7 (99.10-99.00) of N98W110 was noted as
"possibly from a cave-in of an adjacent unit" at the surface level. Root and
rodent disturbances were noted in N96W110, level 10, which produced an
Edwards (D) point. Based on the general stratigraphy established by the 268
diagnostic projectile points (see Figures 9, 11, and 13) and the other relative
data, these anomalies do not detract from the overall reconstructed cultural
stratigraphy at Blue Hole.

THE ARTIFACTS
Artifacts recovered from the excavation of the units on the intersecting
N106 and Wll0 lines were separated into the following broad categories:
Chipped Stone Artifacts (including typologically diagnostic Projectile Points,
Other Stone Tools, and Chert Debitage), and Other Artifacts. This section briefly
describes the various classes of artifacts under each of these categories, in
addition to the Molluscan remains recovered from the units.

Chipped Stone Artifacts
Projectile Points
The 268 typologically diagnostic projectile points recovered from the intersecting N106 and W110 trenches were generally sorted using Turner and Hester
(1985). Those projectile points which were not clearly identifiable as a particular
type were included as distal, proximal, or other bifacial fragments in plotting the
"Semi-Unique" Items in "Other Stone Tools." Where specimens were incomplete, and it was possible to reasonably estimate the quantitative measurements
but weight of the complete specimen, those estimations were made. Weights
shown are in grams and are abbreviated as WT. All measurements are in mm

width; and, MT: maximum thickness. References to "Unique Item" numbers
exceed the 268 diagnostic items since a total of 514 artifacts were logged as
"Unique Items," including those not from the main excavation units, and nondiagnostic artifacts which evidenced particularly meaningful relationships to
other diagnostic artifacts and features.

Arrowpoints
Sixty-six arrowpoints were found, including Perdiz, Sabinal, Scallorn, and
Edwards (Figure 14). The Late Prehistoric occupation at the Blue Hole site was
generally compressed into surficial strata (see Figures 9, 11, and 13), and no
major Late Prehistoric features or other meaningful cultural aggregations were
discovered; thus, there was no clear separation between them as at the La Jita
excavations (Hester 1971).
Perdiz (13 specimens). Perdiz points characteristically have barbed
shoulders and sharply pointed, contracting stems. They vary considerably in size
and shape and the specimen shown in Figure 14 has a broad stem and is
considerably larger than the others. Most of these specimens were broken and

workmanship. WT: 0.7-2.8; L: 19-46; MW: 10-20; SW: 4-8; MT: 2-4.
Sabinal (20 specimens). These long, narrow triangular points have stongly
concave blade edges. The heavy barbs flare outward and often curve upward, as
in U.I. #298. The slightly expanding stems have deep, rather wide basal notches.

but two of the specimens were 3 mm thick. WT: 0.5-3.2; L: 13-48; MW: 11-24;
SW: 5-10; MT: 1-4.
Scallorn (6 specimens). These are comer or side-notched points with
straight to slightly convex lateral edges and well-barbed shoulders. The expanding stem varies from a broad, wedge-shaped, convex base (U.I.s #486 and #357) to a narrower, concave base (U.I. #215). Three of the specimens were unifacial.
WT: 0.9-1.5; L: 21-30; MW: 14-16; SW: 8-15; MT: 2-3.
Edwards (27 specimens). The Edwards points are sharply pointed and have
straight lateral edges; some are serrated (see Figure 14: U.I. #147). The prominent shoulders are sharply pointed, and the stem is deeply divided and flares
outward. Most of the specimens exhibited fine workmanship, from the straight
triangular blades, deep comer notches, to the flaring stems. Their similarity to a
scaled down version of the Frio dart point, noted by Sollberger (1967) and Hester
(1971:67), supports the placement of this type as the earliest arrowpoints in the

ranges in size were: WT: 7.8-37.0; L: 44-82; MW: 32-57; SW: 16-30; MT: 5-11.
However, the Marcos type had the most uniform morphological characteristics of
any point category, with all but a few falling within the following ranges: WT:
12-14; L: 60-66; MW: 36-40; SW: 23-27; MT: 6-7.
Castroville (8 specimens). They have extremely symmetrical, triangular
bodies with long, basal-notched barbs, straight stems, and straight lateral edges.
All of the specimens were characterized by extraordinarily fine workmanship
and are exceptionally thin for their relative size. The Castroville points are
sometimes associated with bison kills (Dibble and Lorrain 1968; Collins 1968).
The overall ranges were: WT: 15.0-34.5; L: 66-116; MW: 42-52; SW: 21-28:
MT: 5-8. The three Castroville points found in association with an apparently
deliberate cache in Feature 7 are described below.

Montell (38 specimens). The Montell’s from Blue Hole are triangular

points with relatively short stems with V- or U-shaped basal notches. They have
straight lateral edges and the strong shoulders are usually barbed, at least prior
to reworking. Most of the Montell points conformed to a standard pattern and

had finer workmanship than their temporal predecessor, the Pedernales. Almost
all of the specimens were 6 mm thick, although two were 3 and 10 mm thick.
Much like the Pedernales, some specimens exhibited a great deal of reworking
(see Figure 15). WT: 8.0-28.0; L: 42-86; MW: 28-50; SW: 18-30; MT: 3-10.
Marshall (11 specimens). These broad triangular points have strongly convex to rounded lateral edges, and strong shoulders that are deeply barbed (Figure
16). The relatively short, expanding stems have slightly concave bases. Flute-like
flakes were removed in stem thinning. WT: 8.8-26.0; L: 44-73; MW: 33-49; SW:
17-30; MT: 5-9.
Pedernales (52 specimens). These long points are characterized by a
bifurcated stem with a deep basal concavity. This was the predominant point
type at the Blue Hole site and was almost invariably found with the deeper and
earliest concentrations of burned rock. They exhibited considerable variation
from the broader, initial Pedernales product (U.I. #441 in Figure 17) to the
narrower, or shorter, later stages of reworked Pedernales. Some of the specimens
have strong barbs while others have almost rounded shoulders. The stem remains
rather uniform throughout the type. Although none were found at the Blue Hole
site, several reworked Pedernales drills or perforators were found at the Smith
site (Smith 1990). WT: 5.7-36.0; L: 41-85; MW: 29-51; SW: 15-27; MT: 5-9.
Kinney (7 specimens). This elongated point has convex edges with a slightly
to deeply concave base (see Figure 16). The basal corners vary from sharply
pointed (U.I. #348) to rounded (U.I. #318). WT: 9.5-32.0; L: 57-90; MW: 26-34;
SW: 23-27; MT: 6-9.
Langtry (1 specimen). This specimen is thin and has straight lateral edges
and strong shoulders with a pointed stem (see Figure 16). It has been reworked
and the stem varies from the Langtry’s generally straight to concave base. WT:
10.4; L: 60; MW: 44; SW: 16; MT: 6.
La Jita (1 specimen). The La Jita point has an expanded stem with a
slightly concave base; both the corners of the stem and the shoulders have been
rounded (Figure 18). WT: 11.9; L: 56; MW: 32; SW: 26; MT: 7.
Nolan (2 specimens). These points have long lateral edges that are straight
to convex, with tapered shoulders. One specimen has the steep, alternate beveling
on the stem edges which is characteristic of this type. Respective quantitative
measurements are: WT: 12.5 & 11.2; L: 65 & 63; MW: 25 & 24; SW: 20 & 15;
MT: 7 & 7.
Martindale (1 specimen). With prominent shoulders and short barbs
formed by corner-notching, this point’s most distinguishing feature is its concave "fishtail" base (see Figure 18). WT: 7.8; L: 44; MW: 32; SW: 23; MT: 7.
Uvalde (2 specimens). The two specimens have triangular bodies with
prominent shoulders or barbs. The stems vary from slightly expanding (U.I.
#177) to flaring (U.I. #293), with concave bases (see Figure 18). Measurements
are: WT: 3.9 & 10.4; L: 31 & 51; MW: 25 & 31; SW: 16 & 20; MT: 5 & 6.
Early Triangular (2 specimens). These triangular points have careful

convex, alternately-beveled lateral edges (see Figure 18). The measurements of

geomorphological test units was not measured.

Plainview (1 specimen). This specimen has a fragmented base but exhibited
the parallel flaking and basal grinding characteristic of this Paleoindian type (see
Figure 18). It was recovered out of context in the Late Prehistoric zones of the
excavation. WT: 9.5; L: 62; MW: 17; SW: 17; MT: 7.

Frio/Ensor Typology
A major problem with South Central Texas projectile point chronologies
is the broad temporal distribution of the Frio type points. Turner and Hester
(1985:100) describe the Frio point’s modal attributes as "a triangular body, often short and broad, with wide side or corner notches and a concaval basal indentation that ranges from shallow to a deep U-shaped notch" and place it in
the "Transitional Archaic, ca. 200 B.C.-A.D. 600 (or later)." Similarly, they
define the Ensor points as:
varying considerably in all dimensions, but broad stems, shallow side
notches and generally straight bases tend to identify the type. Specimens with a U-shaped basal notch are sometimes called Ensor-Frio.
Typology is frequently difficult because there appears to be much
gradation of basal forms from Frio to Ensor (Turner and Hester
(1985:94).
Again, it is placed in the Transitional Archaic period.
The excavation at Blue Hole, however, produced points with these general
stylistic characteristics at levels clearly attributable to periods ranging from the
Late Prehistoric through the Middle Archaic. Thus, the value of these types as
historical time markers requires refinement and redefinition of generally accepted lithic typologies when new excavations or different analytical methods
enable such refinements. Redefining the temporal or geographic focus of a projectile point type must be evaluated on a progressive basis. Because of the broad
temporal range of the Frio and Ensor types at the Blue Hole Site, further analyses were performed to determine if discrete groups of Frio and Ensor points
could be defined that have specific temporal implications.

Stylistic Analysis

The 59 Frio/Ensor points recovered were segregated into four stylistic categories, based on their basal configuration (Figures 19-22) as follows:
Group I (4 specimens): A broad triangular point with moderate concave
edges, a concave base, and long barbs formed by corner-notching.
Group 2 (12 specimens): Generally as tong as wide, this traditional "Ensor"
form evidences broad stems, shallow side notches, and generally straight
bases.

Frio type.
In establishing the chronology of the Blue Hole site earlier, the Transitional
Archaic was not segregated into distinct strata since no clear delineation could
be made. Rather, all of the Frio and Ensor types, which are the main time marker

Castroville points. The Group 1 point in the Wll0 trench was also
found in Level 6, consistent with the Marcos/Castroville strata (see
Figures 24-25).

2)

Group 2 occurs in the Transitional Archaic deposits. This Ensor type may
be the successor to Group 3, which appears in earlier deposits at the Blue
Hole site.

3)

Groups 3 and 4 have a much broader temporal distribution than Groups 1
and 2. Group 3 is probably a Late Archaic diagnostic, but Group 4, the
commonly accepted Frio type, appears to co-occur with Pedernales points
at the Blue Hole site in the Middle Archaic deposits. Group 4 forms
continue through the Transitional Archaic in numbers too substantial, and
with a distribution too consistent, to attribute it to prehistoric "collecting"
or "reuse."

Quantitative Analysis
As an alternative method to the stylistic groupings, the 59 Frio/Ensor points
were also weighed (grams) and then measured (ram) along several parameters,
such as length, width, thickness, stem length, stem width, stem thickness, and
neck width (data on file at TARL). Measurements of the artifacts were estimated
if the specimens were incomplete. Measurement ranges were then compared by
group: Group 1 tended to be very large and heavy and Group 3 tended to be
smaller and lighter in size. No correlations were derived from these measurements. The quantitative data base was then computer processed to search for
correlations to support or negate the stylistic grouping, or to possibly suggest
alternate groupings.
Pearson’s R (Product-Moment correlation) on all 59 specimens revealed
no strong correlations that were not previously evident in the data. The anticipated high positive correlations between such measurements as maximum thickness and weight, stem width and neck width, or length and weight, were
confirmed for the entire class, but no less obvious correlations were revealed.
Similar analyses were then performed for each stylistic group, 1 through 4, with
specific results of the one-to-one measurement correlations as follows:
Group 1: Generally very high correlations, all of which were positive,
except for neck width.
Group 2: Very high correlations to all variables. As a type, this
traditional Ensor evidences the most consistent similarities and
correlations.

38

Texas Archeological Society
Group 3: Wide variation due to fluctuations in size, length, and width.
All correlations remained positive except for stem width.
Group 4: Wide variation similar to Group 3, due to size variation. But
again, the stem width, length, and thickness scored high correlations
and were very consistent; all correlations were positive.
The data were then subjected to multivariant discriminant analyses, which

evaluates the characteristics of each group and places a quantitative correlation
coefficient for the similarity of each individual artifact to the overall attributes of
the groups. As with Pearson’s R, the assignment of consistent values to each of
the variables, where weight, length, and width tend to vary considerably within

meaningful correlations are derived. Yet the statistical analyses yielded the

larger than usual stem length and width in proportion to the rest of the
projectile point.

While very strong correlations within the groups were not anticipated due
to variation in the size and weight of points within the Frio/Ensor groups, the
overall results were generally supportive of the stylistic form classification.
Although the size and weight differentials were anticipated to skew the results
somewhat, they were nevertheless included in the attribute analyses. Purposeful
exclusion of unfavorable data would merely have resulted in "forcing" the
correlations.

Relative Geographical Studies
The recognition of stylistic and temporal variation in the Frio~nsor types
is nothing new. Suhm and Jelks (1962) identified four stylistic variations, calling
them Edgewood, Ensor, Fairland and Frio, dating them from as early as 3000
B.C. to A.D. 1000. Turner and Hester (1985) continue to recognize all four
points as distinct types (partially due to their varied geographical distribution),
but place them uniformly in the Transitional Archaic (200 B.C.-A.D. 600) or
later.

44

Texas Archeological Society

Hester (1971) divided 28 specimens from the La Jita site into Edgewood,
Ensor, and Frio types with six sub-varieties. Highley et al. (1978) split 19 Ensor
types into six sub-varieties from the Scorpion Cave excavations. At Panther
Springs Creek, Black and McGraw (1985) recovered 77 specimens identified as
Edgewood, Ensor, Fairland, and Frio, along with several more unnamed classes
of "side- and corner-notched triangular," and placed all of them in the Transitional Archaic period occupation of the site.
Lukowski (1987:217-220) identified 36 projectile points from four Uvalde
County sites in the Leona River Watershed as Edgewood, Ensor (two varieties),
Fairland, and Frio, and placed them chronologically in the Late through Transitional Archaic periods. Katz (1987:110-112) grouped the 39 Ellis, Ensor,
Fairland, and Frio points from 41BX300 into local period 9, A.D. 200-600.
Hall et al. (1986), in the Choke Canyon project, recognized several unnamed specimens of "large expanding stem," in addition to the 17 points placed
into the Ensor and Fairland types. Two of the points that Hall et al. (1986) called
the Ensor type came from deposits radiocarbon dated to 100 B.C. and A.D. 590,
quite consistent with the stratigraphic placement of Blue Hole Group 2 (traditional Ensor) in the Transitional Archaic (see Figures 23-25).
No other reports from the general area have as clear a stratigraphical record
as the Blue Hole site in chronologically placing a broad range of projectile
points. Heavy disturbance, consistent with caves, hampered dating of the Scorpion Cave archeological record and associated projectile points. Panther Springs
Creek deposits, in addition to being heavily disturbed, were vertically compressed, thus rendering the separation of temporal zones difficult. The Choke
Canyon sites were also generally compressed, and none of the single site excavations yielded the quantity and temporal diversity of diagnostic projectile points
that have been successfully used to establish the relative chronology at the Blue
Hole site.

Summary of the Frio/Ensor Analyses
These analyses have been presented to improve the definition of the Frio
and Ensor projectile point types. Though they are far from conclusive, the group
differentiation of temporal placement during the excavations, and the substantiation of modal similarities with the statistical studies, clearly warrant future
classificatory attention when planning and performing excavations and lithic
analysis in the South Central Texas area. The question of whether the variation
between defined Groups 1-4 should be categorized as types, varieties, or related
varieties, I will leave to the typologists who have spent years reviewing the
temporal and geographical variation of the broad range of projectile points to
understanding Texas prehistoric hunter-gatherers.

Henry E. Mueggenborg ~ Excavations at the Blue Hole Site

The goal and intent of this section has been merely to clarify the descriptive varieties of Frio/Ensor projectile points and their temporal significance. We
must insure that the temporal and spatial placement of projectile points are as
valid and up-to-date as possible. The purely descriptive analyses performed here,
along with continued excavation and analyses of new sites and data, should help
place the Frio and Ensor types more accurately in the South Central Texas chronological framework.

Other Stone Tools
"Semi-Unique" Items
The category of "semi-unique" items was designated for all non-diagnostic projectile points, bifacial fragments, and other worked stone from the Blue
Hole site. All of the "semi-unique" items were reviewed in the laboratory and
were grouped into the fol!owing categories: 1) Distal Projectile Point Fragments,
2) Proximal Projectile Point Fragments, 3) Other Bifacial Fragments, 4) Preforms, 5) Modified or Utilized Flakes, and 6) Cores.There were 469 semi-unique
specimens. They were then plotted onto the cross-sections of the units, similar
to the previous plots of the burned rock, and those of the diagnostic projectile
points (Figures 26-28).
The general concentration of the "semi-unique" items was then compared
in transparent overlays to the cross-sectional views of the burned rock and lithic
debitage (see the following). A very direct correlation was evident between the
"semi-unique" items and chert debitage. Conversely, burned rock concentrations
bore a very indirect relationship with the "semi-unique" items and the debitage.
This indirect relationship was even more pronounced than that between diagnostic projectile points and the burned rock. Again, lines A and B were drawn
onto the cross-sectional profiles that establish the relative stratigraphy of the site.

Distal Projectile Point Fragments
There were 79 distal fragments recovered. They were not further distinguished as to general size, thickness, or representative portion of the original
projectile point. The cross-sections indicate that most of the distal tips were
recovered from the deepest Late Prehistoric strata (which overlies the concentrated burned rock midden on the W110 line and the westernmost five units of
the N106 line). Only three distal tips were recovered from the Late Prehistoric
strata in the 17 units to the east of W105 on the N106 line, whereas 32 were
recovered from the 15 units proceeding westward to W110 and then south on
the W110 line.

Proximal Projectile Point Fragments
Eleven proximal fragments were recovered that could not be placed into a
specific typological classification. Since almost all of the 268 diagnostic projectile points were nearly complete, most broken proximal fragments were probably
discarded at a hunting location and were seldom carried back to the site, which
was possibly used as a food processing location.

Other Bifacial Fragments
There were 211 unclassified bifacial fragments, in varying stages of reduction, in the units. No obvious trends or concentrations were evident either within
certain horizontal areas or in deposits of specific chronological periods. Since the
Blue Hole site served at least partially as a food processing location, these
fragments may have been either broken and discarded cutting or scraping tools,
or by-products of lithic manufacture at the processing location.

48

Texas Archeological Society

Preforms
There were 67 preforms in various stages of reduction. Again, no obvious
concentrations were evident. As with other biracial fragments, most of these
specimens were probably discarded at varying stages in the manufacturing process (Figures 29 and 30).

Modified or Utilized Flakes
There were 79 flakes which evidenced utilization or wear. Their distribution
appears coincident to the heavier lithic scatters and to that of the diagnostic
projectile points. As with other bifacial fragments, they may have been utilized
as cutting or scraping tools. No in-depth microscopy or chemical analyses have
yet been performed on the flakes to further determine their function.

Cores
Only 22 cores were recovered in the excavations. None was particularly
large or diagnostic regarding manufacturing/reduction processes. The low number of cores indicates that the Blue Hole site probably served as a lithic finishing station: preliminary manufacture was being performed on the raw material
at or near a lithic quarry, and the quarry blanks were generally brought to the
site for further reduction.

Miscellaneous Other Tools (Figure 31)
Certain stone artifacts were found which, although not typologically diagnostic, were rather typical of certain stone implements described in Turner and
Hester (1985). They include:
Friday Biface (Turner and Hester 1985:214) from N105W110, level 2. This
unstemmed, relatively thin, bifacially thinned knife has an approximately
straight base that has been thinned by the removal of several broad, thin
flakes. Its occurrence in the Late Prehistoric strata is consistent with its
known temporal placement.
Probable side fragment of a Corner-Tang Biface from N103W110, level 7.
Although the specimen is incomplete, it appears to be the convex-edged,
lateral portion of the tool. This type of tool is common to South Central
Texas, and its placement in Late Archaic deposits at the Blue Hole site is
consistent with its assumed age (Turner and Hester 1985:210-211).
o Perforator/Drill from NI03Wll0, level 11. Characterized by a long and
tapered bit that is diamond-shaped in cross-section, this bifacially flaked

N105W95, level 9, and N106W109, level 9 (see Figure 31, bottom row).
Stratigraphically, this places all of the hammerstones in the Middle Archaic
period deposits at the site.

Overall Plot

The number of flakes per unit was computer plotted onto the cross-sections
of the units (Figures 32-34). As stated earlier, the plots bore a very direct
relationship to that of the "semi-unique" items and a very indirect, or inverse,
relationship to the burned rock. It is apparent, when comparing the burned rock
densities with the debitage concentrations, that the activities which created the
two artifact classes are basically mutually exclusive. It appears, returning to
Hester’s (1971) "rubble dump" concept, that during the Middle through Late
Archaic, the Blue Hole site inhabitants periodically cleared the cooking area of
all cracked rocks and other debris and deposited it on the slightly elevated mound
of refuse 8-10 m away. This would account for the relatively minimal deposition
of debitage and other lithic artifacts within the burned rock midden proper.

Detailed Debitage Analysis
Five 1 meter units were selected for more detailed analysis of the chert
debitage: N105W86, N105W95, N106W104, N106W110, and N94W110. The
purpose was to determine if the flake debris from varying areas of the excava-

tion units would indicate that different kinds of chert manufacturing/reduction
activities occurred across the site, and, in the same light, if temporal changes
could be noted.
The flakes were sorted, by 10 cm unit level, into the following categories:
1)

Primary cortex (596 flakes): resulting from the removal of the cortex from
the nodule. Generally 60-80 percent of the surface is covered with cortex.

2)

Secondary cortex (1990 flakes): the dorsal face retains some cortex but
also has one or more flake removals.

3)

Interior or tertiary flakes (1540 flakes): no cortex on either surface as they
have been removed from the interior of the core.

4)

Biface thinning or lipped flakes (920 flakes): the result of biface thinning
activities, these have an overlapping or lipped striking platform on a rather
diffuse bulb of percussion.

5)

Miscellaneous chips and fragments (14,185 flakes): any items which could
not be placed in categories 1-4.
The flakes (N=19,231) were counted and weighed (in total by category) for

each unit level. Of this number, only 5,046, or 26.3 percent were placed into
categories 1-4 above. While part of the reason for the high frequency of Category
5 debitage is possibly due to reasonably inexperienced lab personnel, these
results are not inconsistent with Hester’s (1971:109) analysis of the debitage at
La Jita: 32 percent of all flakes fell into into categories 1-4.
Further analysis of the debitage from these selected units, and all of the
excavation units, may provide greater insight into the temporal and areal character of the lithic industry at the site. It should be noted, however, that the use of 1/
4-inch screen during the excavations prevented the collection of possibly large
amounts of micro-debitage. However, column samples were taken from each of
the levels from the five selected units and these are also curated at TARL.

OTHER ARTIFACTS
A number of other interesting cultural items were found in the west end of
the N106 trench. They include:

a) A marine gastropod shell bead found in association with the Castroville
cache in N106W110, level 6 (Figure 35a). The shell has a perforation,
apparently man-made, through the outer whorl near the aperture, presumably to facilitate stringing. It is identified as a Prunuum (leptegouana)
apicina, and it originates on the Texas Gulf coast. Six similar beads were
recovered from the Choke Canyon excavations (Highley 1986:75) in Archaic occupational zones. The Castroville cache at the Blue Hole site is
within the Late Archaic deposits.

Henry E. Mueggenborg ~ Excavations at the Blue Hole Site

b)

55

A small polished stone bead was found in N106W110, level 4 (Figure
35b). It was obviously a jewelry item, either in a simple necklace or as a
bead in a more ornate arrangement. Highly polished, the bead had been
drilled from both sides, and lateral grooves had further been filed into it.
The bead was recovered from Late Prehistoric deposits.

c)

A worked and cut bone bead came from N106W104, level 9 (Figure 35c).
The tubular bead had a dull polish, probably from wear, and had been
manufactured by the groove and snap technique. The species of animal for
the bone was not identified. The specimen was recovered from the lowest
Late Archaic strata.

d)

A cut and decorated bone artifact fragment, probably of bison rib, with a
symmetrical configuration of small, shallow pits drilled into it, was found
in N106W101, level 4 (Figure 35d). Miller and Jelks (1952:185) reported
two similar bone objects, although they were larger and with less
decoration, associated with burials near the Belton Reservoir in Coryell
County. Suhm (1957:49) recovered another somewhat similar and, again,
much larger, bone object at the Smith Rockshelter in Travis County. None
of these evidenced the intentional, symmetrical drilling as in this specimen.
These three artifacts were attributed to Late Prehistoric period occupations,
whereas the Blue Hole specimen was recovered from the most recent Late
Archaic strata. The items may have some ritualistic significance, or may

have been used as gaming pieces, but no conclusive interpretations are
offered as to their function.

e) A broken stone pendant was recovered from N106W110, level 3, in Late
Prehistoric strata. The unpolished flat stone appeared to have been ground
on the sides and was biconically drilled in two places (Figure 35e).

FAUNAL AND MOLLUSCAN REMAINS
No significant vertebrate skeletal remains were recovered. Some occasional
bison and deer bone were found in the Late Prehistoric deposits, especially in the
upper three levels at the west end of the N106 trench. A large bison tooth was
found in general association with the Castroville cache discussed below. No bone
accumulations or spatial concentrations were identified which lent meaningful
associations with features or artifacts recovered from the Blue Hole site.
Land snails were recovered, generally in high concentrations, throughout
the Blue Hole excavations. The uppermost level or two of each unit generally
produced very few snail shells whereas many unit levels contained nearly 1,000
of the shells (level 5 of N105W89 produced 1,100 Rabdotus shells; Figure 36).
In all, 100,000 to 150,000 Rabdotus were recovered from the units. Rabdotus
were the predominant land snails recovered in TAS excavations (over 95 percent

of total snail count), but use of the 1/4-inch screen suggests that the other smaller
species (Helicina, Rumina decollata, Polygyra, and Helisoma) may have been
overlooked. While the laboratory records reflect the counts of each species by
unit level, only those of the Rabdotus were plotted on the cross-sections (Figures
36-38).
Due to the heavy concentrations of land snails in the matrix of most BRMs,
it has been proposed that prehistoric hunter-gatherers collected and utilized these
snails as a dietary supplement. Hall et al. (1982:470) support this hypothesis
based on the very high protein count of the Rabdotus. Ethnohistoric accounts
(Campbell and Campbell 1981:17) corroborate the consumption of land snails in
the summer months by South Texas groups. Highley (1986:87-88) recounts that
Rabdotus occur in concentrated colonies of up to an acre in size and that these
nocturnal foragers seek cover from the daylight heat under rocks and logs, or by
affixing themselves to plant stems.
The dietary supplement hypothesis is certainly supported by their ready
availability, their high protein, and the ethnohistorical record. It would have been
a relatively simple task to collect them and process them at an area where other
types of food processing was already taking place. It is also possible that some of
the land snails were simply drawn to the sites because of the rich floral and
faunal debris, and the subsequent anthropogenic soil development, associated
with a cooking site. While any long term experiment to evaluate the natural
accumulation of land snails relative to cooking debris could never duplicate the
span of 3,000 years or so that these sites accumulated, it would be interesting to
test a plot over several seasons to determine the residual accumulation of the
snail shells.
Regardless of the reason for the Rabdotus presence, the trench overlays
show that the heavier concentrations of snails generally overlie the dense burned
rock concentrations and are not coincident to them (see Figures 8, 10, and 12
and Figures 36-38). While the Rabdotus’ relationship to the burned rock is not
as strongly inverse as that of the debitage to the burned rock, there is no positive relationship. Thus, it would have been the case that the Rabdotus were not
an integral part of the cooking process that created the burned rock concentrations. Furthermore, the co-occurrence of the Rabdotus in the BRM and nonmidden deposits, both vertically and horizontally, seems to indicate the natural
introduction of the snails to the occupation deposits.
In my opinion, an inordinate amount of time was spent in the laboratory
counting the snails from the unit levels. Since the Rabdotus recovered from the
Blue Hole site were rather uniform in size, the same meaningful comparisons
could have been obtained by volumetrically measuring (e.g., 1 cup = 100
Rabdotus) the snails at the site and discarding them. Occasional tests to determine the accuracy of the estimates would insure that the data recorded remained
within the 90-95 percent range of accuracy. A unit or two could then be selected
for later, in-depth analysis.

FEATURES
Descriptions
Seven features, five hearths, a cache of Castroville dart points, and an
unidentified "pavement lens," were identified in the Blue Hole excavations. It
is possible that in situ hearths may have been unrecognized in the areas and
levels of extremely dense burned rock, but the matrix and excavation methods
in the other areas were such that any atypical rock concentrations should have
been noted. The seven recorded features, briefly described below, are not
plotted to the cross-views of the units, but reference to the burned rock and
projectile point plots in Figures 8-13 will place the features within the established stratigraphy.

Feature 1, N98W110, levels 2-3.
This configuration of limestone rocks was about 50 cm in diameter and
consisted mainly of larger rocks 8-15 cm in diameter. The matrix within 1 or 2
cm of the hearth was a slightly lighter, greyish soil and was harder than the
general matrix of the unit, indicating probable heat alteration. There were no
large pieces of charcoal in association with the hearth, but matrix samples were
taken (not analyzed) for flotation and pollen analysis. An Edwards and a
Pedernales point were found in the level above the hearth but were not in
association with it. Stratigraphically, the hearth appears at the top of the dense
burned rock concentration and, based on the cultural stratigraphy, can be placed
at the top of the Late Archaic deposits.

Feature 2, NIO1W110, levels 10-11.
Only the westernmost part of this hearth was exposed, with the main body
of the hearth apparently lying in unit N101W109 (unexcavated) to the east. It
consisted of six large rocks 8-15 cm in diameter, and about 15 smaller rocks, and
it was about 75 cm wide. No charcoal was present, and the matrix around the
hearth was not different from that above or below the hearth. No special samples
were taken. A Pedernales point was recovered from level 11, but was not in
direct association with the hearth. This hearth occurs in the Middle Archaic
deposits, part of the earliest occupations which contributed to the BRM.

Feature 3, N98W110, level 10.
Feature 3 was a dense "pavement lens" separating the black matrix of the
BRM and the underlying lighter Q2 deposits. There was no charcoal associated
with the feature. It consisted of several, unusually large, flat rocks, the two

60

Texas Archeological Society

largest of which measured 25 x 22 x 10 cm and 29 x 32 x 4 cm, respectively. The
intervals between the 15 or so larger flat rocks were almost completely filled in
with smaller rocks 5-10 cm across. The yellow color of the Q2 alluvium was
evident upon removal of this "pavement lens."
A Frio and a Kinney point were found directly on the upper surface of this
tens. Samples were taken for flotation and pollen, but have not yet been analyzed. This feature dates to the Middle Archaic.
Unit N98W110 was selected for continued excavations over Labor Day, and
it was taken 80 cm deeper. While the matrix continued to lighten through level
12, it then became gradually darker through level 15, when it resumed the natural
lightening in color with depth. This suggests that an alluvial episode in the
Middle Archaic interrupted the occupation of the site at about level 12. Occupation subsequent to the alluvial deposits then created the lens in Feature 3, as
seasonal activities resumed at the site.

Feature 4, N106W110, level 4
This was a shallow, bowl-shaped hearth, consisting of 17-18 medium-sized
rocks (5 x 10 cm) and four or five larger, flatter rocks (Figure 39). The central
part of the hearth contained no rocks for about 15 cm across. Overall, the hearth
would have been about 75-80 cm in diameter. The matrix at this level was a
loose, sandy loam without baked or hardened clay. Some small associated char-

Henry E. Mueggenborg ~ Excavations at the Blue Hole Site

coal pieces were retrieved as samples, and soil samples were taken from the
matrix immediately beneath the hearth. No diagnostic artifacts were found in
association with this feature. The hearth is within the Late Prehistoric strata and
is 20 cm above the Castroville cache (Feature 7).

Feature 5, N106W108, level 9.

This feature was a dark gray, circular anomaly, in the otherwise yellowish
brown Q2. Measuring about 35 cm in diameter, it was associated with small bits
of unburned bone and burned clay. Special samples were taken but have not been
analyzed. There were no rocks around the perimeter, but there was a concentration (10 kg) of burned rock to the east of the feature. In the same level, two
Pedernales points were recovered at approximately the same depth. This hearth
falls within the Middle Archaic strata, but is below the main BRM.

Feature 6, N94W110, level 13
Perhaps the most distinctive hearth unearthed during our excavations, this
slab-lined, basin-shaped burned limestone hearth was in the north half of the unit
and extended into N95W110 (Figure 40). Based on the thermal fracturing of the
stones, it appeared that the larger perimeter rocks had experienced horizontal

62

Texas Archeological Society

displacement of less than 0.25 cm. Furthermore, there were piles of smaller, fistsized, severely fractured rocks placed in two adjacent areas to the south of the
hearth; these appeared to have been removed from the hearth and purposefully
placed near it. The smaller groupings of rocks probably formed a cap over the
hearth during the cooking process, and, severely heat fractured, were removed at
completion. Two Pedernales points were found in direct association with the
hearth, and several nodules of charcoal, one piece approximately 2 cm across,
were retrieved.
Part of the larger piece of charcoal was submitted for radiocarbon assay at
The University of Texas Radiocarbon Laboratory and an absolute date of 3840 +
70 B.P. (TX-7057) was obtained. The calibrated date ranges (Stuiver and Reimer
1986) for the sample are 2468-2146 B.C. (4416-4096 B.P.). This is quite consistent with the stratigraphy, and the feature is attributed to the Middle Archaic. The
date range obtained also supports the chronological placement of the Pedernales
projectile point type at Blue Hole.

Feature 7, N106W110, level 6.
Two levels below the Late Prehistoric hearth (Feature 4), a Castroville point
(U.I. #434) was discovered in situ in the southeastern quadrant of the unit. After
it was removed and excavation continued, a rock concentration (Figure 41) was
identified immediately below it, which contained two more Castroville points

Figure 41. Castroville Point in situ in Feature 7 at N106W110, Level 6: U.I. #439.

Henry E. Mueggenborg -- Excavations at the Blue Hole Site

63

(U,I.s #437 and #439), a large preform (U.I. #444), and a marine shell. All of
these specimens are shown in Figure 42. A large bison tooth was recovered in
general association with the cache. To speculate on the significance of this
accumulation of artifacts, it is quite certain that they were placed in that
particular association by Late Archaic peoples; the cache may also have had
ritual significance. All of the points evidenced extremely fine workmanship and
may well have been manufactured by the same individual.

Archeomagnetic Sampling
The hearth identified as Feature 6 at N94W110, in addition to yielding the
charcoal samples for the radiocarbon assay discussed previously, was also subjected to archeomagnetic testing. The hearth features at the Smith Site, also
being excavated as a part of the TAS Field School, were a major focus of study,
and highly specialized coring equipment was used to retrieve and record samples
for laboratory testing. On the last day of the Labor Day excavations, a crew
brought the equipment to the Blue Hole site and retrieved eight cores from the
hearth limestone cobbles. The cores, approximately 2.5 cm in diameter, were
removed from selected in situ hearth stones and recorded so that their exact
physical orientation could be reconstructed in the laboratory.
While the location of magnetic north is near, over time, the location of
rotation north, secular variation takes magnetic north on excursions with variations up to 20 percent. Paleomagnetism is the study and reconstruction of the
history of the earth’s magnetic field. Simply put, whenever a rock is heated to
a certain point, it acquires a very stable permanent magnetism pointing in the
direction of magnetic north at the time the rock was so heated. Likewise, the
strength of the magnetism is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field.
This remnent magnetism is referred to as thermo-remnent magnetism (TRM).
All rocks which cool from high temperatures acquire a TRM and, provided this
remnent magnetism is not subsequently altered, they will carry the memory of
the magnetic field which caused the remnent magnetism (Strangway 1970).
The elements of the magnetic field which can be measured at any given
location are declination, the direction of magnetic north; inclination, the angle
of dip below the horizon; and intensity, total field strength. Archeomagnetism
applies these premises of paleomagnetism to the past few thousand years in tracing the secular variations in the magnetic field. The application in archeology is
twofold: first, in identifying the in situ status of hearths or kilns, and second, as
an eventual alternative absolute dating method.
By reconstructing the orientation of the hearth stones in the laboratory, the
declination, inclination, and intensity of each core can be extracted. If all cores
exhibit nearly identical plots of the natural remnent magnetization (NRM), it is
relatively certain that they were in fact heated simultaneously in either a single
heating or cooking episode. Further testing involves thermally demagnetizing

the samples by heating them in 50° C increments (in a controlled non-magnetic
environment) until the samples reach a higher component of magnetization. At
this higher temperature, a sample then assumes the magnetic properties of its
orientation at some point in time prior to its alteration in the heating episode, or
simply "reverts back" to what the NRM would have been if the sample had not
been thermally altered. This further enables the researcher to define the temperature reached in the stones during the cooking episode.

By associating absolute dates, using radiocarbon dating or other methods,
with a series of plots of NRMs for any given general geographic area, an
archeomagnetic path can be established. This route can then be used to plot and
date any future archeomagnetic sample, just as dendrochronology sequences are
now used. While an area curve for the Edwards Plateau area has not yet been
established, each of the samples that are dated will hopefully lead to an area
curve that will enable the accurate dating of future archeomagnetic samples from
the area.
The specific data obtained from the archeomagnetic samples from Feature
6 are provided in Table 3, and the plot of the NRMs is shown in Figure 43. The
samples from Feature 6 were further demagnetized in 50° C increments to 450°
C (The laboratory records are on file at the Paleomagnetic Laboratory of the
Department of Geological Sciences at The University of Texas at Austin). Similar archeomagnetic analyses have been performed on hearthstones from the
Camp Pearl Wheat site in Kerr County, Texas (Collins et al. 1990:69-78). The
results from the tests at the Smith site (41UV132) are reported in Smith (1990).
Since the laboratory records were not available for review, it is impossible
to collate the sample numbers assigned in the laboratory to the assignation of the
hearth stones. But it is most apparent from the plot of the NRMs that six of the
samples are in fact part of an in situ hearth with only very minimal subsequent
settling or alteration.

SUMMARY
The Blue Hole site (41UV159) is a prehistoric site occupied by the ancient
peoples of the Sabinal Valley over several thousand years. While the bulk of the
cultural deposits at the site occurred in the Archaic, the Late Prehistoric is also
represented along with one Late Paleoindian period artifact. The site is located
on an alluvial terrace on the east bank of the Sabinal River, about 13 km south of
Utopia, Texas, in Uvalde County. It was first recorded by the UT 1989 Summer
Archaeological Field School survey crews, and was selected for excavation as a
major part of the TAS 1990 Summer Field School.
The environment and resources near the Blue Hole site were major factors
in the selection of the site by prehistoric peoples. The occupations took place on
an elevated terrace within 100 m of the "Blue Hole," which was probably a deep,
year-long source of water. The stream beds provided an unlimited source of
stream-rolled limestone cobbles which were utilized in cooking tasks at the site.
The site’s location at the southern edge of the Balcones Escarpment placed the
varied resources and habitats of both the Edwards Plateau and the South Texas
Plains within reach of mobile prehistoric hunter-gatherers.
A major portion of the Blue Hole site consists of a burned rock midden, a
Central Texas phenomenon which is usually a large accumulation of fire-cracked
and discolored limestone. Though the specific origin of the burned rock midden

Henry E. Mueggenborg -- Excavations at the Blue Hole Site

67

continues to be debated among archeologists (Hester 1991), it appears that
groups congregated repeatedly at favored locations to engage in a cooking process
that used limestone which was then abandoned or discarded. Lithic artifacts are
common in and adjacent to these burned rock middens. UT survey crews learned
that the Blue Hole site had long been a favorite of local projectile point collectors,
and we anticipated a high artifact recovery rate in the excavations.
The initial strategy at Blue Hole was to excavate 2 m units along intersecting lines from beyond the perimeter of the midden accumulation into the midden
proper, thus giving a broad view of the burned rock concentrations as well as
any adjacent occupation areas. We also excavated several test units in perimeter areas to provide visiting geomorphologists the opportunity to develop the
alluvial chronology of the terrace. After determining that some of the initially
selected units had previously been dug by an artifact collector, the excavation
plan was shifted to avoid the disturbed areas, and resulted in two intersecting 1
m wide excavations.
The geomorphological interpretation of the terrace deposits suggests that
the site terrace was an accumulation of alluvial episodes which occurred in the
Early to Middle Holocene (10,000-5000 B.P.). The cultural deposits then formed
upon this reasonably stable landscape surface. This temporal estimate enabled us
to anticipate identifying cultural strata from the Middle Archaic, or possibly
Early Archaic, period with little likelihood of identifying any Paleoindian occupation zones in the TAS excavations. Later cores taken to 3 m below the floors of
selected units in the main excavation area confirmed the nature of the major
Early to Middle Holocene alluvial deposits.
As the excavations proceeded vertically, it was apparent that the relative
chronology of the Blue Hole site conformed closely to that established for South
Central Texas. However, anthropogenic soil development had generally erased
any natural stratification within the alluvial deposits, which might otherwise
have separated occupational strata in the profiles. In order to define occupational
strata, the 268 diagnostic projectile points recovered in the excavations of the 1
m intersecting lines were plotted onto unit cross-sections. Similar cross-sections
of the units were plotted for: Burned rock weight; Lithic debitage; Rabdotus;
"Semi-unique" items; and Frio/Ensor points. The computer plots of the burned
rock weight, the number of debitage flakes, and Rabdotus shells enabled internal
comparison of each of these remains with each other to evaluate the site
stratigraphy.
Projectile points recovered from the uppermost deposits included four types
of Late Prehistoric arrowpoints: Perdiz; Sabinal; Scallorn; and Edwards. Fiftynine Frio and Ensor type points were recovered, which are generally attributed to
the Transitional Archaic. However, because these types were unevenly dispersed
in the deposits, no differentiation of the Transitional Archaic was made at Blue
Hole. Separate analyses of the morphological attributes of the Frio and Ensor
specimens suggest grounds for internal temporal differentiation. Late Archaic
points included 64 Marcos, Castroville, and Montell projectile points, with

68

Texas Archeological Society

Montell the predominant marker for the Late Archaic period. Pedernales (52
specimens) was the primary type marking the Middle Archaic, along with an
additional 19 Marshall, Kinney, and Langtry points. There were seven Early
Archaic points (La Jita, Nolan, Martindale, Uvalde, and Early Triangular types).
The only Paleoindian type recovered was a Plainview, found out of context in the
Late Prehistoric deposits.
Other stone tools recovered from Blue Hole include a Friday Biface, a
probable corner-tang biface fragment, a perforator, and three cylindrical
hammerstones, one of petrified wood and two of limestone. Five decorative or
ritualistic artifacts were obtained from various deposits at the site.
Rabdotus, the main land snail recovered in the excavations, was examined
to determine their relationship to the artifacts. While no conclusive relationships
were established to support or discredit their role as "dietary supplements," this
data should help formulate further research designs regarding snails.
The Blue Hole site excavations identified seven distinct features: five
hearths, an apparent cache of Castroville projectile points, and an unidentified
"pavement lens." Of these features, the hearth (Feature 6), found in the deepest
excavations near the perimeter of the burned rock midden proper, was radiocarbon dated to between 2468-2146 B.C. (calibrated). Two Middle Archaic
Pedernales projectile points were in association. Archeomagnetic sampling of
the feature stones showed that it was an in situ hearth complex. The Late Archaic
Castroville cache (Feature 7) included a marine shell ornament.
The excavations at the Blue Hole site recovered an enormous amount of
data relative to the Middle through Late and Transitional Archaic periods, and
this analysis and future studies of the information should provide further insights
on the burned rock midden phenomenon and the prehistoric settlement of the
Sabinal Valley area. The cross-sectional analyses of the burned rock, lithic
debitage, and land snail concentrations can be used for comparison with those
of previous excavations in burned rock middens in South Central Texas, and,
hopefully, as a guide to plan and analyze future excavations in the region.
A tremendous amount of hard work by TAS members during the 1990 Field
School excavations contributed the data analyzed in this paper. The 60 members who returned to the Blue Hole site over Labor Day weekend to continue
with the excavation objectives completed the area needed for this partial reconstruction of the site’s cultural history. Their dedication and personal commitment at the Blue Hole site has added yet one more chapter to the reconstruction
of the lifeways of the prehistoric inhabitants of the area.
A great number of prehistoric sites in the upper Sabinal Valley were documented and recorded by the surveys conducted as part of the 1990 TAS Field
School. This area of Texas obviously contains some of the richest material
records of these early inhabitants, particularly during the general period of 5000
B.C. to the birth of Christ. It is incumbent upon the professional and avocational
archeologists to continue the investigation and documentation of the archeological record within this valley. It is similarly essential that the residents and land-

owners of this lovely valley protect the valuable cultural resources which are
preserved there.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The excavations at the Blue Hole Site were made possible by the hard work
and dedication of the Texas Archeological Society, and my first "thank you"
goes to the approximately 150 members who braved the June heat of 1990 in
South Central Texas to excavate the site. Also, thanks to the 60 members who
returned over Labor Day, thus filling in many of the parts of the puzzle. The
organization and logistic preparation by the TAS Board of Directors and the
Field School Committee enabled the excavations to progress efficiently.
I would like to thank Dr. Thomas R. Hester for his direction as the
excavation’s Principal Investigator, both in terms of technical expertise and
moral support. Special thanks also to Dr. James A. Neely, who with Dr. Hester,
assisted me on my thesis committee, and to Dr. Samuel M. Wilson, who assisted with the statistical analyses employed in the Frio/Ensor typology.
The property owner, Mary K. Kindred, was most gracious and cooperative, not only in granting us exclusive access to the site, but in tolerating our
dusty daily arrivals and departures. I sincerely hope this report enhances her
interest, along with that of sons Danny, Donny, and Douglas, in the archeology
and prehistory of their beautiful ranch.
The strongest and most consistent effort in the completion of this report was
made by TAS member Bob Vernon, who programmed and provided the computer reconstructions of the cultural deposition of the site, around which this
paper is focused. Besides his time and expense in working with me, his feedback
prior to the Labor Day session, and after the completion of the excavations, was
greatly appreciated.
