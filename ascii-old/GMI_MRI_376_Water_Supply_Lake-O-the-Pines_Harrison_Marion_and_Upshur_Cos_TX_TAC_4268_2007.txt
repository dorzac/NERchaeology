MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

The potential impact of the revised regional water supply system of Lake O’ The Pines Reservoir
as proposed by the Northeast Texas Municipal Water District (NETMWD) must be assessed prior
to implementation of the project. In February 2006, KSA Engineers, Inc., contracted GeoMarine, Inc. (GMI), to conduct the biological and archeological surveys for the revised portions
of the water treatment system. This work was undertaken in order to provide baseline
information in support of construction permit applications to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
(USACE), and for compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. The
revised plan necessitated the survey of 45,000 linear feet (8.5 miles) of newly proposed pipeline
corridor and included geoarcheological investigations in three different areas.
GMI archeologists initiated fieldwork on 28 September 2006 and concluded the survey on 31
October 2006. Initial review of the collected data upon return to GMI headquarters revealed
some of the originally proposed pipeline had been rerouted subsequent to an initial survey
conducted for this pipeline by GMI in 2003–2004. These reroutes, since they postdate the initial
survey, were never fully investigated; therefore it was required that these reroutes also be
surveyed. Thus, a second field effort was conducted from 1–5 December 2006 with the specific
goal of investigating nine identified reroutes, totaling an additional 16,600 linear feet (3.2 miles)
of survey including geoarcheological investigations within one of the reroutes.
In summary, a total of 61,600 ft (11.7 miles) of linear survey in combination with a 0.5-acre
booster site was surveyed. A total of 19 geoarcheological trenches was excavated in four
different areas (South Shore of Lake O’ The Pines, Walnut Creek Flood Plain, Little Cypress
Creek Flood Plain and within the vicinity of an unnamed eastern tributary of Walnut Creek).
All notes, forms, photographs, and artifacts obtained from the project are on file at the Texas
Archaeological Research Laboratory curation repository of the University of Texas in Austin.
As a result of this intensive survey, one new archeological site and 15 isolated finds were located
(41UR323) and six known sites (41GG65, 41MR4, 41MR161, 41MR262, 41UR7, and 41UR247)
were investigated or revisited. The one newly documented site (41UR323) is recommended as
being ineligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for
designation as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL). None of the previously documented sites
iii

are located within the Area of Potential Effects (APE). Fifteen nonsite localities were also
identified during the survey. All nonsite localities are ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for
designation as a SAL. In summary, the proposed revised Regional Water System will have no
adverse effect on historic properties in or near the APE.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

This report describes the results of an intensive pedestrian survey conducted along the proposed
route for the revised water treatment system in the vicinity of the Lake O’ The Pines Reservoir.
The development of this new water treatment facility in the region has undergone many changes
since inception. First, the Northeast Texas Municipal Water District (NETMWD) originally
proposed to undertake construction of a second regional water supply system south of Lake O’
The Pines Reservoir. Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), was originally contracted by KSA Engineers, Inc.
(KSA), the prime contractor, to conduct the biological and archeological survey of this originally
proposed second system in 2003-04. The work for this project, under Texas Antiquities Permit
Number #4268, was completed in June of 2004. However, as a cost saving mechanism, the
NETMWD recently revised the design and are now proposing to revamp and bolster the preexisting Mims Water Treatment Facility and associated system (Figure 1).
In February 2006, KSA Engineers, Inc., contracted GMI to conduct the biological and
archeological surveys (GMI Project #30442.00.02.02) for the revised portions of the proposed
water treatment system. This work was undertaken in order to provide baseline information in
support of construction permit applications to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The
investigations were conducted in order to adhere to issues raised by Section 10 of the Rivers and
Harbors Act of 1899 [33 U.S. Code (U.S.C.) 403] and Section 404 of the Clean Waters Act [32
U.S.C. 1344] administered by the USACE, and the National Environmental Policy Act [42
U.S.C. 4321, et seq.]. All of these federal laws include cultural resources concerns and invoke
implementation of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as
amended through 2004 [16 U.S.C. § 470 et seq.; P.L. 89–665; 80 Stat. 915] requiring
archeological survey. In addition, since the ultimate client, NETMWD, was created under
enabling state legislation, it is regarded as a political subdivision of the State of Texas and hence
must comply with the Antiquities Code of Texas [Title 9, Chapter 191, the Natural Resources
Code of Texas]. Accordingly, the present investigations were conducted under Texas Antiquities
Code permit #4268.
The purpose of the cultural resources investigations was to identify and inventory the cultural
resource properties contained within the proposed project area, and to evaluate their potential for
inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for designation as State
Archeological Landmarks (SAL). GMI archeologists were contracted to conduct an intensive
pedestrian survey of 8.5 miles of proposed pipeline corridor with a permanent Right-Of-Way

(ROW) width of 20 ft., and a 0.5 acre booster pump station location. In addition, GMI was
contracted to backhoe trench 1.76 miles of previously surveyed pipeline corridor within the
Walnut Creek and Little Cypress Bottoms flood plains in search of deeply buried archeological
deposits, due to the fact the revised NETMWD construction plans indicated these areas would be
open cut rather than bored as an additional cost-saving strategy.
The survey of the newly revised proposed pipeline corridor was subdivided into 16 different
areas. These areas were letter sequentially from A – P based on the order the areas were
surveyed, which was the product of a combination of the natural and constructed landscape
features, the order land owner permission was obtained via KSA Engineering, and accessibility of
areas due to weather. An overview of the proposed pipeline corridor is provided in this
introduction. (Figures 2 and 3).
A brief overview of the linear survey begins at the western terminus of the newly proposed
pipeline corridor and follows it within the limits of Ore City from the location where Front St.
forms a “T” intersection with F.M. road 450. The proposed pipeline corridor lies to the east of
Front St. and to the north of the existing F.M. Rd. 450 ROW by 10', which in its entirety is
reported as being 80' wide. The proposed pipeline then follows the north side of F.M. Rd. 450 for
0.75 miles to the intersection of F.M. Rd. 450 with Mendora Dr. The proposed pipeline crosses
Mendora Dr. and follows along the south side of Mendora Dr. in a northeasterly direction for 0.11
miles until reaching the south side of an existing power line easement. The proposed pipeline
then bends eastward following the south side of the existing power line easement for 0.08 miles
until reaching the west side of Cherry Blossom Rd.
The proposed pipeline continues eastward across Cherry Blossom Rd. running 10’ south of the
southern border of Cleo and Julia Hyde’s property for 0.07 miles. The proposed pipeline then
bends northward ninety-degrees and runs 10' east of the eastern boundary of the Hyde property
for 0.02 miles until reaching the northern boundary of the James Scott Peebles property. Once
the proposed corridor reaches the northern border of the Peebles property, it bends ninety-degrees
to the east and follows the northern boundary fence of the Peebles property eastward for 1.14
miles to the east side of a northwest-southeast running power line corridor where it terminates in
a “T” shaped intersection. The proposed pipeline corridor reportedly runs 10' to the south of this
northern property line.
The proposed pipeline splits at the “T” intersection with part of the proposed pipeline running in a
northwesterly direction and the other section running in a southeasterly direction. The section of
proposed pipeline running in the southeasterly direction parallels the existing power line
easement for 2.88 miles and terminates at Pop’s Landing Road. The proposed pipeline corridor
crosses Old Avinger Rd. and Sandy Creek to name a couple of the larger landmarks, while
remaining at a distance of roughly 10' east of the existing power line easement.
The area north of the “T” intersection in the proposed pipeline intersection parallels the existing
power line easement in a northwesterly direction for 0.08 miles. The proposed pipeline will be
placed 10' to the east of the present power line easement in this section. Then, the proposed
pipeline corridor bends in a slightly more northerly direction paralleling the western boundary of
the J. R. Monts property for 0.19 miles until reaching a paved road called Wisteria Trail. The
proposed pipeline corridor likewise will be 10' to the east of the western boundary of the Monts
property.

The proposed pipeline forms a second “T” intersection upon crossing Wisteria Trail in the center
of the southern boundary of the Elmer & Joy Peebles property. The portion of the proposed
pipeline heading in a westerly direction does so for 0.08 miles at a distance of 10’ north of
Wisteria Trl. and terminates at the location of the 0.5 acre booster pump station location.
The section of the proposed pipeline heading in an easterly direction likewise runs 10’ north of
Wisteria Trl. The proposed pipeline runs east for 0.17 miles and then makes a ninety-degree turn
to the north again following Wisteria Trl for 0.17 miles, at which point it follows along the
western boundary of the Thomas C. Turner property 10’ to the west of the boundary fence on the
Peebles property. The proposed pipeline follows the Turner property for 0.08 miles at which
point it bends ninety-degrees to the east and follows along the southern boundary of the Charles
W. & Carolyn Coleman property for 0.19 miles. The proposed pipeline then bends ninety-degree
to the north, winding through the center of Coleman property closely aligned with the boundaries
of a pre-existing unimproved two-track road for 0.40 miles until reaching the southern shore of
the Lake O’ The Pines.
The proposed pipeline then crosses the Lake O’ The Pines to the Mims intake station to the
northeast. The pipeline will exit the lake at this station and roughly run from the shore for 0.11
miles to the east of the pre-existing water pipeline easement that connects the Mims Intake
Station to the Mims Water Treatment Facility near State Highway 155. Once the proposed
pipeline crosses the pre-existing water pipeline easement, it will continue northward following
this pre-existing pipeline easement for 2.0 miles and terminating at the Mims Water Treatment
Facility.
The fieldwork for the survey of the revised proposed pipeline corridor was conducted on two
separate occasions. The first session of fieldwork was completed between September 28–October
4, 2006, while the second outing, focused primarily on the geoarcheological investigations of the
Walnut Creek and Little Cypress Creek drainages, between October 26–31, 2006. As a result of
these investigations, one previously undocumented site was identified and recorded (41UR323),
three previously recorded sites were revisited (41MR4, 41MR161 and 41UR247), and a total of
10 nonsite localities were documented.
During the drafting of the report for this survey, it was discovered that sections of the originally
proposed pipeline corridor to be used by the revised system contained revisions post dating the
original GMI survey of 2003-04. Mr. Dan Boney of KSA Engineering, Mr. Aaron Naumann of
GMI and Mr. Shaun Phillips of GMI worked through the process of comparing the present design
plans against the originally surveyed corridor. It was discovered that there were nine reroutes
accounting for an additional 3.2 miles of pipeline that needed to be surveyed prior to KSA
Engineering’s application submittal to the USACE for construction permits. GMI submitted an
amendment to the original Texas Antiquities Code Permit #4268 at the end of November and
GMI archeologists surveyed the reroutes between December 1–5, 2006.
A brief overview of the reroutes begins at the southernmost reroute on the originally proposed
pipeline and continues northward and eastward (the discussion of these reroutes includes numbers
in parenthesis that relate to the maps represented by Figures 4, 5, 6, and 7). The first reroute (1)
is a 0.19 mile stretch extending north of F.M. Road 3245 to Kildee St. The second reroute (2) is
the largest at 1.13 miles and stretches from State Highway 154 to the uplands north of the
previously recorded archeological site 41UR249. The second reroute also required additional
geoarcheological investigations, for it crosses an unnamed tributary of Walnut Creek. The third

reroute (3) is a 0.67 mile segment to the west of Walnut Creek Baptist Church, which passes
through the previously recorded site 41UR7. The fourth reroute (4) is a 0.2 mile segment running
north from F.M. Road 726. The fifth reroute (5) is a small 0.12 mile segment running between
two house lots near the pre-existing Diana SUD Plant on Smilax Rd. The sixth reroute (6) is the
second longest segment and extends for 0.55 mile along the northern edge of Smilax Rd.,
beginning at the intersection of Smilax Rd. and Zinna Rd. The seventh reroute (7) is a small 0.06
mile stretch near the intersection of F.M. Rd 450, Lefever Rd. and Pop’s Landing Rd. The eighth
reroute (8) is a 0.17 mile segment just to the west of the proposed juncture of the newly revised
pipeline section with the originally proposed pipeline, while, the ninth reroute (9) is a 0.06 mile
segment just to the east of the junction of the newly revised pipeline section with the originally
proposed pipeline.
In summary, a total of 11.7 miles of linear survey in combination with a 0.5 acre booster site was
surveyed. As a result of this cultural resources survey, one previously unknown site (41UR323)
was identified, the 2003-04 recommendation of site 41GG65 was amended, one 2003-04
identified site is recounted (41UR292), five previously recorded sites (41MR4, 41MR161,
41MR262, 41UR7, and 41UR247) were revisited, and fifteen nonsite localities were documented.
It is recommended that only site 41UR247 has unknown potential for inclusion in the NRHP, and
in fact, this study would like to suggest the previously recorded sites 41UR247 and 41UR246 be
reconsidered as the same site. The proposed pipeline is no longer positioned to potentially impact
41UR247, but because it was revisited during this survey it will be discussed in Chapter 6. The
survey failed to collect any evidence relating to the other five previously recorded sites within the
proposed pipeline corridor (41MR4, 41MR161, 41MR262 and 41UR7). It is recommended all
fifteen nonsite localities are ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and SAL programs.
In addition to the survey, geoarcheological investigations were conducted on three separate
occasions. The first session of geoarcheological investigations occurred on October 28, 2006,
within the Walnut Creek flood plain and along the southern shore of the Lake O’ The Pines. The
second session of geoarcheological investigations occurred on October 30, 2006, within the Little
Cypress Creek flood plain, and the third session took place on December 5, 2006, along the flood
plain of an unnamed tributary of Walnut Creek. The primary purpose of these investigations was
to determine whether archeological sites were buried within the flood plain sediments. Nineteen
trenches were excavated within the project area and they all revealed a stratigraphic sequence
dominated by recent deposition, derived from colluvial sediments washed off nearby uplands as a
result of historic timber clear-cutting. No cultural materials were identified within this phase of
the investigations (see Figures 3 and 4).
In the following report, Chapter 2 provides information on the natural setting of the project area,
and Chapter 3 outlines previous archeological studies conducted nearby and the cultural setting.
Research goals and methods for the survey and geomorphology work are discussed in Chapter 4.
Chapter 5 documents geoarcheological explorations conducted within the project area. Chapter 6
presents the research results, including detailed descriptions of each of the identified sites and
localities. Finally, recommendations concerning the eligibility of the cultural resources sites for
NRHP inclusion and SAL designation as well as the need for additional work are presented in
Chapter 7. A list of references cited follows the main body of the report. Included as appendices
are descriptions of the backhoe trench strata (Appendix A), definitions of lithic artifact classes,
analytical terms and the data base for lithic artifacts collected during the project (Appendix B),
definitions of prehistoric ceramic artifact classes, analytical terms and the data base for
prehistoric ceramics collected during the project (Appendix C), the definitions of historic artifact
11

classes, analytical terms and the data base of historic artifacts collected during the project
(Appendix D), and a list of curated material resulting from the survey (Appendix E). The final
appendix, Appendix F, provides detailed information on shovel test depths for each site, and
indicates whether or not artifacts were recovered for each 20 cm level (the artifacts themselves
are detailed in Appendices C-E).

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY
Lake O’ The Pines is located in Marion, Morris, and Upshur counties. The reservoir has
inundated portions of the Big Cypress Creek flood plain, as well as substantial portions of some
major tributaries, including Little Cypress Creek, Alley Creek, Johnson Creek, Copeland Creek,
Hurricane Creek, and Meddlin Creek. Other named tributaries of Lake O’ The Pines include
Boggy Creek, Swauano Creek, Prairie Creek, Greasy Creek, Little Creek, Jones Creek, Sandy
Creek, and Arms Creek. An additional three smaller reservoirs, Johnson Creek Reservoir, Ellison
Creek Reservoir, and Simpson Lake, impound waters immediately upstream from Lake O’ The
Pines.
Gregg, Harrison, Marion, and Upshur counties all lie within the Gulf Coastal Plains
physiographic province, a segment of the Mesozoic-Cenozoic coastal geosyncline (Murray 1960).
This geosyncline forms a gradually sloping basin that dips toward the Gulf of Mexico and
contains formations of limestone and sandstone deposited along the margins of an ancient
receding coastline. The geologic strata in the vicinity of Lake O’ The Pines were deposited
during the Eocene, Pleistocene, and Holocene periods (Bureau of Economic Geology [BEG]
1975). The upland areas at Lake O’ The Pines are developed almost entirely on the Queen City
Sand, with small areas of the Weches Formation also being exposed near the lake. Both of these
formations were deposited during the Eocene. The Queen City Sand is composed of light gray to
brownish gray, locally carbonaceous quartz sand and gray to brown clay. It includes common
ironstone concretions and ledges and local beds of glauconite-quartz greensand. The Weches
Formation is composed of grayish green to grayish olive green, glauconite and quartz sand, with
light brown to moderate light gray clay interbedding; limonitic and sideritic iron ore and clay
ironstone concretions form locally. The Holocene alluvium is concentrated in the upper reaches
of the lake in Camp, Morris, and Upshur counties and in the flood plains of the tributary streams,
particularly Little Cypress Creek. Otherwise, only a thin margin of alluvial soil is found
intermittently along the shoreline of Lake O’ The Pines. Pleistocene terrace deposits are found in
only one place at Lake O’ The Pines—on the east shore of the lake, straddling State Highway 155
(BEG 1975).

13

Lithic materials suitable for the production of ground and/or pecked stone tools, such as small
manos, nutting stones, anvil stones, various types of stone abraders, or heavy choppers, are
present in the Queen City Sand and the Weches Formation, and would have been easily obtained
from the nearby Wilcox Group and Reklaw Formation as well. Knappable lithic materials near
these areas are reported to be present only in the Wilcox Group, the Uvalde Gravels, and at
Buzzard Bluff in Arkansas (Banks 1990). Large pieces of petrified wood and chert gravels are
reportedly present within the Wilcox Group (Fisher 1965:197), although it is doubtful that the
material could be used consistently. Banks (1990:52) refers to the use of petrified wood
(particularly petrified palmwood) from the Wilcox Group by prehistoric Native American peoples
in East Texas as “obviously important, although probably fortuitous” since “there are few discrete
concentrations of individual types that were used as primary sources of raw materials.” Banks
(1990:52) makes no mention of any other usable chert gravels in the Wilcox Group, although he
does describe a dense, gray quartzite, which “could easily be confused with varieties of Ogallala
Quartzite” (see below) from Buzzard Bluff, Arkansas, whose origin is “probably a remnant of the
Wilcox on top of Midway deposits.”
One of the more important sources of lithic raw material in this area is upland lag gravel deposits
of western origin, commonly referred to as the Uvalde Gravels (Banks 1990:56–57). These
upland gravels have been identified in Central and South Texas (Byrd 1971; Hill 1891),
Northcentral Texas (Menzer and Slaughter 1971), and East Texas (Banks 1990). Banks
(1990:57) specifically refers to having seen such gravels “along the divide between the Red and
Sulphur Rivers in Northeast Texas and along the divide between the Sulphur and its principal
southern tributary, White Oak Bayou.”
The immediate origin of these gravels is believed to be the Ogallala Formation on the High
Plains, which consists of redeposited gravels whose ultimate source is New Mexico and the
Rocky Mountains. Along the edge of the Llano Estacado, in and south of the Texas Panhandle,
materials found within various members of the Ogallala Formation include light-colored, dark
gray, to black and purple, medium- to coarse-grained quartzites; Potter chert (a dense, gray to
brown, silica-cemented, very fine-grained siltstone that grades into reddish varieties in East
Texas); red to brown to yellow jaspers; medium to dark gray and dark blue chert; flint; and
petrified (silicified) wood (Holliday and Welty 1981:208–209). Many of these materials are
repeated within the Uvalde Gravels. In Central Texas, Byrd (1971:5) identified chert, quartz,
jasper, quartzite, limestone, and silicified wood, in sizes ranging from pebbles to boulders.
In contrast to the Uvalde Gravels, another source of lithic raw material for this area is an
unnamed upland lag gravel present in central Bowie County (Cliff 1994). Upland gravel deposits
containing pebbles and cobbles of usable raw material were identified in 1989 along the divide
between the Red and Sulphur rivers and along the headwaters of Elliott Creek in Bowie County
(Peter and Cliff 1990a). When a number of these cobbles were identified as novaculite by Larry
Banks in 1993 and 1994 (an identification since confirmed by Meeks Etchieson of the U.S. Forest
Service), it suggested an origin different from that of the Uvalde Gravels. The Bowie Gravels
(for want of a better term at the present time) contain brownish yellow to pale brown, brownish
yellow to yellowish brown, and brownish yellow to red novaculite; olive gray or “green” chert
from the Arkansas novaculite outcrops along the headwaters of the Kiamichi River in Oklahoma;
black chert that weathers to a yellowish brown; coarse-grained white quartzite; a mediumgrained, gray quartzite that is very similar to Potter chert; and Battiest chert from the Ouachita
Mountains in Oklahoma (all identifications by Larry Banks in 1993 and 1994). In addition, it
appears that the gravels also contain weak red to reddish brown, pinkish gray to very pale brown,
14

pale brown to dusky red, and very pale brown novaculite; gray to dark gray chert that weathers to
yellowish brown; and a weak red, coarse-grained quartzitic sandstone that weathers to yellowish
brown. Finally, a number of upland sites in Bowie County have yielded flakes of Woodford chert
(a gray to black, dull opaque chert deriving from the Woodford Formation in the western
Ouachita Mountains in Oklahoma) that may also have originated from these gravels (Cliff 1994).
This lithology is radically different from that usually ascribed to the Uvalde Gravels (see above)
and strongly suggests an origin to the north, in southeastern Oklahoma and southwestern
Arkansas, although the occurrence of the Bowie Gravels on surfaces of the Midway and Wilcox
groups suggests an age comparable to that of the Uvalde Gravels (BEG 1979).
Finally, reworked lithic materials from both the Uvalde and Bowie gravels, including novaculite,
chert, jasper, and quartzite, presumably are present within the lower Pleistocene terraces and
more recent gravel bar deposits along both the Sulphur and Red rivers, although the Red River
would probably carry additional material from the Texas Panhandle, southwestern and
southeastern Oklahoma, and southwestern Arkansas. Among the more notable components of
these deposits would be Tecovas jasper (a distinctive purplish red, mottled jasper that outcrops
between the headwaters of the North Canadian and Cimarron rivers in western Texas and
Oklahoma), Big Fork chert (a black to dark brown chert from the Big Fork Formation in the
western Ouachita Mountains of Oklahoma), Red River siltstone (including a yellowish brown
variety that may be weathered Big Fork chert and a red to yellow variety that is fine-grained, dull,
and opaque), Lowrance chert (a brown to gray cryptocrystalline flint, probably from the Oil
Creek and Joins formations in the eastern Arbuckles of Oklahoma), and Woodford chert (Banks
1984, 1990; Banks and Winters 1975; Holliday and Welty 1981; Perttula 1984).

SOILS
Detailed soil mapping is available for Harrison, Gregg, and Upshur counties (Golden et al. 1994;
Roberts 1983), but all that is available for Marion County is the General Soil Map, Cass and
Marion Counties, Texas (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service [USDA,
SCS] 1974). A total of 19 soil mapping units will be impacted by the proposed construction.

Bibb silt loam, frequently flooded consists of a nearly level Typic Fluvaquent found on the flood
plains of small streams. Slopes are less than 1 percent, and the soil occurs in patches 15–300 ac
in size. Bibb silt loams are characterized by a profile consisting of 0–20 centimeters (cm; 0–8
inches [in]) of gray (10YR 5/1) silt loam with yellowish brown (10YR 5/6), dark yellowish brown
(10YR 4/4), red (2.5YR 4/8), strong brown (7.5YR 4/6), and light gray (10YR 6/1) mottling
overlying a light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam to fine sandy loam with yellowish brown
(10YR 5/8), brownish yellow (10YR 6/6), and strong brown mottling to 61 cm (24 in) below
surface (bs). Beneath this stratum is a light brownish gray fine sandy loam with brownish yellow,
yellow (10YR 6/8), light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4), and strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) mottles,
extending to 163 cm (64 in) bs (Golden et al. 1994).
Briley loamy fine sand, 2 to 5 percent slopes, is a well-drained soil found primarily on upland
stream divides, and is of more limited extent than Bibb soils. Most mapped areas of this
Paleudult average 10–50 ac in size and are irregularly shaped. They are characterized by a thin
layer of brown (10YR 4/3) loamy fine sand up to 20 cm (8 in) thick, directly overlying a light
yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loamy fine sand to 66 cm (26 in) bs. The underlying subsoil, which
extends to about 147 cm (58 in) bs, is a red (2.5YR 4/6) sandy clay mottled strong brown (7.5YR
5/6) and brownish yellow (10YR 6/6). This is, in turn, underlain by a strong brown (7.5YR 5/6)
sandy clay with red (2.5YR 4/8), yellowish red (5YR 5/6) and pale brown (10YR 6/3) mottles to
a depth of 203 cm (80 in; Roberts 1983).
Bowie very fine sandy loam, 2 to 5 percent slopes, and Bowie fine sandy loam, 2 to 5 percent
slopes, are very similar soils and may represent different facies of the same Plinthic Paleudult
soil, as described by two separate soil conservation teams (Golden et al. 1994 and Roberts 1983,
respectively). Both are moderately well-drained soils found on upland slopes, particularly on
stream divides, and are characterized by a dark brown (10YR 4/3) fine to very fine sandy loam
surface solum 13–15 cm (5–6 in) thick, underlain by a pale brown (10YR 6/3) to yellowish brown
(10YR 5/4) fine to very fine sandy loam to 25–30 cm (10–12 in). Beneath this is a yellowish
brown (10YR 5/6 to 10YR 5/8) sandy clay loam to a depth of 112–117 cm (44–46 in) that grades
into a sandy clay loam mottled strong brown (7.5YR 5/6, 5/8), gray (10YR 6/1), red (10R 4/8 to
2.5YR 5/8), and yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) that extends to a depth in excess of 183 cm (72 in;
Golden et al. 1994; Roberts 1983).
Cuthbert fine sandy loam, 5–15 percent slopes, and Cuthbert fine sandy loam, 8–25 percent
slopes, are closely related Typic Hapludult soils, though their consistencies and colors are
somewhat different. Golden et al. (1984: 23) define Cuthbert fine sandy loam, 5–15 percent
slopes, as a “moderately sloping to moderately steep soil . . . on uplands”, particularly on hillsides
above drainages. These mapping units are long and narrow, and range from 30–1,000 ac in size.
A typical profile consists of a very dark gray fine sandy loam 10 cm (4 in) thick overlying a thin
stratum of brown, fine sandy loam to a depth of 15 cm (6 in). This, in turn, overlies a red clay
that grades into a mottled red and strong brown clay by about 66 cm (26 in) bs. At 86 cm (34 in)
bs, it gives way to a mottled red, strong brown and light brownish gray, weakly consolidated
sandstone and clay that extends to at least 152 cm (60 in) bs (Golden et al. 1994).

16

Roberts (1983) describes Cuthbert fine sandy loam, 8 to 25 percent slopes, as a strongly sloping
soil found primarily on upland hill slopes; these areas vary from 30–300 ac in size. A typical
pedon consists of a layer of brown (7.5YR 4/2 to 5/4) fine sandy loam with numerous ironstone
fragments, up to 20 cm (8 in) thick, that overlies a red (2.5YR 4/6) clay that extends to 91 cm
(36 in) bs. The lower half of this stratum displays common yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) mottling
and numerous shale fragments. A stratified series of red (2.5YR 4/8) loam, reddish yellow
(7.5YR 6/8) fine sandy loam, and light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) shale, corresponding to the
lowest stratum observed for the previous Cuthbert soil, extends to 152 cm (60 in) bs.
Darco fine sand, 2 to 5 percent slopes, is a gently sloping Grossarenic Paleudult found atop broad
stream divides and uplands ridges; mapped areas vary in size from 10–300 ac. A typical soil
profile begins with a brown (10YR 5/3) fine sand about 25 cm (10 in) thick that is underlain by
light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) fine sand extending from 25–157 cm (10–62 in) bs; the lower
38 cm (15 in) displays prominent yellowish red (5YR 4/8) mottles. This layer is in turn underlain
by a subsoil that consists of a yellowish red (5YR 4/6–5/8) sandy clay loam that extends to a
depth of 203 cm (80 in) bs and is mottled strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) in its lower 18 cm (7 in;
Roberts 1983).
Iuka fine sandy loam, frequently flooded, is a deep, nearly level Aquic Udifluvent located on
flood plains of the smaller streams in the area. A typical profile for this map unit has a surface
layer of fine sandy loam, about 30 cm (12 in) thick, that grades from dark grayish brown (10YR
4/2) to brown (10YR 5/3). Below this, to a depth of about 152 cm bs, is a fine sandy loam that is
brown (7.5YR 4/4) with dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4), strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), and
grayish brown (10YR 5/2–6/2) mottles in the upper part and mottled brownish gray (10YR 6/2),
yellowish brown (10YR 5/6), and brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) in the lower part (Roberts 1983).
The Kirvin-Bowie association consists of gently undulating to gently rolling upland soils that are
primarily used as pasture and woodland. The association is composed of approximately 45
percent Kirvin soils, 35 percent Bowie soils, and 20 percent other soils. Both Kirvin and Bowie
soils are classed as ultisols. Kirvin soils typically consist of a brown to dark brown (7.5YR 4/45/4) fine sandy loam, about 30 cm (12 in) thick, that is underlain by a red (2.5YR 4/6) clay,
approximately 66 cm (26 in) thick. This in turn is underlain by red clay with strong brown
(7.5YR 5/8) mottles. Bowie soils consist of brown (10YR 4/3) to pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine
sandy loam, about 30 cm (12 in) thick, that is underlain by yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) sandy
clay loam with strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) and yellowish red (5YR 5/6) mottling, about 76 cm (30
in) thick. This is in turn underlain by a mottled yellowish brown, red, and light brownish gray
(10YR 6/2) sandy clay loam that is about 89 cm (35 in) thick (USDA, SCS 1974).
Two related Kirvin soils were mapped within some portions of the project area. Kirvin gravelly
fine sandy loam, 2 to 5 percent slopes, and Kirvin very fine sandy loam, 2 to 5 percent slopes, are,
like all Kirvin soils, Typic Hapludults and occupy ridges and stream divides. Mapped areas for
both these deep, gently sloping soils average from 15–200 ac in size (Roberts 1983).
Descriptions for both generally follow the description provided for Kirvin soils in the preceding
paragraph, although the uppermost horizon for the Kirvin very fine sandy loam, 2 to 5 percent
slopes, tends to be slightly thinner than average (about 10 cm [4 in] rather than 30 cm [12 in]).
Lilbert loamy fine sand, 2 to 5 percent slopes, is a gently sloping Plinthic Paleudult found on
uplands. Patches of this soil tend to be relatively small, varying from about 15–100 ac in size.
The typical Lilbert pedon is complex. The uppermost stratum is a brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine
17

sand about 15 cm (6 in) thick and directly overlies a pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy fine sand that
extends to about 76 cm (30 in) bs. Below that is a yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) sandy clay loam
that becomes increasingly marked by yellowish red (5YR 5/6), pale brown (10YR 6/3), light
brownish gray (10YR 6/2), and red (2.5YR 4/8) mottles with depth. At 142 cm, it gives way to a
mottled red (2.5YR 4/8), brownish gray (10YR 6/2); and strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) sandy clay
loam (Roberts 1983).
Mantachie loam, frequently flooded, is a deep, nearly level Aeric Fluvaquent located on flood
plains of the larger streams in the area; mapped regions may be as large as several thousand acres.
This soil exhibits a surface layer of brown (10YR 5/3) loam that is about 20 cm (8 in) thick.
Below this, the upper part of the subsoil extends to 86 cm (34 in) bs and consists of a dark grayish
brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam over light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay loam with yellowish
brown (10YR 5/8) and yellowish red (5YR 4/8) mottles. Extending to 137 cm (54 in) bs is a
layer of grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam with red (2.5YR 4/8) mottling. From 137–165 cm
(54–65 in) bs is a grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam with red (2.5YR 4/8) and yellowish brown
(10YR 5/6) mottles (Roberts 1983:26).
Mooreville-Mantachie complex, frequently flooded, map units are large patches of flood plain
deposits, averaging 100–5,000 ac in size, that consist of a mix of Mooreville and Mantachie soils,
with a minor admixture of other soils. The Mooreville soils, Fluvaquentic Dystrochrepts that
compose 50 percent of the complex, usually occur on natural levees and along old sloughs and
oxbows. Mantachie soils comprise 35 percent of the complex and are found mostly on “low flats
adjacent to side slopes, in oxbow channels, and on concave flats away from the main channels”
(Golden et al. 1994:64). A typical Mantachie pedon was described in the previous paragraph.
The average Mooreville sequence consists of a surface layer of dark brown (10YR 4/3) loam 40
cm (16 in) thick, underlain by yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam with dark yellowish brown
(10YR 4/4), brown (10YR 5/3), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), and strong brown (7.5YR 5/6)
mottling that extends to 69 cm (27 in) bs. This is underlain by a gray (10YR 6/1) loam that goes
to about 203 cm (80 in) bs, and displays yellowish brown (10YR 5/6–5/8), yellowish red (5YR
5/8), strong brown (7.5YR 5/8), and red (2.5YR 4/8) mottles (Golden et al. 1994).
Sacul fine sandy loam, 2 to 5 percent slopes, and Sacul fine sandy loam, 5 to 12 percent slopes,
are closely related, deep and sloping to strongly sloping Aquic Hapludults found along upland
streams. These units can range from 20–250 ac in size, and are moderately well drained. Their
soil profiles are similar, but not identical. The typical soil profile for Sacul fine sandy loam, 2 to
5 percent slopes, begins with a dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam about 22 cm
(9 in) thick; the uppermost layer of the Sacul fine sandy loam, 5 to 12 percent slopes, consists of a
layer of the same just 10 cm (4 in) thick and underlain by brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam to
20 cm (8 in) bs. This in turn is underlain by the subsoil, consisting of a red (2.5YR 4/6) clay with
brownish and grayish mottling to a depth of 76 cm (30 in) for the more steeply-sloping soil and
112 cm (44 in) for the more level soil. A light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) to light gray (10YR
7/1) to gray (10YR 6/1) silty clay with reddish brown (5YR 4/2) mottling underlies this unit to a
depth of at least 165 cm (65 in; Roberts 1983).
Sawyer very fine sandy loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes, is an Aquic Paleudult that forms on nearly
level and gently sloping uplands. A typical profile consists of a surface layer of dark grayish
brown (10YR 4/2) very fine sandy loam approximately 15 cm (8 in) thick. Below this is a brown
(10YR 5/3) very fine sandy loam that extends to 33 cm (13 in) bs. It is underlain by a yellowish
brown (10YR 5/4) loam that becomes increasingly mottled with yellowish red (5YR 4/6), light
18

brownish gray (10YR 6/2), and light yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) with depth, until at 66 cm
(26 in) it grades into a light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay loam mottled with yellowish brown
(10YR 5/6) and yellowish red (5YR 4/6). This stratum extends to a depth of 79 cm (31 in).
Below this is a gray (10YR 5/1) clay mottled with dark red (2.5YR 3/6) and yellowish brown
(10YR 5/6) that extends to 163 cm (64 in) bs. The lowest stratum is a light brownish gray (10YR
6/2) clay loam mottled with dark red and reddish brown (5YR 5/4); it goes to 203 cm (80 in) bs
(Golden et al. 1994).
Tenaha loamy fine sands, 8 to 20 percent slopes, is a moderately to strongly sloping Arnica
Hapludult that occurs on side slopes above drainages in long, narrow patches varying from 20–
150 ac in size. The surface soil is a dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loamy fine sand 10 cm (4 in)
thick, overlying a brown (7.5YR 5/4) loamy fine sand the extends to 56 cm (22 in) bs. Below this
is a yellowish red (5YR 5/6) loamy fine sand to a 74 cm (29 in) and a red (2.5YR 4/6–4/8) loam
that extends to 132 cm (52 in) bs and exhibits yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) mottles in its lower
half. The basal layer is a composed of a red (2.5YR 4/8) and brownish yellow (10YR 6/6)
sandstone interbedded with light gray (10YR 7/1) shale clay and extends to a depth of at least
163 cm (64 in) bs.
Warnock loamy fine sand, 8 to 15 percent slopes, is also a moderately to strongly sloping soil,
though it is classified as a Typic Paleudult. It manifests as a dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4)
loamy fine sand 8 cm (4 in) thick, overlying a yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loamy fine sand that
extends to 48 cm (19 in) bs and a yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) fine sandy loam that continues to
79 cm (31 in) bs. This unit grades into a yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) sandy clay loam that
extends to 109 cm (43 in) bs. The lowest level described for this soil is a mottled brownish
yellow (10YR 6/8) and red (2.5YR 4/8) sandy clay loam with a few light brownish gray (10YR
6/2) and dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) mottles and occasional pale brown (10YR 6/3) lenses
in its upper part. This stratum extends to a depth of at least 203 cm (80 in) bs.

SIGNIFICANCE OF THE LOCAL SOILS
The characteristics of the soils described in the previous section can be used to provide a tentative
reconstruction of land-use patterns during the prehistoric and early historic periods. Today, the
flood plain soils along Big Cypress Creek and its major tributaries are considered to be well
suited for flood plain hardwood forests and some improved pasture grasses (Golden et al. 1994;
Roberts 1983). Prior to the historic period, these areas were probably covered by bottomland
forest composed of water-tolerant woodland species, interspersed with small open areas of native
prairie grasses.
For the prehistoric and early historic inhabitants of the region, the flood plain areas would have
allowed easy access to water and would have provided temporary/seasonal campsites or work
stations, although the yearly flooding would have precluded permanent occupation. The various
major tributaries (such as Little Cypress, Sandy, and Copeland creeks) most likely would also
have offered year-round access to water. The flood plain in general may have offered seasonal
plant resources, and the hypothesized prairie areas would have provided good hunting. The trees
would have provided building materials, fuel, and raw materials for manufactured articles, and
the grasses would have provided material for baskets and clothing, among other things. Today,
these flood plain areas are considered poor candidates for crop production because of their
frequent flooding (estimated as two to four times a year, in some cases) and a water table that is
19

near the surface during a good part of the year (Golden et al. 1994; Roberts 1983). For the
prehistoric inhabitants, however, the nature of the soils themselves was probably more critical in
judging their suitability for horticulture. Dense clay soils such as those in the Sulphur River basin
to the north would have been difficult, if not impossible, to cultivate using the stone and wooden
implements of the prehistoric period, or even with the light metal tools available to historic period
populations prior to the introduction of the iron plow. In contrast, the loamy flood plain soils of
the Big Cypress basin (such as Kirvin fine sandy loam, Mantachie loam, and Sawyer very fine
sandy loam) would undoubtedly have been more easily tilled with native tools and may have
supported higher population levels.
The areas along the margins of the modern lake consist of upland slopes and edges as well as
some areas that are more level. The soils in these areas are sandy and loamy, moderately well to
poorly drained, and have a high available water capacity. For modern uses, some are limited by
their steepness, which ranges from 5 to 20 percent and results in severe erosion, and others by
their wetness. Today, these areas are considered to be well suited for woodland and pasture
(Golden et al. 1994; Roberts 1983), and prior to the historic period were probably covered by an
oak-hickory-pine forest interspersed with small areas of open native prairie.
Prehistoric activity in this area would probably have consisted primarily of small campsites or
horticultural hamlets on flat, well-drained areas, placed to take advantage of the rich resource
base of both uplands and bottomland. Early historic settlement probably consisted of small, selfsufficient family farmsteads that focused on cropping on well- and moderately well-drained
upland soils and the grazing of animals on the remaining soils. Sites located on these areas
(especially those above the major tributaries of Big Cypress Creek) would have been close to
water without the danger of seasonal flooding. Such areas would have been suited to both
permanent and temporary occupation during all seasons.
As with the flood plain, many of these upland areas are considered today to be unsuited for crop
production due to their slope, low permeability, and tendency toward erosion (Golden et al. 1994;
Roberts 1983). These difficulties, however, would have been less serious for prehistoric
horticulturists. More importantly, the sandy soils would have been easily tilled using stone and
wooden implements. The small size of the native cultivated plots could easily have been
accommodated within the small areas with a slight slope, which would also have decreased the
potential for erosion and increased permeability. During the early historic era, these areas would
have provided easy access to more level upland zones, considered more suitable for farming and
grazing, and the use of the iron plow would have allowed the partial development of the
bottomlands for agricultural production.

HYDROLOGY
Lake O’ The Pines Reservoir is located within the Big Cypress Creek drainage, primarily within
Marion County, although the upper limits of the reservoir form the boundaries between Upshur,
Morris, and Camp counties. Lake O’ The Pines drains a relatively small area and none of the
tributaries of Lake O’ The Pines form extensive drainage systems. In regard to the project area,
most of the line trending to the northwest between Lake O’ The Pines and Ore City lies within the
Big Cypress drainage system; but those portions of the route trending south within the Beachman
and Walnut creeks and the Glade Creek drainages are part of Little Cypress Creek basin. The
confluence of Big and Little Cypress creeks is located about 25 km east of the Lake O’ The Pines
dam.
20

An ample supply of rainfall provides a constant water flow in most of the larger streams that feed
the lake. The slow permeability of many of the surrounding soils, together with the rapid runoff
from the sloping uplands, results in a rapid channeling of rainwater into the flood plains of the
creeks and eventually into the lake. In the past, the slow permeability and runoff of the flood
plain soils meant that much of this water stayed in the flood plains of the larger creeks and the
rivers, in extensive water-filled sloughs and marshes. These habitats undoubtedly attracted a
variety of flora and fauna to the abundant water, resources that would have provided food and
raw materials to both prehistoric and early historic inhabitants of the area.
A number of historic springs in Marion County are derived from the Queen City and Reklaw
sands and are mostly located in a band from Jefferson to Lodi, about 20 km east of Lake O’ The
Pines (Brune 1981:302). Brune lists no historic springs along Walnut Creek or other tributaries
north of Little Cypress Creek, but it is likely that some were present.

CLIMATE
Northeast Texas has a humid, mesothermal climate (Nixon 1985:7), marked by long hot summers
and short cool winters. The primary influences on the climate are the latitude, warm winds from
the Gulf of Mexico, and cooler northern winds from the continental landmass to the north. Cold
waves in the winter are rare and not severe, usually lasting only one or two days. Temperatures
rarely exceed 40ºCelsius (C; 104ºFahrenheit [F]) in the summer or fall below -13ºC (9ºF) in the
winter, but the variation is sufficient to produce four distinct seasons—a mild winter, a warm
spring, a hot summer, and a warm autumn. The number of days in the growing season with
temperatures above the freezing mark averages between 203 and 207 (Golden et al. 1994; Nixon
1985:7; Roberts 1983).
Precipitation is fairly heavy throughout the year. Prolonged droughts are rare, and the frequent
afternoon thunderstorms in summer are adequate to maintain crops. Severe storms, including
tornadoes, strike the area occasionally and often cause flooding and erosion. Every few years in
the summer or fall, a tropical depression moves inland, causing extremely heavy rains for one to
three days. Average annual precipitation ranges from 921 millimeters (mm) to about 1,412 mm
(34.5–56 in) and is usually distributed uniformly throughout the year (Golden et al. 1994; Nixon
1985:7; Roberts 1983). As the average winter temperature is above freezing, snowfall is variable
but rare, averaging just 50 mm (1.95 in; Golden et al. 1994; Roberts 1983).

FLORA
Lake O’ The Pines is located within the East Texas Pineywoods biotic region and is encompassed
by the Pine-Hardwood forest (Subtype 2: Shortleaf Pine-Post Oak-Southern Red Oak). The
Shortleaf Pine-Post Oak-Southern Red Oak forest covers a large portion of Northeast Texas,
including Bowie, Marion, and Upshur counties, and occurs on sandy uplands. The most common
trees present within this vegetation zone are red oak (Quercus rubra), post oak (Quercus stellata),
hickory (Carya spp.), and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata). Other associated species within this
vegetation zone are loblolly pine (P. taeda), black hickory (C. texana), sandjack oak (Q. incana),
flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), common persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), sweetgum
(Liquidambar styraciflua), sassafras (Sassafras albidum), greenbrier (Smilax spp.), yaupon (Ilex
vomitoria), wax myrtle (Myrica californica), American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana),
21

hawthorn (Crataegus spp.), supplejack (Berchemia scandens), winged elm (Ulmus alata), beaked
panicum (Panicum anceps), spranglegrass (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), Indiangrass
(Sorghastrum nutans), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), three-awn (Aristida spp.), bushclover
(Lilium spp.), and tickclover (Desmodium spp.; McMahan et al. 1984:25).
In addition to the timber and wood resources of the area, acorns, nuts, berries, and grasses were
also available to prehistoric and historic groups alike. The presence of acorns and hickory nuts
would have proved beneficial in several ways. Both are high in fats and could have provided a
substantial addition to the diet, as they did for many historic southeastern Native American
groups (Hilliard 1980), though acorns require extensive processing to be edible. During the fall,
they would have attracted white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and turkey (Meleagris
gallopavo), both important prey species for later historic southeastern groups (Swanton 1946).
Trees bearing edible nuts identified in East Texas include eastern black walnut (Juglans nigra),
pecan (Carya illinoensis), shellbark hickory (C. laciniosa), shagbark hickory (C. ovata),
mockernut hickory (C. tometosa), black hickory (C. texana), nutmeg hickory (C.
myristicaeformis), swamp hickory (C. leiodermis), pignut hickory (C. glabra), American beech
(Fagus grandifolia), common chinquapin (Castanea pumila), Florida chinquapin (Castanea
alnifolia), white oak (Q. alba), blackjack oak (Q. marilandica), and live oak (Q. virginiana;
Heartfield and Dieste 1984a, 1984b:2–5; Vines 1977).
Wild fruits and berries, such as blackberry and dewberry (Rubus spp.), wild grape (Vitis spp.),
wild strawberry (Fragaria virginiana), persimmon (Diospyros spp.), plum and cherry (Prunus
spp.) would have provided a source of vitamins and carbohydrates for both prehistoric and
historic populations. Seeds of various trees, shrubs, grasses, and weeds would have attracted the
animals that would in turn provide additional food. Finally, certain tubers available in the
woodlands could have been collected for food as well as for use in medicinal, craft, or ritual
activities (Heartfield and Dieste 1984a, 1984b:2–5).

FAUNA
Faunal resources within Northeast Texas could have provided many of the daily needs for both
prehistoric and early historic populations. Animal products would have provided shelter,
clothing, and a means of exchange, as well as antler and shell for tools, and feathers and various
skins for decorations. In addition, it is safe to say that numerous types of invertebrates were
abundant along the major streams, as well as various types of mollusks, including both bivalves
and gastropods, and crustaceans known to have been used by historic southeastern Native
American tribes (Swanton 1946). Among the fish resources, economically important families for
both prehistoric and historic populations probably would have included gar (Lepisosteus spp.),
crappie (Pomoxis spp.), bass (Micropterus spp.), buffalo (Ictiobus spp.), shad (Dorosoma spp.),
carp (Cyprinus spp.), bowfin (Amia calva), shiner (Notropis spp.), pickerel (Esox americanus),
catfish (Ictalaurus spp.), sunfish (Lepomis spp.), and drum (Aplodinotus grunniens; Heartfield
and Dieste 1984a, 1984b:2–6). Of the amphibians and reptiles, only true frogs (Rana spp.) and
softshell turtles (Trionychidae spp.) are valued for dietary purposes today, but the full range of
frogs, land and water turtles, turtle eggs, salamanders, and alligators (Alligator mississippiensis)
would have been useful for both prehistoric and early historic populations. A wide variety of
migratory birds, such as ducks, geese, and cranes, would have been most numerous in the late fall
and early winter, and other resident birds, such as turkeys (M. gallopavo) and doves (Zenaida
spp.), would have been available on a year-round basis.
22

Species of mammals that are known to have provided staple meat supplies for historic
southeastern Native American groups include deer (O. virginianus), black bear (Ursus
americanus), squirrel (Sciurus spp.), and rabbit (Sylvilagus spp.; Swanton 1946), and the same
was undoubtedly the case for early European populations. Other important mammal resources
included opossum (Didelphis virginiana) and raccoon (Procyon lotor). Additional mammals
present in Northeast Texas today include least shrew (Cryptotis parva), southeastern short-tailed
shrew (Blarina carolinensis), eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus), southeastern myotis (Myotis
aelleni), red bat (Lasiurus borealis), evening bat (Nycteceius humeralis), nine-banded armadillo
(Dasypus novemcinctus), eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), eastern harvest mouse
(Reithrodontomys humulis), fulvous harvest mouse (R. fulvescens), cotton mouse (Peromyscus
gossypinus), cotton rat (Sigmodon Hispidus), eastern wood rat (Neotoma floridana), woodland
vole (Microtus pinetorum), mink (Mustela vison), and river otter (Lutra canadensis; Schmidly
1983). Animal furs were one important resource of the early historic period, forming the basis of
the early fur trade in Louisiana and East Texas (Usner 1992). Valuable fur-bearing animals would
have included rabbit, beaver (Castor canadiens), raccoon, weasel and mink (Mustela spp.),
ringtail (Bassariscus astutus), opossum, red fox (Vulpes vulpes), gray fox (Urocyon
cinereoargenteus), bobcat (Felis rufus), coyote (Canis latrans), badger (Taxidea taxus), spotted
skunk (Spilogale spp.), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), and
otter. Many species, such as fish and waterfowl, may not presently be available within the area
but would have been available in the past.
Deer, rabbit, squirrel, and turtle have generally been among the most numerous animal remains
recovered from archeological sites in Northeast Texas (Bruseth and Perttula 1981); but deer, due
to its large size, actually provided the bulk of animal protein in the diet of prehistoric and early
historic peoples. Remains of reptiles other than turtle and small rodents have also been recovered
from archeological contexts at many sites in Texas, but it is uncertain whether or not they
contributed to the diet or were simply intrusive into the deposits (see Martin et al. 1987).
Obviously, the availability of these plant and animal resources may well have been different in
the past as a consequence of regional climatic alterations that have been documented in pollen
and geomorphological records in Texas and Oklahoma. In spite of this, faunal studies at
archeological sites, such as Rogers Rockshelter in southwestern Missouri, have shown that, as
climate changed over the past 9,000 to 10,000 years, different habitats comprising the mosaic of
the total environment responded by increasing or decreasing in size. The climatic shifts,
however, were never significant enough to precipitate a complete change in species composition
(Purdue 1983). Thus, the modern distribution of animal species is probably much the same as it
was in the past, with only the relative abundance of each species being different.

PALEOCLIMATIC RECONSTRUCTION
The prehistoric climatic history of Northeast Texas, as presently known, indicates a gradual
warming trend following the end of the Pleistocene, interrupted by a period of warmer
temperatures than those of today (Bryant and Holloway 1985:56–66; Delcourt and Delcourt
1985:12–22). During the Late Wisconsin Full-Glacial Interval (ca. 23,000–16,500 years ago), it
is believed that climatic conditions in Northeast Texas were much cooler and more mesic than
those of today (Bryant and Holloway 1985). The subsequent Late Wisconsin-Late Glacial
Interval (16,500–12,500 years ago) was apparently characterized by the persistence of a cool
climate with increased precipitation during the summer growing season (Delcourt and Delcourt
1985:18–19).
23

During the early Holocene period (12,500–8,500 years ago), tree species able to tolerate the cooltemperature, mesic conditions became dominant throughout the mid-latitudes of the southeastern
United States (Delcourt and Delcourt 1985:19). Reconstructed vegetation maps suggest that
Northeast Texas was located in the Southeastern Evergreen forest with a Mixed Deciduous forest
probably located to the north and west (Delcourt and Delcourt 1985:Figure 7b). Spruce trees
were probably no closer than 160 km away (Bryant and Holloway 1985:53–54). Whether or not
pollen data from the Ouachita Mountains are directly applicable to Northeast Texas remains to be
demonstrated, however. As Bryant and Holloway (1985:55) suggest, the changes during this
period were probably compositional in that the proportions of certain species increased while
others decreased.
The middle Holocene period (8,500–4,000 years ago) was a period of warming and drying that
resulted in the expansion of prairie at the expense of forest (Delcourt and Delcourt 1985:19).
Dates from Northcentral Texas suggest that the height of the warming trend in that area occurred
from 7,500 to 4,500 years ago (Ferring 1990:47–48, 1995:30). By 5,000 years ago, the large
areas of Mixed Deciduous forest to the north and west of Northeast Texas had migrated to the
northeast, and the Southeastern Evergreen Forest had shifted from being dominated by xeric
species of oak and hickory to being dominated by species of southern pine (Delcourt and
Delcourt 1985:Figure 7c, 20).
Data from several areas in Northeast Texas suggest that the mid-Holocene period of warming and
drying may have had a noticeable effect in that area. A matrix sample of organic carbon from a
loamy fluvial deposit in the flood plain of the East Fork of Elliott Creek in Bowie County yielded
an age of 6,370 ± 100 years before present (B.P.), which falls in the middle of this period (Peter et
al. 1991:Appendix H). A 13C/12C stable isotope ratio of -18.8 ‰ associated with this sample is
more enriched than the ratio of -23.5 ‰ associated with a soil with a modern date from the same
area, and suggests that C3 plants were a lesser component of the biosphere then than today, with
climatic conditions possibly harsher (i.e., warmer and drier). Two buried paleosols in the Sulphur
River flood plain in Cass County yielded dates that also fall within the middle Holocene
(6,540 ± 90 B.P. and 4,310 ± 90 B.P.; Cliff and Peter 1992). One of these two paleosols dates to
the middle of the warm, dry period, and the other dates just subsequent to its end. The stable
carbon isotope ratios for these two soils (-19.9 ‰ and -23.1 ‰, respectively) also are more
enriched than those of the modern soil and suggest climatic conditions that were warmer and drier
than today, with the harshest conditions occurring between approximately 6,500 and 6,000 years
ago. Although Northeast Texas probably was affected less than were areas farther west (see
Ferring 1995; Gadus et al. 1992), it apparently was not entirely unaffected. Delcourt and
Delcourt (1985:20–21) suggest that modern conditions, with minor fluctuations, became
prevalent subsequent to the beginning of the first millennium A.D.
After reviewing the paleoenvironmental data from Northcentral Texas and the adjacent Southern
Plains, Peter and Jurney (1988) suggest that a dry-moist-dry trend in effective moisture occurred
between 3,200 and 150 years ago. The initial dry period was projected prior to 1,950 years ago,
and a moist period followed until approximately 950 years ago. Between 950 and 700 years ago,
they suggested that drought conditions were prevalent and a drying trend that continues today was
initiated. Three paleosols dating to this period have been identified within the Sulphur River
flood plain in Cass County, one of which is very recent (3,480 ± 80 B.P., 3,030 ± 100 B.P., and
106.2 ± .8 percent of modern; Cliff and Peter 1992). These soils would probably have formed
under what were essentially modern climatic conditions, although the stable carbon isotope ratio
for the earliest soil (-24.4 ‰) suggests a higher component of C3 plants and moister conditions
24

than today; the ratio for the second soil (-21.9 ‰) suggests that C3 plants were a lesser component
of the biosphere with climatic conditions possibly harsher than today. The ratio for the recent soil
provides a baseline 13C/12C ratio (-23.5 ‰) for interpreting the data from the earlier periods.
Although an episodic cycle of late Holocene climatic change is the most plausible reconstruction
at the present time, there remains the problem of regional variability and the specificity of the
paleoenvironmental record. The nature and extent of the vegetation shifts associated with these
climatic fluctuations are very poorly understood. Throughout the entire Holocene, it is probable
that the environmental shifts were gradual and variable across the ecotonal border of the eastern
forests and the Southern Plains. It is also probable that the border did not shift in the normal
sense, but rather that the mosaic of habitat patches changed in character and size. Unfortunately,
an understanding of the timing and the nature of the Holocene environmental shifts in Northeast
Texas is very generalized at this time and relies too much upon data from other regions that may
or may not be applicable. Researchers will need to continue to pursue multiple lines of evidence
(i.e., palynology, dating, sedimentology, malacology, archeofauna, and stable isotopes) in order
to properly model the magnitude and timing of paleoenvironmental shifts in Northeast Texas.

CHAPTER 3
CULTURAL SETTING

INTRODUCTION
The following chapter is intended to provide a general background to the archeology of Northeast
Texas, while supplying the interested reader with sufficient references for a more in-depth
coverage of the topic. This chapter is divided into three sections, the first of which gives a brief
summary of previous archeological research carried out in East Texas. The second briefly
discusses the nature of the prehistoric and historic Native American archeological records in
broad terms, and the third considers the historic Euro-American and African-American settlement
in the area.

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Early archeological research in East Texas was intermittent and limited in scope. The earliest
known investigations were conducted in 1879–1880 by Edward Palmer of the Peabody Museum.
Although his primary occupation was the collection of plants, he also collected artifacts for the
museum and wanted to ascertain whether the “Mound Builders” were to be found in East Texas.
This investigation was apparently cursory, as Palmer concluded that mound sites were not to be
found in Texas (McVaugh 1956; Putnam 1880). After this, no archeology is known to have been
undertaken in East Texas until early in the twentieth century, when Clarence B. Moore of the
Philadelphia Academy of Science ascended the Red River to investigate the archeology of
Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas, publishing his findings in 1912. No excavations were
undertaken in Texas, but the Cabe Mounds site (41BW14), the E. H. Moores site (41BW2), and
the A. J. Hatchel site (41BW3) were examined (Moore 1912).
Beginning in the 1920s, more intensive and regionally based archeological investigations were
initiated by J. E. Pearce, the founder of the Department of Anthropology at the University of
Texas. Early research was concentrated in Northeast Texas due to the large number of mound
and burial sites reported for this region. In 1919, Pearce was able to get funding from the Bureau
of American Ethnology (BAE) that allowed a reconnaissance into Northeast Texas. Based on the
examination of numerous collections, visits to sites in 14 counties, and limited test excavations,
Pearce concluded that Northeast Texas had tremendous research potential (Barnard 1939; Pearce
27

1924, 1932a). Funding proved to be the major constraint on Pearce’s research, as he did not
receive another major grant until 1927, when he was awarded monies from the Laura Spelman
Rockefeller Foundation of New York City (Barnard 1939). From 1920 until 1935, Pearce and his
crews conducted excavations at approximately 123 sites in Northeast Texas. Gardner (1931),
Goldschmidt (1935a, 1935b), Jackson (1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1938), and Pearce (1931, 1932a,
1932b) have reported on some of those investigations.
Truly intensive archeological research had to wait until the Depression, when archeological
projects became one component of the Works Progress Administration (WPA), a federal jobs
program. Funding under the WPA greatly exceeded anything previously seen in Texas, allowing
extensive investigations at sites and the accumulation of a huge data base. Among the sites
investigated by the WPA in Northeast Texas were the Hatchel-Mitchell site complex (41BW3
and 41BW4, respectively) along the Red River (Davis 1970; Doran 1975; Dow 1987; Duffen et
al. 1940; Gilmore and McCormick 1980; Krieger 1946; Maples 1962; Suhm et al. 1954); the
George C. Davis site (41CE19) along the Neches River (Duffen et al. 1940; Ekland-Olson 1981;
Fritz 1975; Keller 1974; Newell and Krieger 1949; Shafer 1973; Spock 1977); and the Yarbrough
(41VN6) and Joslin (41VN3) sites in the Sabine River basin (Johnson 1962). Only interim
reports were published for much of that work; however, the data base thus derived has provided
fertile ground for later students. The WPA was ended when the preparations for World War II
terminated the need for a jobs program, and archeological research languished during the war.
Also during this period, an avocational archeologist, Dr. Clarence H. Webb of Shreveport,
Louisiana, began his involvement in archeology. Webb’s work in northern Louisiana and East
Texas was influential in the development of the regional culture history, especially for the
Caddoan tradition or periods (Ford and Webb 1956; Fulton and Webb 1953; Webb 1941, 1945,
1946, 1948a, 1948b, 1956, 1959, 1960, 1961, 1963, 1968; Webb and Dodd 1939, 1941; Webb
and McKinney 1975; Webb et al. 1969, 1971). Some of the sites excavated by Webb and his
associates include the Smithport Landing site (16DS4), the Belcher Mound site (16CD13), the
Gahagan Mound site (16RR1), the Mounds Plantation (16CD12), and the Resch site (41HS16).
At the same time, nonprofessionals and collectors from Dallas and Texarkana also began to
excavate into Caddoan mound and cemetery sites in extreme Northeast Texas (see, for example,
Harris 1953 and Miroir n.d.).
After World War II, there was no need for the WPA and large-scale investigations were no longer
funded by the federal government. However, since the government was proposing the
construction of a series of reservoirs across the country, it was determined that archeological
investigations would be funded in order to salvage some of the data that would otherwise be
destroyed. The National Park Service served as the lead agency for this work, but the actual
fieldwork was undertaken by the River Basin Survey (RBS), which was formed as a part of the
BAE. Investigations undertaken at relevant lakes by the RBS and successor organizations
included Lake O’ The Pines (Davis 1958, 1970; Davis and Gipson 1960; Davis and Golden 1960;
Davis 1961; Jelks and Tunnell 1959; Lisk 1984; Miller et al. 1951; Thurmond 1981, 1990;
Tunnell 1959; Turner 1978); Wright Patman Lake (Briggs and Malone 1970; Jelks 1961;
Stephenson 1950); and Lake Tawakoni (Duffield 1961; Duffield and Jelks 1961; Johnson 1957).
Beginning in the late 1960s, the federal and state governments began to require consideration of
the potential environmental impacts of government-funded projects. These regulations included
assessing the impacts to archeological resources, and during the last several decades, the gradual
growth of the cultural resources management (CRM) industry, composed of government
28

agencies, universities, and private companies, has taken place. Survey and testing were
undertaken at a number of East Texas reservoirs during this period, including Lake Bob Sandlin
(Driggers 1985; Flaigg 1982; Herrington 1979; Hsu 1969; Sullivan 1975; Thurmond 1981, 1990);
Lake Fork Reservoir (Bruseth 1975; Bruseth and Perttula 1981; Bruseth et al. 1977; Crane 1982;
Perttula and Bruseth 1983; Skiles et al. 1980; Skinner 1975; Thurmond 1985); Black Cypress
Reservoir (Northern and Skiles 1981); Big Sandy Reservoir (Gibson 1982; Perttula et al. 1986);
and Lake Gilmer (Horizon Environmental Services, Inc., 1992; Nichols et al. 1997). In addition,
further investigations were undertaken at previously inundated lakes such as Lake O’ The Pines
(Gulf South Research Institute 1974; Thurmond 1981, 1990), Wright Patman Lake (Owens and
Hunt 1999; Shiner 1982; White et al. 1995), and Caddo Lake (Campbell et al. 1983; Gibson
1969; Gulf South Research Institute 1974; Thurmond 1981, 1990).
Two large, recent projects near Wright Patman Lake have been undertaken at the White Oak
Creek Wildlife Management Area (WOCWMA) in Cass, Bowie, Morris, and Titus counties and
at the Red River Army Depot and Lone Star Army Ammunition Plant (RRAD/LSAAP) in Bowie
County. The former was developed by the USACE to mitigate the loss of wildlife habitat due to
inundation of Cooper Lake farther upstream along the Sulphur River. WOCWMA consists of
approximately 25,000 acres of bottomlands and the adjacent upland margins along White Oak
Creek and the Sulphur River. These investigations began with the preparation of a research
design to guide the work (Peter et al. 1990) and have included surveys (Cliff 1994; Cliff and Peter
1992; Cliff, White, Hunt, Pleasant, and Shaw 1996), site testing (Cliff and Hunt 1995; Largent et
al. 1995), and data recovery (Cliff, Green, Hunt, Shanabrook, and Peter 1996). The other project
consisted of a series of studies designed to inventory and evaluate the cultural resources present
in the RRAD/LSAAP in central Bowie County. These investigations have included surveys
(Cliff and Peter 1994a; Cliff, Hunt, Green, Peter, and Kent 1996; Gadus and Freeman 1998;
Newman 1988; Peter and Cliff 1990a, 1990b), limited testing (Cliff and Peter 1988), and the
preparation of a cultural resources management plan, including an overview of Bowie County and
the Great Bend in general (Peter et al. 1991:Appendix I).
In 1991 and 1992, the Texas Archeological Society (TAS) conducted field school excavations
under the direction of staff members of the Texas Historical Commission (THC) at several sites
in the vicinity of the Sam Kaufman/Arnold Roitsch site (41RR16) in Red River County,
northwest of Wright Patman Lake (Bruseth 1992; Bruseth et al. 1991:1, 6–9; Martin 1992; Prikryl
1992; THC 1991:11–13). This research program included excavations at the Fasken Mounds site
(41RR14), the Ray site (41LR135), Salt Well Slough (41RR204), and the Kaufman/Roitsch site
itself. Also as part of this research effort, survey operations were conducted within the Big Pine
Creek drainage to the west, recording or re-recording 109 sites (THC 1991:13). To the west of
Wright Patman Lake, in Titus and Franklin counties, extensive cultural resources investigations
have been undertaken by Espey, Huston and Associates (EHA), Inc., in association with surface
coal mining projects. At the Monticello B-2 Mine, north of Mount Pleasant, 237 prehistoric and
historic archeological sites were recorded within approximately 20,000 acres (Jones et al. 1993).
Subsequently, testing was conducted at six prehistoric sites in 1991 (Kotter et al. 1993) and an
additional 10 sites in 1993 (Nash et al. 1995). On the basis of this work, data recovery was
conducted at two sites in 1993 and 1994 (Dixon et al. 1995, 1998; Perttula et al. 1998).
Additional site testing in 1996 resulted in data recovery at the Ear Spool site (41TT653), a Late
Caddoan Titus phase farmstead (Galan 1998). Elsewhere in Titus County, a survey of 2,716
acres at the Monticello I Area, southwest of Mount Pleasant, recorded another 22 prehistoric and
historic sites (Hoyt et al. 1994).

29

Cultural resources management has also provided the impetus for many projects near Lake O’
The Pines. Several lignite mines have been examined in the area, including Leesburg in Camp
County; and in Harrison County, Karnack (Heartfield, Price, and Green, Inc., 1986), Darco
(Carlson 1985; Corbin et al. 1976; Perttula and Skiles 1987; Studer 1980, 1982), and South
Hallsville (Dibble 1977; Freeman 1978; Keller 1990a, 1990b, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996a, 1996b,
1998, 1999, 2000a, 2000b; LaVardera 1983a, 1983b, 1984a, 1984b, 1985; North American
Consultants, Inc., 1984, 1985). In addition, intensive CRM studies have been undertaken at the
Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant in eastern Harrison County, near Karnack (Cliff and Peter
1994b; Cliff, Hunt, Kent, Green, and Peter 1995; Cliff, Peter, Largent, and Waite 1996; Dieste et
al. 1985; Peter and Stiles-Hanson 1989). More recent work in the Caddo Lake area has focused
on surveys of Harrison Bayou (Perttula and Nelson 1999) and test excavations at the Timber Hill
site, a historic Caddoan village on James Bayou (McCrocklin 1998; Parsons 1999).
Other recent archeological activities of importance in Northeast Texas include the 1987
excavation by the Texas Department of Highways and Public Transportation of a small Caddoan
hamlet and cemetery at the Murphy Branch site (41MX5) north of White Oak Creek (Brewington
and Dockall 1991; Brewington et al. 1995; Wormser 1988); data recovery at site 41BW422 along
Barkman Creek north of Hooks in Bowie County (Tucker 1994); excavations at the Oak Hill
Village site (41RK214), a large Caddoan village in Rusk County (Cruse 1995); excavations at the
Rookery Ridge site (41UR133), a Late Caddoan hamlet at Lake Gilmer in Upshur County
(Parsons 1998); and data recovery at the Pilgrim’s Pride site (41CP304), an Archaic and Late
Caddoan Titus phase site in Camp County (Perttula 1999). Recent investigations at or near Lake
O’ The Pines include several timber-cutting-area surveys (Burson and Cliff 2000; Cliff and Hunt
1998; Hunt et al. 2002; Hunt and Borrego 2002; Hunt and Cliff 1998a, 1998b; Hunt et al. 1995;
Linder-Linsley and Lindsay 1997, 1998; Moore et al. 1998), a survey of two proposed pump
stations (Brazos Valley Research Associates 1997), a City of Longview water pipeline (Perttula
and Nelson 1998, 1999), a power transmission line survey for Southwestern Electric Power
Company (Campbell 2000); and investigations by the Friends of Northeast Texas Archeology
archeologists (Perttula and Nelson 1997, 2001; Perttula et al. 1996). Parts of the pump station,
water pipeline, and power line surveys (Brazos Valley Research Associates 1997; Perttula and
Nelson 1998; and Campbell 2000, respectively) overlap the current project areas.

NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY
The following brief discussion of the prehistoric archeological record in the vicinity of Lake O’
The Pines in Northeast Texas draws from previous summaries by Perttula (1988), Story (1981,
1985, 1990), and Thurmond (1985, 1988, 1990). Due to what appears to be increasing regional
differentiation through time, the cultural sequences for the Great Bend Region (including nearby
Wright Patman Lake) and the western Cypress Creek basin (including Lake O’ The Pines)
diverge in the Caddoan period. The cultural sequences for each area are presented in Table 1, and
presented separately in the subsequent discussion of the Caddoan period.

Paleo-Indian Period
Although a pre-Clovis occupation of the New World has long been suggested (e.g., Adovasio et
al. 1990; Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990; McGahey n.d.;
Meltzer 1989), this evidence was not widely accepted until the recent finds at the Monte Verde

site in Chile, which yielded compelling evidence for human occupation of the New World prior to
12,000 years ago (Collins 1997; Dillehay 1997). Within the southern United States, however, the
evidence for a pre-Clovis occupation remains disputed, and thus the Paleo-Indian period remains
the earliest recognized human habitation in Texas.
The Paleo-Indian period in Northeast Texas (ca. 9500–7000 B.C.) generally includes those
remains of human presence that can be dated to the terminal Pleistocene and the immediate postPleistocene periods (for recent reviews of this period in Northeast Texas, see Johnson 1989; Peter
et al. 1991:Appendix I; and Story 1990). As a matter of convenience, the period can be
subdivided into an early Paleo-Indian period (ca. 9500–8500 B.C.) and a late Paleo-Indian period
(8500–7000 B.C.). Unfortunately, although numerous diagnostic projectile points, such as Clovis,
Plainview, Dalton, Scottsbluff, and San Patrice, have been recovered as isolated surface finds or
excavated in later contexts (Carley n.d.; Perttula 1988:17), few Paleo-Indian sites in good
31

stratigraphic context have been found (Perttula 1988:17; Preston 1972, 1974), and fewer have
received any sort of systematic excavation. Both Perttula and Story noted the possible presence
of horizontally stratified, early Paleo-Indian deposits at the Forrest Murphey site (41MR62) at
Lake O’ The Pines, but the site was reportedly destroyed by dam construction before being
excavated (Perttula 1988:17; Perttula et al. 1986:47; Story 1990:184–185). The situation of the
Murphey site and the discovery of the deeply buried Clovis-age Aubrey site (41DN479) along the
Elm Fork of the Trinity River in Northcentral Texas (Ferring 1989, 1990, 2001) suggest that wellpreserved Paleo-Indian sites in North Texas will only be found by examining deeply stratified
Pleistocene terraces or by penetrating more recent Holocene alluvium in modern flood plains.
Despite the lack of good data relating to the early Paleo-Indian period in Northeast Texas, some
attempts have been made to generalize regarding settlement mobility and intensity of site
occupation, drawing on the limited data that are known and on assumptions based on
comparisons with other areas. For instance, a number of researchers have seen evidence for a
high degree of group mobility in the broad distribution of Paleo-Indian artifacts over the
landscape and in the variety of presumably nonlocal lithic raw materials from which they were
made (Meltzer and Smith 1986; Shafer 1977; Story 1990:177). Likewise, the well-documented
exploitation of large megafauna by Paleo-Indians in the western United States, coupled with the
known presence of similar species in Northeast Texas between 11,000 and 9,000 years ago (see
Hemmings 1983; Slaughter and Hoover 1963), has resulted in the popular conclusion that “big
game hunting” was part of the Paleo-Indian subsistence strategy in Northeast Texas. Although a
possible association between a Clovis point and mastodon remains at the Murphey site (Story
1990:185) does support this likelihood, increasing evidence from sites to the west (such as the
Aubrey site) suggests that Paleo-Indian groups were less dependent upon “big game hunting”
than has been assumed in the past.
The late Paleo-Indian period in Northeast Texas appears to be distinguished by the divergence of
the earlier, widespread fluted point tradition into several distinctive subtraditions. The first of
these includes Scottsbluff, Plainview, and similar lanceolate points that appear to be part of a
more western or “plains-derived” subtradition in terms of origin and style; the second includes the
Dalton and Dalton-related projectile points that have a wide distribution throughout the wooded
southeastern and midwestern United States. Some researchers have suggested that this Dalton
horizon represents an adaptation to the changing environment at the end of the Pleistocene
(Goodyear 1982:389–391), a view that has found some support in the addition of the Dalton adze,
a presumed “heavy, woodworking tool,” to what otherwise is viewed as a Paleo-Indian tool kit
(Kelley et al. 1988:21). San Patrice, an important complex that may be related to Dalton, is found
in eastern Texas, southeastern Oklahoma, northern Louisiana, and southern Arkansas and is
characterized by San Patrice points, Keithville points, and Albany scrapers (Ensor 1987;
Schambach 1979; Webb et al. 1971).

Archaic Period
With the end of the Ice Age, the prehistoric residents of North America began to develop into
localized populations of efficient hunter-gatherers, exploiting localized resource bases. This
period, and the subsistence pattern that characterizes it, has come to be known as the Archaic.
The Archaic represents a long period of time that was characterized by only gradual and minor
changes in subsistence patterns, lithic technology, and projectile point styles, and was apparently
a period of strong cultural stability. Archaic populations are usually portrayed as generalized
32

hunters and gatherers with more limited geographic ranges than the preceding Paleo-Indian
peoples. At the present time, there is no evidence for the development of local cultigens during
the Archaic period in Texas, although this is not the case for the Ozark Highlands and other parts
of the eastern United States.
The Archaic period in Northeast Texas is tentatively dated to between 7000 and 200 B.C. As is
true for many areas, a threefold division of the Archaic period, consisting of early, middle, and
late subperiods, has been applied in Northeast Texas. Although reliable dating for the Archaic
period in this area of Texas is virtually nonexistent, these divisions have been given tentative
dates on the basis of better-dated sites in surrounding areas. Thus the Early Archaic has been
defined from 7000 to 4000 B.C., the Middle Archaic from 4000 to 2000 B.C., and the Late Archaic
from 2000 to 200 B.C. (overviews that cover the Archaic in this portion of Texas include Fields
and Tomka 1993; Peter et al. 1991:Appendix I; and Story 1985, 1990). Archaic remains are
usually found in upland settings and are frequently mixed with later material (Campbell et al.
1983; Story 1981). General trends that have been proposed as characterizing the Archaic period
in Northeast Texas include an increasingly complex settlement system, increasing population size
and density, increasing sedentism, and the development of distinct group territories (Perttula
1988:17; Story 1985:52). Despite these changes, however, no evidence of any level of food
production (even incipient production) has been reported from any Northeast Texas Archaic site
(Perttula 1988:17; Story 1990:Table 56), in spite of the fact that definite steps toward food
production were being taken elsewhere in the eastern United States at this time (Ford 1985:347–
349; Watson 1988).
During the Early Archaic (ca. 7000–4000 B.C.), the occurrence of small and widely distributed
sites has been suggested to reflect high group mobility within large and poorly defined territories,
based on a generalized hunting and gathering economy (Meltzer and Smith 1986; Story 1985:35,
39). Projectile point forms that may be associated with the Early Archaic in Northeast Texas
include Kirk, Keithville, Palmer, Cossatot, Dawson, and Wells (Story 1990; Thurmond 1990).
In comparison to the Early Archaic, the Middle Archaic period (4000–2000 B.C.) appears to be
characterized by an increased diversity of tool types; greater interregional variability; the addition
of ground, pecked, and polished stone tools; and an increased use of plant foods as indicated by
the addition of mortars, pestles, and milling stones (Neuman 1984:77, 79). The dependence upon
abundant forest resources (e.g., oak mast production, deer, and small mammals) that are evenly
distributed over most of the region probably resulted in evenly distributed population densities
and favored the development of exclusive or “fixed” territories (Plog and Upham 1983:202; Story
1985:41). Although grinding stones apparently were introduced during the Early Archaic period,
it was not until the Middle Archaic that their use became widespread. Grinding and polishing
were used to produce grooved axes, atlatl weights, and ground stone pendants during this period.
Diagnostic dart points that may be associated with the Middle Archaic include Big Sandy, Calf
Creek, Johnson, Carrollton, Morrill, Evans, Lone Oak, Trinity, and Wesley (Story 1990;
Thurmond 1990).
Population density may have reached a peak during the Late Archaic period in Northeast Texas
(ca. 2000–200 B.C.) as evidenced by an apparent increase in the number of sites, a greater
distribution of sites over the landscape, and evidence of increasing degrees of sedentism. At the
same time, group mobility may have become more limited and interregional contact may have
become much more common. If the greater spatial dispersal of sites is not a result of sampling
error due to unequal destruction or burial of earlier sites, it may reflect an economic system with
33

increasing reliance on all available floral and faunal resources, although the economic data to
support this view are generally absent. Throughout Northeast Texas, Late Archaic period sites
are relatively common in the uplands and a number are known from the flood plain of the Red
River, but no regional phases have yet been identified (Schambach 1982a:3–6). Dart points that
may be diagnostic of the Late Archaic include Lange, Castroville, Ellis, Palmillas, Edgewood,
Yarbrough, Ensor, and Kent (Story 1990; Thurmond 1990).

Early Ceramic Period
The Early Ceramic period (200 B.C.–A.D. 800) in Northeast Texas is generally not well defined
and is largely identified by similarities in pottery and projectile points to sites of the Fourche
Maline tradition north of the Red River (recent overviews that provide good information for this
period include Perttula et al. 1993; Peter et al. 1991:Appendix I; and Story 1990). Diagnostic
artifacts consist of coarse plainware ceramics, tempered with either clay/grog or bone, and Gary
projectile points. The ceramics generally are grouped together as Williams Plain; but given the
wide range of temporal and spatial variability present, they should probably be viewed as one or
more undefined varieties of that type. Elsewhere in Texas, sandy paste ceramics (cf., Bear Creek
Plain and Goose Creek Plain) appear to be common on Early Ceramic period sites from the
Sabine River south to the Gulf Coast (Story 1981:146). Discounting ceramic differences at the
varietal level, the remains of the Early Ceramic period in Northeast Texas seem to be most
closely related to Schambach’s (1982b:188) Fourche Maline tradition in Arkansas. Despite other
similarities to Fourche Maline, however, no Early Ceramic period burial mounds are known in
the Texas portion of the Great Bend. The few that are known in East Texas occur to the south in
the Sabine and Neches river basins around the Toledo Bend and Sam Rayburn areas (see Story
1990:Figure 41) at the Coral Snake (16SA48) and Jonas Short (41SA25) mound sites (Jensen
1968; McClurkan et al. 1966, 1980). The lack of such evidence in Northeast Texas leaves open
the question of whether or not this area was undergoing the same processes of cultural evolution
presumably responsible for the development of burial mound use elsewhere (see Perttula
1988:18; Story 1990).
Perttula (1988:18) has noted what appears to be a major presence of Early Ceramic period
occupation within the Sulphur River basin, although this may be more the result of intensity of
research or factors of site preservation rather than the actual presence of a large Early Ceramic
population. In regard to modeling settlement patterns during this period, Perttula (1988:18)
suggests that “Early Ceramic or Fourche Maline settlements are . . . represented by villages and
hamlets in the flood plains or terraces of larger streams, and by smaller components in the
uplands.” Many of the sites on which Perttula bases this model, including Snipes at Wright
Patman Lake (Jelks 1961) and Tick, Thomas, Hurricane Hill, and Lawson at Cooper Lake
(Doehner and Larson 1978; Martin 1996a, 1996b; Perttula 1990), contain middens that are taken
as indicating a more sedentary settlement pattern than that of the preceding Archaic period. Two
apparent pits (Features 1 and 2) radiocarbon-dated to the Early Ceramic period (1,460 ± 60 B.P.
and 2,090 ± 30 B.P., respectively) at 41HP137 at Cooper Lake yielded hickory nut, acorn, wild
tubers (possibly the Prairie turnip, Pediomelum or Psoralea sp.), and what may be fragments of
cultivated squash or gourd (Fields et al. 1994:12; McGregor 1996:357).

34

Caddoan Period in the Great Bend Region
The Formative (A.D. 800–1000) and Early Caddoan (A.D. 1000–1200) periods in the Great Bend
region are not well defined. Ceramics for both of these periods include Hickory Fine Engraved,
Carmel Engraved, Crockett Curvilinear Incised, and Pennington Punctated-Incised (Thurmond
1990:Table 8). Thurmond has further distinguished between equivalents of these two periods on
the basis of the presence of Davis Incised, Holly Fine Engraved, Kiam Incised, Spiro Engraved,
and Weches Fingernail Impressed (along with some late varieties of Coles Creek types) in the
earlier, and of Canton Incised, Haley Engraved, Maxey Noded Redware, Sanders Engraved, and
Sanders Plain in the later, although some researchers are more inclined to put the latter four types
in the Middle Caddoan period.
The Formative and Early Caddoan periods are characterized by what may best be termed the Alto
complex or Alto sphere, a widespread manifestation related to the Alto phase, originally defined
at the George C. Davis site in Cherokee County, Texas, south of the Great Bend area (Newell and
Krieger 1949). The Alto complex shows strong influence from Coles Creek to the east and
appears to partially overlap it in time. It also, however, shows a number of new characteristics
(Neuman 1970), including new projectile point types (i.e., Hayes and Homan arrow points), new
ceramic vessel forms (i.e., the carinated bowl and the bottle), and a new mode of vessel
decoration (i.e., fine engraving with red pigment filler).
Perttula (1988:18) has suggested that these and other cultural innovations, including the
introduction of the bow and arrow and increased food production based on maize, led to increases
in population and sociopolitical complexity during these periods. The settlement system became
increasingly complex, apparently involving sedentary villages and farmsteads, special function
sites (what Binford [1980] has called logistical camps), and mound centers that were presumably
ritual or ceremonial in function (see Perttula 1988:18–19). A number of such mound centers
dating to the Formative and Early Caddoan periods occur in Northeast Texas, including the T. M.
Coles or Mustang Creek Mound (Jackson 1931) on a tributary of the Sulphur River to the west of
Wright Patman Lake, and several mounds at the lake itself (Stephenson 1950). Many more
mound sites occur along the Red River and its immediate tributaries to the north (Banks 1983;
Miller 1986; Taylor 1949).
The Middle Caddoan period (A.D. 1200–1400) in the Great Bend region includes what is known
as the Haley phase, the definition of which is based generally on mortuary data, largely from C.
B. Moore’s excavations at the Haley site (3MI1) in Arkansas (Moore 1912). The Haley phase
appears to represent a development out of the earlier Alto complex, and among the continuities
from the earlier period is the use of shaft grave burials for some members of the society, who
were accompanied into the afterlife by relatively rich grave offerings (Kelley et al. 1988:26).
This phase was centered in the Great Bend area in Arkansas, but northwestern Louisiana and
northeastern Texas did fall within its peripheral influence. A Haley phase component has been
recognized at the Hatchel site in Bowie County (Davis 1970:44), and other Haley components are
known in the area, including the Cabe Mounds site (Perttula et al. 1995) and the Mitchell site
(Cliff et al. 1997). Coker Mound (41CS1) also apparently has a Haley phase component, based
on radiocarbon dates and a reported Haley Engraved bottle in a mortuary feature (Perttula,
Turner, and Nelson 1997:17–20). Despite its presence in Texas, however, the Haley phase was
apparently most fully elaborated in the Arkansas portion of the Great Bend.

35

Most of the well-known Haley phase components, especially in Arkansas, relate to mound
centers, although it is unclear whether or not all of them were associated with villages (Wyckoff
1974). One well-investigated nonmound habitation site is known from Arkansas and is
apparently a small farmstead located on “a natural levee” or “high ground overlooking riverine
bottom lands” (Wyckoff 1974:106, 113). The site contained two circular house structures and a
small trash dump and has suggested to some that the Haley phase settlement pattern involved
small, dispersed farmsteads surrounding vacant ceremonial centers (Hoffman 1970). Wyckoff
(1974:107) also notes, however, the existence of mound centers with “potentially large villages,”
as well as nonmound cemeteries located close to mound centers. Finally, he states that:
[t]here is certainly an overall tendency for the Haley components, mound centers and non-mound
habitation areas alike, to associate with a riverine valley setting. Most of the mound centers did occur
in the valleys of major streams, but [some mound centers] were on the flood plains of streams tributary
to the major rivers [Wyckoff 1974:112].

In regard to sociopolitical organization within Haley phase society, the complexity of the
mortuary ceremonialism and apparent status ranking evident in the burials recovered from Haley
phase sites, as well as the presumed organizational control necessary to construct the mound
centers, strongly suggest that there was “a political and religious hierarchy that operated
throughout the Haley Focus [sic] society” (Wyckoff 1974:110).
The Late Caddoan period (A.D. 1400–1680) includes the final part of the prehistoric period and
the initial years of European contact (for an overview of this period and the subsequent Historic
Caddoan period, see Perttula 1992). The survivors of the de Soto entrada apparently entered
Northeast Texas about midway through the Late Caddoan period, the latter part of which appears
to have overlapped with the initial movements of seventeenth-century European explorers and
traders into northeastern Texas.
In the lower Sulphur River basin, two archeological complexes have been defined for the Late
Caddoan period, the Titus phase and the Texarkana phase (Schambach 1982a; Thurmond 1985).
The Titus phase appears to be centered between the Sabine and Sulphur rivers in the Northeast
Texas pineywoods and post oak savanna. The Texarkana phase is located in the upper portion of
the Great Bend of the Red River and extends southward to include a portion of the lower Sulphur
River drainage (Wyckoff 1974:Figure 4). The definition of the Texarkana phase is based largely
on WPA excavations conducted at the Hatchel mound and at the Mitchell and Moores cemeteries
situated on the Red River northwest of Texarkana (Davis 1970:50–51). Texarkana phase sites,
such as Sherwin on the lower Sulphur River, probably existed as satellites to these larger,
permanent settlements on the Red River (Perttula 1988).
Both the Titus and Texarkana phases appear to be characterized by small hamlets or farmsteads
that were probably occupied by small family groups of shifting agriculturists. These farmsteads
were apparently characterized by a limited number of structures and a small family cemetery (see
Brewington and Dockall 1991; Brewington et al. 1995; Jelks 1961; Perttula 1988; and Wormser
1988). They presumably were associated with larger, more permanent suprahousehold sites,
including both mound centers and nonmound cemeteries, which served to integrate the scattered
households into a unified social group.

Caddoan Period in the Cypress Creek Basin
The Caddoan period in the Cypress Creek basin has been subdivided into early, middle, and late
subperiods: the Early Caddoan from ca. A.D. 800–1300, the Middle Caddoan from ca. A.D. 1300–
1400, and the Late Caddoan from A.D. 1400–1600 (see Thurmond 1990:39–40). Thurmond’s
(1990) Early Caddoan period includes components related to the Alto and Sanders foci and is
subdivided into two parts. Ceramic types characteristic of Period 1 (A.D. 800–1100) include
Holly Fine Engraved, Hickory Fine Engraved, Spiro Engraved, Kiam Incised, Weches Fingernail
Impressed, and Coles Creek Incised; Williams Plain ceramics also are found. During Period 2
(A.D. 1100–1300), ceramic types shift to Sanders Engraved, Hickory Fine Engraved, Sanders
Plain, and Canton Incised; Williams Plain makes up a smaller part of the assemblage than
previously. Arrow points for the Early Caddoan period as a whole include Alba, Bonham,
Catahoula, and Scallorn (Thurmond 1990:226–227).
The Middle Caddoan period in the western Cypress Creek basin is seen as being transitional from
the Early Caddoan Period 2 to the Late Caddoan Whelan phase. Thurmond identifies only 14
sites for this period, all of which are found in the upper reaches of Big Cypress Creek. Ceramic
types identified for this period include Ripley Engraved, Avery Engraved, Canton Incised,
Maydelle Incised, Bullard Brushed, Pease Brushed-Incised, and La Rue Neck-Banded. Projectile
point types found during this period are Bonham, Catahoula, Alba, Perdiz, and Clifton
(Thurmond 1990:227–228).
The eastern and western portions of the Cypress Creek basin show distinct differences in material
culture during the Late Caddoan period, with a dividing line close to the western end of Caddo
Lake. In the eastern side of the basin, the Late Caddoan period includes the Bossier and Belcher
phases, while in the western side of the basin (which includes Lake O’ The Pines) are the Whelan
(A.D. 1350–1430) and Titus (A.D. 1430–1680) phases. Thurmond (1990) labels the western group
the Cypress cluster. He believes this represents the formation of a distinct social group,
equivalent to the Kadohadacho and Hasinai confederacies known ethnographically (Thurmond
1985).
The Whelan phase is the earlier temporal phase identified for the Cypress cluster. Engraved
ceramics from Whelan phase sites consist primarily of Ripley Engraved, with smaller amounts of
Taylor Engraved and Wilder Engraved. Motifs observed on Ripley Engraved ceramics include
the scroll, scroll and circle, alternating nested triangle, horizontal diamond, and bisected diamond,
with the border elements usually being filled with curvilinear hachures. Utility wares from this
period are significantly different from Early Caddoan utility wares. Body sherds are about
equally divided between brushed and plain ceramics, while other treatments, such as incising,
punctation, fingernail-impression, and red-filming, become minor parts of the assemblage.
Brushed ceramics are about equally divided between Bullard Brushed and Pease Brushed-Incised;
plain-bodied vessels are primarily classified as Maydelle Incised, and La Rue Neck-Banded
pottery is uncommon. Arrow points typical of this period are Perdiz and Scallorn (Thurmond
1990:228).
The succeeding Titus phase represents the final prehistoric occupation of the upper Cypress
Creek basin. The engraved ceramics are still dominated by Ripley Engraved, although Taylor
Engraved and Wilder Engraved are more common than in the Whelan phase, and two new types,
Bailey Engraved and Johns Engraved, appear. A new motif for Ripley Engraved, the pendant
triangle, appears to be limited to this phase. Border elements change from the curvilinear
37

hachures of the Whelan phase to broad, deeply excised areas. Specialized ceramics, such as
Killough Pinched jars, zoomorphic effigy bowls, and noded rattle bowls become more common
during the Titus phase. Utility wares also underwent a great deal of change from the preceding
period. Brushed ceramics are reduced in frequency compared to the Whelan phase, and a new
decorative element, appliqué, is introduced. Pease Brushed-Incised virtually disappears from the
assemblage, while Maydelle Incised is found in slightly reduced frequencies as compared to the
Whelan phase, and La Rue Neck-Banded remains constant. Two new types, Harleton Appliqué
and a type similar to McKinney Plain, are introduced during this period. Extensive trade contacts
with the McCurtain phase to the north are indicated by the occurrence of Avery Engraved, Bowie
Engraved, Cass Appliqué, and Simms Engraved ceramics at Titus phase sites. Similar contacts
with the Belcher phase to the east appear to be limited to the adjacent sites of the Titus phase.
Perdiz and Scallorn arrow points continue into the Titus phase and Bassett, Maud, Reed, and
Talco points are introduced (Thurmond 1990:228–229).
Thurmond (1990:229–233) has defined four regional subclusters within the Titus phase—Three
Basins, Tankersley Creek, Swauano Creek, and Big Cypress Creek. These subclusters are
hypothesized to represent discrete social groups. The Big Cypress Creek subcluster is
concentrated at Lake O’ The Pines, with two outliers found to the south along Little Cypress
Creek and the Sabine River. Engraved ceramics characteristic of this subcluster consist primarily
of Ripley Engraved and Taylor Engraved; Bailey Engraved, Johns Engraved, and Wilder
Engraved are relatively insignificant. Decorative motifs seen on Ripley Engraved ceramics are
mostly of the pendant triangle type, although the scroll, scroll and circle, and circle and
continuous scroll are not uncommon. Bullard Brushed and Karnack Brushed-Incised are the
dominant types of utilitarian ceramics, and Harleton Appliqué, Maydelle Incised, and the
McKinney Plain-like ceramics are less common than in the other subclusters. Belcher phase
trade vessels are also present, especially at the easternmost sites. The primary arrow point is the
Talco, although Maud and Bassett points are also present.
The Titus phase is somewhat imprecisely dated from ca. A.D. 1450 to perhaps as late as A.D. 1680
(Thurmond 1990; Perttula 1992). This evidence includes the reputed recovery by a private
collector of glass beads from a burial at the Tracey site (41CP71), which is a part of the Big
Cypress subcluster, and the discovery of the Wichita ceramic types Womack Engraved and
Womack Plain from the Culpepper (41HP1) and the W. A. Ford (41TT2) sites of the Three
Basins subcluster (Scurlock 1962; Thurmond 1990:233). Thurmond (1990:233) believes that,
considering the large number of Titus phase burials investigated over the years, the dearth of
historic material indicates a real decline in the Titus phase and an abandonment of the western
Cypress Creek basin prior to the beginning of the historic period.
Thurmond’s (1990:233) reconstruction is that the people represented by the Cypress cluster were
reduced by disease in the Protohistoric period, with the result that, by the time the Spanish and
French became permanently established in the area, the upper Cypress Creek basin had been
abandoned. He identifies the Cypress cluster with the Lacane, a group visited by the de Soto
expedition in 1542. The Spanish exposed the Lacane to a variety of diseases to which they had
no resistance. Such diseases have been suggested to have had significant impacts upon other
groups in the Southeast (Dobyns 1983; Dye 1989; Murray 1989:49; Perttula et al. 1986:186–189;
Smith 1989). Following this episode, the remnants of the Lacane left the area and took refuge
with the Hasinai and/or the Kadohadacho confederacies.

38

Historic Caddoan Period
The Historic Caddoan period (A.D. 1680–1860) began with the founding of La Salle’s short-lived
French colony on the Texas coast and ended with the expulsion of the Caddo from Texas in 1859.
During the closing decades of the seventeenth century, French explorers (including the Sieur de
Tonti, Bienville, and St. Denis) traveled through the upper Red River valley and made contact
with the Native Americans residing in the area. The primary Native American groups inhabiting
the Great Bend region at that time consisted of Caddoan speakers, presumably descendants of
groups that had inhabited the area at least as far back as A.D. 800.
The groups that appear to have been closest to the project areas comprised the Kadohadacho
Confederacy (Swanton 1946:141). The confederacy was originally composed of five groups—
the Kadohadacho, the Petit Caddo, the Upper Natchitoches, the Upper Nasoni, and the
Nanatsoho. According to Williams (1974:286), the Upper Yatasi and the Cahinnio joined the
confederacy at a later time, possibly in the early eighteenth century in the case of the Cahinnio
and in the 1760s in the case of the Yatasi. The confederacy apparently controlled the entire Texas
portion of the Great Bend region. Don Domingo de los Rios, who in 1692 visited one of the
Kadohadacho villages located just above the Great Bend of the Red River near present-day
Texarkana (Swanton 1946:57), noted that their power extended as far south as Big Cypress Creek
(Hackney 1966:3). The origins of the confederacy are unknown at present, but it may have arisen
as a result of what was probably a severe demographic impact resulting from the de Soto entrada
(cf., Smith 1989).
Between 1788 and 1800, the groups of the Kadohadacho Confederacy were forced south into
Louisiana due to the severity of raids by the Osage (Smith 1995:82–83; Williams 1974:297). At
that time, they settled on Caddo Lake, about 35 miles west of the main branch of the Red River
(Smith 1995:83), where they were encountered by Freeman and Custis in 1806 (Flores 1984:16,
fn 3). In the Caddo Treaty of 1835, the Kadohadacho sold their land in the United States and
agreed to leave the country within one year (Smith 1995:122; Williams 1974:309); but as late as
1840, one band remained in the Caddo Lake area, possibly in the same village, which was along
the Louisiana-Texas border (Smith 1995:143–146). In 1841, this band joined the rest of the
Kadohadacho in Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma) north of the Red River (Smith
1995:146). The rest of the Caddo remained in Texas, and by 1854 they were residing, along with
other Native American groups, on a tract of land on the Brazos River in Northcentral Texas.
Subsequently, they were removed north to Indian Territory in 1859 (Swanton 1946:99).
After the abandonment of the Great Bend region by the Kadohadacho, groups of displaced Native
Americans from east of the Mississippi River began to move into Caddoan territory in Spanish
Texas. These movements were in response to the increasing pressure to give up their traditional
livelihoods and become incorporated into Anglo-American culture (Everett 1990). The Spanish
initially welcomed these groups with the idea of using them to create a “buffer” between the
Spanish settlements in Texas and the land-hungry Anglo-Americans. Unfortunately, as more of
these groups (such as the Choctaw, Delaware, Quapaw, Shawnee, Cherokee, and AlabamaKoasati) moved into East Texas, they began increasingly to compete with the Caddo for a
diminishing resource base. This problem was exacerbated following the sale of Louisiana to the
United States in 1803, when Anglo-Americans began moving into Northeast Texas as well
(Perttula 1988:21), and was not ultimately resolved until both the Caddo and most of the
immigrant groups were expelled following the Texas Revolution of 1835.

EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
The period of European exploration and settlement and the subsequent Anglo-American and
African-American development of Northeast Texas are briefly covered in the remaining portions
of this chapter. For more extensive treatments of this period in Northeast Texas, see Peter and
Cliff (1990a:Chapters 3 and 7) and Peter et al. (1991:Appendix J).
The initial European penetration into the general area of Northeast Texas occurred in the middle
of the sixteenth century when the survivors of the de Soto entrada, led by Luís de Moscoso de
Alvarado, entered Texas in their attempt to reach New Spain by land (Bruseth and Kenmotsu
1991; Weddle 1985). Recent reconstructions of the Moscoso route through Texas (Bruseth and
Kenmotsu 1991) equate the province of Naguatex with the Hatchel-Mitchell-Moores site complex
in northern Bowie County, suggesting that from there the entrada moved southwest through
Bowie County to cross the Sulphur River somewhere in the vicinity of Douglassville, where
Wright Patman Lake now is located.
In 1719, the Frenchman Jean-Baptiste Bénard de la Harpe traveled up the Red and Sulphur rivers
from the French outpost at Natchitoches and founded a trading post among the Nasoni, probably
in the vicinity of the Eli Moores site in Bowie County (Gilmore 1986; Wedel 1978). The
Nassonite Post (as la Harpe’s trading post has come to be known) may have been vacant or
intermittently garrisoned after 1726, and then reestablished and relocated, probably at the
Roseborough Lake site, in about 1731–1733 by Alexis Grappe (Gilmore 1986). This later post
was garrisoned until sometime around 1778 when it was finally abandoned completely (Miroir et
al. 1975:162).
Following the sale of Louisiana to the United States in 1803, Anglo-American immigration into
Northeast Texas intensified, although for a number of years it was not clear who actually owned
the area south of the Red River. The United States considered it (and indeed, most of Texas) to
be part of Louisiana and encouraged settlement of the area (Chandler and Howe 1939). Spain, on
the other hand (and later Mexico), was violently opposed to this view, and at several times during
the first few decades of the nineteenth century, the dispute nearly led to war (Smith 1991). The
first official Anglo-American penetration of the region was by the Freeman-Custis Expedition of
1806, which was turned back at Spanish Bluffs, along the Red River, by a Spanish military force
(Flores 1984).
Despite Spain’s claim, Northeast Texas was too close to the United States not to fall into the
Anglo-American sphere of influence, and settlement continued. The earliest settlements were
confined to the areas immediately adjacent to the Red River, but after 1818, settlement pushed
into the prairies along river tributaries and early roads such as Trammel’s Trace and Dayton’s
Road. Trammel’s Trace, a popular immigrant route into Texas after 1813, crossed the Sulphur
River at Epperson’s Ferry and continued southwestward through Cass County to Hughes Springs,
founded in 1839, and then south to cross Cypress Creek two miles west of Jefferson (Webb and
Carroll 1952:2:793–794). Dayton’s Road was a major east-west overland route that ran along the
divide between the Sulphur and Red rivers.
The original Anglo-American settlers in Northeast Texas were apparently largely subsistence
farmers residing on small holdings, with an economy reportedly based on grain and livestock
production (Peter and Cliff 1990a:36). The commercial production of cotton apparently was not
introduced until the 1830s (Fehrenbach 1968), a shift that was accompanied by increasing
numbers of slaves in the region. In 1850, slaves made up over half of the population of Bowie
40

County, and Cass County (which then included Marion County) was not far behind (see
Campbell 1989:Map 6). In contrast, slaves made up only about 20 percent of the population of
Upshur County in 1850 (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:824). In 1860, slaves accounted for over half
the population of both Bowie and the now separate Marion County, and slaves in Cass and
Upshur counties were less than 50 percent (see Campbell 1989:Map 7; Webb and Carroll
1952:2:824). For the same years, the statewide percentages of slaves to the total population was
much smaller, 27 percent for 1850 and 23 percent in 1860 (Jordan 1986). The town of Jefferson,
on Cypress Creek, was a major cotton market, and the antebellum planters throughout the region
undoubtedly sent their cotton there for sale (Peter and Cliff 1990a:39). The first growth of
nonagricultural industries in Northeast Texas began during this period when T. J. Foster
constructed the first saw pit and lumber mill in Cass County in order to supply lumber for the
construction of the new county courthouse in Linden. The first lumber residence was built in the
county in 1855 (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:306). Other major industries established at about the
same time included tan yards and syrup mills; after 1857, railroad construction progressed
westward in Bowie County (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:198, 2:59).
After the presidential election of 1860, it was not surprising that the sympathies of most of the
Anglo-American residents of Northeast Texas lay with the secessionist southerners. After all, a
majority of them had immigrated from the South, the region as a whole had a substantial slave
population, and the cash economy of the area was built on slave-based agriculture. Bowie, Cass,
Marion, and Upshur counties all voted for secession in 1861, and in most of Northeast Texas antiUnion feelings ran high. For example, the state legislature changed the name of Cass County to
Davis County in 1861, to honor Jefferson Davis, but the name was changed back to Cass in 1871
(Webb and Carroll 1952:1:306).
Northeast Texas escaped serious, direct effects from the Civil War, being too far from the centers
of fighting to the east and south to be affected by Union forces, and too far east of the frontier to
be affected by the resurgence of Native American problems which accompanied the withdrawal
of United States and Texas military forces (Pool 1975:110–113). Indeed, as a result of its isolated
location, Northeast Texas became a refuge for slaves sent west by their owners to avoid their
confiscation as contraband by Federal forces, and by the end of the war they had become a source
of concern for some of the civilian authorities in the region (Campbell 1989:243–246).
Throughout the war, Texas supplied valuable industrial products to the Confederate armies
fighting in the east. The penitentiary at Huntsville was one of the most important industrial sites
in Texas, producing various cloth products for the Confederate Army, including both cotton and
woolen goods (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:352). By 1864, industrial centers in Northeast Texas
included Tyler, with a Confederate Quartermaster’s Clothing Bureau depot producing shoes and
equipage, and a Field Transportation Bureau shop specializing in the manufacture and repair of
military transportation equipment; Jefferson, with a shoe factory and Clothing Bureau depot; and
Marshall, with a Clothing Bureau steam foundry producing skillets and camp kettles (Webb and
Carroll 1952:1:352). Field Transportation Bureau shops in the region were also located in Rusk,
Mount Pleasant, and Paris. Marshall was also a center of powder and ammunition production,
and after the fall of Vicksburg in 1863, it became the seat of civil authority west of the
Mississippi River and housed the wartime capital of Missouri and the headquarters of the TransMississippi Postal Department (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:148).
The defeat of the South in 1865 brought with it the end of slavery in Texas and the breakdown of
the old slave-based plantation system, the presence of a Union army of occupation, and a Radical
Republican administration firmly in control of the state house. Despite this situation,
41

conservative Democrats were able to blunt many of the radical reforms of the Reconstruction
period (Moneyhon 1989). Then, in 1874, the Radical Republicans lost control of the state
government and the Reconstruction period in Texas officially ended (Webb and Carroll
1952:2:446–447).
The end of slavery brought many changes in the economy of rural East Texas. Lacking the cheap
and dependable labor resources provided by slavery, the large plantations of the prewar period
ceased to be economically feasible and many were broken up and partially sold off. Although
this process sometimes included the disposal of productive land, it often involved the sale of
unproductive or unimproved acreage in an attempt to obtain cash during the postwar recession.
Whereas previously, slaves had been the primary form of disposable property, being bought and
sold as much for investment purposes as for their labor (see, for example, Campbell 1989), after
the war, land came increasingly to play this role. As a result, despite the large number of newly
freed slaves, most of the land put on the market found its way into the hands of speculators and
investors, with the result that a new system of sharecropping or tenant farming replaced the old
plantation system. Absentee landlords now often held productive land, with the labor supplied by
poor African-American or Anglo-American sharecroppers or tenants. Although this system failed
to improve the lot of the sharecroppers and tenants, it was a successful replacement for the prewar
system, and by the beginning of the twentieth century, the bulk of the rural farms in Northeast
Texas were operated by sharecroppers or tenants.
After 1870, the population of Northeast Texas began to increase and the region began to recover
from the worst effects of the war and the subsequent recession. One of the most important factors
in this recovery was the increasing role of the railroad in the regional economy. A small amount
of railroad construction had occurred prior to the outbreak of the war, when more than 50 miles of
track had been laid westward from Texarkana in 1857 by the Memphis, El Paso, and Pacific
Railroad. Following the end of the war, construction did not resume for four more years. When
it finally did, it continued at a relatively steady rate. Twenty-three miles of railroad were in
operation in Bowie County in 1870. In 1871 and 1872, the Texas and Pacific Railroad went
through the southern corner of Upshur County and the eastern portion of Cass and Marion
counties. In 1876, the East Line and Red River Railroad (later part of the Louisiana and
Arkansas), building west from Jefferson, crossed western Marion County and the southwest
portion of Cass County. In 1895, the Cotton Belt Railroad crossed the northwest corner of Cass
County (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:306, 2:145–146, 238, 783, 824).
New towns sprang up along these railroad routes and developed as important shipping centers,
towns such as Kildare, Atlanta, and Lanark in the eastern portion of Cass County, and Avinger in
southwestern Cass County. The old community of Hughes Springs in Cass County became a
resort town as a result of the railroad’s arrival (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:306). The continuing
expansion of the railroads after 1870, and the improved communications they brought, spurred
the development of other local industries as well. During this period, lumbering assumed its
place as an important industry in many areas of Northeast Texas (Chandler 1937). In 1871, Big
Sandy in Upshur County became established as a profitable shipping point for pine (Webb and
Carroll 1952:2:824). Lumbering became one of the chief industries of Cass County prior to 1877
and reached its peak there in 1890 (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:306), and during the 1880s more
than 100 workers in Bowie County were employed in the lumber industry there. Sawmills to
process this lumber also sprang up throughout Northeast Texas and provided another major
source of employment. By 1882, 18 sawmills were operating in Upshur County and by 1890,
there were 20 (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:824). All of these mills helped supply raw material to
42

factories located in Texarkana and in other large towns (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:198). After
1877, the iron foundries established in Queen City became important in the economy of Cass
County (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:306). By 1890, two flour mills and 75 gins had opened in
Upshur County, and in that same year the sweet potato industry was introduced (Webb and
Carroll 1952:2:824).
In spite of the steady growth in nonagricultural industries during these years, farming continued
to be important in Northeast Texas, with the small, owner-operated farm still prominent. Despite
the inequities of the sharecropper and tenant systems, the participants were not locked into the
system as had been the case under slavery, and in the last three decades of the nineteenth century
increasing numbers of African-Americans achieved the status of small landowners. They often
settled in dispersed rural communities separate from those of their white neighbors.
Extensive iron deposits were discovered in Upshur County prior to the Civil War, and mined
sporadically thereafter. It was not until the second decade of the twentieth century, however, that
an effort was made to systematically exploit the deposits (Long 2003). In 1911, the Port Bolivar
& Iron Ore Railroad was formed; it laid about 30 miles (48 km) of track in and near Longview, as
part of a plan to ferry raw iron ore from Northeast Texas to smelters in Port Bolivar on the Texas
coast. This scheme resulted in the founding and development of Ore City, but in the end no ore
was ever transported. The PB&IO was acquired by the Santa Fe Railroad in 1914, only to be
abandoned in 1927. All that remains of the line today is a raised berm that passes from Ore City
into Longview. The Longview portion has been developed as Cargill Long Park (McWhorter and
McWhorter 2003).
Between about 1920 and 1935, the rural population seems to have generally declined, although
the population of the region as a whole continued to grow (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:198). Some
factors that may have influenced this demographic shift were the continued growth of urban
industries, the declining agricultural productivity of the land, and the depressed regional and
national economy. The discovery of oil in Cass, Marion, and Upshur counties in the 1930s led to
the development of new industries and increased employment, although the overall population of
the region continued to fall (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:306, 2:144, 783).
The period following the end of World War II has been one of general prosperity and
urbanization for the entire region. Demographic changes within this area have been dominated
by the growth of medium-sized urban areas such as Texarkana and Marshall. For example, the
population of Bowie County in 1970 was 67,813, with over half (35,000) residing in Texarkana.
Commercial patterns in the region have benefited from the construction of several major
interstate highways (I-20 and I-30) that have served to link the area to major manufacturing
centers to both the east and the west. The improved infrastructure, as well as the construction of
several lakes in the area, also has brought increased prosperity in the form of tourism and the
recreational dollar.
In spite of this growth, agriculture, livestock, and timber continue to play a major role in the
regional economy. Approximately 290,000 acres in Gregg, Harrison, and Upshur counties are
used today for hay or pasture for livestock, and an additional 120,000 acres are planted in crops
such as soybeans, cotton, wheat, and rice (Golden et al. 1994; Roberts 1983). Other
commercially exploited resources in the area include lignite, oil and gas, iron ore, sand, and
gravel. Water, especially from area reservoirs, is an increasingly important resource (Golden et
al. 1994; Roberts 1983).

CHAPTER 4
RESEARCH GOALS AND METHODS

INTRODUCTION
The cultural resources investigations recorded in this document were designed to identify both
prehistoric and historic archeological sites along with other important cultural resources located
within the newly revised section of the proposed Lake O’ The Pines Regional Water System
within the vicinity of Ore City in Harrison, Marion and Upshur counties, Texas. This work was
undertaken with two primary management goals in mind:
1. to locate cultural resources occurring within the designated survey areas
2. to assess the significance of those resources in regard to their potential for inclusion in the
NRHP and for SAL designation
The first of these goals was accomplished by a program of intensive pedestrian survey and shovel
testing undertaken using the field methods described in the second part of this chapter. This
intensive survey identified one previously unknown site (41UR323) was identified, the 2003-04
recommendation of site 41GG65 was amended, one 2003-04 identified site is recounted
(41UR292), five previously recorded sites (41MR4, 41MR161, 41MR262, 41UR7, and
41UR247) were revisited, and 15 nonsite localities were documented.
The assessments of significance and the recommended NRHP and SAL status for each of the
fifteen nonsite localities and seven investigated sites are presented in a preliminary fashion in the
following chapters on research results and are reiterated in the concluding summary chapter. The
remaining portions of the present chapter present the methodological background for the current
investigations, the general survey methods used in the field, and a discussion of the artifact
analysis.

INTENSIVE SURVEY METHODS
For the revised Lake O’ the Pines Regional Water System project, an intensive pedestrian survey
was undertaken in three areas in the vicinity of Lake O’ The Pines. These areas consisted of (1)
8.5 miles of newly proposed pipeline corridor; (2) a 0.5 acre x 0.5 acre tract located along
45

Wisteria Trail that will be used for a booster station; and (3) 3.2 mile consisting of nine reroutes
within the originally proposed pipeline corridor. Prior to beginning of fieldwork, the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas online electronic site records of the Texas Historical Commission were
consulted along with the submittal of a request for review by Ms. Jean Huges of the Texas
Historical Commission. These two efforts combined to identify all previously recorded cultural
resources sites in and near the survey areas. This search determined four previously recorded sites
(41MR4, 41MR161, 41MR262, and 41UR7) and one historic landmark (Walnut Creek Baptist
Church in Upshur County) were known to occur within or immediately adjacent to the revised
Lake O’ The Pines Southside Regional Water System survey areas. Forty-eight additional sites
(41MR31, 41MR43, 41MR112, 41MR113, 41MR122, 41MR123, 41MR128, 41MR129,
41MR130, 41MR131, 41MR132, 41MR133, 41MR138, 41MR143, 41MR144, 41MR145,
41MR163, 41MR164, 41MR165, 41MR166, 41MR167, 41MR168, 41MR169, 41MR170,
41MR171, 41MR172, 41MR173, 41MR179, 41MR184, 41MR201, 41MR202, 41MR203,
41MR204, 41MR205, 41MR206, 41MR207, 41MR262, 41MR265, 41MR266, 41UR100,
41UR101, 41UR143, 41UR245, 41UR246, 41UR247, 41UR292, 41UR293, 41UR296 and
41UR302) and one historic landmark site (Ore City’s Murray Institute) were located within 1
mile of the project areas (see Figures 1-7).
The examination of topographical maps, basic knowledge of Northeast Texas archeological site
distribution patterning, and the visual inspection of the landforms at the time of survey combined
with the observed soil profiles from the conducted shovel tests formed the basis for determining
the differential intensity of investigation per area. The areas of highest probability were mostly
situated near streams, stream crossings, flood plains, flood plain rises, relatively level areas
adjacent to stream confluences, and knolls next to streams. The designation of high probability
areas was further based on the observation that these areas exhibited the appropriate geologic
depositional contexts to contain archeological deposits with sufficient integrity to be eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP or that merit designation as SALs. Approximately 1.1 miles of the
pipeline corridor traversed areas classified as having a high probability to contain prehistoric
archeological sites (Figures 8-12).
The area defined as having medium probability for containing cultural materials mostly included
upland margins, valley walls and ridges. These medium probability areas, like the high
probability areas, exhibited the appropriate geologic depositional contexts to contain
archeological deposits with sufficient integrity to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, or that
merit designation as SALs. Approximately 10.36 miles of the pipeline corridor traversed medium
probability areas.
The remaining 0.84 miles of the proposed pipeline corridor was contained in what is referred to
as low probability areas. These low probability areas included but were not limited to upland
drainage divides distant from streams and those places that exhibited erosion, sediment deflation,
and extensive residential or commercial development. These areas typically had naturally
shallow, mixed, or eroded deposits and/or sediments significantly disturbed by modern landaltering activities. Thus, the designation of low-probability areas was based on the assumption
that they likely did not retain the appropriate geologic context to contain prehistoric archeological
properties with integrity and research potential to meet the NHPA or SAL eligibility criteria.

Across most of the project area, two teams of two-person crews conducted the pedestrian surveys.
Each crew systematically traversed the construction corridor by walking a single transect along
the centerline of the corridor or to the side of the proposed pipeline ROW that was outside a
previously impacted easement, excavating shovel tests in leapfrog fashion. The route was
marked on enlarged digitized project maps derived from 7.5′ USGS quadrangle maps, and the
individual shovel tests were plotted on those maps; later, the shovel test and site data were
transferred to the master set of digital project maps. All exposed surface areas such as road cuts,
animal burrows, and plowed fields also were closely inspected for cultural material.
In high probability areas where ground cover hindered site detection (i.e., where less than 5
percent of the ground surface was visible), intensive shovel testing was used to aid site detection.
Shovel tests were systematically excavated at approximately 10 m or 20 m intervals, depending
upon the topography of the area and the available visibility. Medium probability areas were
shovel-tested at approximately 30 m intervals. Low probability areas (i.e., upland areas away
from drainages) along the proposed corridor were shovel-tested judgmentally in areas where
previous experience suggested the possible occurrence of archeological materials or at 60 m
intervals. This strategy accounted for a total of 693 shovel tests over the course of the entire
project area. The number of shovel tests greatly exceeds Texas Historical Commission guidelines
that would theoretically require a minimum of 229 shovel tests for the 11.64 miles pipeline
alignment and the 0.5 x 0.5 acre booster site location.
In all cases, shovel tests measured approximately 30 cm in diameter and were excavated either to
the top of the Bt-horizon (subsoil) or to 80 cm below ground surface. The soil from each shovel
test was screened through 0.635-cm (0.25-in) hardware cloth. When a cultural artifact was
located in a shovel test, a series of no fewer than two additional shovel tests was excavated
nearby to determine whether the find represented a site or locality. In most cases, shovel tests
were excavated in a modified cruciform pattern involving at least four shovel tests (one in each of
the cardinal directions) in addition to any previous shovel tests. All shovel tests were spaced 10
m apart. In linear areas that had been previously disturbed, at least two additional shovel tests
were excavated, as much to determine the extent of the disturbance as to unearth subsurface
cultural materials. If no further cultural remains were located, the original artifact was recorded as
an isolated locality and the survey continued. If, on the other hand, additional material was
located in any of the additional shovel tests, the find was recorded as a site and a total of at least
seven shovel tests were excavated to fully delineate the site extent within the proposed
construction corridor. The actual extent of a cultural resources site beyond the limits of the
proposed ROW was not evaluated due to restrictions based on land access issues. The additional
shovel tests were also used to obtain estimates of the site depth and contents. All artifacts
recovered from shovel tests on both site and nonsite (isolated occurrence) areas were collected.
Wherever possible, limited surface collections of temporally and/or functionally diagnostic
artifacts were also made to expand the sample of materials useful in evaluating the cultural
affiliation, age, and other research-potential issues about the site.
Each recorded site was identified with a permanent datum marker consisting of a 5/8-inchdiameter metal rebar stake placed on the site. This marker was topped with an aluminum cap
bearing the site’s temporary GMI field number. A table correlating the temporary field site
numbers and the State of Texas assigned permanent trinomial site number is provided in
Appendix F. After the site datum was set, its location was recorded using a global positioning
system (GPS). Then a scaled pace-and-compass map was prepared for each site, in reference to
the site datum, and generalized contour intervals and vegetation boundaries were sketched onto
52

the field map. These methods provided a detailed plot of the size, configuration, and variations in
elevation across each site. The locations of all shovel tests were mapped, as were all outstanding
cultural and topographic features. Each site was photographed from several viewpoints, using a
five megapixel camera, and included images depicting any damage evident to the cultural
resources by vandalism, construction, or earth disturbances of any kind. These photographs were
recorded in a photo log. A State of Texas site recording form was prepared, noting locational
information, vegetation cover, contextual integrity, estimated period of occupation, and artifactual
material (both surface and subsurface) separately for each site. Finally, the location of the site
was plotted on the appropriate project maps.
Site designations were applied only to clusters of surface artifacts (i.e., greater than 10 artifacts),
clusters of subsurface artifacts (two or more positive shovel tests), or significant architectural
properties. As previously discussed, isolated finds or unique features were designated as
“localities.” Such localities were recorded in field notes and were plotted on topographic maps.
Locality data was later transferred to abbreviated forms that permitted the documentation of
specific locational information and field interpretations.
In addition to the pedestrian survey and shovel-testing program, a surface reconnaissance
documented several significant locations that had an excellent chance to contain moderate to deep
sedimentary deposits that could conceivably contain archeological remains. Since archeological
remains buried in these settings usually contain exceptional context for preserving activity areas
from one or more components, the original program was designed to involve the excavation of
deep backhoe trenches and geomorphological description of these settings. The trenches also
served as a means to access the deeper deposits to determine if buried archeological remains are
present. Accordingly, a pre-survey reconnaissance supplemented by observations made by the
field crew during the pedestrian survey identified several areas requiring geomorphic assessment
prior to construction disturbance. Original discussions with the client determined an intention to
bore under wetland areas, stream crossings, and important cultural resources sites as a means of
installing the water pipe. But, since design plans have changed due to the recent steep rise in
construction costs, the investigation of previously planned geomorphic work has been reinstated,
because the design is now calling for the open cutting of as many areas as possible. The target
locations of these alluvial settings and subsequent trenching are stipulated in Chapter 5; the
stratigraphic profiles are presented in Appendix A.
The Project Archeologist maintained field notes concerning sites and localities that documented
survey conditions, vegetation cover, and area covered daily, as well as initial interpretations of
the cultural properties. Additional documentation kept by the Project Archeologist included
artifact provenience catalogs and daily laboratory logs. All documents, artifacts, and other
materials related to this work will be permanently curated at the Texas Archaeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas, upon completion of the project.

ARTIFACT TREATMENT AND ANALYSIS METHODS
All cultural materials collected during the survey and site recording were returned to the GMI
laboratory facilities in Plano, Texas, where all artifacts were washed, catalogued, and labeled in
compliance with TARL standards. Following this, GMI personnel conducted the various types of
artifact analyses.

53

The artifact collection recovered from the archeological sites and nonsite localities investigated
during the present survey consists of eight prehistoric lithic artifacts/debris and 10 prehistoric
ceramic sherds, and 37 historic artifacts. Details of the observations collected on each class are
summarized below and discussed more fully in Appendices B through D.

Lithic Analysis
The major prehistoric artifact class used in the lithic analysis is lithic debitage. Variables
recorded for the lithic debitage included technological type of debitage, amount of dorsal cortex
(if present), heat-treatment or burning, material type, size range, and weight.
Of the eight lithic artifacts collected, eight are various pieces of flaking debris. No ground,
pecked, or battered stone tools were found. There were no bifacial fragments or projectile points
recovered during the survey. The lithic debitage consisting of nine specimens was classified by
technological reduction source (i.e., core flakes, biface flakes, flake fragments, and shatter; see
Appendix B).

Prehistoric Ceramic Analysis
The ceramic artifacts or pottery sherds were carefully washed in the laboratory. Sherds were
analyzed using a number of variables relating to vessel portion, paste, nonplastic temper type and
particle size, surface finishing, surface and core color, sherd thickness and weight, and typology
(see Appendix D). The analysis focused on the paste and temper identification. Surface finish
related to the decorative treatment, and the color of both interior, exterior, and core colors used
the Munsell (1990) terminology. Sherd thickness was measured in millimeters. A single rim
sherd was recovered, but was not large enough to allow for the estimate of rim diameter or vessel
form. Finally, attempts were made to crossmend contiguous sherds, especially when the pieces
were recovered from the same shovel test and in three instances this was successful.
The survey recovered only 10 prehistoric potsherds. They consist of four plain grog-tempered
sherds, four brushed grog-tempered sherds, one sherd with a plain red slip, and a brushed rim
sherd. Eight were nondiagnostic body sherds, one was a nondiagnostic body sherd from a
hematite slipped vessel, while the final sherd was a rim sherd (see Appendix C).

Historic Artifact Analysis
Thirty-seven historic artifacts were collected during the course of the current project. These
artifacts were examined by laboratory staff for particular attributes and diagnostic traits, using
morphological and/or functional classification systems developed by South (1977). Four primary
categories were used for the assignment of recovered artifacts—Activities, Architectural,
Domestic, and Personal (see Appendix D). The Activities category includes any nonhousehold
items, transportation items, farm-related equipment, tools, and firearms; three artifacts from the
project were assigned to this category. The Architectural category includes all items related to
buildings such as brick, mortar, plaster, nails, window glass, and electrical items; five
Architectural artifacts are among the historic assemblage. The Domestic category designation
was used for items related to food service (tableware) and food storage (including food
54

preparation and tin cans); Furnishings, a subcategory of Domestics, encompass household items
such as furniture, stove parts, and lamp glass. Domestic artifacts, totaling 10, dominated the
assemblage. The Personal category contains generally contains items of individual use such as
clothing, buttons, shoes, dolls, and smoking pipes; but in this case it was decided the 19
fragments from one pint clear liquor bottle.

ARTIFACT ANALYSIS DATA BASE
Various observations for each artifact classification mentioned above were recorded and entered
into an ACCESS data base format on an IBM network system. In addition, computer printouts of
all data were compiled and archived with the permanent project files (see Appendix E). The
results of the analyses of this collection are presented along with the descriptions for each site in
the following chapters, and the raw data are presented in Appendices B though D at the end of the
report.

CHAPTER 5
GEOARCHEOLOGICAL STUDIES

The initial proposal and TAC permit application for this project stipulated that the survey would
entail some backhoe trenching, in order to a) investigate the potential for buried archeological
deposits, and b) to generate geomorphological profile descriptions to better understand the
context of the sediments that might be adversely affected by proposed construction activities.
Accordingly, the Principal Investigator and Project Archeologist conducted a topographic map
assessment and pre-survey reconnaissance of the proposed route, in part to locate suitable areas
for backhoe trench placement. The Project Archeologist and crew conducted further inspection
of the entire route during the pedestrian survey and shovel-testing program. Based on these
investigations, four areas with Holocene sediments appeared to have geomorphic and
geoarcheological potential for containing buried archeological sites (Table 2).

Recent discussions with the client about the revised water treatment system identified a shift in
their construction methodology. Rather than wanting to exercise the option of boring under
wetland areas, stream crossings, and important cultural resource sites as a means of installing the
water pipe; they would rather utilize open cut trenches whenever possible as a cost saving
mechanism. Thus, in an attempt to assist the client in achieving maximum cost savings during
construction, GMI conducted geoarcheological studies at all four locations (see Figures 2-4).

57

It should be noted, construction plans call for the open cut trench to not exceed 2 m (6 ft) in
depth. Regardless of these construction specifications, in all cases attempts were made to
excavate the geoarchaeological trenches to between 2.5-3 m (8-10 ft) below the modern surface,
but this was not always possible due to water saturation, soil textures, friability of the sediments
and the presence of bedrock. The area continues to experience drought like conditions, as it has
for over a year, thus the trenching activities were unhindered by the presence of standing water
allowing for a good picture of the local stratigraphy to be obtained from the units excavated
(Appendix A).
All trenches measured 70-80 cm (~24 in) wide, and averaged 4-5.5 m (13-17.5 ft) long. A five
megapixel digital camera was used to take pictures of each trench profile, after the trench wall
had been profiled using a short handle shovel and trowel. Then, based on first hand observations
a stratigraphic profile map was compiled for each trench in the field, and Global Positioning
System (GPS) readings were collected at both ends of the long axis of each trench. These GPS
readings were taken to assist in the process of mapping the trenches onto the master digital survey
maps. These investigations will be discussed in turn throughout the remainder of the chapter
based upon the area of investigation.

AREA G
The selected geomorphic study area impacts a small-sized, barely incised, intermittent branch of
Meddlin Creek (Figure 13). Access to the project area is via a two-track road that winds
northward through the Coleman property. The surrounding area is characterized by larger
hardwood species with a fairly sparse under story, indicating timbering activities have occurred
less frequently on this property than some of the neighboring sections. At this location, the
proposed pipeline follows the unimproved two-track road and crosses what appears to be a
combination of alluvial and colluvial Holocene deposits near its entry into the Lake O’ The Pines
from the southern shore. The area is composed of a relatively flat landform and there are three
small ridges surrounding the area stretching from the northwest corner and wrapping around
southward to the eastern edge. Each of these small ridges is split by a small intermittent stream.
The present two-track road undoubtedly channels heavy rains when they occur, because it is
riddled with small to medium-sized erosional gullies (Figure 14). The direction of flow in this
location is to the northeast, whereupon the intermittent waters enter the Lake O’ The Pines.
Two trenches were excavated within this location, largely because during initial shovel testing the
subsoil or Bt Horizon exceeded 80 cm in depth beginning at the edge of the Lake O’ The Pines
and extending southward along the proposed pipeline for roughly 100 m (300 ft).

General Comments of Area G
The stratigraphy in this area proved to be a combination of alluvial and colluvial processes. The
deposits are the product of sedimentation resulting after heavy rains have suspended materials
from the surrounding hills and carried them down. These sediments may be no older than the age
of the Lake O’ The Pines Reservoir itself, roughly 50 years. The deposits are very sandy with the
clasts of ironstone increasing in size from pea to fist size with increasing depth until hard clay and
ironstone layer (Cr horizon) is encountered.

There were two observations immediately noticeable about the observed sediments in these two
trenches: 1) the general lack of A-horizons and 2) the predominance of similarly colored sands
throughout the study area (Figure 15). The trench more distant from the reservoir shoreline had a
more developed soil profile, while the trench closer to the shoreline was less developed. It seems
likely that the lack of a discernable A-horizon is due to the fact that the deposits are very young
and sediment aggradation is continuing to take place, retarding soil formation. Thus, the
sequences observed in these trenches can be summarized as a series of aggrading ironstone sands
or redeposited Cuthbert soils (Roberts 1983).
Aside from the occasional root or rootlet, no inclusions were observed within the profile
sediments, except for gravels ranging from pea size to fist size depending on the relative depth of
the deposit being investigated. These clasts were most likely eroded from the bedrock and
washed down from the higher surrounding areas during high energetic flooding episodes. The
lack of inclusions such as manganese oxide and calcium carbonate nodules, which are common in
mature profiles (particularly in the B-horizons), indicates once again the relatively young age of
the strata observed.
No cultural materials (flakes, burned rocks, or tools) or ecofacts (bone or shell) were observed
during the trenching process, a situation that is unsurprising considering the environment.

Trench Area-G#1
Trench Area-G#1 was excavated at a location that was estimated to be far enough away from the
localized water table of the Lake O’ The Pines Reservoir to allow for the depth to reach 2.5-3 m
(8-10 ft) if necessary. The trench excavations never reached the full depth, because a very hard
layer of ironstone and clay was encountered at roughly 1.5 m (5 ft) deep. The trench indicated a
less complex stratigraphic profile than the second trench in this area.
The surface stratum at this location consists of a friable, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) sand roughly 80
cm thick, with a weak, fine granular structure. Very little obvious soil development was noted for
this stratum, suggesting that it is very young. This stratum is considered to comprise an AC
horizon.
The underlying unit consists of a coarser, friable, yellowish red (5YR 5/6 – 4/6) sand 40 cm thick,
with a weak, medium granular structure. The contact between this stratum and the overlying one
is gradual. The deposit is related to the overlying AC horizon and is considered to comprise a C
horizon.
The lowest unit, underlying the C horizon, appears to directly overlie the red Cretaceous
ironstone (e.g., iron ore) common to the region. This very hard, very firm deposit, is interpreted
as a 2C horizon and may well consist of the remains of a partially-weathered Cr-horizon. The
contact between it and the overlying stratum above is clear, as this horizon is mostly composed of
ironstone gravels ranging in size from pea to fist size that are interspersed with lighter reddish
gray clays (5YR 5/2), and reddish yellow (5YR6/6) to yellowish red (5YR 5/6) sands. This
stratum occupies the lowest 10 cm of the profile.
Overall, the strata observed in Trench Area-G#1 suggest the following scenario. At some time in
the past, an energetic flooding event removed the existing sediments down to the ironstone
bedrock. Some of the clayey sediment overlying that bedrock, possibly consisting of weathered
ironstone, was incorporated into the new stratum deposited over the bedrock (2C). Later, a
medium yellowish red sand was deposited (C). Afterward, this deposit was buried and sealed by
the deposition of the current surface horizon (AC), possibly a continuing series of erosional
events that continue to aggregate the area with sands.

Trench Area-G#2
The second trench in this location was placed 30 m southeast of the first, which is actually
upslope in this case from the first. The stratigraphic profile of this trench was more complex than
the first, and indicated there was greater soil development occurring in this location.
The surface horizon at this location consists of a dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) sandy loam about
24 cm thick, with a weak, fine granular structure. There are a number of small to medium roots
present. The stratum is considered to be an AC horizon. The contact between this and the
underlying horizon is clear. There is nothing from Area-G#1 that correlates well with this
horizon.

62

The underlying horizon consists of a yellowish red (5YR 4/6) sand, about 56 cm thick, with a
weak, fine granular structure. There are fewer smaller roots present in this horizon than the
overlying one. The contact between this and the underlying horizon is clear. The lower 20 cm of
this horizon contains a dramatically increased percentage of pea size or smaller gravels. This
horizon correlates well with the C horizon from the Area-G#1 trench and is being interpreted as a
C horizon. The contact between this and the underlying horizon is clear.
The underlying 2C horizon consists of high concentrations of gravels ranging from pea to fist size
in a matrix of yellowish red (5YR 5/6) sand about 25 cm thick, with a weak, medium granular
structure. This horizon correlates well with the 2C from the Area-G#1 trench. The contact
between this and the underlying horizon is clear.
The final horizon in this trench consists of red clay (2.5YR 5/8) that was extremely dry and hard
at the time the trench was excavated. There were large cobble-sized pieces of ironstone resting
directly on top of this clay. The profile of the trench indicates that this horizon dives to the
northeast as it gets closer to the lake. This horizon fails to correlate directly to anything observed
in Area-G#1, but is most likely the same horizon underlying what was referred to as the 3C
horizon from the Area-G#1 trench or a Cr horizon.
Overall, the strata observed in the Area-G#2 trench suggest the following scenario reminiscent of
that observed in the Area-G#1 trench. At some time in the past, an energetic flooding event
removed the existing sediments down to the ironstone bedrock. Some of the clayey sediment
overlying that bedrock, possibly consisting of weathered ironstone, was incorporated into the new
stratum deposited over the bedrock (Cr). Later, a medium yellowish red sand was deposited (2C).
Afterward, this deposit was buried and sealed by the deposition of sands with smaller sized
gravels, the horizon directly below the current surface (C). Then, as a result of this area probably
being less inundated over the course of the existence of the reservoir, a greater degree of soil
development has occurred creating the surficial horizon (AC).

AREA N
The selected geomorphic study area impacts the Walnut Creek drainage, which is a small-sized
creek with an established and mature floodplain (Figure 16). Access to the project area is via a
gate on the northern boundary of the Foster property with FM 3245, and then along the former
road bed of Hawkins Road, which has ceased to be maintained except for a small portion that is
currently used for a driveway. The surrounding area is characterized by fairly flat open grazing
land that appears to be well drained through a series of channeled ditches and heavily eroded
intermittent stream beds. The proposed pipeline in this section is scheduled to follow a northeast
to southwest running fence line within the Foster property. The majority of the proposed pipeline
corridor will run between the pre-existing road bed and the fence, but since the road bed is no
longer visible the fence serves as the guiding landmark on the ground. The area appears to be a
drained wetland.
Six trenches were excavated within this location because the majority of the initial shovel tests
throughout the Walnut Creek flood plain failed to reach subsoil or the Bt horizon at 80 cm. There
were three trenches placed on the lower portion of the flood plain defined by the area south of an
intermittent stream bed, with the other three trenches placed on the upper portion.

General Comments of Area N
The stratigraphy in the Walnut Creek drainage proved to be a combination of fluvial deposits
observed closer to Walnut Creek and profiles of the Iuka fine sandy loam, frequently flooded
soils further northward along the flood plain (Figure 17). The deposits overall were very sandy,
with massive clay loams, silt loams, and pure sands predominating. The backhoe trench closest
to Walnut Creek appears to have been laid down as a sequence of point bar, levee, and
subsequent erosional cut-and-fill sequences by a meandering stream that has occasionally
switched its channel. Three things immediately noticeable about the observed sediments are 1)
the general lack of well developed A-horizons; 2) the predominance of sand throughout the study
area, and 3) the general scarcity of coarse clastic materials, beyond very small iron ore pebbles.
In all cases, the surface deposits consisted of very friable, very loose sandy deposits without
appreciable surface soil development, although vegetation was moderately dense across the
pipeline corridor. It seems likely that the lack of a discernable A-horizon is due either to
deliberate human removal of the topsoil, the fact that the deposits are very young and sediment
aggradation is continuing to take place retarding soil formation, or more likely that the soils are
predominantly wet with the water table less than a few feet from the surface the majority of the
time that likewise retards soil development. This is not to say that some pedological
differentiation has not occurred. While the surface strata in most of the profiles were classified as
weak A horizons or AC horizons—basically, parent horizons that show little soil development—
minor differences in color and texture are notable in the uppermost strata of a few profiles,
enough to clarify them as A-BC-C or AC-BC sequences. Underlying strata invariably consist of
undifferentiated C horizons, generally stacked one atop the other, as represented through a series
of cut-and-fill channel sequences (as in the trench closest to Walnut Creek) or as a result of
natural formation of the Iuka series of soils. Buried soils were not observed during the trenching
of the Walnut Creek flood plain. (Figure 18).
Aside from the occasional root or rootlet, no inclusions were observed within the profile
sediments, with the exception of a few small fragments of iron ore. The trenches placed in this
location never reached bedrock. The few clasts observed were most likely eroded from the
uplands during energetic flooding episodes and incorporated into the matrix. The lack of
inclusions such as manganese oxide and calcium carbonate nodules, which are common in mature
profiles (particularly in the B horizons), indicates once again the relatively young age of the strata
observed. The mottled nature of some of the sediments suggests repeated exposure to wet
environments, indicating that those sediments are often saturated with water. Some minor
gleying and reduction may be occurring, especially at the lowest levels. Other mottled strata
appear to be simply a mix of different colored materials, partially derived from underlying
sediments that were stripped away by fluvial action and incorporated into the new strata. Zones
containing such mixed materials are not likely to retain much integrity.
No cultural materials (flakes, burned rocks, or tools) or ecofacts (bone or shell) were observed
during the trenching process. Interestingly, however, two distinct stratigraphic regimes were
observed. The first was apparent in the initial trench placed closest to the active Walnut Creek,
while the other reflected the natural profile of the Mantachie series of soils.

Table 4
Soil Horizon Designations Used in Area N
(after Vogel 2002)
Horizon

Definition

A

Addition of organic material, often removal of clay and weatherable minerals, or
plowing of other human induced disturbance (Ap). Formed at the surface or below O
horizon. Often but not always dark brown or gray, often granular or subangular blocky
in structure, lots of roots and/or bipores, sings of animal and insect burrowing. NO
sedimentary structure.

C

Subsurface mineral horizon, parent material for overlying horizons. Unconsolidated or
weakly consolidated, unmodified or very slightly modified by weathering process.
Any color, little or no soil structure (may be sediment structure left from deposition),
few or no roots and biopores, few or no signs of animal or insect burrowing.

Note: only those designations used in the profiles for Area N are defined here.

Trench Area N#1
The first trench was placed a few hundred yards north of the active Walnut Creek channel, and
lies near the lowest point of the study area in this section. The trench presents a complex
stratigraphy to a depth of 2 m (6 ft) below surface, at which point it was deemed excavations
could continue no further without fear of massive wall collapse due to the extremely dry and
unstable sands present. The uppermost layer (40 cm) is a friable, massive dark yellowish brown
(10YR 4/4) sandy loam. It is interpreted as a poorly-developed but recognizable A horizon.
The underlying horizon consists of a massive, light gray to very pale brown (10YR 7/2, 7/4) sand
that is friable, with a fine granular structure. This unit is 50 cm thick, and is interpreted as a C
horizon. The contact between it and the overlying horizon is gradual.
The underlying horizon consists of a brownish yellowish (10YR 6/6) sand that is being
interpreted as a 2C horizon from which the overlying horizon is partly derived. The horizon
ranges in thickness, for it gets thicker closer to the creek. It is roughly 34 cm thick. The contact
between this and the overlying horizon is abrupt, most likely representing an unconformity.
The underlying horizon observed in this trench is designated as a 3C horizon. It is mostly
composed of brownish yellow sands (10YR 6/6) and has mottles and streaks of gray (10YR 6/1)
sandy clay that increase in abundance and size with increasing depth. The stratum is 54 cm thick,
and it appears this horizon is incorporating materials from the lowest observed horizon in the
trench. The contact between this and the overlying horizon is clear. It is most likely this stratum is
similar to one of the B horizons reported for the Mantachie series of soils.

67

The final horizon is designated as a 4C horizon and is entirely composed of gray (10YR 6/1)
sandy clay. The horizon was extremely dry and very hard. The excavation of the trench ceased
shortly after encountering this horizon because it was feared the vibrations from the excavation
bucket would cause the trench walls to collapse. The contact between this horizon and the one
overlying it is clear.
Overall, the strata observed in Trench Area-N#1 suggest the following scenario: at some time in
the past, energetic flooding events removed the existing sediments down to the hard clay layers or
even bedrock. Eventually, when the channel moved or flooding ceased some of the clayey
sediments began to become incorporated into the new stratum (3C) deposited over the clay (4C).
It is difficult to tell with certainty, but the mixture of sands and clay could also be the
accumulation of sands into the cracks of clay after significant rainfall events followed periods of
drought. Regardless, eventually a lighter more fine-grained sand began to be deposited (2C),
most likely as a result of the Walnut Creek channel continuing to carve its channel to the west.
The continual lessoning of the energy regime in the waters responsible for the more recent
alluvial deposits has allowed for the development of a poorly developed A horizon.

Trench Area-N#2
Trench Area-N#2 lies 100 m to the north/northeast of trench Area-N#1. The sands observed in
this trench are much darker in color. The uppermost stratum is identical to the uppermost horizon
observed in trench Area-N#1, which is a friable, massive dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) sandy
loam 22 cm thick. It is interpreted as a poorly-developed but recognizable A horizon.
The underlying horizon is a thinner deposit of yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sands, with a fine
granular structure that is 20 cm thick. There is no comparable stratum in trench Area-N#1. It is
being interpreted as a C Horizon, because it matches the description of the C1 horizon as reported
for the Iuka series of soils (Roberts 1983). The contact between this and the overlying stratum is
clear.
The underlying horizon consists of a massive, light gray to very pale brown (10YR 7/3) sand, that
is friable, with a fine granular structure. This unit is 60 cm thick and is interpreted as a 2C
horizon, which correlates well with the C2 horizon reported for the Iuka series of soils (Roberts
1983) and it also correlates well with the 2C horizon observed in Trench Area-N#1. The contact
between it and the overlying horizon is clear.
The final horizon is designated as another 3C horizon, as it matches fairly closely to the C3
horizon as reported for the Iuka series of soils (Roberts 1983), and is 30 cm thick. It is mostly
composed of brownish yellow sands (10YR 6/6), has mottles and streaks of reddish yellow
(7.5YR 6/8) sands, and has mottles and streaks of gray (10YR 6/1) sandy clay and that increase in
abundance and size with increasing depth. The contact between this and the overlying horizon is
clear. This stratum correlates well with the 3C horizon observed in trench Area-N#1.
Overall, the strata observed in Trench Area-N#2 reflect the natural profile of what is reported for
the Iuka series of soils. The Munsell color assignments of the strata maybe somewhat askew
from the colors reported, but it should be noted the area is experiencing a drought making all of
the sediments drier than they normally area, which also tends to also make them lighter in color.

68

Trench Area-N#3
Trench Area N-#3 lies 85 m to the north/northeast of trench Area-N#2. It is more or less a mirror
image of the stratigraphic profile observed in trench Area-N#2. The uppermost horizon observed
in this trench correlates well with the weak A horizons observed in trenches Area-N#1 and AreaN#2. This stratum is a friable, massive brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam 40 cm thick. It is
interpreted as a poorly-developed but recognizable A horizon.
The underlying stratum is a brown (10YR 4/3) sand with mottles and streaks of yellowish red
(5YR 4/6), with a fine to medium granular structure and is 18 cm thick. The stratum is being
interpreted as a C horizon and correlates well with the C horizon observed in trench Area-N#2,
which does not have a correlate in trench Area-N#1. The contact between it and the stratum
above is clear.
The underlying horizon consists of a massive, light gray to very pale brown (10YR 7/3) sand, that
is friable, with a fine granular structure with some mottles of brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) sands.
This unit is 58 cm thick and is interpreted as a 2C horizon, which correlates well with the 2C
horizon in Trench Area-N#1. The contact between it and the overlying horizon is clear.
The underlying stratum is being interpreted as a 3C horizon and it correlates well with the 3C
horizons associated with trench Area-N#2. It is composed of reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) sands,
with mottles and streaks of very pale brown (10YR 7/3) clays that increase in size with increasing
depth. The stratum is 37 cm thick, and the contact between this horizon and the overlying one is
clear.
The final horizon observed in this trench a brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) sand mixed with mottles
and streaks of gray (10YR 6/1) clay is being interpreted as a 4C horizon. The stratum continues
for the last 14 cm of the stratigraphic profile, and correlates well with the 3C horizon observed in
the trench Area-N#1. The contact between this horizon and the overlying one is clear.
Overall, the strata observed in Trench Area-N#3 are reminiscent of the natural profile reported for
the Iuka soil series. The Munsell color assignments of the strata maybe somewhat askew from
the colors reported, but it should be noted the area is experiencing a drought making all of the
sediments drier than they normally are, which also tends to also make them appear lighter in
color.

Trench Area-N#4
Trench Area-N#4 situated 100 m north of the intersection of an unnamed intermitted stream, the
proposed pipeline, and the flood plain of Walnut Creek (see Figure 16). The area is relatively flat
and slowly rises as the proposed pipeline moves north/northeast. This trench is slightly south of
the 250 ft. interval indicated on the USGS topographic map. The depositional sequence is
somewhat different from that observed in the three southern trenches.
The first stratum (14 cm thick) is a mix of brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) sandy loam and light
brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sandy loam, with fine granular structure and is considered to be a
potentially weak A horizon. The mixed nature of the stratum is likely due to the disturbance of
the underlying stratum by cattle grazing.
69

The underlying stratum is a laminated series of yellowish brown (10YR 6/6 – 6/8) and light
brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sands, with fine granular structure. The horizon is being interpreted as
a C horizon. The deeper portions of this horizon have greater concentrations of small charcoal
flecking within the matrix. The stratum is 60 cm thick and may correlate with the horizon
composed of the massive, light to very pale brown (10YR 7/3) sands observed in the southern
trenches. The contact between this and the overlying stratum is abrupt.
The underlying stratum is a series of laminated very pale brown (10YR 8/3), yellow (10YR 7/88/6) and brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) sands, with fine granular structures. The more southern
portion of the profile indicates the stratum rises to the south, but this may also be a byproduct of
the large root disturbance in the center of the profile. The stratum is 24 cm thick and the contact
between it and the overlying stratum is clear. It is being interpreted as a 2C horizon.
The underlying stratum is gray (10YR 6/1) clay with strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) mottles and
streaks running through it. The more southern portion of the stratigraphic profile indicates the
stratum rises to the south, but this may also be a byproduct of the larger root disturbance in the
center of the profile. The stratum is 20 cm thick and the contact between it and the overlying
stratum is clear. It is being interpreted as a 3C horizon.
The final stratum is mostly white (10YR 8/1) and very pale brown (10YR8/3) sands mixed with
brownish yellow (10YR6/6) sandy clay. This stratum only occurs in the southernmost portion of
the profile and is roughly 20 cm thick. The contact between it and the overlying stratum is clear.
It is being interpreted as a 4C horizon.
Overall, the strata observed in Trench Area-N#3 are reminiscent of the natural profile reported for
the Iuka soil series. The Munsell color assignments of the strata maybe somewhat askew from
the colors reported, but it should be noted the area is experiencing a drought making all of the
sediments drier than they normally area, which also tends to also make them lighter in color. The
uppermost horizon is more likely a byproduct of bioturbation from cattle rather than a natural
depositional unit.

Trench Area-N#5
This trench lies 80m north/northeast of trench Area-N#5. It is placed further upslope from the
intermittent unnamed stream that connects with Walnut Creek. This trench is just north of the
250 ft interval as marked on the USGS topographic map. The uppermost stratum is a mixture of
brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) and light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sandy loam with a fine granular
structure and is 20 cm thick. It is being interpreted as a weak A horizon, even though it maybe
the byproduct of cattle trampling. It is similar in appearance and thickness to the uppermost
stratum observed in trench Area-N#4.
The underlying stratum is a brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) sand, with a fine granular structure and
is 30 cm thick. It is being interpreted as a C horizon, and does not correlate well with any of the
strata observed in the trench Area-N#4. The contact between this and the overlying stratum is
clear.

70

The underlying stratum is a brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) sand with mottles and streaks of gray
(10YR 6/1) clay. It is being interpreted as a 2C horizon, and correlates well with horizon 3C of
trench Area-N#4. The stratum is 34 cm thick and contains the major root systems of nearby pine
trees. The contact between this and the overlying stratum is clear.
The final stratum is brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) with mottles and streaks of reddish yellow
(7.5YR 6/8) clay. It is being interpreted as a 3C horizon, but does not correlate well with any
strata observed in trench Area-N#4. The stratum is 54 cm thick and the contact between this and
the overlying stratum is abrupt.
Overall, the strata observed in Trench Area-N#3 are reminiscent of the natural profile reported for
the Iuka soil series. The Munsell color assignments of the strata maybe somewhat askew from
the colors reported, but it should be noted the area is experiencing a drought making all of the
sediments drier than they normally area, which also tends to also make them appear lighter in
color. The uppermost horizon is more likely a byproduct of bioturbation from cattle rather than a
natural depositional unit.

Trench Area-N#6
This trench lies 100 m north/northeast of trench Area-N#5. It is further yet upslope from the
intermittent unnamed stream that connects with Walnut Creek.
The uppermost stratum is composed of a mixed brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) and light brownish
gray (10YR 6/2), with fine granular structure. The horizon is 10 cm thick and is being interpreted
as a weak A horizon, even though it maybe the byproduct of cattle trampling. It is similar in
appearance and thickness to the uppermost stratum observed in trench Area-N#4.
There is a thin lens of very pale brown (10YR7/4) colored clay directly underneath part of this
stratum that is only 2 cm thick. It is unknown what true nature and/or affiliation this micro-lens
has at present, but it is being interpreted as a C horizon because it is a distinctly separate stratum.
This stratum has abrupt boundaries with the stratum above and the stratum below.
The underlying stratum is composed of brownish yellow (10YR 6/6-6/8) sand with mottles and
streaks of gray (10YR 6/1) sands and is 42 cm thick. It is being interpreted as a 2C horizon and
correlates with the 2C horizon observed in trench Area-N#5. The contact between it and the
overlying stratum is abrupt.
The underlying stratum is composed of very pale brown (10YR 8/3) and brownish yellow (10YR
6/6-6/8) sands, with fine granular structure and is 40 cm thick. It is being interpreted as a 3C
horizon and may correlate to the 2C horizon observed in trench Area-N#5. The boundary
between this and the overlying stratum is gradual. The contact between it and the overlying
stratum is gradual.
The underlying stratum is composed of very pale brown (10YR 8/3) and brownish yellow (10YR
6/8) sands, with fine granular structure. The horizon is being interpreted as a 4C horizon and
does not appear to correlate well with any of the previously observed stratigraphic units. The
horizon is 30 cm thick.

71

The final stratum in this trench is a yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) sand with mottles and streaks of
gray (10YR 6/1) clay. The horizon is being interpreted as a 5C horizon and does not appear to
correlate well with anything in any of the previous trenches. The boundary between this and the
overlying stratum is gradual.
Overall, the strata observed in Trench Area-N#3 are reminiscent of the natural profile reported for
the Iuka soil series. The Munsell color assignments of the strata maybe somewhat askew from
the colors reported, but it should be noted the area is experiencing a drought making all of the
sediments drier than they normally area, which also tends to also make them appear lighter in
color.

AREA P
This area was the designation assigned to the Little Cypress Creek Bottoms. It was an area that
was supposed to have been originally trenched during the 2003-04 GMI survey, but weather
constraints and an alternative construction plan of boring under the flood plain negated the need
to investigate this area. Recent revisions to the construction plans associated with the placement
of the pipeline for the revised Lake O’ The Pines Water Treatment System has caused GMI to
return to this flood plain to fully assess the flood plain for potentially buried archeological
deposits.
The area in question stretches from the location where Glade Creek crosses the proposed pipeline
north/northeast to just south of the previously documented site 41UR293. The northernmost
portion of the area was not surveyed because there is a mature forest located on the northern half
of this area, making it nearly impossible to place trenches in the area without clearing a sizable
portion of Dr. John DiPasquale’s private property. Rather a strategy of trenching the areas of
highest elevation was employed as a means of assessing the stratigraphic integrity of a flood plain
that is widely known to be under a couple of feet of water for a portion of most years of normal
precipitation amounts (Figure 19).

General Comments
The observations made in the trenches placed throughout the flood plain of the Little Cypress
Creek indicated a complex depositional environment including evidence for various fluvial
processes such as channel cutting and filling, and profiles or segments of profiles representing
truncated naturally occurring soils of the Mantachie series, frequently flooded and/or the LatchMollville complex, 0 to 1 percent slopes (Roberts 1983) with recently redeposited materials
overlying them (Figure 20). The section of the Little Cypress Creek investigated during this
project failed to produce evidence of buried soils that would potentially contain in situ cultural
materials.

Profile Correlations
The stratigraphic profile designations used in the discussion of this area summarized in Table 5.
Detailed discussions of the strata observed in each trench are provided in this chapter and are
summarized in Appendix A.

Note: only those designations used in the profiles for Area P are defined here.

74

Trench Area-P#1
The stratigraphic profile observed in this trench matches well with the natural profile described
for the Mantachie series of soils is predominate over this portion of the Little Cypress Creek
Bottoms. There are some minor soil discrepancies between the observations made in the field
and those given as the official description of the soils, but these minor differences can be
attributed to the fact the soils observed in the field were extremely dry.
The uppermost stratum is composed of a dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) sandy loam. The
stratum correlates well with the A horizon reported for the Mantachie series of soils and this
stratum is interpreted as a weakly developed A horizon (Roberts 1983). It has a weak fine
subangular blocky structure. It is roughly 30 cm thick.
The underlying stratum is composed of a dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) sandy loam with gray
(10YR 5/1) sand mottles. The stratum is being interpreted as a weak A horizon. It has a weak
fine subangular blocky structure that is a mixture of the strata above and below it. It is 30 cm
thick and dips slightly to the north. The contact between it and the overlying stratum is diffuse.
The underlying stratum is a laminated series of yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) and gray (10YR 6/1)
sandy clay loams. The stratum is being interpreted as a C horizon and roughly correlates to the
B22g horizon as indicated for the Mantachie soils series (Robert 1983), but is less firm and more
sandy. It is most likely this stratum as been impacted surficial by sheet erosion from flood waters
of Glade Creek. The horizon dips slightly to the north and has a fairly wavy abrupt wavy contact
with the stratum underlying, potentially representing an unconformity. It is roughly 46 cm thick
and shares a gradual contact with the overlying stratum.
The underlying stratum is composed of yellow (10YR 7/6), brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) sandy
clays with mottles of yellowish red (5YR 5/8) sands. The stratum correlates well with the B22g
horizon reported for the Mantachie soils series (Robert 1983); therefore, it is being interpreted as
a B horizon. The stratum is thickest to closest to the Glade Creek or the south, and thins as it
continues north. The stratum is roughly 34 cm thick. The contact between it and the overlying
stratum is abrupt.
The underlying stratum is composed of light gray (10YR 7/1), reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) and
yellowish red (5YR 5/8) sands. The stratum correlates well with the B23g and the B24g horizon
reported for the Mantachie soils series (Robert 1983); therefore, it is being interpreted as an
underlying 2B horizon. It is most likely the distinction between these two horizons was not fully
recognized during the profiling of the trench. The stratum is relatively flat lying and dominates
the lower 1.1 m of the profile.
Overall, the strata observed in Trench Area-P#1 reflect the natural profile of the Mantachie series
of soils, but the upper portion appears to have been truncated, rework by sheet flow, with
eventual deposition of more recent fluvial sediments.

75

Trench Area-P#2
The stratigraphic profile of this trench contains more flat lying strata than the first. It is
positioned roughly 120 m north/northeast of the initial trench placed in the Little Cypress
Bottoms. The stratigraphic profile is reminiscent of the Mantachie soils series; therefore, the
interpretations made concerning that soil will be used to interpret this stratigraphic profile. The
Munsell color associations are somewhat different between the two, but these differences can be
attributed to the fact the soils in the field were much drier than normal due to the drought
conditions.
The uppermost stratum is composed of dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4-4/6) sandy loam with
reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) fine mottles. The stratum does not have a correlate in the natural
profile of the Mantachie soil series, but it does appear to be a weakly developed A horizon. It is
roughly 35 cm thick.
The underlying stratum is composed of strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) sandy loam with mottles of
light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4). It has a moderately fine subangular blocky structure and
correlates well with the B21 horizon reported for the Mantachie soil series. Thus, it is being
interpreted as a B horizon. It is a flat lying stratum that is 30 cm thick. The contact between this
and the layer above is clear.
The underlying stratum is composed of white (10YR8/1) or very pale brown (10YR7/3) sandy
loam with mottles of brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) and yellowish red (5YR 5/8). The stratum
correlates well with the B22g horizon reported for the Mantachie soil series. Thus, it is being
interpreted as a 2B horizon. It is roughly 25 cm thick and the contact between it and the
overlying stratum is clear.
The underlying stratum is composed of white (10YR8/1) or very pale brown (10YR7/3) sand with
mottles of brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) and yellowish red (5YR 5/8) and increased ironstone and
sandstone pea-sized clasts (five to ten percent). The stratum is basically the same matrix as the
overlying stratum, but it has increased gravels. Thus, it is being interpreted as a 3B horizon,
which is 30 cm thick. The contact between this and the overlying stratum is clear.
The final stratum observed in this trench profile is composed of reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) and
yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) with mottles of gray (10YR 6/1) sand. The stratum correlates fairly
well with the lower B Horizons reported for the Mantachie soil series. Thus, this stratum is being
interpreted as a 4B horizon. The stratum extends down the lower 1-1.3 m of the profile and has a
contact that is clear with the overlying stratum.
Overall, the strata observed in Trench Area-P#2 reflect the natural profile of the Mantachie series
of soils, but the upper portion appears to have been truncated with redeposited materials
accumulating at a later time. The two uppermost strata in this profile probably relate to the
beginning of the clear cutting of the timberlands in the region. The mixture of charcoal is
probably a direct result of the massive fires used to rid the land of accumulated forestry waste,
while the fine mottles of reddish clays in the uppermost stratum are eroding into the flood plains
of the surrounding heavily eroded uplands.

76

Trench Area-P#3
This trench is located 100 m north/northeast of trench Area P-#2. It is situated on slightly higher
ground than the previous two trenches, and indicates a completely different stratigraphic profile
than previously observed. The landform on which it is situated is reportedly composed of the
Latch-Mollville complex, 0 to 1 percent slopes of soils that includes smaller portion of
Wrightsville, Raino, and Bienville soils (Roberts 1983:24). The soils in this area have been
heavily truncated, with the majority of it either being moved away by human behavior or being
eroded away by the flood waters of the Little Cypress Creek. Regardless, it appears that the area
is a small portion of the Raino soil sequence situated on the Little Cypress Creek flood plain that
has been eroded to clay.
The overlying stratum is composed of gray (10YR 6/1) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) clay
loam that is 30 cm thick. It does not correlate well to any strata associated with the recognized
soils in the region; therefore it probably is the result of deposition post erosional events. The soil
in this area has also most likely been plowed, because next to this trench Locality 9, which is an
old disk plow, was identified. The plowing of this soil would only have quickened the pace of
erosion. The horizon is being interpreted as a C horizon.
The underlying stratum is composed of yellow (10YR 7/6) clay loam with mottles of reddish
yellow (7/5YR 6/6) clay that is 36 cm thick. It likewise does not correlate well with the natural
profiles of the known soils in the region; therefore, it is most likely the result of the active fluvial
environment in the Little Cypress Creek Bottoms. It appears to be a combination of the matrix
below and some of the materials eroding from the uplands around the area. The horizon is being
interpreted as a 2C horizon.
The final stratum in the sequence observed in this profile is reminiscent of the B24t horizon
reported for the Raino soil series (Roberts 1983:60-1). It is composed of a red (2.5YR 4/8) to
reddish gray (2.5YR5/1) clay with mottles of reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8). It is extremely hard
and almost impossible to cut with a trowel. The lower 32 cm of the trench was composed entirely
of this clay.
Overall, the strata observed in Trench Area-P#3 reflects a truncated Raino soils series, which is a
minor component of the larger Latch-Mollville complex, 0 to 1 percent soils that is found
interspersed throughout the Mantachie soils predominating in the Little Cypress Creek Bottoms.
The uppermost portions of this Raino soil have been truncated from the combined pressures of
plowing and erosion. Only since the cessation of farming activities in the flood plain have the
soils begun to aggrade again, resulting in the first two strata observed in this profile.

Trench Area-P#4
The trench is located 100 m to the north/northeast of trench Area-P#3. It is situated on another
slightly elevated area, and has a more intact stratigraphic profile of the Raino series of soils than
the former trench. The soils in this area have been partly truncated, but the sequence is more
clearly recognizable.

77

The uppermost stratum is composed of gray (10YR 6/1) clay loam with yellowish red (5YR 5/8)
mottles. It can be correlated with the B21 horizon of the Raino soil series, and is interpreted as a
B horizon. It is 18 cm thick.
The underlying stratum is a composed of gray (5YR 6/1) and yellowish red (5YR 5/6-5/8) that
gradually fade into gray (7.5YR 6/1) with mottles of reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) clay. There is a
very diffuse contact between the two, but the point at which the change occurs is nearly
indistinguishable. This stratum is 80 cm thick and correlates well with the B22t and the B23t
horizons indicated for the Raino soil series. Since it was nearly impossible to tell these strata
apart in the field, it is best to deal with them as one unit during the discussion of the trench. The
contact between this and the overlying stratum is clear.
The final stratum in the sequence is composed of gray (2.5YR 6/1) clay with red (2.5YR 4/8)
mottles. It correlates well with the B24 horizon reported for the Raino soil series, and is,
therefore, being interpreted as a B horizon. The stratum composes the lowest 30 cm of the
stratigraphic profile. The contact between this and the overlying stratum is clear.
Overall, the strata observed in Trench Area-P#4 reflect a truncated Raino soils series, which is a
minor component of the larger Latch-Mollville complex, 0 to 1 percent soils that is found
interspersed throughout the Mantachie soils predominating in the Little Cypress Creek Bottoms.
The uppermost portion of the sequence in this soil has been truncated, but it is more in tact than
the profile observed in Trench Area-P#3. It is difficult to determine what the cause of the
differential preservation of the Raino soils series between the two locations might be at this time.

Trench Area-P#5
This trench is located roughly 200 m north/northeast of the Trench Area-P#4. All of the former
trenches were positioned within a clear cut lot, and this trench is near the southern most boundary
of the wooded lot to the north. It was decided that two trenches would be placed on this property.
One of the trenches would explore the potential of a slight topographic rise on the southern
boundary of the wooded lot, while the second would be placed on the slight topographic rise in
the center of the property just off an unimproved two-track road.
The remainder of the property was left untested because the trees were too large and thick to
remove in a timely manner with the equipment we had on site. There was also some concern
raised by the landowner about the preservation of the trees on the lot; thus, trenches were placed
in the best locations available.
The uppermost stratum of Trench Area-P#5 is composed of a brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) sandy
loam. It correlates well with the weak A horizon associated with the Mantachie series of soils. It
is a friable, fine granular sandy loam that is 38 cm thick.
The underlying stratum is composed of a brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) sandy loam with mottles
of reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8). It is a friable, fine granular sandy loam that is 30 cm thick. It
correlates well with the B22g horizon of the Mantachie series of soils, and is being interpreted as
a B horizon. The contact with this stratum and the overlying one is wavy and clear.

78

The underlying stratum is composed of reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8), brownish yellow (10YR 6/6)
and white (10YR 8/1) sands that grade into the matrix of the same materials above with increased
small gravels (five to ten percent) and mottles of red (2.5YR 4/8) sandy clay. The boundaries
between these two strata are extremely diffuse; therefore, they are being considered as one
stratum. This stratum corresponds well to the B22g and B23g horizons reported for the
Mantachie series of soils. The stratum is 80 cm thick and has a clear contact with the overlying
stratum.
The underlying stratum is the final observational unit in the sequence. It is composed of
yellowish red (5YR 5/8) and strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) sandy clay with mottles and streaks of
white (10YR 8/1) sandy clay. It corresponds well with the lowest reported B24g horizon reported
for the Mantachie series of soils. The stratum occupies the lower 85 cm of the stratigraphic
profile.
Overall, the strata observed in Trench Area-P#5 reflect the natural sequence indicated for the
Mantachie series of soils, which is dominant within the Little Cypress Creek flood plain. There is
no evidence of any buried soil in this location.

Trench Area-P#6
This trench is located 350 m to the north/north east of Trench Area-P#5. The trench is situated in
a recovering forest environment filled with trees with trunk diameters of eight inches or greater.
The trench was positioned in a location that appeared to be slightly elevated compared to the
surrounding area. Once the profile was exposed it appeared as if the sequence exposed was the
Latch series of soils.
The uppermost stratum is composed of dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) fine, sandy loam. The
stratum is an A horizon that correlates well with the reportedly associated A horizon of the Latch
series of soils. The stratum is 30 cm thick and is relatively flat lying with a clear boundary.
The underlying stratum is composed of a brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) sandy loam with mottles
of brown (10YR 4/4) sandy loam and gray (10YR 6/1) sandy clay. There are also small flecks of
charcoal commonly observed throughout the horizon. It is likely this stratum represents a
depositional sequence that was occurring during the period when the clear cut areas in the region
were being burned to clear the forestry byproduct. The horizon corresponds well with the A21
and A22 horizon being reported for the Latch soil series and is 35 cm thick. Thus, it is being
interpreted as a 2A horizon. The contact between this and the overlying stratum is clear.
The underlying stratum is composed of gray (7.5YR 6/1) sandy loam with mottles of reddish
yellow (7.5YR 6/8) and red (2.5YR 4/8) sandy clay. The stratum corresponds well to the B2t
horizon associated with the Latch soil series (Roberts 1981:58) and therefore, is interpreted as a B
horizon. It is 30 cm thick and is relatively flat lying. The contact between this and the overlying
stratum is clear.
The underlying stratum is composed of brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) and white (10YR 8/1) sands
with streaks and mottles of gray (10YR 6/1) and reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) sandy clay.
Originally it was subdivided into two strata in the field, but upon review the two strata are so
similar than a subdivision is considered completely arbitrary. The sands in this stratum tend to
79

get grayer with increasing depth and it correlates well with the C1 horizon reported for the Latch
series of soils. Thus, this stratum is interpreted as a C horizon that is 85 cm thick. The contact
between this and the overlying stratum is clear.
The lowest stratum is a brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) sandy clay with mottles and streaks of gray
(10YR 6/1) and reddish yellow (5YR 6/8). Originally this stratum was subdivided into two strata
in the field, but upon review the two strata are also very similar that a subdivision is completely
arbitrary. Thus, it is better to consider them the same stratum, which corresponds well to the C2
horizon reported for the Latch series of soils. Thus, this is being interpreted as a 2C horizon that
is 25 cm thick. The contact with this and the stratum above is clear.
Overall, the strata observed in Trench Area-P#6 reflect the natural sequence indicated for the
Latch series of soils, which comprises the topographically higher locations on the Little Cypress
Creek flood plain. The stratigraphic sequence of this soil is well preserved in this location, but
there was no evidence of cultural materials observed during the backhoe operations or the
profiling of the trench. There was no evidence of a buried soil in this location.

REROUTE #2
It was decided geoarcheological investigations needed to be conducted within the flood plain of
an unnamed eastern tributary of Walnut Creek, after it was discovered by the Project
Archaeologist and crew performing the initial pedestrian survey that the Bt horizon could not be
reached during normal shovel testing operations at a depth of 80 cm bs. The span where the
subsoil could not be reach exceeds 200 m (600 feet) beginning on the north side of the unnamed
creek extending northward along the proposed pipeline reroute. The geoarcheological
investigations were implemented in part because there are several large Caddoan sites in the
vicinity of this drainage; therefore it was necessary to test the deposits for potentially buried
archeological sites.

General Comments
The stratigraphic profiles in this area indicated that naturally occurring Iuka and Mantachie soils
in the flood plain of the unnamed eastern tributary of Walnut Creek are mostly intact (Figure 21).
In one of the trenches the natural occurring soil profile was absent; rather, it appeared to be a
profile of a former channel of the unnamed tributary, or the channel of an intermittent stream that
no longer contains the same volume of water. Regardless, there were no buried soils observed
during the geoarcheological investigations of this area. The stratigraphic profile from the trench
excavated on the ridge south of the unnamed tributary of Walnut Creek indicated a profile
reflecting the natural profile of the Bowie series of soils. There was no buried soil observed here,
just a naturally deep series of deposits associated with this soil type.

Profile Correlations
Four trenches were placed north of the unnamed eastern tributary of Walnut Creek (Figure 22).
In addition to these four trenches one trench was placed on the ridge south of this tributary.
There were three successive shovel tests that the excavators failed to reach the Bt horizon at
80

80 cm bs, near the location where a piece of lithic debitage was recovered (Locality 12). It was
decided a trench would be placed along this terrace to see what the stratigraphic profile looked
like in this location.
The first four trenches placed in this area, Reroute #2, were placed on the flood plain (AreaReroute2#1-Area-Reroute2#4) with the fifth trench (Area-Reroute2#5) placed on the southern
terrace. The stratigraphic profile designations used in the discussion of this area are summarized
in Table 6. Detailed discussions of the strata observed in each trench are provided in this chapter,
while a summary of the observations is provided in Appendix A.

Trench Area-Reroute2#1
The first trench located along the flood plain of the unnamed eastern tributary of Walnut Creek
was placed in a location that was assumed to be north of the more recently active sections of the
flood plain. The stratigraphic sequence observed in the trench was directly fluvial in nature; in
that, it was reminiscent of the Iuka soil series that is largely dominant in the flood plain of this
small unnamed stream.
The uppermost stratum is composed of brown (10YR 4/3) fine sandy clay loam. It correlates
with the A12 horizon or the second A horizon reported for the Iuka soil series. Thus, this stratum
is being interpreted as an A horizon that is 18 cm thick.

Soil Horizon Designations Used in Area Reroute 2
(after Vogel 2002)
Horizon

Definition

A

Addition of organic material, often removal of clay and weatherable minerals, or
plowing of other human induced disturbance (Ap). Formed at the surface or below O
horizon. Often but not always dark brown or gray, often granular or subangular blocky
in structure, lots of roots and/or bipores, sings of animal and insect burrowing. NO
sedimentary structure.

B

Accumulation of clay and/or weatherable minerals or otherwise altered by weathering
from the surface. Little or no accumulation of organic material. Usually browner or
redder than E or C horizons, usually blocky or prismatic in structure, some sings of
animal and insect burrowing. No sedimentary structure.

C

Subsurface mineral horizon, parent material for overlying horizons. Unconsolidated or
weakly consolidated, unmodified or very slightly modified by weathering process.
Any color, little or no soil structure (may be sediment structure left from deposition),
few or no roots and biopores, few or no signs of animal or insect burrowing.

Cr

Weathered or soft bedrock. Bedrock that is soft or is broken into pieces (will not make
a hammer “Ring”).

Note: only those designations used in the profiles for Area Reroute 2 are defined here.

The underlying stratum is a yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) fine sandy loam that correlates well
with the C1 horizon reported for the Iuka soil series. It is being interpreted as a C horizon as well
in this stratigraphic profile. The stratum is 60 cm thick and the contact between this and the
overlying stratum is clear.
The underlying stratum is composed of mottled light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) and yellow
brown (10YR 4/4) fine sandy loam. It correlates well with the C2 horizon associated with the
Iuka soil series, which is what it is being interpreted as here. The stratum is 70 cm thick, and the
contact between it and the overlying stratum is clear.
The final stratum in this sequence is composed of mottled light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) and
yellow brown (10YR 4/4) fine sandy loam with larger streaks and blocks of gray (10YR 6/1). It
seems to correlate fairly well with the C3 horizon associated with the Iuka soil series, which is
what it is being interpreted as here. The stratum extends for the final 20 cm of the profile, and
has a diffuse contact with the stratum above.
Overall, the strata observed in Trench Area-Reroute2#1 reflect the natural profile reported for the
Iuka soil series, which is also reported to be the dominant soil type along this part of the flood
plain of the unnamed stream. There was no evidence of any other buried soils in the profile or
any cultural materials observed during the profiling process.

83

Trench Area-Reroute2#2
This trench was placed 40 m north of the first trench. The stratigraphic sequence observed in this
trench is likewise reminiscent of the Iuka soil series. The uppermost stratum is composed of
yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) fine sandy loam. The A horizon in this trench is 46 cm thick and
contains almost the entirety of the root systems in the area.
The underlying horizon is composed of brown fine sandy loam with faint mottles of yellowish
brown (10YR 5/4) and streaks of gray (10YR6/1) sands. The stratum correlates well with the C1
horizon reported for the Iuka soil series. It is also being interpreted as a C horizon in this
stratigraphic sequence. It is 52 cm thick. The contact between this and the overlying stratum is
clear.
The underlying stratum is composed of mottled light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) and yellowish
brown (10YR 5/4) fine sandy loam. There are very few roots in this horizon, which is being
interpreted as a 2C horizon, since it correlates well with the C2 horizon reported for the Iuka soil
series. It is 74 cm thick. The contact between this and the overlying stratum is clear.
The final stratum in the sequence is a coarsely mottled light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) and
yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) fine sandy loam. The stratum correlates well with the C3 horizon
reported for the Iuka soil series. It composes the final 50 cm of the profile in this trench.
Overall, the stratigraphic sequence observed in Trench Area-Reroute2#2 reflects the natural
depositional sequence for the Iuka soil series that is the dominant soil type in this flood plain
environment. There was no evidence of any other buried soils in the profile or any cultural
materials observed during the profiling process.

Trench Area-Reroute2#3
This trench was placed 40 m to the north of trench Area-Reroute2#2. The stratigraphic sequence
observed in this trench is unlike the sequences observed in the first two trenches in this area. The
sequence in this section appears to be partly eroded and represents the periodic cycles of fluvial
erosion and redeposition. The stratigraphic sequence in this trench mostly likely represents a
truncated and disturbed Iuka soil profile, in that the upper portions of the sequences have been
removed by human behavior or erosion, while the lower portions appears to reflect the various
cutting and filling episodes common to active flood plains.
The uppermost stratum is composed of light gray (10YR 7/2) sandy loam with mottles of
yellowish brown (10YR 5/6). The stratum correlates well with the A11 horizon of the Iuka soil
series. It is 24 cm thick.
The underlying stratum is a massive coarsely mottled light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) with
mottles of yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam and sandy clay loam. Thus, it is likely this
stratigraphic profile represents a location of major disturbance, most likely resulting from the
erosion of the location due to flood waters as it is positioned in an area where a northern
constriction opens southward onto a more broad section of the flood plain. There is also a small
intermittent stream bed visible that closely hugs an elevational contour as it flows southward.
This stratum was nearly impossible to separate into smaller observational units, because the only
84

differences observed within the profile related to the size grading of the gravels. There are
various lenses of gravels interspersed throughout the matrix of this stratum with one large 12 cm
thick lens of gravel occupying a large portion of the center of the profile. These gravel lenses
most likely represent the bottoms of former channels than have since been filled in with sands.
The stratum represents the lower 2 m of the profile.
Overall, the stratigraphic sequence observed in Trench Area-Reroute2#3 reflects the history of
localized fluvial activities. The sequence is dominated by cycles of fluvial erosion and
redeposition. There was a active stream channel located in the area of this trench in the not so
distant past, but more recently the level of energy in the flows in this area have lessened allowing
for the development of a weak A horizon.

Trench Area-Reroute2#4
This trench was placed 50 m north of the former trench Area-Reroute2#3. It is the last trench
placed in this area, because shortly after this trench the depositional environment becomes similar
to the uplands, as the relative elevation increases. The soil profile observed in this trench is more
similar to the Mantachie series of soils than the Iuka, which in itself may be an indicator of the
shifts in elevation.
The uppermost stratum is composed of brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam. The stratum correlates
well with the A1 horizon reported for the Mantachie series of soils, and is therefore being
interpreted as an A horizon. It is 24 cm thick.
The underlying stratum is composed of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy loam, with fine
mottles of yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) and pale brown (10YR 6/3). The stratum correlates well
with the A2 horizon of the Mantachie series of soils, and it is being interpreted as a 2A horizon.
It is 60 cm thick. The contact between this and the overlying stratum is clear.
The underlying stratum is a composed of light grayish brown (10YR 6/2) clay loam with mottles
of pale yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) and mottles and streaks of gray (10YR 6/1) sands. The
stratum correlates with the B22g horizon of the reported Mantachie series of soil, or the B1
horizon. It is 70 cm thick and has a clear contact with the overlying stratum.
The final stratum in the sequence appears to be more of a Cr horizon in that it is composed of red
(2.5YR 5/6) clay with mottles of reddish gray (2.5YR 6/1) and pea-sized angular gravels of
ironstone. The stratum is very hard and does not correlate well with anything reported for the
Mantachie series of soils. The stratum occupies the lower 30 cm of the profile.
Overall, the stratigraphic sequence observed in Trench Area-Reroute2#4 indicates the naturally
occurring profile of the Mantachie series of soils being deposited over the top of the local
ironstone bedrock.

85

Trench Area-Reroute2#5
This trench was placed on the terrace overlooking the flood plain south of the unnamed creek, for
two reasons. The first was the fact that there was a roughly 100 m stretch where GMI
archeologists failed to reach the Bt horizon before reaching 80 cm bs or in some cases 1 m bs.
The second factor dictating this decision was the recovery of an isolated piece of debitage in the
area between 60-80 cm bs, referred to as Locality 13. Therefore it was necessary to inspect the
soil profile as a precautionary measure. The soils observed in this trench reflect the Bowie fine
sandy loam, 2 to 5 percent slopes that is common along this ridge (see Figure 22).
The uppermost stratum is composed of a brown (10YR 4/3) to pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy
loam. It is likely the two separated A horizons reported for this soil (Roberts 1983:52), were not
recognized given the field conditions. Therefore, it is assumed the A horizon in this profile
contains both. It is 26 cm thick.
The underlying stratum is composed of a pale yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam. It
correlates well with the B21t horizon or the B horizon of the Bowie series of soils. It is 80 cm
thick and the contact between it and the overlying stratum is clear.
The final stratum in this sequence is composed of yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) sandy clay loam
with mottles of red (2.5YR 5/6) that are most likely decomposing ironstone gravels. It correlates
well with the B22t horizon and occupies the lower 30 cm of the stratigraphic profile.
Overall, the stratigraphic sequence observed in Trench Area-Reroute2#5 reflects the reported
profile of the Bowie series of soil that occurs naturally along the uplands of the area.

SUMMARY AND ARCHEOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS
Geoarcheological investigations during this survey included a total of 19 backhoe trenches in four
different areas. The profiles in each of these areas failed to indicate the presence of a deeply
buried soil or paleosol capable of containing in situ cultural materials. The majority of the
trenches placed throughout these study areas represented in some form the naturally occurring
stratigraphic profiles of the locally dominant soil types, while others reflect the nature of rapidly
changing landforms resulting from both natural and human processes.
It seems likely that the uppermost sediments observed in the study areas, especially within
alluvial settings are very recent—not merely in geologic terms, but in human terms as well. Prior
to the land conservation measures instigated in the early decades of the twentieth century, lands in
much of the southeastern United States were poorly maintained; the gullying that resulted from
uncontrolled erosion may have been sufficient to have cleared the local stream valleys of existing
sediments, and subsequent activities may well have served to refill them relatively quickly with
new sediments, eroded from elsewhere. This maybe the major reason why in a number of
different trenches observed in the Little Cypress Bottoms the upper strata were at odds with the
naturally occurring profiles of local soils.
The portion of East Texas in which the study area occurs has been repeatedly timbered over the
past century-and-a-half. Clear-cutting was, and remains, the preferred method of timber
harvesting in the area. It is entirely possible that the sediments observed here consist of materials
86

that were stripped off uplands and are now choking the local stream valleys. Indeed, the upland
areas around all of the flood plains investigated have experienced some timbering in the last
twenty-five years, as evidenced by the recent overgrowth and lack of large trees, and exposed
bedrock in some places. It is no great stretch to imagine that the torrential spring rains washed
uplands soils from clear-cut areas into the nearest streams, and that this has happened on a
widespread level. This might explain the presence of minor channels incised into subsurface
strata or the apparent filled channel observed in Area Reroute 2.
To summarize, the trenching investigations have revealed that the profiles observed within the
study areas are the results of an active fluvial environments or are natural profiles of developed
regional soils. Many of the sediments appear to be very youthful, and probably result from mass
colluviation after the nearby uplands were denuded of timber. It is estimated that the uppermost
.5 m of the deposits observed in the profiles represents deposition occurring within the last
century. The better-developed structures observed in some of the trenches suggest profiles of
greater age, but even those strata probably date from the late Holocene. In any case, it is clear
that there is a limited potential within these areas for buried sites; therefore, the proposed pipeline
trenching will have no effect on buried archeological properties.

SURVEY RESULTS

INTRODUCTION
As a result of the present survey of the revised Lake O’ The Pines Regional Water Treatment
System, one newly discovered sites was located and documented, seven previously recorded sites
were revisited and/or reassessed, and 15 nonsite localities were identified (Table 7). Thus, there
were a total of 20 cultural resources properties investigated during this survey, but only evidence
relating to 15 of them were recovered from the project area. Those sites and nonsite localities for
which evidence was recovered in the field are summarized in Table 8.

ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES
The recent investigations at Lake O’ The Pines began with a review of the report and
recommendations GMI made in response to the initial survey of the original Lake O’ The Pines
Southside Regional Water Supply System in 2003-04 (Lintz et al.). Closer scrutiny of these
earlier recommendations was, in part, a response to KSA streamlining their construction plans
and attempting to implement cost saving mechanisms, by requesting to open cut more of the
project area that they had originally planned to bore. Thus, as a means of assisting KSA in their
endeavor, GMI reviewed the earlier recommendations of avoidance. As a result of the review of
the report, GMI decided to revise a recommendation made in the initial report concerning the
previously known site 41GG65. A full discussion of this revision is presented in this chapter.
GMI also proposed to revisit sites 41UR291 and 41UR247, because more data were needed to
accurately assess the recommendations made in the report concerning these two sites.
As a result of these construction shifts GMI revisited site 41UR247, and was planning to revisit
site 41UR291 when it became clear some of the originally surveyed pipeline had been rerouted.
These reroutes post date the original plans presented to GMI during the 2003-04 survey of the
original Lake O’ The Pines Southside Regional Water Treatment System, and in effect created a
proposed pipeline corridor that no longer impacted either of these two sites. GMI upon
understanding the full implication of the reroutes abandoned plans to revisit site 41UR291. Thus,
site 41UR291 will not be discussed in detail in this report, but since site 41UR247 was revisited
there is a discussion of the site present in this chapter.
In addition to those site revisits described above, the newly revised sections and the rerouted
section of the originally proposed corridor for the Lake O’ The Pines Regional Water Treatment
System was passing through four previously documented sites (41MR4, 41MR161, 41MR262
and 41UR7). Three of the four sites locations were investigated on the ground (41MR4,
41MR161 and 41MR7), but no evidence of any of them was identified. Site 41MR262 lies within
the confines of the Lake O’ The Pines and therefore could not be investigated directly. In addition
to those investigations, one previously undocumented site was located (41UR323).
The details surrounding the revised recommendations, the site revisits, and the one newly
documented site are discussed within this section of the report. Those sites that could not be
relocated are still discussed in detail within this section, because regardless of the material
recovered, site revisit forms will be prepared and submitted to the Texas Historical Commission
updating the condition of each of these sites. The nonsite localities are also discussed in this
chapter, after the discussion of the sites.

Site 41GG65 – Revised Recommendation
The site was originally discovered during the survey for the City of Longview Waterline by
researchers from Archaeological and Environmental Consultants, Inc. (Perttula and Nelson 1999).
They identified the site as being a low density, subsurface lithic scatter of minimal research value
and recommended that no further research was needed on this site. The Texas Historical
Commission amended the recommendation by Perttula and Nelson, and called for the site to be
avoided during the construction of the City of Longview Waterline. The recommendation of
avoidance was followed during construction, as the line was bored underneath the site, but
extensive use of heavy machinery, evident from the lack of vegetation and subsequent
91

acceleration of erosion has adversely impacted the site. Gravel was spread across the northern
portion of the site in an attempt to slow the erosion, but the shovel testing conducted by GMI
under Permit Number 3184 in 2003-04 indicated the site was disturbed (Lintz et al. 2004:66-68,
Appendix H).
The 2004 GMI report recommended that further investigations of the site needed to be carried out
despite the fact a 1999 survey recommended the site needed no further investigations and the fact
the site has been adversely impacted. GMI presently feels the 2004 recommendation made by
GMI was in error, and that this site should not have been recommended for further investigations.
A subsequent telephone conversation on the 12th of September 2006 with Mr. Ed Baker of the
State of Texas Historic Preservation Office supported GMI’s amended recommendation.
Therefore, there is no need for further investigations on this site.

41MR4 – Revisit
Likewise, no evidence was found of site 41MR4. The site is reportedly characterized by a large
mound about 150-x-100 feet in size. The exact dimensions of this site are unknown for
construction conducted in relation to the Lake O’ The Pines impacted the area at the time the site
was recorded in 1957. The reported size of the site has fluctuated over the course of time, and it
is now identified as a large area surrounding and including the present Mims Water Intake Station
on the Lake O’ The Pines (see Figure 2).
GMI revisited this site during the survey of the newly revised pipeline corridor, and observed the
area was extensively disturbed mostly due to erosion. The initial construction and likely
renovation of the Mims Intake Substation, and subsequent installment of a gravel drive have
contributed to the destruction of this site (Figure 23). There was no evidence of the site recorded
during the survey.

41MR161 – Revisit
Site 41MR161 was first reported in 1996 as a 40-x-40 m surficial scatter of prehistoric lithics and
late nineteenth century artifacts located on the northern end of an upland ridge (Nelson 1996) (see
Figure 2). The original site file indicates the subsurface deposits were not tested. The location of
the site according to the on-line version of the THC Archaeological Site Atlas position it directly
on a segment of a pre-existing unimproved two-track road running north to south through the
Coleman property. The property is presently in timber, and the soils appear to be intact with
minimal impact from erosion. These observations in combination with the fact the proposed
pipeline will be installed in roughly the equivalent location as this unimproved two-track road
helped GMI archaeologists to classify the area as a high probability area, and shovel tests were
excavated along two transects. One transect followed the west side of the two-track, while the
other closely paralleled the east side of the same two-track road. These two transects were off-set
and shovel tests were conducted in 20 m intervals.

GMI revisited this site area during the survey of the newly revised pipeline corridor and due to
ground visibility issues could not search for surficial artifacts. The shovel testing throughout the
area failed to produce any materials directly attributable to this site. There was one prehistoric
flake recovered from this survey area, but this flake lies over 100 m south of the reported location
of site 41MR161, and therefore is not considered to be associated with this site.

41MR262 – Revisit
The previously recorded site 41MR262 is the section of the Port Bolivar Iron Ore Railroad (PB &
IO) that crosses Lake O’ The Pines. The site is the remaining portion of the railroad grade
created between 1912-14 for the purpose of connecting Longview and Ore City with Hughes
Springs. The 50-mile long track was designed to carry iron ore between locations and operated
from 1912 to 1927. Despite the fact the track was operational, it is reported the line never carried
any of the iron ore it was originally intended to carry. The line was abandoned and dismantled in
1927 (USACE 2003).
The survey conducted for the newly proposed pipeline corridor did not directly investigate this
site, as it is now located beneath the present-day Lake O’ The Pines Reservoir. Since the railroad
grade has most likely been impacted by current action within the lake, it is recommended that the
proposed construction will have no significant impact on site 41MR262.

93

41UR7 - Revisit
Site 41UR7 was originally recorded and placed in the THC Archaeological Site Atlas on the basis
of B.B. Gardner’s testing of a site within the region in 1931. According to the file located on the
THC Site Atlas website, a field notebook referred to as “Anth Notebook 1931 #1”, supposedly
contains reference to this site but is unhelpful in terms of determining the site location. The file
also fails to indicate the site type and associated artifacts. Thus, there is a great deal of
uncertainty about the location and nature of this site.
Reportedly, there are black and white negatives contained within the THC collections indicating
the setting of the site, but at present these pictures have yet to be matched to the existing
landforms. It is assumed the reason this has not been completed is because the reported location
of 41UR7 (west of the historic Walnut Creek Baptist Church) has been altered drastically by
modern developments including houses and several paved roads. It might still be worth the effort
to make an attempt to match these documents to the existing landscape.
Regardless of the confusion surrounding this site, GMI tested the location for which this site was
identified in reroute #3 at a shortened interval by treating it as high probability area (see Figure
5). The only material recovered from within the boundaries of site 41UR7 relates to a trash dump
that is presently being referred to as Locality 11. It is assumed Locality 11 is not associated with
site 41UR7, for the materials present at Locality 11 post date the notes on file for this site,
meaning that this trash dump would not have been present at the time the initial notes on site
41UR7 were created.

41UR247 – Revisit and Recommendation
Site 41UR247 is a large, previously recorded, prehistoric site located on a gently-sloping
interfluvial terrace between two branches of Walnut Creek and lies at an elevation of 92 m
(300 ft) amsl. The site encompasses the width of a 200-m-wide utilities corridor that currently
contains three power lines and at least one underground gas line, and archeological materials
continue into the forested areas on each side of the corridor. The interfluvial terrace landform is
heavily eroded, particularly on its southern end, and much of the topsoil across the site (and likely
much of the cultural material also) has been mechanically disturbed or removed. The vegetation
observed during the present survey consisted primarily of invader or disturbed-ground and
pioneer species like goatweed, briars, short grasses, sumac, and yaupon, as well as the ubiquitous
poison ivy/oak. The forest on each side of the corridor consists of the pine/hardwood mix typical
of the area. Soils for the site area are mapped as Bowie fine sandy loam, 2 to 5 percent slopes
(Roberts 1983).
Prehistoric site 41UR247 was initially recorded in 1999 as the Walnut Creek Village site by Mike
Turner of Lone Star, Texas, and a member of the Texas Archeological Stewards Network. Mr.
Turner indicated that cultural materials extended across the entire corridor (about 200 m) and at
least 200 m along the length of the corridor, and thus the site area was reported as exceeding
40,000 m2. Mr. Turner reportedly collected a range of cultural materials from site 41UR247.
Lithics consisted of a Gary dart point, the basal portion of a second unidentified dart point, a
medial biface fragment, a pitted stone, a grinding stone fragment, and 36 pieces of debitage of
chert, quartzite, petrified wood, sugar quartz, and novaculite. The dozen prehistoric ceramic
sherds consisted of fingernail punctated, engraved, incised, and plainware specimens.
94

Considering the extensive expanse containing artifacts and the diversity of the artifact
assemblage, Turner regarded site 41UR247 as a village site with “tremendous” potential research
value. He recommended test excavations be performed to establish its significance and eligibility
for NRHP eligibility and SAL designation. Unfortunately, local relic collectors also knew about
the site; Mr. Turner records on his initial site form, dated 1999, indicates he witnessed looters on
the site with probes, searching for buried features. Much of the area seems to have suffered from
surface collecting and looting.
In October 2000, archeologists from the environmental firm of Burns and McDonnell revisited
site 41UR247 and performed a program of shovel testing in two site areas, spaced about 50 m
apart (Campbell 2000). Their investigations indicated that the site covered about 7,000 m2,
measuring approximately 120 m N-S by 60 m E-W. They noted that much of the site area had
been disked, and that a large portion had suffered erosion due to the ongoing removal of topsoil
by the landowner. The only positive shovel test (of 20 excavated) yielded two flakes from
contexts 6–22 cm bs. In addition, the Burns and McDonnell archeologists collected 12 ceramic
sherds and one flake from the surface on the highly eroded southern end of the site. In order to
reconcile the low artifact density covering the large site reported by Mr. Turner, Campbell
(2000:III-12) concluded that 41UR247 may actually represent a cluster of several associated
short-term sites rather than a single large intensively used village site. Due to the extent of
disturbance and the lack of intact deposits, Campbell (2000:III-12) recommended the site
ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP.
Site 41UR247 was revisited during the initial survey conducted by GMI in 2003-04. During this
revisit, GMI archaeologists failed to recover any artifactual materials from shovel tests conducted
in the proposed ROW, but they did recover 18 flakes, seven ceramic sherds and a reworked flake
tool from an eroded swale just outside the project area; various items, including debitage, firecracked rock, and burned clay, were observed but not collected. Since only surficial evidence
was recorded at this time for this site GMI proposed to revisit this site during the 2006 survey. It
needed to be known if in fact the site contains any depositional integrity otherwise the
recommendation for avoidance was solely based on surficial evidence. The GMI survey of 200304 did not provide that information because GMI archaeologists at that time placed shovel tests
within the proposed ROW in a location that had already been adversely impacted by the previous
construction of transmission lines. Therefore, GMI archaeologists in 2006 wanted to explore the
potential of the deposits within the proposed pipeline corridor at this location outside the area
impacted by the power line construction (Figure 24).
GMI archaeologists identified the location on the ground and proceeded to place shovel tests
between the areas where shovel testing was reportedly conducted in 2003-04. The southern most
shovel tests produced a total of 10 sherds, while the northern shovel tests were sterile. The
southern shovel tests also reached the Bt horizon or equivalent sub-soil, while those more
northerly shovel tests failed to reach the Bt horizon at 80 cm below surface.
Additional research into the nature of the site indicates the testing conducted on what was
assumed to be site 41UR247 actually involved both sites 41UR247 and 41UR246. The confusion
about these two sites stems from the 2004 GMI report, which indicates the entire area contained
within the site map for site 41UR247 is only site 41UR247 when in fact the original submitter of
the site forms intended the areas to the north and south of the unimproved two-track road to be
two separate sites (Figure 25).

It is the opinion of this researcher that these two sites should be considered the same site for a
number of reasons. The two sites are on the same landform, and are only separated on the ground
by a borrow pit and an unimproved two-track road (Figure 26). The artifactual materials
associated with each site are more or less contemporaneous. The basis of the original separation
was most likely due to the limitations imposed by the fact these sites were discovered during a
linear survey, which means the full delineation of each site could not be completed. Thus, the
initial researches were unaware of how extensive 41UR247 actually was to the west and east.
Even at present, site 41UR246 has not been fully delineated.

Regardless of the treatment of these two sites, 10 sherds were collected during the revisit from
two separate shovel tests. One shovel test contained nine body sherds (ST#1), while the other
shovel test contained a rim sherd (ST#2A). Two of the sherds are “plain ware” sherds, recovered
from subsurface deposits in one shovel test. The two sherds refit together, and have a relative
fine paste with sand and possible bone inclusions. The walls of these sherds are approximately
6 mm thick. The exterior colors range from light brown (7.5YR 6/4) to brown (7.5YR 5/4). The
interior colors of these two sherds range from light brown (7.5YR 6/3) to gray (7.5UR 5/1). The
cores of the sherds tend to not be as dark as the others, as the colors range from light brown
(7.5YR 6/4) to brown (7.5YR 5/2).
The vessel form is unidentifiable. But, the wide mouth, shallow carinated bowl form is relatively
common among a number of grog-tempered plainware, incised and engraved types in northeastTexas (cf. Sanders Plain, Canton Incised, Crockett Curvilinear Incised, Holly Fine Engraved,
98

Pennington Punctate, etc.; Suhm et al. 1954; Suhm and Jelks 1962). Since the decorations never
extend below the abrupt carinated shoulder in any of the above-referenced types, it is possible
that these sherds from 41UR247 could be from the undecorated basal portion of wide-mouthed,
shallow, carinated bowls, representing any of several kinds of Caddoan wares.
There were seven sherds recovered that have wall thicknesses that range from 6 to 9 mm and
appear to be closely related. These seven sherds include six body sherds, and one rim sherd. The
exterior colors of these sherds range from reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6), light brown (7.5YR 6/4),
and light reddish brown (7.5YR 6/4) to dark brown (7.5YR 3/2). The interior colors of these
sherds range from brown (7.5YR 5/4 – 4/4) to dark brown (7.5YR 3/4). The cores of these sherds
tend to be somewhat darker and show a reduced firing streak, and the colors range from black
(7.5YR 2.5/1) to very dark gray (7.5YR 3/1). There are two sherds that refit together that appears
to be lighter in color than the rest, representing possible differential treatment post deposition or a
separate vessel altogether.
The exterior surfaces of these sherds show closely spaced, relatively parallel striations that are
interpreted to represent a brushed surface. The lack of diagnostic surface morphology attributes
of these body sherds prevents interpretation of the vessel form. Based on the apparent brushed
surface, the grog-temper, and the color ranges, these sherds are tentatively classified as Bullard
Brushed (Suhm and Jelks 1962:252).
The rim sherd is too small to determine the orifice diameter using a standard sizing chart, but it
does provide some additional information. The rim itself is smoothed over and straight with what
appears to be purposeful flattened on the interior of the rim. It does not refit onto any of the other
recovered sherds, but it shares a number of characteristics with the body sherds including
exterior/interior color, core color and surface treatment.
One of the sherds from ST#1 possesses an exterior red slip. The exterior surface of the sherd is a
yellowish red (5YR 5/8), while the interior surface is a very dark gray (5YR 3/1) to black (5YR
2.5/1). The paste is fine with no visible inclusions, save some possible fine sand grains. The core
of the sherd is heavily reduced and is black (5YR 2.5/1). Red slipped wares made by using a red
hematite slip are noted by Perttula (1995:338) to occur with some regularity within the ceramic
assemblages associated with the Early and Middle Caddoan periods.
It is difficult to assign these sherds to specific types because they are fairly small. But, the best
estimate at present is that seven of the sherds discussed represent the Bullard Brushed pottery
type (Suhm and Jelks 1962:252). According to Thurmond (1990:112), Bullard Brushed first
appeared in the region during the transitional Middle Caddoan period (about A.D. 1250–1350) and
became a significant component of the Late Caddoan Cypress cluster (A.D. 1350–1680), which
lasted through the Whelan and Titus phases (A.D. 1350–1430 and A.D. 1430–1680, respectively).
These phases represent the western expression of a localized Late Caddoan culture that included
the Belcher and Bossier phases in the eastern portion of the range.
The red slipped sherd may very well be a fragment of a red hematite slipped carinated bowl or
bottle that was regularly part of the Early or Middle Caddoan ceramic assemblage (Pertulla et al.
1993:338). If this sherd is a fragment of such a ceramic form, then there is greater evidence to
support the idea posed by Lintz et al. (2004) that this site has the potential of helping to further
illuminate the transition of ceramic traditions between the Early and Middle Caddoan periods.
The other sherds due to their small size and lack of distinguishing characteristics could not be
assigned to a type.
99

In view of the exasperatingly small size ceramic assemblage it may be best to speak generally
rather than specifically and assume that the pottery might be indicative of both Early and Late
Caddoan assemblages. Interestingly, the recovery of a Gary point from the site by previous
researchers may also indicate the presence of a much earlier occupation, possibly during the
Archaic or Early Ceramic periods, and Perttula and Turner (2000) suggest that the pitted stone
found by Turner may mark a Woodland period component. Nevertheless, it is also possible that
Caddoan people using this location collected and transported earlier tools from other sites in the
region to recycle them in order to compensate for the scarcity of chert resources in the area.
Regardless, the site appears to be a large site that deserves additional attention presently outside
the bounds of the current survey.
No attempt was made to delineate the absolute site boundary of site 41UR247 during the current
investigations for two reasons: (1) most of the site lies outside the current project area; and (2)
the site limit was delineated by Burns and McDonnell less than three years ago (Campbell 2000).
It was also discovered during the 2006 revisit to the site that the deposits are considerably deeper
than originally anticipated. The northernmost shovel tests failed to encounter the Bt horizon at 80
cm bs, while the more southerly ones encountered it at roughly 50 cm bs. As a suggestion for
future research, it might be a worthy endeavor to backhoe trench just off the eastern edge of the
pre-existing power line easement to see what the profile indicates about the nature of the deposits.
It should be noted this survey indicates sites 41UR247 and 41UR246 may still retain significant
research potential. Therefore, it is recommended a formal testing phase be conducted on these
sties to resolve whether all materials are derived from a single Caddoan component or if multiple
occupations from Archaic, Woodland, and Early Ceramic periods are present. Second, if Mr.
Turner’s suspicion that the site represents a village is true, then deep pit features, postholes from
houses, and burials may have survived the topsoil harvesting, the linear trenching for the pipeline
installation, and the utility pole installations. Finally, segments of the site within the wooded
areas on each side of the utility corridor may contain relatively intact cultural deposits. Site
41UR247 is presently outside the proposed APE; therefore, no further archeological
investigations are necessary in relation to the proposed project. However, if future projects are to
impact sites 41UR247 and 41UR246, GMI recommends that additional investigations be
conducted to formally determine the research potential of the remaining intact site area.
41UR323 – Newly Documented Site
This previously undocumented site was discovered during the shovel testing of Area N, or the
Walnut Creek drainage (see Figure 3). GMI archeologists decided to shovel test the area in 60 m
intervals because it was initially observed that the Bt horizon was not reached at 80 cm bs in the
first few shovel tests conducted in the area. The entire area appeared to be largely a continuation
of the same landform; therefore, the testing interval was set to 60 m unless the Bt horizon could
be reached and then the interval would be reduced to 30 m.
GMI archeologists discovered prehistoric materials in the ST# 7 along the only slightly elevated
section of the area (Figure 27). GMI archeologists upon finding prehistoric materials shifted to a
strategy of systematically shovel testing the entire topographic rise using a 10 m interval. Twenty
shovel tests were excavated along the westernmost edge of this topographic rise, and prehistoric
materials were collected from two of those probes (Figure 28). The materials totaled five pieces
of lithic debitage. There were two flakes and three pieces of shatter. The flakes appear to be
from bifacial thinning or the final stages of lithic tool production. There are least three different
types of raw material represented in the assemblage (quartzite and two different types of chert).

The site was not fully delineated as the positive probes represent the easternmost edge of the
existing Lake O’ The Pines proposed pipeline ROW. The landform fails to continue westward,
and additional shovel tests attempting to delineate the western boundary of the site failed to
produce any additional material. Therefore, it is thought the potential for the site to continue
eastward along the landform is high. It is unknown how far the site continues, because it does
appear as if the topographic rise was likely mined for gravel at some point in the past. The site is
also the location of where two previous unimproved roads intersected, according to earlier
topographic maps.
The significance of this site is largely unknown as it is assumed the majority of the site extends to
the east out of the Lake O’ The Pines proposed ROW. The present survey did not fully delineate
the site due to the constraints of the ROW and land owner permission. It is recommended the site
be fully delineated at some point in the future, but for now, the portion of the site in the proposed
right-of-way is a low density lithic scatter with limited potential for research. GMI archaeologists
set a temporary datum onsite with a cap reading “GMI LOP 3.”

LOCALITIES AND ISOLATES
A locality is considered to represent an ephemeral use area and, lacking substantial cultural
remains, fails to meet the criteria for a site. Localities are not assessed for eligibility for inclusion
in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL, but are documented in reports.

Locality 1 (Area B)
Area B was the second segment of the newly proposed pipeline corridor surveyed. It is a section
that begins on the eastern side of Cherry Blossom Road and extends eastward to a “T” stop in the
proposed pipeline corridor on the east side of a northwest/southeast-running power line corridor.
Locality 1 was discovered on the northeast corner of the Hyde property. The majority of this
locality lies outside the study area, but due to the deflation of this modern trash pile, various glass
bottles and cans have rolled into the project area (see Figure 8).

Locality 2 (Area C)
Area C was the third segment of the newly proposed pipeline corridor surveyed. It is a section
that begins where Area B ends at the “T” intersection on the east side of a northwest to southeast
running power line corridor. The area runs southward to Old Avinger Road. Locality 2 was
discovered on the southern ridge. It is a deflated push pile of trash composed of various pieces of
clear, blue and green glass. There are plastic bottles, pieces of modern sinks, light bulbs and
unidentifiable fragments of metal sitting on top of the push piles, which were probably disturbed
as a result of the construction of the substation. It is a push pile situated to the east of the existing
power line easement that is filled with modern trash (see Figure 8).

Locality 3 (Area C)
Area C was the third segment of the newly proposed pipeline corridor surveyed. It is a section
that begins where Area B ends at the “T” intersection on the east side of a northwest/southeastrunning power line corridor. The area runs southward to Old Avinger Road. Locality 3 was
discovered near the southern end of this segment to the east of an electric substation that lies
north of Old Avinger Road. It is a trash pile that has been partially scraped away by a bulldozer,
probably as a result of the construction of the electric substation. The trash pile consists of clear,
blue and green glass. There are fragments of aqua colored plastics and small unidentifiable
fragments of metal mixed throughout. The refuse appears to be less than 50 years in age and is
therefore considered to be ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP or the SAL program (see Figure
8).

Locality 4 (Area D)
Area D was the fourth segment of the newly proposed pipeline corridor surveyed. It is a section
that begins south of Area C at the location of Old Avinger Road, and continues southward to the
east of the existing power line easement to Sandy Creek. Locality 4 was discovered when
investigating the upper reaches of the northernmost intermittent stream and consists of a trash pile
containing large appliances and other modern trash (see Figure 8).

103

Locality 5 (Area G)
Area G was the seventh segment of the newly proposed pipeline corridor surveyed. It is a section
that begins at the southern end of the Colman property and continues to the southern shore of
Lake O’ The Pines. Locality 5 is a pile of asphalt shingles, rugs, and other construction waste
(see Figure 9).

Locality 6 (Area G)
Area G was the seventh segment of the newly proposed pipeline corridor surveyed. It is a section
that begins at the southern end of the Colman property and continues to the southern shore of the
Lake O’ The Pines. Locality 6 was an isolated find that consisted of a prehistoric flake. There is
a site (41UR161) reported in the area, but this isolated flake falls outside of the reported boundary
for that site. Six shovel tests were placed around or near the shovel test producing the flake, but
each of these additional shovel tests was negative. Therefore, given that this single flake was the
only artifact recovered from investigations in the area, the locality is classified as an isolated find
and requires no additional investigations (see Figure 9).

Locality 7 (Area O)
Area O was the twentieth segment of the newly proposed pipeline corridor surveyed. It is a
section that parallels the eastern boundary of the Mont property running from Wisteria Trail
southward to the “T” intersection concluding Area B. Locality 7 was a modern trash pile
dominated mostly by Campbell’s BBQ bean cans and plastic culvert lining (see Figure 8).

Locality 8 (Area L)
Area L was the twelfth segment of the newly proposed pipeline corridor surveyed. It is a section
that is part of the originally proposed pipeline, but at the time of the initial survey, the landowners
refused to allow entry onto their property. The section runs along the southern side of FM 3245
from the preexisting water treatment facility on the south side of FM 3245 to a paved drive on the
Foster property. Locality 8 appears to be the remains of a makeshift tree house. Various pieces
of construction debris and pieces of 55-gallon drums are scattered throughout a small intermittent
streambed (see Figure 10).

Locality 9 (Area P)
Area P is the section marked for geoarcheological investigations between where the proposed
pipeline crosses Glade Creek across the Little Cypress Bottoms to just south of previously
recorded site 41UR293. Locality 9 was discovered during the excavation of Backhoe Trench 4.
It is a disk plow that a tree has gradually grown around (see Figure 10).

104

Locality 10 (Area 3)
Area 3 is the third identified reroute on the originally proposed pipeline corridor. It is an area
near the historic Walnut Creek Baptist Church. Locality 10 was discovered during the excavation
of the northernmost shovel test in the area. It is an isolated piece of non-diagnostic shatter. Two
other shovel tests were excavated near it, but both of these shovel tests were negative. Therefore,
given that the lithic specimen was the only artifact recovered from investigations in the area, it is
classified as an isolated find and requires no additional investigations (see Figure 11).

Locality 11 (Area 3)
Area 3 is the third identified reroute on the originally proposed pipeline corridor. It is an area
near the historic Walnut Creek Baptist Church. Locality 11 was discovered on the southern bank
of a small intermittent stream. It is a large dump that has begun to erode into the creek. The
dump extents the entire length of the bank and is composed of glass soda bottle dating to or
shortly after World War II, tin cans, shoes, indiscriminate glass bottles, and fragments of a flower
vase constructed from white “milk” colored glass (see Figure 11).

Locality 12 (Area 2)
Area 2 is the second identified reroute on the originally proposed pipeline corridor. It is a major
shift in the proposed pipeline that swings the pipeline to the east away from four previously
identified archeological sites (41UR245, 41UR246, 41UR247 and 41UR249). Locality 12 was
discovered near where the reroute will meet the originally proposed pipeline corridor at its
northernmost edge. The locality is composed of a single thick, flat piece of historic-age glass (see
Figure 11).

Locality 13 (Area 2)
Locality 13 was discovered on a ridge south of the unnamed eastern intermittent tributary of
Walnut Creek. It is a single piece of prehistoric lithic shatter. Three additional shovel tests were
conducted around this original shovel test, and all were negative. Therefore, given that this piece
of shatter was the only artifact recovered from investigations in the area, it is classified as an
isolated find and requires no additional investigations (see Figure 11).

Locality 14 (Area 2)
Locality 14 was discovered near the location where the proposed pipeline first comes into contact
with the right-of-way (ROW) of Spider Lilly Road. Apparently, trash bags have been strewn
around in the woods, and these bags contain modern trash such as plastic bottles and glass jars.
In addition, mattresses, various stuffed animals, and other unidentifiable items are scattered
about. The materials appear to be less than 50 years in age and are therefore considered to be
ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as a SAL (see Figure 11).

105

Locality 15 (Area A)
Locality 15 was discovered near the intersection of E. Main St. or FM 450 and Meadowbrook
Road. The excavation of a shovel test in this area produced two small fragments of possible
handmade brick and a fragment of a cut nail. Additional shovel tests in the vicinity were sterile,
indicating these items represent an isolated find. The material could be associated with a turn of
the century structure, but given the fact no other materials were identified it is considered to be a
locality rather than a site and ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as a SAL
(see Figure 8).

CHAPTER 7
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The intensive pedestrian survey of the revised Lake O’ The Pines Water Treatment System was
designed to investigate the project area for previously undocumented cultural resources, reassess
previously recorded archeological sites within the project area, and to collect sufficient data for
the evaluation of the eligibility of each property for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as
a SAL. An assessment of the NRHP eligibility of each of the eight sites discussed in this report and
fifteen identified nonsite localities recorded during the present survey were presented along with the
description of each property in Chapter 6. This chapter presents a more detailed discussion of the
NRHP and SAL criteria and provides a summary of the assessments of the identified archeological
sites in relation to their potential for fulfilling these criteria. In addition, the recommendations for
the future treatment of these resources, initially presented in Chapter 6, are summarized.

ELIGIBILITY FOR INCLUSION IN THE NRHP
The archeological properties discussed in this report were evaluated according to criteria based on
federal regulations for determining the significance of cultural resources for inclusion in the
NRHP. Determinations of eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP are applied following the
identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture is present in
districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design, setting,
materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
(a) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns
of our history; or
(b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual
distinction; or
(d) that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history [36
CFR § 60.4].

107

Usually, Criterion “d” is applied to most prehistoric and many historic sites. Important
information is generally recognized to refer to scientific importance. However, scientific
importance is partially driven by the research perspectives of the time and in part by the state of
available information regarding a particular research topic in a specific research area. The
purpose for conducting archeology should not be to fill museum drawers with relics, but rather to
fill informational gaps relating to specific research domains. As research progresses within a
region, well-excavated sites contribute information to some of those research domains. Through
time, data needs for some research questions may be addressed to various degrees, even though
complementary data are often needed from different periods, seasons, settings, and site types to
fully understand the diversity of activities. As data required to address specific questions
approach redundancy, such information may diminish the priority of that kind of repetitive
information needed from nearby sites. This suggests that the identification criteria of important
historic properties are tied to both a specific geographical area, reflecting a cultural adaptation or
region, and a state of accumulated knowledge about a research domain. Archeological sites with
integrity containing artifacts and features that can contribute information toward addressing
research issues are regarded as significant and are eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.
Archeological sites that exist on static landforms, such as bedrock surfaces or ancient upland
hilltops that lack eolian sands, can contain concentrated densities of artifacts and feature remains.
Such “palimpsest” remains of occupations are generally regarded as having very little or no
research potential for contributing useful information toward the understanding of prehistory,
because the artifact assemblages are mixed and not interpretable. In such cases, the sites are not
regarded as scientifically important, and in general, these kinds of sites are not eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP.
The most ideal kinds of archeological remains are those left in rapidly aggrading settings, where
there is a chance for non-cultural sediments to separate a series of materials and residues
representing brief, short-term activities. Usually, aggrading alluvial, wind-blown or eolian sand
sheets and dunes, and sometimes colluvial slopewash are the kinds of settings and events that are
apt to quickly bury archeological remains and preserve the discreteness of activities. The
evaluation of the depositional potential is one of the key characteristics for distinguishing the
integrity of deposits.

Comments on NRHP Eligibility Criteria
Full assessment of NRHP potential is admittedly preliminary during this survey phase of
investigations, but each property may be evaluated in relation to the criteria set forth in 36 CFR §
60.4. Of particular importance is the requirement that an archeological property should be
capable of yielding information important to the understanding of prehistory or history. To guide
research in Northeast Texas, which includes Lake O’ The Pines, Peter et al. (1990) proposed a
series of research themes specific to the region. Similarly, the Advisory Committee to the
National Register Programs Office of the THC has identified nine broad research themes for the
Historic period throughout Texas as a whole (Jones 1990). Also applicable are five broad,
regional historic contexts, or “study units,” defined by the Texas Historical Commission as
having priority for prehistoric studies in Northeast Texas, along with various associated research
questions (Fields and Tomka 1993; Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993; Perttula 1993a, 1993b; Perttula
et al. 1993). All these research themes are summarized in Table 9.

Information is useless in a vacuum. Thus, the first criterion of significance for any archeological
property at Lake O’ The Pines is considered to be its capability to yield information relevant to
one of the historic contexts or research themes listed in Table 6. Of course, whether or not
specific archeological properties exhibit such potential or contain data relevant to any particular
historic context or research theme is dependent upon a precondition of contextual integrity of the
archeological deposits. For example, a prehistoric site buried by sediment within an aggrading
river levee has a far greater potential for containing undisturbed deposits than one located on an
eroding upland surface. The nature of contextual integrity as it affects research potential of a
property, must, however, also be viewed as relative, since different research problems require
different types of data. In their introduction to the East Texas plan, Kenmotsu and Perttula
(1993:10) note the following:
It is a truism that most archeological sites are disturbed due to a variety of natural and cultural
processes, such as bioturbation and timbering. However, just because they have been disturbed
does not mean that their integrity has been unduly diminished or lost. It has been demonstrated
time and again that archeological deposits containing significant information are still intact and
have integrity even after agricultural activities, timbering, etc., have occurred, because these landdisturbing actions only penetrate a certain subsurface depth and can be expected to leave features
and archeological deposits below a plow zone or churned soil. The best way to determine the
condition and integrity of an archeological site is to examine its subsurface context through soil
probes and exploratory test units dispersed across the site, and assess the level of soil churning,
the stratigraphy, and the potential for middens and cultural features to be preserved.
110

For each archeological property within the present project areas, the intensive pedestrian survey
was designed to provide a preliminary assessment of the following:
1. The content of the cultural deposits (i.e., the range of artifactual and feature information
available).
2. The integrity of the cultural deposits (i.e., is the site undisturbed, bioturbated, deflated, etc.).
3. The context of the cultural deposits in relation to both the cultural environments of the
appropriate time period, when that time period was clear.
One goal of this project was to use the information derived from the survey to evaluate each site and
its potential for increasing our knowledge of past lifeways, contributing to the resolution of
regionally pertinent research questions, or containing information relevant to any of the above
research themes or problems. Unfortunately, as discussed in detail in a later section of this chapter,
most of the sites discovered proved to retain little research potential, and the remainder require more
extensive work before their potential contributions can be determined.

ELIGIBILITY FOR INCLUSION IN THE SAL PROGRAM
At the state level, archeological sites may be considered significant and be recognized or
designated as an SAL, provided that at least one of the following conditions is met:
1. The archeological site is situated on lands owned or controlled by the State of Texas or one of its
political subdivisions; or
2. The archeological site is situated on private lands which has been specifically designated as an SAL
. . . and fits at least one of the following criteria:
(A) Preservation of materials must be sufficient to allow application of standard archeological
techniques to advantage;
(B) The majority of artifacts are in place so that a significant portion of the site’s original
characteristics can be defined through investigation;
(C) The site has the potential to contribute to cumulative culture history by the addition of new
information;
(D) The site offers evidence of unique or rare attributes; and/or
(E) The site offers a unique and rare opportunity to test techniques, theory, or methods or
preservation, thereby contributing to scientific knowledge [Texas Natural Resources Code
1977; Title 9, Chapter 191, Texas Antiquities Committee, Section 191.094 and Chapter 41.7,
Antiquities Code of Texas].

Comments on SAL Eligibility Criteria
The Lake O’ The Pines Regional Water Supply System is being developed by the Northeast
Texas Municipal Water Authority, whose existence is due to State of Texas enabling legislation,
and is for the benefit of several communities whose charter is recognized by the State of Texas.
Thus, the conditions as entities of the State of Texas mean that the first condition of the SAL
designation is met. The five criteria of the second condition are very generalized, occasionally
ambiguous, and might apply to virtually any archeological site. For example, the first criterion of
sufficient preservation of materials to “allow application of standard archeological techniques to
advantage” is vague as to the meaning of the use of “techniques to advantage.” Clearly, some
kinds of surface recording techniques could be applied to preserved chipped stone remains in a
111

highly disturbed and shallow archeological site for the advantage of illustrating methods in a
classroom teaching exercise. But we would argue that without some degree of context, such sites
are neither worthy of nor warrant SAL designation simply because they contain archeological
remains. We tend to place greater emphasis on the SAL criteria for sites with integrity (criterion
B), addition of new information (criterion C), and/or unique or rare attributes (criterion D), over
the criteria for the preservation sufficient to apply archeological techniques (criterion A) or the
mere opportunity to test techniques, theories, and methods (criterion E). In so doing, the SAL
criteria strongly resemble the NRHP criteria involving the criteria of site integrity and potential to
contain information significant to prehistory. Based on the survey results derived from surface
inspection and the placement of a few shovel tests, we are able to identify some sites that do not
contain important information. However, for some sites, additional data collection using formal
test excavations is needed to formally resolve the importance of the site. As such, they are
regarded as having an “unknown eligibility” status.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The present survey in the vicinity of Lake O’ The Pines Revised Water Supply System resulted in
the investigation of 23 archeological properties: six previously recorded sites (41GG65, 41MR4,
41MR161, 41MR262, 41UR7, and 41UR247 [Walnut Creek Village]) and one newly recorded
site (41UR323). The data on these sites, plus that of site 41UR292 (Lintz et al. 2005), are
summarized in Table 10. In addition to the archeological sites, fifteen nonsite localities were
identified (Table 11). It should be noted in regard to the previously recorded sites that attempts
were made to relocate five of the six sites (41MR4, 41MR161, 41MR262, 41UR7, and 41UR247
[Walnut Creek Village]), because the sixth site (41GG65) was reviewed without having to collect
additional data. Of these sites, only one was successfully relocated in the field (41UR247). Site
41UR292 is discussed in this chapter because it is the only site recommended for avoidance
during the construction of the pipeline. All eight sites, as well as their recommendations, are
summarized in Table 12.
Of the six cultural sites investigated in the project area, five sites, 41GG65, 41MR4, 41MR161,
41UR7, and 41UR323, are attributed to an unknown prehistoric period (see Table 10) based on the
lack of any diagnostic materials from the sites. Site 41UR247, the Walnut Creek Village site, dates
primarily from the Caddoan period, though it may also have an earlier Archaic and/or Woodland
components. The other site, 41MR262, includes remnants of the Port Bolivar Iron Ore railroad
grade in the vicinity of the Lake O’ The Pines, which dates to 1912 – 1927.
Current conditions and National Register recommendations for the seven archeological sites
evaluated (or re-evaluated) by the present project are presented in Table 13. Of the sites within the
present APE, sites 41GG65 and 41UR323 are recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the
NRHP, for they are low density lithic scatters offering little additional scientific knowledge. Sites
41MR4, 41MR161 and 41MR7 are sites that could not be relocated within the APE; therefore, no
further work is required in relation to this construction project. It is noted, however, that these sites
may still exist in or near their originally reported site locations. The portion of site 41MR262, the
Port Bolivar Iron Ore railroad grade, affected by the proposed pipeline is presently beneath the
waters of the Lake O’ The Pines. Since the railroad grade has most likely been impacted by current
action within the lake, it is recommended that the proposed construction will have no significant
impact on site 41MR262.

As a result of this study and the previous Lintz et al. (2005) investigations, only one site (41UR292)
is presently within the proposed APE that requires avoidance. Site 41UR292 is recommended for
avoidance through the process of boring because of its “unknown eligibility”. If avoidance of the
site is not possible, a test excavation strategy, and ultimately, a data recovery strategy, if necessary,
should be developed in consultation with State Historic Preservation Office.
One site—41UR247—is thought to have good research potential, and formal testing is
recommended to assess more fully the integrity and information content of this site. Formal
National Register test excavations are recommended to better determine the NRHP status of
41UR247. This recommendation does not impact the proposed Lake O’ The Pines Revised Water

Criteria for density categories:
High = Average subsurface artifact density within the site area equals 5 or more artifacts per shovel test.
Medium = Average subsurface artifact density ranges from 3 to less than 5 artifacts per shovel test.
Low = Average subsurface artifact density is less than 3 artifacts per shovel test.

Criteria for levels of contextual integrity:
Good = Site judged to be largely intact; only identifiable disturbances due to bioturbation, erosion, and localized or limited
cultural activity.
Fair = Site judged to be only partially intact; several types of limited cultural disturbances may be present, including light-duty
roads, fences, possible machine disturbance, erosion and deflation, and bioturbation.
Poor = Site judged to be only minimally intact; evidence of heavy disturbance or destruction of the site, due to structure
removal, erosion, or other processes.

Supply System pipeline, because a reroute has since pulled the pipeline to the east of this site
area. Rather, this is a recommendation for future researchers to fully investigate this site and the
sites nearby (41UR245, 41UR246, and 41UR249) in case another project threatens to potentially
impact them, because it is the opinion of this researcher there is greater potential at these sites
than what they have previously been afforded. Thus, it is recommended these sites be
investigated when an additional potential impact seems imminent.
The results of the geoarcheological investigations indicate there are no buried paleosols or strata
present that can potentially contain deeply buried archeological sites. Therefore, the construction
team is clear to open cut additional areas in the Little Cypress Bottoms, Walnut Creek Drainage,
the unnamed eastern tributary of Walnut Creek, the southern terrace overlooking the unnamed
eastern tributary of Walnut Creek and the southern shore of the Lake O’ The Pines. No further
geomorphological investigations are necessary unless the client decides to reroute the proposed
pipeline in these areas between the time of the survey and the laying of the waterline. If
additional changes were to occur in pipeline alignment, GMI recommends the revised routes be
surveyed to ensure that other sites are not impacted.

115

In addition to the archeological sites, fifteen nonsite localities were identified during the present
survey. Twelve localities yielded historic materials; while three localities date from an unknown
prehistoric period. Given the low threshold of cultural material at these locations (isolated
surface artifacts or artifacts recovered from only one shovel test), these instances of isolated finds
fail to meet the criteria for sites and are considered to have no research potential. No further
cultural resources investigations are recommended for these localities.

BACKHOE TRENCH DESCRIPTIONS

BACKHOE TRENCHES
In addition to the intensive pedestrian survey, geoarcheological investigations were conducted on
three separate occasions in four different areas. The first session of geoarcheological
investigations occurred on October 28, 2006, within the Walnut Creek flood plain and along the
southern shore of the Lake O’ the Pines. The second session of geoarcheological investigations
occurred on October 30, 2006 within the Little Cypress Creek flood plain, and the third session
took place on December 5, 2006, in the vicinity of an unnamed eastern tributary of Walnut Creek.
The primary purpose of these investigations was to determine whether archeological sites were
buried within the flood plain sediments. A total of 19 trenches were excavated within the project
area and they all revealed stratigraphic sequences dominated by recent deposition and/or sections
or complete profiles of the naturally occurring soils commonly observed in the respective areas.
The recent deposition is probably derived from sediments washed off nearby uplands as a result
of historic timber clear-cutting. No cultural materials were identified within this phase of the
investigations, nor where they any buried soils or paleosols observed. A full discussion of these
investigations can be found in Chapter 5.
Area G
Trench Area G-#1: The trench was placed roughly 40 m to the south/southeast of the present
Lake O’ The Pines shoreline. It is the closer of the two trenches placed in this area to the Lake O’
The Pines. The trench excavations never reached the full depth, because a very hard layer of
ironstone and clay was encountered at roughly 1.5 m (5 ft) deep. The trench indicated a less
complex stratigraphic profile than the second trench in this area. The trench was roughly 70 cm
wide, 5 m long and was orientated 30 degree east of magnetic north.

the proposed pipeline moves north/northeast. This trench is slightly south of the 250 ft. interval
indicated on the USGS topographic map. The trench dimensions were 4.7 m long, 70 cm wide,
1.2 m deep with an orientation roughly thirty-degrees east of magnetic north. The depositional
sequence is somewhat different from that observed in the three southern trenches.

Area P – Little Cypress Creek Flood Plain
Trench Area-P#1: The stratigraphic profile observed in this trench matches well with the
natural profile described for the Mantachie series of soils is predominate over this portion of the
Little Cypress Creek Bottoms. There are some minor soil discrepancies between the observations
made in the field and those given as the official description of the soils, but these minor
differences can be attributed to the fact the soils observed in the field were extremely dry. The
region has been suffering drought conditions for over a year and the soils are exceedingly dry. It
is because of the extremely dry recent weather that trenching of this Little Cypress Creek
Bottoms could proceed. This trench was 5.5 m long, 70 cm wide, 2.5 m deep orientated roughly
five degree east of magnetic north.

Trench Area-P#2: The stratigraphic profile of this trench contains more flat lying strata than the
first. It is positioned roughly 120 m north/northeast of the initial trench placed in the Little
Cypress Bottoms. The stratigraphic profile is reminiscent of the Mantachie soils series; therefore
the interpretations made concerning that soil will be used to interpret this stratigraphic profile.
The Munsell color associations are somewhat different between the two, but these differences can
be attributed to the fact the soils in the field were much drier than normal due to the drought
conditions. The trench is 5.2 m long, 70 cm wide, 2.75 m deep and orientated roughly ten
degrees east of magnetic north.

Trench Area-P#3: This trench is located 100 m north/northeast of trench Area P-#2. It is
situated on slightly higher ground than the previous two trenches, and indicates a completely
different stratigraphic profile than previously observed. The landform on which it is situated is
reportedly composed of the Latch-Mollville complex, 0 to 1 percent slopes of soils that includes
smaller portion of Wrightsville, Raino, and Bienville soils (Roberts 1983:24). The soils in this
area have been heavily truncated, with the majority of it either being moved away by human
behavior or being eroded away by the flood waters of the Little Cypress Creek. Regardless, it
appears that the area is a small portion of the Raino soil sequence situated on the Little Cypress
Creek flood plain that has been eroded to clay. The trench in this location was 3.6 m long, 70 cm
wide, 1.2 m deep and orientated ten degrees east of magnetic north.

Trench Area-P#5: This trench is located roughly 200 m north/northeast of the Trench Area-P#4.
All of the former trenches were positioned within a clear cut lot, and this trench is near the
southern most boundary of the wooded lot to the north it was in relation to this property that the
sampling strategy was fully implemented. It was decided that two trench would be placed on this
property. One of the trenches would explore the potential of a slight topographic rise on the
southern boundary of the wooded lot, while the second would be placed on the slight topographic
rise in the center of the property just off an unimproved two-track road. The trench unfortunately
did not indicate a higher elevation stratigraphic profile, rather it appeared to be a profile of the
Mantachie soils series.
The remainder of the property was left untested because the trees were too large and thick to
remove in a timely manner with the equipment we had on site. There was also some concern
raised by the landowner about the preservation of the tress on the lot, thus rather than clearing
locations for trenching it was decided we would fit in trenches in the best locations available. The
first trench in the wooded lot was 4.5 m long, 70 cm wide, 2.43 m deep and was orientated
roughly forty degrees east of magnetic north.

Trench Area-P#6: This trench is located 350 m to the north/north east of Trench Area-P#5. The
trench is situated in a recovering forest environment filled with tress with trunk diameters of eight
inches or greater. The trench was positioned in a location that appeared to be slightly elevated
compared to the surrounding area, and the space needed to be cleared of trees in order to place the
trench. Once the profile was exposed it appeared as if the sequence exposed was the Latch series
of soils. The trench is 5 m long, 70 cm wide, 2.4 m deep and orientated twenty degrees east of

Area Reroute 2 – Unnamed Eastern Tributary of Walnut Creek
Trench Area-Reroute2#1: The first trench located along the flood plain of the unnamed eastern
tributary of Walnut Creek was placed in a location that was assumed to be north of the more
recently active sections of the flood plain. The stratigraphic sequence observed in the trench was
directly fluvial in nature; in that it was reminiscent of the Iuka soil series that is largely dominant
in the flood plain of this small unnamed stream. The trench is 4.6 m long, 80 cm wide, 1.75 m
deep and orientated in accordance with magnetic north.

Trench Area-Reroute2#3: This trench was placed 40 m to the north of trench Area-Reroute2#2.
The stratigraphic sequence observed in this trench is unlike the sequences observed in the first
two trenches in this area. The sequence in this section appears to be partly eroded, and represents
the periodic cycles of fluvial erosion and redeposition. The stratigraphic sequence in this trench
mostly likely represents a truncated and disturbed Iuka soil profile, in that the upper portions of
the sequences have been removed by human behavior or erosion, while the lower portions
appears to various cutting and filling episodes common to active flood plains. The trench was
5.3 m long, 80 cm wide, 2.3 m deep and it was orientated in accordance with magnetic north.

Trench Area-Reroute2#4: This trench was placed 50 m north of the former trench AreaReroute2#3. It is the last trench placed in this area, because shortly after this trench the
depositional environment becomes similar to the uplands, as the relative elevation increases. The
soil profile observed in this trench is more similar to the Mantachie series of soils than the Iuka,
which in itself may be an indicator of the shifts in elevation. The trench was 4 m long, 80 cm
wide, 2 m deep and is oriented roughly in accordance with magnetic north.

Trench Area-Reroute2#5: This trench was placed on the terrace overlooking the flood plain
south of the unnamed creek, for two reasons. The first was the fact that there was a roughly
100 m stretch where GMI archeologists failed to reach the Bt horizon before reaching 80 cm bs or
in some cases 1 m bs. The second factor dictating this decision was the recovery of an isolated
piece of debitage in the area between 60-80 cm bs. Therefore it was necessary to inspect the soil
profile as a precautionary measure. The trench placed in this location was 3.5 m long, 80 cm
wide, 1.5 m deep and orientated roughly in accordance with magnetic north. The soils observed
in this trench are the Bowie fine sandy loam, 2 to 5 percent slopes that are commonly observed
along this ridge.

APPENDIX B
DEFINITIONS OF LITHIC ARTIFACT ANALYSIS TERMS,
CLASSES OF CHIPPED STONE ARTIFACTS
COLLECTED DURING THE PROJECT,
AND SUMMARY TABLE OF ARTIFACTS

DEFINITIONS OF PREHISTORIC LITHIC ARTIFACT ATTRIBUTES
AND VARIABLES
The following summary provides definitions for the attributes used in the analysis of the
prehistoric lithic materials from the project area. It is not intended to be a summary of all artifact
types expected to be recovered from the region, but more properly defines debitage attributes that
are conveyed in the accompanying table. The lithic materials are classified as seven pieces of
manufacturing debitage.
Unmodified Debitage
Unmodified debitage is the unused debris resulting from lithic reduction practices; it usually takes
the form of flakes, which must exhibit a platform and a bulb of percussion, and nondiagnostic
shatter and fragments. If the goal of the lithic analysis is to reconstruct human behavior, then the
main reason to analyze debitage is to derive inferences about what kinds of tools were being
made on site and what strategies were being utilized. The masses of knappable stone are
generally regarded as the “objective pieces” that can include cores, early and late stage bifaces,
and formal tools. The conversion of raw cobbles to usable tools can develop along several
different knapping strategies that depend upon the product sought by the flintknapper and the
culturally transmitted patterns of technological reduction. If the goal is the production of
delicate, expedient cutting pieces, then usually a core-flake or core-blade technology is the
defined strategy. There are many kinds of morphologically discrete cores, and the process of
reduction is dependent upon the size and geometry of the raw nodule, and the habitual
technologies of the knappers. But if the product is a stout, formal chipped stone tool with a
sinuous cutting edge (point, knife, etc.) than the reduction strategy typically follows a bifacial
route, with the added bonus that some flakes are also useful for tool production. There is a robust
literature discussing the virtues of expedient vs. formal reduction trajectories that reflect the
technological manufacturing stages of tools. The most critical observations consist of the
attributes allowing for the reconstruction of the reduction system. In the following classification,
six technological classes of lithic debitage are recognized and defined: 1) Core flakes, 2) Bifacial
flakes; 3) Flake Fragments, 4) Angular Debris or Shatter, 5) “Other Debris” and 6) “Not
Applicable” (see below). Furthermore, flake debris are subdivided into seven size classes: (1)
Size 1 (1 inch or 25 mm sieve); (2) Size 2 (3/4 inch or 19 mm sieve); (3) Size 3 (1/2 inch or 12.5
mm sieve); (4) Size 4 (ca. 1/3 inch or 9.5 mm sieve); (5) Size 5 (1/4 inch or 6.3 mm sieve); (6)
Size 6 (less than 1/4 inch or 6.3 mm sieve); and (7) Not applicable. Debitage may be further
distinguished by the amount of cortex remaining on the piece, but since the amount of cortex does
not provide direct information on reduction strategies, these attributes are discussed separately.
The technological stages are discussed below.
Core Flake Debris
Core flakes are pieces of debitage that retain all or most of the striking platform and have a
clearly discernable dorsal and ventral surface. In general, the defining characteristics that cooccur most often together in core flakes are 1) large and broad striking platforms; 2) flat and
unfaceted (sometimes cortical covered) striking platforms; 3) relatively abrupt angle (approaching
90 degrees) between the striking platform and the dorsal surface; 4) relatively few flake scars on
the dorsal surface; and 5) relatively salient or pronounced bulbs of percussion on the ventral
B-3

surface. Obviously, similar kinds of these attributes best characterize attempts to drive flakes
from nodules. But some of these attributes may be found in the flake debris derived from the
earliest flakes removed when initiating a bifacial or sinuous working edge. There were no core
flakes recovered during this survey.
Bifacial Flake Debris
In contrast to core flakes, the biface flakes tend to have 1) relatively narrow striking platforms; 2)
flake scar facets on the platform surface; 3) a very acute angle (approaching 30 degrees) between
the striking platform and the dorsal face; 4) few to many scars on the dorsal surface; and 5)
relatively diffuse bulbs. In addition, if a soft antler or wooden billet is used, the platform/ventral
juncture is apt to be lipped. Clearly the platform-dorsal face angle is a direct reflection of the
thinning of the biface—the thinner the piece, the more acute the platform-dorsal face angle is apt
to be. Even though these attributes comprise tendencies necessary to differentiate core vs. biface
manufacture, experience has shown that the classification is generally replicable. Three of the
seven pieces of lithic debitage recovered during this survey were identified as bifacial thinning
flakes.
Flake Fragment Debris
This class of debris consists of fragmentary flakes that have no remaining evidence of the striking
platform, but there is sufficient morphology to distinguish a dorsal surface and ventral surface,
which characterizes flakes. This is a general catch-all category to flake fragments that can not be
classified as core or biface flakes. There were no flake fragments recovered during this survey.
Angular Debris or Shatter
Angular debris or shatter is reserved for those pieces of debris that are too blocky or vague to
delineate the dorsal from ventral surface orientations. These items have been variously called
“angular chunks” or “spalls”, although some archaeologists have also used the latter term for
small flakes. The main characteristic of the members of this class is that all are broken rock
fragments exceedingly difficult to orient. Only one piece of shatter occurred among the 38
flakes from this project. Four of the seven pieces of lithic debitage recovered during this survey
were classified as shatter.
Other Debris
This is a catch-all category for distinguishing a series of very specialized flakes that merit further
discussion, yet occur in such low frequencies that do not warrant unique named groups. Item in
this group includes the specialized sub-class of bifacial flakes that are derived from notching
projectiles. No flakes from this project were assigned to this group.

B-4

Unknown Debris Type
This category is used for flakes with platforms that are unclassifiable due to their small size or
cataloging sealant that obscure the attribute of the platforms. No flakes from this project were
assigned to this group.
Degree of Flake Decortication
Many kinds of tool stones exist as nodules that have chemically altered weathering rinds that
usually have to be removed before knapping can achieve predictable and controlled fractures
leading to the production of sharp tools. Some sources and kinds of bedded cherts have no
significant cortex or chemically altered rinds at all. However, for those rocks with rinds, the
process of removing the rind or cortex from a cobble is called decortication. Over the years many
archaeologists have been concerned about documenting the degree of cortex present on the dorsal
side of flakes as a very crude measure to determine the stage of cobble reduction. Typically a
three-stage classification is used. Primary decortication flakes retain large amounts of cortex on
the dorsal surface; secondary decortication flakes have little cortex on the dorsal side; and tertiary
flakes lack evidence of cortex.
Traditionally, archaeologists assume that site assemblages with high numbers of primary
decortication flakes represent early stages of lithic reduction, whereas those with moderate to no
cortex remnants must be later stages of lithic reduction. In reality, though, the extent of context
on flakes provides very little useful information about knapping reduction patterns and tool
reduction strategies, but instead largely provide information about the form of raw materials.
This is because some decortication strategies can yield dozens of “primary” decortication flakes
from discrete ridges of a single cobble, while other tool reduction strategies may have only a
single primary decortication flake, with all subsequent removals being secondary or tertiary
decortication flakes. Furthermore, the size of the knappable cobbles adversely affects the
proportion of decortication flakes. Large cobbles and boulders yield proportionately fewer
decortication flakes, whereas small chert pebbles yield proportionately many decortication flakes.
Finally, the classification can not identify reduction patterns from groups of knappers who
scavenge older archaeological sites for large artifacts and decorticated cores to be used as a
source of tool stones for making other tools. Even though the stage of decortication is not
particularly useful, the extent of cortex was recorded for each of the formal flake types as a means
of corroborating the strategies of reduction. For purposes of this project, three classes of
decortication flakes were used: 1) primary, 2) secondary and 3) tertiary decortication flakes.
Primary Decortication Flakes (75 to 100 percent cortex)
These flakes have weathered cortex covering more than 75 percent of their dorsal surfaces.
Secondary Decortication Flake, less than (1 to 75 percent cortex)
These flakes have weathered cortex covering less than 75 percent of their dorsal surfaces.

B-5

Tertiary Flakes, no cortex
Tertiary (or interior) flakes lack all evidence of cortex on their dorsal surfaces. The flakes are
derived from the interior of the nodule, even though some tertiary flakes may be produced during
the first few minutes of nodule reduction. All three of the identified flakes in this survey are
identified as tertiary flakes.

DESCRIPTIONS OF PREHISTORIC CERAMICS
AND SUMMARY TABLE OF ARTIFACTS

DESCRIPTIONS OF PREHISTORIC CERAMICS
The class of ceramics/baked clay artifacts includes any artifact of prehistoric origin that resulted
from the burning, firing, or baking of earth or clay, either deliberately or accidentally. The only
type of ceramics/baked clay artifacts observed on this project consisted of ceramic vessel
fragments. Ceramic vessel fragments, or sherds, are usually the most common type of
ceramic/baked clay artifact on a prehistoric site and are simply the remains of fired clay vessels or
containers (i.e., pots). Sherds are subdivided on the basis of where on the vessel they originate:
lip, rim, neck, shoulder, body, and base.
The remaining sherd analysis of the prehistoric ceramics involved the use of a
technological/production model, including variables relating to paste and temper, forming and
shaping, surface finishing, firing, and style or form. The variables relating to paste and temper
included paste category, paste texture, identification of primary aplastic or temper inclusions, and
size class of primary inclusions.
Forming and shaping variables consisted of method of forming and method of shaping. Surface
finishing variables consisted of exterior surface treatment and interior surface treatment. Firing
variables include color of exterior surface, and color of interior surface and sherd core color. The
color definitions conform to the Munsell Soil color system. Finally, formal or stylistic variables
(when applicable) included vessel form, primary technique of vessel decoration, decorative
designs, rim form, rim contour, lip form, and/or base form. Additional variables that were
recorded included thickness of vessel rim, wall, and/or base; rim or vessel orifice diameter (if
reconstructible); and sherd weight. If several sherds fit together the number of sherds remains the
same, but the sherds that refit are placed into the same bag and treated as one sherd on the
analysis sheet with a note about the refit made in the comment field. Finally, whenever possible
ceramic type and variety were recorded under comments using references to ceramic types from
northeast Texas (Suhm et al. 1954; Suhm and Jelks 1962). Only ten ceramic sherds were
recovered from the one site 41UR247 during this survey project. The following provides a
summary description of the sherds.
Ceramics from 41UR247 - Revisit
The ten sherds from 41UR247 can be loosely grouped into two types: “plain ware” (n=2), red
slipped ware (n=1) and brushed (n=8). All are relatively small body sherds (weighing between
0.1 and 10.7 grams) that were recovered from subsurface deposits. Each type is described below
in detail.
Grog-Tempered “Plain Ware”
The two “plain ware” sherds were recovered from subsurface deposits in one shovel test. The two
sherds refit together, and have a relative fine paste with sand and possible bone inclusions. The
averaged thickness of the walls of these sherds is approximately 6 mm. The exterior colors range
from light brown (7.5YR 6/4) to brown (7.5YR 5/4). The interior colors of these two sherds range
from light brown (7.5YR 6/3) to gray (7.5UR 5/1). The cores of the sherds tend to not be as dark
as the others, as the colors range from light brown (7.5YR 6/4) to brown (7.5YR 5/2).

C-3

The vessel form is unidentifiable. But, the wide mouth, shallow carinated bowl form is relatively
common among a number of grog-tempered plainware, incised and engraved types in northeastTexas (cf. Sanders Plain, Canton Incised, Crockett Curvilinear Incised, Holly Fine Engraved,
Pennington Punctate, etc.; Suhm et al. 1954; Suhm and Jelks 1962). Since the decorations never
extend below the abrupt carinated shoulder in any of the above-referenced types, it is possible
that these sherds from 41UR247 could be from the undecorated basal portion of wide-mouthed,
shallow, carinated bowls, representing any of several kinds of Caddoan wares.
Grog-Tempered Brushed Ware
These seven sherds have wall thicknesses that range from 6 to 9 mm. These seven sherds include
six body sherds, and one rim sherd. The exterior colors of these sherds range from reddish yellow
(7.5YR 6/6), light brown (7.5YR 6/4), and light reddish brown (7.5YR 6/4) to dark brown (7.5YR
3/2). The interior colors of these sherds range from brown (7.5YR 5/4 – 4/4) to dark brown
(7.5YR 3/4). The cores of these sherds tend to be somewhat darker and show a reduced firing
streak, and the colors range from black (7.5YR 2.5/1) to very dark gray (7.5YR 3/1). There are
two sherds that refit together that appears to be lighter in color than the rest, representing possible
differential treatment post deposition or a separate vessel altogether.
The exterior surfaces of these sherds show closely spaced, relatively parallel striations that are
interpreted to represent a brushed surface. The lack of diagnostic surface morphology attributes
of these body sherds prevents interpretation of the vessel form. Based on the apparent brushed
surface, the grog-temper, and the color ranges, these sherds are tentatively classified as Bullard
Brushed (Suhm and Jelks 1962:252).
The rim sherd is too small to determine the orifice diameter using a standard sizing chart, but it
does provide some additional information. The rim itself is smoothed over and straight with what
appears to be purposeful flattened on the interior of the rim. It does not refit onto any of the other
recovered sherds, but it shares a number of characteristics with the body sherds including
exterior/interior color, core color and surface treatment.
Red Slipped Ware
One of the sherds from ST#1 possesses an exterior red slip. The exterior surface of the sherd is a
yellowish red (5YR 5/8), while the interior surface is a very dark gray (5YR 3/1) to black (5YR
2.5/1). The paste is fine with no visible inclusions, save some possible fine sand grains. The core
of the sherd is heavily reduced and is black (5YR 2.5/1).
Red slipped wares made by using a red hematite slip are noted by Perttula (1995:338) to occur
with some regularity within the ceramic assemblages associated with the Early and Middle
Caddoan periods. If this sherd is a fragment of such a ceramic form, then there is greater evidence
to support the idea poised by Lintz et al. (2004) that this site could be a site with the potential of
helping to further illuminate the transition of ceramic traditions between the Early and Middle
Caddoan periods.

FRAMEWORK FOR HISTORIC ARTIFACT ANALYSIS AND
ENUMERATION OF HISTORIC ARTIFACTS COLLECTED
DURING THE PROJECT

FRAMEWORK FOR HISTORIC ARTIFACT ANALYSIS AND ENUMERATION OF
HISTORIC ARTIFACTS COLLECTED DURING THE PROJECT

Introduction
The analysis of the historical material makes use of four major analytical categories or classes of
artifacts, consisting of:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)

Domestic;
Architectural;
Personal; and
Activities.

Unidentified metal fragments and ceramic or glass sherds that are unclassifiable as to category are
placed in a separate, indeterminate category. Although the use of these artifact categories may
perpetuate ideas about functional classifications, it is felt that at the survey level of research, such
an analytical framework is the most efficient way to handle the artifactual data.
Major artifact categories are sorted into various subcategories, including tableware, food storage,
and furnishings. These are then sorted into various classes, types, and subtypes, depending on the
type of subcategory and material type. In the case of ceramics and glass, these subtypes are
associated with manufacture or use dates whenever possible. The general nature of each of the
major artifact categories is discussed below.
DOMESTIC ARTIFACTS
The domestic category includes artifacts related to food service (i.e., tableware) and food storage
(including food preparation). The tableware subcategory subsumes some ceramic, glass, and
metal artifact types. Ceramic tablewares include stoneware, refined earthenware, coarse
earthenware, and porcelain types. Particular items are identified as to types and subtypes, based
on temporally sensitive technological (e.g., white/whiteware, light blue tint whiteware, blue tint
whiteware, blue tint ironstone, high-fired ironstone, ironstone/whiteware, transitional whiteware),
decorative (e.g., decalcomania, flow blue, blue shell edge), and/or other attributes (e.g.,
nonvitrified, vitrified, molded), and are assigned dates of production on this basis.
Food storage items or storagewares are also subdivided as to whether they were ceramic
(stoneware), glass, or metal. The stoneware items are further subdivided into types and subtypes
using technological and decorative attributes, such as paste (e.g., colored) and various
combinations of exterior treatment (e.g., gray bodied, bristol, cobalt, slipped, Albany slip, natural
slip) and interior treatment (e.g., blue gray, Bristol, slipped, Albany slip, unglazed). These
attributes form the basis for assigning production dates to individual specimens. One rim sherd of
a yellow ware was recovered during this survey, but is assumed to be of modern origin.
Glass storageware is subdivided on the basis of color (e.g., clear, manganese solarized, ash tint,
amber, light amber, brown/amber, opaque, cobalt blue, blue, aqua, light green, ruby); form
(generally bottle); and either decorative characteristics (e.g., etched, embossed, stippled base),
manufacturing attributes (e.g., mold-made, machine-made, press-molded), or sometimes function
D-3

(e.g., soda, beer/liquor, canning seal, depression glass, extract bottle). Individual items are given
artifact-specific dates based on the production dates for each of its various attributes, in
combination. The artifacts recovered during the survey relating to this category include: one
body sherd of manganese/sol dating to 1880-1920, one fragment of amber/brown glass of modern
origins, two light green modern coke bottle fragment, one pull tab, two fragments of aqua bottle
glass of assumed modern origin, and one fragment of clear glass assumed to also be of modern
origin.
Metal storageware pieces may consist of storage cans or pots, but are most often represented by
metal canning jar lids. No such lids were recovered during this survey.
The furnishings subcategory includes all nonfood service or food storage-related household items,
such as furniture, stoves, and lamp glass. The furnishings subcategory often comprises only a
small proportion of the total identifiable historical artifact assemblage from rural sites and the
actual recovered items may vary greatly. In many cases, the majority of the artifacts classified as
furnishings consist of fragments of lamp glass. There were no such artifacts recovered during this
survey.
Finally, it should be noted that not all ceramics or glass artifacts fall within the domestic category.
In some cases, artifacts of these materials belong within the architectural or activities categories.
ARCHITECTURAL ARTIFACTS
The architectural category includes all items that could be related to buildings or structures.
Subcategories of architectural items include such things as window glass, nails, brick, mortar
and/or plaster, ceramic tile or pipe, and electrical items. Nails are further subdivided as to
whether they are wrought, cut, or wire; and the brick is distinguished as to whether it is
handmade, machine-made, or high-fired. The inventory from the Lake O’ The Pines project
includes one wire nail post dating 1890, two aqua window fragments of modern origin, one small
(less than 1 cm in diameter) fragment of a possible handmade brick pre-1903, and a cut nail
dating to between 1840-1880.
PERSONAL ARTIFACTS
The personal item category includes items of individual use, such as clothing, buttons, shoes, doll
parts, cosmetic bottles, snuff bottles (identified on the basis of characteristics such as glass color,
bottle shape, and lip shape), musical instruments, and smoking pipes. Usually, artifacts that can
be classified in this category are rare, making this the least frequently represented category at
most historical archeological sites. There were 19 fragments of a pint liquor bottle recovered from
a shovel test placed on the newly documents site 41UR323, which is assumed to post date 1880
but is most likely of modern origin.

D-4

ACTIVITIES ARTIFACTS
The final analytical category of historical artifacts relates to what have been called activities
items. This category includes all nonhousehold items, such as those associated with
transportation activities and farm-related equipment. As with personal items, this category often
makes up only a small proportion of the overall assemblage of identifiable historical artifacts
from a site. Activity category items include truck or tractor parts, harness buckles, fence staples,
fence wire, horseshoes or horseshoe nails, and firearms cartridges. Subcategories for activities
items include tools, harness and equipment, transportation, machinery, farm-related, weapons,
and coal. Three artifacts fit this category. One of the artifacts is a piece of a lead pipe of
unknown origin, a second is a fragment of wire that tends to be fairly ubiquitous, and the third
artifact is a fragment of aluminum tube of unknown origin.
