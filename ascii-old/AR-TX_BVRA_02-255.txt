ABSTRACT
The Parker County Special Utility District (SUD) in central Parker County,
Texas plans to install a six-inch water line that will serve its customers. The length
of the water line will be 7300 feet with an easement of 15 feet (2.51 acres). In
response to a request by the Texas Historical Commission (THC), an
archaeological survey was performed by Brazos Valley Research Associates
(BVRA) on November 22 and 23, 2011 under Antiquities Permit 6095.
This
investigation consisted of a Pedestrian Survey and shovel testing on both banks of
Grindstone Creek, the only stream in the Area of Potential Effect (APE). No
prehistoric or historic sites were identified, and it was recommended that
construction be allowed to proceed as planned. Fairview Cemetery (PR C079) is a
historic cemetery owned by the Church of Christ that is located at least 200 feet
from the route of the proposed water line. Therefore, it will not be affected. Copies
of the report are on file at the THC, Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL), BVRA, the Texas State Library, Parker County SUD, and Jacob & Martin,
Ltd.

INTRODUCTION
Parker County SUD plans to construct a six-inch water line in rural central
Parker County (Figure 1). When completed, there will be approximately 7300
linear feet of treated six-inch water line added into the Parker County SUD water
distribution system. The proposed water line will connect two existing water lines
and serve approximately twenty-five customers. The pipe will be placed in a
trench three feet deep and two feet wide, and the easement is fifteen feet.
Grindstone Creek is the only stream crossing, and the pipe will pass beneath it at
a depth of about three feet using the technique of horizontal directional boring.
The entry point will be on the southeast bank, and the exit point will be on the
northwest bank, and both points will be about fifty feet from the bank of the creek.
The entire water line will be on private property and will be between twenty and
thirty feet from the road. As currently proposed, the new pipe will parallel the
west side of Sandy Hill Lane and south side of Fairview Road. The engineering
firm creating the plans for this project is Jacob & Martin, Ltd. of Weatherford,
Texas. A loan was made from the United States Department of Agriculture, Rural
Development, and Kerry Elder is the representative for that agency. The project
area investigated is depicted on the USGS 7.5â topographic quadrangle Brock
(3297-323) (Figure 2).

ENVIRONMENT
Parker County is located in an upland setting in North Central Texas and
covers an area of 902 square miles of undulating to hilly land with elevations that
range from 700 to 1200 feet above mean sea level (Dyksterhuis 1948). It is
bounded on the north and northwest by Wise and Jack counties, on the south
and southeast by Hood and Johnson counties, on the east by Tarrant County,
and on the west by Palo Pinto County. Part of the county is in the Western Cross
Timbers and the remainder is within what is referred to as the Grand Prairie.
Temperatures range from an average high of 96Â° Fahrenheit in July to an
average low of 34Â° Fahrenheit in January. Rainfall averages slightly more than
thirty-two inches a year, and the average growing season lasts 225 days. The
various streams in the county flow to the south and drain into the Brazos River,
the Clear Fork of the Trinity River, and the upper tributaries of the Trinity River.
The only stream in the APE is Grindstone Creek. Figure 3 is a view of this creek
looking to the southwest from Fairview Road. Major vegetation in Parker County
is composed of tall grasses, mesquite, and oak. The predominant soil type in the
area is sandy loam. Underlying the soils in much of the county is bedrock of the
Lower Cretaceous Paluxy Formation and Pleistocene clays. The major type of
bedrock is sandstone, but limestone and mudstone beds are also present.
According to the soil survey for Parker County (Greenwade, et al. 1977),
the soil on the west bank of the creek consists of eroded Chaney loam sand, 4 to
5% slopes (ChC2), and the soil on the east bank is described as Bunyan fine
sandy loam (Bu). Bunyan soil floods on occasion, but Chaney soils are not
prone to flooding. The A-horizon of Bunyan soils consists of fine sandy loam
from 0-10 cm, and the B-horizon is sandy clay loam from 10-20 cm. The Ahorizon of Chaney soils is loamy fine sand from 0-16 cm, and the B-horizon is
red sandy clay. The soil samples collected from shovel tests in the project area
were analyzed by a soil scientist from the NRCS field office in Bryan, Texas. His
findings have been incorporated into the Results and Conclusions section of this
report and Appendix I.

METHODS
Prior to the field survey, Jean Hughes checked the site records at TARL for
the presence of previously recorded sites in the project area. In addition, the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas was checked for known cultural resources in the project
area and to identify the kinds of sites known to exist in the county. The Parker
County soil survey (Greenwade et al. 1977) was used to identify the types of soils
in the project area, and soil samples from four of the shovel tests were taken to the
NRCS field office in Bryan for analysis. Information regarding Fairview Cemetery
was provided by Kathleen Poznick and Howard Ford. The field survey was
conducted by J. Randy Ferguson on November 22 and 23, 2011. His methods
consisted of a Pedestrian Survey and shovel testing. Six tests were excavated,
and they ranged in depth from 73 cm to 100 cm. Four tests were inside the fence
line on private property. Shovel tests 5 and 6 were excavated on the opposite side
of the fence because landowner permission had not been obtained to dig in this
area. Because of the extensive disturbance on both sides of the creek, more than
one test was not considered necessary in the disturbed areas. Dirt was screened
using Â¼ inch hardware cloth. Shovel test data were recorded on a shovel test log
(Appendix I). One of the shovel tests is illustrated in Figure 4, and the approximate
location of the shovel tests is presented in Figure 5. In addition, the project was
documented by a hand-held GPS, digital photography, and field notes.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
General
The project area is located in the North Central Texas Region as defined by
Biesaart et al. (1985:76) in a statistical overview published by the Texas Historical
Commission (Figure 6). This is an area well documented in terms of numbers of
sites when compared to other regions in Texas. When the statistical overview was
compiled in 1985, there were 2678 known sites (13.25% of the state) in the entire
region. Only one other region (Central Texas) reported more sites or had a higher
percentage statewide. In terms of county statistics; however, only Jack County had
fewer recorded sites (n=2) and Madison County was tied with three sites. At the
present time the total number of recorded archaeological sites, prehistoric and
historic, is 150. Since the statistical overview is no longer being compiled, it is not
possible to state what percentage of the total site number is prehistoric. According
to Biesaart et al. (1985:174), only one site had been described as belonging to a
specific period (Late Prehistoric). Site disturbance in 1985 consisted of erosion,
construction, and vandalism. One site had been tested by hand. The overview
does not provide site numbers. The reader is referred to the overview for more
statistical information concerning Parker County and its relation to the rest of Texas.
Previous Investigations
There have been no major archaeological investigations in Parker County.
Most of the work has been performed by contract archaeologists associated with
private firms and archaeologists working for state and federal agencies. The
nearest recorded sites are 41PR112 and 41PR113, and they were recorded by
archaeologists from TAS, Inc. during a pipeline survey conducted in 2006 and
2007 (Turner and Smart 2007). Site 41PR112 is a small burned rock midden
that yielded numerous flakes, two small projectile point fragments, and biface
fragments. Cultural materials were found to a depth of 50 centimeters. Site
41PR113 is a prehistoric site that is described on the site form as âunknown
prehistoric.â Artifacts recovered include a Gary dart point, chert flakes, and an
abrading stone fragment. The recorders date this site to the Middle Archaic of
Texas prehistory. This is a shallow site with all cultural materials found between
0 and 40 cm.
Archaeological studies associated with reservoir construction have been
carried out in the general area. The three reservoirs nearest the current project
area are Squaw Creek Reservoir in Hood and Somervell counties (Skinner and
Humphreys 1973), Joe Pool Lake in Dallas, Ellis, and Tarrant counties (Moir et
al. 1988), and Possum Kingdom Lake in Palo Pinto and Young counties. The
Works Progress Administration was responsible for the work at Possum Kingdom
Lake. Jean Hughes (personal communication) stated that no formal report was
written for this project.

Prehistoric Chronology
According to Krieger (1946), the cultural patterns in this region tend to
mirror those found to the east more than those identified farther west in the high
plains of the Llano Estacado. Since no defined culture sequence has been
established for the Lower Plains cultural unit, researchers are forced to borrow
the sequences defined in nearby regions such as Central Texas or North Central
Texas. Cultural chronologies for the North Central Texas area have been
presented by Brown (1987), Krieger (1946), Prikryl (1987), and Skinner and
Gallagher (1974). Chronologies for Central Texas have been prepared by
Prewitt (1981, 1985) and Carlson et al. (1986). Although there is some difference
in the terminology used by these researchers, they all agree that the last 10,000
to 12,000 years of prehistory and history for the area can be divided into four
major temporal periods. These are Paleo-Indian (12,000 B.P. to 8000 B.P.);
Archaic (8000 B.P. to 1250 B.P.); Late Prehistoric (1250 B.P. to 300 B.P.); and
Historic (300 B.P. to Present).

Historic Chronology
Parts of the area now known as Parker County were under Spanish or
Mexican rule, and no effort was made to colonize the area even though parts of
the county were part of an early land grant awarded to Stephen F. Austin and
Samuel May Williams. The area was inhabited by bands of Comanche and
Kiowa who resisted the influx of European settlers for about seventy years. Early
immigration began in the early 1850s due to an outbreak of malaria in nearby
Denton, Collin, and Tarrant counties and the establishment of the Butterfield
Overland Mail route in 1855. Some of the first settlers used Indian trails to reach
their destination. Under the leadership of State Legislator Isaac Parker, 224
settlers in the area signed a petition requesting the establishment of a new
county and in December of 1855 the state legislature formed Parker County from
Bosque and Navarro counties (Moore 1975) with Weatherford the county seat.
By 1860, 4213 people lived in the county. During the Civil War, the population
declined and that disrupted the local economy until the 1870s when the last
Indian raid occurred and thousands of new people moved to the county. The
county's population and economy continued to expand during most of the late
nineteenth century, encouraged by the construction of railroads that linked the
area to national markets, attracted newcomers, and led to the establishment of
new farms and communities. During the latter part of the 19th century, agriculture
consisted of cotton and corn and cattle production also played an important part
of the local economy.
Local farmers diversified in the years following World War II and peanuts
and hay became major components of the countyâs agricultural economy. By the
1960s, Parker County was one of the leading producers of vegetables, some
fruit, and livestock. By 1960, the population had increased to 22,881. During the
1960s, the construction of Interstate Highway 20 played a major role in
encouraging new residents to move to the area. Significant production of oil
began in the county after 1966, and in 1973 almost 823,000 barrels of crude oil
were produced there. Other new industries included dairy farming, sheep
ranching, and the production of poultry. Parker County continued to develop
during the 1970s and 1980s. The number of workers employed in light industries
climbed from 2836 in 1970 to 5917 in 1980. As increasing numbers of people
moved to the area to commute to Fort Worth, the population rose to 44,609 by
1980 and 64,785 by 1990.
The above information was regarding the historic chronology was taken
from works by Clements (1984), Gustavus (1931), Jordan (1935), the Parker
County Historical Commission (1980), and Kathleen and Clifton St. Clair (1982).
Additional information was obtained from an article by David Minor in the
Handbook of Texas Online.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Two prehistoric sites (41PR112 and 41PR113) are in the area, but they will
not be affected by the proposed construction. Fairview Cemetery is also nearby,
but the water line as currently proposed ends approximately 200 feet from this site
(Figure 7). The Church of Christ that owns this cemetery has records of all modern
burials, and not one is outside the fence. No cultural resources within the project
area were found. A pile of cut limestone rock was observed (Figure 8). According
to Howard Ford, cut limestone blocks were used in the construction of the new
bridge over the creek, and this pile represents blocks that were never used.
Disturbance observed consist of multiple layers of fill from overbank deposits and
excavation associated with widening of the stream channel on the west bank of the
creek. This disturbance was found to reach 90 cm below the existing ground
surface. Shovel Test 1 was dug on the west bank of the creek in disturbed fill. This
soil was probably overbank or flood deposited, as it was very inconsistent in color
and consistency. Shovel Test 3 was dug on the east bank of the creek and also
consisted of disturbed fill. Neither area appeared to have intact soils, and there
was a significant amount of dredge spoil on top of the overbank/flood deposit.
These soils represent significant disturbance to the two banks of the creek. The
rest of the soils changed with distance from the creek and graded from fine sandy
loam to loam (Shovel Test 4), clay loam (Shovel Test 5), and sandy clay loam
(Shovel Test 6).

RECOMMENDATIONS
No evidence of a prehistoric or historic site was found as a result of this
survey, and it is recommended that construction be allowed to proceed as planned.
Since the fenced boundary of the cemetery is at least 200 feet from the proposed
water line, scraping for unmarked graves is not necessary. Should evidence of an
archaeological site be encountered during the construction, all work must stop until
the THC can evaluate the situation. Also, if new areas are added, the THC must be
notified in case additional archaeological survey is needed. This survey was
conducted in accordance with the Minimum Survey Standards as outlined by the
THC.
