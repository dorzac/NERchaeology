ABSTRACT
Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants (DETAC) conducted a cultural resource
management survey for the City of Tyler, Texas of approximately 55.8 hectares (137.9
acres) in Forest Stewardship Areas 3 and 5 around Lake Tyler East. Timber will be thinned
in the areas and hauled off the property. The pedestrian survey was conducted with a
combination of visual examination and shovel testing in areas delineated by the Texas
Historic Commission (THC). A total of 272 shovel tests were excavated across upland
ridges over five days. No new archaeological sites were recorded, but three isolated finds
were documented. Texas Antiquities Permit #6430 was obtained for this project, and all
terms of the permit were carried out pursuant of the Texas Antiquities Code. All three
artifacts were curated at the Anthropology Laboratory at Stephen F. Austin State University
in Nacogdoches, Texas. DETAC requests concurrence with a determination of “no effect”
to properties listed or eligible to the National Register of Historic Places for the proposed
timber thinning operations. If any artifacts, dark greasy soils, or human bones are
uncovered during the timber thinning, then all work will stop in the immediate area and
both DETAC and the THC will be notified immediately.

INTRODUCTION
In January 2013 DETAC conducted a cultural resources survey for the City of
Tyler, Texas of select tracts in Forest Stewardship Area 3 (FSA 3) and Forest Stewardship
Area 5 (FSA 5) around Lake Tyler East (Figure 1). The survey was conducted upon
request of the City of Tyler for timber thinning operations in both areas. No timber
thinning will be conducted within 30 meters (m) (100 feet (ft) of the lake shore. The
Texas Historical Commission (THC) outlined eight areas for an archaeological pedestrian
survey. Texas Antiquities Permit #6430 was obtained for this project, and all terms of the
permit were carried out pursuant of the Texas Antiquities Code.
Both Forest Stewardship Areas contained four tracts selected for survey by the
THC (Martin 2012). These tracts included ridge summits and shoulders overlooking the
lake. The archaeological survey included shovel testing in the selected tracts and a visual
examination of the floodplain where timber thinning will be more than 30 m (100 ft) from
the lake shore. Shovel testing and visual examination did not record any archaeological
sites in the project area, but cultural material was found in FSA 3 Tract 1. The southern
limit of FSA 3 Tract 1 includes an abandoned road with several scattered modern trash
piles. Shovel testing found three isolated finds (IF-1, IF-2, and IF-3). IF-1 is a single
lithic flake found near the southwest corner of the tract. IF-2 is a Carrolton dart point and
IF-3 is a ground stone; both IF-2 and IF-3 were found along the southern ridge shoulder of
FSA 3 Tract 1. Shovel testing around all three finds were negative. No cultural material
was found in FSA 3 Tracts 2, 3, 4 or in the FSA 5 Tracts 1, 2, 3, or 4. Artifacts were
curated at the Archaeological Laboratory at Stephen F. Austin State University.
The archaeological survey did not record any archaeological sites. The recovered
cultural material does not suggest a substantial prehistoric or historic occupation or use of
the surveyed tracts. No further archaeological work is recommended for the proposed
timber thinning in FSA 3 or FSA 5. DETAC requests concurrence with a determination of
“no effect” to properties listed or eligible to the National Register of Historic Places for the
proposed timber thinning operations in FSA 3 and FSA 5.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Smith County is within the Pine Woods subdivision of the East Texas Timber Belt
of the Gulf Coastal Plain Physiographic Province of North America and the Austoriparian
Biotic Province of Texas. The Gulf Coastal Plain Province is characterized by low
topographic relief, extensive marshy tracts, altitudes below 152 m (500 ft), and
sedimentary geologic formations (Atwood 1940; Bureau of Economic Geology [BEG]
1965). The Austoriparian Biotic Province is characterized by pine and pine-oak forests on
the uplands and by the abundant oak, elm and ash hardwoods in the lowlands (Blair 1950).
The Pine Woods subdivision is the dissected sandy forestlands with rolling relief whose
western boundary is approximately the 109 cm (43 in) rainfall line (Chambers 1948). The
East Texas Timber Belt geographic region supports abundant pine and oak woodlands and
is characterized by a gently rolling to level sandy terrain, annual rainfall in excess of 102
centimeters (cm) (40 inches (in)) and an average growing season of over 240 days (Bray
1904). Vegetation in the Pine Woods subdivision includes a variety of pine, maple, and
oak trees with a wide variety of shrubs to include beauty berry, yaupon, farkle berry, and
sumac.

The woody vine understory includes muscadine grape, poison ivy, Virginia

creeper, and saw greenbrier.

Geology
The Gulf Coastal Plain was an elevated sea bottom (Hunt 1974) formed during the
Cenozoic Era when cycles of transgression and regression of the ancestral Gulf of Mexico
deposited sands, shales, clays and marls in sedimentary geologic formations.
Transgressive deposits are generally clay and silty deposits making them more resistant to
erosion. Regressive deposits are generally silty and sandy and less resistant to erosion.
Resistant strata form escarpments or cuestas with rolling hills and prairies (Fisher 1965).
The streams that flow through these hills and prairies typically had floodplains 1.6 to 16.1
kilometers (km) (1 to 10 miles (mi)) wide. These floodplains generally occurred 30.5 to
45.7-meters (100 to 150-feet) below the regular elevation of the land creating narrower
floodplains where streams cut through the cuestas (BEG 1967, 1977; Fenneman 1938).
The geologic units in the survey areas are exclusively Eocene age Queen City Sand
formation on ridge summits and back slopes with Quaternary Alluvium in the floodplain
3

(BEG 1967). Queen City formation is a regressive deposit with thin beds of clay, sandy
clay, and ironstone concretions that weathers grayish, orange and pink; ferruginous ledges
and rubble are common. The Quaternary alluvium is significantly younger and, because of
its location on the landscape, has the only potential for containing deeply buried
archaeological sites in colluvial deposited material from the adjacent slopes. Unfortunately,
the mapped Quaternary Alluvium is underwater. Refining how local geology affects the
proposed development relies on the information derived from the Web Soil Survey (NRCS
2012).

Soils
Soils within the project area vary according to the underlying geology and position
on the landscape. The ridge summits are all Bowie fine sandy loam (BoB) and Lilbert
loamy fine sand (LtC) with isolated areas of Briley loamy fine sand (ByC), Cuthbert fine
sandy loam (CuC) and Kirvin very fine sandy loam (KfC).

Backslopes are almost

exclusively Cuthbert fine sandy loam (CfE) which extends to the lake shore.

The

floodplains that are not inundated with water are described as Mantachie loam (Ma),
frequently flooded. According to the soil survey (NRCS 2012), Bowie and Cuthbert series
have A and E horizons of fine sandy loam between 8 and 25 cm (4 and 10 in) over a Bt
horizon of sandy clay loam. Briley and Lilbert series have A and E horizons of loamy fine
sand 60 cm (24 in) deep over a Bt horizon of sandy clay loam. Mantachie loam has an A
horizon of loam and fine sandy loam over a weak B horizon of gley colored loam. Gley
color soils are indicative of long term saturation. No buried soils were noted in the
Mantachie series description.

CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY
The project area is in the Northeast Texas Archaeological Region (Kenmotsu and
Perttula 1993). The Cultural Chronology is divided into Paleo-Indian, Archaic, Early
Ceramic, Late Prehistoric, and Historic periods. Each period was delineated by a change in
environment, technology, and/or population requiring adaptations to meet varying
circumstances. Each period is described in reference to the cultural phases within the
period, settlement patterns, subsistence, and artifacts associated with the period.

Paleo-Indian Period
The Paleo-Indian period (prior to 6000 B.C.) is the earliest generally accepted
cultural period in the New World and includes populations that inhabited North America
from the Late Pleistocene to the early Holocene. The use of non-local materials and
recycling lead Story and others (1990) to suggest this population was organized into small,
mobile bands of hunters and gatherers that consumed a variety of plants and animals.
Overall, tool types are generally carefully fashioned bifacial and unifacial tools. PaleoIndian sites are typified by scattered Clovis, Scottsbluff, Dalton, San Patrice, and
Plainview projectile points. These sites are rare in the region with only one or two
documented components per county in the area. Paleo-Indian artifacts recovered in the
region suggested that early occupations were principally distributed in the valleys of major
stream basins (Perttula 1995). Waters (1992:151) suggests sites from the Paleo-Indian
period are less frequent in active floodplains because of the changes in the landscape over
the last 8000 years.

Archaic
The Archaic (6000-200 B.C.) refers to hunter-gatherers who implemented more
regionally specialized approaches toward exploiting their environment. The Archaic period
is represented by three divisions: the Early, Middle, and Late Archaic during which tool
technology progressed from the large points that typify the Paleo-Indian period to the use of
sand and grog tempered ceramics and the bow and arrow in the Early Ceramic and Late
Prehistoric. The Archaic, in general, represents a shift in subsistence as Late Archaic sites
are more abundant than Early Archaic sites as populations shifted from major streams to
5

minor streams and natural springs (Story et al. 1990). This increase in site count and
distribution throughout the Archaic suggests the successful adaptation to the environment
lasting until the development of pottery and/or the development of the bow and arrow.
Features found on sites in the Archaic include stone-lined hearths, baking pits, milling
implements, and polished stones that serve as indicators of new technologies (Story et al.
1990:213). Cemeteries date to the Archaic period as well (Story et al. 1990) and become an
integral part of the late Archaic. When compared to Paleo-Indian artifacts, Archaic lithic
assemblages are more functionally varied; however, tool types are generally less well made
and of increasingly more local materials than the Paleo-Indian period and earlier Archaic
divisions. Projectile point types associated with the Archaic period include earlier expanded
stem (e.g., Keithville, Palmer, Kirk and Cossatot), corner-notched, and side notched points
(e.g., Big Sandy, Calf Creek , Johnson, Carrollton, and Morrill) followed by stemed points
(e.g., Lang, Castroville, Palmillas, Ellis, Edgewood, and Yarbrough) (Story et al. 1990).

Woodland Period
The Woodland period (200 B.C.-A.D. 800) period (Perttula 2004:9), first
introduced as the Early Ceramic (Story et al. 1990:293), represented an increasing
utilization of the environment and technological changes. A number of characteristic
innovations appear during the Woodland period along with regional differences within the
same environment. In particular, there is a greater reliance on cultigens along with larger
and more prolonged occupations at specific locales.

The technological innovation

appearing during the Early Ceramic period was the widespread production of pottery and
the introduction of the bow and arrow very late in the period (Story et al. 1990; Thurmond
1990). Pottery was introduced from the Lower Mississippi Valley as the Fourche Maline
culture in northeast Texas. Plainware ceramics north of the Sabine River are clay/grog or
bone temper (Williams Plain; however, Marksville Stamped, Marksville Incised, Tchefuncte
Stamped, Troyville Stamped, and Chrupa Incised) (Story et al. 1990; Thurmond 1988; Cliff
and Peter 1994:23). South of the Sabine River ceramics are mostly plain sandy paste Mossy
Grove varieties (Story 1990, Ricklis 2004:189). Recently, Black and Story (2003) described
the Mill Creek culture along the Upper Sabine River basin with pottery similar to Williams
Plain but with incised lines and punctations. Gary and Kent projectile points are common
6

all three cultures, but corner-notched arrow points are common north of the Sabine River
(Thurmond 1990) while stemmed arrow points are common to the south (Perttula
2004:376). Populations throughout the region attempted to utilize plant resources along
valley margins as sites were located along increasingly larger landforms and covered larger
areas (Corbin 1998:115).

Late Prehistoric Period
In the Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 800-1680) Smith County was in the Caddoan
cultural area. The Caddo culture was an indigenous development strongly influenced by the
Mississippian tradition of the Lower Mississippi Valley (Story et al. 1990:323; Wycoff
1971). Caddo subsistence and social organization differed markedly from the Woodland
period as horticulture supplemented hunting and gathering followed by a diet dominated by
maize, beans, and squash. Increasingly larger aggregates of people became sedentary and
constructed villages with public ceremonial areas. A stratified social structure developed
corresponding to the chiefdom level as first defined by Service (1962, 1975). Extensive
commercial networks were also established with hamlets and farmsteads surrounding a
larger community mound center.

Settlements were mainly distributed on elevated

landforms adjacent to major streams, as well as along minor tributaries and spring-fed
branches. The Late Prehistoric Period is divided into Formative, Early, Middle, and Late
Caddoan phases. The phases indicate changes in socio-political, habitation, and material
culture with increasingly smaller regional differences. Overall, the Late Prehistoric Period
to the north is typified by a variety of arrowpoints, ground stone artifacts, and a variety of
ceramic vessel types. Formative and Early Caddo sites include maize, and populations lived
in semi-permanent hamlets and farmsteads (Perttula 1986:54-55). Middle Caddo sites
include increased use of planted crops, increasingly larger settlements, more and larger
mounds sites, and evidence of more social and political organization. The Late Caddo
period has the greatest regional and temporal variation which is divided into archaeological
phases, e.g, the earlier Whelan phase (ca. A.D. 1350-1450) is replaced by the later Titus
phase (ca A.D. 1450-1650) along the upper Cypress Creek basin and the Frankston phase
(ca. A.D. 1400-1650) along the Neches and Angelina River basins (Thurmond 1990;
Perttula 2004).

Historic
Although the Spanish had a presence in east Texas since the late seventeenth
century, the area that would become Smith was not inhabited by Anglo settlers until
American traders moved into the Neches Saline area in the late 1820’s. The area was not
heavily settled until the Cherokee were removed in 1839. Smith County was officially
formed on 11 April 1846 with Tyler as the County Seat. Cotton was the primary trade
commodity, but corn, fruit, and vegetables sustained the growing population. Throughout
the 1850’s the county continued to grow as more farmers planted cotton with slave labor.
The county did have a diverse economy with sawmills, gristmills, and three distilleries.
Smith County voted for secession and hosted two Confederate Camps (Camp Clough and
Camp Ford) north and east of Tyler respectively along with a transportation depot,
ordinance plant, and stockade. Race relations were strained in Smith County into the 1870’s
as the black population was constantly harassed.

The International & Great Northern

Railway reached Tyler in 1874. Three years later 33 km (21 mi) of railway connected towns
across the county. Cotton sales increased dramatically and livestock sales followed. Tyler
grew with new industries and colleges over the next 20 years. Agriculture across the county
expanded to include the sale of what had been subsistence vegetables and fruits. However,
cotton still dominated the market and with the Great Depression and boll weevil infestations
many farmers suffered in the 1930’s. After the depression, industry steadily grew as oil
exploration, a renewed military industry (with WWII), and the lumber industry returned
Smith County to prosperity (McCroskey 2012).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
The archaeological regional overview documents of primary importance are D.A.
Story's (1990) and J.A. Guy's (1990) discussions of the Gulf Coastal Plain. Additionally,
the Texas Historical Commission (THC), Department of Antiquities Protection developed a
document for the east Texas portion of the Texas State Plan (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993).
This THC document included several historic contexts each of which dealt with a particular
facet of northeast Texas prehistory. This state plan synthesized the state of archaeological
research in the region and identified problems and objectives to be addressed in future
research and cultural resources management.

Several weak areas in archaeological

knowledge of the region were identified in these recent studies. Chronology, settlement
patterns, subsistence, and historic continuities were some of the general research directions
that all of these recent syntheses emphasized as important for developing future
archaeological research designs. More recently, Perttula (2004:370-408) includes the most
up to date descriptions of the region for the Caddo Cultural Area which extends from the
Red River to Angelina County in Texas.
Large-scale investigations including research within specific drainage systems and
extensive excavations on large sites were conducted across the region providing most of the
prehistoric and historic cultural information. Substantial investigations began in the 1930s
with the University of Texas surveys along major stream valleys. Later, large survey areas
included surveys and site excavations for reservoirs (e.g., Story 1965; Jelks 1958; and
Anderson 1971). These and other large area surveys over the next forty years document a
majority of the archaeological sites recorded and provide the basis for predicting site
locations across the landscape. The abundance of site data lead to studies of individual
basins (e.g., Thurmond’s 1990 study of the Cypress Creek basin) and excavations of specific
sites (e.g., Thom’s 2004 excavations at Camp Ford). Small-scale investigations include
numerous well and pipelines for utilities, private interests and TxDot scattered across the
county.
The Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2013) was consulted for the locations
of known archaeological sites, National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) properties,
and State Archaeological Landmarks (SAL) within 1.6 km (1 mi) of the project areas. The
Site Atlas shows seven archaeological investigations and six archaeological sites within
9

one mile of the survey areas (Appendix B). The previous investigations include four well
pad surveys by Archeological and Environmental Consultants (AEC), a powerline rightof-way survey by Espey, Huston & Associates (Nash et al. 1993), and a pipeline survey
by WAPORA (1983).
The well pad surveys by Perttula and Nelson were conducted for natural gas well
locations on elevated landforms overlooking Lake Tyler East on property owned by the
City of Tyler. The surveys closest to FSA 3 Tract 1 are for the Burkett Gas Unit Well #2
(Perttula and Nelson 2005a) and the D and E pads (Perttula and Nelson 2005b). A single
prehistoric flake was found but no archaeological sites were recorded and no further work
was required. The survey closest to FSA 3 Tract 2 was for the B.J. Wilson Gas unit Well
No.1 well location and access road (Perttula and Nelson 2005c); no cultural resources
were found and no further work was requested.
AEC conducted three surveys south of FSA 3 Tract 1 on the south side of the
Omen Road Bay (Perttula and Nelson 2005b; 2005d; and 2005e). These surveys were
successful in documenting four sites (4SM209, 41SM332, 41SM333, and 41SM346) on
isolated ridge summits overlooking the lake. Site 41SM209 was recorded as a multicomponent site with lithic debris and Caddoan ceramic sherds, burned clay, lithic, dart
point, ground stone, charcoal/nutshell found on the lake shore and in 29 of 34 shovel tests
on the ridge summit; avoidance was recommended.

Sites 41SM332, 41SM333 and

41SM346 were recorded as prehistoric lithic scatters with artifacts found in eight of 15
tests on 41SM332, artifacts found in six of six tests on 41SM333, and artifacts found in
seven of 12 tests on 41SM346. AEC recommended project completion as none of the
sites was considered eligible for inclusion to the NRHP or listing as a SAL.
AEC conducted a survey for the McDonald Gas Unit Well No. 1 located on a
peninsula roughly 1.5 km (1 mile) southeast of FSA 5 (Perttula and Nelson 2005f). The
survey documented 41SM215 as an Archaic lithic scatter with dart points and a scraper
along with lithic debris in 14 of 31 shovel tests. AEC recommended project completion as
the site was considered eligible for inclusion to the NRHP or listing as a SAL.
Other surveys within 1.6 km (1 mi) of the project area include a survey by Nash
and others (1993) for approximately 67.1 km (41.7 mi) of a power line right-of-way
through Anderson, Cherokee, Henderson, Rusk, and Smith counties; seven sites were
10

recorded but none within 1.6 km (1 mi) of the current project area. The WAPORA (1983)
survey was for a United Gas Pipeline winding east of FSA 3 Tracts 2, and 4; no cultural
resources were documented during the survey. Other sites within 1.6 km (1 mi) of FSA 3
include 41SM214, 41SM167, and 41SM166. Unfortunately, no detailed information was
available on the site atlas.
The results of the previous investigations shows most of the documented
archaeological work on Lake Tyler East was done near the south east portion of the lake.
Archaeological sites were documented along the lake’s lower two-thirds only. The work
by AEC shows prehistoric sites are most likely found on prominent landforms overlooking
the lake. Artifacts can be recovered from the surface along the shore line and in shovel
tests between the surface and the Bt horizon. Isolated finds (e.g., Perttula and Nelson
2005a) were not recorded as sites. The only site that was recommended for avoidance and
further work was the multi-component site with Caddoan ceramics (Perttula and Nelson
2005b). The three lithic scatters and one Archaic site were not avoided (Perttula and
Nelson 2005b; 2005d; 2005e, and 2005f).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
DETAC performed these investigations in accordance with the procedural rules of
the Texas Antiquities Code, the CTA Guidelines for Professional Performance (2005a),
and the ethical codes of conduct described by the Texas Archaeological Society and the
Register of Professional Archaeologists. The Research Design and Methodology for the
archaeological survey is the result of a review of the City of Tyler’s’ proposed timber
thinning conducted by the Texas Historical Commission (THC). The letter from the THC
outlined eight tracts; four tracts in FSA 3 and four tracts in FSA 5 that were to be surveyed
for cultural resources (Martin 2012). No new roads will be constructed, but logging
vehicles and equipment will move freely among remaining trees disturbing the ground
surface. No thinning will be conducted within 30 m (100 ft) of the lake shore. Thinning
areas were marked with orange flagging tape prior to the archaeological survey by the
logging contractor.
Research began with a literature review for material pertinent to the project area.
The literature review included: reading archaeological and historical publications on the
Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2013); reviewing any information concerning
historical, geomorphological, and archaeological information at the Stephen F. Austin
State University Library in Nacogdoches, Texas; and obtaining digital data from the Texas
Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS 2012).
To aid in the survey, high and low probability areas were determined by
combining the previous site information with topographic and soils data.

Previous

investigations in the area documented archaeological sites from the Archaic and Late
prehistoric periods on prominent landforms overlooking the lake.

Artifacts can be

recovered from the surface along the shore line and in shovel tests between the surface and
the Bt horizon. Most of the sites were lithic scatters with several artifacts recovered in
over half of the excavated shovel tests in a site area. Based on this information, high
probability areas were prominent landforms overlooking the lake. Expected sites should
contain numerous artifacts in several shovel tests.
The pedestrian survey was conducted using a visual assessment and shovel testing in
the areas outlined by the THC (Martin 2012; Martin 2013 personal communication). The
visual assessment was a continuous effort between shovel tests.
12

Overturned trees,

burrowing animal disturbances, lake shores, and unimproved roads were examined for
artifacts on the surface.

Shovel tests were excavated at 30 m (100 ft) intervals or less in

high probability areas and in accordance with the THC’s guidelines for cultural resources
surveys. Upon finding an artifact, archaeologists excavated shovel tests at 10 m (33 ft)
intervals in the cardinal directions until two consecutive negative shovel tests or the
landform (e.g., steep slope) determined the site boundary. Shovel tests were approximately
30 cm (12 in) in square. Shovel testing included excavating in 10 cm (4 in) increments to
the Bt horizon or to 90+ cm. All excavated matrix was screened through 0.64 cm (0.25 in)
hardwire cloth. The depth, soil texture, color, and any artifacts from each shovel test were
recorded as part of a GPS position with 1 to 3 m (3 to 10 ft) accuracy.
DETAC prepared all artifacts, analysis, maps, and field notes along with
photographs for curation at the Stephen F. Austin State University Anthropology
Laboratory. Copies of the draft report were provided to the THC for review following
CTA Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports (2005b). Upon completion
of consultation, a final report was prepared incorporating any comments provided by the
THC. Final digital and hard copies of the report will be provided to the THC for inclusion
in the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas.

RESULTS
Field Investigations were conducted between 28 January and 1 February 2013.
Shovel testing and visual examination of the project area included walking transects
across the property, making notes on surface disturbance, and shovel testing at low and
high probability intervals. The areas selected by the THC for survey were divided into
two areas (Forest Stewardship Area 3 and Forest Stewardship Area 5) with individual
tracts. Topography, vegetation, soils, and pedestrian survey results are described for each
tract.

Forest Stewardship Area 3 (FSA 3)
FSA 3 is on the east side of Lake Tyler East near the south end of the lake. A total
of four tracts (1,2,3, and 4) were surveyed in FSA 3. Sweeny road divides Tracts 1 and 2.
Tracts 3 and 4 are on the summit of upland ridges overlooking the inundated floodplain of
an unnamed tributary to the lake.

Tract 1
Tract 1 included 11.5 ha. (28.5 ac) along the summit and southern shoulder of the
Twin Bay Peninsula west of Swinney Road. The western and southern boundaries of the
ridge backslopes while the northern boundaries was the survey for the Burkett Gas Unit
Well #2 (Perttula and Nelson 2005a) and the D and E pads (Perttula and Nelson 2005b).
Vegetation on the ridge summit included some areas of planted pine trees with a
light understory of various bushes and briars, and other areas of mixed hardwood and pine
trees with a moderate understory of various bushes and shrubs. Vegetation along the lake
shore was tall grass with scattered small sandy beach areas less than 3 m (10 ft) wide and
10 m (33 ft) long. Soils on the ridge summit were Bowie fine sandy loam with a small
area of Lilbert loamy fine sand near the east end of the tract. Backslope soils were
Cuthbert fine sandy loam.
The visual inspection found agricultural contour terracing berms on the ridge

shoulder at the southern limit of the survey area (Figure 2). The terracing slowed erosion,
but several areas along the shoulder were eroded leaving shallow soils only 20 cm (8 in)

trash piles were observed along the abandoned road with modern debris including
televisions and baby formula cans (Figure 3).
A total of 82 shovel tests (1-82) were excavated across the ridge summit and
shoulder (Figure 2 and Appendix A). Shovel tests on the ridge summit were excavated at
50 m (164 ft) intervals while tests were excavated at 30 m (100 ft) intervals or less along
the ridge shoulder for an average of three shovel tests for every acre. Soils were light
brown fine sandy loam 20 to 90 cm (8 to 36 in) deep over a yellow or red clay Bt horizon.
Three isolated finds were found in shovel tests. A proximal fragment of a chert thinning
flake was found in ST 19 (Level 2) near the southwest corner of the survey area; no other
artifacts were found in the ten additional tests in the area. Shovel tests near ST 19 ranged
from 20 to 50 cm deep. The second isolated find was a dart point found in ST 29 (Level
4). The point is most like a Carrolton but is also similar to an Elam as described by
Turner, Hester, and McReynolds (2011:71, 92) dating to the Middle Archaic (Turner and
Hester 1985:75). Excavation of an additional 13 shovel tests in the area recovered a
ground stone artifact ST 32 (Level 5). No other artifacts were found in the tract.

Tract 2
Tract 2 included 15.1 ha. (37.4 ac) along the summit and northern shoulder of the
Twin Bay Peninsula east of Swinney Road and a hill summit in the northeast corner. The
southern boundary was the survey for the B.J. Wilson Gas unit Well No.1 well location
and access road (Perttula and Nelson 2005c); the eastern boundary was a pipeline right-ofway, while the northern boundary was the ridge backslopes.
Vegetation on the ridge summit was planted pine trees with a moderate understory
of various bushes and briars while vegetation on the ridge shoulders was mixed hardwood
and pine trees with a moderate understory of various bushes and shrubs. Soils on the ridge

summit are Bowie fine sandy loam with a small area of Lilbert loamy fine sand near the
west end of the tract and ByC on the hill summit. Backslope soils are Cuthbert fine sandy
loam.
The visual inspection found agricultural terracing on the ridge shoulders and back
slopes along with scattered modern trash piles near the southern border of the survey area.
Inspection of the floodplain between Tracts 2 and 3 found a single stream channel roughly
2 m (6 ft) wide with shallow banks. Several overflow channels were obvious across the
floodplain. No large elevated areas were visible in the dense understory.
A total of 65 shovel tests (83-148) were excavated across the ridge summit and
shoulder (Figure 4 and Appendix A) for an average of two shovel tests for every acre.
The seven shovel tests on the hill summit found reddish brown gravelly sandy loam 40 to
90 cm (16 to 36 in) deep. No shovel tests were excavated on the steep slope and few tests
were excavated along a draw west of the hill. Shovel tests across the broader ridge
summit found various shades of yellowish and reddish brown sandy loam approximately
60 cm (24 in) deep over a Bt horizon of reddish or yellowish sandy clay (Figure 5). More
tests were excavated along prominent landforms overlooking the North Bridge Cove.
These tests were generally deeper light brown sandy loam. No cultural material was
found in the shovel testing effort of Tract 2.

Tract 3
Tract 3 was a narrow 1.1 ha. (2.7 ac) area along the summit of an upland ridge.
The southern boundary was a property line and the north, west, and eastern boundaries
were the ridge backslopes. Vegetation was mixed hardwood trees with a light understory
of various bushes. Soils on the ridge summit were Bowie fine sandy loam and the
backslope soils are Cuthbert fine sandy loam. A total of 11 shovel tests (149-158) were
excavated on the ridge shoulder and summit (Figure 6 and Appendix A) for an average of
five shovel tests for every acre. Shovel tests on the east side of the area found light brown
sandy loam roughly 70 cm (28 in) deep. Shovel tests on the west side of the area found
yellowish brown sandy loam approximately 50 cm (20 in) deep. Many of the tests did not
find a clear Bt horizon. No cultural material was found in the shovel testing effort.

Inspection of the floodplain north of Tract 3 found inundation from the lake
covering most of the surface. The stream channel was roughly 1.5 m (5.0 ft) wide with
shallow banks (Figure 5). Several overflow channels were noticed across the floodplain
floor.

Vegetation was mature pine and hardwood trees with a dense understory.

Inspection of the floodplain between Tracts 3 and 4 found a similar kind of stream channel
and overflow channels, but vegetation was mature pine and hardwood trees with a light
understory. Elevated landforms in the floodplain were very narrow.

Tract 4
Tract 4 was a 2.4 ha. (6.0 ac) area along the summit of an upland ridge. There
were two prominent ridge shoulders separated by a shallow basin. The southern boundary
was a property line, the eastern boundary was a pipeline, while the north and west
boundaries were the ridge backslopes. Vegetation was planted pine trees with a light to
moderate understory of bushes and briars. Soils on the ridge summit were Bowie fine
sandy loam with a small area of Kirvin very fine sandy loam in the southeast corner of the
tract. Backlsope soils were Cuthbert fine sandy loam. The visual inspection found
agricultural terracing on the ridge shoulders and back slopes. A total of 15 shovel tests
(159-173) were excavated on the ridge shoulder and summit (Figure 6 and Appendix A)
for an average of three shovel tests for every acre. Shovel testing focused on the two
prominent landforms; fewer tests were excavated in the basin area. Shovel tests on the
ridge summit found light brown sandy loam roughly 60 cm (24 in) deep while tests along
the shoulder and near the shallow basin found yellowish brown sandy loam roughly 50 cm
(20 in) deep. Gravels were noted in the tests along the pipeline.

Forest Stewardship Area 5 (FSA 5)
FSA 5 was on the west side of Lake Tyler East near the Hwy 64 bridge. A total of
four tracts (1, 2, 3, and 4) were surveyed in FSA 5. The closest road was Big Oak Bay
Road, west of the tracts. The only access was along 4-wheeler trails across the property.
The drainages separating the Tracts 1, 2, and 3 were narrow “V” shaped draws with no
developed floodplain. Inspection of the lake shore found the areas dominated by tall grass
with few exposed sandy swash zones. No artifacts were found along the lake shore. The
22

floodplain between Tracts 3 and 4 was wide, but inundated leaving little lake shore along
the toe slopes. No cultural material was found in the area and there was no evidence of
mounds or other cultural features.

Tract 1
Tract 1 included 5.9 ha. (14.6 ac) on the summit and backslope of an upland ridge.
West and north boundaries were private property. Southern and eastern boundaries were
steep slopes overlooking the lake shore.

There were no previous investigations or

recorded archaeological sites on or adjacent to the tract.
Vegetation on the ridge summit was mature pine trees with a light understory of
various bushes. The remainder of the tract was in mixed pine and hardwood trees with a
light to moderate understory of various bushes and shrubs. Soils on the ridge summit
were Cuthbert and Redsprings soils with Cuthbert fine sandy loam on the backslope.
The visual inspection found the summit was highly disturbed.

There is a

powerline right-of-way and several leveled areas with push piles scattered across the ridge
summit. The slopes were steep with terracing near the summit and outcrops of bedrock in
the mid-slope.

The edge of the survey area was along a bench with a steep slope

overlooking a narrow shore line. Shovel tests were excavated on the summit and low on
the slopes along the bench.
A total of 14 shovel tests (174-187) were excavated at 30 m (100 ft) intervals in
areas with slope less than 15% (Figure 7 and Appendix A) for an average of one shovel
tests for every acre. Shovel tests on the ridge summit found reddish brown gravelly sandy
loam only 10 cm (4 in) deep over a Bt horizon or bedrock. Shovel tests along the benches
found light brown to brown gravelly sandy loam over a Bt horizon. No cultural material
was found in the shovel testing effort.

Tract 2
Tract 2 included 9.5 ha. (23.5 ac) area along the summit and shoulder of an upland
ridge and a peninsula. The western boundary was private property while the eastern,
northern, and southern boundaries were steep slopes overlooking the lake shore except

along the peninsula. There are no previous investigations or recorded archaeological sites
on or adjacent to the tract.
Vegetation in the tract was mixed mature hardwood and pine trees with a light to
moderate understory.

Soils on the ridge summit were Lilbert loamy fine sand with

Cuthbert fine sandy loam on the backlsopes and on the peninsula.
The visual inspection found agricultural terracing on the ridge shoulders and
slopes. Two 4-wheeler trails crossed the tract from north to south following the ridge
summit and shoulder; no trails lead to the peninsula. Most of the toe slope was thick in
grass along the lake shore with scattered exposed areas; no artifacts were found along the
lake shore.
A total of 45 shovel tests (188-233) were excavated on the ridge summit, ridge
shoulder and peninsula (Figure 7 and Appendix A) for an average of two shovel tests for
every acre. Shovel testing focused on prominent benches along the ridge shoulder and on
the peninsula. The slope to the peninsula was gradual and uniform. Additional tests were
excavated on an isolated knoll northwest of the peninsula. Shovel tests on the ridge
summit found light brown to yellowish brown sandy loam roughly 80 cm (32 in) deep
with more gravel in the matrix further south in the Tract. Shovel tests along the shoulder
were similar to the ridge summit with light brown to yellowish brown sandy loam with
more gravel in the matrix further south. Two tests were excavated on the knoll; both were
more than 90 cm (36 in) deep in light brown sandy loam. Five tests were excavated on the
peninsula. The tests found light brown sandy loam in excess of 90 cm (36 in) deep. No
cultural material was found in the shovel testing effort of Tract 2.

Tract 3
Tract 3 included 8.6 ha. (21.3 ac) along the summit and shoulder of an upland
ridge bound by a private property to the north and steep slopes to the west, east, and south.
There were no previous investigations or recorded archaeological sites on or adjacent to
the tract.
Vegetation in the tract was mixed mature hardwood and pine trees with a light to
moderate understory. Soils on the ridge summit are Kirvin very fine sandy loam with
Cuthbert fine sandy loam on the backslopes.

The visual inspection found agricultural terracing on the ridge shoulders and back
slopes along with two narrow benches along the southern slope. Most of the area was
steeply sloped limiting the areas where shovel testing was practical. The floodplain was
thick in grass along the lake shore.
A total of 34 shovel tests (234-268) were excavated across the ridge summit,
shoulder, and benches (Figure 9 and Appendix A) for an average of two shovel tests for
every acre. Shovel tests on the ridge summit found light brow sandy loam 60 cm (24 in)
deep over a distinct Bt sandy clay horizon. Shovel tests on the shoulder and prominent
landforms overlooking the lake found 70 cm (28 in) of light brown sandy loam. Shovel
tests along the benches found 60 cm (24 in) of light reddish brown sandy loam. No
cultural material was found in the shovel testing effort.

Tract 4
Tract 4 was a narrow 1.5 ha. (3.7 ac) area with portions of two isolated ridges
between the lake on the north and private property on the west, south, and east. There are
no previous investigations or recorded archaeological sites on or adjacent to the tract. The
drainage between the ridges was narrow “V” shape with no floodplain. Vegetation was
mixed hardwood trees with a light understory of various bushes. Soils on the ridge
summit were Lilbert loamy fine sand and the backlsope soils were Cuthbert fine sandy
loam. The lake shore along the tract was thick in grass. No cultural material was found in
an inspection of the lake shore. A total of six shovel tests (269-274) were excavated on
the ridge summits (Figure 8 and Appendix A) for an average of two shovel tests for every
acre. Shovel tests on the hill summit found reddish brown sandy loam 80 cm (32 in) deep
on the eastern ridge and yellowish brown sandy loam 50 cm (20 in) deep on the western
ridge. No cultural material was found in the shovel testing effort.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The City of Tyler is thinning timber in Forest Stewardship Areas (FSA) 3 and 5
around Lake Tyler East in Smith County, Texas. The Texas Historical Commission
outlined eight tracts (four in each FSA) for an archaeological pedestrian survey. DETAC
acquired Texas Antiquities Permit #6430 and all terms of the permit were carried out
pursuant of the Texas Antiquities Code.
These tracts included ridge summits and shoulders overlooking the lake. The
archaeological survey included shovel testing in the selected tracts and a visual
examination of the floodplain. All timber thinning will be more than 30 m (100 ft) from
the lake shore. Shovel testing and visual examination did not record any archaeological
sites in the project area, but cultural material was found in FSA 3 Tract 1. The southern
limit of FSA 3 Tract 1 includes an abandoned road with several scattered modern trash
piles. Shovel testing found three isolated finds (IF-1, IF-2, and IF-3). IF-1 is a single
lithic flake found near the southwest corner of the tract. IF-2 is a Carrolton dart point and
IF-3 is a ground stone; both found along the southern ridge shoulder of FSA 3 Tract 1.
Shovel testing around all three finds were negative.

Artifacts were curated at the

Archaeological Laboratory at Stephen F. Austin State University. No cultural material
was found in FSA 3 Tracts 2, 3, 4 or in the FSA 5 Tracts 1, 2, 3, or 4.
The archaeological survey did not record any archaeological sites. The recovered
isolated finds do not suggest a substantial prehistoric or historic occupation or use of the
surveyed tracts. No further archaeological work is recommended for the proposed timber
thinning in FSA 3 or FSA 5. DETAC requests concurrence with a determination of “no
effect” to properties listed or eligible to the National Register of Historic Places for the
proposed timber thinning operations in FSA 3 and FSA 5. If any artifacts, bones, or dark
greasy soils are found, then work should stop in the immediate area and both the Texas
Historic Commission and DETAC should be contacted immediately.
