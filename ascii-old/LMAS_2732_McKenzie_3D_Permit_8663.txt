awson Geophysical proposes to conduct a 3-D seismic survey within University
lands. This non-invasive exploration involves placing geophones along receiver
lines by crews either walking or using ATVs. Buggy vibroseis vehicles will travel along source
lines and are smaller than the usual vibroseis trucks. The vehicle will work within an area of
potential effect that is no more than 18 ft wide and University Lands has authorized a 50-ftwide right-of-way. No drilling or grubbing is proposed. No subsurface ground disturbing
activities will occur. Whenever possible, reroutes for both source and receiver lines will be
surveyed around each cultural resource site encountered to insure that no site will be
affected (see possible exceptions below).

The project area encompasses 7,550.55 acres of University Lands within Block 5, Sections 1
through 3, 10 through 15, 22 through 27, and 34 through 37; Block 6, Sections 1 through
49; Block 7, Sections 1 through 27, and 30 through 40; and Block 8, Sections 1 through 3,
and 10 through 15, Andrews, Dawson, Gaines, and Martin Counties, Texas and can be
found on the McKenzie Lake SE, TX; Patricia SW, TX; Five Wells Ranch, TX, Scharbauer
Ranch, TX; Five Wells Ranch SE, TX; and Bird Ranch, TX 7.5' USGS Quadrangles.
Lone Mountain encountered one previously recorded archaeological site (41AD66), six
newly discovered sites (41AD82 through 41AD87) and four isolated occurrences. The isolated occurrences have been recorded in their entirety and no further work is recommended. 41AD66 is a World War II era bomb target. 41AD82, 41AD83, 41AD86, and
41AD87 have undated lithic artifact assemblages suggesting Unknown Aboriginal (10, 500
B.C. to A.D.1880) components, and 41AD83 also has an Historic component dating
between A.D.1885 and 1953. 41AD84 and 41AD85 have projectile points indicating Late
Archaic (1000 B.C. to A.D. 700 and 200 B.C. to A.D. 600) components.
41AD66 is recommended eligible for nomination the NRHP under Criteria A and D. 41AD83

ii

is recommended eligible for nomination the NRHP under Criterion D. Both of these sites are
recommended eligible for designation as State Antiquities Landmarks under the five criteria.
41AD86 and 41AD87 are recommended ineligible for nomination to the NRHP and for designation as State Antiquities Landmarks. 41AD82, 41AD84, and 41AD85 are recommended
to have an undetermined eligibility for nomination the NRHP and for listing as a State Antiquities Landmark.
The proposed seismic project was redesigned so that all sites would be avoided regardless of
eligibility. Lone Mountain surveyed a reroute around each of these sites, in order that seismic
trucks may avoid cultural materials by at least 30 m. The GIS shapefiles for the sites and
their reroutes will be given to the project proponent so that these locations can be programmed into GPS units carried in seismic vehicles. No further treatment is recommended
and the proposed undertaking will have no effect on any sites.All project documentation
will be curated at the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory.
If buried cultural deposits or other unexpected discoveries are encountered during the project, work should cease immediately, and the Texas Historical Commission should be notified.

gravel, locally indurated with calcium carbonate (caliche). This formation includes point bar, natural levee,
stream channel, sand dune, terrace, alluvial fan, landslide bolson and playa deposits. Soils vary across the project area (Tables 1.1 through 1.4, Figures 1.2 through 1.6).
The project area falls within the Trans-Pecos Vegetation region, giving way to the High Plains just to the northeast. Vegetation is similar to that found within the Chihuahuan desert, and includes creosote, mesquite, fourwing saltbush, tarbrush, acacia, soaptree yucca, prickly pear, cane cholla, Christmas tree cholla, Spanish bayonet, ocotillo, horse crippler cactus, and various forbs and grasses. Surface visibility is between 80 percent and
90 percent.
The project area is located within an active oilfield and livestock grazing area. The landscape is crossed by an
existing network of lease roads, well pads, tank batteries, flowlines, in-use and abandoned pipelines, and
other oilfield-related installations.

Three distinct complexes have been identified in west Texas for the Paleoindian period: Clovis, Folsom, and
Plano (a Dalton complex is known in the east). In general archaeological sites are assigned to particular complexes of the Paleoindian period based on the presence of distinctive diagnostic projectile points. The earliest
complex, Clovis, generally dates from as early as 10,500 to 9000 B.C. The tool assemblage is characterized by
Clovis points (which are bifacially worked lanceolate projectile points with a concave base), transverse end
scrapers, side scrapers, bifacial knives, gravers, perforators, and hammerstones (Cordell 1997).
Folsom sites date from 9000 to 8200 B.C. The Folsom complex exhibits technological distinctions from the
Clovis complex. Diagnostic projectile points include fluted Folsom and unfluted Midland points, which are similar in outline. In addition to these points, the tool assemblages include spoke shaves, end scrapers, perforators, knives, denticulates, drills, choppers, awls, and abrading stones (Cordell 1997). These artifacts are often
found in association with bison kill sites, such as that found in Winkler County at 41WK21, known as the
Shifting Sands Site.

Human settlement in North America is first identified during the Paleoindian period (10,500 to 6500 B.C.).
Despite some evidence indicating a human presence in the New World earlier than 10,500 B.C., Anderson and
Faught (2000) argue that current evidence is insufficient to describe any cultural trends prior to the appearance of the Clovis complex at around 10,500 B.C., Hayden's (1976) arguments for the Malpais pre-San Dieguito/San Dieguito material notwithstanding (Heilen 2004). The Paleoindian period is characterized by a
subsistence strategy focused on hunting now-extinct Pleistocene megafauna, including Bison antiquus and
mammoth. Diagnostic stone tools associated with this period include end scrapers and large, unstemmed lanceolate projectile points, which are often fluted. It is postulated that during this period, points were attached
to thrusting spears. A reliance on big game hunting has been established, but it is unclear to what extent
these people exploited other available resources such as plants (Judge 1982). Little evidence has been found to
suggest the use of structures during this period. From negative evidence, it has been assumed that people
lived a nomadic lifestyle with the use of structures apparently uncommon.

CH A P TE R

The surveyed space falls within a small sample of the High Plains of west Texas, near enough to the neighboring Trans-Pecos to contain at various times cultural traits familiar to archaeologists working in the Southwest,
elsewhere on the Southern Plains, and the Trans-Pecos to the south. The current project is an intensive, noncollection, pedestrian survey. Given the location of the survey area, it is possible that a wide range of cultural
resources representing a considerable time span may be encountered. While the survey is aimed at identifying
these cultural resources, they must be placed in an established cultural context in order for their data potential
to be fully realized.

Plano sites are generally thought of as forming the terminal elements of the Paleoindian big game hunting tradition. Plano is known for a number of artifact complexes. Each complex is distinguished by a series of large
lanceolate and unfluted projectile points, including Angostura, Frederick, Firstview, and Scottsbluff.

Although Paleoindian groups probably utilized small game and plant foods in addition to large game species,
a change in subsistence strategy to full reliance on these food sources marks the transition to the Archaic from
the Paleoindian period. Large-scale climatic changes and the extinction of megafauna caused people to
develop a more diverse subsistence base. Mobility was cyclical and more restricted in extent, compared to
Paleoindian strategies. Once productive resource procurement locations were established, these were often
reused on a seasonal basis.
This change in food procurement is marked by wide-ranging changes in the Archaic tool assemblage. While
Paleoindian assemblages consist mainly of projectile points and meat processing tools, a growing number of
groundstone implements suggest a greater reliance on plant foods at this time. Archaic projectile points are

The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period is sometimes referred to as the Protohistoric period. Projectile points decrease in size, with small triangular points becoming the predominant type.
Many early Protohistoric sites appear to have been contemporary with Ochoa-phase settlements and may represent the appearance of Athabaskans in the region. The Spanish encountered Jumano (first called Teya) and
Apache (Querecho) groups in the area, and with European contact, metal projectile points appeared. The
Kiowa to the north speak a Tanoan language similar to that spoken in the Tanoan pueblos (Newcomb 1961).
Jelinek (1967) has suggested the Jornada Mogollon from the Fort Sumner area formed the ancestral core of
the Kiowa, who then ranged north and east pursuing bison, while the Jumano are possibly descended from
more southerly Jornada Mogollon (Newcomb 1961). However, establishing such pedigrees is difficult considering how poorly understood the movements of populations are at the end of the Late Prehistoric period and
throughout the Protohistoric period.

The Spanish may have entered west Texas prior to A.D. 1536, when Alvar NuÃ±ez Cabeza de Vaca, surviving a
shipwreck in the Gulf of Mexico, possibly passing through west Texas or portions of northern Mexico just to
the south, crossed into Arizona and made his way south into Mexico (Covey 1983), though others argue that
he was already well to the south in northern Mexico (e.g., Weber 1992). Cabeza de Vaca's initial report concerning the lands to the north led to a 1539 expedition by Fray Marcos de Niza. Cabeza de Vaca's and de
Niza's reports in turn prompted Francisco VÃ¡zquez de Coronado to lead the 1540 expedition in search of
riches to be found in the fabled cities of "Quivira" (Katz and Katz 1985). This portion of Texas came to be used
as a route by later Spanish explorers to areas south and east. Coronado likely passed well to the north of the
surveyed area while returning from Quivira. In 1629, Franciscan friars Juan de Salas and Diego de Leon left
northern New Mexico to visit the Jumanos in the vicinity of what is now San Angelo, Texas, followed by Father
Juna de Ortega in 1632. Other expeditions that may have passed near the area were led Diego de Castillo and
Hernan Martin in 1650, followed by the Diego de Guadalara expedition of 1654, both sent from Santa Fe to
look for freshwater pearls on the Concho River to the south and east.

The Late Prehistoric period is characterized by the adoption of the bow and arrow and the frequent use of
pottery. Any pottery found in the area may include many of the same types also found in southeastern New
Mexico (e.g., brownwares and Chupadero Black-on-white, a decorated type frequently made in central New
Mexico). The earliest use of ceramics in southeastern New Mexico was initially suggested to have occurred
between A.D. 600 and 900 (Lehmer 1948, Corley 1965, Jelinek 1967). However, more recently, radiocarbon
dates obtained from Deadman'sShelter, between Amarillo and Lubbock indicating that Jornada Brown may
have appeared as early as A.D. 200 (Hughes and Willey 1978). While the appearance of villages next to agricultural fields and reliable water sources appears to have accompanied these new technologies in neighboring
regions, current evidence suggests that life in much of this part of the Southern Plains continued to resemble
that of the preceding Archaic period, with an increased reliance on bison toward the end of the period.

1 :

The Archaic period is typically divided into an Early (6500 to 3500 B.C.), Middle (3500 to 1200 B.C.) and Late
Archaic (1200 B.C. to A.D. 700), with the last few four hundred years between A.D. 300 and 700 referred to
as a Transitional period, when new technologies such as pottery and the bow and arrow seem to have slowly
come into use.

shorter than those of the Paleoindian period, and larger than arrow points used during the following Late Prehistoric Period. Points of this period are generally stemmed or corner-notched, and exhibit more extensive
morphological variability and less precision in the quality of manufacture than those of the Paleoindian period.

Native groups present in the area during the Spanish Colonial period were nomadic. Early Spanish records
indicate several native groups on the Llano Estacado including Apaches, Querechos, Vaqueros, and Teyas. Apachean groups extended their range to the southern portion of the state sometime in the 1500s. By about
1630, the Apache were ranging as far south along the Pecos as the Seven Rivers area. During the early 1700s,
Comanches and their allies drove the Apache from the Plains, and the surveyed area fell near the southern

before 1890. The county seat of Andrews was established in 1937 after a 1929 oil discovery. The county currently is home to a 14,000-acre waste disposal site operated by Waste Control Specialists of Dallas, Texas.

extend for hundreds of meters or more. In these cases, reroutes will be within existing roads and similar forms
of pre-existing disturbance within the site boundaries.
Any cultural remains predating 1968 (whether an isolated occurrence, archaeological site, or historic structure)
and all previously-recorded sites within 50 ft of the survey corridor were to be recorded. Isolated occurrences
and the locations of any not-relocated previously-recorded sites within 50 ft of the survey corridor were to be

Lone Mountain conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of every source point and every third receiver line
and surveyed reroutes around all archaeological sites encountered, in accordance with the scope of work. Survey corridors were 50 ft wide. Survey coverage was accomplished by the archaeologists walking 15-m interval
transects and excavating 498 shovel tests outside of those performed for discoveries (sites and isolated occurrences as described below). Especially intensive low-interval survey was conducted in areas where previouslyrecorded sites were expected within or near the project area. Whenever possible, reroutes were surveyed

one Mountain conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of every source point and every

Isolated occurrences are cultural remains that do not qualify as sites. They generally consist of single artifacts or
artifact scatters that are of extremely low density and are widely dispersed, and are indicative of a single or
unintentional activity. Isolated occurrences are often found in redeposited context and cannot be related to
other nearby sites or isolated occurrences. In addition, isolated occurrences are generally 50 years old or older,
although Lone Mountain may record more recent materials as isolates if there is a sound reason for documenting their presence. Isolated occurrences were recorded in the field on the Lone Mountain isolated occurrence
form, a GPS reading was taken, and their locations were plotted on the USGS quadrangle.

Sites may be defined as a certain number of cultural materials greater than 50 years in age, such as 10 or more
artifacts in a 15 sq m area, or one or more features. Cultural resource sites are extremely variable in size, and
range from a cluster of several objects or materials to structures with associated objects and features. A site
may consist of secondarily deposited cultural resource remains. Features such as hearths, cairns, rock alignments, masonry concentrations, burned adobe, fire-cracked rock concentrations, cists, corrals, and rock art are

The documentation of historic homesites (and other historic resources) was to include archival research
intended to establish original âownershipâ and historic context.

Shovel testing was to be conducted at all isolated occurrences, sites, the locations of not-relocated previouslyrecorded sites, any settings that had potential for buried cultural materials, and places that had a low surface
visibility due to excessive vegetation (less than 30 percent surface visibility, except on slopes greater than 20
percent). Features that were trowel or shovel tested were otherwise left in place.
Settings that were deemed to have potential for buried cultural deposits included those surveyed lines crossing
soils that are deeper and more likely to contain subsurface cultural remains, such as the Jalmar-Penwell association, gently undulating and Ima loamy fine sand, 0 to 3 percent slopes. Dunal areas and playa, basin, or
drainage edges were selected as particularly likely to contain such deposits. Lone Mountain excavated 497
shovel tests in these settings, finding no otherwise undiscovered buried cultural remains (Appendix A). These
shovel tests were assigned unique numbers that do not correspond to the tests conducted at discoveries, such
as sites and isolated occurrences.

If sites were encountered, boundaries were defined according to Texas guidelines. Artifacts and features were
marked and site boundaries were determined by the distribution of these marked cultural materials. Sites were
recorded using a Lone Mountain Site Record form. A sketch map was drawn of each site, and site locations
were plotted on the appropriate USGS quadrangle. Digital photographs were taken showing the setting, any
features, a sample of nondiagnostic artifacts, and any temporally diagnostic artifacts (ceramics and points). A
representative sample of artifacts from each site was recorded using Lone Mountain artifact analysis forms.
Drawings of diagnostic or representative formal tools were made. Lone Mountain conducted shovel testing at
each site and examined rodent burrows, road cuts, drainages, and other disturbed locations to determine if
subsurface cultural deposits were present. Buried charcoal, ash, artifacts, burned rock, or buried cultural strata
constitute subsurface cultural materials. If shovel testing failed to locate strong evidence of buried cultural
deposits, trowel scrapes were performed.

All observed cultural material was recorded according to Council of Texas Archaeologists (CTA) guidelines. No

generally recorded as sites. Sites also include definite locations of traditional cultural or religious importance to
specified social or cultural groups. A site may be less than 50 years old if it can be demonstrated that a property has achieved exceptional importance within the past 50 years (Criterion Consideration G).

Portions of the surveyed lines crossed existing networks of roads, well pads, tank batteries, flowlines, in-use
and abandoned pipelines, and other oilfield-related installations. These disturbances either destroy or expose
otherwise buried cultural remains. Settings with the appropriate soil types that had less visible or extensive
areas of prior disturbance were selected therefore for shovel testing. Testing intervals varied at times from the
16 per mile recommended in the THC survey standards and depended on the judgment of the surveying
archaeologists to focus on locations that retained a potential for buried cultural remains. As the depths of
sandy Holocene deposits can vary, especially in dunal settings, Lone Mountain excavated tests with a shovel to
depths of at least 40 cm to 60 cm, and continued tests with a 10 cm bucket auger to end at the maximum
length of the auger or on a cemented material such as caliche or an impenetrable hardpan (as described in
Tables 1.1 through 1.4).
Shovel tests were to be 30 cm in diameter or on a side and excavated to the bottom of Holocene deposits, if
possible. They were dug in levels no thicker than 10 cm with sediments screened through Â¼-inch mesh unless
high clay or water content required that they be troweled through.

World War II bomb targets are sometimes a series of concentric circles several hundred meters across that are
clearly visible in aerial photographs and may only be visible on the ground (if at all) as a series of low berms.
Bomb target sites were to be evaluated according to their integrity; those with berms and other elements that
are clearly visible on the ground are considered to be of higher integrity than those that are only visible from
the air.
Because the survey area is located on University Lands, sites are also assessed for eligibility for designation as

Partially buried late historic and recent materials observed throughout the project area indicate that eolian processes operate at a rapid pace. In many environments, when the phrase âburied cultural materialâ is used, the
term âintactâ is usually implied. However, in an active dunal environment where burial, deflation, and reburial
of cultural strata may take place over the matter of just a few years, evidence for buried cultural material is not
necessarily evidence for intact buried cultural material. This adds another layer of difficulty to the evaluation of
sites. However, even a deflated site may be considered eligible for nomination to the NRHP, especially if more
than 100 artifacts are present. In the case of historic sites, NRHP Criteria A, B, and C are more likely to be relevant. The relationship between the resources within the project area and the historical context of the project
area were taken into account when evaluating these sites.

Lone Mountain was to evaluate each archaeological site or other resource (e.g., historic structures, etc.) for
NRHP eligibility as well as State Antiquities Landmark status. The key criterion for most prehistoric sites is the
potential of the site to contain additional data relevant to future research (i.e., NRHP Criterion D). The potential
for important additional data is often dependent on the presence or absence of buried cultural deposits. On
each site, the possibility of buried cultural deposits was assessed by a variety of means as noted above. Observations were noted regarding the likelihood of buried cultural deposits based on several characteristics. For
example, indications of potential site depth include stratigraphic soil profiles exposed along road cuts and
arroyos or cultural materials in the back-dirt piles of rodent burrows.

C H AP T E R

Trowel probes were conducted in features on archaeological sites and are used to evaluate the data potential
of possible hearth features and establish the depth of charcoal deposits and are intended to be minimally
intrusive. If shovel testing failed to indicate that extensive buried cultural deposits were present on a site, Lone
Mountain excavated and screened at least four 50-cm by 50-cm trowel scrapes to a depth of 10 cm or less.

2.the site's archaeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and intact, thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
3.the site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or history;
4.the study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of preservation, thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge; and
5. there is a high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur, and the official landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or alternatively, further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and relic collecting when the site cannot be
protected. (Texas Administrative Code Title 13, Rule 26.10)

The Atlas shows three previous surveys that occurred immediately outside of the proposed project area. In
1989 under TAC Permit 847, nine separate block surveys were conducted with a total of 25 sites recorded. No
information was listed about this survey. Twenty-four of the sites are small open camp sites overlooking McKenzie Draw consisting of burned rock and lithic scatters with a few groundstone artifacts and projectile points.
One historic homesite was also recorded. In 2007, under TAC permit 4605, a survey was conducted for the
expansion of State Highway 349. Five sites were recorded, two twentieth century historic artifact scatters and
three prehistoric burned rock and lithic scatters of unknown age. The most recent survey was conducted in
2017 for the Oncor McKenzie Draw-Texaco Mabee 138 kV transmission line on private land. Only a single previously recorded site, 41MT72, which is a World War II practice bombing site was located during this 155 acre
survey. The TARL site atlas map can be found in Appendix A.

Three sites have been recorded within or possibly within the proposed project boundary. 41AD1 (Figure 2.1) is
listed as a camp site with burned rock and flaked-stone and contained a burial, which has been excavated.
This site was found to be more than 50 m from R-lines 5461 and 5421 and S-lines 2111 and 2121, and was
therefore not updated during this project. 41AD12 (Figures 2.2 and 2.3) was recorded in 1981 as a single chert
flake. This site was plotted 25 m south of S-Line 1811 and was not updated. 41AD66 includes seven World
War II bombing targets, only one of which falls within the project area. These targets have been identified as
the San Angelo-Big Spring Bombing Targets. No determinations of NRHP eligibility or SAL designation were
found. One of these reported targets was updated during the current work.

The THC Texas Archaeological Site Atlas indicates that three previous surveys and a monitoring project have
taken place within the proposed project boundaries. These include TAC Permit 8193 in 2017 for a pipeline,
Atlas No. 8100001787, the 1981 survey of portions of a Red River Gas Pipeline Corporation pipeline, Atlas No.
8100002216, the 1982 monitoring of site 41AD12 for this pipeline, and two segments labeled on the Atlas as
Atlas Nos. 8400005681 and 8400005682 (for which few details other than a date of 1981 are provided; these

41AD66 (Figures 2.4 through 2.7) is one of several San Angelo -Big Springs World War II-era bomb targets
identified by this site number. In this location, the site is comprised of a center mound surrounded by one
earthen berm and a scatter of practice bombs as well as elements that are more clearly visible in aerial photographs. This target was originally recorded by an archaeological site steward in 2013 (Riemenschneider 2013).
The site is located on a sandsheet on low undulating hills. Vegetation includes mesquite, narrow leaf yucca,
and various forbs and grasses. Surface visibility ranges between 76 percent and 99 percent.

The recorded artifact assemblage is comprised of approximately 350 metal and concrete practice bomb fragments (Figure 2.6), representing a 90-percent judgmental sample.

Lone Mountain identified two features. The center mound (Feature 1) and portions of the earthen berm (Feature 2) are mostly visible in aerial photographs, but difficult to see from the ground. Additional elements of the
target are also better visible in aerial photographs but are not readily visible on the ground.
Feature 1 is a mound located at the center of target measuring 20 m in diameter and 2 m high (Figure 2.5).
The feature is composed of sand and has an integrity of approximately 80 percent.

A buried pipeline, caliche-capped roads, and a two-track road have been built through the site, removing portions of the crosshairs and âtickâ marks. Wind erosion, sheetwash, rodent burrowing, and livestock grazing
have also contributed to deflation. This site remains between 51 percent and 75 percent intact.

41AD66 is a WWII era bombing target, in use from A.D. 1942 to 1945, one of seven reported as the San
Angelo-Big Spring Bombing targets (Riemenschneider 2013), and possibly one of the five listed by the US
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) as Formerly Used Defense Sites (FUDS) in Andrews County. These five FUDS
are identified as "Midland AAF TAR RGE" 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7 in the USACE list of FUDS for Texas (https://
www.usace.army.mil/Portals/2/docs/Environmental/FUDS/FUDS_Inventory/FUDS_Inventory_Texas.pdf, accessed
February 14, 2019). The Midland Army Air Field was a bombardier training school with 23 associated bombing
targets, beginning its operations in January 1942. The Army Air Corps bases at San Angelo and Big Spring
were established later in 1942 and had similar training missions. Bombardiers trained on the Norden and
Sperry bombsights, flying in Beech AT-11 Kansans (Figure 2.7), dropped 160 practice bombs on these targets
at night and during the day over a 12- to 18-week period (Baldwin 1944). The Norden Bombsight was a key
piece of technology used during WWII and these bomb targets are associated with the training of bombardiers
with this technology. A study of the arrangement of practice bombs and bomb fragments may yield additional
significant data concerning WWII bombardier training practices. The site is not associable with a specific historically significant individual, and the workmanship, though characteristic of the period, does not remain distinctive. 41AD66 is recommended eligible for nomination to the NRHP only under Criteria A and D. 41AD66 may
contribute additional information concerning the contribution of Texas to WWII era military operations,
remains sufficiently intact, and as a larger site that is difficult to avoid, is threatened by the continuing development of the area. 41AD66 is therefore recommended eligible to be listed as an SAL. An evaluation of the other
bombsites in the area may indicate that these resources are suitable for listing as an historic district.

The NRCS has identified the soils on which this site is located as Triomas and Wickett soils, gently undulating,
sandy eolian sediments derived from the Blackwater Draw formation. Buried and partially buried practice
bomb fragments are possible. Because some of these training bombs were loaded with black powder to produce more visible explosions during training exercises, Lone Mountain conducted no testing.

2 :

Aerial photographs indicate that the bomb target has 315-m-long crosshairs quartering the earthen berm and
central mound; has âtickâ marks at the end of each crosshair; and had a series of four âtickâ marks in each
quadrant delineated by the crosshairs along the outer diameter of the target, some of which are now missing.
Only two âtickâ marks remain in the northwest quadrant, one in the northeast, three in the southeast, and
four in the southwest. This crosshairs and âtickâ marks appear to be lines and patches of exposed caliche and
are not readily visible from the ground.

According to NRCS soil data, most (98.64 percent) of the soils on this site are predicted to be Ima loamy fine
sand, 0 to 3 percent slopes, consistent with the soils encountered in the deeper shovel and auger tests. The
remainder (1.36 percent) is predicted to fall on Jalmar-Penwell association soils. Portions of the site have
deflated, leaving shallow eolian deposits in places and exposed caliche in other portions of the site. Shovel and
auger testing have indicated that buried cultural deposits remain in much of the site area to a depth of 34 cm.

No features were observed. One artifact concentration was found in the northwest portion of the site, surrounded by an area of recent disturbance. The concentration measures 40 m by 30 m and contains more than
100 pieces of flaked-stone debitage, the core, and four of the flaked-stone tools. Lone Mountain conducted
eight shovel and/or bucket auger tests at this site. Tests were begun with a shovel and, if excavated to a depth
exceeding 40 cm to 50 cm, were continued with a 10-cm bucket auger, ending on a caliche stratum. All tests
were excavated in 10 cm levels and are summarized in Table 2.2.

Lone Mountain recorded a 25-percent judgment sample of observed debitage and 100 percent of all other
artifact types. The recorded assemblage includes 102 pieces of flaked-stone debitage (one primary reduction
flake, eight secondary reduction flakes, 58 tertiary flakes, seven thinning flakes, 25 pressure flakes, and three
pieces of angular debris); one multidirectional core; six flaked-stone tools (one retouched flake, one hammerstone, and four bifaces); three metate fragments (two slab, one basin); and one whole one-hand mano. Raw
materials are chert, quartzite, chalcedony, opalite, obsidian, and sandstone. Approximately 300 pieces of firecracked rock are scattered across the site outside feature context.

41AD82 has an undated lithic artifact assemblage indicating an Unknown Aboriginal (10,500 B.C. to A.D.
1880) component. No clearly dateable remains or features have yet been encountered, The site has an artifact
concentration remaining at the northwest end in an area that has been affected by recent refuse dumping and
vehicle activity, and seven of eight tests performed located buried cultural deposits. The site therefore retains
some horizontal and vertical integrity. The surface assemblage on the site contains more than 30 pieces of
flaked-stone debitage and more than 30 pieces of burned caliche and may therefore contribute to statistical
analyses, The quantity of buried material encountered in seven of eight shovel tests suggests that a substantial
quantity of buried cultural deposits with an unrealized data potential may be present. 41AD82 is therefore recommended to have an undetermined nomination to the NRHP under Criterion D and for listing as a SAL under
Criteria 1 through 5.

those managing the ranch. The Five Wells Ranch does not appear on any historic USGS maps, University lands
plats, or BLM-GLO maps, but does appear in a locally-produced county history book as being established by
C.W. Wells, possibly as early as 1885 (Andrews County Heritage Committee 1978). This ranch was then
acquired by the Scharbauer Cattle Company in 1894 or 1895 (https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/
hca02, accessed November 25, 2019; Andrews County Heritage Committee 1978:70). Clarence Scharbauer's
leases on University of Texas lands in Andrews County begin appearing in county records in 1903 (Andrews
County Records 19030325, Book DR:1 - 225). 41AD83 has dateable remains within Feature 1 that may contribute to an understanding of local chronology and contains additional buried cultural deposits, as found in
five of the six shovel/auger tests excavated at this site. The site therefore retains both horizontal and vertical
integrity. The surface assemblage on the site contains more than 30 pieces of flaked-stone debitage and more

therefore not contribute to statistical analyses of artifacts. 41AD85 is therefore recommended to have an
undetermined eligibility for nomination to the NRHP under Criterion D and for listing as a SAL under Criteria 1
through 5.

Lone Mountain recorded all observed artifacts. The assemblage includes 37 pieces of flaked-stone debitage
(eight secondary reduction flakes, 24 tertiary flakes, and five pieces of angular debris); one multidirectional
core; and three flaked-stone tools (one biface, one scraper, and one projectile point fragment) (Figure 2.16).
The projectile point is an unidentifiable distal tip. Raw materials are chert and quartzite.
Approximately 400 pieces of fire-cracked rock are scattered across the site.

No features were observed. Lone Mountain conducted six shovel tests. All tests were excavated in 10-cm levels
and are summarized in Table 2.6.

41AD86 (Figures 2.15 and 2.16), located on a hill top along the northeast edge of a playa, consists of a prehistoric lithic artifact scatter. Vegetation includes mesquite, narrow-leaf yucca, and various grasses and forbs. Surface visibility is between 76 percent and 99 percent.

Wind erosion and sheetwash are the primary causes of disturbance to the site, with cattle grazing and rodent
burrowing also present. This site remains between 26 percent and 50 percent intact.

41AD86 has an undated lithic artifact assemblage indicating an Unknown Aboriginal (10,500 B.C. to A.D.
1880) component. While isolated charcoal was found, this dateable material cannot be directly associated
with a discrete occupational component. Most of the remains found are present on the surface with very little
found in buried contexts. The surface assemblage contains just over 30 pieces of flaked-stone debitage and
more than 30 pieces of burned caliche and might therefore contribute to statistical analyses, but because the
site is undated, such analyses may not be useful. The site is unlikely to produce any additional information.
41AD86 is therefore recommended ineligible for nomination to the NRHP under any of the four criteria and for
listing as a SAL under any of the five criteria.

NRCS soil data predict that 53.82 percent of the site area falls on Potter soils, sloping and 46.18 percent falls
on Ratliff soils, gently undulating. The more rocky shovel tests are consistent with descriptions of Potter soils,
while Ratliff soils might be expected to be a loam or clay loam. Shovel Tests 4 found buried burned caliche at a
depth of 23 cm, and Shovel Test 2 recovered a piece of charcoal, not always a remnant of human activity. The
charcoal found in the shovel test did not appear to be associated with a feature and may not be the result of
any human activity.

Following the excavation of the shovel tests, which produced minimal evidence of buried cultural deposits,
Lone Mountain then excavated five trowel scrapes to remove less compact surface sediments and prospect for
additional cultural remains (Table 2.7). All excavated sediments were screened.

Lone Mountain encountered seven archaeological sites and four isolated occurrences within the surveyed area
(Table 2.10). The isolated occurrences have been recorded in their entirety and no further work is recommended.
The proposed seismic project was redesigned so that all sites would be avoided regardless of eligibility. Lone
Mountain surveyed a reroute around each of these sites, in order that seismic trucks may avoid cultural materials by at least 30 m. The GIS shapefiles for the sites and their reroutes will be given to the project proponent so
that these locations can be programmed into GPS units carried in seismic vehicles. No further treatment is recommended.
If buried cultural deposits or other unexpected discoveries are encountered during the project, work should
cease immediately, and the Texas Historical Commission should be notified.
