Abstract
In August 2007, Archaeology Consultants, Inc., (ACI) performed a cultural resources survey
encompassing 21 acres potentially to be developed as green space with hiking trails along
Chacon Creek in Laredo, Webb County, Texas. The project area is privately owned, but was
funded by the City of Laredo.
Preliminary fieldwork consisted of a search of the Webb County archaeological site forms on file
at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), The University of Texas at Austin, as
well as a review of published reports. The minimum survey standards as prescribed by the
Council of Texas Archeologists were followed. A 100% pedestrian survey was conducted, and
eight backhoe trenches and 14 shovel tests were excavated. One previously documented site
(41WB223) and one newly discovered site (41WB669) were documented. However both sites
are eroded and deflated, and are otherwise heavily disturbed due to mining for gravel and clay.
No diagnostic artifacts were observed, and no artifacts were collected during this project. Any
redundant artifacts recovered from shovel tests or backhoe trenches, after being described, were
placed in the upper 10 cm of the backfilled shovel test or backhoe unit. Any unique-item artifacts
observed on the surface were fully documented, precisely mapped, and left in place. During the
survey, our standards dictated that if any artifacts were observed that could be considered as
significant to any period of the cultural history of Texas that is as yet either unknown or is poorly
understood, then those artifacts would be collected. Examples would be from the Paleoindian
and Early Archaic periods. The Principal Investigator was to make those determinations on a
case-by-case basis.
Archaeology Consultants, Inc. concluded that the project as planned should not effect any
cultural resources eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or
inclusion in the State Archeological Landmarks Program (SAL). Archaeology Consultants, Inc.
recommended to the project sponsors and the Texas Historical Commission that the project
should proceed without further archaeological work. In addition, ACI recommended that if any
cultural resources were encountered during construction, work should immediately be halted in
the vicinity until such finds were examined and evaluated by ACI, or by any qualified
archaeological consultant, and by the Texas Historical Commission.

Introduction
On July 18, 2007 Archaeology Consultants, Inc. (ACI) was contacted by Ms. Ronnie Acosta of
the Laredo Community Development Department. concerning the need for a cultural resources
survey of 21 acres of land privately owned by Mr. Paul Young, and potentially to be purchased
by the City of Laredo for the construction of green space areas with hiking trails. The project is
located on the eastern edge of Laredo, in southwestern Webb County, Texas (Figure 1), and was
funded by the sponsor, the City of Laredo. Texas Antiquities Permit #4629 was granted by the
Texas Historical Commission, and approval to proceed was then given by the City of Laredo on
August 20.
The survey was conducted on
August 24 and 25, 2007.
One previously documented
site
(41WB223)
was
revisited, and one new site
(41WB669) was discovered.
Both sites have been heavily
disturbed by erosion and
machinery. Therefore, ACI
recommended to the City of
Laredo and the Texas
Historical Commission that
the project be allowed to
proceed as planned, with no
impact by the project upon
any
significant
cultural
resources. The ACI crew
consisted
of
Principal
Investigator David Nickels,
Project Archaeologist James
E. Warren, and Crew
Member Art Romine. ACI
was assisted in the field by
Adrian Gause of the City of
Laredoâs
Environmental
Services Department.

Webb County Environmental Setting
Webb County is located in south-central Texas along its southern border with Mexico. The Rio
Grande forms its southern border. Its current political boundary encompasses 3,363 square miles.
The gently sloping terrain ranges in elevation from about 400-00 feet above mean sea level.
Clayey and loamy soils support the growth of predominately mesquite and thorny shrubs with
assorted cacti and grassy understory. A subtle divide through the county causes numerous
intermittent creeks to flow north into the Nueces River, and numerous others of the same type to
drain southward into the Rio Grande. With its semi-arid environment, the average annual rainfall
is only 20 inches per year, the average high temperature is 1000F in July and 430 in January.
These equate to a growing season of 314 days per year (Leffler and Long 2007; Sanders and
Gabriel 1985).
Webb County Prehistoric and Historic Background
Archaeological remains found in Webb County indicate that the area was likely occupied by
Native Americans as much as 11,000 years ago. Without written or oral accounts before the
1700s, it is difficult or impossible to truly say what bands or tribes were in the area before then.
Only cultural affiliations can be assigned to those groups, equating their technologies and
apparent lifestyles to the successive Paleo-Indian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods.
However, there are early written accounts of named Coahuiltecan groups such as the Carrizo,
Pacuache, Pastaloca, and Pitalac tribes or bands that lived in the area during historic times. In the
early 1880s these gropus were being forced from their apparent homelands along the Rio Grande
by encroaching various Indian groups, including Comanches and Lipan Apaches. In addition,
Spanish settlers exploiting mining and ranching ventures were steadily moving north from south
of the Rio Grande, displacing those Native American groups settled in and around present-day
Webb County (Leffler and Long 2007).
Early Spanish entradas through the area include those of Alonso De LeÃ³n in the 1680s, and
Miguel de la Garza FalcÃ³n in1747. In 1749 Jacinto De LeÃ³n established a river ford a mile
upriver from what is now Laredo, on an infrequently traveled road from Monterrey to San
Antonio. The ford he established became known as la Paso de Jacinto (Jacintoâs Pass). The
crossing attracted a small settlement or rancho named Laredo. The small settlement flourished so
that by 1767 there were 185 people living in the immediate area. By 1789 there were 708. Indian
depredations in the early 1800s stymied attempts at ranching and general settlement in the area,
but by 1819 there were 1,418 people in and around Laredo, and by 1828 there were 2,052 settlers
as well as a core of Carrizo Indians in Laredo (Leffler and Long 2007). The war between the
United States and Mexico from 1845-1848 further decimated the area. In 1846 Laredo was
captured by U.S. General Alexander Somervell. During the war, Webb County was established
by the Texas legislature, and following the war, te county became a pert of the United States in
1848. Protection from Indian depredations and roving bandits then stemmed from the newly
established Fort McIntosh (Leffler and Long 2007).
Despite the three-year Mexican War, and despite the Civil War, the economy in the area refused
to yield to depression. In fact, the areaâs livestock production appeared to thrive because of the
demand for beef in the United States. Trade was further advanced by the construction of the

Corpus Christi and Rio Grande, and the International-Great Northern railroads in 1881. In
addition to livestock, coal was now being exported from the Laredo area via the new Rio Grande
and Eagle Pass Railway. Prosperity continued so that 283 farms and/or ranches were within the
proximity. When Encinal County was absorbed into Webb County in 1899, Webb County was at
that time the largest county in West Texas (Leffler and Long 2007).
Technological advancements around the turn of the century included the ability to move water to
thirsty farmlands via wind, gas, and electrically powered pumps. Thus, truck farming expanded
the economy, and among the best were onion fields. A long growing season, a mild climate, and
water from the Rio Grande and a few springs made the area attractive to ranchers.
Approximately 40 large ranches had been established in the area by the 1st quarter of the 19th
century, deriving profits primarily from sheep and cattle, but also from truck farming
Unfortunately, coal mining exports dwindled in the 1930s because of rising production and
transportation costs. Seventy-plus years later, the countyâs economic base relies upon a thriving
revitalization in international trade via Mexico, the United States, and Canada (Leffler and Long
2007).
Previous Archaeology
The prehistoric archaeological site documented during the current project was given the
trinomial of 41WB669, signifying that it was the 669th site documented in Webb County. A
review of the Texas Archeological Site Database (ATLAS) indicated that there are now 669
recorded site within Webb County, but only 565 have sufficient documentation on them within
the same database. These sites include among others Native American campsites and lithic
procurement areas, as well as historic ranches and forts.
As stated previously, portions of 41WB223 lie within the project area. It is included in this
section, but is further expounded upon in the following sections. This site and others near to the
project area include:
41WB9 - Lithic Scatter, Campsite with four adobe cylindrical structures that were likely lime
kilns. Structures appear to have been constructed of clay. This site was recorded by Bill and Bob
Lende in 1977. The site was documented as part of a road widening and sewer line project. It
extends for several hundred yards on either side of Chacon Creek. They indicated that it had
been surface collected since 1958. They documented remnants of structures, Abosolo and
Tortugas points, Langtry, Lerma, smaller arrow points, scrapers, gouges, knives, etc. Prolific
scatter of lithic debitage, snail and mussell shells. Pits with small bone fragments and charcoal.
On first terrace of Chacon Creek. Possible storage pits.
41WB222 - Open campsite with Scallorn point, three biface fragments, abundant lithic debitage,
and stained soil from campfire remnants. Heavily disturbed from deflation, root plowing, and
gravel mining. Located east of Chacon Creek, and documented in 1990-1992 by John Clark with
TXDOT.
41WB223 - This site is located on the right bank of Chacon Creek and was documented in 19901992 by John Clark of TXDOT. It consists of a prolific scatter of lithic debitage, fire-cracked

rocks, charcoal, and stained soils to 20 cm below the surface. Diagnostics recovered during
limited testing at the site include Matamoras and Tortugas dart points. Because it has been
heavily eroded and deflated, its integrity is minimal.
41WB380 - This is a prehistoric lithic scatter approximately 800 m east of Chacon Creek,
documented in 1993 by Dennis Price of TXDOT. He found a Nueces biface, several other
bifaces, a gouge fragment, as well as expedient, utilized flakes. However, the site has been
heavily disturbed by natural and artificial activities.
41WB412 - This site was encountered during a survey for the Chacon Creek Interceptor Project
in 1995 by Prewitt & Associates. A single Catan projectile point, an early stage biface, and a few
utilized flakes were the only tools found at the time. The site was deflated and eroded, with little
integrity.
41WB413 - This is another site encountered by Prewitt & Associates during their survey for the
proposed Chacon Creek Interceptor Project in 1995. It is located on a T-1 terrace on the east side
of Chacon Creek. The only diagnostic found was a Perdiz arrow point base. Other than that, they
documented the remnants of a burned rock hearth eroding from a cutbank, as well as chert and
quartzite fragments suggesting all stages of lithic reduction activities at the site.
41WB414 - This is a third site documented by Prewitt & Associates during their 1995 survey of
a sewer intercept project for the City of Laredo in 1995. It is located on a secondary tributary
about 50 m to east edge of Chacon Creekâs channel, on a T-1 terrace. They recovered a Nueces
tool. A Caracara point, a Fresno point, numerous bifaces and lithic tools, as well as lithic
debitage on the surface. Although, bulk of the site was determined to be heavily eroded and
deflated, there are likely intact deposits on both sides of the tributary.
The 21-Acre Project Area
The project area has been subjected to frequent scouring and flooding along Chacon Creek. The
few upland areas are heavily eroded, exposing clay and clay loam surfaces in many areas.
Otherwise, the unusually frequent and above average rainfall in the Spring and Summer of 2007
resulted in a rebirth of Buffalo grass across approximately 95 percent of the tract. Immature,
secondary growth mesquite, huisache, and blackbrush are sporadically scattered throughout,
along with assorted cacti.
Sandstone ledges outcrop along the edge of Chacon Creek, and as discussed below, sandstone
was often encountered in shallow depths in our backhoe trenches. During the survey many areas
appeared to have been disturbed by mining activities, primarily for gravel and/or clay deposits,
and a few areas appeared to have been machine cleared for brush control. In sum, approximately
12 acres of the project area are in the 100-year floodplain, 5 acres are in the creek active
overflow area, at least 3 acres have been subjected to mining, and 1 acre is in an eroded upland
area (See Figure 2).

Soils in the Project Area include:
Te - About 5% of the project area is covered with Tela sandy clay loam (Te) that is frequently

flooded by heavy rainfall in the South Texas area. The formulation and subsequent accumulation
of Tela soils along the narrow drainages of South Texas occur as dark greyish brown clay loam
with a surface layer of about 14 inches thick. Below that, a subsurface layer develops that is
about 14-19 inches thick. Further developing soil evolves about 19-40 inches below the surface
as grayish-brown, sandy clay loam. Several hundred thousands of years older lies light brownish
gray, loam to approximately 63 inches below the modern surface (Sanders and Gabriel 1985:3536).
CpB - This soil type covers about 95% of the project area and is generally found along the upper
terraces of creeks in the area. Copita soils (CpB) are a fine mix of brown sandy clay loam maybe
5 inches thick, underlain by about another 10 inches of brown sandy clay loam, then yellowish
brown calcareous sandy clay loam to about 46 inches. Underlying that is brownish yellow, once
again, sandy clay loam (Sanders and Gabriel 1985:22).
Methods
Pre-Field Investigations
Having conducted numerous surveys in and around Laredo over the past 30 years, the Project
Archaeologist (Jim Warren) was familiar with the types of sites and archaeological deposits
likely to be found along Chicon Creek. A records search with TARL was conducted to determine
if any sites had been previously documented either within the 21-acre project area, or within
close proximity. Adrian Gause of the City of Laredoâs Environmental Services Department
provided a copy of an unpublished report documenting 41WB223 on the southwestern portion of
the project area (Clark 1992), and various published reports were reviewed before the actual field
work was undertaken.
Field Investigations
In accordance with Texas Historical Commission (THC) Archaeology Survey Standards,
Archaeology Consultants, Inc. (ACI) conducted a systematic, 100% pedestrian survey of the
project area, and excavated backhoe and shovel tests following the methods and minimum
standards as prescribed by THC. The surface of the survey area was examined by three
archaeologists in a systematic pattern in 15-m intervals, with particular attention paid to eroded
and exposed areas void of vegetation, road surfaces, and ephemeral cutbanks. A total of 14
shovel tests and eight backhoe trenches were excavated within the project area. Although our
original scope of work intended 10 backhoe trenches and eight shovel tests, after the pedestrian
survey it was determined that 14 shovel tests and eight backhoe trenches would likely yield the
most productive results. Figure 3 shows the locations of backhoe trenches and shovel tests, as
well as the boundaries of sites 41WB229 and 41WB669.

The backhoe trenches were dug approximately 4m in length, approximately in 30-cm levels, and
ranged in depth from 30 to 240 cm. Two archaeologists observed the trenching and backdirt, and
a sample of each 30-cm level was screened through Â¼" wire mesh. Shovel tests were dug in 10cm levels, and all sediments were screened through Â¼" wire mesh. All shovel tests were 30 x 30cm in circumference, and were excavated to sterile clay, gravels, or bedrock (Figures 4 and 5).
Generally, a âNo Collection Policyâ was followed for this project, and any redundant artifacts
recovered from shovel tests or backhoe trenches, after being described, were placed in the upper
10 cm of the backfilled shovel test or backhoe unit. Any unique-item artifacts observed on the
surface were fully documented, precisely mapped, and left in place. During the survey, our
standards dictated that if any artifacts were observed that could be considered as significant to

any period of the cultural
history of Texas that is as yet
either unknown or is poorly
understood,
then
those
artifacts would be collected.
Examples would be from the
Paleoindian
and
Early
Archaic
periods.
The
Principal Investigator was to
make those determinations
on a case-by-case basis.
The results of shovel testing
and backhoe trenching were
fully documented, and their
locations were precisely
mapped. In addition, this
report
includes
those
locations, and accompanying
tables providing artifact
types (if any), and depths. If
an archaeological site was
found, ACI was to map the
site to include shovel test
locations and/or backhoe
trenches, and file the
appropriate documents with
the Texas Archeological
Research
Laboratory
(TARL).

Survey Results
The surface survey revealed two areas where artifacts were commonly observed on eroded

surfaces and in the southwestern and northeastern portions of the project area. The southwestern
portion encompasses part of 41WB223, a previously documented site. The artifacts observed on
the northeastern portion of the project area warranted the documentation and designation of a
new site, 41WB669.
41WB223
Site Description
This site was first recorded in 1990 by John Clark during a survey for the Texas Department of
Transportation (TXDOT) in anticipation of the expansion of Spur 400 (Clark Street) along the
eastern edge of Laredo (Clark 1992). He estimated that the siteâs boundary resembled an oval
shape covering approximately 650m (e-w) x 340m (n-s). Ranging in elevation from 390-435 feet
above mean sea level, it is situated on the west side of Chacon Creek, spanning the floodplain,
and eroded, gullied T1 and T2 terraces (Figures 6 and 7). Dense vegetation includes young
mesquite and huisache, buffalo grass, prickly pear, tasajillo, cat claw, and Spanish dagger
supported by Copita fine sandy loam (CpB). Due to an abundance of Spring and Summer rains
surface visibility was only about 20 percent in August 2007.

Levels of Effort and Results
John Clark excavated Backhoe trenches 1, 2 and 3 on this site in 1990. In addition, he excavated
5 test units (see Figure 7). In 2007, ACI dug an additional three backhoe trenches (BHTs 6, 7 and
8), and six shovel tests on and around the site (see also, Figure 6). The results are shown in Table
1. Clark found a Matamoras point on the surface at the location of Test Unit 3, and a Tortugas
point on the surface near Backhoe Trench 3 and Test Unit 5, suggesting a Late Archaic
occupation (Turner and Hester 199). ACI did not find any other diagnostics on the site during the
current survey. Clark found no evidence of buried soils or intact archaeological deposits in 1992;
nor did ACI find any evidence of these during the current survey.
As illustrated in Figure 7, John Clark placed his three backhoe trenches and five test units within
the estimated center of the site, within the Clark Street (Spur 400) right-of way. ACIâs 2007
survey area was limited to the estimated northern portion of the site. Our examination in 2007
revealed that based upon the sparse scattering of chert debitage, burned rocks and mussel shell
fragments, the boundary as estimated by Clark in 1992 was accurate, and should not be
expanded.

Conclusions and Recommendations
Our 2007 surface examination of the site indicated that the northern portion of the site appeared
to have been heavily disturbed by erosion, and was deflated. John Clark (1992:12-13) made the
same observation: âOn site 41WB223, deflation appears to have been a major factor in the
destruction of the site. There is little evidence of gravel mining or root plowing, but the site is
also highly disturbed.â â...most of the material was recovered from the first level, with a rapid
reduction in frequency at increasing depth.â â [41WB223 is]...deflated or disturbed to below the
base of cultural deposits, no further work ... is recommended.
Clark further opined that there may be relatively undisturbed portions of the site outside the
Clark Street right-of-way. However, the surface examination conducted during the current
project revealed that much of the area north of Clark Street was also heavily eroded and deflated
(see for example, Figure 8).

Because of the inability of the northern portion of the site to significantly contribute to the
prehistory of the region, no further work is recommended on the portion of the site that lies north
of Clark Street, and the development of the project area should be allowed to proceed as planned.
However, while this current project has demonstrated that the portion of the site that lies north of
Clark Street is heavily disturbed, and any archaeological deposits that exist are now in a deflated
and probable palimpsest condition, the portion of the site that lies south of Clark Street has not
been fully examined and tested. Therefore, until such time that a project is undertaken to
examine that portion of the site, we recommend that the overall significance of the site be
categorized as indeterminate.

41WB669
Site Description
This is a newly recorded
lithic scatter discovered in
the northeastern portion of
the project area (see Figure
3). Bounded on the east by
a steep bluff overlooking
Chacon Creek, the site
extends along an upper,
eroded ridge with a gullied
sideslope along its western
portion, covering an area
of approximately 60m (ew) x 100m (n-s), or about
6,000
square
meters
(Figures 9 and 10).
It ranges in elevation from
410-430 feet above mean
sea level from south to
north. A two-track road
courses along the edge of
the bluff, exposing chert
flakes and fragmented
burned rocks on the eroded
surface (Figure 11).
The northern portion has
been mined for gravel.
Otherwise,
dense
vegetation on the western
slope
includes
young
mesquite and huisache,
buffalo grass, prickly pear,
tasajillo, cat claw, and
Spanish dagger supported
by Copita fine sandy loam
(CpB).
Due
to
an
abundance of Spring and
Summer rains, surface
visibility off of the twotrack was only about 20
percent in August 2007.

Levels of Effort and Results
A surface examination revealed that there were
no intact features, and that the artifacts lay on
an eroded and deflated clayey loam surface. To
evaluate the potential for buried deposits, ACI
excavated three backhoe trenches (BHTs 1, 2,
and 3) and eight shovel tests on and around the
site (see Figures 3 and 9). The results are
shown in Table 2. No diagnostics were found
during the survey, and the only tool observed
was a utilized flake found on the surface near
BHT-3 (Figure 12). No evidence of buried
soils nor intact features was found in any of the
excavated backhoe trenches or shovel tests.

Conclusions and Recommendations
Although numerous chert flakes and an
ephemeral scatter of burned chert were
observed across the surface, all appeared to
have been in an eroded, deflated, and possible
palimpsest condition. Shovel tests ranged in
depths from 100 to 60 cm, and backhoe
trenches ranged in depth from 60-100 cm
before encountering sterile gravels beds or
sandstone bedrock. The only artifact found in
any of the eight shovel tests and three backhoe
trenches excavated on and around the site was
a flake from 0-30 cm in BHT-1.

Additional Off-Site Tests
Backhoe trenches 4 and 5 were placed on the northern portion of the 21-acre project area (see
Figure 3). BHT 4 was excavated to a depth of 80 cm. Yellow fine sandy loam was encountered
in BHT 4 from 0-60 cm, and then sandstone bedrock from 60-80 cm. A single mussel shell
fragment was found between 0-30 cm.
BHT 5 was excavated to a depth of 80 cm. Yellow fine sandy loam was encountered between 070 cm, and sandstone bedrock was encountered between 70-80 cm. No evidence of possibly
cultural material was discovered.
Conclusions and Recommendations
Although two archaeological sites (41WB223 and 41WB669) were documented within the 21acre project area, both were determined to have been significantly impacted by erosion. They are
both in a deflated and probable palimpsest condition. The only caveat is that only the northern
portion, north of Clark Street, of 41WB223 has been tested. If development south of Clark Street
should occur in the future, we recommend that additional testing be conducted for potentially
intact archaeological deposits. Otherwise, we recommend that the project north of Clark Street as
described within this 21-acre report should proceed as currently designed by the project sponsor,
the City of Laredo. The project should be considered as having âno effectâ on any properties
considered as eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or inclusion in
the State Archeological Landmarks Program. As such, the project should proceed without
further archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are encountered during
construction, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds are examined
and evaluated by ACI, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the Texas Historical
Commission.
