MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
Central Texas Highway Constructors, LLC (CTxHC), working as the Design-Build Contractor to SH 130
Concession Company, LLC., is constructing 38.4 miles of a new limited-access four-lane tolled facility.
This will be Segment 5 and Segment 6 of State Highway 130 (SH 130). The route runs through southern
Travis, Caldwell, and Guadalupe Counties. Examination of a total of 25 High Probability Areas (HPAs)
in these segments has resulted in the identification of a number of archeological sites, including site
41GU107. This project falls under both state and federal jurisdiction for cultural resources, and 41GU107
required additional testing to determine the site’s potential eligibility for listing on the National Register
of Historic Places and as a State Archeological Landmark. This additional testing work was conducted
under Texas Antiquities Permit No 5301. Jon J. Dowling was the Project Archeologist and completed the
lithic analysis. Meg Thornton was the Principal Investigator for the majority of the project. Ann M. Scott
assumed the responsibilities of Principal Investigator in November 2010 and supervised the completion of
the project. Documents associated with this project will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL).
In July of 2009, aci consulting carried out archeological testing at 41GU107, a prehistoric campsite
recorded by aci consulting in 2008. aci consulting personnel conducted an intensive surface collection and
excavated nine 1-x-1-meter test units, one 50-x-50-centimeter unit, and 15 backhoe trenches. Findings
indicated that the site rests on a highly eroded floodplain, and subsurface cultural materials are situated
within shallow deposits.
The landscape reflects intensive brush clearing and cattle grazing episodes that impacted the integrity of
41GU107. The high quantity of lithic tools recovered from the site, coupled with a significantly high
tertiary flake ratio, suggests that the site represents a prehistoric tool manufacturing and refurbishing
location. Unfortunately, artifact collecting is known to occur within this area, and no diagnostic materials
were recovered during this project. Because diagnostic materials or charcoal from a cultural context were
not present, dating of the site was not possible. The research potential of 41GU107 is, therefore, limited,
and further archeological work is not recommended. Site 41GU107 was not recommended for inclusion
on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or listing as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL).

1 INTRODUCTION
This report summarizes the results of archeological testing carried out at 41GU107 in July of 2009.
Central Texas Highway Constructors, acting as the Design-Build Contractor in a Facility Concession
Agreement (FCA) with the SH 130 Concession Co., LLC., contracted aci consulting to provide
archeological services. The SH 130 Facility Right of Way (ROW) is located within an area containing a
moderate density of historic farmsteads and towns as well as prehistoric sites adjacent to drainages of the
Guadalupe and San Marcos Rivers.
aci consulting was tasked with conducting an intensive survey of HPAs within several segments of the
ROW. In addition, aci consulting was to assess the potential eligibility of sites within these HPAs for
inclusion on the NRHP or designation as SALs. During archeological survey in the spring of 2008, site
41GU107 was recorded by aci consulting personnel as being of undetermined eligibility (Gillentine and
Yost 2008). The Texas Historical Commission (THC) concurred with the findings in this report in the
Texas Department of Transportation’s (TxDOT) consultation letter on March 26, 2008.
The SH 130 Facility ROW will consist of 38.4 miles (61.8 km) of a new four-lane limited-access toll road
that will extend through Travis, Caldwell, and Guadalupe Counties to IH 10 in Seguin. The proposed 600­
foot construction corridor for this Facility ROW consists of 57.12 acres within a larger 73.41-acre HPA
(Figure 1). Site 41GU107 is located in north-central Guadalupe County and is situated within HPA 18, in
the southernmost corner of Parcel 843 (Figure 2). According to the NEPA FEIS Reevaluation (2006),
construction activities will consist of the erection and removal of short-term erosion and sedimentation
controls, rough and complete surface grading episodes, laying of base materials and asphalt, landscaping,
clearing and grubbing, and installation of curbs, gutters, and various utilities. The specific locality
surrounding 41GU107 is earmarked for a proposed fill area where 10 feet of construction fill materials
will be amassed on top of the ground surface, suggesting only minimal impact to cultural resources.
The following archeological objectives of aci consulting were fulfilled. First, intensive archeological
investigations within 41GU107 were completed, and the extent, nature, and depth of cultural deposits
were ascertained by means of controlled excavation and backhoe trenching. Second, aci consulting
determined whether the site warranted listing on the NRHP and/or designation as a SAL. Finally, a
technical report summarizing the results of archeological investigations and recommendations has been
generated for submission to satisfy cultural resource clearance requirements in this specific component of
the overall project area.

1.1 Project Area
Site 41GU107 is located on a terrace adjacent to and just west of an unnamed tributary of Mill Creek in
north-central Guadalupe County, Texas. This site lies just west of Gravel Pit Road, north of Kingsbury
and within HPA 18, in the southernmost corner of Parcel 843.
Terraces of major drainages of the Central Texas region, like the one on which 41GU107 is located, have
been the most heavily-occupied landforms going back to the prehistory of the region. From the Early
Archaic into the Late Prehistoric, these terrace settings have offered the best access to a variety of
resources necessary for survival in what has historically been a harsh, semi-arid, sub-tropical region prone
to climatic fluctuations that often lead to drought conditions and scarce food resources (Collins 1995).
Agricultural development has significantly modified the landscape of this parcel, which has been used in
the past for cotton cultivation and was most recently used as rangeland for livestock. Modifications to the
landscape have included scraping with heavy machinery and chaining (personal communication, RJ
Henry 2008). This has resulted in the loss of much of the natural vegetation and the arrival of intrusive
plant species such as cedar as well as thick stands of mesquite and prickly pear.

1.2 Environmental Setting
1.2.1 Physiography
The project area is within the geographic region referred to as Central Texas. This landscape consists of
the Blackland Prairie physiographic area, made up of tallgrass prairie. The Blackland Prairie is the most
inland section of the Coastal Plains and is characterized by chalks and marls that weather to deep, black,
fertile soils. The surface is gently undulating and has been cleared of much of the natural vegetation in
favor of cultivated crops.
1.2.2 Climate
This region of Texas is subject to mild subtropical climates with fairly cool winters and hot summer
conditions. Drought conditions can be prolonged, and intensive precipitation can cause significantly high
standing water in the area surrounding 41GU107 due to the relatively low elevation of the site and the
curvature of the tributary around this landscape.
1.2.3 Flora and Fauna
The vegetation within and around 41GU107 consists of mesquite trees, prickly pear cactus, live oak, and
various native grasses (Figure 3). The terrace on which 41GU107 rests is believed to have once been
much more thickly vegetated than it is today, but decades of farming, cattle grazing, and flash flooding
have exposed upper soils. The banks of the unnamed tributary of Mill Creek remain more heavily forested
than the rest of the terrace, with live oaks, hackberry, mesquite, cottonwood, cane, green briar, thornbrush, and various grasses.
Wildlife in the project area consists primarily of a variety of small birds, fish, and numerous reptiles.
Mammals found in the area of the ROW include deer, peccaries, coyotes, bobcats, ring-tailed cats,
beavers, opossums, foxes, raccoons, skunks, and squirrels (Davis and Schmidly 1997). A wide variety of
small and large birds are also present, including turkeys, mockingbirds, jays, and sparrows, as well as
Mexican eagles and smaller raptors, primarily hawks.

1.2.4 Soils and Geology
Soil units within HPA 18 are composed of the Crockett-Demona-Windthorst Association, found on
diffused upland ridges and narrow valleys and drainages. Based on observations derived from the
backhoe trench (BHT 1) excavated in the densest artifact distribution within 41GU107, three distinct
strata exist within the top 1.5 meters of this heavily eroded rangeland. The top stratum consisted of sandy
loamy clay overlying a second lens of slightly loamy clay. Below these two strata rested a significant
horizon of dense gravels, many of which consisted of high-quality chert.
The geological architecture of this portion of Guadalupe County consists of the Willis Formation, which
straddles the southern component of the ROW. The Willis Formation was first defined by Doering (1935)
in Montgomery County, Texas and dates to the Pliocene and Pleistocene (Barnes 1992). The Quaternary
Terrace within the APE dates to the Pleistocene (Barnes 1974). Uvalde gravels also rest in this locality
adjacent to terraces and drainages (Byrd 1971).

2 CULTURE HISTORY AND PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGY
The project area is situated in the southern portion of Central Texas. This culture history will reference
primarily Central Texas regional patterns; however, it is important to note that Central Texas trends may
be better conceptualized within biogeographical areas or drainage areas rather than homogenous locales
(Black 1989). For example, Guadalupe County includes environmental traits from both the Post Oak
Savannah and the Blackland Prairies, and site 41GU107 is closely associated with a drainage of the
Guadalupe River. Once a culture chronology for this region of Texas has been reviewed, the following
section will provide a brief summary of the history and intensive archeological work carried out within
the vicinity of the project area.

2.1 Culture History
2.1.1 Paleoindian (ca. 12,000-8,000 B.P.)
The arrival of humans in the New World occurred during the Paleoindian period, which dates from
approximately 12,000-8,000 B.P. and is one of the least understood periods in Texas prehistory (Collins
1995). As the Pleistocene period ended, diagnostic Paleoindian materials in the form of Clovis, Folsom,
and Plainview projectile points began to enter the archeological record. These points were lanceolate in
shape and longitudinally fluted for hafting to wooden spears. Using the launching momentum from atlatls
(spear-throwers), these earliest Americans frequently hunted large game such as mammoth, mastodons,
bison, camel, and horse (Black 1989). In addition to megafauna, Paleoindian groups likely harvested less
daunting prey including antelope, rabbit, and turtle.
Stylistic changes in projectile point technology occurred during this later portion of the period as Dalton,
Scottsbluff, and Golondrina traditions became increasingly prevalent. While widespread in geographic
range, these types occurred in high densities in the High Plains and Central Texas (Meltzer and Bever
1995). Some sites representative of the Paleoindian period in Central Texas include the Kincaid and Pavo
Real sites. Environmental studies suggest that Late Pleistocene climates were wetter and cooler (Mauldin
et al. 2001; Toomey et al. 1993), gradually shifting to drier and warmer conditions during the Early
Holocene (Bousman 1998). As megafauna gradually died off during the transition to warmer climates,
subsistence patterns shifted toward smaller game and plant foraging.
2.1.2 Archaic (ca. 8,000-1,200 B.P.)
The Archaic period, broadly divided into the Early, Middle, and Late Archaic subperiods, is characterized
by an intensified reliance on local floral and faunal resources and an increase in the number of projectile
point styles (Collins 1995). The archeological record begins to indicate more widespread use of rocklined cooking features, a wider variety of site functions, and more localized geographic distributions of
evidence of human occupation.
2.1.2.1 Early Archaic (ca. 8,000-6,000 B.P.)
According to Prewitt (1981), the Early Archaic witnessed an expansion in the diversity of plant and
animal resources utilized for subsistence with a shift away from large game. Paleoenvironmental data
suggests that the area of the Facility ROW and the surrounding regions underwent a gradual climate
change, particularly between 7,000 and 5,000 B.P. (Bryant and Shafer 1977). The increasingly warm, dry
conditions in what would become the western United States likely caused a significant decrease in

6

available ground water, and what had once been a lightly forested area became a more arid grassland
savanna.
The archeological record reflects a marked decrease in the presence of Pleistocene megafauna in sites
from the Early Archaic. It has been theorized that intensive hunting, combined with environmental
change, drove these species to near extinction. As megafauna populations decreased, a subsistence shift
towards heavier reliance on deer, fish, and plants became necessary. In the archeological record, this trend
equates to greater densities of ground stone artifacts, barbed dart points, task-specific tools such as Clear
Fork gouges and Guadalupe and Nueces bifaces, and fire-cracked rock midden features (Turner and
Hester 1999). These concentrations of heat-fractured rock are believed to be remnants of rock-lined
roasting ovens.
Early Archaic sites tend to be small and suggest low population densities in this region. They are
described as non-specialized sites that are widely distributed across the landscape and are usually found
on the surface or in shallow deposits. Those that have been recorded as deeply buried sites are often
underlying larger Middle or Late Archaic sites (Story 1985). While few sites have been recorded in
Guadalupe County due to the small amount of work performed there, there are numerous Early Archaic
sites in south-central and western Texas. Most of the sites in this region are open campsites distributed
along the eastern and southern margins of the Edwards Plateau in areas with reliable water sources
(McKinney 1981). Site 41GU111, located 6.2 kilometers directly north of 41GU107, yielded numerous
dart points associated with the Early Archaic (Gillentine et al. 2008). Artifacts that are considered unique
to the Early Archaic extend well beyond the boundaries of Central Texas, suggesting that significant
degrees of mobility carried these bands through relatively undefined territories. The Wilson-Leonard,
Jetta Court, and Sleeper sites are all sites representative of the Early Archaic (Collins 1995).
2.1.2.2 Middle Archaic (ca. 6,000-4,000 B.P.)
Paleoenvironmental evidence suggests that the warm, dry conditions that began in the Early Archaic
continued into the Middle Archaic. Research in Central Texas suggests that the driest period was ca.
5,000-4,000 B.P. (Gunn and Weir 1976). These changes in the region’s climatic patterns undoubtedly had
a significant influence on the behavioral adaptations of prehistoric people to the area’s environment.
Sites from the Middle and Late Archaic are larger and more diverse than those of the Early Archaic. It has
been theorized that these larger sites might represent an increase in the population density of the area
(Story 1985, Prewitt 1981). The increased presence of ground stone implements such as manos, metates,
and bedrock mortars in the archeological record suggests a shift to heavier reliance on plant resources as
part of the overall subsistence strategy. According to Collins (1995) the beginning of the Middle Archaic
still exhibited limited large-game hunting of bison, but the climate became much drier towards the end of
the Middle Archaic, necessitating a heavier reliance on sotol and acorn harvesting (Weir 1976:126). An
expansion of oak woodlands on the Edwards Plateau and Balcones Escarpment may have encouraged the
intensified exploitation of certain plants (Weir 1976). Middle Archaic materials date from about 6,000 to
4,000 B.P., with increased occurrence of multi-use bifacial knives and burned rock middens (Collins
1995:383). Diagnostic points from this period include Bell, Andice, Taylor, Nolan, and Travis. The
Tortugas point also appears in Middle Archaic contexts and possibly earlier (Turner and Hester 1999).
Story (1985) suggests that the variation in size of sites from the Middle and Late Archaic periods
indicates a change in local groups based on seasonal and spatial variations in resources. Hester (1975) and
Gunn and Mahula (1977) have suggested that the climatic fluctuations during this time, coupled with the
changes in available resources, resulted in populations clustering in major drainages where resources
would have been more stable. The Landslide, Wounded Eye and Gibson sites demonstrate the cultural
7

trends of the Middle Archaic (Collins 1995).
2.1.2.3 Late Archaic (ca. 4,000-1,200 B.P.)
The last subperiod of the Archaic falls between ca. 4,000 and 1,200 B.P. (Collins 1995) and, in Central
Texas, witnessed a gradual climatic shift from arid to relatively cool and moist. Since burned rock
middens are specifically associated with cooking the tough plants adapted to hot, dry environments, these
archeological features reflect the climatic change of this period and the accompanying shift in
subsistence. Sites dating from the earliest portions of the Late Archaic are associated with the growth of
burned rock middens, but by the end of the Late Archaic the use of these features had decreased. While
rock-lined ovens continued to be used on the western fringes of Central Texas into the Late Prehistoric
period, this practice had been almost completely abandoned in the rest of Central Texas by the end of the
Late Archaic (Collins 1995).
Diagnostic dart point styles of the Late Archaic are relatively small, triangular points with corner notches
such as the Ensor and Ellis (Turner and Hester 1999). Other Late Archaic points include Bulverde,
Pedernales, Marshall, and Marcos (Collins 1995). Cylindrical stone pipes, marine shell ornaments, caches
of large bifaces, and finely-made “corner tang” knives are also distinctive items associated with the Late
Archaic in Central Texas (Collins 2004). It is not entirely clear whether this period experienced a rise
(Collins 1995, Prewitt 1981) or decline (Black 1989) in population numbers, but large cemeteries, grave
goods, and exotic trade items are known to occur at this time in Central and South Texas at sites such as
Loma Sandia, Rudy Haiduk, Silo, Ernest Witte, and Morhiss Mound. Evidence from the Thunder Valley
sinkhole cemetery has suggested that territoriality may have been established during the Late Archaic,
possibly as a result of population increase (Bement 1989). Characteristic Late Archaic sites include the
Anthon and Loeve-Fox sites
2.1.3 Late Prehistoric (ca. 1,200-500 B.P.)
Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric diagnostic tools overlap to some degree, but the commonly held date
for the beginning of the Late Prehistoric is ca. 1,200 B.P. The primary hallmark of the beginning of the
Late Prehistoric period is the appearance of arrow points in the archeological record. These smaller
points indicate the introduction of the bow and arrow, although the atlatl probably remained in limited use
(Collins 2004). The Late Prehistoric period is divided into two phases: the Austin Phase, from ca. 1,200­
800 B.P., and the Toyah Phase from ca. 800-200 B.P. Sites with distinct Late Prehistoric components
include the Kyle, Smith and Currie sites (Collins1995).
The Austin Phase of the Late Prehistoric, dated to between ca. 1,200 B.P. and 800 B.P., appears in
Central Texas as a continuation of Late Archaic life ways with the addition of the bow and arrow. The
use of burned rock middens continued in the relatively arid western portion of Central Texas, and other
subsistence patterns appear to have been maintained as well. Skeletal injuries indicating possible arrowinflicted deaths during this early part of the Late Prehistoric suggest an increase in violence between
groups of hunter-gatherers (Collins 2004). Scallorn and Edwards arrow points are diagnostic of this
phase (Collins 1995; Turner and Hester 1999).
The Toyah phase of the Late Prehistoric is much more well-defined than the Austin phase. In Central
Texas, the Toyah phase is characterized by Perdiz arrow points, prismatic blades, large thin bifaces, end
scrapers, and the introduction of ceramics. Archeological sites from this phase have yielded both locallymade ceramics and Caddo ceramics imported from further east (Collins 2004).

2.1.4 Historic (ca. 500 B.P.-Present)
2.1.4.1 Colonial (ca. 500 B.P.-1821 AD)
Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca and the remaining survivors of the Narvaez expedition were the first
Europeans known to have set foot in modern-day Texas; they landed on the Texas coast following a
shipwreck in 1528 (Chipman 1992). Between 1528 and the late 1600s, Spanish excursions into Texas
were limited. In 1534, Cabeza de Vaca may have travelled through parts of what is now Guadalupe
County, but his route likely passed south of present-day San Antonio. The early Spanish explorers to
Texas and other parts of North America were looking for the same wealth that the conquistadors had
found in Central and South America. The Spanish who followed sought to expand their empire in the
New World and increase the presence of the Catholic Church among local populations they encountered.
In 1689 Alonso de León led one of several expeditions searching for La Salle’s colony at Matagorda Bay.
During this foray, de Leon named the Guadalupe River, but the northernmost extent of the route was
likely near present-day Victoria. This was followed by Domingo Terán de los Ríos in 1691 as part of an
inspection tour of eastern Texas and the missions there.
The Spanish built several missions to the east and west but none in the immediate region of the project
area. Between 1716 and 1722 they established five missions and two presidios in the San Antonio area for
the Coahuiltecans (La Vere 2004). Also, in 1726, missions along the Gulf Coast were relocated along the
Guadalupe River because warfare broke out between the Spaniards and the Karankawas (La Vere 2004).
Between 1749 and 1762, Spain built more than a dozen new missions and presidios across Texas (La Vere
2004). Missions built along the San Gabriel River to serve the Tonkawas of Rancheria Grande included
San Francisco Xavier de Horcasitas (1746), San Ildefonso (1749), Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria
(1749) and Presidio San Francisco Xavier (1751) (Bolton 1914; La Vere 2004). In 1749, Mission Nuestra
Señora Espiritu Santo de Zuniga was moved to the lower San Antonio River. No resources dating to the
Spanish Era have been noted within 1 kilometer of the project area.
2.1.4.2 Mexico and the Texas Revolution (1821 – 1836 AD)
Population in the area was relatively low during the Spanish colonial period; however, this changed after
Mexican Independence in 1821. Central Texas saw a large influx of immigration from the southern
United States from 1825 to 1835 as the Mexicans granted land for several small colonies on the Texas
frontier (Fehrenbach 2000). During this time, 22 families moved into the region as part of the DeWitt
colony. A total of 14 of these families received their land grants directly from the Mexican Government
(HHM, Inc 2008a). The settlements were in portions of what are today Caldwell, Guadalupe, and Travis
Counties and centered on the town of Gonzales.
Guadalupe was a base for companies of Texas Rangers and frontier battalions as one of the major trails
from West Texas to the Gulf of Mexico went through the area. Raids and conflicts with the Indians
became so intense that the region was abandoned in 1834 and settlers were relocated to Gonzales (Hester
1975).
2.1.4.3 Republic of Texas (1836-1845 AD)
Settlement was again disrupted in the region by the 1836 Texas Revolution and Santa Ana’s subsequent
invasion of the area. In addition, it was impacted by raids from various native tribes such as the Kiowa
and Comanche (Fehrenbach 2000). These raids continued through the 1840s and represent some of the
significant events in local history during this time period. The battle of Plum Creek took place in the
general vicinity of the town of Lockhart.
9

The threat of Indian raids in the region did not diminish until 1848 after the Mexican War changed the
boundaries of the frontier and forced most of the Indian population out of the area. The end of the war
also brought a stronger military presence into the area as the Texas Republic became part of the United
States.
2.1.4.4 Antebellum, Civil War, and Reconstruction (1845-1880 AD)
Although the Texas Revolution slowed settlement of the region, it steadily increased afterwards.
Guadalupe County experienced major growth between 1850 and 1860 as a result of agricultural
expansion, including a growth of both crops and livestock (HHM, Inc 2008b).
By the mid-1840s much of Guadalupe County had been colonized by Germans (New Braunfels,
Schumannsville, and Clear Springs) (Fehrenbach 2000). The 1850 Guadalupe County census reported a
total of 1,171 white residents and 335 slaves; and by 1860 grew to 3,689 white residents and 1,748 slaves.
It is clear that many of the white settlers who arrived in Texas also brought their slaves with them (Smyrl
1999). The county in general and the City of Seguin in particular grew and prospered until the Civil War.
The majority of the fighting that took place in Texas during the Civil War was centered on the coastal
areas of Brownsville and Galveston to the southeast of Guadalupe County. Nevertheless, impacts from
the war were still extensive. The railroad interests in Texas that had begun construction before the war had
to be postponed, and construction did not resume until 1866. A large number of the white male
population served during the war, thus many of the farms lacked sufficient manpower; as such many acres
of farm land were underutilized (Smyrl 1999). Although Guadalupe County had access to markets,
despite the Union blockade, being on a major Confederate shipping route, many goods (and money) were
still in short supply. At the end of the war many farms and businesses were looted until the arrival of
federal troops (Fehrenbach 2000).
No resources from this period were noted during the survey, and archival research proved inconclusive. A
ranch located on the parcels to the south of 41GU107, is a Texas Century Ranch (owned and in use by the
same family for more than 100 years); however, no resources dating to the nineteenth century were noted
during aci’s 2008 survey (Shirley et al. 2008). At a minimum, however, the ranch does date to the later
nineteenth century and is an official century ranch.
During the Reconstruction period, Guadalupe County suffered major economic losses; much of this was a
result of the end of slavery (upon which much commerce had been based). Most of the freed slaves left
the county. Between 1870 and 1910 Guadalupe County had a surge of immigration. Immigrants to
Guadalupe County included peoples from Russia, Poland, England, Wales, Ireland, France, Austria, and
Switzerland, but the largest group increase came from Mexico (Smyrl 1999). Most of the newcomers
engaged in either farming or ranching as their primary economic activities.
Many of the large farms in the county were divided and leased for tenant farming and sharecropping in
the 1870s. The practice continued into the early 1900s. Farmers in all three counties certainly continued
to raise livestock (which could then be sold for better prices with the subsequent arrival of the railroad).
Cotton was also a major cash crop for the counties. This land usage, which continued into the twentieth
century, is in fact, one of the major defining influences seen in the various locations surveyed along the
Facility ROW. It is the heritage of several later nineteenth century sites in Guadalupe County, such as
Site 41GU112. However, on a broader level, the intensiveness of this land-use system represents (over
time) one of the consistent impacts to soils (and potential site integrity) along the entire Facility ROW.

10

Guadalupe County’s economy finally received a boost later in the period with the completion of multiple
railways in 1875. These included the Galveston and Red River Railway of the Houston and Texas Central
Railway (1871), and the International and Great Northern Railroad railways (1876). The Galveston,
Harrisburg, and San Antonio railway, also known as the Sunset Line, is the closest to the Facility ROW
and was built through Kingsbury in 1875. In 1878, representatives of the Southern Pacific Railroad
reached an understanding to expand the Sunset line to the west of San Antonio. The economic and social
impacts of the railroads included a greater availability of materials and luxury goods. These influences
extended over the next several decades. However, in spite of the potential access to goods from the larger
regional and national economies, most of the archeological data from the later nineteenth century sites
documented during the current project suggests that most material culture on the 11 historic sites still
showed a heavy reliance on locally produced goods. Examples of definitive imports were few and
included ginger ale beer from the northeast and laundry and cleaning products from the Midwest and East
Coast. Although no reconstruction era resources were noted, the paucity of such goods on these slightly
later sites would generally suggest a low frequency throughout the broader time period as well.
2.1.4.5 Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Century (1880-1929 AD)
Between 1870 and 1910 Central Texas, as already noted, experienced a surge of immigration. Immigrants
included peoples from Germany, Russia, Poland, England, Wales, Ireland, France, Austria, Switzerland,
and Mexico. These groups formed numerous communities in the area, including New Braunfels,
Castroville, and Fredericksburg. Germans ranked as the third largest ethnic group of immigrants into the
area behind Anglo-Saxons and Hispanics (Fehrenbach 2000). A broken belt of settlement, made up
predominantly of Germans, but including other European groups, stretched from the Houston/Galveston
port areas on the coast across south central Texas to the southern portion of the Hill Country, west of
modern-day Austin and San Antonio.
The completion of the railroads in the area brought several changes. One of the most evident influences
was the change in architecture of the region. The nomadic groups prior to the Europeans used expedient
temporary or mobile structures for housing as mentioned earlier. The Spanish and later the AngloAmericans brought more sedentary lifestyles to the area and thus more permanent structures. These often
included split log cabins and post and adobe structures. Roofs were often constructed of native cypress.
As Germans, Czechs, and other groups (primarily central and eastern European) moved into the region
they brought their own building techniques and architectural styles with them. These new styles were
derived primarily from Poland and the Alsace-Lorraine regions of Europe. They include walls made from
the native limestone supported by timbers. These structures had steep pitched roofs and wide porches.
The exteriors often contained intricate woodwork on the doors and columns (Hester 1975).
The area also saw the beginnings of a new network of county roads and highways. This construction
began in the early years of the twentieth century. This road system expanded and became more efficient,
and automobiles became more commonplace in the region. This facilitated the concentration over time of
the populations into larger communities such as Lockhart and Seguin along the Facility ROW. It had a
visible effect on the small communities in the region as well. This is evident from the communities and
structures that were present on earlier historic maps and are not present on later ones. This population
move is also suggested by the abandoned structures present on sites like 41CW88 and those abandoned
structures immediately outside the Facility ROW. Many of these towns such as Weinert ceased to be
growing or thriving communities. The historic marker is placed several hundred meters outside the
Facility ROW.
Farmers in the region continued to raise livestock and cotton became a major crop. Cotton production
peaked in 1900 (38,960 bales), but by 1930 was in a severe decline (8,266 bales) due to the soil depletion
11

and the start of the Great Depression (Smyrl 1999). The discovery of oil in 1913, in the Austin Chalk
formation helped to rejuvenate the economy. Large-scale development in the area began from 1922 to
1924 when a pipeline was constructed from Beaumont to Luling, and 1926 when the Lytton Field was
opened 28 miles south of Austin. The oil and gas industry has subsequently contributed to economic
growth in the Central Texas region throughout the twentieth century (Fehrenbach 2000).

2.2 Previous Archeology
Only four archeological sites have been recorded within one kilometer of 41GU107 (Figure 4). PBS&J
documented sites 41GU72 and 41GU74 in 2001. Site 41GU72, located northeast of 41GU107, is a
multicomponent site consisting of a prehistoric lithic scatter and remnants from a historic farmstead. Site
41GU74 lies southwest of 41GU107 and consisted of four lithic flakes and a bifacial tool. Both sites were
determined to be ineligible for listing on the NRHP.
Site 41GU108, northeast of the present project area, is an unmarked historic grave within a hurricane
fence enclosure recorded by aci consulting during survey. Archival research did not yield any information
on the grave. Testing was conducted within the SH 130 ROW, and no additional work is required for this
project; however a recommendation of additional research was made should further work impact the site
(Thornton and Miller 2009; Gillentine and Yost 2008). Survey conducted on behalf of aci consulting also
revealed a lithic scatter site, 41GU109, located northeast of 41GU107 that yielded a medial fragment of a
formal biface.

3 FIELD AND LABORATORY METHODS
3.1 Field Methods
Site 41GU107 was identified by aci personnel during archeological survey in 2008. In order to warrant
designation as an archeological site, a locality must contain a certain quantity of cultural materials or
features older than 50 years within a given area. The definition of an archeological site for this area is: (1)
five or more surface artifacts within a 15-meter radius, or (2) a single cultural feature, such as a hearth or
midden, observed on the surface or exposed in a shovel test, or (3) a positive shovel test containing at
least three artifacts within a given 10-centimeter level, or (4) a positive shovel test containing at least five
total artifacts, or (5) two positive shovel tests located within 30 meters of each other. In the case of
41GU107, more than five artifacts were exposed on the ground surface within a 15-meter radius, and a
possible feature was identified in the south bank of the Mill Creek tributary during survey work
(Gillentine and Yost 2008).
Field methods for this project included surface collection of artifacts, hand excavations, and backhoe
trenching (Figure 5). Field methods exceeded THC testing field work requirements.
3.1.1 Surface Collection
Preliminary observations during the archeological testing of 41GU107 suggested that a controlled surface
collection of artifacts would be necessary as a point of departure for further testing work. All surface
artifacts within Loci 1, 2, and 3 were collected, and artifact collection beyond the locus margins was
limited to lithic tools (Figure 5). Surface artifact distributions provided the basis for site boundaries and
the placement of test units. A great deal of artifact collecting (looting) is known to have occurred in this
locality, and road-development traffic in the area has been escalating. The surface collection strategy was
designed to locate the highest probability areas for the placement of test units, as well as to quickly
recover highly visible tools that would be attractive to collectors.
Five collecting loci were arbitrarily established during the survey component of work at this site
(Gillentine and Yost 2008). However, surface visibility had increased greatly since then, and three
densely clustered artifact groups were identified and defined as collection loci for this intensive testing
project. The surface distribution of artifacts across the site was so extensive that the boundaries of the
initial three collection loci eventually expanded into a single large perimeter, with three dense artifact
clusters within. However, the boundaries of the three loci were maintained to retain some provenience for
quantification purposes and the identification of higher probability locations for test unit placement. Since
backhoe trenching proved unrevealing in the identification of subsurface deposits, test unit placement was
dependent on surface distributions of artifacts.
3.1.2 Hand Excavations
The surfaces of Loci 1, 2, and 3 each exhibited a single dense cluster of artifacts within a dispersed
artifact scatter; the three densely-clustered groupings of artifacts directly influenced test unit placement.
Locus 1, which exhibited the highest density of burned rock and lithic tools on the surface, was subject to
five hand-excavated 1-x-1-meter units (Figure 5). Two hand-excavated 1-x-1-meter units were placed in
both Locus 2 and Locus 3. All test units were oriented to the cardinal directions. A datum was set just
outside the southwest corner of the southwestern-most test unit in each collection locus. These datums
were established at 10 centimeters above ground surface. A site datum was set in the center locus, Locus
2, to use as a reference point for mapping purposes.

In order to investigate the possible presence of a thermal feature, a 50-x-50-centimeter exploratory unit
was positioned over the ashy soil anomaly in the tributary bank and excavated to the creek bed. This unit
was outside the perimeters of Loci 1, 2, and 3.
All units were excavated in 10-centimeter levels by hand, and all matrix was screened though ¼-inch
hardware cloth. All cultural material was collected and bagged by unit and level, and appropriate
unit/level forms were completed for each unit. The Project Archeologist maintained daily entries in a
field journal. Sketch maps of the site were generated with simple compass-pacing. Site boundaries, locus
margins, datums, and excavations were plotted with a GPS with sub-meter accuracy. Abundant digital
photographs of all excavation units were taken at numerous stages with a scale and dry-erase board. All
cultural material was collected and brought back to the aci consulting office for analysis.
3.1.3 Backhoe Trenches
The original research design for this project included plans to test approximately 1% of the surface area of
the site, estimated at 3.38 acres (13678.374 square meters), using 17 backhoe trenches, each of which was
to have measured approximately 10 x 0.8 meters (Gillentine et al. 2008). The 15 10-x-1-meter trenches
actually excavated tested more than the required percentage of the site while requiring less time from the
backhoe operator than would have been necessary to excavate 17 trenches. The research design specified
that of the 17 planned trenches, 12 should be oriented north-south, while 5 should run east-west. Of the
15 trenches actually excavated, 7 were oriented north-south, 3 were oriented east-west, and 5 ran from
northeast to southwest, perpendicular to the Mill Creek tributary (Figure 5). The deviation from the
research design represented an effort to collect the best sample of data possible based on actual field
conditions.
Several backhoe trenches were positioned around the margins of 41GU107 in an attempt to establish with
more certainty the boundaries of the site, which were based primarily on artifact distributions on the
ground surface. Many of these surface artifacts were highly pulverized and displaced by heavy machinery
and bioturbation and were used for site boundary establishment only. One backhoe trench was placed
adjacent to an ashy soil anomaly recorded by Gillentine and Yost (2008) within the south bank of the
unnamed tributary of Mill Creek during archeological survey.
The 15 10-x-1-meter backhoe trenches terminated at 1.5 meters below ground surface. All backhoe
excavation complied with Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) standards. Elaborate
scaled profiles of all backhoe trenches were generated, and soil colors, textures, structures, and cultural
contents (if present) were noted. All back dirt and trench walls were inspected for cultural material.

3.2 Laboratory Methods
All cultural materials recovered during archeological testing were analyzed, described, and reported.
Lithics were examined for attributes indicating cattle-crushing or mechanical breakage in order to
establish that all materials inventoried and curated were actually cultural. All artifacts and records
obtained and/or generated during the project were prepared in accordance with federal regulation 36 CFR
79 and THC requirements for State Held-in-Trust collections. During curation, processed artifacts were
washed, air-dried, and stored in 4-mil zip-locking archival-quality bags. An acid-free label was placed in
each artifact bag. Each label contained provenience information and a corresponding lot number written
in archival ink, with pencil or laser printed. Lithic tools were labeled with permanent ink over a clear coat
of acrylic and covered by another acrylic coat. Artifacts were separated by class and will be stored in acid
free boxes. All field forms were completed with pencil.

4 PHASE II INVESTIGATION RESULTS
This section presents the results of archeological investigations at 41GU107. Testing at this site consisted
of intensive surface collections, nine hand-excavated 1-x-1-meter units, one hand-excavated 50-x-50­
centimeter unit, and fifteen 10-x-1-meter backhoe trenches. All archeological testing efforts were
performed within the SH130 ROW that encompasses the majority of the site. Cultural materials in this
locality rested primarily on ground surface and at shallow depths. Test Units 1 through 9 were excavated
to 50 cmbd, while Test Unit 10 was excavated to 110 cmbd. Finally, 15 backhoe trenches distributed
across the site were excavated to 1.5 meters below ground surface. The vast majority of cultural materials
recovered during this investigation were collected from the surface of the badly eroded landscape.
Archeological work via surface collection, test unit excavation, and backhoe trenching yielded lithic tools
and debitage, burned rock, charcoal, and burned clay. Before discussing archeological testing results, a
brief summary of the nature of the deposition in this locality is provided.

4.1 Depositional Nature of the Landscape of 41GU107
The landscape surrounding 41GU107 was at one time heavily vegetated. Recent grazing episodes and a
severe drought have increased surface visibility, revealing dense artifact distributions on the ground
surface. Such grazing episodes can result in the crushing of lithic materials, and aci personnel had to
distinguish between materials that were the result of prehistoric lithic reduction and lithics crushed by
cattle hooves during grazing.
The increased ground surface visibility that resulted from these grazing episodes also enhanced the
visibility of surface artifacts to collectors. The significant number of lithic tools recovered from
41GU107, coupled with the complete dearth of diagnostic materials, indicates that intensive collecting of
attractive projectile point artifacts in this locality has probably taken place.
Other factors influencing the archeological record at 41GU107 are evident in signs of intensive erosion
and other geomorphic processes present throughout the landscape. The site is located on a low terrace
adjacent to a tributary of Mill Creek that is prone to flooding. Only two inches of precipitation are
necessary to inundate this landscape, and a heavy rain can result in several inches of standing water. The
landscape is highly deflated, and backhoe trench observations indicate that accretion of soil deposits laden
with cultural materials is limited to the shallower deposits. It remains unclear whether surface artifact
densities observed at 41GU107 reflect actual prehistoric activity areas or were caused by postdepositional processes.

4.2 Surface Collection
Initial survey results of 41GU107 suggested that artifact scatters on the landscape occurred within five
discreet loci (Gillentine and Yost 2008). Upon closer examination during archeological testing, these five
loci proved to be part of a large and definable artifact scatter with three dense artifact distributions within.
This scatter was divided into three distinct loci, based on the three dense artifact concentrations, for
collection purposes and provenience approximation. Intensive examination of the landscape indicated that
no burned rock features were present although fire-cracked rock (FCR) was widely distributed across the
ground surface of the site. No particular FCR density in any of the three loci resembled a thermal feature,
but slightly more dense concentrations of FCR played key roles in the positioning of test units. All burned
rock specimens were relatively small, and they did not appear to occur in any kind of associational
pattern.
17

4.2.1 Locus 1
Artifacts recovered from the ground surface of Locus 1 included lithic debitage and tools as well as small
specimens of burned rock. The burned rock was not densely clustered in any particular area, nor were
thermal features present. As indicated in Table 1, numerous formal bifaces were observed in Locus 1,
several of which were densely clustered at the base of a large prickly pear cactus patch. It became clear
that the cactus patch would need to be removed for test unit placement. Numerous artifacts were
concealed by this overlying cactus patch, and other cactus patches were thoroughly examined
subsequently. Backhoe Trench 1 was positioned over a separate cactus patch within Locus 1 that also
concealed numerous artifacts on the ground surface, but this trench was excavated with negative results.
Locus 1 exhibited the highest quantity of formal, thinned bifaces and burned rock specimens of the three
loci. Five of the 10 test units excavated during this project were positioned in this locality as a result.

4.2.2 Locus 2
The center locus at 41GU107, Locus 2, contained the greatest diversity of lithic types present at the site.
Types included bifaces, cores, core tools, and flake tools (Table 2). This locus also revealed a high
quantity of tertiary debitage compared to Locus 1. This locality had a wider dispersal pattern of artifacts
than did the other loci, but a concentrated cluster was still present within the center of the locus.

4.2.3 Locus 3
Locus 3 yielded less burned rock but more lithic debitage from the surface than did Locus 1 or 2. As seen
in Table 3 below, the surface of Locus 3 yielded the highest quantity of tertiary flakes as well as the most
18

debitage of all three loci. However, distributions at both Loci 2 and 3 lacked thinned formal bifacial tools,
and burned rock was relatively scarce. Therefore, Loci 2 and 3 received two test units each, while five test
units were positioned within Locus 1. The extent of cattle crushing and mechanical breakage apparent in
the lithics resting on the landscape and the extensive evidence of erosion on the ground surface indicate
that post-depositional forces have impacted the density and distribution of the surface artifacts. However,
surface artifact distributions provided the basis for the locations of controlled excavation units.

Table 3. Locus 3 artifacts recovered from ground surface.

Three lithic tools were recovered outside the margins of Loci 1, 2, and 3. An informal non-hafted biface
in an early stage of reduction and two multi-directional core tools were found within the site boundaries
of 41GU107, and they are plotted in Figure 5, above. The two multi-directional core tools were
encountered in the creek bed of the unnamed tributary of Mill Creek, adjacent to 41GU107.

4.3 Hand Excavations
Controlled excavation work at 41GU107 consisted of nine 1-x-1-meter units and one 50-x-50-centimeter
unit. The bulk of cultural materials encountered during archeological testing were recovered at shallow
depths, and many excavation levels yielded no artifacts.
4.3.1 Locus 1
Locus 1 exhibited the most significant concentration of tools and burned rock on the surface and was
subject to five 1-x-1-meter units, each of which was excavated to 50 cmbd (Figure 6). Test Units 1, 2, 3,
8, and 9 within Locus 1 yielded formal biface fragments (n=2), lithic debitage (n=201), core tools (n=3), a
flake tool (n=1), and burned rock (n=43) (Table 4). All recovered burned rock specimens were relatively
small. Locus 1 yielded the highest quantity and density of cultural material of the three loci, but given the
high-energy deposition of artifacts and their shallow depths, it is unclear whether this locality was
actually a focal point of prehistoric activity.

Test Units 4 and 5 were located in Locus 2. Artifacts from these units include a flake tool (n=1), lithic

limited compared to Locus 1. Burned rock specimens collected from Test Units 4 and 5 were also
relatively small in size. Like Loci 1 and 3, Locus 2 yielded more tertiary than primary or secondary
flakes, suggesting the later stages in lithic reduction were common at this site during tool manufacturing
activities.

primary or secondary flakes. Burned rock specimens were, again, relatively small. Controlled excavation
within all 3 loci suggested that only the shallow deposits contained cultural material. This trend was also
observed in backhoe trench investigations.

Table 6. Locus 3 artifacts recovered from test units.

Test Unit 10, a 50-x-50-centimeter exploratory unit, was placed within the west wall of Backhoe Trench 4
along the south edge of the tributary bank (Figure 7) in order to investigate the possible thermal feature
discovered during archeological survey (Gillentine and Yost 2008). This unit yielded one fragment of
lithic debitage and a single specimen of burned rock just below ground surface. Based on the stratigraphy
of the unit, it is likely that the ashy anomaly is the result of a past burning of the vegetation of the area.

21

Figure 7. Test Unit 10.

4.4 Backhoe Trenches
Fifteen backhoe trenches were excavated within 41GU107. Five of the fifteen backhoe trenches were
aligned perpendicular to the Mill Creek tributary in order to illuminate the architecture of soils in this
locality. The profiled walls of backhoe trenches depicted highly eroded loam and loamy clay deposits
resting over an extremely dense gravel horizon, exemplified by the soil architecture seen in Backhoe
Trench 1 (Figure 8). Many of the exposed gravels consisted of high quality chert material. However, only
two backhoe trenches yielded culturally modified material, and only at very shallow depths. Backhoe
Trench 7 exhibited small amounts of burned rock and angular lithic debris at very shallow depths. These
specimens were observed in the backfill and were not collected.

22

Figure 8. Backhoe Trench 1 profile.

Backhoe Trench 4 was aligned perpendicular to the Mill Creek tributary skirting 41GU107. As discussed
previously, it was positioned immediately east of a possible thermal feature noted in the south bank of the
creek during archeological survey. A single piece of lithic debitage and a small piece of non-angular
burned rock were noted in the west wall profile. This profile, coupled with the controlled excavation of
Test Unit 10, confirmed that the anomaly observed within the south bank of the Mill Creek tributary was
not a prehistoric thermal feature. The charcoal and ash inclusion seen in the west wall profile of Backhoe
Trench 4 (Figure 9) is likely the result of large-scale vegetation burning in this area.

23

Figure 9. Charcoal and ash inclusion in Backhoe Trench 4 profile.

4.5 Discussion of 41GU107
Site 41GU107 yielded a large quantity of lithic tools, debitage, and burned rock but no diagnostic
artifacts. However, a basic cortical analysis of debitage collected from both surface and subsurface
deposits indicates that tertiary flakes occurred in more than twice the quantities of primary and secondary
flakes combined. High frequencies of tertiary flakes are associated with late-stage reduction in tool
manufacture, as the amount of cortex is less on late reduction specimens and greater on early reduction
specimens (Andrefsky 1998; Sutton and Arkush 2002). The significantly higher percentage of tertiary
versus primary or secondary flakes at 41GU107 likely reflects activities centered on lithic tool
manufacture and refurbishing. The locality surrounding this site is rich with high-quality chert gravels and
could have provided the raw material for stone tools.
Burned rock often indicates the presence of hearth or cooking features, but surface fires (i.e. brush fires,
either natural or man-made) may also produce burned rock. Land clearing activities that may have
involved some brush burning are known to have occurred in this locality. However, in order for rock to
develop the angular break attributes and heat spalls that indicate intentional cultural use, intense
prolonged or repeated heating must occur. Since wildfires and modern landscape burning episodes tend to
be relatively brief, no single location is subject to intense heat for a prolonged period of time. Site
41GU107 exhibited a wide dispersal of small fire-cracked rock specimens, but only a small percentage
exhibited angular break patterns and heat spall pits.
Out of the 34 lithic tools recovered at 41GU107, only six were formal tools reflecting extensive
production effort in the form of multiple sequences of lithic reduction. The other tools recovered from this
24

site were of a more informal, easily manufactured design. Expedient tools offer the hunter-gatherer more
task variability because their more informal design is not constrained morphologically (Andrefsky 1998).
Inferences can be drawn between the amount of effort exhausted in lithic tool production and the
settlement strategies utilized by prehistoric tool makers. Some studies suggest that more formal tools
requiring greater production effort are associated with mobile hunter-gatherers, and that expedient tools
produced with less effort are associated with more sedentary groups (Parry and Kelly 1987). In general,
lithic artifact diversity is expected to be greater at multifunctional base camps than more temporary camps
with specialized functions (Andrefsky 1998). Also, one expects to find higher ratios of expediently
produced informal tools in localities with abundant amounts of high quality raw lithic material
(Andrefsky 1998). The presence of a combination of both formal and informal tools could also mean that
this site was occupied multiple times and by different groups of people practicing varying degrees of
sedentary/nomadic mobility patterns. However, with such poor site integrity and numerous postdepositional forces at play, cultural materials other than displaced lithics on the ground surface no longer
remain to elaborate our understanding of prehistoric activity in this locality.
The dating of 41GU107 is impossible without diagnostic tools or charcoal from a cultural context, but one
of its primary functions can be inferred. The presence of 34 lithic tools and high tertiary flake ratios at this
site strengthens the argument that 41GU107 was a prehistoric campsite where intensive lithic tool
production was taking place; however, it is likely that this site served a number of functions during its
semi-permanent occupation(s). Given the high ratio of expediently manufactured tools coupled with the
diversity of tool types, it is likely that this site was subject to more long-term occupations or was
frequently revisited. Its proximity to a river drainage and quality raw lithic materials would have made it
an ideal place for prehistoric occupation. However, modern development, cattle grazing, artifact
collecting, and erosive forces have removed or destroyed the bulk of informative materials that once
rested within this site.

5 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
aci consulting carried out archeological testing work at 41GU107 in July of 2009 within the proposed SH
130 Facility Right of Way project area. Testing efforts consisted of intensive surface collections, nine 1­
x-1-meter test units, one 5-x-50-centimeter test unit, and fifteen backhoe trenches. Investigations suggest
41GU107 was a prehistoric location for lithic tool manufacturing and refurbishment. Unfortunately, no
diagnostic artifacts were recovered from the site, and its age of occupation(s) is unknown; thus, its
interpretive research value has been severely diminished.
Despite the absence of diagnostic artifacts at 41GU107, a large quantity of lithic tools, debitage, and
burned rock were recovered. The significantly higher percentage of tertiary than primary or secondary
flakes at 41GU107 suggests that tool manufacture and refurbishing may have been a dominant activity at
this site, facilitated by the abundant high-quality chert gravels in this locality.
The high quantity of early reduction stage tools recovered from this site may be associated with relatively
sedentary occupations. These informal tools indicate a fair amount of diversity and versatility and may
signify a multifunctional base camp rather than a temporary camp with a specialized function; however,
this is impossible to ascertain without the identification of distinct occupations in intact subsurface
deposits. Site 41GU107 may have been host to a wide range of prehistoric pursuits, but the high quantity
of tools and tertiary debitage indicate that tool manufacture was likely a dominant activity. Unfortunately,
the site lacks integrity, and numerous post-depositional forces have intensively impacted the
archeological record in this area. Aside from displaced lithics on the ground surface, little else in the
forms of features or diagnostic materials remains to offer insight into prehistoric activity in this locality.
Modern development, cattle grazing, intensive artifact collecting, brush clearing and burning, and erosive
forces have removed or destroyed the bulk of data that could have been recovered from 41GU107.
aci consulting has fulfilled the archeological testing objectives for this project. First, aci consulting
completed an archeological examination of 41GU107, ascertaining the extent, nature, and depth of
cultural deposits. Second, aci consulting has determined that 41GU107 does not meet the specific criteria
to render it eligible for listing on the NRHP and/or designation as a SAL under 13 TAC 26. This
recommendation is based on the application of the four criteria for eligibility set forth in 36CFR60. This
property is not significant for association with historic events or individuals significant to our past, the
features do not embody characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction or represent the work
of a master, and the property is not likely to yield information important in prehistory or history. Finally,
the results of archeological investigations at 41GU107, in addition to the recommendations based on
those findings, have been summarized in this technical report for submission to the Sponsor, Central
Texas Highway Constructors, LLC, and the Texas Historical Commission (THC). All documents and
artifacts associated with this project will be curated at TARL.
In conclusion, 41GU107 offers minimal archeological information and extremely limited interpretive
research potential. Therefore, aci consulting does not recommend additional archeological work, and
development in this locality for the SH 130 Facility Right of Way should proceed.

Appendix A: Artifact Analysis
Cultural materials recovered during this project consisted of burned rock, lithic debitage, and stone tools.
Many of the chert artifacts appear to be made from raw materials resembling the gray, brown, and tan
cherts originating from the Edwards limestone formation. Burned rock specimens recovered from
41GU107 were consistently small, and most lacked the angular breakage patterns engendered by the longterm heat maintenance associated with prehistoric thermal rock features used by hunter-gatherers. Their
shared context with densely clustered prehistoric debitage and lithic tools is undeniable, but no distinctly
larger, more angular fire cracked rock specimens with midden-like attributes were present at 41GU107.
With the presence of such a high quantity of burned rock, it seems likely that thermal features were once
present on the landscape but were subject to the destructive forces of high-energy flooding, breakage by
bioturbation, sporadic pedestrian foot traffic, and brush burning/clearing episodes. Therefore, no analysis
of burned rock was performed. A detailed debitage analysis was not attempted given the poor site
integrity and the lack of a significant sequence of a vertical time dimension in subsurface deposits. A brief
cortical examination of debitage and a discussion of the site’s tool inventory will follow.

Debitage
Established methodologies used to characterize and interpret debitage assemblages have been
comprehensively studied (see Andrefsky 1998; Sullivan and Rozen 1985; Mauldin and Amick 1989). A
detailed analysis of debitage recovered from this project was not conducted because approximately 67%
of the recovered debitage was yielded from a ground surface subject to intensive cattle grazing and
flooding episodes. However, the amount of cortex (chemically/physically weathered exterior surface of a
rock) on recovered debitage was evaluated to obtain a glimpse of the reduction processes at play at this
site. Flakes are typically assigned as primary, secondary or tertiary, based on the amount of cortex. It is
assumed that the amount of cortex should be less on late reduction specimens and greater on early
reduction pieces (Andrefsky 1998).
The ground surface of 41GU107 yielded only 11 primary flakes, 104 secondary flakes, and 404 tertiary
flakes. The integrity of any surface collection is subject to question, but the high ratio of tertiary flakes
recovered from the ground surface at 41GU107 suggests that a large percentage of the lithic reduction
activities that took place at this site reached the later stages in tool manufacture.
Subsurface collections also support the same assessment. The majority of subsurface debitage was
recovered from the top 3 levels of excavated test units. Within Locus 1, Test Units 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9
yielded 2 primary flakes, 34 secondary flakes, and 165 tertiary flakes. Test Units 4 and 5, within Locus 2,
yielded no primary flakes, 3 secondary flakes, and 14 tertiary flakes. Test Units 6 and 7, placed in Locus
3, yielded 1 primary flake, 10 secondary flakes, and 24 tertiary flakes. Several artifacts exposed in situ
during test unit excavation in Locus 1 rested in a vertical context, suggesting high energy deposition of
subsurface cultural material. However, the ratio of tertiary flakes from test units within Loci 1, 2, and 3
also indicate later stages in the lithic reduction processes.
The percentage of tertiary flakes out of all surface collected debitage was 78%. The percentage of tertiary
flakes recovered from the shallow subsurface deposits within Loci 1, 2, and 3 was 80%. These
percentages coupled with the high quantity of lithic tools recovered from 41GU107 suggest a significant
amount of prehistoric activity at this site was centered on lithic tool manufacture.

Lithic Tools
Lithic tools recovered from 41GU107, unfortunately, reflect the leftover components of a heavily
collected/looted artifact assemblage. Many of the tools recovered from this site during testing were either
too expediently manufactured to indicate to collectors that they were prehistoric tools, or too fragmentary
31

to be attractive to them. However, 34 lithic tools in various reduction stages were recovered during
archeological investigations. Classification of tools was based on morphology rather than use-wear
analysis. Many archeologists prefer not to use the analytical category of core tool. However, for the
purposes of this examination, artifacts classified as bifaces possessed two faces that met to form a
bifacially worked edge that circumscribed the entire artifact. Core tools were identified as lacking bifacial
flaking along the entire perimeter, exhibiting a worked edge from flake removal, and lacking debitage
attributes. From a reduction/manufacture point of view, many core-tools would be classified as bifaces.
The presence/absence of cortex on tools was not considered a deciding factor in tool classification.
The surface of Locus 1 yielded 12 tools. Figure A-1 illustrates four formal bifaces. Specimen a is a late
reduction stage medial fragment that may have once been hafted. Specimen b is a late reduction stage
biface that was retouched. It lacks grounded and dulled edges or backing along its proximal sides.
However, it may have been hafted after it was retouched since its retouched distal edge is significantly
more beveled than the other sides, as though it was re-sharpened after it was inserted into a handle as an
endscraper. Specimen c represents a non-hafted proximal fragment of a late reduction biface. Specimen d
is a late reduction lanceolate shaped biface. It is a proximal fragment and may have been hafted to a
handle or dart. The scale of this biface is as such that it was likely too narrow and thin to be manipulated
effectively as a bifacial knife. It exhibits a notch-like indentation reminiscent of a Pipe Creek phase
biface; however, this notch-like indentation is believed to be post-depositional and not the result of human
action. Figure A-2 depicts five informal bifaces that were non-hafted and expediently made. Specimens a
and b are middle reduction stage bifaces, and Specimens c and d are early reduction stage bifaces.
Specimen e is a proximal fragment of a middle reduction stage biface. Figure A-3 illustrates the three
multidirectional core-tools recovered within the margins of Locus 1.

Locus 2 yielded seven tools and one core. Specimen a in Figure A-4 illustrates an informal biface that
served in a non-hafted capacity. It was expediently made and represents an early reduction stage biface.
Four flake tools were recovered that were unimarginally edged (Specimens b thru e). Two
multidirectional core tools (Specimens f and g) and 1 multidirectional core (Specimen h) were also
recovered from the ground surface of Locus 2.

Figure A-4. Lithic artifacts recovered from Locus 2.

A total of eight tools was collected from the ground surface of Locus 3. Figure A-5 depicts seven
informal bifaces in various reduction stages. Specimens a and b are thinned distal fragments that were
probably not hafted, and represent late stages of lithic reduction. They were likely preforms. Specimens c
and d are late reduction stage proximal fragments of thinned bifaces that did not function in hafted
capacities. Specimen e is a medial fragment of a non-hafted biface in a middle to late reduction stage. It
was likely a preform. Specimen f is a middle reduction stage biface that was not hafted and exhibits some
breakage from bioturbation. Specimen g is an early to middle reduction stage biface that was not hafted.
One core tool was recovered from the surface of Locus 3 as well (Specimen h).

34

Figure A-5. Lithic artifacts recovered from Locus 3.

The majority of lithic tools that were exposed in situ during archeological testing was found in the first
level of Locus 1 test units. Test Unit 2 yielded two proximal fragments of formal bifaces as seen in Figure
A-6 (Specimens a and b). These specimens represent late reduction stage bifaces. They may have been
used in a hafted capacity, but they show no evidence of grinding or dulling along the edges. They were
exposed in a vertical context as a result of the locality’s proneness to flooding episodes. Three
multidirectional core tools (Specimens c thru e) and one bimarginal flake tool (Specimen f) were also
recovered from shallow deposits.
