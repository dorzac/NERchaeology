Abstract

ABSTRACT
Under Texas Antiquities Code (TAC) Permit 4859, Hicks & Company
archeologists completed an intensive, linear 100% pedestrian archeological
survey supplemented with 32 shovel tests and 14 backhoe trenches along
approximately 32,000 linear feet (9,753 m) of a proposed new sanitary sewer line
along the Trinity River floodplain, northeast of the City of Fort Worth in Tarrant
County, Texas. The project was sponsored by the City of Fort Worth, who is
replacing an existing, aging sewer line to meet current and future demands
(increased usage, better maintenance accessibility, etc.). To complete this
project, the City of Fort Worth must apply for a Section 404 Permit through the
United States Corps of Engineers. Through this federal permitting requirement,
the proposed project also falls under the oversight of the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966 (as amended; NHPA) and the guidelines of Section 106
of 36 CFR 800 (Section 106). In addition, the proposed sewer line requires a
construction and maintenance easement that will be held by the City of Fort
Worth and will cross several parcels of land owned by the City. As such, the
survey also fell under the regulatory obligations of the TAC. Surveyors found
areas with clear evidence of extensive modern disturbance and filling, including
nearly a third of the total alignment being placed within the existing right of way
of Randol Mill Road (which contained evidence of buried sewer, water and
electric lines as well as ditch construction and other indicators of modification).
In less disturbed areas, soils were deep, compact silty clays with no evidence of
historic or prehistoric cultural activity. Based upon a general lack of cultural
materials, a high level of disturbance in many areas, and the very good overall
coverage of subsurface testing in the survey corridor, unless there is further
variation in the proposed alignment, construction for the proposed sewer line
project is recommended to proceed with no further Section 106 or TAC
coordination required and no historic properties affected. Since no artifacts or
sites were found during the course of survey, all project-related materials will be
maintained at Hicks & Company’s offices in Austin, Texas.

Introduction and Executive Summary

INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
On behalf of the City of Fort Worth (COFW), Hicks & Company completed an
intensive linear archeological survey along approximately 32,000 linear feet
(approximately 9.7 km) of a proposed replacement sewer line along the Trinity
River Floodplain northeast of the City in Central Tarrant County, Texas (Plates
1, 2, 3, and 4). As part of its “Wastewater Collection Master Plan 2000-2020,”
the COFW plans to replace the aging M-253 sewer line (built in 1958) with a new
line, bringing the new route farther south of the Trinity floodplain, making it
easier for maintenance, reducing flood inflow, increasing capacity, and
minimizing impacts to existing and proposed construction facilities in the area.
Beginning at the project’s western terminus, the proposed new M-253 sewer
line, ties into existing lines at the intersection of Randol Mill Road and
Woodhaven Boulevard, and proceeds east. For the first 1.2 miles, (1.9 km) the
sewer line will be placed within the existing Randol Mill Road right-of-way (ROW)
in the median between the east- and west-bound travel lanes. East of Riverbend
Estates, the line turns northward and leaves the existing ROW, then continues
northeastward across Loop 820 then joins Old Randol Mill Road’s ROW and
continues east for approximately one quarter mile (0.4 km). The line then turns
north, following the bend of the Trinity River toward the north, around the east,
then back southward where it rejoins the Randol Mill Road ROW near Cooks
Lane. The line remains in the northern road ROW for approximately one mile
(1.6 km) then turns east for the final mile (1.6 km) of proposed route, essentially
paralleling or overlapping the existing M-253 line until it eventually ties into an
existing facility at the eastern project terminus approximately 300 feet (91 m)
northeast of Claycourt Circle.
For the majority of the project, the proposed sewer line will be placed through
open-cut trenching to a depth of approximately 8-10 feet (depending on grade).
The line will cross three small creek tributaries through aerial suspension
(Figure 1) then return to its subsurface routing. Finally, in the hillier upland
portions of the alignment near the eastern project terminus, the proposed line
will be placed through subsurface boring. For construction of this project, the
City will generally purchase a 30-foot construction and maintenance easement
(next to existing sewer easement) with actual construction impacts limited to
approximately 7.5 feet from the project centerline (15 feet total). Including the
project’s 30-foot easement, the proposed sewer line encompasses project area of
approximately 20.6 acres.
Since the project requires permitting from a federal agency (the United States
Corps of Engineers), the sewer line falls under the regulatory oversight of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and is obligated to fulfill requirements
outlined in Section 106 of 36 CFR 800 (Section 106). In addition, since the
COFW will purchase a maintenance easement and portions of the proposed
route overlap COFW-owned land, the project is also regulated by the Texas
Antiquities Code (TAC). Through a coordination letter to the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) detailing the proposed construction, it was determined that
an archeological survey was required to fulfill all Section 106 and TAC
regulatory requirements that had been triggered.

Introduction and Executive Summary

Figure 1. Looking east at aerial installment of existing sewer main within the
median of Randol Mill Road. The proposed sewer main will parallel this line in this
location.
Conducted under TAC Permit 4859, the archeological survey conformed to the
THC’s minimum standards for intensive linear archeological investigations,
using a combination of backhoe trenching, shovel testing, and surface
inspection. Fourteen backhoe trenches were placed at opportunistic locations
within accessible portions of the project easement at a general interval of one
every 1,000 feet (300 m). Backhoe trenching was not conducted within either of
the sewer line segments that lay within the existing Randol Mill ROW due to the
abundant evidence of disturbance from road construction, buried water, sewer
and electrical lines, drainage ditch excavation, and (particularly along the
eastern ROW segment) safety concerns within the very narrow ROW available for
excavation. In all non-disturbed segments, trenches were excavated to as close
to the depth of impact for the project as possible (10 feet, 3.3 m), to bedrock, or
pre-Holocene deposits, with trenches reaching an average of more than three
meters below ground surface (bgs). Once excavated, all trenches were recorded
on standardized forms, inspected for profile features, and drawn and
photographed. None of the 14 trenches contained any features, artifacts, or
other evidence of cultural resources.
Throughout the full length of the project corridor 32 shovel tests were excavated
at a rate of 16 tests per mile except in areas with clear evidence of severe
disturbance (mainly along the existing Randol Mill Road ROW.
Shovel tests
were excavated to a depth of one meter, sterile soils, or bedrock, whichever came
first. The majority of tests terminated at/or near one meter. All of these tests
were negative for cultural resources. The overwhelming majority of the project
corridor was densely populated with a cover of spring vegetation including
manicured lawns, ranch grasses, and thick riparian and woodland brush.

Introduction and Executive Summary

Particular attention was paid to a portion of the proposed sewer line that lay
approximately 300 m south of Site 41TR151. Surveyors inspected the ground
surface and all subsurface tests (both trenches and shovel tests) for indications
of the site within the proposed easement, but found none. The site is likely
limited to portions of the landform farther north of this project corridor.
Fieldwork for the archeological survey occurred from April 15th through 24th of
2008. The field crew for this portion of the survey consisted of Mason Miller
(Principal Investigator), John Campbell (Project Archeologist) and Matt Stotts
(Field Archeologist). Kent Lunski of Transystems provided valuable assistance
throughout the completion of the field survey. Since this survey did not
encounter any archeological sites, all project related documents and materials
will be maintained at the Hicks & Company offices in Austin, Texas.

Environmental Setting

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is located along the southern side of the Trinity River in an area
that is a mixed use residential, commercial, and recreational area. In a
generally suburban contact, the project crosses a variety of developed and
undeveloped landforms with native and exotic plants and animals. Below is a
brief description of the prevailing natural setting in the study area.

GEOLOGY
Depositional processes of the Trinity River and its associated drainages have
influenced the topography of the project area. The topography is mostly flat to
gently sloping, except for narrow areas with steep slopes immediately adjacent to
and south of the Trinity River. Five major geologic formations underlie the
project area: Alluvium, Fluviatile terrace deposits, Woodbine Formation,
Grayson Marl and Main Street Limestone undivided, and Pawpaw Formation,
Weno Limestone, and Denton Clay undivided (Bureau of Economic Geology
1972).
Alluvium consists of floodplain deposits including indistinct low terrace deposits
formed during the Quaternary. These deposits are characterized as containing
gravel, sand, silt, silty clay and organic matter.
Fluviatile terrace deposits are characterized by gravel, sand, silt, and clay.
These low terrace deposits occur along streams and rivers, mostly above flood
level. These deposits were also formed during the Quaternary.
Woodbine formation is composed of sandstone, with some clay and shale, and
was formed during the Cretaceous. The overall thickness of the formation is 175
to 250 feet. The formation is divided into three layers. The upper layer is mostly
fine-grained sandstone marked by ripples. This layer is reddish-brown with
some large discoid concretions near the top. The middle layer is mostly crossbedded find-grained sandstone. There are some carbonaceous interbeds of clay.
This layer varies from gray to brown.
The lower layer is composed of
interbedded sandstone and clay. There are also some beds of ironstone and
ironstone conglomerate. The color can vary from white, red, brown, to gray.
Grayson Marl and Main Street Limestone undivided were formed during the
Cretaceous. It is composed mostly of Grayson Marl. Grayson Marl is mostly
calcareous clay and marl with a yellowish gray and medium gray color that
weathers yellowish brown. Limestone beds may be found in the upper onethird. The thickness is 60 to 100 feet, thinning northward at a gentle slope.
Main Street Limestone is medium grained and chalky, with thin beds of
calcareous shale. The color is yellowish gray that weathers to light gray to
white. The thickness is 20 to 35 feet, thinning northward.
Pawpaw Formation, Weno Limestone, and Denton Clay undivided were formed
during the Cretaceous. The Pawpaw Formation is composed of claystone,
mudstone, and sandstone.
This formation commonly contains marine
megafossils. The color is light olive gray to medium gray. The thickness is 10 to
25 feet, thinning southward. Weno Limestone consists of upper limestone,
middle alternating clay and limestone, and lower limestone units. The upper
layer is a light gray and yellowish gray color that weathers gray and yellowish
brown. The middle layer is olive brown to olive gray. The lower layer is light to

Archeological Survey – Ft. Worth Sewer Main – June 2008

Environmental Setting

medium gray and weathers yellowish brown. Denton Clay is composed of
alternating clay, marl, and limestone. The amount of limestone remains fairly
constant, while the amount of clay and marl varies. The clay is calcareous with
considerable shell debris. The marl ranges from calcareous clay to limestone.
The color is soft, yellowish brown that weathers dusky brown. The limestone is
a dark gray that weathers dusky brown.

SOILS
A total of eleven soil types occur within the project area in Tarrant County:
Birome-Aubrey-Rayex complex, 5 to 15 percent slopes; Crosstell fine sandy
loam, 3 to 6 percent slopes; Batsil fine sandy loam, 0 to three percent slopes;
Trinity clay, frequently flooded; Arents, frequently flooded; Ovan clay,
occasionally flooded; Arents, loamy; Aledo-Bolar complex, 5 to 20 percent slopes;
Sunev clay loam, 3 to 8 percent slopes; Frio silty clay, occasionally flooded; and
Ovan-Urban land complex, frequently flooded.
The following soils are
considered prime farmland: Bastil fine sandy loam, 0 to 3 percent slopes, Ovan
clay, occasionally flooded, and Frio silty clay, occasionally flooded. Soils
classified as hydric soils include Trinity clay, frequently flooded and Arents,
frequently flooded.

FLORA AND FAUNA
The proposed project lies within the Cross Timbers and Prairies Ecological Area
of Texas (Gould 1960) and in the Texan Biotic Province (Blair 1950). The Cross
Timbers and Prairies Ecological Area is a transitional area between the great
plains of the central United States and the forested low mountains or hills of
eastern Oklahoma and Texas. The region is a mosaic of forest, woodland,
savanna, and prairie. The physiognomy of the Cross Timbers is oak wood and
tallgrass prairie. Dominant woody species include post oak (Quercus stellata),
blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana),
bumelia (Bumelia lanuginosa), and greenbrier (Smilax bona-nox). Forbs of the
region include bluebonnets (Lupinus texensis), Engelmann daisy (Engelmannia
pinnatifida), and Maximillian sunflower (Helianthus maximilliani). Tall and
midgrasses are dominant, and include such species as big bluestem
(Andropogon gerardii), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), indiangrass
(Sorghastrum nutans), and sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula). This region
is not well suited for cropland, and is mostly used for rangeland and
pastureland. Oil production is also a major activity in this region (Gould 1960).

WILDLIFE
Mammal species typical of the Texan Biotic Province include Virginia Opossum
(Didelphis virginiana), Eastern Mole (Scalopus aquaticus), Fox Squirrel (Sciurus
niger), Fulvous Harvest Mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens), Hispid Cotton Rat
(Sigmodon hispidus), Deer Mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), Eastern Cottontail
(Sylvilagus floridanus), Swamp Rabbit (Sylvilagus aquaticus), and Black-tailed
Jackrabbit (Lepus californicus). Reptiles of the province include Ornate Box
Turtle (Terrapene ornata), Eastern Box Turtle (Terrapene carolina), Green Anole
(Anolis carolinensis), Fence Lizard (Sceloporus undulatus), Eastern Racer
(Coluber constrictor), Coachwhip (Masticophus flagellum), Eastern Rat Snake
(Elaphe obsoleta), Common Kingsnake (Lampropeltis getula), Cottonmouth

Environmental Setting

(Agkistrodon piscivorus), and Western Diamondback Rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox).
Typical anuran species include Hurter’s Spadefoot Toad (Scaphiopus hurterii),
Gulf Coast Toad (Bufo valliceps), Woodhouse’s Toad (Bufo woodhousii), Northern
Cricket Frog (Acris crepitans), Strecker’s Chorus Frog (Pseudacris streckeri), Gray
Treefrog (Hyla versicolor), Green Treefrog (Hyla cinerea), Bullfrog (Rana
catesbiana), and Rio Grande Leopard Frog (Rana berlandieri) (Blair 1950).

LAND USE
Land use in this region would be considered equally suburban residential,
agricultural and municipal (roads and parkland converted from a landfill).

Cultural Background

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
The project area lies within the easternmost portion of the Plains Archeological
Planning Region as defined by the THC (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:4-5). The
previous designation for the region was defined by Suhm et al. (1954) as the
North-Central Texas cultural resource area. The cultural history of the project
area can be divided into four main chronological periods following the research
of Prikryl (1990): Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and Historic period.
Prikryl’s (1990) exhaustive synthesis of the prehistory of the region, through the
Trinity River Basin investigations along Elm Fork is the major source for
approaching a working model of the region’s cultural background.

CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY
Paleoindian Period (ca. pre 8500 B.P.)
The Paleoindian period extended from the terminal Pleistocene into the Holocene
and was characterized by a low population base of wide-ranging nomadic bands.
Subsistence patterns during this period may best be described as a generalized
hunting and gathering economy, with a combination of big-game and smaller
faunal hunting as well as the collecting of plants (Prikryl 1990). Evidence has
been recovered for Paleoindian occupation in the North-Central Texas area
however, most of the evidence has been recovered from surface artifact finds,
providing little information about specifics of daily life during this period. The
Paleoindian cultures are distinguished by their distinctive lithic technology,
evidenced through the finely chipped, sometimes fluted lanceolate projectile
points.
Archaic Period (8500 – 1250 B.P.)
The Archaic period is divided into three temporal subcategories (Prikryl 1990):
Early Archaic (8500-6000 B.P.), Middle Archaic (6000-3500 B.P.), and Late
Archaic (3500 – 1250 B.P.). The Early Archaic most likely coexisted with the
long warm glacial warming trends marking the end of the Pleistocene. Although
no discrete Early Archaic components have been isolated in the region, the
projectile points from this period mirror the Paleoindian lack of regionalization
and are mostly made from non-local cherts (Prikryl 1990:69). Additionally,
similar to the Paleoindian period, most of the known sites of the Early Archaic
period are located on terraces, potentially reflecting a lack of floodplain
investigations.
While the Early Archaic period retained many technological similarities to the
Paleoindian period, the Middle Archaic hunter-gatherers are increasingly
distinctive. In this region, the Carrollton Focus, as originally defined by Crook
and Harris (1952), encompasses both of these periods. Subsequent
investigations have shown that it may be possible to identify distinct Early and
Middle Archaic periods of surrounding areas (Prickryl 1990). In general, this
Early to Middle Holocene period is characterized as warm and dry initially and
becoming wetter around 4500 B.P. when the Cross Timbers are thought to have
first developed (Prikryl 1990). The projectile points seem to mirror a cultural
change as well, by becoming more regionalized toward the end of the period.

Archeological Survey – Ft. Worth Sewer Main – June 2008

Cultural Background

The Late Archaic in this region has generally been associated with the Elam
Focus (Crook and Harris 1952). This period, which shows strong affiliations
with cultural traditions to the east and north, is marked by an increase in site
density which may indicate increased population. An increase in plant species
due to wetter climate conditions may have encouraged further regionalization
during this period and the slight decrease in the overall number of lithic
artifacts made from chert may evidence this trend as well (Prickryl 1990).
Late Prehistoric Period (1250 – 250 B.P.)
The Late Prehistoric period is generally divided into two phases, representing
early and late transitional periods: Late Prehistoric I (1250 – 750 B.P.) and Late
Prehistoric II (750-250 B.P.). The Late Prehistoric period represents a significant
change from the earlier patterns in the region. Overall, it is distinguished by the
introduction of new technologies, including the bow and arrow along with the
emergence of ceramics, as well as potentially new adaptive strategies such as
agriculture. The Late Prehistoric I period in this region is characterized by
projectile points (Scallorn, Steiner, and Catahoula), which were more commonly
made from quartzite instead of chert during the early stages of this period
(Prickryl 1990:77-79).
The Late Prehistoric II may represent the actual
introduction of peoples following a southward extension of bison range in parts
of Texas, along with considerable influence from the more settled agricultural
peoples to the north and east. Various unstemmed triangular arrow points
representative of this period are Maud, Perdiz, Fresno, Washita and Harrell.
Historic Period
Historic Native Americans in the Tarrant County area during the era of first
European contact include Tonkawa and Caddo groups with Wichita, Comanche
and Kiowa groups moving into the area by the early 1700s. These native groups
historically clashed with the first white settlers in the region, who were
encouraged to come to Texas during its early statehood by the Texas Legislature.
The most famous of these conflicts, the Battle of Village Creek took place in
1841 when a band of 70 settlers, led by General Edward Tarrant (the county’s
namesake), attacked and destroyed three Native American Villages and led
General Tarrant to establish an outpost (Fort Bird) near the battle location.
While skirmishes and conflicts continued into the mid- and late 1800s, General
Tarrant’s battle was instrumental in eventually driving Native American groups
from the area (Hightower 2008).
The City of Fort Worth was first established as a military outpost at the
confluence of the Clear and West Forks of the Trinity River in 1849. The
camp/fort, named after General William Jenkins Worth, rapidly grew with the
influx of settlers to the area and eventually became the county seat in 1856.
Fort Worth, the home of many settlers from northern states, was a site of tense
times during Texas’ vote for secession as two reported abolitionists from the city
were lynched. Following the Civil War, the city and county governments were
disbanded and reappointed with leaders that were thought to be more
sympathetic to the Union’s cause (Hightower 2008).
Following the Civil War, Tarrant County and Fort Worth gained significant
prominence with the rise of the cattle industry. Cattle drivers, bringing their
south Texas herds north to the railroads, routinely stopped in the county for
supplies and entertainment and, eventually, to place their herds on the new

Texas Pacific Railway which ran west to San Diego, California. The county
continued to prosper through the turn of the century as farming supplemented
income from the cattle industry. The early 20th-century oil boom further fed the
city and county’s economy into the Great Depression while military industry and
bases further influenced the area into World War II and beyond (Hightower
2008).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
No formal archeological surveys have been conducted in the project area. One
previously recorded site is located close to the existing sewer line, but appears to
be well-removed from the proposed new alignment (Figure 1). Site 41TR151
was recorded in 1994 by an avocational archeologist as a Paleoindian site buried
at least 10 feet deep. The recorder collected one Plainview point from the site.
One additional site has been recorded close to, but outside the project area on
the other side of the Trinity River. Site 41TR68 was originally recorded in 1942
as a buried prehistoric site containing mussel shell and large burned rocks. At
that time the site had been disturbed from gravel mining operations. It was
revisited in 1984 and found to have lost integrity.

Results of Investigations

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
Archeologists from Hicks & Company conducted an intensive survey of proposed
sewer main for the COFW extending from the intersection of Woodhaven
Boulevard and Randol Mill Road east for approximately 32,000 feet (9.7 km).
The proposed project follows Randol Mill Road for the majority of the length and
is primarily located within the floodplain of the Trinity River. A total of 32 shovel
tests and 14 backhoe trenches were excavated within the proposed project area.
The proposed sewer main is located within the ROW of Randol Mill Road, COFW
property and private property. All shovel tests were excavated to a depth of one
meter, to sterile soils, or to bedrock. Backhoe trenches averaged three meters or
more in depth except in areas with shallow bedrock or disturbed soils. All of the
subsurface tests were negative for cultural material and no cultural material
was observed within the project area. The results of the investigations are
summarized below based on geographic location.
Woodhaven Boulevard to Old Handley Ederville Road
This section of the project area is to be constructed entirely within the ROW of
Randol Mill Road (Plates 1 through 4). Randol Mill Road in this area is a four
lane divided avenue owned and maintained by the COFW (Figure 2). The
proposed sewer main will be constructed in the center median dividing the four
lanes. The proposed sewer main will be constructed as an aerial expanse across
an unnamed tributary of the Trinity River. This aerial construction will be
placed between the two two-lane bridges over the tributary (Figure 1). While
design specifications have not been finalized for the western terminus, two
shovel tests were excavated at the western end of the project area where the
proposed sewer main leaves the Randol Mill Road ROW. This area is the
location of the old Randol Mill Road and exhibited signs of disturbance, as well
as remnants of the old road. Both shovel tests were negative for cultural
material. No other tests were excavated within this section, where the main is
within the Randol Mill Road ROW, due to the disturbance caused by previous
road construction, buried utilities and the close proximity of the original sewer
line. Investigators documented this area with photographs only.

area. Proposed sewer main will be installed in the median.

Cultural Background

Old Handley Ederville Road to I-820
At Old Handley Ederville Road the proposed sewer main turns north out of the
Randol Mill Road ROW for approximately 75 meters and then turns east onto
private property extending east northeast to I-820 (Plate 2). Old Handley
Ederville Road is closed to the public in this area and a historic bridge is located
approximately 30 meters north of the proposed sewer main. The investigators
did not have access to two of the largest private properties in this portion of the
proposed project area (Plate 2). According to the project engineer, a significant
portion of this area is composed of deep, introduced fill resulting from adjusting
the Trinity River Channel. A small accessible portion of this section is owned by
the Tarrant Regional Water District and is used as a levee. This levee comprises
the base of the new Handley Ederville Road and consists primarily of the road
ROW where the proposed sewer main crosses. The sewer main in this area will
parallel an existing gas pipeline between the new Handley Ederville Road and I820. Testing was not conducted within this area due to the presence of a
pipeline pumping station within the levee ROW as well as concerns regarding
excavations near the levee raised by the Tarrant Regional Water District. The I820 ROW was investigated but found to be heavily disturbed and steeply sloped
within the proposed project area (Figure 3).

Figure 3. Looking west at fill area from the I-820 right-of-way.
One shovel test and one backhoe trench were excavated on private property
adjacent to the Old Handley Ederville Road. The shovel test was shallow,
encountering dense gravels and cobbles at 30 cmbs. The backhoe trench (BHT1) consisted entirely of disturbed construction fill including asphalt, brick,
rebar, a construction cone, and assorted trash (Table 1) (Figure 4). The trench
stopped at 175 cmbs where the investigators encountered massive concrete
blocks that could not be moved with the backhoe.

A historic bridge traverses the former channel of the Trinity River at Old Handley
Ederville Road (Figure 5) that was examined from the edge of the property due
to a lack of right of entry. It appears to have good integrity and is still used for
access to the Trinity River by the county. The structure is a steel truss bridge
with concrete headers, a concrete deck, and concrete railings (possibly a Parker
pony truss bridge). The bridge’s construction date is unknown. Since the
proposed sewer line will pass approximately 15 meters south of this structure,
below the ground surface, it will not be negatively impacted by the proposed
project. Immediately east of Old Handley Ederville Road the proposed sewer
main will aerially span a washed section of the old Trinity River channel (Figure
6). The proposed sewer main will parallel the existing sewer main in this area.
This aerial construction will not create a negative visual impact on the bridge or
other cultural resources due to distance (over 75 meters) and sufficient
screening from native riparian vegetation.

Cultural Background

I-820 to Randol Mill Road
East of I-820 the project area follows Old Randol Mill Road east along the edge of
the uplands adjacent to the floodplain for approximately 1,450 feet (440 m)
before turning north onto COFW property and descending toward the floodplain
of the Trinity River. The project area along Randol Mill Road is heavily disturbed
by commercial and industrial development as well as utility installation; no tests
were excavated in this area. On the COFW property the proposed sewer main
follows an old paved road north to the floodplain (Figure 7). This paved road
leads around the west side of a former landfill and is heavily disturbed from
previous landfill activities and from erosion. In the southern half of this section
the paved road abuts the adjacent landfill. The proposed sewer main continues
along a low upland terrace behind an industrial facility and housing
development (Figure 8) before dropping into the floodplain. Beyond the housing
development the project area is entirely within a pasture in the floodplain until
intersecting with Randol Mill Road just west of Cooks Lane. This pasture area
has some minor development from horse and cattle pen construction and some
clearing/grading in advance of landowner initiated development however, the
impacts in this area appear to be limited and limited to the upper 30 cm (Figure
9).

Figure 7. Paved road on City of Fort Worth property. The old landfill is to the right
in the photo and the proposed sewer main will be installed between the road and
the fence at right.

A total of six trenches (BHT-2, BHT-3, BHT-4, BHT-10, BHT-11, and BHT-12)
and 17 shovel tests were excavated in this area. Shovel tests adjacent to the
landfill and behind the housing development were found to be shallow silty
loams overlying bedrock. In both of these areas the upper zone of sediment

consists of a thin strong brown to yellowish brown silty loam that does not
appear to be local, and is likely construction fill that has been redeposited from
the nearby developed areas (Figure 10). Behind the industrial facility the
project area overlays a small portion of the floodplain and tests in this area
contained deeper silty loams extending to at least one meter. To the east of the
housing development, in the floodplain, the soils become more clayey and
deeper. All of the tests were negative for cultural material. Tables 2 through 7
below show the profiles of the trenches in this portion of the project area and are
representative of the distribution of sediments.
Archeologists paid particular attention to portions of this segment that lay
closest to Site 41TR151 which is located approximately 300 m north of the
proposed sewer main. Despite two trenches and five shovel tests, no evidence of
this site was found within the proposed project area. It is likely limited to
portions of the landform farther north.

zone of strong brown sediment near the top of the trench profile.

Randol Mill Road
The proposed sewer main in this portion of the project area will be constructed
within the existing ROW of Randol Mill Road along the north side of the road
with the line being placed directly along the northern edge of the current
pavement. However, where Randol Mill Road turns sharply to the south, the
proposed sewer main will make a series of two 45-degree turn and will cross
over into private property for approximately 400 feet (120m). The ROW of
Randol Mill Road is very narrow (approximately 20 feet) in this portion of the
project area and there are drainage ditches on both sides of the road (Figure
11). In addition, utilities are present within the ROW consisting of electricity
and telephone distribution lines and the existing sewer main as well as fire
hydrants and extensive access drive crossings. Due to the heavy disturbance in
this area no subsurface testing was conducted except where the project area
crosses onto private property.

Figure 11. View of right-of-way of Randol Mill Road facing east. The proposed
sewer main will be installed on the north side (left) of the road.
Two backhoe trenches (BHT-13 and BHT-14) were excavated within the 400 feet
of the proposed sewer main that crosses onto private property. This area was
also relatively disturbed from clearing and grading, and appears to have been

used as a construction staging area (Figure 12). However, the trenching
revealed that soils below the ground surface were intact. Both trenches were
negative for cultural material. Given the close proximity of the backhoe trenches
in such a short accessible area, no shovel testing was conducted within this
portion of the proposed easement. While Backhoe Trench 14 was only excavated
to 262 cmbs due to a hydraulic hose breaking on the machine Trench 13
reached over 330 cm. The distribution of sediments within each of the trenches
is provided below in Tables 8 and 9.

Cultural Background

Randol Mill Road to the Eastern Terminus
This portion of the project area leaves the Randol Mill Road ROW and extends
east over relatively undisturbed pasture land and woods (Figure 13).
Disturbance was limited to minor improvements to the properties such as stock
tanks and terrace stabilization, as well as minor construction disturbance from
an adjacent golf course at the eastern terminus of the project area. The
proposed sewer main parallels and is adjacent to (generally within 20 feet/7m)
the existing sewer main for most of this area (Figures 14 and 15). The
investigators did not have right of entry to the western-most property
(approximately 500 feet of the project area) in this section, but a trench was
excavated close to the eastern boundary of the property. Additionally spotty
access was available to the eastern terminus (behind a newly-built housing
development) however the disturbed sloped uplands that compose this area
made trenching unnecessary.

A total of five backhoe trenches (BHT-5, BHT-6, BHT-7, BHT-8, and BHT-9) and
12 shovel tests were excavated within this section. All of these tests were
negative for cultural material. With the exception of BHT-5, all of the trenches
exhibited deep, silty clay sediments. The sediments in BHT-5 are silty loams
that increase in sand content with depth. Between BHT-8 and BHT-9 and at the
eastern terminus of the project area the proposed sewer main crosses over

Conclusions and Recommendations

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of the City of Fort Worth, Hicks & Company archeologists have
completed a linear, 100% pedestrian survey along approximately 32,000 feet
(9.7 km) of a proposed replacement M-253 sewer line in northeastern Fort
Worth, Texas. The majority of the project corridor traverses the Trinity River’s
southern floodplain. With a 30-foot overall construction and maintenance
easement width, archeologists investigated approximately 20.6 acres. A total of
32 shovel tests and 14 backhoe trenches were excavated in completion of the
survey with nearly one-third of the sewer line easement visually inspected only
due to extensive roadway and utility-related disturbance. None of the tests
excavated contained archeological features, artifacts or other evidence of
cultural resources, nor were any historic properties noted from ground surfaced
inspection.
Approximately 1,750 m (7.96 acres) of the proposed sewer main, on three
properties, could not be surveyed due to a lack of right of entry. Approximately
400 meters of these areas is heavily disturbed fill with no potential for intact
buried cultural deposits. The remaining 1,350 meters of non right of entry
properties are relatively intact and there is a potential for archeological deposits
to be present, however based on the overwhelmingly negative results of survey of
the entire project area, the close proximity of the existing M-253 line, the
supposed fill that composes portions of this area as well as subsurface testing
adjacent to these areas, that potential is low. While there is no subsurface
inspection to confirm this, it is very likely that there are no cultural resources
within areas that could not be surveyed directly, particularly within the project’s
depth of impact.
At this time, the City of Fort Worth plans to leave the existing M-253 sewer line
in place and fill its abandoned segments with cement through the existing
manholes. If this method is employed, this will result in no (or very minimal)
ground disturbance and potential impacts to subsurface deposits will likewise
be minimal.
Based on the results of extensive backhoe trenching, shovel testing, and surface
inspection regulatory clearance for the project to proceed relative to the City of
Fort Worth’s responsibilities under Section 106 of the NHPA and the TAC is
recommended with no historic properties affected.
This recommendation
includes both those portions of the survey corridor that were accessible and
those for which right of entry was denied. In the unlikely event that cultural
materials are found during construction, all work in the vicinity is recommended
to cease until such time as the THC can be contacted and a professional
archeologist can assess the finding and make recommendations for any future
action that may be required.
This report is offered in partial fulfillment of the requirement of TAC Permit
4859. Since no artifacts or sites were found during the course of survey, all
project-related materials will be maintained at Hicks & Company’s offices in
Austin, Texas.
