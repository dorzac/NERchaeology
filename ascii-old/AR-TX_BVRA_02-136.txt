ABSTRACT
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) conducted an archaeological survey of
a proposed water line for the New Water Supply Corporation (WSC) in San Augustine,
Sabine, and Shelby counties. Thirteen high probability areas were investigated through
shovel testing and surface inspection. The total length of the 13 areas is 4.3 miles with an
easement of 15 feet (7.8 acres). The field survey was conducted in April and May of 2004
under Antiquities Permit 3418 by William E. Moore and Edward P. Baxter (Project
Archaeologist). Although one previously recorded archaeological site (41SA8) is directly
within the path of the water line and seven others (41SA6, 41SA14, 41SA22, 41SA73,
41SA74, 41SY28, and 41SY29) are in the vicinity, no evidence of these sites was found,
and no new sites were recorded. Copies of the report are on file at the Texas Historical
Commission, Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), BVRA, J. F. Fontaine &
Associates, Inc., and New WSC. No artifacts were collected.

INTRODUCTION
New WSC plans to provide water to its customers by connecting 119.16 miles of
new water line and connections to customers in rural Sabine, San Augustine, and Shelby
counties (Figure 1). For convenience, the three separate proposed water supply line
routes were divided into three areas; Area A (37.2 miles), Area B (53.7 miles), and Area C
(28.26 miles). The areas examined during the archaeological survey is depicted on five
USGS 7.5' topographic maps. They are Chireno North (31094-421), Norwood (31094143), Patroon South (31093-322), San Augustine East (31094-411), and San Augustine
West (31094-412).
The new line will vary from 2" to 12" line in size and will be placed in ditches with
approximately 36" of cover. Therefore, the depth of the ditches will vary between 38" and
48" below the ground surface. There are no existing lines in place along any of the
proposed routes. The Federal agency involved with this project is the United States
Department of Agriculture, Rural Utility Services (RUS), and the agency representative is
Steve Kelley.
The plans for this project with accompanying maps were submitted by New WSC
through the engineering firm J. F. Fontaine & Associates, Inc. to the Texas Historical
Commission, Archeology Division for review. Realizing the potential for significant
archaeological sites in this part of East Texas, the request was made that the project plans
be reviewed by a professional archaeologist who can identify high probability areas that will
require formal archaeological survey. This request was made in a letter from F. Lawerence
Oaks (State Historic Preservation Officer) signed by William A. Martin and dated August 8,
2003. The letter also stated that any questions be directed to Debra L. Beene who will act
as the reviewer for this project.
BVRA was retained by New WSC through J. F. Fontaine & Associates, Inc.,
Consulting Engineers of Palestine, Texas, to conduct an archaeological assessment and
survey of the proposed water line. William E. Moore and Edward P. Baxter performed the
field assessment on December 27-28, 2003 (Moore 2004) under BVRA project number 0333. This assessment or "ground truthing" identified 32 high probability areas to be shovel
tested if affected by the route of the water supply line (Moore 2004). The client reviewed
our recommendations and made certain changes to the line to avoid potential
archaeological sites. Therefore, the number of areas surveyed was reduced to 13. William
E. Moore and Edward P. Baxter performed the survey on May 11-12 and 19-21, 2004
under Antiquities Permit 3418 and BVRA project number 04-09.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
General
Numerous archaeological investigations have been conducted in this part of East
Texas over a long time span. Most of the prior work in the vicinity of the project area has
consisted of small area surveys, many with negative results. The largest and most notable
project was the Toledo Bend Reservoir survey. Archaeological survey of the area was first
conducted by Arnold (1940), Scurlock and Davis (1962), and Scurlock (1964). Excavations
at sites believed to be significant were carried out in Louisiana by McClurkan et al. (1966)
and in Texas by Benham et al. (1973). Previous survey documented a high site density in
this part of Texas and Louisiana. Arnold (1940), for example, located 200 sites (25 within
the reservoir); Scurlock and Davis (1962) located an additional 100 sites; and Scurlock
(1964) found five new sites. These efforts reported that both Neo-American (Caddoan)
and Archaic complexes seemed to be well represented in the reservoir area. The
excavations by McClurkan et al. (1966) on the Louisiana side of the lake were performed at
Coral Snake Mound (16 SA 48), a burial mound associated with the Lower Mississippi
Valley cultures; the Salt Lick site (16 SA 37a), a Fulton Aspect site; the Eleven Ton Bridge
site (16 SA 37), also associated with the Fulton Aspect; and the Bison site (16 SA 30),
associated with the Gibson Aspect. According to McClurkan et al. (1966:75), the
excavated sites "demonstrated the presence of Caddoan peoples in the Toledo Bend
Reservoir area and the concentrated influence of the Lower Mississippi Valley cultures."
The three sites (X16SA101, X16SA17, and X41SY100) excavated by Benham et al.
(1973:i) revealed a "settlement system along the Sabine River that included small seasonal
villages as well as burial and mound sites."
It is beyond the scope of this negative report to present a detailed discussion of prior
work in the county. The TARL research, however, identified 39 archaeological sites near
the proposed water supply line route of 119.16 miles. Only eight sites are near the 13 high
probability areas surveyed during this study. The previously recorded sites in this area
appear to be restricted to sandy hills and terraces adjacent to major streams. A very
thorough discussion of the archaeology of East Texas including the three counties in the
project area is presented by Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993) in Archeology in the Eastern
Planning Region, Texas: A Planning Document.

Project Area
All of the previously recorded sites near the current project area were recorded in
1939 and 1940 by G. E. Arnold during his informal survey of East Texas (Arnold 1940).
Shovel testing was not conducted, and it is likely that many of the site boundaries are not
accurately plotted on TARL maps. When these sites were recorded by Arnold, field
numbers were often used, and the trinomials in use today were not available. Official site
numbers were later assigned by TARL staff in-house; however, this does not mean that all
of these sites have been field checked. Appendix I shows the location of these sites
showing their relative position to the project area.
In 2003, BVRA conducted a field assessment or "ground truthing" of the entire
119.16 mile water line as proposed by New WSC. This task involved a review of the
project area as depicted on the 11 topographic maps, a check of the site records at TARL
for the presence of previously recorded archaeological sites in or near the project area, and
a field assessment. All major creek crossings were visited and evaluated for their potential
to contain intact archaeological sites worthy of archaeological survey. In all, 32 high
probability areas were identified, and 39 previously recorded sites were found to be in the
vicinity of the project area. An assessment report was prepared by BVRA (Moore 2004)
and submitted to the Texas Historical Commission and J. F. Fontaine & Associates, Inc. for
review.

METHODS
Prior to conducting the field survey, Allegra Azulay, Records File Search Assistant
at TARL, conducted the background check for previously recorded sites within the route of
the project area and vicinity, and forms for those sites nearest the project area were
reviewed. After a consultation with Hollie H. Nowlin at J. F. Fontaine & Associates, Inc., it
was learned that many of the 32 high probability areas identified by the previous
assessment would be avoided. The number of areas considered worthy of survey was
reduced to 13. This reduction resulted in a marked decrease in the size of Area B.
Originally, 12 areas were recommended for survey in this area; however, the revised water
line resulted in only one area being surveyed.
The 13 areas were visited and evaluated through a surface inspection and shovel
testing. The survey was documented by field notes and digital photography. All areas with
archaeological sites recorded nearby were examined. This was done to make sure that
the site did not extend into the ROW. Since most of the sites had been recorded in 1939
and 1940 with no shovel testing, it was deemed important to examine all areas with nearby
sites.
As stated above, the three survey segments were designated as areas A-C, and
shovel tests were numbered accordingly. For example, Area A-2 received four shovel
tests, and they appear in the notes and on the Shovel Test Log (Appendix II) as 2-1
through 2-4 under the general heading of Area A. Shovel test locations and nearby sites
are depicted on USGS topographic maps in Appendix I. In all, 72 shovel tests were
excavated.
The location of the proposed water line and 13 areas investigated are depicted in
figures 2-4. In Area A, nine areas were surveyed (Figure 2); in Area B, one area was
surveyed (Figure 3); and in Area C, three areas were surveyed (Figure 4). The length of
the 13 areas is 4.3 miles with a 15 foot easement or ROW which can be calculated as 7.8
acres. Descriptions of the areas appear in the section entitled Description of Areas
Surveyed below. All shovel tests were dug to clay when possible, and the depth of the
tests varied between 10 and 100 cm.

DISCUSSION OF AREAS SURVEYED
Area A-2
This area (.17 mile) is depicted in Figure 2 as being situated along the southwest
side of a private drive. The ROW consisted of a borrow ditch and an upward slope to the
top edge of the ROW where a telephone line is buried. The slope of the ditch was shovel
tested with four tests, all negative. The shallow sand over clay is believed to have been
previously disturbed, and the road had been entrenched into the landscape through
successive grading.
Area A-3
This area (.3 mile) is depicted in Figure 2 as being situated on the northeast side of
County Road 226 within the ROW. The northwest end rises steeply from a low area to the
top of a prominent ridge. At this location, the road had cut through the high ground leaving
a ten foot high cutbank profile. The ROW edge ended at the top of the bank where the
telephone line is laid. Visibility in the area was estimated at 90%; therefore, an
examination of the cutbank profile was conducted. The remainder of the road was
entrenched from one to three feet deep. Four shovel tests were dug in the ditch and ditch
side. All were negative.
Area A-6
This area (.56 mile) is depicted in Figure 2 as being situated parallel to Farm Road
711 which crosses Black Creek. The ROW had been either cut or filled along the entire
survey route. Cutting varied from one foot to seven feet. The exposed cutbanks were
visually examined, and eight shovel tests were excavated - all negative. One test in the
low, wet clayey area by the creek had water in the first 10 cm. The proposed water line is
on the southwest side of the roadway on the southeast end of the project area. It crosses
the road to the northeast side for the remainder of the area.
Area A-8
This area (.17 mile) is depicted in Figure 2 as being situated within the ROW on the
north side of a county road. Successive grading has disturbed the area, and the roadbed
in the center section of this segment had been cut away about nine feet deep. The
resulting vertical bank had 90% visibility, and it was visually examined. Four tests were
excavated, two on the toe slope and two on the top of the hill. All were negative.

9

Area A-9
This area (.5 mile) is depicted in Figure 2 as roughly parallel to a small two-track
road across densely wooded terrain. The western end of the survey route was on a ridge
top that consisted of a lot of exposed bedrock, some gravels, clay, and very little sand.
Along the east slope of this feature, 50 cm of sand was encountered overlying the bedrock.
The remainder of the route had varying depths of sand. Six shovel tests were excavated,
all negative.
Area A-11
This area (.37 mile) is depicted in Figure 2 as being situated on the southwest side
of Farm-to-Market Road 3017 that crosses Sandy Creek. Site 41SA8 is reported to cross
the center of the survey route on the northwest side of the creek. The hill on the southeast
end of the survey area had been cut away for the roadbed to a depth ranging from one to
five feet. This left a profile that was carefully examined. One shovel test was placed at the
top edge of the ROW in a relatively undisturbed area. A second shovel test was placed at
the bottom of the hill along the creek. Two shovel tests were placed in the low area along
the creek where the site is reported. One additional shovel test was placed on the high
ground northeast of the site (SA8). All were negative. A scatter of what appeared to be
burned rock was observed, but further investigation revealed that it originated from road
base fill which had been transported in, resulting in isolated pieces being scattered along
the ROW. No artifacts, features, or other site indicators were observed within the disturbed
ROW.
Area A-12
This area (.34 mile) is depicted in Figure 2. The center of the area lies at the
intersection of Farm-to-Market Road 3017 and County Road 266. The proposed water line
is in the ROW of each road. It lies on the southeast side of Farm-to-Market Road 3017
and on the north side of County Road 266. Site 41SA6 lies to the southeast of the project
area. The Farm-to-Market Road 3017 ROW was a broad area with a ditch cut from one to
three feet into the center. The telephone line was at the edge of the ROW. A hill had been
cut away at the western end of the area. Four shovel tests were placed between the ditch
and the outside edge of the ROW. All were negative. The ROW along the north side of
County Road 266 was very narrow, and the road was entrenched. This ROW was across
the road from the recorded site on a lower landform. Standing water was observed in the
field just north of the ROW. Three shovel tests were placed between the ditch and the
telephone line at the top edge of the ROW. All were negative.

10

Area A-13
This area (.44 mile) is depicted in Figure 2. It was selected for survey because of
the presence of site 41SA14 in the vicinity. The survey area is located on the northeast
side of Farm-to-Market Road 711 on both sides of a small drainage. The high landforms
on both sides of the creek had been cut from one to four feet, and the low areas had been
filled to four feet. The bank profiles offered visibility from 20% to 80% and were examined.
Six shovel tests were excavated along the cut areas on each side of the road. All were
negative.
Area A-14
This area (.3 mile) is depicted in Figure 2 as being situated at the intersection of
Farm-to-Market Road 711 and Farm-to-Market Road 3017. It was selected for survey
because of its proximity to site 41SA22. The route runs along the northeast side of Farmto-Market Road 711 and the southeast side of Farm-to-Market Road 3017. Both sides
have a buried telephone line along the outside of the ROW. The rest of the ROW
consisted of ditch and slope. Another buried utility was present in the center of the County
Road 3017 ROW. Eight shovel tests were excavated in the ROW along the slope. Six of
the tests were excavated to 100 cm through sand. The other two, on the extreme
southeast end of Farm Road 711, were shallow sand over clay. All were negative.
Area B-12
This area (.4 mile) is depicted in Figure 3 as following the northwestern ROW of
State Highway 417 just south of the community of Union Grove. The area was selected for
survey because of its proximity to sites 41SA73, 41SA74, and 41SA75. The northern end
of the project area consisted of a low, small drainage that was either in standing water or
contained at least four feet of fill. The upland portion on the south side of this drainage
consisted of exposed clay, gravels, and bedrock. Further south, on the high land between
drainages, five shovel tests were excavated in the ROW slope. All were negative. This
area was disturbed by cutting and grading activities, and a buried utility line was observed.
The survey area ended at the northern bank of Black Slough.
Area C-1
This area (.2 mile) is depicted in Figure 4 as being situated on the east side of an
unnamed county road on an upland ridge overlooking Lobanilla Creek. The road was
deeply entrenched over much of the survey route. This created a vertical bank that
extended to the edge of the ROW where a telephone line was buried. The bank had 80%
to 90% visibility. Along selected areas of the bank, a profile column was dug out and
11

screened. Where the entrenchment was not so pronounced, five shovel tests were
excavated. All were negative.
Area C-2
This area (.25 mile) is depicted in Figure 4 as being situated in the Sabine National
Forest along the eastern side of State Highway 330 and the south side of an unnamed
county road. The route crosses a tributary of Colorow Creek. Both sides of this tributary
were examined. Ongoing road and bridge construction within the entirety of the survey
area had recently exposed most of the ROW. The two high banks within the ROW had
been previously cut four to five feet revealing shallow sand over a clay profile that was
examined. Five shovel tests were excavated, all negative.
Area C-6
This area (.3 mile) is depicted in Figure 4 as being along Farm Road 1279 that
crosses Mill Creek. It was selected for survey because of the proximity of sites 41SY28
and 41SY29. The two recorded sites are located on easily visible landforms away from the
survey area. The survey was conducted in the north ROW between the ditch and a buried
telephone cable at the edge of the ROW. Five shovel tests were excavated, all negative.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
A check of the site records at TARL revealed 39 archaeological sites have been
recorded within 1/2 km of the route of the 119.16 water supply line. Of concern here are
those sites that are in close proximity to the 13 areas selected for survey based on the
previous assessment and project plans by the client.
One prehistoric site (41SA8) is directly within the path of the water supply line as
currently proposed. Seven prehistoric sites (41SA6, 41SA14, 41SA22, 41SA73, 41SA75.
41SY28, and 41SY29) are in close proximity to the water line route. These sites were
recorded in 1940 by G. E. Arnold during an informal survey of East Texas. Shovel testing
was probably not conducted. Therefore, the actual site boundaries as plotted on the TARL
maps may not be completely accurate. The location of these sites are presented in
Appendix I. Overall, the water line route was found to be very disturbed, and no evidence
of the above-mentioned sites was found. Historic structures and cemeteries are present
throughout the project area but outside the ROW. Therefore, they will not be affected by
the water supply line as currently planned.
The roads in the project area are often narrow and unpaved. It is not uncommon for
a road grade to be cut through hills. This created much disturbance to the landscape and,
in many cases, lowered the road to an elevation well into the clay soils that underlie the
sandy mantle near the surface. The excellent exposure created by these road cuts often
showed a very shallow sandy mantle overlying clay (see cover). This allowed the
researchers conducting the assessment to eliminate several areas from consideration for
survey. Much of the line traverses slopes of hills and upland ridges quite far from major
streams. The areas selected for survey are mainly on private property outside the
disturbed highway ROW. Although many locations on the topographic maps appear to be
high probability areas for significant archaeological sites, the field assessment proved this
to be incorrect. Many creek crossings were not recommended for survey because of
disturbance such as road construction, existing utilities, or erosion. Some hills are too far
from a water source to be viewed as likely settings for significant archaeological sites..
The "Minimum Survey Standards" for project areas of 200 acres or less were
followed during this project.

13

RECOMMENDATIONS
Thirteen locations were surveyed during this project. No evidence of previously
recorded archaeological sites was found, and no new sites were recorded. It is, therefore,
recommended that New WSC be allowed to proceed with construction as planned. It is
always possible that areas containing cultural resources are missed during any
archaeological survey. Should any evidence of an archaeological site be encountered
during construction of the proposed water line, work in the area of the find should cease
until the situation can be evaluated by the Texas Historical Commission in consultation with
BVRA and New WSC. Originally, BVRA identified 32 areas for survey depending on the
eventual placement of the water line. Should New WSC move its route to another side of
the road or onto private property, it is recommended that these areas be re-evaluated for
survey.
