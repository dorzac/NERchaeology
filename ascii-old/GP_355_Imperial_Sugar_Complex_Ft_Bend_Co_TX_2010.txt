ABSTRACT

HRA Gray & Pape, LLC, of Houston, Texas, performed an intensive pedestrian
survey and deep testing of 301 hectares (743 acres) of privately owned property proposed for
commercial and residential development in Fort Bend County, Texas. The United States
Army Corps of Engineers, Galveston District is the Lead Federal Agency. This project is
being conducted at the request of Berg Oliver Associates, Inc. on behalf of Johnson
Development Corporation and Cherokee Investment Partners LLC in order to fulfill
requirements set forth by 33 CFR Part 325, Appendix C - Procedures for the Protection of
Historic Properties. This Appendix establishes the procedures to be followed by the USACE
to fulfill the requirements set forth by 36 CFR Part 800 of the National Historic Preservation
Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended.
For this project, the “Permit Area” and the “Area of Potential Effect” are defined as
301 hectares (743 acres) of property in which the permitted action is to take place. Since the
Lead Federal Agency is the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Galveston District, the
term “Permit Area” is used in this report. For this project, anticipated impacts are generally
less than 1 meter (3 feet) over most of the tract but may be up to 3 meters (9 feet) where deep
impacts are required. Detailed maps depicting the exact locations of the anticipated deep
impacts within the permit area have not been provided.
A previously conducted reconnaissance survey of approximately 223 hectares (550
acres) of the 301-hectare (743-acre) permit area resulted in the identification of Site
41FB284, a 1910 – 1960s prison camp and stockyard (Carpenter 2001). Per a request by the
Texas Historical Commission and the United States Army Corps of Engineers, HRA Gray &
Pape, LLC subjected the entire 301-hectare (743-acre) permit area to an intensive pedestrian
survey supplemented with targeted mechanical deep testing.
As a result of the archaeological investigation, Site 41FB284 was revisited and is
recommended as ineligible for the National Register of Historic Places. Newly recorded
archaeological sites include 3 historic sites, (41FB316, 41FB317, and 41FB318). Other
resources recorded include 6 archaeological loci. Site trinomials were not sought for the loci.
Finally, a total of 18 architectural resources were identified, not including the structures
associated with the Imperial Sugar plant. These include 2 historic landscape features and 16
historic-age standing structures associated with the “Three Camp” of the Central Texas State
Prison Farm. These architectural findings and the architectural survey results of the Imperial
Sugar plant are documented in the architecture report prepared by Lena Sweeten and Tom W.
McKinney, PhD with contributions by Kristi Soltysiak (2008).
HRA Gray & Pape, LLC recommends no further archaeological work be required at
Site 41FB316 or at the 6 isolated archaeological loci. Sites 41FB317 and 41FB318 require
additional investigation to evaluate their National Register eligibility. HRA Gray & Pape,
LLC recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for the remainder of the permit
area and that the project be cleared to proceed as planned in these areas.

CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION

Between November of 2006 and February of 2008, HRA Gray & Pape, LLC (HRA
Gray & Pape), at the request of Berg Oliver Associates, Inc., on behalf of Johnson
Development Corporation and Cherokee Investment Partners LLC, conducted intensive
pedestrian archaeological investigations and deep testing on 301 hectares (743 acres) of
privately owned property proposed for commercial and residential development in the city of
Sugarland in Fort Bend County, Texas.
The Lead Federal Agency for this project has been identified as the United States
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Galveston District. The project is being conducted in
order to comply with the USACE permitting requirements and to fulfill requirements set
forth by 33 CFR Part 325, Appendix C - Procedures for the Protection of Historic Properties.
This Appendix establishes the procedures to be followed by the USACE to fulfill the
requirements set forth by 36 CFR Part 800 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA)
of 1966, as amended.
For this project, the “Permit Area” and the “Area of Potential Effect” are defined as
301 hectares (743 acres) of property in which the permitted action is to take place. Since the
Lead Federal Agency is the USACE, Galveston District, the term “Permit Area” is used in
this report. For this project, anticipated impacts are generally less than 1 meter (3 feet) over
most of the tract but may be up to 3 meters (9 feet) where deep impacts are required. Detailed
maps depicting the exact locations of the anticipated deep impacts within the permit area
have not been provided.
The Texas General Land Office (GLO) conducted a reconnaissance survey of
approximately 223 hectares (550 acres) of the 301-hectare (743-acre) project area, which
resulted in the identification of Site 41FB284, a 1910 – 1960s prison camp and stockyard
(Carpenter 2001). The Texas Historical Commission (THC) and the USACE determined that
the GLO survey was inadequate given the dynamic history of the area. Per a request by the
THC and USACE, HRA Gray & Pape subjected the entire 301-hectare (743-acre) property to
an intensive pedestrian survey supplemented with mechanical deep testing.
Fieldwork and reporting activities were completed with reference to state (the Texas
Council of Archeologists) and federal NHPA guidelines. Fieldwork required approximately
760 person hours to complete.

PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION
The project area is located on the Sugar Land and Clodine United States Geological

Figure 1

(U.S.) Highway 90 Alternate (ALT 90) and Voss Road, east of Highway 6 in the city of
Sugarland in Fort Bend County, Texas. The area consists primarily of low-lying topography
in the Brazos River floodplain bisected by several meanders of Oyster Creek. The low
topography has given rise to several large wetlands scattered across the northwestern section
of the project area in proximity to Gannoway Lake. Short pasture grasses and thick riparian
growth along Oyster Creek comprise the majority of the project area.
Disturbances within the project area include previous agricultural activities, previous
pipeline installation, previous berm construction, railroad construction, creek channalization,
irrigation ditches, and dirt roads. The southwestern corner of the project area has also been
overlain with approximately 1 meter (3 feet) of sugar extract produced during previous sugar
refining activities associated with the now non-operational Imperial Sugar refinery (Martha
H. Martin, PE, personal communication 2008).

CHAPTER II. GEOMORPHOLOGY & SOILS

The Texas Coastal Plain is part of the larger Gulf Coastal Plain. The coastal plain is
characterized by a low topographic relief and extends from Florida to Mexico. The Texas
Coastal Plain reaches as far north as the Ouachita uplift in Oklahoma, and as far west as the
Balcones escarpment in central Texas. The basic geomorphologic characteristics of the
Texas coast and associated inland areas, which includes Fort Bend County, resulted from
depositional conditions influenced by the combined action of sea level changes from glacial
advance in the northern portions of the continent, and subsequent downcutting and variations
in the sediment load capacity of the region’s rivers. Fort Bend County is underlain by
relatively recent sedimentary rocks and unconsolidated sediments ranging in age from the
Pleistocene to the Holocene (Abbott 2001; Barnes 1992; Mowery et al. 1960; Van Siclen
1991).
Although older geologic units (see Abbott 2001; Barnes 1982; Van Siclen 1991),
units relevant to the study of long-term human occupation surrounding the project area
include the Beaumont Formation, are generally believed to predate human occupation, and
the so-called “Deweyville” terraces, positioned stratigraphically between the Beaumont and
Recent deposits. These terraces date to between one hundred thousand to four thousand
years ago, and are characterized as consisting “of up to 3 inset fluvial
terraces…(distinguished by the presence of)…large looping meander scars…” indicative of
watercourses capable of fluvial action and discharge markedly greater than that seen today
(Abbott 2001:16). Overlaying these deposits may be relatively thick or thin Holocene
deposits, laid down in the areas by alluvial or eolian factors, or potentially, marshy
environments (Aronow 2005).
Along smaller rivers, such as the San Jacinto and Trinity, valley infilling has not
advanced to the point where these “Deweyville” formations are completely buried by
Holocene sediments. Consequently, remnants of these deposits are preserved as terraces that
are situated between modern floodplain and upland areas. These terraces would have been
relatively elevated with dry surfaces within the valleys until they were covered by aggrading
overbank deposits (Abbott 2001:16). Given their physical characteristics, the “Deweyville”
terraces may have been attractive loci for human occupation during the Holocene. While
primary “Deweyville” deposits have a low potential for archaeological remains, the age of
these formations are not clearly established. Therefore, the possibility for buried
archaeological remains exists within portions of the “Deweyville” formation (Abbott
2001:106).
Meandering through much of the project area, Oyster Creek occupies a paleochannel
of the Brazos River of which Oyster Creek is currently a tributary. A cutoff upstream
approximately 500 to 1500 years ago resulted in the Brazos shifting its channel further south.
As a result of this avulsion the confluence of the 2 streams is now located in Fort Bend
downstream from the project area (Abbott 2001:106-126).

Oyster Creek is a meandering perennial stream prone to occasional flooding (Abbott
2001:123-124). Typical cross-sections of Oyster Creek in the area reveal levee and
floodbasin assemblages on the outer side of meander loops, and point bar deposits in the
interiors of meander loops (Abbot 2001:123). This natural pattern, which is typical of
streams developing on broad low floodplains (Bloom 1978:234-239) is also characterized by
oxbow lakes and cutoff meanders, which are visible along Oyster Creek in and around the
project area.

SOILS MAPPED IN THE PROJECT AREA
Soil units in the project area are mapped as Norwood silt loam, Norwood silty clay
loam, Norwood clay, Miller clay, Miller silty clay loam, and Bernard-Edna complex clay.
The Norwood and Miller soils make up the alluvium found in the majority of the project
area. Norwood soils are calcareous, nearly level soils found on the floodplain of the Brazos
River, while the Miller soils consist of reddish-brown calcareous bottomland soils with a
heavy substratum (Mowery et al. 1960). According to Abbott (2001:21), these soil series
have a high to very high geoarchaeological potential for containing buried cultural resources.
Both of these soils series have the potential to contain deeply buried paleosols, which are
often associated with small, ephemeral prehistoric archaeological sites.
The Bernard-Edna complex makes up the small northern section of the project area
located on the Beaumont Formation. The Bernard soils are found on prairies and are not very
well drained. The Edna soils that make up the soil complex are sandy and crusty with
blocky, compact subsoil. They occur on gently sloping areas (Mowery et al. 1960).
According to Abbott (2001:22,23), these soils have low geoarchaeological potential for
containing buried resources.

CHAPTER III. CULTURAL SETTING

PREHISTORY
Most sites near the coast between the Brazos River and Sabine Lake consist of
middens of clams found in estuaries or exposed in cutbanks along streams (Aten 1983;
Patterson 1985). These middens usually contain faunal material as well as cultural remains
such as lithic tools and pottery. Inland sites are less likely to consist of middens and are
more similar to generalized open campsites. In both areas, sites are found near stream
channels.
Addicks Reservoir was one of the earliest projects conducted in the area (Wheat
1953). The research done during that project initialized the formation of the Galveston Bay
Focus and the development of a cultural sequence of the region based on lithics and ceramics
(Aten 1983). Aten (1983) and Story (1990) have aptly described the cultural context of the
upper coastal region. This information is merged with the archaeological data here to give a
complete picture of life on the Upper Texas Coast.
Along the Upper Texas Coast, the Paleo-Indian period begins around 12,000 B.P. and
ends near 9000 B.P. (Aten 1983; Story 1990). This period is poorly represented in the
archaeological evidence for the region (Aten 1983) and no sites for this period have been
verified. Isolated artifacts include Clovis, Angostura, Scottsbluff, Meserve, Plainview, and
Golondrina point types (Aten 1983). Sites from this stage would be either buried by
alluvium or found in upland sites.
The Transitional Archaic period begins about 9000 B.P. and ends around 7500 B.P.
(Aten 1983; Story 1990). This stage is also poorly represented in the archaeological work in
the area but isolated finds of Bell/Calf Creek, Early-Side Notched, and Early Expanding
Stemmed dart points are attributed to this time period. The Archaic stage is thought to
include a shift towards a diet more geared towards plant processing but still includes hunting.
Plant processing technology seen during the entire Archaic period includes stone-lined
hearths and baking pits as well as milling tools (Story 1990). Groups began to travel over
less of the landscape and population density seems to have risen.
Beginning at 7500 B.P. and spanning 2500 years (Aten 1983), the Early Archaic
period in this region has not been well documented. The sites may have been destroyed or
deeply buried (Aten 1983; Story 1990). In situ Early Archaic remains have been found at the
Addicks Reservoir as well as other localities in the area (Story 1990). Points from this period
include Bell, Carrollton, Trinity, Wells, and Early Stemmed. It is possible that the
Carrollton, Trinity, and Wells points continued to be used into the middle Archaic (Patterson
1996).

6

The Middle Archaic period (5000 to 3000 B.P.) reveals the earliest surviving shell
middens (Aten 1983). These middens often contain remains of shellfish, such as oysters and
estuarine clams, faunal material from terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates, and the earliest
known human burials in the region (Aten 1983). Characteristic projectile points include
Bulverde, Williams, Lange, and Pedernales types.
The Late Archaic lasted from 3000 to 2000 B.P. and shows evidence for population
increase (Aten 1983). By 2500 B.P., the climate in this area was essentially like the modern
climate. Ground stone artifacts made from materials from southwestern Arkansas and found
in context with human burials in cemeteries such as the Ernest Witte Site indicate the
possibility of trade (Hall 1981). Projectile points differ from earlier periods in that they are
corner-notched or expanding-stemmed forms, such as the Kent, Ellis, and Pontchartrain
types. Other types can be found, such as the un-notched Pamillas. These types are thought
to precede the Gary type, which can be found into the Late Prehistoric (Story 1990). During
the Late Archaic, more utilitarian biface tools are prevalent as well as are bone tools. Late
Archaic assemblages are very similar to the early part of the Late Prehistoric stage (Aten
1983).
The transition from the Late Archaic stage to the Late Prehistoric is indicated by the
introduction of ceramics into the assemblage (Aten 1983). Cultural shifts during the Late
Prehistoric include the possible adoption of a more sedentary lifestyle and major
technological changes, such as sandy paste ceramics and late in the stage, the bow and arrow
(Story 1990). The cultural tradition during the Late Prehistoric along the Upper Gulf Coast
has been designated as Woodland. Story (1990) has suggested the use of the term Mossy
Grove Tradition to define cultural patterns of the region. The Trinity River seems to be a
dividing line in this tradition with cultures east of the river being more similar to those in
Louisiana than to those west of Galveston Bay. The eastern tradition also seems to have
begun earlier than that in the west, beginning about 2000 B.P. and lasting 600 years (Aten
1983; Story 1990).
Story (1990) splits the Mossy Grove Tradition into 5 distinct time intervals on the
coast, while noting that only 2 are found inland. Aten (1983) defined these intervals for the
area between the Brazos River and Galveston Bay as the Clear Lake (1850-1525 B.P.),
Mayes Island (1525-1300 B.P.), Turtle Bay (1300-950 B.P.), Round Lake (950-600 B.P.),
and Old River (600-250 B.P.) periods based on ceramic styles. Only the Round Lake period
is recognized by Aten for the West Bay-Brazos Delta due to the low artifact class diversity
compared to areas east of Galveston Bay as well as a time discrepancy in which equivalent
periods are later in time than those to the east (Aten 1983).
Early ceramics from this area are similar to Tchefuncte period wares found near
Sabine Lake and into Louisiana and include sandy paste varieties such as Mandeville Plain,
Goose Creek Plain (Anahuac variety), and Tchefuncte Plain (Aten 1983; Story 1990). These
early sites appear similar to pre-ceramic sites due to the low number of ceramic sherds found.
The appearance of sandy paste and sand-tempering occurs about 1900 B.P. with the O’Neal
Plain (variety Conway) being a good example (Aten 1983). Rocker-stamped decorations, a
distinctive marker for this period, are uncommon in the West Bay-Brazos Delta, as are
incised wares (Aten 1983).
7

The Mayes Island period brought about the introduction of the bow and arrow, which
was probably used along with the atlatl until the historic period (Aten 1983; Story 1990).
The arrow points during this period included both notched and expanding-stemmed forms
(Aten 1983; Story 1990).
Ceramic indicators for the Turtle Bay period include Goose Creek red-filmed along
with other decorated ceramics, all of which are rare in the West Bay-Brazos Delta area. At
the beginning of the Round Lake period, the earliest use of grog or large crushed ceramic
particles as tempering agents is seen. Typical varieties include Baytown Plain (variety San
Jacinto) and San Jacinto Incised. Along with these types, a reduction in Goose Creek types is
seen. Aten (1983) describes this period as having an increase in population due to the larger
number of sites in more specialized locations.
During the Old River period, a resurgence of Goose Creek ceramics is seen as the
Baytown types decrease in popularity. Contact with Europeans begins near the end of this
period, but visible changes in material culture are not seen until about A.D. 1750 along with
a rapid decline in population (Story 1990).

SPANISH AND FRENCH EXPLORATION AND COLONIZATION
The historic period began in the sixteenth century with the first Spanish coastline
explorations. It was during this period that the 1527 – 28 expedition fleet of Panfilo de
Narvaez’s was caught in a storm, leaving Cabeza de Vaca and a small group of castaways
marooned on the Isle of Misfortune, an unspecified island near Galveston, in 1528. The
group provided the first ethnohistorical accounts of the region’s inhabitants.
La Salle’s ill-fated French expedition in 1685 explored the area around Matagorda
Bay and established Fort St. Louis near Garcitas Creek. La Salle had originally intended to
explore and colonize along the Mississippi River but the French ships made a critical mistake
in his navigation. La Salle’s fleet lost a supply ship while en route, and another ran aground
in Matagorda Bay. His men made enemies of the local Native American population by
shooting at them when the Native Americans attempted to take the French supplies from the
wrecked ship. La Salle’s fleet was further diminished when part of his disgruntled crew took
one of his remaining ships back to France. He lost the last ship in April of 1686 when its
drunken pilot sank it. La Salle and his remaining men attempted to journey to the French
Colonies around the Great Lakes, but none of them would survive. La Salle himself was
killed by Pierre Duhaut, one of several mutineers, near Navasota, Texas, in March of 1687,
and his body was left for the animals to eat. Six of the seventeen who had left Fort St. Louis
with La Salle continued to Canada and, eventually, France. Six other Frenchmen, including
2 deserters who had reappeared, remained among the East Texas Indians.
At Fort St. Louis La Salle had left hardly more than twenty persons, with the crippled
Gabriel Minime, Sieur de Barbier, in charge. They consisted of women and children, the
physically handicapped, and those who for one reason or another had incurred La Salle's
disfavor. The Indians, learning of La Salle's death and the disunity among the French,
8

attacked the settlement by surprise around Christmas 1688, sparing only the children
(Weddle 2007).
AUSTIN’S COLONY AND THE “OLD 300”
La Salle’s tragic expedition marks the only French attempt to colonize the area, which
remained in Spanish hands until 1821. The Adams-Onís Treaty of 1819 demarcated the
western boundary of the Louisiana Purchase as well as the eastern and some of the northern
boundary of the future State of Texas. In an effort to settle Texas, the Spanish issued a grant
to Moses Austin in 1820-21. Moses Austin died from pneumonia in June of 1821, and his
son, Stephen F. Austin, carried on his colonization efforts in Texas. Austin’s plans were
interrupted for several years during the Mexican War for Independence, but he did finally
receive the first land grants in 1824. Austin and his colonists, referred to as the “Old 300”,
settled along the Brazos River from 1821 to 1824.
The current project area lies in Stephen F. Austin’s first grant and within his original
hacienda, a five-league grant. Since Austin did not occupy the area, it was declared forfeit
under Mexican law, and later patented in 1827 and 1828 by Jane Wilkins, Jesse Cartwright,
Mills M. Battle, Alexander Hodge, and S. M. Williams. The project area lies on what was
Alexander Hodge’s league, which was patented on April 12, 1828.

ALEXANDER HODGE
Alexander Hodge was born in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, in 1760. He
fought in the American Revolution alongside his brother under the command of General
Francis “the Swamp Fox” Marion in South Carolina (Carpenter 2001: 11). Hodge, as
mentioned above, patented a league of land in the current project area in 1828, after living in
what is now Georgia, Kentucky and Arkansas. He, his wife, and their 7 children settled on
their league of land along the banks of Oyster Creek. Their home site became known as
“Hodge’s Bend,” the exact site of which has yet to be discovered.
Hodge was active in the community, serving as alcalde and commisario, and his
home became “a judicial, political and commercial way station for the district,” and was
often visited by a number of prominent figures. Hodge, like many in the area, was involved
in agricultural pursuits including the raising of horses, cattle and cotton. Despite the
importance of Hodge and his residence, there is very little historical material discussing his
role in the community, nor materials relating to the location of his home (Carpenter 2001:
12).
In 1831, Hodge’s wife died of cholera. Hodge had a cedar tree brought all the way
from Bastrop to plant near her gravesite, as he believed it symbolized eternal life. Hodge’s
Bend Cemetery is an historic graveyard, and there is a cedar tree near his wife’s grave
although it is impossible to determine if this is the one that Hodge planted (Carpenter
2001:12). The graveyard is located well outside the project area as it is located off of the Old
Richmond Road on the northern shore of White Lake.

9

Hodge was known to raise fine horses, and he supplied many of these animals to the
Texas Army during the Texas Revolution (1835– 1836). Several of Hodge’s sons also
fought in the conflict. In the months preceding the war, Deaf Smith warned Hodge of
Mexican spies posing as horse buyers in the area attempting to gauge the political sympathies
of the population. One of the Mexican agents attended a barbeque at Hodge’s Bend, which
was also attended by William B. Travis and James Bonham. Deaf Smith’s warning was
heeded, and political discussions were politely skirted (Carpenter 2001:12).
On March 11, 1836 Sam Houston was informed of the fall of the Alamo. On March
13, 1836 Susannah Dickinson made her way to Gonzales after being released by the Mexican
Army in San Antonio. Deaf Smith, Henry Wax Karnes and R. E. Handy found Mrs.
Dickinson. Karnes hurried back to tell Houston of the news. Houston decided to retreat, and
he asked Henry Karnes to burn Gonzales to prevent the Mexicans from finding anything they
could use in the war. The retreat of Houston and the Texian Army left settlements
unprotected.
Settlers soon heard of the fall of the Alamo, the retreat of Houston and an order by
Santa Anna to kill all settlers. The settlers left everything and made their way to the Sabine
River and safety in the United States. The flight was marked by lack of preparation and by
panic caused by fear of both the Mexican Army and of Indians. Despite his age of 76 years,
Hodge valiantly led women, children and slaves away from the advancing Mexican Army in
April of 1836. This exodus, know as the “Runaway Scrape,” led Hodge and his fellow
evacuees toward the Sabine River (Covington 2007).
The spring of 1836 was wet, and many roads were washed away. The rain, cold and
lack of food and shelter made the settlers susceptible to many diseases such as whooping
cough and dysentery. Many persons died and were buried where they fell. They also faced
outlaws and looters who wanted what little the settlers may have fled with. Deaf Smith told
the Hodge’s party to head toward Buffalo Bayou as they were moving toward the Battle of
San Jacinto, of which the party was well within earshot. Hodge passed away on August 17,
1836 and was interred next to his wife in Hodge’s Bend Cemetery (Carpenter 2001:14).

SUGAR CANE PLANTATION & IMPERIAL SUGAR
Sugar production in Austin’s Colony dates back to the 1820s, and the first attempts at
commercial production of refined sugar began in the 1840s. Sugar production in Texas was
centered on Wharton, Matagorda, Brazoria and Fort Bend Counties. The abolition of slavery
necessitated a new labor system after the Civil War. Unlike Louisiana, where most of the
sugar plantations were worked by wage labor, Texas relied on the convict lease system. In
1882, twelve of the eighteen Texas sugar plantations utilized 800, or more than one-third, of
the state's prison inmates. The cost per worker actually exceeded the prevailing wage scale,
but the labor force, as under slavery, was constant and guaranteed (Wilke 2007).
After Alexander Hodge’s death, his five-league land grant was subdivided among his
heirs. In 1843, Nathaniel and Matthew Williams constructed a raw sugar mill “within a
stone’s throw of Oyster Creek and unknowingly established the site of the future Imperial
10

Sugar Company” (Armstrong 2000:9). Nathaniel and Matthew operated the property for
their eldest brother, Samuel May Williams, which was called the Oakland Plantation.
Samuel May Williams fled New Orleans for Texas in May of 1822, leaving several unpaid
debts in his wake. Williams, who was fluent in Spanish from a previous business venture in
South America, served Stephen F. Austin as his clerk. Williams kept records and surveys in
both Spanish and English and provided Austin with advice in his dealings with the Mexican
government. Austin repaid Williams with a league of land on Oyster Creek in present-day
Fort Bend County. The Williams’ used slave labor to cultivate sugar cane. Matthew died on
October 10, 1852, and Nathaniel sold the property a year later to the partnership of William
Jefferson Kyle and Benjamin Franklin Terry (Armstrong 2000:11). Kyle and Terry made
their fortunes in the California Gold Rush of 1849, and returned to Texas in 1852. The two
men bought Oakland Plantation and all improvements in two purchases from Nathaniel
Williams (Armstrong 2000:13). They changed the name from the Oakland Plantation to the
Sugar Land Plantation, and began buying up many of the surrounding properties. Eventually
their holdings were 5,059 hectares (12,500 acres) of the William Little, George Brown,
Charles Belknap, Alexander Hodge, J. Hodge, Elijah Alcorn, and the William Stafford
Leagues. They were said to have one of the biggest plantations in the state (Armstrong
2000:13).
The partners modernized the Williams sugar mill and potentially built a second mill
to ensure against fire. They persuaded the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos, and Colorado Railroad to
build their holdings by offering free land, a step which optimized the value of their lands by
making it commercially viable and encouraged the development of Sugar Land (Armstrong
2000: 14 -16). Both men served in the Civil War. Terry was killed in Kentucky. He left his
lands to be managed by Kyle, who did so until his death in 1864 (Armstrong 2000:20). Their
heirs were able to maintain the plantation during Reconstruction, but they began selling off
portions of it to Col. Edward H. Cunningham in 1882 (Armstrong 2000:22).
Cunningham formed a partnership in 1875 with Colonel Littleberry Ambrose Ellis.
Ellis and Cunningham had both served as officers in Hood’s Brigade during the Civil War,
and had turned to the fields of Fort Bend County to make their postwar fortunes (Armstrong
2000:25). Cunningham bought 4 more plantations, and by 1890 he had reconsolidated the
former Kyle and Terry properties on which he grew sugar cane. Ellis owned a 2,145-hectare
(5,300-acre) tract that he named “Sartartia” after his eldest daughter. In 1879, Cunningham
leased convicts for 5 years from the State of Texas to work his lands. By the following year,
the pair had 365 convicts working in their fields (Armstrong 2000:25). Their success
brought a response from the state, which decided to start convict farming (Wallingford
1996:117). The two continued to buy land in Fort Bend County and began successful careers
in convict farming on a grand scale. By 1900, Cunningham’s lands were worked by the
largest convict population in the State of Texas (Armstrong 2000:25).
In 1880, Cunningham had invested over one million dollars into the property by
building a paper mill, new buildings, homes for his workers and adding new machinery to
create a sugar refinery that was considered the finest in the southern states (Wallingford
1996: 44-45). He also laid 7 miles of private railroad track to connect his sugar mill and
industrial complex with the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway at Duke and the
International and Great Northern at Arcola. This private line, which Cunningham called the
11

Sugar Land Railroad, ran along Oyster Creek through all the main sugar lands (Wallingford
1996:116).
Cunningham and Ellis’s partnership continued to flourish, and in 1883 they combined
their acreage and constructed a 600-ton raw sugar mill 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) west of the
Cunningham mill. They called it the “Imperial Mill”. By this time, the pair had 8,094
hectares (20,000) acres under cultivation. The partners also converted some of the old
plantation buildings into a makeshift company town. The two maintained roughly 300
convicts to work in the fields, and they constructed barracks for their leased hands on the
southern part of their property. They used transient seasonal labor to man their mill, and
Cunningham ran a commissary to provide for their basic needs. Workers lived in hastilybuilt shacks, or in the fields (Armstrong 2000:26).
The partners continued to modernize and expand their holdings. In 1893, the 11­
kilometer (7-mile) private railroad was expanded to fourteen miles and officially chartered as
the Sugar Land Railroad Company. The railroad was used to haul sugar cane from the fields
to the mill, and to haul processed sugar from the mill to its connections with the Santa Fe at
Duke and with the International and Great Northern at Arcola. Cunningham also constructed
a narrow gauge railroad some twelve miles west of Sugar Land to the Brazos River just north
of Richmond. This railroad was chartered as the Imperial Valley Railroad, and was
abandoned because of the decline in local sugar cane growing in 1926 (Armstrong 2000:28).
The production of sugar also encouraged the partners to invest in other businesses,
which in turn required the addition of new infrastructure to service these affiliated industries.
Cunningham formed the Sugar Land Manufacturing Company, which produced paper from
sugar cane stalks (Armstrong 2000:29-30).
New industries such as the Sugar Land Manufacturing Company highlight the
partner’s need for a reliable source of water, as water was needed not only for their industrial
pursuits, but also for their expanding rail transportation business. Oyster Creek became
heavily modified to supply the industry with the water it needed. To ensure a steady supply
of water, Cunningham and Ellis began pumping water out of the Brazos River and dug a
canal from the Brazos to Oyster Creek at the terminus of the Imperial Valley Railroad. The
two also oversaw the construction of a series of dams above and below Sugar Land to
maintain an adequate supply of water for the industries at Sugar Land (Armstrong 2000:30).
Oyster Creek, as the sole source of cooling water for the refinery, was still a shallow,
meandering, swampy stream, even after it was supplemented by pumping. It was an
unreliable source at times and needed to be supplemented by lakes, which could hold
sufficient water in storage. In 1917, a dredge was brought in to experiment in what is now
Cleveland Lake. It was practical to increase the maximum depth of the lake to 5 meters (17
feet), and to enlarge Cleveland Lake to cover forty acres, providing a large reservoir for the
Imperial Refinery and for the irrigation program on the farms. Another, even larger lake,
known then for its animal population as Alligator Lake, was dredged to 5 meters (17 feet)
and the name changed to Alkire Lake. Brooks Lake was also dredged. These lakes,
connected to Oyster Creek, acted like reservoirs and provided some 40 hectares (100 acres)
of water storage with an average depth of 3 meters (10 feet) (Armstrong 2000:86).
12

By means of the Brazos River pumping station and the dams built and renovated
during this improvement program, it was now possible to maintain the water in Oyster Creek
and its tributary lakes at a reasonably constant level throughout the year, despite dry spells
and heavy rains. This system, virtually unchanged since the 1920s, is still in use today
(Armstrong 2000:86).
In 1896, Cunningham constructed a 45,359 kilograms/day (100,000 pound /day) mill
next to his mill. This mill, which provided white refined sugar, became later known as the
Imperial Sugar Company. The mill cost Cunningham 1.5 million dollars, and this investment
led to his financial ruin as much of the mill was financed through credit. Cunningham was
plagued by bad luck – the 1899 flood and the 1900 hurricane that destroyed Galveston
destroyed much of his sugar crops during those years, and in 1899 part of his new mill
burned. Cunningham’s company went into receivership in 1903, and eventually his
creditor’s intervened in 1907 (Armstrong 2000:30-38).
Cunningham and Ellis’ industries and lands were purchased by William Thomas
Eldridge and Isaac Herbert Kempner in 1905 (Armstrong 2000:71). In 1908, the partnership
acquired 5059 hectares (12,500 acres) adjoining the Cunningham Plantation. The KempnerEldridge partnership changed its name to the Imperial Sugar Company. The two men used
the name the Imperial Sugar Company after Cunningham’s mill and Kempner’s fondness for
the Imperial Hotel in New York City (Armstrong 2000:71). As part of the agreement,
Eldridge became its general manager and began building the company-owned town of Sugar
Land. In return, Eldridge was given the Sugar Land Railway (Wallingford 1996:77-79).
The land and its business were all owned by the Kempner-Eldridge partnership, and
the town attracted a stable population largely made up of Germans and Czechs from central
Texas. The company provided homes, schools, and medical care to its employees. In 1907
the company opened Imperial State Bank and added a paper mill, feed mill, various retail
stores and a cotton gin (Wallingford 1996: 77-79). The new owners also made
improvements to the mill and extended the Sugar Land Railroad to Rotchford in 1912
(Wallingford 1996:126-127).
One of the priorities of the new owners was to make additional improvements to
Oyster Creek. While the creek provided water to the mills and industry it also threatened the
surrounding farms after heavy rains. In 1913, water from the Brazos River and the rains had
flooded over the entire southern and western portion of the 11-kilometer (7-mile) long
plantation, and up to the very door of the refinery in Sugar Land. Losses in crops and
animals were serious. Kempner and Eldridge set about a long-range program to build levees
and drainage ditches, and to level the land along Oyster Creek for irrigation. This work was
started in 1913 and was completed in 1929 (Armstrong 2000:84).
In 1916, Eldridge wrote a letter to Kempner in Galveston describing what
improvements he was planning to make to Oyster Creek and to Sugar Land. He envisioned
the creek being not only recharged by water from the Brazos, but also from 10 artesian wells.
He also described the improvements he would like to make to the creek as follows:

13

“Following up the natural contour of the lands, a water course system
is contemplated, using dirt taken out to fill up other low places and leveling
them off, -the dredging, widening and deepening of Cleveland Lake, with a
connecting canal to Oyster Creek, deepening Oyster Creek to the line of
Adama Place to the South, dredging a canal from Oyster Creek to Half Moon
Lake near the Brooks place, deepening Half Moon Lake, dredging a canal
from Oyster Creek to Bill Moore Lake, deepening and shaping up the banks
of this lake to the railroad, dreading a canal from Oyster Creek to Horseshoe
Lake; thus producing a system of connected lakes….This water system will at
the same time furnish an ample supply for all manufacturing plants, providing
sufficient water for irrigating the Sugar Land Gardens” (Eldridge 1916:2-3).

While the entirety of Eldridge’s plans did not come to fruition, 13.7 kilometers (8.5
miles) of levees, from 0.6 to 4.3 meters (2 to 14 feet) high, depending on the elevation of the
land, and 12.2 meters (40 feet) wide at the bottom were to be laboriously constructed along
the southern, eastern and western sides of the old Cunningham property. At first, mules, and
wagons moved the earth from the farms to the levees, but earth-moving machines were also
used when they became available to level the farmlands and to drain ponds and swamps.
When the levees were completed in 1922, the farmlands were leveled to fill in the ponds and
swamps; 32 kilometers (20 miles) of ditches drained the newly leveled lands. Irrigation of
farm crops on company lands along the banks of Oyster Creek became a reality,
accomplished by constructing electric power lines along the banks of the creek, then
mounting electric motors on barges for pumping irrigation water onto the fields. Engineers
estimated that the construction of the levee, the drainage ditches, and the leveling of the lands
required the moving of 3,822,774 cubic meters (5,000,000 cubic yards) of dirt at a cost of
over $700,000 (Armstrong 2000:84).
By 1928, the levees were preventing the frequent floods of the Brazos from reaching
the farmlands. The deepening of Oyster Creek and the adjoining lakes, supplemented by the
pumping station on the Brazos, insured an adequate supply of fresh water for the refinery and
the farms even during the worst drought. The banks of the creek and the lakes had been
cleared and shaped, and in some places near the town, landscaped.
After representatives of the American Society of Chemical Engineers visited Sugar
Land on May 1, 1921, several reports were written about the drainage and irrigation
programs there. Some excerpts provide an outsider’s view of the progress being made:
“Levees now protect against the menace of overflow from the Brazos
River. Dams conserve the waters of Oyster Creek. Drainage and irrigation,
both vital to the operations here, have been provided. Unrelated waterways
have been coordinated. …Irregularities in contour have been leveled into
harmony, and unsightly shorelines are being converted into parks and
driveways, to be shaded in the years to come by thousands of Royal Walnut
trees, imported from California. …It has taken 3 years of constant pumping
and digging by hydraulic and dipper dredges to achieve these results. The
program is not nearly complete but has progressed sufficiently to completely
14

change the topographical appearance of the Sugar Land section. …The
engineer and his allies, the dredge, the steam shovel and the pile driver, and
his auxiliary aids, the electric light and the gasoline and electric driven motor
have worked a transformation that is already exciting the wonder and
admiration of those who knew the landscape under former conditions. The
mosquito has been driven from his happy hunting grounds” (Armstrong 2000:
86).
Oyster shells, which give Oyster Creek its name, are common along its banks.
During the 1950s mining these shells became a local industry. Tons of shells were shipped
annually for use in road and driveway construction and for making such products as buttons
(Handbook of Texas Online 2007). In the 1990s, the Imperial Holly Corporation (the name
for Imperial Sugar after the merger with Holly Sugar) began construction of an artificial
wetland along Oyster Creek. The project was led by Mr. Harry Chen, Environmental
Manager for Imperial Holly Corporation at that time, and was completed in 1997. Imperial
continued to circulate a very small portion of Oyster Creek flow through the project until
2001, as area schools made field trips to the site during this time. The project was
discontinued in 2002, and the land was left to return to its natural state (Martha H. Martin,
PE, personal communication 2008).
From 1924 to 1927 the partners embarked on a massive improvement program of the
sugar mill and surrounding property. The most noticeable additions were the eight-story
Char House (completed in 1926), and the five-story Pan House (completed in 1927). The
Char House could be seen from miles away and became a Sugar Land landmark. The
structure was still in use in 1990 (Armstrong 2000:117-121).
By 1932, Imperial was the only remaining sugar manufacturer in Texas. The
company survived only with the help of a loan from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation
during the Great Depression and by 1940 the company expanded again. World War II
brought the suspension of quotas under the Sugar Act and allowed unlimited imports. Under
sugar rationing and other government wartime restrictions, Imperial provided all the sugar
for Texas and Oklahoma, an arrangement that resulted in the company's postwar dominance
of the market in those states. In 1946 the Kempner family bought out the Eldridge interest in
the firm and became sole owners of the town of Sugar Land.
The Imperial Sugar Company operated twenty-four hours a day, 7 days a week for up
to 6 weeks during World War II. The increase in the demands for processed sugar during the
war took its toll on the mill, evidenced by the considerable maintenance the plant needed
after the war ended. These projected costs provided part of the reason for the sale of the
Eldridge interest (Armstrong 2000: 139). The Kempners increased the output of the sugar
refinery to 1,113,980 kilograms/day (2,500,000 pounds/day) and spent close to five million
dollars for maintenance in 1948 (Armstrong 2000:145).
By the 1950s the company’s output exceeded two million pounds of sugar daily.
Bulk raw sugar supplies increased when the company sold a significant portion of its stock to
the C and H Sugar Refining Company of California and Hawaii in 1956; Imperial bought the
stock back in 1967. Other sugar supplies arrived through the port of Galveston from farms in
15

the Dominican Republic, Brazil, Australia, Africa, and elsewhere and were shipped by rail to
the refinery. Though candy companies and bottlers who used large supplies of sugar
followed the influx of population that moved to the Sunbelt states in the 1950s and 1960s,
competition from corn sweeteners and other sugar substitutes drove many refineries out of
business. Imperial began to operate its plants on 3 shifts, but growth was limited by shipping
costs, which became prohibitive beyond Kansas. Facing the encroachment of Houston, the
town of Sugar Land incorporated in 1959, and by 1973 the company had sold or liquidated
Sugarland Industries and most of its local holdings. The Kempner family retained only its
ownership of the Imperial Sugar Company and the Sugar Land Telephone Company, and a
partial interest in the Sugar Land State Bank (Kleiner 2007).
As Houston expanded, the company formed the Belknap Corporation and developed
area subdivisions, but later sold all but a few acres of its real estate. This area was developed
into Sugar Creek, Sweetwater, First Colony, and several other planned communities on what
had been fields of sugarcane, cotton, grains, and vegetables. In 1989, Imperial merged with
the Holly Sugar Corporation, and in 1990 Imperial Holly was listed among the Fortune 500
list of the largest companies in the country. Despite this success, the company filed for
bankruptcy protection on January 17, 2001, attributing its problems to lower sales for refined
sugar as well as higher energy costs. Then on August 29, 2001, the company emerged from
Chapter 11 and has since turned its focus inward as it downsizes its operations. The
company no longer refines sugar at its original plant in Sugar Land (the facility was closed in
2003) but their corporate headquarters are still located in its founding city.

IMPERIAL (CENTRAL) STATE PRISON FARM
The abolition of slavery after the Civil War resulted in a labor shortage in much of the
South, and in an effort to solve this problem the state adopted the practice of leasing convict
labor in 1867. This practice began in Huntsville, Texas, as the prison there used convicts to
manufacture items for the Confederate Army during the war, but the postwar practice saw
convicts used in a variety of other capacities including chopping down trees, mining coal,
quarrying stone and farming various crops. The state awarded contracts to the highest bidder
or group of bidders and granted them the right to not only use the convicts as cheap laborers,
but also granted them access to prison facilities and machinery. The winning bidder or
bidders was required to provide shelter, food, clothing and medical care to the prisoners,
which, in sum, privatized the prison system (Dase 2004:7). Abuses of these responsibilities
resulted in public outcry, and eventually led to the abolishment of the system in 1912
(Hudson 2002:4).
Beginning in 1878, Cunningham and Ellis used leased convict labor to harvest sugar
cane on their lands in Fort Bend County. The two sugar magnates had up to 500 prisoners
working their land, which was roughly equal to one-fifth of the state’s convict population.
The convicts were housed in 3 camps on the Ellis plantation, and the partners rapidly became
the state’s largest lessee of convict labor (Hudson 2002:2). Conditions for the prisoners were
harsh. The annual mortality rate of prisoners working in the sugar cane fields was three %
(Dase 2004:9). Guards were not answerable to any one outside the camps, and investigating

16

officials documented many instances of abuse, neglect and brutality. The sugar cane fields of
Fort Bend County were described as a:
“…low, mosquito infested swamp and the sluggish bayous were
habitats for alligators and noisome creepers. Convicts labored barelegged in
wet sugar cane fields, dying like flies in the periodic epidemics of fevers.
Civilian labor could not be kept on the place. In those days, a free man who
stayed more than two weeks was suspected of hiding out from the sin of
omission or mission” (Dase 2004:8).
The housing provided by Cunningham and Ellis could best be described as minimal.
Some stayed in wooded barracks, but many resided in shacks or simply out in the fields.
Because of the brutality of the guards, the absence of medical care, and the harsh
environmental conditions, working conditions were dubbed by one observer as the “HellHole on the Brazos” (Dase 2004:9). The convict lease system effectively relieved the State
of Texas of the costs of running its penitentiary system, but reports of terrible abuses of the
prisoners led to the systems abolishment in 1912. However, the practice of using prisoners
as cheap labor coupled with the desire to make the prison system self-sustaining led to the
creation of the state’s prison farm system. This system grew to encompass as many as 14
prison farms encompassing more than 32,800 hectares (81,000 acres) that grew and
processed food products for their own populations, as well as that of other state institutions,
along with cash crops like sugar cane and cotton (Dase 2004:1). The state purchased a
portion of Ellis’s holdings when the partnership began experiencing financial difficulties in
1907, and would eventually carve out 2 prison farms on the partnerships old holdings, the
Harlem State Prison Farm and the Imperial State Prison Farm. While the state recognized
that it could no longer relieve itself of the responsibility of running its own prison system, it
maintained that it could strive to make the system as self-sufficient as possible. To this end,
it sought to ensure that every able-bodied prisoner worked as hard labor was seen as a key
element of a prisoner’s rehabilitation (Hudson 2002:5).
Despite the change in management, the abuse of the prisoners remained a problem on
the Imperial State Prison Farm. One observer of conditions at Imperial State Prison Farm
noted that “the convicts’ quarters were in the worst condition imaginable; the bunks swarmed
with vermin, and the use of disinfectants and antiseptics was unknown” (Hudson 2002:4-5).
Furthermore he found another building to be “in such deplorable shape that it was hardly fit
for the stabling of hogs, much less men [and in] rainy weather the floor flood with water,
which leaked from hundreds of places in the roof” (Hudson 2002:4-5). Guard housing was
found to be only slightly less deplorable than that of the convicts. Within a few years the
same observer returned to the farm and saw that improvements ranked the unit as among “the
best equipped and most sanitary camps in the system” (Hudson 2002: 4-5). Imperial Prison
Farm was divided into 3 camps, and only one is located on the project area. The main camp,
or “One Camp” as it was commonly referred to, and “Two Camp,” are both located to the
south (Konicki 2004). “Three Camp”, recorded as archaeological Site 41FB284, is located in
Section A of the project area and has been previously investigated via archeological
reconnaissance (Carpenter 2001).

CHAPTER IV. PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

Background research indicates that a total of 15 previous archaeological
investigations have been conducted within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) radius of the project area
(see Figure 1). One cultural resources survey has been conducted within a large portion of
the current project area (Carpenter 2001; see Figure 1). In 2001, a 240-hectare (594 acre)
reconnaissance-level survey was performed for the Texas GLO within the current project
area, north of Oyster Creek. Shovel testing and mechanical deep testing was conducted
during the reconnaissance-level survey. The survey resulted in the identification of Site
41FB284, located within the northern section of the proposed project at the corner of
Highway 6 and Voss Road (Carpenter 2001).
Site 41FB284 was identified as the remaining features of Three Camp of the Imperial
(Central) Prison Farm dating between 1910 and the 1960s. Numerous structural features
were recorded including storage sheds, feed barns, livestock pens, cattle chutes, fences, and
concrete/brick foundations. In addition, buried historic artifacts including brick, metal
staples, porcelain plate fragments, barbed wire, metal pipes, window glass, and faunal bone
fragments were recorded just below the ground surface. The site was not recommended
eligible for the National Register based on the lack of integrity, below-ground disturbances,
extensive landscape modification, and lack of historical significance due to the
undistinguishable design of the buildings and stock building materials used to build the
associated farm structures (Carpenter 2001).

CHAPTER V. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Background and site file research was initiated prior to fieldwork mobilization.
Background literature search included a review of both archaeological site files and
architectural resource files and a review of previously conducted cultural resource surveys in
the vicinity. This information was obtained by reviewing records through the Texas Sites
Atlas (maintained by the THC).
As part of the literature search, HRA Gray & Pape created a table to document
previously identified resources located within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) radius of the project area.
Cultural resources identified during this literature search included previously recorded
archaeological sites and previously conducted cultural resources surveys.
The historical research methods employed in the investigation of the site not only
included the use of primary documents, but also secondary source materials as well. Primary
source materials from the Texas Prison Museum, the archival holdings of the Fort Bend
County Museum at the George Ranch, and the holdings of the Texas State Library were
integral to the historical investigation. Secondary source materials that were consulted
included several historical and archeological studies of the area, as well as several that
pertained specifically to the Prison Farm and Imperial Sugar eras. Interviews with relevant
prison system officials, including Mr. Don Hudson, were also conducted.

INTENSIVE PEDESTRIAN SURVEY
The project area was divided into 5 sections (A, B, C, D, and E). Section A is
composed of the northernmost 10 hectares (25 acres), at the corner of Voss Road and
Highway 6, where previously recorded Site 41FB284 is located. Section B makes up the
largest area, covering the majority of Oyster Creek within the project area. Section C is
composed of the southernmost section of property on the north side of Oyster Creek,
distinguished by a change in vegetation marked by the presence of a fence line. Section D
makes the southwestern corner of the project at the junction of Highway 6 and ALT 90. The
Imperial Sugar factory makes up Section E of the project area.

SECTION A
Section A is considered to have a low probability for containing intact buried
prehistoric cultural resources due to the presence of soils of the Bernard-Edna complex.
Section A was surveyed along 10 parallel transects spaced 30 meters (100 feet) apart. The
transects are oriented north to south. Based on the known disturbances to the area including
farming and plowing and the presence of low-probability soil, shovel tests were placed along
every fourth transect with all other transects subjected to pedestrian survey only. A total of
19

12 shovel tests were planned for excavation within Section A outside of the boundary of Site
41FB284. In addition, a series of 8 judgmentally placed shovel tests were placed within the
boundaries of the northern half of previously recorded Site 41FB284 within Section A.

SECTION B
Section B was surveyed along 64 parallel transects spaced 30 meters (100 feet) apart.
Transects were oriented west to east. Based on the large size of the project area and known
near-surface disturbances including farming, plowing, and creek channalization, shovel tests
were placed along every fourth transect with all other transects subjected to visual inspection
of the ground surface. Survey within Section B was concentrated within a 120-meter (400­
foot) wide zone along the banks of Oyster Creek. These areas within Section B are
considered to have the highest probability for the discovery of buried prehistoric resources.
These areas were planned for shovel testing and surface inspection at 30 to 60-meter (100 to
200-foot) intervals. The remainder of Section B was subjected to systematic surface and
near-surface survey along transects, but at a less intensive interval with increasing distance
from the creek banks, ranging between 100 to 200-meter (300 to 600-foot) interval. A total
of 280 shovel tests were planned for excavation in Section B.
In addition to near-surface sampling via shovel testing, Section B was surveyed via
mechanical deep testing in an effort to determine whether deeply buried deposits may be
located below layers of thick alluvium in the Oyster Creek floodplain. A series of 25
trenches were planned for excavation primarily within the riparian growth along the creek
banks in Section B.

SECTION C
Section C, also considered to have high probability for containing archaeological
sites, is located adjacent to Section B on the south. This area was surveyed along 15
transects oriented northeast to southwest. Of these, shovel tests were placed along every
fourth transect with all other transects subjected to visual inspection of the ground surface. A
total of 52 shovel tests were originally planned for excavation in Section C. At the time of
survey, it was not possible to obtain access for a backhoe to the area immediately north of
Oyster Creek. Therefore, shovel testing in this area was supplemented with a manually
operated bucket-auger, capable of obtaining soil samples from depths of up to 2.4 meters (8
feet). A total of 10 shovel tests in Section C were selected for deep testing via the use of the
bucket-auger.

SECTION D
A series of 12 backhoe excavated trenches were planned within Section D due to the
presence of up to 2 meters (7 feet) of lime and sugar extract overlying the natural ground
surface and deep underlying alluvium. The lime, used as a precipitant during the sugar
refining process, and the sugar extract, a by-product of the sugar refining process, were
20

overlain as refuse across the surface of southwestern most portion of Section D over the last
fifty years of sugar production at the Imperial Sugar factory (Martha H. Martin, PE, personal
communication). A total of 7 shovel tests were planned eastern portion of Section D located
south of the railroad tracks in Section D.

SECTION E
Section E of the property is composed of the Imperial Sugar factory complex. This
section of the project area was not subjected to an archaeological survey. Rather, the entire
plant was subjected to an architectural survey at the request of the THC. The results of the
architectural survey are reported in Sweeten et al. 2008.

GENERAL SURVEY METHODS
All of the shovel tests were excavated in arbitrary 10-centimeter (4-inch) levels. All
soil strata were recorded and soil colors were described using the Munsell color chart (2000).
Where possible, soils were screened through 0.64-centimeter (0.25-inch) hardware mesh.
Clayey soils were divided using hand tools and visually inspected for artifacts. One wall of
each shovel test was profiled and the walls and floor of each test were inspected for color or
texture change potentially associated with the presence of cultural features. Where possible,
shovel tests were excavated into culturally sterile soil or just beyond Holocene deposits. Soil
profiles were described using tested approaches for describing basic soil properties (see
Munsell 2000; Schoenberger et al. 2002; Vogel 2002). Comparisons of soil profiles
observed in the field to the soil series type described by Mowery et al. (1960) were also
conducted.
All mechanically excavated trenches measured a minimum of 10 meters (30 feet) in
length and approximately 1 meter (3 feet) wide. Samples of trench backfill were hand sifted
and samples of alluvial deposits were screened using 0.64-centimeter (0.25-inch) hardware
cloth. After each 20-centimeter (8-inch) bucket-full of soil was removed, the walls and
floors of the trenches were monitored for changes in soil color or texture potentially related
to the presence of cultural features. At least 1 wall of each trench was profiled and
photographed. Soil profiles observed in all trenches were described using tested approaches
for describing basic soil properties (see Munsell 2000; Schoenberger et al. 2002; Vogel
2002). Comparisons of soil profiles observed in the field to the soil series type described by
Mowery et al. (1960) were also conducted.
All historic-age standing structures located outside of Section E (the Imperial Sugar
Factory boundary) observed during the archaeological survey within or immediately adjacent
to the project were photographed, and their locations were plotted on field maps. These
structures are all described by Sweeten et al. 2008. All identified sites were delineated
within the project area. All sites were photographed and mapped. HRA Gray & Pape
generally relied on the excavation of 2 consecutive negative shovel tests in each cardinal
direction from positive tests to delineate site boundaries, ensuring a clear definition of site

21

boundaries. Sites were only delineated within the project area. For each newly recorded site,
Texas site forms were completed and trinomials were obtained.

CHAPTER VI. RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

RESULTS OF BACKGROUND RESEARCH
Site file research was conducted by consulting the on-line Texas Archaeological Sites
Atlas maintained by the THC. The goal of the research efforts was to produce a listing of all
archaeological sites within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the project area and all historic
structures eligible for NRHP listing located immediately adjacent to the permit area.
Cultural resources identified during the literature search included previously recorded
archaeological sites and previously conducted cultural resources surveys. No previously
recorded architectural resources or properties listed on the NRHP were located within the
boundaries of the current project area. Background research indicates that 22 previously
identified archaeological sites and 4 historical markers are located within 1.6 kilometers (1
mile) of the project area. One archaeological site (41FB284) and 2 of the 4 historical
markers are located within the project area (Table 1; see Figure 1).
Sites located outside of the project area include numerous prehistoric campsites,
historic house sites, historic sites of an unknown type, a cemetery, and a few sites consisting
of both a prehistoric campsite and a historic house. All but one of these sites are located west
of the project area. One of these sites is located south of the parcel. Three of these sites were
recommended for further work. The eligibility of most of these sites for the NRHP and as a
State Archaeological Landmark (SAL) is unknown. Two of these sites were recommended
as having NRHP and SAL potential.
Two historic markers are located within the southeastern portion of the project area
(Table 1; see Figure 1). These mark the founding of Sugar Land (named by B.F. Terry and
W.J. Kyle in 1853) and the Sugar Land Refinery. Two additional markers are located east of
the project area across from the Imperial Sugar Company (Table 1; see Figure 1). These are
the Sugar Land Auditorium and the Sugar Land Independent School District No. 17.

RESULTS OF INTENSIVE PEDESTRIAN SURVEY
The intensive pedestrian survey included visual inspection of the ground surface,
shovel testing, deep testing using a rubber-tired backhoe and a manually operated backhoe.
The survey was designed to assess any potential impacts that construction activities might
have on archaeological sites located within the previously unsurveyed southern portion of the
project area. Detailed descriptions of each shovel test and each backhoe trench are provided
in Appendices A and B.

SECTION A
Section A makes up approximately 10 hectares (25 acres) of the project.
Disturbances to Section A include an existing north-south oriented pipeline right-of-way on
the west side, and previous plowing and landscape modification. A total of 12 shovel tests
were planned for excavation outside of the boundary of known site 41FB284. However,
inundation precluded the excavation of 4 shovel tests. Therefore, only 8 were excavated
within this portion of Section A. These 8 shovel tests were negative for cultural resources.

Site 41FB284 Revisit
Eight shovel tests were excavated within the boundaries of previously recorded Site
41FB284 within Section A (Figure 2). Two of these were positive for historic artifacts and
contained very few items including 2 iron staples and several unidentifiable fragments of
iron. Other material observed included rounded pebbles and crushed shell fragments,
indicating that the ground surface and below were disturbed by previous landscape
modification. Of the portions of the site that are located within the project boundaries, 5
farm structures were observed (Figure 2). The Sweeten et al. 2008 architecture report
discusses these structures in detail.
These included 3 feed barns made from wood and corrugated metal, one of which
was over 35 meters (115 feet) long with 5 compartments for livestock. Other structures
included iron fence posts with dense rope fencing and a long livestock chute leading to a
livestock pen or corral with various compartments. All of the structures appear to coincide in
age with Carpenter’s early to mid-twentieth century estimate. All structures were
photographed and mapped. The Sweeten et al. 2008 architecture report provides descriptions
and National Register eligibility recommendations for these structures.
Shovel test depths ranged from 20 to 50 centimeters (8 to 20 inches) below the
surface, where they were terminated upon reaching pre-Holocene clays. Soil profiles
conformed to the Bernard-Edna Complex described by Mowery et al. (1960). All soil
matrices within Section A were typically composed of dense and disturbed mottled clay and
clay loam. Munsell (2000) colors ranged from black (10YR2/1) to yellowish brown
(10YR5/8). These soils did not facilitate screening; therefore, the removed soils were hand
sorted in an effort to locate artifacts.

SECTION B
Section B makes up approximately 205 hectares (507 acres) of the 301-hectare (743­
acre) project area. Disturbances to Section B include an existing north-south oriented
pipeline right-of-way on the west side, previous creek channalization, levee construction,
stock pond excavation, plowing and agricultural activities, and several 2-track paths. A total
of 280 shovel tests were planned for excavation along within Section B, although due
primarily to inundation and the presence of the creek bank, only 231 shovel tests were
excavated. The excavation of the remaining 49 shovel tests was precluded primarily by
inundation and the presence of the highly channelized creek bank although the Highway 6
right-of-way and an existing pipeline also added to the non-excavation of several planned
shovel tests. An average of 1 shovel test was excavated per every 2 acres in Section B. Refer
to Appendix A for a complete list of all planned shovel tests and delineation/radial shovel
tests within Section B.
In addition to the shovel testing, a series of 25 trenches were planned across the
project area to test for deeply buried prehistoric resources. The trenches were primarily
placed in close proximity to the creek banks, although a few were placed within the open
pastures in Section B (Figure 3). Refer to Appendix A for a complete list of all trench
profiles within Section B.
Shovel test depth ranged from 15 to 100 centimeters (6 to 40 inches) below the
surface and were most often terminated upon reaching wet to saturated clays. Most
commonly, soil profiles conformed to Norwood silt loam, Norwood silty clay and Miller silty
clay loam described by Mowery et al. (1960). All soil matrices within Section B were
typically composed of moist to saturated plowed alluvium made up of silty clay loam, silty
clay, or clay loam. Munsell (2000) colors ranged from reddish brown (5YR4/4) to brown
(7.5YR4/4) with a humus surface layer composed of very dark brown (10YR2/2). Highly
disturbed areas most commonly observed were along the immediate creek banks where soils
were composed of darker colored wet clays with noticeably uneven ground surfaces.
As a result of the investigations conducted within Section B of the project area, a total
6 historic-age structures, 2 historic features, and 3 archaeological loci were recorded. Each of
these findings is discussed below.

Historic-Age Structures A Through F
Structures A though F appear to have been associated with abandoned farm and
agriculture-related activities based on their general appearance and likely functions. It is
likely that these structures are associated with known Site 41FB284. The locations of all of
these structures are depicted on Figure 3. All structures were photographed and mapped.
Refer to the Sweeten et al. 2008 architecture report for descriptions and National Register
eligibility recommendations for these structures.

Historic-Age Landscape Features 1 And 2
Two east-west oriented irrigation ditches (Landscape Features 1 and 2), are located
within the central portion of Section B. These features appear to represent the remains of
historic irrigation ditches. It is likely that these features are associated with known Site
41FB284. These ditches were photographed and GPS coordinates were collected along their
lengths. The locations of Features 1 and 2 are depicted on Figure 3. Refer to the Sweeten et
al. 2008 architecture report for descriptions and National Register eligibility
recommendations of these features.

Archaeological Locus 1
This isolated historic ceramic whiteware fragment was recovered at 5 centimeters (2
inches) below the ground surface from a shovel test excavated in the northern portion of
Section B approximately 100 meters (300 feet) north of Oyster Creek (see Figure 3). The
whiteware fragment was identified as an undecorated rim fragment from a saucer or plate rim
fragment, recorded in plowed alluvium at the edge of a section of open pasture and riparian
growth near the creek. Eight radial shovel tests were excavated in the cardinal directions at a
10-meter (30-foot) interval. All of the radial shovel tests were negative for cultural resources
(see Figure 3). A site trinomial is not being sought for the isolated find. The disturbed
location and lack of additional materials associated with the single whiteware fragment
indicate that this isolated find has no cultural significance that would contribute to the
historic body of knowledge in the region.

Archaeological Locus 2
This isolated prehistoric possible stone tool fragment, made of chert, was recovered
from the ground surface in the central portion of Section B approximately 100 meters (300
feet) east of Oyster Creek (see Figure 3). The fragment was identified immediately east of a
trench at the edge of a section of open pasture and riparian growth. Due to its proximity to a
trench, only 4 radial shovel tests were excavated from the location of the Locus 2 at a 10­
meter (30-foot) interval. The ground surface was also examined for any additional exposed
material on the ground surface within a 30-meter (100-foot) radius. All of the radial shovel
tests were negative for cultural resources (see Figure 3). A site trinomial is not being sought
for the isolated find. The disturbed location and lack of additional materials associated with
the single fragment indicate that this isolated find has no cultural significance that would
contribute to the historic body of knowledge in the region.

Archaeological Locus 3
This isolated historic ceramic whiteware fragment was recovered at 10 to 20
centimeters (4 to 8 inches) below the ground surface from a shovel test excavated in the
southern portion of Section B approximately 75 meters (246 feet) east of Oyster Creek (see
29

Figure 3). The whiteware fragment was identified as an undecorated rim fragment from a
saucer or plate rim fragment, recorded in plowed alluvium at the edge of a section of open
pasture and riparian growth near the creek. Eight radial shovel tests were excavated in the
cardinal directions at a 10-meter (30-foot) interval. All of the radial shovel tests were
negative for cultural resources (see Figure 3). A site trinomial is not being sought for the
isolated find. The disturbed location and lack of additional materials associated with the
single whiteware fragment indicate that this isolated find has no cultural significance that
would contribute to the historic body of knowledge in the region.

SECTION C
Section C makes up approximately 36 hectares (88 acres) of the 301-hectare (743­
acre) project area. Disturbances to Section C include previous creek channalization, levee
construction, plowing and agricultural activities, dredge dumping and removal, the remains
of the Oyster Creek Wetlands Project and a 2-track path. A total of 52 shovel tests were
planned for excavation along within Section C. All planned shovel tests were successfully
excavated. An average of 1 shovel test was excavated per 1.7 acres in Section C. At the time
of survey, heavy machinery could not be maneuvered into Section C. Of the 52 shovel tests,
a total of 10 were selected for deep testing using a manually-operated bucket-auger.
Appendix A contains a complete list of all shovel tests, bucket-augered tests and
delineation/radial shovel tests within Section C.
Shovel test depth ranged from 20 to 80 centimeters (8 to 31 inches) below the surface
and were most often terminated upon reaching wet clays and dense clays that are
impenetrable with a shovel. The augered tests ranged in depth from 110 to 250 centimeters
(44 inches to 8.2 feet). Most commonly, soil profiles conformed to Norwood clay, Miller
clay described by Mowery et al. (1960). All soil matrices within Section C were typically
composed of alluvium made up of clay, clay loam and silt loam. Munsell (2000) colors
ranged dark brown (7.5YR3/3) to reddish brown (5YR4/4) with a humus surface layer
composed of very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2). These soils were compact and mostly
clayey, and did not facilitate screening; therefore, the removed soils were hand sorted in an
effort to locate artifacts.
As a result of the investigations conducted within Section C of the project area, a total
1 historic archaeological site and associated structure, 4 historic-age structures, and 3
archaeological loci were recorded. Each of these findings is discussed below.

Site 41FB316
Site 41FB316 is a circa 1940 storage shed and associated buried scatter of historic
artifacts. The site is located in an open pasture north of Oyster Creek (Figures 4 and 5).
According to Sweeten et al. 2008, the storage shed is of balloon frame construction, and it
rises from wood sill plates. On the exterior, corrugated metal sheathes the walls and the flat
roof. A single entry is centered on the primary facade. The entry has a door made of
plywood with 5x10-centimeter (2x4-inch) rails. No windows are present. On

the interior, there is a wood floor consisting of 5x10-centimeter (2x4-inch) joists and beams.
Plywood sheets cover the floor. The interior walls and ceiling are unfinished (from Sweeten
et al. 2008).
In an effort to determine whether a subsurface component existed around the shed, a
total of 29 radial delineation shovel tests were excavated in the vicinity of the structure. Of
these, 12 were positive for historic artifacts (see Figure 5). Artifact deposition ranged from a
depth of 10 centimeters (4 inches) to 30 centimeters (12 inches) below the ground surface.
Artifacts recorded in positive shovel tests included 3 clear flat glass shards, 11 brick
fragments, 4 pieces of concrete, 4 indeterminate metal fragments, 1 piece of fence wire, 1
milk glass shard, 1 metal door lock, 1 railroad spike, 3 pieces of cement, 1 nail, 1
unidentified faunal bone fragment, 1 fragment of floor tile, and 1 decorated whiteware
ceramic sherd. Additional radial tests were attempted but not excavated due to inundation.
The site is bound to the north, east, and west by 2 consecutive negative radial shovel tests in
each direction, and to the south by Oyster Creek. The site measures about 60 meters (200
feet) north to south and about 30 meters (100 feet) east to west.
Also observed during site recordation were numerous pebbles and crushed shell
mixed with the historic artifacts. One shovel test produced a modern nail and another shovel
test produced a piece of hard modern plastic. The presence of these pebbles and modern
refuse indicate some level of previous disturbance to the site.
Records collected include a Texas archaeological site form, a hand-drawn sketch
map, shovel test forms, and photographs. Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates were
taken for the structure and positive shovel tests.
Historic-Age Structures G Through J
Structures G though J appear to have been associated with farm and agriculture–
related activities based on their general appearance and likely functions. The locations of all
of these structures are depicted on Figure 4. Each structure was photographed and mapped.
Refer to the Sweeten et al. 2008 architecture report for descriptions and National Register
eligibility recommendations for these structures.

Archaeological Locus 4
This locus consisted of 6 small red brick fragments recovered at 10 to 20 centimeters
(4 to 8 inches) below the ground surface from a shovel test excavated on the western bank of
Oyster Creek (see Figure 4). The brick fragments were recorded in a layer of alluvium below
a stratum of organic-rich sandy loam. Seven radial shovel tests were excavated in the
cardinal directions at a 10-meter (30-foot) interval. All of the radial shovel tests were
negative for cultural resources (see Figure 4). A site trinomial is not being sought for this
locus. The lack of additional materials associated with the brick fragments indicate that
Locus 4 has no cultural significance that would contribute to the historic body of knowledge
in the region.
33

Archaeological Locus 5
This isolated historic buried ceramic whiteware fragment was recovered at 10 to 20
centimeters (4 to 8 inches) below the ground surface from a shovel test excavated in the
eastern portion of Section C approximately 130 meters (427 feet) west of Oyster Creek (see
Figure 4). The whiteware fragment was recorded in alluvium mixed with disturbed soil that
appears to have been part of dredge sediment removed from Oyster Creek in the 1970s and
spread across the ground surface north of the channelized creek. Eight radial shovel tests
were excavated in the cardinal directions at a 10-meter (30-foot) interval. All of the radial
shovel tests were negative for cultural resources (see Figure 4). A site trinomial is not being
sought for the isolated find. The disturbed location and lack of additional materials
associated with the single whiteware fragment indicate that this isolated find has no cultural
significance that would contribute to the historic body of knowledge in the region.

Archaeological Locus 6
This locus is comprised of an isolated prehistoric buried chert flake that was recorded
in the upper 15 centimeters (6 inches) of a shovel test excavated on the northern bank of
Oyster Creek (see Figure 4). The flake was recorded in disturbed soil that appears to have
been part of dredge sediment removed from Oyster Creek in the 1970s and spread across the
ground surface north of the creek. Seven radial shovel tests were excavated in the cardinal
directions at a 10-meter (30-foot) interval. One radial shovel test was not excavated because
of a surrounding 90% surface visibility. All of the radial shovel tests were negative for
cultural resources (see Figure 4). A site trinomial is not being sought for Locus 3. The
disturbed location and lack of additional materials associated with the single chert flake
indicate that this isolated find has no cultural significance that would contribute to the
prehistoric body of knowledge in the region.

SECTION D
Section D makes up approximately 28 hectares (68 acres) of the 301-hectare (743­
acre) project area. Disturbances to Section D are primarily limited to the presence of 2-track
paths. A total of 7 shovel tests were planned for excavation within the eastern portion of
Section D south of the existing railroad tracks. All planned shovel tests were successfully
excavated. Refer to Appendix A for a complete list of all shovel tests within Section D.
In addition to the shovel testing, a series of 12 trenches were planned for excavation
due to the presence of fill composed of sugar extract and lime deposited up to 2 meters (7
feet) over the natural ground surface. Trenches in Section D were all oriented north to south.
Each trench measured approximately 8 meters (26 feet) long and 1 meter (3 feet) wide.
Trench excavation ranged between a minimum depth of 200 centimeters (6.6 feet) and a
maximum depth of 300 centimeters (9.8 feet). The fill layer was most often made up of a
mottled mix of alluvial soils and processed sugar byproduct sometimes mixed with white
34

(10YR8/1) lime to a minimum depth of 10 centimeters (4 inches) and to a maximum depth of
approximately 2.1 meters (6.9 feet). In some cases, the lime is underlying the upper fill
layers with up to 30 centimeters (12 inches) of white (10YR8/1) lime.
Most commonly, the natural stratigraphy exposed during backhoe trenching
conformed to Norwood silt loam, Norwood silty clay and Miller silty clay loam described by
Mowery et al. (1960). See Appendix B for descriptions of all trench profiles. As a result of
the investigations conducted within Section D of the project area, 2 buried historic sites were
recorded. Each of these findings is discussed below.

Site 41FB317
Site 41FB317 is a buried historic artifact scatter identified in 2 adjacent trenches
excavated south of Oyster Creek (see Figure 4; Figure 6). The site is situated in a low-lying
open field currently used for harvesting hay approximately 260 meters (850 feet) south of
Oyster Creek and about 80 meters (260 feet) west of the eastern project boundary (see Figure
2).

Trench D2
The initial positive trench, D2, was excavated with north to south orientation. The
trench measured 8 meters (26 feet) in length and 1 meter (3 feet) in width. Trench D2 was
excavated to a depth of 300 centimeters (9.8 feet) below the ground surface. The trench
revealed 3 discrete depositional strata. From the ground surface to a depth of 60 centimeters
(24 inches), Stratum I is composed of strong brown (7.5YR5/6) silt mixed with sugar extract,
a thick, brown, and fine-grained substance. At a depth of 30 centimeters (24 inches), a
modern plastic decaying tarp was observed protruding from both the east and west trench
walls along the entire length of the trench. Between 60 and 80 centimeters (24 and 31
inches), Stratum II is composed of a dark brown (10YR3/3) blocky to rounded, friable
alluvium with clay loam texture. Stratum III is composed of a very thick layer of yellowish
red (5YR4/6) alluvium with silty loam texture. Stratum III ranges between 80 and 300
centimeters (31 inches and 9.8 feet) at which the trench excavation was terminated. The
artifacts that make up Site 41FB317 are dispersed across Stratum III of the trench between
150 and 200 centimeters (4.9 and 6.6 feet) below the surface.
Historic artifacts recorded in Trench D2 included a glass medicine bottle with a
maker’s mark that reads “GROVE’S TASTELESS CHILL TONIC PREPARED BY PARIS MEDICINE
CO. ST. LOUIS”, 1 whiteware ceramic sherd, 1 metal file, and 1 metal wrench. The glass bottle
was recorded at a depth of approximately 150 centimeters (4.9 feet), while all other artifacts
were observed at approximately 200 centimeters (6.6 feet) below the surface.
Research into the origin and temporal affiliation of the maker’s mark on the glass
bottle was conducted to determine a date of manufacture of the bottle. David W. Webb, a
historian in Henry County, Tennessee has created an historical timeline of the life of Edwin

Trench D13
Following the observations made in Trench D2, a second trench, designated Trench
D13 was excavated with north to south orientation approximately 10 meters (30 feet) west of
Trench D2. The trench measured 8 meters (26 feet) in length and 1 meter (3 feet) in width.
Trench D13 was excavated to a maximum depth of 250 centimeters (8 feet). Trench
stratigraphy was similar to Trench D2, with the exception of the presence of the plastic tarp.
The tarp was not observed in either wall of Trench D13. Historic artifacts recorded in this
trench included 1 clear flat glass shard and 1 vessel glass shard. Similarly, artifacts
associated with Site 41FB317 were recovered from Stratum III.

Trench D14
A third trench, Trench D14, was excavated with north to south orientation
approximately 8 meters (26 feet) east of Trench D2. The trench measured 10 meters (30
feet) in length and 1 meter (thee feet) in width. Trench D14 was excavated to a maximum
depth of 250 centimeters (8 feet). Stratigraphy observed in the Trench D14 wall profile was
unique compared to Trenches D2 and D13. Stratum I is composed of strong brown
(7.5TR5/6) fine-grained sugar extract fill mixed with 50 % gravels from the ground surface
to 30 centimeters (12 inches) below the surface. The same plastic tarp observed at the base
of Stratum I in Trench D2 was also observed along the entire profile at 30 centimeters (12
inches). Trench D14 was negative for cultural material.
Information gathered from Site 41FB317 included the completion of a Texas
archaeological site form, stratigraphic profile forms, and photographs. GPS coordinates were
collected at each end of Trenches D2, D13, and D14.
Based on the location of the material remains observed at Site 41FB317, the site is
likely associated with previous prison farm or sugar production activities. The glass bottle,
metal file, ceramic sherd, and glass shards were collected from Trench D2. These artifacts
will eventually be returned to the landowner. However, the function of the site is unknown.
Additional work is needed at Site 41FB317 to determine the site’s National Register
eligibility.

Site 41FB318
Site 41FB318 consists of the remains of a buried historic structure and associated
artifact scatter spanning a minimum of 150 meters (492 feet) along a north to south axis. It is
situated in an open field currently used for harvesting hay approximately 20 meters (66 feet)
south of Oyster Creek and about 53 meters (174 feet) east of the western boundary of the
permit area (see Figure 4: Figures 7 and 8). A total of 4 trenches were excavated during the
site delineation process.

Trench D12
The initially positive trench, Trench D12, was excavated with north to south
orientation. The trench measured 20 meters (60 feet) in length and 1 meter (3 feet) in width.
Trench D12 was excavated to a depth of 300 centimeters (9.8 feet). The trench revealed 4
discrete depositional strata (Figure 7) between the ground surface and a depth of 300
centimeters (9.8 feet). Between the ground surface and a depth of 50 centimeters (20 inches),
Stratum I is composed of a fill layer made up of mixed silt and sugar extract fill of strong
brown (7.5YR5/6) color. Following Stratum I, between 50 and 80 centimeters (20 and 31
inches) below the ground surface, Stratum II is a layer of white (10YR8/1) lime. Stratum III,
located between 80 and 100 centimeters (31 and 40 inches) below the surface is composed
of a natural layer of dark reddish brown (5YR4/4) silty loam alluvium. The last layer
observed, Stratum IV, is made up of a thick deposit of yellowish red (5YR4/6) alluvium
between 100 centimeters (40 inches) and the base of the trench at 300 centimeters (9.8 feet)
below the surface. Stratum IV contained a layer of historic structural material and debris
between 120 and approximately 140 centimeters (3.9 and 4.6 feet) below the surface. This
material was recorded as archaeological Site 41FB318.
Within Stratum IV of Trench D12, Site 41FB318 contained a discontinuous layer of
historic-age brick visible in the west wall of the trench (Figure 7). To expose more of the
site, the trench was widened to the east 120 centimeters (4 feet) and west 120 centimeters (4
feet). These areas were excavated mechanically to just above the depth of brick deposits, and
the remaining layer was skimmed away with a shovel. Samples of the skimmed soil were
screened through 0.64-centimeter (0.25-inch) wire mesh. None of the screened samples
contained historic artifacts. Once the brick layer was sufficiently exposed on both the east
and west sides of the widened sections of Trench D12, several wire nails, unidentified metal
fragments, and pieces of wooden plank were also identified in association with the layer of
brick. No artifacts were collected from Site 41FB318 within Trench D12.
The exposed sections of the site were mapped and photographed, and GPS
coordinates were collected prior to backfilling the trench. Following the excavation of
Trench D12, a series of 3 additional trenches (D15, D16, and D17)

were excavated in an attempt to delineate the north and south limits of the buried site (see
Figure 4; see Figures 7 and 8).
Trench D15
Trench D15 was placed approximately 50 meters (165 feet) north of Trench D12.
Trench D15 is located at slightly higher elevation than Trench D12. Trench D15 was also
excavated with north to south orientation. The trench measured 8 meters (26 feet) in length
and 1 meter (3 feet) in width. Trench D16 was excavated to a depth of 200 centimeters (6.6
feet).
The excavation of Trench D15 revealed 4 discrete depositional strata (see Figure 8)
between the ground surface and a depth of 200 centimeters (6.6 feet). Between the ground
surface and a depth of 90 centimeters (36 inches), Stratum I is composed of a fill layer made
up of silt mixed with sand of brown (7.5YR5/4) color. Following Stratum I, between 90 and
130 centimeters (36 inches and 4.3 feet) below the ground surface, Stratum II is a layer of
white (10YR8/1) lime. Stratum III, located between 130 and 160 centimeters (31 and 40
inches) below the surface is composed of a natural layer of reddish brown (5YR4/4) clay
alluvium. The last layer observed, Stratum IV, is made up of a brown (7.5YR4/4) mottled
with a darker shade of brown (7.5YR4/2) clay alluvium between 160 centimeters (5.2 feet)
and the base of the trench at 200 centimeters (6.6 feet) below the surface. Stratum IV of
Trench D15 contained historic structural material and debris at the base of the trench. It is
unknown how deep the deposits extend below the surface, but additional excavation beyond
200 centimeters (6.6 feet) would likely have caused significant damage to the recorded
deposits at the trench base.
Feature 41FB318-A
The excavation of Trench D15 also exposed a substantial amount of buried whole and
fragmented bricks, and contained a portion of a large very dark gray (10YR3/1) stain located
at the northern section of the trench base (see Figure 8). This stain is recorded as Feature
41FB318-A. The feature may represent an ash lens, indicative of a historic-age “burn event”,
although further investigation is warranted for confirmation. Trench D15 also contained an
exposed section of decaying metal pipe in the southern end of the trench (see Figure 8). The
exposed segment of the metal pipe measures approximately 12 centimeters (4 inches) in
diameter.
Feature 41FB318-B
Feature 41FB318-B is believed to represent additional brick structural remains of Site
41FB318. Feature 41FB318-B is visible on the ground surface between Trenches D15 and
D16 (see Figure 8). Due to the sloping topography and presence of fill at some locations, it
is likely that Site 41FB318 and brick Feature 41FB318-B are located on the same horizontal
plane and are associated. The homogeneity of the brick manufacture and color at both
locations also supports their likely association.

Trench D16
Trench D16 was excavated just northeast of Trench D15. This trench was placed
immediately south of the southern bank of Oyster Creek across from Historic Structure J, a
box culvert bridge, recorded in Section C of the project area. The trench is located on a
down slope from Trench D15, at a slightly lower elevation than Trench D15. Trench D16
was excavated with north to south orientation. The trench measured 8 meters (26 feet) in
length and 1 meter (3 feet) in width. Trench D16 was excavated to a depth of 250
centimeters (8.2 feet).
The excavation of Trench D16 revealed 4 discrete depositional strata. Between the
ground surface and a depth of 20 centimeters (8 inches), Stratum I is composed of dark
brown (10YR3/3) sand. Following Stratum I, between 20 and 70 centimeters (8 and 28
inches) below the ground surface, Stratum II is a layer of very fine brown (7.5YR4/4) sand.
Stratum II contained a single broken brick fragment between 30 and 40 centimeters (12 and
16 inches) below the surface. The boundary of Stratum II is very wavy and is as shallow as
40 centimeters (16 inches) below the surface and as deep as 70 centimeters (28 inches).
Stratum III, located between the shallow base of Stratum II at 40 centimeters (16 inches) and
the trench base at 250 centimeters (8.2 feet) below the surface, is composed of a thick layer
of very dark gray (10YR3/1) sandy loam. This stratum resembles Feature 41FB318-A
recorded at the base of Trench D15. It is possible that Stratum III of Trench D16 is
associated with the same possible “burn event”, although further investigation is necessary
for confirmation. This dark layer was not assigned a feature number because it was
contained as a discrete soil stratum within the trench.
Stratum III also contained a single broken brick fragment between 80 and 90
centimeters (32 and 36 inches) below the surface. The last layer observed, Stratum IV, is
made up of brown (7.4YR4/4) very wet sandy clay alluvium between 140 centimeters (4.6
feet) and the base of the trench at 250 centimeters (8.2 feet) below the surface. The water
table was penetrated at the base of Trench D16.

Trench D17
The last trench excavated in an effort to determine the northern and southern extents
of Site 41FB318 was Trench D17. Trench D17 was excavated just south of the initially
positive trench, D12. The trench is located at the same elevation as Trench D12. Trench
D17 was excavated with north to south orientation and measured 8 meters (26 feet) in length
and 1 meter (3 feet) in width. Trench D17 was excavated to a depth of 300 centimeters (9.8
feet).
The excavation of Trench D17 revealed 9 discrete depositional strata (see also
Appendix B). Between the ground surface and a depth of 10 centimeters (4 inches), Stratum
I is composed of very dark brown (10YR2/2) loam mixed with sugar extract fill. Following
42

Stratum I, between 10 and 60 centimeters (6 and 24 inches) below the ground surface,
Stratum II is a layer of mottled brown (10YR 7/2, 10YR6/6, and 10YR6/3) clay loam and
sugar extract fill. Between 60 and 75 centimeters (24 and 30 inches) below the surface,
Stratum III is made up of light brownish gray (10YR6/2) fine sand mixed with sugar extract
fill. Stratum IV is another layer of fill composed of gray (10YR6/1) fine sand mixed with
sugar extract between 75 and 90 centimeters (30 and 36 inches) below the surface. Below
Stratum IV, located between 90 and 110 centimeters (36 and 44 inches) below the surface, is
Stratum V composed of white (10YR8/1) lime fill.
Following the layer of lime is Stratum VI between 110 and 120 centimeters (44 and
48 inches). This layer is characterized as a thin black (10YR2/1) ash lens, likely associated
with a possible “burn event” at Site 41FB318 that was also recorded in Trenches D15 and
D16. This layer in Trench D17 was not assigned a feature number during this survey
because it was contained as a discrete soil stratum within the trench. Further work is
required to confirm its origin and whether it is in fact associated with Site 41FB318.
Stratum VII, is made up of brown (7.4YR4/4) silty clay alluvium between 120 and
150 centimeters (3.9 and 4.9 feet). Following this is another layer (Stratum VIII) of silty clay
alluvium of a slightly darker shade of brown (7.5YR4/2) between 150 and 180 centimeters
(4.9 and 5.9 feet) below the surface. Finally, the last recorded layer between 180 centimeters
(5.9 feet) and the base of the trench at 250 centimeters (8.2 feet) below the surface was
composed of another thick layer of brown (7.5YR4/4) silty clay alluvium.
Based on the review of a historic 1913 historic Sanborn map (ProQuest 2007), and
historic 1908 photograph (provided by Fort Bend Museum Association 2008) and a review of
the available historic literature (Armstrong 2000), it is almost certain that Site 41FB318
represents the remains of the original Imperial Mill and associated structures erected by Ellis
and Cunningham in 1883 (see Figure 4).
In the mid to late 1870s, Ellis and Colonel Edward H. Cunningham, members of the
same Civil War brigade formed a business partnership. In 1883, together, they built the
Imperial Sugar Mill on the Ellis Plantation.

“…Ellis and Cunningham built a new 600-ton raw sugar mill in 1883. It was
located on the Ellis lands about a mile west of the Cunningham mill at Sugar
Land, at what is known as Cooks Dam, near what is now Highway 6. They
named this mill the Imperial Mill, a name which would endure in the sugar
history of the state of Texas, and indeed nationwide (Armstrong 2000:41).”

The Imperial Mill and several associated structures are depicted on a 1913 Sanborn
map (ProQuest 2007) and in a circa 1908 photograph (provided by Fort Bend Museum
Association 2008). In 1914, 1 year after the map was published, the Imperial Mill burned to
the ground.

43

“During the grinding season of 1914, the Imperial raw sugar mill burned to
the ground and was never replaced. By then the remaining mill at Sugar Land
[at Cunningham Plantation] was adequate to process the declining sugar cane
crops grown in the area (Armstrong 2000:116).”

No artifacts were collected from any of the 4 trenches containing portion of the site.
Site 41FB318 has not been fully delineated due to uncertainties whether additional trench
excavation may cause further unnecessary destruction to potentially intact archaeological
deposits. Additional investigation at Site 41FB318 is warranted to fully delineate the extent
of the site, determine how much of the charred Imperial Mill remains are intact, and
determine the sites National Register eligibility.

SECTION E
Section E makes up approximately 22 hectares (55 acres) of the total project area
composed of the abandoned Imperial Sugar Company plant. Section E is made up of the old
Imperial Sugar factory complex. This section of the project area was not subjected to an
archeological survey. Rather, the entire plant was subjected to a thorough architectural
survey at the request of the THC. The results of the architectural survey are reported in
Sweeten et al. 2008.

CHAPTER VII. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This report presents the results of an intensive pedestrian cultural resources survey
and deep testing conducted on 301 hectares (743 acres) of property proposed for commercial
and residential development in Fort Bend County, Texas. The USACE, Galveston District is
the Lead Federal Agency. The project is being conducted to fulfill requirements set forth by
33 CFR Part 325, Appendix C - Procedures for the Protection of Historic Properties. This
Appendix establishes the procedures to be followed by the USACE to fulfill the requirements
set forth by 36 CFR Part 800 of the NHPA of 1966, as amended.
In 2001, the Texas GLO conducted a reconnaissance survey of approximately 223
hectares (550 acres) of the 301-hectare (743-acre) project area, which resulted in the
identification of Site 41FB284, a 1910-1960s prison camp and stockyard (Carpenter 2001).
The THC and the USACE determined that the GLO survey was inadequate given the
dynamic history of the area. Per a request by the THC and USACE, HRA Gray & Pape
subjected the entire 301-hectare (743-acre) property to an intensive pedestrian survey
supplemented with mechanical deep testing.
For this project, the “Permit Area” and the “Area of Potential Effect” were defined as
301 hectares (743 acres) of property in which the permitted action is to take place. Since the
Lead Federal Agency is the USACE, Galveston District, the term “Permit Area” is used in
this report. For this project, anticipated impacts are generally less than 1 meter (3 feet) over
most of the tract but may be up to 3 meters (9 feet) where deep impacts are required.
Detailed maps depicting the exact locations of the anticipated deep impacts within the permit
area have not been provided.
A background literature and site file search was conducted to identify the presence of
recorded sites near the project area. The search indicated that 22 previously recorded
archaeological sites are located within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the current project area.
One previously recorded Site (41FB284) was identified within the northern section of the
project area.
Fieldwork and reporting activities were completed with reference to state and federal
guidelines. Fieldwork required approximately 760 person hours to complete. Field
investigation within the project area consisted of a combination of walkover, shovel testing,
bucket-augering, and backhoe trenching.
As a result of the archaeological investigation, Site 41FB284 was revisited. Newly
recorded archaeological resources include 3 historic sites, designated sites 41FB316,
41FB317, and 41FB318 and 6 archaeological loci. Site trinomials were not sought for any of
the loci.
In addition to the archaeological findings, 2 historic-age landscape features and 16
historic-age structures were also documented. These architectural resources and landscape
45

modifications are documented in the architecture report prepared by Lena Sweeten and Tom
W. McKinney, PhD (2008).

NATIONAL REGISTER ELIGIBILITY CONSIDERATIONS
For a property to be considered eligible under Criterion A it must have made a
significant contribution to the broad patterns of history. Under Criterion B, a property must be
associated with the lives of significant individuals. Criterion C holds that a property is eligible
if it has the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction that represents
the work of a master, possesses high artistic values, or represents a significant and
distinguishable entity whose components lack individual distinction. According to Criterion D,
a property is eligible for the NRHP if it has information potential, or information that would
contribute to the historical knowledge of a region (United States Department of Interior [USDI]
1997). For buried archaeological sites, Criterion D is most often used to evaluate a site’s
NRHP eligibility.
Due to disturbed locations within the plow zone soil layers and lack of additional
materials or cultural features associated with Loci 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 they have not
maintained depositional integrity, and do not contain significant amount of materials by
which to obtain valuable information from. The lack of near-surface depositional integrity is
supported by previous extensive land-use modification including sugar cane farming,
irrigation system installation, and creek channalization activities. No additional investigation
is recommended at the 6 isolated archaeological loci based on a lack of information potential,
as described in Criterion D. Therefore, HRA Gray & Pape recommend all 6 loci as
ineligible for listing on the NRHP.
During this investigation, the northern half of previously recorded historic Site
41FB284 was revisited within Section A of the project area. Archaeologically, none of the
historic-age deposits recorded are intact and have lost provenience as a result of plowing
activities and landscape modifications. Therefore, HRA Gray & Pape recommends that the
archaeological deposits associated with Site 41FB284 as ineligible for National Register
status and that no further archaeological work be required at Site 41FB284. See Sweeten et
al. 2008 for management recommendations for the historic-age structures associated with
Site 41FB284.
The archaeological deposits at Site 41FB316 appears to have been mixed and
disturbed by previous plowing, landscape modification, and creek channalization and
dredging. This observation is supported by the historical research summarized in Chapter III
above. Therefore, HRA Gray & Pape recommend Site 41FB316 as ineligible for the
National Register and that no additional work be required at the site.
The function and nature of newly recorded Site 41FB317 is unknown. However, it is
nearly certain that the historic-age structural remains associated with newly identified Site
41FB318 represent a portion of the charred remnants of the original Imperial Mill, built in
1883 by business partners Cunningham and Ellis, and burned to the ground in 1914. Given
the relative proximity and depth of deposits at both Sites 41FB317 and Site 41FB318, it may
46

be that these sites are associated. Both of these sites are both located below several thick
layers of fill and may have intact deposits. At this time, the National Register eligibility of
these sites is unknown. HRA Gray & Pape recommend additional investigation at Site
41FB317 and 41FB318 to determine the nature and/or condition of each site and to determine
their National Register eligibility.
Management recommendations for all historic-age structures within the permit area
are provided in Sweeten et al. 2008. HRA Gray & Pape recommends that cultural resources
clearance be granted for the remainder of the permit area and that the project be cleared to
proceed as planned in these areas.
