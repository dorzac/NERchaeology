ABSTRACT
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) conducted a pedestrian survey of
112 miles of proposed and existing water line in Leon County, Texas in February and
March of 1994. The right-of-way on private land was established at 15 feet. This work
was sponsored by the Concord Robbins Water Supply Corporation of Concord, Texas.
In addition to the archaeological study, geologist Saul Aronow, Ph.D. evaulated the
geology and geomorphology of the project area and visited the location of each site
recorded.
The federal agency regulating this project was the Farmers Home
Administration. In all, 18 archaeological sites were recorded as a result of this project
(41LN386 - 41LN403). Of this number, 14 are prehistoric sites, 2 are historic sites, and
2 are sites containing both prehistoric and historic components. Newly recorded site
41LN389 and previously recorded site 41LN70 were determined to be out of the project
area. Numerous standing structures, some old enough to meet the age criteria for the
National Register of Historic Places, were found in the project area. Most of these,
however, were out of the right-of-way.
No diagnostic artifacts or features were found at any of the prehistoric sites within
the project area and no ceramics were recovered. Therefore, it is not possible to
comment on the age and/or function of these sites. Some of the prehistoric sites,
especially those on sandy hills above permanent streams, may have served as
campsites while others may represent temporary activity areas or field camps. The
temporary nature of certain sites is suggested by a low artifact density, often one flake
per shovel test.
Two sites with standing structures were found to be within the right-of-way. Site
41LN402 is an abandoned house that probably dates to the early to middle 20th century
and site 41LN403 is a house site and associated out buildings, including log cribs, that
probably dates to the early 20th century. Two sites contain prehistoric and historic
components. Site 41LN386 produced historic artifacts in the upper 30 cm of a shovel
test that may date to the late 19th and/or early 20th century. Site 41LN401 consists of a
possible prehistoric campsite sharing the landform with a brick and cemented well
upslope from a concrete dip tank. Twentieth century artifacts were found in several
shovel tests that suggest a house location.

Three prehistoric sites (41LN396, 41LN399, and 41LN401) are believed to have
medium yield potential and one prehistoric site (41LN391) is believed to have high yield
potential based on artifact density. These sites may be eligible for nomination to the
National Register of Historic Places and are recommended for eligibility testing if
avoidance is not possible. Four prehistoric sites (41LN386, 41LN392, 41LN397, and
41LN398) were not adequately shovel tested and are recommended for additional
testing to determine their research potential if avoidance is not possible. Two of these
sites (41LN386 and 41LN392) were not tested because the easement was refused. In
the case of site 41LN397 it was not clear if the site was in an area where an easement
was granted. Site 41LN389 is out of the project area andwas not tested.
All artifacts and records regarding this project are currently housed at the office
of Brazos Valley Research Associates. Upon completion of the project they will be
curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
I would like to thank everyone whose cooperation made the completion of this
project possible. The project sponsor, Concord Robbins Water Supply Corporation,
was most helpful. In addition to providing maps and information regarding the areas
that needed to be surveyed, the corporation also served as my contact with other
individuals in the county that proved to be helpful. Two of the corporation officials were
Mr. and Mrs. Speer. Mrs. Ruby Lee Speer runs the post office and local community
center at Concord. Mr. Speer drove with me on one occasion so I could find the
location of one of the proposed plant sites. The Speer's were a major source of
information for the county and the post offices and community center served as a
meeting place and contact point. Their help and kindness is greatly appreciated.
The fieldwork was conducted with the assistance of Robert C. Booth, Kelley
Lackey, and Roger G. Moore. Dr. Saul Aronow, Lamar University (retired) visited the
county and examined the geology and geomorphology of the project area and
contributed to the Environmental Setting section of this report. He also visited all of the
site locations and commented on their condition in terms of soil disturbance and
identified the landforms on which they were situated. His findings were used to write
the Recommendations section and Appendix II, Site Descriptions of this report.
Robert C. Booth analyzed the artifacts. The results of his findings appear in a
typed manuscript that is part of the curated records and are not included in this report.
Robert C. Booth and Kelley Lackey are thanked for performing the tedious task
of preparing the artifacts for curation. Lili Lyddon drafted the figures, and Lyndy Lawson
prepared the tables.
Assistance was also provided by the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL). Carolyn Spock, Head of Records, and her assistant, Rosario Casarez, helped
with the literature search and site recording process and records curation. Darrell
Creel, Head of Collections at TARL, assisted in the artifact curation process.

INTRODUCTION
Concord Robbins Water Supply Corporation plans to improve the domestic water
supply to rural Leon County, Texas by installing new pipe and meters at various
locations throughout the west-central portion of the county (Figure 1). In all, the project
area consists of 112 miles of state and county roads with a right-of-way of 15 feet.
Approximately 1.5 miles of the project area travels overland and is not adjacent to
existing roads at this time (Figure 2). Also, a new plant site is proposed and
construction is planned for an existing plant site. The locations of the plant sites are on
high sandy hills suitable for gravity powered operation.
Pursuant to the policy of the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA), Johnson
Engineers will attempt to place all new waterline on private land just inside the fence
line. In those areas where permission cannot be secured the line will be placed on
public line within the road right-of-way. On private land the depth of disturbance is
estimated at 36 inches. Those segments of line on public land may be deeper, possibly
4-5 feet. According to Johnson Engineers, Inc., all areas identified in this report as
significant or potentially significant will be avoided by placing the water line within the
public right-of-way.
Leon County is an area that contains numerous significant archaeological sites,
both prehistoric and historic. The area has been the subject of several major cultural
resources investigations such as the ongoing Jewitt Mine project to the north. Realizing
the potential for sites within the proposed waterline route, the Texas Historical
Commission, Department of Antiquities Protection, requested the area be examined by
a professional archaeologist in a letter to the Farmers Home Administration dated
December 21, 1993. In order to satisfy this requirement, Johnson Engineers, Inc.
retained the services of Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) to conduct the
cultural resources survey. The project number assigned by BVRA is 94-01.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The following general discussion of Leon County is taken from the soil survey
(Neitsch et al. 1989) and the 1984-1985 Texas Almanac (Kingston and Harris 1983).
Leon County is situated in the eastern part of Central Texas and consists of 690,861
acres or 1079 square miles including areas under water. It has an irregular shape and
is about 28 miles long by 40 miles wide. Elevation in the county varies between 630
feet above sea level in the west-central part of the county to about 140 feet in the
southeast area. Overall, the topography is characterized as undulating to gently rolling
and generally sloping to the southeast. Leon County is located in the West Gulf
Coastal Plain, Texas Claypan Area, and Texas Blackland Prairie Major Land Reource
Areas. The soils in the county formed under timber, post oak savannah, and prairie
vegetation. Those formed under timber or post oak savannah are light-colored fine
sandy loam to fine sand while soils that formed under grass consist of dark colored fine
sandy loam to clay. The county is drained by numerous creeks and streams that flow
into the Trinity and Navasota rivers which form the east and west boundaries of the
county, respectively. Annual rainfall varies from 39 to 46 inches. The January minimum
temperature is 38 degrees and the July maximum temperature is 95 degrees. These
climatic conditions create a growing season of 270 days. Because of the size of the
project area, several major soil types are present. Figure 3 depicts the area investigated
superimposed over a 1987 General Soil Map published in the soil survey for Leon
County. The applicable soils are described briefly below.

Padina-Silstid-Hearne: Gently sloping to moderately steep, deep, sandy and
loamy soils that are moderately well drained and well drained; on savannahs.

3.

Padina-Arenosa: Gently sloping to moderately steep, deep, sandy soils that are
moderately well drained and somewhat excessively drained; on savannahs.

6.

Axtell-Rader: Nearly level to strongly sloping, deep, loamy soils that are
moderately well drained; on savannahs.

7.

Margie-Jedd-Lexton: Gently sloping to steep, deep and moderately deep, loamy
soils that are well drained; on savannahs.

8.

Trawick-Bub-Cuthbert: Gently sloping to moderately steep, deep and shallow,
loamy soils that are well drained; in woodlands.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to a recently published planning document for the Eastern Planning
Region of Texas (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.1.2), Leon County is situated
within the Prairie-Savanna archeological study region. Although 385 sites have been
recorded at TARL prior to this survey, the site density in the county is low in terms of
sites per square mile. Figure 1.1.3 in the planning document indicates that Leon County
has only 0.001 - 0.1 sites per square mile. This includes it within those counties with
the lowest site density in the state. In 1985, according to a statistical overview prepared
by the Texas Historical Commission (Biesaart et al. 1985:83), Leon County contained
115 recorded sites. It is beyond the scope of this report to discuss in detail the
archaeological background of Leon County, especially when several recent in-depth
studies are available. Therefore, the following discussion is taken from the planning
document for the Eastern Planning Region and several of the more recent contract
reports. The interested reader is advised to consult these monographs for additional
information (Table 1).
The first major archaeological project to affect Leon County was the Lake
Limestone study (formerly Upper Navasota Reservoir). The lake is located in Leon,
Limestone, and Robertson counties with the majority of the project area in Limestone
County. The Texas Archeological Survey conducted this work in 1974 under contract
with the Brazos River Authority (Prewitt 1974; Prewitt and Dibble 1974). Only areas of
high site probability such as floodplains and valley margins along the Navasota River
and its major tributaries were surveyed. Fifty-two prehistoric sites were recorded within
the reservoir area. Of this number, 37 were found to be situated on the crests or slopes
of eroded valley margins. Fifteen historical localities were noted but not recorded as
sites.
Testing was conducted in 1975 to determine the National Register eligibility of
sites 41LN20 and 41RT2 (Prewitt 1975). These sites were selected to be tested first
because of their location within the proposed dam site about 7 miles northwest of
Marquez.
In 1976, 11 additional sites were tested for National Register eligibility (Prewitt
and Mallouf 1977). Two (41LN21 and 41LN25) were in the Leon County portion of the
reservoir.

Mitigation was conducted at four of the Lake Limestone sites in late 1977 under
the direction of David S. Dibble and Elton R. Prewitt (Mallouf 1979). One site (41LN21)
is in Leon County. The area excavated consisted of 16 square meters to dug to depths
of 60 to 70 cm. Three distinct concentrations of cultural materials were found and
designated as Areas A-C. Only Area A, however, was found to be undisturbed. It is in
Area A where work was concentrated.
Area A of site 41LN41 is situated on a sand-cropped Pleistocene terrace remnant
at the 99 foot contour overlooking the modern Navasota River channel at its narrowest
point within the study area. The prehistoric materials in this area were found to be
concentrated in a 20 x 20 meter area directly on top of the knoll where the
unconsolidated mantle is thickest. The 1976 testing revealed little cultural stratigraphy
with Late Prehistoric and Archaic artifacts found together in all levels excavated.
Cultural features were observed in the form of lithic concentrations and hearths at
depths ranging from 30 to 50 cm below the present ground surface. According to
Mallouf (1979:32), this indicates that the "artifact-bearing sandy mantle has been
increasing in thickness through time." He views this deposition as unconsolidated
sandy sediments left by high velocity floodwaters that periodically cover the site area.
8

The excavations revealed a prehistoric site believed to have been occupied
intermittently during the Middle Archaic (expanding stem dart points), Late Archaic
(contracting stem dart points), Late Prehistoric (arrow points and ceramics), and Historic
periods (post-1900 artifacts). In general, it was concluded that the Navasota River
basin was occupied, at least intermittently, from the Paleo-Indian through proto-Historic
time periods.
Following the Lake Limestone project, the next major study in Leon County was
conducted at Jewett Mine where work was performed from 1980 to 1991 and is still
ongoing. The majority of sites in the county are on Jewett Mine property and most of
our current knowledge of the prehistoric and early historic sites of the area has been
obtained from these studies. In fact, 50% of the previous investigations depicted in
Table 1 are Jewett Mine projects. Archaeological firms who have worked at the mine
include Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc., Geo-Marine, Inc., Prewitt and Associates,
Inc., and the Archeological Research Laboratory at Texas A&M University. There are
too many projects in Leon County to discuss each one in detail in this report. Therefore,
the more significant efforts are mentioned briefly, and all of the reports are listed in the
References Cited section.

The first effort at Jewett Mine was conducted by Espey, Huston & Associates,
Inc. (EHA) in 1979 (EHA 1980). This initial study consisted of an investigation of
previously recorded prehistoric and historic sites of the Jewett Mine area and a field
survey of 15% of the proposed Jewett Mine area and discovered 40 prehistoric sites, 8
prehistoric isolated occurrences, 12 historic sites, and one historic isolated occurrence.
In Leon County, 19 prehistoric sites (41LN27, 41LN29A, 41LN29B, 41LN30 - 41LN33,
41LN37 - 41LN41, 41LN43 - 41LN44, 41LN47 - 41LN51) and 25 historic sites
(41LN28A, 41LN28B, 41LN34 - 41LN36, 41LN42, 41LN45 - 41LN46, 41LN52 - 41LN55
- 41LN67) were recorded.
Of the 40 prehistoric sites recorded, only nine contained diagnostic artifacts and
no isolated specimens were found. Four hypotheses were formulated for consideration
in future research designs concerning Paleo-Indian site locations (EHA 1980:3-31).
These are (1) earlier sites undergo destruction due to continual erosion and collection
by later prehistoric as well as historic populations; (2) many of the sites are very deeply
buried and cannot be found by conventional subsurface testing; (3) it is probable that
early inhabitants were represented by a smaller more transient total population; and (4)
early people may have utilized a greater percentage of organic material in their total
subsistence technology.

Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc. continued their work at Jewett Mine by
surveying the first impact areas in the mine in 1980, an area of 1620.4 hectares. Fifteen
previously undocumented prehistoric sites were recorded during the survey. Artifacts at
the prehistoric sites consisted solely of lithic material with no ceramics found. The only
diagnostic artifact was a Williams-like dart point at 41LN76. Thirteen of the newly
recorded sites are in Leon County. They are 41LN68 - 41LN69, 41LN71, 41LN73,
41LN77, 41LN79, and 41LN81 - 41LN84. Several observations were made regarding
the prehistoric sites recorded during this survey (Voellinger and Freeman 1980:4-15).
All but two of the sites are located in transitional zones with
one site (41LN77) in the bottomland zone on a low knoll in
the floodplain of Birch Creek.
The physiographically transitional zones of the major creeks
of the Jewett Mine area continually provided the most
attractive qualities for prehistoric populations.
The average horizontal distance to water is 131 meters.
Eighty-nine percent of the sites are found within 250 meters
of water and 73 percent are located at or within 100 meters
of water.
In the previous two surveys discussed above, 93 historic sites were either
recorded or tentatively located in Leon County but not recorded. The report of the 1980
survey gives site numbers for historic sites found during these projects. The earlier,
1979 survey recorded 41LN45 and 41LN66, both 19th century house sites. In 1980, 12
historic sites were recorded. They are 41LN68, 41LN70, 41LN72, 41LN80, 41LN85 41LN89, and 41LN91 - 41LN92. These sites consist of house sites, a possible grave,
and a cemetery.
A 1981 survey by Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc. (Freeman and Voellinger
1982) of the first five-year Texas Railroad Commission Permit area was conducted.
The prehistoric sites appear to represent hunting and gathering economy that spanned
the Archaic through Neo-American periods. A central based wandering exploitation
system with base camps along the major creeks and specialized activity areas along
tributary streams is suggested. The historic sites date to the late 19th and early 20th
centuries and are related to the domestic, commercial, and industrial development,
and/or settlement of the area.
Fifty-seven prehistoric sites were found during this survey. They are 41LN93,
41LN96, 41LN99, 41LN101 - 41LN103, 41LN105 - 41LN107, 41LN109 - 41LN117,
41LN119 - 41LN120, 41LN122 - 41LN123, 41LN129 - 41LN141, 41LN143 - 41LN152,
41LN154 - 41LN162, and 41LN164 - 41LN166.

Diagnostic artifacts recovered during this survey indicate a prehistoric occupation
that spanned the early, middle, and late Archaic and the Neo-American stages.
Additionally, they are viewed as an indication of the area's culturally peripheral location
providing evidence of culture contact with areas to the north, east, and west.
A scarcity of sites in areas of shallow soils was noted by this and previous
surveys. Soil probes on the terraces and upland breaks along the lower expanses of
Mine Creek, for example, repeatedly indicated less than 20 cm of soils over a clay base.
In these areas sites were absent. Beginning with the first deep sand hill upstream,
however, an abundance of prehistoric sites was found (Freeman and Voellinger 1982:262). One suggestion for the preference of deep sandy soils is the possibility that certain
plants that prefer these deep soils were desired and exploited by prehistoric
populations. Prewitt and Grombacher (1974:7) found a scarcity of sites along the major
tributaries. They attribute this to the possibility that desirable or needed resources were
more readily available along the main stem valley than along the tributaries.
Freeman and Voellinger (1982:2-63) suggest that sites located on higher
terraces and upland margins are smaller in size and contain less material cultural
remains than those along the major creeks. The latter should represent habitation sites
with artifact assemblages reflecting the area's major occupations. Features such as
hearths, storage pits, and structural remains might be found in sites along the major
creeks while the smaller sites at higher elevations should contain activity specific tool
assemblages.
The authors (Freeman and Voellinger 1982:2-64) comment on the difficulty of
assessing site depth and size in the project area. Most sites contained a single flake in
shovel tests. According to them, "the general lack of surface evidence indicating the
presence of cultural manifestations will require testing far beyond the scope of an
archaeological survey to adequately address real site dimensions." The intensive
shovel testing during this survey sometimes failed to disclose a site's integrity. Many
sites, for example, have no obvious stratigraphy beyond the gradual change from humic
sand to sand to clayey sand.
In all, 46 historic sites were recorded. They are 41LN93 - 41LN98, 41LN100,
41LN103 - 41LN104, 41LN108, 41LN111, 41LN114, 41LN118, 41LN121, 41LN124 41LN129, 41LN133, 41LN138 - 41LN139, 41LN141 - 41LN142, 41LN145, 41LN148 41LN149, 41LN153, 41LN155, 41LN157 - 41LN159, 41LN163, and 41LN167 41LN177. These sites include the following types: mine, house sites, industrial
features, commercial buildings, outbuildings, and a cemetery.

11

In 1982, Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc. (Voellinger et al. 1983) tested sites
41LN138 and 41LN156 in Leon County. Site 41LN138 was determined to be ineligible
for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. Although burned rock
features were present at this site, these kinds of features have been exhaustively
studied by other researchers. Therefore, it was decided that additional excavation
would not provide significant or new information regarding this site.
Site 41LN156, however, was determined to be eligible for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places as it represents a major occupational site which
does not conform to current theories of settlement patterns during the Archaic and postArchaic stages and is in a relatively undisturbed condition.
In addition to the testing described above, the local Bear Grass Community was
documented and an attempt was made to find the exact location of the Bear Grass
Number 2 tunnels. Although considerable information regarding the community was
obtained through written records and first-hand accounts, the second objective was not
achieved.
The next contractor to work at Jewett Mine was Prewitt and Associates, Inc.
Beginning with National Register testing of sites 41LN134 and 41LN144 in 1984 (Fields
1984), seven different testing and mitigation projects were conducted through 1991.
These efforts include National Register testing of 7 prehistoric sites (41LN29A,
41LN106, 41LN146, 41LN149A - 41LN149D) and 2 historic sites (41LN57 and
41LN149A) in 1985 (Fields et al. 1986); excavation at sites 41LN149B and 41LN30 in
1986 (Fields 1987); National Register assessment of 6 prehistoric sites (41LN102,
41LN103, 41LN107, 41LN220, 41LN227, and 41LN237) in 1988 (Fields et al. 1988);
excavation at 2 prehistoric sites (41LN29A and 41LN106) in 1987 and 1988 (Fields
1990); National Register assessment of 5 prehistoric sites (41LN247, 41LN253,
41LN255, 41LN256, and 41LN272) and 3 historic sites (41LN247B, 41LN248A, and
41LN256A) in 1988 and 1989 (Fields et al. 1990); excavations at prehistoric site
41LN247 and limited testing at prehistoric sites 41LN253 and 41LN270 in 1989 (Fields
et al. 1991); and National Register assessment of 5 prehistoric sites (41LN39, 41LN249
- 41LN251, and 41LN260) in 1991 (Fields et al. 1992).
Prewitt and Associates, Inc. also conducted a large-scale survey of 10,000 acres
at Jewett Mine in 1987 (Fields 1988). This investigation is the first cultural resources
work to be done in this portion of the mine. This study consisted of three major areas:
the field survey, an intensive geomorphological evaluation, and integrating the data with
previous surveys to create a management plan utilizing information from 180 prehistoric
sites and 126 historic sites. In all, 51 prehistoric sites (41LN220 - 41LN245, 41LN247 41LN258, 41LN260 - 41LN261, 41LN266, 41LN269 - 41LN270, 41LN272 - 41LN273,
41LN275, 41LN277 - 41LN281) were recorded in Leon County as a result of this
project.
12

Of the historic sites, 34 are in Leon County. They are 41LN227, 41LN242,
41LN246, 41LN247A, 41LN247B, 41LN248A, 41LN248B, 41LN253, 41LN256A,
41LN256B, 41LN259, 41LN262 - 41LN265, 41LN267 - 41LN272, 41LN274, 41LN276,
41LN278, 41LN282 - 41LN287, 41LN289 - 41LN292.
A major part of this project was the synthesis of data from the area that resulted
in the resource management plan. The authors present their data in a format that
allows the reader to understand how they arrived at decisions concerning eligibility of
prehistoric and historic sites. Certain terms are defined and recommendations are
made for future work in the area.
Testing at sites 41LN30 and 41LN99 was performed by Mary Jane McReynolds
in 1985. This report was not available at this writing. Therefore, the results of this study
are not known.
Continuing work at Jewett Mine, the Archeological Research Laboratory at Texas
A&M University tested four historic sites (41LN108, 41LN114, 41LN157, and 41LN158)
for significance in 1987 (Panos et al. 1987). Not one of these sites was recommended
for additional work.
In 1988, the Archaeology Research Program at Southern Methodist University
conducted testing and excavation of Historic period sites (Jurney and Green 1993).
One of these sites (41LN227), the homestead of the Hardy Webb family from the 1880s
to circa 1910, is in Leon County. It was recommended for nomination to the National
Register of Historic Places.
The Archaeology Research Program at Southern Methodist University surveyed
205 acres in 1989 but found no sites in Leon County (Jurney 1992). Five previously
recorded sites in the county were evaluated for significance. They are 41LN56
41LN248B, 41LN259, 41LN267, and 41LN270. Not one of these sites was considered
to warrant additional work. Also, data recovery was initiated at the earliest historic
component of site 41FT363 in Freestone County.
Geo-Marine's involvement at Jewett Mine consisted of a study and evaluation of
the Evansville mines that produced lignite in the early 20th century from 1907 to 1931
(Lebo and Austin 1992). This informative and detailed project provides, in the authors'
(Lebo and Austin 1992:115) words, "a general context for examining lignite mining
communities and their associated cultural, archeological, architectural, and oral-history
resources." They state that no such study concerning industrial complexes in Texas
has been performed.

13

In addition to the Lake Limestone and Jewett Mine projects, other work has been
conducted in various parts of Leon County. Those known to the writer include a
transmission line survey by Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc. in 1988 (Sundborg 1988).
No sites were recorded but previously recorded multi-component site 41LN248 was
tested and found to not warrant additional work.
Also in 1985 a reconnaissance of areas proposed for sewer and water supply
improvements was conducted by Daniel E. Fox (1985) of the Texas Department of
Water Resources. No sites were found.
In 1987, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department surveyed portions of the
Keechi Creek Wildlife Management Area (Davis 1989). No sites were found in the 95
acres examined but one prehistoric site (41LN293) was recorded just outside of the
project area.
The last study known by this author to occur in the county was a cultural
resource survey of the proposed Fort Boggy State Park by James E. Corbin (1992).
Work began in the summer of 1992 and a number of sites was recorded. The report
was not available to the author at this writing. Therefore, the results of this study are
not discussed in this report.
The vast amount of work in Leon County, particularly Jewett Mine and Lake
Limestone, has resulted in the recording of over 400 sites in the region when adjacent
counties are included. In Leon County alone, the total number of recorded sites prior to
this study was 385. In addition to the numerous surveys, testing has been conducted at
56 prehistoric sites with data recovery performed at 14 sites. Despite problems with the
archaeological record of the region such as low site visibility and interpretability based
on survey data, poor preservation of organic remains, a scarcity of sites with clear
stratigraphy, and the prevalence of bioturbation and other disturbance factors, much
has been learned about the prehistory of the area. Fields et al. (1991) integrated data
from the eight excavated sites at Jewett Mine and three excavated sites at Lake
Limestone to compile the most recent synthetic effort for this area. This study resulted
in the isolation of 35 cultural components or analytical units. All but two of these units
represent occupations during the late Archaic, Woodland, or Late Prehistoric periods
(Fields et al. 1992). The interested reader is referred to these documents for more
information regarding the prehistoric and historic development of Leon County and
vicinity.

FIELD METHODS
This project was performed using the pedestrian survey method supported by
shovel testing and surface inspection of all eroded and otherwise exposed areas within
the right-of-way. The 112 mile project area was examined with creek crossings and
other areas of high site probability receiving the most attention. Prior to entering the
field, the site records at TARL were checked for the presence of previously recorded
archaeological sites in the project area and vicinity. In addition, a thorough review of
the existing literature for Leon County was conducted. The Principal Investigator
completed these tasks.
All areas that appeared suitable for the presence of prehistoric sites were shovel
tested. Each test was recorded on a shovel test log (Appendix I) and discussed in the
project notes. The excavated matrix was screened using 1/4 inch hardware cloth and
all recovered artifacts were collected and bagged. In all, 91 shovel tests were
excavated. Once a site was located, the field crew noted its presence on the proper
topographic quadrangle and moved to another location. Later, selected sites received
additional tests in order to obtain information regarding site size and significance. In
those cases where sites were disturbed to the point where integrity was obviously
affected, additional tests were not considered necessary. Two sites (41LN388 and
41LN401) were mapped using a tape and compass. These field sketches were drafted
and appear in Appendix II of this report. A brief examination of the artifacts collected
during this project was made. This information has been typed and is part of the
records curation. Standing structures along the right-of-way were noted and those
believed to be older than 50 years were located and marked on topographic maps and,
in some cases, photographed. No historic structure out of the right-of-way was
assigned an official TARL site number. All sites, prehistoric and historic, were given the
field designation, Temporary Site (TS). All site locations are registered with TARL and
have been assigned formal numbers.
It is the intention of the Concord Robbins Water Supply Corporation to be able to
utilize both sides of the road throughout the project area. Therefore, BVRA examined
both sides of the road at all creek crossings and at site locations. There are stretches of
road that pass through disturbed areas, such as along the railroad right-of-way and
across uplands distant from creeks and other streams. These areas were examined but
in a more cursory manner. This was accomplished by the traditional windsheld survey
or by walking along the right-of-way with little, if any, shovel testing or probing.
Areas to be surveyed were checked against the engineering maps provided by
Johnson Engineers, Inc. to make sure permission had been granted before crossing
fences onto private land. This was a difficult process at times when creek crossings or
other landmarks were not noted on the engineering maps.
15

Six topographic quadrangles provide coverage of the project area. These are
Jewett (1965, photorevised 1982), Margie (1964, photorevised 1982), Marquez (1965,
photorevised 1982), Robbins (1965, photorevised 1982), Round Prairie (1966,
photorevised 1982), and Spring Seat (1964, photorevised 1982).
All artifacts and records created as a result of this project have been placed in
permanent curation at TARL. In addition to the normal distribution of this report, copies
were given to the Office of the State Archeologist and the Texas State Library.

16

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
This investigation covered 112 miles of right-of-way and resulted in the discovery
of 18 archaeological sites registered with TARL as 41LN386 through 41LN403. Of this
number, 14 sites contain only prehistoric materials, 2 are historic and consist of
standing structures, and 2 contain both prehistoric and historic components. Prehistoric
sites 41LN70 and 41LN389 were determined to be out of the project area.
Prehistoric Sites
Prehistoric sites greatly outnumber historic sites within the right-of-way. This is
viewed as a sampling bias due to the restrictions imposed by the 15 foot right-of-way on
private land. Historic houses and other standing structures, for example, are common
along the roads that comprise the project area. However, the vast majority was situated
out of the right-of-way, some by only a few feet. If every standing structure in close
proximity to the roads travelled were recorded as sites, the category of historic sites
would exceed prehistoric sites by a large margin.
The 16 localities containing prehistoric artifacts were found on landforms
containing sandy soils overlooking streams that are believed to have been permanent or
semi-permanent sources of water in prehistoric times. Some of these are major
streams such as Brushy Creek while others are on tributaries of major streams. No
prehistoric sites were found in modern floodplain settings. All of the sites in this
category are defined as terrace or hill slope sites. Those sites on hill slopes compare to
"shoulderslope" sites as defined by Fields (1988:197-198). It is possible that a few
sites, such as 41LN401, may extend to the summit of the landform on which they are
located but this was not confirmed through shovel testing or surface investigation.
In order to evaluate the research potential of these sites, each site was
categorized according to artifact density (Table 2). Fields (1988:255) ordered his
sample using artifact density to create the following categories:
Very Low Density: Sites with no artifacts or at most a single artifact from shovel
tests.
Low Density: Sites with more than one but less than three artifacts per positive
test or one artifact per multiple test.
Moderate Density: Sites with three to six artifacts per positive test.
High Density: Sites with more than six artifacts per positive test.

The lack of diagnostic artifacts and features in these sites makes it difficult to
discuss such attributes as age and function. The prehistoric sites located during this
survey are classified as lithic scatters, a term consistent with the findings by Fields
(1988). In terms of their actual function, these sites appear to conform to the term "Field
Camp" described by Fields (1988:253). According to him, a field camp is a site where a
group would maintain itself during its procurement foray.

18

Sites of this type may resemble in some ways more permanent campsites.
Fields (1988:253) states that field camps have few, if any, features; moderately
homogeneous artifact assemblages; low-intensity tool use; a lithic technology focusing
on tool resharpening and rejuvenation (low tool to debitage ratio); a high ratio of edgemodified flakes to formal tools; low artifact densities; limited horizontal patterning of
material remains; and limited variety of lithic raw materials. These criteria, for the most
part, can be applied to the sites found during this project.
In summary, not one of the prehistoric sites can be assigned to a particular time
period or classified according to type or function. It is possible that some of the sites,
especially those on the major streams such as Brushy Creek, served as campsites that
may have been occupied on a more than temporary basis. However, there are not
enough artifactual data to hypothesize anything but a temporary or ephemeral
occupation at any of these sites at this time. More detailed information regarding each
site can be found in Appendix II, Site Descriptions.
Historic Sites
Four sites were found that could be classified as historic. Two sites (41LN402
and 41LN403) consist of standing structures with no prehistoric component present.
The other two (41LN386 and 41LN401) contain both prehistoric and historic
components and were discovered through shovel testing.
All four historic sites are related to farming/ranching or rural life in the early
twentieth century. The two sites with standing structures are a frame house (41LN402)
in very poor condition with no outbuildings present and a frame house (41LN403) in
excellent condition that appears to be inhabited with several outbuildings. The only
structures at 41LN403 within the right-of-way are several log cribs that are clustered
together under a common roof. These cribs are still being used and are made of pine
logs that are joined by saddle notching. Although the log cribs are interesting
structures, they are not rare. In fact, they are very common in East Texas (Jordan
1978) and quite numerous in the project area.
The two remaining historic sites consist of buried artifacts in the upper 40 cm with
no features present (41LN386) and buried historic materials near a well that is upslope
from a dip tank (41LN401). At 41LN386, a structure is depicted on the topographic map
Spring Seat as being just to the north of the area tested and recent wood and tin,
suggestive of a collapsed shed, was observed in this area. The artifacts recovered are
typical of a residence and include cut nails, small pieces of brick, clear glass fragments,
leather, and shell. The glass is thin and may be window glass. The cut nails cannot be
dated, but it is known that cut nails were used from the 1850s to the present.

19

Site 41LN401 is believed to represent a house site. The artifacts recovered are
typical of a residence and include clear glass (possibly window glass), a Coca Cola
bottle fragment, and a metal staple. A ceramic body sherd was observed on the
surface. Additional support for a house at this location is the well and presence of
domestic iris plants. The well is constructed of modern brick covered with a veneer of
cement. This feature is believed to be a well instead of a cistern because of its straight
sides. Cisterns are often bell-shaped to collect and hold water. The age of this site is
not known, but the artifacts suggest an early 20th century occupation. Cattle dip tanks
were commonly built during the tick infestation period of the 1920s and 1930s, although
the dipping program began in the Jewett area around 1915 and was federalized in the
1930s according to a local informant interviewed during the testing project conducted by
Texas A&M University (Panos et al. 1987:23).
Eight shovel tests and one informal probe was dug in the area of 41LN401. Of
these, three shovel tests and the probe produced historic artifacts. The probe and one
of the shovel tests were dug specifically in close proximity to the well. The test closest
to the well yielded a prehistoric chert flake mixed with the historic materials. It was
obvious at the time that this area had been disturbed. The size of this site is not known
but it is estimated to be 40 x 60 meters based on shovel test data and the presence of
the well. This does not include the dip tank downslope.
The historic sites in the project area appear to be recent, dating to sometime
during the early 20th century. This period conforms to what Fields (1988:292-293)
refers to as the "Anglo-American Late Modern Period, 1900-Present.

20

RECOMMENDATIONS
In general, the prehistoric and historic sites found in the project area are not
considered significant and therefore not eligible for nomination to the National Register
of Historic Places. The prehistoric sites as a group are problematic in that no data such
as diagnostic artifacts or features were found that could aid in determining site age
and/or function. These sites were categorized according to their apparent artifact
density following the formula utilized by Fields (1988) in a survey of the 1989-1993
permit area at Jewett Mine by Prewitt and Associates. The yield potential varies from
very low to high. Those sites rated as medium or high are considered to be worthy of
additional work if avoidance is not possible. Three sites are believed to have medium
yield potential: 41LN396, 41LN399, and 41LN401. One site (41LN391) is believed to
have high yield potential. Each of these sites can be avoided by placing the water line
in other areas.
Four sites did not receive adequate testing to evaluate their yield potential. It is
recommended that additional testing be conducted at 41LN386, 41LN392, 41LN397,
and 41LN398 if avoidance is not possible.
Site 41LN386 can be avoided by placing the water line within the public right-ofway on either side of the road or on private land on the south side of the road.
Site 41LN391 can be avoided by placing the water line in public right-of-way on
either side of the road or on private land on the west side of the road.
Site 41LN392 can be avoided by placing the water line within the public right-ofway on either side of the road or on private land on the south side of the road.
Site 41LN396 can be avoided by placing the water line on the south side of the
road. Although sites 41LN397 and 41LN398 are believed to have low yield potential,
they did not receive adequate testing and are recommended for additional shovel tests.
Placement of the water line on the south side of the road would avoid all of these sites
and negate the need for additional testing at 41LN397 and 41LN398.
Site 41LN397 can be avoided by placing the water line within public right-of-way
or on private land on the south side of the road.
Site 41LN398 can be avoided by placing the water line within public right-of-way
or on private land on the south side of the road.

21

Site 41LN399 can be avoided by placing the water line within the public right-ofway on either side of the road. Permission was not granted for investigation on the west
side of the road. This area must be examined before it can be cleared for construction.
Site 41LN401 can be avoided by placing the water line within the public right-ofway on either side of the road or on private land on the west side of the road.
The historic sites in the project are also not significant and not considered eligible
for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. At site 41LN403 it is
recommended that the log cribs not be harmed should the water line be placed in the
vicinity of these structures?
Site 41LN402 is not considered significant at this time. It is recommended,
however, that the final decision be made by the Department of Antiquities Protection
after consulting with the architectural historians at the Texas Historical Commission.
Site 41LN386 is recommended for additional shovel testing before its
significance can be determined if avoidance is not possible. It can be avoided by
placing the water line within public right-of-way on either side of the road or on private
land on the south side of the road.
Not all of the landowners agreed to allow the Concord-Robbins Water Supply
Corporation on their land. As a result, these areas were not examined during this study.
In the event permission is granted in the future, it is recommended that these tracts be
surveyed prior to construction.

APPENDIX II: SITE DESCRIPTIONS
41LN70
This historic site is on the Round Prairie quadrangle and is located at the
end of county road 441. Vance O. Langley recorded it in 1980 during a survey of
Jewett Mine for Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc.
Topographically, it is on a hilltop 1.1 kilometers east of Birch Hollow
Creek. In 1980, the site consisted of an occupied frame house and a log barn
constructed of hewn logs that may have been taken from an earlier log house.
The age of the buildings is not stated on the site form. This site is at the end of
the county road and is essentially out of the project area. It is recommended that
construction be allowed to proceed in the area as planned as long as it does not
affect the site as described by the recorders.
41LN386
This multi-component site is on the Spring Seat quadrangle and is located
on both the north and south sides of State Highway 7 on the west bank of the
confluence of Boyd Branch and McDaniel Creek. William E. Moore and Roger G.
Moore discovered it on February 1, 1994. According to the engineering maps
provided by Johnson Engineers, Inc. the entire site area is on land belonging to
Mrs. Jean Pickard.
Topographically, it is just off the crest of the hill at the 440 foot contour.
The prehistoric component consists of a small tertiary flake fragment of very finegrained gray chert found at 50 cm on the south side of the highway on private
land and a larger flake fragment found at 120 cm on the north side of the road,
also on private land. The public right-of-way was not tested, and no artifacts
were observed in exposed areas. Since no diagnostic artifacts or features were
found, the age and function of this site are not known. The size of this site has
not been determined.
The historic component was observed on the north side of the road on
private land and consists of sheet metal fragments, two cut nails, and small
pieces of brick, glass, leather, and shell. All were in the upper 30-40 cm. Based
on the presence of cut nails, the historic component can date from the 1850s to
the present. A collapsed structure was noted just to the north and an abandoned
structure is depicted on the topographic map in this area.

Following a visit to 41LN386 by geologist Saul Aronow, it was concluded
that the portion of the site on the south side of the highway on private land has
been disturbed by windthrows, an erosional gully, and road construction. That
part of the site within the public right-of-way was probed with a shovel and found
to contain disturbed soils, possibly due to road construction. The north side on
private land, however, appears to contain undisturbed deposits. Since the site
was tested to 128 cm without reaching bedrock clay, the possibility of deeply
buried deposits must be considered. That part of the site within the public rightof-way on the north side is very disturbed through road construction and a buried
telephone cable.
41LN387
This prehistoric site is on the Jewett quadrangle and is located on the east
side of an unimproved road and the east bank of an unnamed tributary of Buck
Creek. Robert C. Booth and Kelley Lackey discovered it on February 1, 1994.
According to the engineering maps provided by Johnson Engineers, Inc. the site
is on land owned by Willie B. Speer.
Topographically, it is on a hill slope consisting of fine sandy loam at the
430 foot contour. The site was identified by the presence of a small tertiary flake
fragment of light brown chert found at 20 cm in a disturbed context in which a
piece of plastic was also recovered in the same stratum. Clay was encountered
at 28 cm. Since no diagnostic artifacts or features were found, the age and
function of this site are not known. The size of this site has not been determined.
One test in the site area was sterile.
Following a visit to 41LN387 by geologist Saul Aronow, it was concluded
that the entire site area has been disturbed by road construction and unknown
forms of land alteration, possibly grading or scraping. The tributary is clearly an
intermittent stream that probably did not provide a dependable source of water
on a regular basis in prehistoric times, and it is possible that it is a gully formed
by runoff from Buck Creek and may be recent. The single shovel test and
surface examination of the site area are considered adequate for this site.
41LN388
This prehistoric site is on the Jewett quadrangle and is located on the west
side of county road 447 (Concord Road) and the north bank of Brushy Creek
(Figure 1). William E. Moore and Robert C. Booth discovered it on February 2,
1994. According to the engineering maps provided by Johnson Engineers, Inc.
the site is on land belonging to Delbert L. Karnei.

Figure 1. Map of Site 41LN388

Topographically, it is on the slope of a sandy hill above the floodplain at
the 380 foot contour. The site was discovered by the presence of a drill or
perforator made on a jagged chert "chunk" found at 30-40 cm on private land.
Also, two sandstone fragments and some extremely friable chalky bone
fragments were recovered from the same shovel test. Two additional tests dug
upslope on private land yielded two flakes in each test at 30-50 cm and two tests
in the same area were sterile. The combination of positive and negative tests
suggests a north-south site dimension of 40 meters. The landform to the west
also appears to be likely a continuation of this site but it was not tested since it is
clearly out of the right-of-way.
No tests were dug in the public right-of-way on either side of the road or
on private land on the east side of the road. The public right-of-way on the west
side of the road is likely a continuation of the site and may contain cultural
materials. The other areas, however, are very disturbed and and no evidence of
this site was found even though several exposed areas were thoroughly
examined. Since no diagnostic artifacts or features were found, the age and
function of this site are not known.
Following a visit to 41LN388 by geologist Saul Aronow, it was concluded
that the site probably contains undisturbed deposits in a sandy loam that extends
to 85 cm before encountering bedrock clay. The rest of the right-of-way, public
and private, is disturbed through road construction and erosion.
41LN389
This prehistoric site is on the Jewett quadrangle and is located on the north side
of F.M. 1469 and the west bank of Starrett Branch. William E. Moore and Robert
C. Booth discovered it on February 2, 1994. According to the maps provided by
Johnson Engineers, Inc. the site is on land belonging to W. C. Dubois.
This site is out of the project area and was not formally investigated. It
was discovered by the presence of flakes on the surface of a sandy hill that had
been quarried for sand. Any future plans for the installation of water line in this
area should include a formal investigation of this site.
41LN390
This prehistoric site is on the Jewett quadrangle and is located on the
north side of State Highway 7 and the west bank of an unnamed tributary of Buck
Creek. Robert C. Booth discovered it on February 2, 1994. Land ownership has
not been determined.

Topographically, it is on a sandy hill above the creek to the east at the 420
foot contour. The site was discovered by the presence of a tertiary flake
fragment on the north side of the highway on private land at 0-5 cm and a piece
of tabular limestone that appears to be notched (found at 5-30 cm). One test in
the site area was sterile.
No tests were dug in the public right-of-way on either side of the road or
on private land on the south side of the road. Surface investigation of exposed
areas on the south side of the highway did not produce evidence of the site in
this area. Since no diagnostic artifacts or features were found, the age and
function of this site are not known. The size of this site has not been determined.
Following a visit to 41LN390 by geologist Saul Aronow, it was concluded
that this site might contain undisturbed deposits on private land on the north side
of the road. The public rights-of-way on both sides of the road, however, have
been disturbed through road construction and erosion, and the landform on the
south side is likewise disturbed.
41LN391
This prehistoric site is on the Margie quadrangle and is located on the east
side of county road 1147 and the west bank of Vestal Branch at the confluence of
one of its tributaries. Robert C. Booth discovered it on February 3, 1994.
According to the engineering maps provided by Jonnson Engineers, Inc. the site
is on land owned by Roma Kirkland.
Topographically, it is on a sandy terrace at the 500 foot contour. The site
was discovered by the presence of a secondary flake, a biface fragment, and a
tested cobble found in a shovel test at 80-90 cm within the private right-of-way
and 7 flakes found between 20 and 60 cm in a second test in the same area.
No tests were dug in the public right-of-way on either side of the road or
on private land on the west side of the road. Surface investigation of the road
and exposed areas on both sides of the road failed to produce evidence of this
site. Since no diagnostic artifacts or features were found, the age and function of
this site are not known. Site boundaries are estimated to be 30 x 50 meters
based on the size of the landform in the site area.
Following a visit to 41LN391 by geologist Saul Aronow, it was concluded
that this site might contain undisturbed deposits on private land and in the public
right-of-way on the east side of the road. The public right-of-way and private land
on the west side have been disturbed through road construction and erosion.

41LN392
This prehistoric site is on the Margie quadrangle and is located on the
north side of state highway 7 and the west bank of Brushy Creek. Actually, it is
on a ridge that lays between the main channel of Brushy Creek and one of its
tributaries to the west. Robert C. Booth discovered it on February 4, 1994.
According to the engineering maps provided by Johnson Engineers, Inc. the site
is on land owned by David H. Morris.
Topographically, it is on a sandy terrace at the 370 foot contour. The site
was discovered by the presence of a biface fragment of tan, fine-grained chert on
the surface. No shovel tests were dug in the area of the surface find, but testing
was conducted on the south side of the highway. Since no diagnostic artifacts or
features were found, the age and function of this site are not known. The size of
this site has not been determined.
Following a visit to 41LN392 by geologist Saul Aronow, it was concluded
that this site might contain undisturbed deposits within the private right-of-way on
the north side of the road. The public right-of-way on the north side, however,
has been disturbed through road construction and erosion, and the public and
private rights-of-way on the south side are likewise disturbed.
41LN393
This prehistoric site is on the Margie quadrangle and is located on the
north side of State Highway 7 and the east bank of a tributary of Brushy Creek.
Robert C. Booth discovered it on February 4, 1994. According to the engineering
maps provided by Johnson Engineers, Inc. the site is on land owned by Fred R.
McCauley.
Topographically, it is on a low flat hilltop at the 390 foot contour. The site
was discovered by the surface find of a flake of fine-grained chert in the backdirt
of a telephone pole and a possible biface of silicified wood and a chert flake on
an eroded surface below the first find. No shovel tests were dug in the site area.
Since no diagnostic artifacts or features were found, the age and function of this
site are not known. The size of this site has not been determined.
Following a visit to 41LN393 by geologist Saul Aronow, it was concluded
that the entire site area appears to be disturbed through road construction and
erosion. Also, bedrock clay appears to be present at or near the surface.

41LN394
This prehistoric site is on the Jewett quadrangle and is located on both
sides of State Highway 7 and the west bank of Buck Creek. William E. Moore
and Robert C. Booth discovered it on February 2, 1994. According to the
engineering maps provided by Johnson Engineering, Inc. the site is on land
owned by Bill Shepperd (north side) and Marry Shepperd (south side)
Topographically, it is on the slope of a sandy hill at the 410 foot contour
above the active floodplain to the east. The site was discovered by the surface
find of 2 flakes (not collected) on the south side of the highway at the fence line.
It was on the lower slope of this landform. A shovel test was dug on the north
side of the highway on private land and a flake fragment of reddish fine-grained
chert was found at 20 cm in a disturbed soil that terminated at bedrock clay at 40
cm.
No tests were dug in the public right-of-way on either side of the road or
on private land on the south side of the road. Since no diagnostic artifacts or
features were found, the age and function of this site are not known. The size of
this site has not been determined.
Following a visit to 41LN394 by geologist Saul Aronow, it was concluded
that bedrock clay exists at or near the surface over most of the site area on both
sides of the road. The slope of this landform on both sides of the road is rather
steep in places that have resulted in very shallow soils in these areas due to
erosion. The site appears to be disturbed on both sides of the road on private
land and especially within the public right-of-way.
41LN395
This prehistoric site is on the Margie quadrangle and is located on both
sides of county road 1147 and the east bank of a tributary of Vestal Branch.
William E. Moore and Saul Aronow discovered it on February 16, 1994.
According to the engineering maps provided by Johnson Engineers, Inc. the site
appears to be on land owned by James Neyland (east side) and Eleanor Dubbe
(west side).
Topographically, it is on a sandy terrace at the 580 foot contour. The site
was discovered by the presence of a flake (not collected) on the surface within
the private right-of-way on the west side of the road. A shovel test was
excavated in this area to 50 cm and was sterile. It was terminated because a
friend of the landowner (Ms Dubbe) said that permission had not been granted
dig on this side of the road. A check of road and public rights-of-way did not
reveal additional evidence of a site.

On March 23, 1994, two shovel tests were dug on the east side of the
road within the private right-of-way and two flakes were found in one test at 3050 cm. The other test was sterile. The deepest test was dug to 70 cm without
reaching clay. Since no diagnostic artifacts or features were found, the age and
function of this site are not known. The size of this site has not been determined.
Following a visit to 41LN395 by geologist Saul Aronow, it was concluded
that this site may contain undisturbed deposits within the private right-of-way on
both sides of the road. The public rights-of-way, however, have been disturbed
through road construction and erosion. Permission must be obtained from the
landowner on the west side to continue testing in this area.
41LN396
This prehistoric site is on the Round Prairie quadrangle and is located on
the north side of county road 436 and the north bank of Mill Creek. Roger G.
Moore and Kelley Lackey discovered it on February 16, 1994. According to the
engineering maps provided by Johnson Engineers, Inc. the site is on land owned
by Matthew O. Smith (north side), Henry Padgett (south side), and Margaret
Haney (south side).
Topographically, it is on a sandy ridge or slope above the active and
deeply incised floodplain of Mill Creek at the 370 foot contour. The site was
discovered by the presence of a flake in a shovel test at 50 cm in the public rightof-way. A second test was dug just across the fence on private land and
produced 4 flakes between 20-50 cm. No tests were dug on the south side of the
road. Since no diagnostic artifacts or features were found, the age and function
of this site are not known. The size of the site has not been determined.
This site is approximately 300 meters west of 41LN398 and on the same
landform. The two were assigned separate numbers because of their separation
by a low area or depression in the ridge. It is likely that the entire ridge in this
area contains evidence of prehistoric utilization.
Following a visit to 41LN396 by geologist Saul Aronow, it was concluded
that this site contains undisturbed deposits within the private right-of-way on the
north side of the road, perhaps to a depth of 112 cm (the depth of the discovery
shovel test), and parts of the public right-of-way on the north side of the road,
although some of this area is partially disturbed through road construction and
erosion. The private right-of-way on the south side is also disturbed through road
and house construction and possibly a buried telephone cable. It is believed that
intact deposits are not present in this area.

This prehistoric site is on the Round Prairie quadrangle and is located on
the north side of county road 436 and the north bank of Mill Creek. It was
discovered on February 16, 1994 Roger G. Moore and Kelley Lackey. According
to the engineering maps provided by Johnson Engineers, Inc. the site is on land
owned by Matthew O. Smith (north side), A. D. Patterson (north side), Henry
Padgett (south side), and Cheryl and Kirby Curr (south side).
Topographically, it is on a sandy ridge or slope above the active and
deeply incised floodplain of Mill Creek at the 370 foot contour. The site was
discovered by the presence of a flake in a shovel test at 60 cm in the public rightof-way. One test was dug in the private right-of-way on the south side of the
road and was sterile and in disturbed soil. No tests were dug in the public rightof-way on the south side of the road. Since no diagnostic artifacts or features
were found, the age and function of this site are not known. The size of this site
has not been determined.
This site is approximately 100 meters east of 41LN398 and on the same
landform. The two were assigned separate numbers because of their separation
by a low area or depression in the ridge. It is likely that the entire ridge in this
area contains evidence of prehistoric utilization.
Following a visit to 41LN397 by geologist Saul Aronow, it was concluded
that this site may contain undisturbed deposits within the private right-of-way on
the north side of the road, perhaps to 75 cm (the depth of the shovel test). The
public right-of-way on the north side of the road has been partially disturbed
through road construction and erosion; however, intact deposits may be present.
The public right-of-way on the south side of the road has been disturbed by road
construction and possibly a buried telephone cable. The private right-of-way on
the south side is also disturbed through road and house construction and
possibly a buried telephone cable. The disturbance on private land on the south
side of the road was documented by shovel testing and discussions with the
landowner.
41LN398
This prehistoric site is on the Round Prairie quadrangle and is located on
the north side of county road 436 and the north bank of Mill Creek. It was
discovered on February 17, 1994 William E. Moore and Kelley Lackey.
According to the engineering maps provided by Johnson Engineers, Inc. the site
is on land owned by Matthew O. Smith (north side) and Henry Padgett (south
side).

Topographically, it is on a sandy ridge or slope above the active and
deeply incised floodplain of Mill Creek at the 370 foot contour. The site was
discovered by the presence of a flake in a shovel test at 60 cm in the private
right-of-way. No tests were dug in the public right-of-way on either side of the
road or in the private right-of-way on the south side of the road. Since no
diagnostic artifacts or features were found, the age and function of this site are
not known. The size of this site has not been determined.
This site is approximately 300 meters east of 41LN396, 100 meters west
of 41LN397, and on the same landform. The three sites were assigned separate
numbers because of their separation by a low area or depression in the ridge. It
is likely that the entire ridge in this area contains evidence of prehistoric
utilization.
Following a visit to 41LN398 by geologist Saul Aronow, it was concluded
that this site might contain undisturbed deposits within the private right-of-way on
the north side of the road, perhaps to 70 cm (the depth of the shovel test). The
public rights-of-way, however, have been disturbed through road construction.
The private right-of-way on the south side is also disturbed through road and
house construction.
41LN399
This prehistoric site is on the Round Prairie quadrangle and is located on
the north side of county road 1146 and the east bank of Birch Creek. William E.
Moore and Kelley Lackey discovered it on February 17, 1994. According to the
engineering maps provided by Johnson Engineers, Inc. the site is on land owned
by Mr. W. A. Clute.
Topographically, it is on a high sandy ridge above the active floodplain of
Birch Creek at the 425 foot contour. The site was discovered by the presence of
two flakes in a shovel test at 30 cm in the private right-of-way. Two additional
shovel tests were dug in the site during a second visit. Shovel Test 80 was dug
to 60 cm and produced 2 flakes at 20-30 cm; while ST 81, dug to 35 cm (stopped
due to roots), and yielded 1 flake at 30 cm. No tests were dug in the public rightof-way. According to the engineering maps permission was not granted for
investigation on the west side of the road. Therefore, it is not known if the site
extends to that area. Since no diagnostic artifacts or features were found, the
age and function of this site are not known. The size of this site is estimated at
50 x 50 meters based on shovel test data and the size of the landform.
Following a visit to the 41LN399 by geologist Saul Aronow, it was
concluded that this site contains undisturbed deposits within the private right-ofway on the east side of the road. The public rights-of-way on both sides of the
road have been disturbed through road construction and erosion. Permission
must be granted to examine the private land on the west side of the road.

41LN400
This prehistoric site is on the Margie quadrangle and is located at the end
of an unimproved road and the south bank of Clear Creek near its confluence
with Cercey Branch. William E. Moore and Kelley Lackey discovered it on
February 17, 1994. According to the engineering maps provided by Johnson
Engineers, Inc. the site is on land owned by Martin H. Grimes.
Topographically, it is on a sandy terrace above the active and deeply
incised floodplain of Clear Creek at the 440 foot contour. A discussion with the
landowner who showed us a dart point from the area alerted us to the presence
of a prehistoric site. This was confirmed by shovel test 84 which produced two
flakes at 30-50 cm. The entire site area is on private land. Arrow points and a
large biface (6 x 15") were supposedly also found at the site.
The presence of arrow points and dart points indicate a campsite dating to
the Late Prehistoric period. The size of the site is estimated to be 200 x 400
meters based on the size of the landform.
Following a visit to the 41LN400 by geologist Saul Aronow, it was
concluded that this site contains undisturbed deposits within the site area in the
vicinity of the house. However, according to Johnson Engineers, Inc., the water
line will stop within a few meters of the end of the road. This area is downslope
from the main site area and is not believed to contain significant deposits.
41LN401
This multi-component site is on the Margie quadrangle and is located on
the east bank of Brushy Creek on county road 427 (Figure 2). William E. Moore
discovered it on March 12, 1994. According to the engineering maps provided by
Johnson Engineers, Inc. the site is on land owned separately by Carpenter, Carol
Carper, and L. F. Wetleb.
Topographically, it is on a sandy ridge above the active floodplain of
Brushy Creek at the 400 foot contour. The site was discovered by the presence
of three flakes and a cobble in a shovel test (ST 70) at approximately 25 cm
below the ground surface. Additional tests produced both prehistoric and historic
materials and a surface examination revealed an intact brick well (out of the rightof-way) and a historic ceramic fragment. In all, 8 shovel tests were dug yielding
13 flakes, 1 cobble, 2 rock fragments, and 1 chunk. Only one test, which was
dug downslope, failed to yield cultural materials. The most productive test was
ST 73 with 4 flakes. Within what is believed to be the main area of the
prehistoric site, 2 tests yielded clear glass fragments in the upper 10-20 cm.
Shovel Test 83, dug near the well, produced glass, metal, and a flake in a very
disturbed context.

Figure 2. Map of Site 41LN401

The tests were dug on private land on the east side of the road. The
opposite side of the road and both public rights-of-way are disturbed. They are
on a portion of the landform that does not appear to be suitable for a site and,
therefore, were not tested. Since no diagnostic prehistoric artifacts or features
were found the age and function of this component are not known. The historic
component can tentatively be dated to the early 20th century and is believed to
represent a house location. The presence of domestic plants (possibly iris)
supports this conclusion. A concrete dip tank is present downslope but it is not
known if it is associated with the site area at the top of the ridge. A former
structure is indicated on the topographic map in the vicinity of the dip tank. The
size of the prehistoric component may be as large as 200 x 300 meters based on
shovel tests, surface investigation, and size of the landform. The size of the
historic component (house area) is much smaller, probably not more than 50 x 50
meters.
Following a visit to 41LN401 by geologist Saul Aronow, it was concluded
that this is a desirable landform for a prehistoric or historic site. The area of the
prehistoric component appears to be undisturbed, while the immediate area of
the well has been disturbed. The rights-of-way and private land on the west side
of the road have been disturbed by road construction and erosion.
41LN402
This historic site is on the Jewett quadrangle and is located on the east
bank of Starrett Branch and the south side of F.M. 1469. William E. Moore and
Robert C. Booth discovered it on February 2, 1994. According to the engineering
maps provided by Johnson Engineering, Inc. the site is on land owned by Bill
Dubois.
Topographically, it is on a sandy ridge overlooking the floodplain of
Starrett Branch to the west at the 440 foot contour. The site consists of a
standing structure (house) that probably dates to the early 20th century and is
located just inside the fence on private land. It is in very poor condition and
appears to be in danger of collapsing in the near future. No shovel tests were
dug in the site area. This site is not eligible for nomination to the National
Register of Historic Places as it is not believed to be pre-modern in age
(predating the 1920s-1930s), lacks architectural merit, and is in poor condition
(not intact).
41LN403
This historic site is on the Margie quadrangle and is located on the east
side of county road 426 on the north bank of an unnamed tributary of Brushy
Creek. William E. Moore discovered it on March 12, 1994. According to the
engineering maps provided by Johnson Engineers, Inc. the site is on land owned
by Jimmy Lee Herrin.

Topographically, it is on a sandy hill overlooking the floodplain of the
tributary to the south at the 460 foot contour. The site consists of a house that
probably dates to the early to middle 20th century and a log crib cluster that may
also be of this age. The cribs are just inside the fence on private land, but the
house is well outside the right-of-way. The house is in very good condition and
appears to be inhabited but the cribs appeared to be empty at the time of this
survey. The cribs are made of pine logs and joined by saddle notching, a
common method in this part of Texas. Although there are numerous similar log
cribs in Leon County, the research value of this type of structure is questionable.
According to Fields (1988:244), "these kinds of outbuildings dating to the second
quarter of the twentieth century occur commonly in the east-central Texas
region." Shovel testing in the area proved negative in terms of prehistoric or
historic artifacts.
