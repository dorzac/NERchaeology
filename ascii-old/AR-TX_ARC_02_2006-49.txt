ABSTRACT
In October and November 2006, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted
archaeological testing along the northern spillway wall of and two islands
below the White Rock Lake Spillway. Both the northern and southern
spillway walls had been disturbed during the 2006 flooding of the lake and
will be replaced. The southern wall was not investigated due to absence of
any native soil. Site 41DL83, the White Rock Lake Spillway site, was
recorded in the area and contained a midden and burials. Archaeological
testing was done to determine if the site extended into the study area, and,
if so, to determine the extent and stratigraphy and make recommendations
about its significance. The testing was done for Halff Associates, Inc.
which is designing the wall replacement and construction for the City of
Dallas. Fifty-three shovel tests supplemented by augering were excavated
within the study area. Only twelve of the shovel tests contained artifacts,
but no artifact concentrations or cultural features were discovered. No
cultural materials were found on the northern island and scattered buried
cultural materials were found on the southern island and south of the
northern spillway wall.
Based upon the scarcity of artifacts and the absence of artifact
concentrations and cultural features, AR Consultants recommends that the
Texas Historical Commission and the Corps of Engineers agree with us
that work can proceed as planned without the need for addition cultural
resources investigation. If buried archaeological features or artifact
concentrations should be uncovered during construction, work should
cease immediately in that area, and the Corps of Engineers and the Texas
Historical Commission be notified. However, if future construction occurs
along the northern portion of the spillway approximately 30 m west the
gabions, it is recommended that cultural resource investigations be
conducted because this area was not tested and intact, buried deposits of
site 41DL83 might be present.

INTRODUCTION
White Rock Lake was completed in 1910 for the City of Dallas as a source of municipal
water. It continued as part of Dallas’ water supply until 1929, when its use changed to
recreation. The original channel of White Rock Creek is in the approximate middle of the
dam structure. Limestone bedrock lines the south and north sides of the floodplain.
Footings, on both sides of the floodplain, were placed into the bedrock to secure the dam.
At the northeast end of the dam, stepped sections of the limestone were removed and that
area became the spillway (City of Dallas Engineers, Dallas map 1971).
In the spring of 2006, a major flood event caused part of the northern wall of the White
Rock Lake Spillway to collapse and the southern wall to slip laterally (Figure 1). The
City of Dallas intends to replace both spillway walls. The importance of the proposed
wall replacements is that the construction might impact site the White Rock Spillway site
(Figure 2). The site is located below the White Rock Lake Spillway and was recorded by
members of the Dallas Archeological Society (Harris 1949; Hatzenbueler 1988;
Hatzenbueler and Harris 1949; Kirkland and Harris 1941). At the time of recording, the
midden contained burials, lithic debris and tools, shell, bone, points and pottery
fragments. Also, AR Consultant (2000) previously had conducted archaeological
investigations in the area along the northern wall which is now covered by rock gabions
and found a thin site deposit which might extend upslope to the west and north. The
southern wall was constructed in 1968 and no testing was done to determine if site
41DL83 extended into the bank wall.
Since site 41DL83 might be impacted, AR Consultants, Inc. was hired by Halff
Associates, which is designing the wall for the City of Dallas, to perform an
archaeological survey. The purpose of the survey was to determine if the site might
extend not only into the construction area but access areas as well and make
recommendations about the significance of the impact.
This report will be reviewed by Corps of Engineers and the Archeology Division of the
Texas Historical Commission as part of their Section 106 review process. The relevant
federal legislation includes the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended
(PL-96-515), the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), and the
Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291). Also,
since the City of Dallas is a political entity of Texas, the Texas Historical Commission
will review the report as a State agency. Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4236 was
issued for the archaeological testing.
This report has been written in accordance with the guidelines for reports prepared by the
Council of Texas Archeologists (N.D.). The following report presents a brief description
of the natural and cultural environment of the pipeline route and vicinity. This is followed
by a description of the methodology. The results of the investigation follow and
constitute the body of the report. The last chapter presents recommendations that arise
from the study. A list of references cited concludes the report.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The project area is located in the Blackland Prairie vegetative province (Diggs,
Lipscomb, and O’Kennon 1999) in North Central Texas. Underlying this province is the
Austin Chalk formation of Upper Cretaceous age (Bureau of Economic Geology 1972;
Allen and Flanigan 1986:365). Topographically, the work areas are situated on an Austin
Chalk ridge that anchors the east end of the dam and over which the spillway was
constructed [Work Area 11] and in the present floodplain of White Rock Creek [Work
Area 13]. Austin Chalk is exposed in the bed of the spillway and pieces litter the bed of
White Rock Creek. Holocene-age Quaternary alluvium is shown in the valley of White
Rock Creek downstream from the dam and earlier Quaternary terrace deposits are shown
on the ridge between the southeastern edge of the lake and Ash Creek to the south.
Because Quaternary alluvium is shown in Dixon Branch upstream from the lake edge, it
is likely that the same alluvium was along both sides of the creek before being obscured
by the lake. The old White Rock Creek channel has been impacted by the construction of
a fish hatchery below the dam in the floodplain sediments and by the rerouting of water
over the spillway.
The Soil Conservation Service (Coffee, Hill, and Ressel 1980:Sheet 25) mapped all the
soils in the floodplain and including the spillway as Frio-Urban land complex [#38]. This
is not the actual situation. Frequently flooded Frio silty clay [#37] is present in the
floodplain of White Rock Creek. However, the soil on top of the Austin chalk that has
been used for the spillway is probably the Eddy-Brackett complex with 8 to 20 percent
slopes [#28]. The Frio series soils consist of deep, well drained clayey soils that are
occasionally flooded. The soils are nearly level and are formed on recent floodplain
alluvium. The depth to underlying gravel or limestone is more than two meters (Coffee,
Hill, and Ressel 1980:25, 60). The Eddy-Brackett complex is made up of strongly sloping
to moderately steep, shallow to very shallow, soils overlying the Austin chalk. The
topsoil is generally clay that rests on platy chalky limestone. The entire floodplain,
including the spillway was mapped as Trinity clay. These discrepancies serve to point out
that general mapping is not always a precise science.
White Rock Creek is a permanent tributary of the Trinity River that receives water from
seasonal runoff as well as from seep springs throughout the watershed. Keller, or White
Rock Springs flow from the Austin chalk about a mile south of the Collin County line in
north-central Dallas County. In 1942, the springs had a flow of 1.3 liters per second
(Brune 1981:154). In addition to the main springs, there are many named and unnamed
tributaries that contribute water to White Rock Creek. One of these creeks, Dixon
Branch, is located on the east side of White Rock Creek midway down the east side of
White Rock Lake.
The setting of the work areas below the dam and spillway makes the determination of
native versus planted species difficult. However, there are some willow and cottonwood
trees along the creek, and other major plant species are cedar, hackberry, American elm,

pecan, and greenbriars. The urban setting has eliminated the larger fauna such as deer
and bison; presently, only small mammals, such as squirrel, opossum, rabbit, and raccoon
reside in and around the project area. With the old White Rock Creek channel adjacent to
the spillway, birds, fish, and various amphibians are numerous.
A consensus about the paleoenvironmental conditions of North Central Texas over the
past 12,000 years has not been reached. Discussions by Prikryl (1993), Ferring and Yates
(1997), Humphrey and Ferring (1994), and Brown (1998) offer disparate interpretations
based on different analytical approaches. The following discussion relies heavily on
Ferring’s investigations and focuses upon the past two thousand years. Correlating
periods of rapid alluviation with higher precipitation and slow alluviation with drier
conditions, Ferring has concluded that the Late Holocene [5000 yr B.P. to the present]
was a wet period with moderate alluviation, except for a dry period between 2000 and
1000 yr B.P. [A.D. 1 to1000]. It was during this dry period that the West Fork Paleosol
was established on the stable surfaces of the river meanders along the Upper Trinity and
its tributaries. This interpretation is supported by changing patterns seen in stable isotope
analysis. Brown (1998) offers a differing interpretation based on isotopic analyses of
mussel shells from a prehistoric site (41DL270) on Denton Creek. He concludes that the
period from 1500 to 2500 yr B.P. was cooler and/or wetter and that before and after the
environment was warmer and drier, but he points out that this interpretation may only be
applicable for the Elm Fork tributary and not the region.

CULTURAL ENVIRONMENT
The Dallas Archeological Society (DAS) has been the constant agent recording and
investigating sites along White Rock Creek since the 1930s. The previous DAS surveys
throughout the county have recently been reevaluated by attempting to relocate all the
recorded archaeological sites, but this re-survey has yet to be compiled into a synthesis.
Discussions of Dallas area archaeology are provided by Smith (1969), Skinner, Richner,
and Johnston (1978), Ferring (1986), and Prikryl (1990).
Prikryl proposes the following periods for the prehistory of the Elm Fork area and they
are useful throughout this part of north-central Texas:
Historic
Late Prehistoric II
Late Prehistoric I
Late Archaic
Middle Archaic
Early Archaic
Paleo-Indian

A.D. 1600 to present
A.D. 1200 to 1600
A.D. 600 to 1200
1550 B.C. to A.D. 600
4050 to 1550 B.C.
6000 to 4050 B.C.
pre-6000 B.C.

The Paleo-Indian culture (10,000 to 6,000 BC) had been described as relying on an
economy of hunting and gathering, with primary emphasis being on the hunting and
processing of megafauna (mammoth and bison). The Lewisville site (Crook and Harris
1957) and the Aubrey site (Ferring 1989) are good examples of sites dated to this period.
Both campsites were deeply buried and preserved under the sediments of the present
floodplains of the Elm Fork of the Trinity River. Surface artifacts dating to this period
have been reported from the Dallas County area (Meltzer and Bever 1995: Table 2), but
no Paleoindian sites have been investigated. There is little evidence of Paleo-Indian
occupation in the White Rock Creek area, although projectile points such as Clovis,
Folsom, Meserve, Plainview, San Patrice, Scottsbluff, and Eden have been found on the
surface of sites throughout the region.
In his synthesis of Late Quaternary geomorphology in the region, Ferring (1986)
describes the sediments at the mouth of White Rock Creek as being at least 60 feet deep.
He goes on to conclude that the incision which these sediments filled is probably younger
than 20,000 years B.P. While this does not provide a date for sediments upstream along
White Rock Creek, it does suggest that buried deposits dating from the Paleo-Indian
period and more recently could be present.
The Archaic culture period follows the Paleoindian and lasts from 6,000 BC to possibly
as late as AD 600. Hunting and gathering continued to be the means by which the people
supported their groups. This adaptation was more diversified than that of the earlier
period and there is limited evidence that the population increased during the course of
this time period. Archaic sites are more common, although there is little evidence of

Early Archaic occupation in the area. The Middle Archaic period has been termed the
Trinity Aspect in the Trinity River Basin, although Prikryl and others do not use the term
since it is not defined from sealed contexts. By the Late Archaic, there is sufficient
information to describe the presence of several site types. These include midden sites,
shell lens sites, artifact scatters, and upland edge scatters. The majority of these sites are
known to occur along the major drainages.
A transition to the Late Prehistoric/Caddoan period is signaled by the presence of a crude
form of generally plain brown pottery known as Williams Plain that occurs at sites where
dart points dominate the assemblages. The beginning of the Late Prehistoric is signaled
by the appearance of ceramics and arrow points in the first millennium AD. The Late
Prehistoric I period (ca. AD 600 to 1200) also is signaled by the appearance of houses
and corn horticulture. Locally made pottery appears to be copies of Caddoan Alto and
Sanders phase types. Evidence for corn horticulture was noted at the Cobb-Pool site at
Lake Joe Pool (McGregor and Peter 1988). Late Prehistoric II dates from AD 1200-1600
and is characterized by the appearance of a Plains Village-like artifact assemblage.
Harahey knives, thumbnail scrapers, and flake drills are frequently found with triangularshaped and Perdiz arrowpoints. In some cases, these artifacts have been found with bison
kills and in other cases bison scapulas had been used to make hoe blades. Nocona Plain, a
shell-tempered pottery, occurs during this prehistoric period and is believed to be locally
made.
The Protohistoric period of North Central Texas begins with the entrance of the Spanish
about AD 1541. Soon thereafter, immigrant Native American groups moved into the area
and either displaced the prehistoric inhabitants or moved into areas that had previously
been abandoned. The beginning of this period was marked by the limited and sporadic
contact between European explorers and the native occupants. The introduction and
adoption of the horse, and ultimately firearms, resulted in a shift from a more sedentary
seasonal round to emphasis on the bison hunting.
A wide variety of Native American groups inhabited this part of Texas, but few sites are
attributed to historic Indians in this region (Skinner 1988), although sites are known in
surrounding areas where historic Wichita sites are reported from near Waco, Mexia,
Emory, and Spanish Fort. The historic period overlaps with the protohistoric but is best
known in the area for the period from the Civil War to the present. During this period, the
indigenous population was eliminated or removed from the area. The invading Europeans
focused on farming and ranching.
The Anglo-American history of the Upper Trinity River Basin has been divided into the
Frontier, Initial Cash Crop, Tenant Farming, and Agribusiness periods by Richner and
Lee (1976:125-133). The Frontier period lasted from about 1820 to 1850 and was
followed by the Initial Cash Crop period which lasted until 1870. Tenant Farming began
at 1870 and continued to about 1940. Agribusiness began after the Great Depression and
continues to this date.

Previous Investigations
Although limited investigations have been conducted in the White Rock Creek
Watershed, the information provides a glimpse of a variety of prehistoric occupation. The
White Rock Lake Spillway site, 41DL83, is a midden site that contained several burials
as well as village debris (Harris 1949; Hatzenbueler 1988; Hatzenbueler and Harris 1949;
Kirkland and Harris 1941). The site was partially destroyed by spillway construction, but
DAS excavations revealed a deposit that covered an area at least 96 by 120 meters.
Artifacts included dart and arrow points, scrapers, a broken metate, mussel shell,
mammal bones [including bison and deer], burned rock, and prehistoric pottery. A total
of seven human skeletons were recovered from four graves and each of the bodies was in
a flexed position. A string of 81 bone beads and 2 turtle shell beads were found with 3
burials that were in one grave. Harris reported to the junior author that part of the site
remains intact below the spillway, and this has been confirmed by Bill Young of
Corsicana.
AR Consultants (Skinner and Trask 2000) investigated two work areas located near the
White Rock Lake Spillway. A thin site deposit had been covered by construction debris
outside the existing northern spillway wall. The full extent of the site deposit was not
determined because it was covered by more than a meter of fill. The other work area did
not impact any of site 41DL83.
Other sites adjacent to the lake are the Humphrey site and the Dixon’s Branch site. The
Humphrey site (Solberger 1953) is described as being a Late Prehistoric and possibly
early historic Native American site that was located on the west side of the lake. The site
was destroyed by house construction; little is known about its assemblage or exact
placement. Of interest through is the fact that the site was not along the creek bank, but
was on an elevated location apparently west of the present day Lawther Drive.
The Dixon’s Branch site (41DL40) is a bison skeleton that was found in the bed of
Dixon’s Branch on the east side of White Rock Lake (Harris and Harris 1970). The
bones were found lying on a gravel bed and covered by a gray silt. Three small triangular
arrow points of the Fresno style were found in the rib cage of this young bison. The lower
leg bones and the skull were not recovered because they had been eroded away. Small
flecks of charcoal associated with the skull of an adult bison found just downstream a
short distance were radiocarbon dated to A.D. 1475. The skull was also found on the
gravel and was covered with gray silt. It was associated with a quartzite biface. The
authors concluded that the two bison are contemporaneous.
These sources serve to demonstrate the presence of significant prehistoric, and possibly
historic, Native American occupation along White Rock Creek. Sites tend to be located
in relatively close proximity to water sources and there is evidence at the White Rock
Lake Spillway site that occupation was repeated and may have been relatively permanent.
There appears to have been occupation during the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric

periods and hunting and gathering the indigenous mammals and riverine resources
provided a major source of food.
Three recent studies (Skinner, Trask, and Whorton 1995, 1996; Skinner and Trask 1999)
in the floodplain of White Rock Creek have failed to locate any evidence of buried
deposits. It seems likely that the sediments, although deep and impressive, are fairly
young [several hundred years], as indicated by the discovery of the deeply buried Dixon
Branch site and the absence of underlying and earlier Holocene sediments.

METHODOLOGY
Prior to fieldwork, a comprehensive records check was conducted. Early maps of Dallas
County were reviewed, as were the records at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin. The National Register of Historic Places
(Steely 1984; Texas Historical Commission 1994) and guides to Texas Historical
Markers (Awbrey and Dooley 1992; Texas Historical Commission 1975) also were
checked. These records were reviewed to determine if sites in addition to the White Rock
Lake Spillway site had been reported in the immediate vicinity of the study area. Sites
have been recorded upstream and downstream along White Rock Creek and the majority
are situated on elevations above flooding and close to the creek channel.
The archaeological testing of the area below the White Rock Lake Spillway focused on
the both banks of the spillway and the two islands below the spillway. The purpose of the
testing was to determine if buried cultural materials were present, their depth and aerial
extent.

FIELD METHODS
A comprehensive pedestrian survey was conducted of the northern bank and the two
islands. Shovel testing was conducted to explore for buried deposits and fill was passed
through one-quarter inch mesh hardware cloth screens. Most of the shovel tests were
supplemented by the use of a 4-inch bucket auger. Disturbed areas were intensively
inspected for surface artifacts and for evidence of buried cultural or soil horizons. Two
transects, about 10 meters apart and based upon the terrain, of shovel tests were
excavated along the northern wall. The shovel tests along the transects were spaced
approximately 5 meters apart.
Shovel tests on the northern island were placed along a low ridge that possibly contained
undisturbed sediments and were spaced 5 meters apart. The shovel tests also were
supplemented by augering. Shovel testing was done on a judgmental basis on the
southern island due to the amount of erosion. Shovel tests were supplemented by
augering.
Field notes about the topography, vegetation and other relevant data were made and
photographs were taken during the survey.

RESULTS
The following chapter has been divided into two sections. The first presents the results of
the archaeological investigation. The second section is a discussion of the significance of
the testing of the White Rock Lake Spillway area. Recommendations are presented in the
final chapter.

Archaeological Investigations
The following discussion of the archaeological investigations consists of four parts. The
survey north of White Rock Creek and along the northern spillway’s wall is discussed
first. Shovel tests are shown on Figure 4 and discussed in the text. Specific information is
provided in Table 3. This is followed by a description of the archaeological survey of the
northern island and then of the southern island. The analysis of the artifacts is discussed
next. Conclusions end this portion of the report.
The southern spillway wall
It was originally intended to deep test the area between the southern wall and Garland
Road. The concern about the deep testing was that the rip rap might collapse into the hole
since it is such a narrow space between the wall and the road. However, Fugro
Consultants LP had excavated a test bore (Figure 3) where the backhoe trench was to be
excavated and did not encounter any native soil. The Texas Historical Commission was
contacted and stated in a letter dated October 16, 2006 that no deep testing was
recommended in the area between the spillway’s southern wall and Garland Road.
The northern spillway wall
The northern spillway is divided into four areas. Each one is discussed below. The first
area is the floodplain between the ridge southeast of the park fence and a channel of
White Rock Creek. Vegetation includes saw greenbriar, grape vine and native bushes.
Trees include oak, hackberry and elm. Ground visibility ranged from less than 10 percent
to 100 percent along a dirt trail that runs through the study area which is shown in Figure
5. Eye-height visibility was limited to 30 m at times.
Survey began about 100 feet (33 meters) southwest of the existing gabion along the
spillway’s northern wall. Shovel tests were placed adjacent to the northern bank of a
branch of White Rock Creek and along a terrace southeast of a park fence. Shovel tests
(STs) 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14 and 16 were placed along the bank at encountered a
variety of soils. However, shell fragments were encountered in ST 5. Shovel test 6 was
placed 4 m southeast of ST 5 and uncovered bone, shell and lithics. Shovel test 7 was
placed 5 m northwest of ST 5 but only uncovered bone and charcoal. Shovel test 8 was
placed 7 m northwest of ST 6 at the edge of the terrace but encountered fissil shale at 7
cm below the surface. No cultural materials were found in ST 8. Approximately 5 m

northwest of ST 5, charcoal flakes were encountered in ST 10. Shovel test 11 was placed
about 4 m southeast of ST 10 and uncovered 35 cm of culturally sterile soil overlying
bedrock. Shovel test 12 was excavated approximately 5 m northwest of ST 10 and
uncovered 31 cm of culturally sterile soil overlying bedrock.

Shovel tests 2, 4, 9, 13, 15, 17, 18 and 19 were placed on the terrace (Figure 6) from
about 28 meters southwest of the gabion to about 10 m northwest of the gabion prior to a
sharp rise in elevation. The shovel tests were culturally sterile and limestone bedrock was
encountered at an average of 35 cm below the ground surface. Ground visibility ranged
from less than 10 to 30 percent. Eye-height visibility was good. Understory vegetation
includes berry vines, poison ivy and oak, daisies and native bushes. Trees include oak,
hackberry, elm and eastern red cedar.
The area northeast of the gabion consists of trees which include oak, elm, hackberry and
eastern red cedar. Understory vegetation includes rabbit grass, poison oak and ivy and
native grasses and bushes (Figure 7). A caliche/dirt trail runs from the gabion to a fence
that separates this area from a limestone outcrop area that goes to the dam. Ground
visibility ranges from less than 10 percent to 100 percent in the generally level area
which does slope somewhat toward the spillway wall. Eye-height visibility was good.
Shovel tests 20 through 29 were excavated on the higher portion of the study area
northeast of the gabions. Shovel tests were placed 5 m from the spillway wall and
approximately 5 m from the fence that marks the park boundary. All of the shovel tests
were culturally sterile. Shovel test 20 uncovered 30 cm of clay overlying sandy clay
which overlaid limestone bedrock at 46 cm below the ground surface. Shovel test 21
encountered 11 cm of clay overlying limestone bedrock. Shovel test 22 uncovered 34 cm

of sandy clay overlying limestone bedrock. Shovel test 23 encountered 31 cm loamy clay
overlying a mixture of clays that extended to 39 cm below the ground surface. The
mixture of clays contained limestone gravel from 39 to 67 cm and overlaid limestone
bedrock. Shovel test 24 encountered 35 cm of sandy clay overlying limestone bedrock.
Loamy clay extending to 34 cm below the ground surface was encountered in SH 25. The
loamy clay was underlain by clay which extended to 44 cm and overlaid limestone
bedrock. Shovel test 26 uncovered 33 cm of clay overlying limestone bedrock. Fifteen
cm of loamy clay overlaid clay that extended to 58 cm below the ground surface where
limestone bedrock was encountered in ST 27. Shovel test 28 encountered 38 cm of sandy
clay overlying limestone bedrock and ST 29 uncovered 32 cm of loamy clay overlying
the bedrock limestone.
Shovel test 30 was placed on a small knoll northeast of the fence and encountered 4 cm
of culturally sterile clay overlying limestone bedrock. This portion of the spillway
consists of limestone on the surface. Except for the small knoll, the area was not shovel
tested due to the excellent ground visibility and limestone outcropping on the surface
(Figure 8). Shovel tests 31 and 32 were placed on small knolls within in the park but
failed to discover any cultural materials. Shovel test 31 encountered 26 cm of sandy clay
overlying limestone bedrock and ST 32 uncovered 27 cm of clay overlying limestone
bedrock.

The northern island
The northern island is severely eroded with scattered vegetation. Vegetation mainly
consists of native bushes and elm, hackberry and eastern red cedar trees (Figure 9).
Ground visibility ranged from 30 to 100 percent. Eye-height visibility was very good.
Transient camps and recent trash are scattered throughout the surface of the island.

Figure 9.

Ground visibility and vegetation on northern island. View is to southwest.

Shovel tests 33 through 44 were excavated along a small ridge that is oriented northeast
to southwest. Shovel tests were placed at the southwest end of the island and ran
northeast. Shovel test 33 encountered 45 cm of culturally sterile clay overlying degrading
limestone bedrock. Shovel tests 34 through 37 uncovered clay that ranged from 36 to 100
cm overlying silty clay that extended from 36 to 164 cm below the ground surface.
Charcoal, lithics, bone and glass were recovered from the shovel tests. Shovel test 38
uncovered 36 cm of clay overlying limestone bedrock. Lithics were discovered in the
upper 36 cm. Culturally sterile clay to 122+ was encountered in ST 39. Forty-seven cm of
clay overlaid a different clay that contained lithics, bone and shell that extended to 107+
cm below the ground surface. Bone was found in the upper 37 cm of clay which overlaid
limestone bedrock in ST 40. Shovel tests 41 through 43 uncovered clay ranging from 15
to 37 cm below the ground surface which overlaid limestone bedrock. Shovel test 44 was
culturally sterile and encountered 44 cm of clay overlying a different clay that extended
to 52 cm below the ground surface.

The southern island
Vegetation on the southern island includes saw greenbriar, grape vine and native grasses
and bushes. Trees include bois d’arc and hackberry but are mainly eastern red cedar.
Ground visibility ranges from less than 10 to 100 percent (Figure 10). Two at least 1.5 m
deep ditches run across the island. One is shown in Figure 11. A slough at the southern
end of the island appears to have been created. Limestone rock covers the ground surface
on the southeastern edge of the slough. From the slough southwestward, the land is
marshy and barely above water. This portion of the island was not investigated.

Figure 10.

Ground visibility and vegetation on the southern island. View is to the
south.

Nine shovel tests (45 through 53) were placed on knolls and ridges on the southern
island. All of the shovel tests were culturally sterile. Shovel test 45 uncovered 72 cm of
clay mixed with limestone which overlaid clay that extended to 74 cm below the ground
surface. Shovel test 46 encountered 54 cm of loamy clay that overlaid clay which
overlaid a different clay that extended from 62 to 84 cm below the ground surface.
Twenty-eight cm of clay overlaid a mixture of clays that extended to 51 cm below the
ground surface was uncovered in ST 47. Shovel test 48 uncovered 31 cm of clay
overlying a different clay to 59 cm below the ground surface. Thirty-eight cm of clay
overlying a mixture of clays that overlaid a clay that extended from 55 to 72 cm below
the ground surface was encountered in ST 49. Loamy clay ranging from the surface to 30
cm below the surface was encountered in ST 50. The loamy clay was underlain by clay

which was underlain by clay containing limestone gravel from 42 to 83 cm below the
ground surface. Shovel tests 51 through 53 uncovered loamy clay ranging from the
surface to 40 cm below the surface. The loamy clay was underlain by a clay that extended
from 47 to 66 cm. A different clay ranging from 63 to 82 cm below the ground surface
was encountered in STs 51 and 52.
Artifact analysis
The following is the analysis of the artifacts recovered from the shovel tests.
The analysis of the flakes (Table 1) indicates that lithic reduction was occurring at site
41DL83. The lithics from the 80 to 90 level in shovel test 42 indicate the presence of te
lower portion of the midden that Kirkland and Harris (1941:49) describes as being more
than 4 feet thick in places.
The bones, both turtle and mammal, are tabulated in Figure 2. Those in the upper 20 cm
probably represent recent deposition and the possible presence of 41DL83. This is
reinforced by the unweathered look to some of the turtle shell. The slightly burned bones
could have been from a transient’s hearth in the area. The two turtle bones from 80 to 90
cm below the ground surface in shovel test 42 probably indicates the lower portion of the
midden discussed above.

In addition, two valves of Amblema plicata were recovered from shovel test 6 in the
upper 10 centimeters. The valves probably represent one mussel which is in the early
stage of maturity. A wire nail was recovered from the upper 10 centimeters of shovel test
6 and fishing line was recovered from shovel test 16 at 20 cm below the ground surface.
The mussel shell, fishing line and nail represent modern trash/deposition and are not
associated with 41DL83. The shell fragments from the 40 to 50 cm level in shovel test 5,

shovel test 40 probably are from site 41DL83. No identification could be made as to the
mussel species.
Charcoal was discovered in shovel tests 7, 10, 14, 35, 36 and 37 at depths ranging from
20 to 139 cm below the ground surface. Undoubtedly, some of the charcoal is from
modern transient hearths, but some of the charcoal surely is associated with site 41DL83.
The amount of charcoal recovered from the shovel tests does not compare to the midden
that is described as being 4 feet thick in places. It appears that the deposit described by
Kirkland and Harris primarily has eroded away.

Summary
Based upon the USGS map (Figure 2), a 1980s aerial photograph and a recent aerial
photograph (Figure 1), one can see that the area below the spillway has eroded
extensively. The site that Kirland and Harris and others described is no longer present
due to the erosion and channelization done by the city in 1971. No cultural features,
burials or artifact concentrations were discovered during the shovel testing of the White
Rock Spillway area. The midden that Kirkland and Harris described as being 4 feet thick
in places is not present where the testing occurred. Testing by AR Consultants in 2000
failed to find any such deposits along the northern spillway wall either. On a hopeful
note, intact portions of site 41DL83 may be located southwest of where the testing
occurred, and outside the impact area.

RECOMMENDATIONS

The area southwest of the northern spillway wall was surveyed to determine if cultural
materials older than 50 years were present in case of collateral damage during the
replacement of the northern spillway wall. The islands also were tested to determine if
prehistoric cultural materials were present. Although the recovered cultural materials
were scarce and no artifact concentrations and cultural features were found, AR
Consultants recommends that if construction is occur in southwest of the northern
spillway wall or on the northern island, further cultural resource investigations are
warranted. Otherwise, AR Consultants, Inc. believes that replacement of the northern and
southern spillway walls will not encounter any archaeological sites and that the City of
Dallas, Department of Water Utilities should be allowed to continue with plans for
construction of the northern and southern walls of the White Rock Spillway. Also, AR
Consultants, Inc. requests that the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission and the Fort Worth District of the US Army Corps of Engineers concur with
our recommendation. The White Rock Lake Spillway archaeological site (41DL83), as
described by Kirkland and Harris and others, will not be impacted in any way by
construction in the two work areas.
As previously mentioned, no artifact concentrations or cultural features were discovered
during the testing of the work areas. However, the area approximately 33 m southwest of
the northern spillway wall was not tested. Hopefully, buried intact cultural deposits are
present in this area and if future construction should impact this area, archaeological
testing should be conducted.
